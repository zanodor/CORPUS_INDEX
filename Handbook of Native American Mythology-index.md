PREFACE
Most North Americans possess some knowledge of the entertaining and illumi
nating world of mythology. This knowledge was typically gained by reading
translations of various stories, including those found in biblical literature, or
through formal study of art history or the classical texts that have long been a
traditional cornerstone of Western literary education. Indeed, North Americans
are most familiar with the myths of the ancient Greeks, or their Roman adapta
tions. It is likely that they have some literary or visual knowledge of the Greek
god Zeus as the supreme ruler or lord of the sky, and that his daughter
Aphrodite is the goddess of love and beauty. To many, these two are better
known by their Roman names, Jupiter and Venus. These same readers would
likely know that Hera, or Juno, is Zeus’s wife and sister, and that she is a jeal
ous goddess prone to causing trouble. Many know that the story of Persephone
and Demeter explains the change of seasons and are aware that there is a Norse
god of thunder, war, and strength called Thor. Those with a more in-depth edu
cation in the field might also possess the knowledge and ability to converse
with some authority about the great epics of Homer and myths of the ancient
Egyptians.
Sadly, however, few North Americans have developed much awareness or
appreciation of the rich and diverse mythic traditions and heritage of the hun
dreds of cultures of Native peoples who inhabited the continent before them.
Most cannot speak with any knowledge of the culture hero Glooskap, the trick
sters Coyote and Raven, the sea woman Sedna, or the many tales of creation
that feature animal characters like Beaver, Duck, Mink, Muskrat, Turtle, or
Loon. However, the fascinating and lively panorama of imaginary beasts, hu
man heroes, powers of nature, and nurturing spirits that comprise one of the
world’s most varied and abundant bodies of mythology was already firmly es
tablished when the first European explorers came to the Americas around 1500.
Certainly, a familiarity and understanding of the mythology of the continent on
which we live is just as important as a knowledge of the mythology of the an
cient Greeks and Egyptians and northern Europeans.

This Handbook of Native American Mythology is designed to introduce
the reader to the mythology of cultures found in native North America, includ
ing the region from north of Mexico to the Arctic Circle.1 Users will include
those interested in researching, browsing, or identifying material on the topic
teachers and students, and those reading for pleasure and exploring the subject
out of self-interest. Although the myths of Native Americans have been
recorded since the first European contacts, research shows that it is difficult to
place them within specific time periods because they are a part of oral tradi
tions that have often changed and evolved through history as they were told, re
told, and intentionally polished to fit the needs or suit the literary tastes of a
specific audience. They are placed in historical context in the introduction and
the chapter on time.
Because this is a reference work for a general audience, with the intent of
guiding the user to information in studies that are more narrow, detailed, and
focused, its own content and coverage is broader. It would be impossible, given
the scope of this study, to be comprehensive or deeply analytical. As a result,
for example, we did not analyze differences in mythological traditions between
regions, explore links between the historical record and the development of
those traditions, trace the diffusion of mythic elements across Native cultures,
or distinguish between mythical ideas that are exclusively Native and those
that originated with Europeans. Such discussions are best treated in smaller,
more limited studies that are usually scholarly in nature.
An examination of our focus reveals that, in selecting entries, we aimed to
achieve broad cultural and regional representation across North America. We
also chose themes or stories that are important because they distinguish a par
ticular culture or cut across cultures. We also identified myths that are less
well-known but thought to be as interesting or entertaining to others as they
were to us. While we realize that Native American mythology, ritual, and reli
gion are often intertwined and difficult to separate, we have deliberately chosen
not to expound on the theological aspects, where they exist, of the stories, leg
ends, and mythological characters. Other reference resources delve into those
issues, and we have cited some of them in the bibliography.
In this volume’s introductory chapter, we explore the topic of myth in gen
eral and explain the definition, selected from among the many that exist, that
we used to focus this work. We also explore the geography and climate of the
North American continent and briefly discuss the history of Native peoples in
North America. In addition, we consider the ten culture areas American anthro
pologists use to organize the study of topics related to Native Americans, in
cluding mythology, and the sources and development of the study of Native
American myths. In the second chapter, we explore history and time from a
Preface
x



mythic viewpoint. The third chapter is comprised entirely of selected entries,
arranged alphabetically, of characters, themes, and stories from Native
American mythology. An annotated bibliography of selected print and nonprint
resources follows. A glossary, list of references, and subject index are also in
cluded. The bibliography and references will be helpful to those wishing to pur
sue further information and study.
This volume reflects the state of published research on Native American
mythology. This means that some or all of the information in many entries is
derived from the work of non-Native historians, anthropologists, and ethnogra
phers, many of whom were active in the nineteenth and early twentieth cen
turies. In addition, some of their publications are found in the list of references
and the bibliography, publications that are a record of the past and reflect the at
titudes, beliefs, and perspectives of different times. As librarians, we thought it
important to consult and present a variety of works that support study of the
topic, including those that may contain material that is offensive to some read
ers. We do not in any way endorse the views found in these resources. We
thought it of paramount importance to use, whenever possible, works by
Native Americans as the basis for this study, and we have also selected print
and electronic resources by Native Americans for inclusion in the bibliography,
plus videos and DVDs made by Native American–owned firms or in consulta
tion with Native American advisors, organizations, or institutions.
A NOTE ABOUT VARIANT AND PREFERRED NAMES AND SPELLINGS
Tribal names and spellings of those names have varied considerably over the
centuries, and still do. For example, the Navajo have declared a preference for
that spelling over Navaho. In addition, many Navajo routinely call themselves
Dineh (Diné), their traditional name in their native language, though the group
as a whole continues to refer to itself as the Navajo Nation. Ojibwa, Ojibway,
and Chippewa are all variant names for the same people who have always re
ferred to themselves by their traditional name of Anishinabe. The former
Winnebago of Wisconsin have officially renamed themselves the Ho-Chunk,
but the Winnebago of Nebraska still retain this name. Sioux is the popular
name for the Dakota, Lakota, and Nakota peoples. For consistency within this
work, and ease of information retrieval in library catalogs, we have chosen to
use the standard form of tribal name found in the twenty-sixth edition (2003) of
the controlled vocabulary known as the Library of Congress Subject Headings
(LCSH). Almost all tribal names used in this work happen to reflect common
Preface xi



usage; in those rare cases when they do not, the commonly used term has been
supplied in the text in parentheses. It should be noted that the standard form of
a tribal name found in LCSH and the commonly used term are not necessarily
the terms preferred by Native American peoples.
In the United States, the terms Native Americans and American Indians
tend to be used interchangeably. The preferred collective name for Native peo
ples in Canada is First Nations.
A NOTE ABOUT INUIT AND ESKIMO
The aboriginal peoples of the Arctic have long been known by the popular term
Eskimo. Those who inhabit the region from northern Alaska to western
Greenland prefer to call themselves Inuit, which means “the people” in the Inuit
language. Many Inuit regard the word Eskimo as pejorative, in part because it was
long thought, erroneously, to mean literally “eater of raw meat.” In Canada, use
of the word Eskimo has practically vanished, and Inuit is used officially by the
Canadian government. In Alaska, however, there are two language and culture
groups, the Inupiat and the Yupik. While the word Inuit exists in the Inupiat lan
guage, it does not exist in Yupik, Alaska’s most widely spoken Native language.
The indigenous people of southwestern Alaska prefer to be called Yupik or Yupik
Eskimo, and those from northwestern Alaska prefer the term Inupiat.
Regardless of the local self-designations mentioned above, Inuit has also
come to be used in a wider sense, in reference to all Native people traditionally
called Eskimo. Nevertheless, the term Eskimo continues to be used worldwide,
especially in historical and archaeological contexts, and in reference to the in
digenous Arctic peoples as a cultural and linguistic entity.

INTRODUCTION
W
hat, exactly, is a myth? This question elicits a variety of responses,
since many definitions exist and long-term scholarly debates about
the meaning of the word continue. Most would probably reply that
myths are the traditional stories, stories that are not true, of a particular cul
ture. A religious historian might say that a myth is an expression in words of
sacred rites or beliefs. An anthropologist would likely refer to a myth as a narra
tive that justifies a behavior, practice, or social institution. Myths are com
monly defined as stories that attempt to explain something, such as a natural
phenomenon or the origin of the world; myths are stories about gods and god
desses, or heroes and heroines; myths are stories used to educate or to provide
guidance by sharing collective knowledge or experience. All of these definitions
are valid, and, in fact, myths are true—true because they are based on reality
and address issues of the tangible world in which we live, even if the characters
and events themselves are imaginary.
One of the reasons it is difficult to define the term myth is because of simi
larities and analogies between myths and other traditional literary or narrative
forms. Examples include legends, fables, fairy tales, folktales, sagas, epics, and
parables. As with myth, there is no consensus among scholars regarding defini
tions, and boundaries for these terms tend to be fluid. Scholars also disagree
about how the various genres relate to both myths and each other. Myth, folk
tale, and legend often merge in a particular narrative; this is particularly true if
the story is lengthy and elaborate, or if it has been retold many times over a
long period. Nevertheless, some useful lines of distinction can be drawn be
tween myths and all of the aforementioned, with the possible exception of folk
tales.
Folktales are sometimes considered a subdivision of myth, and myths are
sometimes thought to be a branch of folktale. Eminent American folklorist
Stith Thompson declares that “attempts at exact definition of ‘myth’ as distin
guished from ‘tale’ seem futile” (Thompson 1971, xvii). He believes the one par
ticular characteristic of myth that differentiates it from folktale is the nature of
its narratives. They feature the world as it was in the past, and explain the ori
gin and creation of its current condition. Some scholars, such as British



Handbook of Native American Mythology
2
classicist Geoffrey S. Kirk, regard the two categories as distinct but overlapping.
In his Myth: Its Meaning and Functions in Ancient and Other Cultures, he de
clares that myths serve a purpose other than to simply tell a story, whereas
folktales “tend to reflect simple social situations; they play on ordinary fears
and desires as well as on men’s appreciation of neat and ingenious solu
tions . . .” (1970, 41). Examples of themes that occur in folktales include adver
sarial encounters between humans and supernatural beings such as witches,
ogres, or giants; contests to win a bride; or triumphs by trickster heroes over an
opponent using wit and cunning. Since these motifs often appear in stories that
are classified as myths as well, it is readily apparent that distinguishing myths
from folktales is a complex and perhaps impossible task.
In this Handbook of Native American Mythology, we have not attempted
to make any distinction between myth and folktale, legend, or other forms of
story. We have considered as myth any story that bears the imprint of a specific
Native American culture, or of Native American cultures in general, whether it
explains the existence of some belief or natural phenomenon, tells about tribal
customs, describes the origin and establishment of rituals, instructs in proper
behavior, or simply entertains.
FUNCTIONS OF MYTH
Myth has two primary functions. The first is to provide an explanation of facts,
whether natural or cultural. Mythology evolved as peoples sought to answer
questions about their world: Who was the first man? How was fire acquired?
Where did the salt we use every day come from? A myth of the Wyandot
(Huron) of the Great Lakes region, for example, tells of the origin of tobacco: a
dead girl’s father discovers an injured hawk that bursts into flames as he ap
proaches it. All that remains is a flaming coal, in which he sees his daughter’s
face. She tells her father of a precious gift she has for her people, a gift of to
bacco seed, and stays to show him how to raise and harvest this new crop. In
addition to providing an explanation, the narrative form and imaginative quali
ties of a myth such as this lend credibility to the explanation and transforms it
into something memorable and lasting.
The second primary function of myth is to justify, validate, or explain the
existence of a social system and traditional rites and customs. In Potawatomi
origin stories from the Northeast, for example, the culture hero Wiske creates
the Potawatomi clans and gives them medicine bundles. Each clan has a bundle
that is associated with specific rights and obligations. The Man clan has rules
for ritual use of its bundle before going to war. Members of the Fish clan renew



their medicine four times a year. The Siksika (Blackfeet) hold a sacred Sun
Dance each summer, a ceremony of thanks for the Creator’s blessing, to com
memorate and honor a gesture of the Sun told in a story about Star Boy. Star
Boy and his mother are cast down from the Sky World because of her disobedi
ence. He is marked with a mysterious scar and becomes known as Scarface. In
order to marry, he makes a journey to the Sun and gains the Sun’s forgiveness
for his mother’s transgression. The Sun removes the scar and Star Boy returns
to earth, his bride, and his people with the sacred knowledge of the Sun Dance.
After death, he is taken back to the Sky World.
Myth also has secondary functions. Myths are important as a vehicle for in
struction. Those that portray, for example, the origin or end of the world, the
land of the dead, or paradise, describe what people are unable to understand and
experience for themselves. Myths often comprise the most important model for
teaching and learning in traditional, preindustrial societies, since a formal and
separate system of law or philosophical inquiry does not exist. They illustrate
noble conduct by example and demonstrate bad conduct by showcasing its ill
consequences.
Myths also function as sources of healing, renewal, and inspiration.
Recitation of creation myths plays a significant role in healing the sick among
the Navajo. Icelandic poets are said to be celebrating the origins of their art and
therefore renewing it when they sing of the Norse god Odin winning the “mead
of song” (a drink containing the power of poetic inspiration) for both gods and
men. Myths have inspired and influenced self-expression in archaic and modern
societies alike. Mythical themes and images from classical Greek and Roman
mythology are widely prevalent, for example, in Western art and literature.
Ruling families and elites of ancient civilizations and societies worldwide
frequently based their claims to position, power, and privilege on mythological
origins. Known examples come from Ancient Greece, pharaonic Egypt, Imperial
China, West Africa, India, Polynesia, and the empires of the Hittites and Incas.
Justification of marriage and funerary customs from every known cultural tradi
tion, including those of Native Americans, is grounded in mythology.
TYPES OF MYTH
Myths come in a wide variety of categories. There are creation or origin myths,
myths of death and destruction, and myths about culture heroes. Some myths
focus on nature, time and eternity, providence and destiny, memory and forget
fulness, or birth and renewal. Some feature high beings or celestial gods,
founders of religion or religious figures, or kings and ascetics. Myths can hold
Introduction 3



special meaning for just one person or for many. Families have their own
myths, as do schools, organizations, associations, institutions, neighborhoods,
cities, regions, and countries. Myths often reflect the worldviews of various so
cial classes.
Kirk proposes three main categories of myths (1970, 252–261). His first cat
egory includes mythical narratives told solely for entertainment. Some may
challenge the validity of this category, as myths that fall into it are rare—or
these stories might more plausibly be classified as folktales or legends. His sec
ond category includes operative, iterative, or validatory myths that are thought
to have the power to change the world, and “tend to be repeated regularly on
ritual or ceremonial occasions . . . to bring about a desirable continuity in na
ture or society” (1970, 254–255). The stories are meant to do something as
much as say something—to cure illness, to ensure that a king’s power contin
ues, to prepare for hunts, to bring rain, to move one along through the cycle of
life. Within this second category falls the model or charter myths that validate,
record, and provide authority for a people’s customs and institutions. Kirk’s
third category includes explanatory or speculative myths. These may simply ex
plain the origin of a natural feature, animal, or object (etiological myths), or
they may be complex stories that attempt to provide answers to questions that
perplex humanity, such as why natural disasters occur or people die. Some
myths appear to recognize that some of these difficult questions may not have
answers. Instead, they provide the strength, ability, and will to face the myster
ies, contradictions, and sorrows of life. All of these categories of myths are rep
resented in the mythology of Native Americans. Before exploring this mythol
ogy, it is useful to consider the geography and climate of North America,
excluding the area south of northern Mexico, because associations between ge
ography, climate, and Native American myths are strong.
GEOGRAPHY AND CLIMATE OF NORTH AMERICA
The vast North American continent, shaped roughly like an inverted triangle,
extends from the permanent Arctic ice cap to the subtropical areas of Florida
and California. A highland zone in the east includes the ancient Appalachian
Mountains and a low, rocky plateau of Precambrian rock known as the
Canadian Shield. Also in Canada are the Laurentian Highlands in Quebec, and
the Torngat Mountains in northern Labrador. This entire zone is called the
Eastern Highlands. In the west, much younger, more rugged mountain chains
run north to south in a complex zone interspersed with plateaus and hills.
Known as the Western Highlands, this area includes a double range of moun

tains along the coast, the Sierra Nevada and the Cascades farther inland, and
the Rocky Mountains farther east. Within this area is a huge dry valley in Utah
and the surrounding region. Between these two major mountainous areas of the
east and west lies the high plains, a vast region of prairie, and a tremendous area
of low plains running almost continuously from the Arctic Ocean to the Gulf of
Mexico, including the river basins of the Mississippi and Missouri. This is the
Interior Plain. During the last ice age, the plains of the north were scoured out,
producing a region where low sandy hills have dammed up the waterways to
produce the Hudson Bay and the Great Lakes. Within this immense area, few
natural barriers existed that would impede migration.
The climates of North America are as extraordinarily diverse as its geogra
phy. Ranging from tropical in the southernmost part of Florida to polar in the
Canadian Archipelago and Greenland, certain well-defined climactic types are
recognizable, except in the high mountain areas, where climactic distribution is
spotty and conditions vary by site and exposure to sun and wind. Some climactic
belts run east and west but are not continuous from coast to coast because they
are broken by variations in elevation, particularly in the western and southwest
ern United States. Moving northward and northeastward from the southwestern
United States, temperatures are lower in both summer and winter. Along the en
tire West Coast, the ocean has a moderating effect on temperature and winters
are mild. The East Coast is less affected by ocean currents.
Adjacent to the mountains in the west is a vast interior area of arid and
semi-arid climate. Starting on the west coast just south of Los Angeles, it can be
followed inland and northward along the eastern face of the Sierra Nevada and
Cascade mountain ranges. It continues around the central Rockies and north
into southern Alberta in Canada. It then leaves the Rockies and swings east and
south in an arc across the Great Plains into southern Texas. Within this dry
belt, temperatures fluctuate markedly, both daily and seasonally.
East of the Rockies, climactic belts stretch farther without interruption.
The southern tip of Florida has a truly tropical climate, with ample rainfall,
hot, humid weather, and virtually no true winter. Moving northward from
Florida to approximately the line of the Ohio and Missouri rivers, running from
the Atlantic coast to the Great Plains, is a subtropical climate with mild, hu
mid winters and hot, humid summers. Even farther north, extending almost to
the shores of the Arctic, lies a belt of extreme climate where summers are hot
and humid and winters are cold, humid, and severe. The severity of the winters
gradually increases and summers are less warm and less humid as one moves
farther and farther to the north. Through central Alaska and Canada north of
the St. Lawrence–Great Lakes line, summers are short and winters long and ex
cessively cold. Offsetting the shorter summers are long daylight hours, while
Introduction 5



extensive hours of darkness compound the severity of winter. Along the Arctic
Coast and over to the Canadian Archipelago and Greenland, there is no true
summer season. Average temperatures during the warmest months barely rise
above freezing over a majority of the area, and snow and ice cover is permanent
over most of Ellesmere Island and the interior of Greenland.
Precipitation on the continent varies tremendously, from a high of 96 to
128 inches on the northwest coast to a low of 0 to 16 inches in the desert areas
of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Throughout the dry
belt of the interior, rains are infrequent and unreliable. Moving eastward on the
Great Plains, moisture becomes gradually more plentiful and reliable.
Generally, moving inland away from the coastal areas, rainfall decreases and be
comes less frequent. As with rain, snowfall within the northernmost climactic
belts is heavier on the coasts and tends to be lighter in the interior.
THE FIRST NATIVE AMERICANS
According to scholars, archaeological evidence suggests that the earliest ances
tors of the Native Americans, referred to as “Paleo-Indians,” were nomadic
hunters from Asia who migrated to the continent probably during the last
glacial period (Wisconsin) some 20,000 to 35,000 years ago.2 Some have asserted
that the first arrivals came even earlier, perhaps as early as 60,000 years ago. It
is believed that they crossed the Bering Strait land bridge between Siberia and
what is now Alaska, which was then exposed by a drop in sea level, in pursuit
of the large game animals on which their livelihood depended.3 Latter arrivals,
including the Aleut, Athabascan, and Inuit peoples, no doubt followed the same
route, probably crossing by boat or on winter ice after the land bridge sank once
again under water, about 8000 B.C.E. These newcomers shared certain ancient
cultural traits with their Eurasian and African contemporaries, including the
use of fire, the domesticated dog, various types of stone implements, cordage,
netting, and basketry, and particular rites and healing beliefs.
Early Paleo-Indians were hunters and gatherers whose cultures predate the
adoption of horticulture and the bow and arrow. In response to climactic changes
and population pressures that impacted their plant and animal food sources,
these wandering hunters and their descendants eventually settled throughout
the Americas, adapting to new ecological conditions and developing a variety of
indigenous cultures over a period of seven or eight thousand years. Groups that
lived in areas where a variety of game was plentiful became hunters almost ex
clusively. Those who lived near rivers, lakes, and the ocean learned to fish. Still
others, who lived in areas where rainfall was sparse and animals and fish were
Handbook of Native American Mythology
6



relatively scarce, largely became gatherers and foragers, living off whatever
plants and animals the land provided. And some survived chiefly by acting as
middlemen in the trade that flourished over distances short and long between
people exchanging surplus raw materials and handicrafts for necessary items
that were lacking or in short supply in their own areas. New weapons were in
vented and new hunting techniques evolved, and people devised new tools,
dwellings, clothing, and craft for water travel. Sometime around 1500 B.C.E.,
some native groups expanded their food supply by adopting horticulture in
places where there was good soil and ample water resources, leading to a more
sedentary life in villages that were larger and more permanent.
Scholars refer to the later native peoples who led a life that was more com
plex and locally focused as “Archaic Indians” to distinguish them from their
“Paleo-Indian” ancestors. As they proliferated and learned to exploit their envi
ronment, they became more distinctive culturally, developing specific lan
guages, oral traditions, rituals, customs, and strategies for survival. This process
of cultural differentiation occurred most rapidly and profoundly among the na
tive peoples of the Pacific Northwest and northern California, an area rich in
both resources and micro-environments.
By the time of first contact with the Europeans at the end of the fifteenth
century, a mosaic of Native American cultures had existed in all parts of the
North American continent for thousands of years, and native population pat
terns were well established. Though archaeological evidence suggests that
much of the Americas was densely settled by 1492, it is difficult for scholars to
arrive at accurate estimates of the aboriginal population then. Information is
scant, as natives lacked statistical records and their first conquerors rarely kept
any. Data on which estimates are based were gathered by traders, missionaries,
explorers, and others, and that information is only as valuable as their observa
tions were reliable. A significant complication is that by the time this data was
collected, some of the native populations had already been sharply reduced by
European diseases. Estimates for the pre-Columbian populations of the
Americas have ranged from a low of about 10 million to a high of 100 million or
more.4 Following European contact it is certain, however, that Native American
populations suffered rapid and steady decline. Only in the twentieth century
did their numbers begin to increase, partly in response to a decrease in infant
mortality.
Native Americans once spoke a variety of languages. It is difficult to deter
mine an exact number, since many became extinct following contact between
Natives and Europeans.5 Native American languages as a whole do not com
prise a group of languages that are linked historically (as Indo-European lan
guages are, for example). Furthermore, while different theories have been
Introduction 7



advanced, none has acceptably demonstrated a relationship between Native
American languages and any language group in the Old World. The only possi
ble exception is a proposed link between the Eskimo-Aleut family and some
languages of nearby Siberia (Champagne 2001, 448–449). Therefore, it appears
that the ancestors of Native Americans migrated so long ago that any relation
ship that did exist was lost via linguistic change.
European conquest and colonization ultimately led to the extinction of
many Native American language groups and greatly impacted those that did
survive. Though more than 100 native languages may still be spoken in North
America, one-third of the aboriginal languages north of Mexico have disap
peared entirely, and most of the surviving languages are slowly dying out. Those
that continue to flourish include Cherokee, spoken in Oklahoma and North
Carolina; the Assiniboine dialect of the Dakota language in the northern por
tions of the Midwest; Navajo in New Mexico and Arizona; and Ojibwa in the
northern United States and southern Canada. Among these groups, however, a
high proportion of speakers are bilingual.
MAJOR CULTURE AREAS OF NATIVE AMERICA
For the purposes of organizing just about any subject related to Native
Americans, American anthropologists have grouped tribes into about ten cul
ture areas based on locations that largely reflect geographic or environmental
differences. The exact number depends on what system is used; the
Smithsonian Institution’s Handbook of North American Indians, a comprehen
sive, multivolume work that began publication in 1978, recognizes the follow
ing: Arctic, Subarctic, Northwest Coast, California, Southwest, Great Basin,
Plateau, Plains, Southeast, and Northeast.6 Each area is thought to have its own
distinctive style or styles of culture. To provide a context for appreciating the
wide variety of myths and stories told in the various regions of the North
American continent, we will consider each culture area in turn.
Arctic
In North America, the Arctic culture area extends from southern Alaska and
around the northern rim of the continent to eastern Greenland. In the west, it
extends into northeast Siberia, making it the longest continuous stretch of ter
rain occupied by a single common culture and language group anywhere in the
world. Bordered by crashing seas and quiet bays, the Arctic is a vast desert of

cold ice, treeless tundra, and rocky islands and beaches. The population of the
Arctic has always been relatively small, as this land is a difficult one, though
with a stark and fantastic beauty of its own. One of two primary native groups
found here is the Inuit (“The People”), long a source of fascination to explorers
and scholars; the other is the Aleuts of the nearly 100 islands of the Aleutian
archipelago off the southwest coast of Alaska. Both groups developed a remark
able culture that enabled them to survive the conditions of the earth’s cruelest
environment.
Inuits are commonly thought to embody the characteristics of that group
living the farthest north, on Canada’s Arctic islands and along northwestern
Greenland. They retained their traditional customs longer than Inuit from other
areas, because they remained relatively uninfluenced by European culture until
the early part of the twentieth century. Here the Inuit dressed in heavy fur cloth
ing for most of the year, lived in snow igloos, hunted seals and walrus, and, aided
by their dogs, pursued polar bears across the vast ice fields. The reality, however,
Introduction 9
The “wolf dance” of the Kaviagamutes Eskimo of Alaska, ca. 1914. (Library of Congress)



is that the culture of the Inuit exhibited variations by region. In other areas, the
economy was based on hunting and fishing of various other wildlife, including
salmon, whitefish, trout, capelin, the narwhal, beluga or bowhead whales, seals,
walrus, or caribou. Of primary importance to most Inuit was the seal.
Because of the harsh and demanding world they inhabited, life for the Inuit
was always difficult, and survival a never-ending struggle. Fearing starvation,
the Inuit led a nomadic existence following the available supply of game.
Because they moved regularly, they did not evolve political structures or lead a
highly developed village life. Today, many Inuit continue to subsist by hunting
and fishing the same species they harvested in aboriginal times. But various
forms of wage labor have become increasingly common, and many Inuit have
been drawn into government service, the military or communications, or work
in trading stores, the oil fields, mines, or tourism-related occupations.
Like the Inuit, the Aleuts became experts at deriving maximum benefit
from the meager resources their forbidding environment had to offer. Their vil
lages were always located on the shore because they subsisted by gathering the
resources of the sea. Sea lions, seals, whales, sea otters, fish, shellfish, and
ocean birds were important sources of food. Inland areas were important for
eggs, roots and berries, stone for weapons, grass for weaving, and heath for fuel.
Many dwellings were partially underground to protect against the cold, damp,
foggy weather. Clothing worn by men included skirts of feathered bird skins,
while women used sea otter and fur seal skins. Aleut women were skilled sew
ers, weavers, and basket makers. The Aleuts had a system of social classes, a
system that included slaves. Because they were an island people, the Aleuts
tended to be more settled than most Inuit.
Today, the Aleuts’ traditional way of life has been almost completely aban
doned. More than a century of oppression and slavery followed the Russian ex
ploration and occupation of the Aleutian Islands in the 1700s. Brutalized and
exposed to diseases of the white man, thousands of Aleuts perished. By 1867,
when the United States purchased Alaska and assumed control of the islands,
the native population had dropped from more than 15,000 to 2,500. Today, the
small numbers of remaining Aleuts are primarily commercial fishermen.
Myths of the Arctic culture area commonly feature tricksters, shamans and
shamanic journeys, and a mistress of sea animals.
Subarctic
The Subarctic culture area covers most of Canada, except for the Northwest
Coast and the Arctic margin, and includes the interior of Alaska. It reaches south

to where the Great Plains and cultivable lands begin. Given the vast land area in
cluded in the Subarctic, the population was always relatively small. The Indians
who lived here faced a constant foe in the weather and harsh climate, as this was
a cold, wet region of tundra, forests, mountains, rivers, lakes, swamps, and other
waterlogged land. During the few weeks of summer, it rained heavily, while win
ters were long and marked by deep snows and savage temperatures. All conspired
to make travel extremely difficult except by canoe, toboggan, or snowshoes. The
Subarctic was home to various Native American peoples that can be divided into
two great language groups: the Athabascan speakers of western Canada and the
Alaskan interior (such as the Ahtena, Chipewyan, Dena’ina (Tanaina), Dogrib,
Kawchottine (Hare), Kaska, and Tsattine (Beaver), and the Algonquian speakers of
eastern Canada (including the Cree, Ojibwa, Montagnais, Naskapi, and others).
Most Native Americans who lived in the Subarctic were nomadic peoples
who hunted the vast migrating herds of caribou, from which they derived virtually
all necessities of life. Fish were important too, especially when game was scarce.
Dwellings of bent poles and tanned caribou skins were not permanent and were
designed to be easily moved. The family was the basic social unit. Subarctic tribes
lived off the land, on a bare subsistence level, which discouraged the formation of
large, interdependent groups that were not as likely to survive in a time of crisis as
small, self-sufficient ones. Others were a much less mobile forest hunting and fish
ing people, tracking smaller groups of migrating caribou and deer, moose, bear,
beaver, and other small game. Hunting and fishing were supplemented with plant
gathering. Villages were small and had no political or tribal character, as they were
typically comprised of autonomous family groups. Birchbark was a staple, used for
everything from canoes to wigwams to cooking vessels.
The decline and dissolution of the Subarctic culture was a response to a dis
ruption of the area by the fur trade in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.
Like other Indians of the continent, those living in the Subarctic had been self
sufficient, hunting and gathering food, making their own tools, and bartering
with one another. Following the establishment of the Hudson’s Bay Company,
whose primary objective was to acquire furs for the European market, trading
posts were set up in the Canadian wilderness. Here, goods such as wool blan
kets, copper pots, bolts of fabric, and muskets were offered to the Indians in ex
change for pelts. The Indians became dependent on this readymade merchan
dise and abandoned their traditional handicraft products. Hunting evolved from
a subsistence activity to a commercial one as they focused on supplying the
white traders with pelts, mostly beaver. Since beaver were most easily caught
by trapping, hunting became an individual endeavor rather than the communal
activity it was when caribou were the main target. Competition and conflict de
veloped among and even within tribal groups, and traditional domains were no
Introduction 11



longer respected. Instead of migrating in pursuit of animals, the Indians settled
near the trading posts, where women and children lived in permanent villages
while the men went away for extended periods to trap. Indians prospered as
never before—as long as the supply of beaver held out. When the beaver became
nearly extinct in the Subarctic by the beginning of the nineteenth century,
poverty was all that remained. Disease, alcoholism, and other Western influ
ences also took their toll.
The Earth Diver creation myth and myths that feature transformers and
tricksters are found in the Subarctic.
Northwest Coast
The natives who inhabited the rugged coastal terrain stretching from southern
Alaska through British Columbia and as far south as northern California be
longed to numerous cultures. Collectively called the Northwest Coast Indians,
they enjoyed a temperate but damp climate and a relatively comfortable life
amidst the bounty of the ocean and the countless rivers of the region. Important
groups were, from north to south, the Haida, Hupa, Karok, Kwakiutl, Nootka,
Salish, Tlingit, Tsimshian, and Yurok.
While these Indians depended almost entirely upon the rich supply of
salmon for their livelihood, there were also candlefish, cod, halibut, herring,
and smelts. Whales, porpoises, sea otters, sea lions, and hair seals abounded.
Clams, mussels, sea urchins, and the eggs of seabirds were theirs for the taking.
The land, too, offered riches: caribou, moose, mountain sheep and goats, deer,
and a wealth of small animals as well as roots and berries. Agriculture was not
practiced. The wood of the forest were used for constructing homes and canoes;
bark fibers and mountain-goat wool were used to make clothing and blankets.
So numerous were the available resources, and so thoroughly were they ex
ploited using highly specialized technology, that these peoples were able to
achieve a complex, sophisticated, and affluent culture with a highly stratified
social structure that was unrivaled by any other people north of Mexico.
Villages were built on the mainland shores and on the mountainous off
shore islands near the mouths of rapidly flowing rivers. While housing varied in
design from tribe to tribe, all were built of heavy wooden posts and beams in a
square or rectangular shape, with cedar planking for walls and roofs. Village
populations traditionally consisted of 100 or more related people; each person in
every village was ranked according to his or her closeness to the head leader or
chief. This strict hierarchical system only excluded an outcast or slave category
that was comprised of war captives and debtors.
Handbook of Native American Mythology
12



Individual and group wealth
was highly valued and measured by
a count of possessions such as
cedar-bark blankets, dried fish and
fish oil, dentalium shells, dugout
canoes, slaves, and carved pieces of
metal known as coppers. The inter
woven themes of rank and wealth,
so prevalent in Northwest cultures,
were dramatically expressed in an
elaborate ceremonial display of giv
ing and receiving known as the pot
latch. The host of a potlatch ac
quired rights of rank and status by
giving gifts that were evidence of
wealth, while the guests’ accep
tance of these gifts meant they ac
knowledged the validity of the
host’s claims. While the potlatch
served this same purpose among
tribal groups all along the
Northwest Coast, procedures var
ied from one group to another.
Danish explorer Vitus Bering first discovered the Northwest Coast Indians
in 1741 while sailing under the auspices of the Russian crown and seeking the
possible existence of a land bridge between the southern tip of Siberia and the
American mainland. Although fleeting, this contact resulted in discovery of the
rich, lustrous fur pelt of the sea otter in this area. The fur trade and territorial
ambitions brought at least 100 ships to the Northwest Coast between 1774 and
1794. Conflict, disease, guns, and alcohol took their rapid toll, and the tradi
tional culture and economy of the people was severely undermined.
Stories about clans and lineage, the transformer, the trickster, and the rela
tionship between hunters and animals are all part of Northwest Coast mythology.
California
The Indians of California were fortunate to live in a rich and spacious environ
ment that covered approximately the current area of the state, minus the south
east section along the Colorado River. The climate was favorable, without

extremes, and rain fell generously on the western slopes of the mountains. Food
was varied and abundant, and raw materials for shelter, clothing, tools, and
weapons were plentiful and easily obtained.
Conditions here allowed the native peoples to flourish, and the aboriginal
population was estimated at more than 300,000 people at the time of first con
tact in 1540. California was marked by a great complexity of tribal groups and
languages; some 100 tribes and bands spoke more than 200 independent di
alects. This mix suggests that the immigrant peoples who populated California
were unrelated by language, and their separation by mountain, valley, and
coastland within this vast territory fostered divergence in dialects. Prominent
groups included the Chumash, Maidu, Miwok, Modoc, Ohlone (Costano),
Patwin, Pomo, Salinan, Wintun, Yokuts, and Yuki.
Despite the great diversity among the native populations and their lan
guages, cultural patterns that developed among them exhibited more similari
ties than differences. All native Californians were primarily foragers and prac
ticed no agriculture except along the Colorado River. They relied heavily on
plant foods, including acorns, grass seeds, cattails, and others. Fish were also a
staple for almost all groups, and deer, elk, smaller game, and birds were hunted.
Clothing was typically made of hides, and dwellings were simple and made to
house a single family, the basic social unit. Basket weaving was the main form
of artistic expression. Villages were typically comprised of a small group of fam
ilies related through the male line. These villages were self-contained and not
allied with any tribal organization; common rights were extended to all within
their living space, which was defined by custom and tradition.
Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo explored California and made contact first with
the coastal natives in 1542. His ship was followed by hundreds of others whose
impact on the native inhabitants is still unclear. In the mid-eighteenth century,
Spain decided to tighten the claim it had made on California, fearing it would
be contested by the British or Russians and would therefore threaten its more
valuable empire to the south.
To achieve this objective, the Spanish established a string of missions along
the coast, the first in 1769, that would give Spain a physical presence, establish
a buttress against Protestantism and Orthodoxy by converting the Native
Americans to Roman Catholicism, and create a native labor force for future de
velopment by gradually moving the native peoples away from gathering and
hunting and convincing them to adopt a life of peasantry. The Mission Period
lasted only 65 years, but this proved to be plenty of time to effect the almost
complete demise of Indian culture in California. The diet of the native people
changed; they became susceptible to alcohol; and they surrendered their own
religion, language, and independent village life. Because the Spanish failed to

14



colonize north of San Francisco, some escaped the mission experience but later
fell prey to the effects of the gold rush that began in 1848. The tide of expan
sionism that followed ensured that the native peoples were dispossessed of their
land. By 1900 fewer than 15,000 survived, their cultural traditions largely de
stroyed.
Origin myths, animal myths, and stories of tricksters and transformers are
common in the California culture area.
Great Basin
The Great Basin, a vast expanse of desert and salt flats intersected by moun
tains, centers on the modern states of Nevada and Utah and extends into por
tions of California, Oregon, Idaho, Wyoming, and Colorado. Here the dry cli
mate was marked by extremes of seasonal heat and cold, with a widely
scattered population that for centuries had managed to wrest a living from a rig
orous and inhospitable environment. Major groups, nearly all of whom spoke
Shoshonean languages, included the Bannock, Paiute, Ute, Washo, and others.
Prior to European contact, these nomadic peoples lived primarily as for
agers and gatherers, in small bands often comprised of just a single family.
Because rainfall in the Basin was minimal, agriculture was not practiced. Since
large game animals were scarce, scattered, and difficult to stalk, hunting was
not a primary mean of acquiring food or clothing. During the summer, the na
tive peoples subsisted on wild seeds, roots, berries, pine nuts, and cactus fruits;
insects, snakes, lizards, fish, and small mammals were also eaten, along with
the occasional antelope and deer. In the winter, fish and game were scarce, and
they were forced to rely on foods that had been gathered and stored during the
summer. As the people were constantly moving in search of food, water, and
firewood, only rudimentary shelters were constructed. Made of willow poles
covered with reeds or brush, they were built whenever and wherever the people
happened to camp, and freely abandoned to the weather or the next group who
found them.
Because the independent, self-sufficient family was the principal unit of the
Basin people, social and political organization was casual. Families came to
gether with others only to form large communal bands for special events such
as certain hunts or dancing, typically during brief periods of plenty or the lean
winter months. Leadership was informal and usually exerted by respected el
ders, usually males.
During the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, some of the Great
Basin peoples acquired horses, formed bands of mounted hunters and warriors,
Introduction 15



and adopted some of the cultural characteristics of the Plains Indians. The real
catalysts for change, however, were the discovery of California gold in 1848 and
the subsequent discovery of both gold and silver in Nevada. Because native cul
tures were based on the cycles of nature and the barest margin of survival, they
quickly collapsed and disappeared as prospectors and settlers freely dispossessed
the peoples of their lives and land.
Many trickster and heroine myths are found in the mythologies of the
Great Basin.
Plateau
The Interior-Plateau culture area of the Columbia and Fraser River basins was
home to numerous small tribes of peaceful, foraging village dwellers that in
cluded such well-known groups as the Kootenai, Nez Perce, Ntlakyapamuk
(Thompson), Okanagan, Salish (Flathead), Shuswap, Skitswish (Coeur d’Alene),
Spokane, and Yakama. Culturally, they were similar to their neighbors from the
Northwest Coast, Great Basin, and California areas, and, like most other Native
Americans, structured their lives around the seasons and the availability of lo

cal foods. Languages spoken included numerous dialects of the Algonquian,
Athabascan, Salish, and Shahaptian linguistic families.
The boundaries of this high, varied land of well-watered grasslands, dense
forests, and snow-covered mountains were the Rocky Mountains on the east
and the Cascade Range on the west, the upper Fraser River on the north, and a
line running through modern-day Oregon and Idaho on the south. Also included
in this region was part of British Columbia, a section of western Montana, a
wedge of Wyoming, and central and eastern Washington.
The Columbia, the Fraser, and their tributaries were the lifeblood of this
landlocked region. Numerous small villages were located on their hospitable
banks; travel and trade flourished, and were inevitably accompanied by cultural
interchanges. In the early eighteenth century, some 200 years after its introduc
tion by the Spanish, the horse came to the Plateau from the Plains and Great
Basin. Its economic value was soon recognized, and the Plateau peoples, acting
as middlemen, facilitated a thriving exchange of slaves and horses that emerged
between slaveholding tribes of the Northwest Coast and the Plains. The Plateau
tribes also became participants in the great bison hunts.
Most Plateau peoples spent the winters in circular log homes built partly
underground. Summer dwellings were made of bullrush mats layered over

frames of cottonwood. They relied on the salmon, sturgeon, and trout caught
from the many fast-running rivers and streams as a major source of food. Since
the climate was cold enough to inhibit the development of agriculture, wild
roots, berries, and nuts were gathered. Another very important food was the
starchy bulb of the camas, a type of lily. Wild game hunted included rabbits,
deer, elk, and mountain sheep. Like their Great Basin and California neighbors,
the Plateau tribes had a decentralized political structure and casual sense of
community. Exceptions were the Nez Perces and Skitswish (Coeur d’Alene),
who adopted a more structured tribal organization from the Siksika (Blackfeet)
of the Plains.
White expansion eventually destroyed the traditional way of life on the
Plateau as it did for tribes living in other culture areas. American seafarer
Robert Gray sailed up the Columbia River in 1792, and members of the Lewis
and Clark Expedition spent time with all the major tribes of the Plateau, break
ing ground for fur traders and trappers who came to the area later. Although
trade between the whites and native peoples in the years immediately following
Lewis and Clark’s landmark journey fostered a mutually beneficial relationship,
it also brought exposure to disease. Later, the arrival of missionaries and tens of
thousands of pioneers introduced bloody, intermittent conflict and loss of life
and land. By 1878, the last of the Plateau tribes had been forced to relocate to
reservations.
Many transformer and trickster myths are found in the Great Basin.
The Plains
The vast, almost unbroken swath of grassland known as the Great Plains, once
sparsely or intermittently inhabited except for great herds of buffalo, extends
from northern Alberta and Saskatchewan south to the Gulf of Mexico. East to
west, it runs from the foothills of the Rocky Mountains to the Mississippi
River. The Plains was once home to about three dozen or more tribes, many of
whom became the hard-riding warriors and hunters of legend after they ac
quired horses in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. They included the
Arapaho, Cheyenne, Comanche, Crow, Dakota (Sioux), Hidatsa, Kiowa,
Mandan, Osage, Pawnee, Siksika (Blackfeet), and Wichita.
Few, if any, of these peoples could trace their ancestry within the region
back more than several hundred years. The original inhabitants of the Plains
were small numbers of nomadic peoples who eked out a living forging its river
bottoms and hunting buffalo on foot. By about 1000 C.E., some of the peoples
were acquainted with the rudiments of farming and were able to raise crops to

18



supplement their diet of buffalo meat and wild plants. But many of them were
forced into other territories because of successive drought, and the population
did not show a marked increase until a great drift onto the Plains began around
1300 C.E. The region became a melting pot as drought elsewhere and increasing
population pressure in the Woodlands caused tribes to converge from all four di
rections. Later, the coming of European settlers to the east forced native peoples
westward as their lands were taken.
Most tribes who came to the Plains had been semi-sedentary villagers who
lived as farmers and gatherers. By 1700, however, the horse was available
throughout the Plains, and the native people rapidly became peerless riders,
trainers, and breeders, enabling them to adopt a nomadic lifestyle organized
around the buffalo hunt. In fact, the buffalo became the focus of Plains Indian
culture, the center of their social life and daily routine. Its flesh provided them
with food, its hides with clothing and shelter. Bones and horns were used to
Introduction 19
Dakota Indians, Pine Ridge, South Dakota, 1910. (Library of Congress)



make tools; sinews, thread and string. Many Plains myths and legends naturally
related to the buffalo.
Tribes spent the winter in conical earth lodges near the rivers; during the
summer, encampments consisting of portable teepees were established for in
tensive, large-scale bison hunting. Here, people united in supplication to the
Great Spirit through celebration of public ceremonials and rituals such as the
Sun Dance, which, in some tribes, were accompanied by acts of self-mutilation
and feats of deprivation or endurance.
Government among the Plains tribes was not hereditary, elected, or struc
tured. Related bands were organized into tribes, each governed by a chief upon
whom the title was often bestowed as an honorific because of the individual’s
wisdom or bravery. The chief was assisted by a council of elders. Social systems
among the Plains Indians were highly developed; some tribes had clans, but
most had warrior societies. Rank was derived through ownership of large num
bers of horses, success in raids, war honors against enemies, or spiritual power
obtained through visions sought as part of rituals and ceremonies.
Plains culture in its full flower was spectacular, made possible by the
European’s horse. However, after little more than a century, Europeans sealed
the fate of both the Plains culture and the bison. English and French trappers,
traders, and the Lewis and Clark Expedition generated a flood of interest in the
economic potential of the West. The trappings of white civilization that soon
arrived had insidious effects on Indian culture, as convenience goods like
knives, blankets, and kettles undermined self-sufficiency and led to depen
dence. The availability of guns upset the balance of power among tribes. Worst
of all, the traders brought diseases such as measles, diphtheria, and smallpox, to
which the Indians had no resistance.
By 1840, the demand for beaver pelts, the beavers themselves, and the trap
pers and traders were gone. Next came the forty-niners on their way to
California, and settlers moving to Oregon territory. Many chose to remain on
the Plains when they discovered the area’s rich black soil and gold was discov
ered in Colorado. Following the Civil War, the transcontinental railroads
brought the potential for millions to settle the region. After 1850, the history of
relations between whites and Indians on the Plains was marked by an endless
succession of broken treaties and fierce, bloody conflicts. By 1880, the gradual
but steady depletion of buffalo herds by white sport and commercial hunters re
duced the Indians to penury, and they were forced to settle on reservations es
tablished by the federal government.
Many types of creation stories are part of Plains mythology. Culture hero
tales, trickster stories, and myths that feature mediators between gods and hu
mans are also common.

Southwest
The Southwest culture area comprises present-day Arizona and New Mexico,
parts of Utah, Colorado, Texas, and northwest Mexico. While rivers, rain, and
oases make life possible in this hot, arid region of desert and mountains, the
availability of water fluctuates and is always a concern. At different times, the
territory has been home to a variety of both hunter gatherers and agricultural
peoples. Included among the former are the Apache, Havasupai, Hualapai
(Walapai), Seri, and Yavapai. The Mohave, Navajo, Pima, Pueblo peoples (in
cluding the Hopi and Zuni), Tohono O’Odham (Papago), Yaqui, and Yuma are
some of the latter. The Southwest is home to some of the best-preserved archae
ological remains in the United States, evidence that suggests this area has been
inhabited for at least 6,000 years.
The early occupiers of the region, the hunter-gatherers, depended on wild
food, both plant and animal, such as saguaro cactus fruit, yucca, prickly pear,
mesquite pods, antelope, rodents, fish, rabbits, and deer. To supplement their
diet, they began to cultivate some varieties of maize and squash by about 1500
B.C.E., a practice likely introduced from Mesoamerica. Eventually, they devel
oped strains of maize better suited to growing in a more northern climate, and
cultivation of maize and other crops started to spread. Because farming in the
Southwest was labor-intensive, requiring irrigation and flood control, the peo
ples gradually transformed into increasingly sophisticated, sedentary village
dwelling farmers with a diet centered on maize, beans, and squash.
Two similar, complex cultures that emerged in the Southwest between
about C.E. 300 and 1100 were the Hohokam and the Anasazi, comprised of vari
ous linguistic groups and many independent communities. Both groups con
structed large stone and adobe towns (later called pueblos by the Spanish) di
rected by a hierarchy of men with combined roles of chief and priest. Both also
built and maintained elaborate irrigation systems to water their crops.
The Hohokam, probable ancestors of the Pima and Tohono O’Odham, and
the Anasazi, ancestors of the Acoma, Hopi, and Zuni, were both influenced by
the culture of central Mexico. Both groups traded with peoples in the region and
learned from them how to cultivate food crops and cotton and weave cloth. Ball
courts and platform temple mounds could be found within the largest
Hohokam villages.
During the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, the Hohokam and Anasazi expe
rienced a decline that was likely triggered by a series of severe crises. An exces
sive reliance on corn resulted in depletion of the soil. As yields declined, overpop
ulation also became a problem. A prolonged period of drought exacerbated the
problem, eventually leading to crop failure, malnutrition, and violent clashes.
Introduction 21



The Hohokam abandoned their villages and reverted to a nomadic lifestyle of
hunting and gathering; most of the Anasazi moved south and east into impressive
new pueblos in locales where more water and new soil were available. The oral
traditions of the Acoma, Hopi, Pueblo, and Zuni all reflect the fact they left their
earlier homes because of disease, drought, famine, and violence.
Archaeologists believe the Apache and Navajo migrated to their present
Southwest homeland later, possibly around the thirteenth century. Speakers of
Athabascan languages closely related to those found in the Subarctic, from
where they probably came, they initially roamed the mountains in search of
food, occasionally raiding their Pueblo neighbors. While the Apache largely re
mained hunter-gatherers, the Navajo eventually borrowed heavily from the
Pueblo Indians, particularly in the areas of agriculture, arts, and weaving.
The first Spanish explorers arrived in the Southwest in the early sixteenth
century, lured by rumors of the existence of rich cities and the potential to save
new souls. Though they found no treasure, they did make contact with the na
tive peoples, inspiring successive ventures favored by missionaries seeking new
converts and a government in search of land, labor, subjects, and taxpayers.
From the moment the missionaries arrived, conflict was inevitable, since
the people were not prepared to abandon their religion. The Spaniards treated
the people with contempt, hostility, and brutality. While individual pueblos did
rebel, uprisings were always crushed. In 1680, the year of the Pueblo
Revolution, the pueblos united in a well-coordinated rebellion and routed the
Spanish, who retreated southward to El Paso, only to return to the pueblos of
the Zuni and the Rio Grande twelve years later. Following another Pueblo re
bellion, the peoples of the Southwest and the Spaniards eventually compro
mised and were able to coexist.
Following the outbreak of the war with Mexico and the annexation of
present-day New Mexico and Arizona to the United States in 1846, other white
settlers eventually flocked to the area. Like the native peoples of other culture
areas, those of the Southwest were eventually forced to live on reservations.
The emergence myth is the most prominent myth of cultures in the
Southwest. Migration legends and the monster-ridding cycle are also important.
Southeast
The Southeast, a land of relatively mild winters and abundant rainfall, stretches
eastward from the lower Mississippi River to the Atlantic, northward to the
colder regions of the Mississippi and Ohio Valleys, and southward from Virginia
and Kentucky to the Gulf of Mexico. Its modern political divisions include

southern and eastern Arkansas, part of eastern Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi,
Alabama, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, western North Carolina, Tennessee,
and those areas of Missouri, Illinois, and Kentucky that border the Mississippi
River. In this area of diverse topography and fertile soil, plant and animal life
were abundant before the arrival of Europeans; forests were filled with game,
fruits, grasses, and wild nuts, and the rivers teemed with fish. Prominent
Native American groups included the Alabama, Caddo, Cherokee, Chickasaw,
Choctaw, Creek, Natchez, Seminole, and Tunica.
Early explorers who penetrated the Southeast found a Native society that
was one of the most advanced north of Mesoamerica, by which it was strongly
influenced. The Southeastern Indians were accomplished builders and skilled
craftsmen, farmers, fishermen, and hunters who were knowledgeable in the use
of herbs and medicines as well as conservation of natural resources. Some of the
peoples were emerging from the long decline of the once prosperous and sophis
ticated Mississippian culture (ca. 700 to 1200 C.E.), known for its large and com
plex ceremonial mounds, which served as homes, tombs and temples, and for
its cultivated fields of maize, beans, and squash. Though the earthen mounds
were gradually passing into disuse, life was still village-based.

Most villages were governed by a council of warriors and elders, presided
over by a chief. They were generally laid out around a central plaza of beaten
earth, with separate buildings, public and private, on different sides. On the
margin of the plaza sat a conical winter council house where tribal leaders held
their discussions. Winter houses were constructed of cane withes and clay, with
thatched roofs. During the warmer months, families moved to adjoining rectan
gular summer houses raised on posts for better ventilation. Because they were
often at war and raids were frequent, many larger settlements were enclosed by
palisades as high as sixteen feet.
The surrounding forest was used for hunting and gathering. Women culti
vated maize, beans, squash, and pumpkins, while the men ventured dozens and
sometimes hundreds of miles in pursuit of game. When crop yields were small,
the villages dispersed and subsisted by gathering roots, berries, and nuts to sup
plement their game harvest.
Although they were divided into a large number of groups and spoke a wide
variety of languages, the Indians of the Southeast shared a complex set of beliefs
about both themselves and the natural and supernatural worlds, beliefs intercon
nected with farming and hunting. Their most important ritual was the Green
Corn Ceremony, an elaborate festival of thanksgiving and renewal that coincided
with the ripening of the autumn crop. They also followed a matrilineal clan sys
tem in which all blood relationships were determined by descent from the
mother. All forbade marriage between a man and woman of the same clan.
Early contact with Europeans resulted in disaster for the Native peoples, as
their lives began to shatter almost immediately. Many who were not killed or
enslaved fell victim to various diseases. The exchange of furs and skins for man
ufactured goods had a destructive impact on both Native cultural patterns and
the environment. As Spain, France, and Britain struggled for control of the re
gion, the Indians became enmeshed in their battles, and eventually their land
was coveted by white settlers. Nearly all who survived the period of exploration
and colonization were forcibly removed from the Southeast by the United
States government and sent west to present-day Oklahoma.
Mythology of the Southeast culture area includes many hero and trickster
tales, and stories that feature a council of animals.
Northeast
The Northeast, a region of varied climate and environments, is a vast expanse
of land stretching east to west from the Atlantic coast to the Mississippi River,
bordered on the north by southern Canada and on the south by present-day
Handbook of Native American Mythology
24



Tennessee. Here, diverse Indian cultures flourished in the fertile woodlands and
prairies and sustained themselves through hunting, gathering, fishing, and agri
culture. These cultures are classified into two principal divisions: Iroquoian
speakers, including the Cayuga, Erie, Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Seneca,
Tuscarora, and Wyandot (Huron); and Algonquian speakers, including the
Delaware, Fox, Kickapoo, Menominee, Miami, Ottawa, Pequot, Sauk, Shawnee,
and Wampanoag.
The Native peoples of the Northeast, like some of their neighbors to the
south, were descended from ancient mound-building cultures. These cultures,
the Hopewell (ca. 100 B.C.E. to C.E. 350) and Adena (ca. 500 B.C.E. to C.E. 200),
both left behind vast earthworks that enclosed domed or cone-shaped burial
mounds. Both peoples lived in villages, and corn was a staple of their diet. The
Hopewells were skilled craftsmen and artists, and had a well-organized society
led by an elite upper class.
By the early 1500s, cultures of the Northeastern peoples were based largely
on hunting, because cold weather limited horticulture to the region’s more tem
perate areas. The Iroquoian-speaking tribes resided in fortified villages orga
nized by matrilineal clans and lineage groups, each governed by a council.
Politically sophisticated, the Iroquois were intensely committed to warfare and
raids and terrified the Algonquians and dissident Iroquois who remained out
side of the powerful Iroquois League that formed during the sixteenth century.
The Iroquois resided along the Saint Lawrence River in present-day upstate
New York and along the lower Great Lakes and were subject to territorial dis
putes with their Algonquian neighbors.
The Algonquian-speaking peoples, who predominated in both number and
territorial domination, occupied coastal regions in present-day New England
and south to the mid-Atlantic. Most lived in small, semi-sedentary villages and
subsisted by hunting, fishing, and cultivating corn, beans, pumpkins, and other

vegetables. Because foraging along coastal areas was usually excellent, horticul
ture there was not as developed.
From about 1497 onward, the tribal peoples of the Northeast were in almost
constant contact with Europeans. Native land struggles were intensified by
European colonization, and by the 1700s, the pressure forced many Algonquian
nations to migrate farther west to the Great Lakes, where they competed with
other Natives for resources and eventually displaced some of them. Indian na
tions of the Northeast resisted European domination and employed various po
litical and military strategies to impede their encroachment, such as organized
alliances. Step by step, however, their lands were taken away. Some groups were
removed to Oklahoma and other areas west; others were sent to reservations
within their traditional homelands, where their descendants live today.
Trickster stories, clan myths, and the culture hero cycle are important in
the Northeast.
EMERGING PATTERNS
When these ten culture areas are considered as a whole, a pattern of distribu
tion of myths emerges, and what distinguishes them from place to place is the
combination of motifs and elements.7 For example, trickster stories are com
mon to both the Northwest coast and the Northeast. A trickster mink known
for his sexual escapades and multiple marriages is found in cultures of the for
mer. In those of the latter, the trickster is a rabbit who prolongs the life of vari
ous animals by teaching them how to deceive and fool their enemies. In emer
gence myths of the Southwest, the existence of the present population is
explained by the emergence of inhabitants of one or more worlds from below
the surface of the earth; in the Choctaw emergence myth of the Southeast, peo
ples emerged from the underworld at Nanih Waiya, a well-known mound near
Philadelphia, Mississippi. Myths from across the continent tell of various con
tests between the local fauna.
SOURCES OF NATIVE AMERICAN MYTHOLOGY
Judging from the volume of available documents, Stith Thompson’s statement
that “outside of Western civilization, few ethnic groups have been studied as
much as the Indians of North America” (1979, 297) was absolutely valid. Stories
of native mythmakers have been recorded since the first European contacts, col
lected and published extensively during the late nineteenth to early twentieth
Handbook of Native American Mythology
26



century, and reissued at an accelerated rate during recent years as interest in
multiculturalism has emerged. New versions of myths narrated by today’s story
tellers have become available, and various tribal governments are collecting and
publishing their own oral traditions, primarily for use in their classrooms.
The study of Native American mythology is an extremely ambitious project,
not only in light of the accessible material, but also because its themes are nu
merous and extremely diverse. The myths and stories belong to the many indige
nous peoples, peoples whose language, culture, and history are different and in
some cases totally unrelated. Those myths and stories, which reflect their vari
ous cultures and experiences, developed and evolved over time and as the Native
peoples were impacted by the cultures of newcomers to the North American
continent, particularly Europeans. Despite language differences, oral traditions
passed freely from one culture to another; facilitated by trade and proximity, this
exchange helped further shape both mythologies. Even today, versions of tradi
tional myths are retold and re-worked to reflect current conditions.
In any study of mythology, we must remember that a myth reflects the cul
ture, values, experience, and perspective of the person who tells it, so we are au
tomatically distanced from the myth itself and its meaning. The anthologies in
which myths and stories appear often lack sufficient background material to
place them in cultural context for the reader. Native American myths were
recorded by non-Natives and translated into English; because the translation
process involves some interpretation, it does not result in a perfect replica of
the original source. It is therefore difficult, if not impossible, for a non-Native
to gain a full and complete understanding of Native American mythology. Even
so, all humans create myths and stories from our need to interpret and explain
our world, our history, and who we are. We should want to develop an aware
ness of and appreciation for Native American mythology, no matter how diffi
cult the process, no matter how limited our understanding, as part of our North
American and human experience.
Our sources for published Native American myths are the mythmakers
themselves, whose stories have been collected largely by various scholars, includ
ing anthropologists, historians, and linguists. Interested lay people and Native
Americans themselves have also assembled collections. The first Europeans to
record these myths were the Jesuit missionaries of New France, many of whom
were accomplished linguists who studied and wrote down tribal languages. They
collected some myths east of the Great Lakes and documented them beginning in
1633 in The Jesuit Relations, annual reports and narratives sent to their superiors
in France.8 Henry Rowe Schoolcraft, explorer, Indian agent, and spouse of a half
Ojibwa daughter of a fur trader, is credited with initiating the modern apprecia
tion for the study of Indian myth and the documentation of entire bodies of
Introduction 27



Native American mythology.9 Other important collectors who followed include
artist George Caitlin, who studied the myths and rituals of the Woodland tribes in
the 1830s, including the now vanished Mandan; noted anthropologist James
Mooney, who studied myths of the Cherokee at the turn of the century; and his
contemporary Franz Boas, one of the pioneers of modern cultural anthropology. It
was Boas who categorized Native American myths and noted common traditions
they revealed, laying the foundation for Stith Thompson’s development of the
complex motif index of traditional narratives found in his Tales of the North
American Indians (1929). Others of the many important contributors to our
knowledge of Native American mythologies include Ruth Benedict, Natalie
Curtis, Frank Hamilton Cushing, George Dorsey, Richard Erdoes, George Bird
Grinnell, Claude Lévi-Strauss, Alice Marriott, Alfonso Ortiz, Elsie Clews Parsons,
Paul Radin, Lewis Spence, and Ruth Underhill. Some noted Native myth collec
tors include William Beynon and Henry Tate for the Tsimshian, George Hunt for
the Kwakiutl, Mourning Dove for the Okanagan, Clara Pearson for the
Tillamook, and Ella Deloria for the Dakota (Sioux).
The collection and translation of Native American texts reached its height be
tween 1887 and 1934, as scholars scrambled to record these texts before the people
and their mythological heritage vanished. As Bierhorst (2002, 2) noted, this time

period, when Indian mythology was at its
most vulnerable, is framed by the pas
sage of General Allotment Act and the
Indian Reorganization Act, the former a
means of dismantling Indian communi
ties, the latter an attempt to restore
them, in many cases belatedly. While
much was preserved, we can only guess
at the number of stories that were lost
forever with the demise of languages and
cultures following European contact,
conquest, and colonization.
Early significant publications of
Native American oral literatures, some
in their native languages, appeared in
government documents and volumes is
sued by professional societies. After an
thropology was organized as a discipline
and became part of the curricula in
higher education, they were published
in academic journals and monographic
series of colleges and universities, in
whose library collections they reside.10
Native American mythology that was
preserved was, initially, at least, largely
inaccessible to the reading public.
Fortunately, both Native Americans and
scholars have been calling attention to
Native oral literatures in recent years,
and much is now available from main
stream presses.
THE IMPORTANCE OF NATIVE AMERICAN MYTHOLOGY
The traditions and history of Native Americans are embodied in their myths and
rituals. A familiarity with Native American mythology therefore contributes
greatly to respecting and understanding their cultures, as it provides insight into
daily life and society and the collective experience of a tribe, past and present.

Information on the organization of families, gender roles, the operation of vari
ous political structures, the importance of certain foods, the reenactment of cer
emonies, the glorification of honor in war, funerary practices, natural disasters,
migrations, encounters with Europeans, and displacement can all be found in
Native American myths. Sometimes myths are the only remnants of a particular
native culture, and scholars rely on them to supplement the historical record.
The current interest in multiculturalism at the primary, secondary, and col
lege levels has brought written literature of Native Americans to the attention
of students as never before. Because Native written literature is greatly indebted
to the long-standing oral literature, a familiarity with the mythology that lies at
the heart of every aspect of Native tradition and culture is advantageous to un
derstanding the written literature.
Native American myths and legends may also promote scholarly and scientific
theories and beliefs and contribute constructively to their debate. The Iroquois have
possessed a viable material culture for several thousand years; both the archaeologi
cal record and a rich body of surviving folklore provide supporting evidence (Erdoes
1984, xii). Oral traditions about geologic and climactic events may be a significant
source of information; various peoples of the Plains speak of the Great Flaming
Rock tradition. Some scientists have theorized that Paleo-Indians caused the extinc
tion of megafauna through over hunting, while Indians attribute their demise, in al
most every instance, to an act of the Great Spirit, an implication that some kind of
natural event was behind their disappearance (Deloria 1997).
The role and importance of mythology in Native affairs has expanded in re
cent times, becoming a charter for cultural revival and a mechanism Native
Americans have used to justify their rights to traditional lands, achieve eco
nomic parity, and repossess human remains and certain cultural items held by
non-native cultural institutions and government agencies. In 1997, as the result
of a suit pressed by the Gitksan, the Supreme Court of Canada recognized the
Northwest Coast Bear Mother myth as evidence in support of their claim to
roughly 22,000 square miles of land in British Columbia. Although the Gitksan
did not actually secure rights to the land they sought, this case established that
oral traditions must be taken into consideration in such cases. In 1988, the
United States passed the Indian Gaming and Regulatory Act, which created the
jurisdictional framework that governs the numerous Indian gaming enterprises
that have emerged in recent decades on traditional Indian lands, the rights to
some of which have been affirmed in court using oral traditions. Some proceeds
have been used to finance museums and cultural centers where Indian history
has been dramatized. The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation
Act, passed in 1990, explicitly states that oral traditions may be used in support
of repatriation of grave goods and human remains (Bierhorst 2002, 234–237).

NOTES
1. Though we have used the term mythology in this book, we would like to emphasize that there is no one Native American mythology, just as there is no single group of people called Native Americans. It is more accurate and sensitive to recognize the distinctions between the mythologies of the various tribal groups, just as it is more accurate and sensitive to recognize distinctions between other aspects of their cultures.
2. We would like to stress that much of the information about native origins in this introduction is based on theory and speculation, and dates are approximations. The archaeological record suggests multiple possibilities, so much remains controversial.
3. It is important to note that many Native Americans have vigorously challenged the Bering Strait migration theory in part because it cannot be reconciled with any of their traditions or memories that have been transmitted from generation to generation by their ancestors. See Deloria (1997).
4. Taylor (2001, 40, 45) refers to the “low counters,” scholars of the early twentieth century, and the more recent “high counters.” Low counters estimated the native population of the Americas to be about 10 million in 1492 (including about 1 million in the present United States and Canada). At minimum, the high counters estimate this population to be 20 million; some go as high as 100 million. Most now estimate around 50 million, including about 5 million living north of Mexico. By 1800, only about 600,000 Indians remained in present-day Canada and the United States.
5. According to Taylor (2001, 10), native peoples spoke at least 375 distinct languages in 1492.
6. Champagne’s The Native North American Almanac (2001, 267–375) prefers to define a series of culture areas that more closely reflects contemporary Indian life: Native Peoples of the Northeast; Southeastern Indians; Southwestern Indians; Northern Plains Indians; Northwest Coast Indians; Alaska Natives; Oklahoma Indians; Indians of the Plateau, Great Basin, and Rocky Mountains; California Indians; Aboriginal Peoples in Canada.
7. Bierhorst (2001, 17–19) identifies the Native American mythological pattern and proposes mythological regions that closely follow the traditional culture areas used by anthropologists. See also Leeming and Page (1998, 4–14) for a discussion of this mythological pattern and the traditional culture areas.
8. The Jesuit Relations, vital to recreating the history of the French in North America, contains a wealth of information about the aboriginal peoples with whom the French made contact, and the economic, social, political, demographic, and religious consequences of that contact.
9. Schoolcraft, a contemporary of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (The Song of Hiawatha), was the source of Longfellow’s information about Native American myths.

TIME
I
n order to understand and appreciate the events, themes, and people in non
Western mythology or legend, it may be helpful to look briefly at concepts of
time, since many cultures around the world have conceived of time in a man
ner that differs with that of the European tradition.
According to Viola F. Cordova, Western cultures have a tendency to assign
a linear dimension to time, which allows it to be quantified and measured.
Non-Westerners, on the other hand, view time as an immeasurable abstrac
tion—time exists, but there is little notion of measured segments that may be
highly anticipated and then are gone forever (Cordova in Weaver 1998, 29).
LINEAR TIME
One who has been raised with the Western/European concept of time under
stands time in a linear fashion. Events occur on a continuum—a timeline.
Students in social studies and history classes are taught to construct timelines
to help them understand the relationship of events in time. Next to hash marks
on a line that represents time, students pencil in important events, such as bat
tles of the American Civil War or major world events. In Western thought, time
has a specific beginning. In the Judeo-Christian tradition, time began with the
creation of the universe. By the volition of the Creator, the heavens, earth,
night and day, the plants, animals, and finally human beings came into exis
tence. Although the Creator himself transcended time, the creation had a begin
ning and will have an end at the final judgment.
Western science agrees that the universe had a sudden beginning. Various
theories have been proposed over the centuries, with the “Big Bang,” or varia
tions of it, currently the most widely accepted. This theory states that the uni
verse, and time, began billions of years ago with a great explosion. Experts in
disciplines such as physics and astronomy support their theories with results
from extensive studies. One of the most exciting outcomes of recent technolog
ical advances in astronomy is the ability of the Hubble Space Telescope and sev
eral earth-based telescopes to peer deep into the primordial past. Due to the



Handbook of Native American Mythology

great distances light or radio waves must travel, the farther from earth the tele
scopes look the older the galaxies are, thus enabling scientists to look back
across time. Evidence of galaxies that are mind-boggling distances from earth is
now being discovered, and scientists hope that they will soon be close to seeing
the universe shortly after the Big Bang event.
A human life, too, can be depicted along a timeline, with the moment of
conception at the beginning of the line and death at its terminus. We each find
ourselves somewhere along the line between those two points, steadily pro
gressing toward the end.
CYCLICAL ASPECTS OF TIME
Not all cultures, however, have seen time as being one directional. The ancient
Greeks observed natural phenomena and described the cyclical nature of time.
Nature, they believed, consisted of opposing forces, such as night and day, win
ter and summer. One of the opposing forces would prevail briefly and then fade
while the other force became dominant, and the opposing forces alternated
their dominance in repeatable cycles. The Greeks and other ancient cultures
learned to observe the movement of the sun, moon, and stars to define a
“year”—the period of time it took for these celestial bodies to move through
the heavens and align themselves again at the same location. The Lakota’s com
plex mythology describes the “four times.” The first was daylight and the sec
ond nighttime. The third time consisted of the phases of the moon. The fourth
time was not created until Tate’s sons (see the entry entitled Wind) had re
turned from their mission to establish the four corners of the earth and the four
seasons. They had been away from home twelve moon times; thus it was estab
lished that twelve months would make a year.
Time’s cyclical aspects can also be seen in the passage of generations: living
beings are born, give life, die, and then the next generation repeats the process,
and in cultures around the world sacred rites are associated with these signifi
cant cyclical events. Agriculture, too, is cyclical. The cycles of the seeding or
sowing, watering (especially where people depend on seasonal rains), growing,
and then harvesting domestic plants are seen as sacred processes. Some cultures
developed fertility rites to assure a plentiful supply of food; others offered spe
cial prayers of thanksgiving for the plants, the rain, and the sun that produced a
good crop. When the harvest was completed and preparations were made to
store some of the harvested grain for the next year’s cycle, thanksgiving cere
monies took place. Due to the cyclical nature of agriculture, many Native
American groups held thanksgiving ceremonies throughout the year as each



crop was harvested. The late winter when the maple sap flows, the spring when
berries are gathered, and the late summer when the three sisters—beans, corn,
and squash—are harvested are all times of thanksgiving. Prayers offered at these
and other important times acknowledge the Creator and give thanks for all that
has been provided (Bruchac 1993, 79–80).
Not only does time operate in a cyclical manner, Bruchac points out, but so
does all of nature. This can be seen in the pattern of the seasons, the movement
of the moon and sun, and even in the way birds build their nests. He explains
that just as all points on the perimeter of a circle are equidistant from the cen
ter, so all of creation is equally significant. This extends to the entirety of na
ture; all living and nonliving things, as well as natural phenomena such as the
wind and rain, have not only great importance, but also a vital connection with
the rest of creation (Bruchac 2003, 10–11). Truly being part of the whole of na
ture, and not merely the master of it, has permeated the worldview of Native
people across North America and guided their relationship to the land, to natu
ral resources, and to each other.

SACRED SPACE
Long before Newton, Kant, Einstein, or Minkowski, ancient cultures around the
world understood that there was a relationship between time and space. They
understood that an event happening right here, right now could be imbued with
a sacredness that not only set the event apart from the mundane, but also set
apart the time and the place where it occurred. In the remembering of the event,
whether by telling and hearing oral narratives, or by participating in or viewing
various ceremonies, people were able to transcend the present and become part
of the sacred. Oftentimes this process included going back to that holy spot. It’s
not unusual for people around the globe to save their money for years in order to
visit what they believe to be a holy place. Indeed, some religious traditions re
quire that one undertake certain pilgrimages during one’s lifetime.
Another example of the melding of sacred time and space is described by
anthropologist Trudy Griffin-Pierce in her study of Navajo sandpainting. The
power of Navajo sandpainting is in the merging of time and space into a place
where the present and the mythic past coexist, Griffin-Pierce writes. The
Navajo consider sandpaintings to be “sacred, living entities” with the power to
“compress time and space.” It is through the power of sandpainting and the as
sociated rituals that an individual can be transported to a place where the pre
sent and the mythic world are one, a place where supernatural assistance and
healing can be found (Griffin-Pierce 1992, 98–99).
Native American people believe that time is cyclical and dynamic, and that
this cyclical time functions not only in the spiritual realm, but in the day-to
day existence of all living things. One Hopi scholar has called this relationship
“mythic reality.” In other words, the truth of this present, physical world exists
simultaneously with that of the mythic, spiritual world. This is a difficult con
cept to accept for many people with Western philosophical and scientific back
grounds. It necessitates the suspension of former beliefs in order to fully com
prehend the Native view of the land, the environment, family, and the past,
present, and future (Griffin-Pierce 1992, 6–7).
Many myths tell of sacred places. These are locations where specific events
took place in the distant past that have spiritual meaning for today or are re
membered because the event changed the way humans live or interact with this
world. One such story relates how Raven created Nunivak Island from a piece
of soil he had taken from a certain cape on the mainland. He carried the soil on
his back until he found the spot where he wanted the island. After dropping the
soil in the ocean, he tied it down with a rope he had fashioned from roots. But
that didn’t seem right, so he unleashed the clump of soil and sent it swimming
away. Later on, the clump of soil found a large block of ice floating along and
Handbook of Native American Mythology
36



joined up with it to become Nunivak Island. Then Raven looked it over and de
cided the island needed a mountain, so he flew off to find a suitable mountain.
When he returned, he hauled the mountain onto the island. Raven still thought
it didn’t look right, so he caused the wind to blow, which caused mountains to
form on the end of the island.
In the Pacific Northwest, several mountains, lakes, and rivers are identified
in local myths. Stories of the Great Flood tell of people in canoes or rafts land
ing on the high mountains when the water started to subside. Mt. Rainier, the
highest mountain in the area, is a frequently named location in these myths.
The great rivers of the Northwest are also featured in numerous myths. The
rivers not only provided a means of transportation, but they were also the
source of salmon, one of the main dietary staples of people in that region.
Sweet Medicine, the Cheyenne hero, after being banished from his village,
traveled to a sacred mountain. There he received instruction from a group of el
ders (actually spirits) who taught him about the Four Sacred Arrows and numer
ous other rules and ceremonies. He spent four years there learning all of these
things, and then the Old Ones sent him home with the sacred arrow bundle. He
was welcomed back at his village and the people gladly accepted the new teach
ings. Sweet Medicine continued to live a very long life, but when the time drew
near for him to die, the people carried him to the sacred mountain. They built a
shelter for him at the base of the mountain and then withdrew a few miles
away. The Cheyenne continued to observe all that Sweet Medicine had taught
them and to this day consider Devil’s Tower in Wyoming to be a sacred moun
tain (Stands In Timber 1998, 27–41).
A MYTHOLOGICAL CHRONOLOGY
The task of putting the myths and legends included in this volume into a con
cise chronology is beset by several obstacles. These include the fact that until
around the time of European contact, the written word was virtually unknown
in North America. Many groups used visual representations, painted or carved
on rock, wood, or leather, that depicted series of events—wars or battles, meteor
ological occurrences, and other extraordinary happenings. These were cues to
help remind a storyteller (or history teller) of key points in a narrative. The real
story, however, was held in the memory of the one to whom it was entrusted.
Events related through oral history are difficult to pin to a timeline without
the associated context. Many oral histories can be tied to events that have hap
pened within the memory of several generations. For example, a person might
have known a great-grandparent who knew a soldier from the American Civil
Time 37



War. A connection, albeit distant, could be felt to those events because of the sto
ries the great-grandparent had heard and then repeated to him or her. But many
mythological tales are so old that no one during historical (recorded) time remem
bers knowing anyone who was involved in or witnessed the events described.
A second difficulty related to assigning a chronology or temporal frame
work to the mythologies of Native North America is that of the diversity of
people represented. There is not one body of mythology to consider, but many.
However, there are common threads. Though we don’t want to overgeneralize,
we will attempt to relate several important beliefs that appear to be widely held
across the North American continent. We would caution our readers that while
we have tended to use past tense in many of our descriptions and explanations,
it is merely an editorial choice. We by no means feel that the belief systems or
religions of North America’s first people are invalid or dead.
MYTHIC TIME
One of the basic distinctions between mythology, legend, or folklore can be
viewed as the issue of placing these narratives in a time frame. However, just
saying the phrase “placing these narratives in a time frame” exposes our Euro
centric backgrounds. Western cultures give time a dimension not considered by
many non-western people. We want to pin down an event and put it into “con
text” with other events—did it happen before, simultaneously, or after another
event? The focus of the relationship of an instance in time is in regard to other
instances.
A question we must ask is: how do Native North Americans view time and
especially mythological time?
Free of the cultural constraints of western thought and not bound to a
timeline, native people across North America have considered time, and the
passing of it, as being part of a much larger concept. Time is also viewed in rela
tionship to space giving sacredness to locations where specific events took
place. Through the cycles of nature, and indeed of human existence, the world
and all that is in it are brought back to a spiritual center. Religious ceremonies
and rites of passage are repeated, some with the passage of the seasons, and
some with an individual’s movement through the phases of life. The rhythmic
cycles of these observances keep the people in touch with nature and with each
other. Passing on the knowledge of ceremonies, songs, dances, beliefs and val
ues, and their language to the next generation is an important responsibility
that many parents and elders take seriously.

Mythological time is seen as being in the long, long ago, a time when the
world was different than it is now. The myth narratives that tell about that era
often begin, “It was a very long time ago,” or “This happened a long time ago.”
Very few myths describe the world as created from nothingness as does the
Judeo-Christian tradition or even the Big Bang theory. Most Native American
myths that speak of the beginning of the world start with either an emergence
theme or an earth diver. In the emergence, people (often pre-humans or animal
people) depart from an original world that is often located at a lower level. The
beings must climb up to subsequent levels and eventually reach the level that
is the present earth. Another widespread beginning-of-time myth features an
earth diver. A common element in this one is that a few animal people are
floating or swimming in the waters that cover the earth. They eventually wish
for land to live on and after a series of attempts to bring mud up from the bot
tom of the water, one of the earth divers is successful. From that small bit of
mud, a tiny island is formed. The island grows and grows, until it stretches far
ther than anyone can see. Plants are distributed across the land (sometimes
from seeds mixed in with the mud), and thus the land is prepared for the com
ing of humans. In the Northeast Woodlands, a common variation is that the
mud is spread on the back of a turtle and thus the earth is seen as an island on
turtle’s back.
Hopi tradition states that there have been four worlds. The first world ex
isted harmoniously for a very long time, but some of the people began doing
evil and the Creator chose to destroy nearly everyone. The survivors went to
the second world. In time, this world also became exceedingly evil and was de
stroyed by the Creator. He let the few remaining faithful people continue to the
third world, described as being in the “womb of the earth,” or an ant kiva. Here
the survivors from the second world remained while it was destroyed by ice.
The people lived happily in the third world for a time. But then they became
evil and caused trouble. The Creator sent a flood to rid the land of the evil do
ers. However, a few faithful people were able to escape in hollow reeds. They
floated around until the waters eventually subsided and the reeds landed on a
high mountain. Spider Woman led them down the mountain to the fourth
world. (Versluis 1992, 24–25). This is the one in which we live now. The four
worlds comprise four separate but related time cycles, each ending with the de
struction of the previous cycle.
The Navajo also believe that there have been previous worlds, this being
the fifth. The earlier worlds were abandoned by the First People because of dis
sent among the inhabitants. It was in this fifth world that the birds and animals
became as they are today.
Time 39



IN THE TIME OF TRANSFORMERS AND ANIMAL PEOPLE
According to Jane McGary (in Swann 1994, 93), Raven was the Transformer
whose changes brought the world from myth time to historical time. Myths
that feature Raven abound across the far north and the northwest coast regions.
He was a crafty, greedy, and frequently self-centered fellow whose adventures,
or more often misadventures, centered on his pursuit of lustful desires.
Frequently, Raven’s cons backfired on him, but some of Raven’s actions bene
fited mankind, whether he meant them to or not. It was Raven who desired
light and devised an elaborate plan that eventually netted him the prize. But in
the process, he unleashed the stars, moon, and the sun, and they are now in the
heavens for all to enjoy. The people who lived at that time were not used to the
sun’s blazing light, so they ran off into the forests and became the animals we
know today.
In the most distant past, the first people were not actually humans or ani
mals. These beings were more like spirits or minor gods. Over time, however,
Animal People eventually came to be. Later, after the earth was formed (or re
formed after a great flood or other cataclysmic event), many of the Animal
People were changed into either real humans or real animals. They are still re
lated, and the bond that formed when animals and humans were one is still im
portant today.
A Miwok myth tells of a time long ago in which animals were like people.
In this narrative, Falcon and Coyote decided to make humans, and Coyote pre
tended to be dead. Soon buzzards and crows came and began pecking away at
Coyote’s buttock. The birds kept pecking deeper into his buttock until Coyote
suddenly closed the opening and trapped the scavengers inside. With Falcon’s
help, the birds were extracted and their feathers plucked. Then Coyote and
Falcon planted the feathers in the four directions. Soon the crow feathers turned
into people and the buzzard feathers transformed into chiefs. Coyote then
pointed out to Falcon that the new people looked just like them, so they would
have to become animals. Then all of the First People became the animals and
birds that we have today. (Erdoes 1998, 12).
Ethnographers and anthropologists have attempted to collect, analyze, and
categorize the mythologies of numerous Native peoples. In late-nineteenth
century California, over a five year period, Jeremiah Curtin recorded myths told
by an elderly Wintu man. When the collection was published in 1898, Curtin
stated in his introduction that the myths outlined three epochs. The first con
sisted of a time when nonhuman and nonanimal spirits (which he referred to as
the “first people”) existed in harmony. Second came a time of catastrophic

40



upheaval in which the natural order was overturned. During this age, the first
people were turned into the animals found in the world today. Humans ap
peared in the third age. By that time, plants, animals, and the earth’s landscape
was as it is now. The mythological narratives served as a history of how the
world began and informed the people about how their society should function
(Nabokov 2002, 87).
Writing about the Creeks, Bill Grantham identified two concepts of time:
temporal (linear) and cyclical (seen as myth or sacred) time. In an ancient time,
animals and people weren’t all that different. Animals spoke the same language
and behaved in similar ways to humans. All life was connected in a sacred way.
As time went on, the interaction with the sacred became less frequent and sa
cred time only intersected with the temporal during certain ceremonies, events,
and rites of passage (Grantham 2002, 63–65).
Franz Boas indicated that myths describe events that “happened at a time
when the world had not yet assumed its present form.” Yet mythical beings
could play a role in the historically based folktale. Thus the mythological age
had passed, but mythological figures, such as giants and animals who talked
and acted like humans, could still be found somewhere in the world. According
to Boas, the fact that a narrative contained mythological characters was not
what determined whether it was a myth. The determining factor was the story’s
setting in time and space (Boas 1914, 378–379).
MYTHS AND HISTORICAL TIME
Mythic time describes that era when the world and its inhabitants were very
different than they are now. However, myths, or what Boas called folktales, can
also be set in historical time, when the earth—its landscape, its flora and fauna,
and its people—was no different than it is today. Even though the mythical age
is past, mythical beings and even mythical lands still exist somewhere in the
present, and in these tales, mythical beings often interact with humans.
Numerous myth stories tell of giant cannibals such as Dzonokwa who kid
napped children and carried them off into the woods. Other mythological fig
ures include animals such as Blue Jay, Coyote, Mink, and Raccoon, who act
like, or interact with, humans.
Tricksters also exhibit human characteristics and at times are seen as ac
tual humans with supernatural abilities, especially when they are also
Transformers who go about changing the land and the people living in it. One
such individual is Manabozho of the Northeast Woodlands. A related figure also
from the Northeast Woodlands is Glooskap, who is often seen as a culture hero.
Time 41



He interacted with humans but also had a hand in transforming the land. His
footprints can be seen yet today. Numerous islands and lakes dot the landscape
in testimony of his adventures and journeys throughout the land.
Time has different meanings for different people. However, when consider
ing the mythological literature of a culture, care must be taken to attempt to
understand the appropriate cultural context. When studying the mythology of
Native North American people, notions of linear time and its related limita
tions must be set aside. New concepts of time and space will challenge the
reader to reflect on new meanings and possibilities.

DEITIES, THEMES, AND CONCEPTS
ADLIVUN
Central Inuit/Baffin Island, Arctic
The underworld realm of Sedna, the Sea Woman. A place where souls of the
dead were taken.
After Sedna’s dogs ate her father’s hands and feet, he cursed them all.
Suddenly the earth opened and they all fell down into the underworld region of
Adlivun. There Sedna’s large house was guarded by her dog, who moved only
slightly to allow the dead souls to pass.
The Sea Woman became very angry when humans broke any of her taboos.
She would then hide game animals from the hunters and the people began to
starve. While in a ceremonial trance, the spirit of a shaman (angakok) traveled
to Adlivun in order to appease her and win the release of the animals. But first
he had to get past the guard dog and only the most powerful angakok could ac
complish the task.

AFTERLIFE
A Menominee tale relates the story of a happily married couple. The husband
often declared to his wife, “If you die first, I will go with you.” His wife would
say the same. Then one day the wife became ill and died. Her husband decided
to be buried with her. His parents tried to dissuade him, but to no avail. And so
it was that the husband was buried next to his dead wife.
The man could see the tracks his wife made as she traveled to the land of
the dead and he followed her there to the west. When he arrived, he entered a
large lodge and saw an old man. “Why did you come?” the old man asked.
The man explained that he loved his wife so much that he wanted to take
her back home with him. The old man said it would be very difficult, but he



Handbook of Native American Mythology
44
would try to help. The old man arranged a dance and warned the husband to
hide and not let his wife see him. The people filed into the lodge and began
dancing. After a while the man peeked out and saw his wife dancing, but she
did not go near the old man. Finally the old man used an object about the size of
a flute to draw her toward him. When he had gotten her inside the object, he
closed the ends. He gave it to the husband and warned him not to let her out,
no matter what she said. As long as they could hear the old man’s drum, he
would not let her out. Finally, when he could no longer hear the drum, he re
leased his wife, but held her firmly by the hand. They traveled back to where
they were buried and leaped back into their bodies.
The man could hear his mother weeping, and called out to her. This fright
ened the old woman, who ran home to get her husband. The old man didn’t be
lieve her but finally went to the gravesite with his wife. There they uncovered
the bodies and found that their son was indeed alive. The people quickly
erected a ceremonial hut. The man and woman went into the hut while oil was
poured over hot stones. The woman who had been dead cried out for a long
time. Finally, she was no longer crying, and the people heard the man and his
wife conversing. The man called for water to wash their faces and then the
people opened the hut. The couple came out and the woman was alive.
Mechling included the Malecite narrative “The Man Who Followed His Wife
into Spirit Land.” Once there was a man who dearly loved his wife. When she be
came ill and showed no signs of improvement, the man made plans to follow her
spirit. He cut a hole in their wigwam beside where she slept. Then he went out
side and sat next to the hole watching for her spirit to leave. It wasn’t long before
he saw a wisp of what looked like smoke pass by him. He gathered his belongings
for the journey and followed her spirit. He traveled all day, and at night he came
to a camp where he asked an old woman if she had seen his wife pass by. “Yes,
about noon,” she said. The man asked if she thought he would be able to catch up.
The old woman didn’t know, but told him to continue his travels and he would
come to the home of a much older woman who would probably know the answer.
So the man continued on his journey without stopping to rest. The next
evening he came to another camp and found a woman who looked older than
anyone he had ever seen previously. Again he asked if she had seen his wife.
“Yes, last evening.” He asked this old woman if she thought he could catch up.
Again the reply was, “Continue on your journey and you will come to the
house of a woman much older than I. Perhaps she will have the answer.”
The man continued and arrived the next evening at the camp of an old
woman who looked even older than the one before. He asked if she had seen his
wife. “Yes, yesterday morning.” When he asked if she thought he could catch
up to his wife, the old woman told him that it would be difficult, but if he



would do exactly as she said, it might be possible. She gave him a nut to take
with him and instructed him to set out in a certain direction and to ignore all
the noises he might hear, even if he heard his wife’s voice. When he arrived at a
certain wigwam, he was to sit in a corner. The spirits would dance around him,
and when his wife danced near him, he was to open the nut. This would bring
her back to life. When she passed by, he was to close the nut. Then he was to
leave the wigwam and return in the direction he came.
On his way home, he stopped at the wigwam of the first old woman. She
asked how he had fared. The man described what had happened, and the old
woman asked to see the nut. She told him that it was full of oil, and when he
returned home he was to dig up his wife’s body and grease all of her joints with
the oil. The old woman also gave him a comb to comb his wife’s hair. The man
thanked the old woman and in the morning proceeded on his way.
It took him a long time to reach his home, and when he did, he found that
the people had all aged greatly in his absence. He made a shovel and dug up his
wife’s bones. He oiled her joints as he was instructed and when he was finished,
his wife looked as she had before her illness. She asked for a drink of water. He
then rushed to his mother-in-law’s to get clothes for his wife. The old woman be
gan to weep with joy that she would soon see her daughter again. The man re
turned to his wife, and when she had dressed they went to her parent’s camp. The
old people then became young again, looking as they did before the woman died.
A number of Native American myths about the afterlife are similar to the
Greek “Orpheus” tale. In this tragic story, Orpheus’s bride, Eurydice, died.
Overcome with grief, Orpheus traveled to Hades and succeeded in persuading
Pluto, the king of the dead, to let her return with him to the land of the living.
There was a stipulation, however, and it required Orpheus to refrain from look
ing back at Eurydice while they traveled to the upper world. Unfortunately,
Orpheus was unable to keep from looking at his wife, and she immediately was
taken from him.
The following Comanche narrative was recorded by Ake Hultkrantz during
an interview with Dr. Ralph Linton. Dr. Linton in turn heard it during his work
with the Comanche in 1933.
There was a young man who loved his wife so much that when she died, he
vowed to follow her. He made preparations and rode off to the west. He traveled
so long that all of his provisions and everything he had with him gave out, in
cluding his horse. Finally, he arrived on foot to the region of the dead. He was
greeted by children skipping around him. Then he found his father-in-law’s
home where his wife was staying. He asked his wife to return with him. She
was unable to decide because although she loved her husband, she was happy
where she was. Finally, her father settled the issue. He told his son-in-law, “You
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 45



may take my daughter back to the land of the living. But as you travel east, you
may not touch her until you get to the place where the buffalo are. Give her a
buffalo kidney to eat and then she will become alive. You must never strike her,
for if you do, she will return to us.”
The young couple set off on their journey and eventually arrived on the
plains. The husband killed a buffalo and gave a kidney to his wife to eat. She
then became alive again and they happily returned to their village. Life went on
well until autumn. One day as they lay together, the man wanted to pull the
buffalo hide around himself and his wife. As he tugged on the robe, his hand
slipped and struck his wife. “You hit me and now I have to return to the land of
the dead!” she cried as her voice faded away.

ALARANA AND HER BROTHER
Inupiat (North Alaskan Eskimos), Arctic
A tale of a brother and sister who were eaten by wolves and then became caribou.
There was a famine at Point Barrow. Everyone died except for a girl named
Alarana and her brother. The siblings set off to find other people, but on the
way they were surrounded and eaten by a pack of hungry wolves (who were
sometimes wolves and sometimes people). An old woman among them asked to
have the children’s bones. She spread caribou skins on the floor and then laid
out the children’s bones on top of the skins. Then she laid walrus guts over all
the bones and sang a magic song. Soon the bones began to move and the chil
dren came back to life as humans wearing clothes made from caribou skins.
Eventually the brother and sister traveled inland. They came upon a herd of
caribou and were surprised they could approach it without startling it. As the
siblings walked among the caribou, they discovered that they had turned into
caribou. During the following days, the brother and sister learned to live like
caribou. They scraped snow from the ground to uncover moss. However, for
Alarana and her brother, the moss seemed to taste like human food such as guts
and whale skin. They also learned to graze while keeping watch for hunters and
other enemies of the caribou.
Handbook of Native American Mythology
46



When it came time for hunters to set traps for the caribou, Alarana and her
brother were able to avoid being caught because they remembered how the
traps worked. At night they would quietly approach the hunters’ camp and hear
them talking. Alarana missed humans so much that she and her brother finally
removed their caribou coats and went into the camp. There they were wel
comed and the hunters told about the poor results of their expedition.
Alarana held a séance and convinced the spirits to allow the animals to be
caught. But she told the hunters that there was one condition. One special cari
bou was to be saved for her; no one else could have it. However, as it sometimes
happens, there was a greedy hunter in the group who claimed the animal for
himself. So Alarana and her brother donned their coats and returned to the for
est as caribou. The hunters from that camp never again had good fortune when
hunting caribou.

ANGAKOK
Inuit, Yupik Eskimos (Alaskan Eskimos), Arctic
A shaman.
Angakoks (angakut) were most often men; however, a woman could also
become an angakok.
How a person became an angakok depended on the situation. Sometimes a son
would be trained to follow in his father’s footsteps, or an established angakok might
tutor a young person who exhibited a special gift or talent. Others were called
through strange dreams or visions. During the training period, the novice learned
not only the oral traditions and ceremonies that would need to be performed, but
also the special language of the angakoks. This language was comprised of archaic
words and expressions handed down over the ages by angakoks across the Arctic.
Somewhere during the training period, the novice angakok would receive one or
more familiar spirits (sometimes referred to as “helping spirits” and even “guardian
spirits”). These spirits would be visible only to the angakok.
Angakoks lived as their neighbors did until intervention with the spiritual
world was needed. Then they would be called upon to perform ceremonies to
cure the sick or to discover the cause of misfortunes such as accidents, bad
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 47



weather, or unsuccessful hunting
expeditions. Payment was expected
for services rendered to an individ
ual or a family, but ceremonies for
the common good of the village or
other group seem to have been per
formed without charge.
Often illnesses or difficulties
resulted from a taboo being broken.
The angakok would hold a cere
mony in which his familiar spirits
would assist him to travel outside
of his body to far-off places where
he would learn the cause of the
problem and how to rectify the sit
uation. Once he returned to his
body, the angakok would question
the individual or other persons in
the household. The general belief
was that the angakok knew who
was at fault, so those he questioned
were obliged to answer him truth
fully. At times only a confession
was needed, and then the angakok
would announce that all would be
well. At other times, however, he
would declare that certain acts of
penance must be performed, rang
ing from cleaning the urine pots before dawn to swapping wives.
One of the most widely reported rituals was the Central Eskimo’s Sedna
ceremony, which was performed each autumn to ensure that hunters would be
successful. Sedna, the Sea Woman, became angry with humans when they
broke her taboos. In order to pacify her, an angakok’s spirit, while in a dream,
had to travel down to Adlivun where Sedna and her father lived. Once inside
her house, the angakok smoothed out Sedna’s hair, which is difficult for her to
do since she has no fingers. He also pleaded (some say fought) with Sedna to let
the animals return to the hunters so the people would not starve. Sedna then
informed him about the people’s transgressions and her anger toward them. The
angakok would assure Sedna that the people were sorry and would promise that
from now on they would keep all of her taboos.

Congress)



Once the angakok’s spirit returned to his body, there was a time for com
munal confessions, and then much rejoicing that Sedna had been tamed and the
hunting parties would be successful.

ANI HYUNTIKWALASKI
Cherokee, Southeast
This story explains how man acquired fire through the actions of the
Thunderers and the little Water Spider. The Thunderers, who inhabit the
Darkening Land in the west, are the sons of the great spirits Kanati (The Lucky
Hunter) and Selu (Corn). The spider is a culture hero that appears often in most
Native American mythology but is otherwise absent from Southeastern stories.
Long ago, the world was without fire and was cold until the Thunderers set
fire to a hollow sycamore tree with their lightning. The animals could see the
smoke but could not reach the tree, because it grew on an island.
Various birds volunteered to fly to the tree and bring back the fire. The
Raven went first, but while he was wondering what to do, his feathers were
burned black, and he returned without fire. The little Screech Owl went next,
but as he was looking down inside the tree, a blast of hot air nearly burned out
his eyes. He managed to fly home, but it was some time before he recovered,
and his eyes remain red to this day. The Hoot Owl and Horned Owl tried next,
but the smoke from the now fiercely burning fire nearly blinded them, and
ashes borne by the wind made white rings around their eyes that they could
not rub away.
No other birds would venture to the island, so the Black Racer snake and
the great Blacksnake both swam to the fire and were scorched black. At last the
Water Spider volunteered to go and bring back the fire. She spun a small bowl, a
tusti bowl, and fastened it to her back. The Water Spider crossed the water to
the island, put one coal of fire into her bowl, and returned safely with it. Ever
since, man has had fire.

AURORA BOREALIS
Algonquian tribes, Subarctic; Inuit, Inupiat (North Alaskan Eskimos), Arctic
For the people of the far northern regions, the aurora borealis is a spectacular phe
nomenon. Children were warned to hide when the aurora was active and adults
thought it caused head and neck pain. Some groups believed that the lights were
caused by spirits holding torches as they searched for the souls of those who re
cently died. These spirits also communicated with humans by making whistling
sounds and the humans whispered back with messages for the dead.
One evening two brothers went outside to watch the kiguruyat (“spirits
who gnaw with their teeth”) play football. The older brother cautioned his
younger brother not to talk loudly or to whistle; otherwise, the spirits might
find them and carry them away. While hiding in some willows, the older boy
told this story:
“Late one night there were two boys playing outdoors. Suddenly they heard
hissing noises and saw colored lights flashing in the sky. It was the kiguruyat
coming for them. The older brother told the younger one to cover his face and
lie down in the snow. When the kiguruyat finally left, the boys crawled to a
shelter under a willow. The lights of the kiguruyat were still flashing in the dis
tance. The younger brother then asked, ‘What is that ball that they are playing
with?’ His brother told him that it was the head of a disobedient child who had
wandered off and was taken up to the sky by the kiguruyat. The team leader bit
the child’s head off with his sharp teeth.”
When the older brother finished the story, the young boy asked, “Do you
really think the kiguruyat are using a child’s head for a football?”
“Yes,” his older brother answered.
The younger brother was frightened and wanted to go home. So his brother
waited until the flashing lights were far away and then said, “Run! Cover your
mouth and breathe into your parka.” Just as they neared their igloo the kigu
ruyat came swooping overhead. When they were safely inside, the younger

brother said, “If you had not protected me, the kiguruyat would have carried
me away.” He then promised to keep watch over his little brother, too. References and further reading:

BEAN WOMAN
Seneca, Northeast Woodlands
Beans, Corn, and Squash, pioneered by the Indians of central Mexico, were
called “The Three Sisters” by many tribes in the Northeast. A narrative in the
Curtin and Hewitt collection tells of Bean Woman.
Long, long ago there was a certain village located near a river. The people
heard singing coming from downstream. It was Bean Woman who sang, “Who
will marry me?” The first to answer her was Panther Man. Bean Woman asked,
“If I marry you, what will you give me to eat?” Panther Man’s reply was that he
would keep her supplied with meat. But, Bean Woman said, “In that case, I can
not marry you as I cannot eat that kind of food.”
So she again sang, “Who will marry me? Isn’t there anyone who will marry
me?” Soon Deer Man drew near and offered to marry her. “What will you give
me to eat if I marry you?” she asked. Deer Man replied, “We will have buds and
the bark from tender young saplings for our food.” To that Bean Woman sighed,
“That will not do. I have never had buds nor bark for food.”
A third time Bean Woman sang out, “Is there anyone who is willing to
marry me? Let him come and ask me.” This time Bear Man came and said,
“Yes, please marry me.” Once again Bean Woman asked, “What sort of food
will you provide for me?” Bear Man told her of all the many baskets of nuts that
he had stored away. She could eat as many nuts as she wished. But, Bean
Woman rejected his offer as well.
Again, Bean Woman began singing, “Is there anyone who will marry me?”
The fourth suitor was Wolf Man, who said, “I am willing. Marry me.” Bean
Woman asked Wolf Man the same question that she had asked the others, “If I
marry you, what will you bring me to eat?” Wolf Man said, “I will bring meat
and venison for you to eat.” But Bean Woman refused to eat that sort of food
and sent him away.

Bean Woman sang again, “Is there anyone willing to marry me? Let him
ask me.” Corn Man approached and said, “I am willing, if you will accept me.”
Bean Woman asked him, “What sort of food would you provide for me, if I
marry you?” Corn Man said, “You will have sweet corn to eat always.” This
was the answer Bean Woman had been longing for, and when she accepted his
offer of marriage, Corn Man said, “Come to me.” Bean Woman rushed to him
and threw her arms around his neck. “This is what our Creator meant for us.”
Bean Woman and Corn Man continued to happily live together. This is why we
find the bean vine embracing the corn stalk even to this day.

BEAR
Bear is one of the most common characters in Native American myths. In some
stories, he is friendly and intelligent. He appears as a culture hero, friend, mas
ter of animals, and chief of the underworld. He has been known to give power
and heal. Bear taught the Oneida gentleness and strength, but at times he was
malicious and perverse. Ceremonies and rituals centering on the bear were prac
ticed among a variety of cultures, particularly the Algonquians; the bear was
revered in hunting practices, for example.
In the following story of the Cree, Bear is benevolent.
A bear found a boy in the woods and cared for him for several years as
though they were father and son. During the summers, the bear would hunt,
and together he and the boy would gather blueberries in the autumn. They
would take their food to where they planned to spend the winter.
One fall, the child’s father started to sing. His song was so powerful and
strong, the bear was unable to oppose the father with his own song, because he
forgot his own song and stopped singing.
During the following winter, the father sang again, and he defeated the
bear’s song once more. The next day, the bear told the child he sensed that the
boy’s father was preparing to come and find them.
The father started walking directly to where the bear and the child were
staying. The bear tried to lead him off his path by throwing a porcupine out of
his den, but the man kept walking straight. Next, the bear threw out a beaver.
Then, he threw out a partridge, but the man still kept walking. The bear realized

the man’s power was stronger than
his. The bear next tried to use his
magic to defeat the man. He lay on
his back with all four legs in the air,
and an object came hurling out of
the sky, causing a huge storm. But
the father still kept coming toward
the bear.
The bear knew that the boy’s
father was about to kill him, so he
gave the boy one of his forelegs. He
told the boy to keep it wrapped up
and hanging in his tent, above
where he always sat. He said that if
the boy wanted to hunt bears, he
should climb to get a good view of
his surroundings and look for rising
smoke. Only he would be able to
see the smoke, and if he went to the
place where the smoke was, he
would always find a bear.
The child’s father then broke
the snow around the bear’s den. The
bear came outside and was killed.
The man took his son home, and
the boy watched over the bear’s
foreleg as he had been told.
The boy eventually got married and was an extremely successful bear
hunter. His hunting group was able to live almost entirely on bear meat.
Sometimes he told another hunter where to look for a bear, and he would al
ways find and kill one.
This hunting group was visited by another. The women of this group were
very jealous because the hero of the first group always found a bear and their hus
bands were never able to kill any. One day, while the hero was off hunting, one of
the women of the second hunting group entered his tent in search of his source of
power. There she found the package, and started to unwrap it. Immediately, the
hero realized what was happening, and he returned to camp. He entered his tent
and asked for the culprit. The woman confessed that it was her. He told her that
she could find a bear the next day by going to a specific place he described.

The hero then removed his ammunition pouch and clothes and went to sit
at his accustomed place. The leg instantly fell down, and both he and the leg
disappeared underground without a trace. It was said that he had become a bear.

BLIND BOY
Inuit, Arctic
This tale about how the Narwhal got its tusk is known in many areas of the
North American Arctic.
Once there was a blind boy whose mother was very cruel to him. Even though
he helped kill a polar bear that wandered by, his mother would not let him have
any of it to eat. He could smell meat cooking, but his mother denied it. The boy’s
sister, however, hid some of her supper and later gave it to him while their mother
was out. The boy decided to find an opportunity to kill his cruel mother.
Sometime later, when the boy was outside, a large loon carried him off to
its nest on the edge of a cliff. The loon then dove into the water with the boy.
They did this several times until the boy’s eyesight was restored. His vision was
so good that he could see far in the distance to where his mother was. When he
returned to his home, his mother realized that she must be careful and from
then on she treated him more kindly.
One day the mother and son were hunting narwhal. The mother held the
end of the harpoon rope by tying it around her waist, but she feared that a large
narwhal would drag her into the sea. So she asked her son to aim for only the
small ones. This he did, and they soon were feasting on the blubber. Another
time they saw a large narwhal and a smaller one. The mother again asked her
son to aim for the smaller narwhal, as she still feared being pulled into the sea.
However, the boy aimed at the large narwhal and his spear struck deep. The
narwhal struggled to get free and pulled away from shore. It was too strong and
the mother was dragged into the water. She yelled for the boy to toss her a knife
so she could free herself, but he refused, and the cruel woman was drowned.

Then the woman became a narwhal herself. Her hair, which was worn in a
twisted knot on top of her head, became a tusk. From then on, narwhals have
had twisted tusks.

BLOOD CLOT
Ute, Great Basin
In this tale of human creation, a baby boy born from a clot of buffalo blood de
rives power from this mighty animal. Another story in which a boy forms from
the blood of a game animal is “Kanati and Selu,” told by the Cherokee.
Long ago, an old man discovered some buffalo tracks and followed them
until they stopped, where he came upon a large clot of blood. Since game was
scarce and he and his wife were hungry, he wrapped it up and brought it home.
The old man’s wife placed the clot in a kettle of water, but before the water
came to a boil, they heard a voice cry out. The man reached into the kettle and
pulled out a baby boy, who had somehow formed from the blood clot. The old
couple named the boy Blood Clot and raised him as their son.
Eventually, Blood Clot learned to hunt game and birds. His father proudly
noted his ability to track and kill a different kind of animal every time he went
out: a cottontail, then a badger, a deer, an elk, a mountain goat, a mountain
lion, an otter, a beaver. Now they had plenty of food.
One day, Blood Clot told the old man and his wife that he wanted to visit a
village where many people lived. He promised to hunt for them one last time,
day and night, before he left, so they would have plenty of food. Blood Clot in
structed them to tie up their tent, put rocks on the edges to weigh them down,
and fasten the door securely so the wind would not carry it away. He warned
his mother and father that the wind would be strong, but they should not be
afraid, and they should stay inside until he called them to come out.
Blood Clot hunted all night while they slept. When daylight arrived, he
called his mother and father out of the tent. Upon opening the door, they saw
dead buffalo lying all over on the ground. He instructed them to dry the meat
and hides, and asked his mother to make him a lunch before he left. His parents
cried and asked him to someday return.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 55



After traveling a few days, Blood Clot reached the village, where he was in
vited to sit down with the chief and his daughter. The chief asked him where he
came from and which tribe he belonged to. Blood Clot told him he did not
know. The chief then stepped outside and invited his people to come and meet
their visitor. The people asked Blood Clot if he belonged to various tribes
Deer, Elk, Otters, Beavers, and others—but he told them he thought not.
Finally, one old man said that Blood Clot’s power suggested he was one of the
Buffalo. Blood Clot thought about this carefully and agreed.
Blood Clot was asked to stay in the village and marry the chief’s daughter.
On the eve of the wedding, Blood Clot asked his father-in-law to bring him an ar
row, which he did. He told him to have all the tipis fastened securely and warn
the people to stay indoors, because a great storm was coming. In the morning,
Blood Clot called to the chief, who came outside to find dead buffalo lying before
every lodge. The entire village was invited to partake of a great feast.
One day, a hunting party left the village to find buffalo. Long before, Blood
Clot had warned his wife to never say the word “calf,” as he was part of the
Buffalo Calf and it was part of him. As the party was butchering its kill, another
herd of buffalo thundered past. Blood Clot’s wife pointed and cried out “Kill
that calf!” Blood Clot instantly jumped on a horse and galloped away, changing
into a buffalo as he did so. Forever after, he ran with the buffalo.

BLUE JAY
Chinook, Northwest Coast
Blue Jay tales are found among many peoples of the Pacific Northwest region.
Blue Jay is sometimes portrayed as a trickster character. What follows is part of
a series of tales involving Blue Jay and his sister Ioi.
One night the ghosts decided to buy a wife and traveled to the village
where Blue Jay and Ioi lived. They left a dowry of dentalia for her parents and
then disappeared with her. After a year had passed, Blue Jay wished to see his
sister again. So he said, “I’ll go look for her.” He wasn’t sure which way to go,
so he asked everyone he met, “Where do dead people live?” At last he was able
Handbook of Native American Mythology
56



to reach the Land of the Ghosts and was happily reunited with his sister. In that
village he found that all the houses were full of bones. There was even a pile of
bones near his sister that she introduced to him as his brother-in-law. “Ha, she’s
lying!” Blue Jay thought. “That pile of bones cannot be my brother-in-law!”
That night the houses were suddenly full of people. Blue Jay asked Ioi about
the people, but she just laughed and said that they weren’t people at all, but
ghosts. Then she encouraged him to go along fishing with one of his brother-in
law’s relatives, but warned him not to speak to the boy. However, when Blue
Jay joined in the song the ghosts were singing, he found that the boy had be
come a pile of bones. A little while later, the boy was sitting in the back of the
canoe again. Every once in awhile, Blue Jay would talk loudly, just to see the
boy fall to a pile of bones again. He kept himself amused with this game until
they came to the fishing spot. The boy told him to dip his net in, but when Blue
Jay pulled his net out, it only contained twigs and leaves, so he threw them
back into the water. A few leaves fell into the canoe, so the boy gathered them
up. This happened several times until Blue Jay finally decided to keep some of
the twigs and branches for sister’s fire.
When they returned to Ioi’s house, she told him that he should not have
thrown the leaves and twigs back into the water because they were really fish.
Blue Jay thought she was lying again. However, his sister went down to the
beach and brought back two salmon she found in the bottom of the canoe. Blue
Jay didn’t know where she’d gotten them, but she told him they were ones that
he had caught.
The next night, Blue Jay went fishing again with the boy, but this time, in
stead of throwing the leaves and branches back into the water, he piled them up
in the canoe. On the way back home, Blue Jay delighted in shouting several
times just to make the ghost people turn into piles of bones. His sister met
them on the beach and helped carry the salmon back to her house.
On the following night, Blue Jay heard someone say that a whale had been
found. His sister gave him a knife and urged him to hurry down to the beach.
When he got there, all he saw was a big log. He yelled at the people, “Where is
the whale?” But they all fell into piles of bones. In a while the people were back
up and started peeling bark off the log. So Blue Jay did the same and hauled two
large pieces of bark back to his sister’s house. He threw them on the ground and
then went inside to tell her that it was only a log on the beach. But his sister
looked outside and exclaimed, “No, it is whale meat!” So Blue Jay went back to
the beach. On his way he met someone carrying bark up the path. Blue Jay
shouted at him and he fell into a pile of bones. Blue Jay picked up the bark and
carried it home. He did this several times more and was able to get a lot of
whale meat for his sister.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 57



The next morning, Blue Jay decided to play tricks on the ghosts. He went
into houses and changed the bones around. He put an old man’s head on the
bones of a child and the child’s head on the old man. That night, the child could
not sit up because his head was too heavy and the old man’s head was too light.
The next day, Blue Jay put the heads back with the right bones, but switched
their legs around. The old man had the short legs and the child had the long legs.
Eventually, the ghost people complained about Blue Jay’s tricks, and Ioi’s
husband told her to send him home. At first he didn’t want to go, but he finally
left. On his way, he came to a prairie that was ablaze, and Blue Jay burned to
death. Then he went back to the land of the ghosts. His sister met him at the
river and went over to him in her husband’s canoe. Blue Jay thought the canoe
was beautiful, but Ioi reminded him that he used to complain that it was full of
holes and covered with moss. He thought she was lying to him. When they
came to the village, the people were playing games and singing. Blue Jay
shouted at them, trying to get them to fall into piles of bones, but the people
just laughed at him. He kept pestering them to no avail until finally his sister
told him that he was dead, too. And then he became quiet.

BUFFALO WIFE
Okanagon, Plateau
In the Buffalo Wife tale, Coyote is an anti-hero. His excesses and indiscretions
are the reason the buffalo herds didn’t venture very far west of the plains.
Coyote was traveling north when he saw an old buffalo skeleton and re
lieved himself on the skull. A short time later he heard a great noise, and when
he looked back there was the old buffalo bull charging him. Coyote ran to a
nearby boulder, but the buffalo chased him around and around. Finally, Coyote
stopped and gasped, “Why are you chasing me?” The buffalo was angry because
Coyote had urinated on his head.
To distract his attacker, Coyote asked, “What killed you?” The buffalo ex
plained that he had been in a fight with a younger bull and lost because his old
Handbook of Native American Mythology
58



horns were dull. Then Coyote had an idea. He told the old buffalo that if he
promised not to hurt him, Coyote would make his horns sharp again. So Coyote
attached sharp roots to the buffalo’s horns. Buffalo rammed a log with his horns
and gave it a toss. The new horns worked so well that Buffalo declared to
Coyote that they were now friends.
Buffalo asked Coyote to accompany him back to his herd. He would fight the
young bull again to win his wives back. Buffalo even promised Coyote that he’d
give one of the wives to him. They eventually found Buffalo’s herd and the young
bull with all of Buffalo’s wives. Buffalo attacked the younger bull and killed him.
Then Buffalo said to Coyote, “Chose whichever wife you want.” Coyote picked a
fat one, because she would be thin by the time they arrived back at Coyote’s
home. However, before Coyote and his new wife set out, Buffalo warned him,
“Do not sleep with her for three nights. After that you may do what you want.”
They started back to Coyote’s home and on the second night, Coyote
thought, “Buffalo’s time is too long.” So he grabbed his wife, but before he
could begin what he intended, she vanished. Coyote assumed she had returned
to her own people, so he went back. Buffalo was angry that Coyote did not obey
him, but since they were friends, he let Coyote take his wife again.
This time Coyote decided to follow Buffalo’s command. But before they ar
rived at his home, Coyote was getting hungry. He decided to kill his wife and
eat her. Coyote told her to go one way up a ravine and he would go the other so
he could hunt. However, he ran around the hill and was at the top before his
wife climbed that far. Coyote shot and killed her. Then he cut her up and spread
out her hide to dry.
Before he got around to enjoying any of the meat, he decided he had to defe
cate. But, he could not have a movement and was seized with pains and unable
to get up. About that time, Magpie came and sat on the carcass, and then other
birds and animals came as well. Coyote called them names but they kept on de
vouring the meat until the bones were clean. Finally, they all left. Then Coyote
finally was able to defecate, but he was angry at his dung and beat it with a
stick because it had caused him to lose all that meat.
He followed the animals’ tracks and found a few bones and his wife’s blad
der. He roasted the bones and scraped the marrow into the bladder. Then he tied
the bladder shut and put it aside to cool while he rested. He checked on it sev
eral times, but it was still hot. Coyote then decided to cool it off in a pool of
water. But it still was taking a long time to cool off. He saw a muskrat swim
ming nearby and asked him to take the bladder and dive to the bottom of the
pool so the marrow would cool and harden. The Coyote stomped his foot and
scared Muskrat, who dove into the water. Coyote thought that was a lot of fun
and decided to stomp his foot again when Muskrat returned. However, when he
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 59



did it the second time, Muskrat jerked his head suddenly and the bladder tore.
The contents of the bladder poured out onto the water.
Coyote jumped into the water to save the marrow, but all he got was hands
full of water.
In the end Coyote had lost his wife and his food. If he had not been so foolish
and had taken his wife home, there would have been buffalo all over the land. But
now buffaloes do not venture any farther west than where Coyote killed his wife.
And now some lakes have an oily surface because the marrow spilled on the water.

BUTTERFLY
Butterflies are numerous in the mythology of Native Americans. The butterfly
was an especially prominent figure in Hopi myth and ritual, occurring fre
quently on their prehistoric pottery in a ritual Butterfly Dance. There is a but
terfly clan in one of the Hopi pueblos and a Hopi butterfly kachina.
The Navajo story cycle known as Ajilee tells of the origin of butterflies and
features a hero that appears in a butterfly disguise. In a Jicarilla story of the
emergence, beautiful butterflies lure girls from the underworld. A Zuni kachina,
Paiyatemu, has a flute from which butterflies come forth as it is played.
The sheer beauty of many butterflies is explained in a legend of the Tohono
O’Odham. According to this myth, the Creator, watching some children at play
in a village, started to feel sorry for them when he realized that their destiny was
to grow old and become wrinkled, fat, blind, weak, and gray-haired. The thought
that the puppies he saw would age and grow mangy saddened him, as well as the
knowledge that the flowers would fade and the leaves would fall with the com
ing winter. So, to gladden his heart, and give the children something to enjoy, he
gathered beautiful colors from various sources such as the sunlight, leaves, flow
ers, and the sky. He put them into a magical bag, together with the songs of
birds, and presented it to the children. When the children opened it, hundreds of
colored butterflies flew out and thoroughly enchanted them, as they had never
seen anything so lovely. These butterflies also sang, which further delighted the
children. However, the songbirds became jealous and complained to the Creator
because the butterflies were so beautiful and could sing. The Creator agreed that
the songs belonged to the birds and took away the butterflies’ ability to sing.
This is why butterflies are so beautifully colored but now silent.
Handbook of Native American Mythology

The origin of the first butterfly is told in the White Mountain Apache leg
end of the Flower Maiden, a story that emphasizes the importance of the role of
obligation:
Long ago lived a young girl named Yu-Ti, which means “beautiful maiden.”
As the first-born child of the tribal medicine man and his wife, she was ac
corded special responsibilities. Because she was beautiful and possessed gifts
and talents much sought after in a bride, she had many eager suitors among the
braves of her camp. Few, however, compared with the tribe’s two favorites.
The first was Ko-So-Wa, which means “hidden love.” He was full of vigor,
and excelled in running, climbing, and swimming. He was a powerful fighter with
weapons and a skilled hunter and trapper. He had loved Yu-Ti since childhood.
The second was To-Mo-Ka, which means “iron courage.” He, too, was a
powerful hunter, warrior, and trapper, and, though not as handsome as Ko-So
Wa, he was still attractive. He had won the admiration and respect of the tribe
during a confrontation with a wolf that had invaded the Ndee camp and almost
killed a small child. Like Ko-So-Wa, he was considered a worthy candidate for
Yu-Ti’s hand.
Because Yu-Ti was the daughter of the medicine man, and his firstborn, she
was not free to marry just anyone, because she was considered an extraordinary
woman. According to custom, a special contest would be held to select a new
chief, and her husband was to be chosen for her from among the champions. Yu
Ti was obliged to marry the winner, for his victory showed that he had special
qualities that would mean a prosperous future for their people following their
union.
An announcement was made that a husband would be sought for Yu-Ti
during the celebration of the harvest, on the first day of the new moon. Each
brave was eligible for the chance to win the hand of the most beautiful woman
of the tribe and become the new chief. The young men, ready for the contest to
begin, eagerly assembled in the center of the camp, dressed in their most im
pressive regalia.
The first trial was a running test, which required a brave to chase after a
wild horse on foot and return it to camp. This could take several days and a
great deal of endurance. Both Ko-So-Wa and To-Mo-Ka brought their horses
back to camp after just two days.
The second trial required a brave to swim to the deepest part of a swiftly
flowing river and retrieve a specific colored stone from the bottom. The few who
successfully met this difficult challenge included both Ko-So-Wa and To-Mo-Ka.
The third trial tested the braves’ skill and cleverness. They were sent into
the woods with only one arrow and their bows, and asked to return with a hunt
ing trophy that would feed a family. Game was scarce and difficult to find, since
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 61



this was the time when herds were moving. After a week, only Ko-So-Wa and
To-Mo-Ka each returned with a large stag. Thus concluded the first trials, and it
looked as though the winner would be selected from among the two of them.
The second phase of the trials began with a contest in which each of the
braves was required to defend himself, unarmed, against several opponents at
once, opponents who were armed with war clubs. Ko-So-Wa and To-Mo-Ka both
disarmed their adversaries and were the ones left to face the final test.
At this time, Yu-Ti prepared her bridal dress and the people prepared for a
celebration. Her heart belonged to Ko-So-Wa, and she hoped that he would win.
However, she believed that To-Mo-Ka was a great warrior and she felt warmly
toward him. Should he prevail when the contest was over, she was prepared to
bury her feelings for Ko-So-Wa and marry To-Mo-Ka as required.
The final and most important trial was called the Gift of the Sky Father.
Each brave who had come this far was obliged to go to the Spirit Mountain and
bring back a spirit prize that would be presented to the medicine man in ex
change for his daughter. In times past, such prizes included a herd of captured
mountain sheep, an eagle, or the body of a great bear. Such prizes were rare and
special, and it was thought they were awarded only by the Giver of Life himself.
Ko-So-Wa and To-Mo-Ka left for the mountain, while the tribe prayed that
one would be blessed by the Great Spirit. A sad and troubled Yu-Ti waited for
them to return. Finally, after many days and nights, Ko-So-Wa returned with a
majestic, wondrous gift and presented it to the tribe: a white baby buffalo. The
tribe cheered with joy, as here was a sacred animal they believed would protect
them from all enemies.
To-Mo-Ka returned several days later, and the people eagerly gathered
around him to see with what he had returned. He unveiled a colorfully painted
drum, which many felt was a gift unworthy of Yu-Ti. Everyone, including the
chief and the medicine man, felt that Ko-So-Wa was the clear winner.
As people started to walk away, To-Mo-Ka proclaimed that he had spoken
with the Great Spirit. He declared that, from that day onward, there would be
no more dry seasons, as the people would be blessed with plenty of rain. To dis
pel their doubts, he withdrew from a small pouch a brightly-painted drumstick,
sat down, and began to beat the drum with a slow cadence. As soon as To-Mo
Ka began to chant, the rains started to fall. The people were astonished, then
impressed and delighted at the thought of always having the rain they needed
for the harvest. Truly, both of the warriors had been blessed, but who was the
most worthy of Yu-Ti? Who would be chosen for her husband?
The decision was not to be made, as the contest was interrupted when the
tribe was forced to go to war with savage invaders from the north. Yu-Ti and all
the other women who expected to marry during the celebration had to wait.

After many months had passed, and many battles fought, the Ndee gained
the final victory. However, it was not without the loss of many dead, including
Ko-So-Wa and To-Mo-Ka. Yu-Ti was crushed, and her people shared her sorrow.
Her tears were endless, and it was difficult for anyone to console her. Finally,
she told her people she could not rest until their bodies were found and given a
proper burial.
Yu-Ti left her village and searched the battle sites that had been revealed to
her by the chief. Discouraged, she prayed to the Great Spirit for guidance, who
told her that he had covered the bodies of those who had fallen with soil and
grass to hide the terrible sight of their bloodstained bodies. Yu-Ti despaired of
ever finding them, and the Great Spirit took pity on her. He decided to give her
the chance to find her lost ones and told Yu-Ti that he hereby ordered the shield
design and color of each warrior to display as flowers, so that she could recog
nize the resting place of her Ko-So-Wa and To-Mo-Ka. But the Great Spirit real
ized that Yu-Ti would never live long enough to complete her search of every
battlefield. Thus, he transformed her into a lovely butterfly, so that her spirit
could return to wander and search among the flowers for her beloved warriors,

CANNIBAL DWARFS
Arapaho, Plains
Cannibals were featured in the myths of a number of North American tribal
groups, such as the Heiltsuk (Bella Bella), Eskimo, and the Nez Percé. Arapaho
myths that focused on “Little People” often characterized them as being canni
balistic. The following tale relates how an ingenious man outsmarted one of
them.
A man was hunting by himself along a river. Eventually he came to a place
where he could see smoke back in the woods and decided to find out where it
was coming from. When he got deeper into the woods, he saw a tipi. As he ap
proached it, he heard a voice from inside saying, “Someone is coming. Someone
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 63



is here. Someone wants to come in.” So the man went inside. There he saw a
small man—a dwarf—who was blind.
The dwarf was very pleased to have this visitor arrive and said, “You are a
good person to bring yourself to me so I can eat you.” The man replied yes, that
indeed had been his intention. He also told his host that he was a very fat man,
so the dwarf and all of his family would enjoy eating him. Then the man sug
gested that the dwarf get started right away with the meal preparations. But the
dwarf wanted to wait for the rest of his family to come home first. So the man
agreed to wait patiently.
In the meantime, however, the man went outside and found a stick that he
sharpened on one end. When he returned to the tipi, the man asked the dwarf,
“What are these things hanging around the walls of your tipi?” The dwarf ex
plained that they were the hearts of all of his relatives. The man asked, “This
first one, then, whose heart is it?” The blind dwarf answered that it belonged to
his father. So the man pierced it with his stick. Now the dwarf’s family was
away on a hunt, and at the exact time when the man pierced the first heart, the
dwarf’s father dropped dead. Then the man inquired about the second heart and
was told that it belonged to the dwarf’s mother. Again, he pierced it with his
sharpened stick and the woman dropped dead. One by one the man went around
the tipi wall, inquiring about the owner of each heart. When the dwarf named
the heart’s owner, the man pierced it and the owner dropped dead while away
on the hunting trip.
Finally there was only one heart left. The man asked to whom it belonged. The
dwarf responded, “It is my own heart.” So the man pierced it and the dwarf dropped
dead on the spot. The man who killed the cannibal dwarfs was a great hero.
Other Arapaho tales describe instances when cannibal dwarfs kidnapped
young women, or at least tried to, in order to take them as wives. One myth
about cannibal dwarfs depicted them as being about three feet tall, with dark
skin, large stomachs, and a powerful build. These dwarfs supposedly had homes
hewn from rocks. They were fast runners and could easily catch an Arapaho
trying to flee from them. One man, however, did manage to escape by jumping
across a stream that was too wide for the dwarf chasing him to hurdle.
Eventually, the raids by the dwarfs were claiming too many lives, so the
people decided to rid their land of them once and for all. The Indians sur
rounded the dwarfs, who were trapped in the bottom of a gorge, and set the
brush on the canyon walls on fire. As the fire raced toward them, the dwarfs
tried to figure out how best to save their wives and children. One dwarf sug
gested burying them in the sand; another suggested putting them in the stream
that flowed through the gorge. Finally, they decided that the best place for them
was high up in the trees. However, as the fire raced down through the gorge, it

64



burned the underbrush and everything in its path. When the fire reached the
trees, it continued up the trunks and consumed the trees and all of the dwarfs
in them. None of them escaped, and that is why there are no cannibal dwarfs
around today.

CANNIBAL WOMAN
Alsea, Kwakiutl, Northwest Coast
The Dzonokwa was a hideous looking giantess who carried children away to
her home deep in the forest. Kwakiutl parents warned their children what
would happen to them if she caught them alone. Adults feared the Dzonokwa,
too, and blamed their nightmares on her. The Alsea have a similar legend about
A’sin, the Monster Girl of the Woods, who was feared by all. Anyone who disap
peared was believed to have been carried off by her. Children were rarely left
alone, since they were especially vulnerable.
Among the Kwakiutl tales about the Cannibal Woman is one that relates
her demise.
The chief of a certain village had a daughter who had recently become a
woman. The princess stayed in her small hut observing all of the necessary
taboos for sixteen days and then returned to her father’s house. There her eye
brows were plucked in the fashion of the women of her tribe.
One day the princess walked alone in the woods. Her father scolded her and
reminded her that the Dzonokwa might catch her and carry her off. However,
the young woman disobeyed her father and again went on a long walk near the
river. There she saw a large woman who invited her to her house. But the
princess declined, saying she feared that the Cannibal Woman would find her.
Dzonokwa then spoke in a flattering tone, complimenting the princess about
her beautiful eyebrows. The princess replied that her eyebrows had been cut.
The Cannibal Woman asked her to bring the person who cut them to her so she
could also have beautiful eyebrows.
The princess protested, saying that it would be very painful to have done.
However, the giantess insisted and gave the princess gifts of clothing and
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 65



jewelry. Dzonokwa told the princess to
put them on and then she would be
come strong also. So the young woman
put on the gifts and then said that they
would have to go to her father’s house
so that the man who cut her eyebrows
could do the same for Dzonokwa.
On the way Dzonokwa asked if the
people of the girl’s tribe would hurt her.
The princess assured her that they
would not. When they entered the
chief’s house, the princess told her fa
ther that the Dzonokwa had come and
wanted her eyebrows cut so they would
be beautiful also. She said to her father,
“Please go out and bring back the man
who cut my eyebrows, so he may come
and cut hers.”
The chief went out and called for
his warrior to sharpen his stone chisel
and to bring it and a stone hammer to
the chief’s house. The warrior was in
structed to cut through the Dzonokwa’s
eyebrows and kill her. When he arrived,
the princess said, “This is the man who
made my eyebrows beautiful.” The
warrior spoke to the Cannibal Woman
and asked her not to scream. She as
sured him that she wouldn’t mind the
pain. He then instructed her to lay back so he could cut her eyebrows quickly
and get back to his work. “And shut your eyes,” he said, “so you won’t see the
point of my eyebrow cutter.”
When the Dzonokwa closed her eyes, the warrior quickly hammered his
chisel into her forehead and killed her. They cut off her head and burned her
body. Afterward, the chief asked his daughter if she had seen the Cannibal
Woman’s home. “Yes,” she said, “and there are many things in the house.” So
they traveled to the Dzonokwa’s home and saw many articles of clothing,
tanned hides, blankets, and dried meat. In the bedroom the princess found a
beautiful mask that had red cedar bark twisted around it and an eagle’s nest on
top. The Chief called it the Nightmare-Bringer-Nest-Mask.

When they returned to their village, the chief gave away the tanned hides
that he had found in the house. He became known as Dzonokwa Chief because
he had killed the Dzonokwa and claimed the Nightmare Bringer’s mask and be
longings for his people.

CANNIBALISM
Mythological narratives may explain the origins of the earth as we know it or
tell us about the stars, sun, and the moon. Others describe the relationship be
tween humans and the natural world we live in. Still others instruct or warn
about certain behaviors or characteristics to avoid, such as cannibalism—con
sidered by many cultures as one of the most evil crimes that can be committed.
Strictly speaking, cannibalism is eating the flesh of ones’ own kind.
Cannibalism is known to occur in the animal world, but it is especially disturb
ing when found to be practiced by humans.
Myths describing cannibalistic atrocities are found throughout the world,
with the perpetrators appearing as humans, ghosts, giants, or other monsters.
Several Native North American cannibal myths describe humans who became
cannibals after tasting fresh blood, often their own, as in the following Nez
Perce tale from the Coyote cycle.
There were five brothers, the eldest of whom was married. Every morning
they would go out hunting together and, as was the custom among their people,
they would share the meat they brought back from the hunt with their neigh
bors and relatives. One day when the brothers were out hunting, the eldest shot
a deer. It didn’t die right away, but ran down a hillside and into a canyon. The
elder brother followed it until the deer collapsed. There he butchered the car
cass. While doing this, he accidentally cut himself. Some of his blood got on the
meat and when he ate it, something came over him. He wasn’t interested in the
deer any longer. He thought the new taste was delicious and wanted more.
When he realized where the new blood was coming from, he cut off a piece of
himself and ate it. This made him want even more, so he kept cutting away and
eating his own flesh until finally he was just bones.
That evening when everyone had returned from hunting, the youngest
brother said, “Our oldest brother has not returned.” The word was sent through
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 67



the village, “Our brother is missing. Tomorrow morning we will all go looking
for him.” Early the next day, the people set off to find the lost brother, including
all four of his younger brothers. When they arrived at the place the brothers had
been hunting the day before, they all split up and searched through the hills and
the trees and called out for him. The second brother, who had been the last to
see the oldest brother, called out, “Older Brother, Older Brother!” Suddenly, the
second brother heard a voice calling him from down in the canyon, “Here I am,
younger brother.” So the second brother hurried down to see if his older brother
was hurt. He was startled to see a skeleton with bloody bones coming to meet
him, and he turned quickly to run away. But, he was not quick enough. With a
rope made of intestines, the older brother caught him and tied him up. The el
der brother killed and ate his younger brother, leaving only a pile of bones.
Later that evening, when everyone was returned from searching for the lost
oldest brother, they realized that the second brother was missing. It was an
nounced to the people that the second brother was now lost as well, and that
the third brother would go search for him in the morning. The third brother set
out early the next morning and again went to the place where the brothers had
all been hunting several days before. “Older Brother, Older Brother!” called the
third brother. Then he heard his brother call to him, “Here I am, come down
this way.” The third brother was happy to hear the sound of his oldest brother’s
voice and hurried down into the canyon. But when he saw the bloody skeleton,
he turned to run away. The oldest brother caught him with the intestine rope
and killed and ate him as before.
That evening when the third brother failed to return home, the people were
all alarmed. “Something strange has happened.” But they all thought perhaps
the brothers had all been in an accident and were all taking care of each other.
So they sent the fourth brother out the next morning by himself to find his lost
brothers. As his other brothers had done, this brother went to the area where
they had been hunting and called out, “Older Brother, Older Brother!”
“We’re all down here. Come down to us,” the Older Brother answered. So
the fourth brother ran down the side of the canyon, eager to see how his broth
ers were doing. But when the fourth brother saw the bloody skeleton of his old
est brother, he turned to run. Just as with his older brothers, he was caught by
the intestine rope, killed, and eaten. The oldest brother piled his bones along
with the others.
When the fourth brother did not return that evening, the people wondered
why all four brothers were missing. They agreed that the youngest brother
would have to go by himself on the following morning to find his brothers. So,
he set out very early in the morning and headed to the place where they had all
been hunting. On his way, he captured a meadowlark and inquired, “Aunt
Handbook of Native American Mythology
68



Meadowlark, can you tell me what has happened to my four brothers?”
Meadowlark explained about the oldest brother and that he had tasted his own
blood and it had made him crazy. She went on to tell that the oldest brother had
eaten himself down to the bones and that he had killed and eaten the other
brothers. Meadowlark then told the youngest brother how he could escape be
ing captured. He was to go to a certain place where he would find many pieces
of sharp flint. He was to tie pieces of the flint all over his legs. This way when
his oldest brother tried to catch him, the flint would cut the rope that had made
from intestines.
The youngest brother did exactly as Meadowlark had instructed and then
proceeded cautiously toward the canyon. He called out, “Older Brothers, Older
Brothers!” Soon he heard the voice of his oldest brother calling to him, “We’re
down here! Come down here with us.” The youngest brother walked slowly
down the path. Suddenly he saw the oldest brother looking just as Meadowlark
had warned. The youngest brother turned and began running back up the
canyon but was caught by the intestine rope. He nearly fell over but urged his
legs to keep going. Finally the flint pieces on his legs cut through the intestine
rope and he broke free. When he arrived back at his village, the youngest
brother quickly told the people what had happened and warned that the canni
bal brother would be coming for the rest of the people soon. “He will kill us all,
if we don’t leave,” the youngest brother warned.
Coyote announced that on the next morning they would all go east. So all
of the people packed up their belongings and prepared to leave. However, the
wife of the oldest brother refused to leave. She told them that she and their
small child would stay and wait for her husband to return. No amount of plead
ing would change her mind. So the people left the woman and her child behind
and fled to the east. One day, the woman heard her husband coming. He was
singing a strange song about killing and eating his brothers. When he arrived at
her tepee, he demanded the child, “Just one swallow, that’s all it will take.” The
woman quickly replied, “Let me take him down to the river to clean him up,
and then we will be back.” On her way out the door she grabbed a wooden
spoon. When she got to the riverbank, she asked the willows to answer, “Ho!”
when her husband called after her. Then she ordered the spoon to turn into a ca
noe. When it did, she placed her child in it and then climbed in herself and hur
ried down stream to join their people.
Eventually, her husband wondered what was taking so long and called for
her to come back to the tepee. The willows replied, “Ho!” After several times,
the cannibal husband realized that it wasn’t his wife’s voice and went to the
river to see what taking so long. His wife and child were gone, but he vowed to
find them.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 69



When the woman arrived at the new village, she quickly told the people
what had happened and warned that her husband was now very vicious. A plan
was made. Crane was buried in the dirt at the top of a cliff. When the oldest
brother came along, Crane stuck his legs out and kicked the cannibal over the
cliff and killed him. All of his bones tumbled down the cliff and ended up in a
heap at the bottom. So Crane went back to the people and told them that the
cannibal was dead.

CORN
Corn is featured in numerous myths across most of the Americas. Known in
much of the world as maize, corn appears to have originated in Mexico or
Central America and, over the past several thousand years, has evolved from a
wild grass to the domesticated varieties grown around the world today. Whether
the change was due to evolution, cultivation, or a combination of both is still
being debated in scientific circles. But the significance of corn and other crops
for the development of civilization in the Americas is undeniable.
Agriculture is more labor intensive than hunting and gathering. Fields must
be guarded, watered, and weeded. Crops must be planted and harvested. Storage
containers must be created. Both the work and workers must be organized and
supervised.
As farming became more prevalent, small hunting and gathering bands
evolved into villages and more people were available to help with chores, which
resulted in the need for more crops to be raised.
The Origin of Corn
Several myths describe corn being created as the result of a woman’s death. In
one story from the Cherokee, two hungry young boys secretly watched their
mother, Selu, harvest corn and beans for their meal by rubbing her stomach and
armpits. The boys were appalled and thought she must be a witch. When they
Handbook of Native American Mythology
70



threatened to kill her, the woman
instructed them, “When you have
killed me, clear a large area near the
house. Then drag my body around
the circle seven times. Keep watch
on the field overnight.” The boys
did as they were instructed and by
morning corn stalks with mature
ears had grown in that place.
A Malecite version with a simi
lar ending was reported by Mechling.
In olden times, before the
people had crops, an old chief had
several beautiful daughters. One of
the girls had golden hair. A stranger
came to the village and in time fell
in love with the golden haired girl.
They married and lived together a
long time. When she was old and
about to die, she said to her hus
band, “If you want to have me with
you always, just do as I tell you.”
The man didn’t want to part from
his wife, so he did exactly as she
said. First he cut down the trees
near their home and then he burned
the timber. Next, his wife had in
structed him to tie her hands with
cedar bark and drag her around the
clearing seven times, but he was
not to look back. When he finished doing this, the man looked back and saw just
a skeleton remaining. The woman’s flesh had been torn off by the tree stumps.
The man was heartbroken and moved away immediately. But at the end of the
summer, he wished to see the place again. To his amazement, the once charred
field was now filled with corn the color of his wife’s golden hair. Then he re
membered that she had promised to be with him always.
Goodwin related a story about how the White Mountain Apache first re
ceived corn.
Long, long ago, when the animals all talked like people, Turkey overheard a
boy and a girl talking about not having any food. So he shook himself, and all
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 71

wall, ca. 1500, Tiguex (Kuaua Pueblo) on the Rio
Grande, New Mexico. (North Wind Picture Archives)



sorts of fruits and other food fell out of his feathers. The boy and girl ate all of
it. Then Turkey shook himself again and four different kinds of corn fell out.
The children ate some of it but saved the rest for seed. He showed them a place
to plant the corn seed. The plants grew very quickly. The boy and girl also
planted squash seeds. Then they asked Turkey for more corn to plant.
While they went to plant seeds in another field, Turkey stayed behind with
their first crop. When they returned they heard Turkey hollering in the field and
they saw that the plants had grown very tall. Turkey told them to keep back be
cause snakes had come into the field for the corn tassel pollen. He said to wait
four days and then the snakes would be gone. When they finally were able to
get into their cornfield, the boy and girl found that all of the corn was ripe.
Turkey explained that this was the only time that corn would ripen in just four
days. Afterward it would take much longer. And so it has been ever since.
Marie McLaughlin related the Dakota (Sioux) tale “The Hermit, or the Gift
of Corn.”
A man lived alone, far from his people’s village. He spent his time studying
plants and roots to learn which could be used as food and which could be used
as medicine. One night, just as he was dozing off, he realized a dark object was
in his tent. It had something like a flint arrow in its hand and said, “I have
come to invite you to my home.” The hermit agreed to go, but when he got out
side, he could not tell which way the mysterious object had gone. The next
night the same thing happened. But the man decided to find out what this
strange visitor wanted him to do.
On the following night, the hermit cut a hole in the side of his tent and
stuck an arrow through it. He waited and soon the dark object came to the door
and said, “I have come to. . . .” Before the sentence was complete, the hermit
shot his arrow. It sounded as if the arrow had struck a bag full of pebbles. In the
morning when it was light enough, the man saw a small pile of corn outside his
door. There was a trail of corn leading away. The hermit followed the corn until
he reached a spot where the grass had been scraped off leaving a circular area of
bare ground. The trail of corn stopped at the edge of the circle.
The hermit realized it must be the home of the mysterious object that
wanted him to follow. Using his bone ax and a knife, the man dug into the soil.
He dug until he reached a sack of dried meat. Then he found a sack of turnips,
one of cherries, and another with corn. Finally he found another sack. This one
had only a small amount of corn in it along with the hermit’s arrow. The hermit
realized the meaning of the corn and the pit with the food. He taught the people
how to keep their food safe while they were away traveling. He told them to dig
a deep hole to bury their sacks and baskets of food. The people thanked him for
instructing them how to preserve their food, and also for giving them corn.

The Three Sisters
Corn, beans, and squash are often planted together. Several kernels of corn are
planted in “hills” where the soil has been mounded up. After the young corn
stalks have been growing for several weeks, bean seeds are planted in each hill
along with the corn. Squash seeds are also planted around the hills. Each of the
three plants requires different nutrients from the soil. As the plants grow, the
corn stalks become a trellis or stake for the bean vines and the large leaves of
the squash cover the ground forming both a weed barrier and a moisture con
serving shade for the soil.
Beauchamp reported in “Indian Corn Stories and Customs” that the
Iroquois referred to corn, beans, and pumpkin (squash) as “Our Life, or Our
Supporters.” Beauchamp also described an Onondaga story told by Joseph Lyon.
A lonely young man lived alone on a hill. Each morning and evening he
stood outside his house and sang, calling for someone to marry. Finally a lovely
young woman came along and said she would marry him. But he refused, saying
that she wandered too far from home and would not stay by his side. Finally,
another young woman heard the man singing and approached his house. The
slender young woman saw his fine looking robe and long plumes and said that
she would marry him if he would love her in return. The man knew this young
woman was the one he had waited for. They embraced, and since that time the
corn stalk has supported the bean vine and the pumpkin roams all around them
on the ground.
A narrative collected by Curtin and Hewitt, and titled “The Weeping of the
Corn, and Bean, and Squash People,” tells of an event from the “olden time.”
An Iroquois village was situated in a fertile region. The people grew abun
dant crops of corn, beans, and squash. However, it came about that the crops be
gan to fail and the game became scarce and the people became hungry. One day
an old woman was walking near her fields, contemplating the dire situation,
when she heard weeping coming from the field. She walked out among the
shriveled corn, bean, and squash plants and, stopping next to a corn plant,
asked, “Why are you weeping?” The corn explained that the people had not
cared for the crops in the manner required. “The people do not cover us up well
enough and do not make hills to give our roots a strong support. They do not
give us enough water, and they allow our enemies to attack us and strangle us
to death.”
The old woman was distraught and returned home in tears. When the
people of her village heard her weeping, they were moved to join in her grief. At
last the chief of the people approached the old woman and asked what was
causing her so much distress. After a time the old woman was able to explain.
She told the chief and all of the people that she had heard weeping coming from
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 73



the field. When she went to investigate, the corn plant told her that the people
were not caring for the crops in the proper manner.
Then the chief met with the council and it was decided that from that time
on, whoever planted corn or beans or squash was to cover the seeds with suffi
cient soil. The gardener must also dig around the hills in order for the water to
nourish the roots. And lastly, the crops were to be guarded so that their ene
mies, the weeds, would not choke them out.
When planting time came in the spring, the people took great care to do
just as instructed. The crops grew well, but as harvest approached, someone
came to the fields and began stealing the corn and beans and squashes. The
people were greatly distressed and wondered what they had done wrong. The
next spring came and the crops were planted again. However, near harvest time
thieves began to steal the corn from the fields again. One evening, the people
then sent warriors to guard the fields. In the morning they saw certain strangers
who were stripping ears off the cornstalks and gathering beans and squashes.
The warriors captured the thieves. Every day these prisoners were brought out
so the people could whip them. Eventually corn thieves led the people to their
village far away. There the warriors killed many of the enemy but set the cap
tives free. Then they were ordered to split the lips of the squash thieves so they
could not eat squash again. The corn thieves who were released had stripes on
their backs and rings around their eyes and tails from the beatings they re
ceived. They were the raccoons. The squash thieves who had their lips split
were the rabbits.
A Selection of Other Stories Featuring Corn
A Tuscarora myth tells of a time long ago when the people were blessed with
abundant harvests. They eventually began taking the situation for granted.
They neglected the fields, wasted much of the food, and failed to store the corn
carefully. They even forgot to thank their Creator for all he had provided for
them. One man, however, did not forget how to carefully tend and harvest his
crop, and he stored a portion of the kernels in well-constructed baskets. His
name was Dayohagwenda. It caused him great pain to see how disrespectful the
people had become. One day, while the man was walking in the woods and
thinking about the way the people acted, he came to a trail that led to a lodge
built on a hill. Weeds grew all around the lodge. Outside was an old man in
ragged clothes who sat on the ground weeping. Dayohagwenda asked the old
man, “Grandfather, why are you weeping?” The old man replied that he wept
because the people had forgotten him. “Grandfather, why are your clothes
torn?” The old man said, “Because the people had tossed him to the dogs.”
Dayohagwenda then asked, “Why are you so dirty?” The old man said,
Handbook of Native American Mythology
74



“Because the people let their children run over me.” Again, Dayohagwenda
asked, “Why do the weeds grow around your house?” To this the old man
replied, “Because the people do not take care of me. Because of this I am going
away and will not return.”
Dayohagwenda then pleaded with the old man to stay, and promised that
he would return to the people and remind them to show respect and honor. So
the old man agreed, “If the people will show me respect, I will not leave them.”
Dayohagwenda returned to his village and gathered the people. He told them
about the lodge with the weeds growing around it, and about the old man with
the torn clothing who said that the people had dishonored him so he would
leave them.
The people knew it was the Corn Spirit and that if he left them, they would
die. Dayohagwenda reassured them that the Corn Spirit would not leave them
as long as they remembered to honor him and respect his gift of corn. Then
Dayohagwenda uncovered his storage baskets. There was enough corn to last
the people through the winter, and there was still enough left to plant crops
again in the spring. Dayohagwenda and the people continued to show respect
for the corn by tending the crops and carefully storing a portion to last through
the winter. They gave thanks to the Corn Spirit and taught their children to do
the same.
The Pueblo tale “Why Crows Like Corn,” related by Espinosa, explains
why crows are frequently found in cornfields. Long ago the Great Star and his
brother, Morning Star, gave corn to the People and they planted it just as they
were instructed. At that time, cornstalks grew quickly and the ears matured
within five days. One day a hungry horned owl flew over the land looking for
something to eat. When he reached the cornfield, he was very curious, as he had
never seen these plants before.
The horned owl sat in a nearby tree to study the situation. Soon he saw an
other bird in the field and asked, “Crow, what is that plant?” Crow shouted
back, “It’s corn, and it belongs to me.” Now the horned owl was uncertain
about this, because Crow frequently played practical jokes. After thinking
awhile, Owl finally proposed a test. “Maybe it is your corn. Let’s take some of it
and roast it on a bed of coals. If it is sweet, then I’ll know that it is your corn.”
So, the two flew off to Crow’s home with two ears of corn. They started a
fire, and when the coals were hot, roasted the corn. The real test came when the
corn was ready to eat. Owl took a bite and then another. “This is delicious and
sweet tasting! I’m convinced now that the corn is yours.”
Since that time, crows are often found in cornfields. But they only like
sweet corn. So if a field of corn does not have crows in it, the People can tell
that the corn is not sweet. According to what has been told for many years, the

horned owl declared that the People would plant corn near their pueblos and
the crows would be not be afraid to visit the fields. The owl also warned the
crows to eat the corn in moderation.

COYOTE
Coyote is a complex, contradictory, and colorful figure that exists in virtually
all Native American cultural traditions. Always male, his counterpart was
Manabozho or Great Hare among Eastern tribes; in the Pacific Northwest, it
was Raven. The Navajo call him Ma?ii; the Kiowa, Sendeh. A personality of
myth and legend among various peoples since Paleolithic times, literally hun
dreds of Native American stories feature Coyote, and he now appears widely in
the poetry and prose of contemporary writers.
Providing or obtaining a distinct conception of the multidimensional
Coyote is difficult. The prototypical trickster, he is at times deceitful, dishon
est, cunning, shrewd, irreverent, curious, lazy, unpredictable, gluttonous, cruel,
erotic, lecherous, clownish, or stupid. He frequently suffers the consequences of
his own mischief. Coyote is sometimes an animal, sometimes a man who can
be either old and ugly or young and handsome. Magically powerful, he is able to

76



create and transform, and often proves indestructible. Coyote stories were told
to entertain young and old alike, to dramatize and convey the value of appropri
ate behavior, to instruct listeners in survival and getting along with each other,
and to provide a sense of tribal identity.
Coyote occasionally assumes the role of beneficent culture hero, though
sometimes the elements of life and culture he introduces have a negative as
pect. The stories of several tribes reveal that Coyote brought the first fire, ar
ranged the seasons, introduced salmon and taught how to catch and cook it, in
troduced work and suffering, played a role in the origin of Europeans, taught
how to make bows and arrows, and introduced death to prevent overpopulation.
Many Coyote stories detail his erotic and incestuous adventures, complete
with references to bodily functions and his insatiable sex drive. In a Navajo
myth, Coyote tricks Younger Brother in order to sleep with his wife. Another
Navajo story tells how Coyote is able to exchange skins with the unsuspecting
hero and sleep with the man’s wives, since the Coyote skin debilitates the man.
In a Kawaiisu story, Coyote’s lust is expressed through his attempts to have sex
with three women by pretending he is a woman with a baby, though the “baby”
is actually his penis. The Nez Percé tell of the widower Coyote’s desire for his
five daughters and how he tricks the eldest into marrying him. Coyote is

credited with removing vaginal teeth in a number of stories, thereby explaining
the origin of pleasure in sexual intercourse.
In other stories, nothing is beyond Coyote’s powers, and he is credited with
creating and transforming the West. He caused the Columbia River to form and
gouged out Hell’s Canyon along the Snake River. He changed animal beings
into Beacon Rock, Rooster Rock, Latourell Falls, Mist Falls, and Horsetail Falls
along the lower Columbia. Coyote created Mount Chopaka and two other peaks
of the Okanogan Highlands from three young warriors. Coyote built waterfalls
in several Washington rivers to keep salmon from reaching areas inhabited by
people who refused his attentions toward their beautiful women. He changed
the course of the Klamath River so that it runs only downstream instead of up
stream on one side and downstream on the other.
In the following story of the White Mountain Apache, “Turkey Makes the
Corn and Coyote Plants It,” Coyote as trickster is foolish, lazy, and mis
chievous—the ultimate example of what not to be.
A long time ago, when animals could talk like people do, Turkey overheard
a boy begging his sister for food. Turkey asked the girl what her brother wanted,
and she explained that he was hungry, but they had nothing to eat. When Turkey
heard this, he shook himself all over. Various kinds of wild food and fruits
dropped out of his feathers, and the brother and sister ate them up. Turkey shook
himself yet again, and corn dropped out of his feathers. This corn was a variety
that is very large. Turkey shook himself a third time, and yellow corn dropped
out. When he shook himself a fourth time, white corn dropped out.
Bear saw what was happening, and came over. Turkey told him that he was
helping to feed his sister and brother. Bear observed that it took Turkey four
shakes to make food come out of him, but he had every kind of food on him,
from his head to his feet. Bear then shook himself, and out of his fur dropped ju
niper berries. He shook himself again, and out dropped a type of cactus that is
good to eat. He then shook out acorns, piñon nuts, a species of sumac, another
kind of cactus, other acorns, more berries, then saguaro fruit.
Turkey told the boy and girl that he had four kinds of corn seeds for them
and showed them a good place to plant them. The boy and girl made holes in
the ground and planted all of their corn seeds in them. The next day, the corn
had come up and was already about a foot and a half high. They still had some
squash seeds, so they planted those too. The boy and girl asked Turkey for more
corn seed. Turkey gave them the seed so they could make another farm and
plant more corn. The boy and girl left him to look after their first farm while
they started their second.
When they returned, they found Turkey hollering at the cornfield. Snakes
had come to gather pollen from the tassels on the corn plants, so Turkey pre

78



tended to have a broken wing and dragged it along the ground as he made noise
in an attempt to protect the boy and girl and lure the snakes away. Turkey
warned them to stay away from the corn for four days, at which time the
snakes would be finished. At the end of the four days, the corn had ripened.
Turkey told them that this would be the only time when the corn would come
up in four days, and that, in the future, it would take much longer.
By now the brother and sister had planted corn three times, and they gave
seeds to others. Then Slim Coyote came and asked for some corn seeds so he
could plant them for himself. He observed that the corn they planted was grow
ing well and that the ears were coming out on it.
Coyote would need to do much work to raise corn, but that was not his de
sire. He decided he wanted to cook his corn first and then plant it, so he need
not cook it after it ripened. Here is where Coyote made a huge mistake. He did
indeed cook his corn first, ate some, and then planted a large patch of the rest.
He felt very proud, and bragged how well he had done for himself, expecting to
grow his already-cooked corn.
After planting his cooked corn, Coyote went off with the rest of the people
to gather acorns. When they returned to their fields, Coyote’s had nothing grow
ing at all. He angrily accused the others of removing the hearts from the corn
seeds they had given them. The people denied it and explained he was wrong to
cook the heart out of the seeds before planting them. Coyote asked for more
seeds and planted them the correct way. His corn grew, and the day after he
planted it, it had grown about a foot and a half. He felt very satisfied.
The people who had planted their corn at the beginning were harvesting
now and tying it up into bundles. Coyote saw these bundles and wanted some.
People became angry with Coyote because he was always asking them for
corn. He would always say he just wanted some green ears to feed his children
and made promises to give the corn back when his own was ripe. The other
people’s squashes were still growing in the field. Coyote stole their squash, and
the people came straight to his camp. They demanded to know if he was the
one who stole the squash. Coyote pretended to be very angry and indignantly
accused the others of always blaming him for stealing everything. He sug
gested people from other nearby camps could be the culprits. But the people
were not fooled; they knew about Coyote’s thieving ways and ordered him to
move away to live some other place. Coyote declared that he no longer in
tended to repay the corn he was given because of the way he had been ill
treated. So Coyote’s family lived poorly, and they never bothered to cook any
food before they ate it.
The Ponca story that follows, “Teeth in the Wrong Places,” is an example
of the many tales that tell of Coyote’s sexual adventures:
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 79



Coyote was roaming around, looking for adventure and great deeds to per
form, when he was told of an old woman, an evil sorceress who lived with her
two wicked but beautiful daughters. Many young men went to visit them and
sleep with the daughters, but they were never seen alive again. The one who
told him of this place warned him to be careful to not sleep with these girls, or
he would die. Coyote wondered how sleeping with two beautiful women would
kill a man, and off he went to find them.
When Coyote arrived at her tipi, he found the old woman was very nice to
him, and her daughters were as beautiful as he had heard. The mother invited
him in. She complimented him on his appearance, and told him that he was
just the kind of person she’d like to have for a son-in-law. Coyote entered the
tipi, and the mother invited him to sit down so her daughters could serve him
something good to eat. The girls brought Coyote much delicious food—buffalo
hump, tongues, all kinds of meat. The eldest daughter told him how handsome
he was. Coyote decided he did not believe what he had heard, that these were
good people.
By nightfall, Coyote was full of food, and becoming drowsy. The mother sug
gested he was tired after his journey, that it was cold outside. She encouraged him
to lie down to sleep between her two daughters, as they would keep him warm.
Coyote snuggled between the two girls. He felt amorous, but he wondered about
them. In the dark, the face of the younger girl brushed his; she whispered in his
ear and warned him that her sister would soon ask him to sleep with her. She told
him that he must not do it and explained that she was supposed to ask him to
sleep with her as well. Coyote asked her why she was telling him this. The girl
told Coyote that the old woman was a witch, that she was not really her mother.
She explained she was the woman’s prisoner, but the other girl was truly her
daughter, and the witch had put teeth into both of their vaginas. Coyote heard
that when a man came to visit, the witch would get him to copulate with the
girls, that these teeth took hold of his penis and chewed it to bits, and the man
would die. Afterwards, the woman would steal all of his things. Coyote did not
believe her until he heard the grinding of the sharp teeth within their vaginas.
Coyote and the girl pretended to sleep. After a while the older girl, the old
woman’s daughter, tugged at his sleeve and invited him to enter her. Coyote
could hear the teeth gnashing inside her vagina. He pretended that he desired
her, took hold of a thick, long stick that was still warm from the fire, and in
serted it into the girl’s vagina. The teeth inside of her were chewing, and wood
splinters were flying out of her all over Coyote. He quickly grabbed an arrow
from his quiver and thrust it deep inside the girl before the teeth could snap
shut. The teeth closed upon the shaft near the feathers, but the arrowhead had
already reached the evil girl’s heart, and she died.
Handbook of Native American Mythology

Then Coyote killed the wicked old woman with his knife. He told the
younger girl how grateful he was for saving his life, and invited her to marry
him. She reminded him that she had teeth in the wrong place, but Coyote as
sured her he would take care of that. They set out for Coyote’s house and
walked an entire day. When evening fell, Coyote built a brush shelter for the
two of them. He put sage into it for a bed. Coyote knocked out the teeth in the
girl’s vagina, leaving just one blunt tooth that was very thrilling when making
love. Coyote and the girl were very happy together afterwards.
“Coyote and the Monster of the Columbia” is an example of how many of
Coyote’s exploits are associated with the Columbia River basin. In this Klikitat
story, a monster that lived near Celilo Falls is rendered powerless, and Coyote
assumes the role of a creator by naming all the animals and birds.
While traveling, Coyote learned that a monster was killing the animal
people as they took their canoes up and down Big River. So many had been killed
that some were afraid to go down to the water, even to catch salmon. Coyote
promised to help stop the monster from killing the animal people. He had no
idea what to do, however, so he asked his three sisters, who lived in his stomach
in the form of huckleberries. They were very wise and knew everything.
At first, Coyote’s sisters refused to tell him what to do, because he would
claim it was his plan all along. Coyote threatened to send rain and hail down upon
them if they did not tell him, which of course the berries did not like. However,
the berries relented and told Coyote to take plenty of dry wood and plenty of pitch
with him so he could make a fire. They also recommended he take five sharp
knives. They explained that it was Nashlah at Wishram who was killing all the an
imal people, swallowing them as they passed in their canoes. The berries told
Coyote that he must allow himself to be swallowed by Nashlah as well.
Coyote gathered together some dry wood and pitch, as his sisters advised,
sharpened his knives, and went to the deep pool where Nashlah lived. Nashlah
saw Coyote but did not swallow him, for he knew that Coyote was a great chief.
Coyote called Nashlah many mean names, because he knew he could make
him very angry by teasing him. At last, the monster became so angry he took a
big breath and sucked Coyote into his mouth. Coyote grabbed an armful of
sagebrush just before entering and took it in.
Inside Nashlah, Coyote found many animal people, all of whom were cold
and hungry. Some were almost dead from hunger, some from the cold. Coyote
told the animal people he would build a fire and cook some food for them.
Using the sagebrush and pitch, he built a fire under the heart of the monster. As
they warmed themselves, Coyote declared that he would kill Nashlah. He as
sured the animal people he had come to help them and that they would soon
join their friends.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 81



Coyote cut pieces from Nashlah’s heart and roasted them. While the people
ate the heart, Coyote began to sever the cord that fastened the monster’s heart
to his body. He broke the first knife, but he kept cutting. He broke the second
knife, but he kept cutting. He broke his third and fourth knives as well. He cut
the last thread with his fifth knife, and Nashlah’s heart fell into the fire. Just as
the monster died, he gave one big cough and all of the animal people came out
on to the land.
The grateful animal people gathered around Coyote on the shore of the
river. He told them they would live a long time, and declared that he would
give each of them names. Coyote named the best and bravest bird Eagle, the
strongest animal Bear. The big medicine man with special powers became Owl.
The largest fish in the rivers was named Sturgeon, the best of all fish for eating
became Salmon. Coyote named Blue Jay, Beaver, Woodpecker, Deer, Cougar,
and all the other animals and birds. Then he named himself Coyote, the wisest
and smartest of all the animals.
Coyote then turned to Nashlah and laid down a new law. He sternly for
bade him to kill people as he had been doing. He informed him that a new race
of people was coming, that they would travel up and down the river. Coyote
told Nashlah he could kill one now and then, that he could shake the canoes if
they passed over him. Coyote explained that, for this reason, most of the canoes
would go around Nashlah’s pool and not pass over where he lived, so he would
kill very few of the new people. Coyote told Nashlah that this was to be the law
always, that he was no longer the powerful man he used to be.
The law Coyote made still stands, and the monster obeys it. He does not
swallow people like he did before Coyote took away his power. Sometimes he
draws a canoe under and swallows the people in it, but not often. The Indians
usually remove their canoes from the water and carry them round the place
where the monster lives, to avoid passing over his house. He still lives deep un
der the water, but he no longer possesses his great power.

CULTURE HERO(ES)
A culture hero is responsible for providing or creating distinctive aspects or ben
efits of a culture and the natural world through discovery or invention. A
Native American culture hero might be credited with the discovery of fire or
agriculture. He or she may set the sun on its course, create humans, plants, and
animals, or teach rituals and ceremonies. A culture hero may also be a deliverer
who, for example, rids the world of the monsters that make it uninhabitable.
The trickster character and the culture hero are sometimes combined in Native
American mythology. The culture hero may give life to humans and bring them
important features of their culture, but the cunning, thieving, or lustful urges
he or she may possess give the culture hero a life of his or her own.
Culture heroes often appear in creation stories, though they usually belong
to a world that already exists. Culture heroes may assume diverse forms; they
may be human or animal, man or woman, young or old. They almost always
have proper names and transformational abilities. A culture hero may have a
non-human parent, and his or her birth may be surrounded by unusual circum
stances. He or she often has a younger twin brother, and some have animal sib
lings, such as a moose or wolf.
Native American mythology features literally hundreds of culture heroes, a
rich, diverse array that often reflects Native Americans’s respect for and con
nection with nature. The Haida character Sin brings snow; the Milky Way and
the pumpkin plant are the creation of a Seminole culture hero known as
Hisagita misa, or Breath Maker.
In a story of the Montagnais, a wolverine causes the creation of rocks:
At one time, there were no rocks in the world, only one very large boulder.
Wolverine approached it and boldly declared he could outrun it. The boulder
agreed that was probably true and told Wolverine that he had been sitting in
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 83



that one place for as long as he could remember. Wolverine seemed surprised.
He told the boulder that even Lemming and Ant could run, and that he must be
the lowest of the low if he really could not. Wolverine then gave the boulder a
kick. The boulder did not like this, or Wolverine’s insults, so it started rolling
toward him. Wolverine continued to laugh at the boulder and started running
away, down a hill, with the boulder rolling after him. Soon he complained and
asked the boulder to slow down. Suddenly, Wolverine fell down, and the boul
der rolled right on top of him. Wolverine yelled and screamed in panic, but the
boulder just sat there, crushing his body. Wolverine called on his brothers Wolf
and Fox to help him. They refused, however, and reminded Wolverine he had
insulted the boulder, so it was only fair that it now lay on top of him. Frog tried
to move it, but his hands were too slippery. Mouse declared that he was too
small. Finally, Wolverine called on his brother Thunderstorm, who laughed
when he saw him lying under the boulder. Wolverine admitted he was being
silly again, and repeated his cry for help. Thunderstorm called on Lightning,
who zigzagged down from the sky above and struck the boulder into many little
pieces. That was how rocks were born. From then on, Wolverine spoke only
kind words to those rocks.
Culture heroes can be credited with virtually every aspect of a culture, in
cluding how to fish or dig wells for water, the existence of light, games, and
weaving, the origin of rituals and ceremonies, the location of genitalia, and the
origin of marriage and funerary practices.
In a Shasta tale, the people are brought arrowheads:
A very long time ago, in the days of the first people, hunters used arrows
that had pine-bark points. Ideally, they would have used obsidian, as obsidian
made a sharp, strong, deadly point that always killed animals that were shot.
But they did not know where to find it.
The only one who knew where Obsidian Old Man lived on Medicine Lake
was Ground Squirrel. One day, he set out to steal some of his obsidian, so he
took a basket filled with roots to Obsidian Old Man’s house and offered him
some. Obsidian Old Man ate the roots and enjoyed them so much, he sent
Ground Squirrel to find more. As Ground Squirrel was digging for them, Grizzly
Bear came along. Grizzly Bear sat in his lap and ordered Ground Squirrel to feed
him the roots. As Ground Squirrel was very much afraid of Grizzly Bear, he
obeyed. Grizzly Bear quickly gobbled up the roots and prepared to leave. He told
Ground Squirrel, “Obsidian Old Man’s mother cleaned roots for someone,” and
he walked away.
Ground Squirrel returned to Obsidian Old Man with only a few roots left to
give him. Ground Squirrel told Obsidian Old Man that Grizzly Bear had eaten
most of the roots he had gathered and what he had said. Obsidian Old Man was
Handbook of Native American Mythology
84



very angry at the insult to his dead mother and promised Ground Squirrel they
would both go to find more roots the next day.
So, Ground Squirrel and Obsidian Old man went off together early the next
morning. Ground Squirrel started digging, and Obsidian Old Man hid nearby.
Ground Squirrel’s basket was soon filled, and along came Grizzly Bear, who
again ordered him to sit down and feed him the roots.
Ground Squirrel did as he was told, like before, and fed Grizzly Bear the
roots by the handful as he sat in Ground Squirrel’s lap. But then he saw
Obsidian Old Man approach, and the bear rose to fight. The sharp obsidian cut
into Grizzly Bear’s flesh at each blow, but he kept fighting until he was cut to
pieces, and fell dead. Ground Squirrel and Obsidian Old Man went home and
ate the roots and were pleased. But Ground Squirrel awakened Obsidian Old
Man early the next morning with his loud groans and complained that he was
very sick and bruised because Grizzly Bear had sat on him. Obsidian Old Man
felt sorry for Ground Squirrel, so he left to get wood, suspicious that Ground
Squirrel might be trying to fool him. He crept back to peek at Ground Squirrel,
but he was still lying down and groaning, so Obsidian Old Man decided he
really was sick and went off in earnest. Clever Ground Squirrel, however, had
been pretending the whole time. As soon as Obsidian Old Man was far away, he
rose up, bundled up all the obsidian points, and ran off.
Upon his return, Obsidian Old Man noticed immediately that Ground
Squirrel was missing. He dropped the wood he had gathered and took off in pur
suit, almost catching Ground Squirrel before he ducked into a hole in the
ground. He kicked dirt into the old man’s eyes as he dug fast and tried to grab
Ground Squirrel. Obsidian Old Man finally gave up and left, and Ground Squirrel
ran out of the other end of the hole, crossed the lake, and returned home.
Ground Squirrel emptied his bundle of obsidian points on the ground and
gave them to everyone. The people discarded the old bark points and tied the
obsidian points onto their arrows. The new arrow points were used to hunt and
kill a great many deer.
A story of the Lillooet tells of how the culture hero/trickster transforms him
self into a dish in order to obtain some of the salmon it holds. He later assumes
his true form and releases the salmon that have been withheld from mankind:
At the very head waters of the Upper Lillooet River lived two brothers who
wished to become very great, so they spent most of their time training them
selves in the mountains nearby. Suddenly, one became very ill and had to re
main at home. After four years of this illness, he became very weak and thin.
His brother grew anxious and ceased his training. He hunted regularly and
brought his sick brother all kinds of meat. He also threw sticks into the water,
where they turned to fish. He then caught them and also gave them to his
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 85



brother to eat. But no food seemed to agree with him, and he continued to grow
more and more weak and thin.
At that time, the invalid’s brother decided to take him away to be cured.
They embarked down the river in a canoe, naming all the places as they passed
by. They arrived at a place they chose to call Ilamux, where a rock dammed the
river. They made a hole in this rock so they could go on. Then they found them
selves at a place they called Komelux, where two rushing creeks came together
with very great force. The brothers made the water smooth enough for them to
safely pass. They came to another place they called Kulexwin. Here, a steep,
rocky mountain stood close to the river. The brothers threw their medicine mat
at it, and the mountain became flat.
They continued to proceed down to Big and Little Lillooet Lakes and the
Lower Lillooet River until they reached Harrison Lake. All along the way, they
continued to name places, make the waters navigable, and change the features of
the land. Finally, they reached Fraser River, traveled to its mouth, and went out
to sea to the land of the salmon. When they arrived there, the well brother hid
himself, and the sick brother transformed himself into a beautifully carved and
painted wooden dish. In this form, he floated against the dam where the people
kept salmon. A man found the dish and brought it to his admiring daughter, who
used it to eat her meals. Whatever salmon she did not eat always disappeared
overnight, but since salmon were very plentiful, she did not mind at all.
The sick brother in dish form was eating the salmon, and soon he became
well again. His brother left his hiding place each night to visit his brother and
eat salmon out of the basket into which were thrown the remnants. When his
invalid brother had grown fat again, they departed one night and broke the dam
that held the salmon. They set out in their canoe and led the salmon toward the
mouth of the Fraser.
Because the salmon traveled very quickly, they reached the river by the
next morning. As they proceeded, the brothers threw pieces of salmon into the
various creeks and rivers, thus introducing salmon to the streams of the inte
rior. They declared that the salmon would run every year at that time, and the
people would discover and eat them. The two brothers returned to their home
at the head of the Upper Lillooet, and made near their house the hot springs
known as Tcîq, which they used to cook their food.

DEER HUNTER AND WHITE CORN MAIDEN
Tewa, Southwest
Because their lives are so intertwined with nature, Native Americans are keen
observers of the sky, stars, and planets, which figure prominently in their
mythology. This story explains the origin of two stars.
Long ago, in an ancient village of the San Juan people, lived a special and
most attractive young couple. The man was aptly named Deer Hunter because,
even as a young boy, he was the only one who always returned home from the
hunt with game. The girl was called White Corn Maiden, and she created the
finest pottery and most beautifully embroidered clothing of any woman. Deer
Hunter and White Corn Maiden thoroughly enjoyed each other’s company and
regularly sought each other out.
In time the couple married, as their parents and the other villagers ex
pected. What they did not expect, however, was that the pair would spend so
much time with each other. Both slighted their religious obligations. White
Corn Maiden neglected her pottery making and embroidery, and Deer Hunter
ceased hunting at a time his contribution was necessary to help spare many of
the villagers from hunger. The people worried that the gods might become an
gry with the couple for not upholding tribal traditions and bring disaster upon
them all. At their parents’ request, the tribal elders called a council. But the
pleas of the council to change their behavior merely drove Deer Hunter and
White Corn Maiden even closer together.
Suddenly, following a very brief illness, White Corn Maiden died. Deer
Hunter was consumed by grief. Refusing to eat or speak, he maintained a vigil
by his wife’s lifeless body until her burial the next day.
For four days, Deer Hunter wandered the village and its outer boundary,
hoping to encounter his wife during the short period when her soul was ex
pected to drift about the village in the form of a human shape, voice, wind, or
dream. Meandering into the fields, Deer Hunter suddenly spotted a small fire at
sundown on the fourth day after White Corn Maiden’s death. At the same time,
their relatives were gathering to perform a ceremony that would release her
soul into the spirit world forever.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 87



Deer Hunter approached the fire and encountered his wife, still beautiful
and preparing herself for her last journey. Unable to accept his wife’s death, he
wept at her feet and begged her to return to the village before the releasing rite
concluded. But White Corn Maiden implored her husband to let her go. Her re
turn to the world of the living would anger the spirits, she warned, and soon she
would lose her beauty.
Deer Hunter dismissed her pleas. Hearing him pledge his undying love and
assurance they would always be together, White Corn Maiden eventually re
lented. The couple returned to the village to the horrifying stares of their rela
tives, who were just about to finalize the releasing ceremony. Both they and the
village elders begged Deer Hunter to let her go, but he ignored their entreaties.
White Corn Maiden started to change profoundly following the couple’s re
turn to their home. She started to emit an unpleasant odor, her lovely face grew
ashen, and her skin began to dry out. Deer Hunter started to shun her, as White
Corn Maiden had predicted. Soon Deer Hunter could be sighted ducking among
the houses and running through the fields, with White Corn Maiden chasing
closely behind.
One morning a tall, imposing figure, sent from the spirit world, appeared in
the small dance court in the village center. He commanded Deer Hunter and
White Corn Maiden to come forward and appear before him. They meekly lis
tened as he chastised them for their selfishness and violations of their tribal tra
ditions. He commanded that they would be together for eternity in the sky, a vi
sual reminder to their people how important it was to live and survive
according to their traditions. Then he shot Deer Hunter into the sky on a huge
arrow, placing him low in the west. White Corn Maiden followed on a second
arrow, and was set right behind her husband, destined to chase him across the
heavens forever.

DOG HUSBAND
Inuit, Arctic

American Arctic. In some areas it is part of the Sedna tradition, with the mar

riage to the dog occurring prior to the marriage to the bird. The tale explains the
origin of the Indians and Whites.
There was a girl who refused to marry all suitors. None were good enough
for her. Finally her father was so angry he said, “You should have a dog for a
husband.” Later that night, a dog in the form of a man came in and slept with
the girl. When the girl became pregnant, her father rowed her out to a nearby is
land, but the dog swam after them and lived with the girl on the island. She
gave birth to a litter of pups and human children.
Her dog husband would swim back to shore to get bags of meat that had
been set out for them. One day, however, the girl’s father placed stones in the
bags and covered them with meat to conceal the stones. When the dog husband
tried to swim back to the island he sank and drowned. Then the father began
taking meat to the island for the girl and her children. But she was still angry at
him for making her marry the dog in the first place. So she told her dog children
to attack the old man the next time he came to the island. Her father was able
to escape back to his village but was afraid to return to the island.
Soon the girl and her children were hungry and had no one to bring them
any meat. So she cut off the soles of her boots and made boats out of them. She
set the dog children in one boat and sent them off across the sea, telling them
that they would be skillful with weapons. White men are descended from these
dog children.
The girl then set her human children in the other boat and sent them
across the water and ordered them to go inland. These became the ancestors of
Indians who lived to the south of the Inuit. Then the girl returned home and
lived with her parents again.

EARTH DIVER
Crow, Plains; Seneca, Northeast Woodlands
Earth Diver myths relate the formation of the earth from a small bit of mud
brought from the bottom of an ancient sea. Rooth compared nearly 300 creation
myths from across North America and reported that versions of the Earth Diver
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 89



myth were found in most all areas except portions of the southwest and Alaska.
Rooth also described the elements of Earth Diver tales: first there is only water;
some creature must retrieve mud or sand from deep below the surface of the
water; the diver is away a long time; the mud or sand is used by a god (or ani
mal) to form the earth; the earth must be stretched out or spread out; it in
creases in size over time and as humans or animals explore its circumference.
Leach retold a set of Crow tales collected by Robert H. Lowie.
Long ago Old Man and four ducks were the only creatures alive. There was
only water at that time. Old Man was going along and saw the ducks. He asked
them, “Is there any earth down there?” The ducks assured him that there was.
Old Man spoke to a mallard, “Go down there and bring back some earth so we
can make a world.” The mallard dove down below the water and was gone a
long time. When he finally returned, he did not have any earth in his beak. A
second duck attempted to bring back a bit of earth and then a third duck did the
same, but neither of them had any luck. Finally the helldiver (an aquatic bird)
asked to be sent down. He, too, was gone under the water a long time, and Old
Man and the other ducks were beginning to think he would not return. But
when he did return, he brought back a little mud on the ends of his toes.
Old Man took the mud and began working it in his hands. He started
spreading it out from the east to the west. He told the ducks that he would
make streams and ponds for them to live in. Old Man also made mountains and
hills and all sorts of trees and plants. Then he said he would make other crea
tures. But before he got started, a howling coyote came running from the west.
Old Man declared that the coyote would be powerful because he had created
himself. The Old Man then created the buffalo and all of the other animals.
Finally Old Man made people and proceeded to teach them about making fire
and arrows and how to set up their tepees.
In a Seneca tale, the earth had not yet been created when Iagen’tci began
her fall from the heavens to the water below. Ducks were swimming on the sur
face and saw the young girl falling toward them. A council was quickly con
vened, and they decided on a course of action. Some of the ducks flew up to
meet her, and with their wings outstretched, caught her and gently lowered her
to the surface. Then the ducks took turns diving to the bottom of the water to
bring back mud. This mud, when piled on the turtle’s back, would form land
where the woman could live. The ducks, however, died before returning to the
surface. Several other animals were also unsuccessful. Finally Muskrat was able
to retrieve a small amount of mud from the bottom. When he smeared the mud
on turtle’s back, it immediately grew, and the earth was formed.
As indicated by Fenton, a Wyandot (Huron) version of Woman Who Fell
from the Sky was recorded by Sagard in 1623 and again by Jesuits ten years
Handbook of Native American Mythology
90



later. A very similar tale was told to Hewitt only a little over a hundred years
ago by Iroquois informants. Fenton emphasizes the long oral tradition of this
myth, which most likely is much older than we can guess.

EARTH MOTHER
Okanagon, Plateau
This tale of the earth’s origins apparently has been influenced by Christian mis
sionaries or by European contact.
Old One, the Creator, made the earth out of a woman. He rolled and
stretched the earth and she became like a large ball. Old One shaped the ani
mals from bits of mud from Earth Mother’s skin. He made each kind of animal
to have its own strengths and weaknesses. Some of the bits of mud he made
into humans. These happened to be the most helpless creatures of all. Men
were selfish and stirred up trouble. Then Old One sent his son Jesus to fix
things. He told the people how to live right, but they didn’t listen. Instead they
killed him, so he went back to live in the sky.
Therefore Old One sent Coyote to set the world right. He taught humans
how to hunt and fish, how to build shelters, and how to make clothes to wear.
He taught them to talk and gave them names. He even put salmon in the rivers
and showed the people the best way to catch them with spears and nets.
Coyote chased away the Ice People and killed them with heat. Only one re
mained—just to torment men for a time each year. Coyote did a lot of good
things, but sometimes he did foolish things. One day he heard water making
noise. He told it to stop, but it kept on dripping. So he became angry and kicked
at the spot the water was dripping from. To his surprise, the drops turned into a
gushing stream that swept him away and nearly killed him. Coyote’s mistake
became the mighty Columbia River.
Eventually, Old One returned to see what Coyote had done. He was pleased
with Coyote’s work and told him that it was time for him to rest. So Coyote
left. Old One told the people that he, too, would be leaving, but he would send
messengers to them at times. The people were to listen to them. He also told
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 91



the people that when Earth Mother was very old, he would return again with
the spirits of the dead and everyone would live together. The Okanagon say that
the earth is very old now, so Old One will come back soon. References and further reading:

EMERGENCE
Southwest
Well-known and respected, the emergence creation stories explain the existence
of various populations in the current world and often account for their diversity
in culture and language. Especially prevalent among Native Americans of the
Southwest, emergence stories are by no means exclusive to this region.
However, the ties to complex ritual and ceremony among the people of the
Southwest, such as the initiation of boys and curing ceremonies, is what makes
their emergence stories distinct from those of other cultures.
Typically, the emergence describes how humans, plants, and animals were
conceived and gradually matured in one or more underworlds. The underworld
is sometimes populated by people, and sometimes by animals. They are usually
taught by a representative of a supreme being, and the existence of their food,
work, and customs is explained. They come forth from the underworld(s) and
migrate to their present location.
A Hopi story explains the emergence as initiated by two goddesses.
Long ago, the earth contained only water. In the east, a goddess of rock,
minerals, and other hard substances lived in the ocean. She was Huruing Wuhti.
A ladder led into her house, or kiva, to which two fox skins, one yellow, one
gray, were usually tied. Another Huruing Wuhti lived in the west, in a similar
kiva. A turtle-shell rattle was attached to her ladder.
The sun rose and set on this watery world. It would leave the Huruting
Wuhti’s kiva in the east and don the skins of the foxes as it moved across the
sky—first the gray skin, creating the white dawn of the Hopi, then the yellow
skin to create the bright yellow dawn. When it arrived at the Huruting Wuhti’s
kiva in the west, the sun announced its arrival by fastening the rattle to the top
of the ladder. It would then continue under the water, back to the east.
One day, the two goddesses caused the waters to part and recede, causing
some dry land to appear. The one from the east traveled to see the one in the
Handbook of Native American Mythology
92



west, over a rainbow, to discuss putting living creatures on the earth. They
decided to create a little bird, so the Huruting Wuhti of the east fashioned a
wren of clay and covered it with a cloth. Both goddesses sang a little song, and
a live bird came forth. It was sent to fly over the earth. When it returned, it
reported that it saw no living being anywhere. This was actually not true, as
the bird failed to notice Kohkang Wuhti, or Spider Woman, who lived in her
kiva in the southwest. The Huruting Wuhti of the west created more birds of
many different kinds, and together the two goddesses made them real in the
same manner as before. They taught the birds to sing and allowed them to
scatter in all directions.
Next, the Huruting Wuhti of the west made various animals and taught
them to make certain sounds before sending them into the world. The god
desses decided to make humans after that. So, the Huruting Wuhti from the
east made a white man and woman from clay and brought them to life. The
goddesses taught them their language, and then they selected a place to live.
Spider Woman heard about what the others were doing, and she, too, cre
ated a man and woman of clay. However, she taught them Spanish and made
two burros for them, and they decided to live near her.
She continued to create other people, giving a different language to each
pair. But she once forgot to make a woman for a particular man, and this ex
plains why some single men exist. She also forgot to create a man for a certain
woman, so she told the woman to go find one of the single men and see if he
would accept her. The two finally met, and decided to stay together. He built a
house for them, but it wasn’t long before they began to quarrel. The woman de
cided she wanted to live alone, since she knew how to cook, but the man sug
gested they remain a couple. After all, he knew how to gather wood and work
the fields. They made up, but it didn’t last. They soon quarreled and separated,
reunited, and separated again. Other couples learned to quarrel like them,
which is why husbands and wives have so many arguments. This was the type
of rough-mannered people the Spider Woman created.
The Huruting Wuhti of the west heard about the people the Spider Woman
was creating. She told the goddess from the east that she did not want to live
alone but around good people. So, she created more pairs, who ran into trouble
whenever they encountered the people Spider Woman had created.
Eventually, the goddess from the west told the people that she was going to
live in the middle of the ocean to the west. She instructed them to pray for her
if they wanted anything. Her people were sorry to see her go. The Huruting
Wuhti from the east did the same thing. Whenever the Hopi want something,
they deposit their prayer offerings in their village, thinking of the two goddesses
who still remember them.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 93



Another emergence story, from the Northern California coast, tells of the
earth’s formation by a dragon and a god. Like so many stories from this area, it
was recorded as a fragment because of the negative impact of early contact with
Europeans.
Before the present world was formed, there existed another with a sky of
old sandstone rock. Two gods, Thunder and Nagaicho, noticed that the sky was
being shaken by thunder. They decided to fix the rock by stretching it above
and far to the east.
They walked onto the sky to do so, and under each of its four corners, they
set a great rock to hold it up. Then they added various things to make the world
pleasant and attractive to people. Flowers were put in the south, and clouds in
the east. To form these clouds a fire was built, and a large hole opened in the
sky so that they could float through. In the west, another opening was made so
the fog could drift in from the ocean.
Next, the gods created people. They formed a man from earth and made a
stomach for him of grass. They used grass for his heart, too, round bits of clay
for the liver and kidneys, and a reed for a windpipe. To create his blood, they
mixed pulverized red stone with water. The gods put the man’s parts together
and then took one of his legs, split it, and turned it into a woman. They also
fashioned a sun to travel during the day, and a moon at night.
It rained every night and day, however, and so the gods’ creations did not
last. Land and animals disappeared because of the water, and all the people
slept. The oceans flowed together and joined, and there were no more moun
tains, fields, or rocks. All living things washed away, and there was no wind,
snow, frost, rain, or sun. It was just very dark.
The earth dragon then walked down from the north, traveling underground
with the god Nagaicho riding on its head. As the dragon walked along beneath the
ocean, its glances and movements caused a coastal ridge, an island, and a great
mountain range to form in various places. When it reached the south the dragon
lay down. Nagaicho spread gray clay between its eyes and on each horn. He cov
ered the clay with reeds, and then applied another layer of clay. On this clay he put
some small stones and then set blue grass, brush, and trees in it. He declared there
should be mountain peaks on the earth’s head, against which the waves of the sea
would break. So the mountains appeared, and brush sprang up on them. The
stones he had placed on the head became large, and it could no longer be seen.
Next, people appeared, people with animal names such as Seal, Sea Lion,
Whale, and Grizzly Bear. When Indians came to live on earth later, these “first
people” were changed into their animal namesakes.
Nagaicho created various kinds of sea foods that grew in the water for the
people to eat, such as seaweed, abalones, and mussels. He created salt from
Handbook of Native American Mythology
94



ocean foam, and arranged for the ocean to move in waves. Next, he traveled all
over the earth to make it a pleasant place to live. He made redwoods and other
trees grow on the dragon’s tail, which lay to the north. He created oak trees to
supply acorns to eat. He formed creeks with fresh water for drinking by drag
ging his foot around.
When Nagaicho had finished, he walked all around the new land with his
dog to see how everything looked. Being satisfied, and finding himself close to
his original home, he decided to stay in the north. References and further reading:

FIRST CREATOR AND LONE MAN
Mandan, Plains
Myths regarding First Creator and Lone Man tell of the creation of the earth, its
people, and its animals. The version retold here appears to have been influenced
by contact with early European missionaries.
Before there was an earth as we now know it, water covered everything.
First Creator and Lone Man were walking along on top of the water when they
saw something in the distance. They soon discovered that it was Duck. As they
watched her, she dove under the water and came back up with a bit of mud.
First Creator and Lone Man asked Duck to bring up some mud for them also.
They thought it would be a good substance from which to form the earth and
its creatures.
They decided to divide up the responsibilities. Lone Man went to the north
and First Creator went to the south. They left some water in between them and
this is now the Missouri River. First Creator made hills, mountain streams, val
leys, buffalo, elk, and antelope. While he was doing this, Lone Man created a
level country with lakes and small streams scattered across the region. He made
animals that lived in water part of the time, such as the beaver, otter, and
muskrat. He also created cattle and moose. After First Creator and Lone Man
had each completed their tasks, they inspected each other’s work. First Creator
thought his land and animals were superior. But, Lone Man replied that he cre
ated what he thought would be useful to mankind.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 95



After a while, First Creator and Lone Man went separate ways. Lone Man
walked among humans, but they didn’t see him. So he devised a way in which
to be born as a human and chose a young virgin to become his mother. He
changed himself into corn and was eaten by the girl. Later, she was found to be
with child even though she was still a virgin. Eventually the baby boy was born
and grew as any normal boy, although he hated evil and never married. He pro
moted peace and harmony and settled disputes with calming words. He caused
buffalo herds to come near the people so they had plenty to eat. He also directed
rain to fall on the corn fields when there was drought everywhere else.
Lone Man joined a group of twelve men who were setting out to sail to an
island where the inhabitants were known for their fabulous feasts. During the
journey, evil spirits rose up out of the water, but Lone Man rebuked them and
commanded them never to return. While they were still on the river, willows
along the banks turned into evil spirits and challenged Lone Man to fight. He
went on shore and killed all who attempted to wrestle with him. The remaining
evil spirits fled. Then Lone Man reprimanded the willows. He reminded them
that he was their creator and ordered them never to turn into evil spirits again.
Once on the sea, a whirlpool threatened to consume the boat. The other
men on the boat were terrified and thought that they would perish, but Lone
Man finally rebuked the waves and told them to “Be still!” From then on, their
journey was peaceful. When they arrived at the island, Lone Man discerned that
the chief of the island was plotting to kill him and his companions by making
them overeat at the feast. So Lone Man told the other men to only eat as much
as they felt comfortable eating. Lone Man, however, found a hollow bulrush and
inserted it into his mouth and down through his whole digestive system until it
penetrated far down into the earth. When the bowls of food were passed to him,
Lone Man appeared to eat vast quantities. But in reality the food passed through
the bulrush and down into the earth. The chief and his people were amazed that
the strangers did not die from overeating.
The chief attempted to kill them in several other ways, but Lone Man al
ways knew ahead of time what was planned. The chief became suspicious and
eventually said, “You must be Lone Man!” But Lone Man denied it. When they
all returned to their own homes, Lone Man taught them how to perform cere
monies in remembrance of him. As part of the preparation, the people were to
find a cedar tree and set the trunk in the middle of the village. They were to
paint it red and then burn incense and offer sacrifices nearby. Lone Man told the
people that he would be going away, but that he was leaving his body (the cedar)
behind.
The four day Mandan Okipa (O-kee-pa) Ceremony was conducted not only to
provide the necessities of daily life, but also to underline the bond between the
Handbook of Native American Mythology
96



people and the supernatural forces around them. The sacred cedar pole represent
ing Lone Man was a focal point for prayers and many of the ceremonial activities
of the Okipa. In the winter of 1832, Prince Maximilian recorded what elders of
the tribe described to him of the ceremony, and during the summer of that year,
the artist George Caitlin and fur trader James Kipp actually witnessed it. Several
titles listed below have summarized both Maximilian’s and Catlin’s reports.

FLOOD(S)
Mythological narratives regarding a great deluge abound worldwide. In North
America, flood stories are found not only where people lived near large bodies of
water, but also in the drier interior of the continent.
An Inuit version of the great flood states that one spring a tremendous storm
blew across the earth, destroying the homes of people living on the Arctic coast.
The people hurried to their skin boats and, as a safety measure, lashed them to
gether. The sea began to rise and soon covered everything as far as the eye could
see. Terrified, the people drifted in their boats, unable to save themselves. At
night many people died from the bitter cold, and their bodies fell into the sea.
But by morning the wind and sea had calmed and the sun beat down on the
people in the boats and the waters began to steam. The sun was so intense that
some people died. Finally a sorcerer struck the water with his bow and yelled,
“Enough! Enough! We’ve had enough!” Then the man tossed his earrings into
the sea and again cried out, “Enough!” Soon the water began receding and even
tually formed the rivers and streams. The sea retreated to the place it is today.
Teit described a Lillooet flood story.
A great rain fell on the area where the Lillooet once lived. It rained heavily
and continued raining until the lakes and rivers overflowed. The people were
afraid. A man named Ntci’nemkim put his family in a large canoe. The other
people began climbing up a large mountain. When they saw the family in the
canoe, they begged Ntci’nemkim to let their children in the canoe. However,
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 97



the man said the canoe was too small to hold all of the children. So he took one
child from each family—a boy from one family and a girl from the next. The
rain continued falling and soon all of the land, except for Split Mountain, was
covered with water. The people drifted in the canoe until the water receded.
When the land was finally dry, the man and his family built their home near
where the canoe came to rest. They made the other children marry each other
and sent the young couples off in different directions to make homes where the
game was abundant.
Another myth tale from the Pacific Northwest explains cause of the flood.
According to the Haida tale included in the Erdoes and Ortiz anthology,
American Indian Myths and Legends, there was a village near Frederick Island
with many people residing in it. A group of boys and girls were playing on the
beach. They noticed a strange looking woman wearing an unusual fur cape. A
curious little boy walked up to her to find out more about her and other chil
dren followed him. One boy pulled up the back of her garment and they were
surprised to see what looked like a plant that grows near the shore sticking out
of her back. The children all laughed and made fun of her. But the elders of the
village warned the children not to make fun of the woman.
The woman sat down at the water’s edge. Since it was low tide, the sea was
a long way from the village. However, as the tide began to rise, the woman got
up and moved a little closer to the village. Each time the water touched her
feet, she moved back towards the village. Finally she was sitting at the edge of
the village. The people were amazed and terrified. They didn’t have any canoes,
so they tied logs together to form rafts. Then they placed their children and bas
kets of food and water on the rafts. The woman continued to back up each time
the water touched her feet and she moved higher and higher up the mountain
side. Eventually the entire island was covered by the water and the people
floated around on the rafts. Finally they saw a few mountain peaks protruding
from the water. One of the rafts came to rest on one peak while the other rafts
landed on others, and this is how the people spread across the earth.
According to a tale from the Skidi Pawnee, the flood was caused by arro
gant people who offended the sun. The god Tirawa destroyed them and mon
sters in a great flood and then created new people for the earth.
Long ago, Tirawa had created everything, including men, animals, and mon
sters. The people were giants and could do marvelous things. They thought they
were as good as any of the gods in heaven. These giants became so proud they be
gan behaving disrespectfully to Sun. When it rose in the morning they would call
it rude names. They even went so far as to turn their backs and expel flatus at it.
This displeased Tirawa greatly and he asked the minor gods for their ad
vice, “What shall I do with them?” But they replied, “It is not up to us. You
Handbook of Native American Mythology
98



made them; they are yours.” So Tirawa decided to destroy them. He ordered
Paruxti to send a cloud from the west to pour heavy rain on these evil people.
But the people did not care. So Tirawa ordered a second cloud sent. This one
also poured heavy rain down on the evil giants. But they were not concerned. So
Tirawa ordered Paruxti to send a third cloud, and this time it was to rain until
everything on earth was drowned. When the cloud burst, the water that had
been in the ground also rose. The people realized that the situation was serious
and ran to higher ground. But the water continued to rise until it covered every
thing, even the highest hills. All the people were killed by the flood and so were
all of the monsters.
Tirawa then sent a little bird to see if the ground was dry. Then he sent an
other bird, a crow, and told him that he would find streams and people and ani
mals, but he was not supposed to touch them while he was down there. The
crow, however, when he saw the dead people, ate from them. Tirawa was dis
pleased by this and refused to let him back into the heavens. “You shall remain
on earth and live off of carcasses.”
The other bird that had been sent to earth was told by Tirawa that he
would become the chief of the birds because he had obeyed. Tirawa also said
that the new people who were to be created would honor this bird and include
him in sacred pipe bundles.
Then Tirawa, knowing that the streams and lakes had been restored, in
structed Lightning to collect the people in a sack and rid the land of their car
casses. When Lightning returned to Tirawa, the other gods were commanded to
create mankind. Paruxti, the Evening Star, created the first men, and then the
other gods followed, and this way the earth was replenished with humans.

FOX
The beautiful but clever and cunning Fox is another animal character commonly
found in Native American myths and stories. He is one of Coyote’s most com
mon companions, but Fox often proves to be a deceitful friend and steals
Coyote’s food. In an Achomawi story, the two are co-creators who disappear
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 99



from the world just before humans arrive. The Yurok tell the story of how the
Foxes, angry with the Sun, caught him and tied him to a hill, causing him to
burn a great hole in the ground. An Inuit tale features Fox as a beautiful woman
who marries a hunter, but resumes her skin and leaves him when he offends her.
Fox proves to be an untrustworthy friend to Wolf in a story of the
Menominee.
Fox and Wolf were living together and making maple sugar. They made one
mokok (“bark box”), of sugar, and then they buried it. They agreed to let their
cache remain hidden until they were very hungry.
Fox was a good hunter. He never failed to return home with chickens or
small game every time he went out. But the greedy Wolf never killed anything
or brought anything home, so Fox decided to play a trick on his chum for being
so lazy. Fox suggested that Wolf visit a nearby house and see if the people living
there would give him something to eat. He told Wolf that he had been given a
chicken when he went there.
Wolf did as he was told. But when he arrived at the house, Wolf did not
hide himself. The owner of the house saw the Wolf approach, so he set his dogs
on him to drive him away. The man decided it was Wolf who had been stealing
their chickens. Wolf escaped only by running into the river. When Wolf arrived
at his home, he told Fox of his narrow escape. Fox explained that the man did
not recognize him, but Wolf did not reply. One day Fox lied to Wolf and told
him he had to leave the house, as he wanted to give a name to a child. But Fox
went instead to their cache of maple-sugar and ate some of it. When he re
turned, he told Wolf in response to his question that he named the baby
Mokimon. This word means to “reveal” or “dig out” something one has hidden.
Another time, while he and Wolf were sitting together, Fox pulled the same
trick. This time, Fox told Wolf he had named the baby Wapiton, which means
“to commence to eat.” The next time, he told Wolf he had given the baby the
name Hapata kiton, or, “half eaten.” Finally, Fox claimed he had named a baby
Noskwaton, which means “all licked up.”
At that point, Wolf finally caught on and angrily guessed that Fox had been
eating their stored maple sugar. But Fox just laughed at him. Then Wolf went to
look at their cache. Sure enough, all he found was the empty box, with its for
mer contents missing.
In the meantime, Fox went and hid in the branches of a large tree by a
stream. Wolf returned home to find Fox gone and tracked him to the tree. He
climbed part way, but fell into the water in surprise and fury when Fox startled
him. He tried four times to jump out of the water to catch the laughing Fox but
soon grew tired and gave up. Wolf finally suggested they make up and go home,
knowing that Fox was feeding him regularly anyway.
Handbook of Native American Mythology

Winter returned, and Fox frequently left their home to catch many fish.
Wolf asked him how he caught so many, and Fox explained to him how he used
his tail for a line. He suggested Wolf try this technique himself.
Fox was hoping he could get Wolf to freeze to death in the ice, so he would
no longer have to feed him. So, he took him out and cut five holes in the ice
one for each paw, and one for Wolf’s tail—explaining that he could catch more
fish that way. Wolf remained there to fish all night. As his limbs and tail be
came heavy, he thought he was catching a tremendous load of fish, so he re
mained on the ice longer, unknowingly freezing fast. When he finally realized
what was happening, he struggled to free himself, wearing out his tail and
pulling the claws and bottoms of his feet off. He believed Fox’s story that this
was caused by all the fish he had caught.
Since this trick proved unsuccessful in killing Wolf, Fox persuaded him to
climb a tree and take honey from a wasp’s nest. Wolf was nearly stung to death.
Fox ran away, over a wagon road to conceal his tracks, where he met a man
hauling a load of bread. Fox lay down on the side of the road and pretended he
was dead. The man stopped and put him in his wagon behind his load. Fox
came to and, as they rode along, threw a loaf of bread to the ground every so of
ten. Finally, he jumped off the wagon and took the loaves he had stolen to a se
cret place, where he built a shelter in which to live.
Wolf eventually stumbled along, half-starved and injured from his experi
ence with the fishing and the wasp’s nest. Fox fed him upon his arrival and sug
gested he steal some bread the same way he did.
The next morning, Wolf watched the same road, and the man approached
with his load of bread. Wolf played dead on the ground, but the man was deter
mined to not be fooled again after losing some of his bread to what he had
thought was a dead fox the previous day. He stopped his team and knocked Wolf
over the head with a big stick and killed him. Ever since then, Fox has eaten
alone.

GAMBLERS AND GAMBLING
Contrary to what many assume, the gambling that has arisen on Indian land
across the United States during the past decade is not a ruinous element of
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 101



capitalism newly adopted by Native Americans. Gambling was actually deeply
rooted in the culture, myth, and religion of nearly all of the indigenous peoples
of North America long before contact with Europeans. Historically, gambling
was part of sacred tribal rituals, ceremonies, and celebrations, and was an infor
mal mechanism for redistributing wealth within a given community. Today,
many Indians view gaming as a viable source of employment and revenues, an
integral part of tribal economies, and a previously unparalleled opportunity to
gain self-sufficiency.
Native Americans were enthusiastic recreational gamblers and participants
in a variety of games that stressed chance, skill, strength, and endurance. A fa
vorite among Dakota (Sioux) women was played with dice made from beaver’s
teeth, bones, or other materials. Turtles, spiders, or lizards were painted and
carved on the dice, which were kept in a round basket. A woman tossed the
dice into the air and caught them in the basket. Designs were assigned different
values, so points were scored depending on which designs faced upwards. Hair
strings and beaded chokers were wagered on the luck of the throw. Especially
popular among the Mohave was a hoop-and-pole game during which the partici
pants themselves wagered heavily on the outcome. To play, a hoop was rolled
and a player slid a pole along the ground, hoping that the hoop would fall on top
of it when it stopped rolling. A favorite for betting among men of other
California tribes was a guessing game that used objects hidden in the hands, a
contest of wits that could go on for days while fortunes in shells, bows, skins,
and baskets were wagered. One player held a marked and an unmarked bone
and rapidly switched them from fist to fist. He then challenged his opponents to
guess which hand held the marked bone.
Gamblers and games of chance appear frequently in Native American sto
ries. In a Yana myth, Gopher tells Rabbit they will always gamble when they
meet. A series of games results in Gopher losing everything, even his body, to
Rabbit. A Kawaiisu story features Inipi, a spirit of the dead and keeper of doves
who gambles with Coyote. Coyote wins the doves, and they are released for the
Kawaiisu people. During seasons when no doves are seen, Coyote is believed to
be losing the gambling match. In a story of the Alabama, about a moccasin game
called thlakalunka, a man of considerable means wagers first his family fortune,
then his clothes, then all of the world’s water, and loses. People begin to die of
thirst because the rivers, streams, and ponds have all dried up. Woodpecker dis
covers a canoe as large as a tree and pecks a hole in it, causing all the water to
gush back into place. The story of the divine gambler Noqoìlpi tells of how a
great pueblo, Kintyèli, frequently found in Navajo legends, came to be built.
In a Chilcotin story, two men played the game lehal, and one lost every
thing he owned. He finally bet his wife, lost her too, and was very unhappy. He

went away and lay down beneath an overhanging rock. As he lay there thinking
about ways he might recover his wife and property, he heard some ducks flying
over. Looking up, he was surprised to find that he was able to see the ducks
right through the rock. He then laid his lehal bones on top of the rock and
found that they, too, were visible through it, and he could see which one was
black and which one was white. Joyful at his discovery, he returned home. He
spent that summer alone in the mountains, hunting groundhogs, the skins of
which he made into many blankets.
When the salmon were running, he went to fish, and encountered the man
who had won his wife. Since he had blankets to wager, he suggested they play
lehal again. The game began, and the man found that this time he could see
the lehal bones right through the other’s hands. He allowed the other man to
win a few times to make him overconfident and careless. Soon, he started to
win and gradually won back all his possessions, until his rival had nothing left.
He then suggested they play for his wife again. But the other man said he pre
ferred to keep his wife, and was willing to bet his own wife instead, as he
didn’t care for her. So, they played on, and he soon won the man’s wife. Then
they played for his own wife, and when he had won back half of her, the other
man suggested they stop the game so he could stay with her for one more

ment when they had played previously. The man finally won both women, and
his revenge was complete.

GHOSTS
Most Native North Americans viewed death not as the end of life, but as the
beginning of the next life. Although traditions and beliefs surrounding death
varied across the continent, there appears to have been general agreement that
the spirit of the deceased often remained nearby for a time. Ceremonial mourn
ing periods also varied and may have coincided with the length of time a spirit
was considered to be present. Numerous mythological stories include or focus
on ghosts. In some stories ghosts have dangerous power and elicit fear, while in
others they come as messengers to warn the living of peril.
Some myths tell of mourning spouses who went to the land of the dead to
bring their loved ones back. Often in these myths the deceased spouse was able
to come back (or be brought back) home and the living spouse was admonished
to follow certain directives. Failure to do so would result in the loved one be
coming a ghost again and returning to the land of the dead. Several of these
myths have been included here in the entry entitled Afterlife.
J. Owen Dorsey and George Bushotter recorded several ghost myths from
the Teton Dakota. In one of these a young man wished to marry a certain girl.
One day when he returned from gathering wild horses to give to her father, he
found the village deserted except for one lodge. In it he found a burial scaffold,
and looking down from it was the girl. He stayed there with her until one day
Handbook of Native American Mythology
104



he was very hungry and thought to himself that he must leave the lodge to hunt
for food. The ghost said to him, “You said you were hungry. Go ride to the
bluffs and there you will find a herd of buffalo. Shoot the fattest one and then
bring me some of the roasted meat before you eat your meal.” When the young
man brought the food into the lodge, the girl climbed down from the scaffold
ing. This startled him, but she knew what he was thinking and reassured him
saying, “Don’t be afraid.”
Eventually, the couple decided to leave that place, traveling by night and
resting by day. As they went along the young woman kept her head covered and
walked silently through the grass. Whenever her husband was thinking about
something, the young wife knew exactly what it was, even if he did not speak a
word. That is because a ghost knows everything, even when the wind will blow
or the rains will fall from the clouds. The young man and his wife continued to
travel around, but they were never seen by people. Eventually the man became
a ghost, too.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 105

(North Wind Picture Archives)



According to Dorsey’s translations of over 200 myths and other texts
recorded by Bushotter in his native language, ghosts were not always visible to
the living, but sometimes they could be heard. Occasionally, ghosts would be
come visible and live as humans, eating, drinking, and marrying. When some
one was sick, the ghost of dead relatives would come to coax the person away.
To keep the ghosts away, cedar logs were laid around the home to protect it. At
other times cedar wood was burned to make smoke.
In order to make travel to the ghost world easier, Dorsey and Bushotter re
ported that Teton people received a tattoo on their foreheads or on their wrists.
An old woman sat along the road to the ghost world and examined each ghost
that tried to pass. If she did not find the appropriate tattoo, she pushed them
over a cliff and they fell back to earth. That is why some ghosts are forever wan
dering around here on earth.
An Ojibwa myth relates the story of a man and his wife who were longsuf
fering in their hospitality to two strangers.
The husband was out hunting, and as the time grew late, the wife worried
about him. When she heard footsteps outside, she thought it was her husband.
Instead there were two strange women. The wife invited them into her home.
The strangers sat in a far corner, kept their heads covered, and didn’t speak.
Much to the wife’s relief, her husband finally arrived home. He brought in with
him a carcass of a large, fat deer. The two strangers jumped up and tore off large
pieces of fat from the deer and ate eagerly. The man and his wife were very sur
prised by their behavior but didn’t say anything out of respect for the strangers.
The two women continued to stay with the man and his wife throughout
the remainder of the winter, and except for this one thing that they did each
time the man returned with meat, their behavior was above reproach. They
were quiet, kept to themselves, and were no trouble at all. Hunting had been
good since the women arrived, so the couple thought the two women had
brought good luck. One day, however, when the man returned very late, the
two strangers immediately tore into the carcass he brought back. The wife be
came angry at their behavior, but didn’t say a word. Still, her husband knew
that she was upset by the incident. Later that night, there was weeping coming
from the corner where the strangers stayed. The man asked the two women
why they were crying and said, “Have we been inhospitable to you?”
The women replied that they had been treated with kindness. They told the
man that they had been sent on a mission from the land of the dead. The Master
of Life had heard the cries of people who lost loved ones and wished to have an
other chance to make them happy. The test he devised was to see if humans were
really sincere. The two women gave the couple advice and instructions about the
future, promised the hunter great success, and then they departed into the night.

THE GIRL WHO MARRIED A BEAR
Haida, Tlingit, Tsimshian, Northwest Coast
This story recounts how the people were taught to respect bears and to perform
the proper ceremonies to appease the spirits of the bears they had hunted and
killed.
The chief of a village had four sons who were excellent hunters and fisher
men. His daughter gathered berries with the other girls from the village. One
day, when the girl and her companions were some distance from the village,
her basket line broke and all of the berries tumbled out. The other girls told
her to just leave them on the ground and return to the village as it was getting
dark. However, the girl insisted on picking up all the scattered berries and
stayed behind.
Soon two young men came along and offered to help carry her basket. They
led her to a village that she had never seen before. She was ushered into the
house of the chief of that village. Mouse Woman came to her side and advised
what food to eat and what food to decline. Mouse Woman also explained that
she was now in the village of the Black Bears and that the people she saw were
not really people at all, but bears.
The girl married a son of the Black Bear chief and lived with them through
the summer. When the fall came, the bears prepared to go to their winter
homes. The Bear chief called everyone together and asked which dens they
wanted to live in. The other families chose their dens and then the chief asked
his son and daughter-in-law which one they wanted. The girl’s husband named
a nearby place, but she said, “No, it is near where my brothers and their dogs
hunt.” So the husband named other dens, but each time the girl refused to go
there. Finally the chief asked where she wanted to spend the winter and she
replied, “Somewhere far away that would be difficult for my brothers’ dogs to
find.” So the chief gave them a den on the far side of the mountain.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 107



That winter the girl’s brothers went hunting. The older ones were very suc
cessful and brought home many bear hides and much meat. But, the youngest
one did not have any luck, so he kept searching farther into the mountains. One
day his dogs picked up the scent of bear and ran up a snowy mountainside. The
brother had a difficult time following but finally made it to the opening of a
den. When he peeked inside he saw his sister and her husband. His sister asked
him to wait while she gave birth. After a while, she gave him her two babies
and he tucked them inside his clothing. Then the girl asked her brother not to
kill her husband with a spear, but to build a fire at the mouth of the den. At
first the brother said that he would spare her husband, but the girl said, “No.
Kill him, or he will kill you.”
So her brother built a fire at the mouth of the bear’s den and after a while
they could no longer hear the bear’s moans and they knew he was dead. The
hunter pulled the bear outside and while he butchered it, the girl sang the
songs her Bear-husband had taught her. They prepared the bear’s head, heart,
tail, and hide as she had been instructed and she sang a song for each part of
the ceremony.
Then the girl, her children, and her brother returned to her father’s village.
All of the people were glad to see her again, and her father gave a feast for his
grandchildren. The children grew and played rough-and-tumble inside and out.
One day, as they were wrestling inside the house, they knocked their grand
mother over. The old woman complained angrily, and the children were so
ashamed that they asked to return to their father’s people. So their mother sent
them off with a sorrowful heart. She asked them to bring food at times and to
let their younger uncle have successful hunting trips. See also Bear; Culture Hero(es); Mouse Woman References and further reading:

GLOOSKAP
Northeast Woodlands
Across the northeastern region, variations in the spelling of this culture hero’s
name include Gluskap, Gluskabe, Glukoba, and Kuloskap. Although he was not
the creator, Glooskap worked to set the world right. He also instructed both
people and animals in the way they should live. In many areas of the Northeast,
Handbook of Native American Mythology
108



evidence of Glooskap’s handiwork can be found in the lakes, hills, and islands
he formed. Eventually his tasks were finished, and he left for the west.
Glooskap’s birth is reminiscent of the birth of the twins in the myth
“Woman Who Fell from the Sky.”
Glooskap and his twin brother Malsum (called “Wolf”) discussed how they
would be born. Glooskap wanted to be born the usual way, but his brother came
out through their mother’s armpit, causing her death. The boys raised them
selves and eventually grew to be very powerful. Glooskap then went around do
ing good, while Malsum was bent on making trouble for man and beast.
Malsum became envious of his brother, Glooskap, and one day asked him,
“How would a person be able to kill you?” Glooskap suspected trouble, so he
lied and said, “If someone would strike me on the head with a tail feather from
an owl, I’d never know what hit me.” Later, the brothers were on a hunting trip.
While Glooskap was sleeping, Malsum found an owl and plucked out one of its
tail feathers. He quietly crept up to Glooskap and struck him on the head with
the feather. Glooskap woke up and was so angry he killed his brother, but later
revived him in the form of a wolf (though some say he was turned into a moun
tain on the Gaspe Peninsula).
In a Passamaquoddy tale Glooskap (Kuloskap) defeated a family of cannibal
istic Ice-Giants. The family had been friends of Glooskap when he was young,
but later on he heard about their grisly ways. He decided to see for himself, and
if it was true, he would destroy them. So he disguised himself to look like one
of their kind and set off on his journey. When he arrived at the old man’s wig
wam, he went in and sat down. The old man’s sons looked in but could not tell
Glooskap and their father apart.
They devised a series of tests. First, the old man’s daughter brought in food
and placed it in front of Glooskap. However, before he could start eating, one of
her brothers picked up the platter and took it outside. Glooskap was hungry so
he merely willed the platter to return, and it did. Next they gave the old man a
whale’s jaw, but he could not bend it. Glooskap, however, snapped the huge
bone as if it were only a pipe stem. The old man’s sons marveled, but they
tested him again. This time they brought strong tobacco that only a great wiz
ard could smoke. But Glooskap burned the whole pipe full in just one puff.
Then the Ice-Giants said, “Let’s have a game.” They all went outdoors and
started kicking a ball around. It wasn’t just any ball, but a live human head that
tried to bite off their feet when they kicked it. Glooskap took a branch from a
tree and turned it into an even more gruesome ball. The others all ran away in
terror. Then Glooskap caused a great flood of water to rush down the mountain,
and he turned the Ice-Giants into fish. The fish were swept out to sea with the
rushing water.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 109



One myth retells the events from the time when Glooskap saved a village
from a water monster.
The only source of water for a certain village had dried up. A man went to
find out why. He walked to the source of the spring and learned that a huge
monster had dammed up the water. The man pleaded with the monster to re
lease the water for the thirsty people down stream. But, the monster just threat
ened to kill him. The man ran back to his village to report that the situation
was hopeless. Glooskap, however, knew of their problem and decided to inter
vene. As he prepared for battle, Glooskap formed a flint knife from a nearby
mountain. Then he went to the place where the water monster lived. When
Glooskap demanded the release of the water, the monster just laughed and said
that he would swallow Glooskap. The earth shook with Glooskap’s rage. He
made himself taller than the tree tops, and the monster was not able to swallow
him. Glooskap pulled out his flint knife and split the monster’s belly open.
Suddenly, the water gushed out and ran down the hill and toward the sea.
Eventually, Glooskap had defeated all of the monsters. The land had been
transformed to its present shape, and all living creatures had been instructed in
how to live in peace and harmony. But the people were a rebellious lot and
Glooskap became weary of living among them. So he made a great feast for
them and then said his goodbyes and left for the west. It is said that the horned
owls and the loons call out for him to return even today.

GREAT BEAR CONSTELLATION
Northeast Woodlands, Plateau, Subarctic
The constellation Ursa Major is commonly called the Big Dipper in modern
North America; to the ancients around the world, it was known as the Bear.
In the mythology of the Carrier Indians, a young man was away on a hunt
ing expedition. He woke up and looked up at the Great Bear to check the time.
Then he went back to sleep. Some time later, he looked at the Great Bear again,
but it had hardly moved. The young man was angry at the Great Bear, since he
Handbook of Native American Mythology
110



was anxious for morning to come. So he yelled up at the stars, complaining that
the Great Bear must be lame.
In the morning, the hunter’s dog caught the scent of a bear near the camp
and set off after it. The young man ran after them but had a difficult time keep
ing up. Finally, in the evening, the dog stopped, and instead of a bear an old man
was sitting on a log. The old man asked the hunter if he’d been running all day.
“Yes,” he replied, “that’s why I’m so exhausted.” At that the old man reminded
the youth what he’d said the night before. “In the sky I travel a great distance,
but it appears that I travel slowly. Today I walked slowly, but you couldn’t
catch up to me.” Then the young man was embarrassed at his harsh words, and
the Great Bear returned to the sky.
The Skitswish (Coeur d’Alene) have several myths about the stars. One re
lates the story of three brothers who had a grizzly bear brother-in-law. Two of
the brothers did not like the bear and plotted to kill it. The younger brother
tried to warn his brother-in-law, but his brothers had followed him. As the
young man called out to the bear, the other two shot and killed it. They were all
suddenly transformed into the four main stars of the Great Bear Constellation.
Among the Algonquian-speaking people of the Northeastern Woodlands,
there were a number of myth stories similar to the following from the Fox
(Meskwaki) people.
Early one winter morning, three hunters set out along with their dog. They
followed the river into the woods. After a while they found a trail that led to a
bear’s den. The oldest hunter crawled into the cave and poked the bear with his
bow. The startled bear ran out of the den and the hunters and their dog gave
chase.
At first the bear headed toward the frigid north. The youngest hunter ran
quickly to turn him away from there. Then the bear ran to the east where the
sun rises in the sky. The middle hunter ran in that direction to turn the bear
back toward the others. Next the bear ran to the west where the sun sets. The
oldest hunter and his dog ran after the bear. He called to the other hunters,
“Hurry!” And then he looked down and saw Grandmother Earth far below.
“Let’s go back,” he said, “before it’s too late.” But the bear had led them high
into the sky, and they couldn’t return.
The hunters finally caught the bear and killed it. They gathered branches
from maple trees and sumac and butchered the bear on them. The blood of the
bear is what causes those leaves to turn red in the autumn.
The four bright stars in the shape of a square are the bear. The three bright
stars and one faint star are the hunters and their dog chasing after the bear. All
year round they chase the bear around the sky.

HOT WIND AND COLD WIND
Wasco, Plateau
Stories about the forces of nature abound in Native American mythology. Some
explain their origins while others describe how things were different back in the
distant, mythological time.
The Cold Wind brothers and their little sister made a sport of challenging
anyone who came near to a wrestling match. While the brothers were wrestling,
their sister would throw a bucket of icy water on their opponents, which caused
great distress for the opponents and resulted in the Cold Wind brothers winning
every time. Coyote thought he was actually the winner in these events, since
he was able to cut off the heads of every unsuccessful challenger.
Not far away lived Eagle, his wife, and his son and daughter-in-law. With
them also lived the five Chinook Wind brothers. Eagle’s son heard the taunting
of the Cold Wind brothers but was never tempted to wrestle them. But one day
he finally gave in. The Cold Wind sister poured icy water over him, and he fell.
Coyote was there to immediately cut off his head. So the Cold Wind brothers
bragged loudly about their prowess.
Then the Chinook Wind brothers decided to avenge the death of their
friend. One by one they wrestled with the Cold Wind brothers. But each time,
the sister was there to pour icy water over them. Each of them fell, and Coyote
cut off their heads. There was no one who could defeat the Cold Wind brothers.
Eagle’s daughter-in-law was expecting a child, so she went back to her par
ents’ home. Before she left, she left a sign for her in-laws: if a red feather fell
from the top of her bed, they would know that the child was a girl. But if a white
feather fell, it was a boy, and he would come back and avenge his father’s death.
At last, the white feather fell and her in-laws knew they had a grandson.
They were happy to know that he would come soon to fight the Cold Wind.
While they waited for that day, the Cold Wind sister began tormenting them by
coming to their house every day and pouring cold water on them.
Eagle’s daughter-in-law instructed her son well. She told him about the
Cold Wind brothers and how he must prepare himself to defeat them. When he
arrived at his grandparents’, he had a large salmon with him. He asked his
Handbook of Native American Mythology
112



grandmother to roast it over the fire and carefully save all of the fat that dripped
out. He put the fat into five baskets. The young man and his grandparents hid
the baskets with the fat, and then they traveled by canoe to where the Cold
Wind brothers were waiting to wrestle.
The young man instructed his grandmother to let the Cold Wind sister
pour out her water first, and then the grandmother was to pour the oil over top.
The young man began wrestling with the first Cold Wind brother. The sister
then poured her bucket of water on him. He called for his grandmother to
quickly pour the oil on them. When she did, the Cold Wind brother fell and
Coyote pounced on him and cut off his head.
And so, the young man wrestled the second brother. Again the Cold Wind
sister poured her bucket of icy water on him and then the grandmother threw
the second container of oil. The second Cold Wind brother fell and Coyote cut
off his head. This happened with the third and fourth Cold Wind brother. When
the fifth brother fell, he pleaded for his life, but the young man answered that
the Cold Wind brothers had not shown mercy, so he would not receive any.
The Cold Wind sister ran away. But she knew she would not get far because
the Chinook Wind avenger would come for her, too. References and further reading:

HOW BLUEBIRD GOT ITS COLOR
Pima, Southwest
This story explains why Bluebird and Coyote possess their characteristic colors.
They appear together in other stories from the Southwest as well, in which
Bluebird loans feathers to Coyote so he can fly.
A long time ago, the beautiful Bluebird was once a very dull and ugly color.
Every morning for four mornings, he bathed four times in a lake that no river
flowed in or out. Each morning he sang this magic song:
“There’s blue water. It lies there.
I went in. I am all blue.”
On the fourth morning, Bluebird shed his feathers and came out of the lake
dressed only in his skin. The next morning, when he came out of the lake, he
was covered with rich blue feathers.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 113



Coyote had been watching Bluebird bathe all this time. He wanted to eat
him, but he was afraid to jump into the water. On that last morning, when
Coyote saw that Bluebird had acquired his lovely new feathers, he asked him how
he lost his ugly color. “You are more beautiful than anything that flies in the air,”
Coyote said. “I want to be blue, too.” At that time, Coyote was bright green.
Bluebird told Coyote that he had gone into the water four times on four
mornings. He taught Coyote the magic song. Coyote went into the water four
times, and the fifth time he came out as blue as the little bird.
Coyote became extremely vain because of his new color. He was so vain
that as he strolled around he looked from side-to-side, attempting to see if
anyone was noticing just how fine was his shade of blue. He looked to see if
his shadow was blue as well. Coyote was so busy looking to see if anyone
was paying him attention that he neglected to keep an eye on the trail.
Suddenly he ran into a large stump and fell into the dirt. Coyote was covered
with dust.
This is why Coyote is no longer blue and is the color of dust today.

KANATI AND SELU
Cherokee, Southeast
This story of The Lucky Hunter and his wife, Corn, two great spirits of the
Upper World, tells of the origin of game and corn. Once held very sacred by the
Cherokee, it is one of the best-known of their myths and one of the most fa
mous of the Southeastern narratives. It contains incidents that have numerous
parallels in Native American myths of various culture areas. Reflected in the
text is the belief of the Indians of the Southeast that hunting was a man’s occu
pation and agriculture the woman’s domain. The frequent recurrence of the
number seven is an indication of its importance in Cherokee ritual.
Kanati and Selu lived together with their only child, a son. One day, when
playing by the riverbank, the boy found a wild boy who claimed he was his el
der brother and told him his mother had been cruel to him and threw him into
the river. Kanati and Selu then realized the wild boy had sprung from the blood
of game Kanati had killed and Selu had cleaned at the river’s edge. Eventually,
Kanati and Selu brought the boy home and tamed him, though his disposition

114



continued to be wild and cunning. His parents soon discovered he had magical
powers, and they named him Inage-utasunhi, “He-Who-Grew-Up-Wild.”
Inage-utasunhi led his brother into every mischief. One day they followed
their father and discovered that he knew of a hole where deer are shut up under
a rock, and that he let them out and shot them with his arrows whenever he
needed meat. The boys returned later, raised the rock, and unintentionally let
out all the deer, then raccoons, rabbits, all the other four-footed animals,
turkeys, and other game birds. An angry Kanati discovered their deed and re
minded them they now must hunt all over the woods for deer and may not find
one. Then he sent them home to their mother while he stayed behind to at
tempt to find something to eat.
The boys returned home and their mother offered to feed them. Peeking be
tween the logs of their storehouse, they saw Selu lean over a basket, rub her
stomach, and make corn appear in half of it. Then she rubbed her armpits and
the basket filled to the top with beans. The boys decided their mother was a
witch, the food would poison them, and they must kill her.
When they re-entered the house, the boys admitted their intentions, but
Selu knew the boys’ thoughts before they spoke. She told them that after she
was dead, they should clear a large piece of ground in front of the house and
drag her body seven times around the circle, then drag her seven times over the
ground inside the circle. When they were finished, they should stay up all night
and watch, and in the morning there would be plenty of corn. After they killed
her, the boys only cleared seven small spots, instead of a full area, which is why
corn grows in only a few places and not everywhere in the world. They dragged
Selu’s body around the circle, and corn sprang up wherever her blood fell on the
ground. But instead of dragging her body across the ground seven times, they
only dragged it twice, which explains why Indians raise just two crops in one
season. The boys stayed up all night to watch their corn grow, and in the morn
ing it was mature and ripe.
When Kanati returned home, and did not find Selu, he asked the brothers
where their mother had gone. “We killed her because she was a witch,” they
said, “and there is her head on top of the roof of the house.” Kanati became very
angry, and said, “I will not stay with you any longer; I am going to the Wolf
people.” Not long after he left, Inage-utasunhi changed himself into a tuft of
down and landed on Kanati’s shoulder. When he came upon the Wolf people’s
settlement, they were holding a council in the townhouse. When the Wolf chief
asked him to present his business, Kanati said, “I have two bad boys at home,
and I want you to go in seven days from now and play ball against them.” The
Wolves knew the true meaning behind his words, that he wanted them to kill
the boys, and they promised to do so. The bird’s down, which he never noticed,
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 115



blew off Kanati’s shoulder and was carried through a hole in the roof of the
townhouse. When it landed on the ground outside, Inage-utasunhi assumed his
true form and went home to tell his brother all he had heard. Kanati left the
Wolf people, but did not return home.
The boys prepared for the arrival of the Wolves. They ran a wide circle
around the house until a trail was made, except on the side from which the
Wolves would come. Here a small open space was left. The brothers made four
large bundles of arrows and placed them each at different points on the outside
of the circle, after which they hid in the woods and waited. After a day or two, a
party of Wolves arrived and surrounded the house. They did not see the trail, as
they came in through the opening, but the moment they entered the circle, the
trail changed to a high brush fence and shut them in. The boys began shooting
them down with their arrows. As the Wolves were trapped by the fence and
could not jump over it, they were all killed, except for a few that escaped
through the opening to a nearby swamp. The boys ran around the swamp, and a
circle of fire broke out in their tracks, setting fire to the grass and bushes and
burning up nearly all the other Wolves. Only two or three escaped, and from
these have sprung all the other wolves that exist in the world.
Not long afterward, some strangers came to visit who had heard that the
brothers had a wonderful grain from which they made bread. Only Selu and her
family were already familiar with corn. The boys gave them seven grains of
corn and told them to plant them the next evening on their way home. They
were to sit up all night to watch the corn, which would have seven ripe ears by
morning. These they were instructed to plant the next evening and watch in
the same way, and so on every night until they reached home, a journey of
seven days. By that time, they would have enough corn for all their people. The
people did as they were told the first night, and the second, but the way home
was long, the sun was hot, and they grew tired. On the last night before reach
ing their destination they fell asleep and did not watch the corn as before, so by
morning they found what they had planted had not even sprouted. They
brought home what they had and planted it, and were able to raise a crop. Even
since, however, corn must be watched and carefully tended for half a year, when
previously it would grow and ripen in just a night.
Kanati had still not returned, so the brothers decided to leave home to go
find him. Inage-utasunhi rolled a gaming wheel in various directions, including
toward the Sunland, from which it did not return. So, they went toward the east
and finally came upon Kanati walking along with a little dog by his side. They
knew the dog was the wheel they had sent to find him. “You bad boys,” said
their father. “Have you come here? Well, as you have found me, we may as well
travel together.”

They soon approached a swamp. Kanati warned the boys to keep away from
it, as there was something dangerous there. He went on ahead, but as soon as he
was out of sight, Inage-utasunhi said to his brother, “Come and let us see what is
in the swamp.” They went in together, where they found a large, sleeping pan
ther. The boys shot the panther several times with arrows, but it merely looked
at them. It was not hurt and paid no more attention to them. The boys left the
swamp and soon found Kanati, who was waiting for them. Kanati was surprised
when they told him the panther did not hurt them, but he said nothing.
After walking farther, Kanati warned the boys of their approach to a tribe
known as the Anadaduntaski (Roasters, or cannibals). Then he went on ahead.
The boys approached a tree that had been struck by lightning, and Inage
utasunhi told his brother to gather some of the splinters. As they came to the
settlement, the cannibals came running out, crying, “Good, here are two nice
fat strangers. Now we’ll have a grand feast!” They caught the brothers and
brought them inside their townhouse, where they made up a great fire, brought
water to boil in a large pot, and put Inage-utasunhi down into it. His brother,
who was not frightened and made no attempt to escape, simply knelt down and
put the splinters into the fire, as if to make it burn faster and stronger. When
the cannibals thought their meat was ready, they took the pot from the fire. At
that instant, a blinding light filled the building, and lightning began to dart
from one side to the other, striking the cannibals until not one was left alive.
The lightning then traveled up through the smoke hole, and suddenly the boys
found themselves standing outside as though nothing had happened. They went
on again and soon overtook Kanati, who appeared much surprised to see them.
“What did the cannibals do to you?” Kanati asked.
“We met them and they brought us to their townhouse, but they never hurt
us.” the boys answered. Kanati said no more, and they traveled on.
The brothers soon lost sight of Kanati, but they kept on until they came to the
end of the world, where the sun comes out. The sky was just coming down as they
arrived, so they waited until it went up again and then went through, climbing to
the other side. There they found Kanati and Selu sitting together. They received
the boys kindly and told them they might stay there for a while, but they must
then go live in the Darkening Land, where the sun goes down. After staying with
their parents for seven days, the brothers left for the west, where they still live.
The adventures of the sons of Kanati and Selu are found in various
Cherokee stories. Known as Anisgaya Tsunsdi (Little Men) or Thunder Boys, it
is believed that low, rolling thunder is heard in the west whenever they speak
to each other. A sequel tells of how the boys are summoned by the nearly starv
ing people to teach them songs and ceremonies with which to call the deer so
they can be hunted.

KIVIOQ
Inuit, Arctic
Those in Greenland as well as the Central Eskimo of Canada know numerous
tales of the hero Kivioq. Details within the tales vary from place to place but
often involve an unfaithful wife, an abandoned son, and many harrowing
adventures.
Kivioq mourned for his dead wife and decided to travel to a distant place,
leaving his son behind. But one day the boy ran into the house and said that his
mother was outside with another man. Kivioq did not believe the son at first
but finally went to see for himself. Sure enough, there was his wife embracing
another man. Kivioq was furious. He killed them both and buried them together
in another grave.
That night when the boy was asleep, Kivioq left in his kayak. As he was
hurrying away, he thought he heard his son calling for him, but he kept pad
dling and narrowly escaped being sucked into a whirlpool. Then his kayak was
attacked by sea-lice. Only by covering his paddles with a pair of gloves was
Kivioq able to get away. He soon came upon two huge icebergs with a narrow
passage between them. As the icebergs moved in the water, the passage opened
and closed. Kivioq paddled quickly and just as he got through the passage it
closed again.
Kivioq was relieved to reach the shore, but his troubles were just beginning.
He met two women and was invited into their house. The old woman offered
him some berries mixed with fat. When Kivioq commented that the dish was
very tasty, the old woman replied that “the fat is from a very young fellow.”
Then Kivioq noticed the row of human heads lined up under the sleeping ledge.
Later, Kivioq pretended to be asleep and heard the two women plotting to kill
Handbook of Native American Mythology
118



him. The old woman wanted his head, but the younger woman wanted his geni
tals. At this Kivioq jumped up, ran out the door, and jumped into his kayak.
After some time Kivioq came to another house. A baby with a huge,
bloated stomach was the only person in it. When the baby saw Kivioq, he ex
claimed, “Grandmother has sent more food!” Immediately, Kivioq ran back to
his kayak thinking that the sea was less dangerous than the land.
He paddled on and in time the ghosts of people who had drowned climbed
onto his kayak in the hopes of drowning him, too. However, Kivioq kept pad
dling. Eventually, the ghosts of his wife and her lover attempted to climb onto
the kayak, but the other ghosts told them that there wasn’t enough room. The
wife and her lover managed to get onboard anyway. Kivioq continued paddling
and over the years traveled all along the coast and back. His kayak kept getting
heavier as more ghosts piled on, and yet he kept going.
Finally, he came upon some other kayaks that were pulling a large whale.
Standing on top of the whale was a young man. When Kivioq got close enough,
he could see that it was his now grown son. He called out, “My son, I’m your
father!” But the young man did not believe him and replied, “That could not be.
My father died a long time ago when he was pulled down into a whirlpool.
You’re only an old man with a kayak full of ghosts.”
At that, Kivioq’s heart sank, and he wept.

KOKOPELLI
Southwest
Images of the mythic Kokopelli, the mysterious, humpbacked, priapic flute player,
are found widely in rock art within a large geographic region of the Four Corners
states (Utah, Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico). Sacred to Native Americans of
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 119



the Southwest since prehistoric
times, his image was also a design el
ement on ancient pottery. He is ever
present in contemporary Native
American arts and crafts, including
jewelry, ceramics, sculpture, textiles,
and paintings. Kokopelli has gener
ated widespread fascination and pop
ular appeal, as demonstrated by his
appearance in mainstream American
culture. Kokopelli-inspired institu
tions of all kinds exist, including
hotels, restaurants, stores, and gal
leries, to name but a few examples.
Kokopelli appears as a decoration on
a variety of contemporary items such
as knick-knacks, souvenirs, business
cards, and T-shirts, and he has been
showcased in popular mainstream
literature.
The origin, significance, and
meaning of Kokopelli remain a
mystery. He is a variable and in
consistent character, and has been
interpreted as a rain priest, fertility
symbol, deity, roving minstrel or
trader, shaman or medicine man,
hunter, warrior, magician—and
even as an insect. He is not universally regarded as a trickster, though he does
share traits with many trickster characters of other Native American cultures.
Kokopelli is a figure in Hopi stories as well as rituals and ceremonies of the
Pueblo, Hopis, and Zunis. As a Hopi kachina, he is known as a bearer of gifts
and babies, a seducer of maidens, and a tutelary of hunting. Kokopell’ Mana is
Kokopelli’s female counterpart, portrayed by a man, as all kachinas are.
Passionate toward men, “she” beckons to them in a sexual manner and entices
them to race with her. If she catches one, she flings him to the ground and imi
tates copulation, much to the delight of onlookers.
The following myth explains the nature of the Kokopelli kachina:
When the village of Oraibi was first inhabited, the kachina Kokopelli was
living nearby with his grandmother. Within Oraibi there lived a beautiful girl

Indians. (Richard Cummins/Corbis)



who was so vain she rejected the advances of all the young men. Kokopelli in
formed his grandmother that he had his own intentions for this girl. His grand
mother laughed at him because he was humpbacked and far less handsome than
many of the Oraibi boys, but Kokopelli insisted he would try his luck.
Kokopelli noticed that every noon, following lunch, the girl would regularly
go to a particular spot at the edge of the mesa to perform her natural functions.
He intended to take advantage of her habit in order to win her over. He dug a
trench leading from his house to the spot where the girl was accustomed to visit.
Then he cut and hollowed out a number of reeds, from which he created a con
tinuous pipe, and laid it in the ditch. Having done this, Kokopelli filled in the
trench and smoothed it over so the girl would find nothing disturbed.
The next day the girl came to her spot as usual and bent down to relieve
herself. After she finished, she felt something stirring beneath her, and, enjoy
ing the sensation, made no attempt to investigate. It was Kokopelli’s penis that
she felt, for he had so cleverly arranged his hollow reed that on inserting his or
gan into it he was enabled, thanks to its unusual length, to direct it into the
girl’s vagina. From then on, Kokopelli never failed to take advantage of his de
vice; nor did the girl cease her regular visits to this spot. Finally, she found her
self pregnant, but neither she nor any of the village people had the slightest idea
of her lover’s identity. No one in the village ever succeeded in identifying the
girl’s sweetheart, and when she gave birth to a baby boy his paternity remained
a great mystery.
That spring, one of the men in the village announced a special foot race in
tended to reveal the father of the girl’s baby. He made a speech to the young
men and boys, inviting them to gather a bouquet of pretty flowers. The race
would take place in front of the girl as she nursed her son. Each man would ex
tend his bouquet upon finishing the race, and the baby would grab the one held
by his father.
Many of the young men still desired the girl very much, so each was eager
to win the race and be the first to offer his flowers in the hope that the baby
would grasp them. When Kokopelli heard of the race, he very much feared the
loss of his mistress. He informed his grandmother that he would compete with
the others. Again she discouraged him and expressed her fear that he would be
unlucky because the baby would not like a man as unattractive as he. Kokopelli
was persistent in his quest, however, and went out with the others to pick a
bouquet the day before the race. Kokopelli was no match for the other runners,
and finished far behind them. But none of the other racers, including the win
ner, made an impression on the baby. No sooner had the winded Kokopelli of
fered his bouquet than his son grasped it eagerly, and everyone was duly aston
ished. The sponsor of the race told the girl to take Kokopelli as her husband.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 121



The girl lived happily with Kokopelli, who was a good provider and brought
lots of rain to the village in his role as kachina. The Kwitavi group did not ap
preciate his kindness, however, because they were jealous of Kokopelli’s pretty
wife. Eventually, news of their plot to kill him and take her away reached him.
They planned to invite him to their kiva to spin yarn, where they would beat
Kokopelli to death with hidden weapons. He consulted his grandmother, who
advised him to seek help from the Spider Woman.
Spider Woman promised to aid Kokopelli by giving him good medicine. She
warned him that the Kwitavi would kill him when the time arrived to rest and
eat, upon extinguishing the fire. Kokopelli was told to chew up the medicine
and spurt it everywhere as soon as it became dark. The men would then all be
come humpbacked just like himself, and be fooled into beating each other as
they tried to find him by his hump. Spider Woman told Kokopelli to jump up
and hang on to the rafters so he would be safe.
The next day, the troubling events unfolded just as the Spider Woman pre
dicted. Yarn was spun from dark until midnight and then the men gathered for a
feast. They had hardly begun their meal when the kiva chief extinguished the
fire and plunged the kiva into total darkness. Kokopelli immediately chewed
and spurted his medicine and made his way safely to the rafters while the evil
Kwitavi men, fooled by each other’s humps, began to attack each other. Finally,
they called for light, realizing there seemed to be many humpbacks present and
not just one. They discovered some of their own men of the kiva had been
killed or injured, but that Kokopelli was unharmed.
The men from Kwitavi were witches and “two-hearted,” so they soon lost
their humpbacks and were healed of their wounds or restored to life. However,
they did not escape their just punishment, for within a few days they all died.
Alarmed by his narrow escape from death, Kokopelli moved his family to
his grandmother’s home just outside Oraibi. Here he lived peacefully and pros
pered. After a few years he had more children, enough for him to stage a dance
for his former neighbors.

KUMOKUMS
Modoc, Plateau
Kumokums (alternately spelled Kumukumts or Gmukamps) was a trickster
transformer who used mud from the bottom of Tule Lake to create the sur
rounding land. With his fingernails, he scratched grooves in the mountains so
the water could flow to the lakes. Then he went about putting people on the
earth and setting it all in order. The following Modoc tale relates the story of
Kumokums and his daughter.
At that time all was well in the world and there was plenty of food for ev
eryone in summer and in winter. Many babies were being born and every place
was getting crowded. So Porcupine discussed the problem with Kumokums. He
suggested that when old people died they should no longer stay around the vil
lage but should travel to a new home in the Land of the Dead. Kumokums con
sidered this plan and decided it was a good one. So he proclaimed that once
people died, they should go to the Land of the Dead.
Five days later, when Kumokums returned from fishing, he heard a dreadful
wailing sound coming from his house. He ran there and asked his wives what
had happened. They told him that his daughter, whom he loved dearly, had
died. Kumokums was overcome with grief and quickly sent for the medicine
man. But even though the medicine man performed all of his ceremonies, the
daughter did not return to life.
At last Porcupine went up to Kumokums and reminded him that once a
person died, they must travel to the Land of the Dead and not return. The new
way applied to everyone, even Kumokums’s beloved daughter. But Kumokums
decided to visit the chief of the Land of the Dead to try to persuade him to let
his daughter return to the living. To do that Kumokums had to send his spirit
over to the Land of the Dead.
The chief of that land asked why he was there. So Kumokums explained
that he wished to take his daughter back home with him. The chief told him
that she was his daughter now dead and called her out of the house. Then out
walked a thin skeleton. The chief said to Kumokums, “Surely you don’t want to
take her back home now that she looks like this.” But, Kumokums said, “Yes.”
He wanted his daughter back home.
So the chief of the Land of the Dead let her return, but he gave strict in
structions to Kumokums: “On your way there, press her hand four times. That
way she will once again be alive by the time you reach your own home.” He
also gave a warning, “Do not look back to the Land of the Dead no matter
what.”
Kumokums and his daughter started off. As he pressed on her bony hand,
he could feel the flesh returning. When they reached the borders of the land of
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 123



the living, he was overjoyed and turned to look at his daughter. But she was just
a pile of bones. When Kumokums opened his eyes, he was once again in his
own house.
From then on there has always been death in the world.

LAND OTTERS
Haida, Heiltsuk (Bella Bella), Tlingit, Tsimshian, Northwest Coast
Land Otters were greatly feared by many people in the areas along and near the
Pacific Northwest Coast. They were known for their cunning and treachery.
Land Otter People were believed to cause canoes and small boats to capsize.
They would then seize the souls of people who drowned and gradually turn
them into Land Otters like themselves. Shamans were called upon to intervene
and free the drowned spirits from the Land Otters’ control.
There are several myths about humans who were captured by Land Otters
after their canoes capsized and became like them. The following tale, however,
relates the story of a man who refused to yield to the Land Otters.
A certain man declared that even if he capsized he would never be captured
by the Land Otter People. But one day when he was in his canoe with his sister,
the canoe tipped over and they were thrown into the water. The man swam to
shore and soon had built a fire to dry and warm himself. It wasn’t long before he
heard a canoe pull up on the beach. He quickly looked away, since he did not
intend to be tricked if the people in the canoe were really Land Otters. When
they approached his campfire, the man jumped up and ran down to the canoe.
He grabbed the paddles and then threw them into his fire. Suddenly the canoe
and its crew were revealed to be just an old driftwood log and several minks.
On another occasion, when he was nearly asleep, he heard a woman’s voice
calling to him. She brought him food and urged him not to be afraid. But the
man had heard about the deceitful tricks Land Otters use to lure their victims
away. The woman continued to attempt to get him to eat from the bowls of food
she brought, but he just yelled at her and accused her of being a Land Otter.
This went on for several days. The woman would bring food, but the man
would refuse to have anything to do with her or her gifts. Finally, one night it

seemed as if the woman’s voice sounded like that of his drowned sister. She ad
mitted to him that she was indeed the spirit of his sister. So the man thought,
“I should not fear my sister.” At that, he ate some of her food and regained his
strength. But the man was still careful and watched for other Land Otters. Any
time a canoe came to where he camped, he would burn the paddles as before.
That way he exposed the Land Otters for what they were. After he had been
stranded there one month, a canoe with real humans came and the man was
rescued at last.

LOON WOMAN
Modoc, Shasta, Wintu, California
The loon is a popular character in Native American mythology due to its unfor
gettable cry and distinctive appearance. The Loon Woman is the most widely
known of the loon stories and explains how this rare water bird acquired its
characteristic neck markings. It is also a story of incest between siblings, a
theme commonly found in Native American myths.
There was once a couple who had many children, nine boys and one girl. As
their first child was a handsome boy, named Talimleluheres, they hid him away
from the attention of females.
The girl grew into a woman. One morning she went to a stream, where she
found a long hair. She wondered whose it was. She decided to go west and
wished to take along a guide. Her mother offered each of her brothers, but the
woman rejected them one by one, noting the hair she found did not match that
of any of them. Finally, her mother offered Talimleluheres as a guide, and the
woman was happy, as she could see his hair matched the one she had found.
After making preparations, the woman and Talimleluheres left on their jour
ney. When evening fell, she started a fire, made supper, and prepared a bed. The
woman wanted to have intercourse with her brother, who fled back to their family.
When Talimleluheres reached their home, he urged their mother and father
to go quickly. They set their earth lodge on fire, and the entire family went
whirling upwards toward the sky in the smoke.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 125



The woman sleeping in the west woke up. When she saw that
Talimleluheres had gone, she became very angry. She came toward the east, to the
burning earth lodge, where she saw no one. She chanced to look up and saw her
family going up. “I want to go, my mother, my father, I want to go,” she cried.
When they had almost reached the sky, one child looked down, and the en
tire family plunged down into the fire and burned up. As they burned, their
hearts burst from their bodies. After the fire had gone out, the woman found
and gathered up the hearts, strung them on a cord, and hung them around her
neck. She did not find Talimleluheres’s heart, which had exploded and gone to
another place, where it fell down.
Far away lived two sisters. Every afternoon they gathered wood. One day, the
older one heard singing and listened before they returned home. The next after
noon, the singing had grown louder. The older woman went nearer and nearer un
til she was upon the sound and saw damp ground. She saw something black on
the ground, which said, “Woman, come. Don’t be afraid.” The woman thought to
herself, “This must be the person who was lost long ago. It must be
Talimleluheres.” The one on the ground said, “Woman, don’t be afraid of me.
Come!” And the woman said, “Yes.” Then she looked at the one on the ground. It
was dusty, and many deer had been there. To the east, and to the west, were many
deer tracks. The woman carried wood back to where her younger sister was stand
ing. The girl said, “Where did you go? You were gone long.” They brought the
wood home. In the evening they slept, and the woman still said nothing. The next
morning they arose, and when they were ready to go after wood, she put a little
soup into a basket cup and carried it hidden under her clothes. As her younger sis
ter gathered wood, the woman took the soup and fed it to the one who lay on the
ground. He seemed a little better after he ate the soup. After she fed him, the
woman gathered wood and brought it back to the house.
The next morning, the two women got up and ate. The older one left, carry
ing the soup. The younger girl thought, “What is the matter?” She followed her
elder sister, wanting to see, and she saw. Her sister was sitting and feeding
someone soup. The younger girl went to her sister and said, “Have you discov
ered this one?”
“Yes. The one who went away long ago, the person who was lost, the per
son not found, this is the one,” she told her younger sister. They went home,
ate, and went to bed.
In the middle of the night the two women woke up and saw that a man lay
between them, a beautiful man. He who had been found by the two women had
come back to life and come to the house. He stayed there a while, and the two
women bore children, two boys. They grew and played and played, shooting at
birds. They once saw a bird and shot at it with an untipped arrow and hit it on

126



the lower leg. The bird shrieked, “Tuwetetek, tuwetetek, why did you shoot
me, cousins?”
They went and came to the woman. They sat down and she talked to them.
“Let me tell you something,” she said. “You are getting older. Over there is a
pool, there is a raft on the pool. Don’t shoot with these. Prepare good untipped
arrows of pitch wood. There, to the pool, comes every evening she who made us
kinless. She’ll come from the east around the hill. And after she comes out, this
is what she does. She stands flapping her wings. Watch carefully and shoot well,
look well and shoot, don’t miss her.”
When she had finished talking, the boys returned to their home, playing,
not saying anything. They stayed home the next day. The day after they got up,
ate, and played. They went to the pool. The sun set and it grew dark. The boys
got on the raft and rowed about, shooting at the ducks that were on the pool.
Suddenly, they heard her coming with roaring wings. She alighted on the pool
“Wuuuuk,” she said. Then she dived. She came close to the raft and got out be
side it, flapping her wings. The boys kept her in their sight the whole time, and
shot and hit her exactly at the hollow of her underarm with the untipped ar
rows of pitch wood. Then she dived into the pool and suddenly rose to the sur
face, dead. The boys dragged her to the edge of the raft and threw her on top.
Then they left and returned to the house, where they told their father they had
killed the Wukwuk.
The next morning, the boys led their father to show him the one they had
killed. “Yes,” he said, “this is she who made us kinless.” He took hold of her
and saw that she was wearing a necklace of human hearts. The man untied his
father’s heart, his mother’s heart, and the hearts of his younger brothers. Then
he cut her flesh into strips and left it. He returned to the house, bringing the
hearts of his family with him. He put them in water, with stones over them,
and went to bed in the evening. At dawn the next day, his mother, father, and
younger brothers came back to life. References and further reading:

MANABOZHO
Northeast Woodlands
Also known as Nenabush, Nanabozho, Wenebojo, Manabush, Manapus, and
other variations among the people of the north central Woodlands region, the
meaning of the name is frequently given as “Great (or Giant) Rabbit.”
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 127



Manabozho tales are numerous and depict him as a sly trickster, a foolish buf
foon, or a culture-hero. According to Helbig and Radin, Manabozho myths de
veloped over time, with the earliest being predominately of the trickster
buffoon genre while the culture-hero aspect was a more recent (although still
ancient) addition.
One tale in which Manabozho exhibits Trickster characteristics also ex
plains why the buzzard’s head lacks feathers.
Buzzard saw Manabozho walking along below him. He swooped lower and
heard Manabozho ask for a ride on his back. Buzzard consented and landed
nearby. Manabozho saw that Buzzard’s back looked slippery, so he said, “You’ll
need to be careful, or I might fall off while you are flying.” Buzzard appeared to
agree, but he was really thinking up a trick to play on him.
Manabozho climbed on Buzzard’s back and soon they were flying high over
the trees. Manabozho was frightened but held on tightly as Buzzard dipped and
circled in the sky. Eventually, Manabozho managed to look down at the ground,
but just as he did, Buzzard swerved sharply and Manabozho lost his grip. He
plummeted to the ground, landed in a crumpled heap, and hit his head so hard
he was knocked unconscious. Buzzard continued circling overhead to keep an
eye on Manabozho.
When Manabozho woke up he saw someone staring at him. He reached out,
but since he was still bleary-eyed from his ordeal, didn’t realize it was his own
buttocks until he grabbed them. Buzzard laughed heartily, but Manabozho
jumped up and threatened to get even. “I’ve got more power than you!”
Buzzard disagreed. “You can’t fool me. I can watch everything you do.”
So Manabozho walked away. When Buzzard flew off, Manabozho went to a
clearing that was visible from all directions. He knew that Buzzard only ate
dead fish and animals, so he changed himself into a dead deer. It wasn’t long be
fore bugs and worms and all sorts of creatures that live off of carcasses were
drawn to him. Buzzard saw what was going on and decided to take a look. He
was leery at first, thinking it was one of Manabozho’s tricks. But he was finally
convinced that it really was a dead deer lying there. Buzzard landed next to the
carcass and began pecking at its thigh. He dug deep into the flesh until his head
and neck were buried in it.
Manabozho suddenly squeezed his flesh around Buzzard’s head and jumped
up. “Ha! See if you can get out of this one!” he yelled. Buzzard pulled and pulled
and after some time was able to free his head. But in doing so, all of the feathers
were stripped off of his head and neck. Manabozho declared, “From now on
you’ll go around with a bare head and you’ll stink from the food you eat.”
Radin and Reagan collected a large number of myths that they called “The
Manabozho Cycle.” Among these tales is one in which Manabozho plays a

trick on his neighbor but is the one who suffers in the end. Manabozho and his
neighbor entered into a partnership. They would fish and dry their catch to
gether and then share it equally. It was a very productive business, and all of
the members of both families worked very hard. When the fishing season was
over and everyone was preparing for the long winter, Manabozho convinced his
neighbor that they should all eat his neighbor’s share of the fish first. The un
suspecting neighbor agreed. By mid-winter the neighbor’s supply of fish was
gone, but Manabozho’s was still untouched. This would not have been a prob
lem if Manabozho had shared his fish just as his neighbor had done. But the
crafty Manabozho refused to give any fish to his neighbor.
In order to keep his family from starving, the neighbor went into the woods
each day to hunt what he could. But it was not enough to keep them from being
hungry, and before winter was over their situation was getting desperate. One
day the neighbor was in the woods and heard someone talking to him. When he
turned around there was a man who instructed him to go out onto the lake,
chip a hole in the ice, and fill up his sack with the ice chips. Then he was sup
posed to go straight home. “You’ll hear voices calling your name. Do not say a
word or turn around. When you get to the cup-shaped depression near your
home, toss the sack of ice into it and go on home.”
Manabozho’s neighbor did exactly as he was told. When he heard the voices
calling after him, he just kept going. He returned home empty handed, and this
did not set well with his family. They made him leave early in the morning to
go hunt for their breakfast. When he walked by the spot where he had tossed
the sack, he was amazed to see a pool of water full of fish. He took some home
to cook and everyone ate their fill of fish. Then the family brought the remain
ing fish home to dry.
One day Manabozho walked by and saw smoke coming from the home. He
had expected them all to be dead by then. Eventually his curiosity got the best
of him. Manabozho peeked in and saw fish roasting on the fire. “Where did you
get that fish?” he asked his neighbor. “Down at the lake,” was the reply.
Eventually Manabozho’s supply of fish ran out, but spring had not yet ar
rived. So Manabozho had to resort to hunting in the woods and gathering thorn
apples. One day he heard someone behind him call his name. The man said,
“You are hungry. Go to the lake and chip a hole in it. Gather the chips in your
bag and then go home immediately. You will hear voices calling to you, but do
not speak to them, and do not turn around.”
He decided to do as instructed. However, when the voices started calling af
ter him, Manabozho forgot to do as he was told. Instead, he grabbed his axe and
spun around to face the enemy. But, no one was on the path, so Manabozho
started out for home again. Soon, however, the voices started yelling at him.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 129



Manabozho again drew his axe and faced his attackers. But as before, there was
no one behind him. He continued without any further problems and tossed his
bag into the dry pool near his home. Before he reached the door, he turned
around and saw the pool was full of fish. That night his family went to sleep
happily dreaming of the feast they would have in the morning. However, when
Manabozho returned to the pool, he found only his ice filled sack because he
had not obeyed the instructions.
Before long Manabozho returned to his neighbor and asked, “How do you
get all of that fish?” So the neighbor shared what he claimed was his secret: “I
have a fishing hole on the lake. Early each morning I go out there and dive in
with my spear. I can catch more fish than we need in just a short time.”
Manabozho thought that sounded easy. So he went to the lake, cut a hole in the
ice, and then went home to wait until morning. His neighbor was secretly
watching and later that night took a scrawny sturgeon from his pool and pushed
it down into Manabozho’s fishing hole. In the morning, Manabozho returned to
the lake. He stripped off his clothes and dove into the hole with his spear. Soon
he saw the sturgeon that had been placed there. After spearing the fish and toss
ing it onto the ice, Manabozho dove back in. He searched in vain for more fish.
The water was near freezing, so he had to climb out onto the ice, but time and
again, he dove back into the water searching for more fish.
At last Manabozho gave up and climbed out of the fishing hole empty
handed. His neighbor was waiting for him, and said snidely, “Don’t you want to
find more fish?”
Bloomfield recorded several Eastern Ojibwa tales about Nenabush (known
by other tribes as Manabozho or other variations). Nenabush was hungry so he
took some rope and went down to the river. There he saw a large number of
ducks floating near the river bank. Quietly Nenabush slipped into the water and
dove underneath them. When he had tied their legs together, he surfaced right
in the middle of them. The startled ducks flew into the air, dragging Nenabush,
who was still hanging onto the rope, behind them. Eventually the rope broke.
Nenabush fell to the ground and landed in a hollow tree.
He was stuck and pondered how he could get free. Finally he heard some
women talking as they walked along the path. When he could tell that they
were nearby, Nenabush called out, “White porcupi-i-ine! White porcupi-i-ine!”
The women decided to catch the animal and began chopping the tree with an
axe. However, they were afraid the porcupine might get away, so one of the
women took off her skirt to throw over him if he should try to escape. As they
continued to chop and the hole became larger, the other women took their
skirts off, too. Then suddenly, Nenabush darted out through the hole and ran
off with all of the women’s skirts.

Barnouw also collected a series of myths from the Wisconsin Ojibwa. In
these the Manabozho figure is called Wenebojo. These tales tell of the origin of
Wenebojo. Long ago there was an old woman and her daughter living alone. The
daughter would go out berry picking by herself. One day a strong gust of wind
came and blew her dress up. After awhile the wind subsided and the girl contin
ued to pick berries. Later the old woman grew suspicious about her daughter
and asked her if she ever saw anyone when she was out in the woods. But the
daughter denied ever seeing anyone. In time the daughter realized that some
thing was wrong and asked her mother about it. Again the old woman ques
tioned the girl whether or not she had ever seen anyone in the woods. Finally
the girl remembered the incident with the wind. And then her mother knew
that Sun had impregnated the girl.
The girl eventually gave birth to triplets. The first was like a normal baby
boy. She held him in her arms and then heard a voice tell her to put him on the
ground. The young mother didn’t do it. Finally the voice scolded her and said,
“If you had put the baby on the ground he would have walked right away like
baby animals do, but now human babies won’t walk for a year.”
The second baby was born, but it didn’t exactly look like a human child.
Finally the third baby was born, but it was a stone. The boys, who were spirits,
grew up quickly. Wenebojo, the oldest, went around killing all the little animals
he could find. His mother told him not to, but he didn’t listen to her.
The stone boy stayed at camp, but Wenebojo and the second boy went travel
ing around the country. One day on their way back to camp, Wenebojo suggested
that the two of them would be able to leave and explore more of the world if they
killed their stone brother. The second brother didn’t say a word. Wenebojo kept
asking him, but his brother replied, “You’re the one thinking about it.”
Wenebojo didn’t realize it, but the youngest brother knew what he had been
talking about doing. So when the two brothers returned to camp, the youngest
brother said, “Go ahead and do what you intend to do.” So Wenebojo took a
long handled axe and struck the stone brother. The axe didn’t have any effect.
So the brother said, “You won’t succeed unless I tell you what to do.”
Wenebojo then said, “Well, what do I need to do?” He was then instructed to
build a fire and put the stone brother into it. The brother kept telling Wenebojo to
add more wood to the fire. Then finally he said, “It is time now.” So Wenebojo
poured water over his brother and the stone cracked into pieces. That was the
first time anyone had died on earth and there were only the two brothers left.
Then Wenebojo and his remaining brother started traveling all over the
earth, but eventually his brother became tired and unable to keep up. So
Wenebojo made a hole in the ground and put his brother in it. He covered him
up and set a stone over the top so he could find him again. He promised his
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 131



brother that he would be back in four days. But Wenebojo had such a good time
traveling around that he forgot about his brother. When he finally remembered
and went back, his brother was gone.
Wenebojo cried and cried. Finally his brother heard him and spoke to him,
telling Wenebojo not to cry. Wenebojo replied, “Why did you come back? Just
go back to where you were.”
His brother said, “Now you will make it difficult for people. I will make a
road for people to travel on when they die.”
Among the Menominee there is a tale that explains why we have to work
so hard to make maple sugar. Nokomis said to her grandson, Manabush, “Go
fetch some birch bark for me. I’m going to make maple sugar.” This was new to
him, but Manabush went to the woods and stripped off some birch bark. His
grandmother made cups from the bark and then at each maple tree she cut a
hole into the bark and inserted a stick into each hole. Then she attached the
cups below the sticks. In this way, the sap ran into the cups.
Manabush went to check this out and saw the cups were full of thick
maple syrup. He stuck a finger into the syrup and then tasted it. The syrup was
wonderfully sweet. However, he returned to his grandmother and told her that
even though the syrup was the best thing he had ever tasted, it was too easy to
make. He was sure that the people would become too lazy and would only want
to sit next to the maple trees and eat maple syrup all day long.
So Manabush climbed up a maple tree and sprinkled water over top of it.
This caused the syrup to run thin. From then on people had to work hard to col
lect and boil down the syrup to make it just right.

THE MICE’S SUN DANCE
Arapaho, Plains
The following tale concerns one of the many adventures of Nihansan.
Nihansan was traveling across the prairie. He stopped when he heard drum
ming and shouting. It sounded like a Sun Dance. He looked around and finally
realized that the noise was coming from inside an elk skull. He peeked in
through one of the holes and saw a mouse tribe’s Sun Dance going on. Nihansan
was a very curious sort and wanted to see more, so he shoved his head in farther
and farther. The frightened mice scattered out through other openings.
Then Nihansan realized that his head was stuck inside the elk skull. He
wandered around bumping into all sorts of trees. Each time he encountered a
tree, he asked what kind it was. They replied, “dogwood,” “bow wood,”
“Pawnee wood,” “praying bush,” “cottonwood,” “willow.” With each reply, he
knew he was getting closer to the river. Eventually Nihansan came to the river
bank and fell into the water.
He floated downstream for a while until he came to a place where the
women were bathing. When he drew near, he pleaded with them to hit him
hard across the middle of the skull. So they did. The skull cracked open, and the
broken pieces became the scrapers the women use when working with hides.
In a similar story, the trickster Veeho came upon mice holding a powwow
in an elk skull. He watched the intriguing ceremonies and dances until he could
no longer stand it. He, too, pushed his head into the skull as the mice fled.
Veeho, however, found his way home to his wife. He asked for her help, and she
willingly obliged by whacking him over the head with a large stick. Of course,
many of her blows missed the mark and landed on his back and shoulders in
stead. She complained that he was not standing still, but finally she cracked the
skull open with a hefty wallop from the stick.

MOUNTAIN LION
Kawaiisu, Great Basin
Both Mountain Lion and Coyote figure prominently in Kawaiisu mythology. As
with many Native American myths, this one incorporates explanations for the
peculiarities of a particular species.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 133



One day, while the twin sons of Mountain Lion and his wife, Jackrabbit,
were being cared for by their grandmother, Coyote kidnapped them and hid
them in a canyon. When Jackrabbit returned home to find her sons missing, she
cried, putting fire and ashes on her head as she did so. The brown spot found on
the back of cottontails’ heads is from the ashes. She searched for Coyote and the
children but found no trace of them.
When Mountain Lion returned home and found his sons gone, he cried all
night. He left his home to search for them and roamed all over the mountains
and the plain for years, but found no trace of them. His tears of sadness caused
streaks on his face that are visible on mountain lions’ faces to this day. In the
meantime, both his wife and the grandmother died, and Coyote raised
Mountain Lion’s sons with his own children.
Finally, Mountain Lion discovered his sons when they were out hunting
deer. He approached them and explained that Coyote was not their father,
which they suspected because they looked different from his other children.
Mountain Lion told them how Coyote had stolen them from their grandmother,
and how he had been searching for them for many years.
Mountain Lion and his sons tricked Coyote by luring him to a deer carcass
lying under an oak tree, where Mountain Lion took his revenge by killing him.
He then went to Coyote’s house and killed his wife and children. Mountain
Lion and his sons went to live in the mountains. Ever since that day, mountain
lions have had no homes and wander about.

MOUSE WOMAN
Haida, Tlingit, Tsimshian, Northwest Coast
Mouse Woman appears in a variety of myths. A secondary but nonetheless im
portant character, she exhibits great wisdom and offers sound advice to humans
and other animal-persons.
In the Tsimshian tale “The Prince who was taken away by the Spring
Salmon,” the young son of a chief had an encounter with Mouse Woman.
The boy was scolded severely by his mother for stealing a piece of dried
salmon that she’d been saving in a box for two years. So that night the boy ran
away and hid in a place downstream. Later a canoe pulled up, and the men in
Handbook of Native American Mythology
134



the canoe told him to get in so they could take him to his father. Instead, they
took him to another village, where he was escorted into the great chief’s house.
When he sat down, Mouse Woman came up next to him and asked the boy
if he knew why he was there. “No,” the boy replied. Then Mouse Woman told
him that he was in the house of the great Spring Salmon chief. The chief had
been very ill for two years, but when the boy took him out of the box, he began
to feel better.
Mouse Woman asked him for his woolen ear ornaments. After they had
been toasted in the fire, she ate them. Then she told the boy, “When you get
hungry, go out and club one of the children who are playing on the hill behind
the village. Then roast and eat him. Be sure to gather all of the bones and burn
them in the fire.”
The next day when the prince was hungry, he did just what Mouse Woman
had told him to and immediately the child turned into a Spring Salmon. Mouse
Woman also advised the boy that right after eating salmon, he should drink
fresh water. That way the salmon would have water and would be renewed
again.
The boy had more adventures in the land of the Spring Salmon, but finally
headed home. When he arrived, he told his father and the rest of the people
what he had learned from Mouse Woman: don’t keep dried salmon in a box; if
fresh salmon is cooked, all of the bones should be burned; and drink fresh water
after eating a meal of salmon. By observing these things, the people would al
ways have a good supply of salmon.

NALUSA FALAYA AND KASHEHOTAPOLO
Choctaw, Southeast
The Nalusa Falaya are anthropomorphic beings about the size of a man, with
shriveled faces, very small eyes, long noses, and long, pointed ears. They walk
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 135



upright and speak with voices that sound human. They live in dense woods
near swamps and resemble Kashehotapolo.
A Nalusa Falaya will appear at dusk and call to hunters, who become so af
fected they fall to the ground and sometimes even lose consciousness. It will
then bewitch the hunter by inserting a small thorn into his hand or foot, giving
him the power to do evil to others. However, the hunter remains unaware of
this power until it is evidenced by his malevolent actions. Young Nalusa Falaya
children possess the ability to remove their internal organs at night, causing
them to appear as small, luminous bodies that may be seen along the edges of
marshes.
Kashehotapolo is part man, part beast. His head is small, and his face is
shriveled. His body is that of a man, but his legs and feet are those of a deer. He
utters a sound that resembles a woman’s cry; hence his name (kasheho,
“woman,” and tapalo, “call”). He lives in low-lying, swampy areas and delights
in slipping up behind hunters who venture near his home and frightening them
before running swiftly away.

NAUGHTY GRANDCHILDREN
Pima, Southwest
The following story explains why the saguaro cactus and palo verde grow in the
Southwest.
There was once an old woman who had two mischievous and disobedient
grandchildren. Although she tried hard to please them and teach them manners,
she was unsuccessful. Every morning she ground maize to make them porridge,
but the children would always run round around the fire and kick over the olla
water, so more would have to be brought from the spring.
The grandmother finally told them she was tired of their bad behavior. If
they wanted to eat, she told them, they would have to go get more water them
selves. So, the grandchildren went to the spring and brought more water. But
again they ran around the fire, knocking the olla over. They went to get more
water, and ran around the fire again after their return, spilling the water. This
occurred over and over.
Finally, one of the grandchildren, tired of fetching water, decided to turn
himself into a saguaro, so he could store water inside himself all the time. The
Handbook of Native American Mythology
136



other grandchild decided to turn himself into a palo verde, so he could store wa
ter inside himself, too, and so the mountains would be green.
Soon afterwards, the grandmother started searching for her grandsons, but
the thorns of the saguaro and the palo verde kept her away. And so these plants
grow everywhere in that place, the children of those mischievous children. References and further reading:

NIHANSAN
Arapaho, Plains
Nihansan (also spelled Nihanca or Nihancan) is depicted in some myths as the
one who commanded Duck to bring up mud from below the water. From this
mud, Nihansan formed the earth and created people. Other stories, such as the
following, show him to be a selfish buffoon, with many trickster-like qualities.
Frequently, these stories relate how his impulsiveness and voracious sexual ap
petite got him in trouble.
Nihansan was traveling along when he came upon a man who was tossing
his eyes up into the top of a tree. Nihansan was very curious and watched from
a distance. The man tossed his eyes up and then shortly afterward commanded
them to return to him. Finally, Nihansan approached the man and asked to be
taught how to do this trick. At first the man hesitated and told Nihansan that
he was surely smart enough to figure it out himself. But Nihansan kept asking.
Finally the man relented and explained how to do it. However, he warned that
the trick should not be done too often and only when necessary.
Then they parted, each going off in a different direction. Nihansan came to
some trees and decided to try out his new skill. He tossed his eyes up into the
top of one of the trees and then commanded them to return back to their sock
ets. This went flawlessly. Nihansan continued walking until he came to an
other grove of trees and then a third. Each time he tossed his eyes up into the
trees and they returned when he commanded them.
Later on he was stalking something through tall grass. When he came to
some trees, he decided to get a better view of his prey by tossing his eyes into
the trees. However, this time when he commanded them to return, they did
not. He gave the command again and again, but without success. Blindly, he felt
his way down to the riverbank. He could hear small animals scamper by him.
He asked a mouse if he could borrow his eyes. The mouse complied, but they
were too small and fell out of Nihansan’s eye sockets. He gave them back and
then went on asking other animals he met for the use of their eyes. None of
them worked for him. Finally an owl gave Nihansan his eyes. That is why his
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 137



eyes are now yellow. (Another version of this myth ends with Nihansan receiv
ing eyes from a mole—and that is why moles are blind to this day.)
Nihansan took advantage of women in many of his exploits, but in the case
of Whirlwind-Woman, he was rebuffed and overpowered.
Nihansan was traveling along and met Whirlwind-Woman. “Get out of my
way!” he growled at her. So she spun away leaving a trail of dust behind her.
Later he met her along the road and said, “Go away!” At this she quickly
moved on. Still later, their paths crossed again. This time Nihansan was very
emphatic and told Whirlwind-Woman that he did not want her around and that
he really didn’t like her at all. She whirled away as before, but not long after
ward came to the spot where Nihansan was walking along the river.
Nihansan began to have second thoughts about Whirlwind-Woman. He ap
proached her and said he thought they should be sweethearts. Whirlwind
Woman said that would not be possible, as she was forever traveling around.
Nihansan said, “Me, too. I’m always traveling.” And then to prove that they
would be compatible, he started spinning around and around and stirred up a lot
of dust. She wasn’t impressed, so he spun faster and faster and threw dust
higher in the air. She still refused his offer. When he brought up the subject
again, she lost patience with him and with a great whirl she spun all around
him. The powerful wind picked him up and threw him down head first. By the
time Nihansan had collected his wits about him, Whirlwind-Woman was al
ready far away.

OLD MAN
Siksika (Blackfeet), Plains
Old Man shaped the mountains, hills, streams, and prairies. Then he created
vegetation, people, and animals. Old Man also, at times, exhibited trickster-like
qualities.
Old Man was traveling around. As he traveled he formed the earth’s fea
tures and then created the grasses, shrubs, and trees to cover them. He made the
animals and placed them where they would be best suited. Then he decided to
make a woman and a child. He formed them out of clay and four days later they
came alive. He told them that his name was Napi (Old Man.) Later the woman
Handbook of Native American Mythology
138



asked Old Man what would become of them. Would they live forever, or would
they die? Old Man decided on a test. He told the woman that he would toss a
buffalo chip into the river. If it floated, then people would live, but if it sank,
then they would die. He tossed the dried buffalo chip into the river and it
floated. However, the woman picked up a stone and said, “If it floats we will
live forever, but if it sinks, there will be death.” So the woman tossed the stone
into the river and it sank. Therefore all people must die. Sometime later, the
woman’s child died. She regretted the law about death and asked Old Man if
they could change it. “No,” he said, “What has been made law is unchangeable.
People will die and not live forever.”
At first the people did not know how to hunt. Instead, the buffalo had
weapons and would capture and eat humans. But, Old Man decided that would
not do at all. So he taught the people how to hunt animals, and how to gather
plants, nuts, and fruit for their food. He also taught them about the power of
medicinal herbs. Old Man taught them how to make fire so they could cook
their food and keep warm.
There are numerous stories about Old Man and his “trickster” adventures.
A few of them are related here:
Old Man was traveling around with Coyote when they passed a large rock.
Old Man was tired of carrying his heavy buffalo hide blanket. So he left it on
top of the rock and they continued on their journey. A little later the sky
looked as if it would rain, so Old Man sent Coyote back for the blanket.
However, the rock refused to let him have it, saying, “Once you give a gift to a
rock, you can never take it back.” Several times Old Man sent Coyote back,
but the rock would not let go of the blanket. Finally, Old Man went himself.
He grabbed the blanket off the rock and then started back on his travels with
Coyote. Suddenly they heard an ominous rumble behind them. When they
looked back there was the rock quickly rolling in their direction. They both
ran up a hill, but the rock could not follow them. That is why rocks cannot
roll up hill today.
Old Man and Fox were out hunting but had not been successful. One day
they spotted four buffalo bulls lying at the bottom of a hill, but Old Man could
not see a way for them to sneak up on the buffalo. Finally, he had a plan. It was
the only way he could think of to get close enough to the buffalo. The plan
called for Old Man to pluck out all of Fox’s hair, except for at the very end of his
tail. Then Fox would walk down to the buffalo and prance around them. The
theory was that the buffalo would find the sight of a bare naked Fox hilarious.
They would laugh so hard that Old Man would be able to sneak right up to
them and kill them. Fox could not think of a better idea, so he finally agreed.
The plan worked exactly as Old Man had predicted.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 139



While Old Man was butchering the buffalo, the weather turned colder and
the wind picked up. He kept talking to Fox as he worked, “Little brother, you
were wonderful. The bulls laughed so hard, and I nearly died laughing myself.
What a funny sight!” Fox didn’t answer because he was shivering so hard that
his teeth were chattering. The wind became colder and snow started falling. Old
Man just kept on working and kept on talking about the comical performance
Fox had given.
Finally all of the buffalo were skinned and butchered. Old Man got up and
said, “It’s getting cold. But we won’t mind. We have enough meat to last all
winter.” But Fox did not answer. Old Man was irritated and said, “What’s the
matter with you? Didn’t you hear me?” Still there was no response from Fox. So
Old Man walked over and gave Fox a shove, but Fox fell over. He had frozen to
death in the cold.
Old Man was traveling. One day he came to where the Sun lived and was
invited to stay a while. Sometime later, all of the meat was gone, so Sun sug
gested that they go hunting for some deer. Then Sun retrieved a pair of beautiful
leggings he had stored in a bag. He explained that the leggings had great
medicine. When he was hunting, he would walk through the brush and the leg
gings would set it on fire, thus driving the deer out of hiding.
So they went hunting, and just as Sun had said, the leggings started the
brush on fire. Old Man and Sun were each able to kill a deer when they ran out
of the brush. That night, Sun removed his leggings, and Old Man watched where
he stored them. While everyone else was sleeping, Old Man stole the leggings
and hurried off. He traveled a long way and finally was too tired to go any far
ther. He made a pillow out of the leggings and then went to sleep. In the morn
ing, he was awakened by Sun asking him, “Why do you have my leggings?”
When Old Man opened his eyes, he was back in Sun’s lodge. Old Man thought he
must have gotten lost and accidentally ended up back there. That night, after ev
eryone was asleep, Old Man again stole the leggings and fled. This time he kept
running until it was almost morning. Finally he was too tired to go any farther.
But when he awoke, he was back in Sun’s lodge. He didn’t realize that the entire
world belonged to the Sun and he could never run away from him. But Sun de
cided to let Old Man have his leggings since he liked them so much.
Later on, when Old Man’s food was nearly gone, he decided to put on the
leggings and set fire to some brush. However, as he was taking aim at some
deer, he realized that the fire was burning toward him. He tried to run away, but
the flames caught up with him and set the leggings on fire. Just then he came to
a river and jumped in. But it was not in time to save the leggings.
Old Man had been traveling around for a long time. He decided that it was
time to settle down and get a wife. Wherever he went he asked the people if
Handbook of Native American Mythology
140



there were any single women around who wanted to get married. Finally, he
learned about a woman whose husband had died and left her with two daugh
ters who were nearly grown. Old Man went to visit the woman and asked her to
marry him right then. Much to his surprise, she said, “Yes.” So they began liv
ing together that day. Life went on smoothly until one day when Old Man had a
close look at his stepdaughters. He began thinking that they would soon have
young men courting them. Suddenly he felt jealous and decided that he wanted
the girls for himself.
About that time someone in the village died and was buried under a pile of
stones on a hilltop. That gave Old Man an idea. He began to act sick and be
came worse as the days went by. Finally, he told his wife and stepdaughters that
a spirit had visited him and told him that he would soon die. The spirit also
said that a stranger would come to their tipi four days after he died. The step
daughters were to marry this stranger. Old Man also told them that the spirit
gave instructions about how he should be buried. They were not to cover his
body with stones, but with only a few thick robes.
And so it was that Old Man breathed his last breath. His lifeless body was
carried to the hilltop and buried as they had been instructed. Old Man, of
course, was not really dead. He waited several days under the robes, and when
no one was around, he sneaked away from the grave site. Meanwhile, his wife
and stepdaughters waited in their tipi for the stranger to arrive. Four days later a
man who was painted with yellow earth came to the tipi and took the girls for
his wives. Eventually, one of the girls noticed a long scar on the man’s right leg.
She reported this to her mother and sister. “It looks exactly like the scar our
stepfather had on his leg.” Over the next few days, the mother and daughters
tried to get a look at the man’s scar. Finally, they were convinced that it was
Old Man. One day the three women waited inside the tipi with clubs in their
hands. When Old Man came in, they all started beating him, but he ran out and
kept on running because he realized that the women had figured out what he
had done.

OTTERS AND COYOTE
Navajo, Southwest
A story about gambling that incorporates explanations for the characteristics of
different species of animals.
One day some Otters were entertaining themselves by gambling. Coyote ap
proached them and asked if he could take part in the game. Having heard what a
rascal Coyote was, the Otters refused and told him to go away. Coyote stayed
and pleaded with them, and eventually the Otters invited him to join them.
Coyote foolishly bet his skin and lost. The Otters rushed him and tore
the hide off his back, beginning at the root of his tail and pulling forward, de
spite his piteous cries of pain. He wailed terribly when they reached the end
of his nose, which was most sensitive. When they were finished, Coyote
jumped into the water, as he had seen the Otters do, and hoped his skin would
come back. He jumped into the water again and again, but he always came
out as bare as before. Coyote had had a glossy, beautiful pelt like the Otters,
but now it was gone.
Finally, Coyote grew exhausted and lay down in the water. Taking pity on
him, the Otters pulled him out and threw him into a badger hole, and covered
him with dirt.
When Coyote had dug his way out of the badger hole, his fur had reap
peared, but it was not like the fur he had once had. Now, it was coarse and
rough and dull, and Coyotes have worn such fur ever since.
Coyote did not learn any kind of lesson from this experience, however. He
challenged the Otters to further play and bet his new skin. The Otters just
scoffed at him and told him to go away, as no one would play for his skin now.
This angered Coyote, who retired to a safe distance and began to taunt and de
ride the Otters.
“You are nothing but braggarts,” he cried. “You pretend to be brave, but
you are cowards. Your wives are ugly, just like you.” After a while, he retreated
to a cliff and continued his taunts and insults from there.
The Otters decided they would suffer his abuse no longer, so they sent
word to the chiefs of the Spiders and asked for their help. The Spiders crept up
the cliff behind Coyote and wove strong webs in the trees and bushes. When
they had finished, they told the Otters what they had done. The Otters went up
the cliff to attack Coyote, who pretended to be unconcerned and allowed them
to come very close. He turned to run but was soon caught in the webs.
Handbook of Native American Mythology
142



The Otters seized Coyote and dragged him down to the foot of the hill. The
Cliff Swallows flew down from the canyon walls and tore Coyote to pieces, car
rying off fragments to their nests. They tore his skin into strips and made them
into bands that they put around their heads. This is why these birds have bands
on their heads today. Eventually, Coyote came back to life, but he resented how
badly the Otters and Spiders and Cliff Swallows had treated him, and so he plot
ted his revenge.

OWL
The nocturnal owl, viewed with mystery and awe, is a prominent figure among
Native Americans north of Mexico. To some tribes, he is a wise and friendly ad
visor. To others, he is a protector that warns against danger or an approaching
enemy, or a prophet that foretells the weather, impending death, or the coming
of good news. He is also a benefactor or source of power; sometimes, he is a de
structive and malevolent figure who can cause death or disease. Some tribes
honor and respect the owl, believing it to be a sacred creature. The owl is often
found on Indian pottery, stoneware, and basketry.
In the following Pawnee story, a poor boy is pitied by owls, who give him
nocturnal vision:
Long ago, the people moved south to a forested area and made their village.
Here, they found much game, which kept them well fed, and a peaceful life, as
enemies appeared to be far away and there were no wars.
Living among these people was a poor orphan boy with no relatives. He
made his home with an old woman who lived in a grass lodge. He would sit out
side and watch the men carrying home deer and other game. The boy decided to
leave his people and the village, as he thought it would be better if he died.
He made his way through the timbered land for many days, expecting to be
killed by wild animals. Finally, he stopped and cried. His strength had given
out, as he had not eaten since he left his village. He stayed in this place for sev
eral days.
One night, as the boy stood in despair and was about to kill himself, a voice
from the tops of the trees spoke to him and said, “My son, leave this place; go
back toward your home, and you will come to a lone, dry oak tree, standing in
the open. Inside this tree is our home. Stop there and we will speak to you, and
then you shall see us. So the boy went back toward his village, and by daylight
had found the tree. Here he stopped, and he cried all day.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 143



During the night, another
voice spoke to him. He looked up
at the tree and saw two owls sitting
on a limb. One was white, the
other red. The white owl said “We
know you are poor; we know you
want to kill yourself, so we brought
you here. You can see us plainly,
even though it is dark. We are the
leaders of all the other owls who
live in this forest. We go out in the
night and kill all kinds of birds to
eat. We will each give you one
feather and ask you to start for
home at once. Put them in your
scalp-lock, then leave the lodge,
close your eyes, and you will see as
you do in the daytime; you will see
raccoons, otter, and deer, but to
them, you will be invisible.”
The owl then told the boy to
make a bow and some arrows, and
to put the two feathers in his hair.
The owl instructed him to kill first
a raccoon, then a turkey, an eagle,
and several deer. After he had killed
the deer, the boy was to come back
to talk to the owls again. He
obeyed them and went home.
The old woman was very happy
to see the boy. She took care of him
and fed him, and he became strong again. He did as the owls told him and made a
bow and arrows. He put the two owl feathers in his hair and left the lodge. He
closed his eyes, and as he walked along he opened them, and could see a raccoon
beside a creek. He shot at it and killed it. The proud boy took it home—and killed
several rabbits along the way. The woman was very thankful, because before she
had been obliged to beg for meat.
The next night, the boy killed several turkeys and put some of their feath
ers on his arrows. The night after that, he killed an otter along the bank of the

stream. The woman took the hide to a medicine man and exchanged it for
flints, which the boy put on the ends of a new set of arrows he made.
The boy went out with his flint-tipped arrows and killed several deer. He
continued to go out and bring in game, and he and the old woman now had a lot
of meat and many types of buckskin, which the woman had tanned.
White traders arrived at this time, and the boy sold them his furs and buck
skins. Some he traded for knives and steel to make arrow points. He went out
to hunt more often during the night and was able to acquire enough skins to
trade for a rifle. He got many more hides and furs, and traded them to another
Indian for a pony. He traded more game to hunters for buffalo hides, so the
woman was able to have a buffalo-hide tipi.
One night, the boy went back to the owls and stayed until one spoke to
him. It told him they were glad he was having success, and to get many ponies,
and keep them, for he would soon leave and go north.
So the boy went home again and traded more furs and hides for several
ponies. He continued to kill more game and traded it for more ponies and cloth
ing and blankets.
Again he went to the tree to see the owls. One told him they were glad he was
now so well off, that he should now find a woman, and then return to them. The
boy returned home and the old woman found a girl who consented to marry him.
The boy returned to the owls again. One of them said, “The power we gave
you to see while hunting is gone, but we give you the feathers so that you can
wear them. When you try to take ponies from your enemies, you can see
clearly. Now, the only time we give you power to see will be in February, when
all animals are abroad at night seeking their mates. Return home and we will
come to you in your dreams, so that you will learn to be a medicine man.”
The boy went home and stayed in the village for a while. He joined a party
that went north. He became a great warrior and, in time, a great medicine man.
His power to see in the dark eventually left him, but he became a power among
his people.
An Iroquois story explains why the owl has such big eyes.
The Everything-Maker, called Raweno, was working to create various ani
mals. He was busy with Rabbit, who told him he wished to have long legs and
ears like a deer, and the sharp claws and fangs of a panther. Roweno liked to
give the animals exactly the characteristics they asked for.
Owl was sitting nearby in a tree, awaiting his turn and watching. He told
Raweno that he wanted to be turned into the fastest, most beautiful and most
wonderful of all the birds. He asked for Swan’s long neck, Egret’s long beak,
Cardinal’s vibrant red feathers, and Heron’s crown of plumes.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 145



Raweno was displeased. He ordered Owl to be silent and turn away or close
his eyes, because no one was allowed to watch him do his work. At that mo
ment, he was making Rabbit the long ears for which he had asked.
Owl refused to do as Raweno commanded. “Whoo, whoo,” he replied. “I
can watch if I want to. No one can forbid me to do so or order me to close my
eyes. I enjoy watching you, and watch I will!”
This made Raweno angry. He grabbed Owl and pulled him down from his
branch, stuffing his head deep into his body, shaking him until his eyes grew
large with fright, and pulling at his ears until they were sticking up on both
sides of his head.
“There! That will teach you,” said Raweno. “Now you cannot crane your
neck and watch things you should not watch. Your eyes are large but not so
large that you can watch me, as you will be awake only after dark, and I work
during the day. Your ears are now large, so you can listen when someone tells
you not to do something. And as punishment for your disobedience, your feath
ers will be gray, not red like Cardinal’s”—and with that remark, Raweno rubbed
Owl with mud. Owl flew off, pouting “Whoo, whoo, whoo.”
Raweno turned his attention back to Rabbit, who was quivering with
fright, even though Raweno’s anger was directed at Owl. Rabbit ran off only half
completed. As a result, only Rabbit’s hind legs are long, and he can only hop
about instead of walk or run. Because he took such fright at that moment,
Rabbit has remained afraid of most everything, and he was never given the

As for Owl, he remained as he was formed by Raweno in anger, with large
eyes, a short neck, and ears that stick up prominently on each side of his head.
In addition, he now sleeps during the day and comes out only after dark. References and further reading:

PEOPLE BROUGHT IN A BASKET
Modoc, Plateau
A Modoc explanation of how people came to be in this world.
Old Man (Kumush) traveled to the land of the underworld spirits. He fol
lowed a long, steep road and came to a place where a vast number of spirits
Handbook of Native American Mythology
146



lived. At night the spirits danced and sang, but in the morning they went back
to their houses and were dry bones. After spending several days there, Kumush
missed the sun and decided to return home with some of the spirits’ bones. He
wanted to use the bones to make people for the earth.
He selected various bones to be used for the different tribes, thinking some
would be good for one tribe and other bones better for other tribes. When the
basket was full, Kumush started up the steep road. But near the top he tripped
and the basket fell off his back. The bones turned into spirits that sang as they
hurried back to their homes in the spirit world.
Kumush filled his basket a second time and started to climb up the trail.
But once again he stumbled and the spirits escaped. Then he went back and
filled his basket again. This time he scolded the bones and told them that once
they saw his world and the sunshine, they would be happy to stay with him. So
up the steep trail he went and when he neared the edge, he tossed the basket up
onto the ground.
Then he set about the task of putting the bones in various places and giv
ing the people names. He tossed some to the west and declared that they
would be the Shastas and would be brave warriors. He told other people, the
Pit River Indians and Warm Springs Indians, that they would be brave warriors
also. Then just to the north he tossed the bones that would become the
Klamath, saying that they would be easily frightened and would not make
good warriors.
Finally he chose the bones that would become the Modoc Indians. He
spoke to them, saying, “You will be the bravest.” He told them that they would
be his chosen people and would be able to fight off all who came against them.
He also instructed all the people that certain ones would need to go to the
mountains if they sought wisdom or special powers.
Kumush also created the fish and animals and the plants and berries for the
people to eat. He also made the laws about how people would work. Men, he
said, would be the warriors, hunters, and fishermen. Women would stay near
their homes to gather wood and water as well as the berries and roots to cook
for their families.
After Kumush had created his world, he traveled with his daughter to near
where the sun rises in the east. From there they traveled along the sun’s path
until they reached the middle of the sky. That’s where they still live today. References and further reading:

POTLATCH, ORIGIN OF
Various, Northwest Coast
Potlatches are formal ceremonies that combine feasting, dancing, athletic compe
titions, storytelling, and the distribution of gifts to audience members. Often they
were held in conjunction with other events such as naming ceremonies, puberty
rites, marriages, funerals, totem pole raising, or house building. The prestige of
the host was at stake, for the more generous he was, the more he was respected.
But elaborate potlatches did not necessarily impoverish the host, because as oth
ers held their own ceremonies, gifts would be given in return. Because Europeans
did not understand the socioeconomic function of the potlatch and related cere
monies, potlatches were banned in Canada from 1884 until 1951.
In times past, a potlatch, which had religious as well as economic signifi
cance, could last for several days. Today, potlatches often are concluded in one
day. Although the potlatch was widespread across the Northwest Coast culture
area, it varied in form and scale among the tribes. Here is a Quileute version of
how the potlatch originated.
Once, an unusual-looking bird appeared near the village. All the young
hunters went out to kill it, but none were successful. Every day they went out,
but no one could kill the bird. Then Golden Eagle said to Blue Jay, his slave,
“My daughters could get that bird.” Blue Jay was surprised at what Golden

Eagle said, because girls did not hunt. But Golden Eagle’s daughters overheard
what was said. The next day they went to the woods and stayed all day. For sev
eral days they went back, but did not tell anyone where they were going or
what they were doing.
Then one day, after the hunters had gone out in their canoes to hunt the
strange bird, the girls ran to the woods to get the bow and arrows they had
made. They disguised themselves and paddled out until they were near the bird.
The older sister shot her arrows and one killed the bird. Later that night, they
told their father what they had done. “We’ve hidden the bird in the woods and
want to give the beautiful feathers away as gifts,” she said.
So Blue Jay went around inviting people to ceremony. When everyone was
gathered in the house, the girls gave the colorful feathers away. Yellow and
brown feathers were given to Meadowlark, red and brown ones to Robin, yellow
and black to Finch, and so on until they had given away all of the feathers.
Since that time, birds have feathers of those colors. And that was the first
potlatch where people gave gifts to the people who were invited. References and further reading:

PRAIRIE DOG
Jicarilla, Southwest
The Jicarilla told two stories that reflected their belief that the prairie dog had
powers associated with water. In the first story, a warrior dying of thirst is saved
when a prairie dog takes pity on him, leads him into his home, and gives him a
vessel of water. Although it is but a small amount, the water saves him from
death and lasts for four days, enough for him to return home to his people.
In the second story, a man is very thirsty but does not know where to find
water—so thirsty that he has done everything he can to lighten his load, includ
ing throwing away his arrows, quiver, and everything heavy. He lies down to
beg for water at a prairie dog’s hole. Eventually, the prairie dog brings out a very
small cup of water and gives it to him. The man doubts that it would be enough
to quench his thirst, but he takes the cup and drinks and from it. He finds that
he cannot not finish it. His mind begins to clear, and he soon feels much better.
Prairie Dog tells the man to pick up his bow and arrows and his blanket
and start walking, and he would find more water. The man does as Prairie Dog

says, and he soon arrives at a place where there has been much rain, and he
knows that Prairie Dog sent it.

QUMU?UC
Ute, Great Basin
Qumu?uc is the hot-rock medicine that Bear hides in the hollow of a tree and
from which he gains his strength as he dances and sings.
In one story, the chief Sunawavi (Wolf) heard that Bear was approaching his
village. Bear had been murdering people, so Sunawavi told the men to watch for
him. He instructed them, “Track him backwards, because we have heard that
he always puts his medicine near a village. Take plenty of water jugs and put
out the fire of the rock. Take many boys with you.”
They searched and found the red-hot rock hidden in the trees and poured
water on it, which turned it black. The villagers rushed home to report their
success to Sunawavi. Bear was then invited to a dance in the village and told to
sing a song. He sang “My hot rock, I am here, help me.” The rock would then
usually come to kill people, but this time it did not. He repeated the song, but
nothing came, because the qumu?uc had been extinguished. Then all hit Bear
over the head and disabled him.

RABBIT
Ottawa, Northeast Woodlands; Natchez, Southeast; Ute, Great Basin
In the myths from the Northeast Woodlands related by Brinton, this figure is
called Michabo, Giant Rabbit, the greatest of all animals. Rabbit instructed
mankind how to hunt and fish and how to perform religious ceremonies. He
was also instrumental in the creation of the world as we know it. The following
is an Earth Diver myth, this time with Rabbit as the creator of the earth.
In the beginning water covered the earth. A raft floated on the water, and
on the raft was Rabbit and several other animals. They all wished for land to
live on, so Rabbit ordered beaver to dive to the bottom of the water to bring up
some mud. Beaver willingly obeyed but returned after a long time without hav
ing reached the bottom. Next Rabbit ordered the otter to try. He, too, returned
Handbook of Native American Mythology
150



after a long absence, but without having succeeded. Finally Muskrat volun
teered to dive to the bottom, and Rabbit consented. She was gone so long that
the others on the raft gave up on ever seeing her alive again. At last, Muskrat
floated to the surface of the water and was pulled, unconscious, onto the raft. In
one of her paws was a tiny bit of mud. She had succeeded on her mission! The
other animals were soon able to revive her.
Rabbit took the tiny bit of mud and formed an island and then a mountain.
As the earth grew and grew, Rabbit walked around its edges to see what it was
like and how big it was. Rabbit then created trees by shooting his arrows into
the ground.
One version of the story explains that Rabbit and Muskrat married and hu
mans are their offspring. Rabbit cared for his children and taught them many
things that they would need to live on their own.
In the Southeast, there were numerous tales about Rabbit and his adven
tures. The following tale, related by Swanton, is from the Natchez.
The chief of all the animals let them each chose the kind of food they
wished to eat. Squirrel chose acorns; Opossum, Raccoon, and Fox chose persim
mons; the birds selected grapes; and so on. Rabbit decided he wanted the balls
that hang from the sycamore tree. He sat under a tree and waited for a ball to

Refuge, New Mexico. (North Wind Picture Archives)



drop. But when it did, it just scattered everywhere. Finally he got hungry and
went to the chief to ask for something else. The chief said, “If you get me some
thing I want to eat, I’ll fix it so you can have something you want.”
So Rabbit took off and soon arrived at the place where Alligator lived. He
called for Alligator to come out. “Why should I?” he asked.
“Well, the chief wants you to hew a post for him,” Rabbit replied.
“Well, then I’ll come with you,” Alligator said. However, as they were go
ing along, Rabbit grabbed a club and hit Alligator over the head, but didn’t kill
him. Alligator ran back home.
Rabbit returned to the chief and said that he had not had any luck. The
chief told Rabbit that if he didn’t eat, then neither would Rabbit. So Rabbit
headed back toward Alligator’s home. On the way, he killed a fawn, skinned it
and covered himself in the fawn’s hide. Again he told Alligator that the chief
had summoned him, but this time Alligator was wary. “I don’t want to go,”
Alligator said. “They’ll hit me on the head again.”
“Who did that?” Rabbit asked.
“It was Rabbit,” said Alligator, thinking he was talking to Fawn.
“Well, I won’t do that. You can trust me,” Rabbit told him.
So Alligator agreed to go along. On the way, Rabbit asked Alligator. “So
where is the spot that if someone were to hit it you would die?” Alligator ex
plained about the tender place on his back. It wasn’t long before Rabbit found a
club and hit Alligator on the back and killed him. Then he took off the fawn
hide and carried the alligator to the chief.
To his surprise, the chief was not happy. “Those things aren’t fit to eat!” he
said. Then the chief ordered Rabbit to find his food in old women’s gardens
where he’d have to watch out for their dogs. Since that time rabbits have been
fond of garden vegetables, and dogs are forever chasing them.
The Ute tale “Little Rabbit Fights the Sun” begins when Ta-vwots, Little
Rabbit, was sleeping with his back to the sun and got burned. His children
woke him up. “Father, your back is covered with holes!” they told him. Little
Rabbit knew that Sun had burned him and decided to go out and fight him.
While traveling, Little Rabbit came to a wonderful valley with a cornfield.
The corn was ripe and ready to roast. But Little Rabbit had never seen corn be
fore, so he examined it closely. Then he realized it was corn and set about roast
ing some ears. After he had his fill of roasted corn, Little Rabbit wondered if the
field belonged to anyone, so he decided to hide. When the owner came, he real
ized right away who the culprit was and declared to his warriors that he wanted
the thief dead.
They searched all over for Little Rabbit and finally found the hole he was
hiding in. They shot arrows into the hole, but Little Rabbit just blew them back

152



out. Then they started digging near the hole, but while they were occupied do
ing that, Little Rabbit escaped out a different hole. The warriors had dug a deep
hole and Little Rabbit tossed a magic ball onto the rim of earth above them. It
caused the ground to collapse and buried them all.
Little Rabbit traveled on and came to a place where two men were shaping
arrowheads out of hot stones. He watched them from behind a tree for a while
before he made his presence known. “Let me help you,” he said. “These stones
will not harm me.”
The men thought he was crazy and asked him, “Are you a ghost?”
“No, I’m not a ghost,” Little Rabbit replied, “but I am powerful enough not
to be harmed by the hot stones.” The men thought he would surely be burned,
but Little Rabbit just blew on the stones and cooled them with his magic
breath. Then he said, “All right, now it is your turn.” He made the men lie
down on the hot stones, and they were immediately destroyed. Little Rabbit
thought this was great practice for fighting with Sun.
The next day Little Rabbit saw some women picking berries. He instructed
them to blow the berry bush thorns into his eyes. The women did as they were
told and Little Rabbit just blew the thorns away. “Are you a ghost?” they cried.
“No, I’m not a ghost,” said Little Rabbit. “I’m just a regular person like
you. Let me blow the thorns into your eyes. They won’t hurt you.” So, the
women agreed, but unlike Little Rabbit, they were blinded by the thorns. He
thought this was also good practice for fighting with Sun.
Later on he saw some other women standing on a cliff. They recognized
him and decided to kill him by throwing rocks off the cliff as he passed by. But
Little Rabbit realized what they were up to and stopped while still out of range.
He cooked a mixture of dried meat and chokecherries and began eating. The
women asked, “What are you eating?”
Little Rabbit told them and said he’d share it with them. “Just come to the
edge of the cliff and I’ll toss some up to you,” he said. The women moved to the
edge, but Little Rabbit tossed the food just short of where they were. He did this
several times, and finally the women leaned far over the cliff to try to reach the
food he was tossing to them. They leaned so far that they fell to their deaths.
Little Rabbit then continued on his way.
Later he happened upon another group of women weaving baskets. They
saw him coming and decided to kill him. But Little Rabbit knew what they had
planned. He suggested that they weave a closed basket with him in it. The
women thought this would fit into their plan. However, Little Rabbit broke free
of the basket. “You must be a ghost!” they exclaimed.
“No, I’m not a ghost,” Little Rabbit said, then asked the women, “Why
don’t you try getting into the baskets?” The women did just that, but they got
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 153



stuck in the pitch they had used to make the baskets waterproof. Little Rabbit
kicked the baskets around and then finally threw his magic ball at them and
killed them all. “I’m getting good at this!” he declared.
Next Little Rabbit met Great Bear, who told him that he was going to hide
from Little Rabbit, since he was going around killing everyone. Little Rabbit
said, “Me, too. Let’s hide together.” So they dug a huge hole and hid inside. But
Little Rabbit escaped out a small hole in the back. When Great Bear discovered
this, he tried to go out the same exit but got stuck. Little Rabbit tossed his
magic ball at him and killed him on the spot. “Now I am ready to fight Sun,”
said Little Rabbit as he went on his way.
Then he met Tarantula, who had already heard about Little Rabbit’s ex
ploits. Tarantula had a magic stick that would kill other people, but not him
self. He said to Little Rabbit, “Here, beat me with this stick.” But Little Rabbit
knew what he was up to and quickly exchanged Tarantula’s stick for his magic
ball and killed Tarantula.
Little Rabbit finally arrived at the eastern edge of the world. He was careful
not to step over the edge while he waited for Sun to make his appearance. When
Sun began to rise, Little Rabbit hit him in the face and it shattered into tiny
flames all over the world. The flames burned all of Little Rabbit except for his
head, which rolled around in the fire. The heat of the flames caused his eyes to
explode, and this caused a flood of tears that covered the earth and extinguished
the flames. Eventually Sun and Little Rabbit recreated themselves, and Little
Rabbit learned that killing is not the answer.

RACCOON
The wily raccoon appears often in Native American myths and displays many
characteristics of a trickster. In a Missisauga tale, Raccoon is very fond of craw
fish. He lies on a lakeshore and lets his tail and hindquarters into the water and
pretends to be dead. Gradually many crawfish gather around him, pinching him.
He suddenly jumps up and catches them, and has a great feast. In a story of the
Abenaki, Raccoon is a deceitful prankster who employs his cunning to obtain

154



food from other beings. In a Kathlamet story, Raccoon’s grandmother hits him
in the face with a fire poker after she discovers he has eaten all of her stored
acorns, thus explaining the origin of the markings on his masked face. In stories
of the Iroquois, Raccoon often outwits other animals. Some stories of the
Achomawi tell of lightning taking the form of a raccoon.
Raccoon and fellow trickster Coyote appear together in a story of the
Shasta.
After going to a dance, Raccoon and Coyote were returning to their homes.
On the way, a squirrel ran across the road and into a hole. Coyote told Raccoon
to scare him out the other side. Raccoon did so by putting his hand into the
other opening of the hole. Coyote put his hand in at the other opening, seized
Raccoon’s arm, and pulled. Thinking it was the squirrel, Coyote ignored
Raccoon’s protests. He eventually pulled off Raccoon’s arm, and he died.
Coyote brought Raccoon’s body home and distributed the meat among his
children. The youngest boy, angry because he was not given an equal share,
went to Raccoon’s five children and told them Coyote had killed their father.
The next day, while Coyote was gone, Raccoon’s children killed the other chil
dren of Coyote. Then they returned to their own house, prepared themselves,
and ran away with Coyote’s remaining child into the sky.
Coyote returned home to find his children dead. He ran to Raccoon’s house
but found no one. He hunted Raccoon everywhere, asking questions. The dust
began to rise in eddies, and looking up, he saw the children of Raccoon and his
own son rising. He ran after them, calling and weeping, but they would not lis
ten, and he could not catch them.
Raccoon’s children remained in the sky as stars. They are the Pleiades.
Coyote’s surviving child is the smallest, the red star. The Pleiades are their
most brilliant and continually visible in the winter, when raccoons are less ac
tive and spend much time in their holes. During the summer, when the rac
coons are out and about, the Pleiades are not seen.

RAINBOW(S)
Rainbows appear widely in Native American stories and prophecies. The
Cherokee believe a rainbow forms the hem of the Sun’s coat. In a story of the
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 155



Yana, Rainbow’s son overcomes Moon in a pole-bending contest and hurls him
to the sky. Kiaklo, a Zuni kachina and the keeper of Zuni history, bears the im
print of a rainbow on his cheek. A rainbow is a toy or charm used by the
Creator to stop a rainstorm, according to the Mohave of Arizona. Children of
northern California tribes are warned that their fingers will become crooked
and fall off if they count a rainbow’s colors. These tribes also believe great heal
ing powers are bestowed upon a medicine person who walks through a rainbow.
Rainbows may carry dreams across vast canyons and are sometimes made from
the souls of wildflowers.
Rainbows are occasionally portents of evil, or an evil force. They can pre
vent rain from falling, either by stretching across the sky and catching it, or by
exuding a stench that causes the clouds to retreat.
More often, rainbows are regarded as bridges or ladders from one world to
another, from this world to the next. In the mythology of the Navajo ritual
healing process known as Waterway, the character Sunlight Boy journeys to the
sky on crossed rainbows. In the mythology associated with the Navajo
Nightway ceremony, the hero is transported back to his home on a rainbow.
Among the Keresan, a rainbow forms the gateway through which people en
tered Shipap, the home of the dead and the supernatural.
Navajo sandpaintings, which have been used in religious rituals for cen
turies, often feature rainbows. They frequently function as protectors against
evil influences by encircling the painting, with an opening on the east side,
where two guardian figures are often found, such as Sun and Moon. Sometimes
rainbows represent the Rainbow God, with the body circling northeast to a head
and feet at the southeast. Rainbows that appear in the shape of short, straight
rectangles represent symbols of protection in these pictures. References and further reading:

RAVEN
Arctic, Northwest Coast, Subarctic
Among the tribes of the Northwest Coast, many mythological stories were told
only at certain times and by certain people. Some myths were historical and
Handbook of Native American Mythology
156



could only be related or performed by the people who owned them. These indi
viduals belonged to the clans that descended from a character in the story.
Other tales were accessible to all. Many of the myths of the Raven cycle were of
the second type. These were most numerous in the northern part of the region
among the Haida, Tlingit, and Tsimshian groups and in the western Subarctic.
They were less prominent to the south and east. Raven myths were also
widespread on the other side of the Pacific Ocean among the people living in
the far northeastern corner of Asia, such as the Koriak and the Chuckchi.
Raven was central to the mythology of the Northwest Coast, where he was
depicted as a significant force in shaping the world as we know it. He was more
of a changer than an original creator, and this was best seen in the way he re
constructed the earth and populated it after a great deluge. One myth tells that
when all the people had been destroyed, Raven created new ones from leaves.
This explains why people die, especially in autumn when the leaves fall off the
trees. A different tale relates that Raven was walking on the beach when he
heard high-pitched noises coming from a shell. He opened the shell and freed
the people. A variation of this tale states that Raven found a shell on the beach
and, being a lusty fellow, had relations with it. Nine months later when he
walked back that way, he heard little voices coming from inside the shell.
When he opened it, he found that he had fathered the first people.

In the tale often entitled “Raven Steals the Light,” Raven’s greed for light
ended up being a benefit to all.
Long ago, while everything was still dark, there was a great chief who kept
light hidden away in three boxes. Raven, who had been busy forming the land
and seas, decided that he needed light to proceed with his work. So Raven set
off on his quest to steal the light, but he could not figure out how to get inside
the chief’s house undetected.
One day when the chief’s daughter left the house to fetch water, Raven de
vised a plan. He changed himself into a small leaf and floated into the girl’s
drinking water. The girl was very thirsty. She drank the water quickly but
didn’t realize she had swallowed the leaf. Inside her body Raven transformed
himself once more and caused her to become pregnant. Raven grew as all babies
do and eventually the girl gave birth to a son. No one suspected that this was
not an ordinary little boy.
The grandfather was delighted with his new grandson and began to spoil
him from the very first day. As the baby grew he became more and more de
manding. His mother and grandfather tried to keep him entertained and happy
by giving him anything he wanted. One day Raven, disguised as the baby, put
his arms out as if trying to reach the boxes that stored the light. The adults
tried to distract him by giving him other toys to play with, but Raven just
threw those things across the room.
Raven cried and cried until his grandfather finally took down the first box.
The old chief told the little boy that he could play with the box, but he was not al
lowed to open it. Raven took the box and played quietly. When no one was look
ing, he opened the lid and out flew the stars. They ascended high in the sky and are
there to this day. The old man scolded his grandson for disobeying, but later when
Raven demanded the second box, he took the box down and gave it to the boy.
Again, Raven played quietly with the second box and waited for the right
opportunity. When it came, he opened the lid and out flew the moon. Now the
grandfather was more than a bit upset. But sometime later, when Raven began
crying and demanding to be allowed to play with the third box, his grandfather
eventually relented and handed the box to the little boy on the condition that
he would never open it.
Raven quickly changed back to his raven form, and with the box in his
beak, flew out the smoke hole and into the starlit sky. When he was far away
from the chief’s house, he opened the lid of the third box and immediately a
blazing ball of light appeared in the once dark sky. The light was much too
bright for many of the people. They ran away, some to live in the forests on the
mountainsides, some to live in caves, and some to live under the water. That is
how the different animals came to be.
Handbook of Native American Mythology

At times Raven was a transformer who could change himself or others into
a variety of animate beings or inanimate objects. Once Raven came to a rasp
berry bush. When he shook the bush, it turned into a man who became his
slave. The man traveled with Raven and was supposed to be his spokesperson
when they encountered other people. However, the man didn’t always relay
Raven’s messages correctly and Raven would end up being the one who was
tricked. On another occasion, Raven held a great feast and invited all of the ani
mals. While they were dining on fish, Raven let out a shout and all of his guests
were changed into stones.
Raven was wily, deceitful, lusty, impulsive, curious, mischievous—an all
around complex individual. It was these “human” attributes that endeared him
to the audiences who listened to his exploits.
A story from the Arctic region illustrates Raven’s impatient nature.
In the beginning, Loon and Raven were both completely white. One day
they decided to tattoo each other. First Raven worked on Loon. When he fin
ished, the colors and designs on Loon looked very attractive. Then it was Loon’s
turn to tattoo Raven. However, Raven would not sit still. He kept complaining
that the procedure hurt, and he would jump and pull away. Loon scolded him
and told him to calm down and sit quietly. But Raven continued to squirm.
Finally, Loon threatened, “If you don’t sit still so I can finish, I’m going to ex
plode.” It wasn’t long before Raven started fidgeting again and Loon grabbed the
oil lamp and hurled the contents at him. As Loon was fleeing the house, Raven
picked up the oil lamp and threw it at Loon striking him in the legs. That is
why loons have great difficulty walking on land and why ravens are all black.
The trickster dimension of Raven’s personality can be compared to trick
sters found in other parts of the world. Coyote was an important trickster char
acter in the mythologies of western North America. Other tricksters included
Spider, or Iktomi, on the Plains, Hare (also known as Manabozho, Glooskap,
and other names) in the Northeast region of America, and Anansi in Africa.
Sometimes Raven’s tricks backfired, as in this tale from the Tlingit:
Raven was traveling and happened on a village where the fishermen were
catching a lot of halibut. The people invited Raven to stay with them and
proved to be very hospitable and generous hosts. It wasn’t long, however, until
Raven thought up some mischief to do. When the fishermen went out the next
day, Raven dove in and swam underwater to where the fishing lines were dan
gling. At first he just nibbled on the bait, but his greediness got the best of him
and he took a big bite. When the fisherman felt the tug on the line, he started
hauling in his catch. Raven fought against the line and finally grabbed on to the
bottom of the boat. The other fishermen also pulled on the line and at last
Raven’s nose broke off.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 159



Then Raven swam to shore and transformed himself into an old man. He
glued a piece of bark on his face in place of a nose and walked back to the village.
The people at the first house invited him in and fed him well. During dinner, the
man of the house told how they had caught a nose that day. Raven asked what
had become of the nose. So the man told him it was at the chief’s house. When
Raven arrived there, the chief served him a big meal and shared the story of how
the fishermen had caught a nose. Raven asked to see it and then, after examining
it closely, declared that it was a bad sign. “If you keep this nose, many people
will come to fight you.” That frightened the people so much that they pleaded
with Raven to take the nose away with him. Thus Raven’s beak was restored.

ROADRUNNER
Tohono O’Odham, Southwest
According to Cuevas, the Apache today tell a story of the swift roadrunner that
teaches a lesson: if one seeks greatness in size, then greatness tends to go un
noticed. The following story of the Tohono O’Odham teaches that same lesson.
One day when the world was new, the people returned from the hunt to
find that their fire had died down into gray ashes. They asked Roadrunner to go
quickly to the Lightning God, keeper of the fire, and ask him for one of his fire
sticks. Roadrunner agreed, and with his strong legs, ran up the mountain to his
destination.
The Lightning God asked him what brought him there, and Roadrunner
told him. But the Lightning God angrily refused to give Roadrunner a fire stick.
Handbook of Native American Mythology

Realizing it was useless to ask a second time, Roadrunner grabbed a stick from
the blazing fire, placed it across his back, curled his tail feathers over it, and
scurried away. Lightning God started shooting at Roadrunner with flaming ar
rows. Roadrunner saw an arroyo and scampered into it to escape them. But the
beautiful feathers on his head were burnt off, leaving him with just a small of
tuft. His eyes were red from the smoke, and his back was singed a brownish
color.
But Roadrunner brought the fire stick back to the Indians. When the
women saw what was left of his beautiful, long plumage and noted his tired, red
eyes, they cried, “Shoik, shoik, shoik.” Roadrunner wailed, “Poi, poi, poi.”
Roadrunner has lived in the desert ever since. When he finds a fat lizard to
eat, he gaily chants “Thra, Thra, Thra!” The people remember what he did for
them and are grateful whenever they hear this melodic sound. References and further reading:

SALMON
Chinook, Heiltsuk (Bella Bella), Pacific Northwest Coast; Skitswish (Coeur d’Alene),
Plateau
Salmon was, and is, an important part of the culture and economy in the coastal
and plateau regions of the Northwest. Various groups throughout the area, and
especially those living near the great rivers, have mythological tales relating to
the origin of salmon as well as tales that reflect the people’s beliefs and taboos
regarding salmon.
A Heiltsuk (Bella Bella) myth story tells about a chief’s son who was out
shooting with his bow and arrows. Three of his arrows struck a salmon bone ly
ing on the beach. As he gathered up his arrows, he sighed to the bones, “If only
you were a real salmon, you could guide me to the Salmon chief’s home.”
Suddenly a bone spoke and told the young man to toss all of the bones into the
sea. When he obeyed, the bones became a live salmon. The salmon instructed
the young man to climb on his back, and swam away.
The two eventually reached the entrance to the Salmon chief’s country, but
the hole was guarded by an eagle that would not allow them through. The
salmon made several passes trying to get through the hole until finally, the ea
gle was distracted, and the salmon with the young man on his back was able to
get through. Once in that country, the boy was able to see what the Salmon
People and their villages were like.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 161



When they approached the village of the Salmon chief, the guide told the
young man to hide near where Salmon chief’s daughters were bathing. Later the
boy grabbed one of the girls and carried her off. He told her that he wanted to
marry her, and in time the girl delivered twins. Her father, the chief, was angry
and tried to find out who had fathered the babies. At first, Wren spoke up, but
the girl denied it was him. Then Thrush claimed to be the father, but again the
girl denied it. Finally the young man came in, the chief asked him if he was the
father, and he said yes. The girl confirmed his statement, and her father eventu
ally allowed the young people to marry.
After a number of years, the young man was very hungry for salmon. The
chief noticed that something was wrong and asked his daughter. “My husband
wants to eat salmon,” she replied. So the chief instructed the young man to
take one of the children who were playing near the river and toss him into the
water. When the young man did this, the child turned into a salmon that he
took home and cooked for his meal. The young man and his wife were very
careful to catch all of the bones and eyes on a mat and then they threw the re
mains of the salmon back into the water. The bones and eyes immediately
turned back into the boy who had been tossed into the river.
Sometime later the young man was very homesick, so the Salmon chief
promised to send him home in four days. During that time four large boxes
were prepared and the chief sent the young man, his wife, and their children
back to his family. When he arrived at his father’s village, it seemed to the
young man as if he had been away only four days, but actually he had been

away four years. They were met on the path by his younger brother, who ran to
the village to tell the news of the lost brother’s return. The father had thought
his older son was dead. So when the younger boy told him about seeing his
brother, the father did not believe it. Finally the old chief was persuaded to see
for himself.
The people of the village rejoiced to see the young man again and held a
dance in his honor. He sent people to the canoe to bring the boxes sent by the
Salmon chief, but the boxes were too heavy. Finally the salmon wife carried
them to the village and told her father-in-law to have a large house built and to
have the people gather. When the boxes were opened they were found to con
tain never-ending supplies of salmon, berries, meat, and tallow.
Farther to the east, James A. Teit recorded a Skitswish (Coeur d’Alene) tale
relating how Coyote brought the salmon.
Coyote heard about four women living on the Columbia River who ate any
one who ventured into their land. A dam near their house prevented salmon
from ascending any farther upstream. So Coyote decided to travel there and de
stroy their dam.
Coyote floated downstream disguised as a board. When he neared the
dam, he made himself look like a baby. The four women were fishing near
their dam when they saw the baby in the water. Since they didn’t have any
children or any husbands, the women decided to raise the baby as their own.
Coyote lived with them for a time and grew quickly. One day he asked to go
to the river to get a drink. While he was there, he began pulling out a small
part of the dam.
Each day when he went to the river to drink, he would remove another
piece of the dam. On the fourth day, the women became suspicious when
Coyote was away longer than usual. When they went down to the river to see
what had become of him, Coyote was just pulling down the last of the dam.
They tried to attack him, but Coyote jumped onto the far bank as the river
rushed through the opening.
Coyote led many salmon past the broken dam and upstream to areas where
the people had never seen salmon before. See also Coyote References and further reading:

SALT WOMAN
Zuni, Southwest
The Salt Woman or Salt Mother is a very important Zuni deity who lives at the
sacred Zuni Salt Lake, located in present-day New Mexico. Since time im
memorial, the Zuni, Acoma, Laguna, Hopi, Navajo, Apache, and other
Southwestern tribes have followed pilgrimage trails to the lake to collect salt
for ceremonial and domestic purposes. This story recounts how the ancestors
of the Zuni people took this natural resource for granted and nearly lost an im
portant part of their culture. It also establishes the manner in which the Zuni
conduct the pilgrimage and gather the salt.
The priest at Itiwana proclaimed that all the people should go to nearby
Black Rock Lake, where the Salt Woman lives, for salt. They liked to go, for
they always had a good time. The men took fawn-skin bags to fill with the
salt, and the girls dressed up in their finery and brought the food. The girls
went two-by-two, as did the boys. Everyone looked for their sweethearts; two
boys would invite two girls to eat with them, and the girls would spread out
the food.
Salt Woman was waiting for them. She sat and watched them, since this
was the first time the boys and girls had come. All were careful and behaved
well. At last they started home, the men carrying the fawn-skin bags filled
with salt.
They used the salt freely, since it was easy to get it nearby. When the
people’s supply was gone, the priest made another proclamation, and another
trip was made to the salt lake. Later, a third proclamation was made. But this
time the people were careless and ill-behaved, and they left the Salt Woman no
offerings. When they brought the salt home they wasted it, so they could make
another trip soon and enjoy themselves again. The Salt Woman was sad and of
fended that they wasted her flesh.
Turquoise Man lived near the salt lake. The priest proclaimed that the
men should go there to gather turquoise. They found much pretty turquoise
and wasted it, treating it as if it were a common thing. Turquoise Man noticed
the waste, just as Salt Woman did. Salt Woman and Turquoise Man decided to
leave and go far away, so that the people would find it harder to get their flesh
and value them more.
That same day at Itiwana, yet another proclamation was made to go and
get salt. The people went to the salt lake, but saw very little salt. Salt Woman
did not sit and watch them as she had before, but stayed inside her house. The
people worked hard to get a few handfuls of salt and got sores on their hands
from digging. They said, “We shall come again. There will be more next time.”
They returned home with their bags only half filled.
Handbook of Native American Mythology
164



Salt Woman and Turquoise man departed as planned, and eventually came
to the home of the Tenatsali Youths. They went in and were asked, “What have
you come to ask of us?”
“We were living at Black Rock and the people did not value our flesh. We
are going farther away, then the people will have a hard time to get us,” said
Salt Woman and Turquoise Man. The Tenatsali said, “What do you want before
you go?”
“Will you give me some meal and some tenatsali sticks? I will take it
where I am going and leave it there,” said Salt Woman. So they went into the
other room and brought out a bunch of tenatsali. Salt Mother said, “I shall take
this to my house, and it will be valuable. She thanked them and left.
Salt Woman and Turquoise man traveled until they came to Salt Lake.
There Salt Woman turned to Turquoise Man and said, “This is where I wanted
to be. I shall stop here. Go to the east and make your home there.” So
Turquoise Man went east and eventually settled in the white man’s country,
and that is why they had better turquoise than the Indians could get.
After a few days, the people of Itiwana had no salt. Again the priest made a
proclamation for them to get salt. When they came in sight of where the lake
had been, they found it had disappeared and only a damp place remained. They
were sad and did not have a good time. They were worried about how they
would obtain more salt. They went home to their village empty-handed. The
priests of the council and the village priest met to talk. “Why did Salt Woman
do this?” they asked themselves.
“We were careless with her flesh,” they lamented. “The people played
nearby when they went after it, and we wasted it as if it were common. She did
not like this and has gone away.” They chose their best runners to go look for
her, and decided that two of the priests should also go to carry a bundle of
prayer sticks.
So they made feathers and prayer sticks. The runners carried the food, and
the priests carried the prayer sticks, and they journeyed to the east to Black
Rock Lake. There they followed Salt Woman’s tracks, all the way to Tenatsali
Place. Her trail was barren and salty, and she had created landmarks on her jour
ney to show which way she was going, for even though she was angry for being
disrespected, she also felt sorry for the people. Here the priests and runners
came to the home of the Tenatsali Youths, who instructed the priests in the
uses of tenatsali in divining.
The priests and runners went on toward Salt Lake, south and then east.
Finally, they saw a great lake before them but were afraid to approach because they
had been unkind to Salt Woman. When they got close, the priests went first and
the runners hung back. The priests took off their moccasins and waded into the
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 165



lake. As punishment for the misuse of salt, the salt in the lake cut their feet. They
were close to Salt Woman’s house, but they could not bear the pain. They ran out
of the lake and sat down where they had started. Again they waded into the lake,
and again the salt cut their feet. They had almost reached her house, but they ran
back because the pain was too much. They came just to the door. Their feet were
bleeding. The priests waded into the lake a third time, but the salt cut them so
badly they had to run back. So they rubbed their feet with clay. They waded out
the fourth time and went into her house. She was glad to see them and asked,
“What is it that you have come to ask? Why have you come this long way?”
“My dear daughter, we are looking for you,” said the priests. “We have had
a hard time finding you.”
“Yes,” she said, “it was too easy for you to get my flesh. You were careless and
spat and eased yourself on me. I do not want these boys and girls to play and step
on me. You know better. Did you think young people knew better than you? After
this I want the older people to come for my flesh. I want the men to come for my
flesh and bring prayer sticks.” She instructed the priests to make prayer sticks
with duck feathers to show the maker had been initiated into the kachina society.
Then she told them, “You shall take a little salt with you. When you near
Zuni, call out for your fathers’ sisters to come wash your bodies. They shall
give you a present, and you shall give them a little salt in return. If other men
wish to come, they may come also for my flesh. Their fathers’ sisters shall wash
them the first time, but when they come a second time, their aunts shall not
wash them. I shall be valuable now that I am far away.”
“All right,” the priests replied. “We shall do as you say.”
They came out with their fawnskin bags full of salt. Just before they left,
Salt Woman said, “Do not go around by the way you came. You can go straight
to Zuni. There is a road there.”
They set out, but they could not find the road. Like the cutting of their feet
with the salt, this was punishment for the people’s carelessness at Black Rock
Salt Lake. It took them four days to make their journey. They ran out of food
and killed butterflies to eat. On the fourth day they climbed a mountain and
saw Itiwana. To signal their impending arrival, they burned a pile of wood, but
it frightened the people. They feared the Navajo were coming.
About noon the priests and runners came in past Sand Hill and called, “We
are coming in. When we arrive home our fathers’ sisters shall come to wash our
bodies before we have anything to eat. They shall bring us a present.”
The aunts ran to their nephews’ houses to be ready. The men came in, and
everyone was watching. Their moccasins were worn out and their hands and
faces were covered with clay from Salt Lake. They entered their houses, spread
the buckskins, and poured out the salt. They put a perfect ear of corn with it,

covered it with a blanket, put beads with it, and scattered prayer meal. They
prayed, “Salt Mother, we are glad that you have come to this house, we are glad
of your flesh. Increase and come many times again.”
Their fathers’ sisters broke up soap-weed root and made suds to wash the men’s
hair. They brought in bowls of grain to give to their nephews and they washed their
entire bodies. The head aunts filled up the bowls with salt and all of the fathers’ sis
ters took them home. That is why the salt is still brought in in this fashion. See also Culture Hero(es)

SAPIYA
Creek, Southeast; Seminole, Oklahoma and Southeast
Magic stones of red, blue, or yellow that are greatly respected and believed to
bring their owners great power in matters related to love, war, and the hunt.
This might include success in pursuit of a love interest or game, protection
from enemies, or strength in battle. According to the lore, sapiya are capable of
breeding and moving around, at times hopping like fleas. They are controlled
with special procedures and songs, and must be attended carefully. If not fed
with squirrel blood and given dew to drink, the sapiya will give their owner
sores. Some choose not to keep any sapiya because of their potential to turn on
their owners. It is said that sapiya sing during the Soup Dance, or Horned Owl
Dance, the final event of the Seminole’s ceremonial year.
The sapiya are kept in a special container with vermilion paint. When the
owner is ready to use them, he or she goes into the woods alone, away from oth
ers, and builds a small earthen mound. The container is placed intact on top of
this mound, and the owner sings the proper songs. Then some of the paint is ap
plied to the outer corner of each eye using a grass stem, and the owner immedi
ately sparkles, causing others to want to be with him or her. References and further reading:

SEASONS, ORIGIN OF
Many Native American cultures have stories that explain the origin of the sea
sons. In the Tsimshian story of the Four Great Winds, various conflicts and al
liances between the North, South, East, and West Winds and their children
eventually result in the four of them agreeing that each would have the earth
for three months. In a Seneca story, a hunter challenges Hotho, or Winter, to a
contest with a claim that Hotho cannot make him freeze no matter how hard
he tries. The outcome is that the hunter is successful, and it begins to grow
warm and thaw, demonstrating that Winter can be conquered.
The following is a Northern Paiute tale:
Coyote summoned a large crowd to decide how many months there
should be in each season. He proposed there be ten spring months, ten sum
mer months, ten autumn months, and ten winter months. He said, “I am
strong. I shall be able to get along in the winter.” The others present did not
say anything in reply, since they did not like Coyote’s speech or his plan.
Hearing no protests, Coyote decided they should smoke to bind what he
thought was an agreement. His pipe and tobacco were at his home, so he left
to get them.
As soon as we had gone outside, the others said, “Let us hurry and decide
about the moons before he returns.”
One bird that lived on the mountains rose and said, “There shall be three
spring months, three summer months, three autumn months, and three winter
months.” The bird and the others felt that Coyote wanted the seasons to be
too long.
When Coyote returned, no one was there. He called out, “Where is every
body? Come, we’ll speak about it.”
In response, he heard, “We have talked about it already and we are all
through.” Coyote stood for a moment in surprise, and finally went back home
in defeat.
In a Zuni story, Coyote Steals the Sun and Moon, the origin of winter is ex
plained:
Coyote was a bad hunter who never managed to catch anything. After
watching Eagle catch rabbit after rabbit, he suggested they hunt together. “Two
can catch more than one,” he told Eagle. Eagle accepted Coyote’s suggestion
without reservation. But Eagle continued to catch many rabbits, and Coyote
only caught some bugs.
Handbook of Native American Mythology
168



The world was still dark at this time, because the sun and moon had not
yet been placed in the sky. Coyote lamented that the lack of light was the rea
son he could catch nothing. He asked Eagle if he knew where they could find
some light so he could see well. Eagle agreed there should be some light. He
suggested they go west, since he thought there might be some there.
After traveling for a while, they came upon a pueblo where kachinas hap
pened to be dancing. They invited Eagle and Coyote to sit and eat while they
watched the sacred dances. Eagle told Coyote he thought the powerful Kachinas
had light. Coyote noticed two boxes, one large, one small, and pointed them
out. The people opened them whenever they wanted light. The larger box,
which gave off more light, held the sun. The smaller box, which gave off less
light, held the moon. Coyote nudged Eagle and urged him to steal the big box.
Eagle suggested they borrow it, but Coyote told him the people would never
loan it to them. Eagle agreed and indicated that he was willing to steal the box.
Finally the Kachinas went home to sleep, and Eagle flew off with the large
box. Coyote ran along, panting and trying to keep up. He yelled up to Eagle and
begged him to let him carry the box a little way. Eagle refused, telling Coyote
that he never did anything right. But Coyote ran along and kept trying to con
vince Eagle to let him carry the box. Eagle continued to refuse. Finally Eagle
could stand no more pestering and told Coyote that he could carry the box, but
he had to promise not to open it.
“Oh, yes, I promise!” said Coyote. They continued as before, with Eagle fly
ing and Coyote running. Soon Eagle was far ahead, and Coyote was hidden be
hind a hill where Eagle could not see him. He decided to peek in the box, think
ing that there must be something extra that Eagle wanted to keep for himself.
Coyote opened the lid and found that Eagle had put the moon in the large box
with the sun. The moon escaped and flew high into the sky. Instantly, the plants
shriveled and turned brown, and the leaves fell off the trees. It was now winter.
Coyote ran after the moon and tried to put it back in the box as it bounced away.
Meanwhile, the sun flew out of the box and rose into the sky. It gradually floated
far away, causing the peaches, squashes, and melons to shrivel in the cold.
Eagle turned back to see why Coyote lagged behind. “You fool,” said Eagle.
“Look what you’ve done!” It began to snow, and Coyote shivered. “It’s your
fault the cold has come into the world,” said Eagle.
Indeed, if it weren’t for Coyote’s curiosity and mischief-making, winter
would not exist, and it would be summer all the time.

SEDNA
Central Inuit/Baffin Island, Arctic
Also called Sea Woman and Nerrivik, Arnarkusuagsak (or Arnakuagsak), Nuliajoq,
or Kannakapfaluk and other names by various Inuit groups. Versions of the follow
ing tale differ in details but tend to have similar beginnings and outcomes.
Sedna was a beautiful girl who spurned all of the young men who sought
her as their wife. Finally one spring, Sedna was swayed by the songs a hand
some young stranger sang about his beautiful home and his friends who would
provide all she wanted or needed. She agreed to marry the young man and to go
with him to his home far across the sea. However, when they reached his home,
she discovered that she had been deceived. Her husband was not a handsome
young man after all, but a fulmar (a sea bird) in disguise. His home was not
beautiful as he had described, but a drafty tent made of fish skins. Her bed was
made of hard walrus hide instead of the soft bearskins he had promised, and his
friends, the birds, brought her nothing but fish to eat.
Sedna realized her mistake and sang to her father, Anguta, pleading for him
to rescue her. A year later when the sea ice had melted again, the father arrived
for a visit. When Sedna told him about her dreadful life with her bird-husband,
her father became so angry he killed the fulmar. They quickly left in the father’s
kayak and paddled toward home. However, when the other fulmars returned and
found the body of their friend, they flew over the sea searching for the murderer.
The pursuing birds caused a huge storm to rise, and the boat was in danger
of sinking. Fearing for his life, Anguta threw his daughter over the side, but she
grabbed onto the edge of the boat. Desperate to save himself, her father chopped
off her fingers at the first joints. These fell into the sea and became the whales.
Sedna still clung to the boat. So her father cut off her fingers at the second
joints and these became the seals. The fulmars saw this and thought Sedna
would drown, so they flew away and the storm subsided. Anguta then let Sedna
back in the boat, but she deeply hated her father for what he had done. Later,
when they had arrived on the shore and her father had gone to sleep, Sedna or
dered her dogs to gnaw off Anguta’s hands and feet. He awoke and cursed his
daughter and her dogs. Suddenly, the earth opened up and Sedna, her father, and
the dogs fell down into Adlivun, the realm beneath the earth and sea.
Because the sea mammals came from Sedna’s fingers, she controlled them.
Sedna allowed them to be hunted or hid them from humans, whom she hated be

cause of her father’s cruelty. She demanded respect and the observance of certain
cleanliness rituals and of taboos regarding hunting and the treatment of animals.
Offenses by humans enraged her, and it was then that she kept the animals from
being found by hunters or created storms to hamper hunting parties’ success.
In order to pacify Sedna’s rages, a shaman’s spirit would travel to the under
water realm of Adlivun. The journey itself was a dangerous one requiring the
spirit of the shaman to travel to the depths of the sea, get past Sedna’s guard
dog, and then appease her by smoothing out her tangled hair. He also promised
that the people were repentant of their erroneous ways and were committed to
obeying her rules for conducting their lives.
A Sedna Ceremony was held each autumn on Baffin Island. During this
time, an angakok (shaman) entered into a dream-trance during which his spirit
would travel to Sedna to ask her to send the animals and good weather for the
hunters. Some accounts say that the shaman battled with Sedna in order to win
seals for the hunt. There were also ceremonial confessions of wrongs commit
ted against the taboos Sedna enforces and a tug of war between teams com
prised of people who were born during the summer and during the winter. This
competition determined how much food would be available for the people.

SHAMAN
A shaman is a person who receives—or finds within himself—a supernatural
power. The term is not derived from any Native American language but has
found its way into the English from either a Sanskrit term for an ascetic or from a
Manchu term with a meaning similar to its current anthropological use. A
shaman can be either male or, less frequently, female. The scope of a particular
shaman’s status within his tribe or village is dependent upon the type of supernat
ural power the shaman possesses and the extent that he, or she, uses that power.
Among some groups, a shaman was known to receive a helping spirit who would
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 171



guide the shaman’s thoughts, words,
and actions for a specific purpose, such
as finding a cure for a disease or locat
ing game animals for the hunters.
When an Eskimo shaman received
a helping spirit, he would often make
an amulet or a mask to represent the
spirit. He might also give amulets to
patients to aid in their cure, or he
might make one for someone who has
asked for a blessing or good luck in
hunting or in another endeavor.
Novices trained for a period of time
and learned the shamans’ secret lan
guage, various songs, techniques such
as séances, and about the special rela
tionship between himself and his
helping spirit. Séances were held to
help determine why the weather was
bad, why there was illness, or why the
hunting was poor. Shamans were re
sponsible for the good of the commu
nity. As part of their duties, they were
charged with finding out who had bro
ken a taboo (often thought to be the
cause of some illness or misfortune
such as an accident or scarce game)
and to elicit a confession from the
guilty party. Shamans also were the in
termediaries between the deities or
spirits and the people. In the Sedna
ceremony, a Shaman (or his helping spirit) traveled to Sedna’s undersea realm
and convinced her to release the game so the people would not go hungry.
Among the people of the Arctic, shamans were both held in high regard for
their help in difficult times and feared because of their connection with the
spirit world.
Among the Ojibwa and related groups of the upper Great Lakes region,
shamans handed down celestial legends to their apprentices. With this knowl
edge the shamans were able to predict seasonal changes and regulate various rit

uals and rites. Thor Conway’s essay in Earth & Sky: Visions of the Cosmos in
Native American Folklore describes the custom of familial transmission of
shamanistic knowledge. Ritual items, personal spirit helpers, and the like could
be passed on from father to son or from grandfather to grandson. Like the people
farther north, the people of the Great Lakes region regarded shamans with both
awe and distrust, because shamans were capable of misusing their powers to the
detriment of an individual or society as a whole.
In the Pacific Northwest, shamans were also feared because of the super
natural power they possessed but were regarded as a necessary part of society
because of their ability to mediate between mankind and the spirit world.
Shamans were also able to do battle with the kushtakas (Land Otters) to re
claim the spirit of someone in danger of drowning.
Shamans have also been called medicine men (or women), herbalists, and
doctors. Their diagnosing and healing powers were frequently sought.

SKELETON HOUSE
Hopi, Southwest
Many Native American stories refer to death, the dead, and the place where the
dead live, such as this one:
In Shongopavi, long ago, a very curious young man would often sit at the
edge of the village and stare at the graveyards, wondering what happened to the
dead. He was interested in knowing if they really were not dead, if they perhaps
continued to live in another place. He asked his father, the village chief, but his
father could tell him very little.
The chief asked the other chiefs and his assistants and the village criers if
they knew anything that would help his son. The criers told him that Badger
Old Man possessed the medicine that would answer his son’s questions. They
summoned Badger Old Man and told him about the young man. Badger Old
Man consented to use his medicine to show him about the dead.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 173



Badger Old Man selected the appropriate medicine and took it to the village
chief. He instructed him to put a white kilt on his son and blacken his chin
with black shale. He told him to also tie a small eagle feather to his forehead,
since these were the very preparations used for the dead.
The next morning, they dressed the chief’s son this very way, and Badger
Old Man told him to lie down on a white robe he had spread on the floor. He
gave the young man some medicine to eat, and also placed it in his ears and on
his heart. He then wrapped him in a robe, and the young man appeared to die,
but he only fell asleep. This was the medicine that would help the man find out
what he wanted to know.
As he slept, the young man saw a path leading westward, which was the
road to the skeleton house. He followed it and came upon a woman sitting by
the roadside. She asked him what he had come for, and he told her he wished to
find out about her life in that place. The woman explained that she was forced
to wait there, because she had not listened and followed the straight road. After
a certain number of days had passed, she could proceed a little, and then go on,
but it would be a long time before she reached the skeleton house.
The young man continued to follow the path westward and finally arrived
at the rim of a steep bluff, where a buffalo chief was sitting. He asked the young
man why he had come, and the young man told him. The buffalo chief pointed
him in the direction of the house, but a great deal of smoke hid it from the
young man’s view. Then, the buffalo chief spread the young man’s kilt on the
ground, placed him on it, and lifted it up. He held it over the edge of the cliff,
and the young man was carried down slowly like a giant bird.
Upon arriving on the ground, he put on his kilt again and proceeded. He
came upon Skeleton Woman and asked what the column of smoke was that he
saw rising in the distance. Skeleton Woman explained that some people who
were wicked while they lived had been thrown there. She told him the bad
chiefs send people down the road, and then they are destroyed. She warned him
not to go there, to keep on the road and go straight toward the Skeleton House.
At last, he arrived at the Skeleton House, where he saw only a few children
playing. By the time he had gone into the village, all the skeletons living there
had heard about him, and gathered to stare. The young man explained that he
came from Shongopavi, and that he was the chief’s son. The skeletons pointed
toward the Bear clan and told him that they were the people he should see, be
cause they were his ancestors.
A skeleton took him to the house where his clan lived and showed him a
ladder that led up to the house. It was made of sunflower stems, which broke
when he stepped on the first rung. So, the skeletons brought some food to him.
The skeletons laughed at the man when he ate. They were lighter than air be

cause they never eat the food, only its odor. That is the reason why clouds into
which the dead are transformed are not heavy and can float in the air. The food
itself the skeletons threw out behind the house, and this is where they had
found his meal.
The young man explained to the skeletons why he had come, and that
Badger Old Man had given him the medicine that took him there. The skele
tons told the young man all about where they lived, how it lacked light, and
how they lived poorly. They told him to work for them after his return home, to
make ritual food and scarves they could tie around their heads to represent
dropping rain. In return, they promised to send rain and crops.
As he looked around, the young man noticed some of the skeletons walking
around with huge burdens of millstones and bundles of cactus on their backs.
He was told that some of them had to submit to such punishments for a time
before they could go live with the others. At another place in the Skeleton
House, he saw the chiefs who had been good when they lived, and they had
built a good road for others. They had set up their protective medicine bundles
there, and when people in the villages conduct their ceremonies, and smoke,
the smoke makes its way down to this world to the bundles or to the mothers,
and rises up from there in the form of clouds.
After the young man had seen everything, he started home for his village.
When he had just about arrived, his body, which was still lying where he had
fallen asleep, began to stir, and he awoke. He was uncovered and washed, and
the feather charm removed from him. He was given food, and he recounted his
experiences in detail to his mother and father and Badger Old Man. Then he
told them about the prayer offerings he was asked to make and explained what
the skeletons would do in return. They agreed it would be good to do as he had
been asked.
From that time on, the living and the dead worked to benefit each other. References and further reading:

SKINKUTS
Kootenai, Plateau
This tale explains why coyotes have long, thin legs.
Long ago Old-Man had only animal persons as companions. One day he was
walking and felt lonely. He wished he had some Person to talk with. Then he
saw Skinkuts, the Coyote, walking up the path and asked him to join in on his
travels. Skinkuts asked, “Where are you going?” to which Old-Man replied,
“Everywhere!”
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 175



So Skinkuts agreed. He didn’t mind traveling with his companion, but the
Old-Man talked on and on. Skinkuts listened, but after a while wasn’t paying
much attention to what Old-Man was saying. They walked a long time and
were deep in the forest when Old-Man cautioned the coyote about a nearby dan
ger. “When you hear crying up ahead coming from behind a pine tree, don’t pay
any attention,” Old-Man said, “just keep on walking. It is Bad-Person just try
ing to cause trouble.”
Now Skinkuts couldn’t help but listen for the sound that he was supposed
to ignore. They climbed higher up the mountain side, and Old-Man just kept on
talking and talking. He was talking about the pine trees and that made Skinkuts
think of the crying he had been warned about. Soon Old-Man sat down for a
rest. Skinkuts thought he heard a crying noise coming from the trees, but Old
Man did not appear to have heard anything.
It sounded like a baby, but Skinkuts could not tell what sort of baby Person
it was. Old-Man got up and continued walking up the trail. Skinkuts could not
believe that Old-Man had not heard the cries. “He must be hard-hearted,”
thought Skinkuts. The crying continued until finally, the coyote could no
longer stand it. “I’m not afraid of babies!” he assured himself.
When Skinkuts looked behind the tree, there wasn’t any Person there. He
walked around the tree, but didn’t see anyone. Just when he was ready give up
and follow Old-Man, he saw a Baby tied up in the tree. Coyote tried to calm the
Baby as he took it down. The Baby, however, kept on crying. Finally, the coyote
stuck his fingers into the Baby’s mouth to quiet it. The Baby quit crying and
started sucking on Skinkuts’s fingers. It sucked until Skinkuts’s hand, and then
his whole arm up to the shoulder, disappeared.
When Skinkuts remembered Old-Man’s warning, it was too late. Old-Man
had ignored the crying and kept walking. By now he was too far up the trail to
help. So Skinkuts gave a shout to the Echo-Person and eventually Old-Man
heard his call. Old-Man wasn’t happy about having to turn back, and it was
nighttime by the time he reached the place where Skinkuts and the Baby were.
He scolded Skinkuts for not heeding his warning and then clubbed the Bad
person to death.
It took a long time, but Old-Man was finally able to pull Skinkuts’s arm out
of the Bad-person’s mouth. It came out all long and skinny. Old-Man thought it
served Coyote right for not listening to him and said that from then on Coyote
and all of his children would have long, skinny arms and legs.

SPIDER
Teton (Lakota), Dakota (Sioux), Plains
Numerous myths have been recorded about Iktomi, an ancient trickster who is
also called “Spider.” As with other tricksters, Iktomi (also known as Iktome,
Unktomi, or Ictinicke) was bent on deceiving others for his own gain but often was
the one who suffered the consequences of his schemes. Tales about Iktomi fre
quently begin with introductions similar to Coyote stories: “He was traveling.”
Iktomi’s scalp was itching because he had lice. Then he saw two girls tan
ning a hide. So he went over and lay down next to where they were sitting.
With his head in one girl’s lap, he asked them to pick out the lice. As they
combed his long hair, Iktomi fell asleep. The girls stopped what they were doing
and filled his hair with burrs. When Iktomi awoke the girls were gone. When he
sat up his hair pulled away from his face from the weight of the burrs. He tried
in vain to remove the burrs and in the end had to cut off all of his hair. What a
funny sight he was and the whole village laughed at him.
Iktomi went on and soon came to a burial ground. “Oh, this dead person
smells very bad!” Iktomi exclaimed. The dead man’s ghost heard Iktomi’s com
plaint and grabbed him, demanding to know what he had just said. “I said, ‘It
smells wonderful here, like wildflowers and grass,’” Iktomi replied. That
seemed to appease the ghost and he released Iktomi. But Iktomi had had quite a
fright and quickly ran away.
Soon Iktomi saw an old man. He was a medicine man and he began to sing.
When he had finished singing four songs, a buffalo rolled off the cliff above and
fell dead at his feet. The old medicine man explained that his buffalo song was
very powerful and kept him well fed. Iktomi pleaded with the old man to teach
him the buffalo songs. At first the old man refused, because Iktomi appeared to
be a foolish fellow and didn’t merit such a wonderful song. But, Iktomi pleaded
with the old man, saying that he only needed the song to help out the hungry
people in his village. So, the old man taught him the song. Later, when he had
traveled far enough away from the old man, Iktomi decided to give the song a
try. It worked! A buffalo rolled down a cliff and fell dead at his feet. But Iktomi
wasn’t hungry; he had just wanted to see if the song worked for him, too. So, he
left the dead buffalo there and traveled on. Iktomi sang the powerful song two
more times. The result was just as it had been the first time. But when he sang
it a fourth time, he was nearly crushed to death when the buffalo landed on top
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 177



of him! If it weren’t for the coyotes
that came to eat the buffalo, that
would have been the end of Iktomi.
Another time Iktomi was trav
eling north. After a few days he be
came very hungry. Soon he found a
stream with numerous ducks float
ing in it. He devised a plan that
would get him the most ducks with
the least amount of effort. First he
packed his bag full of grass, and
then walked along the edge of the
stream. The curious little ducks
asked what was in his bag. “Oh, it’s
full of songs I’m taking to a big
dance. I’m the featured singer, so I
must be on my way,” Iktomi said.
The ducks begged him to stay and
let them hear some of the songs.
Appearing very annoyed, Iktomi fi
nally relented. He told the ducks
that the songs were very special and
they had to do exactly what the
songs told them to do. The first
song, he said, was the “shut-eye”
song. Everyone who heard it was re
quired to close their eyes tightly as
they danced in the grass. The ducks
obeyed and danced around with
their eyes shut. As Iktomi sang the
“shut-eye” song, he struck each duck as it came near him. However, one duck
was a bit suspicious and opened his eyes. He let out a loud quack and warned
the others what that trickster Iktomi was doing. The ones who survived quickly
flew away.
Iktomi found a spot to cook the ducks near a grove of trees. When there
was a thick bed of coals, he covered the ducks with them and prepared to take a
nap while they roasted. However, about the time he was drifting off to sleep,
branches from two trees began beating against each other in the wind. Finally,
Iktomi could not take it any longer and climbed up one of the trees so he could
separate the clashing branches. Just as he was doing that, the wind subsided and

the branches came to rest with Iktomi’s arm stuck in between them. He strug
gled in vain to get free. It wasn’t long before he could smell the wonderful
aroma of his roasting ducks.
As Iktomi gazed around from up in the tree, he saw a hungry-looking fox
wandering near the edge of the woods. The fox seemed to have picked up the
scent of Iktomi’s ducks but then lost it and began moving farther away. Iktomi
couldn’t help himself and yelled at the fox, “You get away from here! I’m cook
ing my ducks in the embers and I’m not going to share any with you!” At that
the fox turned around and headed straight to the fire pit. When the ashes cooled
off, the fox dug out one of the ducks and began eating. Iktomi screamed at the
fox to go away, but the fox continued his meal. The fox invited Iktomi to stop
hanging out in the tree and join him on the ground. When he was finished eating
the first duck, the fox started on another, and then another. Finally he decided
he’d better leave just a few ducks for Iktomi since he had been so generous to
share his meal. The fox thought about it for a while, but then remembering just
how tasty the ducks were, decided to have just one more. However, when he
reached into the ashes, he found that the ducks were all gone.
The fox was tired so he stretched out near the cooking pit and took a nap.
Before continuing on his way, the fox thanked Iktomi for being so gracious and
asked that he be invited the next time Iktomi decided to cook more ducks.
After the fox departed, a gust of wind came up and separated the branches that
had held Iktomi captive. Back on the ground, Iktomi stormed around his camp
site. He was furious because all that was left of his supper were cold ashes and a
big pile of duck bones.
Another day Iktomi was hungry and went looking for food. He came to a
river, but it was too deep for him to cross. So he began to cry. Sometime later a
bull buffalo came along and asked Iktomi why he was crying. Iktomi explained
that he wanted to cross the river but couldn’t. The bull was going across any
way, so he offered to let Iktomi ride on his back. “Your back is much too broad
for me to hold on to,” Iktomi exclaimed, “I’d surely slip off.” So the bull then
offered to let Iktomi hold onto his tail as they crossed. But, this time Iktomi de
clined by saying, “If you’d flick your tail, I’d go flying into the water.” Next the
bull offered to let Iktomi ride on top of his head and hang onto his horns.
Iktomi said that would not work either. “If you bent your head down to get a
drink, I’d fall into the river.” The buffalo was out of ideas and asked Iktomi if he
had any. Iktomi then explained what he thought would work best. “You could
swallow me and then I’d be able to cross safely. When you get to the other bank,
just cough me up.” That sounded reasonable to the buffalo. But when he got on
the other side, he forgot about Iktomi and found a nice place under a tree to
take a nap. Iktomi tried to get the bull’s attention, but he was sound asleep.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 179



Finally in desperation, Iktomi took his knife and cut his way out through the
bull’s side. Iktomi left the dead buffalo there and again went on his way.
Sometime later he saw some mice playing an interesting game. They were
tossing their eyes into the air. The one who could toss theirs the highest would
win. Iktomi asked to join them. When he tossed his eyes up, they landed high
in a tree. The mice ran away, fearing Iktomi would blame them for being blind.
Now Iktomi had to feel his way around. He could no longer cry, so he just made
pathetic moaning sounds.
One day someone nearby said to him, “Why are you crying like that?”
Iktomi explained about losing his eyes. He didn’t know he was talking with the
Spirit-Chief, but when the person told him to take his walking stick and make a
circle on the ground, Iktomi obeyed.
“Now,” the Spirit-Chief said, “we will stay inside the ring, and you will try
to catch me. If you do, your eyes will be returned to you.” So Iktomi tried to
catch the Spirit-Chief, but he couldn’t. For three days they ran around inside the
ring. Finally on the fourth day, Iktomi grabbed hold of the Spirit-Chief and his
eyes were restored immediately. Iktomi was grateful to have his eyes back.
Again Iktomi was traveling and came to a river he couldn’t cross. He saw a
large buzzard circling overhead and asked the bird to help him get to the other
side. The buzzard obliged. At first Iktomi was afraid of the heights, but soon he
began to enjoy soaring above the trees. He noticed a village nearby and asked
the buzzard to fly over the people. When the people on the ground saw Iktomi
flying overhead on the back of the buzzard, they were amazed. Iktomi was feel
ing a bit too sure of himself and made a fist at the buzzard’s head. However, the
buzzard saw the shadow of Iktomi’s fist and quickly deposited him in the top of
a hollow tree trunk. Iktomi was stuck in there and could only cry. Finally, he
heard some women walking nearby. He began singing out, “I’m a fat raccoon.
Whoever finds me will have plenty of grease.” So the women began chopping
down the tree. When it toppled over, Iktomi crawled out. He thanked them and
went on his way once again.

SPIDER WOMAN
Pawnee, Plains
In various tales from around North America, Spider Woman was frequently
seen as a kindly being who helped or gave advice to people in need. However, in
the following story from the Pawnee, she was a cannibal who met her end by
the quick wits of two young boys.
Long ago Spider Woman and her daughters lived off by themselves and
tended a garden. People would travel there to get corn, bean, and squash seeds
from the woman, but she would tell them that first they had to play a dice
game with her. In this game the people would jump up and down just as dice do
when tossed in a basket. While the people were jumping up, Spider Woman
would send storms and the people would freeze to death. Then she hung the
skulls of her victims from the walls of her lodge.
Finally the people decided that something had to be done about the Spider
Woman. There were two young boys in their village who seemed to possess
great powers. The people asked these boys to visit Spider Woman. The boys
traveled several days until they came to a cornfield with a grass lodge nearby.
Skulls were hanging from the walls of the lodge. They spoke with a girl outside
the lodge who warned them to go away quickly. If her mother saw them, she
would make them eat poisoned human flesh. The boys told her that they would
leave for a short time and then return.
When they were on the far side of the cornfield, the boys ate a piece of root
from their medicine bag and then returned to Spider Woman’s lodge. This time
she saw them draw near and called to them to come into her lodge. She sus
pected that they had come for her daughters and decided to kill them like all
the others who had approached her lodge. “You must be hungry,” she said to
them. The boys replied that they were, indeed, very hungry from their long
journey.
Spider Woman set bowls of food in front of them containing human brains
cooked into a mush. Behind her they could see the daughter shake her head,
warning them not to eat, but they did anyway. When they were finished the
boys excused themselves to go outdoors for awhile. Spider Woman feared they
would go away, but the boys promised her they would be right back. When they
had walked far enough away and were out of sight from the lodge, the boys
vomited the poisoned brains and then returned to the lodge. Spider Woman
thought it was strange that they appeared normal, so she gave them bowls of
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 181



what appeared to be black corn, but were really human eyes. Before they began
eating what she had prepared, they each took a bit of the medicine root from
their bag. Again, when they had emptied the bowls, they went outside and vom
ited all they had eaten.
Spider Woman decided that she couldn’t kill them with poison, so she
asked them to stay until the next morning and play a dice game with her. In the
morning she gave them what looked like squash but was actually human ears.
The boys used their medicine again, and when they came back to the lodge,
Spider Woman told them that it was time to play the dice game. The boys once
again walked out of sight of the lodge, but when they came back they were cov
ered with white clay and had black streaks painted below their eyes. They sat
down and Spider Woman began to sing and call for a windstorm to come. That
didn’t kill the boys, so she sang for a snowstorm to come. But, the boys turned
into snowbirds, and when the sun returned, they turned into larks.
Finally the woman decided she could not harm the boys so she told them to
go back to her lodge with her and they could have her daughters. But the oldest
boy said, “No, let me sing and you can dance.” First he called the blizzard, but
Spider Woman had power over snowstorms, so it didn’t harm her. Then he
called for boiling heat. She begged for him to stop, but he kept singing. Then
she felt herself being raised off the ground as the boy sang for a swarm of
grasshoppers to come. The grasshoppers flew all around her and lifted her up
into the sky. The boy kept singing the grasshopper song as the woman was
taken up to the moon where the grasshoppers left her. Then the grasshoppers
flew on to the sun, and that is why on hot summer days we see grasshoppers
swarming around in the sky. Today we can still see something on the moon. It
is Spider Woman’s dress.

STARS AND CONSTELLATIONS
Keenly aware of the sky above them, Native American storytellers wove many
tales about the origin of stars and constellations. Coyote is sometimes credited
with creating constellations, as are the Navajo Black God and the culture hero
Glooskap. Sometimes a culture hero becomes a star. The Juaneño people of

California believed the deceased turned into stars. Stars played, and continue to
play, important roles in ritual as well as mythology, particularly among the
Pawnee. Among the Navajo, a trained practitioner employs the skill of star gaz
ing to diagnose an illness that cannot be determined by visible symptoms, and
prescribes ceremonial treatment to cure the patient.
Native American storytellers often wondered why a star appeared to be
missing from an incomplete circle in the sky called the Northern Crown. An
explanation is offered by many versions of a favorite tale; the following was told
by the Ojibwas:
Long ago, a young hunter was returning to his village. He paused in a clear
ing when he came upon a strange, circular path. He could find no path leading
to the circle or away from it. He crouched down in the shadows of a birch grove
to wait and watch and see what might have made this circle. After night had
fallen, the hunter heard music and noticed a cluster of stars in the sky, traveling
toward him. He caught his breath as the cluster alighted in the clearing.
The hunter saw twelve beautiful maidens climb out of a basket and begin
to dance around the circle. He decided they must come there often, as they
seemed to be very familiar and comfortable with their surroundings. The
hunter stepped out of the shadows and approached the maidens. At once, the
music and dancing stopped, and they flew to their basket. It rose into the night
and went back from where it came.
The hunter returned to the clearing the following evening, determined to
discover whom or what he had seen. Events unfolded as they had before, though
this time he did not allow himself to be seen so soon. Again, the maidens ran to
their basket and disappeared. The hunter noticed that one of the maidens was
more beautiful and graceful than the others. He decided he wanted to know her,
so he decided to come to the circle again.
On the third night, the hunter changed himself into a mouse and hid in the
grass. As he watched quietly, the basket came down from the sky as before.
Each dance the maidens performed flowed into the other, and they remained in
the clearing until the stars had traveled from one horizon to the other.
The hunter inched his way forward as he watched the maidens. His heart
pounded for the one maiden, who was the youngest, as he crept toward her feet.
Again, the music suddenly ended, and the maidens ran to their basket. As he
sprang forward, the hunter became himself again and grasped the maid. The
others cried out for their youngest sister, but she was held fast by the hunter’s
arms, and the basket vanished back into the sky.
In time, the hunter won the star maiden’s heart, and they became husband
and wife. Eventually they had a son, and the star woman was happy.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 183



The star maiden came from the land of the star people, however, and she
could not live on earth forever. One night, while her husband and son slept, her
eleven sisters came down in their basket again and brought her back to the sky.
The star people were glad their dancing circle of sisters was complete again, but
they noticed the younger sister never smiled anymore, and she wept for the
family she had left behind.
The star people finally took pity on the youngest star sister. One night,
they brought the hunter and their son to the sky for a visit, but only for that
night. The father of the star people warned that they were earth people who
must return to their home or they would die. So the hunter and his wife and
child made the most of their brief time together.
The star people were moved as they watched the family. Because they
wished to help them, the father of the star people changed all three into white
falcons. Now they are neither earth people nor sky people and are free to visit
both whenever they desire. The remaining star maiden sisters of the Northern
Crown still dance together, but it is said that they will never leave the sky again.
The Milky Way, the broad band of billions of stars that arches across the
night sky, is featured in many Native American stories. Some tribes believed
that it was the path of migrating birds; some believed it was the road taken by
the dead. Others thought it was formed when Coyote sprayed stars across the
sky. In a story of the Snohomish, whalers and fishermen of the Northwest Coast,
the Milky Way is a river, the site of a conflict between earth and sky people.
There was once a time when the entire world was dark and cold, and a man
lived who made the strongest and tightest of canoes. He enjoyed making them so
much, he would start his work every day at dawn, while the stars could still be
seen in the sky, and he would continue late into the night, hammering, pound
ing, rubbing, and scraping to make the finest and most seaworthy of vessels.
The great chief of the sky was enraged by the endless noise he made, and
sent four of his men to capture Canoemaker and restore silence.
When Canoemaker’s people discovered he was missing, they searched
everywhere for him, as he was the only one across the land who made canoes of
such quality. They finally found an old man at the far end of the village who
spent much of his waking hours watching the world outside of his window. It
was he who told them of Canoemaker’s capture, and the villagers were very up
set by this news. While they wailed and complained and cried, the old man told
them that when he was a child, he used to hear storytellers say that the sky
could be reached by making a chain of arrows.
The desperate and unhappy villages raised their bows and shot arrows into
the air, but not one rose high enough to stay there. Robin came forward to help
them. He took one arrow and flew it high up into the sky, and Canoemaker’s

people were able to add theirs until an entire chain of them hung down into the
village. The villagers quietly climbed into the heavens, so the great sky chief
would not hear them.
When the last of the villagers had reached the sky, Robin decided to snoop
around. He discovered the village of the sky people along the Great White
River. He then discovered the Canoemaker tied to the roof of a house. He as
sured him that help was on its way and quickly left to alert his people.
By this time, Robin was growing cold, but he wanted to continue snooping.
As he went about, he began to feel something warm and decided to investigate.
Along the Great White River, he encountered a group of the sky people huddled
around a fire. As the lower world still had no fire, Robin did not know what this
strange glowing thing was. But he enjoyed the warmth and decided the village
should have some of it. Robin tried to ease his way toward the fire, so he could
take some back to earth. But each time he drew near, the sky people pushed
him back, which made Robin angry. He found Beaver and they conceived a plan.
Beaver floated down the river to where the sky people were gathered around
the fire. Some of the children saw him and began to tease and chase him. Beaver
played along with their game, all the while inching closer to the fire. Just as
Beaver drew right up to the fire, the people of Canoemaker’s village arrived to
rescue their friend. The angry sky people charged after them. In the confusion,
Beaver saw his chance and approached the fire, snatched a flaming stick, and
fled to a hole in the sky. In the meantime, Robin led Canoemaker’s people to
the rooftop where he was captive and untied him. All ran along the shore of the
Great White River to a hole in the sky. The chief of the sky people followed, but
all escaped safely down the chain of arrows.
Afterward, as the village people enjoyed the warmth of Beaver’s fire,
Canoemaker thanked them for his rescue. He gave them his solemn promise
that he would never anger the great chief of the sky people again. This is why
Canoemaker and his people no longer build their canoes early in the morning or
late at night.

STRONG MAN WHO HOLDS UP THE EARTH
Tsimshian, Northwest Coast
This myth relates the story of the man who supports the earth and causes
earthquakes. In some versions of this tale, he was called Am’ala, meaning
“smoke hole,” or Dirty.
At one time there was a chief who had four nephews. The oldest three worked
hard for their uncle, but the youngest nephew slept all day and didn’t do any work.
His brothers ridiculed the boy because he was lazy and slept in the ashes near the
fire. He didn’t go to the beach to bathe in the morning as they did, nor did the
brothers ever see him leave the house to relieve himself. They called him Dirty.
The chief’s three older nephews prepared themselves for the upcoming sea
lion hunt. Because it was a dangerous undertaking, only the strongest men were
allowed on the hunt. So the three brothers bathed every morning in the cold sea
water. Then the chief whipped them with branches, rubbed their muscles with
a concoction of boiled roots, and gave them cups full of devil’s-club tea to drink.
The chief had his nephews train to improve their strength by pulling branches
off of trees. The brothers also continued to deride the youngest one because he
was so dirty and lazy.
However, the lazy brother would go out at night to bathe in the sea and to
follow the training regime that his brothers did during the day. He would return
to his bed in the ashes before anyone else in the house was awake. That way he
kept his increasing strength a secret. The rest of his household were ashamed of
him and mocked him continuously, except for a younger uncle and his wife.
They felt pity for him and would give him food when no one else was around,
but they did not know about his nightly baths and training.
One night when Dirty was at the beach, a loon swam near and spoke to
him. The loon told him to grab his feet so they could dive under the water to a
cavern where there was a special spring. The young man was instructed to
bathe in the spring water in order to receive great strength. After he bathed,
Dirty returned to his sleeping space in the house. As his nightly training con
tinued, the loon said to the young man, “Go to a large spruce tree and after you
tear its branches off, you must bend the tree until its top reaches the ground.”
The young man did as instructed and then went back to the ashes to rest.
Handbook of Native American Mythology
186



When it came time for the sea lion hunt, the three older brothers jeered at
Dirty and called him names. Then they told him that he should at least help
the slaves carry the sea lion meat from the canoes to the house when they re
turned. The brothers set off for the hunt, each in the canoe of one of their un
cles. But the youngest uncle did not have anyone to go with him. Then Dirty
announced that he would go along on the hunt. The men all laughed and ac
cused him of being lazy and said that he would only be a hindrance to them.
However, his youngest uncle said, “Come with me. You can at least just sit in
the canoe.”
So the four canoes set out on the hunt and headed to the island of the sea li
ons. It was always stormy there with huge waves crashing on the rocky shore.
There was a danger that if a man missed the jump from the canoe to the rocks,
he would drown in the sea. If he did make it to shore, he might be attacked by
the sea lions. And so it happened that the first two uncles and everyone in their
canoes perished while trying to land on the island. Then Dirty said he would
jump onto the rocks. The men in the other canoe, however, wanted to turn
back home since the expedition was a failure. But Dirty, the youngest nephew,
was insistent. His uncle paddled the canoe to near the rocks and at the crest of
the next wave, the young man jumped to the rocks. A great sea lion charged
him, but Dirty grabbed the sea lion and broke its back. He killed more sea lions
until the others fled into the sea.
Each time the canoe rose on the crest of a wave, the young man stood on
the rock and placed one of the dead sea lions in it until the canoe was full. Then
they returned to the village and the other hunters who had ridiculed him and
returned with empty canoes were ashamed. The next day, he said to his
younger uncle, “Let’s go back for more sea lion meat.” They continued to do
this every day until the uncle’s house was full of meat. The uncle became a very
wealthy man because everyone had to come to him for their food.
Then the neighboring tribes gathered for strong-man competitions. Many of
the men had been in training for a long time. But Dirty didn’t participate in
their training. He continued to sleep in the ashes but secretly went out at night
to bathe and train. By now he was no longer just bending trees over but was
pulling whole trees out of the ground and carrying them to the beach, where he
threw them into the water.
The first competition was stone throwing. Each man took turns throwing a
large rock as far as he could. A giant of a man from another tribe threw the rock
the farthest. He called for the champions of the other tribes to try to do better
than his throw, but no one could. Then Dirty went down to the contest field.
His fellow villagers called to him to go back and not embarrass them any more,
but he didn’t pay any attention to them. When he saw the rock that the
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 187



contestants were throwing, he asked why they were using such a small stone.
He found a much larger boulder and effortlessly tossed it farther than the dis
tance anyone else had reached. The people were all amazed, but the young man
went back to his uncle’s house and sat in the ashes.
Then the wrestling competitions started. A huge man from another tribe
was winning every match. No one could defeat him. Finally he challenged the
people to send their strongest man out to meet him. No one dared to try. Then
the young man whom everyone called Dirty went to the beach to wrestle this
giant. The people from his village cried out, “No, don’t let him! He’ll be an em
barrassment to us.” When the wrestling began, the young man grabbed the gi
ant and threw him high in the air. When he fell back to the ground his bones
were all broken. No other wrestlers came forward to challenge him, so Dirty
went back home.
The last contest was for overall strength. The winner would be the one who
could uproot the largest tree and toss it onto the beach. Several men attempted
to do this, but all failed. Finally a man from one of the other tribes was success
ful, and no one else could match what he had done. Then that man and people
from his tribe called out for Dirty to try to do better, since he had won the first
two contests. When Dirty arrived at that place, he asked why they had used
such a small sapling. He then proceeded to shake a large tree. He pulled out the
branches and then lifted the tree and its roots completely out of the ground.
Then he carried it down to the beach.
Everyone was amazed and word about him spread far and wide. Finally the
animals, the mountain lion, the grizzly bear, and the wolf, came to challenge
him. But the young man was able to conquer them all. Then the forests and fi
nally the mountains themselves pushed down against the village, but the young
man drove them back.
Life for the young man and his people went back to normal. But one night a
canoe pulled up to the beach near his house and a stranger went in and woke
him. The stranger told the young man that his grandfather had sent for him and
he must go back with them. Quietly the young man left the house and went
with the stranger. The others in the canoe eventually removed their human ap
pearances and took the form of loons. Only his guide kept his human form.
When they reached an island, the guide told the young man that his grandfather
was very old and weak and needed him to replace him. So they followed a path
through the island. They came to a place where the stranger pulled back a cov
ering over a hole in the ground. The young man was led down a long ladder un
til they arrived at a platform. There sat a very old man who was holding a huge
pole. The old man had been holding up the earth since it was formed and was
now ready to rest. “That’s why you were trained to become so strong. I needed
Handbook of Native American Mythology
188



you to be able to take over my job.” He continued instructing the young man,
telling him that the loons would be his messengers and would constantly oil his
joints so he would not become stiff. He also warned the young man to keep
very still, because each time he shifted position he would cause earthquakes,
and if he would happen to collapse, the world would come to an end. And so the
young man took his place as the one who held up the earth.
When the people in his house woke up and found him missing, they
thought he had been kidnapped. But the younger uncle said, “No, he is super
natural. Nothing can harm him. He must be away doing something good.” The
people looked for him, but never found where he had gone. References and further reading:

SWEET MEDICINE
Cheyenne, Plains
Details of Sweet Medicine’s birth and parentage vary somewhat in versions of
this myth. In one he was an orphan who was being raised by an old woman.
Another version tells that he was born to a virgin girl who left him near a
stream, hoping someone would find and care for him. Here, too, he was raised
by an old woman whom he called Grandmother.
Sweet Medicine grew quickly and while still a boy performed his first mira
cle. The people’s food supplies were running very low, and the hunters could
not find any game. One day Sweet Medicine asked his grandmother to find an
old buffalo hide, soak it in the stream, and scrape it clean. While the hide was
soaking, he proceeded to cut four pointed sticks out of cherry wood. He also
formed a hoop from a willow branch. When the hide was clean and dried, Sweet
Medicine cut it into one long, thin strip. With this he wove a net across the
hoop, but left the center of the hoop open.
The next morning Sweet Medicine and his grandmother went to the middle
of the village and began playing a game. The old woman would roll the hoop to
ward Sweet Medicine and he would try to throw a stick through the center open
ing. People of the village came out to watch. On his first try, Sweet Medicine only
managed to knock the hoop over. He laid the first stick aside and sent the hoop
back to the old woman. Twice more she rolled the hoop toward him, but he could
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 189



not send the sticks through the opening. However, on the fourth try the stick hit
the center of the hoop and as it did, the hoop changed into a buffalo calf. The calf,
with the arrow in its side, took a few steps and then collapsed dead on the ground.
Sweet Medicine called for the people to get meat for themselves and their fami
lies. The meat did not run out and the people had plenty to eat.
Sometime later, Sweet Medicine was old enough to go on his first buffalo
hunt. While the other men and boys were aiming at the main herd, he found a
small group of buffalo off to the side and was able to kill one of them. When he
was nearly finished cutting meat off the carcass and piling it on the hide, an old
man came up and said he wanted the hide for himself. During the ensuing argu
ment about who would get possession of the hide, Sweet Medicine picked up
one of the buffalo’s leg bones and hit the old man on the head.
Then Sweet Medicine rolled up the hide with the meat inside and took it
back home to his grandmother. When the other hunters returned to the village,
they were angry about what had happened to the old man. The men came to the
tipi, but Sweet Medicine had already left. The next morning someone saw him
standing on the hill behind the village. Some of the people ran up the hill to get
him. But when they got to the top, he was already on the next hill. He motioned
for them to come after him, but they could not catch up with him. The first time
they saw him, he was dressed like a Fox Society warrior. The second time they
saw him, he had the weapons of an Elk warrior. When they saw him a third
time, he was wearing feathers and red paint like a Red Shield warrior. The fourth
time he looked like a Dog Society warrior. And the fifth time they saw him, he
was dressed like a Cheyenne chief. After that they did not see him again.
Sweet Medicine traveled across the prairie feeling that he was being drawn
to a sacred mountain. When he arrived there he found a large tipi filled with
many old people, both men and women. However, they weren’t people at all,
but spirits or gods who taught him many new things to take back to the
Cheyenne. They taught him about the Four Sacred Arrows. Two of the arrows
were for hunting and two for war. The arrows had great powers, and there were
many ceremonies and rules connected with them. The Old Ones taught him
new laws for governing the people and about the council of forty-four chiefs
that were to lead them. They also taught him how to set up the warrior soci
eties, how to honor women, and many more things that would benefit the
people. The teaching went on for four years. Finally it was time for Sweet
Medicine to return home and teach the people what he had learned. As he pre
pared to leave, one of the Old Ones burned sweet grass to purify him and the sa
cred arrow bundle he carried.
As he neared his village, some children who were hunting for mushrooms
were the first to see him. He learned from them that food was scarce again, so

190



he turned their mushrooms into buffalo fat and the children ate until they were
full. Sweet Medicine instructed them to take what was left to the village and to
tell the people that he had returned. Two young men went out to find him, but
all they saw was an eagle fly up to the sky. The next morning they set out and
again saw the eagle spread its wings and take flight. The same thing happened
on the third day. But on the following morning they found Sweet Medicine
standing on a hill with the arrow bundle in his arms.
Sweet Medicine ordered them to tell the people that he was coming with a
powerful gift and that they should set up a large tipi in the center of the village.
The people were to spread sage on its floor and burn sweet smelling grass. Then
all of them were to wait inside for him to come.
When the preparations were complete, Sweet Medicine began to walk
slowly to the village center. As he did, he called out four times, announcing to
the people that he was bringing them the sacred and powerful arrows that
would help them learn the right way to live. That night and for many nights to
follow, Sweet Medicine taught them what he had heard from the spirits about
the sacred arrows, the new laws, and new governing council.
The spirits had given Sweet Medicine the blessing of a long life, and he out
lived several generations. But finally, when his end was near, he instructed the
people to carry him to a place near the sacred mountain. There they built a
shelter and laid him in it. He ordered them to camp several miles away. But be
fore their last parting, he reminded the people what he had taught them and
cautioned them to remain faithful to his teachings. He also warned them of
things that would transpire in the future—the coming of horses and of white
men, the end of the buffalo, and many other strange things that would change
the way the people lived.

Haida, Tlingit, Northwest Coast
This tale is named for the main character, who becomes a shaman, and for the
spirit who speaks through him.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 191



One day a baby’s parents set him down in his cradle and wandered along
the shore to hunt for mussels. Then they remembered their baby and returned
for him. The parents saw a flock of crows sitting above him and heard what
sounded like singing. When they looked at their baby, he was acting like a
shaman. The parents picked him up and returned home, but they soon forgot
about the incident.
A few years later, people began to die because of him, and before long
nearly everyone in the village shunned him. Only his youngest uncle’s wife
took pity and brought him food. Eventually the boy went to live with his grand
mother, away from the village. The old woman eventually learned that the boy
had been given supernatural powers and helped him with the ceremonies of a
shaman. He learned how to build deadfalls and was very successful at killing
bear. Soon the boy and his grandmother had to build a larger house to hold all of
the meat, fat, and furs.
At night, some people from the village secretly came out to watch him per
form his ceremonies. About that time food in the village began to run out, so
the boy shared food with his youngest uncle’s wife, because she had been kind
to him. Then the chief’s son became sick. Shamans were called in from around
the land, but none of them could cure the boy. Tcaawunkl heard the drums and
went to the door of the house. Because of his supernatural powers, he could tell
that the chief’s son could be healed. So one day he sent word with his grand
mother offering to heal the boy. At first people laughed, but those who had
sneaked out to his house at night knew that he acted like a shaman. They en
couraged the chief to invite him to try. Tcaawunkl was successful and the boy
was cured. From then on he was welcome in the village again. He brought meat
to sell to the people and continued to work as their shaman.
Eventually his fame spread across the land. Then the son of the Chief of the
Land Otter people became ill. None of the Land Otter shamans could cure him.
So the chief sent Land Otters to bring Tcaawunkl to their land. The unsuccess
ful shamans were jealous and taunted him. But Tcaawunkl eventually pre
vailed, after throwing rotten urine on the other shamans, and saved the chief’s
son. The chief sent him back home with a canoe full of hides, boxes of grease,
and halibut hooks. They arrived at night and the Land Otters set the boxes and
hides on the beach and departed. In the morning when he went back to the
beach, there were only piles of seaweed and logs where the hides and boxes of
grease had been stashed. The halibut hooks had disappeared as well.

THUNDERBIRDS
Thunderbird myths were found in nearly all regions of North America.
According to a Teton (Lakota) myth, Inyan, who created Maka (the Earth),
also created the Wakinyan (at times called the Winged-One, Thunderbird, or
Thunderstorm) to be his messenger. The Wakinyan had mighty wings, a huge
beak, sharp teeth and claws, and lightning flashed from his eye. The sound of
his voice was the booming thunder. The little wakinyan echo after the great
thunder is heard. It was Wakinyan who oversaw the growth of living things,
controlled the clouds and weather, and destroyed those bent on evil. This pur
pose was given to Tate, the Wind, as well. One of the great enemies of the
Wakinyan was the water monster. The Wakinyan lived on a high mountain in
the west, near the west wind.
Beckwith related an Oglala myth that includes thunderbirds. A young man
named Plenty Horses was an only son and helped raise his father’s large herd of
horses. All of the new colts that were born one spring were strong and healthy
except for one that was sickly and pathetic looking. The young man found a
good mare to care for this colt, but the colt did not improve. Finally the young
man decided to kill the other colts, so he could spend all of his time and energy
caring for the sickly one. Still, the colt did not improve. This exasperated the
young man, and he decided to punish the colt by riding him into the west as
fast as he could go. When Plenty Horses decided to stop to rest, the colt kept on
galloping toward the west. The young man began to cry, but the colt said to
him, “Don’t cry. I’m taking you to a wondrous place.”
Eventually, they arrived at a camp where a contest was under way to see
who would marry a beautiful young woman. A bone ring was suspended from a
wooden scaffold. The young men would ride their horses past the ring and try to
throw a dart through it. One by one the others tried and failed. But when Plenty
Horses took his turn, his dart sailed through the ring. That night the young
woman disappeared. Plenty Horses found a trail heading east, so he rode off in
that direction until he came to a great lake. He didn’t know what to do, so he
sat on the back of his horse and cried.
The horse told Plenty Horses not to cry, but to shut his eyes tight. When he
finally opened his eyes, he was on an island. He found an old woman in a tipi
and told her that he was searching for the young woman he was supposed to
marry. The old woman told him to wait. “Your uncles, the four winds, will be
back soon,” she said, “and perhaps they can tell you where your bride was
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 193



taken.” The first to arrive came in a
black cloud with thunder and light
ning. His name was Owner-of-the
Water. But he had been too busy water
ing the land in the west to see the
young woman. Next to arrive was
Owner-of-the-Hail, who came out of
the north. He, too, had been busy tak
ing care of his territory in the north
and did not know anything about
Plenty Horses’ bride. The third to ar
rive had also been too busy to see
where the girl had gone. But when
Owner-of-the-Wind arrived amid a
storm from the east, he told Plenty
Horses that the young woman was to
be married the next day in the country
of the Thunderbirds.
The old woman opened up a large
rawhide blanket and told Plenty
Horses to sit in the middle. The four
winds carried him away. Sometime
later, Plenty Horses found himself in
the midst of another large gathering.
The young woman was about to be
married. When she saw him approach,
she ran to him and they disappeared.
Now when someone goes far away to marry, he says, “I’m going to be
Thunderbird’s son-in-law.”
In the following Skidi Pawnee myth, two boys saved a nest of young thun
derbirds from a water monster.
Two boys went hunting and stayed near a lake for quite some time. There
they lived on small game and fruit that grew in the area. One night they heard
strange noises coming from the lake. The boys stayed awake for a long time,
wondering what caused the commotion. They finally fell asleep, and when they
awoke they were in the lodge of some animals. The boys learned that they had
been brought there because of a monster in the lake that the animals wanted
killed. The water monster was destroying all of the young animals, and while
the older animals had tried to kill the water monster, they could not.

The animals gave the boys some blunt-ended arrows and instructed them
to use only these special arrows to shoot the monster. They also instructed the
boys that if the monster came near them, they were to shoot it in the mouth.
The boys took the arrows, and suddenly they were back at their campsite. They
stayed in that place for some time, expecting that the water monster would ap
pear any minute, but they did not see or hear it again. Eventually they decided
to climb a nearby hill and found it had a flat top and steep banks on three sides.
On one edge of the hill top was a large rock with a nest on it. The boys looked
in and found two small thunderbirds.
They decided to stay with the little birds and help care for them by bringing
them worms and insects. Occasionally, the mother thunderbird would come
with food and didn’t seem to mind that the boys were there. One day a cloud
approached and the boys thought they would get drenched, but they felt only a
few drops. The cloud moved on and hovered over the lake. The boys saw two
thunderbirds flying above the clouds. When the huge birds opened their
mouths, thunder rang out and lightning flashed. After a while the cloud re
turned to the hilltop. The boys looked down the hill and could see the monster
coming up from the lake. Lightning struck it, but the monster wasn’t affected.
It then began climbing up the hill. The mother thunderbird called to the boys,
“Help me save my children! I’ll give you the power of thunder and lightning if
you help me.”
The boys rushed to the edge of the hilltop and pulled out their arrows. They
shot at the monster, but the arrows just bounced off. Then the thunderbird
called out, “Use the blunt arrows!” Just then the monster opened its mouth
wide to swallow the little birds. The boys grabbed the blunt arrows and shot
straight into its mouth. The force of the arrows flung the monster on its back.
The arrows grew into large trees with deep roots so the monster could not
move, and it soon died.
The little thunderbirds were saved and the mother kept her promise. The
boys received the power of the thunder and lightning. However, they didn’t tell
anyone about it until one year when the land was parched. They prayed for rain
and the rain came. Then they shared the story of the thunderbirds and the water
monster.
In some myths from the Pacific Northwest the Thunderbird was able to
change into human form, as in the following brief story.
Two brothers went to the woods for several months. During their stay, they
purified themselves by washing in a lake and rubbing their skin with evergreen
branches until they no longer had the scent of humans on them. Then the
young men climbed a nearby mountain to the home of the Thunderbirds. When
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 195



they entered the house, a woman welcomed them in and told them that her
husband and his brother were away but would return soon. She hid the men in a
corner, and soon the Thunderbirds returned with the sound of a great wind. The
Thunderbirds were not fooled by the men. They told the woman that they
could smell men in their house. So the woman had the young men come out of
hiding. The Thunderbirds removed their belts and feather garments and then
took the appearance of men.
Many of the people in the Northeast Woodlands also told of great
Thunderbirds. A Passamaquoddy myth tells of two men who wanted to locate
the source of thunder. They began walking north until they came to a certain
mountain. The mountains in this area did strange things, including moving to
gether and then parting again. The men’s path went through these mountains,
so one of the men said, “I’ll go first. If I get caught between the mountains,
then you go on alone to find the thunder.” The first man went through the
pass before it closed, but the second one was smashed between the mountains.
The first man went on by himself and soon found a village where some
people were playing ball. After some time, one of the players said to the others,
“It’s time to go now.” They all went into their wigwams, put on their wings,
and gathered outside with their bows and arrows. Then they flew off over the
mountains. This is how the man found where the thunderbirds lived. The old
men of that village who stayed behind asked the man, “What are you doing
here? Who are you?” So he told them about his quest and about his friend who
died trying to get through the mountains. The old men thought about what to
do. Finally they put the man in a mortar, ground him up, and then formed him
into a new shape with wings like a thunderbird. Then they gave him a bow and
arrows and sent him on his way back home. But, they warned him not to fly
too close to the tree tops or he’d get stuck in them.
At first the thunderbird-man was unable to reach his home because a great
enemy bird stirred up a strong wind that blew him off course. Over time,
though, this new thunderbird became very powerful and kept guard over the
Passamaquoddy people.

THUNDERERS
Northeast Woodlands
Natural phenomena such as thunder and lightning have been a cause of awe and
fear across the ages. Some myth stories ascribe the booming sound and flashing
light to great thunderbirds, while others tell of great, human-like gods who are
known as Thunder or the Thunderers.
The god of thunder and/or rain was often thought beneficent. One myth re
ported by Barbeau tells of seven brothers who lived in the heavens. Henon (also
spelled Hinon or Hinun) was good natured but more energetic and boisterous
than his brothers, who worried about him because of his strength. They feared
that someday Henon might become angry and destroy them all. So the six
brothers debated about what could be done. Finally, they decided on a plan.
They invited Henon on a hunting trip to a distant island. There the brothers
said they would each go off in a different direction to chase the deer towards
Henon. However, instead of doing that, the brothers headed back to their ca
noes and quickly set off for home. Before they were out of sight, Henon sensed
that something wasn’t right. He ran down to the shore and called out to his
brothers to come back for him.
The brothers yelled back, “It’s safer for everyone if you stay on the island.”
Henon thought about it, then good-naturedly agreed. He remained on the island
by himself, but occasionally his voice would be heard booming out across the
water. If thunder was heard during the winter, people would smile and say, “Oh,
something must have awakened Henon from his nap.”
In a Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) myth retold by Beauchamp, three men were
returning from a raid on a distant land. One of the men broke his leg. His
friends carried him for many days but eventually tired of their burden. There
was a crevice nearby and the men tossed the injured fellow into it. Then they
quickly returned home and reported that the third man had been mortally
wounded by the enemy and died as they tried to bring him home. His mother
grieved for many days for her only son.
However, the injured man was not the only one at the bottom of the
crevice. An old man who was crouching in the corner asked him, “What did
your friends do to you?” The injured man replied that he’d been tossed in there
to die. But the old man said, “You will not die if you promise to do what I say.”
When the injured man inquired what that would be, the old man said that all he
needed to do was to hunt for him.
So, the injured man agreed and the old man then proceeded to treat the bro
ken leg with herbs and cared for him as he recovered. By winter the young man
was able to go out hunting. The old man offered to help carry bundles of meat if
there was ever more game killed than the injured man could carry. As the
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 197



winter progressed, the man had to search for game farther and farther away
from the crevice. One day he saw three men approaching who appeared to be
dressed in clouds. They told him that old man who also lived in the crevice was
not what he appeared to be. They were Thunderers and had been sent on a mis
sion to find and destroy serpents and all who devastated crops. When there was
a drought they were to bring beneficial rain. They promised if the young man
would help them, he would be returned home so he could care for his mother.
The young man agreed. He went back to the crevice and told the old man
that he had killed a bear and needed help carrying all of the meat back to their
shelter. The old man was wary and asked if there were any clouds in the sky.
“No, the sky is clear.” So the old man went along, urging that they hurry about
their task. While they were packing up the meat they had cut up, a cloud
quickly arose. When the old man saw it, he dropped his pack and ran back to
ward the crevice. As he ran, he became a huge porcupine. The Thunderers
hurled bolts of lightning down and killed the animal just as it got to its den.
Then, as promised, they returned the young man to his village. His mother was
overjoyed to see him safe and sound. It wasn’t until the next spring when the
Thunderers returned that the young man told the people of his adventures with
them. He explained the good works they did for the people.
A Seneca myth tells of a young boy who was out hunting. As he was walk
ing through the woods he noticed a brightly colored worm on a branch of a
nearby tree. He watched it for quite some time and then went home. The next
day, on his way home, he walked past the same tree. The colorful worm was
still there, so the boy tore off a piece of one of the birds he had killed and fed it
to the worm. This became a routine with the boy feeding the worm each day on
his way back home. However, the worm began to grow quickly and needed
more and more food. Soon he was feeding the worm a whole bird, and then two
birds. Finally the worm became so heavy that the branch could no longer hold it
and it fell to the ground.
One day some of the boy’s friends were with him and saw the worm. They
had great fun feeding the worm the game they had caught. By now the worm
was eating rabbits and growing larger every day. Then one day, the boys were
jostling each other to see who would get to feed the worm next when one small
boy was knocked on the ground. The worm immediately swallowed the boy.
The others ran home, but didn’t tell what had happened. The parents of the
missing boy questioned them, but all they said was that they’d seen him earlier
in the day. The great worm held the boys in its spell and caused them to push
others of their group close to the worm so they were eaten, too. One day the re
maining boys came to where the worm was and realized it had killed a deer.
They were so frightened they ran back to the village without feeding it as usual.
Handbook of Native American Mythology
198



The next morning the village, which was situated on the top of a hill,
was surrounded by the monstrous worm. Some people tried to escape, but
were swallowed by the worm. Finally, the boys confessed and told the whole
story. The people who remained discussed their plight. In the end they de
cided to plead for their lives to Henon, the Thunderer. They burned sweet
smelling tobacco and offered prayers. Soon they saw a dark cloud approach
ing and heard the peals of thunder. Lightning struck the huge worm and
severed it into pieces. These pieces rolled down into the valley and were
turned into a lake. See also Thunderbirds

TIRAWA
Pawnee, Plains
The Pawnee’s supreme deity was known as Tirawa. Sometimes this god was
also referred to as Tirawahat or Tirawahut, although this term may also mean
the abode of the gods.
Tirawa created the sun, moon, and stars, set them in the heavens, and as
signed their individual roles and powers. He then set about creating the earth
and living creatures. Animals were given knowledge and power and functioned
as messengers from Tirawa to men.
The humans of today were not the first people Tirawa created. Long ago
there were giants on the earth. These giants did not respect Tirawa, their creator,
and were very wicked and rebellious. Tirawa decided to destroy them with light
ning. But since the giants were very large and powerful, the lightning had no ef
fect on them. So Tirawa sent a heavy rain. Much of the land was covered with
water and the giants fled to high ground. But the rain continued and the ground
became soft. The giants sank in the mud and were buried. Their bones can be
found today in many places, especially where rivers have eroded away the banks.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 199



Tirawa instructed the gods of the Winds, Clouds, Lightnings, and Thunders
to create the things that humans would need—the trees and plants, streams and
lakes. The son of the Moon and Sun and the daughter of Bright-Star and Great
Star became the first humans on earth. At Tirawa’s command, the gods taught
the people how to hunt and plant, and how to make weapons, fire, shelters, and
clothing. They also instructed the people about ceremonies they were to per
form and gave them the sacred bundles.
Far from being distant and disinterested, Tirawa (also called A-ti’-us,
meaning “father”) was described in several myths as feeling compassion for
his creation. One of the tales relates the story of a poor, orphaned boy who
was raised by a widow who had two children of her own. There was a famine
and the people traveled south hoping to find buffalo or other game. Finally,
the orphan was so weak he could go no farther. When the people moved on,
he stayed behind and gathered sticks to make a fire. After a while he fell
asleep, and when he awoke, he saw two dark spots in the sky. He kept watch
ing them as they drew closer and they appeared to be swans. But he grew tired
and soon was asleep again. The next time the orphan awoke he found himself
in front of a very large lodge with paintings of animals on the walls. The or
phan boy pulled himself up and walked to the door of the lodge. There across
from the door sat A-ti’-us. He was large and handsome and dressed in beauti
fully embroidered clothes and a white buffalo robe. There were many other
chiefs sitting on the sides of the lodge. They were also dressed in wonderful
clothes.
The boy entered the lodge. A-ti’-us welcomed him and instructed one of the
chiefs to give him something to eat. The chief cut off a small piece of meat. The
boy was starving and thought that the piece of meat was much too small, but
he started eating anyway. No matter how many slices the boy cut off, the piece
of meat remained the same size. He soon had eaten his fill and there was still
meat left over. When the boy was finished eating, A-ti’-us told him that he had
seen the suffering of the people and explained what the boy should do.
Eventually the boy was sent back with new clothes and weapons. When he was
led out to the swans, a deep sleep came over him, and the next thing he knew
he was waking up next to his fire.
He stood up and felt strong again. He started to run and by evening caught
up with his people. When he reached the woman’s lodge, she was cutting up the
last of a buffalo robe to cook for their meal. The boy went back outside and the
woman heard what sounded like a buffalo snorting and then the sound of some
thing heavy collapsing in the snow. The boy came back in and told the woman
to go outside and bring in some meat. The woman was amazed, but did what he
said and outside she found a buffalo cow. After skinning it she cooked some of

the meat. When her children and the boy had eaten, she sent for her relatives
and friends to come and share in the feast. When they had all eaten, they prayed
to the Father, thanking him for giving them food.
Then the orphan told the woman’s son to run to the top of a nearby hill and
report what he saw. He returned, saying that there was nothing but snow as far
as he could see. The orphan told him to go back and look again. He returned
with the same report. So the orphan went there himself. When he looked out
over the valley he could see that it was full of buffalo. He signaled for the
people to follow him. The buffalo could not get away from the hunters because
they were stuck in the deep snow. In time the orphan boy became very wealthy
and a great man among the people.

TOBACCO
Native to the Americas, tobacco has been cultivated and used by tribal
groups of the North American continent since before the arrival of
Europeans. Research has led to the conclusion that precontact tobacco use
originated with the Native peoples of South America and spread gradually
north. Prior to European contact, the most common species of tobacco used
was Nicotiana rustica, not the Nicotiana tabacum that is smoked today. It
was used primarily by Native Americans of the eastern United States and the
Great Plains.
Tobacco was used for a variety of ceremonial and religious purposes.
Supplies were small, and it was considered sacred. Tobacco smoke represented
contact between this world and that of the supernatural. Tobacco was also
smoked as a medicine in curing and healing, to suppress hunger, and in agricul
tural rites. Tobacco societies existed among tribes of the Plains, and certain du
ties were required of initiates. These included the selection of medicine, sweat
lodge rituals, and the planting of sacred tobacco. Frequently, tobacco was used to
cement agreements between tribes, as offerings, to show respect, or as payment.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 201



Because of its long-standing
importance and widespread use, it
is not surprising that tobacco is
featured in many Native American
myths and stories, many of which
tell of its origin.
In a Siksika (Blackfeet) story,
four medicine men kept the sacred
tobacco for themselves, instead of
sharing it with others and teaching
them how to use it. But a young
man and his wife, determined to
bring tobacco to the tribes, were
given the seed and taught the
songs, prayers, dances, and cere
monies that go with it by four
man-beavers.
Another Siksika story tells
how a poor young man, Apikunni,
was publicly humiliated when his
love for the youngest wife of the
old chief was discovered. He wan
dered away from his village and
spent the winter living with an old
beaver, who told him how to defeat
his enemy and instructed him on
how to use certain medicines, in
cluding tobacco seed. Apikunni
pierces his foe—the first man ever killed in war—with an aspen stick given to
him by the beaver. He subsequently returns to his village with great honors.
The old chief retires and makes Apikunni the new chief. He then marries the
youngest of the former chief’s wives and acquires the other two wives as ser
vants. At a village council, he shares the information the beaver gave him and
teaches the people how to use the Beaver Medicine (tobacco) in their cere
monies.
Several Cherokee stories tell of the origin of tobacco.
There was a time when tobacco, with which they had been made ac
quainted by a wandering stranger, was not readily available to the Cherokee.
Having smoked it in their large stone pipes, the Cherokee were anxious to ob
tain abundant supplies. They determined that the area where it grew in the
Handbook of Native American Mythology
202
Piegan man holding a medicine pipe, 1910. (Library of
Congress)



greatest quantities was situated on the big waters, and that the mighty moun
tain gorge that led to it was guarded by little people or spirits.
A council of brave men of the nation was called to discuss bringing back
some tobacco from the dangerous and unknown country. A bold young warrior
stepped forward and volunteered to undertake the task. He departed but never
returned, and the Cherokee Nation was now in great tribulation. Another coun
cil was held to consider and decide upon another strategy. A celebrated magi
cian stepped forward and volunteered to visit the tobacco country and see what
he could do. He changed himself into a mole and made his way east of the
mountains; however, he was pursued by the guardian spirits and was forced to
return home empty-handed. Next, he turned himself into a hummingbird, and
succeeded, to a very limited extent, in obtaining some of the precious tobacco.
Upon his return, he found several friends at the point of death because of their
intense desire for it. He placed some of the fragrant weed in a pipe and blew the
smoke into the nostrils of those who were ill and happily revived them.
The magician became the sole possessor of all the tobacco in the unknown
land and decided to avenge the young warrior’s death. He turned himself into a
whirlwind, and, passing through a mountain gorge on his way, stripped the
mountains of their vegetation and scattered large rocks in the valley, frighten
ing away the little people and guardian spirits. He found the bones of the young
warrior in a stream bed and brought him back to life as a man. They returned to
their home country laden with tobacco, and ever since then it has been plenti
ful throughout the entire land.

TRANSFORMATION, HUMAN-ANIMAL
Human-animal and animal-human transformation, sometimes referred to as
shape-shifting, is a common theme in mythological narratives across the length
and breadth of North America. Occasionally, evildoers transform themselves
into benign creatures in order to facilitate their wicked ways. In other tales, the
transformation occurs as the outcome of an event or series of events in which
the individual finds himself or herself.
Parker noted the Seneca belief that “any being possessing orenda may
transform himself into any form, animate or inanimate.” This orenda was
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 203



described as a magical power or a type of supernatural power that would give its
possessor the ability to overcome the laws of nature. Humans could transform
themselves into whatever form they wished and then transform back again, if
they so chose. Animals possessing orenda could transform themselves into hu
mans and live as one of them.
Often times, a Trickster, such as Raven or Coyote, transformed himself in
order to manipulate a situation. Raven wished to obtain light, so he traveled to
where the chief who kept the light lived. Raven devised a plan and turned him
self into a small leaf that fell into a drinking cup. After being swallowed by the
chief’s daughter, Raven became a baby inside of her, and eventually he was born
as the chief’s grandson. The chief naturally doted on the baby and spoiled him
terribly. The baby soon demanded to be allowed to play with a special box that
the grandfather kept high on a shelf. In time the grandfather gave the little boy
the box—with the stipulation that he must never open it. Raven promised the
grandfather that he’d keep the lid on tightly, but of course, as soon as he was
left alone, Raven opened the box. Out flew the stars, moon, and the sun.
Some transformations occur in order that lovers may live together happily
ever after. The Shawnee told of a young hunter named Waupee who roamed far
from home one day and approached a clearing in the forest. As he entered the
open space, he saw a circular path worn in the grass, but without any path leading
to it from the forest. Curious to find out who or what had made the circle,
Waupee hid himself at the edge of the clearing. Soon he heard a faint sound of
music coming from the sky. When he looked up, he saw something coming down
toward the clearing. The small spot in the sky quickly grew larger until Waupee
saw it was a large basket containing twelve beautiful sisters, daughters of a star.
He continued to watch as the sisters jumped out of the basket and sang and
danced around the clearing. Although the sisters were all beautiful to behold,
Waupee was smitten with the youngest. Finally he rushed out from his hiding
spot and attempted to capture her. But the sisters all rushed back to the basket
and returned into the sky.
Waupee returned home but could only think about the lovely young girl he
had seen. So on the following day, he decided to go back to the ring where the
sisters had danced. This time he changed himself into an opossum and hid at
the edge of the forest clearing. Again the basket came down from the sky and
the sisters danced around the ring. Waupee, in the form of an opossum, slowly
moved toward the ring. But the creature frightened the sisters and they ran back
to the basket and returned to the sky. Waupee, changing back to his original
form, sadly walked home.
The next day Waupee returned to the clearing. He spotted mice running
in and out of an old stump. Waupee thought, “Perhaps the young women will
Handbook of Native American Mythology
204



not be afraid of a little mouse.” So he
moved the old stump close to their
dancing ring and changed himself into
one of the mice. Soon the basket with
the sisters returned. They began to
dance as before, but one of them no
ticed the stump and said, “That has
not been here before!” The youngest
sister became frightened and started
to run back to the basket, but the oth
ers laughed and gathered around the
stump. With sticks, they began hitting
the stump, and soon mice were run
ning out. The sisters killed all of the
mice with their sticks, except for one.
That one was caught by the youngest
sister. As soon as she grabbed the
small mouse, Waupee changed into
his normal form and held on tightly to
the young girl. The other sisters were
able to escape back to the sky in their
basket.
Waupee gently wooed the young
girl. He told her about his skill as a
hunter, and about the wonderful earth
she now lived in. By the time they
reached his home, Waupee was the
happiest of all men.
Time passed, and a son was born to them. But Waupee’s wife had not for
gotten her home among the stars and longed to return. On days when her hus
band was out hunting, the young woman would work on constructing a wicker
basket and collecting many delicacies from the surrounding region. When ev
erything was prepared, the young woman took the basket and supplies to the
clearing, and along with her son, climbed into the basket. As she began to sing,
the basket rose into the sky. Waupee recognized the song and ran to the clear
ing. But he was too late; they had risen far up into the sky.
Waupee was heartbroken at the loss of his wife and especially his son.
Meanwhile, his wife and son arrived at her former home. She would have for
gotten all about her husband and life on earth, if it had not been for her son.
Each time she saw him, she was reminded of his father. As the child grew, he
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 205

facilitate the loon’s changing into the form of a
man, 1914. (Library of Congress)



became more and more anxious to learn more about his father and wanted to
visit the place where he was born.
Finally the young woman’s father gave his blessing for them to return to
earth. “Take your son to his father, but ask the man if he would return back here
with you. Ask him also to bring along one of each kind of bird and of each ani
mal he kills. So, the young woman took the child and returned in the basket to
where her husband lived. Waupee heard the singing as the basket descended and
ran to the clearing. He was overjoyed to hold his wife and son in his arms again.
The young woman told him about her star-father’s request. Waupee set out
immediately to find the objects his father-in-law asked for. When everything
was ready, he joined his wife and son in the basket and soon they were ascend
ing into the heavens. The star chief called a feast and everyone was invited to
choose a gift from what Waupee had brought along. Those who chose tails or
claws suddenly became animals and ran off. Others became birds and flew
away. Waupee chose a white hawk’s feather for himself, his wife, and their son.
Soon they spread their wings and flew with the other birds down to the earth
and their kind are still found on earth today.
Sometimes the change takes place in a person’s spirit long before it is made
evident by a physical transformation.
Once, long ago, a young Zuni woman was captured by a Navajo raiding
party. She was tied to the back of a horse and the group galloped back to the
Navajo village. The young woman was taken to the home of a Navajo man to
become his younger wife. However, by the second night, she chose to sleep
alone outside. Very early the next morning, when the young woman awoke, she
found the older wife standing beside her. The Navajo woman offered the Zuni
girl a blanket, food, and container of water, and then pointed to the east where
the sky was just beginning to turn light. The Zuni girl gratefully took the items
and ran from the Navajo village toward the rising sun.
She ran quickly through the underbrush and covered her tracks when she
walked on sandy riverbanks. Finally she reached the top of a high mesa and
looked back in the direction she had traveled. No one was following her, so she
unwrapped the package of food and ate it all and drank most of the water. After
the refreshing meal and rest, the Zuni girl began to run again until evening. She
dug into the ground under a large tree and slept in the depression. Later, when
she awoke, she was hungry again, but found that she’d consumed all of her food
on the mesa. Then she tried the water container, but it, too, was empty. The
girl was frightened, cold, and tired, but she got up and began running toward
home again.
Another night came and she fell asleep huddled under the Navajo blanket.
Snow fell and covered the ground. When she awoke, the girl pushed the cold,
Handbook of Native American Mythology
206



wet blanket away and started running again. However, exhaustion soon caught
up with her and she collapsed on the snowy ground. A large, white, furry ani
mal came to examine her nearly lifeless body. The animal looked toward the
heavens and let out a spine-tingling howl and trotted off. The girl tried to sit up,
but collapsed again. The white wolf returned quickly, pulling a freshly killed
animal. He pulled it up over the girl to give her warmth. Then the wolf tore off
a piece of the prey’s flesh and pushed it into the girl’s mouth. She ate the raw
meat and was grateful for the warmth of the dead animal covering her.
When she had recovered the young girl began running toward home once
more. She ran all day and again collapsed in the snow when her strength was
gone. Soon the white wolf found her and lay in the snow beside her to keep her
warm. For four more days the two traveled together toward the east. On the
morning of the fifth day, the girl could see her village and ran down the slope
toward it with the white wolf running beside her. The girl called out to the
people who only stared at the strange sight. She told them her name and how
happy she was to have returned home. Some men grabbed their bows and ar
rows and pointed them toward her and the wolf. The girl stopped suddenly, con
fused by what she saw. The men ordered her to move away from the wolf so
they could kill it. Just then the girl realized that the men thought the wolf was
chasing her. “No! Stop! This wolf saved me and brought me home.”
The men lowered their bows. As they approached her, the wolf disappeared
and the girl sank to the ground. She was carried to her father’s home. When the
girl awoke she was lying on the floor next to her father’s corpse. As she looked
around, she realized the house had been stripped bare. Her father had died while
she was gone and no one was there to prepare his body for burial. Tenderly she
washed her father’s hair, dressed him, and covered him with a blanket. No one
spoke to her as she made her preparations, nor while she pulled his body to the
Cliff of Death. The young girl continued to live in her house alone.
Occasionally food was left at her door overnight, but no one dared speak to her.
Over time the young girl became an old woman. She knew there would be
no one to take her to the Cliff of Death when the time came, so she decided to
prepare her body and dress in her burial clothes. Unable to stand any longer, the
woman dragged herself through the village—the village that had been her home.
The people watched as she made her way up the hill. They saw her turn to look
back at the village and suddenly a chilling howl pierced the air. The howl came
from the old woman as her body changed into a white wolf. The White Wolf
Woman howled again and then with strong legs loped away over the hills. She
still roams the area today and White Wolf Woman Canyon is named for her.
People tell of being lost in that canyon, but White Wolf Woman shows them the
way home.

TRANSFORMER
The word transform means to alter, change, and modify. Many of the transform
ers in Native American mythology were individuals who were active in chang
ing or reforming the earth and getting it ready for the coming of animals and
humans. Often the transformer changed the shape of the land, set the moun
tains and lakes in their places, and taught humans and animals how they
should live. Coyote, Glooskap, Manabozho, Old Man, and Raven were all trans
formers as well as culture heroes or tricksters. Ives stated that Kluskap
(Glooskap) is “the Wabanaki culture hero. He is not a god; that is, he is neither
a judge of man nor a creator. He is a transformer. The world was here when he
arrived, and all he did was to fix it up a little.”
Franz Boas, in discussing origin myths, indicated that the concept of the cre
ation of the world and everything on it from nothingness or from the imagination
of a Creator was generally unknown to most Native American groups. Instead it
was widely believed that the earth had some sort of form previously and that a
creator, but not necessarily the Creator, molded, rebuilt, or rearranged the exist
ing substance and “created” a new earth. Humans, animals, and vegetation were
also frequently transformed from a past state into the way they are now.
The Earth Diver myths are an example of a transformer’s work in changing
the shape of the world and making it ready for mankind. Radin and Reagan re
lated that Manabozho was floating on a raft after a flood covered the whole
world. He had forgotten to take some soil along with him, so he chose four
divers from among the animals that were swimming along beside the raft.
After several unsuccessful tries, Muskrat was able to bring up mud and some
seeds from the bottom of the sea. Manabozho dried the lump of mud and seeds
and then began to blow on them. An island formed around the raft. After a
time, Manabozho sent a raven out to see how large the land had become, and
the raven returned in two days. Manabozho decided that it was not big enough,
so he continued to blow on the dirt until the land extended farther than any
one could see. This time when he sent the raven out, it did not return. So

Manabozho knew the land was big enough. Then he set about establishing the
plants and the forests. When he was finished, Manabozho returned home.
Among the people who lived along or near the southern portion of the
Pacific Northwest coast, a number of transformer myths are known. The
Kwakiutl knew the transformer as Kánekelak. Their father, Heron, made
Kánekelak and his younger brother go hungry. One day Heron and the boys’ red
headed stepmother went to the river and found a salmon in the trap. Heron
asked his wife, “How can we keep this salmon away from the boys?” The step
mother said, “Scare them.” So the father called to the boys, “Hurry! Run! A
ghost is coming!” When the boys ran off to hide, the parents roasted their catch
and ate it all before the boys returned home.
The next day the parents found two salmon in the trap, and again they told
the boys to run away and hide. On the following two days the same thing hap
pened, except that on each day subsequent there was more salmon in the trap.
But, the greedy parents would not share their roasted salmon with the boys.
However, on the fourth day, Kánekelak peeked through a hole in the side of the
house and saw his parents eating the roasted salmon. Then he heard Heron say,
“Hurry, let’s eat all of the salmon and hide the bones, so the boys won’t find
them.” At that Kánekelak ran inside and threw his father in the air. “Now,” he
said, “you will become the heron.” Then he turned to his stepmother and threw
her into the air. “And you will be the redheaded woodpecker.”
Kánekelak now named his brother Only One and built a huge house for
him to live in. Then he killed four whales so Only One would have plenty of
food to eat. Kánekelak then began traveling around and having many adven
tures. Once he came upon a man by the name of Deer. This man was sharpen
ing mussel shells. When Kánekelak asked what he was doing, the man replied,
“Don’t you know? Kánekelak is coming and I need to be ready to defend my
self.” Kánekelak had a better idea. He attached a mussel shell to the man’s ears
and said, “You will now become the deer.” At that Deer jumped and ran off into
the woods. Kánekelak continued his travels and met many people whom he
recreated as the animals we know today.

TRICKSTER
The trickster is featured in myths and legends in many parts of the world, and
numerous scholars have attempted to analyze the trickster’s meaning in social,
psychological, and religious contexts. The character is a complex blend of per
sonalities. Although most often portrayed as male, the trickster is occasionally
depicted as female. The North American trickster is frequently seen as a creator
or re-creator of the world. He is the one who taught mankind and the animals
how to live and gave them the necessities of life: daylight, fire, and water. He is
what Ricketts called a “‘trickster-transformer-culture hero’ (or ‘trickster-fixer’
for short.)”
On the other hand, the trickster can be a self-centered prankster who is for
ever on the lookout for his next scam, meal, or sexual encounter. Often his
schemes are foiled when humans or animals see through his devious and lecher
ous ways; at other times, they backfire on him. Carroll suggested that the term
trickster has been used too broadly and argues against classifying a “clever
hero” such as Robin Hood, or even Brer Rabbit, as a trickster. The North
American trickster, he argues, is undoubtedly a “culture hero” and at times a
“buffoon.”
Carroll also noted that scholars have grouped North American trickster
tales into seven broad categories: Coyote is found most often west of the
Mississippi River; Nanabush (and variant names such as Manabozho and
Winabojo) in the Northeast; Raven in the Northwest; Rabbit in the Southeast;
Hare and Iktomi, the Spider, among the Siouan people; and Napi in the Plateau
and northern Rockies. Each of these tricksters exhibits human characteristics
while often, but not always, being associated with particular animals such as
the coyote, raven, hare (rabbit), and spider.
Erdoes and Ortiz compared Coyote to some of the gods from Greek and
Roman mythology who used an assortment of tricks and disguises, including
transforming themselves into animals, to seduce young women. Like the North
American tricksters, the gods of classical mythology were at times creators,
benefactors, and meddlers in the lives of humans. For more discussion on this
topic, see Radin’s The Trickster: A Study in American Indian Mythology.
Nanabush, according to Ridie Wilson Ghezzi, was a culture hero who trans
formed the world after a great flood, interceded between the gods (or spirits) and
mankind, and taught important life skills to the people. As a trickster, however,
Nanabush exemplified the type of actions and attitudes to avoid. Thus the nar
Handbook of Native American Mythology
210



ratives of the Nanabush cycle were meant to educate the entire society by illus
trating what was moral and what was considered immoral behavior.
Spider (called Iktomi by the Teton [Lakota] and Dakota [Sioux]) was origi
nally named Ksa, the god of wisdom. As Ksa, he created time, named the ani
mals, and gave men their languages. But after disgracing a goddess, Ksa was ban
ished from the feasts of the gods and became Iktomi, the Spider. He used both
his wisdom and his trickster traits to plot deceptions against men and animals.
Iktomi was famous for his sexual appetite and abilities, and even broke a nearly
universal taboo when he made love to his daughters. This often despised and
mischievous creature is nevertheless considered wakan (sacred).
In the Pacific Northwest, Raven was the one who reformed the land after a
great deluge and brought the people salmon. But in other tales, Raven is greedy
and lacks foresight. Although Hays referred to Raven as a trickster, he noted
that “he also shades into culture hero and magician—with episodes in which he
is pure schlemiel.”

Rabbit was seen as a culture hero in some trickster tales found in the
Southeast. However, the Creek told of a deceitful, conniving Rabbit who tried
the people’s patience far too long. A trial was held and Rabbit was found guilty
and condemned to death by drowning. True to his nature, Rabbit found a way to
foil the plan and escaped with his life. He later returned to the people and de
ceived them yet again.
Napi, the Old Man of the Siksika and related tribes, ordered mud to be
brought to the surface from the bottom of a lake and thus formed the earth. He
was the creator of man and animals, and taught them how to hunt, marry, and
procreate. In other tales, however, Old Man exhibits various trickster qualities
and often gets himself or someone else in trouble.
In trickster tales we see the good, the bad, and the ugliness of humanity.
We can relate to a culture hero–trickster who can do so much good; at the same
time, we know what it’s like to be selfish and a buffoon. Trickster tales are en
tertaining as well as enlightening and instructive. From Trickster we can learn
a lot about life and how to live it well.

TURTLE
The slow and plodding Turtle appears often in Native American stories, many
of which have been shaped by his ability to dig with his claws, retract into his
hard shell, and live both on land and in water. Because he is clumsy and at
times clownish, he is often ridiculed by others. In some cultures, however,

Turtle is respected as a powerful
shaman, guardian of spirit health,
or destroyer of monsters.
The following Seneca story il
lustrates their belief that Turtle is a
warrior:
There was once a turtle that
lived near a river. One day, feeling
lonesome, he decided to go on the
warpath. He got into a canoe and
started paddling up the river,
singing as he traveled along, “I am
on the warpath! I am on the
warpath!”
After going a short distance,
Deer came to the riverbank.
Calling out to Turtle, he asked him
to stop and told him that he
wanted to go with him. Turtle told
Deer that first he wanted to see
him run to the mountain and back.
He explained that they might be
defeated and need to run for their
lives to avoid being scalped and
killed. Deer ran to the mountain
and back in no time, but Turtle was
unwilling to take him because he
did not run fast enough.
Turtle set out again in his ca
noe, singing “I am on the warpath!
I am on the warpath!”
Soon Skunk came to the river and called out to Turtle. He wanted to go on
the warpath, too. Turtle paddled ashore and told Skunk he must see him run,
and that he could not take him along unless Skunk could run very fast. Turtle
told skunk to run to the second mountain. Skunk showed his strength as he
started out, so Turtle called him back and told him he could come along. The
two got into the canoe and set out, with Turtle singing, “I am on the warpath! I
am on the warpath!” Turtle commented on Skunk’s odor.
Soon Bear called to them and asked them to stop. He, too, wanted to go
along. Turtle landed and told him to run to the mountain. Bear started off and

soon returned. However, Turtle told him he was not fast enough and refused to
take him.
As they paddled along in their canoe, Hedgehog called to Turtle and Skunk.
He wanted to go on the warpath, too. Turtle told Hedgehog he could come along
if he was a good runner. He asked Hedgehog to run to the mountain. Hedgehog
turned and started to run, but his feet crossed and he stumbled, nearly rolling
over. He took only a few steps before Turtle said, “Stop! You’ll do. Come and
get into the canoe.”
The three set off, with Turtle singing, “We are on the warpath! We are on
the warpath!” Again, he commented on Skunk’s odor. Referring to Hedgehog’s
quills, he told him that he had many arrows.
Now it was Elk that called from the bank and asked to go on the warpath
with them. Turtle paddled ashore and told Elk to run to the second mountain
and back as quickly as he could. Elk set out and returned in a very short time,
smashing and breaking limbs, boughs, and bushes as he came. Turtle told Elk
he could not go and started off, singing as before.
Soon, Rattlesnake appeared on the bank, and called out to them, asking to
go along. Turtle told Rattlesnake he would only take along fast runners, ex
plaining that they may have to run for their lives. He told him to run to the sec
ond mountain. Rattlesnake rose up to go, and Turtle suddenly told him he was
welcome to come along.
So, the four started out, Turtle, Skunk, Hedgehog, and Rattlesnake, with
Turtle singing as before. Again, he made comments about Skunk’s odor and
Hedgehog’s arrows. He told Rattlesnake he had a black face.
The band of warriors decided to make war on the Seven Sisters, whose
home was not far away. When they reached their destination and pulled the ca
noe out of the water, Turtle told them to each choose the place best suited to
his fighting technique. Skunk chose the fireplace and said he would attack the
first person he saw. Hedgehog chose to hide near the house in a pile of wood,
and said he would attack the first person who came for it. Rattlesnake said he
would get into the skin bucket in which there was dried corn. Turtle chose to
station himself by the spring.
Early in the morning, the mother of the Seven Sisters went to build a fire.
Skunk attacked her and she fell back, unable to open her eyes. The Seven Sisters
heard their mother scream and ran to her. They began to fight with Skunk.
Eventually, they pounded Skunk with clubs and killed him. They threw him
outdoors and made a fire. One of the sisters went to the woodpile. Feeling a blow
on her arm, she saw that it was full of hedgehog quills. The girl started scream
ing and fighting with Hedgehog, and her sisters came to her rescue. Seeing

Hedgehog, they struck him on the head and back with pieces of wood until they
killed him.
One of the sisters then went to the skin bucket for dried corn for breakfast.
When she put her hand in, she felt a sharp blow. Seeing Rattlesnake, she called
to her sisters, who armed themselves with sticks and beat Rattlesnake until he
was dead. But the sister he had bitten was dead as well.
After some time passed, the mother of the girls sent one of her daughters to
the spring to get water. As she bent over to dip up the water, Turtle bit down on
her big toe and wouldn’t let go. She tried and tried to get him off but was unsuc
cessful, so she walked back to the house, dragging him along. When her mother
saw her daughter with Turtle attached to her toe, she became very angry, so an
gry she suggested that Turtle be thrown on the fire and burnt up. But Turtle
laughed and told the old woman that he could not be destroyed by fire, since he
came from fire and liked to be in it more than anywhere else. So she changed
her mind and decided to take him to the river to drown him. Turtle begged her
not to do it, and told her he would die. He begged hard, but it was no use. He
was taken to the river and thrown in. He sank to the bottom but soon rose to
the top in the middle of the stream. He held out his claws as if showing scalps
and laughed. He declared himself to be a brave warrior and told her that the
river was where he lived. Then he sank out of sight. See also Culture Hero(es)

TUTOKANULA, LEGEND OF
Yosemite Valley, California
Two little boys who once lived in the valley went for a swim in the river. After
splashing and frolicking in the water, they went ashore and climbed on top of a
huge boulder that stood by the bank. Tired from playing for so long, they fell
asleep. They slept so soundly that they did not realize the boulder grew and rose
by day and by night, until they were lifted up and out of sight of their people,
who searched for them everywhere. The rock continued to grow so high the

boys were lifted far up above the sky, until their faces scraped against the moon.
The boys continued to sleep among the clouds, year after year.
Then the animals held a great council to see who could bring the boys
down from the top of the rock. Every animal attempted to leap as high as it
could to no avail. Mouse could only jump as high as one’s hand, and Rat twice
that. Raccoon could make it only a little further. Grizzly Bear leaped quite high,
but fell back. Lion made an attempt, and he managed to jump higher than any
one else, but he also fell.
Then it was tiny Measuring Worm’s turn. He gradually began to creep up
the face of the rock, inch by inch. Eventually, he reached as high as all the other
animals had jumped and kept going. For one entire snow, Measuring Worm
climbed, until at last he reached the top. He awakened the boys and brought
them down to the ground safely. Thereafter, the rock was called Tutokanula,
the measuring worm. To the white man, it is known as El Capitan. References and further reading:

WHIRLWIND WOMAN
Arapaho, Arikara, Plains
There are myths among the people of the Northeast Woodlands that depict the
Whirlwind as a masculine figure, but stories about a female, Whirlwind
Woman, were told on the upper Plains. Whirlwinds were sometimes thought to
be ghosts.
All the people from a certain village were traveling west to hunt for buffalo.
At the back of the group was a woman with two small children, a girl and her
younger brother. As they crossed a stream, the children fell off the horse, but
their mother didn’t realize it until the people stopped to make camp. Some men
went back but could not find the children because the youngsters had walked
off in a different direction.
Eventually the children found a cave and the girl left her brother there while
she looked for food. But while she was gone a Whirlwind grabbed her and took
her away. She returned soon afterward, but from that day on the girl would leave
and be gone for days at a time. Upon her return, the girl was always very happy.
The boy soon was big enough to hunt for rabbits, and his sister brought him
a bow and some arrows. And then she left again. Sometime later, he told her
that he needed a bigger bow and more arrows, since he was becoming a good
hunter. The next time the sister returned, she brought just what he had asked
for. This pleased the boy very much. Each time before the girl returned, her
Handbook of Native American Mythology
216



brother would hear the sound of an approaching storm and then suddenly she
would come into view.
One day while the boy was hunting, an owl spoke to him. The owl told
him that the animals had taken pity on him because his sister had become a
whirlwind and was going around killing people. The owl told him that the
whirlwind would eventually try to kill him, too. It wasn’t long before the sister
returned. She threatened the owls that were hiding him and insisted that they
hand him over so she could kill her brother. Finally, at the owl’s coaxing, the
boy called out, “Sister, I promise that if you will leave me alone, I will give you
the first woman I marry.” That pleased the whirlwind, so she departed.
The boy, who was now a young man, traveled west and found his people.
His father recognized him and asked about his sister. The young man only said,
“She is traveling far away.” Then the young man asked to speak with the chief.
He told the chief that there were buffalo nearby. Hunters were sent out and
found them exactly where the young man had said they would be. Not long af
terward enemies attacked the camp. The courageous young man led the war
riors out and quickly defeated the enemy. The people were greatly impressed
with the young man, and the chief gave him his daughter to marry.
That night the young man called for his sister. When she came to his tipi,
he gave her the young woman who was to be his wife. In return, the Whirlwind
gave him gifts, including the power of the Whirlwind. She told him that he
would have power over his enemy and would not be defeated by them. Then
she said that the people should not be afraid of her any longer. They should pray
to her and she would hear them. And then she was gone just as quickly as she
arrived. In the days to come, the young man became famous as a courageous
and powerful warrior and eventually he became a chief of his people.

WHITE BUFFALO WOMAN
Teton (Lakota), Plains
Also called White Buffalo Cow Woman, White Buffalo Calf Woman, and White
Buffalo Calf Maiden, the holy White Buffalo Woman is the principal figure in the
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 217



Teton’s (Lakota’s) most important and enduring legend. According to belief, ap
proximately 2,000 years ago she brought the Teton people of the Black Hills the
sacred buffalo calf pipe that is central to their religious practices and foretold
several ceremonies in which the pipe was to be used. These ceremonies, known
as the Seven Sacred Rites of the Lakota, include the Sweat Lodge Ceremony, the
Vision Quest, Ghost Keeping Ceremony, the Sun Dance, Throwing of the Ball
Ceremony, the Making of Relatives, and Girls’ Puberty Rite.
Various versions of the story have been recorded. This version was told by
Teton medicine man John Fire Lame Deer.
One summer the seven sacred council fires of the Teton came together and
camped. There was no game and the people were starving, so two young men
went out to hunt. Along the way, they met a beautiful young woman dressed in
white buckskin. Because she was floating instead of walking, they knew she
was holy. One of the men desired her and reached out to touch her. This
woman was lila wakan, very sacred, and could not be treated with disrespect.
Lightning instantly struck the bold young man and burned him up, leaving only
a small heap of blackened bones. The White Buffalo Woman spoke to the other
man, who had behaved honorably, and told him to announce to his nation her
impending arrival.
This young hunter returned to the camp with the White Buffalo Woman’s
message. As she had instructed, a large tipi was built and the people waited.
After four days she approached and entered the tipi, walked in a sunrise (clock
wise) direction and stopped before the chief. She opened the wrapped bundle she
carried and presented the sacred pipe to the people. The pipe was decorated
with twelve eagle feathers, and on one side of the bowl was carved a bison calf,
on the other were seven circles of various sizes.
The White Buffalo Woman then gave the people sacred teachings. She ex
plained the meaning of the pipe itself and each of its components. She taught
the people how to use it to pray, with the appropriate words and gestures. She
explained that the seven circles stood for the seven ceremonies in which the
pipe should be used, and for the Ocheti Shakowin, the seven sacred campfires of
the Teton nation. She presented the first rite, the Ghost Keeping Ceremony, and
explained that the other six would be revealed in time.
Before leaving the tipi, the White Buffalo Woman told the people she would
return, walked again in a sunrise direction and left. Going in the same direction
from which she had come, she stopped and rolled over four times. The first
time, she turned into a black buffalo; the second into a brown one; the third
into a red one. Finally, the fourth time she rolled over, she turned into a white
female buffalo calf and then disappeared over the horizon. As soon as she had
vanished, buffalo in great herds appeared, allowing themselves to be killed so
Handbook of Native American Mythology
218



that the people might survive.
From that day on, the buffalo fur
nished the people with everything
they needed: meat for their food,
skins for their clothes and tipis,
bones for their many tools.
The prophecy of the White
Buffalo Woman’s return appeared to
be fulfilled by the appearance of a
female buffalo calf on August 20,
1994, on a farm near Janesville,
Wisconsin. Named Miracle, she was
considered to be the first white buf
falo calf (she is not albino) born
since 1933. Like the buffalo in the
story, she has changed color four
times. Another sacred white buffalo
calf, Wahos’i, was born on August
7, 2001, in Vanderbilt, Michigan.
And four white buffalo calves were
born on a ranch in Westhope, North
Dakota, between August 17 and
September 2, 2002.
Miracle’s birth focused the
world’s attention on the story of
the White Buffalo Woman and inspired modern interpretations of it. Some
Native American elders interpret her color changes as a representation of the
four colors of the human race. The White Buffalo Woman promised she would
return in time of need, but to whose need does the story refer? Because she was
born to owners who are not Native American, Teton elder Floyd Hand believes
that Miracle’s message of hope, renewal, and harmony applies to all people.
Some suggest that the birth of a female white buffalo calf symbolizes the evi
dent resurgence of Native American political, economic, and cultural strength. See also Culture Hero(es)

WHY STORIES
Siksika (Blackfeet), Cheyenne, Kiowa, Plains
Many myths from a variety of areas across North America can be classified as
Why Stories because they explain the reason for an event or for a geographical
or physical feature.
Frank B. Linderman collected numerous Why Stories during his years in
Montana with the Siksika people. Why Stories contained in Linderman’s publi
cations include: “Why Our Sight Fails with Age,” “Why Children Lose Their
Teeth,” “How the Skunk Helped the Coyote,” “Why the Dogs Howl at Night,”
“Why the Kingfisher Always Wears a War-Bonnet,” and “Why the Birch-Tree
Wears the Slashes in Its Bark.”
A Kiowa story explains “Why Dogs Do Not Speak.” One day the trickster
Saynday was traveling along and came to the dogs’ village. They were all mak
ing a lot of noise with each of them talking at the same time. Saynday asked
them to be quiet as he wanted to talk with them. But the father and mother
dogs and even their puppies just continued to talk. Again Saynday asked them
to be quiet, but to no avail. He began to get very annoyed with them, but that
just made the dogs talk even more.
Finally, Saynday gave them an ultimatum: “All of you be quiet or some
thing bad will happen.” Still the dogs kept on talking. This was more than
Saynday could take. He said, “You’ve had your warning. From this moment on
you will not be able to speak; you’ll only be able to growl and bark and yap.
Nobody will be able to understand what you are trying to say. You’ll only be
able to communicate with your eyes and your tails.” And so it has been ever
since that day.
The Cheyenne’s “Why the Turtle’s Shell Is Checked” is another example of
a Why Story.
The animals decided to go to war, so Turtle, Skunk, Porcupine, Grass
hopper, Snake, Cricket, and Willow all started off. They made camp the first
night, and on the following morning, Grasshopper had lost one of his legs and
had to return home. The others traveled on and then made camp that night. On
the following morning Cricket was singing under a bush and would not join the
others when they departed. That night they made camp again and on the fol
lowing morning, Snake went for a swim but would not come out of the water
when the others set out.

The four remaining companions continued on their way. That evening they
made camp near a stream. In the morning they found that Willow had waded in
and now was stuck fast in the mud. The other three had to leave him there and
continue on their way. Finally, Turtle, Skunk, and Porcupine arrived at the ene
mies’ village and waited until everyone was asleep. They crept into camp and
found the chief’s tipi. While the chief slept, they scalped him and cut off his head.
When the people found out what happened they were distraught. They
searched for tracks leading away from the village but could not find any. Then a
woman noticed that a large bowl was turned upside down and a wisp of smoke
coming from under it. She kicked the bowl over and found the three warriors
who were preparing their victory celebration. Everyone in the village came run
ning to see the three culprits, but Porcupine grabbed the chief’s scalp and ran
off. Skunk raised his tail and sprayed everyone. As the people backed away,
Skunk ran to catch up with Porcupine.
Turtle was too slow and was captured by the angry villagers. As they pon
dered what to do with him, Turtle retreated inside his shell. Occasionally he
would stick his head out and snap at the people, but this just made them even
angrier. Finally, they decided to burn him. They made a great pile of branches,
set it on fire, and then tossed Turtle into the flames. He kicked furiously and
got away from the burning branches, but not before his shell became cracked
and checked from the heat.
Again the people debated about what to do with Turtle. Eventually it was de
cided to toss him into the river. Turtle made a great noise with his protests but fi
nally said that he wanted to die like a man. He requested that two of the biggest
chiefs take him to the river. That is how it happened. Two large war chiefs
dragged him to the river and waded out into it. Suddenly Turtle grabbed the men
and drowned them both. The people tried to get to Turtle but they could not.
Turtle pulled the two dead chiefs to the opposite bank and scalped them.
Turtle returned to his village just as everyone was celebrating Skunk and
Porcupine’s return with the one scalp. Turtle quietly went to his sister’s tipi.
When she saw him, she was thrilled that he was still alive. She ran out to tell
everyone that her brother had returned with two enemy scalps, but Turtle an
grily called her back in.
Eventually, the word spread around the village that Turtle had returned
with two scalps. Skunk and Porcupine came to welcome him back and to let
him know that they were holding a victory dance in his honor. This pleased
Turtle. He went out to find his sister who was crying because of his harsh
words to her. “Cheer up, Sister! I went to war to bring you happiness. When the
enemies threw me into the fire, my shell became cracked and checked, but it
was all worth it. Now, get ready and go to the dance with these two scalps.”

WIND
Dakota (Sioux), Teton (Lakota), Plains
The story of Tate (the Wind) is part of the ancient and complex mythology of
the Dakota (Sioux) and Teton (Lakota) people. Inyan (the Rock) had no begin
ning. Inyan created Maka (the Earth) from a part of himself and gave her part of
his spirit. Skan (the Sky) was created from Inyan’s blood that was lost when he
created Maka. Skan became the foremost god and judge over all. Skan then cre
ated Wi (the Sun). In time, these gods created companions for themselves,
placed animals and vegetation on the earth and in the waters, and formed hu
mans. Skan created Tate (the Wind) as his companion and messenger.
Eventually, Tate took a beautiful but treacherous woman named Ite as his
wife. She bore four sons, Yata, Eya, Yanpa, and Okaga, and was pregnant with
another child, Yum, when she schemed against Skan. Her punishment was to
live on earth as a Double-Face. Besides her beautiful face, she was given a sec
ond, hideous one. People who saw her became insane or ran away in terror.
Tate, however, loved Ite and interceded for himself and his sons. Skan al
lowed them to remain on earth in order to live near Ite. Tate made his home at
the center of the world and instructed his four sons to establish the four direc
tions and to oversee the four seasons. He told them to travel to the edge of the
world and place the directions at equal distances from each other. When they
had accomplished this task, they would become spirits and messengers for the
gods. Tate warned his four sons to be wary of Iktomi, who would attempt to de
ceive and destroy them.
On their journey, they were helped at times by the wizard Wazi, who was
their maternal grandfather. At other times they were tricked by Spider into
abandoning their purpose. However, Wakinyan (the Thunderbird) sent his mes
senger, the swallow, to assist them and to get Tate’s sons back on track. With
Wazi’s help the brothers eventually reached the four points around the edge of
the world. At each of the points, one of the brothers set a marker to claim the
direction for himself. When their task was completed, the brothers returned to

year’s time was first measured.

WINDIGO
Ojibwa, Northeast Woodlands
These giant cannibals roamed the northeastern woods in the dead of winter and
devoured any humans they found. The only way to escape was for a person to
also turn into a windigo and fight the monster.
One day the kettles started moving over the fire. The villagers were all
frightened because they knew that a windigo was coming. A young girl who
lived with her grandmother asked the old woman why everyone was so ner
vous. The grandmother explained, “When the ice-hearted giant gets here, we
will all die.” The girl thought about the problem and then asked someone to
bring her some long sticks with the bark removed. Then she went back home
and waited.
Before long the air turned very cold. The people could hear the ice and the
trees cracking. The girl asked her grandmother to heat a kettle full of tallow.
When they looked outside, there was a windigo walking toward the village. He
was at least twenty or thirty feet tall, and as he walked the trees cracked and
the lake froze over.
Then the girl and her two dogs went out to meet the windigo, and her dogs
killed the windigo’s dog. As she walked along, she kept getting bigger and big
ger. Then she attacked the windigo with her sticks that had turned into copper
rods. She hit him hard and knocked him down. Then she hit him again and
killed him. Her grandmother gave her the hot tallow and as the girl drank it she
returned to normal size. The people from the village came out and hacked the
windigo to pieces. Inside they found a normal man. The villagers were so
pleased with the girl that they promised to give her anything she desired.
Another story tells of a man who was very gluttonous. He had four wives
and was a good hunter. But to get enough food for himself and all of his wives,
he had to go long distances in search of game. One day when he returned, he
told his wives that a man was coming to see him, but that he would be ready.
His wives understood him to mean that the visitor could turn himself into a
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 223



windigo. When they saw the visitor approach, the man went outside. The one
approaching yelled eight times and each time he yelled, he was bigger than the
last. Finally he was as tall as the trees. But the gluttonous man yelled ten times
and became bigger than the windigo. The two fought and beat each other with
trees that they ripped out of the ground. But finally the windigo was defeated.
When the man returned home, his wives gave him tallow they had melted and
he returned to normal size.

WISAKA
Fox, Sauk, Northeast Woodlands
Known by various names among people of the western Northeast Woodlands re
gion, this culture-hero taught the people how to live in harmony with his
grandmother, the Earth.
Long ago the orphan Wisaka was raised by his grandmother. At that time
there were giants on the earth (some say they were manitous, mighty spirits)
who became jealous and warred against Wisaka and his brother because the
boys had become so powerful. Only by deceit were their enemies able to get an
upper hand and kill the brother. During the four days of mourning, his brother’s
ghost came to the lodge. Wisaka refused to let him in, and instead told the
ghost that he must travel to the west and there he would find their mother.
From that time on, the brother was the guardian of the land of the dead.
Eventually Wisaka was victorious over his enemy, and while still a young man,
he began preparing the earth for the people he created. He brought fire to the
people to keep them warm. He discovered tobacco and shared its spiritual mys
teries with them. He taught the people and the animals many things he had
learned from his father, the Great Manitou, and his grandmother, the Earth, in
cluding many sacred ceremonies.
One time Wisaka was traveling and saw a buck with large antlers running
at him. Wisaka asked, “Where are you going?” The buck replied that he was
hungry and was hunting humans. So Wisaka told him to go on about his busi
ness. Wisaka continued on his way until he saw a grove of crabapple trees. He
filled his bag full of the fruit and slung it over his back. Then he stepped out of
Handbook of Native American Mythology
224



the woods. Not long afterward, the buck saw what he thought was a big, fat,
tasty human and ran after Wisaka. He bit into the bag and ended up with a
mouth full of the sour apples. The buck decided that he no longer cared for the
taste of humans. From that time on humans have hunted and enjoyed the taste
of deer.
Some time later, Wisaka was resting from his journey and all sorts of ani
mals came up to him. They wanted to know how they were supposed to live.
To the eagle, Wisaka said, “Little brother, you will eat birds and small animals,
but your feathers will be prized by men.” Wisaka continued to name the re
maining creatures and decide their natures. He told the fox that he would be
very quick and cunning but man would prize fox hides and tails for clothing and
ornaments. Wisaka told the turkey that men would seek him for his tasty meat
and use his feathers for decoration. The raccoon wanted to know if he would
have enemies. “Yes, the dog,” said Wisaka. So the raccoon attacked the dog, but
the dog struck back and sent the raccoon running up a tree. Wisaka told the
squirrel that he would make a tasty soup. The animals all wondered why hu
mans would want to eat them. At Wisaka’s command a nearby lake turned into
tallow. Then he dipped each animal into the tallow, but the mink jumped into
the lake before its turn, so Wisaka pulled him out and shook off all of the tal
low. That is why mink are never fat.
When Wisaka was finished fattening up the animals, he returned home and
told his grandmother what he had done. She was very pleased with his work.
Finally, Wisaka was very old. He had taught the people many things and
had been involved in many adventures. So he went into the north where he now
sits and keeps watch over men and animals. It is said that he will return some
day and make things as they were before.

WOMAN WHO FELL FROM THE SKY
Northeast Woodlands
There are various versions of this myth among the people of the Northeast
Woodlands. Among the Wyandot (Huron), the woman who fell from the sky
was called Ataensic (or Ataensie), and the Seneca called her Iagen’tci.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 225



Long ago the world was covered by water and there were people living in
the heavens. The chief’s daughter became ill, but the healers were unable to
cure her. One night a friend and adviser of the chief had a dream. He related his
dream to the chief when he awoke and the chief decided to follow the dream’s
instructions. So the people laid the young woman next to the great tree that
was the source of all of the corn the people ate. However, a stipulation in the
dream was that the tree had to be dug up and destroyed.
When they had finished digging the tree up, a young man came along and
said angrily, “It was wrong to destroy this tree that supplied us with food.”
Then the young man gave the girl a shove with his foot and she fell through the
hole in the ground where the tree used to stand. Two great birds saw her falling
through the air. They flew close together, swooped underneath her, and caught
her on their backs.
Eventually the birds became tired of carrying the young woman, so they
asked, “Who will care for her?” Turtle volunteered, but eventually he tired of
the task. Turtle asked for another volunteer. However, the animals and birds
who lived on and in the water decided that a permanent place was needed for
the woman. The plan called for mud to be brought up from the bottom of the
sea and spread out on Turtle’s back. As the mud was placed on Turtle’s back, it
began to expand in area until it was large enough to sustain the woman, vegeta
tion, and all creatures that were created soon afterward.
Eventually, the young woman’s condition improved and she built a shelter.
Some time later, she gave birth to a daughter and the child grew quickly. The
mother warned her daughter to always face the west when she dug for roots.
But in time the daughter showed signs of being pregnant. Her mother scolded
her for disobeying. The West Wind had blown up under the girl’s skirt while she
was digging with her face to the east and had caused her to conceive. The girl
was pregnant with twins, and before they were born, her sons argued about
which one of them should be born first and what was the best way to do it.
One twin wanted to be born in the manner that babies are born today. But
his twin had a rebellious nature and tore through his mother’s body and exited
under her armpit. She died soon after and her mother buried her. From the
daughter’s body grew the first food. Corn stalks grew from her breasts, beans
from her arms and legs, and squash vines grew out from her belly. Their grand
mother, the Woman Who Fell from the Sky, raised the boys and called one
Sapling and the other Flint. Right from the beginning she favored Sapling and
despised Flint because he had caused their mother’s death.
One day the grandmother had enough of Flint’s mischief and took him out
into the woods and left him in the hollow tree trunk. She doted on Sapling and
taught him how to hunt and fish. Often Sapling came home from hunting with

out his bow and arrows and his grandmother would have to make him new
ones. Finally, she asked him about it and he told her that the boy who lived in
the woods would steal them from him. The grandmother asked Sapling to take
her to the boy. When they found Flint, they brought him back to their home.
Sapling grew to be a good man who went about creating streams and lakes,
fish and game animals, and making the whole earth habitable for humans. Flint,
however, had a destructive nature. He was responsible for causing cold and icy
conditions, creating weeds, snakes, and insects. The brothers eventually argued
about each other’s creations. In the ensuing fight, Flint was killed. But it was
too late for Sapling to undo the evil his brother had created in the world.

WOODWORM
Haida, Northwest Coast
Hereditary family crests or emblems have been used in many cultures around
the world. In the Pacific Northwest region, crests often decorated household
items and clothing and were featured on great poles outside the houses of the
clan chiefs.
It was the custom for girls entering puberty to be kept in seclusion for a
time while they were being prepared for marriage. The only people they could
come in contact with were a few of their female family members. During this
time they were thought to possess great powers that could bring bad luck to
hunters and fishermen. This story about a young girl in seclusion who exhibits
great motherly love explains how a clan got its crest.
The daughter of a great chief began her period of seclusion and lived in the
far back corner of the house behind a wall. The girl could hear her friends play
ing outside and she knew she could no longer join in their childhood games. She
became very lonely.
One day while tending to her fire, a woodworm fell out of the wood. She
wrapped it in a blanket and it became her pet. The woodworm would not eat
anything she offered until finally she offered her breast and it drank heartily.
Her pet grew rapidly and she rocked it in her arms and sang it lullabies.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 227



However, when any of her attendants were near, she kept it hidden behind
boxes. Finally the woodworm grew to be so large that she had trouble keeping it
a secret. It no longer nursed, but raided the food storage pits under the chief’s
house. Then it tunneled from house to house, raiding food that had been stored
for the winter.
The people complained that some monster was stealing their food, but no
one ever saw it. One day, however, as the girl was singing a lullaby, her mother
peeked around the wall and saw her daughter rocking a huge worm. The mother
went out and told her husband. Then the chief and the girl’s uncle went in and
looked into her living quarters. There they saw the huge monster. Later the
chief called the people together to explain what was stealing all of their food.
Even though it was his daughter’s pet and companion, it had to be killed or it
would cause all of the people to starve.
The girl was invited to visit her uncle’s house. Her mother told her that her
time of seclusion was over and she could leave the house. She suspected that
her secret had been found out and feared for the pet that she now called her son.
But after much coaxing, the girl finally left the house. While she was gone, the
men of the village came with long, sharp spears and killed the woodworm.
When she saw that the woodworm was dead, she wept and accused the
people of killing her child. She was inconsolable and continually sang about her
child. The people were moved by her despair and her devotion to her son, and
honored him by burning his body on a huge fire, just as the girl had asked. She
continued to sing her sad songs and refused to eat or sleep. After a while the girl
died and her people moved from that place. However, because of her devotion to
her son and the special powers she must have had to be able to raise a small
woodworm into a giant monster, the people took the Woodworm as their crest. References and further reading:

California, collected and translated by Curtin, one of the foremost figures
in nineteenth-century American linguistics and ethnography. The stories
offer contemporary readers great insight into how Native Americans per
ceived and interpreted their natural world and its elements. Karl Kroeber,
Mellon Professor of the Humanities at Columbia University, has provided
an informative introduction. Curtin’s willingness to detail and condemn
mistreatment of Native Americans by white settlers and government offi
cials was unparalleled among other anthropologists and linguists of his
time, which contributed in part to his successful relations with Indians
and his ability to collect their stories.

Deloria, Philip J., and Neal Salisbury, eds. A Companion to American Indian
History. Malden, Mass.: Blackwell, 2002.
A collection of twenty-five essays written by leading Native American and
non-Native authors that brings an exciting and fresh perspective to the
study of Indian history and culture. Aimed at scholars, students, and gen

Scientific Fact. Golden, Colo.: Fulcrum, 1997. First published 1995 by Scribner.
A thought-provoking, sometimes bitingly humorous critique of modern sci
entific theories about evolution, creation, natural history, and population
movements in the Western Hemisphere as they relate to Native oral tradi
tions. Deloria, a preeminent Native American activist and author, chal
lenges the idea that these theories are more valid and truthful than facts pre

Mourning Dove. Coyote Stories. 1933. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press,
1990.
This collection of twenty-eight delightful stories is the result of Mourning
Dove’s tireless efforts to record the tales of her Okanagan people. Most fea
ture Coyote in his common roles as culture hero or bungling fool, but
other Animal People are the focus of the stories as well. Some explain why
mosquitoes bite people, why the marten’s face is wrinkled, how the turtle
got his tail, and more. It should be noted that Mourning Dove and her pri
mary editor, Heister Dean Guie, had divergent intentions for this book.
She wanted to emphasize Native American themes and issues, but Guie’s
desire to produce bedtime stories for children won out. Despite their di
luted authenticity, Mourning Dove’s tales as presented here represent an
important contribution to the preservation of Okanagan culture, and an ef
fort to convey aspects of that culture to a Euroamerican audience.
Mourning Dove is thought to have produced the first novel published by
an American Indian woman, Cogewea, the Halfblood (1927), the work for
which she is best known. Her final volume was her autobiography,
Mourning Dove: A Salishan Autobiography. Published posthumously in
1990, it has received much attention from scholars.

bals, giants, and other monsters. This work includes introductory material
regarding the collection of the narratives and how such oral (or written)
literature fits into the study of a given culture and particularly the study of
the Seneca and other Iroquoian people. Parker also included chapters on
literary themes and the discussion of how and when mythological stories
and legends were told and retold among the Seneca themselves.

Collected and retold by Teresa Pijoan. Little Rock, Ark: August House, 1992.
The thirty-seven myths in this collection feature both human and animal
characters that possess the spirit power to transform themselves into an
other form. This is not an alien concept for many Native Americans who
understand that the demarcation between the spirit world and the physical
world is not clearly defined. Indeed, many humans and animals have the
capability to transform from their natural state into that of the other and
back again if they so chose.
Ramsey, Jarold, ed. Coyote Was Going There: Indian Literature of the Oregon
Country. Compiled and edited by Jarold Ramsey. Seattle: University of
Washington Press, 1977.
The once prodigious body of ancient myths and stories of Native
Americans from Oregon, like the oral literature of other Indians of North
America, is now represented largely as remnants, at one time preserved
only in academic journals and monographs and scattered among library
collections of colleges and universities. Largely recorded by anthropolo
gists and linguists who dedicated themselves to transcribing this mytho
logical heritage as accurately as possible before it vanished without a
trace, it would remain less available to the public at large if not pub
lished in anthologies such as this one. The editor’s intent with this valu
able and careful compilation, minimally edited and arranged by geo
graphical area within the state, is “to make a representative selection of
accurately rendered Oregon Indian myths accessible to the general public
as literature.” He encourages the reader to delve into the original texts
identified in the notes and bibliography, to more clearly see how rich the
stories are despite great difficulties faced by translators in collecting
them, and by editors of Indian myth-literature in presenting them to a
modern audience.

from a region, and some are known over practically the entire continent.
While stories from the various tribes are different, they exhibit striking
similarities. Arrangement is by type of tale, not culture area, and they
may be grouped into three general categories: creation myths, trickster
tales, and stories of ordinary human beings entangled in the marvelous
or supernatural. A chapter entitled Comparative Notes presents distribu

and record as much of traditional Native American life as possible,
renowned still photographer Edward S. Curtis filmed this motion picture
documentary, originally titled In the Land of the Head-Hunters, at
Kwakiutl villages on Vancouver Island. Presenting an epic saga of love,
war, revenge, and death based on Kwakiutl legend and rituals, the story

features a wicked sorcerer, a hero, and their respective factions as they bat
tle for a woman. As part of Curtis’s effort to painstakingly reconstruct a
setting that reflects pre-contact authenticity, the film features not only the
magnificent painted war canoes of the title, but genuine native costumes,
ceremonial dancing, and religious ritual. Lost for many years, the film was
rediscovered, edited, restored, and enhanced by the addition of an authen

move west of white settlers, adventurers, and exploiters with the tragic
loss and suffering of Native Americans who were steadily dispossessed of
the lands they had inhabited for thousands of years. Interviews with more

Alcatraz Is Not an Island. Berkeley: University of California Extension Center
for Media and Independent Learning, 2002.
More than thirty years afterwards, this remarkable, award-winning, hour
long documentary combines archival footage and modern-day interviews
to provide an in-depth look at the historic and daring Indian occupation of
Alcatraz Island that lasted for nineteen months between 1969 and 1971.
Initiated by a small group of Native Americans to draw attention to the is
sues, concerns, and problems of the Bay Area Indian community, particu
larly those resulting from the government’s disastrous Relocation/
Termination Programs of the 1950s, this retaking of “Indian land” inspired
thousands of others to participate and soon escalated into a movement
that rippled throughout the United States and Canada. In retrospect, schol
ars, important leaders (both Indian and non-Indian), and the occupiers
themselves view this important political event as one that altered forever
the relationship between the American government and Indian Nations,
marked a renaissance in Native American culture and identity, and in
spired great pride and hope. Executive producer Millie Ketcheshawno, a
longtime Bay Area Indian community advocate, participated in the
Alcatraz occupation. Produced by Jon Plutte and directed by James Fortier
(Métis-Ojibwa), in association with the Independent Television Service
and KQED Television, and broadcast on PBS, Alcatraz Is Not an Island
was awarded Best Documentary Feature at the American Indian Film

Not a true series, but a collection of five one-hour documentaries first
shown on PBS between 1981 and 1990 and produced for PBS itself (e.g., as
a segment of the program Odyssey or The American Experience series), or

and the Apache Resistance, modern-day Chiricahua break a tradition of si
lence among members of the tribe and reveal their views of the long strug
gle in the Southwest between the Apache, settlers, and the Army during
the nineteenth century. In Myths and Moundbuilders, archaeologists ex
plore the contents of the huge earthworks and mounds of the eastern half
of the United States in an attempt to better understand the ancient
Hopewell and Mississippian cultures. Seasons of the Navajo presents a
year in the life of an extended family on a Southwestern reservation. The
Spirit of Crazy Horse surveys the current situation of the Oglala on the
reservation and documents their struggle to preserve their culture and her
itage and reclaim ownership of the Black Hills. Winds of Change: A
Matter of Promises, presented by Native American author N. Scott
Momaday, investigates the struggle of the Onondaga, Navajo, and Lummi
to maintain their cultural identity and national sovereignty in the United
States.

This video tells the dramatic story of the life and work of Edward Sheriff
Curtis (1868–1952), a noted ethnologist and pioneer in visual anthropol

works to portray traditional Native American culture. Featuring over
eighty tribes, this twenty-volume publication, which contains over 1,500
sepia-toned photogravure plates and narrative, each accompanied by over
700 portfolio plates, continues to influence greatly the image of Indians
in popular culture. Curtis’s enormous body of work includes a total of
40,000 photographs, 10,000 recordings, and a full-length ethnographic
motion picture, In the Land of the War Canoes. Native Americans who
are descended from Curtis’s subjects or who are currently using his pho
tographs for purposes of cultural preservation react to his pictures, tell
stories about the people who appear in them, and discuss the meaning of
the images. Originally produced as part of the PBS television program
American Masters, this 56-minute video is also issued in a longer ver
sion (85 minutes). Another excellent film profile of Curtis is The
Shadow Catcher (1975), directed by Teri McLuhan (New York: Mystic

happy and sad. Generally, clan members are not allowed to marry within
their own clan.
Columbia River The Columbia rises in southeast British Columbia and flows
south and west 1,210 miles through Washington State, along the
Washington/Oregon border, and into the Pacific Ocean. It was named after
the first ship to enter it in 1792.
Crest(s) A decorative emblem, badge, device, or other object, such as a totem
pole, regularly used as a symbol of a family, clan, tribe, or nation.

El Capitan A magnificent cliff of unbroken granite that rises vertically over
3,600 feet at the lower end of the seven-mile-long, glacially-gouged
Yosemite Valley, outstanding feature of California’s Yosemite National
Park. Native Americans have inhabited the region, rich in plant and animal
resources and more mild in climate than the surrounding high country, for
as long as 8,000 years. When non-Natives first entered the Valley in 1851,
about twenty-two villages of the Miwok were found here.

Etiological Myths Myths that explain the cause or origin of something, such
as a custom, natural feature, or state of affairs.
Frederick Island A small island located off the western coast of Graham
Island, one of the main islands of British Columbia’s Queen Charlotte
Islands archipelago.
Gaspe Peninsula A peninsula in southern Quebec, Canada, extending into the
Gulf of Saint Lawrence, about 150 miles long and from 60 to 90 miles wide.
Exquisite landscapes, seascapes, boreal forests, pristine mountain streams
and lakes, abundant wildlife, and some of North America’s oldest fossils
can be found here. The first documented Native Americans of the area to
make contact with Europeans were the Micmac, sometimes called The
Indians of the Sea, who were noted for their fishing skills and birch bark ca
noes that could traverse open water.
Ghost Keeping Ceremony (Wanagi Yuhapi) One of seven ceremonies, the
Seven Sacred Rites of the Lakota, brought to the Teton (Lakota) people of
the Black Hills by the White Buffalo Woman. Also known as the Keeping of
the Soul, this rite ensures that a person’s soul is returned to Wakan-Tanka,
the Creator, and does not wander about the earth. It also serves as a re
minder of death to the living.
Girls’ Puberty Rite (Ishna Ta Awi Cha Lowan) One of the Seven Sacred Rites
of the Lakota, promised to them by the White Buffalo Woman. Performed
after a young woman’s first menstrual period, this rite marked her transi
tion to womanhood and included instruction in the importance of fulfilling
her duties as a woman, mother, and wife.
Helldiver An aquatic bird of the grebe family. Known for their swimming and
diving abilities.
Kachina In Southwest cultures, powerful spirits of the dead in the form of
plants, birds, animals, and humans whose function is to bring rain and good
crops, and ensure the continuity of life. Kachinas also affect curing, fertil
ity, and growth. Kachinas are represented by either masked dancers who
personify these spirits or elaborately carved and decorated dolls.
Kiva The sacred ceremonial chambers of the Pueblo Indians, either circular or
rectangular in shape and sometimes built below ground or partly underground.
Used mostly by men, the kiva symbolizes the womb of Mother Earth from
which people are born and the underworld from which they first emerged.
Klamath River A river flowing from southern Oregon southwest across north
west California into the Pacific Ocean, about 250 miles.
Lehal A type of “guessing game” played principally by men and utilizing two
short bones, one of which had a sinew thread wrapped around the middle.
Players knelt in two rows, facing one another; each side had a set of the
Handbook of Native American Mythology
272



bones. Each side took turns passing their bones through their hands and
singing a lehal song; the other side was required to guess the hand of the
player that held the plain bone. The game was sometimes accompanied by
drums and/or the beating of sticks.
Making of Relatives, the (Hunkapi) Another of the Seven Sacred Rites of the
Lakota, foretold by the White Buffalo Woman. This rite established a bind
ing relationship among fellow human beings. Two people could become
brothers, sisters, brother and sister, mother and child, or father and child.
The ceremony lasted several days and included songs, prayers, purification,
offerings, and a feast.
Medicine Bundle A sacred object or collection of objects wrapped in a bundle
or contained in a bag of skin or cloth. The bundle may be owned by an indi
vidual, group, or tribe, and contain such items as animal and bird parts,
stones, herbs, feathers, and pipes. Each bundle has associations that are sig
nificant to the owner’s heritage, identity, or power, including rituals, sto
ries, songs, responsibilities, taboos, and/or specific powers.
Medicine Man/Woman An English term applied since the seventeenth cen
tury to many Native American religious leaders and healers. It is also used
to designate shamans, wise elders, priests, ritualists, and storytellers. Each
tribe has its own name for their medicine people and their role varies from
group to group. Much of their knowledge, which they are trained and em
powered to use, is considered sacred, remains secret, and is thought to be a
danger to others if they make contact with it.
Milky Way An assemblage of stars, dust, and interstellar gas that appears from
Earth as a broad, faintly luminous, milky band arching across the night sky.
The Milky Way moves through the sky just as the constellations do.
Motif A main element, idea, theme, or feature in a myth. A simple myth will
have several motifs; complex ones will have many. The clever trickster, the
transformation of an animal into a person, a flood or deluge, the origin of
death, and marriage to a star are all examples of motifs.
Narwhal A rarely-seen whale of the Arctic, known for the long, spiraling tusk
(actually a tooth) protruding from its mouth and possessed by the male,
which can grow to a length of ten feet. During the seventeenth century,
this tusk was thought to be the horn of the legendary unicorn, a belief rein
forced by the Vikings when they brought it to Europe. Its name means
“corpse whale” in Old Norse, a possible reference to its mottled grey color.
Northern Crown The Northern Hemisphere constellation Corona Borealis,
which lies between Hercules and the Herdsman (Boötes). The constellation
is a small arc of bright stars, and reaches its highest point in the evening
sky in early July.
Glossary 273



Okanogan Highlands The Okanogan Highlands, divided into two geographic
regions by the Columbia River, are located in the northeastern part of
Washington State, bordered by the Cascade Range on the west, and the
Columbia Basin in the south. The highlands extend into northern Idaho to
the east, and north into southern British Columbia. They are characterized
by rounded mountains with elevations up to 8,000 feet above sea level and
deep, narrow valleys.
Okipa A complex and elaborate ceremony of the Mandan of the Upper
Missouri region. Conducted annually and lasting four days, this sacred rit
ual enacted the creation of the world and the history of the Mandan people.
The Okipa was held to pray for plentiful buffalo, to prevent a repetition of a
catastrophic deluge, and to obtain other spiritual blessings. In 1832 artist
George Caitlin, highly esteemed for his drawings and paintings of Native
Americans, became one of the few white men ever permitted to observe the
Okipa almost in its entirety.
Palo Verde A spiny, multi-trunked deciduous tree common to the Southwest
and Mexico. The name—Spanish for “green wood” or “green stick”—refers
to its greenish branches and trunk. The two species found have either yel
low or blue flowers.
Pleiades Also known as “The Seven Sisters,” a cluster of seven stars in the
constellation Taurus, six of which are readily visible to the eye. The rising
and setting of the Pleiades was associated with planting seasons and the be
ginning of summer and winter among native cultures.
Point Barrow The northernmost point of Alaska, on the Arctic Ocean. Point
Barrow was named for Sir John Barrow, a promoter of Arctic exploration.
Saguaro cactus A very slow-growing giant cactus with a thick, spiny stem and
creamy-white flowers, native to the Southwest and Mexico. It is noted for
its capacity to store vast amounts of water. The flesh, seeds, and juice of its
green fruit was an important food source for Native Americans of the region.
Shaman(s) Men or women who act as intermediaries to the spirit world in or
der to diagnose and cure illnesses, foretell the future, seek lost objects, per
form rituals related to agriculture and hunting, or conduct the dead to the
other world. Shamans are particularly respected for their power to heal,
though they have often been suspected of being witches because of their
control of many powerful forces. Practices of a shaman can vary among
tribal groups.
Snake River A river in the northwestern U.S., flowing from Yellowstone
National Park into the Columbia River in Washington, 1,038 miles long.
Soup Dance The final event, an all-night dance, in the ceremonial year of the
Seminole, which begins in May and ends in September. The Soup Dance fol

lows three other ceremonies in the annual cycle. The men hunt while two
women ritually prepare soup from wild game for the dance. Both are served
to participants after the men return, and the Soup Dance continues through
out the night. It concludes with the performance of a Morning, or Drunken,
Dance, which refers to the excitement of the dancers, not inebriation.
Sun Dance A well-known and spectacular religious ceremony of Native North
America, conducted among the buffalo-hunters of the Great Plains region.
Variations exist in name, origin, purpose, and ritual elements among tribal
groups. Generally, the Sun Dance includes preparation of male pledgers by
instructors, prolonged fasting, sweat lodge purification, and dancing before
a sacred pole or tree. It is held annually to pray for fertility, plenty, and re
newal, to give thanks, to fulfill a vow, to protect from danger or illness, or
other religious purposes. Among the Teton (Lakota), a Sun Dance ceremony
(Wiwanyag Wachipi) is one of the Seven Sacred Rites of the Lakota foretold
by the White Buffalo Woman.
Sweat Lodge Ceremony A sacred rite, sometimes part of a larger religious cer
emony, by which purification is achieved with a sweat bath. The sweat
lodge itself is typically a small, dome-shaped structure constructed of
saplings and covered with hides, canvas, or blankets, between six and
twelve feet in diameter, that encloses heated stones on which water is
poured to generate steam. In addition to purifying the body, the ceremony
may be conducted as a medical treatment to cure or prevent illness by in
fluencing the spirits. As a social function, the ceremony serves as a
medium for the elderly to teach youth about culture, traditions, and knowl
edge of the tribe. Today, it is central to the religious beliefs and rites of
many groups of Native Americans across the continent. A Sweat Lodge
Ceremony, or Rite of Purification (Inipi) is one of the Seven Sacred Rites of
the Lakota foretold by the White Buffalo Woman.
Taboo A social prohibition or restriction resulting from convention or tradition.
Thlakalunka Another type of “guessing game” played using four square pieces
of deer hide placed upon a bear-skin laid down with the hair side up.
Participants formed two sides and one player moved a small pebble about
in his hands, pretending to put it under one of the pieces of deer hide. When
he thought he was able to hide the stone without observation, he placed it
beneath one of the pieces of hide. An opponent was given three chances to
guess where the pebble had been hidden; if correct, his side took possession
of the pebble. If he did not successfully guess where the pebble was after
three tries, another of his party tried his skill.
Throwing of the Ball, the (Tapa Wanka Yap) One of the Seven Sacred Rites of
the Lakota, foretold to the Teton (Lakota) people of the Black Hills by the
Glossary 275



White Buffalo Woman. During the ceremony, a young girl tossed a ball
made of buffalo hair and hide, painted to represent the universe, to four
teams assembled at the north, south, east, and west. Whoever caught the
ball offered it to the earth, sky, and four directions before returning it to the
girl. After the ball was thrown and caught in all directions, the girl tossed it
into the air for anyone to attempt to catch. The sacred rite itself was be
lieved to represent the stages of a person’s life; the ball, the universe of
knowledge. Attempts to catch the ball symbolized the struggle to break
free of ignorance.
Vision Quest The solitary, ritual seeking of wisdom and power from the spirit
world in the form of a vision. The rites vary from one tribal culture to an
other; differences include age, gender, length of time, and ritual elements.
Generally, one or more medicine people guide the individual in preparing
for the ritual. A vision quest may be undertaken in preparation for war or to
become a healer or shaman, to seek spiritual guidance, and/or to participate
in other ceremonies, such as a puberty rite. A Vision Quest ceremony, or
Crying for a Vision (Hanblecheyapi), is one of the Seven Sacred Rites of the
Lakota foretold by the White Buffalo Woman.
Wolverine A stocky, ferocious member of a large family of fur-bearing carni
vores that also includes the weasel, marten, polecat, and mink. The wolver
ine is found in the northern U.S., Canada, and northern Eurasia.
Zuni Salt Lake An inland salt lake located 60 miles south of the Zuni
Pueblo in New Mexico and home of the Zuni’s Salt Mother deity. The
layer of salt left on the lake bottom in the summer by evaporating water
is harvested by pilgrims, including medicine men coming from Zuni and
other neighboring tribes. The sacred Zuni Salt Lake sat at the heart of a
swirling controversy until very recently, and its future was in peril. Salt
River Project (SRP), an Arizona-based electric power company, had made
plans to operate a massive strip mine in New Mexico that would have ex
tracted over 80 million tons of coal from 18,000 acres of federal, state, and
private lands over a period of forty years. In addition to negatively im
pacting the immediate and surrounding environment, the mining would
have severely disturbed or destroyed sacred shrines, archaeological and
human burial sites, and places of worship actively used by seven Native
American tribes, including the Zuni Salt Lake. A proposed railroad that
would carry coal from the mine to the Coronado Generating Station in St.
John’s, Arizona, would have destroyed many sections of pilgrimage trails
and prevented access over those trails. Hydrological studies conducted,
except SRP’s own, revealed that SRP’s plans to pump 85 gallons of
Handbook of Native American Mythology
276



groundwater per minute for forty years from the same aquifer that feeds
the Zuni Salt Lake might greatly decrease the amount of both water and
salt available to it. After nearly two decades of opposition from the Zuni
Tribe, environmentalists, and concerned citizens, the SRP relinquished
their permits in August 2003.
