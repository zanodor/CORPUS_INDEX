Intaglio agate seal British Museum; conflicting interpretations reconciled with Indus Script hieroglyphs of metalwork, goldsmith workshop
Nicolo is a cameo or intaglio that is carved in onyx in such a way that the image displays a translucent bluish/grey color. A black or brown variety of onyx with a thin bluish-white vein, used esp. in cameos and intaglios (OED).
This characterisation is confuising when applied to the red agate seal which shows a Hindu divinity on a British Museum intaglio.

A more appropriate word to describe the agate seal is Intaglio which refers to (printmaking), a group of printmaking techniques, including engraving and etching.

Therefore, I use the word intaglio agate seal to describe the seal in the British Museum discussed by a number of scholars including: Nanditha Krishna, Subhash Kak, A Cunningham, Roman Mikhailovich Girshman, ADH Bivar.
The devotee in the Vishnu Nicolo (intaglio) Seal (detail).
Interpretations. The seal was first reported by Alexander Cunningham in The Numismatic Chonicle of 1893. Cunningham, saw in the devotee the Kushan ruler Huvishka,who reigned about 140-180 BC, based on the similarity of the headdress.
The head-dress on the intaglio agate seal is unique and varies from the head-dress of Huvishka shown on ancient coins.
I submit that the head-dress is a composition: 1. arch; 2. crucible; 3. ingot; these are Indus Script hieroglyphs: 1. maṇḍā 'raised platform, stool, arch' rebus: maṇḍā 'warehouse''
2. kuṭhāru 'crucible' rebus: kkuṭhāru 'armourer'; 3. gō ṭī ‘round pebble; Rebus 1: goṭa 'laterite (ferrite ore); Rebus 2:L. khoṭf ʻalloy, impurityʼ, °ṭā ʻalloyedʼ, awāṇ. khoṭā ʻforgedʼ; P. khoṭ m. ʻbase, alloyʼ M.khoṭā ʻalloyedʼ (CDIAL 3931) Rebus 3: kō ṭhī ] f (कोष्ट S) A granary, garner, storehouse, warehouse, treasury, factory, bank.
I submit that similar rebus Meluhha readings apply to the hieroglyphs associated with the divinity: څرخ ṯs

This is the monogram inscribed between the feet of the divinity and the feet of the worshipper. No reading has been suggested for this unique monogram, unique among IndoGreek coins.
hala 'plough' held by Sri Balarama.
I do not know if this monogram can be compared with the orthography of a plough shown on some Samkarsana Indo-Greek coins (pace Bopearachchi).
British Museum describes the inscription as "Bactrian", tansliterating it: " saso reo iastoo algo", translated as: "Sas-re the leader of worship".
Mitterwallner suggests identification of the divinity with Vasudeva ["Silk Road Art and
Archaeology: Journal of the Institute of Silk Road Studies, Kamakura"(Mitterwallner 1986: 10)"]
Roman Ghirshman proposed that the text on the seal was in the Kushan script and mentions three major Hindu gods:"Miarka Yasna Oezo" meaning:
"Mihira, Vishnu, Shiva"
— Text of the Nicolo (intaglio) seal.
Since there is no agreement on the script used on the intaglio seal, the variety of interpretations suggested by the scholars are reconciled using Indus Script hieroglyphs used on the intaglio.

My suggestion is consistent with the British Museum reading of the inscription on the agate ingaglio seal as Bactrian: "saso reo iastoo algo", translated as: "Sas-re the leader of worship". This reading will apply to any identification of the divinity and the worshipper finally agreed upon by scholars since the message is generic as a 'leader of worshipping pilgrims' in front of the four-armed divinity who may be identified as Vishnu with the associated hieroglyph of spoked wheel signifying arkasal 'goldsmith workshop'. śāṅkhika ʻ relating to a shell ʼ W. 2. *śāṅkhinī -- (śaṅkhinī -- f. ʻ mother -- of -- pearl ʼ Bālar.).

Thus, I suggest that the intaglio agate seal was held by the guild-master of the artisans engaged in jewelry and metalwork of the region served by the mint which issued this seal and other ancient coins.
The problems related to the association of the intaglio agate seal with Huvishka are best seen in the summary provided in the following thesis:
[quote]Kanishka was almost certainly succeeded by Huvishka, although historically there has been some confusion about this. The reason is that there are various rulers with seemingly contradictory dates. Kanishka's known dates are 1-23 plus there is another inscription (the socalled Ara insciption, named after the place where it was found) naming a king Kanishka son of Vajheska, dated 41. Beyond these, several more rulers are known with dates as follows:
Vajheshka, 20 Vasa Kushana, 22 Vasishka, 24-28 Huvishka, 28-62 Vasudeva, 68-98
There's a logjam in the '20s. And although there seems to be a neat transition in the year 28 from Vasishka to Huvishka, we see from the coin sequences that the coins of Vasishka clearly belong after those of Vasudeva. Plus the coins of Vasishka themselves seem to be preceded by another series naming another Kanishka (spelled Kaneshko on his coins), which also belong after the coins of Vasudeva. The solution, widely but not universally accepted, is that these dates pertain to two different centuries, with the second century (Kanishka era) dates simply dropping the first (hundreds) digit. In much the same way as we write '10 to represent 2010, ancient Indian scribes were also known to simply reduce dates to two digits by dropping the hundreds digit. This solution allows the logjam in the '20s to be eased up and to sequence the coins as well as the inscriptions in a logical manner. (There were paleographic and art-historical reasons also why the inscriptions belonged in a different sequence than might have been suggested by the two- digit dates alone.)



5
Vajheshka and Vasa Kushana are normally thought to be the same as Vasishka. Plus there appears to be another Vasudeva whose coins appear after those of Vasishka, and who perhaps relates to another inscription naming Vasu and dated 170). Finally, there are coins naming one Shaka, who is also mentioned in an inscription of the Gupta king Samudragupta in an inscription that must date after the year 320. The sequence of rulers we then get (with CE dates following. based on the Kanishka era starting in 127 CE) is: Kanishka I, 1-23 (127-150 CE) Huvishka, 28-62 (155-189 CE) Vasudeva I, 68-98 (195-225 CE) Kanishka II, (c. 100-120) (227-247 CE) Vasishka, 120-128 (247-255 CE) Kanishka III, 141 (268 CE) Vasudeva II, 170 (c. 275-297) Shaka, c. 325
Huvishka's coinage is vast and varied. He issued gold dinars and quarter dinars with many different obverse types and featuring many different deites on the reverses. Göbl identified 25 different obverse types for the gold coinage, although many of these are minor variations of one another and almost 90% of the gold dinars fall into one of the four broad types presented in the table below. This is based on the 643 gold dinars listed by Göbl. The gold coins also feature 25 different deities on the reverse. Of these, the most common are Ardochsho (18%), Mithra (17%), Nana (13%)< Pharro (13%) and Mao (12%). Other deities represented include: Ahura Mazda, Druvaspa, Herakles, Mahasena, Manaobago, Oachsho, Oaninda, Oesho, Rishti, Rion, Serapis, Shahrevar, Skanda-Kumara, Bizago, and Uma (Ommo).

According to Nanditha Krishna, this is a gem of Huvishka: "VISHNU / KRISHNA ON AN ENGRAVED GEM OF HUVISHKA (160-190 CE) Engraving on a nicolo (intaglio) seal (1.4 inch by 1.05 inch) published by Cunningham.

Subhash Kak describes it as Kushan or Kidarite seal, 4th or 5th century, inscribed in Bactrian and showing a king worshipping Vasudeva-Krishna.

recent research also identified the devotee, not with Huvishka, but with a Huna king; the seal also suggest that a composite cult of the three deities Surya (another name for Mihira, meaning "Sun"), Vishnu and Shiva was current in India circa 500 CE. However, the British Museum in 2019 gives a different reading of the inscription.

Vishnu Nicolo (intaglio) Seal
The Vishnu Nicolo Seal is a "finely engraved" oval agate seal from the far north of the Indian subcontinent, dated to the 4th century CE. Since 1892 it has been in the British Museum; the seal depicts a four-armed god Vishnu or Vāsudeva, being prayed by a royal devotee. Vishnu holds his classical attributes: the chakra discus, the wheel and the lotus. There is a monogram by the worshipper's feet; the British Museum describes the inscription as "Bactrian", tansliterating it: " saso reo iastoo algo", translated as: "Sas-re the leader of worship". It appears to have been found in what was the North-West Frontier Province of British India, now the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa of Pakistan, leading to the border with Afghanistan; the seal was first reported by Alexander Cunningham in The Numismatic Chonicle of 1893. Cunningham, saw in the devotee the Kushan ruler Huvishka, who reigned about 140-180 BC, based on the similarity of the headdress. More Roman Ghirshman proposed that the text on the seal was in the Kushan script and mentions three major Hindu gods: "Miarka Yasna Oezo" meaning:"Mihira, Shiva"

Vishnu Nicolo (intaglio) Seal representing Vishnu with a worshipper (probably Mihirakula), 4th–6th century CE. The inscription in cursive Bactrian reads: "Mihira, Vishnu and Shiva". British Museum. "The Hephthalites (or Ephthalites), also known as the White Huns and one of the four Huna people in Afghanistan, were a nomadic confederation in Central Asia during the late antiquity period. The White Huns established themselves in modern-day Afghanistan by the first half of the 5th century. Led by the Hun military leader Toramana, they overran the northern region of Pakistan and North India. Toramana's son Mihirakula, a Saivite Hindu, moved up to near Pataliputra to the east and Gwalior to central India. Hiuen Tsiang narrates Mihirakula's merciless persecution of Buddhists and destruction of monasteries, though the description is disputed as far as the authenticity is concerned.[67] The Huns were defeated by the Indian kings Yasodharman of Malwa and Narasimhagupta in the 6th century." (Hiuen Tsiang, Si-Yu-Ki, Buddhist Records of the Western World (tr. Samuel Beal), London, Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner & Co. Ltd, 1906, pp. 167–168).
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Afghanistan
According to the Encyclopaedia Iranica and Encyclopaedia of Islam, the Hephthalites possibly originated in what is today Afghanistan.G. Ambros/P.A. Andrews/L. Bazin/A. Gökalp/B. Flemming and others, "Turks", in Encyclopaedia of Islam, Online Edition 2006; A.D.H. Bivar, "Hephthalites", in Encyclopaedia Iranica, Online Edition.
":Around 510 C.E., a Hephthalite ruler Torama@náa established his power over much of northern and western India. He was succeeded in about 525 by his son, Mihirakula, whose ferocity and cruelty became legendary. The latter is mentioned in inscriptions of his fifteenth year at Gwalior and also at Mandasor. According to the last he was eventually defeated and captured by Yas‚odarman, and apparently succeeded by his uncle or brother (?) Hiranáyakula. However, he was finally released, and he re-established his power in Kashmir, where he survived until about 540 C. E. He is said to have derived entertainment from having elephants driven over the precipices there and listening to the squeals of the terrified animals as they fell. Succeeding rulers of the Hephthalite kingdom seem to have been based in Afghanistan, though whether in Kabul, Bamiyan (Ba@mia@n), Gardez, or, most probably, Ghazni, is uncertain. From the coin series, and brief notices in the Kashmir chronicle Ra@jataranμginá^ (which seems, however, to be affected by some chronological disarrangement), we learn of other rulers, Lakhana Udaya@ditya and Khinμgala Narendra@ditya, and the latest king, known only by his honorific title Purva@ditya, whose demise could have taken place shortly before 600 C.E. The epoch of the Hephthalites seems to have seen a striking revival of accomplished sculpture in Afghanistan, this time using marble, and with a preference for Brahmanical subjects. A marble image of the Hindu deity Ganáes‚a, reputedly found at Gardez, was dated in the eighth year of Khinágala (Sarcar,



12
1963). It is linked to the horrific painting of a Hephthalite king at the cave of the 53-meter Buddha in Bamiyan by the fact that in the painting the adjoining figure of a prince wears a jewel in the form of a bull's head, seen also on marble sculptures related to the Ganáesa...The newly-discovered Bactrian documents studied by Sims-Williams (1997, 2001) throw interesting light on Afghanistan during the Kushano-Sasanian and Hephthalite periods, containing references to a tax collected specially as tribute for the Hephthalites (SimsWilliams, 1997, No. 16). Under them, a surprisingly orderly administration is shown to have been carried on, thereby substantiating the report of Procopius above. These documents make clear that the Middle Iranian Bactrian language written in Greek script was not the native idiom of the Hephthalites, as some have claimed, but the traditional language of administration in this region from Kushan times and possibly earlier. There is, as mentioned above, some evidence of the use of Turkish language under the Hephthalites. The name Mihirakula possibly represents a Sanskritization of a Turkish designation mihr-qul "slave of Mithra," a familiar theophoric formation. The Bactrian documents also attest several Turkish royal titles, though these could also be explained by later Turkish infiltration south of the Oxus."
