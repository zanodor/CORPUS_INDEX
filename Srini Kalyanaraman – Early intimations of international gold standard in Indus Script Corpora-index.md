Gold from Kolar used in Harappan or Sarasvati-Sindhu Civilization was electrum, gold-silver compound. H-1997 tablet shows a rectangle cartouche with 24 pellets (or two twelves). arka ‘twelve’ rebus: arka ‘copper, crystal’ (Monier-Williams). Is the measure of gold purity in 24-karat derived from Indus Script Corpora. Yes, is the answer evidenced in this excursus. Middle French carat, English. 24karaṭa derive from Meluhha etyma करडा karaḍā ‘hard alloy’ karaṭa ‘hardness’. करड्याची karaḍyācī, अवटी avaṭī f
An implement of the goldsmith. A stamp for forming the bars or raised lines called करडा. These are the 12 notches shown in Sign 121 arka ‘twelve’ rebus: akasala ‘goldsmith’; खाांडा khāṇḍā A jag, notch, or indentation (as upon the edge of a tool' Rebus: khaṇḍa 'equipment’. The implement used to form raised lines is signified by Sign 176 khareḍo = a currycomb (Gujarati) खरारा [ kharārā ] m ( H) A currycomb Rebus: karaḍā खरडें 'daybook', ‘hard alloy’. Thus, Sign 176 is a signifier



daybook of the hardness of the cartouch 24 notches which signify the finest quality gold, alloy (which could still have some other metals). Two twelves: dula ‘two’ rebus: dul ‘metalcaasting’. Thus, 24 notches or dots signify metalcast equipment (perhaps using cire perdue technique). The bisons signify मुष्टिकः muṣṭikaḥ [मुष्टिमोषणां प्रयोजनमस्य कन्] 1 A goldsmith rebus: muṭṭi ‘butting (bisons)’
A touchstone is a small tablet of dark stone such as slate or lydite, used for assaying precious metal alloys. It has a finely grained surface on which soft metals leave a visible trace. The touchstone was used during the Harappa period of the Indus Valley civilization ca. 2600–1900 BC for testing the purity of soft metals. It was also used in Ancient Greece.(Venable, Shannon L. (2011). Gold: A Cultural Encyclopedia. Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, LLC. p. 264. Bisht, R. S. (1982). "Excavations at Banawali: 1974–77". In Possehl, Gregory L. (ed.). Harappan Civilization: A Contemporary Perspective. New Delhi: Oxford and IBH Publishing Co. pp. 113–124). Drawing a line with gold on a touchstone will leave a visible trace. Because different alloys of gold have different colours (see gold), the unknown sample can be compared to samples of known purity. This method has been used since ancient times. Such drawing of lines by goldsmith assayer is called karaṭa hard, hardness; mfn. dark-red, VarBṛS. 61, 2 ; 6 (MonierWilliams) करडा karaḍā a Iron-gray. By the colour of the line seen by the assayer, he or she judges the fineness of gold. I suggest that word karat or carat is derived from this Meluhha etymon करडा karaḍā which also signifies the hardness of the alloy and the touchstone line colour which may range from iron-gray to dark red, depending upon the ratio of gold in the alloy metal which may also contain silver or copper. Arka ‘copper’ ಅಕಸಾಲ aka2-sāla. = ಅಕಕ ಸಾಲ, ಅಗಸಾಲ a gold or silver smith. Electrum is a naturally occurring alloy of gold and silver, with trace amounts of copper and other metals. Its color ranges from pale to bright yellow, depending on the proportions of gold and silver. It has been produced artificially, and is also known as "green gold". Electrum was used as early as the third millennium BC in Old Kingdom of Egypt, sometimes as an exterior coating to the pyramidions atop ancient Egyptian pyramids and obelisks. It was also used in the making of



ancient drinking vessels. The first known metal coins made were of electrum, dating back to the end of the 7th century or the beginning of the 6th century BCE (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrum)
Colour of metallic gold assayed using
touchstone lines which produce lines of
colour depending upon the gold content of the
metal alloy signified by Sign 59 of Indus Script
Corpora: ayo ’fish’; rebus: ayas ‘alloymetal’ (RV)
Representation of the color metallic gold (the color traditionally known as gold) which is a simulation of the color of the actual metallic element gold itself—gold shade.
Oldest golden artifacts in the world (4600 BC 4200 BC) from Varna necropolis, Bulgaria grave offerings on exposition in Varna Museum.
An Indian tribute-bearer at Apadana, from the Achaemenid satrapy of Hindush, carrying gold on a yoke, circa 500 BCE.
Whereas most metals are gray or silvery white, gold is slightly reddish-yellow.[21] This color is determined by the frequency of plasma oscillations among the metal's valence electrons, in the ultraviolet range for most metals but in the visible range for gold due to relativistic effects affecting the orbitals around gold atoms. Similar effects impart a golden hue to metallic caesium.



Common colored gold alloys include the distinctive eighteenkarat rose gold created by the addition of copper. Alloys
containing palladium or nickel are also important in commercial jewelry as these produce white gold alloys. Fourteen-karat goldcopper alloy is nearly identical in color to certain bronze alloys, and both may be used to produce police and other badges. Fourteenand eighteen-karat gold alloys with silver alone appear greenishyellow and are referred to as green gold. Blue gold can be made by alloying with iron, and purple gold can be made by alloying with aluminium. Less commonly, addition of manganese, indium, and other elements can produce more unusual colors of gold for various applications. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold#Color

gold’. Lydia coin signifies the contest between Electrum gold signified by unicorn and the siṃhala + svarṇa gold signified by the lion. These are the roots of the emerging gold standard of 24-carat or 24-karat across the globe.
In the middle of the sixth century BCE, the Lydians were producing
pure gold coins such as the renowned electrum coin with a design on
one side and punch marks on the other. The refining techniques
used by the Lydians are described in fascinating detail in the book
Croesus Stater based on excavations at Sardis.

Karat, a measure of the purity of gold. 24 Carat Gold or 24 Karat Gold may refer to the purest gold.
The karat (US spelling, symbol k or Kt) or carat (UK spelling, symbol c or Ct)[15][16] is a fractional measure of purity for gold alloys, in parts fine per 24 parts whole. The karat system is a standard adopted by US federal law.
Mass K = 24 × Mg / Mm
where
K is the karat rating of the material,
Mg is the mass of pure gold in the alloy, and
Mm is the total mass of the material.
24-karat gold is pure (while 100% purity is unattainable, this designation is permitted in commerce for 99.95% purity), 18-karat gold is 18 parts gold, 6 parts another metal (forming an alloy with 75% gold), 12-karat gold is 12 parts gold (12 parts another metal), and so forth. In England, the carat was divisible into four grains, and the grain was divisible into four quarts. For example, a gold alloy of 127⁄128 fineness (that is, 99.2% purity) could have been described as being 23-karat, 3-grain, 1-quart gold.



However, this system of calculation gives only the mass of pure gold contained in an alloy. The term 18-karat gold means that the alloy's mass consists of 75% of gold and 25% of other metals. The quantity of gold by volume in a less-than-24-karat gold alloy differs according to the alloys used. For example, knowing that standard 18-karat yellow gold consists of 75% gold, 12.5% silver and the remaining 12.5% of copper (all by mass), the volume of pure gold in this alloy will be 60% since gold is much denser than the other metals used: 19.32 g/cm
3
for gold, 10.49 g/cm
3
for silver and 8.96 g/cm
3
for copper.
This formula gives the amount of gold in cubic centimeters or in milliliters in an alloy:
where
V
Au
is the volume of gold in cubic centimeters or in milliliters
M
a
is the total mass of the alloy in grams
kt is the karat purity of the alloy
To have the percentage of the volume of gold in an alloy, divide the volume of gold in cubic centimeters or in milliliters by the total volume of the alloy in cubic centimeters or in milliliters.
For 10-carat gold, the gold volume in the alloy represents about 26% of the total volume for standard yellow gold.
Karat is a variant of carat. First attested in English in the mid-15th century, the word carat came from Middle French carat, in turn derived either from Italian carato or Medieval Latin carratus. These were borrowed into Medieval Europe from the Arabic qīrāṭ meaning "fruit of the carob tree", also "weight of 5 grains", ( قيراط ) and was a unit of mass though it was probably not used to measure gold in classical times. The Arabic term ultimately originates from the Greek kerátion (κεράτιον) meaning carob seed (literally "small horn") (diminutive of κέρας – kéras, "horn".



In 309 CE, Roman Emperor Constantine I began to mint a new gold coin solidus that was 1⁄72 of a libra (Roman pound) of gold[24] equal to a mass of 24 siliquae, where each siliqua (or carat) was 1⁄1728 of a libra. This is believed to be the origin of the value of the karat (Turnbull, L. A.; Santamaria, L.; Martorell, T.; Rallo, J.; Hector, A. (2006). "Seed size variability: From carob to carats". Biology Letters. 2 (3): 397–400)
Carob (Ceratonia siliqua) pod and seeds, origin of karat via Arabic qīrāṭ which itself comes from the Greek word for the seed kerátion.
A piece of alloy metal containing a precious metal may also have the weight of its precious component referred to as its "fine weight". For example, 1 troy ounce of 18 karat gold (which is 75% gold) may be said to have a fine weight of 0.75 troy ounces.
