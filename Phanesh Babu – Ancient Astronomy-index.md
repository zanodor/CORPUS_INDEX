ANCIENT ASTRONOMY THROUGH THE AGES WITH REFERENCE TO MEGALITHIC MONUMENTS IN TELANGANA
Dr. P. Phanesh Babu Assistant Professor Department of History School of Social and Behavioural Science Central University of Karnataka, Kalaburagi Karnataka
Astronomy is the oldest subject when compared to the other science subjects. Even before the invention of script, ancient man started recording the observational knowledge of the heavenly changes, the rising and setting of the Sun, its annual northward and southward movements in the sky, the phases of the Moon, the motions of the other wanderers relative to the background of the fixed stars, the diurnal movements of the stars, and the changing face of the sky throughout the year, etc., In by putting impressions on stone (carving) and painting in caves. From the very early times, men sought to explain these phenomena and to be able to predict the positions of these heavenly wonders. The first ideas about the structure of the universe gradually took shape, with the earth fixed and immovable at its center and everything else rotating around it in a small compact universe, with the stars in outer sphere, just beyond the orbit of Saturn, most distant from the known planets.
The striking spectacles presented to mankind by the varied appearances of a sky, covered with thousands of shining objects of different degrees of brightness, all apparently revolving around the earth; the changing phases of the moon; the bright morning and evening stars; comets and shooting stars; and the surprising phenomena of eclipses of the Sun and the Moon, have, from the very earliest times, raised feelings of admiration and often of superstitious alarm.
Even the most primitive of peoples must have found it desirable to take note of the configurations and movements of the stars and the Sun and the Moon, the two latter objects being obviously very closely connected with the subsistence and the wellbeing of the human race. And the stars were found to be guides for the travelers by land or sea, while the fixing of the changes of the seasons, so essential to the farmers, was at a later date found to be possible by means of the times of their rising and setting throughout the year. Mankind had to relate all activities to the daily alterations of light and darkness, and to the daily and seasonal alterations of warmth and cold, and soon saw that these were due to the

varying power of the sun; while a marked variation of night illumination and the tides in the sea followed the changes of the Moon.
Astronomical ideas
Some encouragement for the study of astronomy resulted also from an idea, which seems strange to most modern minds, that the configurations and the movements of the celestial bodies affected human destinies and were “signs in the heavens” from which future events could be foretold. If a comet appeared or an eclipse occurred at the time of the death of a great king or national leader, or when, simultaneously with a remarkable celestial event, some plague, flood or drought afflicted the people, these skies and earth happenings were apt to be regarded as causes and effects. And it was thought that, as the annual course of the sun in the sky produced so great results on the earth’s animal and vegetable products, the planets in their movements among the stars and their resulting configurations, influence the events of human lives. As a consequence, the appearance of comets, new stars, meteor showers, eclipses, remarkable conjunctions of the planets which take place when they are next to each other, passing on their paths in the sky and celestial phenomena generally, were noted by the more contemplative members of human society and carefully recorded along with events.
Earliest discoveries
The order of discovery of some of the fundamental facts of science may be briefly sketched as follows. The first phenomena to be noted would be the regular periodic dawn, sunrise, daylight, sunset, twilight and night. Next to the measure of a day, thus provided, the month would be instituted as related to the variety of light with the moon’s phases. In the temperate regions, where perhaps the first astronomical observations were systematically made, the changing length of the day, or the direction of the sun at rising or setting, or the lengths of shadows cast at midday, would show that the sun’s daily path in the sky changed throughout the year, a time interval which was already marked by the changing vegetation. According to Sir W.C. Dampier “attempts were made to determine the number of months in China soon after. About 2000 B.C., the Babylonian year settled down to one of 360 days or twelve months, the necessary adjustments being made from time to time by the interposition of extra months”. But the discovery of a more precise length of the seasons and of the year was the work of a more intelligent and specialized class of men than the primitive husbandman or herdsman. This class was the priesthood or its equivalent, considerable authority being thus acquired over the ordinary tribesman. Before long, it would be found that there are not an exact number of months in the year or days in the month and it would become necessary to make careful night

observations of the moon and stars to obtain greater correctness. The suitability of the stars for measurement of dates would not be immediately obvious to these earliest observers. A considerable period might well elapse before it would be noticed that, in a particular season of the year, the same stars are seen at corresponding hours of the night, this circumstance being less conspicuous than the regular variation of the Sun’s altitude in the sky as the year progresses. It is, however, thought probable that the striking naked-eye cluster, the Pleiades, which must have been one of the earliest noted star groups, was the object which provided the first fairly close determination of the length of the year as roughly 365 days. The rising of this cluster in the evening was a mark of the coming of winter of primitive man and the husbandman or headman judged the time of reaping by its rising and of ploughing by its setting in very ancient times. Sirius, Arcturus, the Hyades, and Orion were similarly useful to him.
The Zodiac
It was eventually noted that the Sun and the Moon travel over very similar paths among the stars during their path of the sky. This led to the formation of the zodiac and its constellations, the center of this zone, a belt about 160 broad, being the annual path of the Sun or the ecliptic. The division into twelve parts, each corresponding to a month of the solar course during the year, was found by observations of heliacal risings or settings. These were the times of the year when certain bright stars would first be seen to rise before the Sun, or when they were last seen to set after sunset. In the case of Sirius, the brightest fixed star, these would happen when the Sun was about ten degrees below the horizon. For less bright stars, the angle would be a larger one.
But it seems likely that before this division had been effected, it would be found that the Moon, in going like the Sun round the heavens, always in the same direction from west to east (opposite to the diurnal motion which she shares with the other bodies), kept, in general, to the same track in the sky. After a time, however, it would be noted by careful observers that this path was not constant, but deviated from the center line of the Zodiac, getting away from that line up to a maximum deviation on either side, but slowly returning to it. In the course of a number of years this became evident that the Moon’s path among the stars does not lie always in the same line on the celestial sphere, but in a zone or band about twenty moon breadths (100) wide, occupying the middle of the zodiacal zone itself.
In both astrology and historical astronomy, the Zodiac is a circle of twelve 30° division of celestial longitude that are centred upon the ecliptic: the apparent path of the sun across the celestial sphere over the course of the year. Historically,

these twelve divisions are called signs; the zodiac was in use by the Roman era, based on concepts inherited by Hellenistic astronomy from Babylonian astronomy of the Chaldean period (1st millennium B.C). The Hindu zodiac uses the sidereal coordinate system, which makes reference to the fixed stars. The Tropical Zodiac is divided by the intersections of the ecliptic and equator, which shifts in relation to the backdrop of fixed stars at a rate of 1° every 72 years, creating the phenomenon known as precession of the equinoxes, the following list of the twelve signs of the modern Zodiac ecliptic longitudes of their first points, where 0° Aries is understood as the vernal equinox.

The formation of the constellations
Long before the zodiacal belt was divided into signs, which according to some authorities took place about 700 B.C., when the intersection of the Ecliptic with the celestial Equator was in the constellation of Aries (the Ram), a number of asterisms, or configuration of stars in the sky, had been arranged. The brighter stars of these configurations thus identified proved very useful in indicating the seasons of the year by their times of rising or setting and also in locating the positions on the celestial vault of such moving objects as planets, comets and shooting stars and in helping the traveller by land or sea to determine direction. These named constellations date back to a very early period except for some (chiefly situated in southern skies), which have been added in modern times. In many, the stars form a well-marked group, clearly separated from other groups, and the names given to these formations are supposed to have been suggested by a resemblance to the shapes of certain familiar objects. The resemblance is usually very slight and this may justify the suspicion that often some fancied figure was first thought of, and then the stars chosen to represent it in that very fashion. The similarity of the constellations as recognized early in different countries is remarkably great and this points to a common origin for them.
The late Dr. A.C.D. Crommelin considered that there is reason to believe that the stars may have been grouped to some extent by the Egyptians as early as 4000 B.C. and he remarked on their use of the then Pole star for orienting the Great Pyramid. And if their ancient records can be relied upon, the Chinese can be taken to have mapped out the sky into many divisions of stars by 2500 B.C. on a system very different, however, from that devised by the early astronomers elsewhere.
But it has been shown that the constellations are, for most part, perhaps even older than that date. Forty-eight of them have come down from particularly ancient times, but these do not cover the complete extent of the sky. The part not occupied by any of them, evidently, did not rise above the horizon, where the early astronomers, to whom we owe their naming, lived and the stars concerned were, therefore, not included in their constellation scheme. The centre of this part (near the bright star Achernar), must have been near the South Pole of the heavens of the time and its angular radius from the Pole gives us approximately the latitude of their homes. The date appears to have been about 2800 B.C. when, owing to the precession of the equinoxes, the south celestial pole was in the position indicated. The latitude seems to have been about 380 north. These are the findings of E.W. Maunder1, but by the same method the somewhat later date

of 2460 B.C. and a latitude of 360 north has been deduced by Dr. Crommenlin, and R.A. Proctor. Maunder also suggested that the presence of the Lion and the Bear among the stellar configurations and the absence of the Elephant, Tiger, Camel and Crocodile seem to exclude India towards the east and countries towards the west, the latitude and longitude indicated being those of Asia Minor or Armenia. The suggestion that blank area in the sky referred to give an approximate date for the formation of the constellations looks to have been first put forward in 1807 by Carl Schwartz, for some time Swedish Consul at Baku.
The Illusion of Zodiac and Constellation
Primitive man might have started making cup marks, paintings, rock carvings as a means of noting the things that he has observed or done, such as hunting, seasonal changes, birds, animals and his own images, which might have been the driving force.
The impressions on stone start from the primitive culture, depicting through cup marks, rock carvings, paintings, etc, what the primitive man observed in everyday life, what happened, where he started his journey, where he is going, what he saw, observation of heavenly bodies, etc. The cup marks might also have been their way of putting some identification marks.

These types of cup marks were also found in Mudumala sites. Here the main discussion is how these people have marked on a stone in a symbolic way. The cup marks are impressions as Ursa major that is also called as big bear (see picture below) the stone installed as a dressed stone and not like other megalithic stones, as generally the megalithic stone were as undressed. The megalithic man made some impressions on the stones with the knowledge of astronomy, above pictures depict the cup marks on the stone and it gives the idea of megalithic people and how they saw the heavenly bodies with naked eyes. In the picture given below, the top left side of the stone is with cup marks, while the right finding cup marks are on the same stone. Below left, the digitized map is given finding the cup marks, its comparison with North Star (Polaris), which is also called as Ursa Major. In the same stone there are some more cup marks which might be other identification marks for constellations (see constellation chart) or Planets movements.
The picture also depicts that the cup mark stone and Gudabellore hills are in North orientations. We can see that these two points are on the same longitude, the gap between these two being 7 km. with the Gudabellore hills being clearly visible. Here, the main discussion is whether they took any direction from the hill or was it a natural installation of cup marked stone. For an alignment of a straight line, we take three points, one starting; the other is direction and the third one for alignment. See following picture.
The Gudabellore hill is located in 90° north orientation, for observation of North Pole (Pole Star) and any other star, megalithic people might have installed the cup mark stone in that direction. The cup mark stone located on the banks of river Krishna, on the northern side, just a kilometre from the river base, with 350 mts of elevation from the sea level, and on the other side, Gudabellore hill, is located at 7 km of north from the Cup mark stone, elevated on 430 mts from sea level (google image).

In the chart given below are the various constellations that can be seen in one year. Some of the constellations appear immediately after the setting of the Sun, while some of them appear before the sun rises, where we have planets like morning star and the evening star. If we observe the cup marks at Mudumala site impressions they have followed not only one pole star, but it follows many constellations.
