पशु--समाम्नाय m. "enumeration of यष्टृ yaṣṭṛ, worshipper animals" in the Veda texts include:
Goat, sheep Ox Horse Dog Ass, mule
Camel
Winged creatures (hamsa, suparṇa, śakuna Amphibian śimsumāra, ‘alligator’, ajagara ‘crocodile’
Fish
Fish (purikāya, jaṣa, matsya) Worms (rājasah)
I submit that यष्टृ yaṣṭṛ which signify posts and animals tied to them signify performers of yajña,
that is, those desirous of obtaining the riches and wealth signified by the animals. It will be a gross error and mis-representation to frame the metaphor as 'sacrificial victims' as often mentionedin western idioms and explanations of Veda texts. We have seen that the Yupa, 'post' signifies an aśva 'horse' in aśvamedha which is a yajna, for acquisition of sovereignty (and related shared wealth). The following Veda texts relate to the post as a signifier of aśva 'horse'; the references are simply metaphorical and DO NOT involve the killing of the horse orr any other animal tied to posts. Animals tied to the posts are also signifiers of specific categories of wealth resources as enunciated in hundreds of Indus Script inscriptions detailed in this monograph.

IN RV 1.162 metaphor, for example, चषालं ये अश्वयूपाय तक्षतत Rv.1.162.6: caṣālḥ चषालः 1 A wooden ring on the top of a sacrificial post; चषालं ये अश्वयूपाय तक्षतत Rv.1.162.6; चषालयूपतन्नच्छो तिरण्यरशनं तिभुः Bhāg.4.19.19. -2 An iron ring at the base of the post. This post with the wheat chaff ring constitutes the pillar of fire when aflame yielding carbon infusion into the molten metal in the yajña process, to carburize iron, for example, to harden it and produce steel as a ferrous-carbon alloy.
Trita ("the Third") is a minor deity of the Rigveda, mentioned 41 times. He is associated with the Maruts, with Vayu and with Indra, like Indra, or as Indra's assistant, fighting Tvastar, Vrtra and Vala. He is called Āptya, meaning "son of the deity of the Apas (waters)" and a friend of Indra. The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa mentions Trita and his brothers Ekata and Dvita as the sons of Apas or the water deities who were born as a result of Agni's anger with the waters.
Fourfold, namely, was Agni (fire) at first. Now that Agni whom they at first chose for the office of Hotri priest passed away. He also whom they chose the second time passed away. He also whom they chose the third time passed away. Thereupon the one who still constitutes the fire in our own time, concealed himself from fear. He entered into the waters. Him the gods discovered and brought forcibly away from the waters. He spat upon the waters, saying, 'Bespitten are ye who are an unsafe place of refuge, from whom they take me away against my will!' Thence sprung the Âptya deities, Trita, Dvita, and Ekata. - 1:2:3:1

The text also mentions that they followed Indra just as a Brahman follows the train of a king.
They roamed about with Indra, even as nowadays a Brâhman follows in the train of a king. When he slew Visvarûpa, the three-headed son of Tvashtri, they also knew of his going to be killed.; and straightway Trita slew him. Indra, assuredly, was free from that (sin), for he is a god. - 1:2:3:2
In RV 1.105, Trita fallen into a well begs aid from the gods. Sayana on 1.105 comments that this relates to three rishis, Ekata, Dvita and Trita who found a well, and Trita, drawing water, was pushed down by the other two and imprisoned, where he composed a hymn to the gods, and managed miraculously to prepare the yajña Soma; this is alluded to in RV 9.34.4 and described in Mahabharata 9.2095.
The secret process of Trita, the artificer, results in a three-fold bandhana, 'alloying of carbon or infusion into the molten metal of Soma'.
RV 1.163.3 explains a secret process:
Griffith translation: 1.163.3 Yama art thou, O Horse; thou art Aditya; Trita art thou by secret operation. Thou art divided thoroughly from Soma. They say thou hast three bonds in heaven.
that hold thee.Wilson translation: 1.163.03 Your horse is Yama and you are A_ditya; you are Trita by a mysterious act; you are associated with Soma. The sages have said there are three

I suggest that the Varāha Bhutan mask of Kerala with a vividly protruding tongue out of the
snout, signifies an alchemist.
Varāha is baḍhi, 'boar', vaḍraṅgi, vaḍlaṅgi, vaḍlavāḍu, baḍaga, vardhaki, 'worker in metal and
wood'.
The phaḍā, 'cobrahoods' signify that he is a member of a paṭṭaḍi, phaḍā 'smithy, metals manufactory'.
रसः [रस्-अच्] The tongue (as the organ of taste); िाण्यां च छन्ांतस रसे जलेशम् Bhāg.8.2.27; तजतं सिं तजते रसे 11.8.21. Rebus: रसः Gold. -3 A metal in a state of fusion. -वादः alchemy (Apte).

luster analysis of Indus writing system design principle, of 33 sāṅgāḍī 'joined parts'; Field

https://tinyurl.com/y8p7b8q2
Thesis of the monograph: Indus Script Field symbols are accounting ledger classifications of wealth categories, classified as metalwork.
This thesis is validated by a Cluster analysis of 33 sāṅgāḍī 'joined parts' Indus Script Field symbols evidences samgaha wealth categories for accounting ledgers, samgaha 'catalogue, list, arranger, manager'. The cargo listed in samgaha are inscribed -- as Indus Script inscriptions -for delivery by જંગડિયો jangaḍiyo 'military guard who accompanies treasure into the treasury' (Gujarati) --in mercantile transactions on jangaḍ ,'invoiced on approval basis'. This mercantile process explains the repeated and frequent deployment of sāṅgāḍī 'joined parts' princple of writing system for both 'signs' and 'field symbols'.

Executive Summary
The cluster analysis presented in this monograph identify superstructures of wealth categories to
which the ‘triplets of signs’ are substructures. The study suggests that there are 33 distinct
structures relatedto wealth categories of metalwork to document work on: 1. Minerals; 2. Smelting; 3. Use of furnaces to create alloys by mixing minerals or infusing carbon element through carburization processes; smithy, forge work; 4. Forging of implements, tools, metalware; 5. Metalcasting, including cire perdue (lost-waxmethods) of metal casting; 6. Organization in guilds of artisans/seafaring merchants.
The following 38 categories of wealth accounting ledgers are identified by cluster analysis
Cluster 1 Eagle in flight cluster, thunderbolt weapon, blacksmith classifier Cluster 2 Metallurgical invention of aṅgāra carburization, infusion of carbon element to harden molten metal Cluster 3 Svastika cluster, zinc wealth category Cluster 4 Ficus clusters, copper wealth category Cluster 5 Tiger cluster, smelter category Cluster 6 Spearing a bovine cluster, smelter work Cluster 7 A metallurgical process narrative in four clusters -- four sides of a tablet: Cluster 8 Seafaring boat cluster, cargo wealth category Cluster 9 Bier cluster, wheelwright category Cluster 10 Sickle cluster, wheelwright category Cluster 11 Sun's rays cluster, gold wealth category Cluster 12 Body of standing person cluster, element classifier Cluster 13 Frog cluster, ingot classifier Cluster 14 Serpent cluster as anakku, 'tin ore' classifier Cluster 15 Tortoise, turtle clusters, bronze classifiers Cluster 16 Seated person in penance, mint classifier Cluster 17 Archer cluster, mint classifier Cluster 18 ayakara 'metalsmith' cluster, alloy metal smithy, forge classifier Cluster 19 Smelter cluster, wealth-category of smelted mineral ores Cluster 20 Magnetite, ferrite ore cluster wealth-category or wealth-classification

This accounting classification of metalwork wealth categories is consistent with the finding that the writing system with a recognized pattern of clustering pictorial motifs was consistently used over the entire gamut of contact areas of Sarasvati civilization. Decipherment of the hieroglyph
components of field symbols yields the semantic structure of underlying Meluhha speech
in Bhāratīya sprachbund(Speech union).
The total number of objects on M Corpus with distinct, unambiguous pictorials or field symbols is 1894. It is unfortunate that most decipherment claims ignore an analysis of this dominant portion of the documented evidence of the civilization. Some brush them aside as 'cult symbols', some say they are 'religious symbols'.
A cluster analysis of these 1894 Indus Script Field symbols has also been ignored by the cluster analysis of triplets of 'signs' done by K-means by Nisha Yadav et al. I submit that pictorial motifs or field symbols are integral parts of the hypertext messaging system of the Indus Script inscriptions. It should be noted that these pictorial motifs or field symbols occupy the major portion of the space for messaging used on an inscribed object in Indus Script Corpora (which now total over 8000 inscriptions).
This demonstrable laxity in most decipherment claims or cluster analyses is governed by a hypothesis of the 'text' as the writing system, and perhaps ignoring the field symbol or pictorial motifs are extraneous to the messaging system.
I submit that the field symbols or pictorial motifs are the dominant classifiers of the Indus accounting system to identify distinct wealth-accounting category ledgers to document the wealth of a guild of artisans and seafaring merchants. This monograph demonstrates the semantic structure of the field symbols or pictorial motifs in the framework of the principal design principle of the script (which applies to both 'signs' and 'field symbols') which is: sāṅgāḍī 'joined parts' rebus: samgraha, samgaha 'catalogue, list, arranger, manager' jangaḍ ,'invoiced on approval basis' -- an accounting classification of ledgers for wealth accounting during the Tin-Bronze Revolution, 4th millennium BCE. This sāṅgāḍī 'joined parts' principle of writing system design explains why animal parts are joined together to create 'fabulour' or 'composite' animal pictorial motifs or field symbols.

Impression of a cylinder seal, unknown Near Eastern Origin.

Impression of a cylinder seal, unknown Near Eastern Origin. Louvre Museum. FS 117 In the upper regiMer from R.-: person grappling with two animals (tigers); a horned personage standing behind a pedestal; a kinn tree; In the lower register from R.-a bird in flight over a unicorn : an antelope: two horned bulls facingeach other and a cicle (dotted?)
Indus Script inscription, message: Brassworker's guild, smelter metalwork catalogue, pewter, laterite castings, hard alloys, implements, smithy/forge working in iron, lead, metal hard alloys.
Copyrighted photo by M. Chuzeville for the Departement des antiquites orientales, Musee du Louvre. "One of the two anthropomorphic figures carved on this seal wears the horns of water buffalo while sitting on a throne with hoofed legs, surrounded by snakes, fishes and water buffaloes. Copyrighted photo by M. Chuzeville for the Departement des antiquites orientales, Musee du Louvre." http://www.akhabataku.com/IndusScript.htm (After Fig. 6)
Hieroglyph multiplexes of the hypertext of the cylinder seal from a Near Eastern Source can be identified: aquatic bird, rhinoceros, buffalo, buffalo horn, crucible, markhor, antelope, hoofed stool, fish, tree, tree branch, twig, roundish stone, tiger, rice plant.
Hieroglyph components on the head-gear of the person on cylinder seal impression are: twig, crucible, buffalo horns: kuThI 'badari ziziphus jojoba' twig Rebus: kuThi 'smelter';koThAri 'crucible' Rebus: koThAri 'treasurer'; tattAru 'buffalo horn'
Rebus: ṭhã̄ ṭhāro 'brassworker'. koD 'horns' rebus: koD 'workshop'. Thus, the gypertext message is: a brassworker's workshop with a smelter.



15
This hieroglyph multiplex ligatures head of an antelope to a snake: nAga 'snake' Rebus:nAga 'lead' PLUS karaḍū or ṅkaraḍēṃ ] n A kid. कराडू ं (p. 137) [ karāḍūṃ ] n (Commonly करडू ं ) Akid. (Marathi) Rebus: करडा (p. 137) [ karaḍā ]'hard alloy' ranku 'antelope' Rebus:ranku 'tin'. tuttināgamu is a Prakritam gloss meaning 'pewter, zinc'. A comparable alloy may be indicated by the hieroglyph-multiplex of antelope-snake: rankunAga, perhaps a type of zinc or lead alloy.
Two fish hieroglyphs flank the hoofed legs of the stool or platform signify: warehouse of cast
metal alloy metal implements:
khuṭo ʻleg, footʼ. khũṭ ‘community, guild’ (Santali)Ta. kuracu, kuraccai horse's hoof. Ka. gorasu,

Hieroglyph: kaṇḍō a stool Rebus: kanda 'implements' Hieroglyph: maṇḍā 'raised platform, stool' Rebus: maṇḍā 'warehouse'.
dula 'pair' Rebus: dul 'cast metal' ayo 'fish' Rebus: aya 'iron' (Gujarati) ayas 'metal' (Rigveda) barad, barat 'ox' Rebus: भरत (p. 603) [ bharata ] n A factitious metal compounded of copper, pewter, tin &c.(Marathi).
This mkultiplx is flanked by 1. kolom 'rice plant' Rebus: kolimi 'smithy, forge'; 2. kuTi 'tree' Rebus: kuThi 'smeter'. Thus the message is that the warehouse of cast metal alloy metal
implements is complemented by a smelter and a smithy/forge -- part of the metalwork
repertoire. khuṭo ʻleg, footʼ. khũṭ ‘community, guild’ (Santali)
The hieroglyph-multiplex of a woman thwarting two rearing tigers is also signified on other seals and tablets to signify:



16
Hieroglyph: kola 'woman' Rebus: kol 'working in iron' dula 'pair' Rebus: dul 'cast metal' PLUS kola 'tiger' Rebus: kolle 'blacksmith'; kolhe 'smelter'; kole.l'smithy, forge'. The kolmo 'rice-plant' Rebus kolimi 'smithy, forge' is a semantic determinant of the cipher: smithy with smelter. taTu 'thwart' rebus: dhatu 'mineral'. Thus, 'mineral smelter'. Together the hieroglyph-multiplex or hypertext of a woman thwarting two tigers signifies: smithy/forge with smelter for dhatu, minerals.
The bottom register of the cylinder seal impression lists the products: smithy/forge forged iron, alloy castings (laterite PLUS spelter), hard alloy implements.
goTa 'roundish stone' Rebus: goTa 'laterite, ferrite ore' 'gold-lace braid'
dula 'pair' Rebus: dul 'cast metal' PLUS rã̄ go 'buffalo' Rebus: rāṅgā 'zinc alloy, spelter, pewter'. Thus, cast spelter PLUS laterite, ferrite ore. markhor PLUS tail
miṇḍāl 'markhor' (Tōrwālī) meḍho a ram, a sheep (Gujarati)(CDIAL 10120) Rebus: mẽṛhẽt,
meḍ 'iron' (Munda.Ho.) koṭe meṛed = forged iron, in contrast to dul meṛed, cast iron (Mundari)
PLUS Kur. xolā tail. Malt. qoli id. (DEDR 2135) Rebus: kol 'working in iron' Ta. kol working in iron, blacksmith; kollaṉ blacksmith. Ma. kollan blacksmith, artificer. Ko. kole·l smithy, temple in Kota village.
Rhinoceros PLUS eagle aśan, śyena, sena 'eagle' rebus: sena 'thunderbolt' ahan 'blacksmith' PLUSkhamba 'wing' rebus: kammaṭa 'mint'.
Hieroglyhph: kāṇṭā 'rhinoceros. gaṇḍá m. ʻ rhinoceros ʼ Rebus: kāṇḍa 'tools, pots and pans and metal-ware' (Gujarati)
Two water-buffalos flanks a hieroglyph: something round, like a seed. Hieroglyph: rã̄ go 'buffalo' Rebus: rāṅgā 'zinc alloy, spelter, pewter'. What does the hieroglyph 'something round' signify? I suggest that it signifies goṭa 'round pebble' rebus: goṭa 'laterite (ferrous ore)'.
Orthographic variants of tails of 'animal' hieroglyphs, particularly those of ram or antelope are deciphered as rebus-metonymy layered Meluhha (Proto-Prakritam) words related to blacksmithy or smelters of iron and other metals including metal infusion and cire perdue lost-wax castings. The 'tail' hieroglyh also gets normalised as a sign on texts to connote kolA 'tail' Rebus: kolhe 'smelter' kolle 'blacksmith'.
Some hieroglyph components are: hooded snake or short-tail generally on antelopes.

Mark Kenoyer writes that "discoveries of this motif on seals from Mohenjo-daro definitely show a male figure and most scholars have assumed some connection with the carved seals from Mesopotamia that illustrate episodes from the famous Gilgamesh epic. The Mesopotamian motifs show lions being strangled by a hero, whereas the Indus narratives render tigers being strangled by a figure, sometime clearly males, sometimes ambiguous or possibly female. This motif of a hero or heroine grappling with two wild animals could have been created independently for similar events that may have occurred in Mesopotamia as well as the Indus valley," ( Ancient Cities, p. 114).
Mohenjo-daro seal. Mohenjo-daro, ca. 2500 BCE Asko Parpola writes: "The 'contest' motif is one of the most convincing and widely accepted parallels between Harappan and Near Eastern glyptic art. A considerable number of Harappan seals depict a manly hero, each hand grasping a tiger by the throat. In Mesopotamian art, the fight with lions and / or bulls is the most popular motif. The Harappan substitution of tigers for lions merely reconciles the scene with the fauna of the Indus Valley ... The six dots around the head of the Harappan hero are a significant detail, since they may correspond to the six locks of hair characteristic of the Mesopotamian hero, from Jemdet Nasr to Akkadian times," (Deciphering the Indus Script, pp. 246-7).

"Front view of Meiolania platyceps fossil
Meiolania ("small roamer") is an extinct genus of cryptodire
turtle from the Oligocene to Holocene, with the last relict populations at New Caledonia which survived until 2,000 years ago.
The animal was rather large, measuring 2.5 metres (8.2 ft) in length, making it the second-largest known nonmarine turtle or tortoise, surpassed only by Colossochelys atlas from Asia, which lived in the Pleistocene. It lived in Australia and New Caledonia. Remains have also been found on the island of Efate in Vanuatu, associated with settlements from the Lapitaculture...When the first fossil remains (a vertebra) were found, they were originally thought to be from a large monitor lizard, similar to, but smaller than Megalania, so the genus was named accordingly. Later, when more remains were found, it was realized that the "small roamer" was actually a turtle, and not a lizard. Synonyms include Miolania and Ceratochelys."

This guild, community of smiths and masons evolves into Harosheth Hagoyim, ‘a smithy of nations’.
It appears that the Meluhhans were in contact with many interaction areas, Dilmun and Susa (elam) in particular. There is evidence for Meluhhan settlements outside of Meluhha. It is a
reasonable inference that the Meluhhans with bronze-age expertise of creating arsenical and
bronze alloys and working with other metals constituted the ‘smithy of nations’, Harosheth
Hagoyim.

Indus Script Corpora evidence points to the early working with magnetite, ferrite ore as seen by the signifier hieroglyph पोळ pōḷa, 'bos indicus, zebu'. The prologue dedication is first to this bos indicussignified by the synonym: Nanda, nandi. The word नांदी nāndī signifies prologue dedication.



69
पोळ (p. 305) pōḷa m A bull dedicated to the gods, marked with a trident and discus, and set at
large. Rebus: पोळ pōḷa 'magnetite, ferrite ore'. As eulogium or praise of the divine, the synonym
used is: नंदी (p. 256) nandī m (S) The bull on which Mahádeva rides. A stone-bull is fixed in
front of all temples to Mahádeva. The word nanda has specific meanings in the context of trade transactions. नंद (p. 256) nanda m नंदकी f (नंद was a proper name.) A clandestine or covert term, amongst dealers and brokers, for दलाली or the fees of brokerage. De- vised to keep the secrets of trade from the employer of the broker and the mere customer. Its vocabulary is भुरका One rupee, ढोकळा One pysa, के िली One, अिारू Two, उधानू Three, पोकू Four, मुळू Five, शेली Six,
पतििू Seven, भंगी Eight, तेिसू or लेिनू Nine, अंगुळू Ten, एकडू Eleven, रे घी Twelve, ठे परू Thirteen, चोपडू Fourteen, तळी Fifteen. To this last term the first four numerals successively added (the sense of addition being expressed by तान) form successively 16, 17, 18, 19, as भुरका
तान तळी अिारू तान तळी, उधानू तान तळी, पोकू तान तळी. काटी stands for 20; then भुरका तान
काटी, अिारू तान काटी &c. express 21, 22 &c. तबटी is 100, ढकार 1000, फाटा is An̤ á, अिारू फाटे Two án̤ ás, मंगी फाटे Eight án̤ ás, तळी फाटे Fifteen án̤ ás, दुकार One án̤ á, चकार Two án̤ ás, पकार Four án̤ ás, टाली Half a rupee. The नंद vocabulary however has variations. Expressive of the above account the following अभंग has been composed, मुळू 5 िदनाचा उधानु 3 नेिाचा ॥ अंगूळू 10
िातांचा स्वामी माझा ॥1॥ मुगुट जयाचा के ि- ळ्या 1 आगळी कांटी 20 पतिि तळिटी चरण ज्याचे ॥2॥ ढकार 1000 िदनाचा आला िणाभिया ॥ तजव्हा त्याच्या तचरल्या िणभिेना ॥3॥ शेली 6 िेडािली पोकू 4 भौनािली ॥ अगुंळू मंतग 18 थकली नकळे त्यांसी ॥4॥ सद्भािें शरण आिारू 2 जोडू न ॥ खेचरिीसा म्हणे स्वामी माझा ॥5॥. नंद थाकणें or ठे िणें To make (i. e. obtain) नंद or secret brokerage.
Another onnotation is a mystical figure of lines drawn on the sacred cloth held at marriages between bride and bridegroom: नंद (p. 256) nanda m (S) Red lines or figures, esp. the mystical figure called स्वस्तिक , drawn on the अंतःपट or cloth which, at marriages, is held between the bride and bridegroom. 2 Vertigo incidental to puerperal women. नंदाचा पासोडा (p. 256) nandācā pāsōḍā m नंदाचा शेला m The अंतःपट (cloth held at marriages between the bride and bridegroom) having red lines or figures drawn over it, esp. the mystical figure called स्वस्तिक which is termed नंद. नंदी nandī (Or नंद) The lines or figures drawn with कुं कूं &c. upon the अंतःपट.
Thus, the terms nanda, nandi get associated with mystic, vikalpa signifiers as in पोळ (p. 305)
pōḷa m A bull dedicated to the gods, marked with a trident and discus, and set at large, as a rebus
signifier of: पोळ pōḷa 'magnetite, ferrite ore'.
While rendering eulogies and prayers to the divine, the oblations are signified as नांदीमुख nāndīmukha
A set of synonymous words & expressions: नांदी (p. 259) nāndī f S Eulogium of a king or praise of a deity recited in benedictory verses at the opening of a drama &c. नांदीमुख nāndīmukha n S नांदीश्राद्ध n S Oblations to the manes offered on festal occasions. నాంది (p. 640) nāndi nāndi.

A synonym for 'bull', bos indicus, is: poḷa 'zebu' which is a definitive Indus Script hieroglyph. Rebus signifier of poḷa 'magnetite, ferrite ore'-- a metalwork for wealth creation by artisans of Sarasvati_Sindhu Civilization. This Indus Script hieroglyph which signifies 'zebu' or poḷa is seen on early inscriptions of Indus Script as on the paintings of Nausharo pots. The bird perched on the shoulder of the zebu painting is black drongo: pōlaḍu, 'black drongo',rebus: pōlaḍ, 'steel',
The zebu is tied to a post with a rope to signify: meṛh f. ʻ rope tying oxen to each other and to

crowd, fellowship (DEDR 1882) Pa. gotta ‘clan’; Pk. gotta, gōya id. (CDIAL 4279) Semantics

Alternative: adar ḍangra ‘zebu or humped bull’; rebus: aduru ‘native metal’ (Ka.); ḍhangar ‘blacksmith’ (H.)
6. The sixth animal can only be guessed. Perhaps, a tiger (A reasonable inference, because the
glyph ’tiger’ appears in a procession on some Indus script inscriptions. Glyph: ‘tiger?’: kol ‘tiger’.Rebus: kol ’worker in iron’. Vikalpa (alternative): perhaps, rhinoceros. gaṇḍa ‘rhinoceros’; rebus:khaṇḍ ‘tools, pots and pans and metal-ware’. Thus, the
entire glyphic composition of six animals on the Mohenjodaro seal m417 is semantically a
representation of a śrḗṇi, ’guild’, a khũṭ , ‘community’ of smiths and masons.

Rebus readings of the hieroglyphs signified on the plaque are:
సగ్గ ెడ saggeḍa 'A metal vessel' Rebus: sagara 'proclamation, trade'; sangatarāśū 'stone cutter'
śrēṣṭrī 'ladder' Rebus: seṭh ʻ head of a guild, Members of the guild (working with a furnace)
kāṅga 'comb' Rebus: kanga 'brazier, fireplace'.
pōḷā 'zebu' rebus: pōḷa ‘magnetite ore, ferrite ore’
Meluhha is the parole (speech form), lingua franca of Sarasvati-Sindhu civilization.
These readings of Jiroft hypertexts are premised on the suggested presence of Meluhha speakers of artisan guilds in Halil Rud (Jiroft culture), as explorers for metal resources and producers of metal products to create wealth of their nation or janapada.
Jiroft culture and Harappa culture are cognates: an iconographic comparison reveals the deep roots of Indo-Iranian traditions. See notes on the arrival of Meluhha speakers in Indo-Iranian region.
When a hypertext is presented with a black drongo perched on a zebu (bos indicus), it is not necessary to posit a mythological narrative. Treating this as a hypertext of metaphors rendered rebus in Indus Script Meluhha provides a truthful framework for realizing the meanings of the signifier and the signified in the message. Hieroglyph: black drongo: పోలడు pōlaḍu rebus: पोलाद [ pōlāda ] n ( or P) Steel. पोलादी a Of steel. (Marathi) bulad 'steel, flint and steel for making fire' (Amharic); fūlād 'steel' (Arabic) The Prakritam gloss पोळ [pōḷa], 'zebu' as hieroglyph is read rebus: pōḷa, 'magnetite, ferrous-ferric oxide'; poliya 'citizen, gatekeeper of town quarter'. Thus, the black drongo perched on a zebu, bos indicus as a hypertext signifies: magnetite, ferrite ore and steel.
Halil Rud plaque signifies:in Sarasvati Script hieroglyphs pōlāda pōḷa dhā̄̆ vaḍ 'smelter and
worker in magnetite ferrite ore and steel' (in) sãgaṛh m. ʻ line of entrenchments, stone walls for
defence ʼ.

• A rare white marble cylinder seal from Jiroft. A brand new paper by Massimo Vidale and Dennys Frenez, Indus Components in the Iconography of a White Marble Cylinder Seal from Konar Sandal South (Kerman, Iran) provides a detailed analysis of this seal found at the recently discovered site of Jiroft . Well used, and apparently worn at the wrist, it testifies to the multiple cultural and trade connections between the Indus civilization and its western neighbors. It also suggests many more discoveries and insights into Indus civilization will come from material found at and connected to Jiroft.Read Massimo Vidale's paper Indus Components in the Iconography of a White Marble Cylinder Seal from Konar Sandal South (Kerman, Iran). The first part of the article summarizes what we know about the Jiroft civilization so far, its apparent origins in the late 5th millennium BCE, how it flourished at the height of the Indus civilization, and the tantalizing facts about connections between the two. Could it have been the ancient nation and state of Marhashi/Parahshum about which so little is known but which would have been at the cross-roads of so many cultures? What could have been the function of these so-called whorl seals, only found so far here, at Mohenjo-daro, Allahdino and Kalibangan? • • •

John Marshall wrote: "Seals of this group [cylinder seals, although Mackay above is not sure they are true cylinder seals]], if indeed they are seals, are very rarely found at Mohenjo-daro, only five specimen being obtained in all. They are all made of ivory and differ from the cylinder seals of other countries in being very long and thing; nor are they perforated for suspension on a cord. It is possible that these so-called seals are not true seals at all. They incised characters upon them might conceivably be identification marks for a game or something similar. On the other hand, they are certainly suitable for use a seals and in this account they are included in this chapter For the sake of clearness the actual seal is shown side by side with each impression.

Evolution ḍha-, dha- in Brahmi script syllables are evocative of 'string' and 'circle, dotted circle' as may be seen from the following orthographic evidence of epigraphs dated from ca. 300 BCE:
It may be seen from the table of evoution of Brahmi script orthography that
1. a circle signified the Brahmi syllable 'ṭha-' and a dotted circle signified the syllable 'tha-';
2. a string with a twist signified the syllable 'da-', a string ending in a circled twist signified the syllable 'ḍha-' and a stepped string signified the syllable 'ḍa-'.

There is a possibility that this seal impression from Haft Tepe had some connections with Indian
hieroglyphs. This requires further investigation. “From Haft Tepe (Middle Elamite period, ca. 13th century) in Ḵūzestān an unusual pyrotechnological installation was associated with a craft
workroom containing such materials as mosaics of colored stones framed in bronze, a
dismembered elephant skeleton used in manufacture of bone tools, and several hundred bronze
arrowpoints and small tools. “Situated in a courtyard directly in front of this workroom is a most
unusual kiln. This kiln is very large, about 8 m long and 2 and one half m wide, and contains two long compartments with chimneys at each end, separated by a fuel chamber in the middle. Although the roof of the kiln had collapsed, it is evident from the slight inturning of the walls which remain in situ that it was barrel vaulted like the roofs of the tombs. Each of the two long heating chambers is divided into eight sections by partition walls. The southern heating chamber contained metallic slag, and was apparently used for making bronze objects. The northern
heating chamber contained pieces of broken pottery and other material, and thus was apparently
used for baking clay objects including tablets . . .” (loc.cit. Bronze in pre-Islamic Iran,

"Late Harappan Period dish or lid with perforation at edge for hanging or attaching to large jar. It shows a Blackbuck antelope with trefoil design made of combined circle-and-dot motifs, possibly representing stars. It is associated with burial pottery of the Cemetery H period,dating after 1900 BC.The Late Harappan Period at Harappa is represented by the Cemetery H culture (190-1300 BC) which is named after the discovery of a large cemetery filled with painted burial urns and some extended inhumations. The earlier burials in this cemetery were laid out much like Harappan coffin burials, but in the later burials, adults were cremated and the bones placed in large urns (164). The change in burial customs represents a major shift in religion and can also be correlated to important changes in economic and political organization. Cemetery H pottery and related ceramics have been found throughout northern Pakistan, even as far north as Swat, where they mix with distinctive local traditions. In the east, numerous sites in the Ganga

Yamuna Doab provide evidence for the gradual expansion of settlements into this heavily forested region. One impetus for this expansion may have been the increasing use of rice and other summer (kharif) crops that could be grown using monsoon stimulated rains. Until late in the Harappan Period (after 2200 BC) the agricultural foundation of the Harappan cities was largely winter (rabi) crops that included wheat and barley. Although the Cemetery H culture encompassed a relatively large area, the trade connections with thewestern highlands began to break down as did the trade with the coast. Lapis lazuli and turquoise beads are rarely found in the settlements, and marine shell for ornaments and ritual objects gradually disappeared. On the other hand the technology of faience manufacture becomes more refined, possibly in order to compensate for the lack of raw materials such as shell, faience and possibly even carnelian."
