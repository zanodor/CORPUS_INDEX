PREFACE.
IT requires no profound knowledge to reach the conclusion that the time has not yet come for an exhaustive treatise on the
religion of Babylonia and Assyria. But even if our knowledge of this religion were more advanced than it is, the utility of an
exhaustive treatment might still be questioned. Exhaustive
treatises are apt to be exhausting to both reader and author ;
and however exhaustive (or exhausting) such a treatise may be,
it cannot be final except in the fond imagination of the writer.
For as long as activity prevails in any branch of science, all
results are provisional. Increasing knowledge leads necessarily to a change of perspective and to a readjustment of views. The chief reason for writing a book is to prepare the way for the next one on the same subject. In accordance with the general plan of this Series ] of Hand
books, it has been my chief aim to gather together in convenient arrangement and readable form what is at present
known about the religion of the Babylonians and Assyrians. The investigations of scholars are scattered through a large
variety of periodicals and monographs. The time has come for focusing the results reached, for sifting the certain from the uncertain, and the uncertain from the false. This work of
gathering the disjecta membra of Assyriological science is essential to future progress. If I have succeeded in my chief
aim, I shall feel amply repaid for the labor involved.
1 Set forth in the announcement of the series at the back of the book and in the Editor's Prefatory Note to Volume I.



viii PREFACE.
In order that the book may serve as a guide to students, the names of those to whose researches our present knowledge of
the subject is due have frequently been introduced, and it will be found, I trust, that I have been fair to all. 1 At the same
time, I have naturally not hesitated to indicate my dissent from
views advanced by this or that scholar, and it will also be
found, I trust, that in the course of my studies I have advanced
the interpretation of the general theme or of specific facts at various points. While, therefore, the book is only in a secondary degree sent forth as an original contribution, the discussion of mooted points will enhance its value, I hope, for the specialist, as well as for the general reader and student for
whom, in the first place, the volumes of this series are
intended.
The disposition of the subject requires a word of explanation. After the two introductory chapters (common to all the volumes of the series) I have taken up the pantheon as the
natural means to a survey of the field. The pantheon is
treated, on the basis of the historical texts, in four sections :
(i) the old Babylonian period, (2) the middle period, or the pantheon in the days of Hammurabi, (3) the Assyrian pantheon, and (4) the latest or neo-Babylonian period. The most
difficult phase has naturally been the old Babylonian pantheon. Much is uncertain here. Not to speak of the chronology which
is still to a large extent guesswork, the identification of many
of the gods occurring in the oldest inscriptions, with their later
equivalents, must be postponed till future discoveries shall have cleared away the many obstacles which beset the path of the scholar. The discoveries at Telloh and Nippur have occa
sioned a recasting of our views, but new problems have arisen as rapidly as old ones have been solved. I have been espe
cially careful in this section not to pass beyond the range of
1 In the index, however, names of scholars have only been introduced where absolutely necessary to the subject.



PREFACE. IX
what is definitely known, or, at the most, what may be regarded as tolerably certain. Throughout the chapters on the pantheon, I have endeavored to preserve the attitude of being
' open to conviction ' an attitude on which at present too much stress
can hardly be laid.
The second division of the subject is represented by the
religious literature. With this literature as a guide, the views
held by the Babylonians and Assyrians regarding magic and
oracles, regarding the relationship to the gods, the creation of the world, and the views of life after death have been illustrated
by copious translations, together with discussions of the speci
mens chosen. The translations, I may add, have been made direct from the original texts, and aim to be as literal as is consonant with presentation in idiomatic English.
The religious architecture, the history of the temples, and the cult form the subject of the third division. Here again there
is much which is still uncertain, and this uncertainty accounts for the unequal subdivisions of the theme which will not
escape the reader.
Following the. general plan of the series, the last chapter of the book is devoted to a general estimate and to a consideration
of the influence exerted by the religion of Babylonia and Assyria.
In the transliteration of proper names, I have followed con
ventional methods for well-known names (like Nebuchadnezzar), and the general usage of scholars in the case of others. In
some cases I have furnished a transliteration of my own ; and for the famous Assyrian king, to whom we owe so much of the
material for the study of the Babylonian and Assyrian religion, Ashurbanabal, I have retained the older usage of writing it
with a />, following in this respect Lehman, whose arguments * in favor of this pronunciation for the last element in the name
I regard as on the whole acceptable.

x PREFACE.
I have reasons to regret the proportions to which the work
has -grown. These proportions were entirely unforeseen when I began the book, and have been occasioned mainly by the large amount of material that has been made available by
numerous important publications that appeared after the actual writing of the book had begun. This constant increase of
material necessitated constant revision of chapters ; and such revision was inseparable from enlargement. I may conscientiously say that I have studied these recent publications thor
oughly as they appeared, and .have embodied at the proper
place the results reached by others and which appeared to me
acceptable. The work, therefore, as now given to the public may fairly be said to represent the state of present knowledge. In a science that grows so rapidly as Assyriology, to which
more than to many others the adage of dies diem docet is appli
cable, there is great danger of producing a piece of work that
is antiquated before it leaves the press. At times a publication appeared too late to be utilized. So Delitzsch's important con
tribution to the origin of cuneiform writing l was published long
after the introductory chapters had been printed. In this book he practically abandons his position on the Sumerian question (as set forth on p. 22 of this volume) and once more
joins the opposite camp. As far as my own position is concerned, I do not feel called upon to make any changes from the statements found in chapter i., even after reading Weiss
bach's Die Sumerische Frage (Leipzig, 1898), the latest con
tribution to the subject, which is valuable as a history of
the controversy, but offers little that is new. Delitzsch's name must now be removed from the list of those who accept
Halevy's thesis ; but, on the other hand, Halevy has gained a
strong ally in F. Thureau-Dangin, whose special studies in the old Babylonian inscriptions lend great weight to his utterances on the origin of the cuneiform script. Dr. Alfred Jeremias, of
1 Die Entstehung des altesten Schriftsystems (Leipzig, 1897).



PREFACE. XI
Leipzig, is likewise to be added to the adherents of Halevy. The Sumero-Akkadian controversy is not yet settled, and mean
while it is well to bear in mind that not every Assyriologist is
qualified to pronounce an opinion on the subject. A special
study is required, and but few Assyriologists have made such a study. Accepting a view or a tradition from one's teacher does not constitute a person an authority, and one may be a
very good Assyriologist without having views on the controversy that are of any particular value. Lastly, I desire to call attention to the Bibliography, on which much time has been spent, and which will, I trust, be found
satisfactory. In a list of addenda at the end of the book, I have noted some errors that slipped into the book, and I have
also embodied a few additions. The copious index is the
work of my student, Dr. S. Koppe, and it gives me pleasure to
express my deep obligations to him for the able and painstaking manner in which he has carried out the work so kindly undertaken by him. The drawing for the map was made by Mr. J.
Horace Frank of Philadelphia.
To my wife more thanks are due than I can convey in words for her share in the work. She copied almost all of
the manuscript, and in doing so made many valuable suggestions. Without her constant aid and encouragement I would have shrunk from a task which at times seemed too formidable
to be carried to a successful issue. As I lay down my pen
after several years of devotion to this book, my last thought is
one of gratitude to the beloved partner of my joys and sorrows.

THE RELIGION OF BABYLONIA AND ASSYRIA.
CHAPTER I. INTRODUCTION.
SOURCES AND METHODS OF STUDY.
I.
UNTIL about the middle of this century, our knowledge of
the religion of the Babylonians and Assyrians was exceedingly scant. No records existed that were contemporaneous with the
period covered by Babylonian-Assyrian history; no monuments of the past were preserved that might, in default of records, throw light upon the religious ideas and customs that once
prevailed in Mesopotamia. The only sources at command were the incidental notices insufficient and fragmentary in char
acter that occurred in the Old Testament, in Herodotus, in
Eusebius, Syncellus, and Diodorus. Of these, again, only the two first-named, the Old Testament and Herodotus, can be termed direct sources ; the rest simply reproduce extracts from
other works, notably from Ctesias, the contemporary of Xeno
phon, from Berosus, a priest of the temple of Bel in Babylonia, who lived about the time of Alexander the Great, or shortly
after, and from Apollodorus, Abydenus, Alexander Polyhistor, and Nicolas of Damascus, all of whom being subsequent to Berosus, either quote the latter or are dependent upon him. Of all these sources it may be said, that what information
they furnish of Babylonia and Assyria bears largely upon the political history, and only to a very small degree upon the



2 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
religion. In the Old Testament, the two empires appear only as they enter into relations with the Hebrews, and since
Hebrew history is not traced back beyond the appearance of
the clans of Terah in Palestine, there is found previous to this
period, barring the account of the migrations of the Terahites
in Mesopotamia, only the mention of the Tigris and Euphrates among the streams watering the legendary Garden of Eden, the incidental reference to Nimrod and his empire, which is
made to include the capitol cities of the Northern and Southern
Mesopotamian districts, and the story of the founding of the city of Babylon, followed by the dispersion of mankind from their central habitation in the Euphrates Valley. The followers
of Abram, becoming involved in the attempts of Palestinian
chieftains to throw off the yoke of Babylonian supremacy, an
occasion is found for introducing Mesopotamia again, and so the family history of the Hebrew tribes superinduces at odd times a reference to the old settlements on the Euphrates, but it
is not until the political struggles of the two Hebrew king
doms against the inevitable subjection to the superior force of
Assyrian arms, and upon the fall of Assyria, to the Babylonian
power, that Assyria and Babylonia engage the frequent attention of the chronicler's pen and of the prophet's word. Here, too,
the political situation is always the cmef factor, and it is only
incidentally that the religion comes into play, as when it is said that Sennacherib, the king of Assyria, was murdered while
worshipping in the temple dedicated to a deity, Nisroch ; or
when a prophet, to intensify the picture of the degradation to which the proud king of Babylon is to be reduced, introduces
Babylonian conceptions of the nether world into his discourse. 1
Little, too, is furnished by the Book of Daniel, despite the fact that Babylon is the center of action, and what little there is
1 Isaiah, xiv. For the Babylonian views contained in this chapter, see Alfred
Jeremias, Die Babylonisch-Assyrischen Vorstellungen vom Leben nach dem Tode, pp. 112-116.

bearing on the religious status, such as the significance attached to dreams, and the implied contrast between the religion of iK.Miel and his companions, and that of Nebuchadnezzar and
the Babylonians, loses some of its force by the late origin of
the book. The same applies, only in a still stronger degree, to the Book of Judith, in which Nineveh is the center of the incidents described.
The rabbinical literature produced in Palestine and Baby
lonia is far richer in notices bearing on the religious practices
of Mesopotamia, than is the Old Testament. The large settle
ments of Jews in Babylonia, which, beginning in the sixth century B.C., were constantly being increased by fresh accessions
from Palestine, brought the professors of Judaism face to face with religious conditions abhorrent to their souls. In the
regulations of the Rabbis to guard their followers from the
influences surrounding them, there is frequent reference, open
or implied, to Babylonish practices, to the festivals of the Babylonians, to the images of their gods, to their forms of incanta
tions, and other things besides ; but these notices are rendered
obscure by their indirect character, and require a commentary that can only be furnished by that knowledge of the times
which- they take for granted. To this difficulty, there must be
added the comparatively late date of the notices, which demands
an exercise of care before applying them to the very early period
to which the religion of the Babylonians may be traced.
Coming to Herodotus, it is a matter of great regret that the history of Assyria, which he declares it was his intention to
write, 1 was either never produced, or if produced, lost. In accordance with the general usage of his times, Herodotus included under Assyria the whole of Mesopotamia, both
Assyria proper in the north and Southern Mesopotamia. His history would therefore have been of extraordinary value, and since nothing escaped his observant eye and well-trained mind,

the religious customs of the country would have come in for
their full share of attention. As it is, we have only a few
notices about Babylonia and Assyria, incidental to his history
of Persia. 1 Of these, the majority are purely historical, chief
among which is an epitome of the country's past a curious medley of fact and legend and the famous account of the
capture of Babylon by Cyrus. Fortunately, however, there are four notices that treat of the religion of the inhabitants: the
first, a description of an eight-storied tower, surmounted by a temple sacred to the god Bel ; a second furnishing a rather detailed account of another temple, also sacred to Bel, and
situated in the same precinct of the city of Babylon ; a third
notice speaks, though with provoking brevity, of the funeral customs of the Babylonians ; while in a fourth he describes the
rites connected with the worship of the chief goddess of the
Babylonians, which impress Herodotus, who failed to appreciate
their mystic significance, as shameful. We have no reason to
believe that Ctesias' account of the Assyrian monarchy, under
which he, like Herodotus, included Babylonia, contained any
reference to the religion at all. What he says about Babylonia and Assyria served merely as an introduction to Persian history
the real purpose of his work and the few fragments known
chiefly through Diodorus and Eusebius, deal altogether with the succession of dynasties. As is well known, the lists of
Ctesias have fallen into utter discredit by the side of the
ever-growing confidence in the native traditions as reported by Berosus.
The loss of the latter's history of Babylon is deplorable indeed-; its value would have been greater than the history of Herodotus, because it was based, as we know, on the records
and documents preserved in Babylonian temples. How much of the history dealt with the religion of the people, it is difficult
to determine, but the extracts of it found in various writers show
1 JJook i. (" Clio "), sees. 95, 102, 178-200.



SOURCES AND METHODS OF STUDY. 5
that starting, like the Old Testament, with the beginning of things, Berosus gave a full account of the cosmogony of the
Babylonians. Moreover, the early history of Babylonia being largely legendary, as that of every other nation, tales of the relations existing between the gods and mankind relations
that are always close in the earlier stages of a nation's history must have abounded in the pages of Berosus, even if he did not include in his work a special section devoted to an account
of the religion that still was practiced in his days. The quotations from Berosus in the works of Josephus are all of a historical character ; those in Eusebius and Syncellus, on the
contrary, deal with the religion and embrace the cosmogony of
the Babylonians, the account of a deluge brought on by the gods, and the building of a tower. It is to be noted, moreover, that the quotations we have from Berosus are not direct, for
while it is possible, though not at all certain, that Josephus was still able to consult the works of Berosus, Eusebius and
Syncellus refer to Apollodorus, Abydenus, and Alexander Polyhistor as their authorities for the statements of Berosus.
Passing in this way through several hands, the authoritative
value of the comparatively paltry extracts preserved, is diminished, and a certain amount of inaccuracy, especially in details and in the reading of proper names, 1 becomes almost inevitable.
Lastly, it is to be noted that the list of Babylonian kings found in the famous astronomical work of Claudius Ptolemaeus, valuable as it is for historical purposes, has no connection with
the religion of the Babylonians.
1 An instructive instance is furnished by the mention of a mystic personage,
" Homoroka," which now turns out to be as Professor J. H. Wright has shown
a corruption of Marduk. (See Zeitschrift fiir Assyriologie, x. 71-74.)



BAB YLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
II.
The sum total of the information thus to be gleaned from
ancient sources for an elucidation of the Babylonian-Assyrian
religion is exceedingly meagre, sufficing scarcely for determining its most general traits. Moreover, what there is, requires for the most part a control through confirmatory evidence which
we seek for in vain, in biblical or classical literature.
This control has now been furnished by the remarkable dis
coveries made beneath the soil of Mesopotamia since the year
1842. In that year the French consul at Mosul, P. E. Botta,
aided by a government grant, began a series of excavations in the mounds that line the banks of the Tigris opposite Mosul. The artificial character of these mounds had for some time
been recognized. Botta's first finds of a pronounced character were made at a village known as Khorsabad, which stood on one of the mounds in question. Here, at a short distance below the surface, he came across the remains of what proved
to be a palace of enormous extent. The sculptures that were
found in this palace enormous bulls and lions resting on
backgrounds of limestone, and guarding the approaches to the palace chambers, or long rows of carvings in high relief
lining the palace walls, and depicting war scenes, building
operations, and religious processions left no doubt as to their belonging to an ancient period of history. The written characters found on these monuments substantiated the view that
Botta had come across an edifice of the Assyrian empire, while
subsequent researches furnished the important detail that the excavated edifice lay in a suburb of the ancient capitol of
Assyria, Nineveh, the exact site of which was directly opposite Mosul. Botta's labors extended over a period of three years ;
by the end of which time, having laid bare the greater part of
the palace, he had gathered a large mass of material including



SOURCES AND METHODS OF STUDY. 7
many smaller objects pottery, furniture, jewelry, and ornaments that might serve for the study of Assyrian art and of
Assyrian antiquities, while the written records accompanying the monuments placed for the first time an equally considerable
quantity of original material at the disposal of scholars for the
history of Assyria. All that could be transported was sent to the Louvre, and this material was subsequently published. Botta was followed by Austen Henry Layard, who, acting as the agent of the British Museum, conducted excavations during
the years 1845-50, first at a mound Nimrud, some fifteen miles to the south of Khorsabad, and afterwards on the site of Nineveh
proper, the mound Koyunjik, opposite Mosul, besides visiting and examining other mounds still further to the south within
the district of Babylonia proper. The scope of Layard's excavations exceeded, therefore, those of Botta ; and to the one palace at Khorsabad, he added three
at Nimrud and two at Koyunjik, besides finding traces of a
temple and other buildings. The construction of these edifices was of the same order as the one unearthed by Botta; and
as at the latter, there was a large yield of sculptures, inscrip
tions, and miscellaneous objects. A new feature, however, of Layard's excavations was the finding of several rooms filled with
fragments of small and large clay tablets closely inscribed on both sides in the cuneiform characters. These tablets, about 30,000
of which found their way to the British Museum, proved to be
the remains of a royal library. Their contents ranged over all
departments of thought, hymns, incantations, prayers, epics, history, legends, mythology, mathematics, astronomy constituting
some of the chief divisions. In the corners of the palaces, the
foundation records were also found, containing in each case more or less extended annals of the events that occurred dur
ing the reign of the monarch whose official residence was thus
brought to light. Through Layard, the foundations were laid for the Assyrian and Babylonian collections of the British

Museum, the parts of which exhibited to the public now fill six large halls. Fresh sources of a direct character were thus
added for the study, not only of the historical unfolding of
the Assyrian empire, but through the tablets of the royal library, for the religion of ancient Mesopotamia as well. The stimulus given by Botta and Layard to the recovery of the records and monuments of antiquity that had been hidden from view for more than two thousand years, led to a refresh
ing rivalry between England and France in continuing a work that gave promise of still richer returns by further efforts. Victor Place, a French architect of note, who succeeded Botta as the French consul at Mosul, devoted his term of service,
from 1851 to 1855, towards completing the excavations at
Khorsabad. A large aftermath rewarded his efforts. Thanks,
too, to his technical knowledge and that of his assistant, Felix Thomas, M. Place was enabled more accurately to determine the architectural construction of the temples and palaces of
ancient Assyria. Within this same period (1852-1854) another exploring expedition was sent out to Mesopotamia by
the French government, under the leadership of Fulgence Fresnel, in whose party were the above-mentioned Thomas
and the distinguished scholar Jules Oppert. The objective point this time was Southern Mesopotamia, the mounds of
which had hitherto not been touched, many not even identi
fied as covering the remains of ancient cities. Much valuable
work was done by this expedition in its careful study of the
site of the ancient Babylon, in the neighborhood of the mod
ern village Hillah, some forty miles south of Baghdad. Un
fortunately, the antiquities recovered at this place, and elsewhere, were lost through the sinking of the rafts as they carried their precious burden down the Tigris. In the south again, the English followed close upon the heels of the French. J.
E. Taylor, in 1854, visited many of the huge mounds that were
scattered throughout Southern Mesopotamia in much larger

numbers than in the north, while his compatriot, William K.
Loftus, a few years previous had begun excavations, though on a small scale, at Warka, the site of the ancient city of Erech.
He also conducted some investigations at a mound Mugheir,
which acquired special interest as the supposed site of the famous Ur, the home of some of the Terahites before the
migration to Palestine. Of still greater significance were the examinations made by Sir Henry Rawlinson, in 1854, of the only considerable ruins of ancient Babylonia that remained
above the surface, the tower of Birs Nimrud, which proved to be the famous seven-staged temple as described by Herodotus. This temple was completed, as the foundation records
showed, by Nebuchadnezzar II., in the sixth century before
this era; but the beginnings of the structure belong to a
much earlier period. Another sanctuary erected by this same king was found near the tower. Subsequent researches by Hormuzd Rassam made it certain that Borsippa, the ancient name of the place where the tower and sanctuaries stood, was
a suburb of the great city of Babylon itself, which lay directly opposite on the east side of the Euphrates. The scope of the excavations continued to grow almost from year to year, and while new mounds were being attacked in the south, those in
the north, especially Koujunjik, continued to be the subject of attention.
Rassam, who has just been mentioned, was in a favorable
position, through his long residence as English consul at Mosul, for extracting new finds from the mounds in this vicinity. Besides adding more than a thousand tablets from the royal library
discovered by Layard, his most noteworthy discoveries were
the unearthing of a magnificent temple at Nimrud, and the finding of a large bronze gate at Balawat, a few miles to the northeast of Nimrud. Rassam and Rawlinson were afterwards
joined by George Smith of the British Museum, who, institut
ing a further search through the ruins of Koujunjik, Nimrud,

Kalah-Shergat, and elsewhere, made many valuable additions to the English collections, until his unfortunate death in 1876,
during his third visit to the mounds, cut him off in the prime
of a brilliant and most useful career. The English explorers extended their labors to the mounds in the south. Here it was,
principally at Abu-Habba, that they set their forces to work.
The finding of another temple dedicated to the sun-god rewarded their efforts. The foundation records showed that the
edifice was one of great antiquity, which was permitted to fall into decay and was then restored by a ruler whose date can be fixed at the middle of the ninth century B.C. The ancient
name of the place was shown to be Sippar, and the fame of the temple was such, that subsequent monarchs vied with one another in adding to its grandeur. It is estimated that the temple contained no less than three hundred chambers and halls for the archives and for the accommodation of the large body of
priests attached to this temple. In the archives many thou
sands of little clay tablets were again found, not, however, of a
literary, but of a legal character, containing records of commercial transactions conducted in ancient Sippar, such as sales of
houses, of fields, of produce, of stuffs, money loans, receipts, contracts for work, marriage settlements, and the like. The execution of the laws being in the hands of priests in ancient
Mesopotamia, the temples were the natural depositories for the official documents of the law courts. Similar collections to those of Sippar have been found in almost every mound of
Southern Mesopotamia that has been opened since the days
of Rassam. So at Djumdjuma, situated near the site of the ancient city of Babylon, some three thousand were unearthed that were added to the fast growing collections of the British Museum. At Borsippa, likewise, Rawlinson and Rassam recovered a large number of clay tablets, most of them legal
but some of them of a literary character, which proved to be
in part duplicates of those in the royal library of Ashurbana

bal. In this way, the latter's statement, that he sent his scribes
to the large cities of the south for the purpose of collecting
and copying the literature that had its rise there, met with a
striking confirmation. Still further to the south, at a mound
known as Telloh, a representative of the French government, Ernest de Sarzec, began a series of excavations in 1876, which, continued to the present day, have brought to light remains of
temples and palaces exceeding in antiquity those hitherto discovered. Colossal statues of diorite, covered with inscriptions,
the pottery, tablets and ornaments, showed that at a period as
early as 3500 B.C. civilization in this region had already reached
a very advanced stage. The systematic and thorough manner in which De Sarzec, with inexhaustible patience, explored the
ancient city, has resulted in largely extending our knowledge of the most ancient period of Babylonian history as yet known to us. The Telloh finds were forwarded to the Louvre, which in this way secured a collection from the south that formed a
worthy complement to the Khorsabad antiquities. Lastly, it is gratifying to note the share that our own country has recently taken in the great work that has furnished the
material needed for following the history of the Mesopotamian states. In 1887, an expedition was sent out under the auspi
ces of the University of Pennsylvania, to conduct excavations
at Niffer, a mound to the southeast of Babylon, situated on a branch of the Euphrates, and which was known to be the site of one of the most famous cities in this region. The Rev.
John P. Peters (now in New York), who was largely instrumental in raising the funds for the purpose, was appointed director of the expedition. Excavations were continued for
two years under Dr. Peters' personal supervision, and since
then by Mr. John H. Haynes, with most satisfactory success.
A great temple dedicated to the god Bel was discovered, and work has hitherto been confined chiefly to laying bare the various parts of the edifice. The foundation of the building

goes back to an earlier period than the ruins of Telloh. It survived the varying fortunes of the city in which it stood, and
each period of Babylonian history left its traces at Niffer
through the records of the many rulers who sought the favor
of the god by enlarging or beautifying his place of worship. The temple became a favorite spot to which pilgrims came
from all sides on the great festivals, to offer homage at the
sacred shrines. Votive offerings, in the shape of inscribed
clay cones, and little clay images of Bel and of his female
consort, were left in the temple as witnesses to the piety of the visitors. The archives were found to be well stocked with
the official legal documents dating chiefly from the period of 1700 to 1200 B.C., when the city appears to have reached the climax of its glory. Other parts of the mound were opened at different depths, and various layers which followed the chrono
logical development of the place were determined. 1 After its
destruction, the sanctity of the city was in a measure continued
by its becoming a burial-place. The fortunes of the place can thus be followed down to the ninth or the tenth century of our
era, a period of more than four thousand years. Already more than 20,000 tablets have been received at the University
of Pennsylvania, besides many specimens of pottery, bowls, jars, cones, and images, as well as gold, copper, and alabaster work. From this survey of the work done in the last decades in
exploring the long lost and almost forgotten cities of the Tigris and of the Euphrates Valley, it will be apparent that a large amount of material has been made accessible for tracing the
course of civilization in this region. Restricting ourselves to
that portion of it that bears on the religion of ancient Meso
potamia, it may be grouped under two heads, (i) literary, and
(2) archaeological. The religious texts of Ashurbanabal's

library occupy the first place in the literary group. The incantations, the prayers and hymns, lists of temples, of gods and their attributes, traditions of the creation of the world,
legends of the deities and of their relations to men, are sources
of the most direct character ; and it is fortunate that among
the recovered portions of the library, such texts are largely
represented. Equally direct are the dedicatory inscriptions set up by the kings in the temples erected to the honor of some god, and of great importance are the references to the
various gods, their attributes, their powers, and their deeds, which are found at every turn in the historical records which
the kings left behind them. Many of these records open or
close with a long prayer to some deity ; in others, prayers are
found interspersed, according to the occasion on which they were offered up. Attributing the success of their undertakings whether it be a military campaign, or the construction of some edifice, or a successful hunt to the protection offered
by the gods, the kings do not tire of singing the praises of the deity or deities as whose favorites they regarded themselves.
The gods are constantly at the monarch's side. Now we are
told of a dream sent to encourage the army on the approach of
a battle, and again of some portent which bade the king be
of good cheer. To the gods, the appeal is constantly made, and to them all good things are ascribed. From the legal docu
ments, likewise, much may be gathered bearing on the religion. The protection of the gods is invoked or their curses called down ; the oath is taken in their name ; while the manner in
which the temples are involved in the commercial life of ancient
Babylonia renders these tablets, which are chiefly valuable as
affording us a remarkable insight into the people's daily life, of importance also in illustrating certain phases of the religious organization of the country. Most significant for the position occupied by the priests, is the fact that the latter are invariably the scribes who draw up the documents.



14 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
The archaeological material furnished by the excavations
consists of the temples of the gods, their interior arrangement,
and provisions for the various religious functions ; secondly, the statues of the gods, demi-gods, and the demons, the altars
and the vessels ; and thirdly, the religious scenes, the wor
ship of some deity, the carrying of the gods in procession, the pouring of libations, the performance of rites, or the
representation of some religious symbols sculptured on the palace wall or on the foundation stone of a sacred build
ing, or cut out on the seal cylinders, used as signatures 1 and talismans.
Large as the material is, it is far from being exhausted, and, indeed, far from sufficient for illustrating all the details of the
religious life. This will not appear surprising, if it be remembered that of the more than one hundred mounds that have been
identified in the region of the Tigris and Euphrates as contain
ing remains of buried cities, only a small proportion have been explored, and of these scarcely more than a half dozen with
an approach to completeness. The soil of Mesopotamia unquestionably holds still greater treasures than those which
it has already yielded. The links uniting the most ancient
period at present, c. 4000 B.C. to the final destruction of the
Babylonian empire by Cyrus, in the middle of the sixth century B.C., are far from being complete. For entire centuries we are
wholly in the dark, and for others only a few skeleton facts
are known ; and until these gaps shall have been filled, our
knowledge of the religion of the Babylonians and Assyrians must necessarily remain incomplete. Not as incomplete, indeed, as their history, for religious rites are not subject to
many changes, and the progress of religious ideas does not keep pace with the constant changes in the political kaleido
scope of a country ; but, it is evident that no exhaustive treat

SOURCES AND METHODS OF STUDY. 15
ment of the religion can be given until the material shall have
become adequate to the subject.
III.
Before proceeding to the division of the subject in hand, some explanation is called for of the method by which the literary material found beneath the soil has been made intel
ligible. The characters on the clay tablets and cylinders, on the
limestone slabs, on statues, on altars, on stone monuments,
are generally known as cuneiform, because of their wedgeshaped appearance, though it may be noted at once that in their oldest form the characters are linear rather than wedge
shaped, presenting the more or less clearly defined outlines
of objects from which they appear to be derived. At the time when these cuneiform inscriptions began to be found
in Mesopotamia, the language which these characters expressed was still totally unknown. Long previous to the beginning
of Botta's labors, inscriptions also showing the cuneiform characters had been found at Persepolis on various monuments of the ruins and tombs still existing at that place. The
first notice of these inscriptions was brought to Europe by a famous Italian traveler, Pietro della Valle, in the beginning of the seventeenth century. For a long time it was doubted whether the characters represented anything more than mere
ornamentation, and it was not until the close of the last century,
after more accurate copies of the Persepolitan characters had
been furnished through Carsten Niebuhr, that scholars began
to apply themselves to their decipherment. Through the efforts chiefly of Gerhard Tychsen, professor at Kostock,
Frederick Miinter, a Danish scholar, and the distinguished Silvestre de Sacy of Paris, the beginnings were made which
finally led to the discovery of the key to the mysterious writings,



16 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
in 1802, by Georg Friedrich Grotefend, a teacher at a public school in Gottingen. The observation was made previous
to the days of Grotefend that the inscriptions at Persepolis invariably showed three styles of writing. While in all three the characters were composed of wedges, yet the combination
of wedges, as well as their shape, differed sufficiently to make
it evident, even to the superficial observer, that there was as much difference between them as, say, between the English and the German script. The conclusion was drawn that the
three styles represented three languages, and this conclusion was strikingly confirmed when, upon the arrival of Botta's finds
in Europe, it was seen that one of the styles corresponded to the inscriptions found at Khorsabad ; and so in all subsequent
discoveries in Mesopotamia, this was found to be the case.
One of the languages, therefore, on the monuments of Persepolis was presumably identical with the speech of ancient Mesopo
tamia. Grotefend's key to the reading of that style of cunei
form writing which invariably occupied the first place when the three styles were ranged one under the other, or occupied the most prominent place when a different arrangement was adopted, met with universal acceptance. He determined that
the language of the style which, for the sake of convenience, we
may designate as No. i, was Old Persian, the language spoken by the rulers, who, it was known through tradition and notices
in classical writers, had erected the series of edifices at Persep
olis, one of the capitols of the Old Persian or, as it is also called,
the Achaemenian empire. By the year 1840 the decipherment of these Achaemenian inscriptions was practically complete, the
inscriptions had been read, the alphabet was definitely settled, and the grammar, in all but minor points, known. It was
possible, therefore, in approaching the Mesopotamian style of cuneiform, which, as occupying the third place, may be designated as No. 3, to use No. i as a guide, since it was only
legitimate to conclude that Nos. 2 and 3 represented transla



SOURCES AND METHODS OF STUDY. 17
tions of No. i into two languages, which, by the side of Old
Persian, were spoken by the subjects of the Achaemenian kings. That one of these languages should have been the current
speech of Mesopotamia was exactly what was to be expected, since Babylonia and Assyria formed an essential part of the
Persian empire. The beginning was made with proper names, the sound of which would necessarily be the same or very similar in both,
or, for that matter, in all the three languages of the Persepolitan
inscriptions. 1 In this way, by careful comparisons between the
two styles, Nos. i and 3, it was possible to pick out the signs in No. 3 that corresponded to those in No. i, and inasmuch as
the same sign occurred in various names, it was, furthermore,
possible to assign, at least tentatively, certain values to the
signs in question. With the help of the signs thus determined, the attempt was made to read other words in style No. 3, in which these signs occurred, but it was some time before satis
factory results were obtained. An important advance was made when it was once determined, that the writing was a mixture of
signs used both as words and as syllables, and that the language on the Assyrian monuments belonged to the group known as Semitic. The cognate languages chiefly Hebrew and Arabic formed a help towards determining the meaning of the words
read and an explanation of the morphological features they presented. For all that, the task was one of stupendous proportions, and many were the obstacles that had to be
overcome, before the principles underlying the cuneiform writing were determined, and the decipherment placed on a firm and scientific basis. This is not the place to enter upon a detailed
illustration of the method adopted by ingenious scholars,
1 Besides those at Persepolis, a large tri-lingual inscription was found at Behistun, near the city of Kirmenshah, in Persia, which, containing some ninety proper names, enabled Sir Henry Rawlinson definitely to establish a basis for the decipherment of the Mesopotamian inscriptions.



18 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
notably Edward Hincks, Isidor Lowenstern, Henry Rawlinson, Jules Oppert, to whose united efforts the solution of the
great problems involved is due ;
1 and it would also take too
much space, since in order to make this method clear, it would be necessary to set forth the key discovered by Grotefend for
reading the Old Persian inscriptions. Suffice it to say that the guarantee for the soundness of the conclusions reached by scholars is furnished by the consideration, that it was from
small and most modest beginnings that the decipherment
began. Step by step, the problem was advanced by dint of a
painstaking labor, the degree of which cannot easily be exaggerated, until to-day the grammar of the Babylonian-Assyrian language has been clearly set forth in all its essential particulars : the substantive and verb formation is as definitely known
as that of any other Semitic language, the general principles of the syntax, as well as many detailed points, have been
carefully investigated, and as for the reading of the cuneiform texts, thanks to the various helps at our disposal, and the further elucidation of the various principles that the Babylonians themselves adopted as a guide, the instance is a rare one when
scholars need to confess their ignorance in this particular. At
most there may be a halting between two possibilities. The
difficulties that still hinder the complete understanding of
passages in texts, arise in part from the mutilated condition in
which, unfortunately, so many of the tablets and cylinders are found, and in part from a still imperfect knowledge of the
lexicography of the language. For many a word occurring

(Chalddische Genesis, pp. 257-262). A tolerably satisfactory account in English
is furnished by B. T. A. Evetts in his work. New Light on the Bible and the Holy Land, pp. 79-129.

only once or twice, and for which neither text nor comparison
with cognate languages offers a satisfactory clue, ignorance must be confessed, or at best, a conjecture hazarded, until its more frequent occurrence enables us to settle the question
at issue. Such settlements of disputed questions are taking place all the time ; and with the activity with which the study
of the language and antiquities of Mesopotamia is being pushed by scholars in this country, in England, France, Austria, Germany, Italy, Norway, and Russia, and with the constant accession of new material through excavations and publications,
there is no reason to despair of clearing up the obscurities, still remaining in the precious texts that a fortunate chance has
preserved for us.
IV.
A question that still remains to be considered as to the ori
gin of the cuneiform writing of Mesopotamia, may properly be introduced in connection with this account of the excavations
and decipherment, though it is needless to enter into it in
detail.
The " Persian "
style of wedge-writing is a direct derivative
of the Babylonian, introduced in the times of the Achaemenians,
and it is nothing but a simplification in form and principle of the more cumbersome and complicated Babylonian. Instead of a combination of as many as ten and fifteen wedges to make one sign, we have in the Persian never more than five, and
frequently only three; and instead of writing words by syllables, sounds alone were employed, and the syllabary of several
hundred signs reduced to forty-two, while the ideographic style was practically abolished.
The second style of cuneiform, generally known as Median or
Susian, 1 is again only a slight modification of the " Persian."
1 The most recent investigations show it to have been a ' Turanian ' language. See Weissbach, Achiimeniitcn Inschriften ziveiter Art, Leipzig, 1893.



20 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
Besides these three, there is a fourth language (spoken in the
northwestern district of Mesopotamia between the Euphrates
and the Orontes), known as "Mitanni," the exact status of which has not been clearly ascertained, but which has been
adapted to cuneiform characters. A fifth variety, found on
tablets from Cappadocia, represents again a modification of the
ordinary writing met with in Babylonia. In the inscriptions of Mitanni, the writing is a mixture of ideographs and syllables,
just as in Mesopotamia, while the so-called " Cappadocian " tablets are written in a corrrupt Babylonian, corresponding in degree to the "corrupt" forms that the signs take on. In
Mesopotamia itself, quite a number of styles exist, some due to local influences, others the result of changes that took place
in the course of time. In the oldest period known, that is
from 4000 to 3000 B.C., the writing is linear rather than wedgeshaped. The linear writing is the modification that the original
pictures underwent in being adapted for engraving on stone; the wedges are the modification natural to the use of clay, though when once the wedges became the standard method,
the greater frequency with which clay as against stone came to be used, led to an imitation of the wedges by those who cut out the characters on stone. In consequence, there
developed two varieties of wedge-writing : the one that may be termed lapidary, used for the stone inscriptions, the official
historical records, and such legal documents as were prepared
with especial care ; the other cursive, occurring only on legal and commercial clay tablets, and becoming more frequent as
we approach the latest period of Babylonian writing, which extends to within a few decades of our era. In Assyria,
finally, a special variety of cuneiform developed that is easily distinguished from the Babylonian by its greater neatness and the more vertical position of the wedges.
The origin of all the styles and varieties of cuneiform writing
is, therefore, to be sought in Mesopotamia ; and within Meso



SOURCES AA'/y METHODS OF STUDY. 21
potamia, in that part of it where culture begins the extreme
south; but beyond saying that the writing is a direct development from picture writing, there is little of any definite charac
ter that can be maintained. We do not know when the
writing originated, we only know that in the oldest inscriptions
it is already fully developed.
We do not know who originated it; nor can the question be as
yet definitely answered, whether those who originated it spoke the Babylonian language, or whether they were Semites at all.
Until about fifteen years ago, it was generally supposed that the cuneiform writing was without doubt the invention of a
non-Semitic race inhabiting Babylonia at an early age, from whom the Semitic Babylonians adopted it, together with the culture that this non-Semitic race had produced. These inventors, called Sumerians by some and Akkadians by others, and Sumero-Akkadians by a third group of scholars, it was
supposed, used the " cuneiform " as a picture or '
ideographic
'
script exclusively ; and the language they spoke being agglutinative and largely monosyllabic in character, it was possible for them to stop short at this point of development. The Babylonians however, in order to adapt the writing to their language, did not content themselves with the '
picture
' method, but using the non-Semitic equivalent for their own words, employed the former as syllables, while retaining, at the same time, the
sign as an ideograph. To make this clearer by an example, the numeral ' I ' would represent the word ' one ' in their own
language, while the non-Semitic word for '
one,' which let us suppose was " ash" they used as the phonetic value of the
sign, in writing a word in which this sound occurred, as e.g., ash-es. Since each sign, in Sumero-Akkadian as well as in
Babylonian, represented some general idea, it could stand for an entire series of words, grouped ab.out this idea and associ
ated with it, 'day,' for example, being used for 'light/ 'bril
liancy,'
'
pure,' and so forth. The variety of syllabic and



22 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
ideographic values which the cuneiform characters show could thus be accounted for.
This theory, however, tempting as it is by its simplicity, cannot be accepted in this unqualified form. Advancing knowledge has made it certain that the ancient civilization,
including the religion, is Semitic in character. The assumption therefore of a purely non-Semitic culture for southern
Babylonia is untenable. Secondly, even in the oldest inscriptions found, there occur Semitic words and Semitic constructions
which prove that the inscriptions were composed by Semites. As
long, therefore, as no traces of purely non-Semitic inscription are found, we cannot go beyond the Semites in seeking for the
origin of the culture in this region. In view of this, the theory
first advanced by Prof. Joseph Hale'vy of Paris, and now supported by the most eminent of German Assyriologists, Prof. Friedrich Delitzsch, which claims that the cuneiform writing is Semitic in origin, needs to be most carefully considered. There
is' much that speaks in favor of this theory, much that may more
easily be accounted for by it, than by the opposite one, which was
originally proposed by the distinguished Nestor of cuneiform studies, Jules Oppert, and which is with some modifications
still held by the majority of scholars. 1 The question is one which
cannot be answered by an appeal to philology alone. This is the fundamental error of the advocates of the Sumero-Akka
dian theory, who appear to overlook the fact that the testimony
of archaeological and anthropological research must be confirm
atory of a philological hypothesis before it can be accepted as an indisputable fact. 2 The time however has not yet come for
these two sciences to pronounce their verdict definitely, though
it may be added that the supposition of a variety of races once
1 Besides Delitzsch, however, there are others, as Pognon, Jager, Guyard, McCurdy and Brinton, who side with Halevy. a See now Dr. Brinton's paper, " The Protohistoric Ethnography of Western Asia " (Proceed, Amer. Philos. Sec., 1895), especially pp. 18-22.



KS AND METHODS OF STUDY. 23
inhabiting Southern Mesopotamia finds support in what we
know from the pre-historic researches of anthropologists. Again, it is not to be denied that the theory of the Semitic origin of the cuneiform writing encounters obstacles that cannot
easily be set aside. While it seeks to explain the syllabic values
of the signs on the general principle that they represent elements of Babylonian words, truncated in this fashion in order
to answer to the growing need for phonetic writing of words
for which no ideographs existed, it is difficult to imagine, as
Halevy's theory demands, that the " ideographic "
style, as found chiefly in religious texts, is the deliberate invention of
priests in their desire to produce a method of conveying their ideas that would be regarded as a mystery by the laity, and
be successfully concealed from the latter. Here again the
theory borders on the domain of archaeology, and philology alone will not help us out of the difficulty. An impartial verdict of the present state of the problem might be summed up as follows:
1. It is generally admitted that all the literature of
Babylonia, including the oldest and even that written in
the " ideographic "
style, whether we term it " Sumero
Akkadian " or " hieratic," is the work of the Semitic settlers
of Mesopotamia.
2. The culture, including the religion of Babylonia, is likewise a Semitic production, and since Assyria received its cul
ture from Babylonia, the same remark holds good for entire
Mesopotamia. 3. The cuneiform syllabary is largely Semitic in character.
The ideas expressed by the ideographic values of the signs give no evidence of having been produced in non-Semitic
surroundings ; and, whatever the origin of the system may be, it has been so shaped by the Babylonians, so thoroughly adapted to their purposes, that it is to all practical purposes Semitic.



24 HA />' YL ONIAN-ASS YK1AN KEL 1C,ION.
4. Approached from the theoretical side, there remains, after making full allowance for the Semitic elements in the
system, a residuum that has not yet found a satisfactory explanation, either by those who favor the non-Semitic theory or by those who hold the opposite view.
5. Pending further light to be thrown upon this question, through the expected additions to our knowledge of the archae
ology and of the anthropological conditions of ancient pre
historic Mesopotamia, philological research must content itself
with an acknowledgment of its inability to reach a conclusion
that will appeal so forcibly to all minds, as to place the solution
of the problem beyond dispute. 6. There is a presumption in favor of assuming a mixture
of races in Southern Mesopotamia at an early day, and a
possibility, therefore, that the earliest form of picture writing in this region, from which the Babylonian cuneiform is derived, may have been used by a non-Semitic population, and that
traces of this are still apparent in the developed system after
the important step had been taken, marked by the advance from
picture to phonetic writing. The important consideration for our purpose is, that the
religious conceptions and practices as they are reflected in the literary sources now at our command, are distinctly Babylonian. With this we may rest content, and, leaving theories aside,
there will be no necessity in an exposition of the religion of the Babylonians and Assyrians to differentiate or to attempt to differentiate between Semitic and so-called non- Semitic
elements. Local conditions and the long period covered
by the development and history of the religion in question, are the factors that suffice to account for the mixed and
in many respects complicated phenomena which this religion presents. Having set forth the sources at our command for the study
of the Babylonian-Assyrian religion, and having indicated the



SOURCES AND METHODS <)/<' STUDY. 25
manner in which these sources have been made available for
our purposes, we are prepared to take the next step that will
fit us for an understanding of the religious practices that prevailed in Mesopotamia, a consideration of the land and
of its people, together with a general account of the history of the latter.



CHAPTER II.
THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE.
I.
THE Babylonians and Assyrians with whom we are concerned in this volume dwelt in the region embraced by the
Euphrates and the Tigris, the Babylonians in the south, or the Euphrates Valley, the Assyrians to the northeast, in the region extending from the Tigris into the Kurdish Mountain
districts ; while the northwestern part of Mesopotamia the
northern half of the Euphrates district was the seat of various
empires that were alternately the rivals and the subjects of either Babylonia or Assyria. The entire length of Babylonia was about 300 miles ; the greatest breadth about 125 miles. The entire surface area
was some 23,000 square miles, or about the size of West
Virginia. The area of Assyria, with a length of 350 miles and a breadth varying from 170 to 300 miles, covered 75,000 square miles, which would make it somewhat smaller than the state of Nebraska. In the strict sense, the term Mesopotamia should
be limited to the territory lying between the Euphrates and
the Tigris above their junction, in the neighborhood of Baghdad, and extending northwards to the confines of the
Taurus range ; while the district to the south of Baghdad, and
reaching to the Persian Gulf, may more properly be spoken of as the Euphrates Valley ; and a third division is represented by the territory to the east of the Tigris, from Baghdad, and up to the Kurdish Mountains ; but while this distinction is one
that may be justly maintained, in view of the different charac
ter that the southern valley presents from the northern plain,



'///A' LAND AND THE PEOPLE 27
it has become so customary, in popular parlance, to think of the
entire territory along and between the Euphrates and Tigris as one country, that the term Mesopotamia in this broad sense
may be retained, with the division suggested by George Rawlinson, into Upper and Lower Mesopotamia. The two streams, as they form the salient traits of the region, are the factors
that condition the character of the inhabitants and the culture
that once flourished there. The Euphrates, or, to give the
more correct pronunciation, Purat, signifies the * river ' par
excellence. It is a quiet stream, flowing along in majestic dignity almost from its source, in the Armenian mountains,
not far from the town of Erzerum, until it is joined by the
Tigris in the extreme south. As the Shatt-el Arab, z>., Arabic
River, the two reach the Persian Gulf. Receiving many
tributaries as long as it remains in the mountains, it flows
first in a westerly direction, as though making direct for the
Mediterranean Sea, then, veering suddenly to the southeast, it receives but few tributaries after it once passes through the
Taurus range into the plain, on the right side, only the Sadschur, on the left the Balichus and the Khabur. From
this point on for the remaining distance of 800 miles, so far
from receiving fresh accessions, it loses in quantity through the marsh beds that form on both sides. When it reaches the
alluvial soil of Babylonia proper, its current and also its
depth are considerably diminished through the numerous canals that form an outlet for its waters. Of its entire length,
1780 miles, it is navigable only for a small distance, cataracts forming a hindrance in its northern course and sandbanks in the south. In consequence, it never became at any time an important avenue for commerce ; and besides rafts, which could be floated down to a certain distance, the only means of communication ever used were wicker baskets coated within and
without with bitumen, or some form of a primitive ferry for passing from one shore to another.



28 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
An entirely different stream is the Tigris a corrupted form
of ' Idiklat.'' It is only 1 146 miles in length, and is marked, as
the native name indicates, by the ' swiftness ' of its flow. Start
ing, like the Euphrates, in the rugged regions of Armenia, it continues its course through mountain clefts for a longer
period, and joined at frequent intervals by tributaries, both before it merges into the plain and after doing so, the volume
of its waters is steadily increased. Even when it approaches
the alluvial soil of the south, it does not lose its character until
well advanced in its course to the gulf. Advancing towards
the Euphrates and again receding from it, it at last joins the latter at Korna, and together they pour their waters through the Persian Gulf into the great ocean. It is navigable from
Diabekr in the north, for its entire length. Large rafts may be floated down from Mosul to Baghdad and Basra, and even small steamers have ascended as far north as Nimrud. The
Tigris, then, in contrast to the Euphrates, is the avenue of
commerce for Mesopotamia, forming the connecting bond between it and the rest of the ancient world, Egypt, Indie, and the lands of the Mediterranean. Owing, however, to the
imperfect character of the means of transportation in ancient
and, for that matter, in modern times, the voyage up the stream
was impracticable. The rafts, resting on inflated bags of goat or sheep skin, can make no headway against the rapid stream, and so, upon reaching Baghdad or Basra, they are broken up, and the bags sent back by the shore route to the north.
The contrast presented by the two rivers is paralleled by the
traits distinguishing Upper from Lower Mesopotamia. Shut off to the north and northeast by the Armenian range, to
the northwest by the Taurus, Upper Mesopotamia retains, for a considerable extent, and especially on the eastern side, a rugged aspect. The Kurdish mountains run close to the Tigris' bed for some distance below Mosul, while between the
Tigris and the Euphrates proper, small ranges and promontories



/'//A' LAND AMJ) 77/A /'AW'/./i. 29
stretch as far as the end of the Taurus chain, well on towards Mosul.
Below Mosul, the region begins to change its character. The mountains cease, the plain begins, the soil becomes alluvial
and through the regular overflow of the two rivers in the rainy
season, develops an astounding fertility. This overflow begins, in the case of the Tigris, early in March, reaches its height in May, and ceases about the middle of June. The overflow of
the Euphrates extends from the middle of March till the begin
_ning of June, but September is reached before the river resumes its natural state. Not only does the overflow of the Euphrates
thus extend over a longer period, but it oversteps its banks with
greater violence than does the Tigris, so that as far north as the
juncture with the Khabur, and still more so in the south, the
country to both sides is flooded, until it assumes the appear
ance of a great sea. Through the violence of these overflows,
changes constantly occur in the course that the river takes, so
that places which in ancient times stood on its banks are to-day
removed from the main river-bed. Another important change
in Southern Babylonia is the constant accretion of soil, due to the deposits from the Persian Gulf. This increase proceeding on an average of about one mile in
fifty years has brought it about that the two rivers to-day,
instead of passing separately into the Gulf, unite at Korna some distance still from the entrance. The contrast of seasons
is greater, as may be imagined, in Upper Mesopotamia than in the south. The winters are cold, with snowfalls that may last
for several months, but with the beginning of the dry season, in May, a tropical heat sets in which lasts until the beginning
of November, when the rain begins. Assyria proper, that is, the eastern side of Mesopotamia, is more affected by the
mountain ranges than the west. In the Euphrates Valley, the
heat during the dry season, from about May till November, when for weeks, and even months, no cloud is to be seen,

beggars description ; but strange enough, the Arabs who dwell there at present, while enduring the heat without much dis
comfort, are severely affected by a winter temperature that for Europeans and Americans is exhilarating in its influence.
From what has been said, it will be clear that the Euphrates
is, par excellence, the river of Southern Mesopotamia or Baby
lonia, while the Tigris may be regarded as the river of Assyria.
It was the Euphrates that made possible the high degree of culture, that was reached in the south. Through the very
intense heat of the dry season, the soil developed a fertility that reduced human labor to a minimum. The return for
sowing of all kinds of grain, notably wheat, corn, barley, is calculated, on/an average, to be five hundred-fold, while the date palm flourishes with scarcely any cultivation at all.
Sustenance being thus provided for with little effort, it needed
only a certain care in protecting oneself from damage through the too abundant overflow, to enable the population to find that
ease of existence, which is an indispensable condition of culture.
This was accomplished by the erection of dikes, and by direct
ing the waters through channels into the fields.
Assyria, more rugged in character, did not enjoy the same
advantages. Its culture, therefore, not only arose at a later
period than that of Babylonia, but was a direct importation from the south. It was due to the natural extension of the
civilization that continued for the greater part of the existence
of the two empires to be central in the south. But when once
Assyria was included in the circle of Babylonian culture, the
greater effort required in forcing the natural resources of the
soil, produced a greater variety in the return. Besides corn,
wheat and rice, the olive, banana and fig tree, mulberry and vine were cultivated, while the vicinity of the mountain ranges furnished an abundance of building material wood and lime
stone that was lacking in the south. The fertility of Assyria
proper, again, not being dependent on the overflow of the Tigris,



THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE. 31
proved to be of greater endurance. With the neglect of the
irrigation system, Babylonia became a mere waste, and the same river that was the cause of its prosperity became the foe
that, more effectually than any human power, contributed to the ruin and the general desolation that marks the greater
part of the Euphrates Valley at the present time. Assyria continued to play a part in history long after its ancient glory
had departed, and to this day enjoys a far greater activity, and is of considerable more significance than the south.
II.
In so far as natural surroundings affect the character of two
peoples belonging to the same race, the Assyrians present that contrast to the Babylonians which one may expect from the
differences, just set forth, between the two districts. The
former were rugged, more warlike, and when they acquired
power, used it in the perfection of their military strength ; the latter, while not lacking in the ambition to extend their dominion,
yet, on the whole, presented a more peaceful aspect that led to the cultivation of commerce and industrial arts. Both, how
ever, have very many more traits in common than they have
marks of distinction. They both belong not only to the
Semitic race, but to the same branch of the race. Present
ing the same physical features, the languages spoken by them are identical, barring differences that do not always rise to
the degree of dialectical variations, and affect chiefly the pronunciation of certain consonants. At what time the Baby
lonians and Assyrians settled in the district in which we find
them, whence they came, and whether the Euphrates Valley or the northern Tigris district was the first to be settled, are
questions that cannot, in the present state of knowledge, be answered. As to the time of their settlement, the high degree
of culture that the Euphrates Valley shows at the earliest



32 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
period known to us, about 4000 B.C., and the indigenous
character of this culture, points to very old settlement, and makes it easier to err on the side of not going back far enough,
than on the side of going too far. Again, while, as has been
several times intimated, the culture in the south is older than
that of the north, it does not necessarily follow that the settle
ment of Babylonia antedates that of Assyria. The answer to
this question would depend upon the answer to the question as to the original home of the Semites. 1 The probabilities,
however, are in favor of assuming a movement of population, as of culture, from the south to the north. At all events,
the history of Babylonia and Assyria begins with the former, and as a consequence we are justified also in beginning with that phase of the religion for which we have the earliest records,
the Babylonian.
III.
At the very outset of a brief survey of the history of the
Babylonians, a problem confronts us of primary importance. Are there any traces of other settlers besides the Semitic
Babylonians in the earliest period of the history of the Euphrates Valley ? Those who cling to the theory of a non-Semitic origin
of the cuneiform syllabary will, of course, be ready to answer in the affirmative. Sumerians and Akkadians are the names
given to these non-Semitic settlers who preceded the Baby
lonians in the control of the Euphrates Valley. The names are derived from the terms Sumer and Akkad, which are
frequently found in Babylonian and Assyrian inscriptions, in connection with the titles of the kings. Unfortunately, scholars
are not a unit in the exact location of the districts comprised by these names, some declaring Sumer to be in the north and
1 I may be permitted to refer to a publication by Dr. Brinton and myself, The Cradle of the Semites (Philadelphia, 1889), in which the various views as to this home are set forth.



THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE. 33
Akkad in the south ; others favoring the reverse position.
The balance of proof rests in favor of the former supposition ; but however that may be, Sumer and Akkad represent, from
a certain period on, a general designation to include the whole of Babylonia. Professor Hommel goes so far as to declare that in the types found on statues and monuments of the oldest
period of Babylonian history the monuments coming from the mound Telloh we have actual representations of these Sumerians, who are thus made out to be a smooth-faced race
with rather prominent cheek-bones, round faces, and shaven heads. 1 He pronounces in favor of the highlands lying to the east of Babylonia, as the home of the Sumerians, whence they
made their way into the Euphrates Valley. Unfortunately, the noses on these old statues are mutilated, and with such an
important feature missing, anthropologists, at least, are unwill
ing to pronounce definitely as to the type represented. Again, together with these supposed non-Semitic types, other figures have been found which, as Professor Hommel also admits,
show the ordinary Semitic features. It would seem, therefore,
that even accepting the hypothesis of a non-Semitic type
existing in Babylonia at this time, the Semitic settlers are
just as old as the supposed Sumerians ; and since it is admitted
that the language found on these statues and figures contains Semitic constructions and Semitic words, it is, to say the least,
hazardous to give the Sumerians the preference over the Semites
so far as the period of settlement and origin of the Euphratean culture is concerned. As a matter of fact, we are not warranted
in going beyond the statement that all evidence points in favor
of a population of mixed races in the Euphrates Valley from the
earliest period known to us. No positive proof is forthcoming that Sumer and Akkad were ever employed or understood in
any other sense than as geographical terms.
1 It has been suggested that since the statues of Telloh are those of the priestkings, only the priestly classes shaved their hair off.



34 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
This one safe conclusion, however, that the Semitic settlers
of Babylonia were not the sole occupants, but by their side
dwelt another race, or possibly a variety of races, possessing entirely different traits, is one of considerable importance. At various times the non-Semitic hordes of Elam and the mountain
districts to the east of Babylonia swept over the valley, and
succeeded, for a longer or shorter period, in securing a firm foothold. The ease with which these conquerors accommodated
themselves to their surroundings, continuing the form of government which they found there, making but slight changes in the religious practices, can best be accounted for on the
supposition that the mixture of different races in the valley
had brought about an interchange and interlacing of traits which resulted in the approach of one type to the other.
Again, it has recently been made probable that as early at least as 2000, or even 2500 B.C., Semitic invaders entering Babylonia from the side of Arabia drove the native Babylonian rulers from the throne ;
l and at a still earlier period inter
course between Babylonia and distant nations to the northeast
and northwest was established, which left its traces on the
political and social conditions. At every point we come across
evidence of this composite character of Babylonian culture, and
the question as to the origin of the latter may, after all, resolve
itself into the proposition that the contact of different races
gave the intellectual impetus which is the first condition of a
forward movement in civilization ; and while it is possible that, at one stage, the greater share in the movement falls to the non-Semitic contingent, the Semites soon obtained the intellectual ascendency, and so absorbed the non-Semitic elements
as to give to the culture resulting from the combination, the homogeneous character it presents on the surface.

THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE. 35
IV.
Our present knowledge of Babylonian history reaches back to the period of about 4000 B.C. At that time we find the
Euphrates Valley divided into a series of states or principali
ties, parcelling North and South Babylonia between them.
These states group themselves around certain cities. In fact,
the Babylonian principalities arise from the extension of the
city's jurisdiction, just as the later Babylonian empire is naught but the enlargement, on a greater scale, of the city of Babylon. Of these old Babylonian cities the most noteworthy, in the
south, are Eridu, Lagash, 1 Ur, Larsa, Uruk, Ism; and in the
north, Agade, Sippar, Nippur, Kutha, and Babylon. The rulers of these cities call themselves either 'king' (literally 'great man ') or '
governor,' according as the position is a purely independent one, or one of subjection to a more powerful chieftain. Thus the earliest rulers of the district of Lagash, of whom we
have inscriptions (c. 3200 B.C.) have the title of 'king,' but a few centuries later Lagash lost its independent position and its rulers became '
paresis,' i.e., governors. They are in a position of vassalage, as it would appear, to the contemporaneous kings of Ur, though this does not hinder them from en
gaging in military expeditions against Elam, and in extensive building operations. The kings of Ur, in addition to their title as kings of Ur, are styled kings of Sumer and Akkad. Whether at this time, Sumer and Akkad included the whole
of Babylonia, or, as seems more likely, only the southern part, in either case, Lagash would fall under the jurisdiction of
these kings, if their title is to be regarded as more than an
empty boast. Again, the rulers of Uruk are known simply as
kings of that place, while those of Isin incorporate in their
titles, kingship over Ur as well as Sumer and Akkad.
1 Also known as Shirpurla which ^snsen (Keils Bib1. 3, i, 5) thinks was the later name.



36 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
For this early period, extending from about 4000 B.C. to 2300, the chronology is as yet uncertain. Beyond the titles
of the rulers over Babylonian states, there are but few safe
indications for determining the succession of dynasties. So much, however, is now certain, that simultaneous with the
governors of Lagash and the older kings of Ur, there was an
independent state in Northern Babylonia with its seat at Agade. Indeed the history of this state can now be traced back
six centuries beyond that of Lagash. Two rulers of Agade,
Naram-Sin (c. 3800 B.C.) and Sargon (or to give his fuller name, Shargani-shar-ali *), are the earliest rulers as yet known. These
kings of Agade extended their jurisdiction as far north, at least, as Nippur on the one side and Sippar on the other.
The city of Babylon itself, if it existed at this period, was therefore included within the territory of these kings; and it
follows that if there existed rulers of Babylon at this time,
which is doubtful (since the city is not mentioned), they were
in the same position of dependency upon the rulers of Agade as the '
governors
' of Lagash were upon some greater power. It is not until about the middle of the third millennium before
this era, that Babylon comes into prominence. In the south, as already intimated, the rulers of Lagash and the dynasty of Ur are the earliest of which we have any
record. There is every reason to believe that further excava
tions at Mugheir will bring to light the names of older kings,
and the presumption is in favor of regarding the southern
states, or at least some of them, earlier than any in the north.
The climax in the power of the kings of Ur, the period when
1 See Hilprecht, Old Babylonian Inscriptions, i. 16-18. Naram-Sin signifies ' beloved of the god Sin ' (the moon-god) ; Shargani-shar-ali
' the legitimate king, king of the city.' The excavations of the University of Pennsylvania have cast new light upon this most ancient period of Babylonian history. It is now known that the temple of Bel at Nippur antedates the reign of Naram-Sin, and in the further publications of the University, we may look for material which will enable us to pass beyond the period of Sargon,



Till': LAND AND THE rKOPLK. 37
they exerted, in fact as well as in name, the sovereignty over all Sumer and Akkad may be fixed approximately at 3000 B.C.
How far we shall be able to go beyond that, for the beginnings
of this state, must, for the present, remain doubtful, with the chances in favor of a considerably earlier date ; and it may
be that prior to Ur and Lagash there were dynasties estab
lished elsewhere, at Eridu, perhaps, the existence of which
will be revealed by future discoveries. An independent state
with its seat at Uruk follows upon the culminating period of the
glory of Ur, and may be regarded, indeed, as an indication that the rulers of Ur had lost their control over the whole of South
ern Babylonia. Isin, whose site has not yet been determined, but which lay probably to the north of Uruk, was another
political center. Its rulers, so far as we know them, curiously assign the fourth place to the title *
king of Isin,' giving prece
dence to their control over Nippur, Eridu, and Uruk. We may conclude from this, that at the time when Isin extended its
supremacy, the greater luster attaching to the old towns of Nippur and Uruk, was emphasized by the precedence given to these centers over Isin, although the Isin kings are only
'
shepherds ' and ' merciful lords ' over Nippur and Uruk, and
not kings. At a subsequent period, the kings of Ur appear to have regained the supremacy, which was wrested from them by Isin ;
and the rulers of the latter acknowledge their dependence upon
the kings of Ur. This so-called second dynasty of Ur in
cludes Nippur. The kings are proud of calling themselves the guardians of the temple of Bel in Nippur, nominated to the
office by the god himself, and reviving an old title of the kings of
Agade, style themselves also '
king of the four regions.' Another
change in the political horoscope is reflected in the subjection of Ur to a district whose center was Larsa, not far from Ur, and
represented by the mound Senkereh. There are two kings, Nur-Ramman (?>., light of Ramman) and Sin-iddina (/.<?., Sin



38 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
judges), who call themselves guardians of Ur and kings of
Larsa, showing that the center of this principality was Larsa, with Ur as a dependent district. That these rulers take up
the dominion once held by the kings of Ur is further manifest
in the additional title that they give to themselves, as 'kings of Sumer and Akkad,' whereas the omission of the title '
king of the four regions
' indicates apparently the exclusion of Agade
and Nippur; and with these, probably North Babylonia in general, from their supremacy. The power of Larsa receives a fatal check through the invasion of Babylonia fey the Elam
ites (c. 2350 B.C.). These variations in official titles are a reflection of the natu
ral rivalry existing between the various Babylonian states, which
led to frequent shiftings in the political situation. Beyond this,
the inscriptions of these old Babylonian rulers, being ordinarily commemorative of the dedication to a deity, of some temple or other construction notably canals or of some votive
offering, a cone or tablet, unfortunately tell us little of the events of the time. Pending the discovery of more complete annals, we must content ourselves with the general indications
of the civilization that prevailed, and of the relations in which
the principalities stood to one another, and with more or less doubtful reconstructions of the sequence in the dynasties. In
all of this period, however, the division between North and
South Babylonia was kept tolerably distinct, even though occasionally, and for a certain period, a North Babylonian city, like that of Agade and Nippur, extended its jurisdiction over
a section bordering on the south and vice versa. It remained
for a great conqueror, Hammurabi, the sixth king of a dynasty having its seat in the city of Babylon itself, who about the year 2300 B.C. succeeded in uniting North and Sotith Babylonia
under one rule. With him, therefore, a new epoch in the history
of the Euphrates Valley begins. Henceforth the supremacy of the city of Babylon remains undisputed, and the other



Tim LAND AN'D THE PEOPLE. 39
ancient centers, losing their political importance, retain their
significance only by virtue of the sanctuaries existing there, to which pilgrimages continued to be made, and through the commercial activity that, upon the union of the various Baby
lonian districts, set in with increased vigor. Attention was directed a few years ago by Pognon and Sayce
to the fact that the name of Hammurabi, as well as of four
kings that preceded him, and of a number that followed, are
not Babylonian. Sayce expressed the opinion that they were Arabic, and Professor Hommel has recently reenforced the
position of Sayce by showing the close resemblance existing between these names and those found on the monuments of Southern Arabia. 1 While no evidence has as yet been found to warrant us in carrying back the existence of the Minean
empire in Southern Arabia beyond 1500 B.C., still since at this
period, this empire appears in a high state of culture, with commercial intercourse established between it and Egypt, as well as Palestine, the conclusion drawn by Hommel that
Babylonia was invaded about 2500 B.C. by an Arabic-speaking people is to be seriously considered. Elam, as we have seen,
was constantly threatening Babylonia from the East, and shortly before Hammurabi's appearance, succeeded in putting an end to the dynasty of Larsa. It now appears that the inhabitants
of the Euphrates Valley were also threatened by an enemy lodged somewhere in the southwest. Though HommePs hypo
thesis still needs confirmation, and may perhaps be somewhat modified by future researches, still so much seems certain : that
the great union of the Babylonian states and the supremacy of
the city of Babylon itself was achieved not by Babylonians but
by foreigners who entered Babylonia from its western (or southwestern) side. The dynasty of which Hammurabi is the chief
representative comes to an end c. 2100, and is followed by an

other known as Shish-Kha,1 whose rulers likewise appear to be
foreigners; and when this dynasty finally disappears after a rule of almost four centuries, Babylonia is once more con
quered by a people coming from the northern parts of Elam and who are known as the Cassites. 2 These Cassites, of whose
origin, character, and language but little is known as yet, ruled
over Babylonia for a period of no less than 576 years; but adapting themselves to the customs and religion of the country,
their presence did not interfere with the normal progress of
culture in the Euphrates Valley. We may therefore embrace
the period of Hammurabi and his successors, down through the rule of the Cassite kings, under one head. It is a period
marked by the steady growth of culture, manifesting itself in the erection of temples, in the construction of canals, and in the expansion of commerce. Active relationships were maintained
between Babylonia and distant Egypt.
This movement did not suffer an interruption through the
invasion of the Cassites. Though Nippur, rather than Babylon,
appears to have been the favorite city of the dynasty, the course
of civilization flows on uninterruptedly, and it is not until the
growing complications between Babylonia and Assyria, due to the steady encroachment on the part of the latter, that decided
changes begin to take place. About 1500 B.C. the first traces of relationship between
Babylonia and the northern Mesopotamian power, Assyria, appear. These relations were at first of a friendly character,
but it is not long before the growing strength of Assyria becomes a serious menace to Babylonia. In the middle of
the thirteenth century, Assyrian arms advance upon the city of
Babylon. For some decades, Babylon remains in subjection to

Assyria, and although she regains her independence once more, and even a fair measure of her former glory, the power of the Cassites is broken. Internal dissensions add to the
difficulties of the situation and lead to the overthrow of the
Cassites (1151 B.C.). Native Babylonians once more occupy the throne, who, although able to check the danger still threat
ening from Elam, cannot resist the strong arms of Assyria.
At the close of the twelfth century Tiglathpileser I. secures a
firm hold upon Babylonia, which now sinks to the position of a
dependency upon the Assyrian kings.
V.
In contrast to Babylonia, which is from the start stamped
as a civilizing power, Assyria, from its rise till its fall, is
essentially a military empire, seeking the fulfillment of its mission in the enlargement of power and in incessant warfare.
Its history may be traced back to about 1800 B.C., when its
rulers, with their seat in the ancient city of Ashur, first begin
to make their presence felt. The extension of their power pro
ceeds, as in Babylonia, from the growing importance of the central city, and soon embraces all of Assyria proper. They pass on into the mountain regions to the east, and advanc
ing to the west, they encounter the vigorous forces of Egypt, whose Asiatic campaigns begin about the same time as the
rise of Assyria. The Egyptians, abetted by the Hittites the
possessors of the strongholds on the Orontes successfully check the growth of Assyria on this side, at least for a period
of several centuries. In the meanwhile, the Assyrian king
gathers strength enough to make an attack upon Babylonia. The conflict, once begun, continues, as has been indicated,
with varying fortunes. Occasional breathing spells are brought about by a temporary agreement of peace between the two empires, until at the end of the twelfth century, Assyria,



42 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
under Tiglathpileser I., secures control over the Babylonian
empire. Her kings add to their long list of titles that of
'ruler of Babylonia.' They either take the government of the south into their hands or exercise the privilege of appoint
ing a governor of their choice to regulate the affairs of the
Euphrates Valley. From this time on, the history of Babylonia and Assyria may be viewed under a single aspect. The
third period of Babylonian history the second of Assyrian
history thus begins about uoo B.C., and continues till the
fall of Assyria in the year 606 B.C. These five centuries
represent the most glorious epoch of the united Mesopotamian empire. During this time, Assyria rises to the height of an
all-embracing power. With far greater success than Egypt, she
securely established her sovereignty over the lands bordering on the Mediterranean. After severe struggles, the Hittites
are overcome, the names of their strongholds on the Orontes
changed, in order to emphasize .their complete possession by
the Assyrians, and the principalities of Northern Syria become tributary to Assyria. Phoenicia and the kingdom of Israel are
conquered, while the southern kingdom of Judah purchases a mere shadow of independence by complete submission to the
conditions imposed by the great and irresistible monarchy. Far to the northeast Assyria extends her sway, while Baby
lonia, though occasionally aroused to a resistance of the
tyrannical bonds laid upon her, only to be still further weak
ened, retains a distinctive existence chiefly in name. The
culture of the south is the heritage bequeathed by old Babylonia to the north. Babylonian temples become the models
for Assyrian architecture. The literary treasures in the
archives of the sacred cities of the south are copied by the
scribes of the Assyrian kings, and placed in the palaces of the latter. Meanwhile, the capitol of Assyria moves towards the
north. Ashur gives way under the glorious reign of Ashurnasirbal to Calah, which becomes the capitol in the year 880 B.C. ;



TI1K LANJ) AND TI1K PEOPLE. 43
and Calah, in turn, yields to Nineveh, which becomes, from the time of Tiglathpileser II., in the middle of the eighth
century, the center of the great kingdom. Under Ashurbana
bal, who rules from 668 to 626 B.C., the climax of Assyrian power is reached. He carries his arms to the banks of the Nile, and succeeds in realizing the dreams of his ancestors of a
direct control over the affairs of Egypt. A patron of science
and literature, as so many great conquerors, Ashurbanabal succeeds in making Nineveh a literary as well as a military center.
A vast collection of the cuneiform literature of Babylonia is
gathered by him for the benefit of his subjects, as he is at
constant pains to tell us. The city is further embellished with
magnificent structures, and on every side he establishes his
sovereignty with such force, that the might of Assyria appears invincible. The fatal blow, dealt with a suddenness that
remains a mystery, came from an unexpected quarter. A great movement of wild northern hordes, rather vaguely known as the Cimmerians and Scythians, and advancing towards the
south, set in shortly after the death of Ashurbanabal, and created great political disturbances. The vast number of these hordes, their muscular strength, and their unrestrained cruelty, made them a foe which Assyria found as hard to withstand, as Rome the approach of the Vandals and Goths.
The sources for our knowledge of the last days of the Assyrian
empire are not sufficient to enable us to grasp the details, but
it is certain that the successful attempt of the Babylonians to
throw off the Assyrian yoke almost immediately after Ashurbanabal's death, was a symptom of the ravages which the hordes
made in reducing the vitality of the Assyrian empire. Her foes gained fresh courage from the success that crowned the revolt of Babylonia. The Medes, a formidable nation to the east of Assyria, and which had often crossed arms with the Assyrians, entered into combination with Babylonia, and the
two making several united assaults upon Nineveh, under the



44 BABYLONTAN-ASSYIUAN RELIGION.
leadership of Kyaxares, at last succeeded in effecting an entrance. The city was captured and burned to the ground.
With the fall of Assyria, a feeling of relief passed over the
entire eastern world. A great danger, threatening to extinguish the independence of all of the then known nations of the globe,
was averted. The Hebrew prophets living at the time of this
downfall, voice the general rejoicing that ensued when they declared, that even the cedars of Lebanon leaped for joy.
The province of Assyria proper, fell into the hands of the
Medes, but Babylonia, with her independence established on a firm footing, was the real heir of Assyria's spirit. Her most
glorious monarch, Nebuchadnezzar II. (604-561 B.C.), seems to have dreamed of gaining for Babylon the position, once held by Nineveh, of mistress of the world. Taking Ashurbanabal as
his model, he carried his arms to the west, subdued the
kingdom of Judah, and, passing on to Egypt, strove to secure for Babylon, the supremacy exercised there for a short time by
Assyrian monarchs. In addition to his military campaigns, however, he also appears in the light of a great builder, enlar
ging and beautifying the temples of Babylonia, erecting new ones in the various cities of his realm, strengthening the walls
of Babylon, adorning the capital with embankment works and
other improvements, that gave it a permanent place in the traditions of the ancient world as one of the seven wonders of
the universe.
The glory of this second Babylonian empire was of short
duration. Its vaulting ambition appears to have overleaped
itself. Realizing for a time the Assyrian ideal of a world
monarchy, the fall was as sudden as its rise was unexpected. Internal dissensions gave the first indication of the hollowness of the state. Nebuchadnezzar's son was murdered in 560 B.C.,
within two years after reaching the throne, by his own brother
in-law, Neriglissar ; and the latter dying after a reign of only four years, his infant child was put out of the way and Nabon



<: LAND AND THE /'AY >/'/,/<.. 4.S
nedos, a nigh officer of the state, but without royal prerogative, mounted the throne. In the year 550 news reached Babylon
that Cyrus, the king of Anzan, had dealt a fatal blow to the
Median empire, capturing its king, Astyages, and joining Media to his own district. He founded what was afterwards known as the Persian empire.
The overthrow of the Medes gave Cyrus control over Assyria, and it was to be expected that his gaze should be turned in the
direction of Babylonia. Nabonnedos recognized the danger, but all his efforts to strengthen the powers of resistance to the Persian arms were of no avail. Civil disturbances divided the
Babylonians. The cohesion between the various districts was
loosened, and within the city of Babylon itself, a party arose
antagonistic to Nabonnedos, who in their short-sightedness hailed the advance of Cyrus. Under these circumstances,
Babylon fell an easy prey to the Persian conqueror. In the autumn of the year 539 Cyrus entered the city in triumph, and was received with such manifestations of joy by the populace, as
to make one almost forget that with his entrance, the end of a
great empire had come. Politically and religiously, the history of Babylonia and Assyria terminates with the advent of Cyrus ;
and this despite the fact that it was his policy to leave the state
of affairs, including religious observances, as far as possible,
undisturbed. A new spirit had, however, come into the land
with him. The official religion of the state was that practiced
by Cyrus and his predecessors in their native land. The
essential doctrines of the religion, commonly known as Maz
deism or Zoroastrianism, presented a sharp contrast to the beliefs that still were current in Babylonia, and it was inevit
able that with the influx of new ideas, the further development
of Babylonian worship was cut short. The respect paid by Cyrus to the Babylonian gods was a mere matter of policy. Still, the religious rites continued to be practiced as of old in
Babylonia and Assyria for a long time, and when the religion



46 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELJGION.
finally disappeared, under the subsequent conquests of the Greeks, Romans, and Arabs, it left its traces in the popular superstitions and in the ineradicable traditions that survived.
But so far as the history of this religion is concerned, it comes to an end with the downfall of the second Babylonian
empire.
The period, then, to be covered by a treatment of the
religion of the Babylonians and Assyrians extends over the long interval between about 4000 B.C. and the middle of the
sixth century. The development of this religion follows closely the course of civilization and of history in the territory under
consideration. The twofold division, accordingly, into Baby
lonia and Assyria, is the one that suggests itself also for the
religion. The beginning, as is evident from the historical sketch given, must be made with Babylonia. It will be seen
that, while the rites there and in Assyria are much the same,
the characters of the gods as they developed in the south
were quite different from those of the north ; and, again, it was inevitable that the Assyrian influence manifest in the
second Babylonian empire should give to the religion of the south at this time, some aspects which were absent during the
days of the old Babylonian empire. In Babylonia, again, the political changes form the basis for the transformation to be
observed in the position occupied by the deities at different
periods ; and the same general remark applies to the deities peculiar to Assyria, who must be studied in connection with
the course pursued by the Assyrian empire. The division of the subject which thus forces itself upon us
is twofold, (i) geographical, and (2) historical. It will be necessary to treat first of the beliefs and pan
theon developed during the first two periods of Babylonian history, down to the practical conquest of Babylonia by



Till'. LAND AND Till'. /V<;6>/Y,/<. 47
Assyria. Then, turning to Assyria, the traits of the pantheon peculiar to Upper Mesopotamia will be set forth. In the third
place, the history of the religion will be traced in Babylonia
during the union of the Babylonian- Assyrian empire ; and, lastly, the new phases of that religion which appeared in the days of the second Babylonian empire. Turning after this to other aspects of the religion, it will be found that the religious
rites were only to a small degree influenced by political changes, while the literature and religious art are almost exclusively
products of Babylonia. In treating of these subjects, accordingly, no geographical divisions are called for, in setting forth their chief features.
The general estimate to be given at the close of the volume
will furnish an opportunity of making a comparison between the Babylonian-Assyrian religion and other religions of the ancient world, with a view to determining what foreign in
fluences may be detected in it, as well as ascertaining the influence it exerted upon others.



CHAPTER III.
GENERAL TRAITS OF THE OLD BABYLONIAN PANTHEON.
THE Babylonian religion in the oldest form known to us may best be described as a mixture of local and nature cults.
Starting with that phase of religious beliefs known as Animism, which has been ascertained to be practically universal in
primitive society, the Babylonians, from ascribing life to the phenomena of nature, to trees, stones, and plants, as well as to such natural events, as storm, rain, and wind, and as a matter of course to the great luminaries and to the stars would, on the
one hand, be led to invoke an infinite number of spirits who
were supposed to be, in some way the embodiment of the life that manifested itself in such diverse manners ; and yet, on
the other hand, this tendency would be restricted by the
experience which would point to certain spirits, as exercising a more decisive influence upon the affairs of man than others.
The result of this would be to give a preponderance to the worship of the sun and moon and the water, and of such
natural phenomena as rain, wind, and storms, with their accom
paniment of thunder and lightning, as against the countless
sprites believed to be lurking everywhere. The latter, however, would not for this reason be ignored altogether. Since everything was endowed with life, there was not only a spirit of the
tree which produced the fruit, but there were spirits in every
field. To them the ground belonged, and upon their mercy depended the success or failure of the produce. To secure the
favor of the rain and the sun was not sufficient to the agricul
turist ; he was obliged to obtain the protection of the guardian
spirits of the soil, in order to be sure of reaping the fruit of his



TRAITS OF THE OLD BABYLONIAN PANTHEON. 49
labors. Again, when through association, the group of arable
plots grew into a hamlet, and then through continued growth into a town, the latter, regarded as a unit by virtue of its
political organization under a chief ruler, would necessarily be supposed to have some special power presiding over its desti
nies, protecting it from danger, and ready to defend the rights and privileges of those who stood immediately under its juris
diction. Each Babylonian city, large or small, would in this way obtain a deity devoted to its welfare, and as the city grew
in extent, absorbing perhaps others lying about, and advancing in this way to the dignity of a district, the city's god would
correspondingly increase his jurisdiction. As it encroached upon the domain of other local deities, it would by conquest
annihilate the latter, or reduce them to a subservient position.
The new regime would be expressed by making the conquered deity, the servant of the victorious, or the two might be viewed
in the relation of father to son ; and again, in the event of a
peaceful amalgamation of two cities or districts, the protecting
deities might join hands in a compact, mirroring the partnership represented by the conjugal tie. In this way, there arose in
Babylon a selection, as it were, out of an infinite variety of personified forces, manifest or concealed, that at one time may
have been objects of worship. The uniformity of the spirit world, which is the characteristic trait of primitive Animism,
gave way to a differentiation regulated by the political development and the social growth of Babylonia. The more important natural forces became gods, and the inferior ones were, as a
general thing, relegated to the secondary position of mere sprites, like the jinns, in Arabic beliefs. Only in the case of
the guardian spirit of an entire city or district, would there result and even this not invariably an elevation to the
grade of deity, in the proper sense of the word. In many cases,
however, this guardian deity might be a heavenly body, as the moon or sun or stars, all of which were supposed to regulate



50 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
the fate of mankind or some force of nature, as the rain or the
storm ; and even if this were not originally the case, the pro
tecting deity might, in the course of time, become identified with one of the forces of nature ; and, if for no other reason,
simply because of the prominence which the worship of the
force in question acquired in the place. As a consequence, the mixture of local and nature cults is so complete that it is
often impossible to distinguish the one from the other. It is hard in many cases to determine whether the deity which is
identified with a certain city was originally a mere local spirit
watching over a certain restricted territory, or a personification of a natural force associated in some way with a certain section
of Babylonia.



CHAPTER IV.
BABYLONIAN GODS PRIOR TO THE DAYS OF HAMMURABI.
WITH these preliminary remarks, we may turn, as the first part of our subject, to a consideration of the oldest of the
Babylonian gods. Our main sources are the inscriptions of the old Babylonian rulers, above referred to. These are, in
most cases, of a dedicatory character, being inscribed on statues,
cylinders, or tablets, placed in the temples or on objects cones, knobs, stones presented as votive offerings to some god. Besides the inscriptions of the rulers, we have those of officials and others. Many of these are likewise connected
directly or indirectly with religious worship. The advantage of the historical texts over the purely religious
ones consists in their being dated, either accurately or approximately. For this reason, the former must be made the basis for
a rational theory of the development of the Babylonian pantheon through the various periods above instanced. The data fur
nished by the religious texts can be introduced only, as they
accord with the facts revealed by the historical inscriptions in
each period. Taking up the group of inscriptions prior to the union of the Babylonian States under Hammurabi, i.e., prior to 2300 B.C., we
find these gods mentionod : Bel, Belit, Nin-khar-sag, Nin-gir-su,
also appearing as Shul-gur, Bau, Ga-sig(?)-dug, Ea, Nin-a-gal, Nergal, Shamash, appearing also under the form Utu; A, or Malkatu, the consort of Shamash, Nannar or Sin, Nana, Anunit,
Ishtar, Innanna or Ninni, Nina, Nin-mar, Dun-shagga, Gal-alim,
Anu, Nin-gish-zida, Nin-si-a, Nin-shakh, Lugal-banda and his consort Nin-gul, Dumuzi-zu-aba, Nisaba, Ku(?)anna, Lugal
erima(?), Dagan, Ishum, Umu, Pa-sag, Nin-e-gal, and Nin-gal.



52 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
Regarding these names, it may be said at once that the read
ing, in many cases, is to be looked upon as merely provisional.
Written, as they usually are, in the ideographic "
style," the phonetic reading can only be determined when the deity in question can be identified with one, whose name is written at
some place phonetically, or when the ideographs employed are so grouped as to place the phonetic reading beyond doubt. The plan to be followed in this book will be to give the
ideographic reading 1 as provisional wherever the real pronunciation is unknown or uncertain. The ideographic designation of
a deity is of great value, inasmuch as the ideographs themselves frequently reveal the character of the god, though of course the additional advantage is obvious when the name
appears in both the ideographic and the phonetic writing. It will, therefore, form part of a delineation of the Babylonian
pantheon to interpret the picture, as it were, under which each deity is viewed.
EN-LIL OR BEL.
Taking up the gods in the order named, the first one, Bel, is also the one who appears on the oldest monuments as yet
unearthed the inscriptions of Nippur. His name is, at this
time, written invariably as En-lil. In the Babylonian theology,
he is ' the lord of the lower world.' He represents, as it were,
the unification of the various forces whose seat and sphere of
action is among the inhabited parts of the globe, both on the surface and beneath, for the term ' lower world ' is here used in
contrast to the upper or heavenly world. Such a conception
manifestly belongs to the domain of abstract thought, and it
may be concluded, therefore, that either the deity belongs to
an advanced stage of Babylonian culture, or that the original view of the deity was different from the one just mentioned.
1 Indicated by separating the syllables composing the name.



BABYLONIAN GODS. 53
The latter is the case. Primarily, the ideograph Lil is used to
designate a ' demon ' in general, and En-lil is therefore the 'chief
demon.' Primitive as such a conception is, it points to some system of thought that transcends primitive Animism, which is characterized rather by the equality accorded to all spirits. The antiquity of the association of En-lil with Nippur justifies
the conclusion that we have before us a local deity who,
originally the protecting spirit merely, of a restricted territory, acquires the position of ' chief demon ' as the town of Nippur
grows to be the capitol of a large and powerful district. The fame and sanctity of Nippur survives political vicissitudes ; and,
indeed, in proportion as Nippur loses political prestige, the great deity of the place is released from the limitations due to
his local origin and rises to the still higher dignity of a great power whose domain is the entire habitable universe. As
the ' lord of the lower world,' En-lil is contrasted to a god Anu,
who presides over the heavenly bodies. The age of Sargon
(3800 B.C.), in whose inscriptions En-lil already occurs, is one of considerable culture, as is sufficiently evidenced by the flourishing condition of art, and there can therefore be no
objection against the assumption that even at this early period, a theological system should have been evolved which gave rise to beliefs in great powers whose dominion embraces the *
upper
'
and Mower' worlds. It was because of this wide scope of
his power that he became known as Bel, i.e., the lord par
excellence ; and it is equally natural to find his worship spread
over the whole of Babylonia. In the south, the patron deity of
Lagash is designated by Gudea as " the mighty warrior of
Bel," showing the supremacy accorded to the latter. A temple to En-lil at Lagash, and known as E-adda, 'house of the
father,' by virtue of the relationship existing between the god
of Nippur and Nin-girsu, is mentioned by Uru-kagina. The temple is described as a lofty structure '
rising up to heaven.'
In the north, Nippur remains the place where his worship



54 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
acquired the greatest importance, so that Nippur was known
as the " land of Bel." The temple sacred to him at that place
was a great edifice, famous throughout Babylonian history as E-Kur, *>., mountain house, in the construction of which, a long
line of Babylonian rulers took part. From Naram-Sin, ruler
of Agade, on through the period of Cassite rule, the kings of Nippur proudly include in their titles that of ' builder of the
Temple of Bel at Nippur/ measuring their attachment to the
deity by the additions and repairs made to his sacred edifice. 1
Besides the kings of Agade, the rulers of other places pay their
devotions to Bel of Nippur. So, a king of Kish, whose name is read Alu-usharshid by Professor Hilprecht, 2 brings costly vases of marble and limestone from Elam and offers them to
Bel as a token of victory ; and this at a period even earlier
than Sargon. Even when En-lil is obliged to yield a modicum
of his authority to the growing supremacy of the patron deity of the city of Babylon, the highest tribute that can be paid to
the latter, is to combine with his real name, Marduk, the title of
" Bel," which of right belongs to En-lil. We shall see how this
combination of En-lil, or Bel, with Marduk reflects political
changes that took place in the Euphrates Valley ; and it is a direct consequence of this later association of the old Bel of
Nippur with the chief god of Babylon, that the original traits of the former become obscured in the historical and religious
texts. Dimmed popular traditions, which will be set forth
in their proper place, point to his having been at one time
regarded as a powerful chieftain armed with mighty weapons, but engaged in conflicts for the ultimate benefit of mankind.
On the whole, he is a beneficent deity, though ready to inflict

god at his temple. 2 The name signifies,
' He has founded the city,' the subject of the verb being some deity whose name is omitted.



BABYLONIAN GODS. 55
severe punishment for disobedience to his commands. We
must distinguish, then, in the case of En-lil, at least four
phases :
1. His original role as a local deity ;
2. The extension of his power to the grade of a great 'lord '
over a large district ; 3. Dissociation from local origins to become the supreme lord of the lower world ; and
4. The transfer of his name and powers as god of Nippur to
Marduk, the god of Babylon. The last two phases can best be set forth when we come to
the period, marked by the political supremacy of the city of
Babylon. It is sufficient, at this point, to have made clear his
position as god of Nippur.
NINCLIL OR BELIT.
The consort of En-lil is Nin-Lil, the * mistress of the lower
world.' She is known also as Belit, the feminine form to Bel,
i.e., the lady par excellence. She, too, had her temple at Nippur, the age of which goes back, at least, to the first dynasty of Ur.
But the glory of the goddess pales by the side of her powerful lord. She is naught but a weak reflection of Bel, as in general the consorts of the gods are. Another title by which this same
goddess was known is
NlN-KHAR-SAG, 1
which means the 'lady of the high or great mountain.' The title may have some reference to the great mountain where the
gods were supposed to dwell, and which was known to Baby
1 Jensen, Keils Bibl. 3, i, p. 23, proposes to read Nin-Ur-sag, but without sufficient reason, it seems to me. The writing being a purely ideographic form, an <?//'theton ornans, the question of how the ideographs are to be read is not of great moment.



56 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
lonians as the ' mountain of the lands.' Bel, as the chief of
the gods, is more particularly associated with this mountain. Hence his temple is called the 'mountain house.' From being regarded as the inhabitant of the mountain, he comes to be identified with the mountain itself. Accordingly, he is some
times addressed as the " great mountain," l and his consort
would therefore be appropriately termed ' the lady of the great mountain.' Besides the temple at Nippur, Belit, as Nin-khar
sag, had a sanctuary at Girsu, one of the quarters at Lagash (see under Nin-girsu), the earliest mention of which occurs on
an inscription of Ur-Bau. The latter calls the goddess
' the mother of the gods,' which further establishes her identity with
the consort of Bel. Entemena, another governor of Lagash,
places his domain under the protection of Nin-khar-sag. The worship at Nippur, however, remained most prominent. The continued popularity of her cult is attested by the fortress
Dur-zakar, which a later king, Samsuiluna (c. 2200), erected in her honor.
NlN-GIR-SU.
In the inscriptions of Gudea and of his time, the god most
prominently mentioned is the " Lord of Girsu." Girsu itself,
as the inscriptions show, is one of the four sections into which
the capitol city of Lagash was divided. It was there that the
temple stood which was sacred to the patron deity, and we may
conclude from this that Girsu is the oldest part of the city.
Afterwards, Lagash became the general name for the capitol
through being the quarter where the great palace of the king was erected. That Girsu was once quite distinct from Lagash
is also evident from the title of " king of Girsu," with which a
certain Uru-kagina, who is to be placed somewhat before Gudea, contents himself. The other three quarters, all of

BABYLONIAN GODS. 57
which were originally independent cities, are Uru-azaga, Nina,
and apparently Gish-galla.
1
Nin-girsu is frequently termed the warrior of Bel, the one
who in the service of the ' lord of the lower world/ appears in
the thick of tjie fight, to aid the subjects of Bel. In this role, he
is identical with a solar deity who enjoys especial prominence among the warlike Assyrians, whose name is provisionally read Nin-ib, but whose real name may turn out to be Adar.2 The rulers of Lagash declare themselves to have been chosen for
the high office by Nin-girsu, and as if to compensate themselves
for the degradation implied in being merely patesis, or governors, serving under some powerful chief, they call themselves the patesis of Nin-girsu, implying that the god was the master to whom they owed allegiance. The temple sacred to him at Girsu was called E-ninnu, and also by a longer name that described the god as the one 'who changes darkness into
light,' the reference being to the solar character of the god
Nin-ib with whom Nin-girsu is identified. In this temple,
Gudea and other rulers place colossal statues of themselves,
but temper the vanity implied, by inscribing on the front and back of these statues, an expression of their devotion to their
god. To Nin-girsu, most of the objects found at Tell-loh are
dedicated; conspicuous among which are the many clay cones, that became the conventional objects for votive offerings. There was another side, however, to his nature, besides the
belligerent one. As the patron of Lagash, he also presided
1 Reading doubtful Jensen suggests Erim. Hommel (Proc. Soc. Bibl. Arch. xv. 37 seq.) endeavored to identify the place with Babylon, but his views are untenable. If Gish-galla was not a part of Lagash, it could not have been far removed from it. It was Amiaud who first suggested that Shir-pur-la (or Lagash) was the general name for a city that arose from an amalgamation of four originally distinct quarters. ("Sirpurla" in Revue Archcologique, 1888.) The suggestion has been generally, though not universally accepted. 2 That Ninib is only an ideographic form is sufficiently clear from the element NIN-, lord. The proof, however, that Ninib is Adar, is still wanting. See Jensen, KosmologU dcr Babylonicr, pp. 457, 458.



58 BBBYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
over the agricultural prosperity of the district. In this role he
is addressed as Shul-gur or Shul-gur-an, i.e., the " god of the corn heaps "; Entemena and his son Enanna-tuma in erecting a kind of storehouse which they place under the protection of
Nin-girsu, declare that their god is Shul-gur ;
l and an old hymn 2
identifies him with Tammuz, the personification of agricultural
activity. Such a combination of apparently opposing attributes is a natural consequence of the transformation of what
may originally have been the personification of natural forces, into local deities. Each field had its protecting spirit, but for
the city as a whole, a local deity, whose rule mirrored the control of the human chief over his subjects, alone was available.
To him who watched over all things pertaining to the welfare
of the territory coming under his jurisdiction, various attributes,
as occasion required, were ascribed, and quite apart from his original character, the god could thus be regarded, as the warrior and the peaceful husbandman at the same time.
BAU.
Perhaps the most prominent of the goddesses in the ancient Babylonian period was Bau. One of the rulers of Lagash
has embodied the name of the goddess in his name, calling
himself Ur-Bau. It is natural, therefore, to find him more
especially devoted to the worship of this deity. He does not
tire of singing her praises, and of speaking of the temple he erected in her honor. Still, Ur-Bau does not stand alone in
his devotion ; Uru-kagina, Gudea, and others refer to Bau fre
1 From the context (De Sarzec, Decon-vertes, pi. 6, no. 4, 11. 13-21, and pi. 31, no. 3, col. iii. 11. 2-6), there can be no doubt that Shul-gur (or Shul-gur-ana) is an
epithet of Nin-girsu. The ideographs descriptive of the edifice suggest a corn magazine of some kind. One is reminded of the storehouses for grain in Egypt. See Jensen's Notes, Keils Bill. 3, i, pp. 15, 1 8, 73. A comparison of the two texts in question makes it probable that Ab-gi and E-bi-gar are synonymous. 2 Rawlinson, iv. 27, no. 6; n, 45-46.



BABYLONIAN GODS. 59
quently, while in the incantation texts, she is invoked as the
great mother, who gives birth to mankind and restores the
body to health. In the old Babylonian inscriptions she is called
the chief daughter of Anu, the god of heaven. Among her
titles, the one most frequently given is that of '
good lady.' She is the ' mother ' who fixes the destinies of men and pro
vides 'abundance' for the tillers of the soil. Gudea calls
her his mistress, and declares that it is she who " fills him
with speech," - a phrase whose meaning seems to be that to Bau he owes the power he wields. Locally, she is identi
fied with Uru-azaga (meaning
' brilliant town '), a quarter of
Lagash ; and it was there that her temple stood. As a
consequence, we find her in close association with Nin-girsu,
the god of Girsu. We may indeed go further and assume
that Girsu and Uru-azaga are the two oldest quarters of the city, the combination of the two representing the first natural
steps in the development of the principality, afterwards known as Lagash, through the addition of other quarters. 1 She
is indeed explicitly called the consort of Nin-girsu; and this
relation is implied also, in the interesting phrase used by Gudea, who presents gifts to Bau in the name of Nin-girsu,
and calls them 'marriage gifts.'
2 It is interesting to find, at
this early period, the evidence for the custom that still prevails
in the Orient, which makes the gifts of the bridegroom to his
chosen one, an indispensable formality.
3 These gifts were offered on the New Year's Day, known as Zag-muk, and the
importance of the worship of Bau is evidenced by the designation of this day, as the festival of Bau.
The offerings, themselves, consist of lambs, sheep, birds,
fish, cream, besides dates and various other fruits. When
1 It is noticeable that there is no mention made of a special god of Lagash, which points to the later origin of the name. 2 Inscr. D, col. ii. 13 ; G, col. ii. 11. 1-8 ; iii. 4 scq. 3 See Gen. xxiv. 53. Burkhardt, Notes on the Bedouins, i. 109, gives an example of the custom.



60 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
Uru-azaga becomes a part of Lagash, Bau's dignity is heightened to that of * mother of Lagash.' As the consort of Nin
girsu, she is identified with the goddess Gula, the name more
commonly applied to the *
princely mistress ' of Nin-ib, whose
worship continues down to the days of the neo-Babylonian monarchy. It is quite certain, however, that Bau is originally an independent goddess, and that the association of Uru-azaga and Girsu x lead to her identification with Gula. Regarding her
original nature, a certain index is her character as "daughter
of Anu." Anu being the god of heaven, Bau must be sought in the upper realm of personified forces, rather than elsewhere ;
but exactly which one she is, it is difficult to say. Hommel,
indeed, 2 is of opinion that she is the personified watery depth, the primitive chaos which has only the heavens above it; but
in giving this explanation, he is influenced by the desire to connect the name of Bau with the famous term for chaos in Genesis, Tohn-wa-bohu. There is, however, no proof whatsoever that Bau and Bohu have anything to do with one
another. A goddess who can hardly be distinguished from Bau is
GA-SIG-(?)DUG. 3
Indeed, from the fact that she is also the * mother of Lagash,' it might seem that this is but another name for Bau. How
ever, elsewhere, in two lists of deities invoked by Gudea (Inscr.
B, col. ii. 17), Ga-sig-dug is given a separate place by the side of Bau, once placed before and once after the latter ; and it is
clear therefore that she was originally distinct from Bau. For
Gudea, Ga-sig-dug is the mother who produced him. He is
1 The two names are used by Gudea (Inscr. G, col. iii. 12) in a way to indicate that they embrace the whole district of Lagash.

BABYLONIAN GODS. 61
her servant and she is his mistress. Lagash is her beloved
city, and there he prepares for her a dwelling-place, which later rulers, like Entena, embellish. She is called the ' bril
liant '
(Azag), but as this title is merely a play upon the element
found in the city, Uru-azaga, sacred to Bau, not much stress
is to be laid upon this designation. Unfortunately, too, the elements composing her name are not clear, 1 and it must be
borne in mind that the reading is purely provisional. So much, at least, seems certain : that Bau and Ga-sig-dug are two forms under which one and the same natural element was personified. Bau is called in the incantation texts, the mother of Ea. The
latter being distinctly a water god, we miay conclude that in some way, Bau is to be connected with water as a natural
element. The conjecture may be hazarded that she personifies originally the waters of the upper realm the clouds. Since
Ea, who is her son, represents the waters of the lower realm,
the relation of mother and son reflects perhaps a primitive
conception of the origin of the deep, through the descent of the upper waters. When we come to the cosmogony of the
Babylonians, it will be seen that this conception of a distinction between the two realms of waters is a fundamental one. This character as a spirit of the watery elements is shared by others
of the goddesses appearing in the old Babylonian inscriptions.
2
EN-KI OR EA.
This god, who, as we shall see, becomes most prominent in
the developed form of Babylonian theology, does not occupy the place one should expect in the early Babylonian inscriptions. Ur-Bau erects a sanctuary to Ea, at Girsu. Another of the gov
ernors of Lagash calls himself, priest of Ea, describing the
1 The first signifies
' to make,' the third means " good, favorable," but the second, upon which so much depends, is not clear. Amiaud reads turn instead of sig.
2 E.g., Nina (see below).



62 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
god as the " supreme councillor." From him, the king receives
"wisdom." 1 A ruler, Rim-Sin, of the second dynasty of Ur,
associates Ea with Bel, declaring that these " great gods " en
trusted Uruk into his hands with the injunction to rebuild the
city that had fallen in ruins. The ideograms, with which his
name is written, En-ki, designate him as god of that ' which is below,' the earth in the first place ; but with a more precise differentiation of the functions of the great gods, Ea becomes
the god of the waters of the deep. When this stage of belief
is reached, Ea is frequently associated with Bel, who, it will be recalled, is the ' god of the lower region,' but who becomes the
god of earth par excellence. When, therefore, Bel and Ea are
invoked, it is equivalent, in modern parlance, to calling upon earth and water ; and just as Bel is used to personify, as it
were, the unification of the earthly forces, so Ea becomes, in a comprehensive sense, the watery deep. Ea and Bel assume therefore auspicious proportions in the developed Babylonian cosmogony and theology. In the cosmogony, Bel is the creator and champion of mankind, and Ea is the subterranean deep which surrounds the earth, the source of wisdom and culture ;
in the theology, Ea and Bel are pictured in the relation of
father and son, who, in concert, are appealed to, when misfortune or disease overtakes the sons of man ; Ea, the father,
being the personification of knowledge, and Bel, the practical activity that ' emanates from wisdom,' as Professor Sayce, 2
adopting the language of Gnosticism, aptly puts it ; only that, as already suggested, Marduk assumes the role of the older Bel.
Confining ourselves here to the earlier phases of Ea, it seems
probable that he was originally regarded as the god of Eridu, one of the most ancient of the holy cities of Southern Baby
lonia, now represented by Abu-Shahrein, and which once stood on the shores of the Persian Gulf. Ur-Bau expressly calls the
1 De Sarzec, pi. 7, col. i. 12. 2 Hibbert Lectures, p. 104.



BABYLONIAN GODS. 63
god the 'king of Eridu.' The sacredness of the place is
attested by Gudea, who boasts of having made the temple of Nin-girsu as sacred as Eridu. 1 It is over this city that Ea
watches. The importance of the Persian Gulf to the growth of the city, would make it natural to place the seat of the god in the waters themselves. The cult of water-deities arises,
naturally, at places which are situated on large sheets of water; and in the attributes of wisdom which an older age ascribed to Ea, there may be seen the embodiment of the tradition that the
course of civilization proceeds from the south. The superi
ority of the Persian Gulf over the other waters of Babylon
over the two great rivers with their tributary streams and canals would be another factor that would lead to the god
of the Persian Gulf being regarded as the personification of
the watery element in general. For the Babylonians, the Per
sian Gulf, stretching out indefinitely, and to all appearances one with the great ocean whose ulterior shores could not be
reached, was the great
' Okeanos,' that flowed around the earth
and on which the earth rested. Ea, accordingly (somewhat
like En-lil), was delocalized, as it were, and his worship was maintained long after the recollection of his connection with
Eridu had all but disappeared. At the same time, for the very reason that he was cut loose from local associations, no place could lay claim to being the seat of the deity. Ur-Bau, when
erecting a sanctuary to Ea at Girsu, significantly calls the god * the king of Eridu.' The sanctuary is not, in this case, the
dwelling-place of the god.
We are justified, therefore, in going back many centuries, before reaching the period when Ea was, merely, the local god of Eridu. Whether Ea is to be regarded as the real name of
the god, or is also an ideograph like En-ki, is again open to doubt. If Ea is the real pronunciation, then the writing of the name is a play upon the character of the deity, for it is com

64 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
posed of two elements that signify 'house' and 'water,' - the
name thus suggesting the character and real seat of the deity.
A point in favor of regarding Ea as the real name, albeit not
decisive, is the frequent use of the unmistakable ideographic description of the god as En-ki. The consort of Ea who is
Dam-kina does not appear in the historical texts of the first
period. The origin of Babylonian civilization at the Persian Gulf,
together with the dependence of Babylonia for her fertility upon the streams and canals, account for the numerous water-deities to be found in the ancient Babylonian pantheon, some of which
have already been discussed. We will meet with others further
on. Every stream, large or small, having its special protecting deity, the number of water-deities naturally increases as the land becomes more and more dissected by the canal sys
tem that conditioned the prosperity of the country.
Ea, as we shall see, appears under an unusually large number of names. 1 One of these is
NIN-A-GAL,
which, signifying
* god of great strength,' is given to him as
the patron of the smith's art. 2 A god of this name is men
tioned by Ur-Bau, 3 who speaks of a sanctuary erected in honor of this deity. But since the king refers to Ea (as En-ki) a
few lines previous, it would appear that at this period Nin-agal is still an independent deity. The later identification with Ea
appears to be due to the idea of *
strength
' involved in the
name of Nin-agal. In the same way, many of the names of Ea
were originally descriptive of independent gods who, because of the similarity of their functions to those of the great Ea,
1 In Rawlinson, ii. 58, no. 6, there is a list of some seventy names. 2 Rawlinson, ii. 58, no. 6, 58. 3 De Sarzec, pi. 8, col. v. 11. 4-6.



BABYLONIAN GODS. 65
were absorbed by the latter. Their names transferred to Ea,
are frequently the only trace left of their original independent existence.
NERGAL.
Nergal, the local deity of Cuthah (or Kutu), represented by the mound Tell-Ibrahim, some distance to the east of Babylon,
was of an entirely different character from Ea, but his history
in the development of the Babylonian religion is hardly less interesting. The first mention of his famous temple at Cuthah
is found in an inscription of Dungi (to be read Ba'u-ukin,
according to Winckler *) who belongs to the first dynasty of
Ur (c. 2900 B.C.). Its origin, however, belongs to a still earlier period. Such was the fame of the temple known as E-shid-lam, and the closeness of the connection between the deity and his favorite seat, that Nergal himself became known as shid-lam-ta
ud-du-a, i.e., the god that rises up from E-shid-lam. It is by this
epithet that the same Dungi describes him in one of his inscrip
tions. 2 Down to the latest period of Assyro- Babylonian history, Nergal remains identified with Kutu, being known at all times
as the god of Kutu. 3 When S argon, the king of Assyria, upon his conquest of the kingdom of Israel (c. 722 B.C.), brought people from Babylon, Cuthah, Ava, and so forth, across to the lands of the Jordan to take the place of the deported Israelites, the Hebrew narrator (II Kings, xvii. 24-35) tells us ^ n an interest
ing manner of the obnoxious foreign worship which these people
brought to the land, each division bringing the gods of their place with them. The men of Cuthah, he adds (v. 30), made a
1 Keils Bibl. 3, i, 80, note 3. 2 Kawlinson, iv. 35, no. 2, i. 3 See a syllabary giving lists of gods, Rawlinson, ii. 60, 12. Dungi, indeed, calls Nergal once the king of lawful control over Lagash (Rawlinson, iv. 35, no. 2, 11. 2, 3). The exact force of the title is not clear, but in no case are we permitted to conclude as Amiaud does (Rec. of the Past, N. s., i. 59) that Shid-lam-ta-udda is identical
with Nin-girsu.



66 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
statue of Nergal. Singamil, of the dynasty, having its capital at Uruk (c. 2750 B.C.), likewise testifies to his devotion to
Nergal by busying himself with improvements and additions to his temple at Cuthah. His worship, therefore, was not confined
to those who .happened to reside at Cuthah; and closely as he is
identified with the place, the character of the god is a general
and not a special one. The full form of his name appears to have been Ner-unu-gal, of which Nergal, furnished by the Old Testament passage referred to, would then be a contraction or a somewhat corrupt form. The three elements composing his
name signify
" the mighty one of the great dwelling-place," but it is, again, an open question whether this is a mere play upon the character of the god, as in the name of Ea (according to
one of the interpretations above suggested), or whether it is an
ideographic form of the name. The Old Testament shows, con
clusively, that the name had some such pronunciation as
Nergal. Jensen, from other evidences, inclines to the opinion
that the writing Ner-unu-gal is the result of a species of etymology, brought about by the prominence given to Nergal as the god of the region of the dead. It is in this capacity that
he already appears in the inscription of Singamil, who calls him '
king of the nether world.' The " great dwelling-place," therefore, is clearly the dominion over which Nergal rules, and when we come to the cosmogony of the Babylonians, 1 it will be found that this epithet for the nether world the great
dwelling-place accords with their conception of the life after death. But while Nergal, with a host of lesser demons about
him, appears as the Babylonian Pluto, particularly in the religious texts, his functions are not limited to the control of
the dead. He is the personification of some of the evils that
bring death to mankind, particularly pestilence and war. The death that follows in his path is a violent one, and his de
structive force is one that acts upon large masses rather than
1 See Jensen, Kosmologie der Babylonier, pp. 476-87.



BABYLONIAN GODS. 67
upon the individual. Hence, one of the most common ideo
graphs used to express his name is that which signifies
' sword.' War and pestilence are intimately associated in the mind of
the Babylonians. Among other nations, the sword is, similarly,
the symbol of the deity, as the plague-bringer as well as the warrior.
To this day, a pestilence is the general accompaniment of war in the East, or follows in its wake. Different from Nin-ib,
who is also a god of war, Nergal symbolizes more particularly the destruction which accompanies war, and not the strong
champion who aids his subjects in the fight. Nergal is essen
tially a destroyer, and the various epithets applied to him in the religious texts, show that he was viewed in this light. He
is at times the ' god of fire,' again
* the raging king,'
' the
violent one' 'the one who burns '; and finally identified with
the glowing heat of flame. Often, he is described by these attri
butes, instead of being called by his real name. 1 Dr. Jensen
has recently shown in a satisfactory manner, that this phase of his character must be the starting-point in tracing the order of
his development. As the '
glowing flame,' Nergal is evidently a phase of the sun, and Jensen proves that the functions and
aspects of the sun at different periods being differentiated
among the Babylonians, Nergal is more especially the hot sun of midsummer or midday, the destructive force of which was
the chief feature that distinguished it. The hot sun of Baby
lonia, that burns with fierce intensity, brings pestilence and death, and carries on a severe contest against man. From
being the cause of death, it is but a step, and a natural one,
to make Nergal preside over the region, prepared for those whom he has destroyed. The course taken by Babylonian
theology is responsible for the prominence given to the latter role of Nergal, which finally overshadows his other phases to the
extent of suggesting the fanciful interpretation of his name as
1 See Jensen, Kosinologie dcr Babylonicr, pp. 476-87.



68 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
the 'ruler of the great dwelling-place for the dead.' In the
light of the facts set forth, another explanation for his name must be looked for that would connect the god with solar
functions. The name may in fact be divided into two ele
ments, the first having the force of chief or ruler, the second
*
great.' The combination would be an appropriate designation for the sun, in the role of a destructive power. But Nergal, after
all, represents only one phase of the sun-god. The god who was worshipped as the personification of the sun par excellence and the sun as a whole, was
SHAMASH.
Written with an ideograph that describes him as the * god of
the day,' there is no deity whose worship enjoys an equally continued popularity in Babylonia and Assyria. Beginning at the earliest period of Babylonian history, and reaching to the latest, his worship suffers no interruption. Shamash, moreover, maintains his original character with scarcely any modifi
cation throughout this long period. For all that, he bears a name which signifies
' attendant ' or '
servitor,' and which
sufficiently shows the subsidiary position that he occupied in the Babylonian pantheon. One of the rulers belonging to the second dynasty of Ur calls the sun-god, the offspring of Nannar, one of the names of the moon-god, and the last king of Babylonia, Nabonnedos, does the same. In combination with
the moon-god, the latter takes precedence of Shamash, 1 and in the enumeration of the complete pantheon, in the inscriptions of both Assyrian and Babylonian kings, the same order is preserved. Other evidence that points to the superior rank
accorded to Sin, the moon-god over the sun-deity in Baby
lonia, is the reckoning of time by the moon phases. The day begins with the evening, and not with sunrise. The moon, as
1 So in the inscription of Rim-Sin (Keils Bibl. 3, i, p. 97).



BABYLONIAN GODS. W
the chief of the starry firmament, and controlling the fate of mankind, was the main factor in giving to the orb of night, this
peculiar prominence. The '
service,' accordingly implied in the name of Shamash appears to have been such as was demanded
by his subsidiary position to the moon-god. Beyond the general recognition, however, of this relationship between the two, it does not appear that the worship paid to Shamash, was at all affected by the secondary place, that he continued to hold in
the theoretically constructed pantheon. Less than is the case
with the other gods, is he identified with any particular city, and we therefore find in the most ancient period, two centers of
Southern Babylonia claiming Shamash as their patron saint,
Larsa, represented by the mound of Senkereh, and Sippar, occupying the site of the modern Abu-Habba. It is difficult to say which of the two was the older ; the latter, in the course of time, overshadowed the fame of the former, and its
history can be traced back considerably beyond the sunworship at Larsa, the first mention of which occurs in the
inscriptions of rulers of the first dynasty of Ur (c. 2900 B.C.). Since Ur, as we shall see, was sacred to the moon-god, it is
hardly likely that the Shamash cult was introduced at Larsa by the rulers of Ur. The kings of Ur would not have forfeited
the protection of Sin, by any manifestation of preference for Shamash. When Ur-Bau, therefore, tells us that he ' built ' a temple to Shamash at Larsa, he must mean, as Sin-iddina of
the dynasty of Larsa does, in using the same phrase, that he
enlarged or improved the edifice. What makes it all the more
likely that Ur-Bau found sun-worship at Larsa in existence is, that in the various places over which this ruler spread his
building activity, he is careful in each case to preserve the
status of the presiding deity. So at Nippur, he engages in work at the temples of En-lil and of Nin-lil ; while at Uruk he
devotes himself to the temple of Nana. In thus connecting their names with the various sacred edifices of Babylonia, the



70 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
rulers emphasized, on the one hand, their control of the terri
tory in which the building lay, and on the other, their allegiance
to the deity of the place, whose protection and favor they sought
to gain. The mention of a temple to Shamash at Sippar reverts to a still earlier period than that of its rival. Nabonnedos tells us that it was founded by Naram-Sin. Sargon has put his name
on some object 1 that he dedicates to the sun-god at Sippar. That there was an historical connection between the two
temples may be concluded from the fact that the name of the
sacred edifices was the same in both, E-babbara, signifying the
' house of lustre.' Such a similarity points to a dependence of one upon the other, and the transfer or extension of the
worship directly from one place to the other ; but, as intimated, we have no certain means of determining which of the two is the older, In view of the general observation to be made in
what pertains to the religion of the Babylonians, that fame and age go hand in hand, the balance is in favor of Sippar, which
became by far the more famous of the two, received a greater
share of popular affection, and retained its prominence to the
closing days of the neo-Babylonian monarchy. We shall have occasion in a succeeding chapter to trace the history of the sun
temple at Sippar so far as known. It is interesting to note
that Nabonnedos, feeling the end of his power to be near, undertakes, as one of the last resorts, the restoration of this
edifice, in the hope that by thus turning once more to the
powerful Shamash, he might secure his protection, in addition to that of Marduk, the head of the later Babylonian pantheon. In Ur itself, Shamash was also worshipped in early days by the side of the moon-god. Gungunu, of the second'dynasty of Ur (c. 2700 B.C.), tells of two temples erected to him at that
place ; and still a third edifice, sacred to both Nannar (the
moon-god) and Shamash at Ur, is referred to by a king of the
1 Perhaps the knob of a sceptre. Proc. Soc. Bibl. Arch. viii. 68.



BABYLONIAN GODS. 71
Larsa dynasty, Rim-Sin (c. 2300 B.C.). The titles given to Shamash by the early rulers are sufficiently definite to show
in what relation he stood to his worshippers, and what the
conceptions were j;hat were formed of him. He is, alternately, the king and the shepherd. Since the kings also called
themselves shepherds, no especial endearment is conveyed
by this designation. In the incantations, Shamash is frequently appealed to, either alone, or when an entire group of spirits and deities are enumerated. He is called upon to give
life to the sick man. To him the body of the one who is
smitten with disease is confided. As the god of light, he is
appropriately called upon to banish f darkness ' from the house, darkness being synonymous with misfortune ; and the appeal is
made to him more particularly as the '
king of judgment.' From this, it is evident that the beneficent action of the sun, was the
phase associated with Shamash. He was hailed as the god that
gives light and life to all things, upon whose favor the prosperity
of the fields and the well-being of man depend. He creates
the light and secures its blessings for mankind. His favor
produces order and stability ; his wrath brings discomfiture and
ruin to the state and the individual. But his power was, per
haps, best expressed by the title of " judge " - the favorite one
in the numerous hymns that were composed in his honor. He
was represented as seated on a throne in the chamber of judg
ment, receiving the supplications of men, and according as he manifested his favor or withdrew it, enacting the part of the
decider of fates. He loosens the bonds of the imprisoned,
grants health to the sick, and even revivifies the dead. On the other hand, he puts an end to wickedness and destroys enemies. He makes the weak strong, and prevents the strong from
crushing the weak. From being the judge, and, moreover, the supreme judge of the world, it was but natural that the conception of justice was bound up with him. His light became
symbolical of righteousness, and the absence of it, or darkness,



72 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
was viewed as wickedness. Men and gods look expectantly
for his light. He is the guide of the gods, as well as the ruler of men.
While there are no direct indications in the historical texts
known at present, that this conception of the sun-god existed
in all its details before the days of Hammurabi, there is every
reason to believe that this was the case ; the more so, in that
it does not at all transcend the range of religious ideas that we
have met with in the case of the other gods of this period.
Nor does this conception in any way betray itself, as being due to the changed political conditions that set in, with the union of
the states under Hammurabi. Still, the age of the religious
texts not being fixed, it is thus necessary to exercise some caution before using them without the basis of an allusion in
the historical texts.
UTU.
It but remains, before passing on, to note that the same deity appears under various names. Among these are Utu 1
and apparently also Babbar 2 in the old Babylonian inscriptions.
For the latter, a Semitic etymology is forthcoming, and we may
therefore regard it as representing a real pronunciation, and not an ideographic writing. Babbar, a contracted form from Barbar, is the reduplication of the same stem bar* that we have already met with, in the name of the temple sacred to Shamash.
Like E-babbara, therefore, Babbar is the "
brilliantly shining
one," a most appropriate name for the sun, and one frequently applied to him in the religious texts. As to Utu, there is some
doubt whether it represents a real pronunciation or not. My own opinion is that it does, and that the underlying stem is
1 .g., Hammurabi (Revue d'Assyriologic, ii. col. i. 21) ; but also Gudea and a still earlier king.
2 So Amiaud ; and there seems some reason to believe that the name was used by
the side of Utu, though perhaps only as an epithet. 3 Compare birbint,
'
sheen,' and the stem baru, ' to see,' etc.



BABYLONIAN GODS. 73
atii, which in Babylonian has almost the same meaning as bar
or barti, viz., 'to see.' ' Utu ' would thus again designate the sun as 'that which shines forth.'
It will be recalled, that other instances have been noted of the same god appearing under different names. The most
natural explanation for this phenomenon is, that the variation
corresponds to the different localities where the god was wor
shipped. The identification would not be made until the union of the various Babylonian states had been achieved. Such a
union would be a potent factor in systematizing the pantheon. When once it was recognized that the various names repre
sented, in reality, one and the same deity, it would not be long
before the name, peculiar to the place where the worship was most prominent, would set the others aside or reduce them to
mere epithets. It may well be that Shamash was the name given to the god at Sippar, whereas at Ur he may have been known as Utu.
Ur-Bau (of the first Ur dynasty) calls him Utu also, when
speaking of the temple at Larsa, but it would be natural for the kings of Ur to call the sun-god of Larsa by the same name
that he had in Ur. That Hammurabi, however, calls the sun
god of Larsa, Utu, may be taken as an indication that, as such he was known at that place, for since we have no record
of a sun-temple at Babylon in these days, there would be no motive that might induce him to transfer a name, otherwise
known to him, to another place. The testimony of Hammurabi
is therefore as direct as that of Sargon, who calls the sun-god
of Sippar, Shamash. It is not always possible to determine, with as much show of probability, as in the case of the sun-god, the distribution of the various names, but the general conclusion,
for all that, is warranted in every instance, that a variety of
names refers, originally, to an equal variety of places over which the worship was spread, only that care *must be exercised to
distinguish between distinctive names and mere epithets.



74 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
A OR MALKATU.
A consort of the sun-deity, appearing frequently at his side in the incantation texts, is A. It is more particularly with the
Shamash of Sippar, that A is associated. She is simply the * beloved one ' of the sun-deity, with no special character of her
own. In the historical texts, her role is quite insignificant, and for the period with which we are at present concerned she is only mentioned once by a North Babylonian ruler, Ma-an-ish
tu-su, 1 who dedicates an object to her. The reading of the
ideogram A, or Nin-A (i.e., Lady A), is doubtful. Malkatu
(" mistress " or " queen ") is offered as a plausible conjecture. 2
Lehman (Keils Bibl. iii. i, 202) suggests A-ja, but on insufficient
grounds. In any case A has the force of mistress, and Nin-A
simply designates the goddess as the lady, mistress, or queen.
It is likely that A was originally an independent deity, and one of the names of the sun-god in a particular locality. It occurs in proper names as a title of Shamash. Instead, how
ever, of becoming identified with Shamash, A degenerated into a pale reflection of Shamash, pictured under the relationship of consort to him. This may have been due to the union
of Shamash with the place where A was worshipped. If, as seems likely, that near Sippar, there was another city on the
other side of the Euphrates, forming a suburb to it (as Borsippa I
did to Babylon), the conclusion is perhaps warranted that A
was originally the sun-god worshipped at the place which afterwards became incorporated with Sippar. 3 Such an amal
gamation of two originally male deities into a combination of
1 See Keils Bibl. 3, i, 100. Reading of name uncertain. 2 Suggested by Rawlinson, ii. 57, 10. See Schrader, Zeits. f. Assyr. iii. 33 seq. 3 On Sippar, see Sayce, Hibbert Lectures, etc., 168-169, who finds in the Old
Testament form " Sepharvayim" a trace of this double Sippar. Dr. Ward's suggestion, however, in regard to Anbar, as representing this ' second ' Sippar, is erroneous.



BABYLONIAN GODS. 75
male and female, strange as it may seem to us, is in keeping with the lack of sharp distinction between male and female in
the oldest forms of Semitic religions. In the old cuneiform
writing the same sign is used to indicate " lord " or " lady "
when attached to deities. Ishtar appears among Semites both
as a male 1 and as a female deity. Sex was primarily a ques
tion of strength. The stronger god was viewed as masculine ; the weaker as feminine.
NANNAR AND SIN.
Nannar, a reduplicated form like Babbar, with the assimilation
of the first r to n (nar-nar = nannar), has very much the same
meaning as Babbar. The latter, as we have seen, is the " lustrous one," the former, the "one that furnishes light." The
similarity in meaning is in keeping with the similarity of function of the two deities, thus named: Babbar being the sun and Nannar, the moon. It was under the name of Nannar that the
moon-god was worshipped at Ur, the most famous and probably the oldest of the cities over which the moon-god presided.
The association of Nannar with Ur is parallel to that of Sha
mash with Sippar, not that the moon-god's jurisdiction or worship was confined to that place, but that the worship of
the deity of that place eclipsed others, and the fame and
importance at Ur led to the overshadowing of the moonworship there, over the obeisance to him paid elsewhere. What further motives led to the choice of the moon-god as
the patron of Ur, lies beyond the scope of our knowledge. Due allowance must be made for that natural selection, which takes place in the realm of thought as much as in the domain
of nature. Attention has already been called to the predomi
nance given by the Babylonians to the moon over the sun.
1 /?.-., in Southern Arabia. See W. Robertson Smith, The Religion of the Semites, i. 59.



76 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
The latter is expressly called the "
offspring of the lord of
brilliant beginning," that is, the moon-god (Delitzsch, Assyr.
Hdw., p. 234 a). It is needless, therefore, to do more, at this place, than to emphasize the fact anew. The moon serving much more as a guide to man, through the regular character of its constant changes, than the sun, was connected in the
religious system with both the heavenly and the terrestrial forces. In view of Nannar's position in frhe heavens, he
was called the " heifer of Anu." Anu, it will be recalled, was
the god of heaven (and heaven itself), while the " heifer " l is
here used metaphorically for offspring, the picture being sug
gested probably by the " horn " that the moon presents at a certain phase. This * horn ' constitutes his crown, and he is
frequently represented on seal cylinders with a crescent over his head, and with a long flowing beard, that is described as
having the color of lapislazuli. A frequent title is the ' lord of the crown.' On the other hand, by virtue of its influence
on the earth, regulating, as the ancients observed, the tides, the moon was connected by the Babylonians with the reckoning of time. Because of this connection with the ' lower world,'
it seems, he was also regarded as the first-born of Bel. His
sacred edifice at Ur was one to which all rulers of the place
devoted themselves. Ur-Bau, Nur-Ramman, Sin-iddina, and Kudur-mabuk tell of their embellishment of the temple, each
one appropriating to himself the title of '
builder,' in which
they gloried. So close, again, was the identification of the city with the deity, that the latter was frequently known simply as the god of Ur, and the former, as the city of Nannar.
Another name of the moon-god was Sin, the meaning of which escapes us. At the side of Ur, Harran is the place most celebrated by reason of its moon-worship, and there is every reason to believe that the name Sin was originally attached to
1 In Rabbinical literature, the moon is compared to a ' heifer ' (Talmud Babli Rosh-hashana 22 b).



BABYLONIAN GODS. 77
Harran. The migrations of the ancient Hebrews were connected as we now know with political movements in Babylonia.
They proceed from Ur or Ur-Kasdim, i.e., Chaldean Ur
northward to Harran, which, by virtue of its position, became a town of much importance. This association of Ur with Harran
furnishes an indication for historical relations of some sort,
existing between the two places. It is therefore not accidental,
that the patron deity of both places was the same. As yet, no excavations have been made at Harran, and we are, therefore,
dependent upon incidental notices for our knowledge of its his
tory. These sufficiently show that the place continued through a long period to preserve its sacred character. The old temple
there, was one of the many that stirred up the religious zeal of
Nabonnedos ; and previous to this, we find several Assyrian
kings occupied in embellishing and restoring the structure. An interesting reference to Harran, bearing witness to its ancient
dignity, is found in an inscription of Sargon II. of Assyria (722-706 B.C.), who enumerates among his claims to the favor
of the gods, that he restored the " laws and customs of Harran," by which he evidently means that he was instrumental in giv
ing the place, the dignity it once enjoyed. A curious feature connected with Sin, is the occurrence of the name in Mount
Sinai, in the wilderness of Sin, as well as in an inscription of
Southern Arabia. May not this be a further testimony to the
association of Harran with Sin, since it is from Harran that
the departure of the Hebrews for the west took place ? What more natural than that in the migrations which carried the
Hebrews to the west, the worship of Sin should have been transferred to Arabia? 1 Important as Ur and Harran are as
sacred towns, politically they do not retain their prominence after the days of Hammurabi. The amalgamation of Nannar
1 That the name of Sin should have been introduced into Mesopotamia through the 'Arabic' dynasty (see above, p. 39) is less probable, though not impossible in the light of recent discoveries.



78 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
with Sin, and the almost exclusive occurrence of the latter
name in later times, does not of necessity point to a preponderating influence of Harran over Ur, but may be due to the
greater fame which the former place acquired as the goal of reli
gious pilgrimages. The situation of Harran the name itself
signifies
* road ' - as the highway leading to the west, must
have been an important factor, in bringing this about. However this may be, Sin and Nannar are as thoroughly identical
in the period following Hammurabi, as Babbar and Shamash. The attributes of the one are transferred to the other so com
pletely, that a separation of the two is no longer possible. The ideographs with which the name of Sin is written show him to have been regarded as the god of wisdom, but while wisdom and light may be connected, it is Nannar's character as
the " illuminator " that becomes the chief trait of the god. No
doubt the preeminence of Ea in this respect, who is the per
sonification of wisdom, par excellence, made it superfluous to have another deity possessing the same trait. It is, accord
ingly, as the god of light, that Sin continues to be adored in the
Babylonian religion ; and when he is referred to, in the historical
texts and hymns, this side of his nature is the one dwelt upon.
Through his light, the traps laid by the evil spirits, who are
active at night, are revealed. In later times, apparently through
Assyrian influence, the reckoning of time was altered to the extent of making the day begin with sunrise, instead of with the
approach of night ; and this, together with the accommodation of the lunar cycle to the movements of the sun, brought about
a partial change of the former conditions, and gave somewhat greater prominence to Shamash. As a consequence, the role of Sin is not as prominent in the hymns that belong to a later
period as in those of earlier days.
The oracles of the Assyrian kings are addressed to Shamash,
and not to Sin. Moreover, the personal factor in the case of
Sin, if one may express oneself thus, is not as strong as in



BABYLONIAN GODS. 79
that of some other gods. His traits are of a more general
kind. He is supreme ; there is none like him, and the spirits are subservient to his will. But terms of endearment are few,
while on the mythological side, comparatively little is made of him. He is strong and he is holy. He is called upon to clothe
the evil-doer with leprosy, as with a dress. In a robe, befitting
his dignity, he stalks about. Without him, no city is founded, no
district restored to former glory. Sin is called the father of the
gods, but in a metaphorical rather than in a real sense. The
only one of his children who takes an important part in the later
phases of Babylonian-Assyrian worship is his daughter Ishtar. She seems to have taken to herself some of the traits of right
belonging to Sin, and the prominence of her worship may be regarded as an additional factor in accounting for the
comparative obscurity to which Sin gradually is assigned. At all events, Sin is a feature of the earlier period of the Baby
lonian religion rather than of the later periods.
NINNI OR INNANNA.
The secondary position held by the female deities in the
Babylonian pantheon has been repeatedly referred to. This trait of the religion finds an illustration not only in the
' shadowy ' character of the consorts of the gods, but also in
the manner in which goddesses, originally distinct from one another and enjoying an existence independent of any male
consort, lose their individuality, as it were, and become merely so many forms of one and the same deity. Indeed, as we
approach the moment when the gods of the Babylonian pantheon are ranged into a system, the tendency becomes pronounced to recognize only one goddess, representative of the principle of generation one 'great mother,' endowed with a variety of traits according to the political and social con
ditions prevailing at different times in Babylonia and Assyria.



80 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
In the earliest period which we are now considering, we can still distinguish a number of goddesses who afterwards became
merged into this one great goddess. These are Ninni (or
Innanna), Nana, and Anunit. Ninni and Innanna are names that appear to have a common
origin.
1 Both embody the notion of '
ladyship.' The worship of this goddess centers in the district of Lagash. Ur-Bau
(c. 3000 B.C.), who addresses her as 'glorious and supreme/ builds a temple in her honor at Gishgalla, and Gudea refers to
a temple known as E-anna, />., heavenly house in Girsu. 2 For
Gudea, Ninni is the " mistress of the world." Another ruler
of Lagash whose name is doubtfully read as E-dingir-ra-na-gin,3 but who is even earlier than Ur-Bau, declares that he has been 'called' by Innanna to the throne. She is mentioned by the
side of Nin-khar-sag. We are still in the period where local
associations formed a controlling factor in ensuring the popu
larity of a deity, and while the goddesses attached to the gods
of the important centers are still differentiated, the tendency already exists to designate the female consorts simply as the
'goddess/ to apply to all, the traits that may once have been
peculiar to one. As we pass from one age to the other, there is
an increasing difficulty in keeping the various local '
goddesses ' apart. Even the names become interchangeable ; and since
these goddesses all represented essentially the same principle of generation and fertility, it was natural that with the union
of the Babylonian states they should become merged into one
great mother-goddess. A ' local ' goddess who retains rather
more of her individuality than others, is
1 Innanna may be separated into In =lord or lady, and nanna; in and nanna
would then be elements added to " lady," conveying perhaps the idea of greatness. See Jensen's remarks, Kcils Bibl. 3, i, 20, note 4. 2 Rec. of the Past, N.S., ii. p. 104. 3 Keils Bill. 3, i, 16. See Jensen's note on the reading of the name.



BABYLONIAN GODS. 81
NANA.
Her name is again playfully interpreted by the Babylonians . through association with Nin as ' the lady
' par excellence.
She was the chief goddess of the city of Uruk. Her temple at
Uruk is first mentioned by Ur-Gur, of the first dynasty of Ur. It is restored and enlarged by Dungi, the successor of
Ur-Bau, and so thoroughly is she identified with her edifice
known as E-anna (again a play upon her name), that she becomes known as the Lady of E-anna. 1 She appears to have
had a temple also at Ur, and it is to this edifice that later
rulers of Larsa Kudur-Mabuk and Rim-Sin, as well as the
kings of the Isin dynasty, Gamil-Ninib, Libit-Ishtar, and IshmeDagan refer in their inscriptions. The members of the Isin dynasty pride themselves upon
their control over Uruk, and naturally appear as special devotees to Nana, whose chosen "consort" they declare them
selves to be, wielding the sceptre, as it were, in union with her.
Already at this period, Nana is brought into connection with the
moon-god, being called by Kudur-Mabuk the daughter of Sin.
The relationship in this case indicates, primarily, the supremacy exercised by Ur, and also a similarity in the traits of the two
deities. In the fully developed cosmology, Nana is the planet Venus, whose various aspects, as morning and evening star, suggested an analogy with the phases of the moon. Venus, like the moon, served as a guide to man, while her
inferiority in size and importance to the former, would naturally come to be expressed under the picture of father and
daughter. In a certain sense, all the planets appearing at the same time and in the same region with the moon were the
children of the latter. Sin, therefore, is appropriately called
1 The fame of this temple outlasts the political importance of the place, and as late as the days of the Assyrian monarchy is an object of fostering care on the part of the kings.



82 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
the father of gods, just as Arm, the personification of the heaven itself, is the supreme father of Sin and Shamash, and
of all the heavenly bodies. The metaphorical application of 'father' as 'source,' throughout Oriental parlance, must be kept in mind in interpreting the relationship between the gods. Still another name of the goddess is Anunit, which
appears to have been peculiar to the North Babylonian city Agade, and emphasizes her descent from "Ami," the god of
heaven. Her temple at Agade, known as E-ul-mash, is the
object of Sargon's devotion, which makes her, with Bel and Shamash, the oldest triad of gods mentioned in the Babylonian
inscriptions. But the name which finally displaces all others, is
ISHTAR.
Where the name originated has not yet been ascertained, as little as its etymology, 1 but it seems to belong to Northern
Babylonia rather than to the south.
In time, all the names that we have been considering
Ninni, Nana, and Anunit became merely so many designations of Ishtar. She absorbs the titles and qualities of all, and
the tendency which we have pointed out finds its final outcome
in the recognition of Ishtar as the one and only goddess endowed with powers and an existence independent of associa
tion with any male deity, though even this independence does not hinder her from being named at times as the associate of
the chief god of Assyria the all-powerful Ashur. The attempt has been made by Sayce and others to divide the various
names of Ishtar among the aspects of Venus as morning and evening star, but there is no evidence to show that the
1 That the name is Semitic is no longer seriously questioned by any scholar.
The underlying stem suggests etymological relationship with the god Ashur. If this be so, Ishtar may mean ' the goddess that brings blessing ' to mankind, but all this is tentative, as are the numerous other etymologies suggested.



BABYLONIAN GODS. 83
Babylonians distinguished the one from the other so sharply as to make two goddesses of one and the same planet. It is more in accord with what, as we have seen, has been
the general character of the Babylonian pantheon, to account for the identification of Ninni, Nana, and Anunit with Ishtar
on the supposition that the different names belonged origi
nally to different localities. Ishtar was appropriately denomi
nated the brilliant goddess. She is addressed as the mother
of gods, which signals her supreme position among the female deities. 'The mistress of countries' alternating with
'the mistress of mountains,' 1 is one of her common titles;
and as the growing uniqueness of her position is one of the
features of the Babylonian-Assyrian religion, it is natural that she should become simply the goddess. This was especially the case with the Assyrians, to whom Ishtar became a god
dess of war and battle, the consort, at times, of the chief god
of the Assyrian pantheon. At the same time it is important to note that the warlike character of the goddess goes back
to the time of Hammurabi (Keils Bibl. 3, i, 113), and is dwelt
upon by other Babylonian kings (c.g., Nebuchadnezzar I., c. 1 130
B.C.) prior to the rise of the Assyrian power. How Ishtar came to take on so violent a character is not altogether clear.
There are no indications of this role in the incantation texts,
where she is simply the kind mother who is appealed to, to
release the sufferer from the power of the disease-bringing
spirits. In the prayers, as will be shown in the proper place, she becomes the vehicle for the expression of the highest
religious and ethical thought attained by the Babylonians. On
the other hand, in the great Babylonian epic, 2 dealing with the adventures of a hero, Izdubar (or Gilgamesh), Ishtar, who
1 The ideographs for ' country ' and ' mountain ' are identical Assyrian. The alternation in the title of Ishtar must not be taken to point to a mountainous origin of the goddess.

84 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
makes her appearance at the summer solstice, is a raging goddess who smites those who disobey her commands with wasting
disease. Starting with this phase of the goddess' character, one can at least understand the process of her further develop
ment into a fierce deity presiding over the fortunes of war.
The epic just referred to belongs to the old Babylonian period. It embodies ancient traditions of rivalry between the Babylo
nian principalities, though there are traces of several recastings which the epic received. The violent Ishtar, therefore, is a
type going back to the same period as the other side of her
character that is emphasized elsewhere. Since, moreover, the Ishtar in the Izdubar epic is none other than the chief goddess
of Uruk, all further doubt as to the union of such diverging
traits in one and the same personage falls to the ground.
In this same epic, Ishtar appears as sympathizing with the
sufferings of mankind, and bewailing the destruction that was at one time decreed by the gods. It is noteworthy
that the violent Ishtar appears in that portion of the epic
which, on the assumption of a zodiacal interpretation for the
composition, corresponds to the summer solstice, whereas, the destruction which arouses her sympathy takes place in the
eleventh month. It is quite possible, therefore, that the two
aspects of Venus, as evening and morning stars, corresponding, as they do, to the summer and winter seasons, are reflected in
this double character of the goddess. We are not justified,
however, in going further and assuming that her double role as
daughter of Sin and daughter of Anu is to be accounted for in the same manner. In the Izdubar epic, she is found in associ
ation with Anu, and to the latter she appeals for protection as
her father, and yet it is as the daughter of Sin that she enters the world of the dead to seek for the waters that may heal her
bridegroom, Tammuz. 1 Evidently, the distinction between
1 Again, in the incantation texts she appears only as the daughter of Anu, coordinate with Sin and Shamash.



BABYLONIAN GODS. 85
Ishtar as the daughter of Anu and as the daughter of Sin is not
an important one, the term daughter in both cases being a
metaphor to express a relationship both of physical nature and of a political character. Of the various forms under which the
goddess appears, that of Anunit a feminine form indicating descent from and appertaining to Anu attaches itself most
clearly to the god of heaven, and it may be that it was not until the assimilation of Anunit and Nana with Ishtar that the
goddess is viewed as at once the daughter of Anu and of Sin.
If this be so, there is surely nothing strange in the fact that a
planet like Venus should be regarded in one place as the
daughter of heaven and in another brought into relationship with the moon. She actually belongs to both.
Just as in Babylonia, so in Assyria, there were various Ishtars, or rather various places where the goddess was wor
shipped as the guardian spirit, but her role in the north is so
peculiar that all further consideration of it must be postponed
until we come to consider, in due time, the Assyrian pantheon. There will be occasion, too, when treating of the Izdubar epic, to dwell still further on some of her traits. All that need be
said here is to emphasize the fact that the popularity of the Babylonian Ishtar in Assyria, as manifested by Esarhaddon's zeal in restoring her temple at Uruk, and Ashurbanabal's restora
tion of Nana's statue (c. 635 B.C.) which had been captured by the Elamites 1635 years before Ashurbanabal's reign, is largely
due to the effected identity with the goddess who, for the
Assyrians, was regarded chiefly as the goddess of war and strife. In worshipping the southern Ishtars, the Assyrian kings felt themselves to be showing their allegiance to the same deity
to whom, next to Ashur, most of their supplications were addressed, and of whom as warriors they stood in dread.



86 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
NINA.
A goddess who, while sharing the fate- of her sister god
desses in being overshadowed by Ishtar, yet merits a special
treatment, is one whose name is plausibly conjectured to be read Nina. The compound ideogram expressing the deity
signifies
* house of the fish.' The word ' house ' in Semitic
parlance is figuratively extended to convey the idea of
'
possessing or harboring.' Applied to a settlement, the ideogram would be the equivalent of our ' Fishtown.' It is with
this same ideogram that the famous capitol of Assyria, Nineveh, is written in the cuneiform texts, and since the
phonetic reading for the city, Ni-na-a, also occurs, it is only legitimate to conclude that the latter is the correct reading for
the deity as well. As a matter of course, if the goddess bears
a name identical with that of a city, it cannot be the Assyrian
city which is meant in the old Babylonian inscriptions, but some other place bearing the same name. Such a place
actually occurs in the inscriptions of Gudea. It is, in fact, one of the three towns that combined with Shirpurla to create
the great capitol bearing the latter name; and Jensen 1 has called attention to a passage in one of Gudea's inscriptions in
which the goddess is brought into direct association with the
town, so that it would appear that Nina is the patron of Nina,
in the same way that Nin-girsu is the protector of Girsu. In keeping with this we find the mention of the goddess limited to the
rulers of Lagash. Several of them En-anna-tuma, Entemena, and Gudea declare themselves to have been chosen by her. She is said to regard Gudea with special favor. She determines destinies. Another king, Ur-Nina, embodies the name of the goddess in his own, and devotes himself to the enlargement of her
1 Keils Bibl. 3, i, 72, note. Some scholars, as Hommel (Gcsch. d. alt. Morgenlandes, p. 68), propose to identify this place with the Assyrian Nineveh, but the conjecture lacks proof and is altogether improbable.



BABYLONIAN GODS. 87
temple. From the manner in which she is associated with Nin
girsu. aiding the latter in guarding his temple E-ninnu, and uniting with the god in granting the sceptre to Gudea, one is tempted to conclude that the two towns, Girsu and Nina, were amalga
mated before their absorption into Lagash, so that the god
and goddess acquired the relationship to one another of husband and consort. As for the connection between this
Babylonian Nina and the late Assyrian capital, it is quite possible that the origin of the latter is to be traced to a settle
ment made by inhabitants of the former, although it should be added that there is no positive evidence that can be adduced
in support of this proposition. It accords, however, with the northward movement of culture and civilization in Mesopotamia. If this connection between the two Ninevehs be accepted, the
question suggests itself whether, in time, Nina did not become merely another form of Ishtar. The Assyrian capital is fre
quently spoken of as the * beloved city
' of Ishtar, and unless it
be supposed that this epithet simply reflects the comparatively late popularity of the distinctively Assyrian Ishtar, the most natural explanation would be to propose the equation Nina Ishtar.
In the incantation texts, Nina is frequently appealed to as
the daughter of Ea, the god of the deep. This relationship, as well as the interpretation of the ideogram above set forth,
points to the original character of the goddess as a water-deity. This goddess, therefore, would be of an entirely different form from the ones discussed in the previous paragraphs. Instead
of being a member of the heavenly pantheon, her place is with the kingdom over which Ea presides, and whose dwelling
place is the watery deep. In any case, Nina is originally distinct from Ishtar, Nana, and Anunit ; and she retains an independent existence to a later period than most of the other
great goddesses that have been discussed. In an inscription
of the days of Belnadinaplu (c. noo B.C.), published by Hil



88 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
precht, 1 Nina appears as the patron deity of Der, a city of Southern Babylonia. There too she is called the c
daughter of Ea,' the creator of everything. She is ' the mistress of goddesses.' Attached to her temple there are lands that having been
wrongfully wrested from the priests are returned upon royal
command, under solemn invocation of the goddess. How her worship came to be transferred to Der we do not know. She
appears in the inscription in question by the side of a goddess who following Hommel is none other than Bau. Der is called the city of the god Anu, and we can only suppose that
it must at one time have risen to sufficient importance to harbor
in its midst a number of deities. It is presumably 2 the place
whence Nebuchadnezzar I. sets out in the twelfth century to
drive the Cassites off the throne of Babylonia. May it be
that, during the days of the foreign rule, priests attached to the service of various of the old gods and goddesses transferred the worship of these deities to places more secure from interference ?
Be this as it may, if our Nina has any connection with the
goddess of Nineveh, it is certain that Ishtar has retained none of Nina's traits. The fusion in this case has been so com
plete that naught but the faintest tradition of an original and independent Nina has survived in the North.
ANU.
This god, who, from a theoretical point of view (as will be
shown in a subsequent chapter), was regarded as standing at the head of the organized Babylonian pantheon, figures only
incidentally in the inscriptions prior to the days of Hammurabi. Ur-Bau of the first dynasty of Ur, in invoking Nannar, calls
1 Old Babylonian Inscriptions, i. pis. 30, 31. (See now Peiser, Keils Bibl. 4, pp. 64-66.) 2 Questioned by Peiser, ib.



BABYLONIAN GODS. 89
the latter 'the powerful bull of Anu.' The reference is inter
esting, for it shows that already in these early days the position of Ann, as the god of the heavenly expanse, was fixed. The moon appearing in the heavens, and the resemblance of its
crescent to a bull's horn, 1 are the two factors that account for
the expressive epithet used by Ur-Bau. That the worship of the god of heaven par excellence should not have enjoyed great
popularity in the early days of the Babylonian religion might
seem strange at first sight. A little reflection, however, will
make this clear. A god of the heavens is an abstract concep
tion, and while it is possible that even in an early age, such a
conception may have arisen in some minds, it is not of a
character calculated to take a popular hold. As we proceed
in our attempt to trace the development of the Babylonian religion, we will find the line of demarcation separating the
theological system, as evolved by the schoolmen, from the popular phases of the religion, becoming more marked. In the inscriptions of the old Babylonian rulers, comparatively little of the influence of the Babylonian theologians is to be detected. Even the description of the moon as the bull of heaven falls
within the domain of popular fancy. It is different in the days
after Hammurabi, when political concentration leads to the
focussing of intellectual life in the Euphrates Valley, with all
the consequences that the establishment of a central priesthood,
with growing powers over ever-increasing territory, involves. It is to be noted, moreover, that the manner in which in the
old Babylonian inscriptions Anu is written, 2 indicates that the abstraction involved in the conception of a god of heaven
had not yet been reached, though some measure of personification was of course inevitable at a time when animistic

90 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
notions still held sway. A direct indication of this per
sonification of heaven without the deification appears in
the epithet
* child of Anu,' bestowed upon the goddess Bau. The reference to the heavens in this connection is
an allusion to Bau's position as the patroness of that quarter
of Lagash known as the 'brilliant town,' 1 and where Bau's temple stood. The transference of the quality of '
brilliancy
'
from the town to the goddess would be expressed by calling the latter the offspring of that part of visible nature which is
associated in the mind with '
brilliancy.' Somewhat mysterious,
and still awaiting a satisfactory explanation, is the title * sacri
ficer,' or *
priest of Anu,' which one of the rulers of Lagash,
Ur-Nin-girsu, assumes. It is scarcely possible that the god of heaven can be meant ; and, on the other hand, if we are to
assume merely a personification of heaven, we encounter fresh difficulties. It seems to me that the use of Anu 2 here is
purely metaphorical for '
high ' or '
lofty,' and that the king merely wishes to emphasize the dignity of his station by declaring himself to be the heavenly priest, somewhat as we should say
*
priest by divine grace/ or f supreme priest.'
NlN-SI 3-A.
Ur-Bau and Gudea alone of the ancient rulers refer to this
god. The former erects a temple in honor of the god in some
quarter of his capitol city, while the latter emphasizes the strength that the god has given him. These references, however, show that the god must have been of considerable impor
tance, and in this case, his disappearance from the later
pantheon is probably due to the absorption of his role by the

BABYLONIAN GODS. 91
greater god of Lagash, Nin-girsu. Like Nin-girsu, Nin-si-a was a god of war, and his worship, imported perhaps from some ancient site to Lagash, falls into desuetude, as the
attribute accorded to him becomes the distinguishing trait of
the chief deity of the place.
GAL-ALIM.
Among the various deities to whom Gudea gives praise for
the position and glory which he attains is Gal-alim. 1 From
him he has received great rule and a lofty sceptre. The
phrase is of a very general nature and reveals nothing as to
the special character of the god in question. An earlier king,
Uru-kagina, refers to the temple of the god at LagaSh. Gal-alim may have been again a merely local deity belonging to one of the towns that fell under Gudea's rule, and whose attributes again
were so little marked that this god too disappeared under the
overshadowing importance of Nin-girsu. He and another god, Dun-shagga, aie viewed as the sons of Nin-girsu.
Coming to some of the deities that we may designate as
minor, it is to be noted that in the case of certain ones, at least,
it will be found that they may be identified with others more
prominent, and that what seem to be distinct names are in
reality descriptive epithets of gods already met with. This remark applies more particularly to such names as begin with
the element Nin, signifying either 'lord' or 'lady,' and which, when followed by the name of a place, always points to its
being a title, and, when followed by an ideographic compound,
only diminishes that probability to a slight degree. We have already come across several instances ; thus Nin-girsu, the
1 Inscription B, col. ii. 19.



92 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
lord of Girsu, has been shown to be a form of Ninib, itself an
ideogram, the reading of which, it will be recalled, is still
uncertain; and again, Nin-khar-sag has been referred to, as one of the titles of the great goddess Belit. Similarly, Nin
gish-zida, whose name signifies
' the lord of the right-hand (or
propitious) sceptre,' becomes a title and not a name, and when Gudea speaks of this god as the one who leads him to
battle, and calls him *
king,' he is simply describing the same god who is elsewhere spoken of as Nin-girsu. By the
side of Nin-girsu and Nin-gish-zida appears Nin-shakh, who, as Oppert l has shown, is like Nin-girsu the prototype of the wellknown god of war, Ninib. However, Nin-shakh occupies, in
contradistinction to Nin-gish-zida and others, a position in the
old Babylonian pantheon of an independent character, so that it is hardly justifiable, in such a case, to identify him completely with Ninib, and place the name on a par with the
epithets just referred to. The dividing line between the mere
title and an independent god thus becomes at times very faint, and yet it is well to maintain it whenever called for. In the
following enumeration of the minor gods of the old Babylonian
pantheon, the attempt will be made to bring out this distinction
in each instance.
Beginning with
NIN-SHAKH
the element Nin, as has several times been mentioned, points to an ideographic form. The second element signifies
' wild
boar,' and from other sources we know that this animal was a sacred one in Babylonia, as among other Semitic nations. 2
Its flesh, on certain days of the Babylonian calendar, was
1 See Hommel, Scmitische Kulturen, p. 389. 2 For the sacred character of the swine among the Semites, see W. Robertson
Smith's The Religion of the Semites, pp. 201, 272. 332, 457. Rawlinson, iii. 68, 22, occurs a deity,
' swine of the right hand,' i.e., propitious.



BABYLONIAN GODS. 93
forbidden to be eaten, from which we are permitted to conclude that these days were dedicated to the animal, and the prohibi
tion represents perhaps the traces of some old religious festival. May Nin-shakh therefore have been a ' swine deity,' just as
Nergal is symbolized by the ' lion '
? In both cases the animal
would be a symbol of the violent and destructive character of
the god. The ferocious character of the ' swine ' would naturally
result in assigning to Nin-shakh warlike attributes ; and as a matter of fact he is identified at times with Ninib. His subor
dinate position, however, is indicated by his being called the
'servant,' generally of En-lil, occasionally also of Anu, and as such he bears the name of Pap-sukal, 1
*>.,
' divine messenger.' Rim-Sin builds a temple to Nin-shakh at Uruk, and from its
designation as his 'favorite dwelling place' we may conclude that Rim-Sin only restores or enlarges an ancient temple of the
deity. In the light of this, the relationship above set forth between Nin-girsu, Nin-gish-zida, and Nin-shakh becomes some
what clearer. The former, the local deity of Girsu, would natu
rally be called by the kings
' the lord of the true sceptre,' while
the subordination of Girsu as a quarter of Lagash finds its reflec
tion in the relationship of master and servant pictured as
existing between En-lil and Nin-girsu. Again, the warlike character of the patron deity of Girsu would lead to an identi
fication with Nin-shakh of Uruk, possessing the same traits ;
and the incorporation of Uruk as a part of the same empire which included Lagash and its quarters, would be the last
link bringing about the full equation between the three. With
Ninib the solar deity coming into prominence as the god of war, all three names, Nin-girsu, Nin-gish-zida, and Nin
1 Rawlinson, ii. 59, 23. The second element in Pap-sukal is the common Babylonian word for 'servant,' or 'messenger'; other deities therefore standing in a
subsidiary position are also called Pap-sukal. So e.g., Nebo and Nusku. See further on and compare Hommel, Scmitcn, pp. 479, 480.



94 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
shakh, would be regarded by a later age as merely descriptive of one and the same god.
DUN-SHAGGA.
Gudea makes mention in one of his inscriptions, by the side
of Nin-gish-zida, of a god Dun-shagga, 1 whose name signifies the ' chief hero,' but the phonetic reading of which it is impossible to determine. 2 Like Nin-gish-zida, he is a warlike god,
and from that one might suppose that he too is only another
form of Nin-girsu-Ninib. At all events, he did not differ
materially from the latter. It is from him, that Gudea again declares his power to be derived, just as elsewhere he accords
to Nin-girsu this distinction. The element * Dun,' which is very much the same as *
Nin,' speaks in favor of regarding Dun-shagga as a title ; but, in default of positive evidence, it
will not be out of place to give him an independent position, and to regard his identification with Nin-girsu as a later phase
due to the extension of Nin-girsu's jurisdiction and his corre
sponding absorption of a varying number of minor gods. This tendency on the part of the greater gods to absorb the minor
ones is as distinctive a trait in the development of the Baby
lonian religion, as is the subordination of one god to the other,
whether expressed by making the subordinate god the consort,
the chief, or the servant of a superior one. We have seen
that such terms of relationship correspond to certain degrees of political conditions existing between the conquering and the
conquered districts. Amalgamation of two cities or districts
is portrayed in the relation of the two patron deities as hus
band and wife, the stronger of the two being the former, the
1 Inscription B, col. iii. 2. 2 Uru-kagina, earlier than Gudea (de Sarzec, pi. 32), appears to have built a temple to Dun-shagga, but the passage is not altogether clear. The element also appears in the name of the ruler of Ur, Dungi, *'..,
' the legitimate hero,' as Sargon is the
'
legitimate king.'



BABYLONIAN GODS. 95
more subservient pictured as the latter. The more pronounced
superiority of the one place over the other finds expression in the relation of father to child, while that of master and servant
emphasizes the complete control exercised by the one over the
other. Lastly, the absorption of one deity into another, is correlative either with the most perfect form of conquest, or
the complete disappearance of the seat of his worship in consequence of the growing favor of one possessing sufficiently similar qualities to warrant identification with the other.
LUGAL-BANDA.
Sin-gashid of the dynasty of Uruk makes mention of this
deity at the beginning of one of his inscriptions. To him and to his consort, Nin-gal, a temple as 'the seat of their joy' at that place. This association of the god with the
town points again to a local deity, but possessing a character which leads to the absorption of the god in the solar god,
Nergal, whom we have already encountered, and who will occupy us a good deal when we come to the period after
Hammurabi. The identification of the two is already foreshadowed in an inscription of another member of the same
dynasty, Sin-gamil, who places the name of Nergal exactly where his predecessor mentions Lugal-banda. The first ele
ment in his name signifies 'king,' the second apparently
'
strong/ so that in this respect, too, the god comes close to Nergal, whose name likewise indicates 'great lord.' The consort of
Lugal-banda is
NlN-GUL.
Her name signifies 'the destructive lady,' an appropriate epithet for the consort of a solar deity. It is Sin-gashid again who associates Ningul with Lugal-banda, and emphasizes his affection for the goddess by calling her his mother. In one



96 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
inscription, moreover, Sin-gashid addresses himself exclusively to the goddess, who had an equal share in the temple at Uruk.
DUMUZI-ZU-ABA.
Among the deities appealed to by Ur-Bau appears one whose
name is to be interpreted as the *
unchangeable child of the watery deep.' The great god of the deep we have seen is Ea. Dumuzi-zu-aba therefore belongs to the water-deities, and one who, through his subordinate rank to Ea, sinks to the level of a water-spirit. Ur-Bau declares himself to be the darling
of this deity, and in the town of Girsu he erects a temple to
him. Girsu, however, was not the patron city of the god, for Ur-Bau gives Dumuzi-zu-aba, the appellation of * the lord of Kinunira,' l a place the actual situation of which is unknown.
Dumuzi-zu-aba, accordingly, is to be regarded as a local deity of a place which, situated probably on an arm of the Euphrates, was the reason for the watery attributes assigned to the god.
The comparative insignificance of the place is one of the factors that accounts for the minor importance of the god, and
the second factor is the popularity enjoyed by another child of
the great Ea, his child par excellence, Marduk, who is best known as the patron god of the city of Babylon. By the side of Marduk, the other children of Ea, the minor water-deities,
disappear, so that to a later generation Dumuzi-zu-aba appears merely as a form of Marduk. With Dumuzi-zu-aba, we must be careful not to confuse
DUMU-ZI,
who in the old Babylonian inscriptions is mentioned once by
Sin-iddina, 2 in connection with the sun-god. Dumu-zi, signify
ing 'child of life,' has a double aspect an agricultural deity

and at the same time a god of the lower world. He plays an
important part in the eschatological literature of the Babylonians, but hardly none at all in the historical and incantation
texts. A fuller treatment may therefore be reserved for a future
chapter.
LUGAL-ERIMA.
A purely local deity, if the reading and interpretation offered by Jensen,
' King of the city Erim,' is correct. The mention
of the deity in an inscription of Ur-Bau, who calls himself the ' beloved servant ' of this god, would be due to the circum
stance that the district within which the city in question lay
was controlled by the rulers of Lagash. To invoke as large a
number of deities as possible was not only a means of securing
protection from many sides, but was already in the early days of Babylonian history indulged in by rulers, as a means of emphasizing the extent and manifold character of their juris
diction.
NlN-E-GAL AND NlNGAL.
A temple was erected to Nin-e-gal by the wife of Rim-Sin, of the second dynasty of Ur and Akkad. Her name as inter
preted in the tablet dedicated to her, signifies again, as in
several cases already noted, 'great lady.' She was probably therefore only the consort of some patron deity ; and Nannar
being the most prominent god invoked by Rim-Sin, it would seem that the goddess to whom the queen pays her respects is again one of the consorts of the moon-god. 1 This conclusion
is supported by the direct association of Nannar of Ur and
Ningal in an inscription emanating from an earlier member of the same dynasty to which Rim-Sin belongs. Nur-Ramman
speaks of building temples to these deities in the city of Ur.
Hence the goddess is also represented as interceding with
1 So also Jensen, Kosmologie, p. 14, note 3.



98 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
Sin on behalf of those who appeal to her. The form Nin
e-gal is but a variant of Nin-gal, so that the identification
of the two lies beyond doubt, and it may very well be that the temple erected by the consort of Rim-Sin is the same as the one referred to by Nur-Ramman. In a land where
polygamy was a prevailing custom, the gods too might be represented as having a number of consorts. There would
of course be, just as in human relations, one chief consort, but there might be others ranged at the side of the latter. 1 Some of these may have been consorts of other minor deities, wor
shipped in the same district, and who were given to the more
important divinity as he gradually overshadowed the others. In this way, we may account for the large variety of ' ladies ' and '
great ladies ' met with in the Babylonian pantheon, and who, being merely
' reflections ' of male deities, with no
sharply marked traits of their own, would naturally come to be confused with one another, and finally be regarded as various forms of one and the same goddess. Still another member of
the second dynasty of Ur, En-anna-tuma, earlier even than
Nur-Ramman, invokes Nin-gal in an inscription found in the ancient capital, Ur. Here, too, the goddess appears in associa
tion with Nannar ; but, curiously enough, she is designated as the mother of Shamash. It will be borne in mind that in the
city of Ur, the sun-god occupied a secondary place at the side of the moon-god. This relationship is probably indicated by
the epithet
'
offspring of Nin-gal,' accorded to Shamash in the
inscription referred to. The moon being superior to the sun, the consort of the moon-god becomes the mother of the sun
god. Reference has several times been made to
l So Anu appears to have concubines.



BABYLONIAN GODS. 99
NlN-GISH-ZIDA,
who, originally a distinct solar deity, becomes scarcely distin
guishable from Nin-girsu, and is eventually identified with the great Nin-ib. 1 It is noticeable that these four deities, Nin
girsu, Nin-shakh, Nin-gish-zida, and Nin-ib, who are thus associated together, all contain the element Nin in their names,
a factor that may turn out to be of some importance when
more abundant material shall be forthcoming for tracing their
development in detail. One of Gudea's inscriptions 2 begins with the significant statement,
'
Nin-gish-zida is the god of Gudea'; and elsewhere when speaking of him, he is 'my god,' or ' his god.' None of the ancient Babylonian rulers make
mention of him except Gudea, though in the incantation texts he is introduced and significantly termed 'the throne-bearer' of
the earth. The purely local character of the deity is, further
more, emphasized by the reference to his temple in Girsu, on a
brick and on a cone containing dedicatory inscriptions, inscribed by Gudea in honor of the god. 3
SHUL-PA-UDDU.
The wife of the famous Gudea, Gin-Shul-pa-uddu, bears a name in which one of the elements is a deity, the phonetic
reading of whose name is still uncertain. 4 The elements com
prising it, namely,
' lord '
(?),
'
sceptre,' and '
radiant,' leave little doubt as to the solar character of the god. Besides Gudea's
wife, a ruler, Ur-Shul-pa-uddu, 5 belonging apparently to a somewhat earlier period, embodies this deity in his name. The wor
ship of the deity, therefore, belongs to a very early epoch, and
1 See above, pp. 92, 93. 2 Inscription C. 3 De Sarzec, pi. 37, no. 5 ; Trans. Soc. Bibl. Arch. vi. 279. 4 Jensen, Kosmologie, p. 127, proposes to read Umun-pauddu. 5 Hilprecht, Old Babylonian Inscriptions, i. 2, no. 93. The name also appears in syllabaries as Shul-pa-ud-du-a. For the element pa-udda, see p. 103. In Nergal's name Shid-lam-ta-uddu-a (p. 65), the same final elements are found which appear to be characteristic epithets of solar deities. The first element in the name has also the
value Dun (as in Dun-gi).



100 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
appears at one time to have enjoyed considerable popularity
within a certain district of Babylonia. To what region of
Babylonia he belongs has not yet been ascertained. Judging from analogous instances, he represented some phase of the sun
worshipped in a particular locality, whose cult, with the disappearance of the place from the surface of political affairs,
yielded to the tendency to concentrate sun-worship in two or three deities, Shamash and Ninib more especially. In the
astronomy of the Babylonians the name survived as a designation of Marduk-Jupiter. 1
NIN-MAR.
A local deity, designated as the lady of Mar, is invoked by Ur-Bau, from whom we learn that she was the daughter of Nina. Mar, with the determinative for country, Ki, appears
to have been the name of a district extending to the Persian
Gulf. 2 The capital of the district is represented by the mound
Tel-Id, not far from Warka. Her subsidiary position is indicated in these words, and we may conclude that Nin-Mar at
an early period fell under the jurisdiction of the district in
which Nina was supreme. For all that, Nin-Mar, or the city in which her cult was centralized, must have enjoyed considerable favor. Ur-Bau calls her the '
gracious lady,' and erects a
temple, the name of which, Ish-gu-tur,3
i.e., according to Jensen's
plausible interpretation,
' the house that serves as a court for
all persons,-' points to Mar as a place of pilgrimage to which people came from all sides. Gudea, accordingly, does not omit to include ' the lady of Mar ' in his list of the chief deities to
whom he pays his devotions ; and on the assumption of the general favor in which the city of Mar stood as a sacred town,
we may account for the fact that a much later ruler, Dungi,
of the dynasty of Ur, 4 erects a temple to her honor.

BABYLONIAN GODS. 101
PA-SAG.
A deity, the phonetic reading of whose name is unknown, or at all events uncertain, 1 is mentioned once by Gudea in the long list of deities that has been several times referred to.
The ideographs with which his name is written designate him as a chief of some kind, and in accord with this, Gudea calls
him ' the leader of the land.' Pa-sag is mentioned immediately after the sun-god Utu, and in view of the fact that another solar deity, I-shum, whom we shall come across in a future
chapter, is designated by the same title 2 as Pa-sag, it seems safe to conclude that the latter is likewise a solar deity, and in
all probability, the prototype of I-shum, if not indeed identical with him.
NISABA (OR NIDABA).
In a dream which the gods send to Gudea, he sees among other things, a goddess, whose name may be read Nisaba or Nidaba. 3 Nina, who interprets the dream to the ruler of Shirpurla, declares that Nisaba is her sister. In a text belong
ing to a still earlier age, the deity is mentioned as the begetter of a king whose name is read Lugal-zaggisi.4 From the manner in which the name of the goddess is written, as well as from other sources, we know that Nisaba is an agricultural
deity. In. historical texts she plays scarcely any role at all, but in incantations she is often referred to ; and from the fact that
Nisaba is appealed to, to break the power of the demons in
conjunction with Ea, it would appear that the position once occupied by her was no insignificant one. Nin-girsu, it will
1 Jensen regards Pa-sag as a possible phonetic form, but his view is hardly tenable.

be recalled, has also traits which connect him with agricultural
life, and Nina being the daughter of Nin-si-a, one of the forms under which Ningirsu-Ninib appears, we may connect Nisaba directly with the cults of which Lagash formed the center. Nisaba must have been the consort of one of the agricultural
gods, whose jurisdiction falls within Gudea's empire. Lugalzaggisi, as the king of Uruk, assigns to the goddess a first place. Her origin must, therefore, be sought in this region. In later days the name of the goddess is used to describe the
fertility of the soil in general. So Ashurbanabal, describing the prosperity existing in his days, says that grain was abundant through the ' increase of Nisaba.' l
KU(?)-ANNA.
A goddess of this name reading of the first sign doubtful is mentioned by Ur-Bau, who builds a temple to her in Girsu. If
Amiaud is correct in his reading of the first sign, the goddess
was identified at one time by the Babylonians with the consort of
Ramman the storm-god. This would accord with the description that Ur-Bau gives of the goddess. She is the one who deluges the land with water belonging therefore to the same order as Bau.
In a list of deities enumerated by a ruler of Erech, Lugal
zaggisi,
2 are found (i) a local goddess,
UMU,
designated as the *
priestess of Uruk,' 3 and occupying an inferior rank to (2) a goddess,
1 VR. col. i. 48. 2 See at close of chapter vi.
3 Hilprecht, ib. no. 87, col. i. 30.



BABYLONIAN GODS. 103
NlN-AKHA-KUDDU, 1
who is called ' the mistress of Uruk.' The importance of Erech
in the early history of Babylonia is emphasized by the inscriptions from Nippur, recently published by Dr. Hilprecht. It is natural, therefore, to find several deities of a purely local type commemorated by kings who belong to this region. The
goddess Umu is not heard of again. The great goddess of Uruk, Nana, absorbs the smaller ones, and hence Nin-akha
kuddu survives chiefly in incantation texts as ' the lady of
shining waters,' of '
purification,' and of ' incantations.' 2
Lastly, a passing reference may be made to several deities
to whom sanctuaries are erected by Uru-Kagina in the great
temple of Bau at Uru-azaga, and whom Amiaud regards as sons of Bau.
Uru-Kagina enumerates three, Za-za-uru, Im-pa-ud-du, and Gim-nun-ta-ud-du-a. 3 The element ud-du in the last two names
signifies
' radiant ' or *
rising up '; while pa-ud-du (like in Shul
pa-ud-du, p. 99) means ' radiant sceptre.' If to this, we add that Im is '
storm,' it will appear plausible to see in the second name a form of a raging solar deity and perhaps also in the
third ; gim nun in the latter name may mean '
creating lord.' To these Amiaud 4 adds from other sources, Khi-gir-nunna, Khi-shaga, Gurmu, and Zarmu. He takes these seven deities as sons of Bau, but he offers no conclusive evidence for his
theory. Some of these deities may turn out to be synonymous with such as have already been met with.
1 Ib. i. 32. Hilprecht reads Nin-a-gid-kha-du, but this can hardly be correct. 2 The two ideas,
' water ' and '
incantation,' are correlated. The ' waters ' meant are those used for purification purposes in connection with the magic formulas.
3 De Sarzec.pl. 32, col. ii. 9-11. 4 Records of the Past, N.S., i. 59. Amiaud reads the second name Im-ghud-ena and the third Gim (or Ur)-nun-ta-ena. The publication in De Sarzec favors my readings.



CHAPTER V.
THE CONSORTS OF THE GODS.
ATTENTION has already been directed to the comparatively
small number of female deities that appear in the inscriptions of
the first period of Babylonian history. We must, however, not conclude from this, that such deities did not exist in larger num
bers. On the contrary, we may feel certain that every god had his consort, and in some cases more than one. Several instances of such consorts have been furnished in this chapter ; but if the consorts of the larger number of these gods are unknown,
it is because of the insignificant role that these consorts played.
The goddesses of Babylonia, with few exceptions, become mere shadowy reflections of the gods, with but little independent
power, and in some cases none at all. They owe what popu
larity they enjoyed to their association with their male com
panions. In consequence of this inferior role played by the female deities, the tendency becomes more pronounced, as we
pass from the first to the second period of Babylonian history, to reduce by assimilation the small number that have independent attributes, until we reach a condition in which we have
practically only one goddess, appearing under many forms. It is only in the religious texts, and in some phases of the popular
beliefs, that goddesses retain a certain degree of prominence.
So, a goddess Allat, as we shall see, plays an important part as the chief goddess of the subterranean cave that houses the dead. Allat appears to have been originally a consort of the famous Bel of Nippur, but through association with Nergal, who becomes the chief god of the lower world, almost all traces
of the original character of the goddess disappear. Again,



THE CONSORTS OF THE GODS. 105
Gula, the consort of Nin-ib, while occasionally mentioned in
the historical texts of the second and third period, and under the
form Ma-ma, as an element in a proper name belonging to the oldest period, 1 is more frequently invoked in incantations as the
healer of disease. The same is the case with other goddesses ;
so that we may conclude that from the earliest times, the Baby
lonian religion scared the trait so marked in all Semitic cults, of a
combination of the male and female principle in the personifica
tion of the powers that controlled the fate of man. In part, no
doubt, the minor importance of women, so far as the outward
aspects of social and political life were concerned, is a factor in
the altogether secondary importance attaching to the consorts of the gods ; but we may feel certain that there was no god, how
ever restricted in his jurisdiction, or however limited in the
number of his worshippers, who had not associated with him a
female companion, who follows him as the shadow follows the
substance.
1 According to Hilprecht, ib. p. 48, note 6. For Ma-ma and Me-me, as names of Gula, see chapter viii.



CHAPTER VI.
GUDEA'S PANTHEON.
GUDEA manifests a fondness for giving to his pantheon as
large a compass as possible. In this respect, he follows earlier examples, and also sets an example which is followed by many of
the rulers of Babylonia and Assyria, who felt that the larger the number of gods invoked by them, the more impressive would
their own position appear in the eyes of their subjects. Moreover, by incorporating in their pantheon the gods associated with districts that they controlled, they would not only secure the protection of these deities, but would emphasize their own claim
to an extended sovereignty. The beginning and the close of
dedicatory and commemorative inscriptions were the favorite
opportunities, seized upon by the kings, for parading the list of the powers under whose patronage they wished to appear. These lists are both interesting and valuable, as furnishing in a convenient form a summary of the chief gods included in the
Babylonian pantheon at the various historical periods. At the close of one of his inscriptions, 1 Gudea furnishes a list of no
less than eighteen deities. In rapid succession he enumerates
Anu, En-lil (Bel), Nin-khar-sag, En-ki (Ea), En-zu (Sin), Ningirsu, Nina, Nin-si-a, Ga-sig-dug, Bau, Ninni, Utu (Shamash),
Pa-sag, Gal-alim, Dun-shagga, Nin-Mar, Dumuzi-zuaba, Ningish-zida. These deities may be taken as indicative of the
territorial extent of Gudea's jurisdiction. They are called upon
to punish him who attempts to alter the decrees of the ruler, or
to efface the memory of his deeds. Again, at the beginning
of one of his inscriptions, he appeals to Nin-girsu, En-lil, Nina,
1 Inscr. B, cols. viii. ix.



GUDEA'S PANTHEON. 107
Bau, Ga-sig-dug, Gal-alim, and Dun-shagga. He recounts what he has done to promote the cults of these deities, and
upon his conduct he grounds his hope that they will aid him in
his undertakings. The lists, as will be observed, vary in the number and in the order of the gods enumerated. In the
second list, the position of Nin-girsu at the head is due to the fact that the inscription commemorates the dedication of a
sanctuary to that god. But Nin-girsu, despite his rank as the chief god of Lagash, belongs to a second class of deities.
Standing far above him is the triad, Anu, Bel, and Ea, the gods that personify, as we have seen, the great divisions of the
universe, heaven, earth, and water. These gods, accordingly, take precedence of Nin-girsu in the first list. In a succeeding chapter, the significance of this triad for the Babylonian religion will be fully set forth. For the present, it is sufficient to note
that the systematization of popular beliefs, involved in the distinctions thus emphasized in the groupings of deities into
classes, begins at so early a period. This systematization, however, has not yet assumed final shape. True, the moon
god has already been given the place, immediately following upon the triad, that he will hold in the developed form of Baby
lonian theology ; but while, as we have seen, Sin properly takes precedence of the sun-god, the latter should follow in the wake
of his associate. Not only, however, does Nin-girsu precede, but two other deities who are closely related in general char
acter to the ' warrior deity
' of Gudea's dominion. Then the
two great goddesses, Bau and Ninni, are introduced, and it is
not until they are disposed of that the sun-god, together again with Pa-sag as a kind of lieutenant, 1 is invoked. In the
arrangement of the five remaining deities, no special principle
can be recognized. They, evidently, occupy a minor rank. It is possible, then, to distinguish no less than four classes in the
old Babylonian pantheon : (i) the great triad, Anu, Bel, and Ea ;
1 See above, p. 101.



108 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
(2) a second group, as yet incomplete, but which will eventually include Sin, Shamash, and Ramman, representing the great powers of nature moon, sun, and storm ; (3) the great gods, the patron deities of the more important political centers of
the country ; and (4) the minor ones, representing the local
cults of less important places. Naturally, the dividing line between the two last-named classes is not sharply marked, and
in accordance with the ever-varying political kaleidoscope, local deities will rise from the rank of minor gods to a higher place
in the pantheon ; while such as once enjoyed high esteem will,
through decline in the political fortunes of their worshippers, be brought down from the higher to an inferior rank. 1 It is
this constant interaction between the political situation and the
relationship of the gods to one another, that constitutes one of
the most striking features of the religion of Babylonia and
Assyria. In the course of time, as an organized pantheon
leads to greater stability in the domain of theological specula
tion, the influence of the politics of the country on the religion
becomes less marked, without, however, disappearing altogether. The various classes into which the gods are divided, are definitely
fixed by the schools of theology that, as we shall see, take
their rise in the Euphrates Valley. The rivalry, on the one
hand, between the Babylonian empire united under one head, and the Assyrian empire on the other, alone remains to bring about an occasional exchange of places between the two gods
who stand at the head of the great gods of the Babylonian and
Assyrian pantheon respectively. The attempt has been made by Amiaud 2 to arrange the pantheon of this oldest period in a
genealogical order. In Gudea's long list of deities, he detects three generations, the three chief gods and one goddess, as
the progenitors of Sin, Shamash, Nin-girsu, Bau, and others.
1 See \Yinckler's excellent remarks on the relationship between the city and the god in ancient Babylonia (AUorientalische Forschungen, iii. 232-235). 2 Records of the Past, N.S., i. 57-59.



GUDEA'S PANTHEON. 109
The gods of this second division give rise to a third class,
viewed again as the offspring of the second. Professor Davis,
taking up this idea of Amiaud, has quite recently maintained l that the family idea must form our starting-point for an under
standing of the pantheon of Lagash. The theory, however, does not admit of consistent application. There are gods, as
Amiaud recognized, who cannot be brought under his scheme, so far at least as present testimony is concerned ; and others
can only by an arbitrary assumption be forced into accord with the theory. Moreover, we should expect to find traces of this
family idea in the later phases of the Assyro-Babylonian pan
theon. Such, however, is not the case. A more reasonable
and natural explanation of the relationship existing between many not all of the gods of Gudea's pantheon has already
been suggested. In part, we must look to the development of a theological system of thought in the Euphrates Valley to account for the superior position accorded to certain gods, and
in part, political conditions and political changes afford an explanation for the union of certain deities into a family
group. So far, indeed, Amiaud is correct, that the relationship existing between the various deities, was as a rule expressed in
terms applicable to human society. The secondary position occupied, e.g., by Sin when compared with a god whose domain is the entire ' lower regions,' would be aptly expressed by calling the moon-god the eldest son of En-lil or Bel ; and,
similarly, a goddess like Bau would be called the daughter of
Anu. It is a mistake, however, to interpret the use of '
daughter ' and ' son '
literally. Such terms are employed in all Semitic
languages in a figurative sense, to indicate a dependent position of some sort. Again, we have seen that the union of a number of cities or states under one head would be followed by a union
of the deities proper to these cities or states. That union would
1 In a paper on " The Gods of Shirpurla," read before the American Oriental
Society in April, 1895. (Proceedings, ccxiii-ccxviii.)



110 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
be expressed, according to circumstances, either by placing the deities on a footing of equality in which case they would be
consorts, or brothers and sisters, offsprings therefore of one
and the same god or, the superior rank of one patron god would be indicated by assigning to the god of a conquered or subordinate territory the rank of offspring or attendant.
In studying such a list as that presented by Gudea, we must, therefore, make due allowance for what may be called local
peculiarities and local conditions. It is only by comparing his list with others that we can differentiate between the general
features of Babylonian cults and the special features due to
political and local associations. We are in a position now to
institute this comparison for a period which is certainly some centuries earlier than Gudea. The date of the reign of Lugal
zaggisi, king of Uruk, who has been several times referred to
in a previous chapter, is fixed by Hilprecht at c. 4500 B.C., but it is doubtful whether so high an age will be accepted
by scholars. The chronology for the period beyond Gudea is
still in a very uncertain condition. Lugal-zaggisi, in a long list
of deities at the beginning of an important inscription, enumerates in succession Anu, the goddess Nisaba, the gods En-lil
(or Bel), En-ki (=Ea), En-zu (Sin), Utu (the sun-god), the goddess Ninni (or Nana[?]), Nin-khar-sag, Umu, and Nin-akhakuddu. As for Anu, the king introduces the name, as Ur
Ningirsu of Lagash does (see above, p. 90), in calling himself
'
priest of Anu,' and which, according to the explanation sug
gested, means simply
* divine priest.' Bel, Ea, Sin, and Shamash (or Utu) are common to Gudea
and Lugal-zaggisi. These constitute, then, the great gods whose worship is no longer limited to any particular district. They have become common property, in part through the sanc
tity attached to the places where the gods were worshipped,
in part through the antiquity of these places, and in part, no doubt, as the result of a political development lying behind



GUDEA'S PANTHEON. Ill
the period under consideration. The prominence given by
Lugal-zaggisi to Nisaba is rather surprising. He calls himself
and also his father,
' hero ' of Nisaba. If, however, it be borne in mind that of the goddesses at least two, Umu and Nin-akha
kuddu, are of a local character, the conclusion appears justified that Nisaba was a goddess associated more particularly with the district in which Uruk lay. The goddess Ninni (written
simply as ' the goddess ') is no doubt identical with the great
Nana of Uruk, and Nin-khar-sag is introduced as the consort
of En-lil.
As a result of this comparison, we may note the tendency
towards a general recognition of certain great gods, which is more fully developed in the period of Hammurabi. At the
same time, the loyalty of the rulers to the gods, peculiar to their
own district, is manifested by the prominent place assigned in the several cases to gods who otherwise play an insignificant
role, and who eventually are absorbed by others; and lastly, as between Lugal-zaggisi and Gudea, the observation may be
made of the disposition to emphasize local gods, less for their own sake, than because of the eclat furnished by the enumeration
of a large pantheon, which shall be coequal in extent and dignity to the district claimed by the rulers and to the rank assumed by them.



CHAPTER VII.
SUMMARY.
WE have thus passed in review the old Babylonian pantheon, so far as the discovered texts have revealed their names and epithets. The list does not claim to be exhaustive.
That future texts will add to its length, by revealing the
existence at this early period of many known to us at
present only from later texts or from the religious literature, 1
is more than likely. The nature of the old Babylonian religion
entails, as a necessary consequence, an array of gods that might be termed endless. Local cults would ever tend to increase with the rise of new towns, and while the deities thus
worshipped would not rise to any or much importance, still their names would become known in larger circles, and a ruler
might, for the sake of increasing his own lustre, make mention of one or more of them, honoring them at the same time by
an epithet which might or might not accurately define their character. As long as the various districts of Babylonia were
not formally united under one head, various local cults might
rise to equally large proportions, while the gods worshipped as the special patrons of the great centers, as Lagash, Ur, Uruk, Nippur, and the like, would retain their prominence, even though the political status of the cities sacred to them
1 Quite recently there have been found at Telloh some thirty thousand clay tablets, chiefly lists of sacrifices, temple inventories, and legal documents. These tablets will probably furnish additional names of deities, and perhaps throw further light on those known. Further excavations at Nippur will likewise add to the material. But after all, for our main purpose in this chapter, which is the illustration of the chief traits of the Babylonian pantheon in early days, these expected additions to the pantheon will not be of paramount significance.



SUMMARY. 113
suffered a decline. The ruler of the district that claimed a
supremacy over one that formerly occupied an independent position, would hasten to emphasize this control by proudly claiming the patron deity as part of his pantheon. The popularity of Sin at Ur suffered no diminution because the supremacy
of Ur yielded to that of Uruk. On the contrary, the god gained new friends who strove to rival the old ones in manifestations
of reverence ; and when, as happened in several instances, the
patron deities were personifications of natural phenomena, whose worship through various circumstances became associate'd with particular localities, there was an additional reason for the
survival, and, indeed, growing importance of such local cults, quite independent of the political fortunes that befell the cities
in which the gods were supposed to dwell. As a consequence, there are a considerable number of deities who are met with both at the beginning and at the end of the
first period of Babylonian history a period, be it remembered, that, so far as known, already covers a distance of 2,000
years. These are of two classes, (a) deities of purely local
origin, surviving through the historical significance of the places where they were worshipped, and (b) deities, at once local in so far as they are associated with a fixed spot, but at
the same time having a far more general character by virtue of
being personifications of the powers of nature. The jurisdiction of both classes of deities might, through political vicissi
tudes, be extended over a larger district than the one to which
they were originally confined, and in so far their local character would tend to be obscured. It would depend, however, upon
other factors, besides the merely political ones, whether these
cults would take a sufficiently deep hold upon the people to lead to the evolution of deities, entirely dissociated from fixed
seats, who might be worshipped anywhere, and whose attributes would tend to become more and more abstract in charac
ter. Such a process, however, could not be completed by the

silent working of what, for want of a better name, we call
the genius of the people. It requires the assistance, conscious and in a measure pedantic, of the thinkers and spiritual guides
of a people. In other words, the advance in religious conceptions from the point at which we find them when the union of
the Babylonian states takes place, is conditioned upon the
infusion of the theological spirit into the mass of beliefs that constituted the ancient heritage of the people.
On the other hand, various circumstances have already been
suggested that cooperated, already prior to the days of Hammurabi, in weeding out the superfluity of deities, at least so far as recognition of them in the official inscriptions of the rulers were concerned. Deities, attached to places of small
and ever-diminishing importance would, after being at first adopted into the pantheon by some ruler desirous of emphasizing his control over the town in question, end in being entirely absorbed by some more powerful god, whose attributes were
similar to those of his minor companion. Especially would this be the case with deities conceived as granting assistance
in warfare. The glory of the smaller warrior gods would fade through the success achieved by a Nin-girsu. The names and
epithets would be transferred to the more powerful god, and,
beyond an occasional mention, the weaker would entirely pass out of consideration. Again, the worship of the moon or of
the sun, or of certain aspects of the sun, the morning sun, the noonday sun, and the like, at localities of minor impor
tance, would yield to the growing popularity of similar worship in important centers. As a consequence, names that formerly designated distinct deities or different phases of one and the
same deity, would, by being transferred to a single one, come to be mere epithets of this one. The various names would be
used interchangeably, without much regard to their original force. All the essential elements of the Babylonian religion are already to be found in the conditions prevailing during the



SUMMARY. 115
period that we have been considering. Some new deities are met with in the periods that followed, but there is no reason to
believe that any profound changes in the manner of worship, or in the conceptions regarding the gods, were introduced. The relations, however, which the gods bear to one another
are considerably modified, their attributes become more sharply
denned, the duties and privileges pertaining to each are regu
lated. Hand in hand with this systematization, the organization of the cult becomes more perfect, the ritual enters upon further
phases of development, speculations regarding the unknown have their outcome in the establishment of dogmas. Finally the past,
with its traditions and legends, is viewed under the aspect of
later religious thought. The products of popular fancy are
reshaped, given a literary turn that was originally foreign to them, and so combined and imbued with a meaning as to re
flect the thoughts and aspirations of a comparatively advanced
age. What may be called the flowering of the theological epoch in the history of the Babylonian religion, viewed as a unit, is so directly dependent upon the political union of the Babylonian states, brought about by Hammurabi (c. 2300 B.C.), that it may be said to date from this event.



CHAPTER VIII.
THE PANTHEON IN THE DAYS OF HAMMURABI.
MARDUK.
THE immediate result of Hammurabi's master-stroke in bring
ing the various states of the Euphrates Valley under a single
control, was the supremacy secured for his capital, of the city of Babylon over all other Babylonian cities, and with this
supremacy, the superior position henceforth assumed by the patron deity of the capital, Marduk. 1 It is needless for our
purposes to enter upon the question as to the age of the city of Babylon, 2 nor as to its political fortunes prior to the rise of the dynasty of which Hammurabi was the sixth member. That
its beginnings were modest, and that its importance, if not its origin, was of recent date in comparison with such places as
Eridu, Nippur, Lagash, Ur, and the like, is proved by the absence of the god Marduk in any of the inscriptions that we have
been considering up to this point. The first mention of the
god occurs in the inscriptions of Hammurabi, where he appears distinctly as the god of the city of Babylon. No doubt the immediate predecessors of Hammurabi regarded Marduk in
1 The name is also written Ma-ru-duk, which points to its having been regarded (for which there is other evidence) as a compound of maru, '
son,' and an element, duk(u), which in religious and other texts designates the ' glorious chamber ' in which the god determines the fate of humanity. Such an ' etymology '
is, however, merely a play upon the name, similar to the plays upon proper names found in the Old Testament. The real etymology is unknown. The form Marduk is Semitic, and points to an underlying stem, rdk. Marduk appears under a variety of names which will be taken up at their proper place. See Schrader's Assyrisch-Babyl. Keilschriftcn, p. 129 ; and the same author's Cuneiform Inscrip. and the O. T. (p. 422) for other
etymologies. 2 Hommel's view that Gish-galla, in Gudea's inscriptions, is Babylon lacks convincing evidence, but the city may be as old as Gudea's days for all that.



THE PANTHEON IN THE DAYS OF HAMMURABI. \\~
the same light as the great conqueror, so that we are justified in applying the data, furnished by the inscriptions of Hammu
rabi to such of his predecessors, of whom records are still lacking. It is to Marduk, that Hammurabi ascribes his success. The king regards himself as the beloved of Marduk.
The god rejoices his heart and gives him power and plenty. Even when paying his homage at the shrines of other deities, he does not forget to couple the name of Marduk with that of
the deity whose protection he invokes. So at Sippar, sacred to
Shamash, and where the king deposits a cylinder recording the improvements that he instigated in the city, he associates the sun-god with Marduk, whereas in contradistinction to the rulers
of the old Babylonian cities or states, when addressing Marduk, he does not find it necessary to make mention at the same
time of an entire pantheon. Marduk's protection suffices for
all purposes. This, of course, does not exclude the worship of
other gods. A reference has already been made to the king's
care for the city of Shamash. In this respect, he was but
following the example of his predecessors, who, while regarding Babylon as their capital, were zealous in doing honor to ancient
centers of worship. So one of these predecessors, Zabu, restores the temple of Shamash at Sippar, and that of Anunit
at Agade. Hammurabi, besides his work at Sippar, builds
a temple to Ninni at Hallabi. 1 Babylon, however, is the
beloved city of Marduk, and upon its beautification and
improvement Hammurabi expends his chief energy. Such are the endearing terms in which he speaks of his god, as to give
one the impression that, when thinking of Marduk, the king for the moment loses sight of the existence of other gods.
The most striking tribute, however, that is paid to Marduk in the period of Hammurabi is his gradual assumption of the role played by the old En-lil or Bel of Nippur, once the
head of the Babylonian pantheon. This identification is
1 Near Sippar,



118 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
already foreshadowed in the title belie rabu, i.e., 'great lord,' which Hammurabi is fond of bestowing upon Marduk. It is
more clearly indicated in an inscription of his son, Samsu-iluna,
who represents Bel,
' the king of heaven and earth,' as trans
ferring to Marduk, the 'first-born son of Ea,' rulership over ' the four regions,' a phrase that at this time had already
assumed a much wider meaning than its original portent. In
the religious literature of this age, which reflects the same
tendency, Bel expressly transfers his title f lord of the lands ' *
to Marduk, while Ea likewise pays homage to his son, declaring that the latter's ' name ' shall also be Ea. The transference of
the name, according to Babylonian notions, is equivalent to a transference of power. As a consequence, Bel and Marduk are blended into one personage, Marduk becoming known as
Bel-Marduk, and finally, the first part of the compound sinking to the level of a mere adjective, the god is addressed as ' lord
Marduk,' or ' Marduk, the lord.' The old Bel is entirely forgotten, or survives at best in conventional association with Anu and Ea, as a member of the ancient triad.
It has been satisfactorily shown 2 that Marduk was originally
a solar deity. His association with Babylon, therefore, must be viewed in the same light as the association of Sin, the
moon-god, with the city of Ur, and the association of Shamash,
the sun-god, with Larsa and Sippar. Just as in the latter
places, other cults besides that of the patron deity prevailed, so in Babylon it was merely the prominence which, for some
reason, the worship of the sun-god acquired, that led to the closer identification of this particular deity with the city, until
he became viewed as the god par excellence of the city, and the
city itself as his favorite residence. As long as Larsa and
Sippar retained a prominence overshadowing that of Babylon,
1 Bel matdti. 2 Sayce, Religion of the Ancient Babylonians, pp. 98 seq. ; Jensen, Kosmologie der Babylonier, p. 88,



THE PANTHEON IN THE DAYS OF HAMMURABI. 119
the sun cult at the latter place could attract but little attention.
Only as Babylon began to rival, and finally to supersede, other centers of sun-worship, could Marduk be brought into the
front rank of prevailing cults: It may appear strange, in view of this original character of Marduk, that neither in the inscrip
tions of Hammurabi, nor in those of his successors, is there
any direct reference to his qualities as a solar deity. However,
in the ideographs composing his name, which are to be inter
preted as ' child of the day,' J and in the zodiacal system, as
perfected by the Babylonian scholars, there lurk traces of the
god's solar origin. Beyond this, perhaps, in certain set phrases,
surviving in prayers addressed to him. The explanation for this absence of solar traits is to be sought in the peculiar
political conditions that resulted in bringing Marduk into such
prominence. Hammurabi was preeminently a conquering king. He waged war on all sides, and carried on his campaigns for
many years. When he finally succeeded in bringing both
North and South Babylonia under his sway, it still required
constant watching to keep his empire together. His patron god, therefore, the protector of the city, whose jurisdiction was thus spread over a larger extent of territory than that of any
other deity, must have appeared to Hammurabi and his follow
ers, as well as to those vanquished by him, essentially as a warrior. It is he who hands over to kings the land and its
inhabitants. The fact that he was a solar deity would become
obscured by the side of the more potent fact that, as god of the
city of Babylon, his sway was supreme. He therefore became
Marduk, the 'great lord.' The epithets bestowed upon him naturally emphasized the manner in which he manifested him
self, and these epithets, therefore, referred to his power, to his supremacy over other gods, to his favor shown to his worship
1 So Delitzsch, Bcitr'dge znr Assyriolagie, ii. 623. The first part of the name is also used to designate the ' young bullock,' and it is possible, therefore, that the god was pictured in this way, as both Anu and Sin are occasionally called ' bulls.'



120 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
pers by granting them unprecedented glory ; and since the political supremacy remained undisputed for many centuries, no opportunity was afforded for ever reverting to the attributes
of the god as a solar deity. He remained if one may so
express it a political deity. The political significance of Babylon permitted only one phase of his nature to be brought forward.
In the religious texts, however, preserving as they do the more primitive conceptions by the side of the most advanced ones, some traces of other attributes besides prowess in war
are found. By virtue of his character as a solar deity, Marduk,
like the orb personified through him, is essentially a life-giving god. Whereas Shamash is viewed as the 'judge of mankind,' Marduk becomes the god who restores the dead to life, though
he shares this power with Shamash, Gula, Nebo, and Nergal. But after all, even in the religious texts, his more prominent
role is that of a ruler, a magnified king. He protects the weak, releases the imprisoned, and makes great the small. He controls by his powerful hand the mountains and rivers and fountains. He is the counsellor who guides the decrees, even of the great gods, Anu and Bel. On his head rests a crown
with high horns, as the symbol of rulership. As the supreme ruler, life and death are in his hands. Blessings flow from
him ; and of awe-inspiring appearance, his wrath inflicts severe
punishment on the evil-doer.
It is a noteworthy circumstance, and characteristic of the
phase of the Babylonian religion which we are considering, that the extension of Marduk's political sway did not lead to the establishment of Marduk cults outside of Babylon. One reason for this was that, in accordance with the political con
ceptions, dwelt upon in the introductory chapter, the empire of Babylonia was regarded simply as an extension of the city of
Babylon. Babylonia, therefore, being identified in theory with the city of Babylon, there was no need of emphasizing the



THE PANTHEON IN THE DAYS OF HAMMURABI. 121
power of Marduk by establishing his cult elsewhere. Within the
limits of Babylon, however, there might be more than one shrine
to Marduk, and accordingly, when the city was extended so as
to include the place known as Borsippa, a temple to Marduk was
also erected there. The temple on the east side of the Euphrates,
known as E-Sagila, 'the lofty house,' was the older, and dates
probably from the beginnings of Babylon itself ; that in Bor
sippa, known as E-Zida,
' the true house,' seems to have been founded by Hammurabi. 1 While it was not in accord with the dignity attaching to Marduk that his cult should be established
outside of the precincts of the city of Babylon, it would only
add to his glory to have the worship of other deities grouped around his own sanctuary. Such a course would emphasize the
central position of Marduk among the gods, and accordingly, we find that the chief gods of Babylonia are represented by shrines within the sacred precincts of his great temples at
Babylon and Borsippa. First among these shrines is that of
Marduk's consort,
SARPANITUM.
Neither Hammurabi nor his immediate successor make men
tion of Sarpanitum, and at no time does she appear independently of Marduk. The glory of Marduk did not permit of any riv.al, and so his consort becomes merely his shadow, less significant than most of the consorts of the male deities.
Her name, signifying the '
silvery bright one,' evidently stands in some connection with the solar character of her consort.
Popular etymology, by a play upon the name, made of Sarpanitum
(as though Zer-banit) the '
offspring-producing
'
goddess. She had her shrine within the precincts of the great temple E-Sagila, but we are not told of any special honors being paid her, nor do we find her invoked to any extent in incantations or in votive
inscriptions. Agumkakrimi, or Agum (as he is also called),
1 Louvre Inscription II, col. ii. 11. 12-17.



122 BABYLONIAAT-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
who rules about five centuries after Hammurabi, speaks of
having recovered the image of Sarpanitum, and that of Marduk, out of the hands of a mountainous people living to the northwest of Babylonia, in the district between the Bay of Iskenderun
and the Euphrates. The capture of the statues of the patron gods points to a great humiliation which Babylon must have encountered. Upon receiving a favorable omen from the sungod, Agum undertakes the task of bringing Marduk and Sar
panitum back to their seats. Their temples, too, at Babylon appear to have suffered damage during the invasion of the city,
and accordingly the statues are placed in the temple of Shamash
pending the restoration of E-Sagila. Agum dwells at length upon the handsome garments and head-dress, studded with
precious stones, that he prepared for the god and his consort. In all this description, one feels that it is Marduk for whom
the honors are intended, and that Sarpanitum is of less than
secondary importance, shining merely by the reflected glory of her great liege, whose presence in Babylon was essential to
a restoration of Babylon's position. There are reasons for believing, however, that Sarpanitum once enjoyed considerable importance of her own, that prior to
the rise of Marduk to his supreme position, a goddess was
worshipped in Babylon, one of whose special functions it was
to protect the progeny while still in the mother's womb. A late
king of Babylon, the great Nebuchadnezzar, appeals to this attribute of the goddess. To her was also attributed the possession
of knowledge concealed from men. Exactly to what class of
deities she belonged, we are no longer able to say, but it is
certain that at some time, probably about the time of Hammurabi, an amalgamation took place between her and another goddess
known as Erua, 1 a name that etymologically suggests the idea
1 There is also a goddess Eria worshipped in Elam, who may be identical with Erua. The scribes in the days of Nebuchadnezzar (c. 1140 B.C.), at least, appear to have thought so, for they associate her with Bel, just as Sarpanitum is associated with Bel-Marduk. (See the Inscription VR. 57, col. ii. 11. n, 12.)



THE PANTHEON IN THE DAYS OF HAMMURABI. 123
of 'begetting.' 1 She is represented as dwelling in the temple of E-Zida at Borsippa, and was originally the consort of Nabu,
the chief god of this place. 2 A late ruler of Babylon Shamash-shumukin calls her the queen of the gods, and declares himself to have been nominated by her to lord it over men.
A factor in this amalgamation of Erua and Sarpanitum was
the close association brought about in Babylon between Marduk and a god whose seat was originally at the Persian Gulf Ea.
The cult of this god, as we shall see, survived in Babylonia
through all political vicissitudes, and so did that of some other minor water-deities that belong to this region. Among these
was Erua, whose worship centered in one of the islands in or
near the gulf. Wisdom and the life-giving principle were two ideas associated in the Babylonian mind with water. As
inferior in power to Ea, Erua appears to have been regarded as the daughter of Ea, and such was the sway exercised by Ea over men's minds, that even the Babylonian schoolmen did not venture to place Marduk over Ea, but pictured him as Ea's
son. Erua, however, was not prominent enough to become Marduk's mother, and so she was regarded as his consort. In
this capacity she was associated with Sarpanitum, and the two
were merged into one personality. It rarely happens that all the links in such a process are preserved, but in this case, the
epithets borne by.Sarpanitum-Erua, such as 'lady of the deep,' ' mistress of the place where the fish dwell,'
' voice of the deep,'
point the way towards the solution of the problem involved in
the amalgamation of Erua and Sarpanitum.3
1 Whether, however, this was the real meaning of the name is doubtful, for the name of the goddess is also written Aru and Arua, which points to a different verbal stem. 2 See below under Tashmitum. 3 There are indications also of an arrested amalgamation of Erua-Sarpanitum with Tashmitum, the wife of Nabu. (See Sayce, Hibbcrt Lectures, p. 112.)



124 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
NABU.
The gcd Nabu (or Nebo) enjoys a great popularity in the Babylonian cult, but he owes his prestige to the accident that, as god of Borsippa, he was associated with Marduk. Indeed, his case is a clear instance of the manner in which Marduk
overshadows all his fellows. Only as they are brought into some manner of relationship with him do they secure a position
in the pantheon during this second period of Babylonian history. Since Nabu's position in the pantheon, once established,
incurs but little change, it will be proper, in treating of him, to include the testimony furnished by the historical records of
the Assyrian kings. The most prominent attribute of Nabu,
at least in the later phases of the Babylonian religion, is that of wisdom. He is the wise, the all-knowing. He embodies in
his person all the wisdom of the gods. To him the Assyrian
kings are particularly fond of ascribing, not merely the understanding that they possess, but the thought of preserving the wisdom of the past for future ages ; and in doing this the
Assyrians were but guided by examples furnished by the south. Wisdom being associated, in the minds of the Babylonians, with the watery deep, one is tempted to seek an aqueous origin for Nabu. Such a supposition, although it cannot be positively established, has much in its favor. It is not necessary, in order
to maintain this proposition, to remove Nabu from Borsippa.
The alluvial deposits made by the Euphrates yearly have already demonstrated that Babylon lay much nearer at one time to the Persian Gulf than it does at present. The original
seat of Ea, whose worship continued through all times to enjoy
great popularity at Babylon, was at Eridu, which, we know, once lay on the Persian Gulf, but does so no longer. The
similarity of the epithets bestowed in various texts upon Ea
and Nabu point most decidedly to a similar starting-point for both; and since in a syllabary 1 we find the god actually identi
1 Rawlinson, ii. 60, 30.



THE PANTHEON IN THE DA YS OF HAMMURABI. 125
fied with a deity of Dilmun, probably one of the islands near
Bahrein, there are grounds for assuming that a tradition
survived among the schoolmen, which brought Nabu into some connection with the Persian Gulf. Sayce 1 has already sug
gested that Borsippa may have originally stood on an inlet of the Persian Gulf. Nabu is inferior to Ea, and were it not for
the priority of Marduk, he would have become in Babylonian theology, the son of Ea. Since this distinction 2 is given to
Marduk, no direct indication of an original relationship to Ea has survived.
But besides being the god of wisdom and intelligence, Nabu
is a patron of agriculture, who causes the grain to sprout forth. In religious and historical texts, he is lauded as the deity who opens up the subterranean sources in order to irrigate the
fields. He heaps up the grain in the storehouses, and on the other hand, the withdrawal of his favor is followed by famine and distress. Jensen 3 would conclude from this that he was
originally (like Marduk, therefore) a solar deity. This, however, is hardly justified, since it is just as reasonable to deduce
his role as the producer of fertility from his powers as lord of
some body of water. However this may be, in the case of
Nabu, there are no grounds for supposing that he represents
the combination of two originally distinct deities. A later
chiefly theoretical amalgamation of Nabu with a god Nusku will be discussed in a subsequent chapter.4 Hammurabi and his immediate successors, it is noteworthy, do not make mention of
Nabu. A sufficient number of inscriptions of this period exists to make it probable that this omission is not accidental. This
dynasty was chiefly concerned in firmly establishing the position of Marduk. Other deities could, indeed, be tolerated at his side, provided they were subservient to him ; but Nabu, the god of a
place so near Babylon, might prove a dangerous rival because

126 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
of this proximity. The city on the west bank of the Euphrates
was probably as old as that on the east, if not, indeed, older. It did not seem consistent with this devotion to Marduk that Hammurabi and his successors should also recognize Nabu.
Policy dictated that Nabu should be ignored, that the attempt
must be made to replace his worship, even in Borsippa, by that of Marduk. Viewed in this light, Hammurabi's establishment
of the Marduk cult in Borsippa assumes a peculiar significance. It meant that Borsippa was to be incorporated as part of Babylon, and that Marduk was henceforth to take the place occupied
by Nabu. In order to emphasize this, Hammurabi actually transfers the name of Nabu's temple in Borsippa, E-Zida, to the one erected by him at that place to Marduk. Did he perhaps
entirely suppress the worship of Nabu at Borsippa ? It would almost appear so from Agum's utter omission of Nabu. Only the statues of Marduk and Sarpanitum seem to have been robbed by the Hani. Not a word is said as to Nabu. Either there was no statue at the time at Borsippa, or the cult was of
such insignificance that the capture of the god was not consid
ered of sufficient moment to occupy the thoughts of the enemy, as little as it did that of the rulers of Babylon at the time. In
the inscription in which Hammurabi recounts the building of E-Zida in Borsippa, there are certain expressions which go to
substantiate the proposition that Nabu is intentionally ignored. 1 He calls Marduk the lord of E-Sagila and of E-Zida ; he speaks
of Borsippa as the beloved city of Marduk, just as though it were Babylon. Taking unto himself the functions of Nabu,
he even appears to play upon the name, which signifies
*
pro
1 Tiele, Geschichte d. Religion i. AltertJmm, i. 171 and 188, is of the opinion that Nabu is a late deity whose worship dates from a period considerably subsequent to Hammurabi. This conclusion from the non-occurrence of the god in early inscriptions is not justified. There is no reason why Nabu should have been added as a deity in later times, and in general we must be on our guard against assuming new deities subsequent to Hammurabi. It is much more plausible to assume the restored popularity of very old ones.



THE PANTHEON IN THE DAYS OF HAMMURABI, 127
claimer,' and styles himself the nabiu Anu, ' the proclaimer of Anu.' However this may be, the attempt to suppress Nabu
did not succeed, a proof that in early times he had gained popular favor. He had to be readmitted into the Babylonian
pantheon, though in a subordinate position to Marduk. He
took his place in the theological system as the son of Marduk, and on the great festival the New Year's day celebrated
in honor of the great god of Babylon, the son shared some of
the honors accorded to the father. In time, his sanctuary at
Borsippa was again recognized. The former rivalry gave way to a cordial entente. Nabu was even granted a chapel in E-Sagila at Babylon, to which likewise the name of E-Zida was
given. Every New Year's day the son paid a visit to his father, on which occasion the statue of Nabu was carried in
solemn procession from Borsippa across the river, and along the main street of Babylon leading to the temple of Marduk ;
and in return the father deity accompanied his son part way on the trip back to E-Zida. In this way, due homage was accorded to Marduk, and at the same time the close and cordial bonds
of union between Babylon and Borsippa found satisfactory illustration. E-Sagila and E-Zida become, and remain through
out the duration of the Babylonian religion, the central sanctua
ries of the land around which the most precious recollections
cluster, as dear to the Assyrians as to the Babylonians. The kings of the northern empire vie with their southern cousins in
beautifying and enlarging the structures sacred to Marduk and Nabu.
In view of the explanation offered for the silence maintained by Hammurabi and his successors regarding Nabu, we are
justified in including Nabu in the Babylonian pantheon of those days. In later times, among the Assyrians, the Nabu
cult, as already intimated, grows in popularity. The northern monarchs, in fact, seem to give Nabu the preference over Marduk. They do not tire of proclaiming him as the source



128 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
of wisdom. The staff is his symbol, which is interpreted in a
double sense, as the writer's stylus and as the ruler's sceptre.
He becomes, also, the bestower of royal power upon his favorites. Without his aid, order cannot be maintained in the land. Diso
bedience to him is punished by the introduction of foreign rule.
Political policy may have had a share in this preference shown
for the minor god of Babylon. The Assyrian kings were always anxious to do homage to the gods of Babylon, in order to indicate their control over the southern districts. They
were particularly proud of their title '
governor of Bel.' l On the other hand, they were careful not to give offence to the
chief of the Assyrian pantheon, the god Ashur, by paying too much honor to Marduk, who was in a measure Ashur's rival. In consequence, as Hammurabi and his successors
endeavored to ignore Nabu, the Assyrian rulers now turned
the tables by manifesting a preference for Nabu ; and obliged as they were to acknowledge that the intellectual impulses came from the south, they could accept a southern god of wisdom
without encroaching upon the province of Ashur, whose claims to homage lay in the prowess he showed in war. Marduk was
too much like Ashur to find a place at his side. Nabu was a
totally different deity, and in worshipping him who was the son
of Marduk, the Assyrian kings felt that they were paying due
regard to the feelings of their Babylonian subjects. The cult of Nabu thus became widely extended in Assyria. Statues of the god were erected and deposited in shrines built for the
purpose, although the fact was not lost sight of that the real
dwelling-place of the god was in Borsippa. At the end of the ninth century B.C. this cult seems to have reached its height.
We learn of a temple at Calah, and of no less than eight
statues of the god being erected in the days of Ramman-nirari III., and the terms in which the god is addressed might lead one to believe that an attempt was made to concentrate the
1 Bel being Marduk, the title was equivalent to that of '
governor of Babylonia.'



THE PANTHEON IN THE DA YS OF HAMMURABI. 129
cult in Assyria on him. 1 This, however, was an impossibility. As long as Assyria continued to play the role of the subduer
of nations, Ashur the god of war par excellence neces
sarily retained his position at the head of the Assyrian pantheon. The popularity of Nabu, which continued to the end
of the Assyrian empire, and gained a fresh impetus in the days of Ashurbanabal, who, as a patron of literature, invokes Nabu on thousands of the tablets of his library as 'the opener of
ears to understanding,' reacted on his position in the Babylonian cult. In the new Babylonian empire, which continued
to so large a degree the traditions of Assyria, it is no accident
that three of the kings Nabupolassar, Nebuchadnezzar, and Nabonnedos bear names containing the deity as one of the elements. While paying superior devotion to Marduk, who once more became the real and not merely the nominal head of the pantheon, they must have held Nabu in no small esteem ;
and indeed the last-named king was suspected of trying actu
ally to divert the homage of the people away from Marduk to
other gods, though he did not, as a matter of course, go so far
as to endeavor to usurp for the son, the position held by the
father. It is probably due to Assyrian influence that even in
Babylonia, from the eighth century on, Nabu is occasionally mentioned before Marduk. So Marduk-baladan II. (721-710)
calls himself the " worshipper of Nabu and Marduk," and
similarly others. In official letters likewise, and in astronomical
reports, Nabu is given precedence to Marduk, but this may be due to Nabu's functions, as the god of writing and the patron of science.
The Neo-Babylonian kings are not sparing in the epithets they bestow on Nabu, though they emphasize more his qualities as holder of the '
sceptre
' than as lord of the *
stylus.' So Nebuchadnezzar declares that it is he 'who gives the sceptre of
sovereignty to kings to rule over all lands.' In this capacity
1 So, Tiele, GcschicJite d. Religion i. Alterthum, i. 191.



130 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
he is ' the upholder of the world,'
' the general overseer,' and his temple is called ' the house of the sceptre of the world.'
His name signifies simply the *
proclaimer,' or herald, but we are left in doubt as to what he proclaims, whether wisdom
or sovereignty. Sometimes he appears as the 'herald' of the
gods. In this role he receives the name of Papsukal (i.e.,
supreme or sacred messenger), and it may be that this function
was a very old one. But, again, as god of fertility he could also be appropriately termed the '
proclaimer.' The question must, accordingly, be left open as to the precise force of the attribute contained in his name. Finally, an interesting feature
connected with Nabu, that may be mentioned here, is that in the name borne by a famous mountain in Moab, Nebo, where Moses himself a '
proclaimer ' A died, there survives a testi
mony that the worship of this popular deity extended beyond the Euphrates and the Tigris, to Semites living considerably to the west. To Nabu, as to Marduk, a consort was given. Her name was
TASHMITUM.
The name Tashmitum appears for the first time in the days of Hammurabi. Attention has already been called to the king's
ignoring of the god of Borsippa. While his attempt to suppress the cult of Nabu was not successful, he did succeed in causing the old consort of Nabu to disappear. This consort appears to have been no other than Erua. It will be recalled that up
to very late times the tradition survived that her dwelling-place
was Borsippa. 2 This is never said of Sarpanitum. Despite, therefore, the amalgamation of Sarpanitum and Erua, the association of the latter with Nabu's dwelling-place remains
1 The Hebrew word for prophet, nal>i, is of the same stem as the Assyrian Nabu, and the popular tradition in placing the last scene in the life of Moses on Mt. Nebo is apparently influenced by the fact that Moses was a nabi.
2 See above, p. 123.



THE PANTHEON IN THE DAYS OF HAMMURABI. 131
impressed upon the memory of the Babylonian scholars, at least. Nabu's consort having thus been transferred to Marduk, a new mate had to be found for the former, when once his
rivalry was no longer to be dreaded, and his cult again rose to
prominence.
' Tashmitum ' is an abstract noun in Assyrian,
signifying
' revelation.' As such, it is bestowed in historical texts
upon Nabu himself, who is called ilu tashmeti, 'god of revela
tion.' Nabu is, above all, a *
revealing
'
god, revealing knowledge, the art of writing, and the method of ruling. The
appellation is therefore a most appropriate one, and there seems little reason to question that Tashmitum was originally nothing but one of the terms by which Nabu was designated,
just as he was called Papsukal in his role as '
messenger' of the gods, the messenger of his father Marduk and of his grand
father Ea, in particular. But Tashmitum, being feminine in gender, as an abstract noun, seemed appropriate as the designation of a goddess. It would appear, then, that *
Revelation,' from being so constantly associated with Nabu, was personified, dissociated from him, as it were, through the conception of a distinct goddess bearing the name of ' Tashmitum.' This
process of thought, in giving rise to a new goddess, may have been, in part, a popular one. The translation of a metaphor mto reality is a phenomenon that may be observed in almost all
religions of antiquity. But the process, whatever its course in detail may have been, was not uninfluenced by the theological
dogma whereby a god was supposed to have a ' reflection ' who
was pictured as his consort. Through this conception, as we have already seen, many a goddess once ruling in her own right, and enjoying an independent existence, degenerated into a mere shadow of some male deity, though, on the other hand, it must be borne in mind that these female deities would have
disappeared altogether but for the opportunity thus afforded them of becoming ' attachees ' to some male deity. This theory
of the 7^m-artificial character and origin of Tashmit finds



132 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
support in the manner in which the mention of her name is
entwined with that of Nabu. Sarpanitum, bound up as the
goddess is with Marduk, has at least a shrine of her own, and
occasionally she is spoken of in the texts without her husband
Marduk. 1 The mention of Tashmitum, however, invariably follows that of Nabu. It is always
* Nabu and Tashmitum,' and it is never Tashmitum without Nabu. While the creation of Tash
mitum may be a product of Babylonian religious thought, it is in Assyrian texts that her name is chiefly found. The great
Ashurbanabal, in the conventional subscript attached to his
tablet, is particularly fond of coupling Tashmitum with Nabu, as the two deities who opened his ears to understanding and
prompted him to gather in his palace the literary treasures produced by the culture that flourished in the south. Tashinit
has no shrine or temple, so far as known, either in Borsippa or
in any of the places whither the Nabu cult spread. She has
no attributes other than those that belong to Nabu, and, what
is very remarkable, the later Babylonian kings, such as Nebuchadnezzar II., when they deem it proper to attach a consort to
Nabu call her Nana, 2
i.e., simply the lady, and not Tashmitum, a proof, how little hold the name had taken upon the Babylonian
populace. If to this it be added, that in by far the greater number of instances, no reference whatsoever to a consort is made when Nabu is spoken of, an additional reason is found
for the unreal, the shadowy character of this goddess.
EA.
In treating of the position occupied by Ea in the oldest
period of Babylonian history (see above, pp. 61-64), it has already been mentioned that he grows to much larger proportions under the influence of a more fully developed theological
system. Indeed, there is no god who shows such profound
1 So in the cylinder of Shamash-shum-ukin (Lehmann's publication, pis. viii. sey.). 2 E.g., in the so-called Grotefend Cylinder, col. ii. 34.



THE PANTHEON IN THE DAYS OF HAMMURABI. U3
traces of having been submitted to a theological treatment, and indirectly, therefore, furnishes so distinct a proof of the existence of theological schools in the ancient centers of Baby
lonian culture, as Ea. The question may with propriety be here discussed, to what period we are to attribute the comple
tion of the process, which, to summarize his position, made Ea
the special god of humanity, the father of Marduk, the third in a great triad, of which the other two members were Anu, the
god of heaven, and Bel, the god of earth. Already, in the days preceding the union of the Babylonian states under one
head, we have . had occasion to see traces of an attempt to
systematize the relations existing between the gods. A high degree of culture, such as the existence of a perfected form of writing, an advanced form of architecture, and commercial
enterprise reflect, cannot be dissociated from a high degree of
activity in the domain of philosophic or religious thought.
Accordingly, we are in no danger of attributing too great an
antiquity to the beginnings of theological speculation in Babylonia. Be it remembered that from the earliest to the latest
days, the priests were the scribes and that in their capacity as
writers of the texts, they would be enjoying the advantages of an intellectual impulse. But they were also the composers of
the texts, as well as the writers, and the prominence given to the gods in texts of whatever description, would inevitably lead
their thoughts to speculations regarding the attributes of the gods. The attempt would at an early period be made to find
some unifying principles in the tangled mass of gods. By the time that Hammurabi appears on the scene, we have every reason to believe that some of the ancient libraries of the
south, whither Ashurbanabal sent his scribes, were already well
stocked, and that a goodly portion of the Babylonian literature known to us already existed. What these portions were, we will have occasion to point out when we come to discuss the litera
ture of Babylonia. On the other hand, this literature would



134 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
not only necessarily increase as long as any degree of intellectual activity existed in the country, but this activity would also
manifest itself in transforming this literature, so as to adapt it
to the thoughts and aspirations of a later age. Especially would this be the case in the purely religious divisions of
literature. The ancient traditions, legends, and myths, once
committed to writing, would serve as a point of departure for further speculations. The existence of a text to which any
measure of value is attached, is bound to give rise to various
attempts at interpretation, and if this value be connected with
the religion of a people, the result is, invariably, that the ancient words are invested with a meaning conformable to a later age.
Each generation among a people characterized by intellectual
activity has a signature of its own, and it will seek to give to
the religious thoughts of the time its own particular impress. Since, however, the material upon which any age works is not
of its own making, but is furnished by a preceding one, it follows that much of the intellectual activity of an age manifests
itself in a transformation of its literary or speculative heritage.
This process was constantly going on in Babylonia, and had we more material and older material at our disposal, we would be able to trace more clearly than we can at present, the
various stages that led to the system of theology, as embodied in the best productions of the ancient Babylonian schoolmen.
The days of Hammurabi, as they were politically of great importance, also appear to have ushered in a new era in the
religious life of the people. Stirring political events are always apt to bring in their wake intellectual movements, and in a
country like Babylonia, where politics react so forcibly on religious conditions, the permanent establishment of the supremacy of the city of Babylon would be fraught with important consequences for the cult. The main change brought about by this
new epoch of Babylonian history was, as we have seen, the superior position henceforth accorded in the pantheon to Mar



THE PANTHEON IN THE DAYS OF HAMMURABI. 135
duk as the patron deity of Babylon ; but this change entailed so many others, that it almost merits being termed a revolution.
In order to ensure Marduk's place, the relations of the other
deities to him had to be regulated, the legends and traditions
of the past reshaped, so as to be brought into consistent accord
with the new order of things, and the cult likewise to be, at
least in part, remodelled, so as to emphasize the supremacy of Marduk. This ,work, which was an inevitable one, was pri
marily of an intellectual order. We are justified, then, in
looking for traces of this activity in the remains that have
been recovered of ancient Babylonian literature. We know from direct evidence that the commercial life of Babylonia had
already, in the period preceding Hammurabi, led to regulated legal forms and practices for the purpose of carrying out obligations and of settling commercial and legal difficulties. The proof has been furnished by Dr. Meissner 1 that sylla
baries prepared for the better understanding of the formulas
and words employed in preparing the legal and commercial
tablets, date, in part, from the period which we may roughly designate as that of Hammurabi, covering, say, the three centuries 2300 to 2000 B.C. With this evidence for the exist
ence of pedagogues devoted to the training of novices in the art
of reading and writing, in order to fit them for their future tasks
as official scribes, we are safe in assuming that these same
schoolmen were no less active in other fields of literature. If,
in addition to this, we find that much of the religious literature, in the shape that we have it, reflects the religious conditions
such as they must have shaped themselves in consequence of
the promotion of Marduk to the head of the pantheon, the conclusion is forced upon us that such literary productions date from this same epoch of Hammurabi. This influence of
the schoolmen while centering, as repeatedly pointed out, around the position of Marduk, manifests itself in a pro
1 II "icncr Zeitschrift fiir die Kunde d. Morgenlandes, iv. 301-307.



136 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
nounced fashion, also, in the changed position henceforth accorded to the god Ea. It will be recalled that in the earliest
period of Babylonian history, Ea does not figure prominently. At the same time we must beware of laying too much stress
upon the negative testimony of the historical texts. Besides the still limited material of this character at our disposal, the
non-mention of a deity may be due to a variety of circum
stances, that may properly be designated as accidental. The
gods to whom the kings of the ancient Babylonian states would
be apt to appeal would be, in the first instance, the local
deities, patrons of the city that happened to be the capital of the state ; in the second instance, the gods of the vanquished
towns; and thirdly, some of the great deities worshipped at the sacred centers of the Euphrates valley, and who consti
tuted, as it were, the common heritage of the past. Ea, as the god of the Persian gulf, the region which forms the starting
point of Babylonian culture, and around which some of the oldest and most precious recollections center, would come
within the radius of the third instance, since, in the period we
have in mind, Eridu no longer enjoyed any political importance.
We may be sure, then, despite the silence of the texts, that Ea was always held in great esteem, and that even the absence of
temples in his honor, did not affect the reverence and awe that
he inspired. As for the epoch of Hammurabi, the historical spirit that is never absent in a truly intellectual age would be
certain to restore Ea to his proper prestige, assuming that a
previous age had permitted him to fall into neglect. Next to Marduk, there is no deity who is given such distinction in
Babylonia, after the union of the Babylonian states, as Ea. In
the religious literature, moreover, as reshaped by the schoolmen of the time, his role is even more prominent than that of
Marduk. As a water-god, and more particularly as the god to whom the largest body of water known to the Babylonians was sacred, Ea was regarded as the source and giver of wisdom.



THE PANTHEON IN THE DA YS OF HAMMURABI. 137
Fountains everywhere were sacred to him ; and so he becomes
also the giver of fertility and plenty. Berosus tells us of a
mystic being, half man, half fish, who spent his nights in the waters of the gulf, but who would come out of the waters
during the day to give instruction to the people, until that time
steeped in ignorance and barbarism. This ' Cannes,' as Berosus is said l to have called him, was none other than Ea. As
the great benefactor of mankind, it is natural that Ea should have come to be viewed as the god whose special function it is
to protect the human race, to advance it in all its good under
takings, to protect it against the evil designs of gods or demons. In this role, he appears in the religious literature in the
epics, the cosmogony, and the ritual of Babylonia. There is no god conceived in so universal a manner as Ea. All local
connection with Eridu disappears. He belongs to no particular district. His worship is not limited to any particular spot.
All of Babylonia lays claim to him. The ethical import of
such a conception is manifestly great, and traces of it are to be found in the religious productions. It impressed upon the Babylonians the common bond uniting all mankind. The cult
of Ea must have engendered humane feelings, softening the rivalry existing among the ancient centers of Babylonian power, and leading the people a considerable distance, on the road to
the conception of a common humanity. When the gods decide to destroy mankind, it is Ea who intercedes on behalf of humanity ; when the demon of disease has entered a human body, it
is to Ea that, in the last resort, the appeal is made to free the
sufferer from his pain. Ea is the god of the physicians. Nay,
more, it is Ea who presided at the birth of humanity, so that
1 We only know the name through Eusebius' extract from Alexander Polyhistor's digest of Berosus. The form, therefore, cannot be vouched for. The various modern attempts to explain the name have failed (see e.g., Lenormant's Magie und Wahrsagekunst dcr Chaldacr, 2d German edition, pp. 376-379). There may be some ultimate connection between Cannes and Jonah (see Trumbull in Journal of Bibl. Liter, xi. 58, note).



138 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
his protection reaches far back, beyond even the beginnings of
civilization, almost to the beginning of things. Lastly, as the god of civilization, it is to him that the great works of art are
ascribed. He is the god of the smithy, the patron of the gold
and silversmiths, of workers in lapis-lazuli, and all kinds of
precious stones. He is the god of sculpture. The great bulls and lions that guarded the approaches to the temple and palace chambers, as well as the statues of the gods and kings, were
the work of his hands. Furthermore, he is the patron of
weavers, as of other arts. This conception may have been
perfected in a general way, and in all probability was perfected before the days of Hammurabi, though perhaps not prominently brought forward; but important modifications were introduced into it, through the compromise that had to be arranged between the position of Ea and that of Marduk.
Of course, neither the rulers nor the priests of Babylon could
have permitted the reverence for Ea to have gone to the
length of throwing Marduk into the shade. Many of the
functions assigned to Ea seemed to belong of right to Marduk, who, as the patron of Babylon, presided over the destinies of what to the Babylonians was the essential part of mankind,
namely, themselves. Moreover, Babylon being the seat of culture as well as of power, in the period following upon Hammurabi, Marduk was necessarily conceived as possessing the same wisdom that distinguishes Ea. As a consequence, the attributes of Ea were transferred in a body to Marduk.
An amalgamation of the two, however, such as took place in the case of other deities, was neither possible, nor, indeed, desirable. It was not possible, because of the antiquity of the
Ea cult and the peculiar position that he, as a common heir
loom of all Babylonia, occupied ; nor was it desirable, for to do so would be to cut off completely the bond uniting Babylon to its own past and to the rest of Babylonia. The solution of the problem was found in making Ea, the father of Marduk



THE PANTHEON IN THE DAYS OF HAMMURABI. 139
the loving and proud father who willingly transfers all his
powers and qualities to his son, who rejoices in the triumph of his offspring, and who suffers no pangs of jealousy when
beholding the superior honors shown to Marduk, both by the gods and by men.
EA AND MARDUK.
The combination of the two gods is particularly frequent in the so-called incantation texts. Marduk becomes the mediator between Ea and mankind. The man smitten with disease, or
otherwise in trouble, appeals to Marduk for help, who promptly
brings the petition to his father Ea. The latter, after modestly declaring that there is nothing that he knows which his son
Marduk does not know, gives Marduk the necessary instruc
tions, which in turn are conveyed to the one crying for divine
succor. It is clear that these texts have been reshaped with
the intention of adding to the glory of Marduk. They must, therefore, have been remodelled at a time when the Marduk
cult was in the ascendancy. This was after the days of
Hammurabi, and before the subjugation of Babylonia to
Assyrian rule. The limits thus assigned are, to be sure, broad, but from what has above been said as to the intellectual
activity reigning in the days of Hammurabi, we need not descend far below the death of the great conqueror to find the
starting-point for the remodelling of the texts in question. Not all of them, of course, were so reshaped. There are quite a number in which Ea is alone and directly appealed to, and these form a welcome confirmation of the supposition that those in which Ea is joined to Marduk have been reshaped with a desire to make them conform to the position of Marduk
in the Babylonian pantheon. Again, there are incantations in which the name of Marduk appears without Ea. Such are
either productions of a later period, of the time when Marduk
had already assumed his superior position, or what is also



140 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
possible, though less probable, old compositions in which the name of Ea has been simply replaced by that of Marduk. An
especially interesting example of the manner in which ancient productions have been worked over by the Babylonian theolo
gians, with a view to bringing their favorite Marduk into
greater prominence, appears in one of the episodes of the
Babylonian cosmogony. Prior to the creation of man a great monster known as Tiamat had to be subdued. The gods all
shrink in terror before her. Only one succeeds in conquering
her. In the form of the story, as we have it, this hero is
Marduk, but it is quite evident 1 that the honor originally
belonged to an entirely different god, one who is much older, and who stands much higher than the god of Babylon. This was Bel, the old god of Nippur who was conceived as the
god of earth par excellence, and to whom therefore the task of
preparing the earth for the habitation of mankind properly
belonged. How do the Babylonian theologians, who stand under the influence of the political conditions prevailing in
Babylonia after the union of the Babylonian states, reconcile
this older and true form of the episode with the form in which
they have recast it ? The gods who are called the progenitors
of Marduk are represented as rejoicing upon seeing Marduk equipped for the fray. In chorus they greet and bless him,
" Marduk be king." They present him with additional weap
ons, and encourage him for the contest. Upon hearing of his success the gods vie with one another in conferring honors
upon Marduk. They bestow all manner of glorious epithets upon him ; and, to cap the climax, the old Bel, known as ' father
Bel,' steps forward and transfers to him his name, Ml matati?
' lord of lands.' To bestow the name was equivalent to transferring Bel's powers to Marduk ; and so Marduk is henceforth
1 For fuller proof, see the chapter on " The Cosmology of the Babylonians." 2 This, it will be remembered (see above, p. 118), is one of the titles of Marduk in one of Hammurabi's inscriptions, an important point for the date of the episode in its present form.



THE PANTHEON IN THE DA YS OF HAMMURABI. 141
known as Bel. But Ea must be introduced into the episode. It
is not sufficient that Bel, the original subduer of Tiamat, should
pay homage to Marduk ; Ea also greets his son, and bestows
his name upon him, 1 that is, transfers his powers to his son. There is a special reason for this. The overthrow of Tiamat is followed by the creation of man. This function properly
belongs to Bel, both as the god of earth and as the subduer of
Tiamat. According to one and probably the oldest version
of this part of the Babylonian cosmogony which was embodied in the work of Berosus, 2 it is Bel who creates mankind. The substitution of Marduk for Bel necessitated the transference of
the role of creator to Marduk likewise, and yet the latter could not take this upon himself without the consent of his father
Ea, who had become the god of humanity par excellence. Ea
could interpose no objection against Bel being replaced by Marduk in vanquishing the monster, but when it came to drawing the conclusion and replacing Bel by Marduk -also in the creation of man, the case was different. If Bel was to be
replaced, Ea had a prior claim. Marduk could only take
the new functions upon himself after receiving the powers of
Ea. That is the force of Ea's saying that Marduk's name also shall be Ea just as his. This transference of the name of Ea
to Marduk is in itself an indication that there must have
existed a second version in Babylonia probably of later
origin than the other of the creation of man, according
to which Ea, and not Bel, was the creator. We shall
have occasion to see, in a future chapter, that there were
at least two different versions current in Babylonia of the
creation of the gods and of the universe. The open
ing chapters in Genesis form an interesting parallel to show the manner in which two different versions of one and the same subject may be combined. There is, therefore,
1 Literally,
' Ea shall be his name, his as mine.' 2 According to Syncellus. In cuneiform texts the old Bel is at times invoked as the creator of mankind.



142 BAB YLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
nothing improbable in the supposition that a later version, reflecting a period when Bel had sunk into comparative insignificance, made Ea the creator of mankind instead of Bel, and
that still later a solution of the apparent inconsistency involved
in transferring only part of Bel's powers to Marduk was found by securing Ea's consent to the acknowledgment of Marduk not merely as creator of mankind but of the heavenly vault as well. Jensen l has brought other evidence to show that Ea was once regarded as the creator of mankind. One of his titles
is that of 'potter,' and mankind, according to Babylonian theories, was formed of '
clay.' Moreover, in a Babylonian myth that will be set forth in its proper place, Ea expressly
figures in the role of creating a mysterious being, Uddushu-namir, whose name signifies
' his light shines.' Such a proper
name, too, as " Ea-bani," i.e.,
' Ea creates,' points in the same direction.
In other literary productions of Babylonia, such as, e.g., the so-called Izdubar epic, Ea again appears without Marduk,
showing that this story has not been remodeled, or that the
later version, in which the traces of a recasting may have been
seen, has not been discovered. In the deluge story, which forms part of the Izdubar epic, Ea alone is the hero. It is he
who saves humanity from complete annihilation, and who pacifies the angered Bel. Marduk's name does not appear in the
entire epic. We have found it necessary to dwell thus at
length upon these evidences of the recasting of the literary products of ancient Babylonia under the influence of changed
conceptions of the gods and of their relations to one another,
for upon the understanding of these changes, our appreciation of the development of religious beliefs in Babylonia, and all connected with these beliefs, hinges. The epoch of Hammu
rabi was a crucial one for Babylonia from a religious as well
as from a political point of view.
1 Kosmologic, pp. 293, 294.



THE PANTHEON IN THE DA YS OF HAMMURABI. 143
DAMKINA.
The consort of Ea figures occasionally in the historical texts
of Hammurabi's successors. Agumkakrimi invokes Ea and
Damkina, asking these gods, who 'dwell in the great ocean'
surrounding the earth, to grant him long life. In addition to
this, the antiquity of the literary productions in which her name appears justifies us in reckoning her among the gods of Babylonia of Hammurabi's time. Her name signifies
*
lady of the earth,' and there is evidently a theoretical substratum
to this association of Ea, the water-god, with an earth-goddess.
The one forms the complement to the other ; and Marduk, as
the son of water and earth, takes his place in the theory as the
creator of the world. In this form the ' natural philosophy
' of
Babylonia survived to a late period. Nicolas of Damascus
still knows (probably through Berosus) that Ea and Damkina 1
had a son Bel (i.e., Marduk). The survival of the name is a
proof that, despite the silence of the historical texts, she was
a prominent personage in Babylonian mythology, even though she did not figure largely in the cult. She appears in the
magical texts quite frequently #t the side of Ea. In a hymn 2 where a description occurs of the boat containing Ea, Damkina
his wife, and Marduk their son, together with the ferryman and some other personages sailing across the ocean, we may see traces of the process of symbolization to which the old
figures of mythology were subjected.
SHAMASH.
Passing on, we find Hammurabi as strongly attached to the
worship of the old sun-god as any of his predecessors. Next to Babylon, he was much concerned with making improvements in Sippar. The Temple of Shamash at Larsa also was
1 Aos and Dauke. 2 Rawlinson, iv. 25.



144 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
improved and enlarged by him. Hammurabi's example is followed by his successors. Agumkakrimi invokes Shamash as
'warrior of heaven and earth'; and it is likely that the precedent furnished by these two kings, who considered it consistent with devotion to Marduk to single out the places sacred to
Shamash for special consideration, had much to do in main
taining the popularity of sun-worship in Babylonia and Assyria. Kara-indash, of the Cassite dynasty (c. 1450 B.C.), restores the
temple of Shamash at Larsa, and Mili-shikhu, two centuries later, assigns to Shamash the second place in his pantheon, naming him before Marduk. Foreign rulers were naturally not so deeply attached to Marduk as were the natives of Babylon. In the
Assyrian pantheon Shamash occupies the third place, following immediately upon the two special deities of Assyria. One of the greatest of the northern kings erects a temple in honor of the
god, and the later Babylonian kings vie with one another in
doing honor to the two oldest sanctuaries of Shamash, at
Sippar and Larsa. Perhaps the pristine affinity between Marduk, who, as we saw, was originally a sun-deity, and Shamash, also had a share in Hammurabi's fondness for coupling these
two gods. When describing his. operations at Sippar he speaks of himself as '
doing good to the flesh of Shamash and Marduk.'
-Hammurabi felt himself to be honoring Marduk, through paying
homage to a deity having affinity with the patron protector of
Babylon. NINNI, OR INNANNA.
We have already come across a deity of this name in a
previous chapter. 1 Hammurabi tells us, in one of his inscriptions, that he has restored the temple in honor of Innanna at
Hallabi a town near Sippar. 2 Innanna, or Ninni, signifying
1 See p. 79. 2 See Jensen, Keils Bibl. 3, i, p. 108, note 5. Tiele, Gesch. p. 126, apparently identifies Innanna of Hallabi with Tashmit. but, so far as I can see, without sufficient



THE PANTHEON IN THE DA YS OF HAMMURABI. 145
merely 'lady,' or 'great lady,' appears to have become a very general name for a goddess, hence the addition ' of Hallabi,' which Hammurabi is careful to make. At the same time the
designation
'
lady of Hallabi '
points to her being a consort of
a male deity who was the patron of the place. May this have been the moon-god again, as in the case of the other Innanna ?
Our knowledge of this goddess is confined to what the king tells us about her. For him she is the mistress whose glory fills heaven and earth, but when he adds that she has placed in
his hands the reins of government, this only means that the
goddess recognizes his right to supreme authority over the Babylonian states not that he owes his power to her. It is
after he has succeeded in making Babylon the capital of a great
kingdom that he proceeds to improve the temple of Innanna.
BEL AND THE TRIAD OF BABYLONIAN THEOLOGY.
Among the literary remains of Hammurabi's days we have a
hymn in which the chief gods worshipped by the king are enumerated in succession. The list begins with Bel, and then
mentions Sin, Ninib, Ishtar, Shamash, and Ramman. We should expect to find at the head of the list Marduk. The
hymn may be older than Hammurabi, who, perhaps, is quoting or copying it; and since the Bel who is here at the head of the
pantheon is the god of Nippur, the hymn may originally have belonged to the ritual of that place. For Hammurabi the
highest
'
Bel,' or lord, is Marduk, and there is hardly room for doubt that in using this hymn as a means of passing on to sing
ing his own praises, with which the inscription in question ends, Hammurabi has in mind the patron god of Babylon when
speaking of Bel?1 It is this amalgamation of the old Bel with
Marduk that marks, as we have seen, the transition to the use
of Bel's name as a mere title of Marduk. Elsewhere, however,
1 Here written En-lil, as the Bel of Nippur.



146 J>'A B YL ONIAN-ASS YR1AN RELIGION.
Hammurabi uses Bel to designate the old god. So when he calls himself the proclaimer of Anu and Bel l the association with Anu makes it impossible that Marduk should be meant.
At times he appears to refer in the same inscription, now to
the old Bel and again to Bel-Marduk, under the same designa
tion. When Kurigalzu, a member of the Cassite dynasty
(V. 1400 B.C.), speaks of 'Bel, the lord of lands,' to whom he
erects a temple in the new city, Dur-Kurigalzu some forty miles to the northeast of Babylon it is the old Bel who is again
meant. While acknowledging Marduk as one of the chief gods,
these foreign rulers in Babylonia the Cassites did not feel the same attachment to him as Hammurabi did. They gave the
preference to the old god of Nippur, and, indeed, succeeded in their attempt to give to the old city of Nippur some of its pristine glory. They devoted themselves assiduously to the care of the great temple at Nippur. There are some indications of an
attempt made by them to make Nippur the capital of their empire. In the case of Hammurabi's immediate successor, as
has been pointed out, the equation Bel-Marduk is distinctly set down, but, for all that, the double employment of the name con
tinues even through the period of the Assyrian supremacy over Babylonia. The northern rulers now use Bel to designate the
more ancient god, and, again, merely as a designation of Mar
duk. Tiglathpileser I. (see note 2, below) expressly adds 'the older ' when speaking of Bel. When Sargon refers to Bel,
* the
lord of lands, who dwells on the sacred mountain of the gods,'
or when Tiglathpileser I. calls Bel 'the father of the gods,'
' the king of the group of spirits
' known as the Anunaki, it is

graphically En-Lil, is the designation da-gan-ni, which has occasioned considerable discussion. See Jensen, Kosmologie, pp. 449-456. It seems to me that the addition which emphasizes this identity of Bel with another god, Dagan, is to indicate that the Bel of the triad, and not Bel-Marduk, is here meant. Somewhat in the same way
Tiglathpileser I. (Rawlinson, i. 14, viii. 87) distinguishes the older Bel by calling him 1 Bel labara,' i.e.,
' Bel the older.'



THE PANTHEON IN THE DA YS OF HAMMURABI. 147
of course only the old Bel, the lord of the lower region, or of the
earth, who can be meant ; but when, as is much more frequently
the case, the kings of Assyria, down to the fall of the empire, associate Bel with Nabu, speak of Bel and the gods of Akkad
(i.e., Babylonia), and use Bel, moreover, to designate Babylonia, 1 it is equally clear that Marduk is meant. In the Neo
Babylonian empire Marduk alone is used. The continued existence of a god Bel in the Babylonian
pantheon, despite the amalgamation of Bel with Marduk, is a phenomenon that calls for some comment. The explanation
is to be found in the influence of the theological system that
must have been developed in part, at least, even before the
union of the Babylonian states. 2 Bel, as the god of earth, was associated with Anu, as the god of heaven, and Ea, as the god
of the deep, to form a triad that embraced the entire universe.
When, therefore, Anu, Bel, and Ea were invoked, it was equivalent to naming all the powers that influenced the fate of man.
They embraced, as it were, the three kingdoms of the gods, within which all the other gods could be comprised. The sys
tematization involved in the assumption of a triad of gods
controlling the entire pantheon can hardly be supposed to have been a popular process. It betokens an amount of thought
and speculation, a comprehensive view of the powers of nature, that could only have arisen in minds superior to the average
intelligence. In other words, the conception of the triad Anu, Bel, and Ea is again an evidence of the existence of school
men and of schools of religious thought in the days of the
ancient empire. So far, however, as Hammurabi is concerned, he only refers to a duality Anu and Bel which, for him, com
prises all the other gods. He is the 'proclaimer of Anu and Bel.' It is Anu and Bel who give him sovereignty over the land. In

the texts of the second period the triad does not occur until we
come to the reign of a king, Mili-shikhu, who lives at least eight centuries after Hammurabi. Ea, in fact, does not occur at all
in those inscriptions of the king that have as yet been discov
ered. If any conclusion is to be drawn from this omission, it
is certainly this, that there are several stages in the develop
ment of the ancient theological system of Babylonia. At first a duality of kingdoms the kingdom of what is above and be
low was conceived as comprising all the personified powers of nature, but this duality was replaced by a triad through the addition of the god who stands at the head of all water
deities. Of -course the assumption of a duality instead of a
triad may have been due to a difference among existing schools
of thought. At all events, there seems to be no political rea
son for the addition of Ea, and it is difficult to say, therefore,
how soon the conception of a triad standing at the head of the
pantheon arose. We have found it in Gudea's days, and it
must, therefore, have existed in the days of Hammurabi, with
out, perhaps, being regarded as an essential dogma as yet. A direct and natural consequence of Bel's position in the triad
was that, by the side of Bel-Marduk, the older Bel continued to
be invoked in historical inscriptions. Since Anu and Ea
were appealed to by themselves, the former occasionally, the latter more frequently, there was no reason why a ruler should not at times be prompted to introduce an invocation to Bel, without the direct association with Anu and Ea. The confusion that thus ensues between the two Bels was not of serious moment, since from the context one could without difficulty determine which of the two was meant; and what we, with our
limited knowledge of ancient Babylonia, are able to do, must have been an easy task for the Babylonians themselves. 1
1 Occasionally a king (so e.g. Nabubaliddin, c. 883 B.C.) associates Anu with Ea, and omits Bel (Rawlinson, v. 60, ii. 21), as though with the intent of avoiding confusion.



THE PANTHEON IN THE DA YS OF HAMMURABI. 149
It is tempting to suppose that the first command of the
Decalogue (Exodus, xx) contains an implied reference to the
Babylonian triad.
ANU, BEL, AND EA.
The theory of the triad succeeds in maintaining its hold
upon Babylonian minds from a certain period on, through all political and intellectual vicissitudes. To invoke Anu,
Bel, and Ea becomes a standing formula that the rulers
of Babylonia as well as of Assyria are fond of employing. These three are the great gods par excellence. They occupy a
place of their own. The kings do not feel as close to them
as to Marduk, or to Ashur, or even to the sun-god, or to the
moon-god. The invocation of the triad partakes more of a
formal character, as though in giving to these three gods the first place, the writers felt that they were following an ancient
precedent that had more of a theoretical than a practical value
for their days. So among Assyrian rulers, Ashur-rish-ishi (c. 1150 B.C.) derives his right to the throne from the authority
with which he is invested by the triad. Again, in the formal
curses which the kings called down upon the destroyers of
the inscriptions or statues that they set up, the appeal to Anu, Bel, and Ea is made. Ashurnasirbal calls upon the triad not
to listen to the prayers of such as deface his monuments.
Sargon has an interesting statement in one of his inscriptions, according to which the names of the months were fixed by Anu, Bel, and Ea. This '
archaeological
'
theory illustrates very well the extraneous position occupied by the
triad. The months, as we shall see, are sacred, each to a different god. The gods thus distinguished are the ones that are directly concerned in the fortunes of the state, Sin,
Ashur, Ishtar, and the like. Anu, Bel, and Ea are not in the
list, and the tradition, or rather the dogma according to which
they assign the names is evidently an attempt to make good



150 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
this omission by placing them, as it were, beyond the reach of
the calendar. In short, so far as the historical texts are con
cerned which reflect the popular beliefs, the triad represents a theological doctrine rather than a living force. In combina
tion, Anu, Bel, and Ea did not mean as much, nor the
same thing, to a Babylonian or an Assyrian, as when he said Marduk, or Nabu, or Ashur, or Sin, as the case might be. It
was different when addressing these gods individually, as was occasionally done. The Assyrians were rather fond of intro
ducing Anu by himself in their prayers, and the Babylonians were prompted to a frequent mention of Ea by virtue of his relationship to Marduk, but when this was done Anu and Ea meant something different than when mentioned in one breath
along with Bel.
BELIT.
One might have supposed that when Bel became Marduk, the consort of Bel would also become Marduk's consort.
Such, however, does not appear to be the case, at least so far as the epoch of Hammurabi is concerned. When he calls
himself * the beloved shepherd of Belit,' it is the wife of the
old Bel that is meant, and so when Agumkakrimi mentions
Bel and Belit together, as the gods that decree his fate on
earth, there is no doubt as to what Belit is meant. In later
days, however, and in Assyria more particularly, there seems to be a tendency towards generalizing the name (much as that of Bel) to the extent of applying it in the sense of ' mistress '
to the consort of the chief god of the pantheon ; and that
happening to be Ashur in Assyria accounts for the fact, which
might otherwise appear strange, that Tiglathpileser I. (c. 1140 B.C.) calls Belit the '
lofty consort and beloved of Ashur.' Ashurbanabal (668-626 B.C.) does the same, and even goes further and declares himself to be the offspring of Ashur and Belit. On the other hand, in the interval between these two



THE PANTHEON IN THE DA YS OF HAMMURABI. 151
kings we find Shalmaneser II. (860-825 B - c) calling Belit 'the
mother of the great gods ' and ' the wife of Bel,' making it evident that the old Belit of the south is meant, and since Ashurbanabal on one occasion also calls the goddess 'the beloved of
Bel,'
1 it follows that in his days two Belits were still recognized,
or perhaps it would be more accurate to say two uses of the
term, one specifically for the consort of the Babylonian Bel, the god of the earth, with his ancient seat at Nippur; the Qther
of a more general character, though still limited as '
lady
' to
the consort of the chief gods, just as *
Bel,' while acquiring the general sense of '
lord,' was restricted in actual usage to the
greatest
' lords '
only. An indication of this distinction, some
what parallel to the addition of Dagan to Bel, to indicate that the
old Bel was meant, 2 appears in the sobriquet
' of Babylonia,' 3 which Ashurbanabal gives to the goddess in one place where the old Belit is meant. Under the influence of this Assyrian,
extension of the term, Nabopolassar, in the Neo-Babylonian period, applies the title to the consort of Shamash at Sippar, but he is careful to specify
* Belit of Sippar,' in order to avoid
misunderstanding. Besides being applied to the consorts of Ashur and of Shamash, 'Belit,' in the general sense of 'mis
tress,' is applied only to another goddess, the great Ishtar of the
Assyrian pantheon generally, however, as a title, not as a name of the goddess. The important position she occupied in the Assyrian pantheon seemed to justify this further modification and extension in the use of the term. Occasionally, Ishtar is
directly and expressly called ' Belit.' So, Ashurbanabal speaks
of a temple that he has founded in Calah to ' Belit mati,' 4 ' the
Belit (or lady) of the land,' where the context speaks in favor
of identifying Belit with the great goddess Ishtar. Again

Ashurbanabal, in a dedicatory inscription giving an account of improvements made in the temple of Ishtar, addresses the goddess as Belit *
lady of lands, dwelling in E-mash-mash.' 1
ANU AND ANATUM.
In the second period of Babylonian history the worship of the supreme god of heaven becomes even more closely bound
up with Anu's position as the first member of the inseparable triad than was the case in the first period. For Hammurabi,
as has been noted, Anu is only a half-real figure who in association with Bel is represented as giving his endorsement
to the king's authority. 2 The manner in which Agumkakrimi introduces Anu is no less characteristic for the age
of Hammurabi and his successors. At the beginning of .his long inscription, 3 he enumerates the chief gods under whose
protection he places himself. As a Cassitic ruler, he assigns the first place to the chief Cassite deity, Shukamuna, a god of
war whom the Babylonian scholars identified with their own
Nergal. 4 Shukamuna is followed by the triad Anu, Bel, and
Ea. Marduk occupies a fifth place, after which comes a second triad, Sin, Shamash "the mighty hero," and Ishtar 5
" the strong one among the gods." The inscription is devoted to the king's successful capture of the statues of Marduk and
Sarpanitum out of the hands of the Khani, and the restoration
1 The name of the temple. See IIR. 66, 11. i and 10. The title ' belit matati,' ' lady of the lands ' is evidently introduced in imitation of ' bel matati/ ' lord of lands,' belonging to Bel and then to Marduk. 2 Sayce's view (Hibbert Lectures, p. 186), according to which Anu was originally the local god of Erech, is erroneous.
3 VR. pi. 33. 4 Delitzsch, Die Kossaer, pp. 25, 27. 5 The omission of Ramman here, though invoked at the close of the inscription, is noticeable. Ishtar takes the place that in the more developed system belongs to the god of storms, who with the moon-god and sun-god constitutes a second triad.
See p. 163.



THE PANTHEON IN THE DA YS OF HAMMURABI. 153
of the shrines of these deities at Babylon. At the close, the
king Agumkakrimi appeals to Anu and his consort Anatum, 1 who are asked to bless the king in heaven, to Bel and Belit
who are asked to fix his fate on earth, and to Ea and Dam
kina, inhabiting the deep, 2 who are to grant him long life. As
in the beginning of the inscription, the thought of the triad
Anu, Bel, Ea evidently underlies this interesting invocation, but at the same time the association of a consort with Anu
brings the god into closer relationship with his fellows. He
takes on if the contradiction in terms be permitted a
more human shape. His consort bears a name that is simply the feminine form to Anu, just as Belit is the feminine to Bel.
'Anu,' signifying 'the one on high,' a feminine to it was formed, manifestly under the influence of the notion that every god must have a consort of some kind. After Agumkakrimi no further mention of Anatum occurs, neither in the inscriptions
of Babylonian nor of Assyrian rulers. We are permitted to conclude, therefore, that Anatum was a product of the schools, and one that never took a strong hold on the popular mind.
Among the Assyrian kings who in other respects also show less dependence upon the doctrines evolved in the Babylonian
schools, and whose inscriptions reflect to a greater degree the
purely popular phases of the faith, we find Anu mentioned with tolerable frequency, and in a manner that betrays less
emphasis upon the position of the god as a member of the triad. Still, it is rather curious that he does not appear even
in the inscriptions of the Assyrian kings by himself, but in association with another god. Thus Tiglathpileser I. (c. 1130 B.C.) gives an elaborate account of an old temple to Anu and
1 Written with the sign An, and the feminine ending turn, but probably pronounced Anatum. The form Anat (without the ending) is used by many scholars, as Sarpanit and Tashmit are used instead of Sarpanitum and Tashmitum. I prefer the fuller forms of these names. Anum similarly is better than Anu, but the latter has become so common that it might as well be retained.

154 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
Ramman in the city of Ashur that he restores to more than its former grandeur. 1 This dedication of a temple to two
deities is unusual. Ramman is the god of thunder and storms, whose seat of course is in the heavens. He stands close,
therefore, to Anu, the supreme god of heaven. In the religious
productions, this relationship is expressed by making Ramman the son of Anu. From a passage descriptive of this temple it would appear that the old temple founded by King SamsiRamman, who lived several centuries before Tiglathpileser,
was dedicated to Ramman. It looks, therefore, as though the association of Anu with Ramman was the work of the later king. What his motive was in thus combining Anu with
Ramman it is difficult to say, but in his account of the res
toration of the sanctuary, he so consistently mentions Anu and
Ramman together, 2 designating them unitedly as 'the great gods my lords,' that one gains the impression that the two were
inseparable in his mind, Ramman being perhaps regarded simply as a manifestation of Anu. The supposition finds some
support in the closing words of the inscription, where, in hurling the usual curses upon those who should attempt to destroy his monuments, he invokes Ramman alone, whom he asks to
punish the offender by his darts, by hunger, by distress of every kind, and by death.
Elsewhere Anu appears in association with Dagan, of whom
we shall have occasion to speak in the chapter on the Assyrian
pantheon. Suffice it to say here that Dagan in this connection
is an equivalent of Bel. When, therefore, Ashurbanabal and Sargon call themselves 'the favorite of Anu and Dagan,' it is
the same as though they spoke of Anu and Bel. Apart from
this, Anu only appears when a part or the whole of the Assyrian pantheon is enumerated. Thus we come across Anu, Ramman, and Ishtar as the chief gods of the city of Ashur," and again
1 IR. pi. 14, col. vii. 71, viii. 88. 2 NO less than nine times.
3 Tiglathpileser I.



THE PANTHEON IN THE DAYS OF HAMMURABI. 155
Anu, Ashur, Shamash, Ramman, and Ishtar. 1
Finally, Sargon who names the eight gates of his palace after the chief gods of the land does not omit Anu, whom he describes as the 'one who blesses his handiwork.' Otherwise we have Anu only when the triad Anu, Bel, and Ea is invoked. Once Ramman-nirari I.
(c. 1325 B.C.) adds Ishtar to the triad. After Sargon we no
longer find Anu's name at all among the deities worshipped in
Assyria. On the whole, then, Anu's claim to reverence rests
in Assyria as well as in Babylonia upon his position in the triad, and while Assyria is less influenced by the ancient system
devised in Babylonia whereby Anu, Bel, and Ea come to be the
representatives of the three kingdoms among which the gods
are distributed, still Anu as a specific deity, ruling in his own right, remains a rather shadowy figure. The only temple in his honor is the one which he shares with Ramman, and which,
as noted, appears to have been originally devoted to the ser
vice of the latter. One other factor that must be taken into
account to explain the disappearance of Anu is the gradual enforcement of Ashur's claim to the absolute headship of the
Assyrian pantheon. Either Anu or Ashur had to be assigned to this place, and when circumstances decided the issue in
favor of Ashur, there was no place worthy of Anu as a specific deity. Ashur usurps in a measure the role of Anu. So far as
Babylonia was concerned, there was still in the twelfth century
B.C. a city
* Der ' which is called the '
city of Ann.' The city
is probably of very ancient foundation, and its continued asso
ciation with Anu forms an interesting survival of a local con
ception that appears to have been once current of the god.
In the religious literature, especially in that part of it which furnishes us with the scholastic recastings of the popular tradi
tions, Anu is a much more prominent figure than in the his
torical texts. From being merely the personification of the heavens, he is raised to the still higher dignity of symbolizing,
1 Ramman-nirari I.



156 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
as Jensen puts it,
1 the abstract principle of which both the
heavens and earth are emanations. All the earliest gods con
ceived of by popular tradition as existing from the beginning of things are viewed as manifestations of Anu, or of Ann and
Anatum in combination. He gives ear to prayers, but he is not
approached directly. The gods are his messengers, who come and give him report of what is going on. 2 He is a god for the
gods rather than for men. When his daughter Ishtar is insulted
she appeals to her father Anu ; and when the gods are terrified
they take refuge with Anu. Armed with a mighty weapon whose assault nothing can withstand, Anu is surrounded by a
host of gods and powerful spirits who are ready to follow his lead and to do his service.
RAMMAN.
With Ramman we reach a deity whose introduction into the
Babylonian pantheon and whose position therein appears to be entirely independent of Marduk. The reading of the name as Ramman (or Rammanu) is pro
visional. The ideograph Im with which the name is written
designates the god as the power presiding over storms ; and while it is certain that, in Assyria at least, the god was known as Ramman, which means ' the thunderer,' it is possible that this was an epithet given to the god, and not his real or his
oldest name. It is significant that in the El-Amarna tablets
(c. 1500 B.C.), where the god Im appears as an element in
proper names, the reading Addu is vouched for, and this form has been justly brought into connection with a very famous
solar deity of Syria, Hadad. The worship of Hadad, we know, was widely spread in Palestine and Syria, and there is conclusive evidence that Hadad (or Adad), as a name for the god Im,
was known in Babylonia. Professor Oppert is of the opinion
1 Kosmologie. p. 274. 2 See the list IIIR. 68, 26 seq.



THE PANTHEON IN THE DA YS OF HAMMURABI. 157
that Adad represents the oldest name of the god. Quite recently the proposition has been made that the real name of the deity was Immerti. 1 The ideograph in this case would arise
through the curtailment of the name (as is frequently the case
in the cuneiform syllabary), and the association of Im with
* storm ' and ' wind ' would be directly dependent upon the nature of the deity in question. The material at hand is not
sufficient for deciding the question. Besides Irnmeru, Adad, and Ramman, the deity was also known as Mer connected apparently with Immeru.2 So much is certain, that Ramman appears to have been the name currently used in Assyria for
this god. Adad may have been employed occasionally in Baby
lonia, as was Mer in proper names, but that it was not the
common designation is proved by a list of gods (published by Bezold 9
) in which \\\e foreign equivalent for Im is set down as
Adad. We may for the present, therefore, retain Ramman, while bearing in mind that we have only proof of its being an
epithet applied to the god, not necessarily his real name and in all probabilities not the oldest name. We meet with the god for the first time in the hymn to which reference has already been made, 4 and where the god is mentioned together with Shamash. If the suggestion above thrown
out is correct, that the hymn is older than the days of Ham
murabi, Ramman too would be older than his first mention in
historical texts. However, it is worthy of note that in this
hymn each of the other gods mentioned receives a line for himself, and that Ramman is the only one who is tacked on to
another deity. It is not strange that in making copies of older
1 Thureau-Dangin, Journal Asiatique, 1895, PP- 3^5-393- The name of this deity has been the subject of much discussion.

158 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
texts, especially those of a religious character, the scribes should have introduced certain modifications. At all events, the god
does not acquire any degree of prominence until the days of
Hammurabi ; so that whatever his age and origin, he belongs in
a peculiar sense to the pantheon of Hammurabi rather than to that of the old Babylonian period. The successor of Ham
murabi, Samsu-iluna, dedicates a fort, known as Dur-padda, to
Ramman whom he addresses as his '
helper,' along with several other gods. Despite this fact, his worship does not appear to
have been very firmly established in Babylonia, for Agumkakrimi, who follows upon Samsu-iluna, does not make mention of Ramman. During the reign of the Cassite dynasty, how
ever, the worship of Ramman appears to have gained a stronger foothold. Several kings of this dynasty have incorporated the
name of this deity into their own names, and in an .inscription
dealing with events that transpired in the reign of one of these
kings, Ramman occupies a prominent place. Immediately after the great triad, Anu, Bel, and Ea, there is enumerated a second, Sin, Shamash, and Ramman, and only then there follows Marduk. 1 More than this, Ramman is introduced for a sec
ond time in conjunction with Shamash, as in the hymn of Ham
murabi. The two are appealed to as ' the divine lords of
justice.' The conqueror of the Cassites, Nebuchadnezzar I., also holds Ramman in high esteem. For him, Ramman is
the god of battle who in companionship with Ishtar abets the
king in his great undertakings. He addresses Ramman as the great lord of heaven, the lord of subterranean waters and of rain, whose curse is invoked against the one who sets aside the decrees of Nebuchadnezzar or who defaces the monument
the king sets up. While acknowledging the supremacy of Marduk, upon whose appeal he proceeds to Babylonia to rid the country of its oppressors, Nebuchadnezzar nevertheless
1 Belser in Haupt and Delitzsch, Beitragc zur Assyriologie, ii. 187 scq., col. vi. 1.



THE PANTHEON IN THE DAYS OF HAMMURABI. 159
shows remarkable partiality for Rammarr, perhaps as a matter
of policy to offset the supposed preference shown by Ramman
towards the previous dynasty. Ramman with Nergal and Nana are also enumerated as the special gods of Namar a Babylonian district which caused the king considerable annoyance, and which may have been one of the strongholds whence the Cassitic kings continued their attacks upon Nebuchadnezzar. In order to determine more precisely the nature of this deity,
it is necessary to turn to Assyria, where his worship dates from
the very earliest times, and where he appears consistently in a
single role, that of the god of storms, more particularly of thunder and lightning. The oldest Assyrian ruler known to us
is Samsi-Ramman (c. 1850 B.C.), whose name, containing the
god as one of its elements, points to the antiquity of the cult of
Ramman in the north. Another king who has frequently been mentioned, Ramman-nirari (z>., Ramman is my helper), bears
evidence to the same effect, and Tiglathpileser I. speaks of a temple to Ramman whose foundation carries us back several
centuries beyond the period of these two kings almost to
the days of Hammurabi. The theory has accordingly been
advanced that the worship of Ramman came to Babylonia from the north, and since the cult of this same god is found in
Damascus and extended as far south as the plain of Jezreel, the further conclusion has been drawn that the god is of
Aramaic origin and was brought to Assyria through Aramaic tribes who had settled in parts of Assyria. The great an
tiquity of the Ramman cult in Assyria argues against a foreign origin. It seems more plausible to regard the Ramman cult as
indigenous to Assyria ; but reverting to a time when the population of the north was still in the nomadic state of civilization, the cult may have been carried to the west by some of the wandering tribes who afterwards established themselves around Damascus. Up to a late period Aramaic hordes appear from
time to time in western Assyria ; and in a higher stage of cul



160 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
ture, contact between Aramaeans and Assyrians was maintained by commercial intercourse and by warfare. Since the earliest
mention of Ramman's cult is in the city of Ashur, it may be that he was originally connected with that place. As already
intimated, he was essentially a storm-god, whose manifestation was seen in the thunder and lightning, and the god was known
not merely as ' the thunderer,' but also as Barku, i.e., lightning. Perhaps it was because of this that he was also brought into
association with the great light of heaven, the sun-god. In
many mythologies, the sun and lightning are regarded as correlated forces. At all events, the frequent association of Shamash and Ramman cannot have been accidental. This
cfouble nature of Ramman as a solar deity representing some
particular phase of the sun that escapes us and as a storm-god
still peers through the inscription above noted from the Cas
site period where Ramman is called 'the lord of justice,' an
attribute peculiar to the sun-god ; but in Assyria his role as
the thunder- and storm-god overshadows any other attributes that he may have had. There are two aspects to rainstorms in Babylonia. The
flooding of the fields while committing much havoc is essential
to the fertility of the soil. Ramman is therefore the carrier
of blessings to the cities, the one who supplies wells and fields with water ; but the destructive character of the rain and
thunder and lightning are much more strongly emphasized than their beneficent aspects. Even though the fields be flooded, Ramman can cause thorns to grow instead of herbs.
The same ideograph Im that signifies Ramman also means distress. When the failure of the crops brings in its wake
hunger and desolation, it is the 'god of the clouds,' the 'god of rain,' the ' god of the overflow,' whose wrath has thus mani
fested itself. It is he who (as a hymn puts it)
' has eaten
the land.' No wonder that the 'roar' of the god is described
as '
powerful,' and that he is asked to stand at the right side



THE PANTHEON IN THE DA YS OF HAMMURABI. 161
of the petitioner and grant protection. When Ramman lets his voice resound, misfortune is at hand. It was natural
that he who thus presided over the battle of the elements
should come to be conceived essentially as a god of war to a
people whose chief occupation grew to be conquest. As such
he appears constantly in the inscriptions of Assyrian kings, and to such a degree as to be a formidable rival, at times, to
the head of the Assyrian pantheon. The final victory of the
Assyrian arms is generally attributed to Ashur alone, but just before the battle and in the midst of the fray, Ramman's presence is felt almost as forcibly as that of Ashur. He shares
with the latter the honor of invocations and sacrifices at such
critical moments. In this capacity Ramman is so essentially an
Assyrian god that it will be proper to dwell upon him again in
the following chapter, when the specially Assyrian phases of the religion we are investigating will be taken up. The consort
of Ramman also, the goddess Shala, will best be treated of in
connection with the Assyrian phases of the Ramman cult.
Of the other gods whose names occur in the inscriptions of
Hammurabi, but little of a special character is to be noted.
The attributes that he gives tfcem do not differ from those that
we come across in the texts of his predecessors. It is sufficient,
therefore, to enumerate them. The longest list is furnished by
the hymn which has already been referred to. The text is unfor
tunately fragmentary, and so we cannot be sure that the names
embrace the entire pantheon worshipped by him. The list
opens with Bel (who, as we have seen, is the old Bel of Nippur) ;
then follow Sin, Ninib, Ishtar, Shamash, Ramman. Here the break in the tablet begins and, when the text again becomes
intelligible, a deity is praised in such extravagant terms that one is tempted to conclude that Hammurabi has added to an
old hymn a paean to his favorite Marduk. 1 To Bel is given
1 The character of this part of the hymn is quite different from that which precedes.



162 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION,
the honor of having granted royal dignity to the king. Sin has given the king his princely glory ; from Ninib, the king has received a powerful weapon ; Ishtar fixes the battle array, while
Shamash and Ramman hold themselves at the service of the
king. With this list, however, we are far from having exhausted
the pantheon as it had developed in the days of Hammurabi. From the inscriptions of his successors we are permitted to add
the following : Nin-khar-sag, Nergal, and Lugal-mit-tu, furnished by Samsu-iluna ; Shukamuna, by Agumkakrimi ; and passing down to the period of the Cassite dynasty, we have in addition
Nm-dim-su, Ba-kad, Pap-u, Belit-ekalli, Shumalia. 1 During the Cassitic rule, Marduk does not play the prominent part that he did under the native rulers, but he is
restored to his position by Nebuchadnezzar I., who, it will be
recalled, succeeds in driving the Cassites out of power. But besides Marduk, Nebuchadnezzar invokes a large number of
other deities. For purposes of comparison with the pantheon of Hammurabi, and of his immediate successors, I give the complete list and in the order mentioned by him in the only
inscription that we have of this king. They are Ninib, Gula, Ramman, Shumalia, Nergal, Shir, Shubu, Sin, Belit of Akkad. Moreover, Anu is referred to as the especial god of Der, and a
goddess Eria 2 is worshipped in Elam. Passing still further
down, we obtain as additional names, Malik and Bunene, from
the inscription of Nabubaliddin (c. 883-852 B.C.).
3
We may divide this long period from Hammurabi down to
the time that the governors of Babylonia became mere puppets of the Assyrian rulers into three sections: (i) Hammurabi and
his successors, (2) the Cassite dynasty, (3) the restoration of
native rulers to the throne. A comparison of the names fur
nished by the inscriptions from these three sections shows that
1 For further notices of these gods, see chapter x. 2 See above, p. 122.
3 One might include in the list also Nin-igi-nangar-bu, Gushgin-banda, Nin-kurra, Nin-zadim (from Nabubaliddin's inscription), but these are only so many epithets of Ea or various forms under which the god came to be worshipped. See p. 177.



THE PANTHEON IN THE DA YS OF HAMMURABI. 163
the gods common to all are Marduk, Bel, Shamash, Ramman.
But, in addition, our investigations have shown that we are justi
fied in adding the following as forming part of the Babylonian pantheon during this entire period : Sarpanitum, Belit, Tash
mitum, Sin, Ninib, Ishtar, Nergal, Nin-khar-sag, and the two other members of the triad, Anu and Ea, with their consorts, Anatum and Damkina. All these gods and goddesses are found
in the texts from the first and third section of the period, and the absence of some of them from texts of the second section is simply due to the smaller amount of material that we have
for the history of the Cassite dynasty in Babylonia. Some of
the deities in this list, which is far from being exhaustive, 1 axe
foreign, so e.g., Shukamuna and Shumalia, who belong to the Cassitic pantheon ; others are of purely local significance, as Shir and Shubu. 2 As for Sin, Ninib, and Ishtar, the worship of none of these deities assumes any great degree of promi
nence during this period. No doubt the local cult was continued at the old centers much as before, but except for an"
occasional invocation, especially in the closing paragraphs of an inscription, where the writers were fond of grouping a large
array of deities so as to render more impressive the curses upon
enemies and vilifiers, with which the inscriptions usually ter
minated, they do not figure in the official writings of the time.
Of Sin, it is of some importance to note that under the Cassite
dynasty he stands already at the head of a second class of
triads which consists of Sin, Shamash, and Ramman, or Ishtar
(see note 3 on page 152), and that through the inscription of Nebuchadnezzar I., we learn of an additional district of
Babylonia, that of Bit-Khabban, where in association with Belit of Akkad, the consort of the older Bel, he was worshipped as the patron deity. Nebuchadnezzar himself does not enu

164 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
merate Sin among the chief gods. Ninib appears in the familiar role as a god of war. After Hammurabi he is only
mentioned once in inscriptions of the Cassitic period and then
again in the days of Nebuchadnezzar I., who assigns a prom
inent place to him. It is Ninib who, with the title 'king of
heaven and earth,' leads off in the long list of gods whose
curses are invoked upon the king's opponents. Similarly, the belligerent character of Ishtar is the only phase of the goddess
dwelt upon during this period. While for Agumkakrimi, she still occupies a comparatively inferior rank, coming seventh in his list, Nebuchadnezzar places her immediately after Anu
and before Ramman and Marduk. This advance foreshadows
the superior role that she is destined to play in the pantheon
during the period of Assyrian supremacy. The cult of Nergal does not figure prominently during this period. In fact, so far as the historical texts go, he disappears from the scene
till the time of Nebuchadnezzar I., when he is incidentally "invoked in a group with Ramman and Nana as the gods of a
district in Babylonia known as Namar. Exactly where Namar lay has not yet been ascertained. Since Nergal, as was shown
in the previous chapter, was the local patron of Cuthah, it may be that the latter city was included in the Namar district. At
all events, we may conclude from the silence of the texts as to
Nergal, that Cutha played no conspicuous part in the empire formed of the Babylonian states, and that the cult of Nergal, apart from the association of the deity in religious texts with the
lower world, did not during this entire period extend beyond
local proportions. Lastly, it is interesting to note that Samsuiluna, the son of Hammurabi, refers to Belit of Nippur as Ninkhar-sag, which we have seen was one of her oldest titles.



CHAPTER IX.
THE GODS IN THE TEMPLE LISTS AND IN THE LEGAL AND COMMERCIAL DOCUMENTS.
BESIDES the historical texts in the proper sense, there is an
other source for the study of the Babylonian pantheon. Both for the first and for the second periods we now have a
large number of lists of offerings made to the temples of Babylonia and of thousands of miscellaneous legal documents. De Sarzec found a number of such documents at Telloh some
years ago, and quite recently some thirty thousand tablets of the temple archives have come to light.
1 At Tell-Sifr, Abu
Habba, and elsewhere, many thousands also have been found,
belonging chiefly to the second period. A feature of these documents is the invocation of the gods, introduced for various
purposes, at times in connection with oaths, at times as a
guarantee against the renewal of claims. Again, certain gods are appealed to as witnesses to an act, and in the lists of
temple offerings, gods are constantly introduced. Since many of the commercial transactions recorded in these documents,
moreover, concern the temples of Babylonia, further occasions were found for the mention of a god or gods. The proper
names occurring in these documents, compounded as these names in most cases are with some deity,
2 furnish some
1 The Berlin Museum and Columbia College have secured a large proportion of these through purchase. The remainder are still in the market. 2 The longer names consist of three elements : subject, verb, and object. The
deity is generally the subject ; e.g., Sinacherib = Sin-akhe-irba, i.e., may the god Sin increase the brothers. But there are many variations. So the imperative of the verb is often used, and in that case, the deity is in the vocative case. Instead of three
elements, there are frequently only two, a deity and a participle or an adjective ; e.g.,



166 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
additions to the pantheon of Babylonia. Naturally, a distinction is to be made between deities introduced in temple
lists and in the course of legal proceedings, and such as are
merely known through forming an element in proper names. The former constitute a part of what might be called the
' active ' pantheon of the time. Deities that are actually invoked
by contracting parties for whatever purpose are such as are endowed with real significance ; and if any of these are not mentioned in the historical texts proper, the omission is due to
the lack of material. The testimony of the legal documents in
this respect is fully as valid as is that of the historical texts.
In proper names the case is different. Custom being a promi
nent, if not a controlling, factor in the giving of names, it may happen that the deity appearing as an element in a name is one
who, for various reasons, is no longer worshipped, or whose worship has diminished in significance at the time we meet with the name. Again, deities of very restricted local fame,
deities that occupy the inferior rank of mere spirits or demons
in the theological system of the Babylonians, may still be incorporated in proper names. Lastly, in view of the descriptive epithets by which some deities are often known, as much as by
their real names, it frequently happens in the case of proper names that a deity otherwise known is designated by one of his attributes. Thus we find in legal documents of the second
period a goddess, Da-mu-gal, who is none other than the well
known Gula, the great healing deity; Ud-zal, who is identical with Ninib, and so written as the god of 'the rising sun' ;* and
Mar-tu (lit., 'the west god'), which is a designation of Ramman. 2
Sin-magir, i.e., Sin is favorable, or a person is called ' the son ' or ' the servant ' of a god. The name of the deity alone may also constitute a proper name ; and many names of course do not contain the mention of a deity at all, though such names are often abbreviations from longer ones in which some god was introduced.
1 Jensen, fCosmologie, p. 458. 2 Arnold, Ancient Babylonian Temple Records, p. 5, is of the opinion that Id-nikmar-tu is also a designation of Ramman. His view is plausible, but it still remains to
be proved.



THE GODS IN TI1K TKMPLE LISTS. .167
Bearing in mind all these considerations, we find in the
tablets of the first period, so far as published, 1 the same
deities that are met with in the historical inscriptions : En-lil,
Bau, En-zu (or Sin), Nin-girsu, Nin-gish-zida, Nin-mar, Nana, Nina, Shul-pa-uddu, and others. No doubt a complete publication of the Telloh archives will furnish some not many new
deities not occurring in the historical texts of this period. A
rather curious feature, illustrated by these temple archives, and one upon which we shall have occasion to dwell, is the divine
honors that appear to have been paid towards the end of the first
period of Babylonian history to some of the earlier rulers, notably Gudea and Dungi. 2 Alongside of wine, oil, wheat, sheep, etc.,
offered to Bau, Nin-gish-zida, and Shul-pa-uddu, the great kings and/<7/mV of the past are honored. More than this, sanctuaries
sacred to these rulers are erected, and in other respects they are
placed on a footing of equality with the great gods of the period. Passing on to the lists and the legal documents of the second
period, 8 we may note that the gods in whose name the oath is
taken are chiefly Marduk, Shamash,4 A, Ramman, and Sin. Generally two or three are mentioned, and often the name of the
reigning king is added to lend further solemnity to the oath.
Other gods directly introduced are Nana, Ishtar, Nebo, Tashmitum, and Sarpanitum, after whom the years are at times
designated, probably in consequence of some special honors accorded to the gods. The standing phrase is
' the year of the
throne,' or simply 'the year' of such and such a deity. Nin-mar

appears in the days of Hammurabi as the daughter of Marduk.
Among gods appearing for the first time are Khusha, 1 Nun-gal, and Zamama. Mentioned in connection with the gates of the
temple where the judges held court, the association of Khusha
with Marduk, Shamash, Sin, and Nin-mar points to a consider
able degree of prominence enjoyed by this deity. Of his nature and origin, however, we know nothing. Nun-gal signifies the 'great chief.' His temple stood in Sippar, 2 and from this we may conclude that he was one of the minor gods of the place
whose original significance becomes obscured by the side of
the all-powerful patron of Sippar the sun-god. A syllabary describes the god as a '
raging
'
deity, a description that suggests solar functions. Nun-gal appears, therefore, to be the
ideograph proper to a deity that symbolized, like Nergal, Ninib, and A, some phase of the sun. The disappearance of the god would thus be naturally accounted for, in view of the tend
ency that we have found characteristic of the religion, whereby powerful gods absorb the functions of weaker ones whose
attributes resemble their own. But while the god disappears,
the name survives. Nun-gal with the plural sign attached
becomes a collective designation for a group of powerful demons. 3 In this survival and use of the name we have an
interesting example of the manner in which, by a species of differentiation, local gods, unable to maintain themselves by the
side of more powerful rivals, sink to the lower grade of demons, either beneficent or noxious. In this grade, too, distinctions
are made, as will be pointed out at the proper place. There is a
'
pantheon ' of demons as well as of gods in the Babylonian
theology. Nun-gal accordingly recovers some of his lost dignity by becoming an exceptionally powerful demon so power
ful as to confer his name upon an entire class. The god Zamama appears in connection with a date attached to a legal document
1 Meissner, no. 42. Also in a proper name, Khusha-ilu, /'.<?.,

THE GODS IN THE TEMPLE LISTS. 169
of the days of Hammurabi. The building of a sanctuary in
honor of this deity and his consort was of sufficient importance
to make the year known by this event. Zamama is occasionally
mentioned in the religious hymns. He belongs to the deities that form a kind of court around Marduk. From syllabaries,
we learn that he was a form of the sun-god, worshipped in the
city of Kish in northern Babylonia, and it also appears that he
was identified at one period with Ninib. The temple to Zamama
perhaps only a shrine stood in the city of Kish, which was remodeled by Hammurabi. The shrine, or temple, bore the significant name 'house of the warrior's glory.' The warrior is
of course the god, and the name accordingly shows clearly the character of the god in whose honor the sanctuary was built.
Elsewhere, he is explicitly called a 'god of battle.' Associa
ted with' Zamama of Kish was his consort, who, however, is
merely termed again in a general way, 'Ninni,' *>., 'the lady.' In the case of such a deity as Zamama, it is evident that the
absence of the name in historical texts is accidental, and that
we may expect to come across it with the increase of historical
material. In the proper names, all of the prominent deities
discussed in this and the previous chapters are found, though with some notable exceptions. Anu, e.g., is not met with as an
element in proper names, but among those occurring may be
mentioned Shamash, A, Ishtar, Ramman (also under the forms Im-me-ru and Mar-tu), Marduk, sometimes called Sag-ila after
his temple in Babylon, Nabu, Ishum, Shala, Bau, Nin-ib, Ningir-su, Sin, Bunene, Annuit, and Ea. Among gods appearing for the first time in connection with the names, it is sufficient
to record a goddess Shubula, who from other sources l we know
was the local patron of the city Shumdula, a goddess Bashtum, 2
a goddess Mamu (a form of Gula), Am-na-na, Lugal-ki-mu-na,
1 II R. 60, i8a Pinches (Journal Victoria Institute, xxviii. 36, reads Shu-gid-la;
Hommel, ib. 36, Shu-sil-la). 2 For this deity, see a paper by the writer, " The Element Bosheth in Hebrew Proper Names," in \\\Q Journal of Bibl. Liter, xiii. 20-30.



170 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
E-la-li (perhaps an epithet for the fire-god Gibil), Ul-mash-shitum, and a serpent god Sir. Most of these may be safely
put down as of purely local origin and jurisdiction, and it is hardly likely that any of them embody an idea not already covered by those which we have discussed. From the lists of
gods prepared by the Babylonian scholars, it is clear that the number of local deities whose names at least survived to a late
period was exceedingly large, ranging in the thousands; and since, as seems likely, these lists were prepared (as so much of
the lexicographical literature) on the basis of the temple lists and of the commercial and legal documents, we may conclude
that all, or at any rate most, of these deities were in use as
elements in proper names, without, however, having much
importance beyond this incorporation.



CHAPTER X.
THE MINOR GODS IN THE PERIOD OF HAMMURABI.
COMING back now to the historical texts and placing the
minor deities together that occur in the inscriptions of Hammurabi and his successors down through the restoration of
native rulers on the throne of Babylonia, we obtain the follow
ing list : Zakar, Lugal-mit-tu (?), Nin-dim-su, Ba-kad, Pap-u, Belit-ekalli, Shumalia, Shukamuna, Gula, Shir, Shubu, Belit of
Akkad, Malik, Bunene, Nin-igi-nangar-bu, Gushgin-banda, Ninkurra, Nin-zadim. In view of the limited amount of historical
material at our disposal for the second period of Babylonian
history, the list of course does not permit us to form a definite
notion of the total number of minor gods that were still occa
sionally invoked by the side of the great gods. By comparison, however, with the pantheon so far as ascertained of the first
period, the conclusion is justified that with the systematization of cults and beliefs characteristic of the Hammurabi, a marked
tendency appears towards a reduction of the pantheon, a weed
ing out of the numerous local cults, their absorption by the
larger ones, and the relegation of the minor gods of only local significance to a place among the spirits and demons of the Babylonian religion. Brief statements of these minor gods
will suffice to indicate their general character. Of most of
the gods in this list there is but little we know as yet beyond
the name. Some of them will occur again in the Assyrian
and Neo-Babylonian historical texts, others in the hymns and incantations; some are only found in the period we are
considering, though with the material constantly increasing we must beware of drawing any conclusions from the fact of a



172 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
single mention. '
Zakar,' signifying, probably,
*
heroic,' appears to have been worshipped in Nippur, where a wall known as the 'wall of Zakar' was built by Samsu-iluna. From the fact that
this wall was sacred to Nin-khar-sag or Belit, we may, perhaps, be permitted to conclude that f Zakar ' stood in close relation
ship to Bel and Belit of Nippur, possibly a son, or, at all events, belonged to the inner circle of deities worshipped in
the old city sacred to the great Bel. Another wall in Nippur was dedicated by this Samsu-iluna
to a god whose name is provisionally read by Winckler, Lugal
mit-tu. 1 Lugal, signifying
'
king,' is an element that enters as
an ideograph in the composition of the names of several deities.
Thus we have Lugal-edinna,
'
king of the field,' which is the
equivalent of Nergal, and again for the same god, the combina
tion Lugal-gira, which is, as Jensen 2 has shown, 'raging king,' and a title of Nergal in his character as the god of pestilence
and war. Nin-dim-su, Ba-kad, Pap-u, Belit-ekalli, Shumalia, and Shukamuna occur at the close of the inscription of Melishikhu,
among the gods asked to curse the transgressors of the royal decree.3 That some of these are Cassite deities imported into
Babylonia, and whose position in the pantheon was therefore of
a temporary character, there seems little reason to question. Ba
kad may, and Shumalia quite certainly does, belong to this class. As for Shukamuna, the fact that Agumkakrimi, who places his
title,
'
king of Cassite land,' before that of Akkad and Babylon,
opens his inscription with the declaration that he is the glorious
offspring of Shukamuna, fixes the character of this god beyond all doubt ; and Delitzschhas shown 4 that this god was regarded by the Babylonian schoolmen as the equivalent of their own
Nergal. Shukamuna, accordingly, was the Cassite god of
1 The text is defective at the point where the god's name is mentioned. See Keils Bill. 3, i, p. 133. 2 Kosmologie, pp. 481 seq. 3 Belser, Beitrage zur Assyr. ii. 203. col. vi. 4 Kossaer, pp. 25-27.



MINOR GODS IN THE PERIOD OF HAMMURABI. 173
war, who, like Nergal, symbolized the mid-day sun, that is, the raging and destructive power. Shumalia is the consort of
Shukamuna, 1 and is invoked as the '
lady of the shining mountains.' Nin-dim-su is a title of Ea, as the patron of arts.
Belit-ekalli i.e., Belit of the palace appears as the consort
of Ninib, the epithet
' ekalli ' being added to specify what Belit is meant, and to avoid confusion with the consort of Bel. At
the same time it must be confessed that the precise force of
the qualification of ' Belit of the palace' (or temple) escapes us. Ninib's consort, as we know from other sources, was Gula. 2 This name is in some way connected with an Assyrian stem
signifying
'
great,' and it is at least worthy of note that the
word for palace is written by a species of punning etymology
with two signs, e = house and gallu = large. The question suggests itself whether the title ' Belit-ekalli ' may not have its
rise in a further desire to play upon the goddess's name, just as
her title Kallat-Eshara (bride of Eshara, or earth) rests upon
such a play. Such plays on names are characteristic of the
Semites, and indeed in a measure are common to all ancient nations, to whom the name always meant much more than to
us. Every nomen, as constituting the essence of an object, was
always and above all an omen. It is, therefore, plausible to suppose that titles of the gods should have been chosen in part
under the influence of this idea.3 A further suggestion that
I would like to offer is that *
ekallu,' as temple or palace (lit., large house), may be one of the numerous names of the nether
world. A parallel would be furnished by Ekur, which signifies both '
temple ' and '
earth,' 4 and is also one of the names of the
gathering-place of the dead. Gula, being the goddess of the
1 Delitzsch, Kossaer, p. 33. 2 See above, p. 105. 3 Examples of punning etymologies on names of gods are frequent. See Jensen's discussion of Nergal for examples of various plays upon the name of the god.
Kosmologiet pp. 185 scq. 4 Jensen, Kosmologic, pp. 185 seq. and p. 218.



174 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
nether world who restores the dead to life, would be appropri
ately called ' the lady of the nether world.' One should like to
know more of Pap-u (the phonetic reading unknown), who is called the offspring of Eshara, and 'the lord of the boundary.'
Eshara, as Jensen has shown, 1 is a poetical name for earth. The god Ninib, in his capacity as a god of agriculture, is called the '
product of Eshara.' 2 Pap-u, therefore, must be a god somewhat of the same character a conclusion which is borne out
by the description given of him as the protector of the bound
ary. He is probably one of the numerous forms of boundary gods that are met with among all nations. That we do not encounter more in Babylonia is due to the decided tendency
that has been noted towards a centralization of power in a
limited number of deities. Instead of gods of boundaries, we
have numerous demons and spirits in the case of the developed
Babylonian religion, into whose hands the care of preserving the rights of owners to their lands is entrusted. Symbols of
these spirits serpents, unicorns, scorpions, and the like are added on the monuments which were placed at the bound
aries, and on which the terms were specified that justified the land tenure. To this class of monuments the name of
' Kudurru,' or ' boundary '
stones, was given by the Babylonians themselves. The inscription on which the name of Pap-u
occurs belongs to this class ; and he is invoked, as already said, along with many other gods in fact, with the whole or a
goodly portion of the pantheon. It would seem, therefore, that we have in Pap-u a special boundary god who has survived
in that role from a more primitive period of Babylonian culture.
He occupies a place usually assigned to the powerful demons who are regarded as the real owners of the soil. 3
1 Kosmologie, p. 195. 2 Rawlinson, i. 29, 16. 3 This notion that the ground belongs to the gods, and that man is only a tenant, survives to a late period in Semitic religions. The belief underlies the Pentateuchal enactments regarding the holding of the soil, which is only to be temporary. See W. R. Smith, Religion of the Semites, pp. 91 seq.



MINOR GODS IN TUK I'EIUOD OF IIAMML'KAIU. 175
Perhaps the most interesting of the minor deities during this
second period is
GULA.
As has just been stated, she is the consort of Ninib. She
is not mentioned in any of the inscriptions of this period till
we come to the days of Nebuchadnezzar I., who invokes her
as the bride of Eshara, />., of the earth. 1 We also meet
with her name in that of several individuals, Balatsu-Gula a and Arad-Gula, 3 and we have seen that she is also known as Damit and Mamu, or Meme. We have a proof, therefore, of
her cult being firmly established at an early period of Babylonian history. Her role is that of a '
life-giver,' in the widest sense of the word. She is called the 'great physician,' who both preserves the body in health and who removes sickness and disease by the * touch of her hand.' Gula is the one who
leads the dead to a new life. She shares this power, however, with her husband Ninib. Her power can be exerted for evil
as well as for good. She is appealed to, to strike the enemy with blindness ; she can bring on the very diseases that she is
able to heal, and such is the stress laid upon these qualities that she is even addressed as the ' creator of mankind.' But although it is the 'second' birth of mankind over which she
presides, she does not belong to the class of deities whose concern is with the dead rather than the living. The Baby
lonians, as we shall have occasion to point out, early engaged
in speculations regarding the life after death, and, as a result, there was developed a special pantheon for the nether world.
Gula occupies a rather unique place intermediate, as it were, between the gods of the living and the gods of the dead.
1 In Babylonian, Kallat Eshara, with another play upon her name. See above,
P- '732 I.e., [Protect] his life, O Gula. 3 Servant of Gula.



176 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
Of the other deities occurring in the inscription of this same
Nebuchadnezzar I. it is sufficient to note that two, Shir and Shubu, are enumerated among the gods of Bit-Khabban. They
were, therefore, local deities of some towns that never rose to
sufficient importance to insure their patrons a permanent place in the Babylonian pantheon.
' Belit of Akkad,' whom Nebuchadnezzar invokes, is none other than the great Belit, the con
sort of Bel. ' Akkad ' is here used for Babylonia, and the
qualification is added to distinguish her from other *
ladies,'
as, e.g.,
'
Belit-ekalli,' who, we have seen, was Gula.
MALIK AND BUNENE.
Upon reaching so late a period as the days of Nabubaliddin
(c. 850 B.C.), it becomes doubtful whether we are justified in
including the additional deities occurring in his inscription among the Babylonian pantheon of the second period. The occurrence of some of these gods in the religious literature is
a presumption in favor of regarding them as ancient creations, rather than due to later influences. Certainly this appears to be the case with Malik and Bunene, who, with Shamash, form
a triad that constitutes the chief object of worship in the great
temple E-babbara at Sippar, to whose restored cult Nabu-bal
iddin devotes himself. Both names, moreover, occur as parts of proper names in the age of Hammurabi. Malik i.e., ruler
is one of the names frequently assigned to Shamash, just as the god's consort was known as Malkatu, but for all that Malik
is not the same as Shamash. Accompanying the inscription of
Nabubaliddin is a design 1 representing the sun-god seated in
his shrine. Before him on a table rests a wheel, and attached to the wheel are cords held by two figures, who are evidently directing the course of the wheel. These two figures are Malik
1 See VR. pi. 60.



MINOR GODS IN THE PERIOD OF HAMMURABI. 177
and Bunene, a species of attendants, therefore, on the sun-god, who drive the fiery chariot that symbolized the great orb.
Bunene, through association with Malik, becomes the latter's
consort, and it is interesting to observe the extent to which the
tendency of the Babylonian religion to conceive the gods in pairs goes. Bunene is not the only instance of an originally male deity becoming through various circumstances the female consort to another. Originally, Malik may have been a name
under whibh the sun-god was worshipped at some place, for the conception that makes him the chariot-driver to Shamash
appears to be late. The absorption by the greater sun-cults (at Sippar and Larsa more particularly) of the lesser ones leads to the complete transfer of the names of minor sun-deities to
the great Shamash, but in some instances the minor deities
continue to lead a shadowy existence in some role of service to
the greater ones.
NlN-IGI-NANGAR-BU, GUSHGIN-BANDA, NlN-KURRA, AND NlNZADIM.
We have seen that Ea, among other powers assigned to him, was regarded as the god of fine arts, in the first instance as
the god of the smithy, because of the antiquity and importance of the smith's art, and then of art in general, including
especially the production of great statues. In accordance with this conception, Nabubaliddin declares that it was through the
wisdom of Ea that he succeeded in manufacturing the great
image of Shamash that was set up by him in the temple at Sippar. But in the days of Nabubaliddin the arts had been
differentiated into various branches, and this differentiation
was expressed by assigning to each branch some patron god who presided over that section. In this way, the old belief

same time it entered upon new phases. 1 Accordingly, Nabubaliddin assigns several deities who act the part of assistants
to Ea. The names of these deities point to their functions.
Nin-igi-nangar-bu is the * lord who presides over metal-workers '
;
Gushgin-banda,
' brilliant chief,' is evidently the patron of those
skilled in the working of the bright metals; Nin-kurra, 'lord of mountain,' the patron of those that quarried the stones ; while Nin-zadim is the patron of sculpture. Ea stands above
these as a general overseer, but the four classes of laborers
symbolized by gods indicate the manner of artistic construction in the advanced state of Babylonian art, and of the various
distinct professions to which this art gave birth. In a certain
sense, of course, these four gods associated with Ea belong to the Babylonian pantheon, but not in the same sense in which
Ea, for example, or the other gods discussed in this chapter,
belong to it. They cannot even be said to be gods of a minor
order they are hardly anything more than personifications of certain phenomena that have their source in the human intel
lect. In giving to these personified powers the determinative indicative of deity, the Babylonian schoolmen were not conscious
of expressing anything more than their belief in the divine
origin of the power and skill exercised by man. To represent
such power as a god was the only way in which the personification could at all be effected under the conditions presented
by Babylonian beliefs. When, therefore, we meet with such gods as Nin-zadim,
' lord of sculpture,' it is much the same as when in the Old Testament we are told that Tubal-cain was
the * father ' of those that work in metals, and where similarly other arts are traced back to a single source. ' Father ' in
Oriental hyperbole signifies
'
source, originator, possessor, or patron,' and, indeed, includes all these ideas. The Hebrew
writer, rising to a higher level of belief, conceives the arts to
1 To this day in the Orient, fine productions of man's skill are attributed to the influence of hidden spirits, good or bad, as the case may be.



MINOR GODS IN THE PERIOD OF HAMMURABI. 179
have originated through some single personage endowed with divine powers ;
l the Babylonian, incapable as yet of making this distinction, ascribes both the origin and execution of the
art directly to a god. In this way, new deities were apparently created even at an advanced stage of the Babylonian religion,
but deities that differed totally from those that are character
istic of the earlier periods. The differentiation of the arts,
and the assignment of a patron to each branch, reflect the
thoughts and the aspirations of a later age. These views must have arisen under an impulse to artistic creation that was
called forth by unusual circumstances, and I venture to think
that this impulse is to be traced to the influence of the Assyrian
rulers, whose greatest ambition, next to military glory, was to leave behind them artistic monuments of themselves that might
unfold to later ages a tale of greatness and of power. Sculpture and works in metal were two arts that flourished in a
special degree in the days when Assyria was approaching the zenith of her glory. Nabubaliddin's reign falls within this
period ; and we must, therefore, look from this time on for
traces of Assyrian influence in the culture, the art, and also
to some extent in the religious beliefs of the southern district
of Mesopotamia.
1 This position does not, of course, exclude the fact that in the original form of
the tradition, Tubal-cain, Naamah, and other personages in the fourth chapter of Genesis were deities.



CHAPTER XI.
SURVIVALS OF ANIMISM IN THE BABYLONIAN RELIGION.
THE Assyrian influence however was only one factor, and a minor factor at that, in maintaining the belief in countless
spirits that occupied a place of more or less importance by the side of the great and lesser gods. That conservatism
which is a distinguishing trait of the popular forms of religion everywhere, served to keep alive the view that all the acts
of man, his moods,, the accidents that befell him, were under
the control of visible or invisible powers. The development
of a pantheon, graded and more or less regulated under the guidance of the Babylonian schoolmen, did not drive the old animistic views out of existence. In the religious litera
ture, and more especially in those parts of it which reflect
the popular forms of thought, the unorganized mass of spirits maintain an undisputed sway. In the incantation texts, which
will be discussed at length in a subsequent chapter, as well as
in other sections of Babylonian literature embodying both the
primitive and the advanced views of the Babylonians regarding the origin of the universe, its subdivisions, and its order of
development, and, thirdly, in the legends and epics, hundreds of spirits are introduced, to which some definite function or func
tions were assigned. In many, indeed in the majority of cases, the precise character of these functions still escapes us. The
material at our disposal is as yet inadequate for any satisfactory treatment of this phase of Babylonian belief, and we must con
tent ourselves for the present with some generalizations, or at the most with some broad classifications. Besides the texts
themselves, we have proper names containing a spirit as an element, and also lists of those spirits prepared by the schoolmen



ANIMJSM IN Till'. BABYLONIAN RELIGION. 181
on the basis of the texts. When, as sometimes happens, these
lists contain explanatory comments on the spirits enumerated, we are able to take some steps forward in our knowledge of the
subject. In the first place, then, it is important to bear in mind that the numerous spirits, when introduced into the religious and
other texts, are almost invariably preceded by a sign technically known as a determinative which stamps them as divine.
This sign being the same as the one placed before the
names of the gods, it is not always possible to distinguish between deities and spirits. The use of a common sign is
significant as pointing to the common origin of the two classes
of superior powers that thus continue to exist side by side. A
god is naught but a spirit writ large. As already intimated in a previous chapter, a large part of the development of the Babylonian region consists in the differentiation between the gods
and the spirits, a process that, beginning before the period of written records, steadily went on, and in a certain sense was
never completed. In the historical texts, the gods alone, with
certain exceptions, find official recognition, and it is largely through these texts that we are enabled to distinguish between the two classes of powers, the gods and the spirits ; but as a
survival of a primitive animism, the demons, good, bad, and
indifferent, retain their place in the popular forms of religion. Several hundred spirits occur in the incantation texts, and almost
as many more in other religious texts. We may distinguish several classes. In the first place, there are the demons that cause
disease and all manner of physical annoyances. The chief of these will be considered when we come to the analysis of the
incantation texts. Against these demons the sufferer seeks
protection by means of formulas, the utterance of which is
invested with peculiar power, and again by means of certain rites of an expiatory or purificatory character. Next, we have the demons supposed to inhabit the fields, and to whom



182 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
the ground is supposed to belong. These were imaged under various animal forms, serpents and scorpions being the favor
ite ones. When possession was taken of the field, the spirits
inhabiting it had to be propitiated. The owner placed himself under their protection, and endeavored to insure his rights
against wrongful encroachment by calling upon the demons to range themselves on his side. It was customary, especially in
the case of territory acquired by special grant of the monarch, or under extraordinary circumstances, to set up a so-called boundary stone, 1 on which the owner of the field detailed his
right to possession, through purchase or gift, as the case may be. This inscription closed with an appeal to various gods to
strike with their curses any intruder upon the owner's rights.
Iri addition to this, the stones are embellished with serpents,
scorpions, unicorns, and various realistic or fantastic representations of animal forms. These, it would seem, symbolize the
spirits, the sight of which, it was hoped, might act as a further and effectual warning against interference with the owner's rights.
2
A special class of demons is formed by those which were
supposed to infest the resting-places of the dead, though they stand in a certain relationship to the demons that plague the
living. A remarkable monument found a number of years ago,
1 The technical name for this class of monuments was Kudurru. z.e., mark, and then used like the German word Mark both for boundary and for . the territory included within the bounds. A notable contribution to the interpretation of the Kudurru monuments was made by Belser, in the Beitr'dge zur Assyriologie, ii.
111-203. 2 The question has been raised (see Belser, ib. p. in) by Pinches whether these representations are not the symbols of the zodiac, but, as Belser justly remarks, the attempt to interpret the pictures in this way has not been successful. It still
seems most plausible to regard the pictures as symbols of spirits or demons. Such an interpretation is in accord with the Babylonian and general Semitic view of land ownership. At the same time, it must be confessed that we are still in the dark as to the motives underlying the choice of the animals portrayed. There may be some ultimate connection with some of the signs of the zodiac, so Hommel believes, but such connection would have to be judged from the earlier forms that animism takes on, and not in the light of an advanced theology such as appears in the zodiacal system of the Babylonians.



ANIMISM IN THE BABYLONIAN RELIGION. 183
and which will be fully described in a subsequent chapter, affords us a picture of some of these demons whose sphere of
action is more particularly in the subterranean cave that forms
the gathering-place of the dead. They are represented as half human, half animal, with large grotesque and terror-inspiring features. 1 Their power, however, is limited. They are subject to the orders of the gods whose dominion is the lower world,
more particularly to Nergal and his consort Allatu. In the
advanced eschatology of the Babylonians the demons play a minor part. It is with the gods that the dead man must make
his peace. Their protection assured, he has little to fear ; but the demons of the lower world frequently ascend to the upper
regions to afflict the living. Against them precautions must be taken similar to the means employed for ridding one's self of
the baneful influence of the disease- and pain-bringing spirits.
Reference has already been made to the spirits that belong to
the higher phases of Mesopotamian culture, those that have
a share in the production of works of skill and art. We have
seen that in accounting for these we are justified in assuming a higher phase of religious belief. The dividing line between god
and spirit becomes faint, and the numerous protecting patrons of the handicrafts that flourished in Babylonia and Assyria can
hardly be placed in the same category with those we have so far been considering. Still, to the popular mind the achievements of the human mind were regarded as due to the workings
of hidden forces. Strange as it may seem, there was an indis
position to ascribe everything to the power of the gods. Ea and Nabu, although the general gods of wisdom, did not concern themselves with details. These were left to the secondary
powers, the spirits. Hence it happens that by the side of the
great gods, we have a large number of minor powers who preside over the various branches of human handiwork and control the products of the human mind.

184 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
Reserving further details regarding the several classes of
demons and spirits enumerated, it will suffice to say a few
words about one particular group of spirits whose role was
peculiarly prominent in both historical, liturgical, and general religious texts. The tendency to systematize the beliefs in
spirits manifests itself in Babylonia, equally with the grouping of the gods into certain classes. In consequence of this general
tendency, the conception arose of a group of spirits that comprised the associated secondary powers of earth and heaven, somewhat as Anu, Bel, and Ea summed up the quintessence of
the higher powers or gods. This group was known as the
ANUNNAKI AND IGIGI.
Regarding these names it may be said that the former has
not yet been satisfactorily interpreted. On the assumption that the union of the syllables A-nun-na-ki 1 represents a com
pound ideograph, the middle syllable nun signifies
'
strength,' whereas the first is the ordinary ideograph for * water.' Hom
mel 2 proposed to interpret the name therefore as '
gods of the
watery habitation.' The artificiality of this manner of writing points, as in several instances noted, to a mere '
play
' upon the real name. Anunna reminds one forcibly of the god Anu
and of the goddess Anunit, and the element ak is quite a
common afformative in Babylonian substantives, conveying a certain emphatic meaning to the word. If therefore we may
compare Anun with the name of the god of heaven, the name
Anunnak embodying, as it does in this case, the idea of power,
would be an appropriate designation for the spirits, or a group of spirits collectively. Be it understood that this explanation is offered merely as a conjecture, which, however, finds support in the meaning attached to the term '
Igigi.' This, as
1 The element ki is sometimes omitted. The force of na is not clear, unless it be
a phonetic complement merely. 2 Semitische Volkcr. p. 369.



ANIMISM IN THE BABYLONIAN RELIGION. 185
Halevy and Guyard have recognized, is a formation of a well-known stem occurring in Babylonian, as well as in other Semitic languages, that has the meaning '
strong.' The ideo
graphic form of writing the name likewise designates the spirits as * the great chiefs.' The *
Igigi,' therefore, are ' the strong ones,' and strength being the attribute most commonly assigned to the Semitic deities, 1 there is a presumption, at least, in favor
of interpreting Anunnak, or Anunnaki, 2 in the same way. The 'Igigi' are at times designated as the seven gods, but this
number is simply an indication of their constituting a large group. Seven is a round number which marked a large quan
tity. At an earlier period five represented a numerical magnitude, and hence the Anunnaki are at times regarded as a group
of five.3 The Anunnaki and Igigi appear for the first time
in an historical text in the inscription of the Assyrian king Rammannirari I., who includes them in his appeal to the
great gods. He designates the Igigi as belonging to heaven, the Anunnaki as belonging to the earth. The manner in
which he uses the names shows conclusively that, at this early
period, the two groups comprehended the entire domain over which spirits, and for that matter also the gods, exercised their
power. Indeed, it would appear that at one time the two names were used to include the gods as well as the spirits.
At least this appears to be the case in Assyria, and the conclu
sion may be drawn, from the somewhat vague use of the terms,
that the names belong to a very early period of the religion, when the distinction between gods and spirits was not yet
1 Very many of the names of the Semitic gods and heroes signify strong, e.g., /, Adon, Baal, Etana, Kcmosh, etc. 2 The final vowel / would, on the basis of the explanation offered, be paralleled by the i of Igigi an indication of the plural. See Delitzsch, Assyr. Gram. 67, i. 3 The Igigi are designated ideographically as v plus ii, and Hommel (Semitische Volker, p. 491) properly suggests that this peculiar writing points to an earlier use of five as constituting the group. Hommel, however, does not see that neither five nor seven are to be interpreted literally, but that both represent a large round number, and, therefore, also a holy one.



186 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
clearly marked. However that may be, in Babylonian hymns and incantations the Igigi and Anunnaki play a very prominent
part. Ami is represented as the father of both groups. But they are also at the service of other gods, notably of Bel, who
is spoken of as their *
lord,' of Ninib, of Marduk, of Ishtar, and of Nergal. They prostrate themselves before these superior masters, and the latter at times manifest their anger against
the Igigi. They are sent out by the gods to do service. Their
character is, on the whole, severe and cruel. They are not
favorable to man, but rather hostile to him. Their brilliancy
consumes the land. Their power is feared, and Assyrian kings
more particularly are fond of adding the Igigi and Anunnaki to
the higher powers the gods proper when they wish to inspire a fear of their own majesty. At times the Igigi alone
are mentioned, but generally the Igigi and Anunnaki appear in combination. To the latest period of Babylonian history these
two groups continue to receive official recognition. Nebuchadnezzar II. 1 dedicates an altar, which he erects at the wall of the
city of Babylon, to the Igigi and Anunnaki. The altar is called a structure of 'joy and rejoicing,' and on the festival of Marduk, who is the 'lord of the Anunnaki and Igigi,' sacrifices were
offered at this altar. In the great temple of Marduk there was
a fountain in which the gods and the Anunnaki, according to a
Babylonian hymn, 'bathe their countenance'; and when to this notice it be added that another hymn praises them as the
'
shining chiefs' of the ancient city of Eridu, it will be apparent
that the conceptions attached to this group span the entire
period of Babylonian-Assyrian history. Besides the Igigi and Anunnaki there is still a third group of
seven spirits, generally designated as the ' evil demons,' who
represent the embodiment of all physical suffering to which man is subject. They appear, however, only in the incantation texts, and we may, therefore, postpone their consideration
i IR. 55, col. iv. 11. 7-13.



ANIMISM AV 77/A' HAUYLOX/AX RELIGION. 187
until that subject is reached. The point to be borne in mind,
and which I have attempted to emphasize in this place, is the
close relationship existing in the popular forms of the Babylonian religion between the gods and the spirits. The latter
belong to the pantheon as much as the former. Primitive animism continues to enchain the minds of the people, despite
the differentiation established between the higher ahd the
secondary powers, and despite the high point of development reached by the schoolmen in their attempts to systematize and,
in a measure, to purify the ancient beliefs.



CHAPTER XII.
THE ASSYRIAN PANTHEON.
WE have now reached a point where it will be proper to set
forth the phases that the Babylonian religion assumed during the days of Assyrian supremacy. An enumeration of the gods occurring in the inscriptions of the rulers of Assyria from the earliest days to the close of the
empire, so far as published, will show better than any argu
ment the points of similarity between the Babylonian and the Assyrian pantheon. These gods are in alphabetical order: 1 Anu, Ashur, Bel, Belit, Gaga, Gibil, Gamlat, Gula, Dibbarra, Dagan, Damkina, Ea, Ishtar, Kadi, Khani, Marduk, Nabu, Nana, Nin-gal, Nergal, Ninib, Nusku, Ramman, Sin, Shala, Shalman, Shamash, Shanitka(P), Tashmitum. Of these quite a number are only mentioned incidentally, and in a manner that
indicates that they do not belong to the pantheon in the strict
sense. Others, like Khani 2 and Gamlat, />., 'the merciful
one,' 3 may turn out to be mere epithets of deities otherwise
known ; and it would hardly be legitimate to extend the list by
including deities that have not yet been identified, 4 and which
may similarly be only variant forms, descriptive of such as are already included. But however much this list may be extended and modified by further publications and researches, the historical material at hand for the Assyrian period of the
religion is sufficient to warrant us in setting up two classes
of the pantheon, one class constituting the active pan

7 '///< ASSYRIAN PANTHEON. 189
theon, the other, deities introduced by the kings merely for
purposes of self-glorification, or to give greater solemnity to the invocations and warnings that formed a feature of all com
memorative and dedicatory inscriptions, as well as of the
annals proper. The future additions to the list, it is safe to
assert, will increase the second class and only slightly modify,
if at all, the first class. Bearing in mind this distinction we
may put down as active forces in Assyria the following: Anu, Ashur, Bel, Belit, Gula, Dagan, Ea, Khani, Ishtar, Marduk,
Nabu, Nergal, Ninib, Nusku, Raminan, Sin, Shala, Shamash, Tashmitum.
Comparing both the fuller and the restricted list with the
Babylonian pantheon during the two periods treated of in the preceding chapters, we are struck by three facts : (i)
the smaller compass of the Assyrian pantheon ; (2) the more restricted introduction of what, for want of a better term, we
may call minor deities ; and (3) the small number of new
deities met with. To take up the latter point, the only gods
in the above list that are not found in Babylonian inscriptions
are Ashur, Gibil, Gamlat, Dibbarra, Kadi, Nusku, Shala, Shanitka. Of these it is purely accidental that Gibil, Dibbarra,
Nusku, and Shala are not mentioned, for, except those that
are foreign importations, they belong to Babylonia as much as to Assyria and fall within the -periods of the Babylonian religion that have been treated of. Kadi is a foreign deity.
1
Shanitka(P) may only be a title of some goddess, and Shalman (or Shalmannu) occurs only in proper names, and may likewise be only a title of some god. 2 There remains, as the
only god peculiar to Assyria, the god Ashur. But for this god, the Babylonian and the Assyrian pantheon are identical.
1 The Assyrian kings are fond of mentioning foreign deities, and of adding them to their pantheon. In his annals (VR. col. vi. 11. 30-43) Ashurbanabal gives a list of twenty Elamitic deities captured by him.
- Tide (Rabyl.-Assyr. Gcschichte, p. 519) suggests Ea.



190 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
When we come, however, to the position held by the gods in the pantheon, their relationship to one another, and the traits which secured for them popular and royal favor, the differ
ences between the Babylonian and the Assyrian phases of the religion will be found to be more accentuated.
As for the smaller compass of the Assyrian pantheon, we may recognize in this a further advance of the tendency
already noted in the second period of the Babylonian religion. There, too, we found the minor local cults yielding to the growing influence and favor of certain gods associated with
the great centers of Babylonian life, or possessing attributes that accorded more with the new political order and the
general advance of culture. One of the chief factors in this
tendency towards centralization was, as we saw, the supremacy accorded to Marduk in the new empire as the patron god of
the capital, and that not only led to his absorbing the role of
other deities, 1 but resulted also in strengthening the belief
that there were only a limited number of deities upon whose
power and willingness to aid dependence could be placed. This tendency was in a measure offset by the pride that the
rulers of the second Babylonian period still took in parading
at times, as large a number as possible of deities under whose
protection they claimed to stand. As we pass from one age to the other, the number of minor deities thus invoked also tends to diminish, and the occasions likewise when they are invoked become limited to the more solemn invocations at the begin
ning and the close of inscriptions. Now, in Assyria we have
1 An interesting example of this tendency is furnished by a tablet published by T. G. Finches {Journal of the Victoria Institute, xxviii. 8-10), in which the name Marduk is treated almost as a generic term for deity. Nergal is called ' the Marduk of warfare '
; Nebo, ' the Marduk of earthly possessions '
; Ninib,
' the Marduk of strength' ; En-lil,
' the Marduk of sovereignty '
; and so on, in a long enumeration, the gods are regarded as so many forms of Marduk. Pinches' conclusion that the list points to monotheistic beliefs is, however, unwarranted. The list only illustrates a tendency towards a centralization of divine powers in Marduk, that accompanies the political centralization of the period.



THE ASSYRIAN PANTHEON. 191
much the same political conditions as in Babylonia, only
intensified. Here, too, we have one god towering above the
others, only to a still greater degree even than Marduk in Babylonia. Marduk, while absorbing the role of the old Bel,
is still bound to acknowledge the fathership of Ea. For a time he has to fear the rivalry of Nabu, and we have seen that
during the Cassitic rule, the glory of Marduk is somewhat dimmed. The god who comes to stand at the head of the
Assyrian pantheon Ashur suffers from none of these
restrictions. He is independent of other gods and is under
no obligations to any of his fellows, and his rule once acknowl
edged remains supreme, with, perhaps, one short period excepted, 1 throughout all the vicissitudes that the empire
undergoes. As a consequence of this unique position, Ashur is so completely identified with Assyria, that with the fall
of the empire he, too, disappears, whereas the Marduk cult
survives the loss of Babylonian independence, and is undis
turbed even by the final absorption of Babylonia into the
empire of Cyrus. The tendency towards centralization of the
cult is even more pronounced, therefore, in Assyria than in Babylonia. Marduk is a leader who has many gods as followers, but all of whom have their distinct functions. Ashur
is a host in himself. He needs no attendants. His aid suf
fices for all things, and such is the attachment of his subjects
to him that it would almost appear like an insult to his dignity
to attach a long array of minor gods to him. For the Assyrian
kings the same motives did not exist as for the Babylonians
to emphasize their control over all parts of their empire by
adding the chief gods of these districts to the pantheon.
Assyria was never split up into independent states like Babylonia before the days of Hammurabi. The capital, it is true, changed with considerable frequency, but there was always
only one great center of political power. So far as Assyrian
1 See below, pp. 228, 229.



192 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION,
control over Babylonia was concerned, it was sufficient for the
purposes of the Assyrian rulers to claim Marduk as their patron
and protector, and, as we shall see, they always made a point of emphasizing this claim. Hence we have only 'great gods,' l and no minor deities, in the train of Ashur. These '
great gods ' could not be expunged from the pantheon without a complete severance of the ties that bound the Assyrians to
their past. Kings of great empires seldom favor religious revolutions. But by the side of Ashur these great gods pale, and in the course of time the tendency becomes more marked to regard them merely as formal members of a little court with
few functions of their own, beyond that of adding by their
presence to the majesty and glory of Ashur. One receives the
impression that in Assyria only a few of the gods invoked by the kings at the side of Ashur exert any real influence on the
lives of the people ; and such as do, gain favor through possessing in some measure the chief attribute that distinguished
Ashur, prowess in war. They are little Ashurs, as it were, by the side of the great one. The position of Ashur in the
Assyrian pantheon accounts for the general tendencies mani
fested by the religion of the northern empire, and upon a clear conception of the character of Ashur depends our understand
ing of the special points that distinguish the other gods from what we have learned of their character and traits in the south
ern states. The beginning, therefore, of an account of the
Assyrian pantheon is properly to be made with Ashur.
ASHUR.
The starting-point of the career of Ashur is the city of
Ashur, situated on the west bank of the Tigris, not far from the point where the lower Zab flows into the Tigris. Ashur is
1 So the gods of the Assyrian pantheon are generally termed in the inscriptions of
the kings.



THE ASSYRIAN PANTHEON. 193
therefore distinctly a local deity, and so far as the testimony of
the texts goes, he was never regarded in early days in any other
light than as the local patron of the city to which he has given
his name. He was never worshipped, so far as can be ascer
tained, as a manifestation of any of the great powers of nature,
the sun or the moon ; though, if anything, he was originally a
solar deity.
1 Nor was he a symbol of any of the elements, fire
or water. In this respect he differs from Sin, Shamash, Nusku, 2
and Ea, whose worship was localized, without affecting the 07/tf.r/-universal character that these deities possessed. As a local deity his worship must have been limited to the city over
which he spread his protecting arm ; and if we find the god
afterwards holding jurisdiction over a much larger territory than the city of Ashur, it is because in the north, as in the
south, a distinct state or empire was simply regarded as the extension of a city. Ashur became the god of Assyria as
the rulers of the city of Ashur grew in power, in the same
way that Marduk, upon the union of the Babylonian states under the supremacy of the city of Babylon, became the god of all Babylonia. But a difference between the north and
the south is to be noted. Whereas Marduk, although the
god of Babylonia, was worshipped only in the city of Babylon where he was supposed to have his seat, temples to Ashur existed in various parts of the Assyrian empire. The
god accompanied the kings in their wars, and wherever the
rulers settled, there the god was worshipped. So in the vari
ous changes of official residences that took place in the course
of Assyrian history from Ashur to Calah, and from Calah to Nineveh, and from Nineveh to Khorsabad, the god took
part, and his central seat of worship depended upon the place that the kings chose for their official residence. At the
same time, while the cult in the various temples that in the
course of time were erected in his honor probably continued
1 See below, p. 195. 2 See below, p. 220,



194 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
without interruption, there was always one place the official residence which formed the central spot of worship. There
the god was supposed to dwell for the time being. One
factor, perhaps, that ought to be taken into consideration in
accounting for this movable disposition of the god was that
he was not symbolized exclusively by a statue, as Marduk and the other great gods were. His chief symbol was a standard that could be carried from place to place, and indeed was so made that it could be carried into the thick of the fray,
in order to assure the army of the god's presence. The standard consisted of a pole surrounded by a disc enclosed
within two wings, while above the disc stood the figure of a
warrior in the act of shooting an arrow. 1 The statues of the
gods were deposited in shrines, and after being carried about, as was done on festive days or other occasions, they would
be replaced in their shrines. The military standard, however, followed the camp everywhere, and when the kings chose to
fix upon a new place for their military encampment and
such the official residences of the Assyrian warrior-kings in large measure were the standard would repose in the place selected.
How this standard came to be chosen, and when, is another ques
tion, and one more difficult to answer. It may be that the representation of the god by a standard was a consequence of the fondness that the rulers of Ashur manifested for perpetual war
fare ; or, in other words, that the god Ashur was represented by a standard so that he might be carried into the battle and be
moved from place to place. At all events, the two things the standard and the warlike character of the subjects of
Ashur stood in close relationship to one another, and the further conclusion is justified that when a military standard
came to be chosen as the symbol of Ashur, the god was recog
1 A description of this symbol occurs in a text of Sennacherib (Meissner-Rost, Bauinschriften SanheriU's, p. 94). The symbol itself is found on sculptured slabs and on seal cylinders.



THE ASSYRIAN PANTHEON, 195
nized distinctly as a god of war. The symbols accompanying the standard are of importance as enabling us to determine something more regarding the character of Ashur. In the first
place, the fact that it contained a figure may be taken as an
indication that the god was at one time represented by a statue, as indeed we know from other evidence, 1 and that the change of his symbol from a statue to a standard is a result of
the military activity of the Assyrians. The winged disc is so general a symbol of the sun in the religious system of various ancient nations 2 that one cannot escape the conclusion that
the symbol must be similarly interpreted in the case before us.
Is it possible, therefore, that in a period lying beyond that revealed by the oldest inscriptions at our disposal, Ashur was
worshipped as a solar deity ? One is bound to confess that the evidence does not warrant us in regarding Ashur as any
thing but the patron of the city of Ashur. Nowhere do we
find any allusion from which we are justified in concluding that
he originally represented some elemental power or phenomenon. Tiele 3 is of the decided opinion, that Ashur was at his origin a
nature god of some kind, and he goes so far as to suggest,
though with due reserve, the possible identification of Ashur
with Sin. No doubt Tiele is .prompted to this view by the
example of the great god of the south, Marduk, who is originally a solar deity, and by all the other great gods who represent, or represented, some power of nature. Analogy, however, is not a sufficiently reliable guide to settle a question for the
solution of which historical material is lacking. So much,
however, may be said, that if we are to assume that Ashur
personified originally some natural power, the symbol of the winged disc lends a strong presumption in favor of supposing

by him (Meissner-Rost, Bauinschriften Sanheritfs, p. 94).

him to have been some phase of the sun. So much, then, for the general character of Ashur. Before passing on to a speci
fication of his role and his traits, as revealed by the historical
texts, a word remains to be said as to the etymology and form of the name. Ashur is the only instance that we have of a
god expressly giving his name to a city, for the name of the city can only be derived from that of the god, and not vice
versa. The identification of the god with his favorite town
must have been so complete that the town, which probably had some specific name of its own, became known simply as the 'city of the god Ashur.' From such a designation it is but
a small step to call the city simply, Ashur. The difference
between the god and the city would be indicated by the determinative for deity, which was only attached to the former, while the latter was written with the determinative attached to towns. When this city of Ashur extended its bounds until it became coequal with the domain of Assyria, the name of the god was transferred to the entire northern district of
Mesopotamia, which, as the country of the god Ashur, was written with the determinative for country. 1 The ideographs
which the Assyrian scribes employed in writing the name of
the god reveal the meaning, they attached to it. He is
described ideographically as the 'good god.' This inter
pretation accords admirably with the general force of the verbal stem underlying the name. In both Hebrew and
Assyrian a-sh-r signifies
' to be gracious, to grant blessing, to cause to prosper.' Ashur, therefore, is the god that blesses his subjects, and to the latter he would accordingly appear as the * good god ' par excellence. If the tempting etymology of our own word 'god,' which connects it with 'good,' be
correct,
'
god ' would be almost the perfect equivalent of Ashur. It is not necessary to conclude, as Tiele does, 2
1 For the sake of convenience it is customary to distinguish between Ashur the god, and the country by writing the latter with a double sh Ashshur.
2 Geschichte, p. 533.



THE ASSYItIAN PANTHEON. 197
that Ashur, as the ' good one,' is an ethical abstraction, but certainly a designation of a god as ' a good one' sounds more like a descriptive epithet than like a name. The supposition that Ashur was not, therefore, the original name of the god receives a certain measure of force from this consideration.
Moreover, there are indications that there actually existed another form of his name, namely, Anshar. 1 This form
Anshar would, according to the phonetic laws prevailing in Assyria, tend to become Ash-shar. 2 Ashur the 'good one' would thus turn out to be an epithet of the god, chosen
as a 'play' suggested by Ash-shar, just as we found Gula
called the lady of Ekalli, and again Kallat (bride).
3 The
etymology of Anshar is as obscure as that of most of the
ancient gods of Babylonia, as of Sin, Marduk, Ishtar, and many more. But before leaving the subject, it will be proper to call attention to the role that a god Anshar plays in the
Babylonian-Assyrian cosmological system. Anshar and Kishar are the second pair of deities to be created, the first pair being Lakhmu and Lakhamn. In the great fight of the gods against
the monster Tiamat, it would appear that, according to one version at least, Anshar sends Anu, Ea, and finally Bel-Marduk, in turn to destroy the monster. He appears, therefore, to have exercised a kind of supremacy over the gods. Assuming the correctness of the deductions, according to which Ashur is an
epithet arising by a play upon Ash-shar (from an original Anshar), it is hardly open to doubt that this Anshar is the
same as the one who appears in the cosmology. On the other hand, it is difficult to suppose that Anshar should have
played so significant a part in Babylonian traditions and yet find no mention in the text of the rulers of Babylonia. Bearing in mind what has been said as to the manner in which ancient

198 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
traditions and myths were remodeled by the schoolmen to con
form to later ideas, we have seen how in this process the popu
larity of Marduk led to his assuming the role originally played by Bel, may not the recognition given to Anshar be a conces
sion, made at the time that Assyria had begun her glorious career (c. 1400 B.C.), to the chief god of the northern empire? That such tendencies to glorify Ashur may justly be sought
for in part of the religious literature is proved by a version of
one of the series of tablets giving an account of the crea
tion, and which assigns to Anshar the work of building Esharra,
i.e., the earth, that, according to another version, belongs
to Marduk. 1 Evidently, then, just as the Babylonian theolo
gians sought to glorify Marduk at the expense of Bel, so Assyrian theologians, or such as stood under Assyrian influences, did not hesitate to replace Marduk by their own favorite, Anshar. In the chapter on the * Cosmology ' we will have
occasion to come back to this point. For present purposes it
is sufficient to have shown that the position of Anshar in the
remodeled traditions is an argument in favor of regarding Anshar as the real, name of the god who stands at the head
of the Assyrian pantheon. In the oldest Assyrian inscription known to us, the god Ashur is mentioned. Samsi-Ramman, who does not yet
assume the title of king, but only patesi, i.e., 'religious chief,' 2 prides himself upon being 'the builder of the temple of Ashur.' The phrase does not mean that he founded
the temple, but only that he undertook building operations in connection with it. The date of this ruler may be fixed
roughly at 1850 B.C., and since the two inscribed bricks that we have of Samsi-Ramman were found in the ruins
of Kalah-Shergat, the site of the ancient city of Ashur,
1 Jensen, Kosmologie, p. 275. 2 The combination of religious supremacy with political power, which characterizes the social state of ancient Babylonia and Assyria, gives to the title patesi
a double significance. In Babylonia, moreover, it acquires the force of vassal-king.



THE ASSYRIAN PANTHEON. 199
there can, of course, be no doubt that the temple at that
place is referred to.
The rulers of Assyria, even after they assumed the title of
'king' (c. 1500 B.C.), were still fond of calling themselves the '
priest
'
o'f the god Ashur, and frequently gave this title the preference over others. In the fourteenth century the temple of Ashur seems to have suffered at the hands of the
Cassites, who attempted to extend their power to the north. This plan was, however, frustrated by Ramman-nirari I., who
forces the Cassites to retreat, successfully opposes other enemies
of Assyria, and restores the injured parts of Ashur's temple. From this time on, and for a period of several centuries,
Assyria assumes an aggressive attitude, and as a consequence the dependency upon the god is more keenly felt than
before. The enemies against whom the kings proceed are called ' the enemies of Ashur/ the troops of the king are the
troops of Ashur, and the weapons with which they fight are the weapons of Ashur. It is he who causes the arms of Tiglathpileser I. to strike down his foes. The nations cannot endure
the awful sight of the god. His brilliancy the reference being no doubt to the shining standard as it was carried into the
fray inspires on every side a terror that casts all enemies to the ground. All warfare is carried on in the name of Ashur.
The statement may be taken literally, for an oracle was sought at critical moments to determine the course that was to be
pursued. The fight itself takes place with the help of the god,
again to be taken literally, for the god, represented by his symbol, is present on the battlefield. The victory, accord
ingly, belongs to the god in the first instance, and only in a secondary degree to the king. The nations are vanquished by Ashur, the conquered cities become subject to Ashur, and when the tribute is brought by the conquered foe, it is to Ashur
that it is offered by the kings. Proud and haughty as the latter
were, and filled with greed for glory and power, they never



200 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
hesitated to humble themselves before their god. They freely
acknowledged that everything they possessed was due to Ashur's favor. It was he who called them to the throne, who gave them the sceptre and crown, and who firmly established their
sovereignty. Through Ashur, who gives the king his invincible weapon, the mighty bow, the kingdom is enlarged, until
the kings feel justified in saying of themselves that, by the nomination of Ashur, they govern the four quarters of the world. Nay, the rulers go further and declare themselves to
be the offspring of Ashur. It is not likely that they ever desired
such an assertion also to be interpreted literally. The phrase is rather to be taken as the strongest possible indication of the
attachment they felt for their chief god. Everything that they
possessed coming directly from their god, how could' this be better expressed than by making the god the source of their
being ? The phrase, at all events, is interesting as showing that the element of love was not absent in the emotions that
the thought of Ashur aroused in the breasts of his subjects.
The kings cannot find sufficient terms of glorification to bestow
upon Ashur. Tiglathpileser I. calls him * the great lord ruling the assembly of gods,' and in similar style, Ashurnasirbal invokes him as 'the great god of all the gods.' For Ram
man-nirari III., he is the king of the Igigi- the heavenly host
of spirits. Sargon lovingly addresses him as the father of the gods. Sennacherib calls him the great mountain or rock, a
phrase that recalls a Biblical metaphor applied to the deity, and Esarhaddon speaks of him as the 'king of gods.' Fre
quently Ashur is invoked together with other gods. He is ' the guide of the gods.' There is only one instance in which he does not occupy the first place. Ramman-nirari I., to whom reference has above been made, gives Anu the prefer
ence over Ashur in a list of gods, 1 to whom conjointly he
ascribes his victories. We have already had occasion (see
1 The full list is Anu, Ashur, Shamash, Ramnian, and Ishtar.



THE ASSYRIAN PANTHEON. 201
pp. 153-155) to note the antiquity of Anu worship in Assyria, the foundation of whose temple takes us beyond the period of Samsi-Ramman. Ashur's importance begins only with the moment that the rulers of his city enter upon their career
of conquest. Before that, his power and fame were limited
to the city over which he presided. Those gods who in the
south occupied a superior rank were also acknowledged in the north. The religion of the Assyrians does not acquire traits
that distinguish it from that of Babylonia till the rise of a dis
tinct Assyrian empire. Here, as in Babylonia, the religious conceptions, and in a measure the art, are shaped by the course
of political events. Anu, accordingly, takes precedence to Ashur previous to the supremacy of the city of Ashur. This
superior rank belongs to him as the supreme god of heaven. Ramman-nirari's reign marks a turning-point in the history of Assyria. The enemies of Ashur, who had succeeded for
a time in obscuring the god's glory through the humiliation which his land endured, were driven back, but neither the
people nor the rulers had as yet become conscious of the fact
that it was solely to Ashur that the victory was due. Hence, other gods are associated with Ashur by Ramman-nirari, and the old god Anu is accorded his proper rank. After the days
of Ramman-nirari, however, Ashur's precedence over all other gods is established. Whether associated with Bel or with Ramman, or with SKamash and Ramman, or with a larger
representation of the pantheon, Ashur is invariably mentioned
first.
From what has been said of the chief trait of Assyrian
history, it follows, as a "matter of course, that the popularity of Ashur is due to the military successes of the Assyrian armies ;
and it follows, with equal necessity, that Ashur, whatever he
may originally have been, becomes purely a god of war, from the moment that Assyria enters upon what appeared to be her
special mission. All the titles given to Ashur by the kings may



202 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
be said to follow from his role as the god who presides over the
fortunes of the wars. If he is the * ruler of all the gods,' and
their father, he is so simply by virtue of that same superior strength which makes him the '
law-giver' for mankind, and not because of any ancient traditions, nor as an expression of some
nature-myth. He lords it over gods and spirits, but he lords it
solely because of his warlike qualities. Ashur is the giver of
crown and sceptre, and the kings of Assyria are the patesis
of the god, his lieutenants. He is the god that embodies the
spirit of Assyrian history, and as such he is the most charac
teristic personage of the Assyrian pantheon in a certain sense the only characteristic personage. So profound is his
influence that almost all the other gods of the pantheon take on some of his character. Whenever and wherever possible,
those phases of the god's nature are emphasized which point to the possession of power over enemies. The gods of the
Assyrian pantheon impress one as diminutive Ashurs by the side of the big one, and in proportion as they approach nearer to the character of Ashur himself, is their hold upon the royal
favor strengthened.
ISHTAR.
Second in rank to Ashur during the most glorious part of
Assyrian history stands the great goddess Ishtar. That the Assyrian Ishtar is identical with the great goddess of the Baby
lonian pantheon is beyond reasonable doubt. She approaches
closest to Nana, the Ishtar of Erech; but just as we found the
Babylonian Ishtar appearing under various names and forms, so there are no less than three Ishtars in Assyria, distinguished
in the texts as Ishtar of Nineveh, Ishtar of Arbela, and Ishtar who presides over the temple known as Kidmuru and who for that reason is generally called ' the queen of Kidmuru.' The
seat of the latter was in Nineveh, as was of course also the seat



THE ASSYRIAN PANTHEON. 203
of Ishtar of Nineveh. The third Ishtar had her cult at Arbela, 1
a town lying to the east of Calah about midway between the upper and lower Zab. It is not easy to determine which of these three Ishtars is the oldest. The Assyrians themselves
'seem to have been aware of the Babylonian origin of Ishtar,
for Tiglathpileser I. is at pains to emphasize that the temple he builds to Ishtar in his capital is dedicated to the 'Assyrian Ish
tar.' 2 This being the oldest mention of Ishtar in Assyrian texts,
we are perhaps warranted in concluding that the cult of the goddess was transferred with the seat of government to Nineveh. This would not necessarily make Ishtar of Nineveh the oldest of the three, but accounts for the higher rank that was accorded
to her, as against the other two. Ishtar of Arbela and the
queen of Kidmuru do not make their appearance so far as the historical texts are concerned till the time of Esarhaddon (68 1,
B.C.) a comparatively late date. Tiele 3 suggests that Arbela became the seat of a school of prophets in the service of Ishtar. The curious name of the place, the *
four-god
'
city, certainly speaks in favor of supposing Arbela to have been a great religious center, but until excavations shall have been conducted on
the modern site of the town, the problems connected with the
worship of Ishtar of Arbela cannot be solved. It is quite pos
sible, if not probable, that the three Ishtars are each of inde
pendent origin. The f queen of Kidmuru/ indeed, I venture to think, is the indigenous Ishtar of Nineveh, who is obliged to yield her place to the so-called *
Assyrian Ishtar ' upon the transfer of the capitol of Assyria to Nineveh, and henceforth
is known by one of her epithets to distinguish her from her formidable rival. The cult of Ishtar at Arbela is probably, too,
of ancient date ; but special circumstances that escape us appear
1 More precisely Arba-ilu, signifying '
city of the fourfold divinity ' or ' four-god ' city. Cf. the Palestinian form Kiryath-Arba, "four city," originally perhaps, likewise, a city of four gods, rather than four roads or four quarters, as commonly explained. 2 IR. 14, 1. 86. 3 Babyl.-Assyr. Geschichte, p. 85.



204 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
to have led to a revival of interest in their cults during the
period when Assyria reached the zenith of her power. The im
portant point for us to bear in mind is that no essential distinc.
tions between these three Ishtars were made by the Assyrians.
Their traits and epithets are similar, and for all practical purposes we have only one Ishtar in the northern empire. Next to Ashur, or rather by the side of Ashur, Ishtar was invoked
as the great goddess of battle and war. This trait, however, was not given to her by the Assyrians. Hammurabi views the
goddess in this light,
1 and in the Izdubar or Gilgamesh epic,
as already pointed out, she appears at times in the role of a violent destroyer. The warlike phase of the goddess's nature is
largely accentuated in the Assyrian pantheon and dwelt upon to the exclusion of that softer and milder side which we have
seen characterized her as ' the mother of mankind.' Her role
as the goddess of war grows in prominence as the Assyrian rulers proceed in their triumphal careers. Ashurrishishi (c.
1150 B.C.) invokes her simply as the superior goddess, but for Tiglathpileser I. and from his days on, she is primarily the lady of war, who arranges the order of battle and encourages her
favorites to fight. She appears in dreams at critical moments, and whispers words of cheer to King Ashurbanabal. When
danger threatens, it is. to her that the great king spreads his hands in prayer. She is not merely the goddess of the
kings, but of the people as well.- The latter are instructed to
honor her. No deity approaches her in splendor. As Ashur rules the Igigi, so Ishtar is declared to be '
mighty over the Anunnaki.' Her commands are not to be opposed. Her
appearance is that of a being clothed with fiery flames, and streams of fire are sent down by her upon the enemies of
Ashurbanabal a description that expresses admirably the conception formed by the Assyrians of a genuine goddess of war. Like Ashur, she is given a supreme rank among the
1 See above, p. 83.



THE ASSYRIAN PANTHEON. 205
gods. Shalmaneser II. calls her the first-born of heaven and
earth, and for Tiglathpileser L, she is the first among the gods. Her milder attributes as the gracious mother of creation, the
giver of plenty, and the hearer of the supplications of the sinner,
so prominent in the religious literature, 1 are not dwelt upon in the historical texts. Still, an element of love also enters into
the relationship with her subjects. Ashurnasirbal (885-860 B.C.) speaks of her as the lady who ' loves him and his priesthood.' Sennacherib similarly associates Ishtar with Ashur as the lover
of his priesthood. As a goddess of war she is of course *
perfect in courage,' as Shalmaneser II. declares. Temples are erected to her in the city of Ashur, in Nineveh and Arbela. Ashur
banabal distinguishes carefully between the two Ishtars, the one of Nineveh and the one of Arbela; and, strange enough, while terming Nineveh the favorite city of Ishtar, he seems to
give the preference to Ishtar of Arbela. It is to the latter 2 that when hard pressed by the Elamites he addresses his prayer, call
ing her 'the lady of Arbela' ; and it is this Ishtar who appears
to the royal troops in a dream. The month of Ab the
fifth month of the Babylonian calendar is sacred to Ishtar.
Ashurbanabal proceeds to Arbela for the purpose of worship
ping her during this sacred period. Something must have occurred during his reign, to bring the goddess of Arbela into such remarkable prominence, but even Ashurbanabal does not
go so far as to place Ishtar of Arbela before Ishtar of Nineveh,
when enumerating the gods of the pantheon. One point still remains to be mentioned before passing on. Ashurbanabal
calls Ishtar he is speaking of Ishtar of Nineveh the wife
of Bel.3 Now Ishtar never appears in this capacity in the Baby
1 See above, pp. 83, 84. 2 Cylinder B, col. v. 11. 30 scq. ; elsewhere (Rassam Cylinder, col. ii. 11. 115 scy.) he prays to Ashur and Ishtar. 3 Rassam Cylinder, col. viii. 1. 92. Elsewhere, Cylinder B, col. v. 17, Ishtar is called the daughter of Bel. This, however, must be an error; either Sin must be read
for Bel, or kh'trat (consort) for marat (daughter).



206 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
Ionian inscriptions. If there is one goddess with whom she
has nothing in common, it is Belit of Nippur. To account for this curious statement on the part of the Assyrian scribes,
it is only necessary to bear in mind that the name Belit signifies
'
lady,' and Ishtar is constantly spoken of as the Belit or lady of battle. Much the same train of thought that led to regarding Bel in the sense of *
lord,' merely as a title of Marduk, gave rise to the use of '
Belit,' as the title of the great
*
lady
' of the
Assyrian pantheon. 1 From this it is but a small but of course
erroneous step, to speak of Belit-Ishtar as the consort of Bel.
Whether the error is due only to the scribe, or whether it actu
ally made its way into the Assyrian system of theology, it is difficult to say. Probably the former; for the distinguishing feature of both the Babylonian and the Assyrian Ishtar is her
independent position. Though at times brought into close association with Ashur, she is not regarded as the mere consort
of any god no mere reflection of a male deity, but ruling in
her own right on a perfect par with the great gods of the pantheon. She is coequal in rank and dignity with Ashur. Her name becomes synonymous for goddess, as Marduk becomes the synonym for god. The female deities both native and
foreign come to be regarded as so many forms of Ishtar. In a certain sense Ishtar is the only real goddess of the later
Assyrian pantheon, the only one taking an active part in the religious and political life of the people. At the same time it is to be noted that by the side of the Assyrian Ishtar, the
Babylonian Ishtar, especially the one associated with Erech (or Warka) is also worshipped by the monarchs of the north. Esarhaddon devotes himself to the improvement of the old
temple at Erech, and Ashurbanabal prides himself upon having rescued out of the hands of the Elamites a statue of Ishtar or
Nana of Erech that had been captured 1635 vears previous. 2
1 See above, p. 151.
2 See Barton, " The Semitic Ishtar Cult" (Hebratca, x. 9-12).



THE ASSYRIAN PANTHEON. 207
ANU.
Reference has already been rmkje to the antiquity of the Anu cult in Assyria, and that prior to theTime that the city of Ashur
assumes the role of mistress of the northern states, Anu stood
at the head of the pantheon, just as theoretically he continued
to occupy this place in the pantheon of the south. What is
especially important, he had a temple in the very city of Ashur, whose patron god succeeded in usurping the place of the old
' god of heaven.' The character of Anu in the north differs in
no way from the traits assigned to him in the south. He is
the king of the Igigi and Anunnaki, that is, of all the heavenly and earthly spirits, and he is this by virtue of being the supreme god of heaven. His cult, however, appears to have suffered
through the overshadowing supremacy of Ashur. Even in his old temple at Ashur, which Tiglathpileser I. on the occasion of
his rebuilding it, tells us was founded 641 years before this
restoration, 1 he is no longer accorded sole homage. Ramman, the god of thunder and of storms, because correlated to Anu,
is placed by the side of the latter and permitted to share the honors with Anu. 2 Anu survives in the Assyrian as in the Baby
lonian pantheon by virtue of being a member of the theological
triad, composed as we have seen of Anu, Bel, and Ea. Tiglath
pileser I. still invokes Anu as a deity of practical importance. He associates him with Ramman and Ishtar as the great gods
of the city of Ashur or with Ramman alone, but beyond an
incidental mention by Ashurnasirbal, who in a long list of gods
at the beginning of his annals emphasizes the fact of his being
the favorite of Anu, he appears only in combination with Bel
and Ea. The same degree of reverence, however, was shown to the old triad in Assyria as in Babylonia. The three gods
are asked not to listen to the prayers of the one who destroys
1 /.<?., c. 1800 B.C. 2 See p. 154.



208 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
the monuments set up by the kings. Sargon tells us that it is Anu, Bel, and Ea who fix the names of the months, 1 and this same king when he comes to assign names to the eight gates of
his great palace, does not forget to include Anu in the list of
deities, 2 describing him as the god who blesses his handiwork.
DAGAN.
Coequal in antiquity with the cult of Anu in Assyria is that
of Dagan. Although occurring in Babylonia as early as the days of Hammurabi, and indeed earlier, 3 it would appear that his worship was imported from the north into the south.4 At
all events, it is in the north that the cult of Dagan rises to
prominence. The name of the god appears as an element in the name of Ishme-Dagan (the father of Samsi-Ramman II.),
5
whose date may be fixed at the close of the nineteenth century
B.C. The form Dagan is interesting as being almost identical
with the name of the chief god of the Philistines, Dagon, 6 who is mentioned in the Book of Judges. The resemblance can hardly be entirely accidental. From other sources we know
that Dagan was worhipped in Palestine as early as the four
teenth or fifteenth century, and the form Dagan, if derived from Dag, contains an afformative element which stamps the
word as non-Assyrian. The proposition has much in its favor which regards Dagan as a god whose worship was introduced
into Assyria at a very early period through the influence of Aramaean hordes, who continue throughout Assyrian history to skirt the eastern shores of the Tigris. Once introduced,
however, into Assyria, Dagan assumes a different form from
1 See above, p. 149. 2 See below, p. 237.
3 A king of Nippur (c. 2500 B.C.) bears the name Ishme-Dagan. 4 See above, p. 154 ; Tiele, Geschichte der Religion ini AltcrtJntni, \. 172. 5 See Hommel, Geschichte, p. 490. How much earlier Samsi-Ramman I. reigned is not known perhaps only 40 or 50 years. 6 The o of Dagon would be represented by d in cuneiform writing.



THE ASSYRIAN PANTHEON. 209
the one that he receives among the Philistines. To the latter
he is the god of agriculture, while in Assyria he rises to the
rank of second in the pantheon, and becomes the associate of
Anu. The latter's dominion being the heavens, Dagan is con
ceived as the god of earth. Hence, there results the fusion
with the Babylonian Bel, which has already been noted, 1 and it is due to this fusion that Dagan disappears almost entirely
from the Assyrian pantheon. Ashurnasirbal invokes Dagan
with Anu. Two centuries later, Sargon, whose scribes, as
Jensen has noticed, manifest an *
archaeological
' fondness for
the earlier deities, repeats the phrase of Ashurnasirbal, and also calls his subjects 'troops of Anu and Dagan'; but it is important to observe that he does not include Dagan among
the deities in whose honor he assigns names to the gates of
his palace. We may, therefore, fix upon the ninth century as the terminus for the Dagan cult in Assyria. Proper names
compounded with Dagan do not occur after the days of Ashurnasirbal. 2
SHAMASH.
Besides the testimony furnished by the name of the king,
Samsi-Ramman, we have a proof for the antiquity of the Shamash cult in Assyria in the express statement of Pudilu
(c. 1350 B.C.) that he built a temple to the sun-god in the city of Ashur. He calls Shamash the '
protecting deity,' but the protection vouchsafed by Shamash is to be understood in a peculiar sense. Shamash does not work by caprice. He is, as
we have seen, preeminently a god of justice, whose favors are bestowed in accordance with unchangeable principles. So far
as Assyria is concerned, the conceptions regarding Shamash reach a higher ethical level than those connected with any other
deity. Ashur and Ishtar are partial to Assyria, and uphold
iSeep. 154. 2 An eponym in his days bears the name Daganbelusur.



210 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
her rulers at any cost, but the favors of Shamash are bestowed
upon the kings because of their righteousness, or, what is the same thing, because of their claim to being righteous. For Tiglathpileser I., great and ruthless warrior as he is, Shamash is the judge of heaven and earth, who sees the wickedness of
the king's enemies, and shatters them because of their guilt.
When the king mercifully sets certain captives free, it is in the presence of Shamash that he performs this act. It is, there
fore, as the advocate of the righteous cause that Tiglathpileser claims to have received the glorious sceptre at the hands of
Shamash ; and so also for the successors of Tiglathpileser,
down to the days of Sargon, Shamash is above all and first of all the judge, both of men and of the gods. There is, of
course, nothing new in this view of Shamash, which is pre
cisely, the one developed in Babylonia; but in Assyria, perhaps for the reason that in Shamash is concentrated almost all
of the ethical instinct of the northern people, the judicial traits
of Shamash appear to be even more strongly emphasized. Especially in the days of Ashurnasirbal and Shalmaneser II.
-the ninth century does the sun-cult receive great prominence. These kings call themselves the sun of the world. The
phrase, 1 indeed, has so distinctly an Egyptian flavor, that, in
connection with other considerations, it seems quite plausible to assume that the influence of Egyptian reverence for Ra had
much to do with the popularity of the sun-cult about this time. Shalmaneser bestows numerous epithets upon Shamash. He
is the guide of everything, the messenger of the gods, the hero, the judge of the world who guides mankind aright, and, what is most significant, the lord of law. The word used for law, tertu, is identical with the Hebrew term tora that is used to
designate the Pentateuchal legislation. No better testimony could be desired to show the nature of the conceptions that
1 In the El-Amarna tablets (c. 1400 B.C.) the governors of the Palestinean states generally address their Egyptian lord as ' my sun.'



THE ASSYRIAN PANTHEON. 211
must have been current of Shamash. Sargon, again, who is
fond of emphasizing the just principles that inspire his acts, goes to the length of building a sanctuary 1 for Shamash far beyond the northern limits of Assyria. But the kings, in thus
placing themselves under the protection of the great judge, were not oblivious to the fact that this protection was particularly
desired on the battlefield. War being uppermost in their thoughts, the other side of Shamash's nature his power and violence was not overlooked. Tiglathpileser invokes him
also as the warrior, a title that is often given to Shamash in
the religious literature. There can be little doubt that a nation
of warriors whose chief deities were gods of war, was attracted
to Shamash not merely because he was the judge of all things,
but also, and in a large degree, because he possessed some of the traits that distinguished Ashur and Ishtar.
RAMMAN.
The association of Ramman with Shamash in the name of
the old ruler of Assyria, Samsi-Ramman, is not accidental or
due to mere caprice. Only such deities are combined in proper names that are, or may be, correlated to one another.
Ramman, as the god of storms, is naturally viewed as a power
complementary to the great orb of light.
2 The two in combination, viewed as the beneficent and the destructive power, con
stitute the most powerful elements of nature, whose good will
it was most important, especially for a nation of warriors, to secure. Some such thought surely underlies this association of Shamash with Ramman. The Assyrian Ramman differs in no way from the Ramman of Babylonia, but he is much more popular in the north than in the south. The popularity of the
god is but a reflection of the delight that the Assyrians took
1 Exactly of what nature we do not know. The Assyrian word used, Cylinder, 1. 43, is obscure. 2 See p. 1 60.



212 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
in military pursuits. Ramman is hardly anything more than another Ashur. Tiglathpileser I., who once calls the god
Mar-tu, i.e., "the West god," l has left us an admirable description of him. He is the hero who floods the lands and houses
of the country's enemies. The approach of the Assyrian troops is compared to an onslaught of Ramman. His curses are the most dreadful that can befall a nation or an individual,
for his instruments of destruction are lightning, hunger, and death. Reference has several times been made to the manner
in which Tiglathpileser honors Ramman by making him a partner of Anu in the great temple of the latter at Ashur. But the
successors of Tiglathpileser are no less zealous in their rever
ence for Ramman. It is to Ramman that the kings offer
sacrifices during the campaign, and when they wish to depict in the strongest terms the destruction that follows in the wake
of an onslaught of the Assyrian troops,* they declare that they swept over everything like Ramman. It is natural, in view of this, that Ramman should have been to the Assyrians also the
'
mightiest of the gods.' 2 Through the Assyrian inscriptions we learn something of the consort of Ramman.
SHALA.
Sennacherib tells us that in the course of his campaign
against Babylonia he removes out of the city of Babylon, and replaces in Ekallate 8 the statues of Ramman and Shala. This,
he says, he did 418 years after the time that they had been carried captive from Ekallate to Babylon by Marduknadinakhi. 4
We know nothing more of this Ekallate except that it lay in
Assyria, probably in the southern half, and that Ramman
1 IR.8, col. i. 85. See above, p. 166. 2 Ashurnasirbal calls him so in his annals, e.g., col. iii. 1. 130.
3 Bavian Inscription, 11. 48-50. See also Meissner-Rost, Baiiinschriften Sanherib 's, p. 102. The reading of the name of the city is not certain. It signifies
'
city of palaces,' * c. 1120 B.C.



/'//A' ASSYRIAN PANTHEON. 213
and Shala are called the gods of the city. The name ' Shala '
appears to signify
' woman.' It reminds us, therefore, of '
lady
'
(Ninni, Nana, etc.), which we have found to be the designation for several distinct goddesses. It is possible that Shala,
likewise, being a name of so indefinite a character, was applied
to other goddesses. A * Shala of the mountains,' who is stated
to be the wife of Marduk, is mentioned in a list of gods. 1 The
wife of Bel, too, is once called Shala, though in this case the confusion between Marduk and Bel may have led to transferring the name from the consort of one to the consort of the
other. Too much importance must not be attached to the
data furnished by these lists of gods. They represent in
many cases purely arbitrary attempts to systematize the Babylonian and Assyrian pantheon, and in other cases are valuable
only as reflecting the views of the theologians, or rather of
certain schools of theological thought, in Babylonia. In. the religious hymns, too, the consort of Ramman finds mention, and by a play upon her name is described as the f merciful
one.' The attribute given to her there is the '
lady of the
field,' which puts her in contrast to Ramman, rather than in
partnership with him. Since we hear little of her worship in
Assyria, beyond the notices of Sennacherib, we may conclude that, like so many goddesses, Shala dwindled to the insignificant proportions of a mere pale reflection of the male deity.
NlN-IB.
Another god, who by virtue of his violent traits enjoys the
favor of the Assyrian rulers, is the old Babylonian deity whose name is provisionally read Nin-ib. In the very first mention of
him, in the inscription of Ashurrishishi (c. 1150 B.C.), he is called the '
mighty one of the gods.' Through the protection of Nin-ib, Ashurrishishi secures victory over his enemies on
l II Rawlinson, 57, 33.



214 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
all sides. Similarly, other of the Assyrian rulers emphasize the strength of Nin-ib. Tiglathpileser I. calls him the courageous one, whose special function is the destruction of the king's
enemies. In doing so he becomes the god ' who fulfills the heart's desire.' The unmistakable character of the god as a god of war is also shown by his association with Ashur. 1 If
Ashur is the king of Igigi and Anunnaki, Nin-ib is the hero of
the heavenly and earthly spirits. To him the rulers fly for help. Of all the kings, Ashurnasirbal seems to have been
especially devoted to the service of Nin-ib. The annals of
this king, instead of beginning, as is customary, with an invo
cation of all or many of the gods, starts out with an address to
Nin-ib, in which the king fairly exhausts the vocabulary of the language in his desire to secure the favor of this powerful
deity. Almost all the attributes he assigns to him have refer
ence to the god's powers in war. Dwelling in the capital Calah, he is * the strong, the mighty, the supreme one,' the perfect hero, who is invincible in battle, the '
destroyer of all opposition, who holds the lock of heaven and earth, who opens
the deep ; the strong one, endowed with youthful vigor, whose decree is unchangeable, without whom no decision is made in
heaven or on earth, whose attack is like a flood, who sweeps
away the land of his enemies,' and so forth, through a bewilder
ing array of epithets. The inscriptions of the Assyrian kings,
especially in the introductions, manifest little originality. One
king, or rather his scribe, frequently copies from earlier productions, or imitates them. Hence, it happens that the grandson of Ashurnasirbal, Shamshi-Ramman (c. 825-812 B.C.), furnishes us with an almost equally long array of epithets, exalting the strength and terror of Nin-ib. Like Ashurnasirbal, he declared himself to have been chosen by this god to
occupy the throne. A comparison of the two lists makes it evident that the later one is modeled upon the earlier produc
1 So Tiglathpileser associates Ashur and Nin-ib. as those ' who fulfill his desire.'



THE ASSYRIAN PANTHEON. 215
tion. The conclusion is justified that in the century covered
by the reigns of Ashurnasirbal l and Shamshi-Ramman, the
cult of Nin-ib must have acquired great popularity, though
suffering, perhaps, an interruption during the reign of Shalmaneser II., midway between these two kings, whose favorite we have seen was Shamash. The great temple of Nin-ib stood in Calah, which Ashurnasirbal chose as his
official residence, and it was in this temple that the king
deposited a long inscription commemorating his deeds. In the temple, he also places a colossal statue of the god. Upon
the completion of the edifice, he dedicates it with prayer and
sacrifices. The special festivals of the god are fixed for the
months of Shabat and Ulul, the eleventh and sixth months,
and provision is made for the regular maintenance of the
cult. It must, of course, not be supposed that, because Nin-ib appears to be a favorite of the king, the latter concentrates his
attentions upon this god. He appears to have been specially
fond of temple building, and, besides the one to Nin-ib, he tells
us of sanctuaries to ' Belit of the land,' />., Ishtar,2 Sin, Gula,
Ea, and Ramman, that he erects or improves. One might be
led to regard it as strange that a god like Nin-ib, or Shamash, should claim so large a share of the attention of the Assyrian
rulers, to the apparent neglect of Ashur, but it must be borne in mind that the position of Ashur was so assured as to be
beyond the reach of rivalry. The fact also that Ashur's popular symbol was the movable standard was no doubt a reason why so few temples were erected to him. He did not stand in need of temples. For the very reason that Ashur was the
universally acknowledged master of everything, the kings felt called upon to choose, by the side of Ashur, some additional
deity, a patron under whose special protection they placed themselves. The natural desire for novelty together with
1 AshurnasirbaPs father bears the name Tukulti-Ninib. 2 See above, pp. 151, 206.



216 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
other circumstances that escape us led one to choose Ram
man, another Nin-ib, a third Shamash, and a fourth, as we shall see, Nabu. In doing so they were not conscious of any
lack of respect towards Ashur, of whose. good will they always felt certain.
Besides the service rendered by Nin-ib in war, his aid was
also invoked by the kings in their recreations, which partook of the same violent character as their vocation. Their favorite
sport was hunting, especially of lions, wild horses, elephants, stags, boars, and bulls. They either proceeded to districts where these animals were to be found, or they had large parks laid out near their residences, which were then stocked with material for the chase. Ashurnasirbal does not shun a long
journey to distant mountainous regions to seek for sport, and
it is Nin-ib whom he invokes, together with Nergal. These
two, he declares, who, like Ashur and Ishtar, " love his priesthood," are the ones that convey into his hands the hunting
spoils. Tiglathpileser I. was especially fond of lion and elephant hunting. He declares that on one occasion he killed
10 elephants and 920 lions in various parts of northwestern
Mesopotamia ; and he ascribes his success to Nin-ib, who
loves him, and who, again, in association with Nergal, and
Ashur, has placed in the king's hands the mighty weapons and the glorious bow. After the days of Shamshi-Ramman we hear of Nin-ib chiefly in the formal lists of gods which the later
kings of Assyria, from Sargon 1 on, are fond of placing at the beginning and end of their inscriptions. These lists, again, copied the one from the other, are of value only as indicating the chief gods of the pantheon, but warrant no conclusions
as to the activity reigning in the cults of the gods there mentioned. Before leaving Nin-ib a few words need be said as to
his relations to the other gods. In the chapter on the pantheon
before Hammurabi, 2 the identity of Nin-ib with the chief god
1 One of the gates of Sargon's palace is called after Nin-ib. 2 See above, p. 57.



THE ASSYRIAN PANTHEON. 217
of Gudea's district, Nin-girsu, has been pointed out. The solar character of the latter being clear, it follows that Nin-ib,
too, is originally a personification of the sun, like Nin-gish-zida and Nin-shakh, whose roles are absorbed by Nin-ib. 1 This
has long been recognized, but it is the merit of Jensen 2 to have demonstrated that it is the east sun and the morning sun
which is more especially represented by Nin-ib. On this supposition, some of the titles given to him in the inscriptions of Ashurnasirbal and Shamshi-Ramman become perfectly clear.
Like Marduk, who, it will be remembered, is also originally a phase of the solar deity, Nin-ib is called the first-born of Ea ;
and as the rising sun he is appropriately called the offspring of Ekur, i.e., the earth, in allusion to his apparent ascent from a place below the earth. Ekur and Eshara being em
ployed as synonyms, Shamshi-Ramman replaces Ekur by Eshara, and since Bel is the lord of Ekur-Eshara, Nin-ib also
becomes the first-born son of Bel. Other epithets, such as ' the light of heaven and earth,'
' the one who pursues his path
over the wide world,' 3 are all in keeping with the solar char
acter of the deity, and date, therefore, from a period when the
more purely
' nature ' phases of the god were dwelt upon.
But just as in the case of Shamash and Nergal (also, as we
have seen, a solar deity), so in that of Nin-ib, the violent, fiery, and destructive character that the sun has in a climate
like that of Babylonia brought it about that Nin-ib was viewed
as a destructive force, whose assistance was of great value in
military strife. He becomes the god of the cloud storm, before
whom, as he passes along, heaven and earth tremble. By his
strong weapon he humiliates the disobedient, destroys the enemies of the kings, and grants all manner of protection to his
favorites. Only in the religious literature are other qualities
1 See above, pp. 92-94. 2 Kosmologie, pp. 457-475. 3 He is also called the offspring of a goddess, Ku-tu-shar, but this reference is not clear. See Jensen, Kosmologie, p. 468, note 5.



218 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
dwelt upon, such as his ' holiness.' l For Hammurabi, it will
be recalled, Nin-ib is already the god of war, and it is natural
that in a country like Assyria this side of the god's nature
should become accentuated to the point of obscuring all
others, until nothing more is left of his solar character than is
indicated by stray bits of mythological phrases, perhaps only half understood, and introduced to add to the imposing array
of epithets that belong to the terrible god of war. As the
consort of Nin-ib, the Assyrians recognized
GULA.
She is only occasionally invoked by the Assyrian rulers. A sanctuary to Gula, as the consort of Nin-ib, is erected by Ashur
nasirbal, and a festival in honor of the goddess is referred to by Ashurbanabal.
NERGAL.
Nergal not only shares with Nin-ib, as already mentioned, the honor of being the god under whose auspices the royal chase is carried on, but he is also, like Nin-ib, invoked in that
other sport of which the Assyrian rulers were so fond, war.
He is scarcely differentiated from Nin-ib. Like the latter he is the perfect king of battle, who marches before the monarch
together with Ashur, and he is pictured as carrying the mighty weapons which Ashur has presented to the king. In an
inscription of Shalmaneser II. 2 there is an interesting reference to the city sacred to Nergal Cuthah. The king, who
in the course of his campaign against Babylonia reaches Cuthah, brings sacrifices to Nergal, whom he speaks of as ' the
hero of the gods, the supreme raging sun.' A later king, Sargon, also honors the god by giving a fortress in the distant land of Nairi, to the northeast of Assyria, the name of Kar 3
1 In a religious text he is addressed as *
holy, holy, holy.'
2 Balawat, col. v. 11. 4, 5. 3 Kar = fortress.



THE ASSYRIAN PANTHEON. 219
Nergal. It would seem as though, through the influence of
Sargon, a revival of the Nergal cult took place. His successor, Sennacherib, erects a temple in honor of the god at Tarbisu, a suburb to the north of Nineveh proper, and Ashurbanabal,
who dwells at Tarbisu for a while, is engaged in adding to the
beauty of the edifice, an indication of the honor in which the
god continued to be held. Nergal's consort is Laz, but she is
not referred to by the Assyrian rulers.
SIN.
, The old Babylonian moon-god plays a comparatively insignificant role in Assyria. Ashurnasirbal speaks of a temple that he
founded in Calah perhaps only a chapel in honor of Sin. It could not have been of much importance, for we learn noth
ing further about it. Sargon, too, who manifests a great fond
ness for reviving ancient cults, erects sanctuaries to Sin along
with a quantity of other gods in his official residence at Khor
sabad and beyond the northeastern confines of Assyria at Magganubba. But when invoked by the kings, Sin shows traces of the influence which the conceptions current about
Ashur exerted upon his fellow deities. He takes on, as other
of the gods, the attributes of the war-god. Instead of being
merely the lord of the crescent, as in Babylonia, and one of the sources of wisdom because of the connection of astrology
with lunar observations, he is pictured as capable of inspiring terror. At the same time he is also the lord of plenty, and
in his capacity as the wise god he is regarded as the lord of
decisions. But by the side of new epithets that are attached
to him in the Assyrian inscriptions, there is one which, just as in the case of Nin-ib, connects the Assyrian Sin cult with the
oldest phase of moon- worship in the south. It is one of the
last kings of Assyria, Ashurbanabal, who calls Sin 'the first
born son of Bel.' He appears in this relationship to Bel in the



220 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
religious texts of Babylonia. The Bel here meant can only be
the great god of Nippur, and the title ' son of Bel '
accordingly shows that the moon-worship of Assyria is ultimately derived from that which had its seat in the south. Sin's secondary
position is indicated by making him a son of Bel. The rise
of the science of astronomy in connection with astrology,
was, as already suggested, an important factor in spreading and maintaining the Sin cult in the south, while the lack of
intellectual originality in Assyria would equally account for the
comparatively subordinate position occupied by Sin in the
Assyrian pantheon.
NUSKU.
That Nusku is a Babylonian god, meriting a place in the pantheon of Hammurabi, if not of the days prior to the union of the Babylonian states, is shown by the fact (i) that he had a
shrine in the great temple of Marduk at Babylon, along with
Nebo, Tashmitum, and Ea ;
l and (2) that he appears in the
religious texts. In view of this it might appear strange that we find no reference to the god in historical texts till we reach the
Assyrian period. The reason, or at least one reason, is that Nusku is on the one hand amalgamated with Gibil, the fire-god, and on the* other identified with Nabu. The compound ideogram with which his name is written includes the same sign
the stylus or sceptre that is used to designate Nabu, the second part of the ideogram adding the idea of 'force and strength.' Whether this graphical assimilation is to be regarded as a fac
tor in bringing about the identification of Nusku and Nabu, or
is due to an original similarity in the traits of the two gods, it
is difficult to say. Hardly the latter, for Nusku is a solar
deity, whereas, as we have tried to show, Nabu is originally a water-deity. 2 But however we may choose to account for it,
1 See Sayce, Hibbert Lectures, p. 438, and Jensen's important note, Kosmologie, pp. 492-494- 2 See pp. 124, 125.



THE ASSYRIAN PANTHEON. 221
the prominence of Nusku is obscured by Nabu. As a solar
deity, it is easy to see how he should have been regarded as a
phase of the fire-god, and if the various other solar deities were
not so regarded, it is because in the course of their development they were clothed with other attributes that, while obscur
ing their origin, saved them from the loss of their identity.
Apart from the formal lists of gods drawn up by Sargon and his successors, Shalmaneser II. and Ashurbanabal are the only kings who make special mention of Nusku. The former calls
him the bearer of the brilliant sceptre, just as Nabu is so
called; and again, just as Nabu, he is termed the wise god. The two phases of the ideogram used in his name the sceptre and the stylus are thus united in the personage of Nusku precisely as in Nabu. On the other hand, the manner in
which Ashurbanabal speaks of him reflects the mythological
aspect of Nusku. In the religious literature Nusku is the
messenger of Bel-Marduk, who conveys the message of the latter to Ea.. From being the messenger of Bel, he comes to be viewed as the messenger of the gods in general, and accordingly Ashurbanabal addresses him as ' the highly honored
messenger of the gods,' but, combining with the mythological the more realistic aspect of Nusku, refers to him also as the
one who glorifies sovereignty and who, at the command of Ashur and Belit, stands at the king's side to aid in bringing' the ene
mies to fall. As for the fire-god Gibil, with whom Nusku is identified, we have merely a reference to a month of the year sacred to the servant of Gibil in a passage of the inscriptions
of Sargon. 1
BEL-MARDUK.
From the time that the Assyrian rulers claimed a greater or
small measure of control over the affairs of Babylonia, that is,
therefore, from about the twelfth century, they were anxious to
1 Cylinder, 1. 61.



222 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
make good their claim by including in their pantheon the chief
god of Babylonia. The Assyrian inscriptions prove that, as early as the twelfth century, the theoretical absorption on the
part of Marduk, of the role taken by the old god Bel of Nippur,
which was enlarged upon in a preceding chapter, 1 had already taken place. Marduk is not only frequently known as Bel, but
what is more, Babylonia is the country of Bel, or simply Bel, and the Babylonians are referred to as 'the subjects of Bel,' or the *
humanity of Bel.' There can be no doubt that in all these cases Bel-Marduk is meant and not the older Bel. In the days of Ashurrishishi we already come across the title *
governor of Bel,' that to the latest days remains the official designation for
political control over the southern empire. So general is this
use of Bel for Marduk that the latter name does not occur until we reach Shalmaneser II., i.e., the ninth century. There seems
to be no reason to question, therefore, that even when Tiglath
pileser I. applies to Bel titles that certainly belong to the older Bel, such as 'father of the gods,' 'king of all the Anunnaki,' ' who. fixes the decrees of heaven and earth,' he means Marduk,
a proof for which may be seen in the epithet bel matati,
' lord of
lands,' which follows upon these designations and which, as we saw, is a factor in the evolution of Marduk into Bel-Marduk. 2
The importance that Tiglathpileser I., and therefore also his successors, attached to their control over the old southern dis
trict, is shown by his according to Bel the second place in the
pantheon, invoking him at the beginning of his inscriptions immediately after Ashur. The control over Babylonia was an
achievement that stirred the pride of the Assyrian rulers to the
highest degree. Its age and its past inspired respect. Besides being the source of the culture that Assyria possessed, Babylonia had sacred associations for the Assyrians, as the original
1 See pp. 117 seq.
2 We may therefore expect, some day, to come across the name Marduk in Assyrian texts earlier than the ninth century.



THE ASSYRIAN PANTHEON. 223
dwelling-places of most of the gods worshipped by them. The old sacred centers like Ur, Nippur, Uruk, Sippar, with their
great temples, their elaborate cults, their great storehouses of
religious literature, and their great body of influential priests
and theologians and astrologers were as dear to the people of the north as to those of the south ; and in proportion as
these old cities lost their political importance, their rank as sacred centers to which pilgrimages were made on the occasion
of the festivals of the gods was correspondingly raised. Hence
the value that the Assyrian rulers attached to the possession of
Babylonia. They do not like to be reminded that they rule the
south by force of arms. They prefer, as Tiglathpileser I. declares, to consider themselves ' nominated by the gods to rule
over the land of Bel.' They want to be regarded as the favor
ites of Bel, and they ascribe to him the greatness of their rule.
It is he who fulfills the wishes of the kings; and when the kings
enter upon a campaign against Babylonia, as they frequently did to quell the uprisings that were constantly occurring in the one or the other of the southern districts, they emphasize, as Shalmaneser II. does, that he enters upon this course at the command of Marduk. They set themselves up as Marduk's
defenders, and it must be said for the Assyrian rulers that they were mild and sparing in their treatment of their southern sub
jects. They do not practise those cruelties burning of cities,
pillage, and promiscuous slaughter that form the main feature in their campaigns against the nations to the northeast and
northwest, and against Elam. They accord to the Babylonians as much of the old independence as was consistent with an impe
rial policy. The internal affairs continue for a long time to be
regulated by rulers who are natives of Babylonia, and it is not
until a comparatively late day the time of Sennacherib that in consequence of the endless trouble that these native
rulers gave the Assyrians through their constant attempt to make themselves independent, it became customary for the



224 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
Assyrian kings to appoint a member of the royal house a son or brother to the lieutenancy over Babylonia. As for the
cult, the Assyrian kings were at great pains to leave it undisturbed, or where it had been interrupted to restore it, and thus secure the favor of the southern gods. So Shalmaneser II.
upon the completion of his campaign enters Marduk's great temple at Babylon, E-sagila, and offers prayers and sacrifices to Bel and Belit, i.e., Marduk and Sarpanitum. From E-sagila he crosses over to Borsippa, and pays homage to Nabu and to
Nabu's consort, whom he calls Nana. 1 The kings are fond,
especially when speaking of the Babylonian campaigns, of slipping in the name of Marduk after that of Ashur. With the
help of Ashur and Marduk their troops are victorious. Marduk
shares Ashur s terrible majesty. At times Shamash, or Shamash and Ramman, are added to form a little pantheon whose
assistance is invoked in the Babylonian wars. From being
used in restricted application to Babylonian affairs, Ashur and Marduk came to be invoked in a general way. Esarhaddon ex
pressly sets up the claim of being the savior of Marduk's honor,
as a kind of apology for proceeding against Babylonia with his armies. Sargon, to emphasize his legitimate control over Babylonia as well as Assyria, says that he has been called to the throne by Ashur and Marduk, but Ashurbanabal goes further
even than his .predecessors. He proceeds to Babylon on the occasion of the formal installation of his brother Shamashshum
ukin as viceroy of the district, enters the temple of Marduk, whom he does not hesitate to call 'the lord of lords,' performs
the customary rites, and closes the ceremonies by a fervent
prayer to Marduk for his continued good will and blessing. 2
The great gods Nergal, Nabu, and Shamash come from their respective shrines to do homage to Marduk. Ashurbanabal's
1 See p. 132. 2 So also Shalmaneser II., Obelisk, 1. 179, unless Marduk here is an error for
Ramman, cf. \. 175.



THE ASSYRIAN PANTPIEON. 225
brother Shamashshumukin, when he attempts as governor of Babylon to make himself independent of his brother, endeavors by means of sacrifices and other devices to secure the favor of
Marduk, well aware that in this way he will also gain the sup
port of the Babylonians. On another occasion, incidental to a northern campaign, Ashurbanabal mentions that the day on which he broke up camp at Damascus was the festival of Mar
duk, an indication that the Babylonian god was in his thoughts, even when he himself was far away from Babylonia. Esarhad
don and Ashurbanabal, when approaching the sun-god to obtain an oracle, make mention of Marduk by the side of Shamash.
There are, however, a number of passages in the Assyrian inscriptions in which when Bel is spoken of, not Marduk but the old god Bel is meant.
BEL.
Tiglathpileser I. tells us that he rebuilt a temple to Bel in
the city of Ashur, and he qualifies the name of the god by adding the word ' old ' to it. In this way he evidently distin
guished the god of Nippur from Bel-Marduk, similarly as Hammurabi in one place adds Dagan to Bel, 1 to make it perfectly
clear what god he meant. Again, it is Sargon who in consist
ent accord with his fondness for displaying his archaeological
tastes, introduces Bel, the 'great mountain, 'the- lord of coun
tries,' who dwells in E-khar-sag-kurkura, i.e., the sacred moun
tain on which the gods are born, as participating in the fes
tival that takes place upon the dedication of the king's palace
in Khorsabad. The titles used by the king are applicable only to the old Bel, but whether he or his scribes were fully conscious
of a differentiation between Bel and Bel-Marduk, it is difficult
to say. Bel is introduced in the inscription in question 2 imme
diately after Ashur, and one is therefore inclined to suspect
1 See above, p. 146. 2 The so-called Prunkinschrift, 11. 174 seq.



226 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
that Sargon's archaeological knowledge fails him at this point in speaking of the old Bel, whereas he really meant to invoke
the protection of Bel-Marduk as the chief god of his most im
portant possession next to Assyria. 1 Besides this, the old Bel is of course meant, when associated with Anu, as the powers
that, together with Belit, grant victory,
2 or as a member of the old triad, Anu, Bel, and Ea, whose mention we have seen is as
characteristic of the Assyrian inscriptions as of the Babylonian. Lastly, Sargon calls one of the gates of his palace after Bel, whom he designates as the one who lays the foundation of all
things. In this case, too, the old Bel is meant.
BELIT.
In the case of Belit a curious species of confusion confronts
us in the Assyrian inscriptions. At times Belit appears as the wife of Bel, again as the consort of Ashur, again as the consort
of Ea, and again simply as a designation of Ishtar. 3 To account for this we must bear in mind, as has already been
pointed out, that just as Bel in the sense of lord came to be
applied merely as a title of the chief god of Babylonia, so Belit
as f
lady
' was used in Assyria to designate the chief goddess. This was, as the case may be, either Ishtar or the pale
* reflec
tion' associated with Ashur as his consort. Now this Belit, as
the wife of Ashur, absorbs the qualities that distinguish Belit, the wife of Bel-Marduk. The temple in the city of Ashur, which
Tiglathpileser 1. 4 enriches with presents consisting of the images of the deities vanquished by the king, may in reality have been
sacred to the Belit of Babylonia, but Tiglathpileser, for whom
Bel becomes merely a designation of Marduk, does not feel
called upon to pay his devotions to the Babylonian Sarpanitum,
1 Note the frequent use of Ashur and Bel for Assyria and Babylonia. 2 Ashurbanabal, Rassam Cylinder, col. ix. 11. 76, 77. 3 See above, p. 205. 4 lR.ii.col.iv.il. 34, 35.



THE ASSYRIAN PANTHEON. 227
and so converts the old Belit into * the lofty wife, beloved of
Ashur.' Sargon, on the other hand, who calls one of the gates
of his palace Belit Hani,
' mistress of the gods,' seems to mean by
this, the consort of Ea. 1
Similarly, Ashurbanabal regards Belit as the wife of Ashur, and himself as the offspring of Ashur and
Belit. At the same time he gives to this Belit the title of
1 mother of great gods,' which of right belongs to the consort
of the Babylonian Bel. In the full pantheon as enumerated by
him, Belit occupies a place immediately behind her consort Ashur. Ashurbanabal, however, goes still further, and, influenced by the title of ' Belit ' as applied to Ishtar, makes the latter the consort of Ashur. This at least is the case in an
inscription from the temple of Belit at Nineveh,2 known as Emash-mash, and in which Ashurbanabal alternately addresses
the goddess as Belit and as Ishtar, while elsewhere 3 this same
Belit, whose seat is in E-mash-mash, is termed the consort of Ashur. How Ashurbanabal or his scribes came to this con
fusing identification we need not stop to inquire. In part, no
doubt, it was due to the general sense of 'goddess,' which
Ishtar began to acquire in his days. 4 At all events, Ashur
banabaPs conception marks a contrast to the procedure of Shalmaneser II., who correctly identifies the mother of the great gods with the wife of Bel.5 On the other hand, the confusion that took place in Ashurbanabal's days is fore
shadowed by the title of ' Belit mati,' i.e.,
' mistress of the land,' by which Ashurbanabal appears to designate some other than
Ishtar.6 Lastly, it is interesting to note that Ashurbanabal
recognizes' by the side of Belit-Ishtar, the wife of Ashur, the older Belit, the wife of the Bel of Nippur, to whom, in associa

tion with Anu and Bel, he attributes his victory over the Arabs. 1
SARPANITUM.
The consort of Marduk is only incidentally referred to:
once by Sargon,2 who groups Bel with Sarpanitum and Nabu and Tashmitum, at the head of the gods of Babylonia ; and
similarly by Tiglathpileser III., on the occasion of his enumer
ating the chief gods of the Babylonian pantheon.
NABU.
The intimate association of Nabu with Marduk in the city of
Babylon leads as a natural consequence to a similar associa
tion in Assyria, when once the Marduk cult had for political reasons become established in the north. The kings invoke
the favor of Bel (meaning Marduk) and Nabu, especially when dealing with the affairs of Babylonia, 3 as they invoke Ashur
and Ishtar. Just as we have certain kings devoted to Nin-ib
and Shamash by the side of Ashur, so there are others whose
special favorite is Nabu. In the days of Ramman-nirari III.
(812-783 B.C.) the Nabu cult reached its highest point of popularity in Assyria. From the manner in which the king speaks of the god, one might draw the conclusion that he attempted to concentrate the whole Assyrian cult upon that god alone. He erects a temple to the god at Calah, and overwhelms the deity
with a great array of titles. The dedicatory inscription which the king places on a statue of Nebo closes with the significant
words, 'O Posterity! trust in Nabu. Trust in no other god.' 4 Still we must not press such phrases too hard. Ramman-nirari
III. had no intention of suppressing Ashur worship, for he

THE ASSYRIAN PANTHEON. 229
mentions the god elsewhere, and assigns to him the same rank as the other kings do, but so much we are justified in concluding, that next to Ashur and Ishtar he feels most strongly
attached to Nabu. That the Babylonian Nabu is meant, is clear
from such designations as ' the offspring of E-sagila, the favorite of Bel,' 'he who dwells at E-zida,' which appear among the
epithets bestowed upon the god ; and the temple in Calah, which
one of the last kings of Assyria, Ashuretililani, 1 is engaged in
improving, bears the same name E-zida, as Nabu's great temple
at Borsippa. We have already set forth the reasons 2 for the
popularity of the Nabu cult in Assyria. Suffice it to recall that
the peculiar character of the god as the patron of wisdom placed
him beyond the reach of any jealousy on the part of the other members of the pantheon. So Ramman-nirari III. extols Nabu
as the protector of the arts, the all-wise who guides the stylus of
the scribe, and the possessor of wisdom in general. He is not
merely the originator of writing, but the source of all wisdom, and for this reason he is spoken of as the son of Ea. Attri
butes of mere brutal force are rarely assigned to Nabu, but as
befits a god of wisdom, mercy, nobility, and majesty constitute his chief attractions. By virtue of his wisdom, Sargon calls
him ' the clear seer who guides all the gods,' and when the last
king of Assyria Saracus, as the Greek writers called him invokes Nabu as the * leader of forces,' he appears to have in
mind the heavenly troops rather than earthly armies. Such
patrons of learning as Sargon and Ashurbanabal were naturally fond of parading their devotion to Nabu. The former signifi
cantly calls him the ' writer of everything,' and as for Ashur
banabal, almost every tablet in the great literary collection that he made at Nineveh closes with a solemn invocation to Nabu and his consort Tashmitum, to whom he offers thanks for hav
ing opened his ears to receive wisdom, and who persuaded him
1 IR. 8, no. 3, 11. 5 seq. 2 See above, p. 126.



230 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
to make the vast literary treasures of the past accessible to his
subjects.
TASHMITUM.
The consort of Nabu was permitted to share the honors in
the temple of Nabu at Calah, but beyond this and Ashurbanabal's constant association of Tashmitum with Nabu in the
subscript to his tablets, she appears only when the kings of Assyria coming to Babylonia as they were wont to do, 1 in order to perform sacrifices, enumerate the chief gods of the Babylo
nian pantheon.
EA. .
Ea takes his place in the Assyrian pantheon in the double capacity of god of wisdom and as a member of the old triad. Ashurnasirbal makes mention of a sanctuary erected to the
honor of Ea in Ashur. A recollection of the role that Ea plays
in Babylonian mythology survives in the titles of ' creator ' and
*
king of the ocean,' which Shalmaneser gives him,2 and of the * one who opens the fountains ' as Ashurbanabal declares.3
He is also, as in Babylonia, the one who determines the fates of mankind. As the one who has a care for the arts, he is the
wise god, just as Nabu, and under various titles, as Nu-gim
mud, 4 Nin-igi-azag, and Igi-dug-gu, 5 all emphasizing his skill, he is the artificer who aids the kings in their building opera
tions. The similarity of the roles of Nabu and Ea, as gods of wisdom and the arts, might easily have led to a confusion.
1 E.g., Tiglathpileser III., Nimrud inscription (Layard, pi. 17, 1. 12). 2 Obelisk,!. 5. 3 Rassam Cylinder, col. i. 1. 45. 4 Delitzsch (Das Babylonische Weltschopfungsepos, p. 99) questions whether Nugim-mud (or Nu-dim-mud) was originally a designation of Ea. Nu-dim-mud being an epithet might, of course, be applied to other gods, but there can be no doubt that it was used to designate more particularly Ea as the artificer. See my remarks,
pp. 138, 177 seq. 5 Meissner-Rost, Bauinscriften SanheriVs, p. 105.



THE ASSYRIAN PANTHEON. 231
Fortunately, the grandiloquent and all-embracing titles accorded to the former did not alter his character as essentially the god
who presides over the art of writing, while Ea retains the con
trol over the architectural achievements, the great colossi, in
the first instance, that guarded the approach of palaces, the
images of the gods in the second, and the temples and palaces in general as his third function.
DAMKINA.
Of the consort of Ea, it is sufficient to note that she is occa
sionally referred to in the historical texts of the Assyrian
period. In the inscriptions of Sargon she appears under the rather strange title of 'Belit ilani,' /.*., the mistress of the gods. 1 This * mistress ' cannot 'be, as might at first blush appear,
Ishtar or the old Belit, for elsewhere 2 Ishtar, Belit, and Belit
ilani occur side by side. Sargon declares that he owes his
wisdom to Ea and Belit ilani. In naming the gates of his
palace, he again associates Ea with ' the mistress of the gods,'
from which it is clear that the epithet is used of Ea's consort.
NIN-GAL.
A sanctuary to the old Babylonian goddess Nin-gal is included by Sargon among the holy edifices erected by him in his official
residence. 3
DIBBARRA.
We have pointed out in a previous chapter how faint the dividing line sometimes becomes between gods and spirits.
Among the minor deities, ranking hardly above demons, is the
1 Cylinder, 1. 48, ideographically as Nin-men-an-na, ' lady of the heavenly crown.' In the parallel passage, however, as Lyon (Sargontexte, p. 71) points out, Belit ilani is used.
2 Cylinder, 1. 70. 3 Cylinder, 1. 68.



232 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
plague-god, whose name may provisionally be read Dibbarra. 1 The god plays a role in some of the ancient legends of Babylonia. Remains have been found of a kind of epic in which
Dibbarra is the chief personage. 2 In the historical texts he
is once incidentally mentioned by Ashurbanabal, who in the course of his campaign against Babylonia 3 describes how the
corpses of those killed by Dibbarra, />., through hunger and want, filled the streets of the cities. Evidently Dibbarra here is
a mere personification of the dreadful demon of want that so
often follows in the wake of a military destruction. Still there
can be no doubt that at one time .he was regarded as a real
deity, and not merely a spirit or demon. Dibbarra is identified
in the theological system of Babylonia with Nergal.
DAMKU, SHARRU-ILU, AND SHA-NIT(?)-KA.
In an interesting passage recounting the restoration of the
city Magganubba, Sargon 4 says that he prayed to Damku, i.e.,
'
grace,' Sharru-ilu, i.e.,
'
king-god,' and Sha-nit(?)-ka. The two former he calls the judges of mankind. That Damku and Sharru-ilu are titles and not names is evident from the mean
ing of the words, but at present it is impossible to say what gods are meant. 5 Perhaps that these are the translations of
names of the old deities of Magganubba. We have at least one
other example of a foreign deity introduced into the Assyrian pantheon. At Dur-ilu, a town lying near the Elamitic frontier, there flourished the cult of Ka-di, 6 evidently a god imported into the Assyrian pantheon from Elam or some other eastern
district. S argon's scribes are fond of translating foreign names

and words, and they may have done so in this case, and thus
added two new deities to the glorious pantheon protecting their
royal chief. As for Sha-nit(?)-ka,
1 were it not that she is
called the mistress of Nineveh, one would also put her down as
a foreign goddess. In view of this, however, it may be that
Sha-nit(?)-ka is a"n ideographic designation of Ishtar. Before leaving the subject, a word needs to be said regarding
the relation between the active Assyrian pantheon and the
long lists of deities prepared by the schoolmen of Babylonia and Assyria. Reference has already been made to these lists. 2 They vary in character. Some of them furnish an index of the
various names under which a god was known,3 or the titles
assigned to him. These names and titles are frequently indications that some great god has absorbed the attributes of
smaller ones, whose independence was in this way destroyed. Other lists 4 are simple enumerations of local deities, and when
to these names some indications are added, as to the locality
to which the gods belong, 5 their importance is correspondingly increased. There can be no doubt that most of these lists
were prepared on the basis of the occurrence of these gods in
texts, and it seems most plausible to conclude that the texts in
question were of a religious character. References to local
cults are numerous in the incantations which form a consider
able proportion of the religious literature, while in hymns and prayers, gods are often referred to by their titles instead of their
names. In some respects, however, these lists of gods are still
obscure. It is often difficult to determine whether we are deal
ing with gods or spirits, and the origin and meaning of many
of the names and epithets assigned to gods are similarly in

234 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
volved in doubt. Use has been made of tnese lists in deter
mining the character of the gods included in this survey of the
Babylonian and Assyrian pantheon, but it would be manifestly precarious to make additions to this pantheon on the basis of
the lists alone. Despite the tendency towards centralization
of divine power in a limited number of gods, local cults, no
doubt, continued to enjoy some importance in Assyria as well
as Babylonia ; but, in the present stage of our knowledge, we have no means of determining either the number or the char
acter of these local cults. While, therefore, a complete treat
ment of the pantheon of Babylonia and Assyria would include
all the minor local cults, we may feel quite certain that these
local cults furnish few, if any, additions to the concepts connected with these gods which we have discussed. I have
therefore contented myself with some illustrations, in each of the three divisions under which the pantheon has been surveyed,
of some of the minor deities chosen, such as actually occur in
historical, commercial, or religious texts. For the Assyrian pantheon, we may place Nin-gal and most of the consorts of the gods among the minor gods, and also such deities as
Ka-di, Khani, Gaga, Dibbarra, Sherua, and Azag-sir, who are merely incidentally referred to. 1 These illustrations suffice
for placing clearly before us the distinction to be made in the
pantheon between gods whose worship was actively carried on, and those who occupy more of a theoretical position in
the system perfected by the schoolmen, standing under the political and social influences of their days. With this dis
tinction clearly impressed upon us, we will be prepared for such modifications of our views of the Babylonian-Assyrian
pantheon as further researches and discoveries may render
necessary.

CHAPTER XIII.
THE TRIAD AND THE COMBINED INVOCATION OF DEITIES.
THE Assyrian kings, in imitation of the example set by their
Babylonian predecessors, are fond of introducing into their
inscriptions, a series of gods under whose protection they place themselves. They do not do this as the earlier Babylonian
rulers did, to emphasize the extent of their jurisdiction by add
ing to their pantheon the deities of towns or districts vanquished
by them. The day of independent states being over, the importance of merely local deities had ceased. The theological
system evolved in Babylonia in combination with the popular
instinct had led to a selection out of the mass of deities of a
limited number, each with tolerably definite attributes, and who together embraced all the forces under whose power mankind
stood. Of these deities again, as we have seen, some acquired
greater favor in Assyria than others, but for all that, the kings
especially of the later period of Assyrian history were fond of including in an enumeration of the pantheon, even those who
had no special significance. Policy and the meaningless imitation of earlier examples played an equal part in thus giving to the lists an aspect of formality that deprives them of the
impression that they might otherwise make. The combined invocations are found usually at the beginning
and at the end of the inscriptions at the beginning for invok
ing .the aid of the gods, at the close for invoking their curses upon those who would attempt to destroy the ambitious monu
ments set up by the kings. Often, however, the narrative is
interrupted for the purpose of making acknowledgment to a larger or smaller series of gods for victory, granted or hoped for.



236 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
In these combined references a separate place belongs to the
triad, Anu, Bel, and Ea. While not occupying the prominent
position they have in Babylonian inscriptions, still the kings often mention Anu, Bel, and Ea separately, or Anu and Bel
alone, ascribing victory to them, putting them down as the originators of the calendar system, and declaring themselves to have been nominated by them to rule over Assyria. Sargon,
with his antiquarian zeal, appears to have made an effort to reinstate the triad as a special group in the pantheon. In gen
eral, however, they take their place with other gods. So Ramman-nirari I. invokes the curse of Ashur, Anu, Bel, Ea, and Ishtar, together with the Igigi and Anunnaki ; but, what is more
important, already at an early period the triad disappears altogether from the pantheon, except for the artificial attempts of Sargon to revive interest in them. In both the longer and
shorter liSts of gods enumerated by the kings from the time of
Tiglathpileser, the triad is conspicuous for its absence. As for the other gods, it is to some extent a matter of caprice
which ones happen to be invoked, though just as frequently we see the motive for selecting certain ones of the pantheon. Thus,
when proceeding to Babylonia for war or sacrifices, the gods of Babylonia are invoked, either Marduk and Nabu alone,
as the chief gods, or Bel (*>., Marduk), Sarpanitum, Nabu, Tashmitum, Nana, Nergal, with Ashur, or Ashur and Marduk, or Marduk and Nabu in combination with Ashur. At other
times it depends upon the gods to whom certain kings may
be especially attached, or with whom they may have special
dealings in their inscriptions. Thus Tiglathpileser I., when speaking of the temple of Anu and Ramman, contents himself
with invoking these two gods alone at the close of his great
inscription. Elsewhere, when referring to the special gods of his city, he combines Anu and Ramman with Ishtar ; but
again, for no special reason, his prayer is addressed to Ashur, Shamash, and Ramman. The pantheon of Ramman-nirari I.



THE COMBINED INVOCATION OF DEITIES. 237
consists either of the longer one above enumerated, or of Anu,
Ashur, Shamash, Ramman, and Ishtar. As we proceed down the centuries, the formal lists at the beginning of inscriptions have a tendency to grow larger. Ashurnasirbal's pantheon con_ sists of. Bel and Nin-ib, Anu and Dagan, Sin, Anu, Ramman,
and, of course, Ashur, though on special occasions, as when speaking of his achievements in the chase, he contents himself
with a mention of Nin-ib and Nergal. He loves, too, to vary
the style of his inscriptions by naming various groups of deities in pairs: now Ashur and Shamash, again Ashur and Nin-ib, or Ashur and Bel ; then Shamash and Ramman, or a group of
three deities, Ashur, Shamash, and Ramman, or Sin, Anu, and Ramman. His successors imitate this example, though each one chooses his own combinations. Shalmaneser II. 's pan
theon embraces Ashur, Anu, Bel, Ea, Sin, Shamash, Nin-ib,
Nergal, Nusku, Belit, and Ishtar eleven in all. Sargon's practice varies. The best list is furnished by his account of
the eight gates of his palace and of two walls, which he names
after the gods in the following order :
l
Shamash, who grants victory. > As the names for the Ramman, who brings superabundance. > eastern gates. Bel, who lays foundations. ) ^
T, Vi , / . .. ... > For the northern gates.
Belit, who brings fertility. ) Anu, who blesses handiwork. ) For the western
Ishtar, who causes the inhabitants to flourish. > gates.
Ea, who unlocks fountains. >
D~ f/MA . . i re r For the southern gates.
Belit ilam,2 who increases the offspring. )
Ashur, who permits the king to grow old, and protects the troops. For the inner wall.
Nin-ib, who lays the foundations of the city. For the outer wall.
The order here is dictated by the directions of the gates.
Elsewhere he sets up the group Ea, Sin, Shamash, Nabu, Ramman, Nin-ib, and their consorts.
1 Cylinder, 11. 67-73. 2 Ea' s consort ; see above, p. 231.



238 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
Sennacherib's fuller group consists of Ashur, Sin, Shamash,
Bel (i.e., Marduk), Nabu, Nergal, Ishtar of Nineveh, and Ishtar of Arbela only eight. But at the close of one of his building
inscriptions l he invokes some twenty deities, adding to these
eight, Nusku, Khani, Gaga, Sherua, Nin-gal, a god Azag-sir, and Nin-ib under three different forms; but it is evident
that most of these are added to give effect and solemnity.
They do not form part of the active pantheon. His successor, Esarhaddon, sets up various groups. At one time he enumer
ates Ashur, Sin, Shamash, Nabu, Marduk, Ishtar of Nineveh, Ishtar of Arbela ; at another he prefers different combinations of these gods. Ashurbanabal is more consistent than most of the Assyrian rulers, and furnishes at the same time the best
list. While he, too, frequently mentions only a few deities,
grouping three or four together, his longer series consists, with
but one or two exceptions, invariably of the following, and who always occur in the same order: Ashur, Belit, Sin, Sham
ash, Ramman, Bel (?>., Marduk), Nabu, Ishtar of Nineveh, the queen of Kidmuru, Ishtar of Arbela, Nin-ib, Nergal, and Nusku thirteen in all. Of these, as we have seen, only
some were actively worshipped at all times in Assyria ; as for
the others, the popularity of their cult varied from age to age, now being actively carried on under the stimulus afforded by
the erection or improvement of an edifice sacred to the god,
and again falling into comparative insignificance ; but formally, at least, all these gods were regarded at all times as forming
part of the pantheon of the 'great gods.' The testimony of Ashurbanabal thus becomes valuable as a proof that to the
latest days of the Assyrian monarchy, the attachment to these
gods was still strong enough to merit the formal acknowledgments of the king to them on all occasions, and that through their combined aid the glorious achievements of the past and
present were attained.

CHAPTER XIV.
THE NEO-BABYLONIAN PERIOD.
WHEN upon the fall of the Assyrian empire, in 606 B.C.,
Babylonia regained her full measure of independence, Marduk once more obtained undisputed sway at the head of the pan
theon. True, so far as Babylonia was concerned, Marduk was
always the acknowledged head, but during the period that Assyria held Babylonia in a more or less rigid form of subjection it was inevitable that Ashur should lower the prestige of
Marduk. When the kings of Assyria paid their respects to Marduk, it was always as second in rank to Ashur ; and, what is more, they claimed Marduk and the other gods of Babylonia as
their own, and as upholders of their own sovereignty. When
the kings feel impelled to invade the southern 'districts, they not only claim to be under the protection of the Babylonian gods, but they carry these gods with them into the land to be
invaded. ' Bel and the gods of Akkad leave Assyria and go to
Babylonia ' is the official term in which a campaign against
Babylonia is described. 1 In the eyes of the Babylonians such a
haughty assumption on the part of the Assyrians must have been regarded as humiliating to Marduk, Nabu, and their associates. The state of affairs changed when Nebopolassar at the end of the seventh century once more claimed independent control over Babylonia. Marduk triumphs over Ashur. He is once
more the great god, lord of gods, supreme king of the Igigi, the father of the Anunnaki all titles that the Assyrians were
fond of heaping upon Ashur. One feels the anxiety of Nebo
1 Babylonian Chronicle B, col. iv. 11. 34, 35.



240 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
polassar to emphasize the new order of things by attributing once more to Marduk what was formerly claimed for Ashur.
The successor of Nebopolassar, the great Nebuchadnezzar, continues the policy of his father. He neglects no opportunity for exalting Marduk as the king, the creator, the leader of the gods, the lord of everything, the merciful one, the light of the gods, the all-wise. Nabu shares the honors with Marduk. Nebopolassar,
indeed, accords to Nabu an equal share, and he does not hesitate at times to place the name Nabu before that of Marduk. 1 He does not speak of Nabu as the son of Marduk, and seems to be
at particular pains to emphasize the equality of Nabu with Marduk. In this respect Nebopolassar presents a contrast to Hammurabi, who, it will be recalled, made an attempt to suppress the Nabu cult.2 Nebopolassar, however, does not go to the extent of endeavoring to make Nabu supersede Marduk. He contents himself with manifesting his partiality for the
former, and it is probably no accident that both his official name and that of his son contain the god Nabu as one of
their elements, and not Marduk. One is inclined to suspect
that this popularity of the Nabu cult is a trace of Assyrian
influence. But whatever may have been Nebopolassar's inten
tion in exalting Nabu at the cost of Marduk, Nebuchadnezzar restores the old relationship between the two. For him Nabu
is again merely the son of Marduk, and he honors Nabu in this
capacity. Like the Assyrian Nabu, the god places the sceptre in the king's hands, but he is, after all, only the supreme
messenger of Marduk. In the closing days of the Babylonian monarchy a more serious attempt, it would appear, was made to displace Marduk. Nabonnedos formed the design of replacing both Marduk and Nabu by the cult of Shamash. He incurs the ill-will of the priests by paying much more attention to the
restoration of the various Shamash temples in Babylonia than
1 Zeitschrift fiir Assyriologie, ii. 72, col. i. 11. 2, 3. 2 See above, p. 127.



THE NEO-BABYLONIAN PERIOD. 241
would appear to be consistent with devotion to Marduk. Cyrus,
therefore, in his conquest of Babylonia, sets up the claim of being the savior of Marduk's honor. 1
The Neo-Babylonian period may properly be designated as
a religious age. The rulers, anxious to manifest their gratitude
to the gods, and prompted in part, no doubt, by the desire to emulate the glorious architectural achievements of the Assyrian
monarchs, devote themselves assiduously to the improvement of the great temples of the city of Babylon, and to the restora
tion or enlargement of those scattered throughout the country. Nebopolassar sets the example in this respect, which is consid
erably improved upon by Nebuchadnezzar. Over forty temples and shrines are mentioned in the latter's inscriptions as having
been improved, enlarged, or restored by him ; and the last king
of Babylonia, Nabonnedos, endeavors to continue this royal
policy of temple-building. In this respect the Neo-Babylonian rulers present a contrast to the Assyrian rulers, who were much more concerned in rearing grand edifices for themselves. While the gods were not neglected in Assyria, one hears much
more of the magnificent palaces erected by the kings than of
temples and shrines. In fact, as compared with Babylonia, Assyria was poor in the number of her temples. The chief sanctuaries to which the Neo-Babylonian kings devoted them
selves were, in the first instance, E-sagila of Babylon and E-zida of Borsippa. Nebopolassar and his successors are
fond of giving themselves the title of ' beautifier of E-Sagila
and E-zida.' In these great temples sacred to Marduk and
Nebo, there were shrines to Sarpanitum, Tashmitum, Nusku,
and Ea, which also engaged the energies of the rulers.
After Babylon came the old sanctuaries in the ancient reli
gious centers of the south, the temples to Shamash and his consort at Sippar and Larsa, the temples to Sin at Ur and Har

242 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
ran, to the old Ishtar or Anunit at Agade, to Nana in Erech.
Thirdly, the cities of Babylon and Borsippa, to which the
kings, especially Nebuchadnezzar, are deeply attached, were enriched with many sanctuaries more or less imposing, sacred
to a variety of deities. So Shamash, Sin, Nin-makh, i.e., the
great lady, or Ishtar, Nin-khar-shag, Gula, also appearing as Nin-Karrak, 1 have their temples in Babylon, while Ramman has one in Borsippa, and Gula no less than three sanctuaries
perhaps only small chapels in Borsippa. Fourthly, there are sanctuaries of minor importance in other quarters of Baby
lonia. Among these we find mention of the improvement of sanctuaries to the local deity of Marad, whom Nebuchadnezzar
simply calls Lugal-Marad a, z>., king of Marad, to Bel-sarbi, or Shar-sarbi, in Baz, perhaps a title of Nergal, to Nin-ib in
Dilbat, to Ramman in Kumari(?). Most of these sanctuaries are referred to in the inscriptions of Nebuchadnezzar a circumstance which, in connection with the many other gods whom he invokes on various occasions,
points to a great revival of ancient cults in his days. Some of
these cults had never reached any degree of importance prior
to his time. Hence it happens that we come across deities in
his inscriptions of whom no mention is found elsewhere. It is
probable that such gods were purely local deities, some of them, if not many, being at the same time personifications of the powers or phenomena of nature, while others may be familiar gods,
masquerading under strange attributes. Unfortunately most of these gods are written in ideographic fashion, so that we cannot be certain of the reading of their names. Among these are
Nin-lil-anna, a goddess called by Nebuchadnezzar * the lady who loves me,' 2 and Tur-lil-en, 3 a god who is described as

great physician,' the epithet peculiar to Gula. 2 East India House Inscription, col. iv. 1. 44. 3 VR. 34, col. ii. 1. 26, or simply Tur-lil (East India House Inscription, col. iv. 1. 49, not Tur-e, as Winckler, Keils Bibl. 3, 2, 18, reads).

'breaking the weapons of enemies.' As for Bel-sarbi, or Shar
sarbi, the god of Baz, 1 they appear to be titles rather than, names. Dibbarra, Nergal and his consort Laz, and Zamama are also included in the pantheon of Nebuchadnezzar.
In regard to none of these deities do we find any conceptions
different from those developed in the period of Hammurabi,
any more than in the conceptions of those gods who occupy a
more prominent place in the pantheon. Shamash is the judge, Sin is the wise one, Ramman the thunderer, and so on throughout the list. It was not a period favorable to the production of
new religious thought, but only to the more or less artificial
revival of old cults.
With the conquest of Babylonia by Cyrus in 539 B.C., we reach the close of the period to be embraced in a history of the
'Babylonian-Assyrian religion. True, the Marduk and Nabu cults were upheld by the Persian rulers, and the policy of the
latter in not disturbing the religious status was continued by the Greeks when they in turn succeeded the Persians in their
control of Babylonia, but the presence of strange civilizations
with totally different religious trains of thought was bound to affect the character of the old faith, and in time to threaten its
existence. At all events, it ceases to have any interest for us.
There are no further lines of development upon which it enters.
The period of decay, of slow but sure decay, has set in. The cuneiform writing continues to be used till almost the begin
ning of our era, and so the religious cults draw out their
existence to a late period ; but as the writing and the civiliza
tion yield before new forces that entirely alter the character
of Oriental culture, so also the religion, after sinking ever

lower into the bogs of superstition, disappears, much as the canals and little streams of the Euphrates valley, through
the neglect which settled over the country, become lost in the
death-breeding swamps and marshes.



CHAPTER XV.
THE RELIGIOUS LITERATURE OF BABYLONIA.
THE pantheon of a religion presents us with the external phases of the religion in question. In order to penetrate further towards the core of the religion, and to see it at its
best, the religious thought as manifested in the national litera
ture constitutes our most valuable guide. The beginnings of
Babylonian literature are enveloped in obscurity. We have seen that we are justified in passing beyond the period of Hammurabi 1 for these beginnings, but exactly when and pre
cisely how the literary spirit first manifested itself in Babylonia will probably remain for a long time, if not for always, a matter
of conjecture. The great political and religious centers of Babylonia, such as Ur, Sippar, Agade, Eridu, Nippur, Uruk, perhaps also Lagash, and later on Babylon, formed the foci of
literary activity, as they were the starting-points of commercial enterprise. This intimate connection of religion with literature
left its impress upon all branches into which the Babylonian
literature was in the course of time differentiated. In a certain
sense all the literature of Babylonia is religious. Even the
legal formulas, as embodied in the so-called contract tablets,
have a religious tinge. The priests being the scribes, a contract of any kind between two or more parties was a religious
compact. The oath which accompanied the compact involved an invocation of the gods. The decree of the judges in a dis
puted suit was confirmed by an appeal to the gods. The terms
in which the parties bound themselves consisted largely of
religious phrases, and finally the dating of the tablet often contained a reference to some religious festival or to some event
1 See above, pp. 72, 114, 133 seq.



246 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
of religious import such as the building of a sanctuary. Science, so far as it existed in Babylonia, never loosened the
leading-strings that bound it to the prevailing religious thought. The observation of the stars was carried on under the belief of
the supposed influence exerted by the heavenly bodies upon
the fate of man; and surprising as we find the development of astronomical calculations and forecasts to be, mathematics does
not pass beyond the limits of astrology. Medicine was likewise the concern of the priests. Disease was a divine infliction
supposed to be due to the direct presence in the body, or to
the hidden influence, of some pernicious spirit. The cure was effected by the exorcising of the troublesome spirit through
prescribed formulas of supposed power, accompanied by symbolical acts. There is indeed no branch of human knowledge
which so persistently retains its connection with religious beliefs
among all peoples of antiquity as the one which to-day is regarded as resting solely upon a materialistic basis. As a
consequence the Babylonians, although they made some progress in medicinal methods, and more especially in medical diagnosis, never dissociated medicinal remedies from the appeal
to the gods. The recital of formulas was supposed to secure
by their magic force the effectiveness of the medical potions
that were offered to the sufferer.
As for the historical texts, the preceding chapters have illus
trated how full they are of religious allusions, how at every turn we meet with the influence exerted by the priests as the
composers of these texts. Almost all occurrences are given a
religious coloring. That these texts furnish us with such valu
able material, and such a quantity of it, is indeed to be traced
directly to the fact that the historical literature is also the direct
production of the religious leaders and guides of the people, acting at the command of rulers, who were desirous of empha
sizing their dependence upon the gods of the country, and who made this dependence the basis of the authority they exerted.



THE RELIGIOUS LITERATURE OF BABYLONIA. 247
Such being the general aspect of Babylonian literature, it is not always possible to draw a sharp line separating religious productions from such as may properly be termed secular. For
example, the zodiacal system of the Babylonians, which we shall have occasion to discuss, although presenting a scientific
aspect, is in reality an outcome of the religious thought ; and
so at other points it is necessary to pass over into the region of
secular thought for illustrations of the religious beliefs. Bear
ing this in mind, we may set up a fivefold division of the
religious literature of the Babylonians in the stricter sense : (i)
the magical texts, (2) the hymns and prayers, (3) omens and
forecasts, (4) the cosmology, (5) epics and legends. It will be apparent that the first three divisions represent a practical part of the literature, while the two latter are of a more purely
literary character. The magical texts, as well as the hymns and prayers and omens, we can well imagine were produced as circumstances called them forth, and one can also understand
how they should, at an early age, have been committed to writing. The incantations serving the practical purpose already referred to of securing a control over the spirit, it will be readily seen that such as had demonstrated their effectiveness would be
come popular. The desire would arise to preserve them for
future generations. With that natural tendency of loose custom to become fixed law, these incantations would come to be
permanently associated with certain temples. Rituals would thus arise. The incantation would be committed to writing so
that one generation of priests might be certain of furnishing orthodox instruction to the other ; and, once written, they would
form part of the temple archives, finding a place in these archives by the side of the contract tablets, for which the sacred edifices
of the country also served as depositories. The large quantity of incantation texts that have been found in Ashurbanabal's
library,
1 as well as the variations and contrasts they present

248 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
when compared with one another, are probably due to the various sources whence the scribes of the king, who were sent
to the libraries of the south, collected their material. It is
only reasonable to suppose that each great temple acquired in the course of time a ritual of its own, which, while perhaps not
differing in any essential points from that introduced in another
place, yet deviated from it sufficiently to impart to it a character of its own. In the case of some of the texts that have
been preserved, it is still possible to determine through certain
traits that they exhibit in what religious center they were produced. With considerable more guarantee of accuracy can this be done in the case of the hymns and prayers. Addressed
as the latter were to certain deities, it stands to reason that
they were written for use in the temples sacred to those deities,
or, if not to be used, at least composed in honor of certain
sanctuaries that contained the images of the deities thus exalted.
Again, in the historical inscriptions of the Assyrian and Neo
Babylonian periods, prayers are introduced, and we are as a general thing expressly told on what occasion they were com
posed and in what sanctuary they were uttered. We may therefore conclude that those which have been preserved inde
pendently also served a practical purpose, and were written, not
merely for certain occasions, but for certain places. The practical purpose served by texts containing omens and forecasts derived from the observation of the planets and stars, from monstrosities human and animal from strange occurrences, accidents, and the like, is too obvious to require demonstration.
But while duly emphasizing the practical purpose that gave rise to the incantation texts, the hymns, the prayers and omens, we must be careful not to press this point too far. The
rituals of the various temples once being fixed, the impulse
to literary composition would still go on in an age marked by intellectual activity. The practical purpose would be followed by the pure love of composition. The attachment to certain



THE RELIGIOUS LITERATURE OF BABYLONIA. 249
sanctuaries or certain deities would inspire earnest and gifted
priests to further efforts. Accordingly, while we cannot be certain that among the actual remains of magical texts and
hymns we may not have specimens that belong to this class, there is no reason to question that such must have been pro
duced. The guarantee for this, hypothesis is furnished by the
compositions that reflect the cosmological beliefs, the epics and legends that form the second half of the religious produc
tions of Babylonia. Speculation regarding the origin of the universe belongs to an early period in the development of culture. There are few
people, however primitive their culture, who are not attracted by the spirit of curiosity to seek for some solution of the mys
teries which they daily witness; but the systematization of these speculations does not take place until a body of men arises
among a people capable of giving to the popular fancies a logical sequence, or the approach at least to a rational interpretation. This process, which resulted in producing in Babylonia
compositions that unfold a system of creation, is one of long duration. It proceeds under the influence of the intellectual movements that manifest themselves from time to time with the
attendant result that, as the conceptions become more definite
and more elaborate, they reflect more accurately the aspirations of the various generations engaged in bringing these conceptions to their final form. When finally these beliefs and specu
lations are committed to writing, it is done in part for the
purpose of assuring them a greater degree of permanence, and in part to establish more definitely the doctrines developed in
the schools to define, as it were, the norm of theological and
philosophical thought. In examining, therefore, the cosmological speculations of the Babylonians as they appear in the literary productions, we must
carefully distinguish between those portions which are the productions of popular fancy, and therefore old, and those parts



250 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
which give evidence of having been worked out in the schools.
In a general way, also, we must distinguish between the con
tents and the form given to the speculations in question. We shall see in due time that a certain amount of historical tradi
tion, however dimmed, has entered into the views evolved in
Babylonia regarding the origin of things, inasmuch as the science of origins included for the Babylonians the beginning, not merely of gods, men, animals, and plants, but also of cities and of civilization in general. Still more pronounced is the his
torical spirit in the case of the epics and legends that here, as
everywhere else, grew to even larger proportions, and were modified even after they were finally committed to writing. The great heroes of the past do not perish from the memory of a people, nor does the recollection of great events entirely
pass away. In proportion as the traditions of the past become dimmed, the more easily do they lend themselves to a blending
with popular myths regarding the phenomena of nature. To this
material popularly produced, a literary shape would be given through the same medium that remodeled the popular cosmo
logical speculations. The task would have a more purely
literary aspect than that of systematizing the current views regarding the origin and order of things, since it would be free
from any doctrinal tendency. The chief motive that would
prompt the literati to thus collect the stories of favorite heroes
and the traditions and the legends of the past would be
in addition, perhaps, to the pure pleasure of composition the desire to preserve the stories for future generations, while a minor factor that may have entered into consideration would be
the pedagogical one of adding to the material for study that
might engage the attention and thoughts of the young aspirants to sacred and secular lore. While the ultimate aim of learning
in Babylonia remained for all times a practical one, namely, the ability to act as a scribe or to serve in the cult, to render
judicial decisions or to observe the movements of the stars, to



THE RELIGIOUS LITERATURE OF BABYLONIA. 251
interpret the signs of nature and the like, it was inevitable that
through the intellectual activity thus evoked there would arise
a spirit of a love of learning for learning's sake, and at all
events a fondness for literary pursuits independent of any
purely practical purposes served by such pursuits. In this way we may account for the rise of the several
divisions of the religious literature of Babylonia. Before turn
ing to a detailed exposition of each of these divisions, it only remains to emphasize the minor part taken in all these literary
labors by the Assyrians. The traditions embodied in the cos
mological productions, the epics and legends of Babylonia, are no doubt as much the property of the Assyrians as of their
southern cousins, just as the conceptions underlying the incantation texts and the hymns and prayers and omens, though produced in the south, are on the whole identical with those current in the north. Whatever differences we have discovered between
the phases of the Babylonian-Assyrian religion, as manifested in the north and in the south, are not of a character to affect the
questions and views involved in the religious literature. The
stamp given to the literary products in this field, taken as a
whole, is distinctly Babylonian. It is the spirit of the south that breathes through almost all the religious texts that have as yet been discovered. Only in some of the prayers and oracles
and omens that are inserted in the historical inscriptions of Assy
rian kings, or have been transmitted independently, do we recog
nize the work of Assyrian literati, imbued with a spirit peculiar
to Assyria. Perhaps, too, in the final shape given to the tales connected with the creation of the gods and of men we may
detect an Assyrian influence on Babylonian thought, some con
cession made at a period of Assyrian supremacy to certain
religious conceptions peculiar to the north. But such influences are of an indirect character, and we may accept the statement
of Ashurbanabal as literally true that the literature collected by
him is a copy of what was found in the great literary archives



252 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
of the south and not only found, but produced there. In
imitation of the example set by the south, schools were of a
certainty established in Nineveh, Arbela, and elsewhere for the
education of priests, scribes, and judges; but we have no evidence to show that they ever developed to the point of becom
ing intellectually independent of Babylonian models, except perhaps in minor particulars that need not enter into our cal
culations. This relationship between the intellectual life of
Babylonia and Assyria finds its illustration and proof, not
merely in the religious literature, but in the religious art and cult which, as we shall see, like the literature, bear the distinct
impress of their southern origin, though modified in passing from the south to the north.



CHAPTER XVI.
THE MAGICAL TEXTS.
TURNING to the first subdivision of Babylonian religious literature, we find remains sufficient to justify us in concluding that there must have been produced a vast number of texts con
taining formulas and directions for securing a control over the spirits which were supposed at all times to be able to exercise
a certain amount of power over men. By virtue of the aim
served by these productions we may group them under the head
of magical texts, or incantations. We .have already indicated the manner in which these incantations grew into more or less
rigid temple rituals. This growth accounts for the fact that
the incantations generally framed in by ceremonial directions, prayers, and reflections, were combined into a continuous
series (or volume, as we would say) of varying length, covering nine, ten, a dozen, twenty tablets or more. It has been generally assumed that these incantation texts constitute the oldest
division of the religious literature of the Babylonians. The
assertion in an unqualified form is hardly accurate, for the incantation texts, such as they lie before us, give evidence of having been submitted to the influences of an age much later than the one in which their substance was produced. Concep
tions have been carried into them that were originally absent,
and a form given to them that obliges us to distinguish between the underlying concepts, and the manner in which these concepts have been combined with views that reflect a later and, in many respects, a more advanced period. The incantation
texts are certainly no older than texts furnishing omens. Some
of the incantation texts indeed may not be any older than por
tions of the creation epic, and in the latter, as in other parts of



254 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
the religious literature, there are elements as ancient and as
primitive as anything to be found in the omens or incantations.
So much, however, is true, that the incantations represent the earliest ritual proper to the Babylonian cult, and that the con
ceptions underlying this ritual are the emanation of popular
thought, or, if you choose, of popular fancy of a most primitive character. It is also true that, on the whole, the incantation
texts retain more traces of primitive popular thought than other
divisions of the religious literature with the exception of the
omens. The remodeling to which they were subjected did not
destroy their original character to the extent that might have
been expected a circumstance due in the first instance to
the persistency of the beliefs that called these texts forth.
Many of the texts containing incantations were found by the
modern explorers in so mutilated a condition, that one can
hardly hazard any generalizations as to the system followed in putting the incantations together. From the fact, however, that in so many instances the incantations form a series of longer
or shorter extent, we may, for the present at least, conclude that the serial form was the method generally followed ; and at all
events, if not the general method, certainly a favorite one. Deviating from the ordinary custom of calling the series according to the opening line of the first tablet, the incantation
texts were given a distinct title, which was either descriptive or chosen with reference to their general contents. So one series
which covered at least sixteen tablets was known by the very natural name of the ' evil demon '; the incantations that it con
tained being intended as a protection against various classes of demons. Another is known as the series of ' head sickness,' and which deals, though not exclusively, with various forms of
derangements having their seat in the brain. It covered no less than nine tablets. Two others bear names that
are almost synonymous, " Shurpu " and " Maklu," both signifying 'burning,' and so called from the chief topic dealt



THE MAGICAL TEXTS. 255
with in them, the burning of images of the sorcerers, and the incantations to be recited in connection with this symbolical
act. The " Maklu " series embraced eight tablets and con
tained, according to Tallqvist's calculations, 1
originally about
1550 lines, or upwards of 9000 words. The " Shurpu " series, although embracing nine tablets, appears to have been somewhat shorter. In view of the extensive character of these
series we are justified in speaking of incantation ' rituals.' The
texts were evidently prepared with a practical purpose in view. The efficacy of certain formulas having been demonstrated, it was obviously of importance that their exact form should be
preserved for future reference. But a given formula was effec
tive only for a given case, or at most for certain correlated
cases, and accordingly it became necessary to collect as many
formulas as possible to cover all emergencies. The priests, acting as exercisers, would be the ones interested in making
such collections, and we may assume, as already suggested, that each temple would develop a collection of its own, an
incantation code that served as a guide for its priests. The
natural tendency would be for these codes to increase from
generation to generation, perhaps not rapidly, but steadily. New cases not as yet provided for would arise, and new formulas with new instructions would be produced; or the exercisers
at a certain temple would learn of remedies tried elsewhere,
and would embody them in their own special code. In short, the growth of these incantation ' rituals ' was probably similar
to the manner in which, on the basis of actual practice, religious codes grew up around the sanctuaries of ancient Israel, a
process that terminated in the production of the various codes and rituals constituting the legal documents embodied in the Pentateuch.
The prominence given to Ea and to his favorite seat, the city of Eridu, in the incantations suggests the theory that many
1 Die Assyrische Beschworungsserie, Maqlii, p. 14.



256 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
of our texts are to be ultimately traced to the temple of Ea,
that once stood at Eridu. In that case an additional proof
would be furnished of the great antiquity of the use of incanta
tions in Babylonia. We must sharply distinguish however, as already emphasized, between the origin and the present form of the rituals. Again, those parts of a ritual in which Gibil, or
Nusku, appears prominently would most naturally be produced by priests connected with a temple sacred to the one or the
other of these gods. The practice of incantation, however,
being common to all parts of Babylonia, we can hardly suppose that any temple should have existed which did not have its exorcising formulas. In the combination of these formulas into a ritual, due consideration would naturally be had to the
special gods invoked, the obvious result of which would be to produce the long lists of deities that are often embodied in a
single incantation. The details of this process can of course no longer be discerned, but the inevitable tendency would be
towards increasing complications. The effort would be made
to collect everything, and from all known quarters. Hence the heterogeneous elements to be detected in the texts, and which,
while adding to their interest, also increase the difficulty of
their interpretation. In consequence of the presence of such heterogeneous elements, it is difficult to determine within an
incantation series any guiding principles that prompted the
collectors. Still we can often distinguish large groups in a
series that belong together. So we have whole series of
addresses to the fire-god ending with incantations, and again a
series of descriptions of the group of seven spirits serving a similar purpose as introductions to incantations, but we cannot see on what grounds the transition from one subject to the
other takes place. Indeed the transitions are generally marked
by their abruptness. The only legitimate inference is that the main purpose of the
collectors of incantation texts was to exhaust the subject so far



THE MAGICAL TEXTS. 257
as lay in their power. They included in their codes as much
as possible. The exerciser would have no difficulty in threading his way through the complicated mass. He would select the division appropriate to the case before him without much con
cern of what preceded or followed in the text. Moreover, these
divisions in the texts were clearly marked by dividing lines,
still to be seen on the clay tablets. These divisions corre
spond so completely to divisions in the subject-matter that the purely practical purpose they served can hardly be called into question, while at the same time they furnish additional proof
for the compiled character of the texts.
As for the date of the composition of the texts, the union of
the Babylonian states under Hammurabi, with its necessary
result, the supremacy of Marduk, that finds its reflection in the
texts, furnishes us with a terminus a quo beyond which we need
not proceed for ihejinat editing. On the other hand, there are indications in the language which warrant us in not passing
below 2000 B.C. as the period when many of the incantation
texts received their present form, and the editions were com
pleted from which many centuries afterwards the Assyrian
scribes prepared their copies for their royal masters.
There is, of course, no reason for assuming that all our texts
should be of one age, or that the copying and, in part, the edit
ing should not have gone on continually. Necessity for further copies would arise with the steady growth of the temples. Priests
would be engaged in making copies for themselves, either for their edification as a pious work, or for real use; and accordingly,
in fixing upon any date for the texts, one can hardly do more than assign certain broad limits within which the texts, so far as their
present contents are concerned, may have been completed. The copies themselves may of course belong to a much later period
without, for that reason, being more recent productions. Attention must also be directed to the so-called 'bilingual
'
form, in which many of the incantation texts are edited; each



258 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
line being first written in the ideographic style, and then fol
lowed by a transliteration into the phonetic style.
1 The use of
the ideographic style is a survival of the ancient period when all texts were written in this manner, and the conservatism
attaching to all things religious accounts for the continuation
of the ideographic style in the religious rituals down to the
latest period, beyond the time when even according to those
who see in the ideographic style a language distinct from Babylonian, this supposed non-Semitic tongue was no longer spoken by the people, and merely artificially maintained, like the Latin of the Middle Ages. The frequent lack of correspondence in minor points between the ideographic style and the phonetic transliteration shows that the latter was intended merely as a
version, as a guide and aid to the understanding of the ' conservative ' method of writing. It was not necessary for a trans
literation to be accurate, whereas, in the case of a translation,
the greatest care would naturally be taken to preserve the original sacred text with all nicety and accuracy, since upon accuracy and nicety the whole efficacy of the formulas rested. The redaction of the incantation texts in the double style must
not be regarded as a necessary indication of high antiquity, but only as a proof that the oldest incantation texts were written in
the ideographic style, and that for this reason the custom was continued down to the latest period. On the other hand, the
addition of the transliteration points to a period when the old
style could no longer be read by the priests with facility without some guide, and incidentally proves again that the texts have gone through an editing process. But in the course of time, additions to the ritual were made, written in the phonetic
style; and then it would happen, as a concession to religious conservatism, that the text would be translated back into the
ideographic form. We would then have a "
bilingual " text,
1 There are some preserved solely in the ideographic style, and others of which we have only the phonetic transliteration.



THE MAGICAL TEXTS. 259
consisting of Babylonian and an artificial " Sumero-Akkadian."
That incantations were also composed in pure Babylonian
without reference to any " Sumero- Akkadian " original is con
clusively shown by the metrical traits frequently introduced. Many of the sections by no means all can be divided into
regular stanzas of four, six, or eight lines, and frequently to the stanza is added a line which forms what Professor D. H. Miiller 1
calls the " response." The same metrical traits being found in
other parts of the Babylonian literature, so, e.g., in the creation epic, their occurrence in the incantation texts is. of course not
accidental. When, therefore, we come across a ritual as the
" Maklu " series, written exclusively in the phonetic style, and
giving evidence of being in part a metrical composition, we are justified in assuming this to have been the original form. Again,
in the case of another series, the " Shurpu," in part Baby
lonian, in part bilingual, 2 since the Babylonian section shows
the metrical form, it is likely that the ideographic style represents a transliteration of a phonetic, or pure Babylonian,
original. The chief value of the incantation texts lies, naturally, in the
insight they afford into the popular beliefs. As among" other nations, so among the Babylonians, the use of certain formulas
to secure release from ills, pains, and evils of any kind, either
actual or portending, rests upon the theory that the accidents and misfortunes to which man is heir are due largely to the
influence of more or less powerful spirits or demons, acting
independently or at the command of higher powers, the gods. Through the incantation rituals we are enabled to specify the traits popularly ascribed to these demons and the means
employed to rid oneself of their baneful grasp.

DEMONS.
The demons were of various kinds and of various grades of
power. The names of many of them, as utukku, shedu, alu,
gallu, point to '
strength
' and '
greatness ' as their main attri
bute; other names, as lilu,
'
night- spirit,' and the feminine form
lilitu, are indicative of the moment chosen by them for their
work ; while again, names like ekimmu, the '
seizer,' akhkhazu, the *
capturer,' rabisu,
' the one that lies in wait,' labartu,
' the
oppressor,' and labasu, 'the overthrower,' show the aim that the demons have in view. Putting these names together, we may form a general idea of the conceptions connected with the demons. They lurk in hidden or remote places, in graves, in
the shadow of ruins, on the tops of mountains, in the wilder
ness. Their favorite time of activity is at dead of night. They
glide noiselessly like serpents, entering houses through holes and crevices. They are powerful, but their power is directed
solely towards evil. They take firm hold of their victims and
torture them mercilessly. To these demons all manner of evil is ascribed. Their pres
ence was felt in the destructive winds that swept the land.
The pestilent fevers that rise out of the marshes of the Euphrates valley and the diseases bred by the humid heat of summer were alike traced to demons lurking in the soil. Some of these
diseases, moreover, were personified, as Namtar, the demon of 'plague,' and Ashakku, the demon of 'wasting disease.' But the petty annoyances that disturb the peace of man a
sudden fall, an unlucky word, a headache, petty quarrels, and the like were also due to the instigation of the demons; while
insanity and the stirring up of the passions love, hatred, and jealousy were in a special sense indicative of the presence

lambs and bulls. It was impossible to forestall their attacks.
They enter a man's dwelling, they wander through the streets, they make their way into food and drink. There is no place, however small, which they cannot invade, and none, however large, that they cannot fill. In a text which furnishes the sacred formulas by means of which one can get rid of the demoniac
influence, a description is given of the demons which may serve as an illustration of what has just been said. The incan
tation is directed against a variety of the demons :
l
The utukku '2 of the field and the utukku of the mountain, The tttukku of the sea and the one that lurks in graves,
The evil shedu, the shining alu, The evil wind, the terrible wind, That sets one's hair on end.
Against these the spirits of heaven and earth are invoked.
The text proceeds :
The titukku that seizes hold of a man, The ekimmu that seizes hold of a man, The ekimmu that works evil, The utukku that works evil.
And after invoking against these demons, likewise, the spirits of heaven and earth, the text passes on to an enumeration of a
long list of physical ills : sickness of the entrails, of the heart,
of the head, of the stomach, of the kidneys, of the limbs and
muscles, of the skin, and of the senses, which are all ascribed
to the influence of the demons.
Apart from the demons that are naught but the personification of certain diseases, it does not appear that the demons were
limited in their power to one specific kind of action. In other
words, sharp distinctions between the demons do not appear to have been drawn. As appears from the extracts above
1 Haupt, Akkadische ttnd Smtterischc Keilschrifttcxte, p. 83. col. i. 11. i-io. 2 Wherever feasible, the Babylonian name of the demon will be used in the translations.

translated, the utukku, shcdu, alu, and ekimmu were grouped
together, and hardly regarded as anything more than descriptive epithets of a general class of demons. At the same time
it appears likely that at one time they were differentiated with
a greater degree of preciseness. So the ekimmu appears to be the shadowy demon that hovers around graves, a species of ghost or vampire that attacks people in the dead of night
and lays them prostrate. Lilu and lilitu are the spirits that
flit by in the night. Of a specific character likewise are the conceptions connected with a demon known as ardat lilt,
'maid of the night,' a strange female 'will-o'-the-wisp,' who approaches men, arouses their passions, but does not permit a satisfaction of them. Great importance being attached by the
Babylonians to dreams, the belief in a ' maid of the night
' was
probably due to the unchecked play of the imagination during the hours of sleep. Bad dreams came at the instigation of the demons, and such a demon as the rabisu or the labartu appears to have been especially associated with the horrible sensations
aroused by a 'nightmare.' 1 Again the utukku is represented at times as attacking the neck of man ; the gallu attacks the hand, the ekimmu the loins, the alu the breast. But these dis
tinctions count for little in the texts. Utukku becomes a gen
eral name for demon, and gallu, alu, and shedu are either used
synonymously with utukku or thrown together with the latter
in a manner that clearly shows the general identity of the conceptions ultimately connected with them. The same is the case with the rabisu and gallu, with the labartu, akhkhazu, and ekimmu. The demons were always given some shape, animal or
human, for it was a necessary corollary of the stage of religious thought to which the belief in demons belongs, that the demon
must not only be somewhere, though invisible to mankind, but
1 Our word ' nightmare ' still embodies the same ancient view of the cause of bad dreams as that found among the Babylonians.



THE MAGICAL TEXTS. 263
also in something that manifests life. Among animals, those
calculated to inspire terror by their mysterious movements
were chosen, as serpents appearing and disappearing with
startling suddenness, or ugly scorpions, against whom it was difficult to protect oneself, or the fabulous monsters with which
graves and pestiferous spots were peopled. Regions difficult of access the desert, the deep waters, the high mountains were the favorite haunts of the demons. Some of these demons
were frequently pictured in the boundary stones between fields, in order to emphasize the curses hurled upon the head of him who should trespass on the lawful rights of the owner of the land. 1 It is to such demons embodied in living form that
epithets such as the '
seizer,' the 'one that lurks,' and the like
apply with peculiar aptness. In a tablet belonging to a long series of incantations, 2 we find references to various animals
the serpent, the scorpion, monsters that are regarded as the embodiment of demons.
In the distinctively religious art, the evil spirits are often pictured as ugly monsters that were to inspire terror by their
very aspect. Depicted on the monuments, singly or in groups, 3 the shape of wild animals was given to the head, while the remainder of the body was suggestive of a human form. With gaping mouths and armed with some weapon, they stand ready
to make an attack. The Assyrian kings, up to the latest period,
acknowledged the power of the demons by making huge representations of them, which they placed at the approaches, entrances, and divisions of their temples and palaces, in the
hope of thus securing their protection. The great bulls and lions with human heads so familiar to every one are but
another form of the same idea. These colossal statues were actually known by the name shedu, which we have seen is

one of the general terms for ' demon.' But as a general thing,
this personal phase of the demon's existence is lost sight of. Even though embodied in animal form, the demons could make
themselves invisible to man ; and since most of their actions
were performed in secret, so that people were totally at their mercy, the differentiation of the demons became a factor of
minor importance. With so large a quantity of demons at command, it was difficult to hit upon the one who was manifest
ing himself by some evil at any given moment. Accordingly, instead of a single mention, a number or a group were enumer
ated, and the magic formulas pronounced against them in
concert. We have one such group of seven to whom quite
a number of references are found in the incantation texts. A
section in one of these texts gives a vivid description of them :
l
Seven are they, they are seven, In the subterranean deep, they are seven, Perched (?) in the sky, they are seven, In a section of the subterranean deep they were reared, They are neither male nor are they female, They are destructive whirlwinds, They have no wife, nor do they beget offspring. Compassion and mercy they do not know, Prayer and supplication they do not hear, Horses bred on the mountains, are they Hostile to Ea 2 are they, Powerful ones among the gods are they. To work mischief in the street they settle themselves in the highway.
Evil are they, they are evil, Seven are they, they are seven, seven, and again seven 3 are they.
These seven spirits, who are elsewhere compared to various
animals, have power even to bewitch the gods. The eclipse of the moon was attributed to their baneful influence. The num

3 Literally,
' to their second time,' i.e., repeat* seven are they.'



THE MAGICAL TEXTS. 265
her seven is probably not to be taken literally. As among so
many nations, 1 seven had a sacred significance for the Babylonians ; but largely, if not solely, for the reason, as I venture to think, because seven was a large number. In the Old Testa
ment seven is similarly used to designate a large number. A
group of seven spirits, accordingly, meant no more than a mis
cellaneous mass of spirits, and we may therefore regard this
'
song of the seven ' as a general characterization of the demons
who, according to this view, appear to move together in groups rather than singly. Elsewhere 2 we are told of this same
group of spirits
' that they were begotten in the mountain of
sunset,' i.e., in the west,
' and were reared in the mountain of
sunrise,' i.e., the east ;
* that they dwell in the hollow of the
earth, and that they are proclaimed on the mountain tops.'
Evidently a description of this kind is intended to emphasize the universal presence of the spirits. There is no place where they are not found ; and when we are furthermore told (apparently in contradiction to what has just been said)
f that neither
in heaven nor earth is their name pronounced (i.e., are they
known to be), that among the gods of the earth (i.e., the pantheon) they are not recognized, that neither in heaven nor
earth do they exist,' this is but the reverse of the picture
intended to illustrate the capability of the spirits to disappear
without leaving any trace of their presence. They are everywhere and yet invisible. They come and they go, and no one
knows their place. Nothing is proof against their approach. Of all the demons it is true, as of this group, that they slip
through bolts and doorposts and sockets, gliding, as we are told, 'like snakes.' Such are the demons against whom man must seek to protect himself.
The relationship of the demons or spirits to the gods of the
pantheon has been touched upon in a previous chapter. 3 It is
1 See Hopkins, The Holy Numbers in the Rig-Veda (Oriental Studies), pp. 144-147. 2 IVR. 15, col. ii. 21 seq. 3 See chapter xi.



266 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
sufficient here to emphasize the fact that the dividing line
between the two becomes at times exceedingly faint. A deity,
we have seen, is a spirit writ large; but often the demon assumes dimensions and is clothed with power that makes him ' little
short of divine.' Strength is the attribute of the demons as it
is the chief feature of the gods. Both classes of powers influ
ence man's career. The names of the demons are preceded by the same determinative that is used for the gods. As a matter
of fact, many of the spirits were originally worshipped as local deities in some restricted territory, which, losing its importance,
bequeaths the name of its protective genius to posterity. In the realm of religious belief, as in the domain of nature, absolute loss of something that once had existence does not take
place. Something remains. Hundreds of old local gods of
Babylonia thus survived in the literature as spirits or demons.
The tendency towards making a selection out of the great mass
of gods goes hand in hand with the multiplication of spirits that might, as occasion presented itself, be invoked. In general, the larger affairs of life were consigned into the hands of the
gods; the petty annoyances accidents, pains, ill luck, and the like were put down to the account of the spirits. The gods
were, on the whole, favorably disposed towards man. They
were angry at times, they sent punishments, but they could be
appeased. The spirits were, on the whole, hostile; and although the Babylonians also invoked favorable and kind spirits, when
a spirit was hostile there was only one method of ridding one
self of the pernicious influence, to drive it out by means of
formulas, and with the help of a priest acting as exerciser.
SORCERERS AND SORCERESSES.
A widespread and apparently very ancient belief among the Babylonians and Assyrians was that certain human beings possessed demoniac power, and could exercise it for evil purposes
over whomsoever they pleased. This belief may have originated



THE MAGICAL TEXTS. 267
in the abnormal appearance presented by certain individuals
in consequence of physical deformities or peculiarities. The uncanny impression made by dwarfs, persons with misshapen limbs, with a strange look in their eyes, and, above all, the insane would give rise to the view that some people, for the
very reason of their variation from the normal type, possessed
peculiar powers. But by the side of such as were distinguished by bodily defects, those who outranked their fellows by virtue
of their prowess or of natural gifts, by keenness of intellect or
cunning, would also be supposed to have received their power through some demoniac source. With the giant and the
artificer there would thus be associated ideas of sorcery and
witchcraft, as with dwarfs, the deformed, and insane. The sorcerers might be either male or female, but, for reasons which
are hard to fathom, the preference was given to females.
Accordingly, it happens that among the Babylonians, as in the Middle Ages, the witch appears more frequently than the male sorcerer. The witches have all the powers of the demons, and
in the incantation texts the two are often thrown together. Just
as the demons, so the witches take away the breath of man,
defile his food and drink, or close up his mouth. They are
able to penetrate into the body of men, and thus produce similar physical and mental disturbances as the animalic demons. In view of this close relationship between witches
and demons, we are justified in regarding the two as varying aspects of one and the same belief. The witch appears to
be merely the person through whom the hitherto ' invisible ' demon has chosen to manifest itself. From being identical in character with the demons, the witches reached a stage which made them superior to the former. They could not
only do everything that the demons did, but they could also control the latter, whereas the demons had no power over witches. Witches could invoke the demons at their will and
bring such persons as they chose within the demons' power.



268 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
Various means were at their disposal for bringing this about.
The glance of a witch's ( evil eye
' was supposed to have great power. 1 Terrible were the sufferings of the one on whom a witch threw the glance that kept the person under her spell.
The ' evil word,' as it was called, and by which the use of certain magic formulas was meant, was another effective means at
her. command for inflicting all manner of evil. Magical potions,
too, compounded of poisonous weeds, appear to have been prepared by them, and which, entering the body of those whom they desired to punish, had a disastrous effect. Such means
might be denominated as direct. There were others indirect which were even more effective, and which rested upon the
principle commonly known as '
sympathetic magic.' 2 Under the notion that the symbolical acts of the sorcerers would have
their effect upon the one to be bewitched, the male sorcerer or
the witch, as the case might be, would tie knots in a rope.
Repeating certain formulas with each fresh knot, the witch
would in this way symbolically strangle the victim, seal his mouth, wrack his limbs, tear his entrails, and the like. Still more popular was the making of an image of the desired
victim of clay or pitch, honey, fat, or other soft material, 3 and
either by burning it inflict physical tortures upon the person represented, or by undertaking various symbolical acts with it, such as burying it among the dead, placing it in a coffin, casting it into a pit or into a fountain, hiding it in an inaccessible
place, placing it in spots that had a peculiar significance, as
the doorposts, the threshold, under the arch of gates, would prognosticate in this way a fate corresponding to one of these acts for the unfortunate victim.

THE MAGICAL TEXTS. 269
THE EXORCISERS.
As a protection against the demons and witches, small images of some of the protecting deities were placed at the entrances to houses, and amulets of various kinds were carried about the
person. Tablets, too, were hung up in the house, probably at the entrance, on which extracts from the religious texts
were inscribed. These texts by virtue of their sacred character
assured protection against the entrance of demons. 1 But when once a person had come under the baneful power of the demons,
recourse was had to a professional class of exercisers, who acted as mediators between the victims and the gods to whom the ultimate appeal for help was made. These exercisers were
of course priests, and at an early period of Babylonian culture it must have been one of the main functions of priests to com
bat the influence of evil spirits. It was for this purpose chiefly
that the people came to the temples, and in so far we are justified in regarding incantation formulas as belonging to the oldest
portion of the Babylonian temple rituals. In the course of
time, as the temples in the great religious centers developed into large establishments, the priests were divided into classes, each with special functions assigned to them. Some were concerned
with the sacrifices, others presided over the oracles, others were set aside for the night and day watches which were observed in
the temple, and it is likely that the scribes formed a class by
themselves. To this age of differentiation in priestly functions
belongs the special class who may be regarded as the forerunners of the eastern magi or magicians, and who by powers and methods peculiar to them could ward off the dangerous attacks
1 Mr. L. W. King describes (Zfits.fUr Assyr. xi. 50-62) interesting fragments of the Dibbarra (or
' plague-god ') legend found on tablets which were evidently intended to be hung up. Mr. King suggests that such tablets were hung up in the houses of the Babylonians whenever a plague broke out. One is reminded of the mezttzoth, the metallic or wooden cases, attached to the doorposts of their houses by the Jews, and which originally served a similar purpose.



270 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
of the demons and witches. The means employed by them
may in general be described as forming the complement to those used by the witches, the reverse side of the picture,
only that they were supposed to be effective against sorcerers, witches, and demons alike. Against the incantation formulas
of the witches, incantations of superior force were prescribed that might serve to overcome the baneful influence of the
former. The symbolical tying of knots was offset by symbol
ical loosening, accompanied by formulas that might effect the gradual release of the victim from the meshes of both the
witches and the demons ; or the hoped-for release was symbolized by the peeling of the several skins of an onion. Correspond
ing to the images made by the witches, the exorcising priests advised the making of counter images of the witches, and by
a symbolical burning, accompanied by certain ceremonies and
conciliatory gifts to the gods, hoped to destroy the witches themselves. Since, moreover, the favorite time chosen by the demons and witches for their manifestations was the night, the
three divisions of the nights evening, midnight, and dawn
that correspond to the temple watches were frequently selected
as the time for the incantations and the symbolical acts. The
address was often made to the gods of night. A series of incantation formulas begins :
I call upon you, gods of the night, With you I call upon the night, the veiled bride,1 I call at evening, midnight, and at dawn.
The formulas themselves, as we shall see, are characterized
by their large number rather than by any elements that they
have in common. At times they constitute a direct appeal to
1 Tallqvist, Assyr. Beschivomngsserie Making. 115, suggests that the 'veiled bride' may be a name of some goddess of the night. This is improbable. It sounds more like a direct personification of the night, for which an epithet as ' veiled bride ' seems appropriate. The name may have arisen in consequence of mythological conceptions affecting the relationship between day and night.



77/A' MAGICAL TEXTS. 271
some god or gods, to some particular spirit, or to the associated spirits of heaven and earth, together with a direct indication of what is desired. An incantation addressed to Nusku, the god
of fire, closes :
Fire-god, mighty and lofty one of the gods,
Who dost overpower the wicked and the hostile, Overpower them (the witches) so that I be not destroyed. Let me thy servant live, let me unharmed stand before thee, Thou art my god, thou art my lord, Thou art my judge, thou art my helper, Thou art my avenger.
Preceding the direct appeal, there is usually a recital more or less detailed of the woes with which one is afflicted. The
victim tells of the pains which torture him. Says one bewitched :
I stand upright, and cannot lie down, neither night nor day. The witches have filled my mouth with their knots. With the aid of upuntu weed, 1 they have stuffed up my mouth. The water that I drink have they diminished, My joy is changed to pain, my pleasure to sorrow.
This recital, which is often wearisome by its length, may or
may not end in a direct appeal to some god or gods. The
narrative of woes, however, is merely introductory to the incantation itself. To prescribe the formula to be used to the one
appealing for help, is the special function of the priest acting as exorciser. He recites the formula, which is then repeated by the communicant.
Instead of an appeal to the gods for help, the incantation often embodies threats hurled in the name of the gods at the
demons or witches in case they do not release their victim.

272 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
Such incantations appear to derive their power chiefly through
the personage of the exerciser, who believes himself to be able
to control the evil spirits. So in one case, after the sufferer
has poured out his troubles, the exerciser replies, threatening the witches with the same evils that they have inflicted :
l
They have used all kinds of charms to entwine me as with ropes, to catch me as in a cage, to tie me as with cords,
to overpower me as in a net, to twist me as with a sling, to tear me as a fabric, to fill me with dirty water as that which runs down a wall (?) to throw me down as a wall.
At this point the exerciser takes up the thread and declares :
But I by command of Marduk, the lord of charms, by Marduk, the master of bewitchment, Both the male and female witch
as with ropes I will entwine, as in a cage I will catch, as with cords I will tie, as in a net I will overpower,
as in a sling I will twist, as a fabric I will tear, with dirty water as from a wall I will fill, as a wall throw them down.
Accompanying these threats, the actions indicated were sym
bolically performed by the exerciser on effigies of the witches made, in this case, of bitumen covered with pitch.
Corresponding again to the potions prepared by the witches, the priests prepared draughts compounded of various weeds and herbs that were given to the victim, or concoctions that
were poured over his body. This constituted the medicinal phase of the priest's labors, and marks the connection between
1 ' Maklu' series, ii. 11. 148-168.

magic and medicine. Naturally such herbs and weeds were
chosen as through experience had proved effective.
THE GODS OF THE INCANTATION TEXTS.
A feature of the incantation texts is the appeal to the gods,
which is seldom^ if ever, wanting. Just as the kings sought, by the enumeration of a large pantheon, to secure the protec
tion 'of as large a number of powers as possible, so the priests endeavored to strengthen their magic formulas by including the mention of all the chief and a varying number of the minor deities. This invocation of groups of deities, as the invocation
of groups of spirits, became more or less conventional, so much
so that, instead of mentioning the gods individually, the scribe would content himself with an indication, at the proper point,
of the number of gods to be appealed to, six, ten, fifteen, as the case may be, to as many as fifty.
1 Precisely what gods he had in mind we are no longer in a position to know, but no doubt the chief members of the pantheon were included in the first
place. Lists of these deities are often added. The superior
triad, Anu, Bel, and Ea, head the list, at times accompanied by their consorts, at times standing alone. The second class of
triads, Sin, Shamash, and Ramman, follow, and then the other
great gods, Nin-ib, Marduk, Nergal, Nusku, and Gibil ; and finally the chief goddesses are added, notably Ishtar, Ninkarrak, or Gula, and Bau.
But besides the chief deities, an exceedingly large number of minor ones are found interspersed through the incantation
texts. Some are well known, as Nin-girsu, Zamama, and Papsukal. Many of them are found in other branches of the
religious literature or in invocations attached to historical texts, commemorative of some work undertaken and completed
1 See Reisner, Sumerisch-Babylonische Hymncn (Berlin, 1896), p. 15.



274 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
by the kings; but a large proportion of these powers, not often
distinguishable from mere spirits, only appear once in the lit
erary remains of Babylonia. It is manifestly impossible, under such circumstances, to specify their traits. In most cases, indeed, the phonetic reading is unknown or uncertain. While a considerable proportion may be put down as local gods,
enjoying an independent, albeit obscure, existence, at least an equal number will turn out to be mere epithets of gods already known. In all cases where the god's name actually appears as an epithet, we may be certain that such is the case. So when
a god is called simply Dainu, i.e., Judge, there can be little doubt that Shamash, the sun-god, is meant ; a god,
'
great mountain,' is none other than Bel; and similarly, such names
as 'merciful,' 'hearer of prayer,' 'conqueror of enemy' are manifestly titles belonging to certain well-known deities, and used much as among the Greeks the gods were often referred
to by the traits, physical or moral, that distinguished them. As for the residue, who are independent deities, while of course our knowledge of the Babylonian religion would be increased did we know more of them than their names, it is not likely
that the worship of these gods, nor the conceptions connected
with them, involved any new principle. A mere enumeration would of course be of little use. Moreover, such an enumera
tion would not be exhaustive, for new deities are found in
almost every additional text that is published. Already this list counts considerably over two hundred. At most, such an
enumeration would merely illustrate what we already know,
the exceedingly large number of local cults that once existed in
Babylonia and Assyria, and disappeared without leaving any trace but the more or less accidental preservation of the name
of the deity, who was once regarded as the patron of the place. Lastly it is to be noted that, besides gods, stars are invoked, as
well as rivers, temples, and even towns, in short, anything that has sacred associations.



THE MAGICAL TEXTS. 275
On a different level from the gods enumerated in groups stand those deities who are introduced into the incantation
texts at essential points individually and for a special reason.
Such deities are comparatively few, hardly more than half a dozen. These gods may be called the gods of the incantation
texts par excellence. Their help is essential to ensure the effec
tiveness of the exorciser's task. They stand in close and
direct connection with the troubles from which relief is prayed
for. For physical ills, they act as healers. If the evil for
which the individual or the country suffers is due to some natu
ral phenomena, an eclipse of the moon, of which people stood in great terror, or a deluge or a famine, the moon-god, the
storm-god, some phase of the sun-deity, or an agricultural god would naturally be implored ; while in a general way the heads of the pantheon, Marduk in Babylonia and Ashur in Assyria, come in for a large share of attention.
As already intimated in a previous chapter, 1 the god who plays perhaps the most prominent role in the incantation texts
is Ea. He occupies this rank primarily by virtue of his being the god of humanity; but another factor which enters into con
sideration, though in an indirect fashion, is his character as a
water-god. Water, being one of the means of purification fre
quently referred to in the texts, acquires a symbolical signifi
cance among the Babylonians, as among so many other nations. Ea, therefore, as the water-god of the ancient sacred town,
Eridu, acquires additional popularity through this circumstance. The titles that he receives in the texts emphasize his power to
heal and protect. He is the great physician who knows all secret sources whence healing can be obtained for the maladies and ills caused by the demons and sorcerers. He is therefore
in a peculiar sense ' the lord of the fates ' of mankind, the chief
exerciser, the all-wise magician of the gods, at whose command
and under whose protection, the priest performs his symbolical
l See p. 137.



276 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
acts. Not only does humanity turn to Ea: the gods, too, appeal to him in their distress. The eclipse of the moon was regarded
by the popular faith as a sort of bewitchment of the great orb
through the seven evil spirits. All the heavenly bodies are
affected by such an event. Anu is powerless. It is only
through Ea that Sin is released, just as though he were a human individual. But Ea is rarely approached directly. At his side stands his son Marduk, who acts as a mediator. Marduk
listens to the petition addressed to him by the exorcising priest
on behalf of the victim, and carries the word to Father Ea. The
latter, after first declaring Marduk to be his equal in knowl
edge, proceeds to dictate the cure. Marduk, accordingly, is given the same titles as his father, Ea. He, too, is the lord of
life, the master of the exorcising art, the chief magician 'among
the gods. The importance thus given to Marduk is an indication of a later period, and must be taken in connection with the suprem
acy accorded to the god after the union of the Babylonian
states. Originally, Ea is the god to whom the direct appeal was made. Marduk is an afterthought that points to the remodeling of the ancient texts after the period of Hammu
rabi. Damkina, the consort of Ea, is occasionally invoked, but it is significant that Sarpanitum, the consort of Marduk, is rarely mentioned.
The burning of images and witches, or of other objects, being so frequently resorted to as a means of destroying bane
ful influences, the god of fire occupies a rank hardly secondary to Ea f Here, too, the mystical element involved in the use of fire adds to the effectiveness of the method. Water and fire
are the two great sources of symbolical purification that we meet with in both primitive and advanced rituals of the past.

THE MAGICAL TEXTS. 277
The fire-god appears in the texts under the double form of
Gibil and Nusku. The former occurs with greater frequency than the latter, but the two are used so interchangeably as to
be in every respect identical. The amalgamation of the two may indeed be due to the growth of the incantation rituals of
Babylon. In some districts Gibil was worshipped as the special
god of fire, in others Nusku, much as we found the sun-god worshipped under the names of Shamas and Utu, and similarly
in the case of other deities. On the supposition that the
incantation rituals are the result of a complicated literary
process, involving the collection of all known formulas, and the bringing of them into some kind of connection with one another,
this existence of a twofold fire-god finds a ready explanation.
At Babylon we know Nusku was worshipped as the fire-god. Gibil belongs therefore to another section, perhaps to one
farther south. He is in all probability the older god of the
two, and the preponderating occurrence of his name in the texts may be taken as a proof of the ancient origin of those
parts in which it occurs. There being no special motive why
he should be supplanted by Nusku, his preeminence was not interfered with through the remodeling to which the texts were
subjected. While bearing in mind that Gibil and Nusku are
two distinct deities, we may, for the sake of convenience, treat them together under the double designation of Gibil-Nusku.
Gibil and Nusku are called ' sons of Ami'; Gibil, indeed, is
spoken of as the first-born of heaven, and the image of his
father. The conception is probably mythological, resting upon the belief in the Jieavenly origin of fire held by all nations.
Gibil-Nusku is exalted as the '
lofty one' among the gods,

importance of fire to mankind made Gibil-Nusku the founder
of cities, and in general the god of civilization. As the fire
god, Gibil-Nusku is more especially invoked at the symbolical
burning of the images of the witches. With a raised torch in
one hand, the bewitched person repeats the incantation recited
by the exerciser. Frequently the instruction is added that
the incantation is to be recited in a whisper, corresponding to
the soft tones in which the demons, witches, and ghosts are
supposed to convey their messages. The incantations in
which the fire-god is exalted in grandiloquent terms belong to the finest productions of this branch of the religious literature.
The addresses to Gibil-Nusku are veritable hymns that are
worthy of better associations. One of these addresses begins:
Nusku, great god, counsellor of the great gods,1 Guarding the sacrificial gifts 2 of all the heavenly spirits, Founder of cities, renewer of the sanctuaries, Glorious day, whose command is supreme, Messenger of Anu, carrying out the decrees of Bel, Obedient to Bel, counsellor, mountain 3 of the earthly spirits, Mighty in battle, whose attack is powerful, Without thee no table is spread in the temple. Without thee, Shamash, the judge executes no judgment.
I, thy servant so and so, the son of so ana so,4 Whose god is so and so, and whose goddess so and so,6 I turn to thee, I seek thee, I raise my hands to thee,
I prostrate myself before thee. Burn the sorcerer and sorceress, May the life of my sorcerer and sorceress be destroyed.
Let me live that I may exalt thee and proudly pay homage to thee.
This incantation, we are told, is to be recited in a whisper, in the presence of an image of wax. The image is burnt as

THE MAGICAL TEXTS. 279
the words are spoken, and as it is consumed the power of the
witch is supposed to wane. The reference to the indispensable
presence of the fire-god in the temple is rather interesting. Sacrifice always entailed the use of fire. To whatever deity the offering was made, Gibil-Nusku could not in any case be
overlooked. The fire constituted the medium, as it were, between the worshipper and the deity addressed. The fire-god
is in truth the messenger who carries the sacrifice into the
presence of the god worshipped. Even Shamash, though himself personifying fire, is forced to acknowledge the power of Gibil-Nusku, who, we are told elsewhere, is invoked, even when sacrifices are made to the sun-god.
Besides being the son of Anu, Gibil-Nusku is brought into association with the two other members of the triad, Bel and
Ea. He is the messenger of Bel and the son of Ea. The for
mer conception is again mythical. Fire is also the instrument
of the gods, and Nusku is particularly called the messenger of Bel because Bel is one of the highest gods. In reality he is
the messenger of all the gods, and is frequently so designated. His connection with Ea, on the other hand, seems to be the
result of the systematizing efforts of the schoolmen. Ea occu
pying the chief rank in the incantations, the subsidiary role of Gibil-Nusku is indicated by making him, just as Marduk, the
son of Ea. In this way, too, the two great means of purification water and fire are combined under a single aspect. The combination was all the more appropriate since the fire
god, as the promoter of culture, shared with Ea the protection
of humanity. Accordingly, all the titles of Ea are bestowed in
one place or the other upon Gibil-Nusku. But, after all, Gibil
Nusku is merely a phase of the solar deity,
1 and hence by the
side of this fire-god, Shamash and the other solar deities,
though in a measure subsidiary to Gibil-Nusku, are frequently invoked. Shamash, as the great judge, was a personage es
1 See above, Nusku, p. 220.



280 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
pecially appropriate for occasions which involved a decision in favor of the bewitched and against the witches or demons.
Gibil-Nusku, like Shamash, is exalted as the great judge who
comes to the aid of the oppressed. Similarly, the fire-god receives the attributes belonging to Ninib, Nergal, and the
various phases of the latter, such as Lugal-edinna, Lugal-gira, and Alamu. These gods, then, and their consorts, because of their relationship to the fire-god, are introduced into the incan
tations, and what is more to the point, the various phases of Nergal and Ninib are introduced without any trace of the dis
tinctions that originally differentiated them from one another. 1
Besides the great solar deities, minor ones, as Nin-gish-zida 2
and I-shum, are frequently added in long lists of protecting
spirits to whom the appeal for help is directed. The attempt is also made to illustrate their relationship to the great fire
god. So I-shum becomes the messenger of Nusku, while Nin
gish-zida (though in the days of Gudea a male deity 3
) appears
to be regarded, as Tallqvist has suggested, as the consort of Nusku.
Night being a favorite time for the recital of the incantations, it was natural that the orb of night, the god Sin, should
be added to the pantheon of the exerciser. Though playing a
minor role, the moon-god is never omitted when a long series
of protecting spirits is invoked. But there are occasions when Sin becomes the chief deity invoked. Reference has already
been made to the general terror that moon eclipses inspired. The disappearance of the moon was looked upon as a sign of
the god's displeasure or as a defeat of the moon in a conflict
with other planets. Disaster of some kind war, pestilence, internal disturbances was sure to follow upon an eclipse, unless the anger of the god could be appeased or his weakness
1 See p. 67. 2 A form of Nusku, according to Tallqvist, Assyr. Beschwor. p. 146. It would be more accurate to say a form of Ninib. See p. 92.

THE MAGICAL TEXTS. 281
overcome. In the case of such general troubles affecting the whole country, it is the kings themselves who seek out the
priests. Rituals were prepared to meet the various contingen
cies. The king begins the ceremony by a prayer addressed to Sin. One of these prayers begins: 1
O Sin, O Nannar! mighty one . . .
O Sin, thou who alone givest light,
Extending light to mankind, Showing favor to the black-headed ones,2 Thy light shines in heaven . . . Thy torch is brilliant as fire ; Thy light fills the broad earth.
Thy light is glorious as the Sun . . . Before thee the great gods lie prostrate ; The fate of the world rests with thee.
An eclipse has taken place, portending evil to the country, and libations have been poured out on days carefully selected as favorable ones. The king continues :
I have poured out to thee, with wailing, 3 a libation at night ; I have offered thee a drink-offering with shouts ; Prostrate and standing erect 4 I implore thee.
With the prayer to Sin, appeals to other gods and also god
desses are frequently combined, to Marduk, Ishtar, Tashmitum, Nabu, Ramman, and the like. The incantations them
selves, consisting of fervent appeals to remove the evil, actual
or portending, are preceded by certain ceremonies, the burning of incense, the pouring out of some drink, or by symbolical acts, as the binding of cords; and the god is appealed to once more to answer the prayer.

one. The moon-god, having disappeared, is bewailed as though dead. 4 /.., under all conditions and at all times.



282 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
Again, just as Gibil-Nusku entails the invocation of a large
variety of solar deities, so Ea, as the water-god, leads to the introduction of various water-gods and spirits. Perhaps the
most prominent of these is the god Naru, whose name, signifying
*
river,' 1 is clearly the personification of the watery element, though of the minor bodies of water. Next in order comes the
goddess Nin-akha-kuddu. 2 She is invoked as 'goddess of puri
fication.' From her association in several passages with the
great deep, and with the city of Eridu metaphorically used for the great deep one may be permitted to conclude that
she, too, was conceived of as a water-god or a water-spirit. She is
* the lady of spells,' who is asked to take possession of the
body of the sufferer, and thus free him from the control of
demons or witches. By the side of this goddess, Gula,
' the
great physician,' is often appealed to. Again, the demons being in some cases the ghosts of the departed, or such as hover around graves, Nin-kigal, or Allatu, the mistress of the
lower world, is an important ally, whose aid is desired in the
struggle against the evil spirits. Lastly, it is interesting to note that Izdubar, or Gilgamesh, the famous hero of the great Babylonian epic, occurs also in incantations 3 a welcome indi
cation of the antiquity of the myth, and the proof, at the same time, that the epic is built on a foundation of myth. From
the mythological side, Gilgamesh appears to be a solar deity. The connection of a solar god with fire would account for
his appearance in the magical texts. However obscure some of the points connected with the gods of the incantation texts
may be, so much is certain, that the two factors of water and
fire, and the part played by these elements in the ceremonies, control and explain the choice of most of the gods and god
1 The reading Naru is not altogether certain, but probable. See Tallqvist, Assyr. Beschwor. pp. 131, 132, whose suggestion, however, that Naru may be a female deity, is not acceptable. Elitti is probably a scribal error. 2 See above p. 103.

THE MAGICAL TEXTS. 283
desses introduced, though be it expressly noted not of all
occurring in the magical texts.
THE RITUAL AND FORMULAS.
Coming to the incantations themselves, they can best be
characterized as appeals interspersed with words of a more or
less mystic character. The force and efficacy of the incanta
tion lie not so much in the meaning of the words uttered, as
in the simple fact that they are to be uttered. These incanta
tions were combined into a ritual, and indications were given of the occasions on which the incantations were to be used.
An analysis of one of these rituals will serve to illustrate this
branch of the religious literature of the Babylonians. I choose
for this purpose the series known as Maklu, i.e., Burning, 1 the
interpretation of which has been so considerably advanced by Dr. Tallqvist's admirable work. The first tablet of the series
opens with an invocation to the gods of night. After complaining of his sad condition, the bewitched individual con
tinues as follows :
Arise ye great gods, hear my complaint ;
Grant me justice, take cognizance of my condition. I have made an image of my sorcerer and sorceress; I have humbled myself before you. and bring to you my cause Because of the evil they (i.e., the witches) have done, Of the impure things which they have handled,2 May she 3 die ! Let me live ! May her charm, her witchcraft, her sorcery (?) be broken. May the plucked sprig (?) of the bimi tree purify me.
May it release me ; may the evil odor 4 of my mouth be scattered to the winds. May the mashtakal herb 5 which fills the earth cleanse me.
Before you let me shine like the kaukal herb '
1 See above, p. 254. 3 The witch. 2 To bewitch me. 4 From which he suffers through the witches. 5 The identification of the many herbs mentioned in the texts is as yet impossible. The subject awaits investigation at the hands of one versed in botanical lore.



284 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
Let me be as brilliant and pure as the lardu herb. The charm of the sorceress is evil ; May her words return to her mouth, 1 her tongue be cut off. Because of her witchcraft, may the gods of night smite her, The three watches of the night 2 break her evil charm. May her mouth be wax 3 (?), her tongue honey. May the word causing my misfortune that she has spoken dissolve like wax (?). May the charm that she has wound up melt like honey, So that her magic knot be cut in twain, her work destroyed, All her words scattered across the plains By the order that the gods have given.
The section closes with the ordinary request of the exerciser to the victim :
" Recite this incantation." It will be seen how
closely the principle of sympathetic magic is followed. The individual having been bewitched by means of certain herbs
concocted probably into potions, other herbs are prepared by the exerciser as an antidote. The emphasis laid upon purifi
cation, too, is noteworthy. There are numerous synonyms
employed for which it is difficult to find the adequate equiva
lent in English. The terms reach out beyond the literal to the
symbolical purification. The victim wishes to become pure, cleansed of all impurities, so that he may be resplendent as
the gods are pure, brilliant, and glorious, pure as the water, brilliant and glorious as the fire.
The length of the formulas varies. Often they consist only
of a few lines. So the one immediately following appeals to Gilgamesh in these words:
Earth, Earth, Earth, Gilgamesh is the master of your witchcraft. What you have done, I know ; What I do, you know not. All the mischief wrought by my sorceresses is destroyed, dissolved is
gone.
1 /.., be ineffective. 2 /.e., the gods presiding over the watches. 3 Her words dissolve like wax and honey.



THE MAGICAL TEXTS. 285
At times the conditions under which the witches are pictured
as acting are very elaborate. They are represented as dwell
ing in places with which mythological conceptions are connected ; they are ferried across the river separating their city
from human habitations ; they are protected against attacks by the walls which surround their habitations. To effect a release,
the exercisers, it would appear, made representations by means of drawings on clay of these habitations of the witches. They
thereupon symbolically cut off the approaches and laid siege to the towns. This, at least, appears to be the meaning of an incantation beginning :
My city is Sappan,1 my city is Sappan ; The gates of my city Sappan are two,
One towards sunrise, the other towards sunset.2 I carry a box, a pot with mashtakal herbs ; To the gods of heaven I offer water;
As I for you secure your purification, So do you purify me !
The victim imitates the conduct of the witch, goes about as
she does, with a pot in which the potions are made, performs the symbolical act which should purify him of the evil that is
in him, and hopes, in this way, to obtain his own release. The
description continues :
I have kept back the ferry, have shut off the wall,3 Have thus checked the enchantment from all quarters. Anu and Anatum have commissioned me. Whom shall I send to Belit of the field ? 4 Into the mouth of the sorcerer and sorceress cast the lock.5 Recite the incantation of the chief of gods, Marduk.6 ' Let them 7 call to thee but answer them not,
1 Supposed to be situated at the northern point of the heavens. 2 The vault of heaven was pictured as having two gates. 3 So that the witch cannot leave her habitation. 4 With the order ' to cast the lock,' etc. 8 To prevent her from uttering her charms. 6 The following four lines constitute the incantation. 7 /.., the witches.



286 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
Let them address thee, but hearken not to them. Let me call to thee, and do thou answer me, Let me address thee, and do thou hearken unto me.' By the command of Anu, Anatum, and Belit, recite the incantation.
The hymns to the fire-god, Nusku, of which the 'Maklu'
series naturally furnishes many specimens, 1 are all pretty much alike. I choose one which illustrates in greater detail the sym
bolical burning of the image of the witch: 2
Nusku, great offspring of Anu, The likeness of his father, the first-born of Bel,
The product of the deep, sprung from Ea,3 I raise the torch to illumine thee, yea, thee. The sorcerer who has bewitched me, Through the witchcraft by means of which he has bewitched me, do thou bewitch him. The sorceress who has bewitched me, Through the witchcraft by means of which she has bewitched me, bewitch thou her. The charmer who has charmed me, Through the charm with which he has charmed me, charm thou him. The witch who has charmed me, Through the charm with which she has charmed me, charm thou her.
Those who have made images of me, reproducing my features,
Who have taken away my breath, torn my hairs,
Who have rent my clothes, have hindered my feet from treading the dust, Ktay the fire-god, the strong one, break their charm.
Just as the witches were burnt in effigy, so also the demons
were supposed to be similarly dispelled. Immediately following the incantation comes one directed against the demons:
1 See above, p. 278, where one has been given.
2 Maklu, i. 122-143. 3 The fiery element belongs to all three divisions of the universe, to heaven, earth, and water.



THE MAGICAL TEXTS. 287
I raise the torch, their images I burn, Of the iitukkii, the shedu, the rabisu, the ekimmu^ The labartu, the labasi, the akhkkazu, Of lilu and lilitu and ardat lili, And every evil that seizes hold of men.
Tremble, melt away, and disappear ! May your smoke rise to heaven, May Shamash destroy your limbs, May the son of Ea [i.e., may the fire-god], The great magician, restrain your strength (?).
The witch who has caused the evil may be unknown. For such a case one of the incantations runs :
*
Who art thou, sorceress, who bears her evil word within her heart, Through whose tongue my misfortune is produced, Through whose lips I have been poisoned, In whose footsteps death follows ?
Sorceress, I seize thy mouth, seize thy tongue, I seize thy searching eyes, I seize thy ever-moving feet, I seize thy knees ever active, I seize thy hands ever stretched out, I tie thy hands behind thee.
May Sin . . . destroy thy body, May he cast thee into an abyss of fire and water.
Sorceress, as the circle of this seal-ring,2 May thy face grow pale and wan.
Of the same character as this, are a variety of other incantations, all applicable to cases in which the sorceress is unknown. As the last specimen of the ' Maklu '
series, I choose an incantation addressed to the demons, which is interesting because of the direct character of the commands it contains :
Away, away, far away, far away, For shame, for shame, fly away, fly away, Round about face, go away, far away, Out of my body, away,
l Maklu, Hi. 11. 89-103. , 2 Many of the seals used by the Babylonians were of white stone or bone.



288 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
Out of my body, far away, Out of my body, away for shame,
Out of my body, fly away, Out of my body, round about face,
Out of my body, go away, Into my body, come not back, Towards my body, do not approach, Towards my body, draw not nigh, My body torture not. By Shamash the mighty, be ye foresworn. By Ea, the lord of everything, be ye foresworn. By Marduk, the chief magician of the gods, be ye foresworn. By the fire-god, be ye foresworn. From my body be ye restrained !
Repetition and variation in the use of certain phrases make
up, as will be seen from the specimens given, a large part of
the incantation. A curious illustration of the importance
attributed to such repetition is furnished by the eighth and
last tablet of the ' Maklu ' series. It consists of seven divisions,
each beginning with a repetition of the headlines of the vari
ous sections of the preceding seven tablets; and only after the headlines of each of the tablets have been exhausted, does the
real incantation begin. This eighth tablet contains therefore
a kind of summary of all the others, the purpose of which is to
gather together all the power and influence of the seven others.
The * Maklu ' ritual deals so largely with the fire-god that a
specimen from another series, to illustrate the position of Ea
and Marduk in the incantations, seems called for. The ' Shurpu' series introduces Ea and Marduk more particularly. The fifth
tablet of this series begins :
l
The evil curse rests like a gallu upon the man, The pain-giving -voice 2 has settled upon him, The voice that is not good has settled upon him,
The evil curse, the charm that produces insanity, The evil curse has killed that man as a sheep,
1 Zimn^rn's edition, pp. 25-29. 2 /.*?., the evil word.



THE MAGICAL TEXTS. 289
His god has departed from his body, 1 His goddess has . . . taken her place outside,2 The pain-giving voice covers him as a garment and confuses him. Marduk sees him, And proceeds to the house of his father Ea and speaks :
" My father, the evil curse as a demon has settled on the man."
He says it for a second time.
" What that man should do, I do not know ; by what can he be cured ? " Ea answers his son Marduk : " My son, can I add aught that thou dost not know ? Marduk, what can I tell thee that thou dost not know ? What I know, also thou knowest. My son Marduk, take him to the overseer of the house of perfect puri
fication, Dissolve his spell, release him from the charm, and from the troublesome bodily disease. Whether it be the curse of his father, Or the curse of his mother, Or the curse of his brother, Or the curse of an unknown,8 May the bewitchment through the charm of Ea be peeled off like an onion. May it be cut off like a date. May it be removed like a husk.
O power of the spirit of heaven, be thou invoked !
O spirit of earth, be thou invoked !
"
The purification by water, which is here only incidentally referred to, is more fully touched upon in other incantations, where Ea tells Marduk that the victim must take
Glittering water, pure water, Holy water, resplendent water, The water twice seven times may he bring,
May he make pure, may he make resplendent. May the evil rabisu depart, May he betake himself outside,
1 His protecting deity has deserted him. 2 Of his body. 3 f.e., whoever may have invoked the evil demon to settle upon him.



290 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
May the protecting skedu, the protecting lamassu, Settle upon his body. Spirit of heaven, be thou invoked ! Spirit of earth, be thou invoked ! *
Still other methods of magical cure besides the use of water
and of potions were in vogue. In a tablet of the same ritual to
which the last extract belongs, and which is especially concerned with certain classes of diseases produced by the demons, the sick man is told to take
White wool, which has been spun into thread, To attach it to his couch 2 in front and at the top, Black wool which has been spun into thread To bind at his left side.
Then follows the incantation which he is to recite :
The evil utiikku, alu, ekimmu, The evil gallu, the evil god, rabisu, Labartzi, labasu, akhkhazu, Lilu and lilit and ardat lili, Sorcery, charm, bewitchment, The sickness, the cruel artifice, Their head against his head, Their hand against his hand, Their foot against his foot,
May they not place, May they never draw nigh. Spirit of heaven, be thou foresworn ! Spirit of earth, be thou foresworn !
It is interesting to note the introduction of ethical ideas into
these texts, despite the primitive character of the beliefs upon which the incantations repose. The possibility was considered that the attack of the demons was a punishment sent in some
way for committed sins. The incantation series ' Shurpu ' fur
nishes us with a long list of wrongs for which a person may
1 The translation of these lines follows in all but some minor passages the correct one given by Sayce, Hibbert Lectures, p. 446. 2 Of the sick man.



THE MAGICAL TEXTS. 291
be held enthralled in the power of the demons or sorcerers.
The exorciser in petitioning that the ban may be relieved, enumerates at length the various causes for which the evil may have been sent :
1
Has he sinned against a god,
Is his guilt against a goddess, Is it a wrongful deed against his master, Hatred towards his elder brother,
Has he despised father or mother, Insulted his elder sister,
Has he given too little, 2 Has he withheld too much,
For " no " said "
yes,"
For " yes " said " no " ? 3
Has he used false weights ?
Has he taken an incorrect amount, Not taken the correct sum, Has he fixed a false boundary,
Not fixed a just boundary, Has he removed a boundary, a limit, or a territory, Has he possessed himself of his neighbor's house, Has he approached his neighbor's wife, Has he shed the blood of his neighbor, Robbed his neighbor's dress ?
Was he frank in speaking, But false in heart, Was it " yes " with his mouth,
But " no " in his heart ? 4
In this way the exorciser proceeds to enumerate an exceedingly long list of sins no less than one hundred most of
which are ethical misdemeanors, while others are merely cere
monial transgressions. In the third tablet of this series 5 there
1 Zimmern, Die Besch-worungstafeln Shurfu, pp. 5, 6. 2 In mercantile transactions. 3 /.^ lied. 4 I.c., did he say one tiling, but mean the contrary ? 5 Zimmern, ib. pp. 13-20.



292 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
is even a longer list of causes for the ban which Marduk, the
" chief exorciser " among the gods, is called upon to loosen.
Here again we find an equal proportion of moral transgressions placed on a par with errors in performing religious rites or unwillful offences in neglecting conventional methods of doing
things. The ethical features of the texts can, without much question,
be put down as the work of the later editors. They belong to
a period when already an advanced conception not only of right and wrong, but also of sin had arisen among the religious
leaders of the people, and perhaps had made its way already
among the masses, without, however, disturbing the confidence in the traditional superstitions. The strange combination of
primitive and advanced religious beliefs is characteristic, as we shall have occasion to see, of various divisions of the Babylonian
religious literature. The lapse from the ethical strain to the incantation refrain is as sudden as it is common. The priest
having exhausted the category of possible sins or mishaps that have caused the suffering of the petitioner, proceeds to invoke the gods, goddesses, and the powerful spirits to loosen the ban. There is no question of retribution for actual acts of in
justice or violence, any more than there is a question of genuine contrition. The enumeration of the causes for the suffering
constitutes in fact a part of the incantation. The mention of the
real cause in the long list and the list aims to be exhaustive,
so that the exorciser may strike the real cause goes a long
way towards ensuring the departure of the evil spirit. And if, besides striking the real cause, the exorciser is fortunate enough
in his enumeration of the various gods, goddesses, and spirits
to call by name upon the right god or spirit, the one who has
the power over the demon in question, his object is achieved.
Speaking the right words and pronouncing the right name, constitute, together with the performance of the correct ceremony and the bringing of the right sacrifice, the conditions



THE MAGICAL TEXTS. 293
upon which depends the success of the priest in the incanta
tion ritual. Hence the striking features of these texts, the
enumeration of long lists of causes for misfortune, long lists
of powers invoked, and a variety of ceremonies prescribed, in
the hope that the priest will " hit it " at one time or the other.
INCANTATIONS AND PRAYERS.
The incantations naturally shade off into prayers. Frequently they are prayers pure and simple. Powerful as the sacred for
mulas were supposed to be, the ultimate appeal of the sufferer
is to the gods. Upon their favor it ultimately depends whether the mystic power contained in the sacred words uttered shall
manifest itself to the benefit of the supplicant or not. While it
is proper, therefore, to distinguish incantations from prayers, the combination of the two could scarcely be avoided by the priests,
who, rising in a measure superior to the popular beliefs, felt it to be inconsistent with a proper regard for the gods not to
give them a superior place in the magical texts. The addition, to the sacred formulas, of prayers directly addressed to certain
gods may be put down as due to the adaptation of ancient texts to the needs of a later age; and, on the other hand, the addition
of incantations to what appear to have been originally prayers,
pure and simple, is a concession made to the persistent belief
in the efficacy of certain formulas when properly uttered. Such
combinations of prayers and incantations constituted, as would
appear, a special class of religious texts; and, in the course of further editing,
1 a number of prayers addressed to various
deities were combined and interspersed with incantation and ceremonial directions which were to accompany the prayers. The incantations accordingly lead us to the next division in
the religious literature of the Babylonians, the prayers and hymns.
1 For details as to the manner in which this editing was done, see King's admirable remarks in the Introduction to his Babylonian Magic ami Sorcery, pp. xx-xxiv.



CHAPTER XVII.
THE PRAYERS AND HYMNS.
FROM what has just been said, it follows that the step from
magical formulas to prayers and hymns is but a small one, and
does not, indeed, carry with it the implication of changed or
higher religious conceptions. While the incantation texts in their entirety may be regarded as the oldest fixed ritual of
the Babylonian-Assyrian religion, there were occasions even in the oldest period of Babylonian history when the gods were approached in prayer without the accompaniment of magic formulas. Such occasions were the celebration of festivals in
honor of the gods, the dedication of temples or of sacred stat
ues, and the completion of such purely secular undertakings as the building of a canal. Gudea, we are told, upon completing a statue to his god Nin-girsu, prayed: 'O King, whose great strength the land cannot endure (?) ; Nin-girsu ! grant to Gudea, who has built this house, a good fate.' l As in the
earliest, so in the latest, period, the Babylonian kings approach the gods in prayer upon completing their great sacred edifices. The prayers of Nebuchadnezzar are particularly fine remark
able, indeed, for their diction and elevation of thought. Upon completing the restoration of a temple to Nin-karrak or Gula
in Sippar, he prays :
2
Nin-karrak, lofty goddess, look with favor upon the work of my hands.
Mercy towards me be the command of thy lips, Long life, abundance of strength, Health, and joy, grant to me as a gift.
1 Inscription D, col. v. 11. 2-7. 2 Abel-Winckler, Keilschrifttcxte, p. 33, col. iii. 11. 52-58.



THE PRAYERS AND HYMNS. 295
In the presence of Shamash and Marduk cause my deeds to be regarded
with favor,
Command grace for me.
A prayer of the same king addressed to Shamash, upon
restoring the great temple at Sippar, Erbabbara, runs :
l
O Shamash, great lord, upon entering joyfully into thy glorious temple E-babbara, Look with favor upon my precious handiwork,
Mercy towards me be thy command ; Through thy righteous order, may I have abundance of strength. Long life, and a firm throne, grant to me. May my rule last forever !
With a righteous sceptre of blissful rulership, With a legitimate staff, bringing salvation to mankind, adorn my sovereignty forever.
With strong weapons for the fray, protect my soldiers ;
Then, O Shamash, by oracle and dream, answer me correctly ! By thy supreme command, which is unchangeable, May my weapons advance, and strike and overthrow the weapons of the enemies.
Nebuchadnezzar's inscriptions are characterized by the prayer
with which they almost invariably close. Whether erecting a
sanctuary or building a canal or improving the walls of Babylon, he does not fail to add to the description of his achievements a prayer to some deity, in which he asks for divine grace
and the blessings of long life and prosperity. There were other occasions, too, in which, both in ancient times and in more modern periods, prayers were sent up to the
gods. Kudur-mabuk, of the second dynasty of Ur, informs us that he built a temple, E-nun-makh, to Sin in gratitude to the god for having hearkened to his prayer.
The Assyrian kings pray to Ashur or Ishtar before the battle,
and offer thanks after the victory has been gained. " O god
dess of Arbela !" says Ashurbanabal, 2 " I am Ashurbanabal, the
king of Assyria, the product of thy hands, created by thee in

the house of my father. To renew the sanctuaries of Assyria,
and to enlarge the cities of Babylonia, . . . have I devoted
myself to thy dwelling-places, and have steadfastly worshipped
thy sovereignty Hearken unto me ! O thou mis
tress of mistresses, supreme in battle, mistress of the fray,
queen of the gods, . . . who speakest good things in the presence of Ashur, the father, that produced thee. Teumman, king of Elam, has arrayed his army and fixed upon battle, brandishes his weapons to proceed against Assyria. Do thou
now, O warrior, like . . . drive him into the midst of the fray,
pursue him with a storm, with an evil wind." Ishtar, the narrative tells us, hearkened to the fervent words of the king.
" Be
not afraid," says the goddess to her royal subject. Elsewhere
the same king prays more briefly to Ashur and Ishtar. " May
his corpse [viz., of a certain enemy] be cast before his enemy
[/.<?., before Ashurbanabal], and his remains be carried off." 1 Upon ascending the throne, we find Nebuchadnezzar address
ing a fervent prayer to the great god Marduk :
Eternal Ruler ! Lord of the Universe ! Grant that the name 2 of the king whom thou lovest, Whose name thou hast mentioned,3 may flourish as seems good to thee. Guide him on the right path. 1 am the ruler who obeys thee, the creation of thy hand. It is thou who hast created me, And thou hast entrusted to me sovereignty over mankind.
According to thy mercy, O lord, which thou bestowest upon all, Cause me to love thy supreme rule.
Implant the fear of thy divinity in my heart, Grant to me whatsoever may seem good before thee, Since it is thou that dost control my life.
The curses also with which so many of the historical texts
of Babylonia and Assyria close may be regarded as prayers.
We are also justified in assuming that the offering of sacrifices,
1 Without proper burial, the greatest misfortune that could happen to the dead. 2 I.e., life. 3 /.<?., called to the throne.



THE PRAYERS AND HYMNS. 297
which formed at all times an essential feature of the cult, both
in Babylonia and Assyria, was always accompanied by some form of prayer addressed to some deity or to a group of deities.
In view of all this, no sharp chronological line, any more than a logical one, can be drawn marking off the incantation for
mulas from the hymns and prayers pure and simple. The conceptions formed of the gods in the incantation texts are
precisely those which we have found to be characteristic of
them in the period when this phase of the religion reached
its highest development. Ea is the protector of humanity, Shamash the lord of justice ; and, if certain ideas that in the
prayers are attached to the gods as wisdom to Sin are
absent from the incantations, it may be regarded rather as an
accident than as an indication of any difference of conception.
The pantheon too, barring the omission of certain gods, is the
same that we find it to be in the historical texts, and the order
in which the gods are enumerated corresponds quite closely with the rank accorded to them in the inscriptions of the kings.
What variations there are are not sufficiently pronounced to warrant any conclusions. All this points, as has been empha
sized several times, to the subsequent remodeling of the texts
in question. It is true that we find more traces of earlier and
purely mythological notions in the incantations than in the
hymns and prayers, but such notions are by no means foreign
to the latter. Even in those religious productions of Babylonia which represent the flower of religious thought, we meet with views that reflect a most primitive mode of thought. The
proper view, therefore, to take of the prayers and hymns is to
regard them as twin productions to the magical texts, due to the same conceptions of the power of the gods, an emanation of
the same religious spirit, and produced at the same time that
the incantation rituals enjoyed popular favor and esteem, and
without in any way interfering with the practice of the rites
that these rituals involved.



298 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
This position does not of course preclude that among the
prayers and hymns that have been preserved there are some
betraying a loftier spirit, a higher level of religious thought, and more pronounced ethical tendencies than others. Indeed, the
one important result of the dissociation of the address to the
gods from the purely practical magic rites was to produce the conditions favorable to a development of higher religious
thought. An offering of praise to the gods, whether it was for victory granted or for a favor shown, called forth the best
and purest sentiments of which the individual was capable.
Freed from all lower associations, such an act proved an incentive to view the deity addressed from his most favorable
side, to emphasize those phases which illustrated his affection
for his worshippers, his concern for their needs, his discrimina
tion, and not merely his power and strength. In short, the softer and the more humane aspects of the religion would thus be brought out. The individual would address his god in
terms betraying his affection, and would couple with him attributes that would reflect the worshipper's rather than the
god's view of the purpose and aim of existence. Whatever
powers of idealization there lay in the worshipper's nature
would be brought into the foreground by the intellectual effort
involved in giving expression to his best thoughts, when aiming to come into close communion with a power upon which he
felt himself dependent. For an understanding, therefore, of
the ethical tendencies of the Babylonian religion, an appreciation of the prayers and hymns is of prime importance ; and we shall presently see that, as a matter of fact, the highest level of ethical and religious thought is reached in some of these
hymns. The prayers of Nebuchadnezzar represent, perhaps, the best
that has been attained in this branch of religious literature.
Returning, for a moment, to the dedication prayer to Marduk, addressed by the king on the occasion of his mounting the



THE PRAYERS AND HYMNS. 299
throne, 1 one cannot fail to be struck by the high sense of the
importance of his station with which the king is inspired.
Sovereignty is not a right that he can claim it is a trust
granted to him by Marduk. He holds his great office not for
purposes of self-glorification, but for the benefit of his subjects. In profound humility he confesses that what he has he owes
entirely to Marduk. He asks to be guided so that he may
follow the path of righteousness. Neither riches nor power
constitute his ambition, but to have the fear of his lord in his
heart. Such a plane of thought is never reached in the incan
tation texts. For all that, the original dependence of the
prayers and hymns upon incantation formulas, tinges even the best productions. Some of the finest hymns, in which elevated
thoughts are elaborated with considerable skill, reveal their
origin by having incantations attached to them. Again, others
which are entirely independent productions are full of allusions to sickness, demons, and sorcerers, that show the outgrowth of the hymns from the incantations; and none are entirely free from traces of the conceptions that are characteristic of
the incantation texts. The essential difference between these
two classes of closely related texts may be summed up in the
proposition that the religious thought which produced them both is carried to a higher point of elaboration in the hymns.
The prayers and hymns represent the attempt of the Babylonian mind to free itself from a superstitious view of the relationship of man to the powers around him ; an attempt, but it must be added an unsuccessful one.
It is rather unfortunate that many of the hymns found in the
library of Ashurbanabal are in so fragmentary a condition. As a consequence we are frequently unable to determine more
than their general contents. The colophons generally are missing, at least in those hymns hitherto published, 2 so
1 See p. 296. 2 The prayers and hymns of the Babylonians have not yet received the attention they deserve at the hands of scholars. Sayce, e.g., in the specimens attached to his



300 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
that we are left in the dark as to the special occasion for which
the hymn was composed. Without this knowledge it is quite impossible to assign to it any definite date except upon internal evidence. In the course of time, the hymnal literature of the
great temples of Babylonia must have grown to large proportions, and, in collecting them, some system was certainly followed by the priests engaged in this work. There is evidence of a collection having been made at some time of hymns addressed to Shamash. Some of these were intended as a salute upon the sun's rising, others celebrated his setting. These
hymns convey the impression of having been composed for the worship of the god in one of his great temples perhaps in
E-babbara, at Sippar. We have several hymns also addressed
to Marduk, and one can well suppose that at the great temple E-sagila, in Babylon, a 'collection of Marduk hymns must have
been prepared, and so for others of the great gods. But,
again, many of the hymns convey the impression of being merely sporadic productions composed for certain occasions, and without any reference to a possible position in a ritual.
Of the hymns so far published, those to Shamash are proba
bly the finest. The conception of the sun-god as the judge of mankind lent itself readily to an ethical elaboration. Accord
ingly, we find in these hymns justice and righteousness as the
two prominent themes. A striking passage in one of these hymns reads :
l
The law of mankind dost thou direct,
Eternally just in the heavens art thou, Of faithful judgment towards all the world art thou.
Hibbert Lectures, pp. 479-520, does not even distinguish properly between pure
hymns and mere incantations. Now that Dr. Bezold's great catalogue of the Koujunjik collection of the British Museum is completed, the opportunity is favorable for some one to study the numerous unpublished fragments of hymns in the British Museum, and produce in connection with those that have been published a comprehensive work on the subject. Knudtzon's Assyrische Gebete an den Sonnengott may serve as a model for such a work, l IVR. 28, no. i.



THE PRAYERS AND HYMNS. 301
Thou knowest what is right, thou knowest what is wrong.
O Shamash ! Righteousness has lifted up its neck (?);
O Shamash ! Wrong like a has been cut (?) ;
O Shamash ! The support of Anu and Bel art thou ;
O Shamash! Supreme judge of heaven and earth art thou.
After a break in the tablet, the hymn continues :
O Shamash ! Supreme judge, great lord of all the world art thou; Lord of creation, merciful one of the world art thou.
The following lines now reveal the purpose of the hymn. It
is a prayer for 'the life of the king :
O Shamash ! on this day purify and cleanse the king, the son of his god. Whatever is evil within him, let it be taken out.
The next few lines are a distinct echo of the incantation
formulas, and show how readily prayer passes from a higher to a lower stage of thought :
Cleanse him like a vessel l Illumine him like a vessel of l
Like the copper of a polished tablet,2 let him be bright. Release him from the ban.
The same incantation occurs at the close of another hymn
to Shamash, addressed to the sun upon his rising.
3 The colo
phon furnishes the opening line of the next tablet, which also
begins with an address to Shamash. We have here a clear
indication of a kind of Shamash ritual extending, perhaps, over
a number of tablets, and to which, in all probability, the hymn
just quoted also belongs. The opening lines of the second hymn read :
O Shamash ! out of the horizon of heaven thou issuest forth, The bolt of the bright heavens thou openest, The door of heaven thou dost open. O Shamash ! over the world dost thou raise thy head.
O Shamash ! with the glory of heaven thou coverest the world.

302 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
It would be difficult to believe, but for the express testimony
furnished by the hymn itself, that a production giving evidence of such a lofty view of the sun-god should, after all, be no more than an incantation. The same is the case, however, with all
the Shamash hymns so far published. They either expressly or by implication form part of an incantation ritual. Evidently, then, such addresses to Shamash are to be viewed in no other light than the exaltation of Nusku in the * Maklu '
series, 1 and which we have found were in many cases elaborate,
beautiful in diction, and elevated in thought. So to give one more example a hymn addressed to the sun-god at the
setting, and which is especially interesting because of the metaphors chosen to describe the sun's course, is proved by the
colophon to be again an incantation. It belongs to a series
perhaps, indeed, to the same as the specimens furnished :
2
O sun-god in the midst 3 of heaven at thy setting, May the enclosure of the pure heaven greet thee,4
May the gate of heaven approach thee, May the directing god, the messenger who loves thee, direct thy way. In E-babbara, the seat of thy sovereignty, thy supremacy rises like the dawn. May A, the wife whom thou lovest, come before thee with joy ; May thy heart be at rest,5 May the glory of thy divinity be established for thee.
O Shamash ! warrior hero, may thou be exalted ;
O lord of E-babbara, as thou marchest, may thy course be directed, Direct thy path, march along the path fixed for thy course (?).
O Shamash ! judge of the world, director of its laws art thou.

specimens given. A more elaborate hymn to Sin will further
illustrate the conceptions current about this deity: l
O lord, chief of the gods, who on earth and in heaven alone is exalted. Father Nannar,2 lord of increase, chief of the gods, Father Nannar, heavenly lord, Father Nannar, moon-god, chief of the gods, Father Nannar, lord of Ur, chief of the gods, Father Nannar, lord of E-shir-gal,3 chief of the gods, Father Nannar, lord of the brilliant crescent, chief of the gods,
Father Nannar, whose sovereignty is brought to perfection, chief of the ' gods, Father Nannar, who passes along in great majesty, O strong Bull,4 great of horns, perfect in form, with long flowing beard 6

304 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
Father, begetter of everything, . . . Lord, proclaiming the decisions of heaven and earth, Whose command is not set aside, . . . and granting water l for all that has life. No god reaches to thy fullness. In heaven who is exalted ? Thou alone art exalted. On earth who is exalted ? Thou alone art exalted.
Thy strong command is proclaimed in heaven, and the Igigi prostrate themselves. Thy strong command is proclaimed on earth, and the Anunnaki kiss the
ground. Thy strong command on high, like a storm in the darkness, passes along, and nourishment streams forth.
When thy strong command is established on the earth, vegetation sprouts forth. Thy strong command stretches over meadows and heights, and life is increased.
Thy strong command produces right and proclaims justice to mankind. Thy strong command, through the distant heavens and the wide earth, extends to whatever there is. Thy strong command, who can grasp it ? Who can rival it ?
Lord, in heaven is [thy] sovereignty, on earth is thy sovereignty. Among the gods, thy brothers, there is none like thee.
O King of Kings, who has no judge superior to him, whose divinity is not surpassed by any other ! 2
A more perfect idealization of the mythological notions connected with the moon-god can hardly be imagined. The old
metaphors are retained, but interpreted in a manner that reflects higher spiritual tendencies. The moon is still figured as a bull, but it is the idea of strength that is extracted from
the picture and dwelt upon. The writer still thinks of the moon as an old man with flowing beard, but he uses the figure
to convey the impression of the brilliancy of the great orb. The influence of the moon upon the change of seasons, upon vegetation, a belief which the Babylonians shared with other
1 A reference perhaps to the supposed influence of the moon on the tides. 2 The rest of the hymn some dozen lines is too fragmentary to warrant translation.



THE PRAYERS AND HYMNS. 305
nations, leads the writer to extol the benign feelings of the
god towards mankind. The sun-god, through the glowing heat that he develops, becomes, as we have seen, the warrior and
even the destroyer, the consuming force. The moon-god is the benefactor of mankind who restores the energies of man weakened from the heat of the day. Nannar-Sin becomes the giver of life, whose mercies are extended to all. The gods and the
spirits follow the example of mankind in prostrating themselves before the great orb of night. The independence of
the course that he pursues in the heavens places him beyond
the control of the great judge of the world, the mighty Shamash. There is no one superior to Sin, no one to whose command he must bend. With all this, there is a total absence of
any allusion to his power of removing the influence of demons
and witches. We have here a hymn purified from all associa
tion with the incantation texts, and there is every reason to
believe that it was composed for use in the great temple at
Ur, which is mentioned in the opening lines. In the alternating question and answer we have also a valuable indication of the manner in which the hymn was to be recited
or sung. The whole production appears to be arranged in a
dialogue form, the lines to be alternately read by the reciting
priest and the chorus of priests or worshippers. The same method is followed in other productions, while in some, as we
shall see, the dialogue does not proceed in alternate lines, but
is distributed among a varying number of sections. We may
see in this style of composition one of the natural outcomes of
the method pursued in the incantation texts, where, as will be
remembered, the priest first recites the formulas, and then calls
upon the individual before him to repeat it once, twice, or oftener, as the case may be. Such a custom leads to recital
and responses in the hymns. Not many of the hymns rise to such a height as the one just
quoted. There were certain gods only, and after all not many,



306 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
whose nature was such as to make an ethical development of the conceptions formed of them possible. Besides Shamash and Sin, Ea as the god of humanity and Nebo as the god of wisdom belong
to this class. Of Ea, however, no hymns have as yet been found. This may of course be accidental, and still, if one bears in mind
that in the later periods of Babylonian history Ea enjoyed a theoretical popularity rather than a practical one, the absence
of Ea hymns might be explained as due to the lack of a fixed ritual in the Ea temples outside of the incantation texts. 1 Ea's
position, like that of Nusku, was too marked in the magical
texts to encourage a conception of them entirely independent of their power to release victims from the grasp of the demons.
A hymn to Nebo, which unfortunately is preserved only in part, illustrates the extent to which polytheistic conceptions may
be spiritualized :
2
. . . Lord of Borsippa,
. . . son of E-sagila. 3 O Lord ! To thy power there is no rival power,
O Nebo ! To thy power, there is no rival, To thy house, E-zida, there is no rival, To thy city, Borsippa, there is no rival, To thy district, Babylon, there is no rival. Thy weapon is U-sum-gallu,4 from whose mouth the breath does not issue, blood does not flow. 5 Thy command is unchangeable like the heavens. In heaven thou art supreme.
There are still plenty of mythological allusions in this hymn
that take us back to a primitive period of thought, but it is a hymn prompted by the love and reverence that Nebo inspired. Its direct connection with the Nebo cult is shown again by the

4 This weapon plays a part in some of the Babylonian myths. 5 The weapon is miraculous it kills instantly, but without causing blood to flow. The reference is to the lightning stroke.



THE PRAYERS AND HYMNS, 307
complementary character of each two lines. The whole hymn
was probably adapted in this way to public worship. Marduk, by virtue of his relationship to Ea, and by his inde
pendent position as the supreme god of Babylon, occupies a middle ground between Shamash, Ea, and Nusku on the one side, and such gods as Sin and Nebo on the other. Some of the hymns addressed to him end in incantations ; others form
part of the cult arranged for solemn occasions, when the praises of the god were sung in connection with sacrificial offerings.
In confirmation of the theory as to the relationship between
magical texts and hymns above advanced, we find scarcely any difference in the grade of religious thought between these two
classes of Marduk hymns. Both are equally distinguished by
their fine diction. A hymn which celebrates Marduk as the
restorer of the dead to life, and yet forms part of an incanta
tion text, reads :
l
O merciful one among the gods !
O merciful one who loveth to give life to the dead ! Marduk, king of heaven and earth,
King of Babylon, lord of E-sagila, King of E-zida, lord of E-makh-tila, Heaven and earth are thine. The whole of heaven and earth are thine,
The spell affording life is thine, The breath of life is thine, The pure incantation of the ocean 2 is thine, Mankind, the black-headed race,3 The living creatures, as many as there are, and exist on earth, As many as there are in the four quarters, The Igigi of the legions of heaven and earth, As many as there are, To thee do they incline (?). Thou art the shedu, thou art the lamassu,
Thou restorest the dead to life, thou bringest things to completeness (?).
O merciful one among the gods !

Cf. p. 281.



308 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION. .
One scarcely detects any difference between such a hymn and those to Sin and Nebo. The lines are adapted, like the
other specimens, for recitation by two parties. The last line
forms a solemn close to a section of this hymn. In the section that follows, the same character is maintained till we approach the close, when the exorciser steps in and asks Marduk to
Expel the disease of the sick man,
The plague, the wasting disease . . .
and the various classes of demons, utukku, alu, etc., are introduced.
Compare this now with some passages in a prayer addressed
to Marduk :
L
A resting-place for the lord (of E-sagila) is thy house.
A resting-place for the lord of E-makh-tila is thy house.
E-sagila, the house of thy sovereignty, is thy house. May the city speak ' rest ' 2 to thee thy house.
May Babylon speak peace to thee 3 thy house. May the great Anu, the father of the gods, tell thee when there will be rest. May the great mountain, the father of the gods,4 tell thee when there will be rest.
Look favorably upon thy house,
Look favorably upon the city, O lord of rest ! May he restore to his place the bolt Babylon, the enclosure E-sagila, the edifice E-zida,5 May the gods of heaven and earth speak to thee, O lord of rest.
Here we have specific references to Marduk. Everything about the city of Babylon is associated with the god. The
great gods pay homage to Marduk. The whole hymn, con
ceived as a royal prayer to the god, clearly formed part of the ritual prepared for the great Marduk temple at Babylon. The

THE PRAYERS AND HYMNS. 309
hymn closes, as so many others, with a prayer on behalf of the king. The god is asked
To establish firmly the foundation of the throne of his sovereignty, So that he may nourish (?) mankind to distant days.
*
Rest,' in the liturgical language, implied cessation of anger. Marduk, as the * lord of rest,' was the pacified deity ; and since it
was a necessary condition in obtaining an answer to petitions that the god should be free from anger, the city, the temple,
and the gods are represented as unitedly speaking to him appealing to him to be at ' rest.' The production might, therefore, be called a *
pacification hymn.' The god has shown his anger by bringing on misfortune of some shape. His divine associates are no less anxious than his human subjects to
pacify the mighty god. Passing on to another god, a hymn to the storm-god, Ramman, enables us to specify the great terror that the god, as the
general source of disturbances in the heavenly phenomena, inspired. The god is addressed l as
The lord who in his anger holds the heavens in his control, Ramman in his wrath the earth has shaken. The mighty mountain thou dost overturn it.
At his anger, at his wrath, The gods of heaven mount up to heaven,2 The gods of earth enter the earth. Into the foundation of heaven Shamash 3 enters.
The illustrations adduced will suffice to show the manner in
which the Babylonians conceived the relationship between mankind and the gods. The element of fear alternated with that of love, and no matter how near the gods were felt to be, one
was never certain of their good will.
Another feature of some of these hymns which calls for
special mention is the introduction of the deity as himself or

310 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
herself taking part in the dialogue. A hymn addressed to
Ishtar, as the morning and evening star, 1 belongs to this class. 2 It begins with a glorification of the goddess as the source of
light, of being, and of earthly blessings. The worshipper
speaks :
O light of heaven who arises like fire over the earth, who art fixed in the
earth, Thou art exalted in strength like the earth.
As for thee, a just path be graciously granted to thee When thou enterest the house of man. A hyena on the hunt for a young lamb art thou,
A restless lion art thou. A destructive handmaid, the beauty of heaven,
A handmaid is Ishtar, the beauty of heaven,
Who causest all being to emanate, O beauty of heaven,
Associate (?) of the sun, O beauty of heaven !
At this point the goddess speaks, through the officiating priest, who acts as the mediator :
For determining oracles 3 I have been established, in perfection have I been established.
For determining oracles of my father Sin, I have been established, in perfection have I been established. For determining oracles of my brother Shamash, I have been established, in perfection have I been established. Me has my father Sin fixed, to determine oracles I have been established, Shining anew in heaven, for determining oracles I have been established, in perfection have I been established.
From the regular repetition of the refrain at the end of each line, one is tempted to conclude that these utterances of the
goddess were to be recited by an officiating priest with the
assistance of a chorus of priests, to whom the refrain was
assigned, or it may be that the lines were alternately recited by

THE PRAYERS AND HYMNS. 311
the priest and the chorus. In the section that follows, this
alternative character of the lines is more clearly indicated :
Full of delight is my majesty, full of delight is my supremacy, Full of delight do 1 as a goddess walk supreme.
Ishtar, the goddess of morning am I, Ishtar, the goddess of evening am I, (1 am) Ishtar, to open the lock of heaven belongs to my supremacy. Heaven I destroy, earth I devastate, 1 such is my supremacy. The destroyer of heaven, the devastator of the earth, such is my majesty.
To rise up out of the foundation of heaven, Whose fame shines among the habitation of men, such is my supremacy. Queen of heaven that on high and below is invoked, such is my supre
macy. The mountain I sweep away altogether, such is my supremacy.
The destroyer of the mountain walls am I, their great foundation am I,
such is my supremacy.
The hymn closes with a prayer that the anger of the god be
appeased :
May thy heart be at rest, thy liver 2 be pacified. By the great lord Anu, may thy heart be at rest.
By the lord, the great mountain Bel, may thy liver be pacified.
O goddess, mistress of heaven, may thy heart be at rest.
O supreme mistress of heaven, may thy liver be pacified.
O supreme mistress of the E-anna,3 may thy heart be at rest.
O supreme mistress of the land of Erech, may thy liver be pacified.

CHAPTER XVIII.
PENITENTIAL PSALMS.
IT will be recalled that both in the Ishtar hymn and in the one
to Marduk above quoted, great stress is laid upon pacifying the
deity addressed. Starting from the primitive conception that misfortunes were a manifestation of divine anger, the Babylonians never abandoned the belief that transgressions could
be atoned for only by appeasing the anger of the deity. But within this limitation, an ethical spirit was developed among the
Babylonians that surprises us by its loftiness and comparative purity. Instead of having recourse merely to incantation
formulas, the person smitten with disease or pursued by ill
fortune would turn in prayer to some god at whose instigation
the evil has come and appeal for the pacification of the divine
wrath. But while the origin of the so-called penitential psalms is thus closely bound up with the same order of thought that
gave rise to the incantation texts, no less significant is the
divorce between the two classes of compositions that begins
already at an early stage of the literary period. The incantations, it is true, may be combined with compositions that be
long to a higher order of religious thought. We have seen that they have been so combined, and yet the dividing line between the two is also sharply marked. Zimmern, to whom,
more than to any one else, the interpretation of these penitential psalms is due, has suggested 1 that national misfortunes
rather than private grievances may have given an impetus to this class of literary productions. It is true that historical
references are found in some of the hymns, and it is also signifi

PENITENTIAL PSALMS. 313
cant that not only do these psalms occasionally embody a prayer for the king, thus giving to them a national rather
than a personal character, but the kings are called upon in times of distress to accompany their libations to the gods with
the recitation of a ' lament to quiet the heart,' l as the Babylo
nians called this class of hymns. One can easily see how such events as defeat in war would
be ascribed to divine wrath, and not to the workings of evil
spirits or witches ; and while the personal tone that pervades
most of the penitential psalms makes them applicable to conditions affecting the individual as well as the nation, the peculiar
fitness of such psalms for occasions of national importance was
a powerful factor in bringing about their sharp separation from the incantation formulas.
Just as in the hymns we found that the mere contemplation of the attributes of the gods, apart from the manifestation of
these attributes in any particular instance, led to a loftier
interpretation of the relationship existing between the gods and mankind, so the thought that evil was due in the last
instance to the anger of some god led to greater emphasis
being laid upon this relationship. The anger of the god prompted both the individual and the nation to greater zeal in
securing the deity's love. To an even greater extent than in the hymns is the element of love introduced into the penitential
psalms, and when not directly expressed, is so clearly implied as to form the necessary complement to the conception of the divine wrath. These psalms indeed show the religious
and ethical thought of Babylonia at its best. Their ethical
phase manifests itself more particularly in the conception of sin which is unfolded in them. The misfortunes of life, more especially those which could not so readily be ascribed to the
presence of evil spirits, filled the individual with his sense of guilt. In some way, known or unknown to him, he must have

314 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
offended the deity. The thought whether the deity was justified in exercising his wrath did not trouble him any more than the
investigation of the question whether the punishment was meted out in accordance with the extent of the wrong com
mitted. It was not necessary for the deity to be just ; it was
sufficient that some god felt himself to be offended, whether
through the omission of certain rights or through an error in
the performance of rites or what not. The two facts which
presented themselves with overpowering force to the penitent were the anger of the deity and the necessity of appeasing that anger. Beyond this conclusion the Babylonians and
Assyrians did not go, but this reasoning also sufficed to bring
the conviction home to him that his misfortunes were the result
of some offence. The man afflicted was a sinner, and the cor
ollary to this position was that misfortunes come in consequence of sin. Through the evils alone which overtook one, it became
clear to -an individual that he had sinned against the deity.
Within this circle of ideas the penitential psalms of Babylonia
move. They do not pass wholly outside of the general Semitic
view that sin is a 'missing 'of the mark,' a failure, whether
voluntary or involuntary, to comply with what was demanded by the deity under whose protection one stood. But one became conscious of having 'missed the mark' only when evil in
some form disease, ill luck, deluge, drought, defeat, destruc
tion, storms, pecuniary losses, family discords, the death of dear ones came to remind the individual or the nation of the
necessity of securing the favor of the deity again. Still within this sphere there were great possibilities of ethical progress, and some of the Babylonian psalms breathe a spirit and are couched in a diction that have prompted a comparison with the
Biblical psalms. 1 Thrown, as the sinner felt himself to be,
upon the mercy of the angry deity, it mattered little what had

PENITENTIAL PSALMS. 315
called forth this wrath or whether the deity was conceived as
acting in accordance with just ideas. The thought that would
engage the entire attention of the penitent would be the
appeasement of his god. To effect this, he would not stop short at exaggerating his own guilt. He would manifest a contrition of spirit that would not be the less sincere for being,
perhaps, out of proportion to the character of his sin when judged by our standards.
Corresponding to the humiliation of mind to which he would be brought, his longing to be reconciled to the offended deity would be intensified. He would address this deity in terms of
strong endearment, magnify his or her powers, as the case may be, and belittle himself and his own worth. The result of such
a mental discipline could not but react healthfully on the mind
of the penitent. The penitent would arise from his prayer
with a more spiritual conception of the relationship existing between himself and his god. Not appealing for any material benefits for the time being, but concerned only with appeasing
the divine wrath, the single burden of his prayer " that the
heart of the offended god might be ' at rest ' " would be marked
by an intensity all the stronger for being at least comparatively pure of grosser associations.
All these features combined serve to make the penitential
psalms the flower of the religious literature of Babylonia. The
productions not only represent the highest stage which religious thought reached in the Euphrates Valley, but, in a certain sense, constitute the only productions in cuneiform literature that have
a permanent literary value.
We find these compositions marked by a third feature which,
however, as we have already seen, is not peculiar to them, the dialogue form. In order to bring about a reconciliation
with an angered god, three personages were necessary in the
drama, the god, the penitent, and, thirdly, the priest, acting as mediator between the sinner and his deity. The deity, accord



316 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
ing to Babylonian notions, could not be approached directly, but only through his chosen messengers, the priests. This idea of mediation, as against the immediate approach, was so pronounced as to lead, as we have seen, to the frequent association with a god of a second divine personage, his son or
his servant, through whom the petitions of mankind were
brought to the throne of grace. 1 The priest was similarly conceived as the messenger of the god, and, by virtue of this office,
endowed with a certain measure, at least, of divine power. He
was, in the full sense, the god's vicar on earth, his repre
sentative, who could, as we saw in the Ishtar hymn, speak in the first person on behalf of the god. 2 The more manifest mission of the priest, however, was to intercede on behalf of
the mass of mankind. Accepting the sacrifices offered by the
laity, it was he that secured their gracious acceptance on the
part of the deity. It was the priest, as we have seen, who instructed the individual to pronounce the magic formulas that
would be appropriate to his case ; and just as in the incantation
texts the priest accompanied the recitation of the formulas
with an appeal of his own, so in the penitential psalms, he
stood at the penitent's side, instructing him what to say, and emphasizing the confessions of the penitent by an as
surance to the deity of the sincerity of the penitent, coupled with a fervent request that the prayer for '
appeasement,' which involved all that we mean by forgiveness, be graciously answered.
It is unfortunate that the text of none of the penitential
psalms is perfectly preserved. We must, therefore, content ourselves in our illustrations with more or less imperfect
extracts. It is to be noted, too, that often the exact meaning
1 Compare the relationship existing between Ea and Marduk, noted above, p. 276. Similarly, Nusku was the messenger to Bel. See p. 279. 2 On the wider aspects of this conception of the priest among ancient nations, see Frazer, The Golden Bough, passim.



PENITENTIAL PSALMS. 317
of the lines escapes us, owing to the obscurity of terms employed or to the gaps in the texts themselves. With few
exceptions the psalms appear in the double style characteristic
of so large a section of the religious literature of the Babylon
ians, the *
ideographic
' composition being accompanied by a phonetic transliteration. The fact, however, that we have at
least one text (IVR. 59, no. 2) in the phonetic style alone, is sufficient to show that no special weight is to be attached to
the supposed
'
bilingual
' character of the others. This double
style is not a feature that need be taken into account in deter
mining the age of this class of compositions. The historical
references in some of them have prompted Zimmern to give
his partial assent to the opinion which would assign them, or
some of them, to the age of Hammurabi. Beyond such references, which are not as clear as they might be, we have no data through which their age can be determined ; but so far as
-the ideas which they convey and the religious spirit manifested in them are concerned, there is no reason why they should not
be assigned to as early a period as some of the incantation
texts. It is characteristic of the Babylonian, as, in a measure,
of all religions, that the old and the new go hand in hand; that more advanced conceptions, so far from setting aside
primitive ones, can live and thrive in the same atmosphere
with the latter. We may, therefore, assume that penitential psalms existed as early as 2000 B.C. Whether any of these
that have been preserved go back to that period is another
question. One gains the impression from a careful study of them that most of these, if not all, belong to a somewhat later period, nearer to the first millenium than to the second mil
lenium before our era. The Assyrians adopted these psalms, as they did the other features of the religious literature of
the Babylonians, and enriched the collection by productions
of their own which, however, follow closely the Babylonian models.



318 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
A particularly beautiful psalm, judging from the portion preserved, represents the penitent addressing his goddess probably Ishtar as follows :
l
I, thy servant, full of sighs, call upon thee ; The fervent prayer of him who has sinned do thou accept. If thou lookest upon a man, that man lives.
O all-powerful mistress of mankind, Merciful one, to whom it is good to turn, who hears 2 sighs !
At this point the priest takes up the thread to emphasize the
appeal of the penitent by adding to it his own. He prays to the goddess:
His god and goddess being angry with him, he calls upon thee, Turn towards him thy countenance, take hold of his hand.
The penitent continues :
Besides thee, there is no guiding deity. I implore thee to look upon me and hear my sighs.
Proclaim pacification, 3 and may thy soul be appeased.
How long, O my mistress, till thy countenance be turned towards me. Like doves, I lament, I satiate myself with sighs.
The priest once more sums up the penitent's prayer:
With pain and ache, his soul is full of sighs; Tears he weeps, he pours forth lament (?).
A trait which appears in many of these psalms is the anonymity beneath which the offended deity is veiled. His or her
name is often not mentioned, the deity being simply referred to as god or goddess, and at times it is left doubtful whether the sinner has ' sinned '
against the demands of a god or a goddess, or against several deities. This feature is not without signifi

accepts.' 3 In the original appears a phrase which signifies literally
' when at last.' an abbreviation for ' when will there be rest,' and which has become a kind of technical
phrase to indicate, again, the hoped-for pacification of the deity.



PENITENTIAL PSALMS. 319
cance. In some cases, no doubt, the name of the specific deity was to be added by the penitent, 1 but in others this does not
appear to be indicated. The anonymity is the natural result
of the conception of sin involved in these productions. The sinner, becoming conscious of his guilt only as a conclusion drawn from the fact of his suffering from some misfortune,
could only surmise, but never be entirely certain, wherein his offence consisted or what deity he had offended. In the case
of the recital of incantation formulas, the question as to the
offended deity was a minor one, and may indeed, at an earlier stage of thought, not have entered into consideration at all.
This anonymity, therefore, which characterized the penitential psalms was not due to any advance in thought, but one can easily see how it led to such an advance. What may be called
the personal aspects of the gods were less accentuated. The
very fact that no particular god could in many cases be specified entailed, as a consequence, that the views held of the gods
gained in abstractness. The general thought of one's dependence upon these supernatural powers, without further specification, superinduced a grouping of the gods under a common aspect, as the directors of man's fate. In short, the notion of
deity, not indeed as a unit, but as a collective idea, begins to dawn in Babylonia. At the same time we must beware of exaggerating the force that this notion acquired. There is not
the slightest trace of any approach to real monotheism in Babylonia, nor can it even be said that the penitential psalms con
stitute a bridge leading to such an approach. The strong hold that astrology at all times, and up to the latest periods, had upon both the popular and the educated mind was in itself
sufficient to prevent the Babylonians from passing, to any considerable degree, beyond the stage in which the powers of nature were personified and imbued with real life. The peni
1 The colophon to one of them (IVR. 10, Reverse 52) declares that the production
in question is a " penitential psalm for any god whatsoever."



320 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
tential psalms presuppose this belief as much as any other
branch of the religious literature; they merely illustrate this belief in the purest form of which, in the course of its develop
ment, it was capable.
A psalm in which this anonymity of the offended god is
more strongly brought out begins as follows. 1 The penitent prays :
O that the wrath of my lord's heart return to its former condition, 2
O that the god who is unknown be pacified,
O that the goddess unknown be pacified,
O that the god known or unknown 3 be pacified,
O that the goddess known or unknown be pacified,
O that the heart of my god be pacified,
O that the god or goddess known or unknown be pacified !
The penitent, it will be seen, does not know whether it is a god or a goddess whom he has offended. He therefore appeals
to both. He goes on to say that he is not even aware of the sin that he has committed:
The sin that I have committed I know not.
And yet he must have sinned or he would not suffer as he
does. In addition to his confession, he imposes the hardship of fasting upon himself by way of penance :
Food I have not eaten ; Clear water I have not drunk.
The reference to fasting occurs so frequently in these psalms
that one is tempted to conclude that such a bodily castigation
was demanded by the ritual of the Babylonians :

' whoever he may be,' as we would say. 4 Among many nations fasting is resorted to as a means of atonement. It must have been common among the Hebrews during the period of the Babylonian exile perhaps through Babylonian influence. See Isaiah, Iviii. 3.

O lord, my sins are many, great are my transgressions, ( ) my god, my sins are many, great are my transgressions, my goddess, my sins are many, great are my transgressions,
Known or unknown god, my sins are many, great are my transgressions.
Again the sinner protests his innocence of the wrong he has
done. He only knows that
The lord has looked upon me in the rage of his heart,
A god has visited me in his wrath,
A goddess has become angry with me and brought me into pain,
A known or unknown god has oppressed me,
A known or unknown goddess has brought sorrow upon me. 1 seek for help, but no one takes my hand.
I weep, but no one approaches me. I call aloud, but no one hears me. Full of woe, I grovel in the dust without looking up. To my merciful god I turn, speaking with sighs.

To the known or unknown god do I speak with sighs, To the known or unknown goddess do I speak with sighs.
O lord, look upon me, accept my lament,
O goddess, look upon me, accept my lament,
O known or unknown goddess, look upon me, accept my lament !
In this strain he proceeds for some time, until he is inter
rupted by the priest, who briefly adds:
O lord, do not cast aside thy servant, Overflowing with tears,1 take him by the hand !
The penitent closes the prayer by another and still more earnest appeal:
The sin I have committed change to mercy,
The wrong I have done, may the wind carry off.
Tear asunder my many transgressions as a garment. My god, my sins are seven times seven,2 forgive me my sins.

The proportions between the parts taken by the priest and
penitent vary considerably. In the one quoted, the priest is only incidentally introduced ; in others, 2 it is the penitent who plays the minor part. The penitential ritual varied accordingly ; but since we cannot discover here, as we could in the case of the incantation texts, the special occasions for the
variations, except for those that contain historical references,
one must suppose that they could be used indifferently at the
choice of the penitent or the priest. It is probable that at one
time a large collection of such psalms was made in Babylonia, and that those we have represent compositions made from the
rituals of various temples. In one psalm we have a distinct
statement from which we may conclude that it belonged to the
E-sagila temple at Babylon. Only a portion of it is preserved. 3 It is interesting, also, because of a reference to a dream that it
contains, and which the god of Babylon is called upon to convert into a favorable sign for the petitioner. Zimmern is of
the opinion that the hymn may have been an evening prayer, but it seems more satisfactory to place it merely in the general category of penitential psalms, with a request for a sign that the deity has been appeased. The sinner, after describing his woeful state,
Instead of food, I eat bitter tears, Instead of date-wine, I drink the waters of misery,

proceeds to a fervent appeal :

My lord in mercy and compassion [look upon me ?]
Who guides the span of life against the encroachments (?) of death, accept my prayer ! my goddess, look upon me, accept my appeal ; May my sins be forgiven,2 my transgressions be wiped out. May the ban be loosened, the chain broken, May the seven winds carry off my sighs.
Let me tear away my iniquity, let the birds carry it to heaven, Let the fish take off my misfortune, the stream carry it off. May the beasts of the field take it away from me,
The flowing waters of the stream wash me clean. Let me be pure like the sheen of gold.
As a ring (?) of precious stone, may I be precious before thee. Remove my iniquity, save my soul. Thy [temple] court I will watch, thy image (?) I will set up.3 Grant to me that I may see a favorable dream,

Let me enter into E-sagila, the temple of the gods, the house of life. Commend me to Marduk, the merciful one, for favor, 1 will be subservient to thy greatness, I will exalt thy divinity.
There follows a line from which one may further conclude
that the psalm is one composed for the royal chief of

similarly, " Food I have not eaten, weeping is my nourishment, water I have not drunk, tears are my drink."

' released.' The underlying metaphor represents the individual held fast by sin, just as the demons seize hold of a man. 3 A somewhat puzzling line, but which appears to convey the promise on the part of the penitent that if forgiven he will observe the rites demanded by the deity.

Babylonia. It is evidently only a ruler who can assure the
deity that
The inhabitants of my city, 1 may they glorify thy power.
We know from the historical texts that previous to a military
engagement the kings were particularly desirous of some sign from the deity that might serve to encourage the soldiery. Such a sign was ordinarily a dream. The circumstances,
therefore, seem to point to our psalm being a royal prayer for forgiveness of transgressions, uttered before some impending national crisis, in the hope of securing, with the divine pardon,
the protection of the deity who, up to this point in the campaign, must have manifested his displeasure rather than his
favor. More distinct references to national events are found
in another royal penitential psalm :
2
How long, O my mistress, will the mighty foe oppress thy land, In thy great city Erech famine has settled, In E-ulbar, the house of thy oracle, blood is poured out like water,
Throughout thy districts he has kindled conflagrations, and poured [fire] over them in columns (?).3
O my mistress, I am abundantly yoked to misfortune, my mistress, thou hast encompassed me, thou hast brought me into pain,
The mighty foe has trodden me down as a reed, 1 have no judgment, I have no wisdom, Like a '
dry field ' I am desolate night and day, I thy servant beseech thee,
May thy heart be at rest, thy liver be pacified.
At times specific requests are inserted into these hymns, such as release from physical ills. Sickness being, as any other evil, due to divine anger, the sicfc man combines with his
prayer for forgiveness of the sin of which he is guilty, the hope that his disease, viewed as the result of his sin, may be removed.

PENITENTIAL PSALMS. 325
A hymn addressed to Ishtar of Nineveh by Ashurnasirbal, a
king of Assyria, 1 is of this character. It begins by an adora
tion of the goddess, who is addressed as
The producer, the queen of heaven, the glorious lady, To the one who dwells in E-babbara . . . who hath spread my fame,
To the queen of the gods to whom has been entrusted the commands of
the great gods, To the lady of Nineveh . . To the daughter of Sin, the twin-sister of Shamash, ruling over all kingdoms,
Who issues decrees, the goddess of the universe, To the lady of heaven and earth, who receives prayer, who hearkens to the
petition, who accepts beseeching, To the merciful goddess who loves righteousness.
The king calls upon Ishtar to listen to his prayers :
Look upon me, O lady, so that through thy turning towards me the heart of thy servant may become strong.
Ashurnasirbal appeals to the goddess on the ground of what
he has done to promote the glory of the goddess in his land.
He has devoted himself to the service of the goddess. He has observed the festivals in her honor. He has repaired her
shrines. No less than fourteen images of the goddess were set
up by the king. Nay, more, he claims that before his days
Ishtar was not properly worshipped.
I was without understanding, and did not pray to thy ladyship, The people of Assyria also lacked judgment, and did not approach thy divinity ;
But thou, O Ishtar, mighty weapon of the great gods, By thy grace 2 thou didst instruct me, and didst desire me to rule.
The statement that the Ishtar cult was introduced or even
reinstated by Ashurnasirbal can hardly be taken literally ; but

it distinctly points to a movement in the days of the dynasty to which the king belonged, that brought the worship of the goddess into great prominence. In return for all that he has done to the house of Ishtar,
the king pleads :
I, Ashurnasirbal, full of affliction, thy worshipper,
Who takes hold of thy divine staff,
Who prays to thy sovereignty, Look upon me and let me appeal to thy power ! May thy liver be appeased for that which has aroused thy anger ; Let thy whole heart be strong towards me. Make my disease come forth and remove my sin,
Let thy mouth, O lady, proclaim forgiveness. The priestly vassal who worships thee without change, Grant him mercy and cut off his affliction.
The historical references found in the penitential psalms are
valuable indications, not only for determining the age of these
compositions, but for ascertaining the occasions on which they were employed. Neither the Babylonian nor the Assyrian rulers ever reveal to us in their official annals or dispatches
any check that they may have encountered in their careers or any misfortune that may have occurred to them or to the state.
These psalms tell their own story. They point to seasons of distress, when recourse had to be taken to appeals to the gods, accompanied by the confession of wrongs committed. As against the incantations which are the outcome of the purely
popular spirit, and which are the natural expression of popular
beliefs, the penitential psalms seem to represent a more official method of appealing to the gods. The advance in religious
thought which these productions signal may, therefore, be due, in part at least, to a growing importance attached to the relation
ship existing between the gods and the kingdom as a whole, as
against the purely private pact between a god and his worshippers. The use of these psalms by Assyrian rulers, among



PENITENTIAL PSALMS. 327
whom the idea of the kingdom assumes a greater significance than among the Babylonians, points in this direction. It is sig
nificant, at all events, that such psalms were also produced in Assyria ; and while they are entirely modeled upon the earlier
Babylonian specimens, the contribution to the religious literature thus made in the north must be regarded, not as the
outcome of the extension of the literary spirit prevailing in
Babylonia, but as prompted by a special significance attached to the penitential ritual in removing the obstacles to the
advancement of the affairs of state.
Despite, therefore, the elevated thought and diction found in these psalms, there is a close bond existing between them and the next branch of the religious literature to be taken up, the oracles and omens, which similarly stand in close contact
with affairs of state, and to which, likewise, additions, and indeed, considerable additions, to the stock received from
Babylonia were made by the Assyrian literati.



CHAPTER XIX.
ORACLES AND OMENS.
A STRONG element of magic, we have seen, was always present in the hymns and prayers of the Babylonians, and even in such as contained religious sentiments of an elevated and pure char
acter. The finest prayer has almost invariably tacked on to it
an incantation, or constitutes in itself an incantation. Accom
panying the prayer were offerings to the deity addressed, or
certain symbolical rites, or both, and the efficacy of the prayer was supposed to reside partly in the accompanying acts and partly in the mystic power of the words of the prayer as such.
In large measure this indissoluble association of prayer and incantation is due to the circumstance that both Babylonians
and Assyrians addressed their deities only when something was
desired of the latter, the warding off of some evil or the
expectation of some favor. Even in the penitential psalms, that merit the term '
sublime,' the penitent pours out his soul at the shrine of grace in order to be released from some misfortune
that has come over him or that is impending. Mere praise of the gods without any ulterior motive finds no place in the
Babylonian or Assyrian ritual. The closest approach to this religious attitude may perhaps be seen in the prayers attached
by the kings to their commemorative or dedicatory inscriptions. One feels that the rulers are impelled to do this from a certain
sense of love and devotion to their protecting deities. Nebu
chadnezzar's prayers form a conspicuous example of the strength which pure love and attachment to the gods acquired in Babylonia; but even in these specimens, a request of some kind
usually for long life and prosperity is made. The spirituali



ORACLES AND OMENS. 329
zation of the Babylonian religion has in this way most definite
limitations imposed upon it. There is a point beyond which it
could not go without giving rise to a totally changed conception of the gods and their relationship to men. Prayer in its higher form, as the result of an irresistible prompting of the emotions, without any other purpose than the longing to come into closer communion with a superior Power, involves such a change in
religious conceptions, and hence is conspicuous in the Babylonian ritual by its absence.
A request of some kind being thus the motive that lies
behind the Babylonian prayers, it follows that the means taken to ascertain the will or intention of the gods with regard
to that request formed an essential feature of the ritual. Indeed,
to ascertain the will of a deity constituted one of the most
important functions of the priest perhaps the most important function. The prayer was of no use unless it was answered, and the priest alone could tell whether the answer was afforded.
The efforts of the priest were accordingly directed towards
this end the prognostication of the future. What was the
intention of the deity ? Would the hoped-for deliverance from evil be realized ? Would the demon of disease leave the body ?
Would the symbolical acts, burning of effigies, loosening of knots, and the like, have the desired effect ? Upon the success of the
priest in performing this function of prognostication everything depended, both for himself and for the petitioner.
The natural and indeed necessary complement to the priest as exerciser is the priest as the forecaster of the future.
Since no one, not even the king, could approach a deity directly, the mediation of the priest was needed on every occasion of a
religious import. The ordinary means at the disposal of the priest for ascertaining the divine will or caprice were twofold,
directly through oracles or indirectly by means of omens
derived from an examination of the sacrifices offered. A com
plete Babylonian ritual therefore required, besides the appeal



330 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
made by the petitioner through the priests or with their assistance, an incantation introduced in some form, an offering,
certain symbolical acts and omens. The offerings and the
symbolical acts, as a matter of fact, appear to have preceded 1
the prayer and the incantation, but in the prayers they are
referred to again, and generally just before the interpretation of the omens. The omens constituted the ulterior end in view.
Because of the looked-for omens the offering was brought, the
symbolical acts performed, the incantations recited. All these
rites formed the preparation for the grand finale. The wor
shipper waited anxiously for the decision of the priest. Attached, therefore, to the prayers we frequently find directions intended for the priests as to the signs to which his attention should be
directed, certain peculiarities exhibited in parts of the animal sacrificed from which certain conclusions may be drawn. The observation of these signs grows to the dimensions of a science
equal in extent to the observation of the heavenly bodies whose movements, as indeed the whole of the natural world, were supposed to exert an influence over the fate of mankind.
It does not of course follow that in the case of every prayer an elaborate ritual was observed. Many of the prayers to the
gods in their present form do not embody omens, as indeed
many contain no reference to offerings - or symbolical acts. While no conclusion can be drawn from this circumstance, since the omission may be due to the point of view from which
in a given case a collection of prayers was made by the priest,
still we may well believe that for the exorcising of evil spirits the utterance of sacred formulas was often considered quite
sufficient. In the earlier stages of the Babylonian religion the priest's function may have ended when he had exorcised the demons by means of magic words. The demons were forced to yield. If they nevertheless held out, so much the worse for
them or for the priest, who, it was concluded, must have lost

his power over the spirits through some error committed by
him. The resort to omens has wider aspects, as will presently be shown, than the connection with prayers and offerings, and a most reasonable view is that omens were first introduced
into prayers on occasions when a worshipper wished to
ascertain the will of a deity for a certain purpose, and
to regulate his own conduct accordingly. In petitioning the deity a sacrifice was naturally offered. Through the sacrifice, which was rendered acceptable to the deity by the mediation
of the priest, the desired answer to a question was obtained. From being resorted to in such instances, omens would naturally come to form part of the ritual for almost any occasion when a deity was appealed to, both in connection with incantations and symbolical acts when the omens would form a
supplement to the magic element in the ritual, as well as in cases where no specific incantations are introduced. In both
cases the omens would constitute the means resorted to for
ascertaining whether the petitioner might look for a favorable
reply to a request proffered or, in a more general way, find out anything that it may be important for him to know. The occa
sions for consulting the deity would be of a public or private
character. How far it became customary for the general public to secure the mediation of a priest for securing aid from the
gods in matters appertaining to personal welfare we have no
means of definitely determining. We find, for example, a son consulting an oracle on behalf of his father in order to ascer
tain what day would be favorable for undertaking some building
operation, 1 and he receives the answer that the fourth of the
month will be propitious; and so there are other occasions on
which private individuals consult the priests, but in general it
was only on occasions of real distress that an individual would
come to the sanctuary, to seek relief from bodily ills, to ward
off blows of adversity, to pacify a deity who has manifested his

or her displeasure. The expense involved for the worshipper was not to appear empty-handed would of itself act as a
deterrent against too frequent visits to a sanctuary. The public welfare occupied a much larger share in the
Babylonian worship. In order to ensure the safety of the state,
occasions constantly arose when the deities had to be consulted,
It is no accident that so many of the prayers the hymns and psalms contain references to kings and to events that tran
spired during their reigns. In these references the occasions
for the prayers are to be sought. Remarkable as is the expression which the consciousness of individual guilt finds
in the religious literature of Babylonia, the anger of the deity against his land is much more prominently dwelt upon than the manifestation of his wrath towards an individual. It could not
be otherwise, since the welfare of the state conditioned to so
large an extent the happiness of the individual. The startling
phenomena of nature, such as an eclipse, a flood, a storm, while affecting individuals were not aimed directly at them, but
at the country viewed as the domain of a certain god or of cer
tain gods. Blighted crops, famine, and pestilence had likewise a public as well as a private aspect. On all such occasions the
rulers would proceed to the sanctuaries in order, with the assis
tance of the priests, to pacify the angered god. It was not sufficient at such times to pronounce sacred formulas, to make
fervent appeals, but some assurances had to be given that the words and the symbolical acts would have the desired effect. Omens were sought for from the animals offered. There were other occasions besides those stated, when for the sake of the public welfare oracles were sought at the sanctuaries.
If a public improvement was to be undertaken, such as the
building of a palace, or of a temple, of a canal,' or a dam, it was of the utmost importance to know whether the enterprise
was acceptable to the deity. A day had to be carefully chosen for laying the foundations, when the god would be favorably

disposed towards his subjects, the kings under whose auspices such work was carried on. Similar precautions had to be taken to select a favorable day for the dedication. This again
was determined by means of omens either derived from offerings
or in some other way. The Babylonians and Assyrians believed, as did the Jews upon their return from the Babylonian exile, that
' unless the lord assists, the builders work in vain.' When we
come to military campaigns where the individual disappears
altogether in the presence of the majestic figure of the state, the will and disposition of the gods had to be consulted at every
step, regarding the plans of the enemy, at the enemy's approach, before the battle, in the midst of the fray, and at its
termination. The frequency with which the gods were approached in the
interests of the state and the public weal, plied with questions upon which the fate of the land depended, is shown by the
stereotyped form which such official solicitations in the course
of time acquired. Dating from the reigns of Esarhaddon and Ashurbanabal we have an elaborate series of prayers addressed
to the sun-god, all dealing with questions of a political import. These prayers, so admirably edited and analyzed by Knudtzon, 1 are all arranged according to a single pattern. Each one opens with a question or series of questions which Shamash, the sungod, is asked to answer. The god is then implored not to
be angry, but to lend his aid against any errors unwittingly committed in the sacrificial rites. For a second time the same
question is put in a somewhat varying form. Another appeal is made, and the various omens derived from the inspection of
animals are interpreted as a guide to the priests. According to the application of these omens to the sacrifice before the priest,
a decision is rendered. It will be sufficient for our purposes to
present a single specimen of such a fixed ritual. 2

Esarhaddon, being hard pressed by a group of nations to the northeast of Assyria, led by a certain Kashtariti, and among whose followers the Gimirrites, the Medes, and Manneans are the most prominent, asks for an oracle from Shamash as to the
outcome of the situation. The priest, acting as mediator, addresses 1 the god:
Shamash ! great lord ! As I ask thee, do thou in true mercy answer me. From this day, the 3d day of this month of lyar 2 to the nth day of
the month of Ab 3 of this year, a period of one hundred days and one hun
dred nights is the proscribed term for the priestly activity.4 Will within this period, Kashtariti, together with his soldiery, will the army of the Gimirrites, the army of the Medes, will the army of the Manneans, or will any enemy whatsoever succeed in carrying out their plan, whether by strategy (?) or by main force, whether by the force of weapons of war and fight or by the ax, whether by a breach made writh machines of war and battering rams 5 or by hunger, whether by the power residing in the name of a god or goddess,6 whether in a friendly way or by friendly grace,7 or by any strategic device, will these aforementioned, as many as are required to take a city, actually capture the city Kishsassu, penetrate into the interior of that same city Kishsassu, will their hands lay hold of that
same city Kishsassu, so that it falls into their power ? Thy great divine power knows it.8 The capture of that same city, Kishsassu, through any enemy whatsoever, within the specified period, is it definitely ordained by thy great and
divine will, O Shamash ! Will it actually come to pass? 9
1 That the priest recites the prayer and not the king is shown by the frequent
introduction of the king's name in the 3d person. See, e.g., Knudtzon, nos. 40-47. 2 2d month. 3 5th month. 4 /.., the priest is only asked for an oracle regarding the events of the next one hundred days. 5 Various machines are mentioned.

ORACLES AND OMENS. 335
It will be observed that, much as in a legal document, all contingencies are enumerated. In other prayers, still more are
mentioned. A definite answer is required, and care is taken
not to leave any loophole open by means of which the deity
may escape from the obligation imposed upon him to manifest his intention. Shamash might answer that the city will not be
captured, with the mental reservation that it will surrender, or
he might throw Esarhaddon off his guard 'by announcing that
" not by might nor by strength " will the city be taken, and the king may be surprised some morning to learn that the catastro
phe has been brought about through the power residing in the ' word.' These precautions were taken, not so much because
it was supposed that the gods and priests were tricky, but because all conditions had to be carefully fulfilled in order to
ensure an answer, and, if at all possible, of course a favorable answer. To the same end, great care had to be taken, that in
the preparation of the offering which accompanied the prayer no mistake should be made. The sacrificial animal in the
case before us a lamb had to be guarded against all imper
fections, impurities, and contaminations. The priest had to be
careful to put on the proper dress, to speak the proper words, and to be himself free from any ritualistic impurity. Before
proceeding to the inspection of the animal, in order to forecast
the future, the priest had to take care that nothing might happen to interfere with the proper observation of the rites. This sec
tion of the prayer is characterized by the word "ezib" repeated
at the beginning of every line, and which conveys the appeal that what follows may be precluded from happening. 1 The
priest first prays to Shamash :
Preclude that after the specified period [the catastrophe may not come to pass],
1 Knudtzon (p. 25) did not grasp the negative force of ezib. The word is a request that something might not happen.



336 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
Preclude whatever they [i.e., the enemies] may plan may not be carried
out (?), Preclude them from making a slaughter and from plundering. . . . Whether the decision of this day be good or bad, ward off a stormy day with pouring rain.
This last phrase, which is somewhat obscure, seems to be a
request made in the contingency of an unfavorable omen being received. The sun-god is asked, at all events, not to hide his countenance under clouds and rain on the decisive day of battle.
Coming after these preliminary requests to the sacrifice, the priest continues:
Prevent anything unclean from defiling the place of inspection,1 Prevent the lamb of thy divinity, which is to be inspected, from being imperfect and unfit. Guard him who takes hold of the body of the lamb, who is clothed in the
proper sacrificial dress, from having eaten, drunk, or handled anything unclean.
Make his hand firm (?), guard the seer, thy servant, from speaking a word
hastily. 2
The priest thereupon repeats his question to the sun-god :
I ask thee, O Shamash ! great lord ! whether from the 3d day of this
month of lyar, up to the nth day of the month of Ab of this year, Kashtariti, with his soldiers, whether the Gimirrites, the Manneans, the Medes, or whether any enemy whatsoever will take the said city, Kishsassu, enter that said city, Kishsassu, seize said city, Kishsassu, with their hands, obtain it in their power.
The various terms used in describing the taking of a city are
once more specified, so as to fulfill all the demands of definite
ness in the question.
1 Where the animal is to be inspected, probably the altar itself. 2 In the Jewish ritual and many others, stress is laid upon pronouncing the words
of a prayer clearly and deliberately, especially such words as have a particularly sacred value.



ORACLES AND OMENS. 337
The priest is now ready to proceed with an examination of
the animal before him. A varying list of omens are introduced
into the prayers under consideration. That they are so intro
duced is a proof of the official character of these texts. The
omens were not, of course, intended to be recited. They are enumerated as a guide to the priests. The various signs that may be looked for are noted, and according to what the priest finds he renders his decision. Knudtzon has made the obser
vation l that in the prayers published by him, the signs found on the animal are noted but not interpreted. This rather curi
ous omission is again naturally accounted for on the assumption
that these prayers in their present form are part of a ritual com
piled solely for the benefit of priests attached to a Shamash
sanctuary. Full directions were not required. All that the priest needed was to know what to look for. For the rest, he
depended upon tradition or his own knowledge or judgment. The omens themselves, or rather the signs, refer to the condi
tion in which certain parts of the animal are found or to
peculiarities in the composition of the. animal. The priest is instructed to observe whether ' at the nape on
the left side ' there is a slit ; whether ' at the bottom on the left
side of the bladder.' some peculiarity 2 is found or whether it is
normal ; whether 'the nape to the right side' is sunk and split or
whether the viscera are sound. The proportions, too, in the size
of the various parts of the body appear to have been of moment ;
and in this way, a large number of points are given to which the
priest is to direct his attention. From a combination of all pecu
liarities and signs in a given instance, he divines the disposition of the god addressed, whether it is favorable or not. The whole
ceremony is brought to a close by another appeal to the god to send an answer to the question put to him. The priest prays :
1 Assyrische Gebete, p. 50. 2 Exactly of what nature cannot be ascertained. The text (Knudtzon, no. 29, rev. 15) is defective at this point.



338 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
By virtue of this sacrificial lamb, arise and grant true mercy, favorable conditions of the parts of the animal, a declaration favorable and beneficial beordained by thy great divinity. Grant that this may come to pass. To
thy great divinity, O Shamash ! great lord ! may it 1 be pleasing,2 and may an oracle be sent in answer!
In some of the prayers a second series of omen indications
are given. What the oracle announced we are, of course, not
told. The ritual is not concerned with results.
From the analysis just given it will be seen that the consul
tation of a deity was often entailed with much ceremony. No
doubt the priests did all in their power to add to the solemnity of such an occasion. The kings on their side showed their
lavishness in furnishing victims for the sacrifice. Again and again does Esarhaddon solicit Shamash to reveal the outcome
of the military campaigns in which the king was engaged. The same individual, Kashtariti, and the Gimirrites, Medes, etc., are mentioned in many other prayers prepared in the course of the
campaign ; and elsewhere other campaigns are introduced. What Esarhaddon did, no doubt his successors also did, as he himself
followed the example set by his predecessors. We are justified, then, in concluding that a regular
' oracle and omen ritual ' was
developed in Babylonia and Assyria how early it is of course impossible to say. There is every reason to believe that in some form such a ritual existed in Babylonia before the rise of
Assyria, but it is also evident that in a military empire like
Assyria, there would be more frequent occasion for securing
oracles than in Babylonia. The ritual may therefore have been
carried to a greater degree of perfection in the north. The
Assyrian conquerors, if we may judge from examples, were fond of asking for an oracle at every turn in the political situation.
The king intends to send an official to a foreign land, but he is
uncertain as to the wisdom of his decision. Accordingly, he

puts the case before the god. If this decision is taken, he
asks, Will the envoy carry out the orders of the king?
Thy great divinity knows it. Is it commanded and ordained by thy great divinity,
O Shamash ? Is it to come to pass ? l
In a similar way, questions are asked with reference to the
course of a campaign. Will the Assyrian king encounter the
king of Ethiopia, and will the latter give battle ? Will the king
return alive from the campaign ? is a question frequently asked.
Even for their quasi-private affairs, the kings sought for an
oracle. Before giving his daughter in marriage to a foreign potentate, Esarhaddon desires to know whether the one seek
ing this favor, Bartatua, tke king of Ishkuza,2
is to be trusted, will he fulfill his promises, will he observe the decrees of Esarhaddon, the king of Assyria, and execute them in good faith ?
Again, when the king is about to associate his son with him
self in the government, he first inquires whether this is agreeable
to the deity.
3 The king fears lest his son may cause trouble,
may provoke dissensions. Past experience prompts him to be careful before following his inclination.
Is the entrance of Siniddinabal, the son of Esarhaddon, the king of Assyria, whose name is written on this tablet, into the government in accord with the command of thy great divinity ? Is it to come to pass ?
The reference to the writing of the name is interesting. It
would appear that the question is actually written by the priest and placed before the deity. -The Greeks similarly put their
questions to the Delphian oracle in writing. May it be that among the Babylonians the answer of the god was at times also

handed down on a tablet, as the Greek and Roman oracles were communicated in writing on the leaves of a tree ?
If sickness entered the royal house, an oracle was likewise
sought. The king is sick. Is it ordained that he will recover?
We are told in one case that l
Nika, the mother of Esarhaddon, the king of Assyria, is sick. She sees the hand of the goddess Nana of Uruk laid heavily upon her. ... Is it ordained that this hand will be lifted off from the sufferer ?
The occasions, it is evident, were exceedingly numerous when the Assyrian rulers appealed to the priests for oracles. Naturally, this appeal was not in all cases made with the elaborate
formality illustrated by Esarhaddon's petitions to Shamash. At times the monarch, as the individual, would content himself
with sending to the priest for an answer to a question, and the
priest would reply in an equally simple and direct manner.
Quite a number of such messages, sent by priests to their mas
ter, are included in thevaluablepublication of *
Assyrian Letters,' begun by Professor R. F. Harper.2 The king's son wishes to
set out on a journey. The father sends to the astrologers
Balasi and Nabu-akheirba, and receives the reply: 3
As for Ashur-mukinpalea, about whom the king, our lord, has sent to us, may Ashur, Bel, Nabu, Sin, Shamash, and Ramman bless him. May the king, our lord, witness his welfare (?). Conditions are favorable for the journey. The second day is favorable, the fourth day very favorable.
Similarly, the astrologers send reports regarding the appearance and position of the moon and the stars, and of various phenomena that had to be taken into account in moments where decisive action had to be taken.

ORACLES AND OMENS. 341
Before leaving the subject, it may be of interest to point out
that among the literary remains of the Assyrian period there
are " blank formulas " for oracles, the names in each instance
to be filled out by the officiating priest. Such formulas were
prepared, no doubt, for cases of common occurrence. Thus
Esarhaddon, before appointing a person to a responsible position, took the precaution of ascertaining from some deity whether the appointment was a wise one. The name of the
individual being written down, the priest asks the deity in a
general way: 1
Will the man whose name appears on this tablet, and whom he [the king] is about to appoint to such and such a position, keep good faith, or will he manifest hostility towards the king, inciting to rebellion ?
Esarhaddon may have had a special reason for using precau
tions against his officials, and even his sons. He came to the throne during a rebellion which involved the assassination of his father. Esarhaddon's own brothers were the murderers.
We may well suppose that he trembled at every step he took, but his position is after all characteristic of the Assyrian rulers
in general, many of whom came to the throne by violence and maintained themselves through force.
Other texts enable us to study the form of the oracles them
selves. As yet, no oracle texts have been found belonging to
the older Babylonian period, but we have again every reason to believe that what holds good for the days of Assyrian power
applies to a much earlier period, though at the same time the
greater frequency with which Assyrian rulers were wont to ply their gods with questions would increase the number of those
whose special business it was to pronounce the oracles. The manifold duties of the priesthood would tend towards a differentiation of the priests into various classes. The priest, as
exerciser, would become distinct from the priest as the inspector
1 E.g., Knudtzon, no. 124.



342 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIA tf RELIGION.
of omens, and the latter different again from the pronouncer of
oracles. From the fact that Marduk was regarded as the
special god of oracles by the Assyrians as well as the Babylonians, 1 we may conclude that this differentiation of the priestly
classes took place already in the south, or at all events that
oracle-giving as a distinct priestly function was recognized in Babylonia and carried over to the northern empire. If we may draw a general conclusion from the state of affairs in Esarhad
don's days, this function was largely in the hands of women. We know from other evidence that women were attached to the
temple service from ancient times. 2 As sorceresses, too, they
occupied a quasi-priestly position, since their help could be invoked in driving evil spirits into the person of one's enemy. The oracle-giver and the sorcerer or sorceress are correlated
personages in religion. For various reasons in part, perhaps, because of her physical differences from man woman was invested with a certain mystery by ancient nations. 3 Hence the
fact that among so many nations witchcraft is associated with
woman, and similarly among many nations women perform the functions of the oracle. In a series of eight oracles addressed
to Esarhaddon, 4 six are given forth by women. These oracles, it so happens, all issue from the goddess Ishtar of Arbela. The
cult of this goddess at Arbela stood in high favor in the eighth
century B.C. An influential body of priests congregated there, and the eight oracles in question appear to be a part of a more extensive collection made by the theologians of Arbela, of whose
intellectual activity there are other traces. Arbela appears to
have developed a special school of theology, marked by the attempt to accord a superior position to the great goddess Ishtar.
1 Zimmern, Busspsalmen, p. 32. The popularity of the sun-cult in Assyria in connection with omens and oracles is probably due also in part to the influence of Marduk, who was, as we have seen, a solar deity. 2 Lehman, Samassumukin, p. 42. 3 See Floss, Das Weib, pp. 594-606; also above, p. 267. 4 IV R. pi. 61.



ORACLES AND OMENS. 343
The one who pronounces the oracle speaks on behalf of
Ishtar, and therefore employs the first person. The oracles all
have reference to political events. They cannot, of course, be the answers to the questions asked in the prayers analyzed above, since these were addressed to the sun-god; but we may
feel certain that the oracles of the Shamash priests or priest
esses were much of the same order, varying only in minor
particulars. The goddess invariably encourages the king. The priest, it would appear, hears the voice of the deity in the wind.
Fear not ! The wind which speaks to thee
Comes with speech from me, withholding nothing.1 Thine enemies, like the ... of Siwan,2 . At thy feet will be poured out. The great mistress am I. I am Ishtar of Arbela, who forces thine enemies to submission. Is there any utterance of mine that I addressed to thee upon which thou couldst not rely ? I am Ishtar of Arbela. Thine enemies, the Ukkites (?), I give to thee, even I, Ishtar of Arbela. In front and behind thee I march. Fear not !
This oracle, we are told in the subscript, was pronounced by
a certain Ishtar-la-tashiat, a son [/>., a native] of Arbela. The dignity of the diction is very marked. The very frequent assurance ' fear not ' and the solemn repetition of * I am Ishtar ' lend
impressiveness to the message. The oracle, it will be seen, deals in general phrases. This indefiniteness characterizes
most of them ; and the more impressive the diction, the greater vagueness in the statements made. So an oracle, coming from Ishtar and Nabu and uttered by a woman Baya, a native of Arbela, announces :
1 /.., Ishtar sends the wind with a clear message. 2 3d month.



344 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
Fear not, Esarhaddon,
I, the lord, to thee do I speak. The beams of thy heart I strengthen as thy mother,1
Who gave thee life.
Sixty great gods are with me 2 Drawn up to protect thee. The god Sin is on thy right, Shamash on thy left. Sixty great gods are round about thee Drawn up in battle array in the center of the citadel. On men do not rely. Lift up thine eyes to me. Look up to me !
I am Ishtar of Arbela. Ashur is gracious to thee. Thy weakness I will change to strength (?).
Fear not ! glorify me ! Is not the enemy subdued
Who has been handed over to thee ?
I proclaim it aloud, What has been will be.3 I am Nabu, the lord of the writing tablet,
Glorify me.
A message of this kind could hardly have been satisfactory except as a general encouragement. The popularity of the Nabu cult in Assyria, it will be recalled, is an offset against the supremacy of Marduk in the south. The
Assyrian kings found it to their interest to incorporate as much
of the Babylonian cult as was possible into their own religious ritual. To Shamash they assigned the role played by Marduk.
There was no danger in paying homage to Nabu, the son of Marduk. Ishtar they regarded as their own goddess quite as much as Ashur. These four deities, therefore, Ishtar, Shamash, Nabu, and Ashur, are the special gods of oracles recognized by the Assyrian rulers. Marduk, who is the chief source of oracles

in the south, is more rarely appealed to in the north, though of
course recognized as powerful. He could not be expected to regard with favor an empire that so seriously threatened his
supremacy in the pantheon. The occasion when an oracle was announced was often one
of great solemnity. Just as the prayers in which the questions of the kings were embodied, were carefully written out, so that
the priest in reciting them might not commit any mistakes, so the answer to the prayers were transmitted to the king in writ
ing. Among the oracles of the days of Esarhaddon, there is one coming from Ashur in which the ceremonies accompanying the deliverance are instanced. 1 The oracle deals with the Gimir
rites, the same people in regard to whom Esarhaddon so
often consults the sun-god. It is marked by the more definite
character of its announcements when compared with others. The text is in the form of a communication made to the king,
and, like other official documents, it begins with a salutation.
The gods give Esarhaddon greeting.2
Ashur has given him the four ends of the earth. In the house where he shines and is great,3 the king has no rival. Like the rising sun he shines. This is the greeting from Bel Tarbasi 4 and the assembled gods.
The god Ashur himself now addresses the king :
As for those enemies that plot against thee, that force thee to march out,
Thou didst open thy mouth [saying],
" Verily I implore Ashur." I have heard thy cry. Out of the great gate of heaven I proclaim aloud,
'
Surely I will hasten to let fire devour them. Thou shalt stand among them.

' Lord of the court ' a title of Ashur.



346 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
In front of thee I shall rise up. 1 Up onto the mountain I bring them, There to rain down upon them destructive stones. Thine enemies I hew down, With their blood I fill the river. Let them behold and glorify me, For Ashur, the lord of gods, am I.'
This important and striking message, coming direct from Ashur we are told, is to be formally presented and read in the
presence of the king. Instructions are added to the priests to
pour out a libation of precious oil. Sacrifices of animals and
waving of incense are to accompany the presentation.
The oracle, as the god's answer to the king's questions, thus gave rise to a ritual as elaborate as the rites connected with the
preparations for the answer. The oracles were not always
trustworthy, as we can well believe, and often they were not
definite enough. If we may judge from an expression in one of the divine messages to Esarhaddon, the king appears to have entered a complaint against a former oracle, which was not to
his liking. Ishtar accordingly sends the following message: 2
The former word which I spoke to thee,
On it thou didst not rely. Now, then, in the later one you may have confidence.
Glorify me !
Clearly, the Assyrian kings believed that the oracles existed
to announce what they wanted to hear. They probably did not hesitate to follow their own judgment whenever they considered
it superior to the advice given to them by the gods. There
would, of course, be no difficulty in accounting for failures brought about through obedience to the oracles. The priests,
hemmed in on every side by minute ceremonial observances, forfeited their power as mediators by the slightest failure in

the observance of these rites. An error or a mishap would
entail most serious consequences. A misleading oracle, therefore, and to a certain extent, unfavorable omens, would be the
fault of the priests. The deity would send ' a lying message ' * or bring about unfavorable omens as a sign of his or her dis
pleasure. On the other hand, the priests in turn would not
hesitate speaking of course in the name of the gods to
accuse the kings of neglecting Ishtar or Nabu or Shamash, as the case may be. In an oracle addressed to Esarhaddon,2
Ishtar of Arbela is represented as complaining that the king has done nothing for her, although she has done so much for him.
Such a state of affairs cannot go on.
Since they do nothing for rrte, I will not give anything to thee.
The king promptly responds by copious offerings, and the
goddess appears to be pacified. There is another feature connected with the oracles that must
be touched upon before passing on. The oracles stand ob
viously in close relationship to the penitential psalms. It was, naturally, in times of political distress that the kings would be
particularly zealous in maintaining themselves on good terms with the powerful gods. Without their aid success could not
be expected to crown any efforts. Guiding their steps by frequent consultations of the priests, the appeals of the kings would increase in earnestness and fervor as the campaign progressed and assumed more serious aspects. When disaster stared them in the face, they would be forced to conclude that
the gods were angered, and there was only one way left of averting the divine wrath a free confession of sins, accom
panied, of course, by offerings and magic rites. The Assyrian kings do not tell us in their annals of discomfitures that they

encountered. The penitential psalms supply this omission.
We have such a psalm written in the days of Ashurbanabal, 1 in
which that proud monarch humbles himself before the great
god Nabu, and has the satisfaction in return of receiving a
reassuring oracle. He prays :
I confess to thee, Nabu, in the presence of the great gods, [Many 2 (?)] are my sins beyond endurance? 3 [Lord (?)] of Nineveh, I come before thee, the warrior among the gods, his brothers.
[Prolong (?)] the life of Ashurbanabal for a long period. ... At the feet of Nabu I prostrate myself.
The god reassures the king:
I will grant thee life, O Ashurbanabal, even I, Nabu, to the end of days Thy feet shall not grow weary, nor thy hands weak (?), These lips of thine shall not cease to approach me, Thy tongue shall not be removed from thy lips, For I give thee a favorable message. I will raise thy head, I will increase thy glory in the temple of E-babbara.4
The reference to the temple of Shamash at Sippar reveals
the situation. Babylonia was the cause of much trouble to
Ashurbanabal, owing chiefly to the intrigues of his treacherous brother Shamashshumukin.5 Ashurbanabal at one time was
not merely in danger of losing control over the south, but of
losing his life in the rebellion organized by his 'faithless
brother.' A successful rebellion is a clear sign of a god's
displeasure. Marduk, as we have seen, was not often appealed to by the Assyrian kings, but Nabu seemed always ready to help them. Hence the king confesses his sins and makes an

ORACLES AND OMENS. 349
appeal to the great Babylonian god and not to Ashur. He is
encouraged by the promise that his life will be spared, and that
his supremacy will be recognized in Babylonia. The great sanctuary of Sippar is here employed figuratively for the temples of Babylonia in general. To be glorified in that famous
temple was equivalent to a recognition of royal authority. That these oracles served a practical purpose is definitely proved by the manner in which they are introduced by the
kings in their annals. Ashurbanabal tells us that in the course
of one of his campaigns against Elam, he addressed a fervent
prayer to Ishtar of Arbela, and in reply the message comes, as in the texts we have been considering, "Fear not"; and she
adds, " Thy hands raised towards me, and thy eyes filled with
tears, I look upon with favor." 1
DREAMS.
It is, of course, not necessary to assume that the oracles of
the gods were always delivered in the same formal manner,
accompanied by elaborate ceremonies. The gods at times reveal themselves in a more direct manner to their favorites.
In visions of the night they appear to encourage the Assyrian army by an oracle. On one occasion, when the army of Ashurbanabal approached a rushing stream which they were afraid to
cross, Ishtar makes her appearance at night, and declares, " I walk in front of Ashurbanabal, the king who is the creation of
my hands." * The army, thus reassured, crosses the river in
safety. On another occasion, Ashurbanabal, when threatened by the king of Elam, receives a message from Ishtar revealed to a seer in a dream at night. The seer no doubt a priest
- reports to the king: 3 'Ishtar, dwelling in Arbela, came with

quivers hung on her right and left side, with a bow in her hand, and girded (?) with a pointed, unsheathed sword. Before thee
\i.e., the king] she stood, and like the mother that bore thee. 1
Ishtar, supreme among the gods, addressed thee, commanding:
" Be encouraged 2 for the fray. Wherever thou art, I am." : In connection with the importance that the Babylonians and
Assyrians, in common with all ancient nations, attached to
dreams, divine messages thus revealed had a special significance fully on a par with the oracles that were formally delivered with
an accompaniment of elaborate rites. A god appearing to one in a dream was a manifestation, the force of which could not be disputed. It mattered little to whom the dream was sent. Ashur, on one occasion, chose to reveal himself to an enemy
of Ashurbanabal with a message. He appears in a dream
before Gyges, the king of Lydia, and tells him, 8 " Pay homage to Ashurbanabal, the king of Assyria, and by the power of his name conquer thine enemies." Gyges obeys and sends a messenger to the Assyrian monarch to inform him of the dream.
Occasionally in this way a deity might appear to a king, but in general it was to the professional
' dreamer ' rather than to the
laity to whom oracles were thus sent. The message was not
necessarily delivered in person by the deity. Sin, the moongod, on one occasion writes his message on the moon's disc:
Against all who have evil designs And hostile sentiments towards Ashurbanabal, the king of Assyria, Will I send a miserable death.4
Every dream was of course sent by some god, but the dreams of others than those. who acted as mediators between the gods
and men were of a different character. They were omens.
The gods would reveal themselves indirectly by means of
pictures or symbols, and it would require the services of a priest

again to interpret such symbols or omens. The gods were asked to send such dreams as might receive a favorable inter
pretation, 1 and when a dream came unsolicited, the gods were implored to convert the dream into a favorable omen.
In the case of dreams, it will be apparent, the dividing line between oracles proper and omens becomes exceedingly faint,
and it is very doubtful whether the Babylonians or Assyrians
recognized any essential difference between the two. The suggestion has already been thrown out that there is a wider
aspect to omens in the Babylonian religion than their employ
ment in connection with sacrificial offerings. We have reached
a point when it will be proper to take up this wider aspect.

CHAPTER XX.
VARIOUS CLASSES OF OMENS.
THERE is a close connection between the various branches
of the religious literature of Babylonia and Assyria that we have hitherto been considering. The magic incantations are, as we
have seen, a form of prayer. On the other hand, prayers, whether hymns or confessions of sin with an appeal for relief
from suffering or distress, or embodying the petition for a divine
response to some question or questions, are never entirely dissociated from incantations, and are invariably based upon the same beliefs that give to the element of magic such a promi
nent place in the religion. The omens form part of this same order of beliefs. The connecting link between incantations and
omens is the sense of mystery impressed upon man by two
orders of -phenomena the phenomena of his own life and the
phenomena of the things about him. In his own life, nothing was more mysterious to him than the power of speech. It is doubtful whether he recognized that the animals communicated with one another by means of the sounds that they emitted; but
even if he did, the great gap separating such means of communication from the power residing in the combination of sounds, of which he could avail himself, must have been all the more
impressive. In view of this, it is not difficult to understand
that a magic force was attributed to words as such. Of course, a somewhat advanced degree of culture must have been reached
before such a belief would be given a definite form of expres
sion; but even in the simplest form of social organization the
notion of authority necessarily exists, and authority is insepa



VARIOUS CLASSES OF OMENS. 353
rable from words. The chief commands, and the conclusion is naturally drawn that the words he utters are imbued with the
power to force obedience. These two factors the mystery of
speech and the practical demonstration of the power residing in words are sufficient to account for the part played by incan
tations among all nations at a certain stage of their religious
development; and once introduced, the conservatism attaching to religious rites would ensure their continuance even after the
popular religious beliefs had passed far beyond the stage in question. The modifications introduced into the incantations
would be nigh endless. There would develop a tendency to greater complications in the combination of words. At the same
time their literary form would be improved. Prayers and hymns reflecting advanced religious sentiments would be produced, but the magic element connected with the words as such would
not for that reason be lost sight of. The efficacy of such prayers
would still depend upon their being uttered in the right manner
and what is equally to the point by the right person. Corresponding to the chief in secular affairs who alone can
pronounce words that give evidence of their power by the results
produced is the priest in religious affairs to whom, as the mediator between the gods and men, the secret is entrusted of
uttering the right words in the right way, so as to produce the desired results, to force, as it were, obedience from the gods, as a chief forces obedience from his subjects. In a more advanced
stage of religious culture, the position of the priest is no less powerful and important. When incantations yield to prayers in the proper sense, or are combined with prayers, it is only the
priests who can make the prayers effective by their interceding in some way with the gods, whether by adding their appeal to
that of the supplicant, or by the performance of the rites
accompanying prayer, or by their aid in leading the worshipper into the presence of the deity and standing with him before the throne of grace.



354 BA B YL ONIA N-ASS YRIAN REL IGION.
When man turns from a contemplation of self to the things around him, there is added to the sense of the mysterious which is aroused in him, the feeling of his own weakness which
is borne in upon him with overpowering force. He cannot fail
to realize how dependent he is upon the sun, the moon, the rain, and the storm. At every step, he takes dangers beset his
path. The animal world is at times hostile, at times friendly;
but whether the one or the other, it is essential for him to care
fully note all that is going on around him. Every happening or sight of an unusual character arouses now his sense of fear,
and again his hope. He learns to attach special importance to deviations from the normal course of things. There must be a
reason for the exception from the rule. It betokens something,
and, concerned as man primarily is for his own welfare, he
naturally comes to connect both the regular phenomena of nature as well as the deviations, the normal traits and habits
of the animal world as well as peculiar features occasionally
occurring, with his own fate. To forestall the future was his
only safeguard against the dangers in store for him. It was of the utmost importance to him to know what was coming or, at
all events, to be on the lookout for something, in order to be
in a proper frame to receive either the benefits or to meet the
difficulties of the situation.
His powers of observation upon which man in a primitive state depended almost entirely for his sustenance were thus
further strengthened by the necessity of protecting himself, so far as possible, against the uncertainties of the future. Nothing would escape him. The movement of the stars and planets,
their position at different seasons and periods, the appearance
of the clouds, an eclipse, the conditions of the streams, an
earthquake, the direction of the winds, storms, the flight of birds, the barking of dogs, the movements of snakes and serpents, peculiar marks on the bodies of children, of adults and animals, monstrosities among mankind or the brute creation,



VARIOUS CLASSES OF OMENS. 355
the meeting with certain persons or animals, the rustling of
leaves, the change of seasons, the lustre of precious stones, all attracted man's attention. Whatever he saw might portend
something to him, in fact did portend something; hence the one great aim and ideal of his life was to see everything. Seeing meant foreseeing, and the man who could see everything the seer par excellence, who could also understand what he saw
held in his hands the key that would unlock the secrets of the
future. He possessed the means of forecasting events.
Apart, then, from the interpretation of omens in connection with sacrifices and incantations, the individual had to be on the
outlook at all times for signs and portents. To neglect them
would entail serious consequences. This wider aspect of omens accounts for the extensive omen
literature that arose in Babylonia and Assyria. Fully one-fourth of the portion of Ashurbanabal's library that has been discovered
consists of omens, 1 tablets of various size in which explanations
are afforded of all physical peculiarities to be observed in
animals and men, of natural phenomena, of the position and movements of the planets and stars, of the incidents and
accidents of public and private life, in short, of all possible occurrences and situations.
As yet but a small proportion of this literature has been
published, and a thorough understanding of it is impossible until systematic publications shall have been issued. Meanwhile it is safe to assert that, as in the case of incantations and
prayers, the omens were generally combined into series by the
Babylonian and Assyrian scribes.

OMENS FROM PLANETS AND STARS.
it
Ihering observes l that the stars were observed by the Baby
lonians in the interest of navigation. While this is true, yet
the chief motive in the development of astronomy in the
Euphrates Valley was the belief that the movements of the
heavenly bodies portended something that was important for man to know. That the stars served as guides to the mariner
was only an additional reason for attaching great importance to the heavenly phenomena. Scientific observations were but
means to an end ; an'd the end was invariably the derivation of omens from the movements and position of the planets and
stars. When, therefore, we find the astronomers sending reports
to their royal masters apparently of a purely scientific character, we may be certain that although no omens are mentioned, both parties had omens in mind. The astronomical reports, of which quite a number have already been published,2 may therefore be reckoned as part of the omen literature. The vernal equinox
was a period of much significance. The astronomer royal
accordingly reports: 3
On the sixth day of Nisan,4 Day and night were balanced. There were six double hours of day, Six double hours of night. May Nabu and Marduk Be gracious to the king, my lord.
On another occasion the equinox took place on the i5th of
Nisan, 5 and accordingly this is reported. Again, the appearance of the new moon was anxiously looked for each month, and the king is informed whether or not it was seen on the 29th or 3oth day of the month. 6

A watch we kept
On the twenty-ninth day, The moon we saw. May Nabu and Marduk

An extraordinary event, such as an eclipse, is made the subject of a more elaborate report. The Babylonian astronomers
had developed their scientific attainments to the point of calculating the time when an eclipse of the sun or the moon would
take place. As this period approached, they watched for the eclipse. We have an interesting specimen of a report in which the astronomer announces that an expected eclipse for which a watch was kept for three days did not appear. 1 Another addressed to an official reads :
2
To the Agriculturist,3 my lord, Thy servant Nabushumiddin,
An officer of Nineveh, May Nabu and Marduk be gracious
To the Agriculturist, my lord. The fourteenth day we kept a watch for the moon. The moon suffered an eclipse.
The reports pass over into indications of omens with an ease which shows that the observations of the astronomers were
made with this ulterior motive in view. A report which
forms a supplement to one above translated furnishes the inter
pretation given to the vernal equinox :
4
The moon and sun are balanced, The subjects will be faithful,5 The king of the land will reign for a long time.

5 Lit.,
' true speech in the mouth of the people,' i.e., there will be no sedition.



358 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
The complement, then, to the purely scientific observations is furnished by these official communications to the kings and
others, setting forth in response, no doubt, to commands or inquiries, the meaning of any particular phenomenon, or of the position of the planets, or of any of the stars at any time, or of their movements. Of such communications we have a large
number. They illustrate the great attention that was paid to
details in the observation of the heavenly bodies. The moon
as the basis of the calendrical system occupies the first place in
these reports. Its movements were more varied than those of
the sun. Through its phases, its appearance and disappearance at stated intervals, a safe point of departure was obtained for
time calculations. While the sun through its daily course
regulated the divisions of the day, the moon by its phases fixed the division of weeks and months. The moon never appeared quite the same on two successive nights nor in the same part of the heavens. The more variety, the more significance was
a principle of general application in the interpretation of omens. Whether the Babylonians also recognized an influence of the
moon on the tides, we have no certain means of determining, but it is eminently likely that trained as their astronomers were
in careful observation, this was the case. But apart from this,
there were many events in public and private affairs that appeared to them to stand in close connection with the move
ments of the orb of night. Nothing that occurred being regarded as accidental, the conclusion was forced upon the Babylonians that the time when something was undertaken was
of significance. The fact that certain undertakings succeeded,
while others failed, was most easily explained upon the theory that there were periods favorable for the action involved
and periods unfavorable. The gathering of past experience
thus becomes a guiding principle in the interpretation of the movements of the moon ; and what applies to the moon
applies, of course, to the other planets and to the stars.



VARIOUS CLASSES OF OMENS. 359
No doubt other factors are involved, such as association of
ideas; but it is evident from a careful study of the omen literature that conclusions drawn from what appears to us as the
accidental relation of past occurrences to the phenomena pre
sented by the planets and stars constituted fully three-fourths
of the wisdom of the Euphratean augurs. The same report, of
which a portion has already been quoted, 1 continues after inter
preting the meaning of the equinox with a diagnosis of other concurrent conditions: 2
Sun and moon are seen apart,3 The king of the country will manifest wisdom.4 On the fourteenth day sun and moon are seen together, There will be loyalty in the land,
The gods of Babylonia are favorably inclined, The soldiery will be in accord with the king's desire,
The cattle of Babylonia will pasture in safety.5 From Ishtar-shumeresh.
The same conditions appearing on another day may portend precisely the reverse. So another report informs the king :
6
On the fifteenth day the sun and moon are seen together,
A powerful enemy raises his weapons against the land, The enemy will smash the great gate of the city,
The star Anu appears bright, The enemy will devastate.
It is quite evident that such reports must have been sent in
response to royal orders asking for the meaning of existing conditions or of conditions that may be observed on certain days.
At times the prognostications assume a remarkable degree of
definiteness which forms a striking contrast to the general

360 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
vagueness of the oracles. An official, Balasi, reports l on one
occasion regarding the significance of the moon appearing unexpectedly :
The moon is seen out of season, Crops will be small. On the twelfth day the moon is seen together with the sun.2 Contrary to the calculated time,
The moon and sun appear together,
A strong enemy will devastate the land. The king of Babylonia will be forced to submit to his enemy.
On the twelfth day, the moon with the sun is seen, On the twelfth day is seen. Evil is in store for Babylonia. It is a favorable sign for Elam and the west land, But surely unfavorable for Babylonia.
The reports were not always concerned with political affairs.
Frequently there is a reference to lions and hyenas that might
be expected to make their appearance because of certain natu
ral phenomena. Often crops are referred to, and according as the conditions are favorable or not, fertility or famine is
predicted in the official reports. On other occasions the
astrologers venture the very safe prognostication that male children will be born or that there will be miscarriages, though
it seems likely that in such cases the forecast is intended for
the affairs of the palace alone.
We have seen 3 what great importance was attached by the
Babylonians to eclipses. It will be appropriate, therefore, to give a specimen of an astrologer's report in reference to such a phenomenon :
4
The moon disappeared,5 evil will settle in the land.
The moon, contrary to calculation, disappeared.

Another report reads :

On the twenty-ninth day a watch we kept. The observatory was covered, The moon we did not see.
This report was sent on the second day of the month of Shebat. 5 From these specimens and others, it is evident that
reports regarding the appearance or non-appearance of the new moon "were regularly sent. But in addition to this, the
kings sent to the observatory on numerous other occasions
for information with reference to the significance of certain
phenomena. As in the case of the moon, so also for the sun and the stars,
reports were transmitted that served as guides in directing the kings in their affairs. So on one occasion Nabu-mushesi forecasts that 6

If the ' king ' star is dark, The chamberlain l
(?) of the palace dies.
The official character of these reports is one of their signifi
cant features. Their great variety is an indication of the frequent occasions on which the kings consulted the astrologers.
No important enterprise was undertaken without first ascertain
ing what phenomena might be looked for on the day fixed for
any action, and what these phenomena portended. In the case of the Assyrian reports, it is natural to find many illusions to
foreign nations, since war occupied so much of the time and
energies of the Assyrian rulers. But we have seen that for
private affairs the astrologers were also consulted, as well as for
the internal affairs of the country. The reports illustrate
the practical application of what became known in the ancient
world as " Chaldaean wisdom." If, however, we would know the source whence the astrologers derived the knowledge which
they furnished in their reports, we must turn to the long lists
prepared by the priests, in which all possible phenomena connected with the planets and stars were noted and their meaning
indicated. These compilations constitute the f
Priestly Codes ' of the Babylonians, and, as already intimated, they were combined just as the incantations and prayers, -into series.
Many such series must have existed at one time in Babylonia.
A great temple was incomplete without its observatory, and we are warranted in concluding that every great religious center of the Euphrates Valley had its collection of omen tablets. The natural ambition of the priests was to make such
a series as complete as possible. The larger the number of
observations it contained, the greater the possibility of finding an answer to the question put to them. To these lists addi
tions would constantly be made, and, if we may judge from the manner of literary composition that prevailed among the ancient Hebrews and later among the Arabs, the work of the compilers
1 Some palace official is mentioned.



VARIOUS CLASSES OF OMENS. 363
of omen series consisted essentially in combining whatever material they could obtain, and adding such observations as they themselves had made. While, therefore, the omen code
of one place might differ in details from that of another, not
only would the underlying principles be the same in all, but
each series would represent an aggregation of experiences and observations drawn from various quarters.
A large omen series of which as yet only fragments have been
published l bears the title
' Illumination of Bel.' It is esti
mated that this astrological code embraced more than one
hundred tablets. From the fragments published, the general method employed in the preparation of the series can be gathered. To the moon and to the sun, to each of the planets, and
to the important stars a separate section was assigned. In
this section the peculiarities, regular and irregular, connected with each of the bodies were noted, their appearance and disap
pearance, the conditions prevailing at rising and at setting, the relationship of the moon to the sun or to a star, of the stars to
one another and to the ecliptic, were set forth. Since, however, the time when a phenomenon connected with a planet or star
was as important as the phenomenon itself, observations were entered for the various months of the year and for various
days in each month. The days were not arbitrarily chosen, but, as there is every reason to believe, selected on the basis
of past experience. Similarly the interpretations of the phenomena were founded on the actual occurrence of certain
events at certain times when the conditions indicated actually
existed. A single occurrence might suffice for predicating a connection between the event and the phenomenon. The coincidence would constitute an observation, but the omen would naturally gain additional force if it was based on a
repeated observation of the same phenomenon on the same day
l E.g., IIIR. 52, no. 2 ; 60 and 61. Professor Craig of the University of Michigan is now preparing for publication all the fragments of this series. (See his Assyrian and Babylonian Religious Texts, ii. 7.)



364 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
of the same month. But such a case would be rare, and the
effort of the astrologers would be directed simply towards gather
ing as many observations of phenomena as possible. They would rest content when they had found a single connection between the phenomenon and the event. Their success in
giving an answer to a question put to them as to what might happen on a certain day, fixed for battle or for laying the
foundations of an edifice, or for dedicating a temple, for setting
out on an expedition, or for any undertaking whatsoever, would depend on the completeness of their lists, and correspondingly the interpretation of a phenomenon occurring on any day would entail no difficulties if in their consultation lists the
phenomenon would be recorded. The 22d tablet of the series ' Illumination of Bel' deals with
the important subject of eclipses. It contains 88 lines, and furnishes us with a good specimen of the class of omens under
consideration. It begins l with eclipses that may take place
during the first month, and runs along through the twelve
months of the year. The i4th, i5th, i6th, 2oth, and 2istdays of the month are those set down when eclipses have been observed. The official character of the omens is indicated by
their repeated references to the nations with which Babylonia
and later Assyria came into contact, and to the fate in
store for the rulers of the country. For the third month, the
tablet notes :
In the month of Sivan, an eclipse happening on the I4th day, proceeding from east to west, beginning with the middle watch,2 and ending with the morning watch, the shadow being seen in the east the side of obscuration furnishes an omen 3 for the king of Dilmun.4 The king of Dilmun

An eclipse happening on the i5th day, the king of Dilmun is slain, and some one seizes the throne.

An eclipse happening on the 2ist day, sorrow and despair in the land. The land is full of corpses.
The eclipses for the fourth month furnish omens for the king
of Guti another district with which Babylonia and Assyria
had frequent dealings.
An eclipse happening in the month of Tammuz on the I4th day, proceeding from the west to the south, beginning with the first watch and ending with the middle watch, the shadow being seen in the west the side of obscuration furnishes an omen for the king of Guti.

wards for a year storms destroy property.2 An eclipse happening on the 2ist day, the armies of the king revolt and deliver him into the hands of enemies.
The eclipses of the following month deal with several

An eclipse in the month of Ab 8 on the I4th day, proceeding from the south to the east, beginning with the first watch, or with the morning watch, and ending at sunrise, the shadow being seen in the south the side of obscuration furnishes an omen for the king of Umliash. The soldiery are engaged in severe conflicts for a year, and are slain by force of arms.

An eclipse happening on the i6th day, the king of Babylonia dies. Pestilence * feeds upon the country.
An eclipse happening on the 2Oth day, the king of the Hittites 2 in person (?) seizes the throne.
An eclipse happening on the 2ist day, a deity strikes (?) the king, and fire consumes king and land.
From these specimens, the general principle of the section is
apparent. Since eclipses portend public and political disasters of some kind, the compiler has carefully gathered oracles given on previous occasions to some ruler, or observations of the events that occurred at the time of the recorded eclipses. The
apparently restricted application of the omens was no hindrance
to their practical use. In the event of an astrologer being
consulted with regard to the significance of an eclipse on a cer
tain day, his list would furnish a safe basis for further prognos
tications, suitable to the political conditions that prevailed. But
in order to meet all contingencies, other lists furnishing further
omens for eclipses were added. The 22d tablet of the 'Illumination of Bel ' series is followed by one 3 which, while dealing
with the same subject, approaches it somewhat differently, and is based on a different principle. It begins again with the first month, and in twelve paragraphs takes up in succession the
months of the year. Choosing for comparison the same three
months, the third, fourth, and fifth, which we selected in the case of the 226. tablet, it will be seen that, while the references
are again to public affairs, the prognostications are of a more
general character and of wider applicability.
If in the 3d month an eclipse takes place on the I4th day, rains will descend and flood the canals. Storms will cause inundations. The soldiery
of Babylonia will destroy the country. An eclipse on the 1 5th day indicates
that king against king will send troops.4 The king of legions dies. An

eclipse on the i6th day signifies that the king will be slain, and that some

king will hand his throne to his son. An eclipse happening on the 2ist day portends rain,'2 and an invasion of the enemy's land. For the 4th month an eclipse on the I4th day portends that rains will descend and the canals will be flooded. Rains will cause inundations. There will be famine.

women will be happily delivered of their offspring. An eclipse on the 2Oth day portends that lions will cause terror and that reptiles will appear ; an eclipse on the 2ist day that destruction (?) will overtake the riches of the
The vagueness of many of the prognostications is in all probabilities intentional, just as we found to be the case in most of
the oracles announced to the kings. To predict rains during the rainy months was comparatively safe. The storms which
visited Babylonia annually brought with them destruction of
cattle. They conditioned the fertility of the country, but
pestilence was often caused by the evaporation of the waters.
Again, military expeditions were usually undertaken in the spring of the year before the great heat set in, and in a country
like Assyria, it was safe to hazard a vague prediction that hostilities would ensue, and that some district would be diminished. What may be called the 'eclectic' character of the omen series under consideration thus becomes apparent. The lists

consisted, on the one hand, of omens obtained on certain occasions and with reference to some specific circumstance,
such as a campaign against some country, and, on the other
hand, of prognostications of a more general character, based on the general climatic conditions of the country, and referring to
events of frequent occurrence. All that the scribes in preparing
the series were concerned with, was to collect as many omens
as they could, and to arrange them in some convenient order.
Just as they prepared lists referring to military events, so they put together others in which some other theme was treated.
The reports and omen tablets thus complement one another. The latter are based on the former, and the former were
obtained by the interpretation of phenomena, furnished by the tablets and applied to the particular case submitted to the
priests. We need not, of course, suppose that all prognostications found in the series, especially in those parts of it which
are of a more general character, were based upon reports actually made, any more than that the official reports to the kings even in later days were always based upon a consultation of
some series of tablets. Individual judgment, both in compil
ing a series and in interpreting phenomena, must at all times have played some part. The reports and the series also embody to some extent the results of experience not previously put to writing; but these considerations do not alter the general
proposition set forth in this chapter as to the practical purpose served by the omen series as well as by the reports, and the
pragmatic origin of both. The importance of eclipses gave to omens connected with
such events a special significance. Eclipses, however, were after all rare events, and while because of their rarity they always
portended something of great moment, still the ordinary phenomena were the ones that had to be studied by the astrologers with great care in order to obtain a rational view of the relation
ship between the phenomena of nature and the fate of the indi



VARIOUS CLASSES OF OMENS. 369
vidual or of the state. Again, eclipses, as a general thing, pointed to a public disaster of some kind, and this recognized
belief lightened the task of the priest considerably in this instance. In the case of ordinary phenomena it was much more difficult to find the connection between cause and effect ;
and in the vast majority of instances when kings and individ
uals sought the temples for omens, the heavens must have presented a normal and not an abnormal appearance.
What answers were the priests to give to the questions put
to them ? Was it a favorable period for undertaking a military campaign ? On what day should the king set out ? Was the day fixed on by the council of war favorable for a battle ? On
what day should the foundation for the temple or palace be
laid ? Will the sick person recover ? Should one set out on a
proposed journey? Is the day fixed for a marriage auspicious? Recognizing by experience that the same thing undertaken at different times turned out differently, in the one case being
brought to a successful issue, in the other followed by mis
fortune, the conclusion was forced upon the popular mind (as
already set forth above) that the day on which something was done or was to be done was of great moment. But how did one day differ from the other ? That was the
question for the priests to determine. During the hours that
the sun was in control, the clouds produced constant changes
in the appearance of the heavens, but because of their irreg
ular character, these changes impressed the Babylonians less forcibly than the striking changes that the nights showed. The planets and stars never appeared alike on two successive
nights. There was always some change in the position of some
of the heavenly bodies. To these changes, then, the priests directed their attention. In the variations presented by the
heavens at night they saw a potent reason for the varying
results produced by the same act undertaken at different
times.



370 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
If it made a difference at what moment something was done, that difference could only be determined by observing the vari
ations that one night presented from the other. The astrologers observed that many of the stars were, or seemed to be, fixed
in their orbits; others rose and set like the sun and moon, and
appeared in different parts of the heavens at different seasons
of the year. The regularity of these changes made it possible to study the course of these stars, and as knowledge progressed, to determine also in advance where a particular body would be
seen at a certain time.
The planets accordingly were the bodies to which the
astrologers especially directed their attention. It has been
conjectured with some show of probability that one of the
purposes served by the lofty seven-staged towers, 1 which were attached to many of the great temples, was for the better obser
vation of the movements of the planets. The official standing of the astrologers is indicated by the references in texts to the
* court astrologer.' However this may be, there is no doubt that at all the large temples and at many of the smaller ones, observations of the
planets were recorded. The collection of these observations formed the manuals for
the priests in answering many of the questions put to them. Each of the great planets was identified (by a process of thought that we will have occasion to describe) with some deity, though
this was not done until the attempt was also made to gather
the astrological knowledge of the day into some kind of consistent system. Our own names of the planets, as handed down to us through the Greeks and Romans, are but the clas
sical equivalents of the Babylonian deities. 2 Jupiter is Marduk, the head of the Babylonian pantheon. Venus is the Babylonian Ishtar. Mars is Nergal, the god of

war and pestilence. Mercury is Nabu, the god of wisdom and the messenger of the gods, and Saturn is Ninib.
Among the astrological texts preserved, Ishtar- Venus figures more prominently than the other planets. The appearance of Ishtar during each month and for various days of the month
was noted, and then interpreted, partly on the basis of past experience, but also by other factors that for the most part
escape us. A tablet, furnishing omens derived from the position of the planet Venus and which may belong to the series
' Illumination of Bel,' deals with the periods of the disappear
ance of Venus as evening star, and her reappearance as morn
ing star, and vice versa. 1
In the month of Tammuz (4th month) Venus disappeared on the 25th day at sunset, for seven days was hidden,2 and on the 2d day of Ab (5th month) was seen at sunrise. Rains in the land. Destruction of 3 ...

The heart of the land is good.6
In the month of Nisan (ist month), on the 9th day, Venus disappeared at sunsets (?), and for five months and sixteen days was hidden, and reappeared in the month of Elul (6th month), on the 25th day, at sunset. The heart of the land is good.
In the month of Ab (5th month), loth day, Venus disappeared at sunset 7 (?), and for two 8 months and sixteen days was hidden, and reappeared on the 26th day of Marcheshwan (8th month). Rains in the land.

If Venus is stationary to the 6th day of Kislev (gth month) at sunrise, and then disappears on the yth day of Kislev, and is hidden for three
months to reappear on the 8th day of Adar (i2th month) at sunset, it indi
cates that king against king will send hostility. In the month of Kislev (Qth month), loth day, Venus appeared at sunrise. Lack of corn and hay in the land. If she remains in position up to
the I4th day of Ab (5th month) at sunrise, and then on the I5th day disappears, and for three months is hidden, and on the 1 5th day of March
eshwan (8th month) rises at sunset, the crops of the land will be good.
A colophon informs us that the tablet in question embodies a series of observations of the movements of Venus recorded by
Babylonian scholars. It was evidently the purpose of the compilers to commit to writing as many variations in the
appearance and disappearance of the planet as possible. The omens must either have been furnished at one time or they embody actual occurrences that were observed in connection with the observation recorded. In either case the omens served
as guides for the priests in their replies to inquiries. An omen once furnished or an event once observed as having taken
place under given conditions of a planet served for all times.
The omen lists for the other planets were arranged on the same principle as the Venus list. The motions of the planets were carefully observed. It was noted whether they rose bril
liantly or with a pale color. Their position towards other stars
was determined, and much more the like. Besides the planets,
various stars that were distinguished by their brilliancy, as Sirius, Antares, Regulus, and also comets, were included in the sphere of astronomical calculations, and furnished omens to the priests. These omens, so far as we may judge from the texts at pres
ent published, all hinge around the same series of events that
are referred to in the illustrations given, rain, crops, war, dis
tress, the country's prosperity, the king's welfare or misfortune. Another piece of evidence is thus furnished for the hypothe
sis that these lists are based upon reports made to royal masters, and that the reports again are obtained from the lists prepared



VARIOUS CLASSES OF OMENS. 373
for public and political needs. We must not, however, conclude from this fact that the observation of heavenly phenomena was
of no significance at all for the private individual, but only that the position of the king and the general welfare of the country
were regarded of larger moment.
Just as the gods were held responsible chiefly for the larger affairs of this world, the trifles being relegated to the spirits
and demons, 1 so the planets and stars, as symbols of the gods, were regarded as auguries for the chief of the country rather than for the miscellaneous population, and more for the general
welfare than for individual prosperity. The individual shared
in the omen furnished, in so far as his well-being was dependent upon such important contingencies as whether there was to be
war or peace, good crops or bad. A population so largely engaged in agriculture as the Babylonians were, would be satisfied if they could be reassured as to the outcome of their work
in the fields. Ihering has properly emphasized the strong hold that the conception of communal interests obtained in
Babylonia. 2 This conception is reflected in the prominence given to public and political affairs in the omen lists and
'omen' reports. Agriculture was the primal factor in producing this conception in the south; war which united the population, even though military service was forced upon the people, was
the second factor ; and in Assyria, where military expeditions occupied a much larger share of public attention than in Babylonia, war became the chief factor in keeping alive the
thought of national solidarity.
OMEN CALENDARS.
There was still another reason why the king and with him
public affairs, received such prominence in the omen texts. As

374 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
the nation's ruler he was not only an important personage by
virtue of his power over his subjects, but also by virtue of his
close relationship to the gods. The theory of the ' divine right
of kings
' was rigidly adhered to in Babylonia and Assyria. When the monarchs speak of themselves as nominated by this
or that god to be the ruler of the country, this was not a mere
phrase. The king was the vicar of the deity on earth, his representative who enjoyed divine favor and who was admitted into
the confidence of the gods. In earlier days priestly functions
were indissolubly associated with kingship. The oldest kings
of Assyria call themselves * the priests of Ashur,' and it is only
as with the growth of political power a differentiation of func
tions takes place that the priest, as the mediator between the
deity and his subjects, becomes distinct from the secular ruler.
The further development of this process led to the curious
but perfectly natural anomaly that the king, from being originally identical with the priest, becomes in large measure depend
ent upon the latter in his relations to the gods. In the more
advanced stages of the religious cult, the king requires the service of a priest to act as mediator between himself and the gods,
precisely as all of his subjects need this mediatorship. The
king cannot obtain an oracle directly. He must send to the
temple and inquire of the priests. The priest must intercede for the king when he throws himself upon the mercy of an
angered god or goddess. The royal sacrifice is not acceptable unless the priest stands by the side of the king.
Still there are traces left of the old direct relationship
existing between the king and his gods. A god sometimes
reveals himself directly to a ruler. Ishtar appears in a dream
and gives him directions. Another and more significant trace
of this older relationship is to be found in the importance assigned to the religious conduct of the king. If an individual
offends a deity, the individual alone suffers, or at the most his
family is involved in the punishment inflicted; but if the king



VARIOUS CLASSES OF OMENS. 375
sins, the whole country suffers, and correspondingly the king's atonement and reconciliation with the gods is essential for
dispelling some national calamity. Frazer has shown by his
admirable investigations 1 that this view of kingship is common to many nations of antiquity. While it did not lead among
the Babylonians and Assyrians to that extreme which is best
illustrated by Japan, where the Mikado, by virtue of his divine
right, is hedged in with prescribed formalities that make him almost a prisoner, so closely is he watched by his attendants
lest any mistake be made by him which is certain to entail
serious consequences for the country, still the priests had to see to it that the rulers performed their duties towards the gods
in the prescribed manner and with all possible accuracy. The conduct of the king was of special significance at periods when for some reason or other, the gods were not favorably
disposed. Partly on the basis of actual observation that eclipses
(which were especially feared) had occurred on certain days of the month, partly as a consequence of the belief that the change in the moon's phase augured something good or evil for human
ity, and in part perhaps through the coincidence that on a certain day of the month, mishaps of some kind had occurred several
times, certain months and certain days of each month were regarded as favorable, while others were unfavorable. Some
months and some days were suitable for dedicating a building,
others were not. On some days an oracle might be sought, on
others not. Some days were days of rejoicing, on others again
mourning was appropriate. Advantage had to be taken of the favorable days to keep the deity in good humor, and it was equally important on the unfavorable ones to exercise great
care not to do aught which might arouse the anger of a god,
ready to be incensed. It is the king who can best accomplish the one thing and avoid the other. To him, as standing nearer
the deity than any private individual, the country looked for

safety and protection. Calendars were prepared for each month of the year, in which the peculiar character of each day was noted and instructions added what was to be done on each
day. These instructions all have reference to the king and to
the king alone. A complete calendar for the intercalated month
of Elul has heen preserved. 1 It may serve as an example of the
branch of the omen literature to which it belongs.
The thirty days of each month are taken up in succession.
The deity to which each day is sacred is indicated, and various
sacrifices or precautions prescribed.
A curious feature of this calendar was that, since it was the
hope to make every day
'
favorable,' each day was called so, even when it is evident that it was not.
For the ist day of Elul the second,2 sacred to Anu and Bel, a favorable
day. When the moon makes its appearance in this month, the king of
many peoples brings his gift, a gazelle together with fruit, ... his gift to Shamash, lord of the countries, and to Sin, the great god, he gives. Sacrifices he offers, and his prayer to his god 3 is acceptable. On the 2d day sacred to goddesses, a favorable day. The king brings his gift to Shamash, the lord 4 of countries. To Sin, the great god, he offers sacrifices. His prayer to the god is acceptable.
On the 3d day, a day of supplication to Marduk and Sarpanitum, a favorable day. At night, in the presence of Marduk and Ishtar,5 the king brings his gift. Sacrifices he is to offer so that his prayer may be acceptable.
On the 6th day, sacred to Ramman and Belit,6 a favorable day. The
king, with prayer and supplication (?), at night in the presence of Ramman, offers his gift. Sacrifices he is to bring so that his prayer may be acceptable.
On the yth day, supplication to Marduk and Sarpanitum, a favorable day

(sc. may it be). An evil day. The shepherd of many nations is not to eat
meat roasted by the fire, or any food prepared by the fire. The clothes of his body he is not to change, fine dress (?) he is not to put on. Sacrifices
he is not to bring, nor is the king to ride in his chariot. He is not to hold court nor is the priest to seek an oracle for him in the holy of holies. 1 The physician is not to be brought to the sick room.2 The day is not suitable for invoking curses.3 At night, in the presence of Marduk and Ishtar, the king is to bring his gift. Then he is to offer sacrifices so that his prayer
may be acceptable.
This yth day, it will be observed, is expressly called an evil
day. It is evident, therefore, that the phrase
* favorable day '
in the first line expresses a hope and not a fact, or is added to indicate the manner in which the day can be converted into a
favorable one. Just as the 7th day, so the i4th, 2ist, and 28th
are called evil days, and the same ceremonies are prescribed
for the king on these days. These days were evidently chosen
as corresponding to the phases of the moon. But besides
these four days, a fifth, namely, the igth, is singled out in the same fashion. The comparison with the Biblical Sabbath nat
urally suggests itself. The choice of the 7th day and of the
corresponding ones rests, of course, in both instances upon the lunar calendar, and there is also this similarity between the Sabbath of the Hebrews and the ' evil day ' of the Babylonians,
that the precautions prescribed in the Pentateuchal codes
against kindling fires, against leaving one's home, against any productive labor point to the Hebrew Sabbath as having
been at its origin an 'inauspicious day,' on which it was dangerous to show oneself or to call the deity's attention to one's
existence. Despite the attempts made to change this day to one of 'joy,' as Isaiah would have it,
4 the Hebrew Sabbath con
tinued to retain for a long time as a trace of its origin, a rather severe and sombre aspect.

378 BABYLONIAAT-ASSYRIAN RELIGION
A striking difference, however, between the Babylonian and the Hebrew rites is the absence in the latter of the theory that the
atonement of a single individual suffices for the community. The
precautions prescribed for the Sabbath are binding upon every one. Emphasis is laid in the Pentateuch upon the fact that the
whole people is holy, whereas among the Babylonians the king
alone is holy. He alone is to abstain from his ordinary acts,
to conduct himself on the evil day with becoming humility, to
put on no fineries, not to indulge in dainty food, 1 not to appear in royal state, neither to appeal to the gods (for they will not hear them), nor even to interfere with their workings by calling in human aid against the demon of disease, who may have been
sent as the messenger of one of the gods. It is only at the
close of the day that he can bring a sacrifice which will be
acceptable. The king, by observing these precautions, insures the welfare of his people. The gods cared little for individual
piety, but they kept a jealous eye on their earthly representative. His appeals were heard if properly presented and if presented at the right time, but woe to the people whose king has aroused
the divine anger. Just as his acts of penitence have a representative character, so the gifts and sacrifices and supplications mentioned in the calendar are offered by the king on behalf of the
whole people. For the remaining days of Elul, the ordinances have much the same character as those instanced. The variation consists
chiefly in the god or gods to whom the days are sacred. Now it is Nabu and his consort Tashmitum on the 4th, 8th, and
i yth days to whom gifts and prayers are brought ; again Ninib and his consort Gula, on the gth, 2 or Gula alone, on the
1 9th. To Marduk and Sarpanitum the i6th day is assigned,
besides the 3d and yth days as above set forth ; to Ramman and his consort the 6th, to the old Bel and Belit the 5th, the i2th, the

25th, and to Nergal and Bau the 27th. At times two male
deities are in association. So Anu and Bel for the ist and the
3oth day, Ea and Nergal for the 28th, Sin and Shamash for the
1 8th, 2oth, 2ist, and 22d, or two goddesses, as Tashmitum and Sarpanitum, or a god alone, as Ea for the 26th, or Sin alone for the 1 3th, and once the 2gth day Sin and Shamash are combined with the miscellaneous group of Igigi and Anunnaki. All
the great gods are thus represented in the calendar. The basis
on which the days are assigned still escapes us. It is hard to
believe that any strict uniformity existed in this respect in the
cults attached to the various Babylonian temples. Preference would be shown in each center to the chief god worshipped
there, while to others would be assigned a position correspond
ing to some theological system devised by the priests. Uniformity and consistency are two elements that must not be
looked for in the omen literature of any people. The very fact
that omens have some rational basis, namely, observation and
experience, is the very reason why the omen lists and omen calendars of one place should differ from those of another, and pre
cisely to the same degree that observation and experience differ.
The intercalated months, by virtue of their extraordinary
character, had perhaps a special significance, but every day of the year had an importance of some kind. This is shown by a
Babylonian calendar, fortunately preserved in great part,
1 in
which every day of the year is included, and either its character
noted or some precautions prescribed. The indications in this calendar are marked by their brevity, and impress one as mem
oranda, intended as a guide to the priests. The calendar consists of twelve columns. At the head of each column stands the name of one of the months. One or,
at the most, two lines are devoted to each day of the month,
the days being ranged in succession from one to thirty. For a series of days in the 2d month the indications are:
1 V Rawlinson, pis. 48, 49.



380 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
2ist day, hostility. 22d day, judgment favorable, invoking of curses. 23d day, heart not good. 24th day, gladness of heart. 25th day, wife not to be approached, heart not good. 26th day, secret.
Such indications it is evident are intelligible only to the
initiated. With the help of the more complete calendars, such as the one above explained, we can in most cases determine
what is meant by these memoranda. A note like *
hostility
' is
an omen that the gods are unfavorably inclined on that day.
The 'judgment ' referred to on the 22d day is the oracle. The
day in question is suitable for obtaining a response to a question put to the deity, and a favorable occasion for invoking
curses upon the enemy. It will be recalled that the yth day of
the second intercalated Elul is put down as one when it is not
advisable to secure the ill will of the god against the enemy.
An expression like ' heart not good ' is explained by the contrast * heart glad.' The 23d day of the month is a day of sorrow, the 24th one on which one may be cheerful without arousing
the jealousy of the gods or demons. The 25th is again an unfavorable day in which, as a precaution, sexual intercourse is
prohibited. Lastly, the word rendered ' secret ' l is the same one that we came across in the precautions prescribed for the 7th day of the second Elul, where we are told that the
priest is not to enter the ' secret '
place. This term appears to describe the '
holy of holies ' in the Babylonian temples where the oracles were obtained. The single word ' secret ' was a
sufficient indication for the priest that on the day in question he might enter the mysterious chamber of the temple without
trepidation. Many of the days of the year are simply set down as 'favorable ' or '
unfavorable,' while others were noted as days

interest are the prohibitions regarding food on certain days. On the gth day of the 2d month "fish is not to be eaten or
sickness will ensue." Swine's meat is forbidden on the 3oth
day of the 5th month, and in this case the particular kind of sickness disease of the joints is specified that will ensue
in case of disobedience. On another day, the 25th of the yth
month, beef as well as pork is forbidden, while on the loth day of the 8th month and the 2yth day of the 6th month, dates are
forbidden as a precaution against eye disease. One is not to cross a stream 1 on the 2oth day of the 5th month; on certain
days one is not to sell grain; other days are again noted as
specially favorable for military movements.
Some of the precautions prescribed in this calendar may have been meant for the populace in general, such as the order not
to cross a stream or to strike a bargain. The belief in lucky
and unlucky days has a distinct popular flavor, but it is doubt
ful whether the ordinary public consulted the priests, as a gen
eral thing, in order to find out what days were lucky and what
not. It is more plausible to assume that the priests embodied in their official calendars some of the notions that arose among
the people, and gave to them an official sanction. There are a considerable number of references to the king in
the complete calendar under consideration, and we are permitted to assume, therefore, that the calendar served as a further guide
for the priests in their instructions to the king. The allusion
to oracles, curses, and weapons points in this same direction, and when, as in a number of instances, a day is described as one on which Shamash or some other god is 'angry,'
it is in all probabilities against the ruler rather than against private individuals that the god's displeasure has been mani
fested. A similar official and public character is borne by

another calendar, where months alone are indicated and their
significance interpreted. 1 The twelve months are arranged fn as many columns. Under each column the indications f favor
able ' or * not ' are entered, while at the Bright end of the tablet
the specifications are added for what undertakings the month is,
or is not, favorable. One of these specifications is " the soldiery
to make an attack upon a hostile city," and upon referring to the
list of months, we learn that the 2d, 6th, yth, 8th, and i2th months are favorable for such an undertaking, but the others
are ' not.' Again, the ist, 3d, 4th, 6th, 8th, gth, icth, and nth are ' favorable ' for "the entrance of any army upon foreign
soil," but the remainder ' not.' The other specifications refer likewise to the movements of the armies. Such a calendar was
evidently drawn up on the basis of omens, for a specific pur
pose, and, we may add, for some specific expedition to serve as a guide to the military commander. In the same way, calendars were drawn up devoted to indications regarding crops
and for other purposes of public interest. To a more limited
extent, private affairs are also touched upon.
To enter upon a further discussion of details is unnecessary
at this point, and would carry us too far from the main purpose
of this chapter, which is to point out the diverse ways in which
the belief in omens is illustrated by the religious literature of
the Babylonians. It is sufficient to have made clear that the oracles and dreams,
the lists of omens derived from eclipses, the works on the
planets and stars and the calendars, all have the same origin
due to observation of coincidences, to past experience, and to a variety of combinations, some logical and some fanciful, of supposed relationships between cause and effect ; and not only the same origin, but the lists and calendars served also the same
main purpose of guides for the priests in replying to the questions put to them by their royal masters and in forwarding

instructions to the ruler for the regulation of his own conduct
so that he and his people might enjoy the protection and good will of the gods. But the observation of the phenomena of the
heavens, while playing perhaps the most prominent part in the derivation of omens, was not the only resource at the command
of the priests for prognosticating the future. Almost daily, strange signs might be observed among men and animals, and whatever was strange was of necessity fraught with some meaning. It was the business of the priest to discover that
meaning.
OMENS FROM TERRESTRIAL PHENOMENA.
Monstrosities, human and animal, and all species of malformations aroused attention. The rarer their occurrence, the
greater the significance attached to them. In addition to this,
the movements of animals, the flight of birds, the appearance of snakes at certain places, of locusts, lions, the actions of dogs,
the direction of the winds, the state of rivers, and all possible
accidents and experiences that men may encounter in their
house, in the street, in crossing streams, and in sleep were observed. Everything in any way unusual was important, and even common occurrences were of some significance. The exten
sive omen literature thatwas produced in Babylonia is an indica
tion of the extent to which men's lives were hedged in by the
belief in portents. Several thousand tablets in the portion of AshurbanabaFs library that has been rescued from oblivion
through modern excavations, deal with omens of this general class. Several distinct series, some embracing over one hundred
tablets, have already been distinguished. One of these series deals with all kinds of peculiarities that occur in human infants
and in the young of animals; another with the things that may
happen to a man; a third with the movements of various ani
mals, and more the like. As yet but a small portion of these



384 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
tablets have been published, 1 but thanks to the indications
given by Dr. Bezold in his great catalogue of the Kouyunjik Collection, a fair idea of the general character of the Babylonian omen literature may be formed. On what principle the omens
were derived, it is again difficult to determine in detail, but
that some logical principles controlled the interpretations cannot be doubted.
Jevohs has shown 2 that in "sympathetic magic," of which
the interpretation of omens is an offshoot, the same logical methods are followed as in modern science. The famous
' Chaldean wisdom,' which is to be looked for in this widespread omen literature, would not have created so deep an
impression on the ancient world, if the theologians of the
Euphrates Valley, in incorporating primitive magic in the official religion, had not been successful in giving to their interpretations of occurrences in nature and in the animal world, the
appearance, at least, of a consistent science.
Taking up as our first illustration the series devoted to birth
portents, it is interesting to observe the system followed in pre
senting the various phases of the general subject. A broad distinction is drawn between significant phenomena in the case of human infants and in the case of the young of animals. About a dozen tablets are taken up with an enumeration of omens connected with new-born children, and one gains the impression from the vast number of portents included in the
lists that originally every birth portended something. The fact that births were of daily occurrence did not remove the sense
of mystery aroused by this sudden appearance of a new life. Every part of the body was embraced in the omens : the ears,
eyes, mouth, nose, lips, arms, hands, feet, fingers, toes, breast, generatory organs. Attention was directed to the shapes of
1 The most extensive publication of omens is Boissier's Documents Assyriens Relatifs aux Presages, of which two volumes have appeared. Boissier's method of
publication is not altogether satisfactory. 2 Introduction to the History of Religions, pp. 28-35.



VARIOUS CLASSES OF OMENS. 385
these various members and organs. The ears of a child might
suggest the ears of a dog or of a lion or of a swine, and similarly
the nose, mouth, lips, hands, or feet might present a peculiar
appearance. A single member or the features in general might be small or abnormally large. All these peculiarities meant something; and since few if any children are born without pre
senting some peculiarities in some part of the body, it would seem as though the intention of the compilers of the series was
to provide a complete handbook for the interpretation of signs connected with the birth of children. Naturally the total absence of some member of the body in case of the r\ew-born
or any malformation was a sign of especial significance. Hence we are told what was portended by a child born without hands
or feet or ears or lips, or with only one of these members, or with only one eye, or with no mouth or no tongue, or with six fingers on one or on both hands, or six toes on one or on both
feet, or without generatory organs. 1 The rarer the phenomenon, the greater the significance is,
as we have seen, a general principle in the science of augury. The birth of twins accordingly plays an important role in the series. In fact, the opening tablet is devoted in part to this
phase of the subject. We are told, for example, that 2
If a woman gives birth to twins, one male and one female, it is an unfavorable omen. The land is in favor,3 but that house (wherein the child was born) will be reduced.
And again,
If a woman gives birth to twins, and both are brought out alive (?),4 but the right hand of one is lacking, the ruler (?) will be killed by force, the land will be diminished. . . .
1 A particularly bad omen. See IIIR. 65, 22, obverse. 2 Boissier, Documents Assyriens Rclatifs attx Presages, pp. 1 10 seq. Boissier has published portions of some twenty tablets of the series, ib. pp. no-iSi. 3 f.e., will not suffer. 4 The phrase used is obscure. My translation is offered as a conjecture.



386 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
If a woman gives birth to twins, and both are brought out alive (?), but neither of them have right hands, the produce of the country will be consumed by the enemy. If a woman gives birth to twins, and both are brought out alive (?), but the right foot of one is missing, an enemy will for one year disturb the fixed order of the country. 1
It will be observed that these omens bear on public as well as
private affairs. The part played by public matters in them varies, but that the king and the country are so frequently introduced is an indication again of the official character given to
these omen tablets. Only priests whose chief concern was with the court and the general welfare would have been
impelled to mingle in this curious way the fate of the indi
vidual with that of the country at large. The birth of twins in itself is an omen for the house where the event occurs; but
twins that are monstrosities, with a foot or a hand lacking,
portend something of import to the general welfare. The tablet proceeds, after finishing one phase of the subject, with omens to be derived from infants whose features resemble those of certain animals. In this case again we will
see that the mind of the compiler is now directed towards the
fate of the individual and again toward the ruler or the country.
In the 2d tablet of the series we read that
If a woman gives birth to a child with a lion's head,2 a strong king will rule in the land. If a woman gives birth to a child with a dog's head, the city in his district 3 will be in distress, and evil will be in the country.
i. ..........
If a woman gives birth to a child with a swine's head, offspring and possession (?) will increase in that house.

1 /.., an enemy will keep the land in turmoil. 2 /.<?., like a lion. Elsewhere the preposition
' like ' is used. 3 Where the child is born.



VARIOUS CLASSES OF OMENS. 387
If a woman gives birth to a child with a serpent's head, for thirty days (?) Nin-Gishzida 1 will bring a famine in the land, and Gilgamesh 2 will rule as king in the land.
In the same tablet 8 such monstrosities are taken up as chil
dren born with two heads, with a double pair of eyes, or with the eyes misplaced, with two mouths or more than two lips.
The two heads, strange enough, generally portend good fortune, though not invariably. Thus an infant with two heads is an
omen of strength for the country ; and again
If a woman gives birth to a child with two heads, two mouths, but the
regular number of eyes, hands, and feet,4 it is an omen of vigorous life [for the country, but the son] will seize the king his father and kill him.
But
If a woman gives birth to a child with two heads and two mouths, and the two hands and two feet are between them,5 disease will settle upon that
city (where the monstrosity was born).
If the deformity consists in the misplacement of certain
organs, the omen is invariably bad.
If a woman gives birth to a child with two eyes on the left side, it is a
sign that the gods are angry against the land, and the land will be destroyed.
And again,
If a woman gives birth to a child with three eyes on the left side and
one on the right, the gods will fill the land with corpses.
The third tablet proceeds with other parts of the body. It
begins with a list of peculiarities observed in regard to the ears. The resemblance of certain features in children to the corre

388 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
spending features of animals is an observation made by many
nations. In modern times Lavater, it will be recalled, based
his study of human physiognomy in part upon the resemblance
of the nose, eyes, mouth, and ears, and general shape of the head to the features of such animals as the lion, jackass, dog,
and swine. We may well believe, therefore, that when the
Babylonians refer to a child with a lion's or a dog's ear, they
had in mind merely a resemblance, but did not mean that the child actually had the ear of a lion or dog or the like. At times the connection between the omen and its interpre
tation is quite obvious. In a portion of this same series we
are told that l
If a woman gives birth to a child with a lion-like ear, a mighty king will arise in the land.
It will be recalled that a ' lion head ' portends the same, and
it is evident that in both cases the lion suggests strength. We
are in the presence of the same order of ideas that controls the
belief in '
sympathetic magic.' The corollary to ' like produces like ' is ' like means like.' In other cases, the logic underlying
the interpretation of the omen must be sought for in views
connected with some accompanying feature.
If a woman gives birth to a child with the right ear missing, the days of the ruler will be long. If a woman gives birth to a child with the left ear missing, distress will enter the land and weaken it.
While in general the absence of any part of the body is a sign of distress for the country and individual by a perfectly
natural association of ideas, yet this general principle is modified by the further consideration that '
right
' is a good omen and * left ' a bad one. But this consideration which makes the
1 IIIR. 65, no. i.



VARIOUS CLASSES OF OMENS. 389
absence of the *
right
' ear a good omen may again be offset by the entrance of a third factor. So we are told that
If a woman gives birth to a child with a small l right ear, the house of the man 2 will be destroyed.
The omen of misfortune in this case is the deformity in the
organ, and the fact that the more important right ear is
deformed, so far from mitigating the force of the omen, accen
tuates its consequences. If a deformed right ear is disastrous, we are prepared to learn that
If a woman gives birth to a child with both ears short, the house of the man will be utterly rooted out.
No less than eleven varieties of deformed ears are enum
erated. It must not be supposed, however, that the factors involved in this omen science are always or even generally so simple. In most cases the connection between the sign and
the conclusion drawn, is not clear to us because of the multi
plicity of factors involved. Further publication and study of omen texts will no doubt make some points clear which are now
obscure, but we cannot expect ever to find out all the factors that were taken into account by the populace and the school
men, in proposing and accepting certain interpretations of certain omens, any more than we can fathom the reasons for the simi
lar superstition found among other nations 3 of antiquity and modern times. Recognizing certain principles in some of the
omens, we are justified in concluding that whatever else deter
mined the interpretation of omens, caprice did not enter into consideration, but rather an association of ideas that escapes

390 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
us, simply because our logic differs from the logic of primitive
peoples in certain important particulars. The list of peculiarities occurring in the case of babes continues as follows :
If a woman gives birth to a child whose mouth is shaped like a bird's, the country will be stirred up. If a woman gives birth to a child without any mouth, the mistress of the house will die. If a woman gives birth to a child with the right nostril lacking, misfortune
is portending. If a woman gives birth to a child with both nostrils lacking, the land will witness distress, and disease will destroy the house of the man. If a woman gives birth to a child whose jaw is lacking, the days of the ruler will be long, but the house of the man will be destroyed. If a woman gives birth to a child whose lower jaw is lacking, the ground will not bear fruit during the year.
It will be observed that, while most of the portents are evil, the ruler of the land is here generally vouchsafed immunity.
The priests had to be somewhat on their guard lest by the very
terror that they aroused, the hold of the rulers over the people
might be loosened. Moreover, the rulers were sufficiently hedged in by their positions, as we have seen, and were in no danger of regarding themselves as safe from the anger of the
gods. Still quite frequently even the king is involved in the evil
prophecy. The portion of the series dealing with portents derived from deformed hands and feet contains instances of this kind.
If a woman gives birth to a child with the right hand lacking, the land advances to destruction. If a woman gives birth to a child with both hands lacking, the city will witness no more births, and the land will be utterly destroyed.
If a woman gives birth to a child with the fingers of the right hand lack
ing, the ruler will be captured by his enemy.
If a woman gives birth to a child with six toes on the right foot, through distress (?), the house of the man will perish.



VARIOUS CLASSES OF OMENS. 391
If a woman gives birth to a child with six very small toes on the left foot, distress (?) will come to pass. If a woman gives birth to a child with six toes on the right foot, some
disaster is portending.
Altogether no less than ninety kinds of human deformities in
the various parts of the body are enumerated and interpreted.
The significance of the portents is naturally increased if the woman who gives birth to a monstrosity happens to belong to the royal house. In such a case, the omen has direct bearings
on national affairs. The good or evil sign affects the country
exclusively. From a tablet of this nature, 1 belonging to a different series than the one we have been considering, we learn
that six toes on the right foot or six on the left foot mean
defeat, whereas six toes on both feet mean victory. Royal twins
were a good omen, and so also a royal child born with teeth or
with hair on its face or with unusually developed features.
The same desire to find some meaning in deviations from
normal types led to the careful observation of deformities or
peculiarities in the case of the young of domestic animals. In
the fifth tablet of the series that we have chosen as an illus
tration, the compiler passes from babes to the offspring of domestic animals. From the opening line, which is all that
has been published as yet,
2 and which reads:
If in the flock 3 a dog is born, weapons will destroy life and the king will
not be triumphant
it would appear that the first subject taken up was the anomalous unions among animals, which naturally aroused attention when they occurred.
A number of tablets at least seven follow in which mon
strosities occurring among the young of sheep are noted.

'
stall,' which includes sheep, oxen, and swine.



392 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
The series passes on to signs to be observed among colts.
From this point on, the series is too defective (so far as pub
lished) to warrant any further deductions ; but it is safe to suppose that, as the young of ewes and mares were considered
in special sections, so the young of swine and of cows were taken up in succession. The whole series would thus aim to cover that section of the animal kingdom that concerned man
most, his own offspring, and the young of those animals by which he was surrounded. In these omens derived from the young of domestic animals,
we are again overwhelmed at the mass of contingencies included
by the priests in their compilations. Just as in the case of omens derived from infants, so here the parts of the body are
taken up one after the other. All possible, and one is inclined
to add various impossible, variations from the normal types are
noted. The omen varies as the female throws off one, two, three, or whatever number of young ones up to ten. For example: 1
If among the sheep, five young ones are born, it is a sign of devastation in the land. The owner of the sheep dies, and his house is destroyed.
This is the omen in the case that the litter consists of five
young ones, all normal. But if anomalies occur, as, e.g.,
If five young ones are born, one with a bull's head, one with a lion's head, one with a dog's head, and one with a sheep's head, there will be a series of devastations in the land.
Again,
If seven youngs are thrown off, three male and four female, that man 2
will perish.
And so if eight are born, it is a bad sign for the king who,
we are told,
" will be driven out of the country through sedi
tion."
1 Boissier, Documents, etcl, pp. 132, 133.
2 /.., the owner of the stall. A variant reads ' king ' instead of ' man.'



VARIOUS CLASSES OF OMENS. 393
The variations are nigh endless.
If in the flock, young ones are thrown off with five legs, it is a sign of distress in the land. The house of the man will perish and his stalls will
be swept away. If the young ones have six legs, the population will decrease and devastation will settle over the country.
Having finished with litters, the series proceeds to peculiar marks found on single specimens ; lambs that have a head
and tail shaped like a lion or that have a lion's head, and a
mane like that of an ass, or a head like a bird's, or like a swine, and so through a long and rather tiresome list.
Malformations in the shape or position of members of the
animal, particularly the mouth, ears, tongue, tail, and eyes, or the absence of any one or of several of these parts were
fraught with an importance corresponding to these symptoms among new-born babes.
If a young one has its ears on one side, and its head is twisted (?), and it has no mouth, the ruler will cut off the supply of water from his enemy.
In this instance the 'twisting' and the absence of the mouth
appear to suggest the act of turning a canal into a different
direction, so as to isolate a besieged city. When the text goes on to declare that
If the young one has its ears at its neck,1 the ruler will be without
judgment,
it is the association of ideas between ' ears ' and '
judgment,' 2
that supplies the link. A misplaced ear is equivalent to misdirected judgment. Consistent with this interpretation, the next line informs us that
If the young one has its ears below the neck,3 the union of the country is weakened. 1 Le., misplaced. 2 In Babylonian, ' ear ' is a synonym of < understanding.' 3 Still further misplaced.



394 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
Such glimpses into the peculiar thought controlling these omens are perhaps all that we will be able to obtain at least for
a long time to come. For the rest, comparative studies with the omens of the other nations will alone serve to determine
the multitudinous factors involved in the interpretations of the
signs. Before leaving the subject, however, a few more illustrations
may be offered. Another portion of the same tablet the eleventh continues the omens derived from peculiarities in the ears of lambkins:
If the young one has no right ear, the rule of the king will come to an
end, his palace will be uprooted, and the population of the city will be swept away, the king will lose judgment, . . . the produce of the country will be small, the enemy will cut off the supply of water. If the left ear of the young one is missing, the deity will hear the prayer
of the king, the king will capture his enemy's land, and the palace of the enemy will be destroyed, the enemy will lack judgment, the produce of the enemy's land will be taken away and everything will be plundered (?). If the right ear of the young one falls off, the stall l will be destroyed. If the left ear of the young one falls off, the stall will be increased, the stall 2 of the enemy will be destroyed.
If the right ear of the young one is split (?), that stall will be destroyed, the enemy (?) will advance against the city. If the left ear of the young one is split (?), that stall will be increased, the king 3 will advance against the enemy's land.
In all these cases it will be observed that a defect in the
right ear or an accident happening to it is an evil omen,
whereas the same thing occurring in the case of the left is a
favorable indication. The greater importance of the right side
of anything evidently suggests in this case the interpretation offered, and yet this principle, as we have seen, is far from
being of universal application. It depends upon what happens to the right ear. Above, we have seen that an unusually large
1 Where the young one was born. 2 /.*>., the flocks. 3 Boissier's text has ' man,' probably an error for '
king.'



VARIOUS CLASSES OF OMENS, 395
ear betokens some good fortune, and in the tablet under con
sideration, illustrations are afforded of accidents to the right ear which furnish a good omen, while the same accident in the
case of the left ear is regarded as a bad omen.
Our text continues:
If the right ear of the young one is shrunk (?), the house of the owner
will prosper. If the left ear is shrunk, the house of the owner will perish. If the right ear is torn off, the house of the owner will prosper. If the left ear is torn off, the house of the owner will perish.
But immediately following this we have again an evil omen for the right ear and a favorable one for the left. Three more
tablets are taken up with omens associated with all manner of
peculiarities in the formation of the ears, head, lips, mouth, and feet of lambkins, and it is not until the fifteenth tablet of the
series is reached that another subject, the young of mares, is introduced.
The prognostications in the case of colts have about the same character as those in the case of lambkins. The same
signs are singled out for mention, and the omens are not only,
just as in the illustrations adduced, evenly divided between the
fate of the country and its ruler, and of the owner of the colt or
mare, but we can also observe a consistent application of the
same principles, so far as these principles may be detected.
A few illustrations will make this clear: 1
If a colt has no right legs, the house 2 will be destroyed. If a colt has no left legs, the days of the ruler will be long.
If a colt has no legs, the country will be destroyed. If a colt has the right leg shortened, 3 . . . his stall 4 will be destroyed. If a colt has the left leg shortened, the stall * will be destroyed
If a colt has no hoof on the right foreleg, the wife will cause trouble to her husband.
1 IIIR. 65, no. 2, observe. 3 Lit.,
' cut off.' 2 Of the master. * Of the owner.



396 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
If a colt has no hoofs at all, there will be dissensions (?) within the country, and the enemy will enter the ruler's land.
In this way, twenty-one omens derived from as many varieties of strange formations in the legs of colts are enumerated.
As in the case of lambkins, so for colts, the appearance of
twins is endowed with a special significance.
If a mare gives birth to twins, male and female, and each has only one
eye, the enemy triumphs and devastates Babylonia. If the male or female colt has a mane like a lion, the country will be reduced. If the male or female colt has a dog's hoof, the country will be reduced. If the male or female colt has a lion's claw, the country will be enlarged. If the male or female colt has a dog's head, the woman's l life will be bad. The country will be reduced. If the male or female colt has a lion's head, the ruler will be strong. If both colts, the male and female, resemble lions, the ruler over his
enemies prevails (?). If both colts, male and female, resemble dogs, the ruler over his enemy's
country prevails (?). If either a male or female colt is born resembling a lion, the king will be
strong. If either a male or female colt resembles a dog, herds of cattle will die, and there will be famine. If a colt is born without a head, its master will be strong. If a colt is born without eyes, the god Bel will bring about a change of
dynasty. If a colt is born without feet, the king increases his army and a slaughter will ensue. If a colt is born without ears, for three years the gods will reduce the land. If a colt is born without a tail, the ruler will die.
In conclusion it may be observed that, apart from the unusual character of these freaks which would suffice to attrib
ute a special import to them, the notions current among the
Babylonians, as among so many people of a period when creatures existed, the various parts of which were compounded
1 The wife of the owner of the mare appears to be meant.



VARIOUS CLASSES OF OMENS. 397
of different animals, may be regarded as an additional factor that
served to add force to the class of omens we are considering.
The monsters guarding the approaches to temples and palaces 1 were but one form which this popular belief assumed, and when
a colt was observed to have a lion's or a dog's claw, an ocular
demonstration was afforded which at once strengthened and served to maintain a belief that at bottom is naught but a crude
and primitive form of a theory of evolution. In a dim way
man always felt the unity of the animal world. Animals resembled one another, and man had some features in common with animals. What more natural than to conclude that at some
period, the animals were composite creatures, and that even mankind and the animal world were once blended together.
The prevailing religious and semi-mythological ideas, accordingly, enter as factors in the significance that was attached to
infants or to the young of animals, serving as illustrations of
*
hybrid ' formations.
OMENS FROM THE ACTIONS OF ANIMALS.
The same order of ideas, only still further extended, may be detected in the sacredness attached to certain animals by so
many nations of antiquity. It is now generally admitted that
this ' sacredness ' has two sides. A sacred animal may be
'
taboo,' that is, so sacred that it must not be touched, much less
killed or eaten; and, on the other hand, its original sanctity
may lead people to regard it as " unclean," something again to be avoided, because of the power to do evil involved in the
primitive conception of ' sacredness.' 2 The swine and the dog are illustrations of this double nature
of sanctity among the Semites. The former was sacred to some
of the inhabitants of " Syria." 3 The Babylonians, as we have
1 See above, p. 138. 2 See Jevons, Introduction to the History of Religion, chapters vi.-ix. 3 Robertson Smith, Religion of the Semites, pp. 143, 273.



398 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION,
seen, abstained from eating it on certain days of the year,
while the Hebrews and Arabs regarded it as an absolute ' taboo.'
The dog to this day is in the Orient an " unclean " animal,
and yet it is forbidden to do dogs any injury. If, then, we find
the Babylonians attaching significance to the movements of this animal, it is obvious that by them, too, the dog was regarded as, in some way, sacred. It was an * animal of omen,' sometimes
good, at other times bad. A tablet informs us J that :
If a yellow dog enters a palace, it is a sign of a distressful fate for the
palace. If a speckled dog enters a palace, the palace 2 will give peace to the enemy. If a dog enters a palace and some one kills him, the peace of the palace will be disturbed. If a dog enters a palace and crouches on the couch, no one will enjoy
that palace in peace. If a dog enters a palace and crouches on the throne, that palace will suffer a distressful fate.
If a dog enters a palace and lies on a large bowl, the palace will secure peace from the enemy.
There follow omens in case dogs enter a sacred edifice :
If a dog enters a temple, the gods will not enlarge the land. If a white dog enters a temple, the foundation of that temple will be firm. If a black dog enters a temple, the foundation of that temple will not be firm.
If a brown 3 dog enters a temple, that temple will witness justice. If a yellow dog enters a temple, that temple will 4 witness justice. If a speckled dog enters a temple, the gods wrill show favor to that
temple. If dogs gather together and enter a temple, the city's peace will be disturbed.

The juxtaposition of palace and temple is an indication that a large measure of sanctity was attached to the former as the
dwelling-place of one who stood near to the gods. The omens,
accordingly, in the case of both palace and temple are again concerned with public affairs. But from the same tablet we
learn that an equal degree of significance was attached to the
actions of dogs when they entered private dwellings. Precautions must have been taken against the presence of dogs in that part of the house which was reserved for a man's family, for we
are told: L
A dog entering a man's house was an omen that the ultimate fate of that house would be destruction by fire.
Care had to be taken lest dogs defiled a person or any part of the house. The omens varied again according to the color of
the dog.
If a white dog defiles 2 a man, destruction will seize him. If a black dog defiles a man, sickness will seize him. If a brown dog defiles a man, that man will perish. If a dog defiles a man's couch, a severe sickness will seize that man. If a dog defiles a man's chair, the man will not survive the year. If a dog defiles a man's bowl,3 a deity will show anger towards the man.
On the other hand, dogs were not to be driven out of the
streets. Their presence in the roads was essential to the wel
fare of the place. Hence an omen reads:
If dogs do not enter the highway,4 destruction from an enemy will visit
the city.
Through Diodorus, Jamblichus, and other ancient writers we
know that the Babylonians and Assyrians attached importance to the movements of other animals, notably serpents, birds, and certain insects. The symbols on the boundary stones which

400 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
have been referred to l are based on this belief. The serpent
figures prominently among these symbols. In the Babylonian deluge story, the dove, raven, and swallow are introduced. Of these, the swallow appears to be the bird whose flight was most
carefully observed. The sign which represents this bird in the
cuneiform syllabary also signifies 'fate.' 2 The mischief wrought
by swarms of insects, as grasshoppers and locusts, the danger
.lurking in the bites of scorpions sufficiently explain the importance attached to the actions of these animals. The mysterious
appearance and disappearance of serpents and their strange twistings added an element in their case that increased the awe
they inspired, while if Ihering be correct,3 the omens derived from the flight of birds are a survival of the migratory period
in the history of a nation, when birds served as a natural guide
in choosing the easiest course to pass from one place to
another. A large number of tablets in Ashurbanabal's library treat of the significance attached to the action of these various
animals, and it is likely that these tablets form part of a large
series, of which the illustrations above adduced regarding the
movements of dogs form a part. In this series, the application of the omens to individuals is more strongly emphasized than
in the series of birth portents. Naturally so, for it was the indi
vidual as a general thing who encountered the signs. In the
case of the appearance of a serpent or snake, for example, the omen consisted in the fact that a certain person beheld it, and
that person was involved in the consequences. Fine distinc
tions are again introduced that illustrate the intricacies of the
system of interpretation perfected in Babylonia. If a snake passes from the right to the left side of a man, it means one
thing; if from the left to the right, another; if the man who
1 See p. 182.
2 According to Hilprecht (Old Babylonian Inscriptions, \. part 2, p. 35),
' a goose or similar water-bird ' was originally pictured by the sign, though he admits that the picture was ' later ' used for swallow.
3 Vorgeschichte der Indo-Europaer, pp. 451-55.



VARIOUS CLASSES OF OMENS. 401
sees a snake does not tread upon it, the omen is different than
in the case when he attempts to crush it. Again the omen
varies according to the occupation of the man who encountered a snake. If he be a gardener, the appearance of the snake
means something different than in the case of his being a
sailor.
The place where the animal appears is also of import^
whether in the street, the house, or the temple, and again, the time of its appearance, in what month or on what day. In the same way, an endless variety of omens are derived from
the appearance of certain birds, the direction of their flight, their
fluttering around the head of a man or entering a man's house.
So, e.g.,
If a raven 1 enters a man's house, that man will secure whatever he desires.
And again:
If a bird throws a bit of meat or anything into a man's house, that man will secure a large fortune.
The omens from the appearance of flocks of birds in a town
bore, as appears natural, upon public affairs rather than upon the fate of individuals, and similarly the appearance of birds in a temple was an omen for the whole country. The public or private character of the omens was thus depend
ent in large measure upon the question whether the phenomena
appeared to an individual directly or to the population of a place in general. Meeting a snake or scorpion in the course of a
walk through the fields was an individual omen, and similarly
the actions of sheep in a man's stall, whereas, a mad bull rushing through the city was a general omen. So we are told that
If sheep in the stalls do not bleat (?), that stall will be destroyed.

402 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
Whereas l
A bull crouching at the gate of a city is an omen that the enemy will
capture that gate.
A bull goring an ox in the city is an unfavorable omen for the city, but if the bull enters the precincts of an individual, it is favorable for the individual.
A series of omens derived from the appearance of locusts
again illustrates this principle. When the insects enter private
precincts, the individual and his immediate surroundings are
affected. 2
If black and speckled locusts appear in a man's house, the master of the house will die. If black and yellow locusts appear in a man's house, the supports of that house will fall. If large white locusts appear in a man's house, that house will be destroyed and the owner will be in distress. If white and brown locusts appear in a man's house, that house will be
destroyed. If small white and brown locusts appear in a man's house, the house will be destroyed and the owner will be in distress. If yellow locusts appear in a man's house, the supports of that house will fall and the owner of the house will be unlucky. If yellow-winged locusts appear in a man's house, the master of the house will die and that house will be overthrown.
OMENS FROM DREAMS.
It made little difference whether one encountered something while awake or saw it in one's dream. In fact, what one saw
while asleep had as a general thing more importance. A special god of dreams, Makhir, is often referred to in the
religious texts, and this is but another way of expressing the
belief that the dreams were sent to a man as omens. An
unusually wide scope was afforded to the compilers of omen
1 Bezold, Catalogue, p. 1710. 2 Boissier, Documents, etc., pp. 3, 4.



VARIOUS CLASSES OF OMENS. 403
serie^ in their interpretations of dreams, for what might not a man see in visions of the night ! If a lion l appears to a man,
it means that the man will carry out his purpose; if a jackal, it signifies that he will secure favor in the eyes of the gods ; a dog
portends sorrow; a mountain goat, that the man's son will die
of some disease; a stag, that his daughter will die; and so
through a long list. Again we are told 2 that
If (in a dream) a date appears on a man's head,3 it means that that man will be in distress.
If a fish appears on a man's head, that man will be powerful. If a mountain appears on a man's head, that man will be without a rival. If salt appears on a man's head, his house will be well protected (?).
Similarly, interpretations are offered for the apparition of the dead or of demons, in dreams. The book of Daniel affords
an illustration of the importance attached to dreams in
Babylonia, and of the science developed out of the interpretations. The sarcastic touch introduced by the compiler of the book, 4 who represents Nebuchadnezzar as demanding of his
priests not merely to interpret his dream, but to tell him what he dreamed, is intended to illustrate the limitations of the far
famed ' Chaldean wisdom.' It is also interesting to note in connection with the illustrations adduced, that the dreams of Nebuchadnezzar and Belshazzar 5 in the book of Daniel are so largely concerned with apparitions of animals. -The omens taken from dreams, together with the accidents
that occurred to an individual, or the phenomena occuring in a man's house, afford us an insight into the purely popular phases of the science of augury. While eclipses and the movements of
planets bear chiefly and almost exclusively on public affairs, and even birth portents frequently portend something to the ruler

404 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
or to the country, it was through such omens as partook of a purely personal character that the intentions of the gods towards
the individual were made manifest. By means of omens, the bond between the individual and the gods was not, indeed, established, but in large measure maintained. Here was a phase of the religion that touched each individual closely.
What a person saw, what he dreamed, what happened to him, what appeared in his house or among the members of his household was of significance to him. To know what every
phenomenon portended was essential to his welfare; and we may feel certain that the relations of the individual to the priests, so
far as these existed, consisted largely in obtaining from the latter the interpretation of the omens that he encountered.
On the other hand, the power of the priests over the populace was due to the popular belief in portents, and the attention
given by the theologians to the collection of exhaustive omen
series is a proof that the priests knew how to use their power. These "Dream Books "must have been very numerous. The success of the priests here depended even more than in other
branches of the omen literature upon exhausting, so far as pos
sible, all contingencies. No doubt they were guided here also
by two factors: association of ideas, and past experience through making of a single coincidence between a dream and some
occurrence, a principle of general application. Some of the omens from dreams, however, appear to have themselves
formed part of a larger series dealing in general with
OMENS FROM INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCES.
If one may judge from the specimens furnished by Dr. Bezold
in his catalogue, this series was unusually extensive, embracing a large number of subjects connected with human activity, a man's work in the field, his actions in commercial affairs, inci
dents of travel on sea or land, his relations to his kindred the



VARIOUS CLASSES OF OMENS. 405
dead as well as the living disease and death, down to such apparent trifles as the conditions of the walls of his house.
Cracks in the wall were an omen; meeting a snake in the high
way was an omen. A fall was an omen; dropping an instrument
was an omen; in short, it is difficult to say what was not an omen. The character of the omens in this series does not differ
in any essential particulars from those of other series. The
important feature of the series is that it affords another and
perhaps the most striking illustration of that phase of the omen
literature which concerns the individual directly, and, it seems
safe to add, exclusively. Take, for example, omens connected with symptoms occur
ring in certain diseases. We are told that
If the right breast is brown, it is a fatal (?) sign. If both breasts are brown, there will be no recovery. If the left breast is green, the sickness will be severe.
The symptoms affect the individual alone. Through this series we are thus enabled to determine more definitely the
boundary line between omens involving the affairs of the
country and king, and those involving the individual. A phe
nomenon affecting an individual, or appearing to him alone, or brought about through some action of his of a purely
private character, carries in its train an omen of significance for himself or his immediate surroundings ; but the moment
that these rather narrow limits are transcended, the fate of
the individual becomes more or less closely bound up with the
fortunes of the population and of the ruler of the country in
general. The series also illustrates, perhaps better than any other, the control exercised by popular beliefs over the acts
of the individual. For we may conclude, that if work on cer
tain days or' traveling at certain periods or the appearance of certain animals indicated something unfavorable to a man, he
would studiously avoid bringing misfortune upon himself and

observe the precautions involved in the interpretation of the vast mass of the accidents and incidents of existence. The task
was a difficult one, indeed, impossible of being carried out to perfection, but this would not hinder him from making the
attempt. He was satisfied if he warded off at least a fair number of unfavorable omens. Correspondingly, he would endeavor to so regulate his course as to encounter as large a number as
possible of omens that were favorable to him. In this way his
life would be spent with a constant thought of the gods and
spirits, who controlled all things in this world. The popular belief in omens made it incumbent upon the individual not to
lose sight at any time of his dependance upon powers over which he had but a limited control.
A certain phase of his religion thus entered largely into his
life. That phase would occupy him by day and by night. It
was a part of his religion which literally engaged him " upon
lying down at night, and upon rising up, while sitting in the house, and while walking on the way." If, despite all his
efforts, misfortune came, and misfortunes, of course, came constantly, there was no other recourse but to throw himself
upon the mercy of some god or gods. The gods, especially Marduk, Ishtar, Shamash, and Ramman, by putting 'grace' into the omens, could at any time change them into favorable
indications.



CHAPTER XXI.
THE COSMOLOGY OF THE BABYLONIANS.
'VARIOUS traditions were current in Babylonia regarding the manner in which the universe came into existence. The labors
of the theologians to systematize these traditions did not suc
ceed in bringing about their unification. Somewhat like in the
Book of Genesis, where two versions of the creation story have been combined by some editor, 1 so portions of what were clearly two independent versions have been found among the remains of Babylonian literature. But whereas in the Old Testament the two versions are presented in combination so
as to form a harmonic whole, the two Babylonian versions continued to exist side by side. There is no reason to sup
pose that the versions were limited to two. In fact, a variant
to an important episode in the creation story has been discovered which points to a third version.'2
The suggestion has been thrown out that these various
versions arose in the various religious centers of the Euphrates
Valley. So far as the editing of the versions is concerned,
the suggestion is worthy of consideration, for it is hardly reasonable to suppose that the .theological schools of one and the
same place should have developed more than one cosmological system. The traditions themselves, however, apart from the
1 The so-called Elohistic version, Gen. i. i-ii. 4 ; the Yahwistic version, Gen. ii. 5-24. Traces have been found in various portions of the Old Testament of other popular versions regarding creation. See Gunkel, Schopfung und C/iaos, pp. 29-1 14, 119-121. 2 Gunkel, #. pp. 28, 29. What Sayce (e.g., Rcc. of the Past, N. s., i. 147, 148) calls the ' Cuthaean legend of the creation ' contains, similarly, a variant description of Tiamat and her brood.



408 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
literary form which they eventually assumed, need not have been limited to certain districts nor have been peculiar to the
place where the systematization took place. Nothing is more common than the interchange of myths and popular traditions.
They travel from one place to the other, and contradictory accounts of one and the same event may be circulated, and find credence in one and the same place.
The two distinct Babylonian versions of the creation of the world that have up to the present time been found, have come
to us in a fragmentary form. Of the one, indeed, only some forty lines exist, and these are introduced incidentally in an incantation text ;
l of the other version, portions of six tablets 2
have been recovered; while of two fragments it is doubtful 8
whether they belong to this same version or represent a third
version, as does certainly a fragment containing a variant account of the episode described in the fourth tablet of the
larger group. The fragments of the longer version in all 23 enable us to form a tolerably complete picture of the Babylonian cosmology, and with the help of numerous allusions
in historical, religious and astronomical texts and in classical writers, we can furthermore fill out some of the gaps.
Taking up the longer version, which must for the present serve as our chief source for the cosmology of the Babylonians,
it is important to note at the outset that the series constitutes,
in reality, a grand hymn in honor of Marduk. The account of the beginning of things and of the order of creation is but
incidental to an episode which is intended to illustrate the
greatness of Marduk, the head of the Babylonian pantheon. This episode is the conquest of a great monster known as

Sac., 1891, pp. 393-408. 2 Complete publication by Delitzsch, Das Babylonische Weltschopftingsepos (Leipzig, 1896) with elaborate commentary. 3 See Zimmern in Gunkel's Schopfung und C/iaos, pp. 415, 416, and on the other side, Delitzsch, Babylonische WeltscJiopfungsepos, p. 20. Zimmern's doubts are
justified.



THE COSAWLOGY OF THE BABYLONIANS. 409
Tiamat, a personification, as we shall see, of primaeval chaos. What follows upon this episode, likewise turns upon the over
shadowing personality of Marduk. This prominence given to Marduk points of course to Babylon as the place where the early traditions received their literary form. Instead of desig
nating the series as a ' Creation Epic ' it would be quite as
appropriate to call it 'The Epic of Marduk.'
The god of Babylon is the hero of the story. To him the
creation of the heavenly bodies is ascribed. It is he who
brings order and light into the world. He supplants the roles
originally belonging to other gods. Bel and Ea give way to him. Anu and the other great gods cheerfully acknowledge Marduk's power. The early traditions have all been colored by the endeavor to glorify Marduk; and since Marduk is one
of the latest of the gods to come into prominence, we must descend some centuries below Hammurabi before reaching a
period when Marduk's position was so generally recognized as to lead to a transformation of popular traditions at the hands
of the theologians. The evident purpose of the 'epic' to glorify Marduk also accounts for the imperfect manner in which the creation of the universe is recounted. Only the general points are touched
upon. Many details are omitted which in a cosmological
epic, composed for the specific purpose of setting forth the order of creation, would hardly have been wanting. In this respect, the Babylonian version again resembles the Biblical
account of creation, which is similarly marked by its brevity, and is as significant for its omissions as for what it
contains. It but remains before passing on to an analysis of the '
epic
'
to note the great care bestowed upon its literary form. This is
evidenced not only by the poetic diction, but by its metrical
form, a point to which Budge was the first to direct attention 1
1 Proc. Soc. Bill. Arch. vi. 7.



410 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
and which Zimmern l clearly established. Each line consists
of two divisions, and as a general thing four or eight lines constitute a stanza. The principle of parallelism, so charac
teristic of Biblical poetry, is also introduced, though not con
sistently carried out.
The epic was known from its opening words as the series
' when above.' Through this name we are certain of possessing
a portion of the first tablet but alas ! only a portion. A
fragment of fifteen lines and these imperfectly preserved is all that has as yet been found. So far as decipherable, it reads :
There was a time when above the heaven was not named.2 Below, the earth bore no name. Apsu was there from the first, the source of both 3 And raging Tiamat the mother of both.3 But their waters 4 were gathered together in a mass. No field was marked off, no soil 5 was seen. When none of the gods was as yet produced, No name mentioned, no fate determined, Then were created the gods in their totality. Lakhmu and Lakhamu, were created. Days went by 6 ... Anshar and Kishar were created.

5 The word used is obscure. Jensen and Zimmern render " reed." Delitzsch, I think, comes nearer the real meaning with " marsh." See Haupt's translation, Proc. Amer. Oriental Soc.. 1896, p. 161.
6 Delitzsch supplies a parallel phrase like "periods elapsed." 7 Supplied from Damascius' extract of the work of Berosus on Babylonia. See Cory, Ancient Fragments, p. 92 ; Delitzsch, Babylonische \Vcltschopfnngscpos, p. 94



THE COSMOLOGY OF THE BABYLONIANS. 411
At this point the fragment breaks off.
Brief as it is, it affords a clear view of the manner in which
the Babylonians regarded the beginning of things. Water was the primaeval element. * Apsu ' is the personified great 'ocean'- the 'Deep' that covers everything. With Apsu there is associated Tiamat. Tiamat is the equivalent of the Hebrew T'hom, 1 which occurs in the second verse of the open
ing chapter of Genesis, and which is, like Apsu, the personification of the *
watery deep.' Apsu and Tiamat are, accordingly, synonymous. The combination of the two may be regarded as due to the introduction of the theological doctrine which we
have seen plays so prominent a part in the systematized pantheon, namely, the association of the male and female principle
in everything connected with activity or with the life of the
universe. Apsu represents the male and Tiamat the female
principle of the primaeval universe. It does not follow from
this that the two conceptions are wholly dissociated from popu
lar traditions. Theological systems, it will be found, are
always attached at some point to popular and often to primitive beliefs.
Tiamat was popularly pictured as a huge monster of a forbidding aspect. Traces of a similar conception connected with T'hom are to be met with in the poetry of the Old and New Testament.2 The ' Rahab ' and 'Leviathan' and the
' Dragon ' of the apocalypse belong to the same order of ideas that produced Tiamat. All these monsters represent a popular
attempt to picture the chaotic condition that prevailed before the great gods obtained control and established the order of
heavenly and terrestrial phenomena. The belief that water
1 The o is represented in Babylonian by d, and the ending at in Tiamat is an affix which stamps the Babylonian name as feminine. T'h6m in Hebrew is likewise a feminine noun, but it should be noted that at a certain stage in the development of the Semitic languages, the feminine is hardly distinguishable from the plural and collective.

412 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
was the original element existing in the universe and the
* source ' of everything, may also have had its rise in the popular
mind. It was suggested in the Euphrates Valley, in part, by the long-continued rainy season, as a result of which the entire
region was annually flooded. The dry land and vegetation appeared, only after the waters had receded. The yearly phenomenon brought home to the minds of the Babylonians, a
picture of primaeval chaos. In the schools of theology that arose with the advance of citlture, these two notions water as the first element and a
general conception of chaos were worked out with the result that Apsu and Tiamat became mythical beings whose dominion
preceded that of the gods. Further than this the questionings of the schoolmen did not go. They conceived of a time when neither the upper firmament nor the dry land existed and
when the gods were not yet placed in control, but they could not conceive of a time when there was '
nothing ' at all. This
cosmological theory which we may deduce from the fragment of the first tablet of the creation series is confirmed by the accounts that have come down to us chiefly through Damascius of the treatment of the subject by Berosus. 1 Damascius
explicitly places the Babylonians among those nations who fail to carry back the universe to an ultimate single source.
There is nothing earlier than the two beings Apsu and Tiimat. 2
The massing together of the primaeval waters completes the picture of chaos in the cuneiform account. From the popular
side, the commingling corresponds to the Tbhu wa Bbhti of the
Book of Genesis, but for the Babylonian theologians, this embrace of Apsu and Tiamat becomes a symbol of ' sexual '
1 For our purposes it is sufficient to refer for the relations existing between Damascius and the cuneiform records to Smith's Chaldaeische Genesis, pp. 63-66, to Lenormant's Essai de Commentaire sur les fragments Cosmogoniques de Berose,
pp. 67 seq., and to Jensen's Kosmologie der Babylonier, pp. 270-272. 2 The names are given by Damascius as Apason and Tauthe.



THE COSMOLOGY OF THE BABYLONIANS. 413
union. 1 As the outcome of this union, the gods are produced.
This dependence of the gods upon Apsu and Tiamat is but vaguely indicated. Another theory appears to have existed
according to which the gods were contemporaneous with primaeval chaos. The vagueness may therefore be the result
of a compromise between conflicting schools of thought. However this may be, the moment that the gods appear, a conflict ensues between them and Apsu-Tiamat. This conflict represents the evolution from chaos to order. But before
taking up this phase of the epic, a few words must be said
as to the names of the gods mentioned, and as to the order in
which they occur.
There are three classes of deities enumerated. The first
two classes consist, each, of a pair of deities while the third is
the well-known triad of the old Babylonian theology. Be
tween the creation of each class a long period elapses a circumstance that may be regarded as an evidence of the
originally independent character of each class. Now it has recently been shown 2 that Lakhamu is the feminine of Lakhmu.
The first class of deities is, therefore, an illustration again of
the conventional male and female principles introduced into the current theology. While there are references to Lakhmu
and Lakhamu in the religious texts,3 particularly in incantations, these two deities play no part whatsoever in the active
pantheon, as revealed by the historical texts. In popular
tradition, 4 Lakhmu survived as a name of a mythical monster.
Alexander Polyhistor 5 quotes Berosus as saying in his book on Babylonia that the first result of the mixture of water and

414 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
chaos i.e., of Apsu and Tiamat was the production of
monsters partly human, partly bestial. The winged bulls and
lions that guarded the approaches to temples and palaces are illustrations of this old notion, and it is to this class of
mythical beings that Lakhmu belongs. The schools of theol
ogy, seizing hold of this popular tradition, add again to Lakhmu a female mate and convert the tradition into a symbol
of the first step in the evolution of order out of the original
chaos. Lakhmu and Lakhamu are made to stand for an entire
class of beings that are the offspring of Apsu and Tiamat.
This class does not differ essentially from Apsu and Tiamat, nor from the '
Leviathan,' the *
Dragon,' the winged serpents, and the winged bulls that are all emanations of the same order
of ideas. Accordingly, we find Lakhmu and Lakhamu associated with Tiamat when the conflict with the gods begins. They are products of chaos and yet at the same time contem
porary with chaos, monsters not so fierce as Tiamat, but withal monsters who had to be subdued before the planets and
the stars, vegetation and man could appear. The introduction of Anshar and Kishar as intermediate between the monsters and the triad of gods appears to be due
entirely to the attempt at theological systematization that clearly stamps the creation epic as the conscious work of
schoolmen, though shaped, as must always be borne in mind, out of the material furnished by popular tradition. In con
nection with the etymology and original form of the chief of
the Assyrian pantheon, 1 the suggestion was made that the introduction of Anshar into the creation epic is a concession
made to the prominence that Ashur acquired in the north.
We are now able to put this suggestion in a more defi
nite form. The pantheon of the north, as we have seen, was derived from the south. Not that all the gods of the south
are worshipped in the north, but those that are worshipped
1 See above, pp. 198, 199.



THE COSMOLOGY OF THE BABYLONIANS. 415
in the north are also found in the south, and originate there.
The distinctive features of Ashur are due to the political con
ditions that were developed in Assyria, but the unfolding of the conceptions connected with this god which make him the
characteristic deity of Assyria, indeed, the only distinctive
Assyrian figure in the Assyrian pantheon, does not preclude the possibility, of the southern origin of Ashur.
If, as has been made plausible by Hommel, Nineveh, the
later capital of the Assyrian empire, represents a settlement made by inhabitants of a Nineveh situated in the south, there is no reason why a southern deity bearing the name Anshar should not have been transferred from the south to
the north. The attempt has been made l to explain the change from Anshar to Ashur. The later name Ashur, because of its
ominous character, effectually effaced the earlier one in popular thought. The introduction of the older form Anshar, not
merely in the first tablet of the creation series, but, as we shall
presently see, elsewhere, confirms the view of a southern
origin for Ashur, and also points to the great antiquity of the Anshar-Ashur cult. It is not uncommon to find colonies more conservative in matters of religious thought and custom than
the motherland, and there is nothing improbable in the interesting conclusion thus reached that Ashur, the head of an
empire, so much later in point of time than Babylonia, should turn out to be an older deity than the chief personage in the
Babylonian pantheon after the days of Hammurabi. But while Anshar-Ashur under this view is a figure surviving from an ancient period, he is transformed by association with a
complementary deity Kishar into a symbol, just as we have found to be the case with Lakhmu. By a play upon his name,
resting upon an arbitrary division of Anshar into An and Shar, the deity becomes the 'one that embraces all that is above.' The element An is the same that we have in Aim, and is the

'ideographic' 1 form for 'high' and 'heaven.' Shar signifies
'
totality
' and has some connection with a well-known Baby
lonian word for '
king.' The natural consort to an all-embrac
ing upper power is a power that ' embraces all that is below '
;
and since Ki is the ideographic form for '
earth,' it is evident that Ki-Shar is a creation of the theologians, introduced in
order to supply Anshar with an appropriate associate. The two in combination represent a pair like Lakhmu and Lakhamu. As the latter pair embrace the world of monsters, so
Anshar and Kishar stand in the theological system for the older order of gods, a class of deities antecedent to the series
of which Anu, Bel, and Ea are the representatives. Besides the antiquity of Anshar and the factor involved in the play upon
the name, the prominence of the Ashur cult in the north also
entered into play (as already suggested) in securing for AnsharAshur, a place in the systematized cosmology. The Babylonian priests, while always emphasizing the predominance of Marduk, could not entirely resist the influences that came to them from
the north. Ashur was not accorded a place in the Babylonian
cult, but he could not be ignored altogether. Moreover, Assyria had her priests and schools, and we are permitted to see in the introduction of Anshar in the creation epic, a concession
that reflects the influence, no doubt indirect, and in part perhaps unconscious, but for all that, the decided influence of the north over the south. The part played by Anshar in the most
important episode of the creation epic will be found to further
strengthen this view. 2
Kishar, at all events, forms no part of either the Babylonian or of the active Assyrian pantheon. She does not occur in his
torical or religious texts. Her existence is purely theoretical
a creation of the schools without any warrant in popular tradi
1 I avoid the term " Sumerian " here, because I feel convinced that the play on Anshar is of an entirely artificial character and has no philological basis.

THE COSMOLOGY OF THE BABYLONIANS. 417
tion, so far as we can see. A tablet is fortunately preserved 1 (though only in part) which enables us to come a step nearer
towards determining the character of the series of powers re
garded as antecedent to the well-known deities. In this tablet,
no less than ten pairs of deities are enumerated that are expressly noted as * Father-mother of Anu,' that is, as antecedent to Anu. 2 Among these we find Anshar and Kishar, and by
their side, such pairs as Anshar-gal, />.,
'
great totality of what
is on high,' and Kishar-gal, />., 'great totality of what is below,' Enshar and Ninshar, i.e.,
' lord ' and '
mistress,' respectively, of * all there is,' Du'ar and Da'ur, forms of a stem which
may signify
'
perpetuity,' Alala, i.e.,
'
strength,' and a consort Belili. Lakhmu and Lakhamu are also found in the list. While
some of the names are quite obscure, and the composition of the list is due to the scholastic spirit emanating from the
schools of theology, the fact that some of the deities, as
Alala, Belili, Lakhmu, and Lakhamu, occur in incantations shows that the theologians were guided in part by dimmed tra
ditions of some deities that were worshipped prior to the ones
whose cult became prominent in historic times. Anshar, Alala, Belili, Lakhmu, and Du'ar were such deities. To each of these an associate was given, in accord with the established doctrine
of 'duality' that characterizes the more advanced of the ancient
Semitic cults in general. Others, like Anshar-gal and Enshar, seem to be pure abstractions perhaps only
* variants ' of
Anshar, and the number ten may have some mystical significance that escapes us. So much, at all events, seems certain that even the old Babylonian pantheon, as revealed by the
oldest historical texts, represents a comparatively advanced
stage of the religion when some still older gods had already
yielded to others and a system was already in part produced which left out of consideration these older deities. This is

418 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
indicated by the occurrence of the triad Anu, Bel, and Ea as
early as the days of Gudea, 1 and it is this triad which in
the creation epic follows upon the older series symbolized by Anshar and Kishar. The later *
theology
' found a solution of
the problem by assuming four series of deities represented by Apsu and Tiamat, by Lakhmu and Lakhamu, by Anshar and Kishar, and by the triad Anu, Bel, and Ea. In a vague way, as we have seen, Apsu and Tiamat are the
progenitors of Lakhmu and Lakhamu. The priority, again, of Lakhmu and Lakhamu, as well as of Anshar and Kishar, is expressed by making them ' ancestors ' of Anu, Bel and Ea. While in the list above referred to, Lakhmu and Lakhamu are
put in a class with Anshar and Kishar, in the creation epic they
form a separate class, and Delitzsch has justly recognized, 2 in
this separation, the intention of the compilers to emphasize an advance in the evolution of chaos to order, which is the keynote of the Babylonian cosmology. Lakhmu and Lakhamu represent the * monster ' world where creatures are produced
in strange confusion, whereas Anshar and Kishar indicate a division of the universe into two distinct and sharply denned
parts. The splitting of ' chaos ' is the first step towards its
final disappearance. The creation of Anshar and Kishar marks indeed the beginning of a severe conquest which ends in the overthrow of Tiamat, and while in the present form of the epic, the contest is not decided before Anu, Bel, and Ea and the chief deities of
the historic pantheon are created, one can see traces of an
earlier form of the tradition in which Anshar perhaps with
some associates is the chief figure in the strife.
Of the first tablet, we have two further fragments supplementing one another, in which the beginnings of this terrible conflict are described. With Apsu and Tiamat there are associated a
1 See p. 107. 2 Babylonische Weltschopfungsepos, p. 94.



THE COSMOLOGY OF THE BABYLONIANS. 419
variety of monsters who prepare themselves for the fray. The
existence of these associates shows that the 'epic' does not
aim to account for the real origin of things, but only for the
origin of the order of the universe. At the beginning there was chaos, but *
chaos,' so far from representing emptiness (as came to be the case under a monotheistic conception of the
universe) was on the contrary marked by a superabundant fullness.
Through Alexander Polyhistor, 1 as already mentioned, we obtain a satisfactory description of this period of chaos as furnished by Berosus. At the time when all was darkness and
water, there flourished strange monsters, human beings with
wings, beings with two heads, male and female, hybrid forma
tions, half-man, half-animal, with horns of rams and horses' hoofs, bulls with human faces, dogs with fourfold bodies end
ing in fish tails, horses with heads of dogs, and various other
monstrosities. This account of Berosus is now confirmed by the cuneiform records. The associates of Tiamat are described in a manner
that leaves no doubt as to their being the monsters referred to.
We are told that
Ummu-Khubur,2 the creator of everything, added Strong warriors, creating great serpents, Sharp of tooth, merciless in attack. With poison in place of blood, she filled their bodies. Furious vipers she clothed with terror, Fitted them out with awful splendor, made them high of stature (?) That their countenance might inspire terror and arouse horror, Their bodies inflated, their attack irresistible.
1 Cory's Ancient Fragments, p. 58.
2 An epithet descriptive of Tiamat. " Ummu " is " mother " and " khubur " signi
fies " hollow "
;
" mother of the hollow " would be a poetic expression for " source of the deep," and an appropriate term to apply to TiSmat. It has nothing to do with
Omoroka. The latter, as Wright has shown, is a corruption of " O Marduk " (Zeits. /. Assyr. x. ;i-74)



420 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
She set up basilisks (?) great serpents and monsters 1
A great monster, a mad dog, a scorpion-man
A raging monster, a fish-man, a great bull, Carrying merciless weapons, not dreading battle.
In all, eleven monstrous beings are created by Tiamat for
the great conquest. At their head she places a being Kingu, whom she raises to the dignity of a consort.
The formal installation of Kingu is described as follows:
She raised Kingu among them to be their chief. To march at the head of the forces, to lead the assembly. To command the weapons to strike, to give the orders for the fray. To be the first in war, supreme in triumph. She ordained him and clothed him with authority (?).
Tiamat then addresses Kingu directly:
Through my word to thee, I have made thee the greatest among the
gods. The rule over all the gods I have placed in thy hand.
The greatest shall thou be, thou, my consort, my only one.
Tiamat thereupon
Gives him the tablets of fate, hangs them on his breast, and dismisses him. 'Thy command be invincible, thy order authoritative.' 2
The plan /of procedure, it would appear, is the result of a council of war held by Apsu and Tiamat, who feel themselves powerless to carry on the contest by themselves. The portion of the tablet 3 in which this council is recounted is in so bad a condition that but little can be made out of it. Associated with Apsu and Tiamat in council, is a being Mummu, and since Damascius expressly notes on the direct authority of
1 The word used is Lakhami, the plural of Lakhamu. 2 This scene, the description of the monsters and the installation of Kingu, occurs four times in the '
Epic.' See p. 424. 3 Delitzsch, Babylonische Weltschopfungsepos, p. 25.



THE COSMOLOGY OF THE BABYLONIANS. 421
Berosus that Apsu and Tiamat produced a son Moumis, 1 there
is every reason to believe that Mummu represents this off
spring. In the subsequent narrative, however, neither Apsu
nor Mummu play any part. Tiamat has transferred to Kingu and the eleven monsters all authority, and it is only after they are defeated that Tiamat but Tiamat alone enters
the fray. The rage of Tiamat is directed against Anshar, Kishar, and their offspring. Anu, Bel, and Ea, while standing at the head of the latter, are not the only gods introduced. When the con
test begins, all the great gods and also the minor ones are in
existence.
The cause of Tiamat's rage is indicated, though vaguely, in
the portions preserved. In the opening lines of the epic there is a reference to the time ' when fates were not yet
decided.' The decision of fates is in the Babylonian theology
one of the chief functions of the gods. It constitutes the
mainspring of their power. To decide fates is practically to control the arrangement of the universe to establish order.
It is this function which arouses the natural opposition of Tiamat and her brood, for Tiamat feels that once the gods in
control, her sway must come to an end. On the part of the
gods there is great terror. They are anxious to conciliate
Tiamat and are not actuated by any motives of rivalry. Order
is not aggressive. It is chaos which manifests opposition to ' order.' In the second tablet of the series, Anshar sends his son Anu with a message to Tiamat :
Go and step before Tiamat. May her liver be pacified, her heart softened.
Anu obeys, but at the sight of Tiamat's awful visage takes
flight. It is unfortunate that the second tablet is so badly pre
served. We are dependent largely upon conjecture for what
1 Cory, ib. p. 92.



422 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
follows the failure of Anu's mission. From references in
subsequent tablets, it seems certain that Anshar sends out Ea as a second messenger and that Ea also fails. Tiamat is
determined upon destroying the gods, or at least upon keep
ing from them the * decision of fates.' Anshar, it will be seen,
stands at the head of the pantheon, and it seems natural that
he, and not one of his offspring, should be the final victor. This indeed appears to have been the original form of the myth or at least one form of it. In a second form it was Bel
to whom the victory was ascribed, and this Bel of the triad, we
have seen, was En-lil, the chief god of Nippur ; but both
Anshar and Bel must give way to the patron deity of the city of Babylon Marduk. Anshar-Ashur, the head of the
Assyrian pantheon, could not be tolerated by the Babylonian priests as a power superior to Marduk. On the other hand, Anshar could not be set aside, for he survived in popular tradi
tion. The result is a compromise. Marduk gains the victory over Tiamat, but is commissioned to do so by the assembly of the gods, including Anshar. As for the older Bel, he volun
tarily transfers to Marduk his name. In this way, the god Bel of the triad becomes one with Marduk. Perhaps in one religious center and at a time when Ea was the chief god, still another version existed which assigned
the triumph to Ea, for as will be pointed out, traditions waver between assigning to Ea or to Bel-Marduk so fundamental a function as the creation of mankind. In short, the present form of the creation epic is ' eclectic ' and embodies what
the Germans call a tendenz. To each of the great gods, Anshar,
Anu, Bel, and Ea, some part in the contest is assigned, but the
greatest role belongs to Marduk. The second tablet closes with Anshar's decision to send his son Marduk against Tiamat :
Marduk heard the word of his father. His heart rejoiced and to his father he spoke.



THE COSMOLOGY OF THE BABYLONIANS. 423
With joyous heart he is ready to proceed to the contest, but he at once makes good his claim to supreme control in case he is victorious. He addresses the assembled gods :
When I shall have become your avenger,
Binding Tiamat and saving your life, Then come in a body, In Ubshu-kenna, 1 let yourselves down joyfully, My authority instead of yours will assume control, Unchangeable shall be whatever I do, Irrevocable and irresistible, be the command of my lips.
The declaration foreshadows the result.
The third tablet is taken up with the preliminaries for the
great contest, and is interesting chiefly because of the insight it affords us into Babylonian methods of literary composition. Anshar sends Gaga 2 to the hostile camp with the formal announcement of Marduk's readiness to take up the cause of
the gods. Gaga does not face Tiamat directly, but leaves the message with Lakhmu and Lakhamu :
Go Gaga, messenger (?) joy of my liver,
To Lakhmu and Lakhamu I will send thee.
The message proper begins as follows :
Anshar your son has sent me, The desire of his heart he has entrusted to me. Tiamat, our mother is full of hate towards us,
With all her might she is bitterly enraged.
The eleven associates that Tiamat has ranged on her side are
again enumerated, together with the appointment of Kingu as chief of the terror-inspiring army. Gaga comes to Lakhmu

424 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
and Lakhamu and delivers the message verbatim, so that alto
gether this portion of the narrative is repeated no less than four
times. 1 The same tendency towards repetition is met with in
the Gilgamesh epic and in the best of the literary productions of Babylonia. It may be ascribed to the influence exerted by
the religious hymns and incantations where repetition, as we
have seen, is also common, though serving a good purpose. The message concludes:
I sent Arm, he could not endure her 2 presence. Ea 3 was afraid and took to flight. Marduk has stepped forward, the chief of the gods, your son, To proceed against Tiamat, he has set his mind.
Marduk's declaration is then repeated.
Upon hearing the message Lakhmu and Lakhamu and " all
the Igigi" 4 are distressed, but are powerless to avert the coming disaster. The formal declaration of war having been sent, the followers of Anshar assemble at a meal which is realistically described:
They ate bread, they drank wine. The sweet wine took away their senses. They became drunk, and their bodies swelled up.
With this description the third tablet closes.
The meal symbolizes the solemn gathering of the gods. At its conclusion, so it would seem, Marduk is formally installed as the leader to proceed against Tiamat. The gods vie with one
another in showering honors upon Marduk. They encourage him for the fight by praising his unique powers:

Delitzsch, Babylonische Weltsch'dpfungscpos. p. 99, questions the identity with Ea, but his skepticism is unwarranted, though the title is also used of Bel. 4 Here used to comprise the army of Tiamat.



THE COSMOLOGY OF THE BABYLONIANS. 425
Thou art honored among the great gods,
Thy destiny is unique, thy command is Anu. 1 Marduk, thou.art honored among the great gods, Thy destiny is unique, thy command is Anu, Henceforth thy order is absolute. To elevate and to lower is in thy hands, What issues from thee is fixed, thy order cannot be opposed, None among the gods may trespass upon thy dominion.
Thy weapons will never be vanquished; they will shatter thy enemies.
O lord ! grant life to him who trusts in thee, But destroy the life of the god who plots evil.
As a proof of the power thus entrusted to Marduk, the gods
give the latter a '
sign.' Marduk performs a miracle. A garment is placed in the midst of the gods.
Command that the dress disappear ! Then command that the dress return !
Marduk proceeds to the test.
As he gave the command, the dress disappeared. He spoke again and the dress was there.
This '
sign,' which reminds one of Yahwe's signs to Moses
as a proof of the latter's power, 2 is to be regarded as an indica
tion that " destruction and creation " are in Marduk's hands.
The gods rejoice at the exhibition of Marduk's power. In
chorus they exclaim, "Marduk is king." The insignia of royalty,
throne, sceptre, and authority are conferred upon him.
Now go against Tiamat, cut off her life, Let the winds carry her blood to hidden regions.3
Marduk thereupon fashions his weapons for the fray. Myth and realism are strangely intertwined in the description of these
1 /.., thy power is equal to that of Anu. 2 Exod. iv. 2-8 ; other parallels might be adduced. 3 I*., far off.

weapons. Bow and quiver, the lance and club are mentioned, together with the storm and the lightning flash. In addition to
this he
Constructs a net wherewith to enclose the life of Tiamat. The four winds he grasped so that she could not escape.1 The south and north winds, the east and west winds He brought to the net, which was the gift of his father Anu.
His outfit is not yet complete.
He creates a destructive wind, a storm, a hurricane, Making of the four winds, seven 2 destructive and fatal ones; Then he let loose the winds he created, the seven, To destroy the life 3 of Tiamat, they followed after him.
Marduk, taking his most powerful weapon in his hand,4 mounts his chariot, which is driven by fiery steeds. The
picture thus furnished of the god, standing upright in his chariot, with his weapons hung about him and the seven winds
following in his wake, is most impressive. He makes straight for the hostile camp. The sight of the
god inspires terror on all sides.
The lord comes nearer with his eye fixed upon Tiamat, Piercing with his glance (?) Kingu her consort.
Kingu starts back in alarm. He cannot endure the *
majestic halo ' which surrounds Marduk. Kingu's associates the
monsters are terrified at their leader's discomfiture. Tiamat alone does not lose her courage.
Marduk, brandishing his great weapon, addresses Tiamat:
Why hast thou set thy mind upon stirring up destructive contest?
1 I.e., that a wind might not carry her off. 2 Adding three to the ordinary winds from the four directions. 3 For the explanation of the term used in the original kirbish see Delitzsch's

THE COSMOLOGY OF THE BABYLONIANS. 427
He reproaches her for the hatred she has shown towards the
gods, and boldly calls her out to the contest :
Stand up ! I and thou, come let us fight.
Tiamat's rage at this challenge is superbly pictured :
When Tiamat heard these words She acted as possessed, her senses left her; Tiamat shrieked wild and loud, Trembling and shaking down to her foundations. She pronounced an incantation, uttered her sacred formula.
Marduk is undismayed:
Then Tiamat and Marduk, chief of the gods, advanced towards one another.
They advanced to the contest, drew nigh for fight.
The fight and discomfiture of Tiamat are next described:
The lord spread out his net in order to enclose her. The destructive wind, which was behind him, he sent forth into her face. As Tiamat opened her mouth full wide, He 1 drove in the destructive wind, so that she could not close her lips. The strong winds inflated her stomach. Her heart was beset,2 she opened still wider her mouth,3 He seized the spear and plunged it into her stomach, He pierced her entrails, he tore through her heart, He seized hold of her and put an end to her life, He threw down her carcass and stepped upon her.
The method employed by Marduk is so graphically described
that no comment is necessary. After having vanquished Tiamat, the valiant Marduk attacks her associates. They try to flee,
but he captures them all including Kingu without much
difficulty and puts them into his great net. Most important of
1 Marduk. 2 She lost her reason. 3 Gasping, as it were, for breath.



428 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
all, he tears the tablets of fate from Kingu and places them on
his breast. This act marks the final victory. Henceforth, the gods with Marduk and no longer Tiamat and her brood
^decree the fate of the universe. There is great rejoicing among
the gods, who heap presents and offerings upon Marduk. As the vanquisher of chaos, Marduk is naturally singled out to be the establisher of the fixed form and order of the universe.
The close of the fourth tablet describes this work of the god,
and the subject is continued in the following ones. Unfor
tunately, these tablets are badly preserved, so that we are far from having a complete view of the various acts of Marduk. He
begins by taking the carcass of Tiamat and cutting it in half.
He cuts her like one does a flattened fish into two halves.
Previous to this he had trampled upon her and smashed her
skull, as we are expressly told, so that the comparison of the
monster, thus pressed out, to a flattened fish is appropriate.
He splits her lengthwise.
The one half he fashioned as a covering for the heavens,
Attaching a bolt and placing there a guardian, With orders not to permit the waters to come out.
It is evident that the canopy of heaven is meant. Such is
the enormous size of Tiamat that one-half of her body flattened
out so as to serve as a curtain, is stretched across the heavens
to keep the *
upper waters ' ' the waters above the firmament' as the Book of Genesis puts it from coming down. To
ensure the execution of this design a bolt is drawn in front of
the canopy and a guardian placed there, like at a city wall, to prevent any one or anything from coming out.
This act corresponds closely to the creation of a " firmament "
in the first chapter of Genesis. The interpretation is borne out
by the statement of Alexander Polyhistor who, quoting from Berosus, states that out of one-half of Tiamat the heavens were



THE COSMOLOGY OF THE BABYLONIANS. 429
made. 1 The further statement that out of the other half the
earth was fashioned is not definitely stated in our version of
the creation. The narrative proceeds as follows :
He passed through the heavens, he inspected the expanse.2
To understand this phrase, we must consider the general
character of the " epic," which is, as we have already seen, a
composite production, formed of popular elements and of more advanced speculations. The popular element is the interpretation of the storms and rains that regularly visit the Euphrates Valley before the summer season sets in, as a conflict between a monster and the solar deity Marduk. After a struggle, winds at last drive the waters back ; Tiamat is vanquished by the entrance of the * bad wind' into her body. The sun appears in
the heavens and runs across the expanse, passing in his course
over the entire vault. The conflict, which in the scholastic system
of the theologians is placed at the beginning of things, is in reality a phenomenon of annual occurrence. The endeavor to make Marduk more than what he originally was a solar deity leads to the introduction of a variety of episodes that properly
belong to a different class of deities. For all that, the orignal role of Marduk is not obscured. Marduk's passage across the
heavens is a trace of the popular phases of the nature myth,
and while in one sense, it is appropriately introduced after the
fashioning of the expanse, it more properly follows immediately upon the conflict with Tiamat. In short, we have reached a point in the narrative where the nature myth symbolizing the annual succession of the seasons blends with a cosmological
system which is the product of comparatively advanced schools
of thought, in such a manner as to render it difficult to draw
the line where myth ends and cosmological system begins. For

places,' here used as a synonym for ' heavens,' as an Assyrian commentator expressly states. See Delitzsch's remarks (Babylonische Weltschopfimgsepos, p. 147) against Jensen's and Zimmern's interpretation.

the moment, the nature myth controls the course of the nar
rative. The sun, upon running its course across the heavens,
appears to drop into the great ocean, which the Babylonians, in common with many ancient nations, imagined to surround and to pass underneath the earth. Hence the next act undertaken by Marduk is the regulation of the course of this subterranean sea. The name given to this sea was Apsu. Marduk however does not create the Apsu.
It is in existence at the beginning of things, but he places it under the control of Ea.
In front of Apsu, he prepared the dwelling of Nu-dimmud.1
This Apsu, as we learn from other sources,2 flows on all sides
of the earth, and since it also fills the hollow under the earth,
the latter in reality rests upon the Apsu. Ea is frequently called
" the lord of Apsu," but the creation epic, in assigning to Mar
duk the privilege of preparing the dwelling of Ea, reverses the true order of things, which may still be seen in the common belief that made Marduk the son of Ea. Marduk, the sun
rising up out of the ocean, becomes the offspring of Ea, and even the political supremacy of Marduk could not set aside the
prerogatives of Ea in the popular mind. In the cosmological system, however, as developed in the schools, such an attempt was made. While recognizing the * deep ' as the domain of Ea, the theologians saved Marduk's honor by having him take a
part in fixing Ea's dwelling and in determining its limitations. With the carcass of Tiamat stretched across the upper firma
ment and safely guarded, and with the Apsu under control, the way is clear for the formation of the earth. This act in the
drama of creation is referred to in the following lineSj though
in a manner, that is not free from obscurity. The earth is pictured as a great structure placed over the Apsu and corre
sponding in dimension with it at least in one direction.
1 /.., Ea. See above, p. 424, note 3. 2 The complete proof is brought by Jensen, Kosmologie, pp. 246-253.



THE COSMOLOGY OF THE BABYLONIANS. 431
The lord measured out the structure of Apsu. Corresponding to it, he fashioned a great structure l Esharra.
Esharra is a poetical designation of the earth and signifies,
as Jensen has satisfactorily shown, " house of fullness" 2 or
" house of fertility." The earth is regarded as a great struc
ture, and placed as it is over the Apsu, its size is dependent upon the latter. Its measurement from one end to the other cannot exceed the width of the Apsu, nor can it be any nar
rower. The ends of the earth span the great Apsu. The follow
ing line specifies the shape given to Esharra :
The great structure Esharra,' which he made as a heavenly vault.
The earth is not a sphere according to Babylonian ideas, but a hollow hemisphere having an appearance exactly like the vault of heaven, but placed in position beneath the heavenly
canopy. As a hemisphere it suggests the picture of a mountain, rising at one end, mounting to a culminating point, and descending at the other end. Hence by the side of Esharra, another name by which the earth was known was Ekur, that
is,
* the mountain house.'
Diodorus Seculus, in speaking of the Babylonian cosmology,
employs a happy illustration. He says that according to Baby
lonian notions the world is a " boat turned upside down." The
kind of boat meant is, as Lenormant recognized, 3 the deep-bottomed round skiff with curved edges that is still used for
carrying loads across and along the Euphrates and Tigris, the same kind of boat that the compilers of Genesis had in view
when describing Noah's Ark. The appearance in outline thus presented by the three divisions of the universe the heavens, the earth, and the waters would be that of two heavy rain

bows, one beneath the other at some distance apart, resting upon a large body of water that flows around the horizons of both rainbows, and also fills the hollow of the second one. 1 The upper ' rainbow ' is formed by one-half of the carcass of
Tiamat stretched across in semi-circular shape ; the lower one
is the great structure Esharra made by Marduk, while the Apsu
underneath is the dwelling of Ea. The creation epic, it may be
noted once more, takes much for granted. Its chief aim being
to glorify Marduk, but little emphasis is laid upon details of interest to us. The parcelling out of these three divisions
among Anu, Bel, and Ea is therefore merely alluded to in the
closing line of the fourth tablet :
He established the districts 2 of Anu, Bel, and Ea.
The narrative assumes what we know from other sources,
that the heavens constitute the domain of Anu, Esharra belongs
to Bel, while Apsu belongs to Ea. The mention of the triad takes us away from popular myth
to the scholastic system as devised by the theologians. The establishment of the triad in full control marks the introduction
of fixed order into the universe. All traces of Tiamat have dis
appeared. Anu, Bel, and Ea symbolize the eternal laws of the universe. There are, as we have seen, two factors involved in the role assigned to Marduk in the version of the creation epic under
consideration, one the original character of the god as a solar deity, the other the later position of the god as the head of the
Babylonian pantheon. In the 'epic,' the fight of Marduk with Tiamat belongs to Marduk as a solar deity. The myth is
based, as was above suggested,3 upon the annual phenomenon witnessed in Babylonia when the whole valley is flooded and
1 See the illustration in Jensen's Kosmologie, pi. 3.
2 The word used also means " cities." A Babylonian district is naught but an extended city. 3 See p. 429.



THE COSMOLOGY OF THE BABYLONIANS. 433
storms sweep across the plains. The sun is obscured. A conflict is going on between the waters and storms, on the one
hand, and the sun, on the other hand. The latter finally is
victorious. Marduk subdues Tiamat, fixes limitations to the
'
upper and lower waters,' and triumphantly marches across the heavens from one end to the other, as general overseer. This nature myth was admirably adapted to serve as the
point of departure for the enlargement of the role of Marduk, rendered necessary by the advancement of the god to the head
of the pantheon. Everything had to be ascribed to Marduk.
Not merely humanity, but the gods also had to acknowledge, and acknowledge freely, the supremacy of Marduk. The solar deity thus becomes a power at whose command the laws of the universe are established, the earth created and all
that is on it. In thus making Marduk the single creator, the theologians were as much under the influence of Marduk's
political supremacy, as they helped to confirm that supremacy by their system. With this object in view, the annual phenomenon was transformed into an account of what happened 'once
upon a time.'
What impressed the thinkers most in the universe was the
regular working of the laws of nature. Ascribing these laws to
Marduk, they naturally pictured the beginnings of things as a lawless period. Into the old and popular Marduk-Tiamat nature myth, certain touches were thus introduced that changed its entire character. This once done, it was a comparatively simple matter to follow up the conflict of Marduk and Tiamat
by a series of acts on Marduk's part, completing the work of general creation. The old nature myth ended with the conquest of the rains and storm and the establishment of the sun's
regular course, precisely as the deluge story in Genesis, which contains echoes of the Marduk-Tiamat myth, ends with the
promulgation of the fixed laws of the universe. 1

434 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
What follows upon this episode in the Babylonian epic is the elaboration of the central theme, worked out in the schools of
Babylonian thought and intended, on the one hand, to illustrate Marduk's position as creator and, on the other, to formu
late the details of the cosmological system.
With the fifth tablet, therefore, we leave the domain of popular
myth completely and pass into the domain of cosmological speculation. Fragmentary as the fifth tablet is, enough is preserved to show that it assumes the perfection of the zodiacal
system of the Babylonian schools and the complete regulation l of the calendar. In this zodiacal system, as has been intimated
and as will be more fully set forth in a special chapter, the
planets and stars are identified with the gods. The gods have
their ' stations ' and their *
pictures
' in the starry sky. The stars are the '
drawings' or '
designs of heaven.' It is Marduk
again who is represented as arranging these stations :
He established the stations for the great gods.2 The stars, their likeness,3 he set up as constellations.4 He fixed the year and marked the divisions.5 The twelve months he divided among three stars. From the beginning of the year till the close (?) He established the station of Nibir 6 to indicate their boundary. So that there might be no deviation nor wandering away from the course
He established with him,7 the stations of Bel and Ea.
An epitome of the astronomical science of the Babylonians is
comprised in these lines. The gods being identified with stars
1 See above, p. 370, and chapter xxii. 2 I.e., for each of the great gods. 3 I.e., of the gods.
4 A particular group of stars the masJii stars is mentioned, but the term seems to be used in a rather general sense. I cannot share Delitzsch's extreme skepticism with regard to the interpretation of the fifth tablet. Jensen seems to have solved the chief difficulties.
5 Jensen and Zimmern interpret " he drew the pictures," referring the phrase to the contours of the stars ; but the parallelism speaks in favor of connecting the
words with the " year." The divisions of the year or seasons seem to be meant. 6 /.., the planet Marduk, or Jupiter. 7 /.e., with Nibir.



THE COSMOLOGY OF THE BABYLONIANS. 435
and each of the latter having its place in the heavens ' to estab
lish the stations for the great gods' is equivalent to putting the
stars in position. The regulation of the year forms part of the astronomical science. The three stars that constitute ' divisions '
to aid in marking off the months are Nibir, Bel, and Ea. That
the Babylonians had such a system as is here outlined is con
firmed by Diodorus Seculus. 1 The position of Nibir, or Jupiter, whose course keeps closer to the ecliptic than that of any other
planet, served as an important guide in calendrical calculations.
The stars are represented as clinging to their course through
maintaining their relationship to Nibir, while at the side of Nibir and as additional guides, Bel is identified with the north
pole of the equator and Ea with a star in the extreme southern
heavens, to be sought for, perhaps, in the constellation Argo. The description concludes :
He attached large gates to both sides, Made the bolt secure to the left and right.
The heavens are thus made firm by two gates, fastened with
bolts and placed at either end. Through one of these gates
the sun passes out in the morning, and at evening enters into
the other. But the most important body in the heavens is the moon. Its functions are described in an interesting way :
In the midst 2 he made the zenith 3 (?) Nannar 4 he caused to go forth and handed over to him 5 the night.
He fixed him 6 as the luminary of night to mark off the days.
The passage is made clear by a reference to the Book of Genesis, i. 16, where we are told that the moon was created 'for
the rule of night.' A distinction between the Biblical and the
cuneiform cosmology at this point is no less significant. While

in this way. 2 /.e., of the heavens. Delitzsch renders " Schwerpunkt."

436 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
according to Babylonian ideas, the moon alone, or at most the moon with the stars, regulates the days, the Hebrew version makes the moon and sun together the basis for the regulation of the '
days and years.' The sun according to Babylonian notions does not properly belong to the heavens, since it passes daily beyond the limits of the latter. The sun, therefore, plays
an insignificant part in the calendrical system in comparison with the moon.
Marduk addresses the moon, specifying its duties, what
position it is to occupy towards the sun at certain periods
during the monthly course, and the like. The tablet at this point becomes defective, and before the address comes to an
end, we are left entirely in the lurch. To speculate as to the further contents of the fifth tablet and of the sixth (of which
nothing has as yet been found) seems idle. Zimmern supposes
that after the heavenly phenomena had been disposed of, the formation of the dry land and of the seas was taken up, and
Delitzsch is of the opinion that in the sixth tablet the creation
of plants and trees and animals was also recounted. I venture to question whether the creation of the *
dry land and seas ' was
specifically mentioned. Esharra, the earth, is in existence and the Apsu appears to include all waters, but that the epic treated of the creation of plant and animal life and then of the
creation of man is eminently likely. We have indeed a fragment of a tablet 1 in which the creation of the * cattle of the
field, beasts of the field, and creeping things of the field ' is referred to; but since it is the 'gods who in unison' are there
represented as having created the animal kingdom, it is hardly likely that the fragment forms part of our '
epic
' in which all
deeds are ascribed to Marduk. It belongs in all probability to
a different cosmological version, but so much can be concluded from it, that the Babylonians ascribed the creation of animals
to some divine power or powers ; and that therefore our 'epic'
1 Published by Delitzsch, Assyrische Lesestiicke (3d edition), p. 94.
i



THE COSMOLOGY OF THE BABYLONIANS. 437
must have contained a section in which this act was assigned to Marduk.
A similar variation exists with reference to the tradition of
the creation of mankind. There are distinct traces that the
belief was current in parts of Babylonia which made Ea the
creation of mankind. 1 Ea, it will be recalled, is the 'god of
humanity ' par excellence, and yet in the seventh (and probably closing) tablet of the series, Marduk is spoken of as the one "who created mankind." 2
Variant traditions of this kind point to the existence of
various centers of culture and thought in rivalry with one
another. The great paean to Marduk would have been sadly incomplete had it not contained an account of the creation of mankind the crowning work of the universe by the head of
the Babylonian pantheon. It is possible, therefore, that a tablet containing the address of a deity to mankind belongs to our series 8 and embodies orders and warnings given by Marduk after the creation of man, just as he addresses the moon after
establishing it in the heavens. Purity of heart is enjoined as
pleasing to the deity. Prayer and supplication and prostration are also commanded It is said that
Fear of god begets mercy, Sacrifice prolongs life, And prayer dissolves sin.
The tablet continues in this strain. It is perhaps not the kind of address that we would expect Marduk to make after the act
of creation, but for the present we must content ourselves with
this conjecture, as also with the supposition that the creation of
mankind constituted the final act in the great drama in which Marduk is the hero.
When Marduk's work is finished, the Igigi gather around him in adoration. This scene is described in a tablet which for
1 See the proof as put together by Jensen, Kosmologie, pp. 293, 294. - Line 15. 8 So Delitzsch, Babylonische Wcltschopfiingsepos, pp. 19, 20.



438 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
the present we may regard 1 as the close of the series. No less than fifty names are bestowed upon him by the gods, the
number fifty corresponding according to some traditions to the number of the Igigi. Marduk accordingly absorbs the qualities
of all the gods. Such is the purpose of this tablet. The
diction is at times exceedingly impressive.
God of pure life, they called [him] in the third place, the bearer of purification. God of favorable wind,2 lord of response 3 and of mercy,
Creator of abundance and fullness, granter of blessings,
Who increases the things that were small, Whose favorable wind we experienced in sore distress. Thus let them 4 speak and glorify and be obedient to him.
The gods recall with gratitude Marduk's service in vanquish
ing Tiamat. Marduk is also praised for the mercy he showed
towards the associates of Tiamat, whom he merely captured without putting them to death.
As the god of the shining crown in the fourth place, let them [i.e., mankind] exalt him. The lord of cleansing incantation, the restorer of the dead to life,
Who showed mercy towards the captured gods, Removed the yoke from the gods who were hostile to him.
A later fancy identified the '
captured gods ' with eleven of the
heavenly constellations.5
Mankind is enjoined not to forget Marduk
Who created mankind out of kindness towards them, The merciful one, with whom is the power of giving life. May his deeds remain and never be forgotten By humanity, created by his hands.
1 Following Delitzsch, Babylonische Weltschdpftmgsepos, pp. 20, 21. I pass over two fragments which Delitzsch adds to our '
epic.' They are not sufficiently clear to be utilized for our purposes. Delitzsch may be right with regard to no. 20, but if so, it forms part or another version of the Marduk-Tiamat episode. No. 19, treating of the bow of Marduk (?), does not seem to belong to our series.

THE COSMOLOGY OF THE BABYLONIANS. 439
Among other names assigned to him are ' the one who knows
the heart of the gods,'
' who gathers the gods together,'
' who
rules in truth and justice.' In allusion again to his contest
with Tiamat, he is called * the destroyer of the enemy and of all
wicked ones,' 'who frustrates their plans.'
With the help of a pun upon his having
*
pierced
' Tiamat, he
is called Nibir, />., the planet Jupiter. 1
Nibir be his name, who took hold of the life of Tiamat. The course of the stars of heaven may he direct.
May he pasture all of the gods like sheep.2
But the climax is reached when, upon hearing what the Igigi
have done, the great gods, father Bel and father Ea cheerfully bestow their own names upon Marduk.
Because he created the heavens and formed the earth ' Lord of Lands ' 3 father Bel called his name. When he heard of all the names that the Igigi bestowed Ea's liver rejoiced That they had bestowed exalted names upon his son.
" He as I Ea be his name. The control of my commands.be entrusted to him.
To him my orders shall be transmitted."
The historical background to this transference of the name
of Bel has been dwelt upon in a previous chapter. 4 This
" Marduk hymn " is to justify the transference of the role of the
older Bel of Nippur to the younger god Marduk. Throughout the tablet describing the contest of Marduk with Tiamat, Mar
duk is called Bel,5 and while this name is used in the generic sense of "lord," the transference of the name of Bel to Marduk
is evidently introduced to account for his assuming the prerog
1 See above, p. 434. The play is between Nibir (as though from the stem eberu) and itcbbiru (" he pierced "), a form of eberu, and meaning ' to pass through.' 2 This metaphor is carried over into astronomical science. The planets are known as "wandering sheep." See p. 459. 3 Bel matate. 4 See p. 118. 5 Similarly in another version of the contest published by Delitzsch, Assyr. \\ '</;Icrbuch, p. 390.



440 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
atives belonging to another god. The original
* lord ' was En-lil
of Nippur. The sacred significance of ancient Nippur made its patron deity the most important rival of Marduk. Bel
could not be disposed of as Ea, who by virtue of his mythological relationships to Marduk a solar deity could be retained as
the father of Marduk. There was nothing left but for Marduk to take the place of Bel. The constant introduction of the
epithet
f Bel ' into the Tiamat story points to an older version
in which Bel was the hero. In popular traditions, Bel continued
to be pictured as armed with mighty weapons, 1 and, though ready to inflict severe punishment for disobedience to his commands, he engages in contests for the benefit of mankind. The earth
being his special sphere of action, what more natural than that he should have had a prominent share in adapting it as a habi
tation for mankind. He would be directly interested in fighting the powers of darkness.
In the weapons that Marduk employs, particularly the lightning and the winds which belong to an atmospheric god rather than a solar deity, we may discern traces of the older narrative which has been combined with the Marduk-Tiamat nature myth. 2
It may be that Kingu represents Bel's particular rival. In the nar
rative, it will be recalled, the contest with Tiamat is sharply separated from that with Kingu and his associates. The division
that thus suggests itself between Marduk and Tiamat, on the one hand, Bel and the monsters with Kingu at their head, on the
other, may certainly be termed a natural one. The solar deity
Marduk disposed of the storms and rains of the winter, whereas, a god of "that which is below," 3
i.e., the earth and the
atmosphere immediately above the earth, would appropriately be represented as ridding the earth of the monsters in order to
1 See p. 54. 2 Tiele (Gesch. der Religion im Alterthum, I. 176) assigns to Marduk a double character, making him both a god of light and a god of storms, but I venture to think that the latter attribute represents the transference of En-lil's power to Marduk. 3 So Bel is called in contrast to Anu. See p. 53.



THE COSMOLOGY OF THE BABYLONIANS. 441
prepare it as a habitation for mankind. Ea was not such a
serious rival to Marduk as the older Bel. Political rivalry between Nippur and Babylonia probably contributed towards
the disposition to have Marduk completely absorb the role of
Bel, whereas, this rivalry being absent in the case of Eridu
(the original seat of Ea worship) and Babylon, the mythological relations between Ea and Marduk led, as already pointed out, in a perfectly natural way to making Marduk the son of Ea.
Still, while cheerfully acknowledged by Ea as his equal, it is evident that in older traditions Ea was far superior to Marduk,
and the latter replaces Ea as he does Bel. The real creator
of mankind, according to certain traditions, is Ea, just as in all probabilities a third tradition existed which arose
in Nippur giving to Bel that distinction. It is necessary,
therefore, for Ea to declare that Marduk's name (i.e., his
power) is the same as Ea. The alteration of the traditions is thus justified by a harmonistic theology. Marduk has
triumphed over Bel and Ea. The god of Babylon reigns supreme, his sway acknowledged by those whom he supplants. Marduk's declaration that in the event of his vanquishing
Tiamat he will assume authority over all the gods is thus
formally confirmed. The epic closes grandiloquently:
With fifty names, the great gods According to their fifty names, proclaimed the supremacy of his course.
The compiler has added to the epic what Delitzsch appropri
ately designates an '
epilogue,' a declaration of affection for
Marduk. The epilogue consists of three stanzas. All man
kind royalty and subjects are called upon to bear in mind
Marduk's glorious deeds, achieved for the benefit of the world.
Let the wise and intelligent together ponder over it. Let the father relate it and teach it to his son.1
1 One is reminded of the Biblical injunction with regard to the Laws of Yahwe, Deut. vi. 7 :
" Thou shalt teach them to thy sons and speak constantly of them."



442 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION,
To leader and shepherd l be it told. Let all rejoice in the lord of gods, Marduk That he may cause his land to prosper and grant it peace. His word is firm, his order irrevocable. What issues from his mouth, no god can alter.
Marduk's anger, the poet says in closing, terrifies even the
gods, but he is a god upon whose mercy one may rely, though he punishes the evil-doer.
Bearing in mind the general nature of the creation epic we have discussed, we must of course in our conclusions distinguish between those elements in it which reflect the
intent of the compiler or compilers to glorify Marduk at the expense of other gods and such parts as bear the stamp
of being generally accepted beliefs. Setting aside, therefore, the special role assigned to Marduk, we find that the
Babylonians never developed a theory of real beginnings. The creatio ex nihilo was a thought beyond the grasp even of
the schools. There was always something, and indeed there was
always a great deal as much perhaps at the beginning of things as at any other time. But there was no cosmic order.
Instead of a doctrine of creation, we have a doctrine of evo
lution from chaos to the imposition of eternal laws. The manifestation of these laws was seen first of all in the move
ments of the heavenly bodies. There was a great expanse, presenting the appearance of a stretched-out curtain or a
covering to which the stars and moon were attached. Along
this expanse the wandering stars moved with a certain regu
larity. The moon, too, had its course mapped out and the sun
appeared in this expanse daily, as an overseer, passing along the whole of it. This wonderful system was the first to be
perfected, and to the solar deity,
2 which seemed to control
everything, was ascribed the distinction of having introduced
the heavenly order. This notion we may well believe was of
1 /.<?., to the kings who are frequently called ' shepherds ' in the historical texts.
2 Or, according to the earlier view, to an atmospheric god.



THE COSMOLOGY OF THE BABYLONIANS. 443
popular origin, though elaborated in the schools to conform
to a developed astrological science. The stars and moon never passed beyond certain limits, and,
accordingly, the view was developed which gave to the canopy of heaven fixed boundaries. At each end of the canopy was a
great gate, properly guarded. Through one of these the sun passed in rising out of the ocean, through the other it passed out when it had run its course. Learned speculation could not
improve upon this popular fancy. As the heavens had their limitations, so also the great bodies of water were kept in check
by laws, which, though eternal, were yet not quite as inexorable as those controlling the heavenly bodies. The yearly overflow of the Euphrates and Tigris was too serious a matter to
be overlooked, and we shall see in a following chapter 1 how this phenomenon was interpreted as a rivalry between Bel and Ea, deliberately caused by the former in anger toward mankind.
Still, as a general thing, the '
deep,' presided over by Ea, kept within the limits assigned to it. The waters above the canopy were under rigid control, and the lower waters flowed around the earth and underneath it, and bordered the canopy of heaven at its two ends.
The earth itself was a vast hollow structure, erected as a
" place of fertility
" under the canopy of heaven and resting
on the great
e
deep.' Its vegetation was the gift of the gods.
'
Fertility
' summed up the law fixed for the earth. Much as in
the Book of Genesis, " to multiply and increase " was the order
proclaimed for the life with which the earth was filled. The creation of mankind was the last act in the great drama.
Assigned in some traditions to Ea, in others as it would seem
to Bel, the transfer of the traditions to Marduk is the deliber
ate work of the schools of theological thought. The essential
point for us is that mankind, according to all traditions, is the product of the gods. In some form or other, this belief was
i " The Gilgamesh Epic."



444 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
popularly held everywhere. Its original form, however, is obscured beyond recognition by the theory which it is made to serve.
A second version of the course of creation l agrees in the
main with the first one, but adds some points of interest. In
this version, likewise, Marduk is assigned the most important role an evidence that it was produced under similar influ
ences as the larger epic. So far as preserved, the second
version differs from the first in its brevity and in the promi
nence given to such themes as the development of animal life
and the growth of civilization. It fills out to a certain de
gree the gaps in the first version, due to the fragmentary condition of the fifth tablet and the loss of the sixth. The
brevity of the second version is due in part to the fact that
it is introduced into an incantation text, and, what is more,
incidentally introduced. It begins as does the larger epic with the statement regarding the period when the present phenomena of the universe were
not yet in existence, but it specifies the period in a manner which gives a somewhat more definite character to the conception of this ancient time.
The bright house of the gods was not yet built on the bright place,
No reed grew and no tree was formed,
No brick was laid nor any brick edifice 2 reared,
No house erected, no city built, No city reared, no conglomeration 3 formed. Nippur was not reared, E-Kur 4 not erected. Erech was not reared, E-Anna 6 not erected.
1 First published by Pinches, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1891, pp. 393-408. 2 Clay, it will be recalled, was the building material in Babylonia.
3 The word in the text is generally applied to " a mass " of animals, but also to human productions. See Delitzsch, Assyr. Handw'drterbuchj p. 467. 4 Bel's temple at Nippur. 5 Temple of Ishtar at Erech or Uruk.



THE COSMOLOGY OF THE BABYLONIANS. 445
The deep 1 not formed, Kridu- not reared. The bright house, the house of the gods not yet constructed as a dwelling. The world 3 was all a sea.
Again it will be observed that neither popular nor scholastic
speculation can picture the beginning of things in any other way than as an absence of things characteristic of the order of
the universe.
The bright 4 house of the gods corresponds to Eshara and the
canopy of heaven in the first version. The gods are again identi
fied with the stars, and it is in the heavens the bright place
that the gods dwell.5 The reference to the absence of vegeta
tion agrees closely with the corresponding passage in the larger creation epic. The limitations of the cosmological speculations of the Babylonians find a striking illustration in the manner in
which the beginnings of human culture are placed on a level
with the beginnings of heavenly and terrestrial phenomena. Nippur, Erech, and Eridu, which are thus shown to be the
oldest religious centers of the Euphrates Valley, were indissolubly associated in the minds of the people with the beginning
of order in the universe. Such was the antiquity of those cities
as seats of the great gods, Bel, Ishtar, and Ea, that the time when they did not exist was not differentiated from the creation
of the heavens and of plant life. This conception is more
clearly emphasized by the parallelism implied between Eridu and the '
deep.' The ' formation ' of Apsu corresponds to the ' structure ' made by Marduk according to the first version, as the seat of Ea. The waters were not created by Marduk, but

' totality of lands.'
4 Zimmern's rendering (Gunkel, Schoffung und Chaos, p. 419) "sacred" (instead of '
bright ') misses the point. 5 Cf. S. A. Smith, Miscellaneous, K. 2866, 1. 8, "the great gods dwelling in the heaven of Anu." The reference, therefore, cannot be to "the gathering place of the gods," where the fates of mankind are decided.



446 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
they were confined by him within a certain space. In a vagu& way, the ' deep ' itself rested in a vast tub. The waters flowed
freely and yet not without limitation.
The contest with Tiamat is not referred to in this second
version, and this may be taken as an indication that the 'nature'
myth was not an ingredient part of cosmological speculations, but only introduced into the first version because of its associations with Marduk.
The appearance of dry land is described somewhat vaguely
as follows:
There was a channel 1 within the sea. At that time Kridu was erected, E-Sagila 2 was built, E-Sagila in the midst of the 'deep,' where the god of the glorious abode 3 dwells.
The mention of the channel appears to imply that the waters
were permitted to flow off in a certain direction.
The conception would then be similar to the view expressed
in Genesis, where the dry land appears in consequence of the waters being
*
gathered ' into one place. 4 The temple at Eridu is regarded as synonymous with the city, as the temples E-Kur and E-Anna are synonymous with Nippur and Erech respectively. Eridu at the head of the Persian Gulf, which for the
Babylonians was the beginning of the great 'Okeanos' surround
ing the world, 5 is the first dry land to appear and hence the

The passage is obscure ; the text possibly defective. 2 If the reading E-Sagila is original, it is here used as the name of Ea's temple in Eridu, but it is of course possible that E-Sagila has been deliberately introduced to enhance the glory of Marduk's temple in Babylon. 8 Ea. 4 Gen. i. 9. 5 See Haupt, Wo lag das Parodies, p. 7 (Uebcr Land und Mcer, 1894-95, no. 15, Sonderabdruck), who furnishes numerous illustrations of the indefinite geographical notions of the ancients.



THE COSMOLOGY OF THE BABYLONIANS. 447
oldest place in the world. At this point in the narrative a line
is interpolated which clearly betrays the lateness of the version.
The mention of E-Sagila suggests to a Babylonian, naturally, the great temple of Marduk in the city of Babylon 'the lofty house.' Local pride and the desire to connect Babylon with
the beginning of things leads to the insertion :
Babylon was reared, E-Sagila built.
With this mention of Babylon, the connecting link is estab
lished which leads easily to the glorification of Babylon and Marduk. The thought once introduced is not abandoned. The
rest of the narrative, so far as preserved, is concerned with
Marduk. Eridu alone is beyond his jurisdiction. Everything else, vegetation, mankind, rivers, animals, and all cities, including even Nippur and Erech, are Marduk's work.
The Anunnaki 1 he 2 created together
And bestowed glorious epithets upon the glorious city, the seat dear to their heart.
The '
glorious city
' is Eridu, though the compiler would have
us apply it to Babylon. With the founding of Eridu, a limit was fixed for the *
deep.' The rest of the dry land is formed according to the theory of the writer by the extension of this place.
Marduk constructed an enclosure around the waters, He made dust and heaped it up within the enclosure.3
The na'iveti of the conception justifies us in regarding it as of popular origin, incorporated by the theologians into their system. But this land is created primarily for the benefit of the gods.

448 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
Naturally not all of the gods are meant, perhaps only the Anunnaki, for the great gods dwell in heaven. The creation
of mankind is next described, and is boldly ascribed to
Marduk. Mankind he created.1
In the following line, however, we come across a trace again of an older tradition, which has been embodied in the narrative in a rather awkward manner. Associated with Marduk in the
creation of mankind is a goddess Aruru.
The goddess Aruru created the seed of men together with him.2
We encounter this goddess Aruru in the Gilgamesh epic,3
where she is represented as creating a human being, Eabani; and, curiously enough, she creates him in agreement with the Biblical tradition, out of a lump of clay. It has already been pointed out that according to one tradition Ea is the creator
of mankind, 4 and the conjecture has also been advanced that at Nippur, Bel was so regarded. In Aruru we have
evidently a figure to whom another tradition, that arose in some district' ascribed the honor of having created mankind. The
Gilgamesh story is connected with the city of Erech, and it is
probable that the tale at least in part originated there. It
becomes plausible, therefore, to trace the tradition ascribing the
creation of man to Aruru to the same place. A passage in the
Deluge story, which forms an episode of the Gilgamesh epic, adds some force to this conjecture. After the dreadful deluge has come, Ishtar breaks out in wild lament that mankind, her off
spring, has perished :

the same epithet in a lexicographical tablet. The Ishtar occurring in the Gilgamesh story is the old Ishtar of Erech. I ven
ture to suggest, therefore, that Aruru and Ishtar of Erech are one and the same personage. Ishtar is, of course, as has been
pointed out, merely a generic name l for the '
great goddess ' worshipped under many forms. The more specific name by which Ishtar of Erech was known was Nana, but Nana
again is nothing but an epithet, meaning, as the Babylonians themselves interpreted it, the '
lady
' par excellence? Have we
perhaps in Aruru the real name of the old goddess of Erech ? At all events, the occurrence of Aruru in this second c creation '
story points to her as belonging to the district of which Erech
was the center. In this way, each one of the three most ancient sacred towns of Babylonia would have its '
creator,' Bel in Nippur, Ea in Eridu, and Aruru in Erech. The chief deity of
Erech, it will be recalled, was always a goddess, a circumstance that supports the association of Aruru with that place.
Aruru being a goddess, it was not so easy to have Marduk
take up her role, as he supplanted Bel. Again, Erech and
Babylon were not political rivals to the degree that Nippur and
Babylon were. Accordingly a compromise was effected, as in the case of Marduk and Ea. Aruru is associated with Marduk. She creates mankind with Marduk, and it would seem to be a consequence of this association that the name of Marduk's real
consort, Sarpanitum, is playfully but with intent interpreted by
the Babylonian pedants as 'seed-producing.' 3 Our second version thus turns out to be, like the first, an
adaptation of old traditions to new conditions. Babylon and
Marduk are designedly introduced. In the original form Nip
pur, Eridu, and Erech alone figured, and presumably, therefore, ^ only the deities of these three places. Among them the work
of creation was in some way parceled out. This distribution

450 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION,
may itself have been the result of a combination of independent
traditions. In any early combination, however, we may feel certain that Marduk was not introduced.
After this incidental mention of Aruru, the narrative passes back undisturbed to Marduk.
The animals of the field, the living creatures of the field he created,
The Tigris and Euphrates he formed in their places, gave them good names, Soil (?), grass, the marsh, reed, and forest he created, The verdure of the field he produced, The lands, the marsh, and thicket, The wild cow with her young, the young wild ox, The ewe with her young, the sheep of the fold, Parks and forests, The goat and wild goat he brought forth.
The text at this point becomes defective, but we can still make out that the clay as building material is created by Marduk, and that he constructs houses and rears cities. Corre
sponding to the opening lines, we may supply several lines as follows:
Houses he erected, cities he built,
Cities he built, dwellings he prepared, Nippur he built, E-Kur he erected, Erech he built, E-Anna he erected.
Here the break in the tablet begins.
The new points derived from this second version are, (a) the details in the creation of the animal and plant world, (b) the mention of Aruru as the mother of mankind, and (c) the in
clusion of human culture in the story of the f
beginnings.' Before leaving the subject, a brief comparison of these two versions with the opening chapters of Genesis is called for.
That the Hebrew and Babylonian traditions spring from a common source is so evident as to require no further proof. The
agreements are too close to be accidental. At the same time,



THE COSMOLOGY OF THE BABYLONIANS. 451
the variations in detail point to independent elaboration of the
traditions on the part of the Hebrews and Babylonians.
A direct borrowing from the Babylonians has not taken place, and while the Babylonian records are in all probabilities much
older than the Hebrew, the latter again contain elements, as Gunkel has shown, of a more primitive character than the Baby
lonian production. This relationship can only be satisfactorily explained on the assumption that the Hebrews possessed the traditions upon which the Genesis narrative rests long before
the period of the Babylonian exile, when the story appears, indeed, to have received its final and present shape. The
essential features of the Babylonian cosmology formed part of
a stock of traditions that Hebrews and Babylonians (and probably others) received from some common source or, to put it more vaguely, held in common from a period, the limits of which can no longer be determined. While the two Babylonian ver
sions agree in the main, embodying the same general traditions
regarding the creation of the heavenly bodies and containing the same general conception of an evolution in the world from
confusion and caprice to order, and the establishment of law,
the variations in regard to the terrestrial phenomena must not
be overlooked. According to the first version, mankind appears
as the last episode of creation ; in the second, mankind precedes
vegetation and animal life. If we now take up the two versions of creation found in
Genesis, we will see that the same differences may be observed.
According to the first, the so-called Elohistic version, 1 mankind
is not created until the last day of creation; according to the
second, 2 the so-called Yahwistic version, mankind is first
created, then a garden is made and trees are planted. After that, the beasts of the field and the birds of heaven are called
into existence.
1 Gen. i. i-ii. 4, embodied in the " Priestly Code." 2 Gen. ii. 4 and extending in reality as far as iv. 25.



452 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
The resemblance of the second Babylonian version to the Yahwistic version extends even to certain phrases which they have in common. The opening words of the Yahwist
And no plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field
had yet sprung up
might serve almost as a translation of the second line of the
Babylonian counterpart. The reference to the Tigris and Euphrates in the second Babylonian version reminds one of the four streams mentioned in the Yahwistic version, two of
which are likewise the Tigris and Euphrates. Again, Tiamat
is mentioned only in the first Babylonian version, and T'hom
similarly only in the Elohistic version; while, on the other hand, the building of cities is included in the Yahwistic version, 1 as
it forms part of the second Babylonian version. The points
mentioned suffice to show that the Elohistic version is closely
related to the larger creation epic of the Babylonians, while the Yahwistic version more concise, too, than the Elohistic
agrees to an astonishing degree with the second and more concise Babylonian record.
The conclusion, therefore, is justified that the variations between the Babylonian versions rest upon varying traditions
that must have arisen in different places. The attempt was
made to combine these traditions by the Babylonians, and
among the Hebrews we may see the result of a similar attempt
in the first two or, more strictly speaking, in the first three chapters of Genesis. At the same time, the manner in which both traditions have been worked over by the Hebrew compilers
of Genesis precludes, as has been pointed out, the theory of a direct borrowing from cuneiform documents. The climatic conditions involved in the Hebrew versions are those peculiar
to Babylonia. It is in Babylonia that the thought would naturally arise of making the world begin with the close of the
1 Gen. iii. 17.



7Y77i COSMOLOGY OF THE BABYLONIANS. 453
storms and rains in the spring. The Terahites must therefore
have brought these cosmological traditions with them upon
migrating from the Euphrates Valley to the Jordan district. The traditions retained their hold through all the vicissitudes
that the people underwent. The intercourse, political and com
mercial, between Palestine and Mesopotamia was uninterrupted, as we now know, from at least the fifteenth century before our
era down to the taking of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar, and this constant intercourse was no doubt an important factor in main
taining the life of the old traditions that bound the two peoples
together. The so-called Babylonian exile brought Hebrews and Babylonians once more side by side. Under the stimulus of
this direct contact, the final shape was given by Hebrew writers
to their cosmological speculations. Yahwe is assigned the role of Bel-Marduk, the division of the work of creation into six
days is definitely made, 1 and some further modifications intro
duced. While, as emphasized, this final shape is due to the
independent elaboration of the common traditions, and, what
is even more to the point, shows an independent interpretation of the traditions, it is by no means impossible, but on the con
trary quite probable, that the final compilers of the Hebrew versions had before them the cuneiform tablets, embodying the
literary form given to the traditions by Babylonian writers. 2
Such a circumstance, while not implying direct borrowing, would account for the close parallels existing between the two Hebrew and the two Babylonian versions, and would also furnish a motive to the Hebrew writers for embodying two
versions in their narrative.

CHAPTER XXII.
THE ZODIACAL SYSTEM OF THE BABYLONIANS.
PLANETS, STARS, AND CALENDAR.
IT will be appropriate at this point, to give a brief account of
the astronomical system as developed by the Babylonian scholars. The system forms a part of the Babylonian cosmology. The ' creation ' narratives we have been considering are based
upon the system, and the omen literature is full of allusions to
it. Moreover, the understanding of some of the purely religious doctrines of the Babylonians is dependent upon a proper conception of the curious astrological speculations which from Babylonia made their way to the Greeks, and have left their
traces in the astronomy of the present time.
The stars were regarded by the Babylonians as pictorial
designs on the heavens. A conception of this kind is the out
come of popular fancy, and has its parallel among other nations
of antiquity. We pass beyond the popular stage, however, when we find the stars described as the '
writing of heaven.' x Such
a term is the product of the schools, and finds a ready explanation if we remember that the cuneiform script, like other scripts,
was in its first stages pictorial. The Babylonian scholars not only knew this, but so well did they know it that writing con
tinued to be regarded by them as picture drawing. The characters used by them were ' likenesses ' 2 long after they had
passed beyond the stage when they bore any resemblance to
the pictures they originally represented. The expression 'writ

2 The Greek name for the letters of the alphabet symbolon, i.e., a " likeness" illustrates the same view of the pictorial origin of writing.



ZODIACAL SYSTEM OF THE BABYLONIANS. 455
ing of heaven' was, therefore, equivalent to 'picture of heaven.' The heavens themselves being regarded as a fixed vault, it followed that the movements observed there were caused by the
stars changing their position ; and the regular characters of these movements within certain periods led to speaking of the
movements of the heavenly bodies as their * courses.' It was
furthermore apparent, even to a superficial observer, that some of the stars seemed fixed to their places, while others moved
about. A distinction was thus drawn between wandering stars
or planets and fixed stars. Groups of stars, the single members
of which appeared in a constant relationship to one another, were distinguished partly by natural observation and partly as a convenient means of obtaining a general view of the starry
canopy. It was such a group that more particularly justified
the view which regarded the stars as pictorial designs. A line drawn so as to connect the stars of the group turned out to be
a design of some sort. On omen tablets, geometrical figures are often found * and interpreted as omens, and it is plausible to
suppose that the outlines presented by the stars of a group first
suggested the idea of attaching significance to combinations of lines and curves. To connect these outlines with the pictures
that formed the starting-point for the development of the script was again a perfectly natural procedure, although a scholastic one. The investigations of Delitzsch have shown that the more than four hundred cuneiform characters in use can be
reduced to a comparatively small number of ' outlines ' of pic
tures to about forty-five. The subjects of these * outlines '
are all familiar ones, sun, moon, stars, mountain, man, the parts of the human body, animals, plants, and utensils. 2 Association of ideas led to giving to the outlines presented by the
groups of stars, a similar interpretation. The factor of imagina

456 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
tion, of course, entered into play, but it is also likely that the
comparison of these heavenly figures with the pictures of the script was the controlling factor that led to identifying a certain
group of stars with a bull, another with a scorpion, a third with
a ram, a fourth with a fish, still another with a pig, and more the like. That animals were chosen was due to the influence
of animistic theories, and the rather fantastic shape of the
animals distinguished led to further speculations. So, eleven constellations, that is to say, the entire zodiac with the excep
tion of the bull the sign of Marduk were identified with
the eleven monsters forming the host of Tiamat. The passage in the Marduk-Tiamat myth l which speaks of the capture
of these monsters through Marduk appears to have suggested
this identification, which, fanciful though it is, has a scholastic
rather than a popular aspect. Jensen (to whom, together with Epping and Strassmaier, 2 most of our knowledge of this subject is due) has shown 3 that of the twelve constellations in
our modern zodiac, the greater number are identical with those
distinguished by the Babylonians; and while it is probable that two or three of our constellations are of occidental origin,
the zodiacal system as a whole is the product of the Babylo
nian schools of astronomy. From Babylonia the system made its way to the west and through western, more particularly through Greek, influence back again to India and the dis
tant east. The number of constellations distinguished by the
Babylonian astronomers has not yet been definitely ascertained.
They certainly recognized more than twelve. Further investi
gations may show that they knew of most of the forty-eight constellations enumerated by Ptolemy.
The general regularity of the courses taken by the sun, moon,
and planets made it a comparatively simple matter to map out
1 See p. 438. 2 Epping and Strassmaier, Astronomisches aits Babylon (Freiburg, 1889). 3 Kosmologie, pp. 57-95. See especially the summary, pp. 82-84.



ZODIACAL SYSTEM OF THE BABYLONIANS. 457
the limits within which these bodies moved. These limits im
pressed the Babylonians, as we have seen, with the thought of the eternal and unchangeable laws under which the planets
stood. The laws regulating terrestrial phenomena, did not
appear to be so rigid. There were symptoms of caprice, so that the order of the earth has the appearance of being an after
thought, suggested by the absolute order prevailing in the heavens. Comets, meteors, and eclipses alone seemed to interrupt this absolute order. As science advanced, it was
found that even eclipses fell within the province of law. The course of astronomical science was thus clearly marked out the determination of these laws.
The path taken by the sun served as a guide and as a means
of comparison. Anu being both the chief god of heaven and
the personification of heaven, 1 the sun's ecliptic became known as the 'way of Anu.' The division of this ecliptic into certain
sections, determined by the constellations within the belt of the ecliptic, was the next step. The course of the moon and planets was determined with reference to the sun's ecliptic, and grad
ually a zodiacal system was evolved, the perfection of which is best exemplified by the fact that so much of the astronomical language of the present time is the same as that used by the ancient astronomers of the Euphrates Valley.
The sun and moon being regarded as deities, under the influence of primitive animistic ideas, 2 the stars would also come
to be looked upon as divine. The ideograph designating a ' star ' and which is prefixed as a determinative to the names of
stars, consists of the sign for god repeated three times; 8 and in the case of those stars which are identified with particular
deities, the simple determinative for god is employed. To
regard the stars in general as gods is a consequence of ani

458 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
mistic notions; but the further steps in the process which led
to connecting the planets and certain other stars with particular
deities who originally had nothing to do with the stars, fall within the province of scholastic theory.
As the jurisdiction of gods originally worshipped in a limited district increased, a difficulty naturally arose among the more advanced minds as to the exact place where the deity dwelt. This difficulty would be accentuated in the case of a god like
Marduk becoming the chief god of the whole Babylonian
Empire. His ardent worshippers would certainly not content themselves with the notion that a single edifice, even though it
be his great temple at Babylon, could contain him. Again, the
development of a pantheon, systematized, and in which the various gods worshipped in Babylonia came to occupy fixed relationships to one another, would lead to the view of putting all the gods in one place. The sun and moon being in the
heavens, the most natural place to assign to the gods as a
dwelling-place was in the region where Shamash and Sin (as every one could see for himself) had their seats. The doctrine
thus arose that the great gods dwell in the ' heaven of Anu.' A
doctrine of this kind would be intelligible to the general populace, but it is doubtful whether a belief which involved the establishment of a direct connection between the most promi
nent stars the planets with the chief gods ever enjoyed
popular favor in Babylonia. The association is marked by an
artificiality and a certain arbitrariness that stamps it not only
as the product of theological schools, but as a thought that would remain confined to a limited circle of the population.
Jensen suggests 1 that the planets may at one time have been
merely regarded as standing under the influence of the great gods, and that a planet from being regarded as the star con
trolled by Marduk, became identified with Marduk. It seems more plausible that the association should have been direct.
1 Kosmologie, p. 134.



ZODIACAL SYSTEM OF THE BABYLONIANS. 459
Even though the Babylonians may not have had any knowledge of the relative mass of the planets, in some way Jupiter must
have appeared to them as the largest of the planets, and for this reason was identified with the head of the Babylonian
pantheon, Marduk. In the creation epic, as we have seen,
Jupiter-Marduk, under the name of Nibir, is represented as exercising a control over all the stars. Mythological associa
tions appear to have played a part in identifying the planet
Venus with the goddess Ishtar. A widely spread nature myth, 1
symbolizing the change of seasons, represents Ishtar, the personification of fertility, the great mother of all that manifests
life, as proceeding to the region of darkness and remaining there for some time. The disappearance of the planet Venus
at certain seasons, as morning star to reappear as evening star, suggested the identification of this planet with Ishtar. From
these two examples we may conclude that the process which resulted in the identification of Saturn with Ninib, Mars with
Nergal, Mercury with Nabu rested similarly on an association
of ideas, derived from certain conceptions held of the gods involved. In regard to Ninib and Nergal it is of some impor
tance to bear in mind that, like Marduk, they are at their origin
solar deities, Ninib representing in the perfected theological system the morning sun, Marduk the sun of the early spring, and Nergal the mid-day sun and summer solstice.2 The posi
tion of the planets Saturn and Mars, accordingly, with reference to the sun at certain periods of the year, may well have been a factor in the association of ideas involved.
The position of the sun, as the general overseer of the
planets, led to the application of an interesting metaphor to express the relationship between the sun and the planets. Just as the human chiefs or kings were called 'shepherds,' a
1 See the following chapter on " The Gilgamesh Epic," and chapter xxv, " The Views of the Babylonians and Assyrians of the Life after Death." 2 Jensen, ib. p. 140. See above, p. 67.



460 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
metaphor suggested, no doubt, by agricultural life, so the planets were commonly known as *
sheep J1 or, as Jensen suggests, 2 'wandering sheep,' and it is rather curious that MarsNergal should have been designated as the *
sheep ' 3 par excellence. The * service ' in which the planets stood to the sun
is exemplified by another term applied to them, which designates them as the mediators carrying out the orders of their superior.
Lastly, it may be noted that each planet receives a variety of names and epithets in the astronomical texts, a circumstance
that points to the composite character of the developed planetary system of the Babylonians. Some of these names are of so distinctive a character as to justify the conclusion that
they arose in the different centers where' astronomical schools
existed.
The process involved in the development of the system is thus complicated by factors introducing views originally confined to certain districts, and it becomes doubtful whether we will ever be able to trace all the steps involved in the process.
Corresponding to the unique position occupied by the supe
rior triad Anu, Bel, and Ea in the theological system, a special place was assigned to them in the astronomical system. Anu
is the pole star of the ecliptic, Bel the pole star of the equator, while Ea in the southern heavens was identified, according to
Jensen,4 with a star in the constellation Argo. Anu, Bel, and
Ea represented the three most prominent fixed stars, but by the side of these a large number of other stars were distinguished
and many of them identified with some deity. For some of these stars the modern equivalents have been ascertained through recent researches; 5 others still remain to be determined.
The astronomical science of the Babylonians thus resolves
itself into these natural divisions :

(1) the constellations, especially those of the zodiac,
(2) the five great planets, (3) the fixed stars, Anu, Bel, and Ea, (4) miscellaneous stars, and (5) the sun and moon.
The rivalry between the two great luminaries ends in a superior rank being accorded to the sun. Natural and indeed
inevitable as this conclusion was, the scientific theory in the
Euphrates Valley was presumably influenced to some extent by the circumstance that the head of the pantheon was a solar
deity. We have seen that the tradition of this original character of Marduk survived in the popular mind.
Of the sun but little need be said here. As represented in
the creation story, he was freer in his movements than any of the planets. He passed across the heavens daily as an over
seer to see that everything was maintained in good order. As
in Greek mythology, the sun was represented as riding in a chariot drawn by horses. 1 Scientific speculation advanced but
little upon these popular fancies. The course that the sun
took on the ecliptic was determined, and the ecliptic itself served as the guide for determining the position and movements of the stars. Under the growing influence of the Mar
duk cult and of such deities as Ninib, Nergal, and Nabu, associated with Marduk mythologically or politically, the old moon worship lost much of its prestige; but in astronomical
science, the former independent rank of the moon is still in large measure preserved. In the enumeration of the planets the moon is mentioned first. 2 The moon is not a '
sheep ' belonging to the flock of Shamash. The importance of the moon in the regulation of the calendar saved her from this
fate. The beginning of the calendrical system, indeed, may

462 BAB YL ONIAN-ASS YRIAN RELIGION.
well have been of popular origin. Ihering 1 is of the opinion that agricultural occupations made the marking off of time a popular necessity, and this view is borne out by the early epithets of the months among the Babylonians, 2 which, as among the Hebrews, are connected with agriculture and the life of
the agriculturist. The later names also bear traces of the
same train of thoughts. Leaving aside details into which it is needless to enter here, the part of the calendar which touches
upon the religion of the Babylonians is the sacred character given to the months by making each one devoted to some god or gods. In this association there may be observed the same
curious mixture of several factors that controlled the identifica
tion of the planets with the gods. The theory underlying the pantheon and certain mythological conceptions are two of the factors that can be clearly seen at work. The triad Anu, Bel, and Ea are accorded the first rank.3
The first month, Nisan, is sacred to Anu and Bel.
The second, lyar, is sacred to Ea as the " lord of humanity." Then follows Sin to whom, as the first-born of Bel, 4 the third
month, Siwan, is devoted. The four succeeding months are parceled out among deities
closely connected with one another, Ninib, Nin-gishzida, Ishtar, and Shamash. Of these, Ninib and Nin-gishzida are solar
deities. Ninib, as the morning sun, symbolizes the approach of the summer season, while Nin-gishzida, another solar deity,
5
represents an advance in this season. To them, therefore, the
fourth and fifth months, Tammuz (or Du'zu) and Ab respectively, are sacred. Ishtar is the goddess of fertility, and the sixth month, which represents the culmination of the summer season, is
accordingly devoted to her. As the last of the group comes

ZODIACAL SYSTEM OF THE BABYLONIANS. 463
Sham ash himself, to whom the seventh month, Tishri (or Tash
ritum), is sacred. Marduk and Nergal come next, the eighth
month, Marcheshwan, 1 being sacred to the former, the ninth Kislev to the great warrior Nergal. The factors here involved are not clear, nor do we know why the tenth month is sacred to
Papsukal perhaps here used as an epithet of Nabu -to Anu, and to Ishtar. The eleventh month, the height of the rainy season and known as the "month of the course of rainstorms,"
is appropriately made sacred to Ramman, ' the god of storms.'
The last month, Adar, falling within the rainy season is presided over by the seven evil spirits. Lastly, an interesting trace of Assyrian influence is to be seen in devoting to Ashur, "the
father of the gods," the intercalated month, the second Adar. This introduction of Ashur points to the late addition of this
intercalated month, and makes it probable also that the inter
calation is the work of astronomers standing under Assyrian
authority. A second intercalated month is Elul the second.
This month is sacred to Anu and Bel, just like Nisan, the first
month. The list, therefore, begins anew with the intercalated month. Such a procedure is natural, and one is inclined to
conclude that the intercalated Elul is of Babylonian origin arid
older than the intercalated Adar. It does not appear that the female consorts of the gods shared in the honors thus bestowed upon the male deities. Variations
from the list as given also occur. So Ashurbanabal calls the
seventh month, Elul, the month of 'the king of gods Ashur,' 2 while Sargon 8 assigns the fourth month to the ' servant of Gibil,'
the fire-god, by which Nin-gishzida is meant, and the third
month he calls the month of " the god of brick structures." 4
In fact, the assigning of the months to the gods appears to partake more or less of an arbitrary character. Absolute uni
formity probably did not prevail throughout Babylonia until a

comparatively late period. Nor does it appear that any popular significance was attached to the sacred character thus given to the months. It was the work of the schools, as are most of the features involved in the elaboration of the calendar. In somewhat closer touch with popular notions and popular observances were the names of the months. Confining ourselves
to the later names, the forms in which they were transmitted
during the period of the Babylonian exile to the Jews, 1 we find that the first month which, as we shall see, was marked by sacred observances in the temples of . Marduk and Nabu at
Babylon and Borsippa was designated ideographically as * the month of the sanctuary,' the third as the period of 'brick-making,' the fifth as the *
fiery
' month, the sixth as the month of the ' mission of Ishtar' a reference to the goddess' descent into
the region of darkness. Designations like '
taking (i.e., scattering) seed ' for the fourth month, '
copious fertility
' for the
ninth month, 'grain-cutting' period for the twelfth, and 'opening of dams' 2 for the eighth contain distinct references to agricul
ture. The name * destructive rain ' for the eleventh month is
suggested by climatic conditions. Still obscure is the designa
tion of the seventh month as the month of the 'resplendent
mound,' 3 and so also is the designation of the second month. 4 The calendar is thus shown to be the product of the same
general order of religious ideas that we have detected in the
zodiacal and planetary systems. Its growth must have been

It is to be noted that this month Tishri is the festival month among the Hebrews and originally also among the Arabs. The ' mound' is a reference to the temples which were erected on natural or artificial eminences. 4 The latter is described by a series of ideographs, " herd" and " to prosper." Is there perhaps a reference to cows giving birth to calves in this month, the early
spring ? For another, but improbable, explanation, see Babylonian and Oriental Record, iv. 37.



ZODIACAL SYSTEM OF THE BABYLONIANS. 465
gradual, for its composite character is one of its most striking
features. The task was no easy one to bring the lunar year
into proper conjunction with the solar year, and there are
grounds for believing that prior to the division of the year into
twelve parts, there was a year of ten months corresponding to
a simpler, perhaps a decimal, system, which appears to have preceded the elaborate sexagesimal system. 1 However this may be, the point of importance for our purposes is to detect the extension of religious ideas into the
domain of science, and, on the other hand, to note the reaction
of scientific theories on the development of religious thought. The cosmology of the Babylonians results from the continued
play of these two factors. Hence the strange mixture of popu
lar notions and fancies with comparatively advanced theological
speculations and still more advanced scientific theories that is
found in the cosmological system. Even mysticism is given a scientific aspect in Babylonia. The identification of the gods
with the stars arises, as we have seen, from a scientific impulse, and it is a scientific spirit again that leads to the introduction
of the gods into the mathematics of the day.2 A number is
assigned to each of the chief gods. And, though such a procedure has its natural outcome in Cabbalistic tendencies, we
can still discern in the ideas that lead to this association of numbers with gods, influences at work that emanated from the
astronomical schools. Thus the moon-god Sin is identified
with the number thirty, suggested by the days of the ordinary month. Ishtar, the daughter of Sin, is number fifteen, the half
of thirty. The unit in the sexagesimal the number sixty is assigned' to Anu, the chief of the triad, while the other two
members, Bel and Ea, follow as fifty and forty respectively. The dependence of this species of identification upon the ca

lendrical system is made manifest by the inferior rank given
to the sun, which receives the number twenty, the decimal next to that assigned to Sin, while Ramman, the third
member of the second triad, 1 is identified with ten. 2
Absolute consistency in this process is, of course, as little
to be expected as in other semi-mystical aspects of the science of the Babylonians; nor is it necessary for our purposes to enter upon the further consequences resulting from this combination of gods with numbers. The association of ideas involved in the combination furnishes another and rather
striking illustration of the close contact between science and
religion in the remarkable culture of the Euphrates Valley. There was no conflict between science and religion in ancient Babylonia. Each reacted on the other, but the two factors
were at all times closely united in perfect harmony, a
harmony so perfect, indeed, as to be impressive despite its naiveti.

CHAPTER XXIII.
THE GILGAMESH EPIC.
WE have seen l that the religion of Babylonia permeates all branches of literature, so that it is not always possible to draw a sharp dividing line between sacred and secular productions. To account for this, it is but necessary to bear in mind what
the previous chapters have aimed to make clear, that religion furnished the stimulus for the unfolding of intellectual life, and
that the literary and scientific productions represent the work
of men primarily interested in religion. The significance attached as omens to heavenly phenomena led by degrees to the elaborate astronomical system outlined in the previous chapter. But the astronomers of Babylonia were priests, and indeed thesame priests who compiled the hymns and incanta
tions. What is true of astronomy applies to medicine, so far as medicine had an existence independent of incantations, and
also to law. The physician was a priest, as was the judge and
likewise the scribe.
It is natural, therefore, to find that what may be called the
great national epic of the Babylonians was of a religious character. The interpretation given to the traditions of the past was religious. The distant past blended with the phenomena of nature in such a way as to form a strange combination of poetry and realism. But thanks to this combination, which is essen
tially a process of the popular mind, the production that we are about to consider brings us much closer to the popular phases
of the Babylonian religion than does the cosmology or the zodiacal system. After all, a nation is much more interested in its heroes and

468 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
in its own beginnings, than in the beginnings of things in general. Some speculation regarding the origin of the universe is perhaps inevitable the moment that the spirit of inquiry arises, but these speculations are soon entrusted into the hands of a
minority, the thinkers, the priests, the astronomers, who
elaborate a system that gradually separates itself from popular thought and exercises little influence upon the development of religious ideas among the masses.
The Book of Genesis passes rapidly over the creation of stars,
plants, and animals, as though anxious to reach the history of man, and when it comes to the traditions regarding the ancestors
of the Hebrews, the details are dwelt upon at length and pic
tured with a loving hand. Similarly among the Babylonians, there is a freshness about the story of the adventures of a great
hero of the past that presents a contrast to the rather abstruse
speculations embodied in the creation epic. In this story, in
which a variety of ancient traditions have been combined, there
is comparatively little trace of the scholastic spirit, and although,
as we shall see, the story has been given its final shape under the same influences that determined the other branches of reli
gious literature, the form has not obscured the popular character of the material out of which the story has been constructed. The name of the hero of the story was for a long time a
puzzle to scholars. Written invariably in ideographic fashion, the provisional reading Izdubar 1 was the only safe recourse until
a few years ago, when Pinches discovered in a lexicographical tablet the equation
Izdubar = Gilgamesh. 2
The equation proved that the Babylonians and Assyrians identified the hero with a legendary king, Gilgamos, who is
1 Or Gishdubar or Gishtubar. 2 Babylonian and Oriental Record, iv. 264. For previous readings of the name, see Jeremias' article on ' Izdubar ' in Roscher's Ausfuhrliches Lexicon der Griechischen und Romischen Mythologie, ii. col. 773, 774.



T1JE G1LGAMESH EPIC. 469
mentioned by Aelian. 1 To be sure, what Aelian tells of this
hero is not found in the Izdubar epic, and appears to have
originally been recounted of another legendary personage, Etana. 2 There is therefore a reasonable doubt whether the
identification made by Babylonian scholars represents an old
tradition or is merely a late conjecture arising at a time when the traditions of Izdubar were confused with those of' Etana.
Still, since Etana appears to be a phonetic reading and can be
explained etymologically in a satisfactory manner, the presumption is in favor of connecting Gilgamesh with the hero of the great epic. For the present, therefore, we may accept the identification and assume that in Aelian, as well as in the
sources whence he drew his information, Izdubar-Gilgamesh has been confused with Etana.3
The ideographic form of the name is preceded invariably by the determinative for deity, but the three elements compos
ing the name, iz, du, and bar, are exceedingly obscure. The
first element is a very common determinative, preceding objects made of wood or any hard substance. The word for weapon is always written with this determinative ; and since Izdubar is
essentially a warrior, one should expect dubar to represent some kind of a weapon that he carries. On seal cylinders Gilgamesh appears armed with a large lance.4 However this may be,
Jeremias' proposition to render the name as " divine judge of
earthly affairs" 5 is untenable, and the same may be said of
other conjectures.
1 Historia Animalum, xii. 21. 2 See p. 524. 3 In the Oriental legends of Alexander the Great, this confusion is further illus'trated. To Alexander are attached stories belonging to both Izdubar and Etana. See Meissner's Alexander and Gilgamos, pp. 13-17 (Leipzig, 1894). 4 See, e.g., Perrot and Chipiez, History of Art in Babylonia and Assyria, i. 84. 5 Article ' Izdubar,' col. 776 ; see Delitzsch, Handivorterbuch, p. 678. Hommel (e.g., Altisraelitischc Uebcrlicfcriing, p. 39) regards Gilgamesh as a contraction
from Gibil (the fire-god) and Gam (or Gab), together with isA, an ' Elamitic ' ending. If the name is Elamitic, one should hardly expect a Babylonian deity entering as one of the elements.



470 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
The fact that the name is written with the determinative for
deity must not lead us to a purely mythical interpretation of the epic. There was a strong tendency in Babylonia to regard the early kings as gods. Dungi and Gudea, who are far from being the earliest rulers in the Euphrates Valley, appear in tablets with the determinative for. deity attached to their names, 1 and
it would be natural, therefore, that a hero belonging to a remote period should likewise be deified. There can be no doubt that
there is a historical background to the Gilgamesh epic, and there is equally no reason to question the existence of an ancient king or hero who bore the name Gilgamesh. The
deification of the hero superinduced the introduction of mythi
cal elements. It was an easy process also, that led to tales
which arose as popular symbols of occurrences in nature, being likewise brought into connection with a hero, who was at the same time a god.
The Gilgamesh epic thus takes shape as a compound of faint historical tradition and of nature myths. The deified hero
becomes more particularly a solar deity. The popularity of the hero-god is attested by the introduction of his name in
incantations, 2 and by special hymns being composed in his honor. One of these hymns, 3 of a penitential character, is interesting as illustrating the survival of the recollection of
his human origin. Gilgamesh is addressed by a penitent, who seeks healing from disease :
O Gilgamesh, great king, judge of the Anunnaki, Prince, great oracle 4 of mankind, Overseer of all regions, ruler of the world, lord of what is on earth,
Thou dost judge and, like a god, thou givest decisions,5
1 See above, p. 167. 2 See above, p. 284. 3 Haupt's Das Babylonischc Nimrodepos, p. 93. 4 Lit.,
' he who is applied to for giving a decision.'
5 Ta-far-ra-as,

THE GILGAMESH EPIC. 471
Thou art established on the earth, thou fulfillest judgment,
Thy judgment is unchangeable, thy [command is not revoked],
Thou dost inquire, thou commandest, thou judgest, thou seest, and thou directest. Shamash has entrusted into thy hand sceptre and decision.
It will be observed that Gilgamesh is appealed to as a 'king'
and 'prince.' His dominion is the earth, and the emphasis placed upon this circumstance is significant. In accord with
this peculiar province of the god, the hymn continues:
Kings, chiefs, and princes bow before thee, Thou seest their laws, thou presidest over their decisions.
At the same time, his dependence upon Shamash is emphasized. As a minor solar deity, he receives his powers from the
great judge Shamash. This double character of Gilgamesh
furnishes the key to the interpretation of the epic in which he is the central figure.
The poem in its final shape comprised twelve tablets of
about three thousand lines. Unfortunately only about half of the epic has been found up to the present time. The numer
ous fragments represent at least four distinct copies, all belonging to the library of Ashurbanabal. To Professor Paul Haupt
we are indebted for a practically complete publication of the fragments of the epic 5
1 and it is likewise owing, chiefly, to Professor Haupt that the sequence in the incidents of the epic as well as
the general interpretation of the composition has been established. 2
1 Das Balylonische Nimrodepos (Leipzig, 1884-91). This edition includes all but the twelfth tablet, which was published by Haupt in the Beitrdge zur Assyriologie, i. 48-79. For other publications of Haupt on the Gilgamesh epic, see the Bibliography, 6. The identification with the Biblical Nimrod is now definitely abandoned by scholars, though the picture drawn of Nimrod is influenced by the traditions regarding Gilgamesh. See p. 515. 2 The best general work on the epic (based on Haupt's edition) is A. Jeremias' Izdnb ar-Nimrod (Leipzig, 1891), a reprint with additions, of his article on ' Izdubar ' in Roscher's Ausfuhrliches Lexicon der Griechischen und Romischcn Mythologie, ii.



472 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION,
The center of action in the first tablets of the series and in
the oldest portions of the epic is the ancient city Uruk, or Erech,
in southern Babylonia, invariably spoken of as Uruk supfiri,
that is, the ' walled ' or fortified Uruk. A special significance
attaches to this epithet. It was the characteristic of every
ancient town, for reasons which Ihering has brilliantly set forth, 1 to be walled. 2 The designation of Uruk as '
walled,' therefore, stamps it as a city, but that the term was added, also points
to the great antiquity of the place, to a period when towns
as distinguished from mere agricultural villages were sufficiently rare to warrant some special nomenclature. From other
sources the great age of Uruk is confirmed, and Hilprecht 3
is of the opinion that it was the capitol of a kingdom contempo
raneous with the earliest period of Babylonian history. A lexicographical tablet 4 informs us that Uruk was specially well
fortified. It was known as the place of seven walls and, in
view of the cosmic significance of the number seven among the
Babylonians, Jensen supposes 5 that the city's walls are an imitation of the seven concentric zones into which the world was
divided. However this may be, a city so ancient and so well
fortified must have played a most important part in old Baby
lonian history, second only in importance, if not equal, to Nippur. The continued influence of the Ishtar or Nana cult of
Erech also illustrates the significance of the place. It is
natural, therefore, to find traditions surviving of the history of
the place. The first tablet of the Gilgamesh epic contains such a
reminiscence. The city is hard pressed by an enemy. The misfortune appears to be sent as a punishment for some

offence. 1 Everything is in a state of confusion. Asses and
cows destroy their young. Men weep and women sigh. The
gods and spirits of " walled Uruk " have become hostile forces.
For three years the enemy lays siege to the place. The gates
of the city remain closed. Who the enemy is we are not told,
and such is the fragmentary condition of the tablet that we are
left to conjecture the outcome of the city's distress. In the second tablet, Gilgamesh is introduced as a hero of
superior strength and in control of Uruk. Is he the savior of
the city or its conqueror? One is inclined to assume the latter, for the inhabitants of Uruk are represented as complaining that
Gilgamesh has taken away the sons and daughters of the place. From a passage in a subsequent tablet it appears that Uruk is not the native place of the hero, but Marada. 2 Moreover, the
name Gilgamesl) is not Babylonian, so that the present evidence speaks in favor of regarding the first episode in the epic as a reminiscence of the extension of Gilgamesh's dominion by the conquest of Uruk. When this event took place we have no
means of determining with even a remote degree of probability. The representation of Gilgamesh on very ancient seal cylinders 3 warrants us in passing beyond the third millennium, but more than this can hardly be said.
Gilgamesh is a hero of irresistible power. The inhabitants
of Uruk appeal for help to Aruru, who has created Gilgamesh :
He has no rival. . . . Thy inhabitants [appeal for aid ?]. Gilgamesh does not leave a son to his father.
Day and night, . . .
1 Jeremias' Izdiibar-Nimrod, p. 1 5, conjectures that the death of the king has evoked distress, but that is highly improbable. That the fragment under consideration belongs to the beginning of the epic is tolerably certain, though not absolutely so. 2 Sixth tablet, 1. 192. He brings offerings to Lugal-Marada, i.e., the king of Marada a solar deity. See p. 486. 3 Heuzey, Sceattx incdits des Rots d'Agade (Revue d'Assyriologie, iv. 3, p. 9).

He, the ruler of walled Uruk, . . .
He, their ruler, . . . The strong, the preeminent, the cunning, . . . Gilgamesh does not leave the virgin to [her mother], The daughter to her warrior, the wife to her husband.
The gods [of heaven] hear their cry.
They cry aloud to Aruru, " Thou hast created him,
Now create a rival (?) to him, equal to taking up the fight against him (?)."
So much at least is clear from the badly mutilated lines that
Gilgamesh has played sad havoc with the inhabitants of Uruk.
In personal combat, as it would appear, he has triumphed over the warriors of the place. The son is taken away from his
father, the virgins are taken captive, warriors and husbands are snatched from those dear to them. Aruru is here appealed to as the creator of mankind. 1 She who has created the hero is
asked to produce some one who can successfully resist Gilgamesh. Aruru proceeds to do so.
Aruru, upon hearing this, forms a man of Anu.2 Aruru washes her hands, takes a bit of clay, and throws it on the ground. She creates Eabani, a hero, a lofty offspring, the possession of Ninib. 3
This creature Eabani is described as having a body covered
with hair. He has long flowing locks and lives with the animals about him.
Eating herbs with gazelles, Drinking from a trough with cattle, Sporting with the creatures of the waters.
The description evidently recalls man living in a savage state, and, to judge from illustrations of Eabani on seal cylinders,

lofty,'
' divine.' The phrase is equivalent to the Biblical ' image of God.'
3 A phrase in some way again indicative of Eabani's likeness to a deity.



THE GILGAMESH EPIC. 475
the mythological fancy of the period when strange monsters existed of hybrid formation, half-man, half-beast, has influenced the conception of this strange creature who is to combat the
invincible Gilgamesh. But Gilgamesh frustrates the plan. He
sends a messenger known as Sadu, that is,
' the hunter,' and
described as a " wicked man," to ensnare Eabani. 1 For three
days in succession, the hunter sees Eabani drinking at the trough with the cattle, but is unable to catch him. The sight of this * wild man of the woods '
frightens the hunter. He returns to Gilgamesh for further instructions.
Gilgamesh spoke to the hunter:
Go, hunter mine, and take with thee Ukhat. When the cattle comes to the trough, Let her tear off her dress and disclose her nakedness. He 2 will see her and approach her. His cattle, which grew up on his field, will forsake him.
Ukhatu is a name for a harlot devoted to the worship of Ishtar. Other names for such devotees are Kharimtu* and Kizritu* Elsewhere the city Uruk is called " the dwelling of Anu and
Ishtar, the city of the Kizreti, Ukhati, and Kharim&ti"* and in
a subsequent tablet of the Gilgamesh epic 6 these three classes
of harlots are introduced as the attendants of Ishtar, obedient
to her call. The conclusion is therefore justified that Uruk was one of the centers perhaps the center of the obscene rites
to which Herodotus 7 has several references. Several other
incidental allusions in cuneiform literature to the sacred prosti

tution carried on at Babylonian temples confirm Herodotus'
statement in general, 1 although the rite never assumed the large
proportions that he reports. On the other hand, Herodotus does not appear to have under
stood the religious significance of the custom that he designates as ' shameful.' The name given to the harlot among Baby
lonians and Hebrews,2 Kadishtu or K'desha, that is, 'the sacred
one,' is sufficient evidence that, at its origin, the rite was not
the product of obscene tendencies, but due to nai've conceptions connected with the worship of Ishtar as the goddess
of fertility. The introduction of Ukhat, however, as an aid to carry out
the designs of Gilgamesh.is devoid of religious significance, and one is inclined to regard the Eabani episode, or at least certain
portions of it, as having had at one time an existence quite
independent of Gilgamesh's adventures. The description of Eabani is, as we have seen, based upon mythological ideas.
The creation of Eabani recalls the Biblical tradition of the for
mation of the first man, and Ukhat appears to be the Baby
lonian equivalent to the Biblical Eve, who through her charms entices Eabani away from the gazelles and cattle,3 and brings
him to Uruk, the symbol of civilized existence.
It is significant that in the Biblical narrative, the sexual
instinct and the beginnings of culture as symbolized by the tree
1 See Jeremias' Izdubar-Nimrod, pp. 59, 60 ; Nikel, Herodot und die Keilschriftforschung, pp. 84-86. 2 The protest of the Pentateuch (Deut. xxiii. 18) against the K'deshcl, as also against the 'male devotee' (Kadesli), shows the continued popularity of the rites. 3 It is to be noted that in the Yahwistic narrative, Adam is in close communication with the animals about him (Gen. ii. 20). It is tempting also to connect the
Hebrew form of Eve, Khawwa (or Khawwaf) in some way with Ukhat, not etymologically of course, but as suggestive of a dependence of one upon the other, the Hebrew upon the Babylonian term. Professor Stade (Zeits.f. Alttest. H'iss., 1897, p. 210) commenting upon Gen. ii. 20, points out that Yahwe's motive for asking Adam to name the animals was the hope that he would find a ' helpmate ' among them. In the light of the Babylonian story of Eabani living with animals, Stade's suggestion receives a striking illustration.



THE GILGAMESH EPIC. 477
of knowledge are closely associated. According to rabbinical
traditions, the serpent is the symbol of the sexual passion. 1 Eve obtains control of Adam with the aid of this passion.
In the episode of Eabani, Ukhat, and the hunter who, be it noted, plays the part of the tempter we seem to have an
ancient legend forming part of some tradition regarding the beginnings of man's history, and which has been brought into connection with the Gilgamesh epic, when and how, it is
impossible, of course, to say. The hunter foltows the instructions of Gilgamesh. Eabani
falls a victim to Ukhat's attractions.
Ukhat exposed her breast, revealed her nakedness, took off her clothing. Unabashed she enticed him.
The details of the meeting are described with a frank sim
plicity that points again to the antiquity of the legend.
For six days and seven nights Eabani enjoyed the love of Ukhat. After he had satiated himself with her charms, He turned his countenance to his cattle.
The reposing gazelles saw Eabani, The cattle of the field turned away from him. Eabani was startled and grew faint, His limbs grew stiff as his cattle ran off.
But Ukhat has gained control of him. He gives up the
thought of gazelles and cattle, and returns to enjoy the love of Ukhat. His senses return,
And he again turns in love, enthralled at the feet of the harlot, Looks up into her face and listens as the woman speaks to him. The woman 2 speaks to Eabani:
" Lofty art thou, Eabani, like to a god. Why dost thou lie with the beasts ? Come, I will bring thee to walled Uruk,

" KharimtH. In Arabic the word is likewise used for ' woman ' in general.



478 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
To the glorious house, 1 the dwelling of Anu and Ishtar, To the seat of Gilgamesh, perfect in power, Surpassing men in strength, like a mountain bull."
It would appear from these lines that previous to the coming of Ukhat, Eabani had satisfied his desire on the beasts. In
Ukhat, however, he found a worthier mate, and he accordingly abandons his former associates to cling to her.
He yields and obeys her command, n the wisdom of his heart he recognized a companion.2
In the continuation of the story Eabani becomes the companion
of Gilgamesh, but I venture to think that the title was trans
ferred in the development of the epic from Ukhat, to whom it originally belonged. It is she who awakens in Eabani a sense of dignity which made him superior to the animals. The word
translated 'companion' 3 may be appropriately applied to Ukhat.
Eabani clings to her, as Adam does to Eve after she ' is brought ' 4 to him. Ukhat becomes Eabani's '
companion,' just as Eve becomes the '
helpmate ' of Adam. These considerations strengthen the supposition that the
Eabani-Ukhat episode is quite distinct from the career of Gilga
mesh. Had the epic originated in Babylon or Nippur, Eabani and Ukhat would have been brought to Babylon or Nippur. As it is, Eabani asks Ukhat to conduct him
1 The temple at Uruk is meant. 2 Jeremias translates ' seeks a friend,' and refers the words to Gilgamesh, but there is nothing in the narrative to justify us in assuming that Eabani was thinking of the hero.
3 It is used as a synonym of tappu, 'associate,' Delitzsch, Handu'orterlnich, p. 10. Ideographically, it is composed of two elements, 'strength' and 'acquire.' ' Companion in arms ' is the fellowship originally meant. 4 The Hebrew verb (Gen. ii. 22) expresses sexual union and precisely the same verb is used in the cuneiform narrative when Eabani comes to Ukhat (Haupt's edi
tion, p. n, 1. 21).



THE 'GILGAMESH EPTC. 479
To the glorious dwelling, the sacred seat of Arm and Ishtar, To the seat of Gilgamesh, perfect in power, Surpassing men in strength like a mountain bull.
Unfortunately, the tablet at this point is defective, 1 and the
following three tablets are represented by small fragments only, from which it is exceedingly difficult to determine more than
the general course of the narrative. Ukhat and Eabani proceed to Uruk. There is an interesting
reference to ' a festival ' and to festive garments, 2 but whether, as would appear, Ukhat and Eabani are the ones who clothe
themselves 3 upon reaching Uruk or whether, as Jeremias believes, a festival was being celebrated at the place it is impossible to say. Eabani is warned in a dream not to under
take a test of strength with Gilgamesh, 4
Whose power is stronger than thine,
Who rests not, . . . neither by day or night.
O Eabani, change thy . . . Shamash loves Gilgamesh, Anu, Bel, and Ea have given him wisdom. Before thou comest from the mountain Gilgamesh in Uruk will ste thy dream.5
Dreams play an important part in the epic. They constitute the regular means of communication between man and the gods,
so regular that at times the compilers of the epic do not find it
necessary to specify the fact, but take it for granted. To Gilgamesh, Eabani' s coming is revealed and he asks his mother Aruru to interpret the dream. The third and fourth tablets take us back to the history of
Uruk. Gilgamesh, aided by his patron Shamash, succeeds in

" I will fight with him," is erroneous. 2 Haupt, 13, 7-8. 3 Cf.

gaining Eabani as a ' companion ' in a contest that is to be
waged against Khumbaba, who threatens Uruk. The name of
this enemy is Elamitic, and it has been customary to refer the
campaign against him to the tradition recorded by Berosus of a native uprising against Elamitic rule, which took place about
2400 B.C. 1 It must be said, however, that there is no satisfactory evidence for this supposition. Elam, lying to the east of the
Euphrates, was at all times a serious menace to Babylonia. Hostilities with Elam are frequent before and after the days of
Hammurabi. If Gilgamesh, as seems certain, is a Cassite, 2 the conflict between him and Khumbaba would represent a rivalry among Cassitic or Elamitic hordes for the possession of Uruk
and of the surrounding district While the Cassites do not come
to the front till the eighteenth century, at which time the center
of their kingdom is Nippur, there is every reason to believe
that they were settled in the Euphrates Valley long before that
period. The course of conquest as of civilization in Baby
lonia being from the south to the north, we would be justified in looking for the Cassites in Uruk before they extended their
dominion to Nippur. At all events, the conflict between Gilgamesh and Khumbaba must be referred to a much more ancient
period than the rise of the city of Babylon as a political center. Shamash and Gilgamesh promise Eabani royal honors if he
will join friendship with them.
Come, and on a great couch, On a fine couch he 8 will place thee. He will give thee a seat to the left. The rulers of the earth will kiss thy feet. All the people of Uruk will crouch before thee.
Eabani consents, and in company with Gilgamesh proceeds to the fortress of Khumbaba. It is a long and hard road that
1 See, e.g., Jeremias' Izdubar-Nimrod, p. 21. 2 So, e.g., Hommel (Altisraelitische Ueberlieferung, p. 35). He is certainly not a native of Babylonia. 3 Gilgamesh.



THE GILGAMESII EPIC. 481
they have to travel. The terror inspired by Khumbaba is com
pared to that aroused by a violent storm, but Gilgamesh receives
assurances, in no less than three dreams, that he will come
forth unharmed out of the ordeal.
The fortress of Khumbaba is situated in a grove of won
derful grandeur, in the midst of which there is a large cedar,
affording shade and diffusing a sweet odor. The description reminds one forcibly of the garden of Eden, and the question suggests itself whether in this episode of the Gilgamesh epic, we have not again a composite production due to the combination of Gilgamesh's adventures with the traditions regarding
Eabani. Unfortunately the description of the contest with Khumbaba is missing. There is a reference to the tyrant's
death, 1 but that is all. In the sixth tablet, Gilgamesh is cele
brated as the victor and not Eabani. We may conclude,
therefore, that the episode belongs originally to Gilgamesh's career, and that Eabani has been introduced into it. On the
other hand, for Eabani to be placed in a beautiful garden
would be a natural consequence of his deserting the gazelles and cattle, the reward, as it were, of his clinging to Ukhat.
Separating the composite elements of the epic in this way, we have as distinct episodes in Gilgamesh's career, the conquest of Uruk and of other places,2 and his successful campaign against Khumbaba. With this story there has been combined
a popular tradition of man's early savage state, his departure from this condition through the sexual passion aroused by Uk
hat, who becomes his 'companion/ and with whom or through whom he is led to a beautiful garden as a habitation.
The sixth tablet introduces a third element into the epic,
a mythological one. The goddess Ishtar pleads for the love of Gilgamesh. She is attracted to him by his achievements and
his personality. The tablet begins with a description of the

celebration of Gilgamesh's victory. The hero exchanges his blood-stained clothes for white garments, polishes his weapons, and places a crown on his head.
To secure the grace of Gilgamesh, the exalted Ishtar raises her eyes. Come, Gilgamesh, be my husband,
Thy love l grant me as a gift, Be thou my husband and I will be thy wife. I will place thee on a chariot of lapis lazuli and gold, With wheels of gold and horns of sapphire (?)
Drawn by great . . . steeds (?). With swreet odor of cedars enter our house.
Upon entering our house, . . . will kiss thy feet.
Kings, lords, and princes will be submissive to thee, Products of mountain and land, they will bring as tribute to thee.
Ishtar appears here as the goddess of love and fertility. As such she promises Gilgamesh also abundance of herds. But
Gilgamesh rejects the offer, giving as his reason the sad fate encountered by these who were victims of Ishtar's love :
Tammuz, the consort of thy youth (?), Thou causest to weep every year. The bright-colored allallu bird thou didst love. Thou didst crush him and break his pinions.
In the woods he stands and laments, " O my pinions !
"
Thou didst love a lion of perfect strength, Seven and seven times 2 thou didst bury him in the corners (?), Thou didst love a horse superior in the fray, With whip and spur 3 thou didst urge him on. Thou didst force him on for seven double hours,4 Thou didst force him on when wearied and thirsty ; His mother Silili thou madest weep.
In this way Gilgamesh proceeds to upbraid the goddess, instancing, in addition, her cruel treatment of a shepherd, and apparently also of a giant, whom she changed to a dwarf. The

THE GILGAMESH EPIC. 483
allusions, while obscure, are all of a mythological character.
The weeping of Tammuz symbolizes the decay of vegetation after the summer season. The misfortunes that afflict the bird, lion,
and horse similarly indicate the loss of beauty and strength, which is the universal fate of those who once enjoyed those
attributes. Ishtar, as the great mother, produces life and
strength, but she is unable to make life and strength permanent. Popular belief makes her responsible for decay and
death, since life and fertility appear to be in her hand. Gilga
mesh, as a popular hero, is brought into association by popular traditions with Ishtar, as he is brought into relationships with
Eabani and Ukhat. A factor in this association was the neces
sity of accounting for Gilgamesh's death. As a hero, the favorite of the gods and invincible in battle, he ought to enjoy the
privilege of the gods immortality. The question had to be answered how he came to forego this distinction. The insult he
offers to Ishtar is the answer to this question. Knowing that
Ishtar, although the giver of life, does not grant a continuance of it, he who is produced by Aruru will have nothing to do with
the great goddess. But his refusal leads to a dire punishment, more disastrous even than the alliance with Ishtar, which would
have culminated in his being eventually shorn of his strength.
Ishtar, determined that Gilgamesh should not escape her, flies in rage to her father Anu, the god of heaven, and tells of the manner in which she has been treated. Anu comforts her.
Yielding to Ishtar's request he creates a divine bull, known as
Aid, t.e.j the strong or supreme one, 1 who is to destroy Gilgamesh. At this point in the narrative Eabani is again intro
duced. Gilgamesh and Eabani together proceed to the contest
with the bull, as they formerly proceeded against Khumbaba.
On seal cylinders this fight is frequently pictured. 2 In agreement with the description in the narrative, Eabani takes hold
1 The same word appears in incantation texts as a term for a class of demons. 2 See, e.g., Jeremias' Izdubar-Niinrod, p. 26.



484 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
of the tail of the animal, while Gilgamesh despatches him by driving a spear into the bull's heart. Ishtar's plan is thus
frustrated.
Ishtar mounts the wall of walled Uruk. In violent rage she pronounces a curse:
" Cursed be Gilgamesh, who has enraged me,
Who has killed the divine bull."
Eabani adds insult to injury by challenging the goddess.
Eabani, upon hearing these words of Ishtar, Takes the carcass (?) of the divine bull and throws it into her face. Woe to thee ! I will subdue thee, I will do to thee as I have done to him.1
The mythological motives that prompted the introduction of
Ishtar into this tablet now become apparent. The division of
the epic into twelve parts is due to scholastic influences. It is
certainly not accidental that the calendar also consists of twelve months. While it is by no means the case that each tablet
corresponds to some month, still in the case of the sixth and, as we shall see, in the case of the seventh and eleventh tablets,
this correspondence is certain. The sixth month is designated
as the month of the " Mission of Ishtar." What this mission is
we shall see in a subsequent chapter. 2 In this month was cele
brated a festival to Tammuz, the young bridegroom of Ishtar, who is slain by the goddess. The prophet Ezekiel gives us a picture of the weeping for Tammuz,3 which formed the chief
ceremony of the day. It is this character of the month that accounts not only for
the introduction of the Ishtar episode in the sixth tablet, but
which finds further illustrations in the mourning which Ishtar
and her attendants indulge in after the death of the divine bull.
Ishtar assembled the Kizreti, Ukhati and Kharimati. Over the carcass of Alu they raised a lamentation.
1 I.e., to the bull. 2 Chapter xxv. 3 EZ. viii. 14.



THE GILGAMKXII A/'/C. 485
These three classes of sacred prostitutes have already been dwelt upon. 1 With more material at our disposal regarding the
cult of Ishtar or Nana of Erech, we would be in a position to
specify .the character of the rites performed at this temple. The statements of Herodotus and of other writers suffice, however,
to show that the three terms represent classes of priestesses
attached to the temple. In this respect the Ishtar cult of Erech
was not unique, for we have references to priestesses elsewhere.
However, the function of the priestess in religious history differs materially from that of the priest. She is not a mediator between
the god and his subjects, nor is she a representative of the
deity. It is as a *
witch,' that by virtue of the association of
ideas above set forth, 2 she is able to determine the intentions
of the gods. Her power to do harm is supplemented by her ability to furnish oracles. In this capacity we have already come across her, 3 and we may assume that giving oracles constituted
a chief function of the priestess in Babylonia. It was furthermore natural to conclude that as a ' witch ' and '
oracle-giver/ the priestess belonged to the deity from whom she derived her power. When we come to the cult of a goddess like Ishtar, who
is the symbol of fertility, observances that illustrated this central
notion would naturally form an ingredient part of that '
sympathetic magic,' the imitation of an action in order to produce
the reality which dominates so large a proportion of early religious ceremonialism. Among many nations the mysterious as
pects of woman's fertility lead to rites that by a perversion of
their original import appear to be obscene. 4 In the reference to
the three classes of sacred prostitutes, we have an evidence that
the Babylonian worship formed no exception to the rule. But
with this proposition that the prostitutes were priestesses attached to the Ishtar cult and who took part in ceremonies intended to
symbolize fertility, we must for the present rest content.

486 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
Gilgamesh, secure in his victory, proceeds to offer the horns of the divine bull to his patron Lugal-Marada, the 'king' of Marad, and who appears to be identical with Shamash him
self. The offering is accompanied by gifts to the sanctuary of
precious stones and oil. There is general rejoicing. The episode of Gilgamesh's contest with the bull also belongs
to the mythological phases of the epic. The bull is in Babylonian mythology * as among other nations a symbol of the storm.
It is in his role as a solar deity that Gilgamesh triumphs over
the storm sent by Anu, that is, from on high. In the following chapter, we will come across another form of this same myth
suggested evidently, as was the fight of Marduk with Tiainat,
by the annual storms raging in Babylonia. Gilgamesh triumphs as does Marduk, but when once the summer solstice, which represents the sun's triumph, is past, the decline of the sun's
strength begins to set in. This is indicated by the subsequent course of the narrative.
The scene of rejoicing at Gilgamesh's triumph is changed to one of sadness. Eabani is snatched away from Gilgamesh.
The few fragments of the seventh and eighth tablets do not
suffice for determining exactly in what way this happened, but
Ishtar is evidently the cause of the misfortune. A fatal ill
ness, it would seem, seizes hold of Eabani, whether as the
result of a further contest or directly sent, it is impossible to say. For twelve days he lingers and then is taken away. As usual, the catastrophe is foreseen in dreams. For a third time 2 he sees a vision of fire and lightning, which forebodes the end.
The fragmentary condition of the epic at this point is particularly unfortunate. There is a reference to Nippur, 3 of which
it would be important to know the purpose.
The relationship between Gilgamesh and Eabani would be
1 See p. 536. 2 Or as a third dream. It will be recalled that in a previous portion of the epic (p. 481), Gilgamesh has three dreams in succession. 3 Haupt, pp. 45, 53.

1 GILGAMESH EPIC, 487
much clearer if the seventh and eighth tablets were preserved in
good condition. The disappearance of Eabani before the end
of the epic confirms, however, the view here maintained, that
the career of Eabani was originally quite independent of Gilgamesh's adventures. His death is as superfluous as is his asso
ciation with Eabani. In all critical moments Gilgamesh appears
to stand alone. He conquers Uruk, and it is he who celebrates
the victory of the divine bull. The subsequent course of the
narrative after Eabani's death, except for the frequent mention
of Gilgamesh's lament for his companion, proceeds undisturbed. Moreover, Eabani's punishment appears to be identical with that meted out to Gilgamesh. The latter is also stricken with
disease, but in his case, the disease has a meaning that fits in
with the mythological phases of the epic. The seventh month
the one following the summer solstice marks the beginning
of a turning-point in the year. As the year advances, vegetation diminishes, and the conclusion was naturally drawn that the sun
upon whom vegetation depended had lost some of his force. This loss of strength is pictured as a disease with which the sun
is afflicted. In this way, the seventh tablet and possibly also the eighth continues the nature myth embodied in the sixth.
Haupt has ingeniously conjectured that the sickness which affects Gilgamesh is of a venereal character. The hero wan
ders about in search of healing. His suffering is increased by his deep sorrow over the loss of his 'companion.' The death
of Eabani presages his own destruction, and he dreads the
dreary fate in store for him. The ninth tablet introduces us
to this situation.
Gilgamesh weeps for his companion Eabani. In distress he is stretched out on the ground. 1 1 1 will not die like Eabani. Sorrow has entered my body. Through fear of death, I lie stretched out on the ground.'

He determines to seek out a mysterious personage, whom he calls Parnapishtim, 1 the son of Kidin-Marduk. a This personage
has in some way escaped the fate of mankind and enjoys
immortal life. He is called the " distant one." His dwelling
is far off,
" at the confluence of the streams." The road to the
place is full of dangers, but Gilgamesh, undaunted, undertakes the journey. The hero himself furnishes the description.
I came to a glen at night, Lions I saw and was afraid. I raised my head and prayed to Sin.
To the leader (?) of the gods my prayer came. [He heard my prayer (?)], and was gracious to me.
On many seal cylinders and on monuments, Gilgamesh is pictured in the act of fighting with or strangling a lion. In the
preserved portions of the epic no reference to this contest has
been found. 3 We should look for it at this point of the narra
tive. The following lines contain a reference to weapons,
ax and sword, and in so far justify the supposition that some contest takes place. But the text is too mutilated to warrant
further conjectures. After escaping from the danger occasioned
by the lions, Gilgamesh comes to the mountain Mashu, which is described as a place of terrors, the entrance to which is
guarded by
*
scorpion-men.' He reached the mountain Mashu,

Zimmern and Jensen prefer Sitnapishtim, but see Haupt's remarks on the objections to this reading in Schrader, Keilinschriften rind das Alte Testament (3d edition) a. I. At the recent Eleventh International Congress of Orientalists, Scheil presented a tablet dealing with the deluge narrative. If his reading is correct, the evidence would be final for the form Pzrnapishtim, formerly proposed by Zimmern (Babylonische Busspsalmen, p. 26). See p. 507, note i.

THE GILGAMESH EPIC. 489
And whose breast 1 reaches to Aralu; 2
Scorpion-men guard its gate, Of terror-inspiring aspect, whose appearance is deadly, Of awful splendor, shattering mountains. At sunrise and sunset they keep guard over the sun.
It will be recalled that the earth is pictured by the Babylo
nians as a mountain. The description of Mashu is dependent upon this conception. The mountain seems to be coextensive with the earth. The dam of heaven is the point near which
the sun rises, and if the scorpion-men guard the sun at sunrise and sunset, the mountain must extend across to the gate through
which the sun passes at night to dip into the great Apsu? Aralu is situated under the earth, and Mashu, reaching down to Aralu, must be again coextensive with the earth in this
direction. The description of Mashu accordingly is a reflex of
the cosmological conceptions developed in Babylonia. The scorpion-men pictured on seal cylinders 4 belong to the mythical monsters, half-man, half-beast, with which the world was peopled at the beginning of things. However, there is also an historical background to the description. The name Mashu appears in texts as the Arabian desert to the west and south
west of the Euphrates Valley.5 It is called a land of dryness, where neither birds nor gazelles nor wild asses are found. Even
the bold Assyrian armies hesitated before passing through this
region. In the light of the early relationships between Babylonia and Arabia, 6 this reference to Mashu may embody a tradi
tion of some expedition to Southern Arabia. 7 Beyond Mashu

lay a great sea, perhaps the Arabian Sea, which Gilgamesh is obliged to cross ere he reaches his goal.
Gilgamesh is terrified at the sight of these scorpion-men but the latter have received notice of his coming and permit
him to pass through the gate.
A scorpion-man addresses his wife :
" He who comes to us is of divine appearance."
The wife of the scorpion-man agrees that Gilgamesh is in part divine, but she adds that in part he is human. In further
conversation, the scorpion-man announces that it is by express command of the gods that Gilgamesh has come to the mountain.
Gilgamesh approaches and tells the scorpion-man of his purpose. The hero, recovering his courage, is not held back by the de
scription that the scorpion-man gives him of the dangers that beset the one who ventures to enter the dreadful district. The
gate is opened and the journey begins.
He gropes his way for one double hour, With dense darkness enclosing him on all sides. He gropes his \vay for twro double hours, With dense darkness enclosing him on all sides.
After traversing a distance of .twenty-four hours' march, Gilgamesh beholds a tree of splendid appearance, decorated with
precious stones and bearing beautiful fruit. Finally he reaches the sea, where the maiden Sabitum has her palace and throne.
Upon seeing the hero, the maiden locks the gates of her palace and will not permit Gilgamesh to pass across the sea. Gilgamesh pleads with Sabitum, tells of the loss of his friend Eabani, 'who has become dust,' 1 and whose fate he does not wish to
share.
Gilgamesh speaks to Sabitum :
" [Now] Sabitum, which is the way to Parnapishtim ?
If it is possible, let me cross the ocean.
If it is not possible, let me stretch myself on the ground." 2
1 Haupt, pp. 12, 67. 2 Attitude of despair.



THE GILGAMESH EPIC. 491
Sabitum speaks to Gilgamesh :
" O Gilgamesh ! there has never been a ferry, And no one has ever crossed the ocean. Shamash, the hero, has crossed it, but except Shamash, who can cross it ? Difficult is the passage, very difficult the path. Impassible (?) the waters of death that are guarded by a bolt.
How canst thou, O Gilgamesh, traverse the ocean ?
And after thou hast crossed the waters of death, what wilt thou do ? "
Sabitum then tells Gilgamesh that there is one possibility of
his accomplishing his task. If Ardi-Ea, 1 the ferryman 2 of
Parnapishtim, will take Gilgamesh across, well and good ; if not, he must abandon all hope.
The ocean, though not expressly called Apsu, is evidently identical with the great body of waters supposed to both sur
round the earth and to flow beneath it.3 The reference to 'the waters of death ' thus becomes clear. The gathering-place of
the dead being under the earth, near to the Apsu, the great ' Okeanos ' forms a means of approach to the nether world. It
is into this ocean, forming part of the Apsu, that the sun dips
at evening and through which it passes during the night. The scene between Gilgamesh and Sabitum accordingly is suggested, in part, by the same cosmological conceptions that condition the description of the mountain Mashu.
Sabitum herself is a figure that still awaits satisfactory ex
planation. She is called the goddess Siduri. 4 The name of
this goddess is found as an element in proper names, but of
her traits we know nothing. Sabitum appears originally to have been a term descriptive of her, and Hommel 5 may be right in explaining the name as f the one from Sabu,' 6 and in
taking the latter as the name of a district in Arabia. It is tempting to think of the famous Saba in Southern Arabia.

492 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
Obedient to the advice of Sabitum, Gilgamesh tells Ardi-Ea
his story and also his desire.
Now Ardi-Ea, which is the way to [Parnapishtim ?]. If it is possible, let me cross the ocean, And if not possible, let me lie outstretched on the ground.
Ardi-Ea consents, and tells Gilgamesh to take his ax, to go
into the woods, and to cut down a large pole that may serve as a rudder.
Gilgamesh, upon hearing this, Takes an ax in his hand, . . . Goes to the wood and makes a rudder five^ar 1 long. Gilgamesh and Ardi-Ea mount the ship.
The ship tosses from side to side. After a course of one month and fifteen days, on the third day 2 Ardi-Ea reaches the waters of death.
This appears to be the most dangerous part of the voyage. Ardi-Ea urges Gilgamesh to cling to the rudder, and counts the strokes he is to take.3 The waters are not extensive, for only
twelve strokes are enumerated; but the current is so strong that
it is with the utmost difficulty that Gilgamesh succeeds in pass
ing through them. At last, Gilgamesh is face to face with
Parnapishtim. The latter is astonished to see a living person come across the waters. Gilgamesh addresses Parnapishtim
from the ship, recounts his deeds, among which we distinguish 4 the killing of a panther, of Alia, of the divine bull, and of Khumbaba. The death of Eabani is also dwelt upon, and then
Gilgamesh pleads with Parnapishtim, tells him of the long, difficult way that he has traveled, and of all that he has encoun
tered on the road.
Difficult lands I passed through, All seas I crossed. 1 A large measure. 2 Of the week? Hommel and others interpret that Gilgamesh accomplishes the
'forty-five days' journey' in three days. 3 This I take to be the meaning of the numbers introduced at this point. 4 The text is badly mutilated.



THE GJLGAMESU EPIC. 493
Parnapishtim expresses his sympathy:
Gilgamesh has filled his heart with woe, But neither gods nor men [can help him (?)].
Parnapishtim thereupon addresses Gilgamesh, showing him how impossible it is for any mortal to escape death. The inexorable law will prevail as long as * houses continue to be
built/ as long as 'friendships
' and 'hostilities '
prevail, as long 'as the waters fill (?) the sea.' The Anunnaki, the great gods,
and the goddess Mammitum, the creators of everything
Determine death and life. No one knows the days of death. 1
At this point Gilgamesh propounds a most natural question: How comes it, if what Parnapishtim says is true, that the latter
is alive, while possessing all the traits of a human being? The
eleventh tablet of the epic begins :
Gilgamesh speaks to him, to Parnapishtim, the far-removed :
" I gaze at thee in amazement, Parnapishtim. Thy appearance is normal. As I am, so art thou. Thy entire nature 2 is normal. As I am, so art thou.
Thou art completely equipped for the fray.3 Armor 4 (?) thou hast placed upon thee. Tell me how thou didst come to obtain eternal life among the gods."
In reply, Parnapishtim tells the story of his escape from the common fate of mankind. The story is a long one and has no connection with the career of Gilgamesh. It embodies a recol
lection of a rain-storm that once visited a city, causing a general
destruction, but from which Parnapishtim and his family miraculously escaped. The main purport of the tale is not to em
phasize this miracle, but the far greater one that, after having been saved from the catastrophe, Parnapishtim should also have
been granted immortal life. The moral, however, is that the ex
1 There is no limit to the rule of death. Death alone is ' immortal.'
2 As Haupt correctly interprets. 3 This appears to be the sense of this rather obscure line.
4 Read [sir-ia]-am ?



494 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION^
ception proves the rule. With this tradition of the destruction of a certain place, there has been combined a nature myth symbolizing the annual overflow of the Euphrates, and the temporary
disappearance of all land that this inundation brought about,
prior to the elaborate canal system that was developed in the
valley. It is the same myth that we have come across in the creation epic and which, as we have seen, was instrumental in
moulding the advanced cosmological conceptions of the Babylonians.
In Parnapishtim's tale, the myth is given a more popular form. There is no attempt made to impart a scholastic inter
pretation to it. In keeping with what we have seen to be the
general character of the Gilgamesh epic, the episode introduced at this point embodies popular traditions and, on the whole,
popular conceptions. The spirit of the whole epic is the same that we find in the Thousand and One Nights or in the Arabian romance of Antar.
The oriental love of story-telling has produced the Gilgamesh
epic and, like a true story, it grows in length, the oftener it is told.
Gilgamesh is merely a peg upon which various current tradi
tions and myths are hung. Hence the combination of Gilgamesh's adventures with those of Eabani, and hence also the
association of Gilgamesh with Parnapishtim. A trace, perhaps, of scholastic influence may be seen in the purport of Parna
pishtim's narrative to prove the hopelessness of man's securing immortality ; and yet, while the theology of the schools may thus have had some share in giving to the tale of Parnapish
tim its present shape, the problem presented by Gilgamesh's adventures is a popular rather than a scholastic one. Even to
the primitive mind, for whom life rather than death constitutes
the great mystery to be solved, the question would suggest itself whether death is an absolutely necessary phase through which man must pass. The sun, moon, and stars do not die, the streams have perpetual life ; and since all manifestations of life



THE GILGAMEXIl EPIC. 495
were looked at from one point of view, why should not man also
remain alive ? Beyond some touches in the narrative, we may,
therefore, regard Parnapishtim's story, together with the 'lesson '
it teaches, as an interesting trace of the early theology as it took shape in the popular mind. What adds interest to the
story that Parnapishtim tells, is its close resemblance to the Biblical story of the Deluge. It also recalls the destruction
of Sodom, and we shall have occasion 1 to show the significance
of these points of contact. Bearing in mind the independent character of the Parnapishtim episode, and the motives that
led to its being incorporated in the adventures of Gilgamesh, we may proceed with our analysis of this interesting eleventh tablet. Thanks to the labors of Haupt, the numerous fragments
of it representing several copies, have been pieced together so as to form an almost complete text. 2 In reply to Gilgamesh's
queries,
Parnapishtim spoke to Gilgamesh:
" I will tell thee, Gilgamesh, the marvellous story, And the decision of the gods I will tell thee.
The city Shurippak, a city which, as thou knowest, Lies on the Euphrates, That city was corrupt,3 so that the gods thereof, Decided to bring a rainstorm upon it.
All of the great gods, Anu, their father, Their counsellor, the warrior Bel, The bearer of destruction Ninib, Their leader En-nugi, The lord of unsearchable wisdom, Ea, was with them, To proclaim their resolve to the reed-huts.
Reed-hut, reed-hut, clay structure, clay structure, Reed-hut, hear ! Clay structure, give ear !
"
The ordinary houses of Babylonia were constructed of reeds,
1 See below, p. 507. 2 The restored text in Haupt's edition of the Nimrodepos, pp. 134-149.
3 So Zimmern ingeniously suggests la bir, " not pure," instead of the rendering old ' as hitherto proposed.



496 , BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
while the temples and palaces were built of hard-baked clay.
" Reed-hut " and "
clay structure," thus embracing the archi
tecture of the country, are poetically used to designate the inhabitants of Shurippak. The address to the huts and struc
tures has been appropriately compared by Professor Haupt to the opening words of Isaiah's prophecies. 1
Hear, Heavens ! and give ear, Earth !
Ea's words are intended as a warning to the people of Shu
rippak. The warning comes appropriately from Ea as the god of humanity, who according to some traditions is also the crea
tor of mankind, and who is the teacher and protector of man
kind. Opposed to Ea is Bel, the old Bel of Nippur, who is represented as favoring the destruction of humanity. The story
in this way reflects a rivalry between the Ea and Bel cults.
Of Shurippak, against which the anger of the gods is enkindled, we unfortunately know nothing, 2 but it is fair to assume that there was an ancient city of that name, and which was de
stroyed by an overflow of the Euphrates during the rainy season. The city need not necessarily have been one of much importance.
Its sad fate would naturally have impressed itself upon the
memory of the people, and given rise to legends precisely as the disappearance of Sodom 3 or of the destruction of the tribes of
Ad and Thamud gave rise to fantastic stories among Hebrews
and Arabs respectively. 4
.
Ea, not content with the general warning, sends a special message to Parnapishtim, one of the inhabitants of Shurippak.
O man of Shurippak, son of Kidin-Marduk ! 5
Erect a structure,6 build a ship,
1 Isaiah i. i.

THE GILGAMESH EPIC. 497
Abandon your goods, look after the souls, 1
Throw aside your possessions, and save your life, Load the ship with all kinds of living things.
The god then tells Parnapishtim in what manner to build the ship. Its dimensions should be carefully measured. Its
breadth and depth should .be equal, and when it is finished,
Parnapishtim is to float it. The warning from Ea comes to him in a dream, as we learn from a subsequent part of the
story. Parnapishtim does not deem it necessary to dwell upon this, for it is only through dreams that the gods communicate with kings and heroes.
Parnapishtim declares his readiness to obey the orders of
Ea, but like Moses upon receiving the command of Yahwe, he asks what he should say when people question him.
What shall I answer the city, the people, and the elders?
Ea replies :
Thus answer and speak to them : Bel has cast me out in his hatred, So that I can no longer dwell in your city. On Bel's territory I dare no longer show my face; Therefore, I go to the ' deep ' to dwell with Ea my lord.
Bel's domain is the earth, while Ea controls the watery ele
ments. Bel's hostility to mankind is limited to the inhabitants
of the dry land. The moment that Parnapishtim enters Ea's domain he is safe. The answer thus not only furnishes the
real motive for the building of the ship, but further illustrates
the purport of the narrative in its present form. It is a glorifi
cation of Ea at the expense of Bel, and it is not difficult to
detect the thought underlying the story that the evils afflicting mankind on earth are due to the hostility of the 'chief demon, ''J who becomes the controller of the earth and of the atmosphere

immediately above the earth. Ea's answer is not intended to
be equivocal, for he further orders Parnapishtim to announce
to his fellow-citizens the coming destruction.
Over you a rainstorm will come, Men, birds, and beasts will perish.
The following line l is defective, but it appears to except from the general destruction the fish as the inhabitants of the
domain controlled by Ea. The time when the catastrophe is
to take place is vaguely indicated.
When Shamash will bring on the time, then the lord of the whirlstorm Will cause destruction to rain upon you in the evening.
The ' lord of the whirlstorm ' is Ramman, and the reference
to this deity specifies the manner in which the catastrophe will
be brought about. As in the Biblical story,
* the windows of heaven are to be opened,' the rains will come down, driven by
the winds that are to be let loose. It has been supposed that
because the ship of Parnapishtim drifts to the north that the
storm came from the south. 2 No stress, however, is laid upon
the question of direction in the Babylonian narrative. The
phenomenon of a whirlstorm with rain is of ordinary occurrence ; its violence alone makes it an exceptional event, but be it
noted not a miraculous one. Nor are we justified in attributing the deluge to the rush of waters from the Persian Gulf,
for this sheet of water is particularly sacred to Ea as the begin
ning of the "great deep." It would be an insult to Ea's dignity
to suppose that he is unable to govern his own territory. The catastrophe comes from above, from Ramman and his associates
who act at the instigation of the belligerent Bel. Parnapishtim begins at once to build the ship. He gathers his material, and on the fifth day is ready to construct the hull. The ship resembles the ordinary craft still used on the Eu

phrates. It is a flat-Bottomed skiff with upturned edges. On
this shell the real ' house ' * of Parnapishtim is placed. The
structure is accurately described. Its height is one hundred and twenty cubits, and its breadth is the same, in accordance
with the express orders given by Ea. No less than six floors
are erected, one above the other.
Then I built six stories,2 So that the whole consisted of seven apartments. The interior 3 I divided into nine parts.
The structure may properly be called a ' house boat,' and its
elaborate character appears from the fact that it contains no less
than sixty-three compartments. Parnapishtim carefully provides plugs to fill out all crevices, and furthermore smears a
large quantity of bitumen without and within.
I provided a pole,4 and all that was necessary, Six sar 5 of bitumen 6 I smeared on the outside,7 Three sar of pitch [I smeared] on the inside.
He also has a large quantity of oil placed on the boat, oxen, jars filled with mead 8
oil, and wine for a festival, which he insti
tutes at the completion of the structure. The preparations are
on a large scale, as for the great New Year's Day celebrated in
Babylonia. The ship is launched, and, if Professor Haupt is correct in his interpretation, the ship took water to the extent
of two-thirds of its height.
The side of the ship dipped two-thirds into water.

Parnapishtim now proceeds to take his family and chattels on board.
All that I had, I loaded on the ship. With all the silver that I had, I loaded it, With all the gold that I had, I loaded it, With living creatures of all kinds I loaded it.
I brought on board my whole family and household, Cattle of the field, beasts of the field, workmen, all this I took on board.
Parnapishtim is ready to enter the ship, but he waits until the time fixed for the storm arrives.
When the time came For the lord of the wrhirlstorm to rain down destruction,
I gazed at the earth, I was terrified at its sight, I entered the ship, and closed the door. To the captain of the ship, to Puzur-Shadurabu,1 the sailor, I entrusted the structure 2 with all its contents.
The description of the storm follows, in diction at once
impressive and forcible.
Upon the first appearance of dawn, There arose from the horizon dark clouds, Within which Ramman caused his thunder to resound. Nabu and Sharru 3 marched at the front, The destroyers passed across mountains and land, Dibbarra * lets loose the . . . .5 Ninib advances in furious hostility. The Anunnaki raise torches, Whose sheen illumines the universe, As Ramman's whirlwind sweeps the heavens,
And all light is changed to darkness.

The destructive elements, thunder, lightning, storm, rain, are thus let loose. The dreadful storm lasts for seven days.
The terror of men and gods is splendidly portrayed.
Brother does not look after brother, Men care not for another. In the heavens, Even the gods are terrified at the storm. They take refuge in the heaven of Anu. 1 The gods cowered like dogs at the edge of the heavens.
With this description the climax in the narrative is reached.
The reaction begins. Ishtar is the first to bewail the destruc
tion that has been brought about, and her example is followed
by others of the gods.
Ishtar groans like a woman in throes,
The lofty goddess cries with loud voice, The world of old has become a mass of clay. 2
Ishtar appears here in the role of the mother of mankind.
She feels that she has none but herself to blame for the catas
trophe, for, as one of the great gods, she must have been present at the council when the storm was decided on, and must
have countenanced it. She therefore reproaches herself :
That I should have assented 3 to this evil among the gods ! That when I assented to this evil, I was for the destruction of my own creatures ! 4
What I created, where is it ? Like so many fish, it 5 fills the sea.
From the words of Ishtar it would appear that the storm had assumed larger dimensions than the gods, or at least than
some of them, had anticipated. At the beginning of the episode, Shurippak alone is mentioned, and Ishtar apparently wishes to say that when she agreed to the bringing on of the storm, she

was not aware that she was decreeing the destruction of all
mankind. It is evident that two distinct traditions have been
welded together in the present form of the Babylonian document, one recalling the destruction of a single city, the other
embodying in mythological form the destructive rains of Baby
lonia that were wont to annually flood the entire country before
the canal system was perfected. Some particularly destructive season may have formed an additional factor in the combination of the traditions. At all
events, the storm appears to have got beyond the control of the
gods, and none but Bel approves of the widespread havoc that
has been wrought. It is no unusual phenomenon in ancient
religions to find the gods powerless to control occurrences that they themselves produced. The Anunnaki even more directly
implicated than Ishtar in bringing on the catastrophe join the goddess in her lament at the complete destruction wrought.
The gods, together with the Anunnaki, wept with her. The gods, in their depression, sat down to weep, Pressed their lips together, were overwhelmed with grief (?). The storm could no longer be quieted.
For six days and nights Wind, rain-storm, hurricane swept along ; When the seventh day arrived, the storm began to moderate, Which had waged a contest like a great host. The sea quieted down, wind and rain-storm ceased.
Parnapishtim then gazes at the destruction.
Bitterly weeping I looked at the sea, For all mankind had been turned to clay. 1 In place of dams, everything had become a marsh. I opened a hole so as to let the light fall upon my face, And dumbfounded, I sat down and wept. Tears flowed down my face. I looked in all directions, naught but sea.

But soon the waters began to diminish.
After twelve double hours 1 an island appeared, The ship approached the mountain Nisir.
The name given to the first promontory to appear is significant. Nisir signifies 'protection' or 'salvation.' The house
boat clings to this spot.
At this mountain, the mountain Nisir, the boat stuck fast.
For six days the boat remains in the same position. At the
beginning of the seventh day, Parnapishtim endeavors to ascertain whether the waters have abated sufficiently to permit him
to leave the boat.
When the seventh day approached I sent forth a dove. The dove flew about
But, finding no resting place, returned; Then I sent forth a swallow. The swallow flew about
But, finding no resting place, returned; Then I sent forth a raven. The raven flew off, and, seeing that the waters had decreased, Cautiously 2 (?) waded in the mud, but did not return.
Parnapishtim is satisfied, leaves the ship, and brings a sacrifice to the gods on the top of the mountain. In seven large
bowls he places calamus, cedarwood, and incense.
The gods inhaled the odor, The gods inhaled the sweet odor, The gods gathered like flies around the sacrificer.
A solemn scene ensues. Ishtar, the ' mistress of the gods,' swears by the necklace given to her by her father, Anu, that
she will never forget these days.

504 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
Let the gods come to the sacrifice, 1 But Bel must not come to the sacrifice ;
Since, without consultation,'2 he caused the rain-storm, And handed over my creation 3 to destruction.
Bel thus appears to be the one who alone knew of the extent which the destruction was destined to reach. The annihilation of all mankind was his work, undertaken without consulting his
associates. The latter were aware only of the intended destruc
tion of a single place, Shurippak. At this moment Bel approaches. He does not deny his deed, but is enraged that the planned destruction should not have been
complete, since Parnapishtim and his household have escaped.
As Bel approached And saw the ship, he was enraged, Filled with anger against the gods the Igigi. ' What person has escaped (?) ? No one was to survive the destruction.'
Ninib reveals the fact of Ea's interference:
Ninib opened his mouth and spoke, spoke to the belligerent Bel :
" Who but Ea could have done this ? For is it not Ea who knows all arts ? "
Ea appeals to Bel:
Ea opened his mouth and spoke, spoke to the belligerent Bel :
" Thou art the belligerent leader of the gods, But why didst thou, without consultation, bring on the rainstorm ? Punish the sinner for his sins, Punish the evil-doer for his evil deeds, But be merciful so as not to root out completely,
Be considerate not to destroy everything."
The terrors inspired by the deluge are well portrayed in the
continuation of Ea's speech. He tells Bel that he should have
brought on anything but a deluge.

Instead of bringing on a deluge, Let lions come and diminish mankind.1
Instead of bringing on a deluge, Let tigers come and diminish mankind.

Instead of bringing on a deluge, Let pestilence 2 come and waste the land.
Ea then confesses that through his instigation Parnapishtim was saved.
While I did not reveal the decision of the great gods, I sent Adra-Khasis 8 a dream which told him of the decision of the gods.
It is a misconception to regard this answer of the god as
equivocal. Ea means to say that he did not interfere with the
divine decree. He simply told Parnapishtim to build a ship,
leaving to the latter to divine the reason. Ea, it is true, tells
Parnapishtim of Bel's hatred, but he does not reveal the secret
of the gods. After Ea's effective speech Bel is reconciled, and
the scene closes dramatically, as follows :
Bel came to his senses, Stepped on board of the ship, Took me by the hand and lifted me up, Brought up my wife, and caused her to kneel at my side, Turned towards us, stepped between us, and blessed us. ' Hitherto Parnapishtim was human,4 But now Parnapishtim and his wife shall be gods like us. 5 Parnapishtim shall dwrell in the distance, at the confluence of the streams.' Then they took me and placed me in the distance, at the confluence of the streams.

3 I.e., the ' very clever ' or ' very pious,' an epithet given to Parnapishtim. The inverted form, Khasis-adra, was distorted into Xisusthros, which appears in the writers dependent upon Berosus as the name of the hero of the Babylonian deluge. See, e.g., Cory's Ancient Fragments, pp. 52, 54, 60, etc. The epithet appears also in the Legend of Etana (pp. 523, 524), where it is applied to a ' wise ' young eagle. 4 Ije., mortal. 5 /^., immortal. Cf. Gen. iii. 22.



506 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
The streams are, according to Haupt, 1 the four rivers
Euphrates, Tigris, Karun, and Kercha, which at one time emptied their waters independently into the Persian Gulf.
Parnapishtim's dwelling-place is identical with the traditional Paradise of the Babylonians and Hebrews.
It will be proper before leaving the subject, to dwell briefly upon the points of contact between this Babylonian tale and the Biblical narrative of the Deluge. The source of the tradi
tion must be sought in the Euphrates Valley. The ark of Noah can only be understood in the light of methods of navi
gation prevailing in Babylonia ; and it is in Babylonia, and not Palestine, that the phenomenon was annually seen of large portions of land disappearing from view.
The Babylonian tale is to be differentiated, as already suggested, into two parts, the destruction of Shurippak and the
annual phenomenon of the overflow of the Euphrates. The combination of these two elements results in the impression
conveyed by Parnapishtim's narrative that the rain-storm took
on larger dimensions than was originally anticipated by the gods. The Biblical narrative is based upon this combination,
but discarding those portions of the tale which are of purely
local interest makes the story of a deluge, a medium for illus
trating the favor shown by Yahwe towards the righteous man, as represented by Noah. The Biblical narrative ends, as does
the Babylonian counterpart, with the assurance that a deluge will not sweep over the earth again ; but viewed from a mono
theistic aspect, this promise is interpreted as signifying the establishment of eternal laws; a thought that is wholly foreign
to the purpose of the Babylonian narrative.
The slight variations between the Biblical and Babylonian
narratives, and upon which it is needless to dwell, justify the conclusion that the Hebrew story is not directly borrowed from
1 Wo Lag das Parodies (Ueber Land Ttnd Meer, 1894-95, no. 15).



THE GILGAMESH EPIC. 507
the Babylonian version. 1 The divergences are just of the char
acter that will arise through the independent development and the independent interpretation of a common tradition. The destruction of Shurippak has a Biblical parallel in the destruc
tion of Sodom 2 and of the surrounding district. Sodom, like Shurippak, is a city full of wickedness. Lot and his household
are saved through direct intervention, just as Parnapishtiin and his family escape through the intervention of Ea. Moreover, there are traces in the Sodom narrative of a tradition which
once gave a larger character to it, involving the destruction of
all mankind, 8 much as the destruction of Shurippak is enlarged by Babylonian traditions into a general annihilation of mankind.
It is to be noted, too, that no emphasis is laid upon Lot's piety,
and in this respect, as in others, Parnapishtim bears more resemblance to Lot than to Noah. The hostility between Bel and Ea, which we have seen plays
a part in the Babylonian narrative, belongs to the larger mythological element in the episode, not to the specific Shurippak incident. Bel, as the god whose dominion includes the atmo
sphere above the earth, controls the '
upper waters.' At his
1 The Hebrew account, it must be remembered, consists of two narratives dovetailed into one another. According to the one version the Yahwistic the rain
storm continued for forty days and forty nights ; according to the other the priestly narrative one hundred and fifty days pass before the waters began to diminish and a year elapses before Noah leaves the ark. The Yahwistic narrative lays stress upon the ritualistic distinction of clean and unclean animals, but on the whole, the Yahwistic version approaches closer to the Babylonian tale. Evidence has now been furnished that among the Babylonians, too, more than one version of the tradition existed. At the Eleventh International Congress of Orientalists (September, 1897), Scheil presented a tablet, dating from the days of Hammurabi, in which the story of a deluge is narrated in a manner quite different from the Gilgamesh epic. The tablet also furnishes the phonetic reading //-*>, and Scheil is of the opinion that these two syllables form the first element in the name of the hero. Unfortunately, the tablet is badly mutilated at this point, so that the question of the reading is not absolutely certain. See p. 488, note 2. 2 Gen. xix. 3 Note the phrase in Gen. xix. 31, "there is no one on earth," and see Pietschman, Gcschichte der Phonizicr, p. 115.



508 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
instigation these waters descend and bring destruction with them. But Ea's dominion the * deep ' and the streams
are beneficent powers. The descent of the upper waters is in
the nature of an attack upon Ea's kingdom. It is through Ea
that the mischief produced by Bel is again made good. Such
a conception falls within the domain of popular mythology. An ancient rivalry between Nippur, the seat of Bel and Eridu
(or some other seat of Ea worship), may also have entered
as a factor, if not in giving rise to the story, at least in main
taining it. If this be so, the story would belong to a period
earlier than Hammurabi, 1 since with the ascendancy of Babylon and of Marduk, the general tendency of religious thought is towards imbuing the gods with a kindly spirit towards one
another, joining issues, as in the creation epic, for the glorification of Marduk. The absence of Marduk from the deluge story
is another indication of the antiquity of the tradition.
Coming back now to the epic, Parnapishtim, whose sympathy has been aroused by the sight of Gilgamesh, makes an
attempt to heal the hero of his illness.
The life that thou seekest, thou wilt obtain. Now sleep !
Gilgamesh falls into a heavy stupor, and continues in this
state for six days and seven nights. An interesting dialogue ensues between Parnapishtim and his wife.
Parnapishtim says to his wife :
" Look at the man whose desire is life. Sleep has fallen upon him like a storm."
Says the wife to Parnapishtim :
" Transform him, let the man eat of the charm-root,2 Let him return, restored in health, on the road that he came.
Through the gate let him pass out, back to his country."
1 That the story was current as early as Hammurabi is now established by Scheil's
fragment (see note 2 on preceding page). 2 The word used is tu which means a charm or incantation in general.



THE GILGAMESII EPIC. 509
Parnapishtim says to his wife :
" The torture of the man pains thee. Cook the food 1 for him and place it at his head."
It is interesting to note that the woman appears as the exerciser of the disease. The wife of Parnapishtim whose
name is not mentioned as little as is the wife of Noah or Lot
proceeds to prepare the magic food. A plant of some kind is taken and elaborately treated.
While he 2 slept on board of his ship, She cooked the food and placed it at his head. While he 2 slept on board of his vessel,
Firstly, his food . . . ;
Secondly, it was pealed ; Thirdly, moistened; Fourthly, his bowl (?) was cleansed ; Fifthly, Shiba 3 was added ;
Sixthly, it was cooked; Seventhly, of a sudden the man was transformed and ate the magic food.4
Gilgamesh awakes and asks what has been done to him.
Parnapishtim tells him. But Gilgamesh is not completely healed. His body is still covered with sores. The magic potion must be followed by immersion into the fountain of life.
Parnapishtim instructs Ardi-Ea to convey Gilgamesh to this
fountain. He speaks to the ferryman.
The man whom thou hast brought is covered with sores.
The eruption on his skin has destroyed the beauty of his body.
Take him, O Ardi-Ea, to the place of purification, To wash his sores in the water, that he may become white as snow. Let the ocean carry off the eruption on his skin, That his body may become pure.5 Let his turban be renewed and the garment that covers his nakedness.
Ardi-Ea carries out these instructions and Gilgamesh at last
is healed. The hero is now ready to return to his land. But

510 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
though returning in restored health, he is not proof against death. Parnapishtim, at the suggestion of his wife, reveals the ' secret of life ' to Gilgamesh just before the latter's departure.
The ship is brought nearer to the shore, and Parnapishtim tells Gilgamesh of a plant that wounds as a thistle, but which possesses wonderful power. Gilgamesh departs on the ship, and with the help of Ardi-Ea finds this plant, which is called ' the
restoration of old age to youth.' It is a long journey to the
place. The plant grows at the side or at the bottom of a foun
tain. Gilgamesh secures it, but scarcely have his hands grasped the plant when it slips out of his hand and is snatched away by a demon that takes on the form of a serpent. All is lost !
Gilgamesh sits down and weeps bitter tears. He pours out his
woe to Ardi-Ea, but there is nothing left except to return to
Uruk. He reaches the city in safety. His mission the
search for immortality has failed. Though healed from his
disease, the fate of mankind old age and death is in store for him. With the return to Uruk the eleventh tablet ends. It
but remains, before passing on, to note that the narrative of the
deluge in this tablet is connected with the character of the
eleventh month, which is called the * month of rain.' We may conclude from this that the mythological element in the story the annual overflow predominates the local incident of the
destruction of Shurippak. Gilgamesh, we must bear in mind, has nothing to do with either the local tale or the myth, except
to give to both an interpretation that was originally foreign to the composite narrative.
In the twelfth tablet which is in large part obscure we
find Gilgamesh wandering from one temple to the other, from the temple of Bel to that of Ea, lamenting for Eabani, and ask
ing, again and again, what has become of his companion. What has been his fate since he was taken away from the land of the
living ? The hero, now convinced, as it seems, that death will come to him, and reconciled in a measure to his fate, seeks to



THE GILGAMESH EPIC. 511
learn another secret, the secret of existence after death. He
appeals to the gods of the nether world to grant him at least a
sight of Eabani. Nergal, the chief of this pantheon, consents.
... he opened the earth, And the spirit 1 of Eabani He caused to rise up like a wind.
Gilgamesh puts his question to Eabani:
Tell me, my companion, tell me, my companion,
The nature of the land which thou hast experienced, oh ! tell me.
Eabani replies :
I cannot tell thee, my friend, I cannot tell thee !
He seems to feel that Gilgamesh could not endure the
description. The life after death, as will be shown in a
subsequent chapter, is not pictured by the Babylonians as joyous. Eabani reveals glimpses of the sad conditions that
prevail there. It is the domain of the terrible Allatu, and Etana 2 is named among those who dwell in this region. Eabani
bewails his fate. 3 He curses Ukhat, whom, together with
Sadu, he holds responsible for having brought death upon him. In Genesis, it will be recalled, death likewise is viewed as the
consequence of Adam's yielding to the allurements of Eve.
Special significance, too, attaches to the further parallel to be drawn between Adam's punishment and Eabani's fate.
Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return
applies to Eabani as well as to Adam. He was formed of clay, as we have seen, 4 and when he dies he is ' turned to clay.'
5 Still
the fortunes awaiting those who die are not alike. Those who

512 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
die in battle seem to enjoy special privileges, provided, however, they are properly buried and there is some one to make them comfortable in their last hour and to look after them when dead.
Such persons are happy in comparison with the fate in store for
those who are neglected by the living. The one who is properly cared for, who
On a soft couch rests,
Drinking pure water,
Who dies in battle, as you and I have seen,1 * His father and mother supporting his head, His wife 2 ... at his side,
the spirit of such a one is at rest. The circumstances attending
death presage in a measure the individual's life after death.
But he whose corpse remains in the field, As you and I have seen, His spirit 3 has no rest in the earth. The one whose spirit is not cared for by any one, As you and I have seen,
He is consumed by gnawing hunger, by a longing for food. What is left on the street he is obliged to eat.4
To be left unburied was the greatest misfortune that could
happen to a dead person. With this sentiment the epic closes. Gilgamesh must rest
content with the unsatisfactory consolation that Eabani offers
him. Man must die, and Gilgamesh cannot escape the univer
sal fate. Let him hope for and, if possible, provide for proper burial when death does overtake him. He will then, at least,
not suffer the pangs of hunger in the world of spirits to which he must go. The twelfth tablet exhibits somewhat more traces of the

^,1.69,70).



THE GILGAMESH EPIC. 513
theology of the schools than the others. Eabani's speech, while
conveying sentiments that thoroughly represent the popular beliefs of Babylonia, is couched in terms that give to the address the character of a formal declaration of doctrines. The
conjuring up of the spirit of Eabani is also a feature that appears
to be due to theological influences, and the whole episode of Gilgamesh's wandering from place to place seeking for information appears to be a ' doublet ' suggested by the hero's wanderings, as narrated in the ninth and tenth tablets.
The problem propounded in the earlier tablets the search
for immortality is, as has been shown, a perfectly natural one
and of popular origin, but the problem with which Gilgamesh wrestles in the twelfth tablet, the secret of the life after death,
while suggested by the other, belongs rather to the domain
of theological and mystic speculation. This aspect of the twelfth tablet is borne out also by the fact that the problem
is not solved. The epic ends as unsatisfactorily as the Book of Job or Ecclesiastes. There is a tone of despair in the
final speech of Eabani, which savors of the schools of advanced
thought in Babylonia. For the problem of immortality, a definite solution at least is offered. Man can reach old age ; he
may be snatched for a time from the grasp of death, as Gilga
mesh was through the efforts of Parnapishtim, but he only deludes himself by indulging in hopes of immortal life.
' Man
must die ' is the refrain that rings in our ears. The plant of ' eternal youth '
slips out of one's hand at the very moment that one believes to have secured it.
The Gilgamesh epic, as we have it, thus turns out to be a com
posite production. Gilgamesh, a popular -hero of antiquity, becomes a medium for the perpetuation of various popular traditions and myths. The adventures of his career are com
bined with the early history of man. Of actual deeds performed
by Gilgamesh, and which belong to Gilgamesh's career as a hero,
warrior, and ruler, we have only four, the conquest of Erech,

his victory over Khumbaba. the killing of the divine bull, and
the strangling of the lion. 1 The story of Eabani, Ukhat, and Sadu is independent of Gilgamesh's career, and so also is the story of his wanderings to Mashu and his encounter with Par
napishtim. Gilgamesh is brought into association with Eabani
by what may be called, a natural process of assimilation. The
life of the hero is placed back at the beginning of things, and
in this way Gilgamesh is brought into direct contact with
legends of man's early fortunes, with ancient historical reminis
cences, as well as with nature-myths that symbolize the change of seasons and the annual inundations.
Popular philosophy also enters into the life of the hero.
Regarded as a god and yet of human origin, Gilgamesh becomes an appropriate illustration for determining the line that marks
off man's career from the indefinite extension of activity that
is a trait of the gods. Gilgamesh revolts against the uni
versal law of decay and is punished. He is relieved from
suffering, but cannot escape the doom of death. The sixth tablet marks an important division in the epic. The Ishtar and
Sabitum episodes and the narrative of Parnapishtim itself a
compound of two independent tales, one semi-historical, the other a nature-myth represent accretions that may refer to a time when Gilgamesh had become little more than a name, a
type of mankind in general. Finally, scholastic speculation takes hold of Gilgamesh, and makes him the medium for illustrating another and more advanced problem that is of intense
interest to mankind, the secret of death. Death is inevitable, but what does death mean ? The problem is not solved. The
1 The reference to the killing of a panther in the tenth tablet (Haupt, p. 71, 6) is too obscure to be taken into consideration. Gilgamesh's fight with a ' buffalo ' (so
Ward, " Babylonian Gods in Babylonian Art," Proc. Anter. Or. Soc., May, 1890, p. xv) is pictured on seal cylinders. No doubt, various deeds of Gilgamesh were recounted in the missing portions of the epic, and it is also quite likely that besides the stories in the epic, others were current of Gilgamesh to which a literary form was
never given.

close of the eleventh tablet suggests that Gilgamesh will die.
The twelfth tablet adds nothing to the situation except a
moral. Proper burial is essential to the comparative well-being of the dead.
The fact that Gilgamesh is viewed as a type in the latter half
of this remarkable specimen of Babylonian literature justifies us
in speaking of it, under proper qualification, as a ' national epic.' But it must be remembered that Gilgamesh himself belongs to a section of Babylonia only, and not to the whole of it ; and it is rather curious that one, of whom it can be said with certainty
that he is not even a native of Babylonia, should become the
personage to whom popular fancy was pleased to attach traditions and myths that are distinctively Babylonian in character
and origin. The story of Gilgamesh was carried beyond the confines of
Babylonia. 1 Gilgamesh, to be sure, is not identical with the
Biblical Nimrod, 2 but the Gilgamesh story has evidently influenced the description given in the tenth chapter of Genesis of
Nimrod, who is viewed as the type of Babylonian power and of the extension of Babylonian culture to the north.
The Gilgamesh epic is not a solar myth, as was once supposed, 3 nor is the Biblical story of Samson a pure myth, but
Gilgamesh becomes a solar deity, and it is hardly accidental that
Samson, or to give the Hebrew form of the name, Shimshon, is a variant form of Shamash? the name of the sun in Babylonian and Hebrew. The Biblical Samson appears to be modelled
upon the character of Gilgamesh. Both are heroes, both con

" Wer 1st Chadir?" Zeits.f. Assyr. vii. 109-112, who also suggests that Ahasverus, ' the Wandering Jew,' is a corruption of Adrakhasis. 2 It will be recalled that Nimrod is termed a ' mighty hunter' (said). This suggests a comparison with Sadu, ' the hunter,' in the Gilgamesh epic. See above, p. 475. 3 Originally suggested by H. C.

querors, both strangle a lion, and both are wooed by a woman, the one by Delila, the other by Ishtar, and both through a woman are shorn of their strength. The historical traits are
of course different. As for the relationships of the Gilgamesh epic to the Hercules story, the authority of Wilamowitz
Mollendorf L is against an oriental origin of the Greek tale, and
yet such parallels as Hercules' fight with a lion, his conquest
of death, his journey and search for immortality (which in contrast to Gilgamesh he secures), certainly point to an influence exercised by the oriental tale upon the Greek story. It is not surprising that the elements contributed through this influence
have been so modified in the process of adaptation to the purely Greek elements of the Hercules story, and, above all, to the Greek spirit, as to obscure their eastern origin.
2 Most
curious as illustrating the continued popularity of the Gilgamesh story in the Orient is the incorporation of portions of the epic in the career of Alexander the Great.3 In Greek, Syriac, and
Rabbinical writings, Alexander is depicted as wandering through a region 4 of darkness and terror in search of the * water of life.'
He encounters strange beings, reaches the sea, but, like Gilgamesh, fails to secure immortality. Such were the profound changes wrought by Alexander's conquests that popular fancy, guided by a correct instinct of appreciation of his career, converted the historical Alexander into a legendary hero of vast
dimensions. 5 The process that produced the Gilgamesh epic is

repeated, only on a larger scale, in the case of Alexander. Not one country, but the entire ancient culture world, Babylonia,
Persia, Egypt, Arabia, Judea, and Syria, combine to form the legendary Alexander. Each country contributes its share of
popular legends, myths, and traditions. Babylonia offers as her tribute the exploits of Gilgamesh, which it transfers in part to Alexander. The national hero becomes the type of the 'great
man,' and as with new conditions, a new favorite, representative of the new era, arises to take the place of an older one, the old
is made to survive in the new. Gilgamesh lives again in Alex
ander, just as traits of the legendary Alexander pass down to
subsequent heroes.



CHAPTER XXIV.
MYTHS AND LEGENDS.
NOT many years ago the impression appeared to be well founded that the Semites were poor in the production of myths
an.d legends as compared, for example, to the Hindus or
Greeks. The religious literature of the Babylonians, originating undoubtedly with the Semitic inhabitants of the Euphrates
Valley, reverses the impression. The ' creation ' and '
Gilgamesh '
epics suffice, not merely for what they contain, but for
what they imply, to accord to Babylonian mythology a high rank ; but in addition to these epics we have a large number of
tales of gods, demi-gods, demons, and spirits that illustrate the
capacity of the Babylonians for the production of myths. Indeed, there is no longer any reason for doubting that the
Babylonian mythology exercised considerable influence upon that of the Greeks. Further discoveries and researches may
show that distant India also felt at an early period the intel
lectual stimulus emanating from the Euphrates Valley. At all
events, many of the features found in Babylonian myths and legends bear so striking a resemblance to those occurring in
lands lying to the east and west of Babylonia, that a study of
Aryan mythology is sadly deficient which does not take into
account the material furnished by cuneiform literature. How
extensive the Babylonian mythology was must remain for the
present a matter of conjecture, but it is easier to err on the side of underestimation than on the side of exaggeration. If it be remembered that by far the smaller portion only of Ashur
banabal's library has been recovered, and that of the various
literary collections that were gathered in the religious centers

of the south, scarcely anything has as yet been found, it is certainly remarkable that we should be in possession of an elabor
ate tale of a demi-god, Etana, of an extensive legend recounting the deeds of the war and plague-god Difibarra, and of two genuine storm myths, while the indications in Dr. Bezold's catalogue of
the Kouyunjik collection justify us in adding to the list several
other myths and legends, among the still unpublished tablets of the British Museum. 1 These myths and legends have a two
fold value for us, a direct value because of the popular religious
ideas contained in them, and an indirect value by virtue of the
interpretation given to these ideas by the compilers. In the literary form that the popular productions received, the influ
ence of those who guided the religious thought into its proper channels is to be clearly seen.
THE ETANA LEGEND.
It will be recalled that we came across a hero Etana in the
Gilgamesh epic.
2 The name of the hero is Semitic, and sig
nifies '
strong.' 8 An identical name appears in the Old Testa
ment, 4 and it is possible that the Babylonian Etana represents, like Gilgamesh, some ancient historical person of whom a dim tradition has survived among other nations besides the Baby
lonians. The deeds recounted of him, however, place the
1 Some of these were already indicated (but only indicated) by George Smith in his Chaldaeische Genesis (German translation), pp. 136-142. It is the merit of Dr. E. J. Harper to have prepared an excellent publication of the material contained in
Smith's work, pp. 103-120, under the title " Die Babylonischen Legenden von Etana, Zu, Adapa und Dibbarra" (Delitzsch and Haupt's Beitrdge zur Assyriologic, ii. 390-521). Additional material is furnished by two publications of mine: (a) a mono
graph, "A Fragment of the Dibbarra Epic" (Boston, 1891), and (b) "A New Fragment of the Babylonian Etana Legend " (Delitzsch and Haupt's Beitrdge zur Assyriologie, iii. 363-381). See also Friedrich Jeremias in Chantepie de la Saussaye's Lehrlnich dcr Religionsgcschichte (2d edition), i. 218-221. 2 See above, p. 511. 3 See my remarks in Delitzsch and Haupt's Beitrdge zur Assyriologie, iii. 376. 4 I Kings, v. 11.



520 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
hero entirely in the domain of myth. His patron is Shamash, the sun-god, and in popular tradition he becomes a member of the pantheon of the nether world.
In the portions of the Etana legend preserved, 1 two episodes are detailed in the hero's career, one regarding the birth of a son, the other a miraculous journey. The former episode jus
tifies the assumption of a historical starting-point for the legend of Etana. 2 Among many nations the birth of a hero or of a
hero's son is pictured as taking place under great difficulties. Etana's wife is in distress because she is unable to bring to the
world a child which she has conceived. Etana appeals to
Shamash. Through the mediation of the priests he has offered
sacrifices, and he now prays to Shamash to show him the
"plant of birth."
The oracles 3 have completed my sacrifices, They have completed my free-will offerings to the gods.
O Lord, let thy mouth command, And give me the plant of birth, Reveal to me the plant of birth,
Bring forth the fruit, grant me an offspring.
Of Shamash's reply only one line is preserved intact, in which he tells Etana :
Take the road, ascend the mountain.
It is presumably upon the mountain that the plant grows whose magical power will insure the happy delivery of the expected offspring. Harper calls attention to a remarkable parallel to this incident which is found in the Armenian and
Mandaean legends of the birth of Rustem, the son of Sal. The latter's wife is unable to deliver her child because of its size.
Sal, who was reared by an eagle, has in his possession a pinion

MYTHS AND LEGENDS. 521
of the eagle, by means of which he can, when in distress, invoke the presence of the bird. The father throws the pinion
into the fire, and the eagle appears. The latter gives the mother a medicinal potion, and the child is cut out of the
womb. Etana, like Rustem, is accompanied by an eagle, and it would appear that the eagle aids Etana in obtaining the plant. 1
The eagle, in many mythologies, is a symbol of the sun, and it is plausible to conclude that the bird is sent to Etana at the
instigation of Shamash. Who the son is that Etana expects
we are not told, and naturally from a single episode like this and one so fragmentary preserved no safe conclusions
may be drawn. But the epic (if we may apply this term) must have recounted some achievements of Etana, and as the
'
strong
' one, his deeds must have borne some resemblance to those of Gilgamesh. The birth of the son, it is furthermore fair to presume, took place towards the end of Etana's career,
when his own life was drawing to a close. If a fragment 2 of
the tale were only better preserved, we would have an episode of Etana's earlier career. But such is the condition of this
fragment that, at the most, it can be said that Etana is engaged
in some conflict against a city, in which Ishtar, Bel, the Anun
naki, the Igigi, and some minor gods, as En-ninna, Sibittum, are involved. The Etana series, as we learn from the colophon
to this fragment, was known by a designation in which a city
3
occurs, and it may be that this is the city against which Etana,
aided by the gods, proceeds. Leaving this aside, it is fortunate that we have at least another episode in Etana's career
which enables us to establish the connecting link between the
hero as an historical personage and as a god or demi-god. As
Gilgamesh offers an insult to Ishtar, so Etana encounters the
ill-will of the great goddess, though through no direct offense.
1 The matter is not certain because of the sad condition of the fragments. 2 K. 2606, Harper, ib. pp. 399, 400. 3 Only a part of the name, /-si, is preserved.



522 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
The eagle tempts Etana to mount with him into the upper
regions. Etana is represented as giving, in part, an account of this adventure, in the first person. The gates of the upper
regions are opened, and Etana is terrified at the majestic sight which greets him. He sees a throne, and throws himself on
his countenance in terror. The gates are significantly desig
nated as the gate of Anu, Bel, and Ea, and the gate of Sin, Shamash, Ramman, and Ishtar. The introduction of the two
classes of the theological triads 1 reveals the influence of a scho
lastic elaboration of some popular myth. The eagle reassures
Etana, and addresses him as follows :
My friend lift up (?) [thy countenance],
Come and let me carry thee to the heaven [of Anu].
On my breast place thy breast,
On my pinion place thy palms,
On my side place thy side.
Etana obeys, and thus, securely attached to the eagle, begins
the daring journey. They fly for the space of a double hour, 2 when .
The eagle addresses Etana: Look, my friend, how the earth appears ; Look at the sea and at its side, the house of wisdom; 3 The earth appears as a mountain, the sea has become a pool (?).
A second double hour he (i.e., the eagle) carried him on high. The eagle spoke to Etana : Look, my friend, how the earth appears; The sea is a mere belt (?) around the earth. A third double hour he carried him on high.
The eagle spoke to Etana : Look, my friend, how the earth appears; The sea is a mere gardener's ditch.4
1 See pp. 108, 163. 2 I.e., an army's march of two hours. 8 The dwelling of Ea. See Meissner, Alexander and Gilgamos, p. 17. 4 I.e., still smaller.



MYTHS AND LEGENDS. 523
In this way they reach the gate of Anu, Bel, and Ea in
safety, where they take a rest. The eagle is not yet satisfied, and urges Etana to follow him to the domain of Ishtar.
Come, my friend [let me carry thee to Ishtar], With Ishtar, the mistress [of the gods, thou shalt dwell], In the glory of Ishtar, the mistress of the gods, [thou shalt sit ?].
On my side place thy side,
On my pinion place thy palms.
The gods, it will be seen, dwell on high in accordance with
the view developed by astronomical speculations. 1 Anu, Bel, and Ea are here evidently identified with the fixed stars bear
ing their names, 2 while under Ishtar the planet Ishtar-Venus is
meant. Etana yields, to the eagle's suggestion. They mount still higher. Earth and ocean grow still smaller, the former
appearing only as large as 'a garden bed,' the latter like 'a
courtyard.' For three double hours they fly. Etana appears to warn the eagle to desist from his rash intention, but the
warning comes too late. Etana and the eagle are thrown
down from the lofty regions. With lightning speed the descent takes place, until the two reach the ground. The further course
of the narrative is obscure. Was Etana punished by being
sent to the nether world, where we find him in the Gilgamesh
epic ? 3 There is a reference, unfortunately quite obscure, to the death of Etana, and perhaps to his shade, 4 in a portion of the tablet. One certainly expects both Etana and the eagle to be punished for their rash act, but until we can determine with certainty what became of both, and with what purport the tale is introduced into the career of Etana, the question must be
left open, as also the possibility of a connection between this flight of Etana and the similar Greek myth of Ganymede.
The introduction of the eagle points clearly to the mythological character of the tale, but flights of eagles occur so frequently
1 See above, p. 458. 8 See p. 511. 2 See p. 460. 4 Harper, ib. p. 404, note.



524 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
in the myths and legends of various nations that no great stress
is to be laid upon further parallels that might be adduced. 1 The story found in Aelian and which has already been referred
to 2 alone calls for mention here. According to this story, Gilga
mesh, whose birth is feared by his cruel grandfather Sokkaros, king of Babylonia, is thrown from the tower where his mother
was imprisoned and in which he was born, but in falling is
caught by an eagle and taken to a gardener who rears the child. The eagle being the associate of Etana, the suspicion
is justified that the child thus miraculously saved is in reality Etana and not Gilgamesh. At all events, there must be some connection between the story of Aelian and the Babylonian
legend under consideration. The fate of the eagle is recounted in another tablet of the Etana series, 3 which again furnishes an
episode paralleled in the mythologies of other nations. The eagle has lost favor with Shamash. Enmity has arisen
between the eagle and the serpent, and, curiously enough, the latter stands under the protection of the sun-god. What the
cause of the enmity between eagle and serpent was, may have been recounted in a missing portion of the tablet. The eagle
forms a plan of destroying the serpent's brood. He is warned
against this act by a young eagle, who is designated as a '
very clever young one.'
Do not eat, O my father, the net of Shamash is laid (?) ; The trap, the ban of Shamash, will fall upon thee and catch thee.
Who transgresses the law of Shamash, from him Shamash wrill exact
revenge.
But the eagle, we are told, paid no heed to the warning.
He descended and ate of the young of the serpent.
The serpent appeals to Shamash. He tells the sun-god of the cruel deed of the eagle :
1 See Harper, ib. pp. 406, 407. 2 See above, p. 469. 3 Harper, pp. 392-394.



MYTHS AND LEGENDS. 525
See, O Shamash, the evil that he has done to me. Help (?), O Shamash, thy net is the broad earth. Thy trap is the distant heavens.
Who can escape thy net ? * Zu, 2 the worker of evil, the source of evil [did not escape? 8].
Shamash responds to the appeal :
Upon his hearing the lament of the serpent, Shamash opened his mouth and spoke to the serpent : Go and ascend the mountain; The carcass of a wild ox make thy hiding-place. Open him, tear open his belly. Make a dwelling place [of his belly]. All the birds of heaven will come down; The eagle with them will come down.
Upon penetrating to the meat he will hastily proceed, Making for the hidden parts.4 As soon as he has reached the inside,5 seize him by his wing, Tear out his wing, his feather (?), his pinion, Tear him to pieces, and throw him into a corner, TO die a death of hunger and thirst.
This devilish plan is successfully carried out. With considerable skill the narrative describes how the eagle, suspecting some mischief, did not join the other birds, but when he saw that they escaped without harm felt reassured. He tells his brood :
Come, let us go and let us also pounce down upon the carcass of the wild ox and eat, we too.
The eagle is again warned by his "very clever" offspring. The rest of his brood join in the appeal, but
He did not hearken to them, and obeyed not the advice of his brood. He swooped down and stood upon the wild ox.
1 J.e., one cannot escape from Shamash, since he traverses all space.
2 A personification of the storm. See below, pp. 537 seq. The line is very obscure owing to the break in the tablet. 3 So Harper, but see pp. 541, 542. 4 I.e., he will dig his beak into the juicy part of the meat. 6 Of the carcass.



526 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
Still, he is not entirely free from suspicion, and the narrative continues :
The eagle inspected the carcass, looking carefully to the front and behind him.
He again inspected the carcass, looking carefully to the front and behind him.
Detecting nothing to justify his suspicions, he digs his beak into the carcass, but scarcely has he done so when the serpent
seizes hold of him. The eagle cries for mercy, and promises
the serpent a present of whatever he desires. The serpent is
relentless. To release the eagle would be to play false to Shamash.
If I release thee . . . Thy punishment will be transferred to me.
Thus the serpent justifies what he is about to do. In accord
ance with the instructions of the sun-god, the eagle is stripped
of his wings and feathers, and left to die a miserable death.
In its present form this tale of the eagle and serpent forms
part of the Etana story.
1 Jeremias is right in questioning whether it originally had anything to do with Etana. 2 Two
distinct stories have been combined, much as in the Gilgamesh epic several tales have been thrown together. The association of Etana with the eagle suggests the introduction of the episode
of the eagle's discomfiture. If one may judge of the two epi
sodes related of Etana, he is not a personage regarded with favor by the compilers. In both episodes we find him in dis
tress. His flight with the eagle is regarded as a defiance of the gods, though more blame attaches to the eagle than to him. Shamash can hardly have regarded with favor the ambition of
a human being to mount to the dwelling of the gods. Gilgamesh makes no such attempt, and Parnapishtim is not carried
1 As shown by the colophon of K. 2606, and also by the fact that K. 1547, which contains on the obverse the tale, contains on the reverse Etana's prayer to Shamash.

MYTHS AND LEGENDS. 527
on high, but to " the confluence of the streams." Gilgamesh,
it will also be recalled, is unable to pass to the nether world
where Eabani is placed, and in the following chapter we will
come across a tale intended to illustrate the impossibility of any one ever returning from the hollow under the earth where
the dead dwell. The story of Etana appears, therefore, to
emphasize the equal impossibility for any mortal to ascend to the dwelling of the gods. Etana is deified, but he belongs permanently to the region where all mortals go after their
career on earth is ended, the nether world. One gains the
impression, therefore, that Etana is a hero of antiquity who
is not approved of by the Babylonian priests. Similarly, the conflict between the eagle and the serpent suggests an opposition to the view which makes the eagle the symbol and mes
senger of Shamash. The eagle recalls the winged disc, the symbol of Ashur, 1 and the eagle occurs also as a standard
among the Hittites, 2 with whom, as we know, the Babylonians came into contact. The story of Shamash, himself, laying the trap for the eagle looks like a myth produced with some specific intent, an illustration of legitimate sun-worship against rival cults. As a matter of course, in the case of such a myth, it is
difficult to say where its popular character ends and the specu
lative or scholastic theory begins. But whatever may have
been the original purport of the tale, for our purposes its significance consists in the view unfolded of Shamash as the one
who wreaks vengeance on the evil-doer. Shamash appears in the episode in the role of the just judge that characterizes
him in the hymns and incantations. Etana's reliance upon
the eagle leads to disgrace and defeat. In a representation of the hero's flight on a seal cylinder, 3 the disapproval of the act

528 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
is indicated by the addition of two dogs in a crouching position,
their gaze directed towards the bird. The dogs are a symbol of the solar-god Marduk. 1
THE LEGEND OF DIBBARRA.
Of more direct religious import is a story recounted in a series comprising five tablets of the deeds of the war and
plague-god whose name is provisionally read Dibbarra. 2 He is
a solar deity identified in the theological system of the Babylonians with Nergal, but originally distinct and in all proba
bility one of the numerous local solar deities of Babylonia like
Nin-girsu and Nin-gishzida, Ishum and others, whose roles are absorbed by one or the other of the four great solar deities,
Shamash, Marduk, Ninib, and Nergal. Nergal representing the sun of midday and of the summer solstice, which brings in its wake destruction of various kinds, it was appropriate that
a god who came to be specifically viewed as the god who causes disease should be regarded as an aspect of the
terrible Nergal. In the legend that we are about to consider,
Dibbarra appears as the god of war. He is designated as the
' warrior.' The name of the god is written ideographically with a sign that has the meaning of ' servant' and 'man.' To this
sign the phonetic complement ra is added. In view of a passage in a lexicographical tablet, according to which the name of the god is designated as the equivalent of the. god Gir-ra, Jensen concluded that the name was to be read Gira, and
Delitzsch 3 is inclined to follow him. A difficulty, however, arises through the circumstance that the element Gir in the
name Gir-ra is itself an ideograph. In any case, the designation of the god as a * servant ' shows that he is described here by an
1 A lexicographical tablet, IIR. 56, col. iii. 22-25, mentions four dogs of Marduk. 2 See p. 232. 3 See Harper, ib. p. 426.



MYTHS AND LEGENDS. 529
epithet,
1 and not by his real name, which is to be sought rather
in the sense of f
strong,' that is one of the meanings of the ideo
graph gir. The epithet 'servant' belongs to the period when the god took his place in the theological system as one of the attend
ants of the great Nergal, just as the plague-god is himself accom
panied by a god Ishum, who acts as a kind of messenger or attendant to him. It should be added that what little evidence there was for the conventional reading Dibbarra 2 has now been
dispelled, so that but for the desire to avoid useless additions
to the nomenclature of the Babylonian deities, the form Gir-ra would have been introduced here, as for the present preferable. Where the cult of Dibbarra centered we do not know, but
that he presided over a district that must have played a promi
nent part at some period of Babylonian history is shown by the elaborate legend of his deeds for which, as in the case of
Gilgamesh and Etana, we are justified in assuming an historical background. In fact, the legend of Dibbarra is naught but a
poetic and semi-mythical disguise for severe conflicts waged against certain Babylonian cities by some rival power that
had its seat likewise in the Euphrates Valley.
Of the five tablets, but four fragments have as yet been found in such a condition as to be utilized. The longest of these contains an address to Dibbarra by his faithful attendant
Ishum, in which the power of the war-god is praised and some of his deeds recounted.
[The sons of] Babylon were (as) birds
And thou their falconer.
In a net thou didst catch them, enclose them, and destroy them,
O
! Warrior Dibbara, Leaving the city, 3 thou didst pass to the outside, Taking on the form of a lion, thou didst enter the palace. The people saw thee and drew (?) their weapons.
1 The ra is either a phonetic complement to the ideograph or is perhaps added to suggest to the reader the identification with Gir-ra. a Babylon. 2 Namely, the connection with Hebrew deber, '
pestilence.' Cf. Harper, ib. p. 426.



530 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
The reference in these lines is to an attack upon the city of
Babylon. The war-god is pictured as striking out in all directions, imprisoning the inhabitants of Babylon within the city walls, working havoc outside of the city, and not stopping short
at entering the palace. The metaphor of the war-god taking on the form of a lion confirms the identification of Dibbarra
with Nergal, who is generally pictured as a lion. In the following lines the enemy who makes this attack on
Babylon is introduced. He is designated as a '
governor,' and Dibbarra is represented as giving him certain instructions
to carry out. The title *
governor ' given to this enemy may be taken as an indication that the epic deals with the rivalry
existing among the states of Babylonia, each represented by its capitol. Ishum continues his address to Dibbarra :
The heart of the governor, intent upon taking vengeance on Babylon, was enraged, For capturing the possessions of the enemy, he sends out his army, Filled with enmity towards the people.
Dibbarra is represented as addressing this governor:
In the city whither I send thee, Thou shalt fear no one, nor have compassion. Kill the young and old alike, The tender suckling likewise spare no one. The treasures of Babylon carry off as booty.
Ishum continues his narrative :
The royal host was gathered together and entered the city. The bow was strung, the sword unsheathed. Thou didst blunt 1 (?) the weapons of the soldiers, The servitors of Anu and Dagan. Their blood thou caused to flow like torrents of water through the city's
highways. Thou didst tear open their intestines, and cause the stream to carry them off.
1 Text obscure. " Sharpen badly " seems to be the idiomatic phrase used.



MYTHS AND LEGENDS. 531
Dagari is here used for Bel, 1 and the phrase
f servitors of Anu and Dagan ' embraces the inhabitants of Babylon. Marduk,
the lord of Babylon, is enraged at the sight, but apparently is
powerless. The great lord Marduk saw it and cried " Alas !
"
His senses left him. A violent curse issued from his mouth.
At this point the tablet is defective, and when it again becomes intelligible we find Ishum describing an attack of Dibbarra
upon another of the great centers of the Euphrates Valley the city of Uruk. Uruk is called the *
dwelling of Anu and
Ishtar,' the city of the Kizreti, Ukhati, and Kharim&ti* the sacred harlots. Uruk suffers the same fate as Babylon:
A cruel and wicked governor thou didst place over them,
Who brought misery upon them, broke down (?) their laws. Ishtar was enraged and filled with anger because of Uruk.
Her opposition, however, is as powerless to stem Dibbarra's attack as was Marduk's grief at the onslaught on Babylon. Dibbarra's greed is insatiable. Ishum continues his address to him :
O warrior Dibbarra, thou dost dispatch the just, Thou dost dispatch the unjust,
Who sins against thee, thou dost dispatch, And the one who does not sin against thee thou dost dispatch.
The following lines reveal the purpose of Ishum's long
speech. A war more terrible even than the conflicts recounted
is planned by Ishum, one that is to involve all creation and extend to the higher regions. Ishum asks Dibbarra's consent to the fearful destruction held in view:
The brightness of Shul-pauddu 3 I will destroy. The root of the tree I will tear out That it no longer blossom ;

Against the dwelling of the king of gods, I will proceed. . . . The warrior Dibbarra heard him. 1 The speech of Ishum was pleasant to him as fine oil, And thus the warrior Dibbarra spoke:
Sea-coast [against] sea-coast, Subartu against Subartu, Assyrian against Assyrian, Elamite against Elamite, Cassite against Cassite, Sutaean against Sutaean, Kuthaean against Kuthaean, Lullubite against Lullubite, Country against country, house against house, man against man. Brother is to show no mercy towards brother; they shall kill one another.
The lines remind one of the description in the Gilgamesh
epic of the terror aroused by the deluge, 2 and one might be
tempted to combine Dibbarra's speech with the preceding
words of Ishum, and interpret this part of the Dibbarra legend as another phase of the same nature myth, which enters as a
factor in the narrative of the Deluge. However, the continua
tion of Dibbarra's speech shows that a great military conflict is
foretold. The countries named are those adjacent to Babylonia,
and the intention of the writer is evidently to imply that the
whole world is to be stirred up. This fearful state of hostility
is to continue until
After a time the Akkadian will come, Overthrow all and conquer all of them.
Akkad, it will be recalled, is a name for Babylonia. The triumph of Babylon is foretold in these lines. The Akkadian is,
therefore, none other than Hammurabi, who succeeds in obtain
ing the supremacy over the entire Euphrates Valley, and whose successors for many centuries claimed control of the four quar
ters of the world. It is evident from this '
prophecy ' that the Dibbarra legend
received its final shape under influences emanating from Babylon, precisely as we found to be the case in the * creation '
story
l Ishum. 2 See above, p. 501.

and in the Gilgamesh epic. The hostility that precedes the coming of Hammurabi points to the violence of the conflicts in
which that warrior was engaged, while the exaggeration of this
hostility shows how strong and permanent the impression of Hammurabi's achievements must have been. The designation of the conqueror as the Akkadian gives him to a certain extent
the character of a Messiah, who is to inaugurate an era of
peace, and whose coming will appease the grim Dibbarra. It is by no means impossible that Hebrew and Christian con
ceptions of a general warfare which is to precede the golden age of peace are influenced by the Babylonian legend under consideration. Dibbarra gives his consent to Ishum's plan :
Go, Ishum, carry out the word thou hast spoken in accordance with thy desire.
Ishum proceeds to do so. The mountain Khi-khi is the first
to be attacked.
Ishum directed his countenance to the mountain Khi-khi. The god Sibi,1 a warrior without rival, Stormed behind him. The warrior 2 arrived at the mountain Khi-khi. He raised his hand, destroyed the mountain. He levelled the mountain Khi-khi to the ground. The vineyards in the forest of Khashur he destroyed.
In a geographical list 3 a mountain Khi-khi, belonging to the Amoritic country, is mentioned, and a mountain Khashur described as a cedar district. There can be, therefore, no doubt
that some military expedition to western lands is recounted in our tablet. The continuation of the narrative is lost, all but a
small fragment, 4 which tells of the destruction of a city otherwise unknown called Inmarmaru. At the instigation

of Dibbarra, Ishum enters this city and destroys it. The outrages committed are described at some length. Ea, the god of
humanity, hears of the havoc wrought. He is 'filled with
wrath.' Unfortunately, the fragment is too mutilated to permit us to ascertain what steps Ea takes against Dibbarra. Marduk is also mentioned in this connection. Under the cir
cumstances, one can only conjecture that in the missing portions of this tablet, and perhaps also in two others, the wars preceding the advent of the Akkadian l are recounted in poetic
and semi-mythical form. If this conjecture is justified, the main purport at least of the Dibbarra legend becomes clear.
It is a collection of war-songs recalling the Hebrew anthology,
" Battles of Yahwe," 2 in which the military exploits of the
Hebrews were poetically set forth.
The closing tablet of the Dibbarra legend is preserved, 3
though only in part. It describes the appeasement of the
dreadful war-god. All the gods, together with the Igigi and Anunnaki, are gathered around Dibbarra, who addresses them:
Listen all of you to my words.
Because of sin did I formerly plan evil, My heart was enraged and I swept peoples away.
He tells how he destroyed the flocks and devastated the fruits
in the fields, how he swept over the lands, punishing the just and the wicked alike, and sparing no one. Ishum takes up the
strain and urges Dibbarra to desist from his wrath :
Do thou appease the gods of the land, who were angry, May fruits (?) and corn 4 flourish, May mountains and seas bring their produce.
1 Hammurabi is the conqueror of Palestine mentioned in Gen. xiv. under the
name Amraphel. See, e.g., Hommel, Altisraelitische Ueberliefcrung, p. 106. 2 Num. xxi. 14. The ' song of Deborah ' (Judges, v.) belongs to this collection.
For further specimens of Babylonian war-songs, see Hommel, ib. pp. 180-190, all dealing with the memorable Hammurabi period. 3 K. 1282, Harper, ib. pp. 432 seq., and King's fragment, Zeitschrift fiir Assyriologie, xi. 60, 61, 4 The gods of vegetation are mentioned.



MYTHS AND LEGENDS. 535
The era of peace and prosperity is thus inaugurated, and the legend closes with solemn assurances from Dibbarra that he
will bless and protect those who properly honor him.
He who glorifies my name will rule the world.
Who proclaims the glory of my power Will be without a rival.
The singer who sings [of my deeds] will not die through pestilence.
To kings and nobles his words will be pleasing. The writer who preserves them will escape from the grasp of the enemy.
In the temple where the people proclaim my name I will open his ear ;
1
In the house where this tablet is set up, though war 2 may rage,
And god Sibi work havoc, Sword and pestilence will not touch him he will dwell in safety. Let this song resound forever and endure for eternity. Let all lands hear it and proclaim my power. Let the inhabitants of all places learn to glorify my name.
This closing address represents a late addition to the poem that somewhat modifies its original import. Wars did not cease with the establishment of Babylon's control. Many con
flicts arose, but on the whole, Babylonia was an empire of peace. The people were inclined towards a life of ease, and the development of commerce served as a wholesome check
against too frequent military disturbances. The war-songs, as
a glorification of the nation's past, retained their popularity, but the lesson drawn from the songs was the great blessing that peace and freedom from turmoil brought with them. For the warlike Assyrians, Dibbarra enraged may have been a more
popular figure, but to the peace-loving Babylonian, the appeased Dibbarra appealed with greater force. The story of Dibbarra's deeds became in this way in the course of time an object
lesson, a kind of religious allegory handed down from one generation to the other as an illustration of the horrors of war and
1 /.., give wisdom to the one who honors me. 2 Text ' Dibbarra.'



536 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
of violence in general. With the tendency so characteristic
of the Babylonian religion
l for great gods to absorb the roles
of minor ones, Nergal became the god of war par excellence, while Dibbarra, Ishum, and Sibi were chiefly viewed as powers responsible for such forms of violence as pestilence and dis
tress. To ensure the favor of a god of pestilence was of
importance for every individual, and one of the safest means of obtaining this favor was to sing his praises, to recall his
power, to glorify him and thus to keep him, as it were, in good humor. What better means of accomplishing this than to have the record of his deeds constantly before one's eyes ? The British Museum contains two specimens of tablets on which a
portion of the Dibbarra legend is inscribed, and which are pierced with holes in a manner as to leave no doubt 2 that the tablets were intended to be hung up in houses with a view of
securing protection from Dibbarra and his associates. The
reference in the closing lines of the story:
The house where this tablet is set up,
thus becomes clear. As the Hebrews were commanded, in order to secure the protection of Yahwe, to write his law
On the doorposts of the house,3
so the Babylonians were instructed by their priests to hang
tablets in their homes probably at the entrance on which
Dibbarra was glorified. Naturally, it was impossible to inscribe the whole story on a little tablet, just as it was impossible to place the entire law of Yahwe on the doorposts. In both cases
a significant extract served as a part, representative of the whole. In the case of the Dibbarra legend, the closing portion
was selected, which emphasized the necessity of keeping the deeds of Dibbarra and the greatness of his power in mind.
Like the Gilgamesh epic, so the Dibbarra legend was to be

taught by the father to his son. The scribes were enjoined to
teach the story to the people. The poets were to make it the
subject of their songs, and kings and nobles were not exempt
from the obligation to listen to the tale.
THE MYTH OF THE STORM-GOD Zu.
Birds and bulls were to the Babylonians the symbols of
storms and clouds. In the Gilgamesh epic, it will be recalled, Anu sends a divine bull to engage in a contest with Gilgamesh. 1
The text of the epic being unfortunately defective, we have no definite indication of the character of the attack to be made
upon the hero by the messenger from the god of heaven ; but since storms and disease are the two chief weapons in the
hands of the gods, and inasmuch as Gilgamesh in a later sec
tion of the epic is struck down by disease, it is more than
likely that the bull represents a storm that is to sweep the hero
and his companion off the earth. The winged bulls placed at the entrance of palaces embody the same idea, and in addition
to the explanation for these fantastic figures above 2 suggested, it is noteworthy that the two types of animals chosen for this
symbolical decoration of edifices, the bull and the lion, again illustrate the same two means at the disposal of the gods for
the punishment of man, the bull representing the storms, and the lion being the symbol of Nergal, who is the god of pestilence, as well as of war and of violent destruction in general.
A storm-god symbolized under the form of a bird is Zu. The
underlying stem of the word conveys the notion of strength
and violence. How bulls came to be chosen as symbols of
storms is not altogether clear. Possibly the element of '
strength
'
formed the connecting link in the chain of the association of
ideas. In the case of birds, on the other hand, the association
is to be sought in the appearance of the clouds during a storm
i See p. 483. 2 See p. 263.



538 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
moving across the heavens like a flock of birds. In the Etana
legend, a reference occurs to Zu, who, as it would appear, is unable to escape from the control of the supreme judge Shamash. 1 Zu is there called the chief worker of evil a kind of arch satan.
A story has been found which illustrates an attempt made by
the bird Zu to break loose from the control of the sun. A
storm was viewed as a conflict between the clouds and the sun,
much as an eclipse symbolized a revolt in the heavens. The
myth represents the conflict as taking place between Zu and En-lil, the Bel of Nippur. The latter holds in his possession the tablets of fate, by means of which he enjoys supreme
authority over men and gods. Zu's jealousy is aroused, and he plans to tear these tablets from En-lil. The tablets of fate, it
will be recalled, play an important part in the Marduk-Tiamat
episode.2 Kingu the symbol of chaos, like Tiamat wears them on his breast, but he is obliged to yield them to the con
queror of Tiamat and of her brood, who replaces
' chaos ' by
' order.' This conqueror was originally Bel of Nippur, and the Zu myth in representing En-lil as holding the tablets of fate confirms the view above set forth, 3 according to which the
original Tiamat tale has been modified by the substitution of Marduk for the old Bel. But the story, while thus admitting
the legitimacy of En-liPs claim to supreme power, is yet so con
structed as to* contribute to the glory of Marduk. The attack
of the Zu-bird was suggested as the Tiamat myth by the annual storms that work such havoc in Babylonia. The forces of ' chaos ' are let loose, and an attempt is made to overthrow
the ' order ' of the world, symbolized by the tablets of fate which En-lil holds in his possession. Whoever has these
tablets is invincible. But En-lil is unable to resist the attack
of Zu. The tablets are taken away from him, and it is left for Marduk to recapture them. The tablets once in Marduk's

MYTHS AND LEGENDS. 539
possession, En-liPs supremacy comes to an end, and the triumph of Marduk is complete. To substantiate this interpre
tation of the myth, an analysis of the text is necessary. The
beginning of the story is unfortunately missing. It appears to have been devoted to a glorification of the god who controls
the fate of the universe. The second column opens as follows:
And the oracles of all the gods he determined.
From the context it is clear that Bel of Nippur is meant. Up
to this point, the myth reflects the old view according to which
it was En-lil who succeeded in overcoming Tiamat or at any
rate, in snatching the tablets of fate from the breast of Kingu.
Nippur'j god lays claim to being the one who established 'order'
in the universe. His authority could only be threatened if he were robbed of the tablets which symbolize absolute control
over the course of affairs. Zu boldly attempts this:
His eyes saw the mark of rulership,
The crown of his 1 sovereignty, the garment of his l divinity. Zu saw the divine tablets of fate. He looked at the father of the gods, the god of Bur-an-ki,2 Desire for rulership seizes hold of his heart.3 ' I will take the tablets of the gods And decree the decisions [of all the gods.'] I will establish my throne, I will proclaim laws.
I will give all orders to all the Igigi.'
Zu proceeds to the dwelling-place of En-lil and waits for a favorable moment to make an attack.
His heart was bent on the contest. With his gaze directed toward the entrance of the dwelling,4 he awaits for
the beginning of day.

540 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
As En-lil poured forth the brilliant waters, Took his seat on his throne and put on his crown, He 1 snatched the tablets of fate out of his hands,
Seized the authority the promulgation of laws. Thereupon Zu flew off and hid himself in his mountain.
On seal cylinders a god is frequently pictured pouring forth streams of water from jars placed on his shoulders. This is
generally the sun-god, but the symbol also seems to belong to other deities 2 and is appropriate to Bel of Nippur, who as the
god of the atmosphere above the earth, controls the upper wa
ters. As long as these are poured out by him, they are benefi
cent ; but once beyond his control, the blessing of rain is turned
into the curse of a deluge and storm, flooding the fields and sweeping away the habitations of men. This misfortune happens when Zu robs En-lil of the tablets by means of which law
and order are established. En-lil is powerless. The bold act of Zu causes consternation among the gods. Anu calls upon some one to pursue Zu and capture him. The bird dwells in
an inaccessible recess in the mountains, and the gods are afraid to approach his nest. The scene that ensues reminds us of the
episode of the creation epic, where Anshar calls upon Anu, Bel, and Ea in turn to subdue Tiamat.
Anu opens his mouth and speaks, Addressing the gods his children :
' Who will force Zu to submit And thus make his name great among the inhabitants of the whole world ?
'
Ramman the storm-god par excellence is first called upon by the assembled gods:
'Ramman the chief,' they cried, 'the son of Anu.' Anu communicated to him 3 the order.4 ' Go, my son Ramman, conqueror who yields to no one,
1 Zu.
2 See e.g., Ward, Seal Cylinders of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, p. 12. 3 Ramman.
4 These two lines are repeated.



MYTHS AND LEGENDS. 541
Subdue Zu with thy weapon, 1
That thy name be glorified in the assembly of the great gods. Thou shalt be without a rival among the gods thy brothers.'
Arm furthermore promises Ramman that if he triumphs, lofty shrines will be erected in his honor in many cities.
' Temples will be built in thy honor, In all quarters of the world thy cities 2 will be situated, Thy cities 3 will reach up to Ekur.4
Show thyself strong among the gods, so that thy name be powerful.'
Ramman, however, is afraid of the contest.
Ramman answered the speech, Addressing his father Anu : ' My father, who can proceed to the inaccessible mountain?
Who is there like Zu among the gods, thy children ? '
He furthermore pleads that Zu, who has the tablets of fate in
his hands, is invincible. He has the power to decree the fates
of the gods, and all must bow to his will. At this point, unfor
tunately, the text becomes defective. Anu calls upon two other gods to take up the contest with Zu. The name of one
of these is altogether lost ; the second is called Bar, 5 and is
designated as an offspring of Ishtar. Both these deities decline, answering Anu in precisely the same manner as Ramman.
What finally happens we are left to conjecture. Harper supposes that Shamash is finally called upon by Anu and accepts
the challenge. He bases this opinion upon the passage in the Dibbarra legend 7 where the serpent, appealing to Shamash, extols the sun-god's power by declaring that even Zu could not escape the net of Shamash. There are, however, grave
objections to this view. In the first place, the passage in ques

542 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
tion occurs in a defective part of the text, and Harper himself 1
is not certain of the restoration that he proposes. 2 Secondly,
if Shamash conquers Zu, we should expect the sun-god to have
the tablets of fate in his possession. Such, however, is not the
case, and the only god besides En-lil who is represented in the
religious literature of the Babylonians as holding the tablets is
Marduk. Moreover, in a hymn to Marduk, which Harper himself quotes, 3 the bird Zu is referred to as among the evil forces
captured by Marduk. In view of this, there seems no reason
to question that, in the present form of the Zu myth, Marduk was introduced as the hero, precisely as, in the present form of
the Tiamat episode, Marduk successfully carries out a deed from which the other gods shrink in fear. The theological
purport of the myth thus becomes clear. It is to account for the fact that Marduk holds the tablets which were originally
in the hands of En-lil. Marduk supplants the old Bel. In
the Tiamat episode his name is substituted for that of En-lil,
and the latter is represented as giving his consent to the trans
fer of his name to the god of Babylon. In the Zu myth, En-lil's
claim to the supreme control of the laws and fate of the uni
verse is freely acknowledged, but, En-lil being unable to resist the attack of Zu, it was left for Marduk to capture the bird and
thus acquire by his own efforts what the old Bel had lost
through lack of strength. Babylon replaces Nippur as the center of power in the Euphrates Valley, and the god of Babylon, naturally, was imbued by his worshippers with prerogatives that originally belonged to the rival god of Nippur. 4 If this view is correct, Harper's interpretation must be aban
1 See p. 400. 3 See p. 417. 2 It is quite possible that the line in question declares that Zu is in collusion with the eagle, against whom the serpent seeks the assistance of Shamash. 4 It is hardly possible that the illustration on seal cylinders mentioned by Ward,
ib. pp. 13, 14, represents the Zu bird brought before a deity for punishment; and certainly not before Shamash, who only enters into the story in so far as Marduk is a solar deity.



MYTHS AND LEGENDS. 543
doned. The Zu myth does not represent, as he supposes, an
attack upon Marduk as the symbol of the early morning sun, but upon En-lil, the Bel of Nippur, as the one who, by virtue of
having the tablets of fate in his possession, controls the laws of
the universe and fixes the fate of the gods and of mankind.
The annual rain-storm passing apparently beyond the control
of the gods is viewed as a revolt against En-lil's authority. It
is left for Marduk to reestablish order, and in return, he retains
control of the precious tablets. That the conception of Marduk
as a solar deity constitutes a factor in the myth is not, of course,
to be denied, precisely as in the Tiamat myth, the solar charac
ter of Marduk plays an important part. The sun triumphs over the storms. Rain and wind are obliged at last to yield
their authority to the former. But for the theologians of Baby
lon, the position of Marduk as the head of the pantheon was a much more important factor. The myth served to show how
Marduk came to supplant the role of the old Bel of Nippur.
Viewed in this light, the Zu myth appears in more senses than one as a pendant to the Marduk-Tiamat episode. Not
only do both symbolize the same natural phenomenon, but in
both, Bel of Nippur was originally the central figure of the pantheon, and in both Marduk replaces Bel. The Zu myth is
made to account in a somewhat more respectful, conciliatory manner for the position of Marduk as the head of the pantheon.
Instead of setting aside En-lil altogether, as was done by the
compilers of the Tiamat myth, Marduk conquers for himself the supremacy that his followers claimed for him. The con
tradictions between the two myths need not disturb us. As variant versions of a tale intended to account for one and the
same fact, the supremacy of Marduk, they may well have arisen even in the same place. Such inconsistencies as the
assumption, in the Zu version of the nature myth, that En-lil is
the original establisher of order in the world, as against the Tiamat version where Marduk snatches the tablets of fate

directly from Kingu, are inevitable when stories that arose among the people are taken in hand by theologians and modi
fied and adapted to serve doctrines developed under scholastic
influences.
THE ADAPA LEGEND.
The myths and legends that we have so far considered
including the creation and Gilgamesh epics will have illus
trated two important points : firstly, the manner in which historical occurrences were clothed in mythical form and inter
woven with purely legendary tales, and, secondly, the way in which nature myths were treated to teach certain doctrines.
The story of Gilgamesh is an illustration of the hopelessness of a mortal's attempt to secure the kind of immortal life which is
the prerogative of the gods. Popular tales, illustrative of the climatic conditions of Babylonia, serve as a means of unfolding a doctrine of evolution and of impressing upon the people a
theological system of beliefs regarding the relationship of the
gods to one another. A collection of war-songs is given a semi
mythical form, and the original purport of the collection is modified to serve as a talisman against misfortunes. In the
case of these legends it is necessary and, as we have seen, also
possible to distinguish between their original and present form and to separate the story, as in the case of the Gilgamesh epic, into its component parts. The legend that we are about to consider proves that this
process of the adaptation of popular myths begins at a very early period. The text was found on the cuneiform tablets discovered at El-Amarna in Egypt. 1 Since the El-Amarna tablets
date from the fifteenth century B.C., we have a proof of the
compilation of the legend in question at this date. The legend is again suggested by the storms which visited Babylonia, but
1 Published by Winckler and Abel, Der Thontafelfund von El-Amarna, iii. i66a, b; translated also by Harper, ib. pp. 420, 421.



MYTHS AND LEGENDS. 545
instead of a pure nature-myth, we have a tale which concerns
the relationship between the gods and mankind. In its present
form, it is an object lesson dealing with the same problem that
we came across in the Gilgamesh epic and that we will meet
again in another form, the problem of immortality. The beginning of the story, as in the case of the Zu myth, is
missing, but we are in a position to restore at least the general
context. A fisherman, Adapa, is engaged in plying his trade when a storm arises. Adapa is designated as the son of Ea.
The place where he is fishing is spoken of as f the sea.' The
Persian Gulf is meant, and this body of water (as the begin
ning of the great Okeanos) being sacred to Ea, 1 the description of Adapa as the son of Ea is a way of conveying the idea that,
like Parnapishtim, he stands under the protection of Ea. The story, like most legends, assumes a period of close intercourse
between gods and men, a time when the relationship involved
in being 'a son of a god' had a literal force which was lost to a
more advanced generation. Adapa, accordingly, is portrayed as fishing for the 'house of his lord,' i.e., for Ea. When the storm breaks loose the fisherman, though a mortal, subdues the fierce element. The storm comes from the south, the direction from which the most destructive winds came to Babylonia. The south wind is pictured, as in the Zu myth, under the form of a
bird. The wind sweeps Adapa into the waters, but, since this
element is controlled by Adapa's father, the god Ea, Adapa succeeds in mastering the south wind, and, as we learn from
the course of the narrative, in breaking the wings of the storm
bird. When the tablet becomes intelligible we find Adapa engaged in this contest with the south wind. 2
The south wind blew and drove him 3 under the water. Into the dwelling-place 4 [of the fish] it engulfs him. 'O south wind, thou hast overwhelmed me with thy cruelty (?). Thy wings I will break.'
1 See above, p. 63. 3 Adapa. 2 My rendering is given in continuous lines. The legend is in narrative, not in
poetic form. * Lit.,
' house.'



546 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
Adapa's threat is carried out.
Even as he spoke the wings of the south wind were broken. For seven days the south wind did not blow across the land.
Seven is to be interpreted as a round number, as in the
Deluge story, and indicates a rather long, though indefinite, period. Anu, the god of heaven, is astonished at this longcontinued disappearance of the south wind, and asks a mes
senger of his, who is called the god Ilabrat, for the cause. Anu
inquires:
" Why has the south wind not blown for seven days across the land ? " His messenger Ilabrat answered him :
" My lord ! Adapa, the son of Ea, has broken the wings of the south wind."
Of this god Ilabrat nothing is known. The interpretation of his name is doubtful. 1 He probably is one of the numerous local gods who was absorbed by some more powerful one and who thus came to have a position of inferior rank in the
pantheon. Anu, upon hearing the news,is enraged, and cries for *
help
'
against an interference in his domain. He denounces Adapa
in solemn assembly, and demands his presence of Ea, in whose
domain Adapa has taken refuge. The text at this point is defective, but one can gather that Ea, who constitutes himself
Adapa's protector, warns the latter, as he warned Parnapishtim. He advises him to present himself at the throne of Anu for
trial, and to secure the intervention of two gods, Tammuz and
Gishzida, who are stationed at the gate of heaven, Anu's
dwelling-place. To accomplish this, Adapa is to clothe himself in garments of mourning, and when the doorkeepers ask him the reason for his mourning, he is to answer:
. . . Two gods have disappeared from our earth, therefore do I appear thus.
1 Neither Delitzsch's suggestion ' god of dwellings ' nor Harper's ' god thou art
strong ' is acceptable.



MYTHS AND LEGENDS. 547
And when he is asked :
" Who are the two gods who have disappeared from the earth ? " Tammuz and Gishzida will look at one another ; they will sigh and speak a favorable word before Anu, and the glorious countenance of Anu they will show thee.
Tammuz and Gishzida will know that they are meant. The
mourning of Adapa will be regarded as a sign of reverence for the two gods, whose sympathy and good-will will thus be secured.
The introduction of Tammuz and Gishzida introduces a
widely spread nature-myth into the story. Gishzida is identical with Nin-gishzida, a solar deity whom we came across in the
old Babylonian pantheon. 1 Tammuz similarly is a solar deity. Both represent local solar cults. At a later period, Nin-gishzida is entirely absorbed by Ninib, but the Adapa legend affords us
a glimpse of the god still occupying an independent, though al
ready inferior, position. The Babylonian calendar 2 designates the fifth month as sacred to Gishzida, while the fourth month is
named for Tammuz. The two deities, therefore, take their
place in the systematized pantheon as symbolical of the phases of the sun peculiar to its approach to the summer solstice.
The disappearance of the two gods signifies the decline of the year after the summer solstice. Of Tammuz, the popular myth
related that it was Ishtar, 3 represented as his consort, who carried him off. Since the disappearance of Gishzida embodies precisely the same idea as that of Tammuz, it was natural that
the story should in time have been told only of the one. The annual mourning for Tammuz was maintained in Babylonia to
a very late period. The Adapa legend shows us that at one time the festival was celebrated in honor of the two related
deities. The Tammuz festival was celebrated just before the
summer solstice set in, so that the mourning was followed
1 See p. 99. 2 See p. 462. 3 See the following chapter.



548 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION,
immediately by rejoicing at the reappearance of the god whose coming heralded the culmination of vegetation.
The destructive storms take place during the winter, when
Tammuz and Gishzida have disappeared. Adapa's mourning is thus an indication of the season of the year when his encounter with the south wind took place. Since Adapa succeeds in
overcoming the destructive wind, the wintry season has passed
by. Summer is approaching. The time for celebrating both the fast and the festival of the two solar deities has arrived.
Tammuz and Gishzida, the gods of spring, accordingly stand at Adapa's side, ready to plead his cause before Anu. So much being clear, we may advance a step further in the inter
pretation of the legend. By the side of Tammuz and Gishzida, there is still a third solar deity who belongs to the spring of
the year, Marduk, who, by virtue of his later position as the head of the pantheon, sets aside his two fellows and becomes
the solar god of spring par excellence. Marduk, it will be
recalled, is commonly designated as the son of Ea, 1 and we
have seen that, apart from political considerations, the sun rising out of the ocean the domain of Ea was a factor in
this association. Adapa dwells at the sea, and is forced into
the ocean by the south wind, in the same way that the sun dips
into the great
' Okeanos '
every evening. The identification of Adapa with Marduk 2 thus becomes apparent, and as a matter
of fact the Babylonian scribes of later times 3 accepted this
identification.
The basis of the Adapa legend is, therefore, the nature-myth of the annual fight of the sun with the violent elements of nature. At the same time, other ideas have been introduced
into it, and Adapa himself, while playing the role of Marduk, is yet not entirely confounded with this god. His name is never
1 See pp. 139 seq. 2 First suggested by Zimmern.

written with the determinative for deity. Moreover, the nature
myth is soon lost sight of, in order to make room for an entirely
different order of ideas. The real purport of the legend in its
present form is foreshadowed by the further advice that Ea
offers to Adapa:
When thou comest before Anu they will offer thee food of death. Do not eat. They will offer thee waters of death. Do not drink. They will offer thee a garment. Put it on. They will offer thee oil. Anoint thyself. The order that I give thee do not neglect. The word that I speak to thee take to heart. The messenger of Anu approached. 1 ' Adapa has broken the wings of the south wind. Deliver him into my hands. . . .'
Ea obeys the order, delivers up Adapa, and everything happens as was foretold.
Upon mounting to heaven and on his approach to the gate of Anu, Tammuz and Gishzida were stationed at the gate of Anu. They saw Adapa and cried '
Help, 2 Lord ! Why art thou thus attired ? For whom hast thou
put on mourning?' 3
Adapa replies :
' Two gods have disappeared from the earth, therefore do I wear a
mourning garment.'
' Who are the two gods who have disappeared from the earth ? ' Tammuz and Gishzida looked at one another, broke out in lament. ' O Adapa ! Step before King Anu.' As he approached, Anu saw him and cried out to him : ' Come, Adapa, why hast thou broken the wings of the south wind ? ' Adapa answered Anu :
' My lord ! For the house of my lord 4 I was
fishing in the midst of the sea. The waters lay still around me, when the south wind began to blow and forced me underneath. Into the dwelling of the fish it drove me. In the anger of my heart [I broke the wings of the
south wind].'
Tammuz and Gishzida thereupon intercede with Anu on
behalf of Adapa, and succeed in appeasing the god's wrath. If

the story ended here, we would have a pure nature-myth the same myth in a different form that we encountered in the Cre
ation epic, in the Deluge story, and in the Zu legend. Adapa would be merely a designation of Marduk and nothing more.
The sun triumphs over the storms, and the only objectionable feature in the tale to a Babylonian would be the degradation involved in obliging Marduk to secure the intercession
of other gods. But this feature of itself suggests that the nature
myth has been embodied in the legend, but does not constitute
the whole of it. A second element and one entirely independent in its character has been added to the myth.
Anu is appeased, but he is astonished at Ea's patronage of
Adapa, as a result of which a mortal has actually appeared in
a place set aside for the gods.
Why did Ea permit an impure mortal to see the interior of heaven and
earth ? He made him great and gave him fame.1
The privilege accorded to Adapa appears to alarm the gods. As among the Greeks and other nations, so also the Babylonian
deities were not free from jealousy at the power and achieve
ments of humanity. Adapa, having viewed the secrets of heaven and earth, there was nothing left for the gods but to
admit him into their circle. The narrative accordingly con
tinues :
' Now what shall we grant him ? Offer him food of life, that he may eat of it.' They brought it to him, but he did not eat. Waters of life they
brought him, but he did not drink. A garment they brought him. He put
it on. Oil they brought him. He anointed himself.
Adapa follows the instructions of Ea, but the latter, it will
be recalled, tells Adapa that food and water of death will be
offered him. It is Ea, therefore, who, although the god of
humanity, and who, moreover, according to the tradition involved in the Adapa legend, is the creator of mankind, who
i I follow Zimmern's rendition of the line.



MYTHS AND LEGENDS. 551
prevents his creatures from gaining immortality. The situation is very much the same that we find in the third chapter of
Genesis, when God, who creates man, takes precautions lest mortals eat of the tree of life and * live forever.' The problem
presented by the Hebrew and Babylonian stories is the same: why should not man, who is descended from the gods, who is
created in the likeness of a god, who by virtue of his intellect
can peer into the secrets of heaven and earth, who stands
superior to the rest of creation, who, to use the psalmist's
figure, is only
* a scale lower than god,' why should he not be
like the gods and live forever ? The Hebrew legend solves
the problem in a franker way than does the Babylonian. God, while as anxious as Ea to keep man from eating of the tree of
life, cautions Adam against the act, whereas Ea practises a deception in order to prevent man from eating. That in both
tales eternal life is contained in food points again (as we have found to be the case with the Biblical narratives of Creation
and of the Deluge) to a common source for the two traditions.
Similarly the phrase 'waters of life' is a figure of speech of fre
quent occurrence in Biblical literature in both the Old and the
New Testaments. It is no argument against a common source for the Hebrew and Babylonian stories explaining how man came to forego immortality, that the waters of life should be found in the one and not in the other. If we assume with
Gunkel l that the stories embodied in the first chapters of Genesis were long current among the Hebrews before they
were given a permanent form, the adaptation of old traditions to an entirely new order of beliefs involves a casting aside of features that could not be used and a discarding of such as
seemed superfluous. The striking departures in the case of the Hebrew legends from their Babylonian counterparts are as full of significance as the striking agreements between the two. The departures and agreements must both be accounted for.
1 Schdpfung und C/iaos, pp. 168 seq.



552 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
For both there are reasons. So, to emphasize only one point, in a monotheistic solution of the problem under consideration,
there was no place for any conflict among the gods. In Genesis
God simply wills that man should not eat of the tree of life.
In the Adapa legend the gods, including Anu, are willing to grant a mortal the food and water of life, simply because they believe that Ea, the creator of man, wishes him to have it.
Accordingly, Anu and his associates are represented at the
close of the legend as being grieved that Adapa should have
foregone the privilege.
Anu looked at him l and lamented over him. ' Come, Adapa, why didst
thou not eat and not drink ? Now thou canst not live.'
Adapa replies, unconscious of the deception practised on him :
' Ea, my lord, commanded me not to eat and not to drink.'
Adapa returns to the earth. What his subsequent fate is we
do not know, for the tablet here comes to an end. It is pos
sible that he learns what Ea has done, and that the god gives
him the reason for the deception practised. A scene of this kind could not find a place in the Hebrew version that em
phasizes the supreme authority of a power besides whom none other was recognized. God acts alone.
Adam, it will be recalled, after eating of the fruit of the tree
of knowledge, makes a garment for himself. There can be no doubt that there is a close connection between this tradition
and the feature in the Adapa legend, where Adapa, who has been shown the 'secrets of heaven and earth,' that is, has
acquired knowledge, is commanded by Ea to put on the garment that is offered him. The anointing oneself with oil,
though an essential part of the toilet in the ancient and modern
Orient, was discarded in the Hebrew tale as a superfluous feature. The idea conveyed by the use of oil was the same as
i Adapa.



MYTHS AND LEGENDS. 553
the one indicated in clothing one's nakedness. Both are sym
bols of civilization which man is permitted to attain, but his
development stops there. He cannot secure eternal life.
On the other hand, in comparing the Hebrew and Babylonian versions of the problem of knowledge and immortality, one cannot help being struck by the pessimistic tone of the former as
against the more consolatory spirit of the latter. God does not
want man to attain even knowledge. 1 He secures it in dis
obedience to the divine will, whereas Ea willingly grants him
the knowledge of all there is in heaven and earth. In this
way the Hebrew and Babylonian mind, each developed the common tradition in its own way.
Leaving the comparison aside and coming back for a moment
to the Adapa story, it is interesting to observe that as we have two tales, both intended to explain the position of Marduk at
the head of the pantheon, the one by making him the conqueror of Tiamat and forcing from Kingu the tablets of fate, the other
by representing him as recovering from Zu the tablets which
En-lil, who originally held them, could not protect against the storm-bird, so we have two solutions offered for the problem of
immortality. The one in the Gilgamesh epic, where the hero is told of the plant of life, succeeds in rinding it, but as he is
about to eat the ' food ' loses his grasp upon it. The exertions
of man are in vain. True, there is Parnapishtim, a mortal who with his wife has obtained immortal life. He is the exception
that proves the rule. Moreover, it is Bel, and not Ea, who
places Parnapishtim
' at the confluence of streams,' there to live
forever, and Bel does this as a proof of his pacification, a kind
of indemnity offered to Ea for having destroyed the offspring of the god of humanity. The Adapa legend attacks the problem more seriously. Ea, the same god who has created man, endowed him with wisdom, bestowed all manner of benefits
1 The phrase ' knowledge of good and evil ' (Gen. ii. 1 7) is simply an expression equivalent to our 'everything,' or to the Babylonian ' secrets of heaven and earth.'



554 BABYLONIAN- ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
upon him, Ea, who protects humanity against Anu, against Bel, and other gods, Ea himself deceives man. Evidently the lesson
that the Babylonian theologians intended to teach through the Adapa legend was, that it was not good for man to 'live forever.'
Ea himself prevents it. That is the point of the story. Anu and the other gods are satisfied, but Ea does not desire it, and
Ea's decision cannot be to the disadvantage of mankind, so dearly beloved by him. With this conclusion humanity must
be content and be resigned to the inevitable.
Of the various legends that we have been considering, the
story of Adapa is perhaps the most significant, and none the less so for the manner in which a philosophical problem has
been grafted on to a nature-myth. Adapa is made to play the role of Marduk, and it is nothing short of remarkable that at so early a period as the one to which the existence of the story can be traced back, a nature-myth should have been diverted
from its original purpose and adapted to the end that the
Adapa story serves in its present form. The process involved
in this adaptation is a complicated- one. The story serves as an evidence of the intellectual activity displayed in the schools
of theological thought that must have flourished for many cen
turies before a story like that of Adapa could have been pro
duced out of a nature-myth. Hardly less remarkable is it that
the theologians and scribes of later times no longer understood the story, for otherwise they would not have identified Adapa with Marduk through the superficial circumstance that he is introduced into the story instead of Marduk, or some other solar
deity allied to Marduk.
The Adapa legend takes us back to the beginning of man's
career to the time when, as in the early chapters of Genesis, man stood closer to the gods than at a later time, the time when there was a constant intercourse between man and the
gods, and more especially between man and his protector, Ea. The story forms part of a stock of traditions of which we have

another specimen in the Eabani-Ukhat episode, incorporated in the Gilgamesh epic.
1 No doubt when the treasures still exist
ing in the British Museum shall have been thoroughly examined and as additional remains of the religious literature of the Baby
lonians will be brought to light, we will find further traces of
these early traditions as well as of other myths. Those that we
have discussed in this and in the preceding chapters illustrate
the system adopted by the priests in elaborating these traditions and myths and in adapting them to serve as illustrations
of certain doctrines and beliefs. We may also feel tolerably
confident that the religious ideas conveyed through these vari
ous epics and legends and myths fairly represent both the popular and the advanced thought, as it unfolded itself in the course of
time. By the aid of these specimens of the religious literature, we have been enabled to analyze the views of the Babylonians
regarding the creation of the world, its structure, and govern
ment. We have obtained an insight into the problems of life
and death which engaged the Babylonian thinkers, and we have noted some of the solutions offered for these problems. In a
consideration of the views held by the Babylonians and Assyr
ians of the life after death, to which we now turn, it will again
be a specimen of the religious literature that will serve as our
main guide.
1 See pp. 476 seq. Sayce has even gone so far as to suggest an identification of Adapa (by reading Adawa) with the Biblical Adam, but this conjecture is untenable.



CHAPTER XXV.
THE VIEWS OF LIFE AFTER DEATH.
THE problem of immortality, we have seen, engaged the serious attention of the Babylonian theologians. While the solutions they had to offer could hardly have been satisfactory either to themselves or to the masses, it must not be supposed
that the denial of immortality to man involved the total extinction of conscious vitality. Neither the people nor the leaders
of religious thought ever faced the possibility of the total annihilation of what once was called into existence. Death was
a passage to another kind of life, and the denial of immor
tality merely emphasized the impossibility of escaping the change in existence brought about by death. The gods alone do not pass from one phase of existence to the other. Death
was mysterious, but not more mysterious than life. The
Babylonian religion does not transcend the stage of belief, characteristic of primitive culture everywhere, which cannot
conceive of the possibility of life coming to an absolute end.
Life of some kind and in some form was always presupposed.
So far as man was concerned, created by some god, - Bel, Ea, Aruru, or Ishtar, according to the various traditions that were current, 1 no divine fiat could wipe out what was endowed
with life and the power of reproduction. No doubt, the impossibility for the individual to conceive of
himself as forever deprived of consciousness, was at the bottom
of the primitive theory of the perpetuity of existence in some form. Among ancient religions, Buddhism alone frees itself from this theory and unfolds a bold doctrine of the possibility
1 See above, p. 448.



THE VIEWS OF LIFE AFTER DEATH. 557
of a complete annihilation. The question, however, whether
the continuity of existence was a blessing or a curse was raised
by many ancient nations. The Babylonians are among these who are inclined to take a gloomy view of the passage from
this world to the existence in store for humanity after death,
and the religious leaders were either powerless or disinclined
to controvert this view.
LOCATION AND NAMES OF THE GATHERING PLACE OF THE DEAD.
We have already had occasion l to refer to the great cave underneath the earth in which the dead were supposed to
dwell, and since the earth itself was regarded as a mountain,
the cave is pictured as a hollow within, or rather underneath, a
mountain. A conception of this kind must have arisen among a people that was once familiar writh a mountainous district.
The settlers of the Euphrates Valley brought the belief with them from an earlier mountain home. The cave, moreover, points to cave-dwelling and to cave-burial as conditions that
prevailed at one time among the populace, precisely as the imitation of the mountain with its caves in the case of the
Egyptian pyramids, is due to similar influences. To this cave
various names are assigned in the literature of the Babylo
nians, some of popular origin, others reflecting scholastic
views. The most common name is Aralu.2 We also find the term ' house of Aralu.' 3 The etymology of the term is obscure.
Aralu was pictured as a vast place, dark and gloomy. It is sometimes called a land, sometimes a great house. The approach
to it was difficult. It lay in the lowest part of the mountain
1 See pp. 487, 489, 511, 512. 2 Or Arallu. 3 II R. 6 1 , 18. Jensen, Kosmologie, p. 220, takes this as the name of a temple ; but, since Aralu was pictured as a ' great house,' there is no reason why the designation should not refer to the nether world.



558 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
that represented the earth, not far from the hollow underneath the mountain into which the ' Apsu ' flowed. Surrounded by
seven walls and strongly guarded, it was a place to which no living person could go and from which no mortal could ever
depart after once entering it. To Aralu all went whose existence in this world had come to an end. Another name which
specifies the relationship of Aralu to the world is Ekur or ' mountain house ' of the dead. Ekur is one of the names for
the earth, 1 but is applied more particularly to that part of the mountain, also known as Kharsag 2-kurkura, />., 'the mountain of all lands ' where the gods were born. Before the later specu
lative view was developed, according to which the gods, or most of them, have their seats in heaven, 3 it was on this moun
tain also that the gods were supposed to dwell. Hence Ekur became also one of the names for temple, 4 as the seat of a god.
The dwelling of the dead was regarded as a part of the '
great mountain.' It belonged to Ekur, and the fact that it was des
ignated pimply as Ekur, 5 is a valuable indication that the dead
were brought into close association with the gods. This asso
ciation is also indicated by the later use of Aralu as the designa
tion of the mountain within which the district of the dead, Aralu
proper, lay 6 synonymous, therefore, with Ekur. We shall see in the course of this chapter that the dead are placed even
more than the living under the direct supervision of the gods.
A third name for the nether world which conveys an important addition to the views held regarding the dead, was Shualu.
Jensen, it is true, following Bertin, questions the existence of
1 See the admirable argument in Jensen, Kosmologic, pp. 185-195. 2 Or, more fully, Kharsag-gal-kurkura, '
great mountain of all lands.' 3 See above, p. 458. 4 See the following chapter.
5 See the passages in Jeremias' Die Babylonisch-Assyrischen Vorstellun^en vom Leben nach dem Todc, p. 62.
6 Sargon Annals, 1. 156. Jensen's interpretation of the passage (Kosmologie, p. 231) is forced, as is also his explanation of IIR. 51, na, where a mountain Aralu is clearly designated.



THE VIEWS OF LIFE AFTER DEATH. 559
this term in Babylonian, 1 but one does not see how the evi
dence of the passages in the lexicographical tablets can be set aside in the way that he proposes. Zimmern 2 does not appear
to be convinced by Jensen's arguments and regards the question as an open one. Jensen's method of disposing of Shualu, besides being open to serious objections, fails to account for the fact that Shualu is brought into association with various
Babylonian terms and ideographs for the grave. 3 This cannot be accidental. That the term has hitherto been found only in
lexicographical tablets need not surprise us. Aralu, too, is of rare occurrence in the religious texts. The priests appear to avoid the names for the nether world, which were of ill
omen, and preferred to describe the place by some epithet, as 1 land without return,' or ' dark dwelling,' or *
great city,' and the like. Of such descriptive terms we have a large number. 4
The stem underlying Shualu signifies 'to ask.' Shualu is a place of inquiry, 5 and the inquiry meant is of the nature of a
religious oracle. The name, accordingly, is an indication of
the power accorded to the dead, to aid the living by furnishing them with answers to questions, just as the gods furnish oracles through the mediation of the priests. 6 The Old Testament supplies us with an admirable illustration of the method
of obtaining oracles through the dead. Saul, when he desires to know what the outcome of a battle is to be, seeks out a
sorceress, and through her calls up the dead Samuel 7 and puts
1 Kosmologie, pp. 222-224. 2 Gunkel's Schopfung und Chaos, p. 154, note 5. 3 In an article on ' Shualu ' published in the American Journal of Semitic Languages (xiv.), I have set forth my reasons for accepting this word as a Babylonian term for the nether world. 4 In the later portions of the Old Testament, the use of Sheol is also avoided. See the passages in Schwally, Das Lcbcn nach dem Tode nacJi den Vorstellnngen
des Alien Israels, pp. 59, 60. 5 Not ' Ort der Entscheidung,' as Jeremias, ib. p. 109, proposes. 6 See above, p. 329. 7 1 Sam. xxviii. n.



560 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION,
the question to him. Similarly, in the Gilgamesh epic, the hero, with the aid of Nergal, obtains a sight of Eabani 1 and plies
him with questions. The belief, therefore, in this power of the dead was common to Babylonians and Hebrews, and, no doubt, was shared by other branches of the Semites. It is natural,
therefore, to find the Babylonian term Shualu paralleled by the Hebrew Sheol, which is the common designation in the Old Testament for the dwelling-place of the dead. 2 How wide
spread the custom was among Babylonians of inquiring
'
through
the living of the dead ' 3 it is difficult, in default of satisfactory
evidence, to say. The growing power of the priests as mediators between men and gods must have acted as a check to
such practices. The priests, as the inquirers, 4 naturally pro
ceeded direct to the particular god whose representative they claimed to be, and the development of an elaborate ceremonial in the temples in connection with the oracles 5 was a further factor that must have influenced the gradual abandonment of
the custom, at least as an element of the official cult. More
over, the belief itself belongs in the domain of ancestor wor
ship, and in historical times we find but little trace of such
worship among the Babylonians. We may, therefore, associate the custom with the earliest period of the Babylonian religion. This view carries with it the antiquity of the term Shualu. Like Aralu and the designation Ekur, it embodies the close association of the dead with the gods. The dead not only
dwell near the gods, but, like the gods, they can direct the
affairs of mankind. Their answers to questions put to them
have divine justification. From this view of the dead to the
1 See p. 511. 3 Isaiah, viii. 19'. 2 See Schwally, ib. pp. 59-63. 4 One of the names for the priest in Babylonia is Sha'ilu, i.e.,
'
inquirer,' and the corresponding Hebrew word Sho'el is similarly used in a few passages of the Old
Testament ; e.g., Deut. xviii. n ; Micah, vii. 3. See an article by the writer on " The Stem Sha'al and the Name of Samuel," in a forthcoming number of the Journal of the Society of -Biblical Literature. 5 See above, pp. 333 seq.



THE VIEWS OF LIFE AFTER DEATH. 561
deification of the latter is but a short step. It does not, of
course, follow, from the fact that Shualu or Sheol is the place
of '
oracles,' that all the dead have the power to furnish oracles
or can be invoked for this purpose. Correspondingly, if we
find that the Babylonians did deify their dead, it does not mean
that at one time all the dead were regarded as gods. Popular
legends are concerned only with the heroes, with the popular
favorites not with the great masses. Eabani, who appears
to Gilgamesh, is a hero, and so is Samuel. As a matter of fact,
we have so far only found evidence that the ancient rulers
whose memory lingered in the minds of the people were re
garded by later generations as gods. So the names of Dungi and Gudea l are written on tablets that belong to the centuries
immediately following their reign, with the determinative that
is placed before the names of gods. Festivals were celebrated
in honor of these kings, sacrifices were offered to them, and their
images were placed in temples. 2 Again, Gimil-Sin (c. 2500 B.C.), of the second dynasty of Ur, appears to have been deified
during his lifetime, and there was a temple in Lagash which was named after him. 3 No doubt other kings will be found
who were similarly honored. We may expect to come across a
god Hammurabi some day. Gilgamesh is, as we have seen, a historical personage whose career has been so thoroughly amal
gamated with nature-myths that he ends by becoming a solar deity who is invoked in incantations.
The tendency to connect legendary and mythical incidents with ancient rulers is part and parcel of this process of deifica
tion. Of an ancient king, Sargon,4 a story was related how he
1 See p. 167. 2 See above, p. 167, and Scheil, Le Culte de Gndca, etc. (Rcciteil dcs Travaux, xviii. 64 seg.) 3 Thureau-Dangin, Le Culle des Rois dans la pcriode Prcbabylonicnnc (Rccucil des Travaux, etc., xix. 486). 4 See above, p. 36. The text is published II I R. pi. 4, no. 7. Recently, Mr. Pinches has published a variant version of this story (Proc. Soc. Bibl. Arch, xviii.
257, 258).



562 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
was exposed in a boat, and, 'knowing neither father nor mother,' was found by a ferryman. The exploits of this king and of his
successor, Naram-Sin, were incorporated in an omen text 1 a circumstance that again illustrates how the popular fancy
connected the heroes of the past with its religious interests.
Still, there is no more reason to question the historical reality
of Sargon 2 than to question the existence of Moses, because a story of his early youth is narrated in Exodus 3 which forms a
curious parallel to the Sargon legend, or to question the existence of a personage by the name of Abraham, because an Abrahamitic cult arose that continues to the present day. 4
This close association of the dead with the gods, upon which
the deification of the dead rests, may be regarded as a legacy
of the earliest period of the Babylonian religion, of the time when the intercourse between the gods and the living was also direct. The belief and rites connected with the dead constitute the
most conservative elements in the religion of a people. The
organized cult affects the living chiefly. So far as the latter
are concerned, the rise of a priesthood to whom the religious needs of the people are entrusted, removes the living from that immediate contact with the gods which we note in the tradi
tions of every people regarding the beginnings of mankind. The priests have no power over the dead. The dead require no * mediator.' Hence, those who dwell in Aralu return to the early state of mankind when gods and mankind ' walked to
gether.' Another name that is of frequent occurrence in religious texts is Kigallu, which describes the nether world as a district
1 IVR. 34 . 2 In view of recent discussions of the subject, it is important to note that Tiele already fifteen years ago recognized that Sargon was a historical personage. See his remarks, Babyl. Assyr. Gesc/i., p. 112. 3 Chapter ii.
4 See Winterbotham, " The Cult of Father Abraham," in the Expositor, 1897, pp. 177-186.



THE I'I EM'S ()/' L1EE AFTER DEATH. 563
of great extent, situated within the earth. 1 The chief goddess
of the nether world is commonly known as the '
queen of Kigallu.' Furthermore, Irkalla, which was interpreted by the
Babylonian theologians as 'great city' (or 'district'), is used both as a designation for the dwelling-place of the dead and for the consort of the queen of Aralu. 2 Beside the names for the nether world above discussed, a
large number of epithets and metaphors are found in the reli
gious texts. The place to which the dead go is called the
* dark dwelling,' 'the land from which there is no return,'
' house
of death,' 'the great city,' 'the deep land,' and, since Nergal, the ruler of the lower world, was the patron of the city Cuthah 3
(or Kutu), the name Cuthah was also used as a designation for
Aralu. Lastly, it is interesting to note that in poetical usage the words for '
grave ' 4 were also employed to describe the
nether world. The question raised by this metaphor as to the relationship between the grave and the lower world can best be discussed when we come to consider the funeral rites.5
THE CONDITION OF THE DEAD AND THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF AN ESCAPE FROM ARALU.
Among the remains of Babylonian literature there is a remarkable production, which furnishes us with an admirable view
of the fate in store for those who have left this world.6 The com
position is based upon a nature-myth, symbolizing the change of seasons. Ishtar, the great mother goddess, the goddess of
fertility who produces vegetation, is, as we saw in the Gilga
1 See Jensen's Kosmologic, p. 215, and Meissner, Altbabylonischcs Prh>atrc<.Jit, p. 21. The word is used for the foundation of a building, and is an indication, therefore, of the great depth at which the nether world was placed.
2 See below, p. 567, and Jensen's Kosmologie, p. 259. 3 See pp. 65, 66. * Kabru and Gcgumi (' dark place'). 5 See also below, pp. 566, 567. Published IV Rawlinson (2d edition), pi. 31.



564 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
mesh epic, 1 also the one who brings about the decline of
vegetation. The change in nature that takes place after the summer solstice is passed and the crops have ripened was
variously interpreted. According to one, and, as it would
seem, the favorite, tradition, the goddess is represented as herself destroying the solar deity, Tammuz, whom she had chosen as a consort. Repentant and weeping, Ishtar passes to the lower world in search of her youthful husband, the
symbol of the sun on its approach to the summer solstice.
While Ishtar is in the lower world, all fertility ceases, in the
fields, as well as in the animal kingdom. At last Ishtar re
appears, and nature is joyous once more. In the Semitic Orient there are only two seasons :
2 winter, or the rainy season, and summer, or the dry season. The myth was, therefore, a symbol of the great contrast that the two seasons presented to one another. Under various forms and numerous
disguises, we find the myth among several branches of the
Semites, as well as in Egypt and among Aryans who came into
contact with Semitic ideas.3 A festival celebrated in honor
of Tammuz by the Babylonians is one expression of many that the myth received. The designation of the sixth month as
" the mission of Ishtar " 4 is another. This myth was adapted
by the theologians to illustrate the doctrines that were developed
regarding the kind of existence led by the dead. The literary method adopted is the same that characterizes the elaboration
of the Adapa myth and of the myths incorporated into the Gilgamesh epic. The story forms the point of departure, but its
original purport is set aside to a greater or less degree, necessary modifications are introduced, and the moral or lesson is

distinctly indicated. In the case of the production that we are
about to consider, the story of Ishtar's visit to the nether world
is told perhaps by a priest to a person who seeks consola
tion. A dear relative has departed this life, and a survivor, a
brother, apparently, is anxious to know whether the dead will
ever come back again. The situation reminds one of Gilgamesh
seeking out Eabani, 1 with this difference : that, whereas Gilga
mesh, aided by Nergal, is accorded a sight of his friend, the ordinary mourner must content himself with the answer given to
him. But what Gilgamesh is not permitted to hear, 2 the mourner
is told. A description is given him of how the dead fare in Aralu.
The problem, however, is somewhat different in the story of the descent of Ishtar, from the one propounded in the twelfth
tablet of the Gilgamesh epic. The question uppermost in the
mind of the mourner is " Will the dead return ? " The condi
tion of the dead, which is most prominent in Gilgamesh's mind, is secondary. Both questions, however, are answered, and both answers are hopelessly sad. The nether world is joyless.
Even the goddess Ishtar is badly treated upon entering it.
The place is synonymous with inactivity and decay ; and, though the goddess returns, the conclusion drawn is that the exception
proves the inexorable rule. A goddess may escape, but mortals
are doomed to everlasting sojourn, or rather imprisonment, in the r'ealm presided over by Allatu and her consort Nergal. The tale
begins with a description of the land to which Ishtar proceeds :
To the land whence there is no return, the land of darkness (?) 3 Ishtar, the daughter of Sin, turned her mind,
1 See above, p. 510. 2 I.e., according to one version (p. 511). Another version of this part of the Gilgamesh epic, which, however, is influenced by the tale of Ishtar's visit, is published in Haupt's NimrodepoS) pp. 1619. In this version Eabani gives Gilgamesh a description of Aralu, which tallies with the one found in the Ishtar tale.
8 Text defective. Jeremias' suggestion, " the land that thou knowest," misses the point. The person addressed does not know the land. ' Decay ' is Schrader's conjecture (Die Hollenfahrt der Istar, p. 24). See Haupt's Nimrodcpos, pp. 17, 40, and Delitzsch's Assyr. Worterbuch, p. 321, note.



566 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
The daughter of Sin turned her mind ;
To the house of darkness, the dwelling of Irkalla, To the house whence no one issues who has once entered it. To the road from which there is no return, when once it has been trodden. To the house whose inhabitants l are deprived of light. The place where dust is their 2 nourishment, their food clay. They 3 have no light, dwelling in dense darkness.
And they are clothed like birds, in a garment of feathers; Where over gate and bolt, dust is scattered.
Ishtar, it will be observed, is here called the daughter of the
moon-god, whereas in the Gilgamesh epic she appears as the daughter of Anu, the god of heaven. Both designations reflect the views developed in the schools, and prove that the story has been produced under scholastic influences. The goddess
has her place in the heavens, in the planet bearing her name,
and the designation of this planet as the daughter of Sin can only be understood in connection with the astronomical
system, in which the moon plays so prominent a role 4 and
becomes the father of all the great gods (except Shamash) who constitute the lesser luminaries of the night.
Irkalla is one of the names 5 for a god of the nether world,
who is regarded as the associate of Allatu. The dwelling is
elsewhere spoken of as a '
great palace
' in which Allatu and
her consort Nergal have their thrones. A gloomier place than the one described in these opening lines of the story
cannot well be imagined. The picture reflects the popular views, and up to this point, the doctrines of the school are
in agreement with the early beliefs. The description of the
lower world is evidently suggested by the grave or the cave in which the dead were laid. The reference to dust and clay as the food of the dead shows that the doctrine taught in the
Gilgamesh epic,6 of man's being formed of clay and returning

THE VIEWS OF LIFE AFTEK DEATH. 567
to clay, was the common one. This view helps us to understand how the words for grave came to be used as synonyms for the nether world. The dead being placed below the earth, they were actually conveyed within the realm of which Aralft
was a part, and since it became customary for the Babylonians
to bury their dead together, the cities of the dead that thus
arose could easily be imagined to constitute the kingdom presided over by Allatu and Nergal. At this point, however, the
speculations of the schools begin to diverge from the popular
notions. We may well question whether the Babylonian populace ever attempted to make clear to itself in what form the
dead continued their existence. It may be that the argu
ment from dreams, as the basis for the primitive belief in the continuation of life, in some form, after death has been too hard
pressed, 1 but certainly the appearance of the dead in the dreams
of the living must have produced a profound impression, and since the dead appeared in the same form that they had while alive, the conclusion was natural that, even though the body
decayed, a vague outline remained that bore the same relation
to the corpus as the shadow to the figure casting it. Two re
markable chapters in the Old Testament 2 illustrate this popu
lar view prevailing in Babylonia, as to the condition of the dead in the nether world. The prophets Isaiah and Ezekiel both
portray the dead as having the same form that they possessed while alive. The kings have their crowns on their heads ; the warriors lie with their swords girded about them. The dead
Eabani, it will be recalled, appears to Gilgamesh and is at once recognized by the latter. What distinguishes the dead from the
living is their inactivity. They lie in Aralu without doing anything. Everything there is in a state of neglect and decay. The dead can speak, but the Babylonians probably believed, like the
1 Particularly by Herbert Spencer and his followers. 2 Isaiah, xiv. 9-20, and Ezekiel, xxxii. 18-31. In Isaiah, the Babylonian Aralu is specifically described, while Ezekiel writes under the influence of Babylonian ideas.



568 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
Hebrews, that the dead talk in whispers, or chirp like birds. 1
The dead are weak, 2 and, therefore, unless others attend to their
needs, they suffer pangs of hunger, or must content themselves with ' dust and clay
' as their food. Tender care during the
last moments of life was essential to comparative well-being in Aralu. 3 The person who goes to Aralu in sorrow and neglect will continue sorrowful and neglected.
The theologians, while accepting these views in general, passed beyond them in an important particular. They could not reconcile the evident dissolution of the body with a continu
ation of even a shadowy outline. When a man died, the
'spirit,' which, according to the animistic theory, lodged somewhere within the body and produced the manifestations of life,
sought for refuge in some other substance. The ease with which birds moved from one place to another suggested these beings as the ones in which the dislodged spirit found a home. The Babylonian thinkers were not alone in developing the view that the dead assumed the form of birds. Parallels to
the pictures of the dead in the story of Ishtar's descent may be found in Egypt and elsewhere. 4 But what is important for
our purposes is the consideration that, in Babylonia at least, the view in question is not the popular one, but the result of
speculations about a problem that appeals only to those who
make the attempt, at least, to clarify their ideas regarding the mystery of death. The next section of the story affords us a picture of the entrance to Aralu :
When Ishtar arrived at the gate of the land without return, She spoke to the watchman of the gate :
Ho ! watchman open thy gate.
1 Isaiah, viii. 19. 2 The Hebrew word for 'the dead,' refaim, conveys this idea.
3 See p. 512.
* See Sara Y. Stevenson, " On Certain Symbols used in the Decoration of Some Potsherds from Daphne and Naukratis " (Philadelphia, 1892), p. 8.

Open thy gate that I may enter. If thou dost not open the gate, if thou refusest me admission, I will smash the door, break the bolt.
I will smash the threshold, force open the portals. I will raise up the dead to eat the living Until the dead outnumber the living.
The entrance to the nether world is strongly guarded. From other sources we learn that there was a *
spy ' - - perhaps identical with the watchman stationed at the portal of the lower
world, who reports all happenings to the queen Allatu through Namtar, the god (or spirit) of pestilence. The watchman is to prevent the living from entering, and also the dead from
escaping. The violence of Ishtar is an interesting touch in the narra
tive. As a goddess, she resents any opposition to her desires.
Her anxiety to enter Aralu indicates that the original form of the myth, which must have represented the descent as forced and not voluntary, has been modified by the introduction of a new factor, the search for her dead consort, Tammuz. The character of Ishtar as the goddess of war 1 may also have influ
enced this portrayal of her rage. In her violence, she threatens a conflict between the dead and the living. The former will
destroy 2 the latter, as a victorious army butchers the hostile host. The watchman endeavors to pacify the enraged Ishtar :
The watchman opened his mouth and spoke. Spoke to the great Ishtar :
Hold, O mistress, do not destroy them. 3 I will go and mention thy name to the queen Allatu.
Allatu is grieved upon hearing the news of Ishtar's arrival, for Ishtar's disappearance from the world means death.

I must weep for the masters who forsake their consorts. I must weep for the wives who are torn from their husbands' side. For the children I must weep who are snatched away (?) before their time. Go, watchman, open thy gate. Deal with her according to the ancient laws.
The scene that follows embodies, again, views of the nether
world as developed in the schools. Corresponding to the seven
zones surrounding the earth, 1 the nether world is pictured as
enclosed by seven gates. Through these Ishtar must pass, before she is ushered into the presence of Allatu.
The watchman went and opened his gate.
Enter, O mistress, welcome in Cuthah.2 The great house 3 of the land without return greets thee.4 Through the first gate he led her, and boldly removed the great crown from her head. Why, O watchman, dost thou remove the great crown from my head?
Enter, O mistress, such are the laws of Allatu.
At the second gate, he removes the earrings of the goddess ;
at the third, her necklace is taken away, and, similarly, at each
succeeding gate, a portion of her dress, the ornaments on her
breast, her belt of precious stones, her bracelets, until, when the seventh gate is reached, the covering over her loins is removed, and she stands naked before Allatu. At each gate Ishtar asks the same question, why the watchman strips her, and the same answer is given. The removal of one ornament after the other symbolizes,
evidently, the gradual decay of vegetation, not, as has been supposed, that the dead enter Aralu naked.
Allatu calls upon her messenger, Namtar, to strike the
goddess with disease in all parts of her body. The disease

THE VIEWS OF LIFE AFTER DEATH. 571
expresses the same idea as the removal of the ornaments,
decay of strength. There follows a description of the desola
tion on earth during Ishtar's sojourn with Allatu. Productivity
comes to a standstill.
The ox does not mount the cow, the ass does not bend over the she-ass.
Among mankind, likewise, fertility ceases. The gods lament the absence of Ishtar and the fate that overtook her. The
astronomical conception of Ishtar as the planet Venus, at this
point, is apparent. The gods complain.
Ishtar has descended to the earth, and has not come up.
As a planet, Ishtar's seat is in the heavens. The disappearance of the planet has been combined with the nature-myth of the
decay of vegetation. As the evening star, Venus dips down into the west, to reappear after a long interval in the east. The
astral character of Ishtar dominates the latter half of the story
in its present form. It is not the goddess of love and fertility nor the goddess of war who is rescued from her prison by Ea, but the planet Ishtar. Shamash is informed of the disaster
by his servant, Pap-sukal. 1 The sun-god proceeds for aid to Sin and Ea. The latter furnishes relief. The sun enters Ea's
domain every evening, and, since it is in the west that the
planet sinks like the sun, the association of ideas becomes
apparent which suggests Ea as the savior and the sun as the mediator.
Ea created in his wisdom a male being. He formed Uddushu-namir, a divine servant. Go, Uddushu-namir, to the gate of the land without return, turn thy face. The seven gates of the land without return will be opened before thee. Allatu will see thee and welcome thee

Invoke against her the name of the great gods. Raise thy countenance, to Sukhal-ziku direct thy attention. Come, mistress, grant me Sukhal-ziku, that I may drink l therefrom.
Ea appears here again in the role of Creator. 2 The name of
the mysterious being created by Ea signifies
' renewal of light.'
The incident, it will be seen, is wholly symbolical. A touch of mysticism has also been introduced. Sukhal-ziku is a com
pound of a word meaning ' to sprinkle
' and another which may mean *
grotto.' 3 Sukhal-ziku appears, therefore, to be the name for a mysterious fountain, the waters of which restore the dead
to life.
Uddushu-namir having pronounced the name of the gods
before Allatu, and haying thus secured their aid, his request is in the nature of an order. But the request must not be inter
preted literally, as though the waters were intended for him. It is for the sake of Ishtar that he desires to have the use of Sukhal-ziku. Allatu understands Uddushu-namir's speech in
this sense, and is enraged at the order to yield up Ishtar.
Allatu, upon hearing this, Smote her sides and bit her finger.4 Thou hast demanded of me a request that should not be requested. Come, Uddushu-namir, I will curse thee with a terrible curse. Food from the gutters of the city be thy nourishment. The sewers (?) of the city be thy drink. The shadow of the wall be thy seat. The threshold be thy dwelling. Exile and banishment break thy strength.
The force of the curse lies in the closing words. Uddushu
namir is to be an outcast. He will not be permitted to enter

either city or house, but must remain at the wall or stop at
the threshold. Properly prepared food and drink are to be
denied him. He shall starve or perish miserably. But the mission of Uddushu-namir has been accomplished. Allatu may curse as she pleases ; the order of Ea must be
obeyed.
The goddess Allatu opened her mouth and spoke. To Namtar, her messenger, she addressed an order : Go, Namtar, smash the true palace. 1 Break down the threshold, destroy the door-posts (?) . Bring out the Anunnaki and place them on golden thrones. Besprinkle Ishtar with the waters of life and take her from me.
Namtar obeys the order. Ishtar is led through the seven
gates. At each one, the articles taken 'from her on her en
trance are returned : at the first, the loin cloth ; at the second,
the bracelets and ankle rings, and so on, until she emerges in
her full beauty. The close of the story thus brings to our gaze once more
Ishtar as goddess of fertility, who gradually brings vegetation, strength, and productivity back again. This curious mixture in the story of the astral Ishtar, the creation of the astronomers,
and the popular Ishtar, is a trait which shows how the old
nature-myth has been elaborated in passing through the hands
of the literati. The various steps in the process can still be
seen. In the original form, the goddess must have been forced
into an exile to the nether world, the exile symbolizing the
wintry season when fertility and productivity 2 come to an end. Ishtar is stripped of her glory. She comes to Allatu, who
grieves at her approach, but imprisons her in the '
great house,'
1 See Delitzsch, Assyr. Worterbuch, p. 341. 2 So far as the domestic animals are concerned, it is true that they throw off their young in the spring. The reference to a similar interruption in the case of mankind
(see above, p. 571) may embody the recollection of a period when a regular pairing season and breeding time existed among mankind. See Westermarck, The History
of Human Marriage, pp. 27 seq.



574 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
and refuses to yield her up, until forced to do so by order of the
gods. A similar story must have been told of Tammuz, the
sun-god, who is also the god of vegetation. The two stories were combined. Ishtar marries Tammuz, and then destroys
him. The goddess produces fertility, but cannot maintain it. Tammuz goes to the nether world. Ishtar repents, bewails her loss, and goes to seek for her consort and to rescue him. In rage she advances to Allatu, threatens to smash the door and break the lock unless admitted. The story in this form must
have ended in the restoration of Tammuz. The identification of Ishtar with the planet Venus introduced a new factor. The
disappearance of the planet fitted in well with the original nature-myth. The combination of the Ishtar-Tammuz story with this factor resulted in the tale as we have it now. The
enraged Ishtar is the one who seeks for her consort. The Ish
tar who is forced to give up her ornaments is the old goddess
who falls into the hands of Allatu. During her absence, pro
duction comes to a standstill; decay sets in. The Ishtar who is rescued by Ea through the mediation of the * Renewal of
Light ' is the astral Ishtar, as developed by the astronomers, and, finally, the Ishtar who receives her ornaments back again and comes to the upper world, is once more the goddess of
vegetation, rescued from her exile to new glory. Up to this
point, Tammuz has not been mentioned in the story. In the
advice, however, that is given at the conclusion of the tale to
mourners, the consort of Ishtar is introduced.
If she J will not grant her redemption, 2 turn to her 3 [thy countenance ? ]
To Tammuz, her youthful consort, Pour out pure waters, costly oil [offer him?].
The mourners are furthermore instructed to institute a formal
lamentation. The Ukhati, 4 the priestesses of Ishtar, are to

sing dirges; flutes are to accompany the song. The thought intended, apparently, to be conveyed is that if Allatu will not give up the dead, the surviving relatives should endeavor to secure the good grace of Ishtar and Tammuz, who succeeded
in subduing Allatu.
The closing lines are rendered obscure by a reference to the
goddess Belili, who appears to be the sister of Tammuz. The reference assumes the knowledge of a tale in which the god
dess was represented as breaking a costly vessel adorned with
precious stones, in sign of her grief for the lost Tammuz. Suitable mourning for Tammuz, therefore, will secure the sympathy of Belili also. The story thus ends with a warning to all who mourn for their dead to remember Tammuz, to observe
the rites set aside for the festival celebrated in his honor.
Bearing in mind the tentative character of any interpretation
for the closing lines, we may mention Jeremias' * supposition that it is a deceased sister who addresses her sorrowing brother
at the end of the story.
My only brother, let me not perish.
On the day of Tammuz, play for me on the flute of lapis lazuli, together with the lyre 2 of pearl play for me.
Together let the professional dirge singers, male and female, play for me, That the dead may arise and inhale the incense of offerings.
The lines impress one as snatches from a dirge, sung or recited in memory of the dead, and introduced here as an
appropriate illustration of the conclusion to be drawn from the
tale. At all events, the consolation that the mourner receives lies in this thought, the dead can hear the lamentation.
The survivors are called upon not to forget the dead. When the festival of Tammuz comes, let them combine with the
weeping for the god, a dirge in memory of the dead. Let them pray to Ishtar and Tammuz. If remembered by the

living, the dead will at least enjoy the offerings made to them,
regain, as it were, a temporary sense of life ; but more cannot
with certainty be hoped for. The outlook for the dead, it will be seen, is not hopeful. Their condition is at best a tolerable one. What we may glean from other sources but confirms the general impression, con
veyed by the opening and closing lines of the Ishtar story, or makes the picture a still gloomier one. The day of death is a
day of sorrow,
' the day without mercy.' The word for corpse conveys the idea that things have 'come to an end.' Whenever death is referred to in the literature, it is described as an
unmitigated evil. A dirge introduced into an impressive hymn to Nergal l laments the fate of him who
. . . has descended to the breast of the earth, Satiated,2 [he has gone] to the land of the dead. Full of lament on the day that he encountered sorrow, In the month which does not bring to completion the year,3
On the road of destruction for mankind,
To the wailing-place (?), The hero [has gone], to the distant invisible land.
We must not be misled by an epithet bestowed upon several
gods, Marduk, Ninib, and Gula, of 'the restorer of the dead to life,' into the belief that the dead could be brought back
from Aralu. These epithets appear chiefly in incantations and
hymns addressed to the gods for some specific purpose, such as deliverance of a sufferer from disease. The gods are
appealed to against the demons, whose grasp means death. Ninib and Gula are viewed as gods of healing.4 To be cured
through their aid was to be snatched from the jaws of death.
Moreover, Ninib and Marduk, as solar deities, symbolize the sun of spring, which brings about the revivification of nature.

' Shamash has made him great.' 3 /.., the month in which one dies. 4 See p. 175.



THE VIEWS OF LIFE AFTER DEATH. 577
The return of vegetation suggests the thought that Ninib and Marduk have filled with new life what appeared to be dead. The trees that seemed entirely dead blossom forth ; the bare earth is covered with verdure. Similarly, the suffering individual stricken with disease could be awakened to new life. It is this
' restoration ' which lies in the power of the gods, but once a
man has been carried off to Aralu, no god can bring him back to this earth.
An apparent exception to the rule, according to which all mankind eventually comes to Aralu, is formed by Parnapishtim and his wife, who dwell in a place vaguely described as 'distant,' situated at the 'confluence of the streams.' The
place, as was pointed out in a previous chapter, 1 lies in the vicinity of the Persian Gulf, and, since it can only be reached by water, the natural conclusion is that it is an island. The
temptation is strong to compare the dwelling of Parnapishtim with the belief found among the Greeks and other nations, of
'an island of the blessed.' This has been done by Jeremias 2
and others. However, we must bear in mind that the point
in Parnapishtim's narrative is that he and his wife do not die.
They are removed to the distant place by the gods and con
tinue to live there. Again, we do not learn of any other person who inhabits this island. If to these considerations we
add, that the name Parnapishtim signifies
'
offspring of life,' that his wife's name is not mentioned, that we are not told
what becomes of his family and servants, who are also saved from the deluge, it is evident that the incident of Parnapishtim's
escape is an allegory, introduced into the story as a dramatic means of teaching the doctrine which we have seen dominates the tale, that man, ordinarily, cannot secure immortal life. If there is any connection between the island where Parna
pishtim dwells and the Greek conception of ' an island of the
blessed,' it is a trace of foreign influence in Babylonian mythol
1 See pp. 505, 506. 2 Vorstellungen, p. 81.



578 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
ogy. There is nothing to show that among the Babylonians, either among the populace or in the schools, a belief arose in a
'
paradise ' whither privileged persons were transported after death, nor is any distinction made by them between the good and the bad, so far as the future habitation is concerned. All
mankind, kings and subjects, virtuous and wicked, go to Aralu. Those who have obtained the good will of the gods receive
their reward in this world, by a life of happiness and of good
health. The gods can ward off disease, or, rather, since disease
(as all ills and misfortunes) is a punishment sent by some god or demon, forgiveness can be secured, the proof of which will consist in the restoration of the sick to health, but the moment
that death ensues the control of the gods ends. To the Baby
lonians, the words of the Psalmist, 1 " who praises thee, O God,
in Sheol ? " came home with terrible force. They expressed, admirably, the Babylonian view of the limitations of divine
power. The dead do not praise the gods, simply because it would be useless. The concern of the gods is with the living.
We are fortunate in possessing a pictorial representation of the nether world that confirms the view to be derived from a
study of the religious literature. A number of years ago, Clermont-Ganneau directed attention to a remarkable bronze tablet which was purchased at Hamath in northern Syria.
2 The art
was clearly Babylonian, and there was no reason to question
the genuineness of the production. Quite recently a duplicate has been found at Zurghul, in Babylonia, 8 so that all suspicions are removed. The bronze tablet contains on the one side, the
figure of a monster with a lion-like face and body, but provided
with huge wings. Standing erect, his head rises above the tablet, his fore legs rest on the edge, and the demon is thus

represented in the attitude of looking over to the other side of
the tablet. At the side of the monster, are two heads of
hideous appearance. The illustrations on the reverse are devoted to a portrayal
of a funeral ceremony, and of the general aspects of the nether
world. There are five distinct divisions, 1 marked off from one
another by four heavy lines drawn across the tablet. In the
first division appear the symbols of the chief gods of the
Assyrian pantheon, Marduk, Nabu, Sin, Ishtar, Shamash, Ramman, etc. 2 These gods, as inhabiting the heaven, are placed at the head of the tablet. Next come seven evil spirits figured
as various animals, 3 who, as inferior to the gods, and perhaps
also as messengers of the latter, are assigned a place midway between heaven and earth. In the third section, there is pic
tured the funeral ceremony proper. A dead body lies on a
couch. Two rather strange figures, but apparently priests, have taken up a position, one at each end of the funeral bier,
performing some rite of purification. One of the priests has a robe of fish scales and is bearded ; the other is smooth-faced
and clothed in a long garment. Censers are placed near the
priests. The latter appear at the same time to be protecting
the body against two demons whose threatening gestures suggest that they are endeavoring to secure possession of the dead. 4 These demons may be the special messengers of the gods of the nether world, who have brought about the death of their victim. Below this scene, we come to a view of the nether
world. The division is much larger than any of the others. Two hideous figures dominate the scene, both of fantastic
1 Only four on the Zurghul duplicate. 2 For the interpretation of these symbols, see Luschan, Ansgrabiingcn in Sendschirli, pp. 1 7-27, and Scheil's article. On the Zurghul tablet there are eight symbols, while the other contains nine. 3 See pp. 263, 264. A text IVR. 5, col. i. compares each of the seven spirits to some animal. On the duplicate six demons are placed in the second division and the seventh in the third. 4 On the duplicate these two demons do not occur.

shape, and evidently so portrayed as to suggest the horror of the nether world. One of these figures l stands erect in a
menacing attitude ; the other is resting in a kneeling position on a horse. 2 The second figure is a representation of the chief
goddess of the nether world Allatu. The demon at her side
would then be the special messenger of this goddess, Namtar. The goddess has her two arms extended, in the act of stran
gling a serpent. The act symbolizes her strength. Her face is that of a lioness, and she is suckling two young lions at her
breasts. If it be recalled that Nergal, the chief god of the
lower world, is also pictured as a lion, 3 it seems but natural to conclude that the monster covering the one side of the tablet is none other than the consort of Allatu, the heads on
either side of him representing his attendants. At the left side
of Allatu are a series of objects, a jar, bowl, an arrowhead (?),
a trident, which, as being buried with the dead, are symbols of the grave. The goddess and the demon at her side direct
their gaze towards these objects. The nether world reaches down to the Apsu, the 'deep' that flows underneath the earth. This is indicated in the design
by placing the horse, on which the goddess rests, in a bark.
The bark, again, is of fantastic shape, the one end terminating in the head of a serpent, the other in that of some other animal,
perhaps a bull. The bark reaches into the fifth division, 4
which is a picture of flowing water with fish swimming from the left to the right, as an indication of the direction in which the water flows. At the verge of the water stand two trees. 5 What
these trees symbolize is not known, and there are other details
in the third and fourth sections that still escape us. For our
purposes, it is sufficient to note : (a) that the sections represent
in a general way the divisions of the universe, the heavens, the

atmosphere, the earth, the nether world, and the deep ;
l
(//)
that the nether world is in the interior of the earth, reaching
down to Apsu; and (V) that this interior is pictured as a place
full of horrors, and is presided over by gods and demons of
great strength and fierceness. Such being the view of the nether world, it is natural that
the living should regard with dread, not only the place but also its inhabitants. The gloom that surrounded the latter reacted
on their disposition. In general, the dead were not favorably disposed towards the living, and they were inclined to use what
power they had to work evil rather than for good. In this
respect they resembled the demons, and it is noticeable that an important class of demons was known by the name ekimmu, which is one of the common terms for the shades of the dead. This
fear of the dead, which is the natural corollary to the reverence
felt for them, enters as an important factor in the honors paid
by the living to the memory of the deceased. To provide the
dead with food and drink, to recall their virtues in dirges, to
bring sacrifices in their honor, such rites were practised, as much from a desire to secure the favor of the dead and to
ward off their evil designs as from motives of piety, which, of
course, were not absent. The dead who was not properly
cared for by his surviving relatives would take his revenge upon
the living by plaguing them as only a demon could. The demons that infested graveyards were in some way identified with the '
spirits,' or perhaps messengers, of the dead, who, in their anger towards the living, lay in wait for an attack upon
those against whom they had a grudge.
1 Scheil questions whether the divisions have this purpose. While perhaps not much stress is laid by the artist upon this symbolism, its existence can hardly be questioned. Note the five divisions of the universe in Smith's Miscellaneous Texts,
p. 16. The water certainly represents the Apsu. Allatu rests upon the bark. We do not find among the Babylonians (as Scheil supposes) the view that the dead are conveyed across a sheet of water to the nether world. The dead are buried, and by virtue of this fact enter Aralu, which is in the earth. Egyptian influence is possible,
but unlikely.

THE PANTHEON OF ARALU.
We have seen how the mystery coupled with death led to
the view which brought the dead into more direct relationship
with the gods. Closely allied with this view is the power
ascribed to the dead to work evil or good and, like the gods,
to furnish oracles. This power once acknowledged, it was but
a short step to the deification of the dead, or, rather, of such
personalities who in life exercised authority, by virtue of their
position or innate qualities. On the other hand, the gloominess of the nether world, the sad condition of its inhabitants, the
impossibility of an escape or a return to this world, necessarily suggested to the Babylonians that the gods worshipped by the living had no control over the fate of the dead. The gods, to
be sure, were at times wrathful, but, on the whole, they were well disposed towards mankind. When angry, they could be
pacified, and it was impossible to believe that they should
deliberately consign their creatures to such a sad lot as awaited those who went down to Aralu. The gods who ruled the dead must be different from those who directed the fate of
the living. A special pantheon for the nether world was thus
developed. Such deities as Marduk, Ea, Nabu, Shamash, or Ashur, who acted, each in his way, as protectors of mankind, could find no place in this pantheon ; but a god like Nergal, who symbolized the midday sun, and the sun of the summer solstice that brought misery and fever to the inhabitants of the
Euphrates Valley; Nergal, who became the god of violent destruction in general, and, more particularly, the god of war, the god whose emblem was the lion, who was cruel and of for
bidding aspect, such a god was admirably adapted to rule those who could only look forward to a miserable imprisonment
in a region filled with horror. Nergal, therefore, became the
chief god of the pantheon of the lower world.



THE VIEWS OF LIFE AFTER DEATH. 583
In the religious texts, the cruel aspects of this god are almost
exclusively emphasized. He is the one god towards whom no love is felt, for he is a god without mercy. The fierce aspects
of the solar Nergal are accentuated in Nergal, the chief of the
pantheon of Aralu. He becomes even more ferocious than he
already was, as a god of war. His battle is with all mankind. He is greedy for victims to be forever enclosed in his great and gloomy domain. Destruction is his one and single object ;
nothing can withstand his attack. Armed with a sword, his
favorite time for stalking about is at night, when he strikes his
unerring blows. Horrible demons of pestilence and of all manner of disease constitute his train, who are sent out by
him on missions of death. The favorite titles by which he is
known appear in a hymn l addressed to him, as god of the
lower world. He is invoked as the
Warrior, strong whirlwind, sweeping the hostile land,2 Warrior, ruler of Aralu.
Another hymn 3 describes him as a
Great warrior who is firm as the earth. Superior as heaven and earth art thou,
What is there in the deep that thou dost not secure? What is there in the deep that thou dost not clutch ?
While references to the local character of the god as patron
of Cuthah survive, the name Cuthah itself becomes synonymous with the nether world. The old solar deity is completely overshadowed by the terrible ruler of the lower world. It is due to
this that the real consort of the local Nergal, the goddess Laz,
is not mentioned in the religious literature. The priests, when
they spoke of Nergal, had in mind always the companionship with Allatu. But the association of ideas which thus led to assign
1 IVR. 26, no. i. 3 IVR. 30, no. i ; obverse 5, 14. 2 /.., the nether world.



584 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
ing a god who was originally a solar deity, a place in the lower world bears the impress of the schools. The popular development of Nergal ceased, when he became the local god of Cuthah.
It is only as an outgrowth of the systematized pantheon that we can understand the transformation involved in making of a
local deity, the head of a pantheon that is itself an outcome of
the later phases assumed by the religion.
The problem suggested by this transformation was recognized
by the theologians. A curious tale was found among the ElAmarna tablets which endeavors to account for Nergal's pres
ence in the world of the dead. Unfortunately, the tablet on
which the story is inscribed is so badly mutilated that we can
hardly gather more than the general outlines. 1 A conflict has arisen between the gods on high and a goddess who has her seat in the lower world. This goddess is none other than
Allatu. She is described as Eresh-Kigal, 2
/>., queen of Kigal or of the nether world. The scene reminds us of the contest
between the gods and Tiamat, as embodied in the creation epic.
The gods choose Nergal as their leader. Assisted by fourteen
companions, whose names 'fever,' 'fiery heart,' 'lightning sender ' remind us again of the eleven monsters that constitute
Tiamat's assistants, 3 Nergal proceeds to the lower world, and knocks at the gate for admission. Namtar, the plague-demon,
acts as the messenger. He announces the arrival of Nergal to
Allatu. The latter is obliged to admit Nergal, just as in the story
of Ishtar's descent, she is forced to receive Ishtar. Fourteen gates of the lower world are mentioned. At each one, Nergal
stations one of his companions and passes on to the house of
1 See Jensen's valuable articles, " The Queen in the Babylonian Hades and her Consort," in the Sunday School Times, March 13 and 20, 1897.

Allatu. He seizes the goddess, drags her from her throne, and
is about to kill her when she appeals for mercy. She breaks
out in tears, offers herself in marriage if Nergal will spare her.
You shall be my husband and I will be your wife. The tablets of wisdom I will lay in your hands. You shall be master and I mistress.
Nergal accepts the condition, kisses Allatu, and wipes away her tears.
One cannot resist the conclusion that the tale is, as already
suggested, an imitation of the Marduk-Tiamat episode. Allatu is a female like Tiamat. Nergal acts for the gods just as Marduk does. The attendants of Nergal are suggested by the monsters
accompanying Tiamat ; the tables of wisdom which Nergal re
ceives, correspond to the tablets of fate which Marduk snatches from Kingu. 1 But while the conflict between Marduk and
Tiamat is an intelligible nature-myth, symbolizing the annual rainstorms that sweep over Babylonia, there is no such interpretation possible in the contest between Nergal and Allatu. The
story is not even a glorification of a local deity, for Nergal appears solely in the role of a solar deity. The attendants
given to him heat, lightning, and disease are the popular traits in the story ; but with the chief characters in the old
nature-myth changed, Marduk or the original Bel replaced by Nergal, and Tiamat by Allatu, the story loses its popular aspect, and becomes a medium for illustrating a doctrine of the schools. If this view of the tale be correct, we would incident
ally have a proof (for which there is other evidence) that as
early as the fifteenth century, the Marduk-Tiamat story had
already received a definite shape. But the most valuable con
clusion to be drawn from the Nergal- Allatu tale is that, accord
ing to the popular conceptions, the real and older head of the
pantheon of the lower world was a goddess, and not a god.
1 See p. 428.



586 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
Allatu takes precedence of Nergal. In the story of Ishtar's
descent to the lower world, a trace of the earlier view survives.
Allatu is introduced as the ruler of the lower world. Nergal
plays no part. Viewed in this light, the design of the tale we have just discussed becomes still more evident. It was incon
sistent with the prominence assigned to male deities in the
systematized pantheon, that the chief deity of the lower world should be a female. Allatu could not be set aside, for the
belief in her power was too strongly imbedded in the popular mind ; but a male consort could be given her who might rule
with her. Another factor that may have entered into play in
the adaptation of the Marduk-Tiamat story to Nergal and
Allatu, and that gave to the adaptation more plausibility, was the disappearance of the summer sun after he had done his
work. Nergal did not exert his power during the whole year, and even as the sun of midday, he was not in control all day. When he disappeared, there was only one place to which he could go.
As of Tammuz and of other solar deities, 1 it was probably related of Nergal, also, that he was carried to the lower world.
This popular basis for the presence of Nergal in the lower world may have served as a point of departure for the scholas
tic development of Nergal. However, the tale of Nergal and Allatu goes far beyond the length of popular belief in making Nergal conquer Allatu, and force himself, in a measure, into
her place. Before Nergal appears on the scene, a god, Ninazu, was regarded as the consort of Allatu. 2
The conception which gives the Babylonian Hades a queen as ruler is of popular origin, in contrast to the scholastic aspect
of Nergal as the later king of the lower region. Jensen is of the opinion that the feminine gender of the word for earth in
Babylonian superinduced the belief that the ruler of the kingdom
1 See below, p. 5 2 See below, p. 590



THE VIEWS OF LIFE AFTER DEATH. 587
situated within the earth was a woman. Allatu would, accord
ing to this view, be a personification of the ' earth.' But a factor
that also enters into play is the notion of productivity and fer
tility which gave rise to the conception of the great mother
goddess, Ishtar. 1 Allatu is correlated to Ishtar. From the
earth comes vegetation. The origin of mankind, too, is traced to the earth, and to the earth mankind ultimately returns. 2
Hence, the receiver of life is a goddess equally with the giver of life, and indeed, Ishtar and Allatu are but the two aspects of one
and the same phenomenon.3 Allatu signifies
'
strength.' The name is related to the Arabic Allah and the Hebrew Eloah and
Elohim. The same meaning strength, power, rule attaches to many of the names of the gods of the Semites : Adon, Etana,
Baal, El, and the like.4 It is interesting to note that the chief
goddess of Arabia is Allat? a name identical with our Allatu. The bronze relief above described furnished us with a pic
ture of this queen of the lower world. The gloom enveloping
the region controls this picture. Allatu is of as forbidding an aspect as Tiamat. She is warlike and ferocious. When enraged, her anger knows no bounds. Her chief attendants are
the terrible Namtar and a scribe also a female known as
Belit-seri. Of these two personages, Namtar, the personification of disease, is a popular conception, whereas the addition
of a scribe points again to the influence of the schools. Mar
duk, the chief god of the living, has a scribe who writes down,
at the god's dictation, the fate decreed for individuals. Corre
sponding to this, the ruler of the lower world has a scribe who
writes down on the tablets of wisdom the decrees of the god

bian A Hat resembles Ishtar rather than Allatu, points again to the original identity

588 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
dess, and, at a later stage, the decrees of Nergal as well. Belit
seri, whose name signifies
' mistress of the field,' was originally
a goddess of vegetation, some local deity who has been reduced to the rank of an attendant upon a greater one ; and it is significant that almost all the members of the nether-world pan
theon are in some way connected with vegetation.
Tammuz, of whose position in this pantheon we have
already had occasion to speak, is the god of spring vegetation. Another solar deity, Nin-gishzida, 1 who is associated in the
Adapa legend with Tammuz, is the deity who presides over the growth of trees. En-meshara, who also belongs to the
court of Nergal and Allatu, appears to represent vegetation in general. To these may be added Girra (or Gira), who orig
inally, as it would appear, a -god of vegetation, is eventually identified with Dibbarra, 2 Gil, whom Jensen 3 regards as 'the god of foliage,' and Belili, the sister of Tammuz.4 Of this group of
deities, Tammuz and Nin-gishzida are the most important. In the Adapa legend, it will be recalled, they are stationed as
guardians in heaven. As solar deities, they properly belong there. Like Nergal, they have been transferred to the nether
world ; and in the case of all three, the process that led to the
change appears to have been the same. The trees blossom, bear fruit, and then decay ; the fields are clothed in glory, and
then shorn of their strength. The decay of vegetation was popularly figured as due to the weakness 5 of the god who produced the fertility. Tammuz has been deceived by Ishtar ; Nin-gishzida has been carried off to the lower world. In the month of Tebet, the tenth month, there was celebrated a
festival of mourning for the lost En-meshara. It is the time of
the winter solstice. A similar fate must have overtaken Belit

THE VIEWS OF LIFE AFTER DEATH. 589
seri, Girra, and Gil. For a time, at least, they are hidden in the realm of Allatu. Of all these deities, stories were no doubt current that formed so many variations of one and the same
theme, symbolizing their disappearance and the hoped-for return, the same story that we encounter in the myth of Venus and
Adonis, in the myth of Osiris, and, in some guise or other, among many other nations of the ancient world. Of Girra, it may be
well to remember that he is viewed merely as a form of Nergal
in the later texts. Belili, it will be recalled, is associated with
Tammuz in the story of Ishtar's journey. 1 She is not, how
ever, the consort of the god, but his sister. The antiquity of her cult follows from the occurrence of her name in the list of gods antecedent to Anu, 2 and where Alala is entered as her
consort. Whatever else the relationship of ' sister ' to Tam
muz means, it certainly indicates that Belili belongs to the
deities of vegetation, and it may be that she will turn out to be
identical with Belit-seri, which is merely the designation of some goddess, and not a real name.3 One is inclined also to
suspect some, albeit remote, connection between Alala, the consort of Belili, and the Alallu bird who is spoken of in the
Gilgamesh epic as having been deprived of her pinions by Ishtar. 4 In the tale, Tammuz, the Alallu bird, a lion, and a horse are successively introduced as those once loved and then de
ceived by Ishtar. The lion is, as has been several times indi
cated, the symbol of Nergal ; the horse appears in the Hades relief above described as the animal upon which Allatu is seated,
and it seems legitimate, therefore, to seek for Alallu also in the
i See p. 574. 2 See p. 417. 8 Cheyne (Expository Times, 1897, pp. 423, 424) ingeniously regards Belili as the source of the Hebrew word Beliyaal or Belial, which, by a species of popular etymology, is written by the ancient Hebrew scholars as though compounded of two Hebrew words signifying
' without return.' The popular etymology is valuable as confirming the proposition to place Belili in the pantheon of the lower world. From
its original meaning, the word became a poetical term in Hebrew for ' worthless,'
'
useless,' and the like, e.g., in the well-known phrase " Sons of Belial."
4 See p. 482.



590 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
nether world. While it may be that a long process intervened,
before such a species of symbolization was brought about as
the representation of an ancient deity in the guise of a bird,
still, if it will be recalled that Zu is a deity, pictured as a bird, 1
there is every reason to interpret the bird Alallu merely as the
symbol of some deity, just as the lion is certainly such a symbol. Jensen would add Etana to the list of gods of vegetation
who form part of Allatu's court. While the etymology he pro
poses for the name is not acceptable, there is no doubt that to
Etana, like Gilgamesh, the character of a solar deity has been
imparted. His presence in the nether world is due to the story
of his flight with the eagle and the fall. 2 If he falls from
heaven, he naturally enters the realm of Allatu, and it is possible that the story in its original form was suggested by a myth illustrating the change of seasons. The question, however, must for the present remain an open one.
A god associated with the nether world who again appears
to be a solar deity is Nin-azu. His name points to his being
'the god of healing.' A text states 3 that Allatu is his con
sort. Such a relationship to the chief goddess of the nether
world may be regarded as a survival of the period when Nergal had not yet been assigned to this place. The introduction of
a distinctly beneficent god into the pantheon of the lower world,
and as second in rank, shows also that the gloomy concep
tion of the lower world was one that developed gradually.
Tammuz, Nin-gishzida, and the like are held enthralled by Allatu, and remain in the nether world against their will ; but if Allatu chooses as her consort a 'god of healing,' she must
have been viewed as a goddess who could at times, at least, be actuated by kindly motives. The phase of the sun symbolized
by Nin-azu is, as in the case of Tammuz and others, the sun
of the springtime and of the morning. If it be recalled that
1 See p. 537. 3 II R. 59; reverse 33-35. 2 See above, p. 523.



Tin-: VIEWS OF /.///; AVTEK DKATII. 591
Gula, the great goddess of healing, is the consort of Ninib, 1 it will be clear that Nin-azu must be closely related to Ninib
and is, indeed, identified with the latter. 2 With Nergal in con
trol, Nin-azu had to yield his privilege to be the husband of
Allatu. The substitute of the fierce sun of the summer sol
stice for the sun of spring is a most interesting symptom of the
direction taken by the Babylonian beliefs, regarding the fate of the dead. It may be that in the earlier period, when more
optimistic views of Aralu were current, Gula, who is called the
one ' who restores the dead to life,' may have had a place in
the pantheon of the lower world ; not that the Babylonians at any time believed in the return of the dead, but because the living could be saved from the clutches of death. Ninib and
Gula, as gods of spring, furnished the spectacle of such a miracle in the return of vegetation. In this sense, we have
seen that Marduk, the god of spring, was also addressed as
' the restorer to life.' But while the revivification of nature con
trols the conception of gods of healing, like Nin-azu, Ninib, and Gula, the extension of the idea would lead, naturally, to the association of these gods with the ruler of the nether world, at a time when it was still believed that this ruler could be moved by appeals to loosen her hold upon those whom she was
about to drag to her kingdom. But it is important always to bear in mind that beyond this apparent restoration of the dead
to life, the Babylonians at no time went.
In the Ishtar story 3 a god Irkalla is introduced. Jeremias 4
takes this as one of the names of Allatu, but this is unlikely.
5
From other sources G we know that Irkalla is one of the names
1 See above, p. 175. 2 IIR. 57, 5ia, a star, Nin-azu, is entered as one of the names of the planet Ninib. 3 See above, p. 565. The name occurs also in Haupt's Nimrodcfos, pp. 19, 29. * Vorstellungen, p. 68. 5 The name of the goddess is written throughout the story Nin-Kigal; i.e., 'queen of the nether world.' Nin-Eresh. See p. 584, note 2. 6 Smith, Miscellaneous Texts, p. 16.



592 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
of the nether world. It is in some way connected with Uru
gal,
1
i.e.,
'
great city,' which is also a common designation for the dwelling-place of the dead. Hence, Irkalla is an epithet
describing a deity as ' the god of the great city.' The Babylonian scholars, who were fond of plays upon words, brought
the name Nergal, as though compounded of Ne-uru-gal (i.e., 1 ruler of the great city '), into connection with Uru-gal, and
thus identified Irkalla with Nergal. But, originally, some other
god must have been meant, since Allatu appears as the sole
ruler of the lower world in the Ishtar story, unless, indeed, we are to assume that the name has been introduced at a late period
as a concession to Nergal. It is more plausible that a god like Nin-azu was understood under 'the god of the great city.'
Besides these gods, there is another series of beings who belong
to Allatu's court, the demons who are directly responsible for death in the world. Of this series, Namtar is the chief and the
representative. As the one who gathers in the living to the dark abode, it is natural that he should be pictured as guardian at
the gates of the great palace of Allatu. But by the side of
Namtar stand a large number of demons, whose task is similar
to that of their chief. A text 2 calls the entire group of
demons, the demon of wasting disease, the demon of fever,
the demon of erysipelas,
3 and the like,- 'the offspring of Aralu,' 'the sons and messengers of Namtar, the bearers of destruction for Allatu.' These demons are sent out from Aralu
to plague the living, but once they have brought their victims to Aralu, their task is done. They do not trouble the dead.
The latter stand, as we have seen, under the direct control of
the gods. 4 The story of Ishtar's descent to the lower world 5 shows us
that the group of spirits known as the Anunnaki, also, belong to

THE VIEWS OF LIFE AFTER HEATH. 593
the court of Nergal and Allatu. Ramman-nirari I. already desig.
nates the Anunnaki as belonging to the earth, 1 though it is an indication of the vagueness of the notions connected with the
group that in hymns, both the Anunnaki and the Igigi are desig
nated as offspring of Anu, the god of heaven. 2 They are
not exclusively at the service of Nergal and Allatu. Bel,
Ninib, Marduk, and Ishtar also send them out on missions.
Evidently, the fact that their chief function was to injure mankind suggested the doctrine which gave them a place in the lower world with the demons. The distinction between Anun
naki and the Igigi is not sharply maintained in the religious
literature. Though Ramman-nirari places the Igigi in heaven,
it is not impossible that a later view transferred them, like the
Anunnaki, to the lower world. There were, of course, some misfortunes that were sent against mankind from on high
Ramman was a god who required such messengers as the Igigi, and besides the Igigi, there were other spirits sent out from above. But, as in the course of time the general doctrine was
developed which made the gods, on the whole, favorably inclined towards man, while the evil was ascribed to the demons 3
as occupying the lower rank of divine beings we note the
tendency also to ascribe the ills that humanity is heir to, to the
forces that dwell under the earth, to Nergal and Allatu and to those'who did their bidding. Probably, Lakhmu and Lak
hamu were also regarded, at least by the theologians, as part of Allatu's court, just as Alala and Belili 4 were so regarded.
The confusion resulting from the double position of Nergal
in the religious literature, as the deity of the summer solstice and as the chief of the nether-world pantheon, raises a doubt whether some gods who are closely associated with
Nergal are to be placed on high with the gods or have their
seats below with Nergal. Among these, three require mention
here : Dibbarra, Gibil, and Ishum. Of these, the first two
l See above, p. 185. 2 See p. 1 86. See p. 183. 4 See pp. 417, 598.



594 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
are directly identified with Nergal in the systematized pantheon, 1 while Ishum is closely associated with Nergal, or appears as the attendant of Dibbarra. 2 These gods, symbolizing
violent destruction through war and fire, are evidently related
to the Nergal of the upper world, to Nergal, the solar deity ; but in the later stages of the religion, the Nergal of the lower
world almost completely sets aside the earlier conception. It
is, therefore, likely that deities who stand so close to the terrible
god as those under consideration, were also regarded as having a position near his throne in the lower world. The pantheon of Aralu thus assumes considerable dimensions. At the same time, we observe the same tendency towards concentration of power in this pantheon as we have
seen was the case in the pantheon of the upper world. 3 As in
Babylonia there are practically only a few gods, Marduk, Nabu, Ishtar, Shamash, and Sin, who exercised considerable
control ; and, as in Assyria we find this tendency still more accentuated in the supreme rank accorded to Ashur, so in the lower world Nergal and Allatu are the real rulers. The other
gods, and, naturally, also the demons, occupy inferior posi
tions. As messengers, guardians, spies, or attendants, they
group themselves around the throne of the two rulers. A
noticeable feature, however, in the pantheon of the lower
world consists in the high position held by the consort of the
head of the pantheon. Allatu does not sink to the insignificant
rank of being merely a pale reflection of Nergal, as do the
consorts of Marduk, Shamash, Ashur, and the like.4 As a
trace of the earlier supreme control exercised by her, she con
1 Jensen's Kosmologie, pp. 483, 484. In the new fragment of the Deluge story discovered by Scheil (referred to above, p. 507, and now published in the Recucd dc Travaux, xix. no. 3) the word di-ib-ba-ra occurs, and the context shows that it means 'destruction.' In view of this, the question is again opened as to the reading of the name of the god of war and pestilence. The identification of this god with Girra
(pp. 528, 588) may belong to a late period. 3 See pp. in, 171, 190. 2 See p. 529. 4 See chapter v.



THE VIEWS OF LIFE AFTER DEATH. 595
tinues to reign with her husband. In the popular mind, indeed,
despite the influence of theological doctrines, Allatu continues
to be more prominent than Nergal. Nergal is obliged to abide by the compact he made with Allatu. He rules with her, but not over her. The theology of the schools did not venture to
set Allatu aside altogether ; and this limitation in the develop
ment of the doctrine that elsewhere gave the male principle the supremacy over the female, may be taken as a valuable indication of the counter-influence, exercised by deeply rooted
popular beliefs, over the theoretical elaboration of the religion
at the hands of the religious guides.
THE TOMBS AND THE BURIAL CUSTOMS.
Our knowledge of the customs observed by the Babylo
nians and Assyrians in disposing of their dead leaves much
to be desired. Most of the graves discovered in the ruins of
Babylonian cities belong to the Persian or to the Greek
period. In some cases, 1 where we have reason to believe that
older graves have been found, it is almost impossible to esti
mate their age. Recently, the expedition of the University of Pennsylvania to Nippur has unearthed remains that appear to
belong to an older period, though nothing can be dated with any degree of certainty earlier than 2500 B.C. 2
Still, with
proper caution, even the material belonging to a later period may be used for the older periods. Burial customs, as has already been emphasized, constitute the most conservative elements in
a religion. Such rites are much less liable to change than the
cult of the gods. Foreign invasion would not affect the funeral rites, even where other religious customs are altered. Even so violent a change as that produced by the introduction of Mohammedanism into Mesopotamia has not removed traces of the

old Babylonian religion. Dr. Peters has shown that the district
in the Euphrates Valley selected by the modern Arabs and Persians for the interment of their dead l derives its sanctity from
the days of the old Babylonian kingdom, and many of the customs observed by the modern Moslems tally with the funeral rites
of ancient Babylonia.2 That the dead were always buried, and
that cremation was practically unknown, may now be regarded as certain. The conception of Aralu, which, we have seen, belongs to the most ancient period of religion, is only intelli
gible upon the assumption that burial was the prevailing custom. On one of the oldest monuments of Babylonian
art, the stele of vultures, earth-burial is represented.3 A few years ago, some German scholars 4 claimed to have
furnished the proof that the Babylonians cremated their
dead. But, in the first place, the age of the tombs found by them was not clearly established ; and, secondly, it was not certain whether the charred remains of human bodies were
due to intentional burning or accidental destruction by fire, at
the time that the city explored by the German scholars
was destroyed. The fact that, as the explorers themselves
observed, the bodies were not completely burned argues in favor of the latter supposition. The explanation offered by Koldewey 5 for this peculiar condition of the remains that
the burning was symbolical, and, therefore, not complete is
unsatisfactory in every particular. There can be no doubt that some, at least, of the tombs discovered at Warka by Loftus 6
belong to the period before the conquest of the country by Cyrus, and this is certainly the case with many of the tombs
discovered at Nippur. Nowhere do we find traces of burning

of bodies. 1 If it should turn out that cremation prevailed for a
certain period, the fashion, we may feel certain, was due to
foreign influences, but it is more than questionable whether it was ever introduced at all. Certainly, earth-burial is the char
acteristically Babylonian (and general Semitic) method of disposing of the dead.
The characteristic feature of the Babylonian tombs is their
simplicity. The dead body, which was often covered with
palm woods, was placed generally on the side though occasionally on the back on a board of wood, or wrapped in a mat of reeds or palm fibers, and covered with a tub-shaped clay dish. On the dish there was frequently an ornamental
design, but beyond this, there was no attempt at decoration.
The body was frequently pressed together in order to be brought within the compass of the dish. Sometimes, the knees were
pulled up or the body placed in a semi-sitting posture, and there are indications that the bodies were often divided into
two or three parts prior to burial. On the stele of vultures, 2
representing the triumph of Eanna-tuma over his enemies, attendants are seen building a mound over the symmetrically
arranged bodies of the king's soldiers slain in battle. The
monument belongs to the most ancient period of Babylonian
history, and we are justified, therefore, in regarding this method of earth-burial as the oldest in vogue. The dead, it would
seem, are placed on the ground, or near the surface, and covered with a mound. This custom would account for the
use of a dish to cover the body, after it became customary to place the dead in small houses or vaults built for the purpose.
The shape of the dish, or tub, recalls the earth-mound over the
dead, and the tenacity of conventional methods is apparent in
the modern custom, even among Western nations, of raising a

mound over the grave, even though the body is placed at a
depth of six feet and more below the surface. A modification
of the form of coffin was the jar into which the body was forced.
To do this, still greater violence had to be employed. Instead of
one jar, two were also used, the body placed partly in one, partly in the other, and the two were then joined with bitumen. In
the Persian period, a slipper-shaped coffin was used, into which the body was inserted through an aperture at one end ; but there
is no evidence that the Babylonians employed this method.
With the bodies, various objects were interred, many of which
had a special significance. Except, perhaps, at a very early period 1 the dead were not buried naked, but covered with a
garment. The seal cylinder, which, as Herodotus tells us, 2
every person of position carried about his person, and which, when impressed on a clay tablet, served as his signature, was buried with the dead as an ornament that had a personal value. The staff which the man was in the habit of
carrying is found in the grave, and also such weapons as arrow
heads and spears. Various ornaments of copper, iron, gold, and stone, rings, necklaces or bands of gold were probably placed with the dead as a sign of affection, not because of any
belief that the deceased needed these objects. Toys, too, are found in the graves, and we may assume that these were placed
in the tombs of children. The frequent presence of shells in
the tombs is still unexplained. On the other hand, remains
of food, dates, grain, poultry, and fish, that have been found
in graves belonging to various periods, may be regarded as a proof for the existence of the belief that the dead could
suffer pangs of hunger. The closing lines of the Gilgamesh epic, 3 where the fate of the neglected dead is portrayed, confirms this view. But such remains are more frequent in the
early graves than in those of a later time. Animal sacrifices at

the grave appear to be very old. 1 Offerings of food and water were made to the dead, not only at the time of the burial,
but afterwards by surviving relatives. The son performs the
office of pouring out water to the memory of his father. 2 The
close of the legend of Ishtar's journey suggests that the fes
tival of Tammuz was selected as an 'All-Souls' day. The
weeping for the lost Tammuz served as an appropriate link
for combining with the mourning for the god the lament for the dead. The water jar is never absent in the old Baby
lonian tombs, and by the side of the jar the bowl of clay or bronze is found, and which probably served the same purpose
as a drinking utensil for the dead. How early it became cus
tomary to bury the dead together we do not know. It may be that at one time they were buried beneath the dwellings that they occupied when alive, under the threshold or in the walls; 3
but the conception of Aralu as a great gathering-place of the dead would hardly have arisen, unless the f
city of the dead ' by the side of the '
city of the living
' had become an established
custom. We are, therefore, justified in assuming that as the
villages grew into towns, the huddling together of the living suggested placing the dead together in a portion of the town set aside for the purpose. In comparison with the elaborate
constructions in the Egyptian cities of the dead, the Babylonian
necropolis was a shabby affair. Vaults, rarely more than five feet high, served as the place where the dead were deposited. These vaults were constructed of bricks, and an extended series
of them gave to the necropolis the appearance of little houses,
suggestive of primitive mud huts. This simplicity, due in the first instance to the lack of stone as building material in Baby
lonia, corresponded to the very simple character which the

dwelling-house retained. The one-story type of dwelling, with
simple partitions, prevailed to the latest period. It was only in the temples and palaces that architectural skill was developed.
In Assyria, although soft stone was accessible, the example of Babylonia was slavishly followed. It is due to this that so few
traces of private houses have been found in the Mesopotamian
explorations, 1 and the almost primitive character of the graves more primitive, by virtue of the strength of the conservative
instinct in everything connected with the dead, than the dwell
ings of the living readily accounts for their nearly complete destruction. Simple as the houses of the dead were, they were
yet carefully guarded against the invasion of air and dust ; and even after centuries of neglect the contents are found to be
perfectly dry. The explorations at Nippur show that the tub and bowl forms
of the coffin continued to be used during the period extending from Hammurabi to Nabonnedos. In later times, it would appear, the custom of placing food and drink with the dead
fell into disuse. 2 We may perhaps find that, as was the case in
Egypt, symbolical representations of food a clay plate with the food modeled in clay took the place of the old custom.
Fewer utensils, too, are found in the graves of the later period ; but, on the other hand, ornaments increase, until, when we reach the Persian and Greek periods, mirrors are quite com
mon, and golden veils are placed over the dead, while handsome
earrings, breastpins, and necklaces indicate the growth of this
luxurious display. The clay coffins, too, are beautifully glazed
and ornamented with elaborate designs. A trace of foreign perhaps Graeco- Egyptian influence may be seen in the human
head modeled on the coffin. Naturally, at all times the differ
ent ranks occupied by the dead involved more or less modifica
tions of the prevailing customs. The rich were placed in more

THE VIEWS OF LIFE AFTER DEATH. 601
carefully built vaults than the poor. The coverings and ornaments varied with the station of the deceased ; but in general it
may be said that, during the earlier periods of Babylonian
Assyrian history, simplicity was the rule, and the objects placed in the tombs were more carefully chosen with reference to the needs of the dead and the career that he led while living, while
the tendency in later times was away from the religious beliefs
that gave rise to the funeral customs, and in the direction of
luxury and display. This development, however, is independent of proper burial, upon which, as we have already had occasion to see, great stress was at all times laid. The greatest
misfortune that could happen to a dead person was for his body to remain overground, or to be removed from the tomb and
exposed to the light of day. In the early monument of Babylonian art, the ' stele of vultures,' l already referred to, the
dead foes are punished by being stripped of their clothing and exposed to the attack of vultures, who are seen carrying off
human heads, legs, and arms. To emphasize the contrast, the
king's soldiers are portrayed as being buried in symmetrical rows, the head of each body being covered by the feet of the
body in the row above. When the Babylonian and Assyrian kings wish to curse the one who might venture to destroy the
monuments set up by them, they know of nothing stronger than to express the hope
That his body may be cast aside,
No grave be his lot.2
The kings punished their enemies by leaving their bodies to
rot in the sun, or they exposed them on poles as a warning to rebels. Ashurbanabal on one occasion speaks of having scattered the corpses of the enemy's host 'like thorns and
thistles ' over the battlefield. 3 The corpses of the Babylo

nians who had aided in the rebellion against the king were
given
' to dogs, swine, to the birds of heaven, to the fish of
the sea ' as food. 1 The same king takes pleasure in relating
that he destroyed the graves of Elamitic kings and dragged the bodies from their resting-place 2 to Assyria. Their shades, he adds, were thus unprotected. No food could be tendered
them and no sacrifices offered in their honor. Sennach
erib, after he has crushed a rebellion that broke out in Baby
lonia, takes a terrible revenge upon the instigator of the opposition, Mardukbaliddin, by removing the bodies of the latter's ancestors from the vaults wherein they were deposited. The bones of an enemy are enumerated by Ashurbanabal among the spoil secured by him. 3 The mutilation of the dead
body was also a terrible punishment to the dead,4 and we are
told that the person who disturbed a grave is not to be per
mitted to enter the temple. The desecration of the grave affected not only the individual whose rest was thus disturbed,
and who, in consequence, suffered pangs of hunger and other miseries, but reached the survivors as well. The unburied or disentombed shade assumed the form of a demon, 5 and afflicted
the living. Of the ceremonies incidental to burial, the bronze tablet above described affords us at least a glimpse. The dead were
placed on a bier and wrapped in some kind of a cover. Priests
were called in to perform rites of purification. One of the
priests, it will be recalled, 6 is clad in a fish costume. The
fish is the symbol of Ea, the god of the deep, who becomes

On one of the sculptured slabs from the palace of Ashurbanabal, a pyramid of heads is portrayed. The cutting off of the hands, the lips, the nose, and the male organ, as well as the flaying of the skin, were also practised. (See Sennacherib's account IR. 42, col. vi. 11. 1-6 ; Rassam Cylinder (Ashurbanabal), ii. 4 and iv. 136.) 4 Rassam Cylinder, col. vii. 11. 46-48. 5 ekinimu. See p. 580. 6 See p. 578.

the chief deity appealed to in incantations involving the use
of water. The priest assumes the role of Ea, as it were, by
the symbolical dress that he puts on. The rites appear to
consist of the burning of incense and the sprinkling of water. It does not of course follow that everywhere the same custom
was observed, but we may at least be certain that the priest
played an important part in the last honors paid to the dead. The purification was intended to protect the dead from the evil
spirits that infest the grave. The demons of disease, it is true, could no longer trouble him. They had done their work as messengers of Allatu. But there were other demons who were greedy for the blood and flesh of the dead. Though the dead
had passed out of the control of the gods, the latter had at
least the power to restrain the demons from disturbing the
peace of the grave. In the earlier days, when the bodies were placed on the
ground or only a short distance below it, the building of the
grave-mound was a ceremony to which importance was attached. In the stele of vultures, attendants are portrayed
perhaps priests with baskets on their heads, containing the earth to be placed over the fallen soldiers. 1 These attendants
are bare to the waist. The removal of the garments is prob
ably a sign of mourning, just as among the Hebrews and other Semites it was customary to put on the primitive loin-cloth 2 as
a sign of grief. In somewhat later times, we find sorrowing
relatives tearing their clothing 3 originally tearing off their clothing and cutting their hair as signs of mourning.
1 Heuzey offers another explanation of the scene which is less plausible. (See De Sarzec, Dccouvcrtes en Chaldcc, p. 98.) 2 Hebrew word Sak. The other rite of mourning among the Hebrews, the putting of earth on the head (e.g., I Sam. iv. 12; II Sam. i. 2 and xv. 32; Neh. ix. i), is a survival of the method of burial as portrayed in the ' stele of vultures.' The earth was originally placed in a basket on the head and used to cover the dead body. 3 The mourning garb mentioned in the Adapa legend (p. 546) is probably a ' torn ' garment.



604 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
The formal lament for the dead was another ceremony upon
which stress was laid. It lasted from three to seven days. 1
The professional wailers, male and female, can be traced back
to the earliest days of Babylonian history. Gudea speaks of them. 2 It would appear that at this early period persons were
engaged, as is the case to this day in the Orient, to sing dirges in memory of the dead. 3 The function is one that belongs
naturally to priests and priestesses ; and, while in the course of time, the connection with the temple of those who acted as wailers became less formal, it is doubtful whether that connec
tion was ever entirely cut off. The '
dirge singers, male and female,' referred to in the story of Ishtar's journey 4 were in
the service of some temple. The hymns to Nergal 5 may be
taken as samples of the Babylonian dirges. The praise of Nergal and Allatu was combined with the lament for the sad fate of the dead. Gilgamesh weeping for
his friend Eabani 6 furnishes an illustration. Gilgamesh is described as stretched out on the ground. The same custom is
referred to in the inscriptions of Cyrus, 7 and it is interesting to note that a similar mode of manifesting grief still prevails in the modern Orient. In the Babylonian dirges, it would seem, the references to the virtues of the deceased (which are
prominently introduced into the dirges of the present day) were few. The refrain forms a regular feature of these dirges,
an indication that, as is still the case in the Orient, there
was a leader who sang the dirge, while the chorus chimed in
at the proper moment. The principle of the stanza of two
lines, one long and one short, that, as Budde has shown, 8 controls the wailing songs in the Old Testament (including the

Book of Lamentations, which is based upon this very custom
of lamenting the dead), may be detected in the Babylonian compositions. The accompaniment of musical instruments to
the dirges also appears to be a very old custom in Babylonia. In the story of Ishtar's journey the wailers are called upon to strike their instruments. What kind of instruments were used in ancient times we do not know. In the Assyrian period, the
harp and flute appear to be the most common. 1 At the time that food and drink were placed with the dead in the grave, some arrangements must have been made for renewing the nourishment. Entrances to tombs have
been found, 2 and Koldewey 8 is of the opinion that the clay drains found in quantities in the tombs, served as wells to
secure a supply of fresh water for the dead. The wailing
for the dead took place not only immediately after death,
but subsequently. Ashurbanabal speaks of visiting the graves of his ancestors. He appears at the tombs with rent
garments, pours out a libation to the memory of the dead, and
offers up a prayer addressed to them. We have every reason
to believe that the graves were frequently visited by the survivors. The festival of Tammuz became an occasion 4 when
the memory of those who had entered Aralu was recalled. While there are many details connected with the ceremonies for the dead still to be determined, what has been ascertained
illustrates how closely and consistently these ceremonies followed
the views held by the Babylonians and Assyrians regarding the life after death. Everything connected with death is gloomy. The grave is as dark as Aralu ; the funeral rites consist of
dirges that lament not so much the loss sustained by the living as the sad fate in store for the dead. Not a ray of sunshine
1 In Egypt at present the tambourine is used to accompany the dirges (Lane, ib. p. 278). 4 See above, p. 575. 2 Peters' Nippur, ii. 173, and elsewhere.

606 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
illumines the darkness that surrounds these rites. All that is
hoped for is to protect the dead against the attack of demons
greedy for human flesh, to secure rest for the body, and to
guard the dead against hunger and thirst. It is almost startling to note, to what a degree the views embodied in Old Testament writings regarding the fate of the
dead, coincide with Babylonian conceptions. The descriptions of Sheol found in Job, in the Psalms, in Isaiah, Ezekiel, and elsewhere are hardly to be distinguished from those that we
have encountered in Babylonian literature. For Job, 1 Sheol is
The land of darkness and deep shadows. The land of densest gloom and not of light. Even where there is a gleam, there it is as dark night.2
The description might serve as a paraphrase of the opening lines in the story of Ishtar's journey. The Hebrew Sheol is
situated, like the Babylonian Aralu, deep down in the earth. 3
It is pictured as a cavern. The entrance to it is through gates
that are provided with bolts. Sheol is described as a land filled
with dust. Silence reigns supreme. It is the gathering-place of all the living, without exception. He who sinks into Sheol
does not rise up again.
He does not return to his house. His place knows him no more.4
It is, clearly,
' a land without return,' as the Babylonians conceived it. . The condition of the dead in Sheol is sad, precisely
as the Babylonians pictured the life in Aralu. The dead are
designated by a name 5 that indicates their weak condition.
They can only talk in whispers or they chirp like birds. Their

THE VIEWS OF LIFE AFl'ER DEATH. 607
gait is unsteady. In general, they are pictured as lying quiet, doomed to inactivity. Death is lamented as an evil. The dead have passed out of the control of Yahwe, whose concern is with
the living. Yahwe's blessings are meted out in this world, but
not in Sheol. These blessings consist chiefly of long life and
plenty of offspring. The dead need not praise Yahwe. Eccle
siastes although a late composition expresses the old popular view in the summary of the fate of the dead, 1 when it is
said that the dead know nothing of what is going on. Their
memory is gone; they neither love nor hate, and they are devoid of any ambition. There is no planning, no wisdom, no
judgment in Sheol. Like the Babylonians, the Hebrews also believed that the
condition of the individual at the time of death was an index
of the condition in store for him in Sheol. He who goes to
Sheol in sorrow is pursued by sorrow after death. Jacob does not want to go down to Sheol in sorrow, 2 because he knows
that in that case sorrow will be his fate after death. To die
neglected by one's family was fatal to one's well-being in Sheol.
Life in Sheol was a continuation, in a measure, of the earthly existence. Hence, the warrior is buried with his weapons ;
the prophet is recognized by his cloak ; the kings wear their crowns ; the people of various lands are known by their dress. 8
Even deformities, as lameness, follow the individual into the grave. On the other hand, while the dead were weak and
generally inactive, although capable of suffering, they were also regarded by the Hebrews as possessing powers superior to those of the living. As among the Babylonians, the dead stand so close to the higher powers as to be themselves
possessed of divine qualities. Schwally aptly characterizes this apparent contradiction by saying
' that the dead are
Refa'im (weak), but, at the same time, Elohim, i.e., divine

608 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
beings.' l Yahwe has no power over the dead, but they receive some of his qualities. They are invoked by the living. The dead can furnish oracles, precisely as Yahwe can. They not
only appear to the living in dreams, but their shades can be
raised up from Sheol. A certain amount of worship was cer
tainly paid to the dead by the ancient Hebrews.
Naturally, these popular views were subjected to considerable modification with the development of the religion of the Hebrews. While many features remained, as is shown by the occurrence
of the primitive conception of Sheol in comparatively late productions, in one important particular, more especially, did the spread of an advanced ethical monotheism lead to a complete
departure from the Babylonian conceptions. While, in the popular mind, the belief that there was no escape from Sheol
continued for a long time, this belief was inconsistent with the
conception of a Divine Being, who, as creator and sole ruler of
the universe, had control of the dead as well as the living.
As long as Yahwe was merely one god among many, no exception was made ofSthe rule that the concern of the gods was with the living ; but Yahwe as the one and only god, could not
be pictured as limited in his scope. He was a god for the dead, as well as for the living. The so-called song of Hannah 2 expresses the new view when it praises Yahwe as the one ' who kills and restores to life, who leads to Sheol, and who can lead
out of it.' Such a description of Yahwe is totally different
from the Babylonians' praise of Ninib, Gula, or Marduk as the ' restorer of the dead to life,' which simply meant that these
gods could restrain Allatu. The power to snatch "the individual from' the grasp of Sheol was also ascribed to the national god,
Yahwe. Elijah's restoration of the widow's child 3 to life is an
instance of this power, and Jonah,4 who praises Yahwe for

having delivered him when the gates of Sheol already seemed bolted, may not have had anything more in mind than what the
Babylonians meant ; but when the Psalmist, to indicate the universal rule of Yahwe, exclaims
If I mount to heaven, thou art there, If I make Sheol my couch, thou art there,1
the departure from the old Hebrew and Babylonian views of the limitation of divine power is clearly marked. The inconsistency between the view held of Yahwe and the limitation of
his power was not, however, always recognized. Hence, even in late portions of the Old Testament, we find views of the life
after death that are closely allied to the popular notions pre
vailing in the earlier productions. It is not, indeed, till we reach a period bordering close on our era that the conflict between the old and the new is brought to a decided issue in
the disputes of the sects that arose in Palestine. 2 The doctrines
of retribution and of the resurrection of the dead are the inevi
table consequences of the later ethical faith and finally triumph ; but the old views, which bring the ancient Hebrews into such
close connection with the Babylonians, left their impress in the vagueness that for a long time characterized these doc
trines, even after their promulgation. The persistency of the old beliefs is a proof of the strong hold that they acquired, as
also of the close bond uniting, at one time and for a long period,
Hebrews and Babylonians. What applies to the beliefs regarding the dead holds good also for the rites. Many a modern
Jewish custom 3 still bears witness to the original identity of the
Hebrew and Babylonian methods of disposing of and ca.ring for the dead.

610 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
There is but one explanation for this close agreement, the
same explanation that was given for the identity of traditions regarding the creation of the world, and for the various other
points of contact between the two peoples that we have met with. When the Hebrew clans left their homes in the
Euphrates Valley, they carried with them the traditions, beliefs, and customs that were current in that district, and which they
shared with the Babylonians. Under new surroundings, some new features were added to the traditions and beliefs, but the
additions did not obscure the distinctive character impressed
upon them by Babylonian contact. We now know that relations with Babylonia were never entirely broken off by the Hebrews. The old traditions survived all vicissitudes. They
were adapted to totally changed phases of belief, but the kernel still remained Babylonian. Beliefs were modified, new
doctrines arose ; but, with a happy inconsistency, the old was embodied in the new. Hence it happens, that in order to
understand the Hebrews, their religion, their customs, and even their manner of thought, we must turn to Babylonia. Further discoveries beneath the mounds of Mesopotamia
and further researches in Babylonian literature will add more evidence to the indebtedness of the Hebrews to Babylonia. It will be found that in the sacrificial ordinances of the Penta
teuch, in the legal regulations, in methods of justice and
punishment, Babylonian models were largely followed, or, what is an equal testimony to Babylonian influence, an opposition to Babylonian methods was dominant. It is not strange that when by a curious fate, the Hebrews were once more carried back to the '
great river of Babylon,' l the people felt so thoroughly at home there. It was only the poets and some ardent patriots

who hung their harps on the willows and sighed for a return to

outstripped that of Palestine. 1 The finishing touches to the
structure of Judaism were given in Babylonia on the soil where the foundations were laid.
1 The Talmud of Babylonia, and not the Talmud of Palestine, became the authoritative work in the Jewish Church.



CHAPTER XXVI.
THE TEMPLES AND THE CULT.
THE religious architecture of Babylonia and Assyria is of interest chiefly as an expression of the religious earnestness of rulers and people, and only in a minor degree as a manifesta
tion of artistic instincts. The lack of a picturesque building
material in the Euphrates Valley was sufficient to check the
development of such instincts. Important as the adaptation of the clay soil of Babylonia for simple construction was for the
growth of Babylonian culture, the limitations to the employment of bricks as a building material are no less significant. Ihering
has endeavored to show 1 by an argument that is certainly brilliant and almost convincing, that the settlement of Semites in a
district, the soil of which could be so readily used to replace
the primitive habitations of man by solid structures, made the Semites the teachers of the Aryans in almost everything that
pertains to civilization. House-building produced the art of measuring, led to more elaborate furnishings of the habitation, created various trades, introduced social distinctions, necessi
tated divisions of time, and gave the stimulus to commercial
intercourse. But, on the other hand, the artistic possibilities of brick structures were soon exhausted. The house could be
indefinitely extended in length and even height, but such an extension only added to the monotonous effect. With clay as
a building material, so readily moulded into any desired shape, and that could be baked, if need be, by the action of the sun without the use of fire, it was almost as easy to build a large house as a small one. But the addition of rooms and wings
and stories which differentiated the house from the palace
1 Vorgeschichte der. Indo-Enropacr, pp. 126-141.



THE TEMPLES AND THE CULT. 613
and the palace from the temple, served to make hugeness the
index of grandeur. The best specimens of the religious architecture of Babylonia and Assyria are characterized by such
hugeness. A proportionate increase of external beauty could only be secured by a modification of architectural style ; but
the conservative instincts of the people discouraged any devia
tion from the conventional shapes of the temples, which appear
indeed to have been firmly established long before the days of
Hammurabi. The influence of conventionality finds a striking
illustration in the manner in which the temples of Assyria follow Babylonian models. Soft and hard stone suitable for
permanent structures was easily procured in the mountainous
district adjacent to Assyria. The Assyrians used this material for statues, altars, and for the slabs with which they decorated
the exterior and interior walls of their great edifices. Had
they also employed it as a building material, we should have had the development of new architectural styles ; but the
Assyrians, so dependent in everything pertaining to culture upon the south, could not cut themselves loose from ancient
traditions, and continued to erect huge piles of brick, as the homage most pleasing in the eyes of their gods. The Book of Genesis characterized the central idea of the Babylonian and
Assyrian temples when it represented the people gathered in the valley of Shinar that is, Babylonia as saying :
' Come, let us build a city and a tower that shall reach up to heaven.' l
The Babylonian and Assyrian kings pride themselves upon the height of their temples. Employing, indeed, almost the very same phrase that we find in the Old Testament, they boast of having made the tops of their sacred edifices as high as
' heaven.' 2 The temple was to be in the literal sense of the

614 BAB YL ONIAN-ASS YRIAN RELIGION.
word a 'high place.' But, apart from the factor of natural
growth, there was a special reason why the Babylonians aimed to make their sacred edifices high. The oldest temple of Baby
lonia at the present time known to us, the temple of Bel at Nip
pur, bears the characteristic name of E-Kur, * mountain house.' The name is more than a metaphor. The sacred edifices of
Babylonia were intended as a matter of fact to be imitations of
mountains. It is Jensen's merit to have suggested the explana
tion for this rather surprising ideal of the Babylonian temple. 1
According to Babylonian notions, it will be recalled, the earth is pictured as a huge mountain. Among other names, the earth is called E-Kur, f mountain house.' The popular and
early theology conceived the gods as sprung from the earth.
They are born in Kharsag-kurkura, 2 ' the mountain of all
lands,' which is again naught but a designation for the earth, though at a later period some particular part of the earth, some mountain peak, may have been pictured as the birthplace of the gods, much as among the Indians, Persians, and Greeks we find a particular mountain singled out as the one on which the
gods dwell. The transfer of the gods or of some of them to
places in the heavens was, as we saw, 3 a scholastic theory, and not a popular belief. It was a natural association of ideas,
accordingly, that led the Babylonians to give to their temples the form of the dwelling which they ascribed to their gods. The temple, in so far as it was erected to serve as a habitation for
the god and an homage to him, was to be the reproduction of the cosmic E-Kur, ' a mountain house ' on a small scale, a
miniature Kharsag-kurkura. In confirmation of this view, it
is sufficient to point out that E-Kur is not merely the name of
the temple to Bel at Nippur, but is frequently used as a designation for temple in general ; and, moreover, a plural is formed
1 Kosmologie, pp. 185-195. 2 Or Kharsag-gal-kurktira ; see p. 558. 3 See p. 458.



THE TEMPLES AND THE CULT. 615
of the word which is used for divinities. 1 In Assyria we find
one of the oldest temples bearing the name E-kharsag-kurkura, 2 that stamps the edifice as the reproduction of the ' mountain
of all lands'; and there are other temples that likewise bear
names 3 in which the idea of a mountain is introduced.
To produce the mountain eft'ect, a mound of earth was piled up and on this mound a terrace was formed that served as the
foundation plane for the temple proper, but it was perfectly natural also that instead of making the edifice consist of one
story, a second was superimposed on the first so as to heighten the resemblance to a mountain. The outcome of this ideal
was the so-called staged tower, known as the zikkurat. The
name signifies simply a *
high '
edifice, and embodies the same
idea that led the Canaanites and Hebrews to call their temples
'
high places.' 4 The oldest zjkkiirat as yet found is the one excavated by
Drs. Peters and Haynes at Nippur, 5 the age of which can be traced back to the second dynasty of Ur about 2700 B.C. This
appears to have consisted of three stages, one superimposed on the other. There is a reference to a zikkurat in the inscriptions
of Gudea that may be several centuries older; but since beneath
the zikkurat at Nippur remains of an earlier building were
found, it is a question whether the staged tower represents the
oldest type of a Babylonian temple. At no time does any special stress appear to have been laid upon the number of stories
of which the zikkurat was to consist. It is not until a compar
atively late penbd that rivalry among the rulers and natural
ambition led to the increase of the superimposed stages until the number seven was reached. The older zikkurats were

imposing chiefly because of the elevation of the terrace on
which they were erected, and inasmuch as the ideal of the
temple is realized to all practical purposes by the erection of a
high edifice on an elevated mound, the chief stress was laid upon
the height of the terrace. The terrace, in a certain sense, is the
original zikkurat the real '
high place
' and the temple of one
story naturally precedes the staged tower, and may have remained the type for some time before the more elaborate structure was
evolved. However this may be, we are justified in associating the mountain motif with the beginnings of religious architec
ture in the Euphrates Valley, precisely as the underlying cosmic notions belong to the earliest period of which we have any knowledge. That the staged tower when once evolved was
regarded as the most 'satisfactory expression of the religious ideas follows from the fact that all the large centers of Babylonia had a zikkurat of some kind dedicated to the patron
deity, and probably many of the smaller places likewise. A list of zikkurats l furnishes the names of no less than twenty ; and
while all of the important places are included, there are others
which do not appear to have played an important part in either
the religious or political history of the country, and which nevertheless had their zikkurat. To judge from the fact that in this list several names of zikkurat are connected with one and the same place, more than one zikkurat, indeed, could be
found in a large religious center. 2
THE CONSTRUCTION AND CHARACTER OF THE ZIKKURATS,
The zikkurat was quadrangular in shape. The orientation of the four corners towards the four cardinal points was only
approximate.3 Inasmuch as the rulers of Babylonia from a
1 II R. 50, obverse. 2 Perhaps, however, these several names all designate a single zikkurat. 3 Peters' Nippur, i. 246 ; ii. 120.



THE TEMTLES AND THE CULT. 617
very early period call themselves *
king of the four regions,' l it has been supposed that the quadrangular shape was chosen designedly ; but there is no proof that any stress was laid upon
symbolism of this kind, or upon the orientation of the corners
of the sacred edifices. More attention was bestowed upon
making the brick structure huge and massive.
The height of the zikkurats varied. Those at Nippur and Ur 2 appear to have been about 90 feet high, while the tower
at Borsippa which Sir Henry Rawlinson carefully examined 3
attained a height of 140 feet. The base of this zikkurat,
which may be regarded as a specimen of the tower in its most
elaborate form, was a quadrangular mass 272 feet square and 26 feet high. The second and third stories were of equal height, but the square mass diminished with each story by 42
feet. The height of the four upper stories was 15 feet each.
At the same time, the mass diminished steadily at the rate of
42 feet, so that the seventh story consisted of a mass of only 20
feet square. Sargon's zikkurat at Khorsabad (the suburb of
Nineveh) was about the same height. The average number of stages of the zikkurat appears to have been three, as at Nippur and Ur, or four, as at Larsa.4
In the pictorial representations of the towers, 5 we similarly find either three or four. In these smaller zikkurats, the height of
1 For the meaning of this phrase, see Winckler's Altoricntalische Forsc/iiin^cn,
iii. 208-222, and Jensen's Kosmologie, p. 167. 2 From Heuzey's note in De Sarzec, Dccourvertes en Chaldcc, p. 31, it would appear that at Lagash there was a zikkurat of modest proportions, but Dr. Peters informs me that from his observations at Telloh, he questions whether the building in question represents a zikkurat at all, though, as we know from other sources, a zikkurat existed there in the days of Gudea. 3 Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, xviii. 4 Of Sargon's zikkurat at Khorsabad, also, only four stories have been found.
Perrot and Chipiez (History of Art in Chaldaea and Assyria, i. 388) suppose that there may have been seven. 5 E.g. Perrot and Chipiez, ib. p. 128. Hommel, Geschichte Babylonicns itnd Assyriens, p. 19.



618 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
each tower, as in the first three stories of the tower at Borsippa,
appears to have been alike; but the mass diminished in pro
portion in order to secure a space for a staircase leading from one story to the other. This method of ascent was older than
the winding balustrade, which was better adapted to the more elaborate structures of later times. No doubt, as the towers
increased in height, other variations were introduced as, eg.,
in the proportions of the stones without interfering with the
essential principle of the zikkurat.
The ungainly appearance presented by the huge towers was somewhat relieved by decorations of the friezes and by the
judicious use of color. Enameled bricks of bright hues, such as yellow and blue, 1 became common, and in the case of some of the towers it would appear that a different color was chosen
for each story. Whether all the bricks in each story were col
ored or only those at the edge, or, perhaps, some rows, it is impossible to say. From Herodotus' description of the seven concentric walls of Ecbatana,'2 in which each wall was distinguished by a certain color, the conclusion has been drawn that
the same colors white, black, scarlet, blue, orange, silver,
and gold were employed by the Babylonians for the stages of their towers ; but there is no satisfactory evidence that this was the case. That these colors were brought into connection
with the planets, as some scholars have supposed, is highly
improbable. As already pointed out, no special stress seems to have been laid upon the number of stories of which the zikkurat consisted,
but the natural result of ambition and rivalry among builders tended towards an increase of the height, and this end could be
most readily attained by adding to the number of stories. Still, there may have been some symbolism which led to the choice
of three, four, or seven stories, inasmuch as these numbers
1 Peters (Nippur, i. 214) found many yellow-colored bricks at Borsippa. 2 Book I, 98.



THE TEMPLES AND THE CULT. 619
have a sacred import among so many nations. 1 For the num
ber seven, the influence of cosmological associations is quite
clear. The two most famous of the zikkurats of seven stages
were those in Babylon and in Borsippa, opposite Babylon. The latter bears the significant name E-ur-imin-an-ki, 2
i.e., 'the house of the seven directions of heaven and earth.' The 'seven
directions ' were interpreted by the Babylonian theologians as a reference to the seven great celestial bodies, the sun and
moon and the five planets Ishtar, Marduk, Ninib, Nergal, and Nabu.3 To each of these gods one story was supposed to be
dedicated, and the tower thus became a cosmological symbol, elaborating in theological fashion the fundamental idea of the
zikkurat as a reproduction of the dwelling-place of the gods. The identification of the five gods with the planets is a proof
of the scholastic character of the interpretation, and hence of
its comparatively late origin. This interpretation of the number, seven, however, was not the only one proposed in the Babylonian schools. Two much older towers than those of
Babylon and Borsippa bear names in which ' seven ' is intro
duced. One of these is the zikkurat to Nin-girsu at Lagash, which Gudea 4 describes as ' the house of seven divisions of the
world'; the other, the tower at Uruk, 5 which bore the name f house of seven zones.' The reference in both cases is, as
Jensen has shown, 6 to the seven concentric zones into which
the earth was divided by the Babylonians. It is a conception that we encounter in India and Persia, and that survives in the seven * climates ' into which the world was divided by Greek
and Arabic geographers. It seems clear that this interpreta

Studies, Boston, 1894, pp. 141-147). - Written ideographically, as the names of the zikkurats and of all sacred edifices

620 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
tion of the number seven is older than the one which identified
each story with one of the planets. 1 Both interpretations have a scholastic aspect, however, and the very fact that there
are two interpretations, justifies the suspicion that neither furnishes the real explanation why the number seven was chosen. It by no means follows from the names borne by the zikkur
ats at Lagash and Uruk that they actually consisted of seven stories. The ' seven divisions ' and the ' seven zones ' are
merely terms equivalent to ' universe.' The names given to the towers would have been equally appropriate if they con
sisted as they probably did of fewer stories than seven. But, on the other hand, the introduction of the number seven
into the names may be regarded as a factor which influenced ambitious builders to make the number of stories seven. Over
and above this, however, seven was chosen, primarily, because
it was a large number, and, secondly, because it was a sacred number, sacred in part because large, since '
largeness
' .and ' sacredness ' are correlated ideas in the popular phases of early
religious thought. In the same way, it is because seven was popularly sacred that the world was divided into seven zones
and that the planets were fixed at seven, not vice versa.
The opinion of some scholars 2 that the zikkurats were used for astronomical observations remains a pure conjecture, of
which it cannot even be said that it has probability in its favor.
It is certain that the astronomical observations, since they were
conducted by the priests, were made in the temple precincts ; but a small room at the top of a pyramid difficult of access
seems hardly a spot adapted for the purpose. Moreover, the sacred character of the zikkurat speaks against the supposition
1 The suggestion is worthy of consideration whether the name ' seven directions of heaven and earth ' may not also point to a conception of seven zones dividing the heavens as well as the earth. One is reminded of the ' seven ' heavens of Arabic
theology. 2 So e.g., Kaulen, Assyrien und Babylonien (3d edition), p. 58 ; Vigouroux, La Bible et les Decouvertes Modernes (4th edition), i. 358.



yy//i TEMPLES AND THE CULT. 621
that it should have been put to such constant use, and for purposes not directly connected with the cult. In the numerous
astronomical reports that we have, there is not a single reference from which one could conclude that the observations
reported were made from the top of a zikkurat.
But, on the other hand, it would appear that as the zikkurat
developed from a one-story edifice into a tower, and as the number of the stages increased, the zikkurat assumed more of an' ornamental character. While the ascent of the tower con
tinued to be regarded to the latest days as a sacred duty,
pleasing in the eyes of the deity, for the ordinary and more practical purposes of the cult, other buildings were erected near the tower. Within the temple area and bordering on it there were smaller shrines, while in front of the zikkurat there
was a large open place, where the pilgrims who flocked to the
sacred city, congregated. The sacrifices which formed the
essential feature of worship were brought, not at the top of
the zikkurat, but on altars that were erected at the base.
The ideographic designation of the zikkurat as a '
conspicuous house,' l which accords admirably with the motive ascribed in the eleventh chapter of Genesis to the builders of a zikkurat
to erect an edifice that "could be seen," supports the view here taken of the more decorative position which the staged tower
came to occupy, an homage to the gods rather than a place
where they were to be worshipped, something that suggested the dwelling-place of a god, to be visited only occasionally by the worshipper in short, a monument forming part of a
religious sanctuary, but not coextensive with the sanctuary. The differentiation that thus arose between the dwelling-place of the god and the place where he was to be worshipped is a perfectly natural one. To emphasize the fact that the zikkurat
was the temple for the god, a small room was built at the top
1 Lit., 'house to be seen,' Igi-e-nir. See, e.g., VR. 29, no. 4, 40, and Delitzsch, Assyr. Handu'ortcrbiicli, p. 262.



622 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
of the zikkurat, 1 and it was a direct consequence of this same
distinction between a temple for the gods and a temple for
actual worship that led to assigning to zikkurats special names, and such as differed from the designation of the sacred quarter of which the zikkurat formed the most conspicuous feature.
Thus the name E-Kur, ' mountain house,' though evidently an
appropriate designation for the zikkurat, becomes the term for the sacred area which included in time a large series of build
ings used for the cult, whereas the zikkurat itself receives the
special name of 'house of oracle'; 2 and similarly in the case of the various other religious centers of Babylonia, the name of
the zikkurat is distinct from that of the sacred quarter the
temple in the broader sense. The special position which the zikkurat thus came to occupy
is, of course, merely an outcome of the growth of the religious centers of the country, and involves no departure from the
religious ideals of earlier days. The distinction is much of the
same order as we find in the case of the Hebrew temple at
Jerusalem, where the court in which the worshippers gathered was distinct from the '
holy of holies,' which was originally regarded as the dwelling of Yahwe, and in later times was viewed as the spot where he manifested himself. The name ' house of oracle ' given to the zikkurat at Nippur is a valu
able indication of the special sanctity that continued to be
attached to the staged tower.
THE TEMPLE AND THE SACRED QUARTER.
But the zikkurat, while the most characteristic expression of
the religious spirit of Babylonia, was by no means the only kind of sacred edifice that prevailed.
1 So at Babylon, at least, according to Herodotus. Traces of such a room were also found in connection with the zikkurat at Nippur (Peters, Nipftir, ii. 122. 2 Bit pirishti. IIR. 50, obverse, 6. Another name (or perhaps the name of a second zikkurat at Nippur ; see p. 616, note 2) is Im-kharsag, i.e.,
' mountain of awe.' Peters' rendering (Nippztr, ii. 122) of the names is inaccurate.



THE TEMl'LES AND THE CULT. 623
The excavations at Nippur have afforded us for the first time
a general view of a sacred quarter in an ancient Babylonian city. The extent of the quarter was considerable. Dr. Peters'
estimate is eight areas for the zikkurat and surrounding struc
tures, and to this we may add several acres more, since beyond
the limits of the great terrace there were buildings to the south
east and southwest, used for religious purposes. It is likely that the extent of E-Sagila at Babylon was even greater. Out
side of the temple area at Nippur, Peters l and Haynes unearthed a court of considerable size, lined with brick columns. The
court was open to the sky, but the columns supported a roof which was apparently of wood. Similar courts have been found
elsewhere, so that we are justified in regarding the Nippur structure as characteristic of the architecture of Babylonia.
The court was attached to an edifice of considerable size, which contained among other things rooms in which the temple records were kept. The entrance to the court was by a large
gateway, supported on each side by a brick column, double the diameter of those that surrounded the court. While the nature
of the building is not perfectly clear, still the presence of the temple archives and the gateway make it probable that the structure was used in connection with the cult of some deity
worshipped at Nippur. Lending weight to this supposition are the points of resemblance between this structure and the sacred
edifices of the ancient Hebrews and Arabs. A court of sixty
columns made of wood, quadrangular in shape, with the supports and tops of metal was the characteristic feature of
the tabernacle'. 2 Within this court, open to the sky, the people
gathered for worship. The altar and the basin for ablutions
stood in the court, while the holy tent containing the ark was
set up near the eastern end of the place. Similarly at Mecca,3

624 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
the Kaaba, the pulpit, and the sacred fountain are grouped within a space enclosed on all sides by colonnades. Again,
surrounding the Solomonic temple on three sides was a spacious court. This court was enclosed with colonnades. 1 It
may well be, therefore, that the edifice around or near the fine court of columns at Nippur was a sacred structure,
erected in honor of some deity. The two large brick col
umns at the entrance to the Nippur court are paralleled in
the case of the Solomonic temple by the two large columns,
known as Yakhin and Boaz, that stood at the gateway.
These names are as yet unexplained. Their symbolic character, apart from other evidence, may be concluded from the circumstance that, as Schick has shown, 2 the columns
stood free, and did not serve as a support for any part
of the gateway.3 There is no need, therefore, for any hesitation in comparing these two columns, whose presence in the Solomonic structure is certainly due to foreign influence, to those found at Nippur.4 That the columns at Nippur were erected in accordance with
recognized custom follows from De Sarzec's discovery of two enormous round columns within the sacred quarter of Lagash. 5
In the light of Peters' excavations, the significance of the columns at Lagash becomes clear. Unfortunately, De Sarzec's excavations at Lagash at the point of the mound in
question were interrupted, but he gives reasons for believing that other columns existed near the two large ones found by
1 Schick, ib. pp. 125-131. 2 Die Stiftshiittc, der Tempcl, und der Tempelplatz der Jctztztit, p. 82. 3 On the significance of the gate in sacred edifices, see Trumbull, The Threshold Covenant, pp. 102-108. 4 Dr. Peters is of the opinion that at the entrance to the temple area proper at Nippur there also stood two large columns.
5 Decouvertes en Chaldcc, pp. 62-64. Heuzey, in a valuable note, already suggests the comparison with the two columns of Solomon's which is here maintained on the basis of the excavations at Nippur.



THE TEMPLES AND THE CULT. 625
him. 1 There is, therefore, every reason to conclude that at
Lagash, as at Nippur and no doubt elsewhere, the two columns
belonged to a great gateway leading into a large court of columns. That these columns served a symbolic purpose in the
Babylonian temple as they did at Jerusalem, cannot be main
tained with certainty, but is eminently likely. The court of columns was surrounded by a series of rooms. If the view taken of the building is correct, these rooms were used for the temple administration. However this may be, there can be no doubt that the structures of various size found
around the zikkurat at Nippur served as dwellings for the
priests and the temple attendants, as stalls for the temple cattle, as shops for the manufacture and sale of votive objects, and the like. Within the temple area proper were the schools where young priests were trained to be scribes, and received
instructions in the doctrines and rites. The astronomical
observatories, too, were situated near the temple. The schools
served, as they still do in the orient, as the gathering-place of the mature scholars. The systematized pantheon, and the
cosmological and astronomical systems represent the outcome of the intellectual activity that manifested itself within the sacred
quarters of the cities of Babylonia. The execution of justice being in the hands of the priests, the sacred area also contained
the rooms where the judges sat. It is interesting to note that
Gudea mentions a hall of judgment in the temple to Nin-girsu at Lagash. The number of such buildings attached to the
temple precinct varied, of course, according to the needs and growth of each place. In Nippur, the numbers appear to have
been very large. We may assume, likewise, that at Sippar, Uruk, Ur, and Larsa the zikkurat was the center of a considerable
group of buildings, while at Babylon in the days of her greatest power, the temple area of E-Sagila must have presented the appearance of a little city by itself, shut off from the rest of the

town by a wall which invariably enclosed the sacred quarter. Within this large wall there were smaller ones, marking the
several divisions of the temple buildings. The construction of the smaller edifices does not appear to have varied from the
ordinary form chosen for the one-story dwelling-houses in the city proper. The material used for all structures the large and the small ones was brick. In earlier times the bricks were
merely dried in the sun. The buildings, as a consequence, suffered much from the influence of the heat and rain, and required frequent repairs. Often the tower would crumble away, and an
entirely new edifice would have to be erected. The later cus
tom of kiln-dried bricks was an improvement, and still more solidity was insured when the exterior series of brick was
glazed. In the older buildings, the bricks were merely piled together, without cement. Afterwards straw was mixed with
the clay, but as early as Gudea's days the bitumen, abounding in the valley, became the common cement employed in all edifices of importance. Wood was used in the case of smaller
sanctuaries (as also in palaces) for the roof, and the kings often
refer with pride to the efforts they made to obtain the precious
cedars of the Lebanon forests for their building enterprises. The decoration was confined largely to the facades, the doors,
and the floors. A pleasing effect also was produced by the judicious distribution of glazed and enameled bricks in the walls. Colors were used with still greater lavishness in the
decorations of the interior. The brilliancy was heightened by the use of precious stones and gold and silver for the walls
and floors and ceilings. The aim of the builders was, as they
constantly tell us, to make the buildings as brilliant as the sunlight. The decorations of the brick walls and floors suggest
textile patterns, and to account for this, some scholars have
supposed that prior to the use of colored bricks, it was cus
tomary to cover the walls and floors of temples and palaces
with draperies and rugs. The suggestion lacks proof, but has

much in its favor. In exterior architecture no profound changes
were ever introduced, but within the prescribed limits, the builders did their utmost to make their edifices testimonials of
their zeal and power. They imported gold, copper, and diorite from the Sinai peninsula and Arabia, precious stones from Armenia and the Upper Euphrates, wood from Bahrein and from various parts of the Amanus range, and so all quarters of the ancient world of culture were ransacked for contributions to
add to the splendor of the Babylonian and Assyrian cities. Much care was bestowed in the course of time upon the portals. The wooden gates were covered with bronze, in which art of decoration great skill was developed. 1 The columns of stone
appear only in Assyrian edifices as decorations in the front of
palaces, supporting a portal or portico that projects from the temple proper. 2 The introduction appears to be due to foreign
influence, perhaps Hittite. 3 To determine the interior arrangement of a sacred structure,
we have two small Assyrian temples, excavated by Layard at
Nimrod, to serve as our guide. 4 A long hall constituted the
chief feature. At the extreme end of this hall was a small
room, in which stood a statue of the god to whom the tem
ple was dedicated. This room, known as the papakhu or
parakku, was the most sacred part of the temple, and it is doubtful whether any but the king or the highest officials
had access to it. Certainly, no one could approach the

"shut off" 1 from the rest of the building, precisely as the
holy of holies in the temple of Jerusalem containing the ark, was separated from the central hall. Gudea 2 describes the
papakhu as the " dark "
(or inner) chamber.
We are fortunate in having a pictorial representation of
such a papakhu. A stone tablet found at Sippar 3 represents
Shamash seated in the " holy of holies " of the temple E-Bab
bara. The god sits on a low throne. In front of him is an
altar table on which rests a wheel with radiant spokes, a
symbol of the sun-god. Into this sanctuary the worshipper, who is none other than the king Nabubaliddin, is led by a
priest. The king is at pains to tell us in the inscription attached to the design, that he was careful to restore the image of Shamash after an ancient model, and his motive in adding
an illustration to this tablet is that future builders may have
no excuse for not being equally careful. We may, therefore, take the illustration as a sample of the general character of
the sacred chambers in the Babylonian and Assyrian temples in the great centers. The papakhu was decorated with great
lavishness. . The floors and walls and also the ceiling were
studded with precious stones. We may believe Herodotus 4 when he tells us that the statue of Marduk in his temple at
Babylon and the table in front of it was of gold. It was to the
papakhu that the priests retired when they desired to obtain an
oracle direct from the god ; and as in the course of time the
sanctity of the spot increased, we may well suppose that the occasions when the deity was directly approached in his papakhu became rarer. Through the influence of the schools
attached to the Marduk cult at Babylon, the New Year's Festival

THE TEMPLES AND THE CULT. 629
the character of which we will have occasion to explain later
on came to be regarded as the season most appropriate for
approaching the oracular chamber. During this festival, Marduk was supposed to decide the fate of mankind for the whole year, and the intercession of the priests on the occasion was
fraught with great importance.
A special significance, moreover, came to be attached to the sacred chamber in the Marduk temple. Complementing in a measure, the cosmological associations that have been noted in connection with the zikkurat, the papakhu of Marduk was regarded as an imitation of a cosmical ' sacred chamber.' As the zikkurat represented the mountain on which the gods were born and where they were once supposed to dwell, so the
sacred room was regarded as the reproduction of a portion of the great mountain where the gods assembled in solemn council. This council chamber was situated at the eastern end of
the great mountain, and was known as Du-azagga, that is, * brilliant chamber/ The chamber itself constituted the innermost recess of the eastern limit of the mountain, and the
special part of the mountain in which it lay was known as
Ubshu-kenna, written with the ideographic equivalents to 'assembly room.' It will be apparent that such a view
of the papakhu is the result of theological speculation, and is not due, as is the conception of the zikkurat, to popular beliefs.
The assembly of the gods presupposes a systematization of the pantheon, and the fact that it is only the papakhu in Mar
duk's temple which is known as Du-azagga 1 is a sufficient indication of the influences at work which produced this con
ception. In the creation epic, there is a reference to the Ubshu-kenna 2 which shows the main purpose of a divine
1 See the chief passage, IR. 54, col. ii. 11. 54-65 ; another name is E-Kua, 'dwelling.' 2 See p. 423.



630 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
assembly in the eyes of the priests of Babylon. The gods meet there in order to do homage to Marduk. They gather
around the victorious vanquisher of Tiamat, as the princes
gather round the throne of the supreme ruler, the king of
Babylon and of Babylonia. One can see, however, that, as is generally the case with
theological doctrines, there is a popular starting-point from which these views were developed. The Du-azagga is older than the Ubshu-kenna. Situated in the extreme east, the
' brilliant chamber ' is evidently the place whence the sun
rises in the morning. A hymn to Shamash l expressly speaks of the sun rising out of the Du-azagga, and, since the sun also
appears to rise up out of the ocean, the Du-azagga is placed at a point close to the great Apsu, which flows underneath the
mountain. In confirmation of this view, a syllabary 2 identifies
the Du-azagga with the Apsu. Marduk, by virtue of his
original quality as a solar deity, would naturally be pictured as coming forth from Du-azagga. In this sense the title Mar
Du-azaga, 3 ' son of Du-azagga,' is applied to him, just as he is called Mar-Apsi, the son of Apsu. But the same conception would hold good of Shamash, of Ninib, and of some other
solar deities, though not of all. That Du-azagga came to be
especially associated with Marduk is due simply to the preeminent rank that he came to occupy. Whether there was also a
popular basis for the conception of an Ubshu-kenna, an
'
assembly room ' of the gods, is a question more difficult to
answer. Certainly, the view that the gods gathered together in one place belongs to an age which attempted to fix, at least
in some measure, the relationship of the divine beings to one another. The popular phase of the conception of a general

THE TEMPLES AND THE CULT. 631
assembly house could, in any case, hardly have proceeded further than the assumption of some particular part of the great mountain, where the gods were wont to come together. The
connection of this assembly place with the Du-azagga is dis
tinctly the work of the theologians of Babylon. In their desire
to make Marduk the central figure of the pantheon, they bring all the gods to his side. The Ubshu-kenna is thus transferred
to the region whence the sun issues on his daily journey. The ' chamber ' of Marduk becomes the most sacred spot in this region, and the Ubshu-kenna the general name for the region itself. As Marduk in Babylon was surrounded by his court, so in Ubshu-kenna the gods assemble to pay homage to the one
freely acknowledged by them as the greatest, and who is pictured as sitting on his throne in Du-azagga. The further
speculation which brought the gods together yearly on the occasion of the great Marduk festival belongs likewise, and as a matter of course, to the period when Marduk's sway was
undisputed. The ideas that were thus attached to the papakhu in E-Sagila are a valuable indication of the sanctity attached to that part
of the temple where the god sat enthroned. In a general way,
what holds good of Marduk's papakhu applies to every sacred chamber in a temple, and no doubt views were once current of
the papakhu of Bel at Nippur and of the 'holy of holies' in E-Babbara 1 and elsewhere that formed in some measure, a
parallel to what the Marduk priests told of their favorite
sanctuary. Coming back now to the large hall which led into the
papakhu, the absence of bas-reliefs in this hall in the case of
the Assyrian temples excavated by Layard, suggests that the walls of this hall were not lined with sculptured slabs, as was
the case in the large rooms of the palaces ; and we may con

632 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
elude that in Babylonian temples, likewise, the decoration of the walls was confined as a general thing to enameled bricks,
interspersed, perhaps, with metallic panels, and that mythological scenes such as the contest with Tiamat or Gilgamesh's
adventures were only occasionally portrayed. An aim which, as the rulers themselves tell us in their inscriptions, they
always kept in view was to make both the exterior and interior
of the temples resplendent with brilliant coloring "brilliant
as the sun." At the entrances to the Assyrian temples stood
lions, chiseled out of soft limestone or the harder alabaster.
At Telloh various fragments of large lion heads were found, 1
so that there is every reason not only to trace this custom to
Babylonia, but to carry it back to a very early period. Besides the lion, a favorite religious symbol, as we have seen, 2 was the
bull, and, since Nebuchadnezzar speaks of retaining the " bull "
statue of the old temple to Nana (or Ishtar) at Erech, we may suppose that the representation of colossal bulls at the entrances
to the temples also belongs to the characteristic features of
Babylonian religious architecture. The lion, it will be recalled,
is more particularly the symbol of Nergal, but he appears originally, like the bull, to have been a symbol of other gods as
well perhaps, indeed, of the gods in general. Similarly, the
eagle, which becomes the special symbol of Ashur, appears prominently on the monuments of Entemena 3 and other ancient rulers, centuries before the Ashur cult comes into
prominence. In the large court in front of the zikkurats there stood the
jars used in connection with the cult, and the presence of these jars furthermore suggests that there was an altar in the
great court, precisely as in the case of the Solomonic temple. 4

THE TEMPLES AND THE CULT. 633
In the larger of the temples found by Layard, there was a
smaller hall in front of the large one. We may assume that
the same was the case with the larger temples of Babylonia, and this three-fold division of the "interior, the vestibule, or
pronaos, the main hall, or naos, and the papakhu, further warrants the comparison of a Babylonian sacred edifice with
the Solomonic temple, 1 where likewise we have the vestibule, the hall known as the '
holy' part, and the 'holy of holies,' the one leading into the other. As to the further disposition of the rooms in the main temple, we must be content to wait for
further excavations. What we know is sufficient to warrant
the supposition that there was practical uniformity in the
interior arrangement of the Babylonian and Assyrian temples. What variation there existed was probably confined to the
decoration of the walls, doorways, and to the facades. Mean
while, it is something to have reached general results. The zikkurat was surrounded by a varying number of shrines that
were used as places of assembly for worshippers. The latter gathered also in the large court in front of the zikkurat, where
the chief altar probably stood. 2 In the large halls of the
shrines, there were in all probabilities likewise altars. It seems
natural to suppose that the hall of judgment, mentioned already in Gudea's inscription, 3 was attached to some shrine. Besides the zikkurats and shrines, there were smaller structures used
as dwellings for the priests and temple officials, for storehouses, for the archives, and as stalls for the animals to be used
in the sacrifices. At Nippur a smithy was found near the tem
1 See the plan in Schick, Die Stiflshutte, pi. 5. Layard (Discoveries among the Kit ins of Nineveh and Babylon, pp. 642-648) points out some analogies between the constructions at Nimrod and Solomon's buildings, but what he says applies
chiefly to the palaces. 2 Herodotus, book i.sec. 183, speaks of two altars outside of the temple of Marduk in Babylon. In the case of so important a structure, the number of altars was naturally more numerous. 3 See Heuzey's note in De Sarzec's Dccou-vcrtes en Chaldce, p. 65,



634 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
pie precinct. There were workshops near the temple where the furnishings for the temple, such as the curtains and the
utensils, were made, and there were magazines where votive tablets and offerings were manufactured and sold. The num
ber of these structures varied, naturally, in each religious cen
ter, and increased in proportion to the growth of the center.
The zikkurat, the great court, the shrines, and the smaller structures formed a sacred precinct, and it was this precinct as a whole that constituted the temple in the larger sense, and received some appropriate name. Thus E-Kur at Nippur,
E-Sagila at Babylon, I>Zida at Borsippa are used to denote
the entire sacred precinct in these cities, and not merely the
chief structure. The zikkurat always had a special name of its own.
A factor that contributed largely to the growth of the sacred precinct in the large centers was the circumstance that the
political importance of such centers as Nippur, Lagash, Ur, Babylon, and Nineveh led the rulers to group around the wor
ship of the chief deity, the cult of the minor ones who consti
tuted the family or the court of the chief god. The kings
measured their importance by the number of the gods upon whose assistance they could rely. The priests came to the
assistance of the kings in connecting the gods of the royal
pantheon in such a way, as to satisfy the pride of both their
royal and divine masters. 1 The ambition of the kings, more
especially of the Assyrian empire, led also to the addition of
foreign deities to the pantheon. For these also shrines were
built within or near the sacred precinct.
Gudea sets the example for his successors by parading a
large pantheon at the close of his inscriptions,2 and a list of
temples in Lagash, recently published by Scheil, 3 shows that
1 See pp. 109 seq. 2 See p. 1 06. 3 Recueil des Travattx, etc., xvii. 39.



THE TEMPLES AND THE CULT. 635
most, if not all, of the gods invoked by the ruler had a sanctuary erected in his or her honor. There were, as we have
seen, several quarters in Lagash, and therefore several sacred
precincts, so that we cannot be certain that all of these sanc
tuaries stood in one and the same quarter. But, since the list
in question furnishes the name of no less than thirteen sacred
edifices, we are certain that as many as four or five smaller
chapels surrounded the precinct in which stood the great
temple E-Ninnu, sacred to Gudea's chief god NingirsuNinib.
The list is headed by the sanctuary to Nin-girsb. There
follow temples to Bau, to Nin-gishzida, Nin-mar, Nina, Dumuzi,
Nin-si-a, Ga-sig-dug known to us from the inscriptions of Gudea, besides others, like Shabra (?), Nin-sun, Nin-tu, that appear here for the first time. In Nippur, we find traces of the wor
ship of Belit (or Nin-lil), of Ninib, and of Nusku, though with the exception of the first named, the worship of these gods has not been traced back further than the days of the Cossean
dynasty. Subsequent excavations may, of course, change the present aspect ; but one gains the impression from the most ancient inscriptions found at Nippur that at an early period
Bel was a god much like the Hebrew Yahwe, " jealous " of
having others at his side. Such a conception would help to
account for the title ' lord ' being applied to him above all
others, and also aids us in understanding the lasting impression he made upon the people of Babylonia, an impression so profound that when the time came for En-lil to yield his
supremacy to Marduk, no better means could be found of
emphasizing the latter's authority, than by transferring to him the names and titles of the older Bel. 1 In this respect, how
ever, Nippur was an exception, and in later times the Bel cult was affected by the same influences that led Gudea to group
around the sanctuary to Nin-girsu, edifices sacred to other gods
1 See pp. 140 seq.



636 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
and goddesses. Lugalzaggisi l of Erech enumerates an extensive pantheon, 2 which contains most of the chief deities, and from which we may conclude that the temple of Nana was simi
larly the center of a large precinct in which the cult of other deities was carried on. When we come to the cult of Marduk
at Babylon and of Nabu at Borsippa, the inscriptions, chiefly those of Nebuchadnezzar, come to our aid in showing us the
arrangement of the various chapels that were comprised within
the sacred precincts of E-Sagila and E-Zida, respectively. In the first place, the close relationship between Marduk and
Nabu was" emphasized by placing a papakhu to Nabu in the precinct of E-Sagila, which built in imitation of E-Zida at
Borsippa was called by the same name. 8 This papakhu, it
would seem, was independent of a special temple to Nabu known as E-Makh-tila, and which lay in Borsippa. The consort
of Marduk, Sarpanitum, likewise had her temple in Babylon, and naturally close to the chief sanctuary of Marduk. 4 Ea,
the father of Marduk, had a small sanctuary known as E-kar
zaginna in the sacred precinct. 5 It does not follow, of course, that all the temples in a center like Babylon or Borsippa were concentrated in one place. Indeed, when Nebuchad
nezzar speaks of three temples to Gula being erected in Borsippa, 6 it is certain that they could not have been within
the precinct of E-Zida, and so the temples to Shamash and Ramman, Sin and Ishtar, as well as to Nabu in Babylon, had
an independent position ; but we are at least warranted in con
cluding that they were not far removed from E-Sagila, and so, likewise, the numerous temples enumerated by Nebuchadnezzar
1 The date of this king has recently been pushed down by Thureau-Dangin, considerably later than the date assigned to him by Hilprecht (Revue Semitique, v. 265-269). 2 See p. 1 10. 3 Nebuchadnezzar, IR. 65, col. i. 11. 34, 35. 4 This is to be concluded from Nebuchadnezzar, ib. \. 32. 5 See Tiele's note, Zeitschrift fiir Assyriologic, ii. 184, note. 6 IR. 55, col. iv. 11. 54-57.



THE TEMPLES AND THE CULT. 637
as erected or improved by him in Borsippa were not far distant from Nabu's sanctuary, the famous E-Zida. The palaces of the kings were also erected near the temples. In Babylon, we know that before Nebuchadnezzar's days, the palace stood so
close to E-Sagila that an enlargement of it was impossible without encroaching on the sacred quarter. 1 The tendency to combine with the worship of the chief god, the cult of others is
as characteristic of Assyrian rulers as of their Babylonian
predecessors. We are fortunate in possessing an extensive
list,
2 enumerating the various deities worshipped in the temples of Assyria, and the occasions on which they are to be invoked.
The information to be gained from this list is all the more
welcome since the Assyrian kings are chiefly interested in
transmitting an account of their military expeditions, and tell
us comparatively little of the religious edifices in their capitols. From this list we learn that in the old temple sacred to Anu
and Ramman, 3 in the city of Ashur the oldest Assyrian tem
ple known to us, 4 some twenty deities were worshipped. Images at least of these deities must have stood in the
temple ;
5 but, since there is a distinct reference to zikkurats 6 in
the list, for some of them special sanctuaries of some kind must have been erected within the precinct. From the same list we learn that there was a temple to Marduk 7 in Ashur in
which the cult of the Shamash, Sarpanitum, Ramman, Ninib, Anunit was also carried on ; similarly, in the temples of Ashur,
of Gula, and of Ninib, other gods were worshipped. Provisions of some kind for the cult of these deities must have

been made, and one cannot escape the conclusion that in the
Assyrian capitols, the sacred precincts likewise covered considerable territory, and that the tendency existed towards a steady increase of the structures erected in connection with the cult
of the patron deity. Sennacherib proudly describes Nineveh as the city which contained the shrines of all gods and god
desses. 1
THE NAMES OF THE ZIKKURATS AND TEMPLES.
We have seen that every sacred edifice had a special name by which it was known. This custom belongs to the oldest
period of Babylonian history, and continues to the latest.
Through these names, to which, no doubt, considerable significance was attached, we obtain a valuable insight into the reli
gious spirit of the Babylonians ; but it is important to note that the custom does not appear to have been as general 2 in
Assyria, where the temples are simply known as the house of
this or that god or goddess. Of special interest are those
names which were suggested by the original design of the temples. Such are E-Kur, ' the mountain house ' at Nippur,
E-kharsagkurkura, 'the house of the mountain of all lands,' the
name of several temples. 3 The same idea finds expression also in such names as E-kharsag-ella, or ' house of the glorious moun
tain,' the name of a temple to Gula in Babylon; E-kharsag, 'the mountain house,' a temple in Ur; 4 E-kur-makh, ' the house of the great mountain,' which a text 5 declares to be equivalent to
E-kharsag-kalama. Closely allied with these names are those
indicating in one way or the other, the height or greatness of
1 Meissner-Rost, Bauinschriften Sanhcrib'>

2 See, e.g., the list IIIR. 66. An exception is formed by the temple to Ramman in the city of Asshur, which has a special name. See the following note. 3 Including the one to Ramman in Asshur. 4 IR. 2. nos. n, 2. 5 IIR. 50, obverse 13.



THE TEMPLES AND THE CULT. 639
the buildings, as the general aim of the builders. Prominent among such names are E-Sagila,
' the lofty house,' the famous
temple and temple area at Babylon ; E-makh, ' the great house,' a chapel to Nin-kharsag, situated perhaps within E-Sagila; E-gal-makh,
' the great palace,' an old temple in Ur ; E-anna,
' the heavenly house,' that is, the house reaching up to heaven, which is the name of the temple of Ishtar or Nana at
Erech ; E-Igi-e-nir-kidur-makh, 1 * the tower of the great dwelling ' sacred to Ninni at Kish. To the same class belong such desig
nations as E-dur-an-ki, 'the link of heaven and earth,' 2 the name of a zikkurat at Larsa ; E-an-dadia,
* the house reach
ing to heaven,' the zikkurat at Agade ; E-pa,
* the summit
house,' the zikkurat to Nin-girsu at Lagash ; E-gubba-an-ki, 'the point of heaven and earth,' one of the names of the zik
kurat in Dilbat ; E-dim-anna, c the house of heavenly construc
tion,' the chapel to Sin within the precinct of E-Zida at Borsippa, a name that again conveys the notion of an edifice reaching up to heaven. The names of the zikkurats at Erech and Bor
sippa,
' the house of seven zones ' and ' the house of the seven
divisions of heaven and earth,' respectively, while conveying, as
we saw, 3 cosmological conceptions of a more specific character, may still be reckoned in the class of names that embody the
leading purpose of the tower in Babylonia, as may also a name like E-temen-an-ki, 'the foundation stone of heaven and earth,'
assigned to the zikkurat to Marduk in Babylonia.
The sacred edifice, as the dwelling of the god to whom it is
dedicated, leads to such names as E-Zida,
' the true house or
fixed house,' 4 the famous temple to Nabu in Borsippa ; E-durgina, 5 'the house of the established seat, 'a temple of Bel-sarbi 6
1 Ige-e-nir = zikkurat ; Kidur = shubtu (dwelling) ; Makh rabu (great). 2 The name approaches closely to the conception of a zikkurat in the Book of Genesis, as a ' ladder' connecting heaven and earth. Gen. xxviii. 12.
8 See above, p. 619. 4 The ideas '
true, fixed, established, eternal ' are all expressed by the element Zida. 5 I adopt this reading as the one generally used. 6 See above, p. 242.



640 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
in Baz ; E-ki-dur^garza, 'the sacred dwelling/ a temple to Ninlil-anna in Babylon ; E-kua,
* the dwelling-house,' the name of the papakhu of Marduk in E-Sagila; E-gi-umunna, 'the permanent dwelling'; E-esh 2
-gi, a shrine to Nin-girsu at Lagash with the same meaning,
' permanent house.' Another class is formed by such names as are suggested by
the attributes of the deity to whom the edifices are dedicated.
Such are E-babbara, ' the brilliant house,' which, as the name of the temples to Shamash at Sippar and Larsa, recalls at once
the character of the sun-god. Similarly, E-gish-shir-gal,
' the
house of the great luminary,' was an appropriate name for the temple to the moon-god at Ur. The staff or sceptre being the symbol of the god Nabu, suggests as the name of a sanc
tuary to him in Babylonia, the name E-pad-kalama-suma,
' the
house of him who gives the sceptre of the world,' while the character of Shamash as the god of justice finds an expression
in the name E-ditar-kalama,
' the house of the universal judge,'
given to his temple or chapel in Babylon. The association of the number fifty with Ningirsu-Ninib leads to the name E-ninnu, ' house of fifty,'
3 for his temple in Lagash. Again, the position of Anu in the pantheon accounts for the name E-adda, ' house
of the father,' given to his temple, just as E-nin-makh,
* the
house of the great lady,' the name of a chapel in Babylon, at once recalls a goddess like Ishtar. Other names that describe
a temple by epithets of the gods to whom they are sacred, are E-nun-makh, 'the house of the great lord,' descriptive of Sin;
E-me-te-ur-sagga,
' the house of the glory of the warrior,' a tem
ple sacred to Zamama-Ninib ; E-U-gal,
' the house of the great
lord,' a temple to En-lil. A name like E-edinna,
' house of the
field,' a temple to the consort of Shamash at Sippar, may also have been suggested by some attribute of the goddess.4

Belit-seri,'
' mistress of the fields,' as the name of a goddess who belongs to the pantheon of the lower world. See p. 588.



7 '///;' TEMri.ES AND THE CULT. 641
Lastly, we have a class of names that might be described as
purely ornamental, or as embodying a pious wish. Of such we have a large number. Examples of this class are E-tila,
' house
of life.' Names extolling the glory and splendor of the temples are common. In a list of temples l we find such designations
as ' house of light,'
' house of the brilliant precinct,'
'
great place,'
'
lofty and brilliant wall,' 2 ' house of great splendor,
7 ' the splendor of heaven and earth,' 'house without a rival,' Might of
Shamash.' The seat of Sarpanitum in E-Sagila, is known as
'the gate of widespread splendor'; E-salgisa, 'the treasury,'
as the name of a temple in Girsu, may belong here. A temple to Gula in Sippar was called E-ulla ; that is,
' the beautiful
house.' The old temple to Sin at Harran bore the significant
name E-khulkhul, 'house of joys,' while the pious wish of the
worshipper is again expressed in the name ' threshold of long life,' given to the zikkurat in Sippar. 3 Among a series of names, 4
illustrating the religious sentiments of the people are the fol
lowing :
' the heart of Shamash,' ' the house of hearkening to
prayers,' 5 'the house full of joy,' 'the brilliant house,' 'the life
of the world,'
' the place of fates,' and the like. These various classes of names are a valuable index of the varied and often remarkable conceptions held of the gods. To
call a temple, for example,
' court of the world ' G may have
been due originally to a haughty presumption on the part of some one deeply attached to some god ; but such a name must
also have led to regarding the god as not limited in his affec
tions to a particular district. Whatever tendencies existed in
Babylonia and Assyria towards universalistic conceptions of

the divine beings were brought out in the temple names, and in part may have been advanced by these names. The custom
still surviving in the Jewish Church of giving names to synagogues may be traced back to a Babylonian prototype. 1
THE HISTORY OF THE TEMPLES.
The history of the temples takes us back to the earliest
period of Babylonian history, and the temples of Assyria likewise date from the small beginnings of the Assyrian power.
The oldest inscriptions of Mesopotamian rulers commemorate their services as builders of temples. Naram-Sin and Sargon
glory in the title ' builder of the temple of En-lil in Nippur.'
Of the rulers of the first period of Babylonian history, it so happens that we know more of Gudea than of any other. We may feel certain that he but follows the example of his prede
cessors, in devoting so large a share of his energies to temple building. Hammurabi is an active builder of sanctuaries, and
so on, through the period of Assyrian supremacy down to the
closing days of the Babylonian monarchy, the thoughts of the rulers were directed towards honoring the gods by improving,
restoring, rebuilding, or enlarging the sanctuaries, as well as by endowing them with rich gifts and votive offerings. The Assyrian kings, though perhaps more concerned with embellishing their palaces, do not neglect the seats of the gods. Anxious to maintain the connection between their kingdom and the old
cities of the south, the Assyrian monarchs were fond of paying homage to the time-honored sanctuaries of Babylonia. This
feeling, which is of course shared by the Babylonian rulers,
results in bringing about the continuity of the Babylonian and

THE TEMPLES AND THE CULT. 643
Assyrian religion. If, despite the changes that the religious doctrines underwent, despite the new interpretations given to old myths and legends, despite the profound changes introduced into the relationship of the gods to one another through the
systematization of the pantheon, if, despite all this, the Babylonians and Assyrians leaders and people continued to feel
that they were following the religion of their forefathers, it was due to the maintenance of the old sanctuaries. We can actu
ally trace the history of some of these sanctuaries for a period
of over 3000 years. In their restorations, the later builders
were careful not to offend the memory of their predecessors.
They sought out the old dedicatory inscriptions, and took steps to preserve them. They rejoiced when they came upon the old foundation stones. In their restorations they were careful to
follow original designs ; and likewise in the cult, so far from
deviating from established custom, they strongly emphasized their desire to restore the cult to its original character, wherever
an interruption for one reason or the other had taken place.
In all this, the rulers were acting in accord with the popular
instincts, for the masses clung tenaciously to the old sanc
tuaries, as affording an unfailing means of protection against the ills and accidents of life.
To enumerate all the temples of Babylonia and Assyria would be both an impossible and a useless task. Besides
those mentioned in the historical texts and in the legal litera
ture, we have long lists of temples prepared by the pedagogues. Some of these lists have been published ;
l others are to be
found among the unpublished material in the British Museum
collections.2 It is doubtful whether even these catalogues were
exhaustive, or aimed at being so ; moreover, a large number of gods are known to us only from the lists of the pedagogues.3
1 E.g., IIR. 50 (zikkurats) ; IIR. 61 ; IIIR. 66. 2 See Bezold Catalogue, etc., p. 1 776 and elsewhere. 3 E.g., IIR. 54-60 ; 111R. 67-69 ; VR. 43, 46.



644 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
So, to mention some, taken from a valuable list l which gives
chiefly the names of foreign gods, together with the places where they were worshipped, we learn of such gods as Lagamal, Magarida, Lasimu, A-ishtu, Bulala, Katnu, Kannu, Kishshat, Kanishurra, Khiraitum. Knowing, as we do, that at various periods
foreign deities were introduced into Babylonia and Assyria, 2 it
was necessary to make some provision for their cult ; and, while no doubt most of these minor deities and foreign gods were
represented only by statues placed in some temple or temple precinct, it is equally certain that some had a shrine or sanc
tuary of some kind specially erected in their honor. In
hymns, too, deities are mentioned that are otherwise unknown.
So in a litany, published by Craig, 3 a long series of gods is introduced. Some are identical with those included in the list
just referred to,
4 others appear here for the first time, as Mishiru,
Kilili Ishi-milku. Epithets also occur in lists and hymns,
that appear to belong to deities otherwise unknown. We are
safe, therefore, in estimating the number of temples, zikkurats, and smaller shrines in Babylonia and Assyria to have reached high into the hundreds. Sanctuaries must have covered the
Euphrates Valley like a network. By virtue of the older cul
ture of the south and the greater importance that Babylonia always enjoyed from a religious point of view, the sanctuaries of the south were much more numerous than those of the
north. For our purposes, it is sufficient to indicate some of
the most important of the temples of the south and north.
The oldest known to us at present is the frequently mentioned
temple of E-Kur at Nippur, sacred to En-lil or the older Bel.
Its history can be carried back to a period beyond 4000 B.C. ;
how far beyond cannot be determined until the early chronology

THE TEMPLES AND THE CULT. 645
is better known than at present. We know, however, that from
the time of Sargon 1 -and probably even much earlier, the rulers who had control of Nippur devoted themselves to the embellishment of the temple area. Climatic conditions necessitated
frequent repairs. The temple also suffered occasionally through political tumults, but with each century the religious importance of E-Kur was increased. Ur-Bau, we have seen, about 2700 i:.c., erected a zikkurat in .the temple area. Some centuries later
we find Bur-Sin repairing the zikkurat and adding a shrine near
the main structure. As the political fortunes of Nippur varied, so E-Kur had its ups and downs. Under the Cassitic rule, an
attempt was made to recover for Nippur the position which it
formerly occupied, but which had now passed over to Babylon. It was of little avail. Bel had to yield to Marduk, and yet,
despite the means that the priests of Marduk took to transfer
Bel's prerogatives to the new head of the pantheon, the rulers would not risk the anger of Bel by a neglect of E-Kur. Kuri
galzu, a king of the Cassite dynasty (c. 1400 B.C.) brings back from Elam 2 a votive object which, originally deposited by Dungi in the Ishtar temple at Erech, was carried to Susa by an Ela
mitic conqueror about 900 years before Kurigalzu. The latter deposits this object not in Marduk's temple at Babylon, but in Bel's sanctuary at Nippur. During the entire Cassitic period, the kings continued to build or make repairs in the temple pre
cinct, and almost every ruler is represented by more or less
costly votive offerings made to Bel's sanctuary. In this way, we can follow the history of the temple down to the Assyrian
period. In the twelfth century the religious supremacy of E-Kur yields permanently to E-Sagila. The temple is sacked, part of it is destroyed, and it was left to rulers of the north like Esarhaddon and Ashurbanabal to once more restore E-Kur
1 See Peters' Nippur, ii. chapter x, " The History of Nippur." 2 Ib. ii. 260. (Published in Hilprecht's Old Babylonian Inscriptions, i. i. pi. 21, no. 43. See also pi. 8, no. 15.)



646 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
and its dependencies to its former proportions. These kings, especially the latter, devote much time and energy in rebuilding the zikkurat and in erecting various buildings connected with the temple administration. Under the new Babylonian
dynasty, however, E-Kur was again destroyed, and this time by the ruthless hands of southern rulers. Nebuchadnezzar, so devoted to Marduk and Nabu, appears to have regarded E-Kur as a serious rival to E-Sagila and E-Zida. Some traces of
building operations at E-Kur appear to date from the Persian
period, but, practically, the history of E-Kur comes to an end at the close of the seventh century. The sanctity of the place,
however, remained ; a portion of the old city becomes a favorite burial site, while other parts continue to be inhabited till
the twelfth century of our era. The city of Bel becomes the
seat of a Christian bishop, and Jewish schools take the place
once occupied by the " star-gazers of Chaldea."
The history of E-Kur, so intimately bound up with political events, may be taken as an index of the fortunes that befell
the other prominent sanctuaries of Babylonia. The foundation of the Shamash temple at Sippar, and known
as E-Babbara, ' the brilliant house,' can likewise be traced as far back as the days of Naram-Sin. At that time there was
already a sanctuary to Anunit within the precincts of E-Bab
bara. Members of the Cassite dynasty devote themselves to
the restoration of this sanctuary. Through a subsequent invasion of the nomads, the cult was interrupted and the great
statue of Shamash destroyed. Several attempts are made to reorganize the cult, but it was left for Nabubaliddin in the
tenth century to restore E-Babbara to its former prestige.
Esarhaddon and Ashurbanabal, who pay homage to the old Bel at Nippur, also devote themselves to Shamash at Sippar.
They restore such portions of it as had suffered from the lapse of time and from other causes. Nebuchadnezzar is obliged to
rebuild parts of E-Babbara, and the last king of Babylonia,



THE TEMPLES AND THE CULT. 647
Nabonnedos, is so active in his building operations at Sippar that he arouses the anger of the priests of Babylon, who feel
that their ruler is neglecting the sanctuaries of1 Marduk and
Nabu. It is through Nabonnedos x and Nabubaliddin,2
chiefly, that we learn many of the details of the history of E-Babbara
during this long period. Of the other important temples that date from the early period of Babylonian history, we must content ourselves with
brief indications. The temple to Shamash at Larsa, while not quite as old as that of Sippar, was quite as famous. Its name was likewise E-Babbara. It is first mentioned in the inscriptions of Ur-Bau (c. 2700 B.C.), and it continues to enjoy the favor of the rulers
till the Persian conquest.3
The two chief places for the moon-cult were Ur and Harran. The name of Sin's temple 4 at the former place was
E-Gish-shir-gal,
' the house of the great light
'
; at the latter,
Erkhulklul,
* the house of joys.' Around both sanctuaries,
but particularly around the former, cluster sacred traditions. We have seen that the moon-cult at an early period enjoyed
greater importance than sun-worship. The temples of Sin were centers of intellectual activity. It is in these places that we may expect some day to find elaborate astronomical and
astrological records. Harran, indeed, does not appear at any time to have played any political role 5 (though it was overrun
occasionally by nomads), so that the significance of the place is due almost entirely to the presence of the great temple at
1 VR. 63. 2 VR. pis. 60, 61. 3 So, e.g., as late as the days of Nebopolassar (Scheil, Recueildes Travat(x,xviii. 16). 4 Besides this temple, there were two others, perhaps only chapels, dedicated to Sin at Ur : (a) E-te-im-ila (mentioned first by Ur-Bau, IR. pi. i, no 4), and (l>) E-Kharsag (mentioned first by Dungi, IR. 2, II. no. 2). The zikkurat at Ur had, of course, a special name (IIR. 50, obverse 18). 5 See Noldeke, Z.eitschrift fur Assyriologie, xi. 107-109. Hilprecht's theory (Old Babylonian Inscriptions, i. 2, 55) has not been accepted by scholars.



648 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
the place. It is Nabonnedos, 1 again, who endeavors to restore
the ancient prestige of the sanctuary at Harran. E-anna, ' the lofty house,' was the name of Ishtar's famous temple
at Erech. The mention of this temple in one of the creation
narratives 2 and the part played by Ishtar of Erech in the Gil
gamesh epic are sufficient indications of the significance of
this structure. Historical inscriptions from the earliest period to the days of Ashurbanabal and Nebuchadnezzar come to our further aid in illustrating the continued popularity of the Ishtar cult in E-anna. The Ishtar who survives in Babylonia and
Assyria is practically the Ishtar of Erech, that is, Nana.3
Passing by such sanctuaries as E-shid-lam, sacred to Nergal at Cuthah, and coming to E-Sagila and E-Zida, the two great
temples of Babylon and Borsippa, respectively, it is of course evident from the close connection between political develop
ment and religious supremacy, that Marduk's seat of worship occupies a unique position from the days of Hammurabi to the downfall of Babylonia. While the history of E-Sagila and E-Zida cannot be traced back further than the reign of Ham
murabi, the temples themselves are considerably older. Pre
vious to the rise of the city of Babylon as the political center, the Nabu cult in E-Zida must have been more prominent than
the worship of Marduk in E-Sagila. Marduk was merely one solar deity among several, and a minor one at that, whereas
the attributes of wisdom given to Nabu point to the intellec
tual importance that Borsippa had acquired. The Nabu cult was combined with the worship of Marduk simply because it could not be suppressed. At various times, as we have seen,4
Nabu formed a serious rival to Marduk, and it will be recalled
that up to a late period we find Nabu given the preference to Marduk in official documents.5 The inseparable association of

Y '//A TEMri.KS AND THE CULT. 649
E-Sagila and E-Zida is a tribute to Nabu which, we may feel
certain, the priests of Marduk did not offer willingly. But this
association becomes the leading feature 'in the history of the two temples. To pay homage to Marduk and Nabu meant
something quite different from making a pilgrimage to the seat
of Bel or presenting a gift to the Shamash sanctuary at Sippar. It was an acknowledgment of Babylonia's prestige. The Assyrian rulers regarded it as both a privilege and a solemn duty to come to Babylon and invoke the protection of Marduk and Nabu. In E-Sagila the installation of the rulers over Baby
lonia took place, and a visit to Marduk's temple was incom
plete without a pilgrimage across the river to E-Zida. The
influence exerted by these two temples upon the whole course
of Babylonian history from the third millennium on, can hardly
be overestimated. From the schools grouped around E-Sagila and E-Zida, went forth the decrees that shaped the doctrinal
development of the religion of Babylonia and Assyria. In these schools, the ancient wisdom was molded into the shape in
which we find it in the literary remains of the Euphrates Valley. Here the past was interpreted and the intellectual future of the
country projected. The thought of E-Sagila and E-Zida must have stored up emotions in the breast of a Babylonian and
Assyrian, that can only be compared to a pious Mohammedan's enthusiasm for Mecca, or the longing of an ardent Hebrew for Jerusalem. The hymns to Marduk and Nabu voice this emotion. There is a fervency in the prayers of Nebuchadnezzar which marks them off from the somewhat perfunctory invoca
tions of the Assyrian kings to Ashur and Ishtar. An appreci
ation of the position of E-Sagila and E-Zida in Babylonian history is an essential condition to an understanding of the
Babylonian-Assyrian religion. The priests of Marduk could view with equanimity the rise and growth of Assyria's power. The influence of E-Sagila and E-Zida was not affected by such
a shifting of the political kaleidoscope. Babylon remained the

religious center of the country. When one day, a Persian con
queror Cyrus entered the precincts of E-Sagila, his first step was to acknowledge Marduk and Nabu as the supreme powers in the world ; and the successors of Alexander continue to glory
in the title ' adorner of E-Sagila and E-Zida.' l With the same
zeal that distinguishes a good Babylonian, Antiochus Soter hastens to connect his reign with the two temples by busying
himself with their enlargement and beautification. There was
no better way in which he could indicate, at the same time, his
political control over the country. One more factor contributing to the general influence of the
Babylonian temples remains to be noted. In the course of
time, all the great temples in the large centers became large financial establishments. The sources whence the temples
derived their wealth were various. The kings both of Babylo
nia and Assyria took frequent occasions to endow the sanctuaries with lands or other gifts. At times, the endowment took
the form of certain quantities of wine, corn, oil, fruits, and the like, for which annual provision is made ; at times, the harvest
derived from a piece of property is set aside for the benefit of
the temple. In other ways, too, the temples acquired large holdings, through purchases of land made from the income accruing to it, and from the tithes which it became customary
to collect. This property was either farmed through the author
ities of the temple for the direct benefit of the sanctuary, or
was rented out to private parties under favorable conditions.
We learn of large bodies of laborers indentured to temples, as
well as of slaves owned or controlled by the temples. These
workmen were engaged for various purposes, for building
operations, for service in the fields, for working raw material, such as wool, into finished products, and much more the like.
But, more than this, the temples engaged directly in commercial affairs, lending sums of money and receiving interest. In some
1 So Antiochus Soter, VR. 66, col. i. 1. 3.



THE TEMPLES AND THE CULT. 651
sanctuaries, a thriving business of barter and exchange was carried on. Crops are sold, houses are rented by the temple agents, and there was scarcely an avenue of commerce into which the temples did not enter. An active business was also
carried on in the manufacture and sale of idols, votive offerings,
amulets, and the like. A very large number of the legal documents found in the Babylonian mounds deal with the business
affairs of the temples. 1 Such a state of affairs naturally con
tributed towards making the temples important establishments and towards increasing the influence of the priests over the
people.
The temples of Assyria play a minor part in the religious life of rulers and people. True, grand structures were reared in
Ashur, Calah, Nineveh, and Arbela, and no important step was taken by the kings without consulting Ashur, Ishtar, or Ramman through the mediation of the priests. The great cities of
Assyria also become intellectual centers. The priests of Arbela
created a school of theological thought, but all these efforts were but weak imitations of the example furnished by the tem
ples of the south. Even Ashurbanabal, whose ambition was to
make Nineveh the center of religious and intellectual progress,
failed of his purpose. His empire soon fell to decay, and
with that decay Nineveh disappears from the stage of history. Babylon and Borsippa, however, remain, and continue to hand down to succeeding generations, the wisdom of the past.
THE SACRED OBJECTS IN THE TEMPLES, ALTARS, VASES, IMAGES, BASINS, SHIPS.
The earliest altars were made of the same material as the
zikkurats and sanctuaries. One found at Nippur at an

exceedingly low level was of sun-dried bricks. 1 How early
this material was replaced by stone, we are not in a position to
say. Gudea, who imports diorite from the Sinai Peninsula to
make statues 2 of himself, presumably uses a similar material
for the sacred furnishings of his temples, though custom and conventionality may have maintained the use of the older clay material for some time. In Assyria, altars of limestone and
alabaster became the prevailing types. The shape and size of the altars varied considerably. The oldest known to us, the one found at Nippur, was about twelve feet long and half as wide. The upper surface was surrounded by a rim of bitumen.3 As
syrian altars now in the British museum are from two to three feet high. The ornamentation of the corners of the rim of the
altar led to giving the altar the appearance of horns. 4 The
base of the altar was either a solid piece with a circular or
oblong plate resting on it, or the table rested on a tripod. 5
The latter species was well adapted for being transported from
place to place by the Assyrian kings, who naturally were anxious to maintain the worship of Ashur and of other gods
while on their military expeditions. Much care was spent upon the ornamentation of the altars, and, if we may believe Herod
otus, the great altars at Babylon were made of gold.6 In front of the altars stood large vases or jars of terra cotta, used for ablutions and other purposes in connection with the sacrifices. Two such jars, one behind the other, were found at Nippur. They were ornamented with rope patterns, and the depth at which they were found is an indication of the antiquity and

Similar horns existed on the Hebrew and Phoenician altars. 5 See the illustrations in Perrot and Chipiez, i&., i. 194, 256, 257. On seal cylinders

THE TEMPLES AND THE CULT. 653
stability of the forms of worship in the Babylonian temples. It may be proper to recall that in the Solomonic temple, like
wise, there were a series of jars that stood near the great altar
in the large court. 1
A piece of furniture to which great religious importance was attached was a great basin known as '
apsu/ the name, it will be recalled, for 'the deep.' The name indicates that it
was a symbolical representation of the domain of Ea. In Gudea's days the symbol is already known, 2 and it continues in
use to the end of the Babylonian empire. The zikkurat itself
being, as we saw, an attempt to reproduce the shape of the earth, the representation of the ' apsu ' would suggest itself as a natural accessory to the temple. The zikkurat and the basin
together would thus become living symbols of the current cos
mological conceptions. Gudea already regards the zikkurat as a symbol. To make the ascent is a virtuous deed. 3 The
thought of adding a symbol of the apsu belongs, accordingly, to the period when this view of the zikkurat was generally
recognized. The shape of the e sea ' was oblong or round. It was cut of large blocks of stone and was elaborately decorated.
One of the oldest 4 has a frieze of female figures on it, holding
in their outstretched hands flagons from which they pour water. In Marduk's temple we learn that there were two basins, a larger and a smaller one. The comparison with the great ' sea ' that stood in the court of Solomon's temple naturally
suggests itself, and there can be little doubt that the latter is
an imitation of a Babylonian model. Another sacred object in the construction of which much care was taken was the ship in which the deity was carried in

solemn procession. It is again in the inscriptions of Gudea l that we come across the first mention of this ship. This ruler
tells us that he built the 'beloved ship' for Nin-girsu, and
gave it the name Kar-nuna-ta-uddua, the ship of ' the one that rises up out of the dam of the deep.' The ship of Nabu is of
considerable size, and is fitted out with a captain and crew, has masts and compartments. 2 The ship resembled a moon's
crescent, not differing much, therefore, from the ordinary flatbottomed Babylonian boat with upturned edges. Through Nebuchadnezzar 3 we learn that these ships were brilliantly studded
with precious stones, their compartments handsomely fitted out, and that in them the gods were carried in solemn procession on
the festivals celebrated in their honor.4 A long list 5 of such
ships shows that it was a symbol that belonged to all the great
gods. The ships of Nin-lil, Ea, Marduk, Sin, Shamash, Nabu,
Ninib, Bau, Nin-gal, and of others are specially mentioned. A custom of this kind of carrying the gods in ships must have orig
inated, of course, among a maritime people. We may trace it
back, therefore, to the very early period when the sacred cities of Babylonia lay on the Persian Gulf. The use of the ships also
suggests, that the solemn procession of the gods was originally on water and not on land, and it is likely that this excursion
of the gods symbolized some homage to the chief water-deity, Ea. However this may be, the early significance became lost, but the custom survived in Babylonia of carrying the gods
about in this way. In Assyria, less wedded to ancient tradi
tion, we find statues of the gods seated on thrones or standing
upright, carried directly on the shoulders of men.6 In Egypt
sacred ships are very common, and it is interesting to note as

THE TEAiri.ES AND THE CULT. 655
a survival of the old Babylonian and Egyptian custom that an annual gift sent by the khediye of Egypt to Mecca consists of
a tabernacle, known as Mahmal, that presents the outlines of a ship. 1 The ark of the Hebrews appears, similarly, to have been
originally a ship of some kind. The ships of the Babylonian gods had names given to them, just as the towers and sanctuaries had their names. The name of Nin-girsu's ship has already been mentioned. Marduk's
ship was appropriately known as Ma-ku-a, * the ship of the
dwelling.' 2 Similarly, a ship of the god Sin was called *
ship of light,' reminding one of the name of the great temple to the moon-god at Ur,
' the house of the great luminary.' The ship of Nin-gal, the consort of Sin, was called * the lesser light.' Bau's
ship was described by an epithet of the goddess as ' the ship
of the brilliant offspring,' the reference being to the descent of
the goddess from father Anu.3 These illustrations will suffice
to show the dependence of the names of the ships upon the
names of the temples, with this important difference, however, that the names of the ships are chosen from a closer associa
tion with the gods to whom they belong. So a ship of En-lil was known simply as ' the ship of Bel,' and the ship of Naru,4 the river-god, was called ' the ship of the Malku (or royal) canal ' 5 an indication, at the same time, of the place where the cult of Naru was carried on.
THE PRIESTS AND PRIESTESSES.
At a certain stage in the religious development of a people, the priesthood is closely linked to political leadership. The

656 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
earliest form of government in the Euphrates Valley is theo
cratic, and we can still discern some of the steps in the process that led to the differentiation of the priest from the secular
ruler. To the latest times, the kings retain among their titles
some 1 which have reference to the religious functions once exercised by them. The king who continued to be regarded as
the representative of a god, nominated by some deity to a lofty position of trust and power, stood nearer to the gods than his
subjects. In a certain sense, the king remained the priest par excellence. Hence the prominent part played by the ruler in
the religious literature of the country. A large proportion of the hymns were composed for royalty. The most elaborate ritual dealt with the endeavor to secure oracles that might
serve as a guide for the rulers. Astronomical reports were
made and long series of omen tablets prepared for the use of the royal household. The calendars furnished regulations for
the conduct of the kings. A ceremonial error, an offence
against the gods on the part of the kings, was certain of being followed by disastrous consequences for the whole
country. But even the smallest sanctuaries required some service, and
it was not long before the religious interests were entrusted into the hands of those who devoted themselves to administering the
affairs of the temples. The guardians of the shrines became
the priests in fact, long before the priesthood of the rulers became little more than a theory ; and as the temples grew to larger proportions, the service was divided up among various
classes of priests.
The general name for priests was shangu, which, by a plausible etymology suggested by Jensen, 2 indicates the function of the priest as the one who presides over the sacrifices. But this
1 E.g., ishakku. 2 Ska and naku, i.e.,
' the one over the sacrifice.' Zeitschrift fur Assyriologic, vii. 174, note.



THE TEMPLES AND THE CULT. 657
function represents only one phase of the priestly office in Babylonia, and not the most important one, by any means. For the people, the priest was primarily the one who could drive evil demons out of the body of the person smitten with disease, who could thwart the power of wizards and witches, who could ward off the attacks of mischievous spirits, or who could prognosticate the future and determine the intention or the will
of the gods. The offering of sacrifices was one of the means
to accomplish this end, but it is significant that many of the names used to designate the priestly classes have reference to
the priest's position as the exerciser of evil spirts or his power 'to secure a divine oracle or to foretell the future, and not to
his function as sacrifices Such names are mashmashu, the general term for ' the charmer '
; kalii, so called, perhaps, as the ' restrainer ' of the demons, the one who keeps them in
check; lagarit, a synonym of kalu ; makhkhii, 'soothsayer'; siirrfij a term which is still obscure ; sh&ilu, the '
inquirer,' who obtains an oracle through the dead or through the gods ;
mushehi, 'necromancer'; ashipu or ishippn, 'sorcerer.' 1 These names probably do not exhaust the various kinds of 'magicians
'
that were to be found among the Babylonian priests. In the
eighteenth chapter of Deuteronomy, no less than eleven classes of magic workers are enumerated, and there can be little doubt
but that the Pentateuchal opposition against the necromancers, sorcerers, soothsayers, and the like is aimed chiefly against
Babylonish customs. We have seen in previous chapters how largely the element of magic enters into the religious rites and
literature of the Babylonian- Assyrian religion and how persistent an element it is. For the masses, the priest remained essentially a mashmashu. But we have also names like ramku and nisakku,
' libation pourer,' which emphasize the sacrificial functions of
1 That these terms represent classes of priests is indicated by the fact that the
abstract derivatives shangiitu, kalutu, ishipputu, and also ramkutu (see below) are used as general terms for priesthood.

the priest ; and in an interesting list of temple servitors, 1 ' the
dirge singers
' are introduced as a special class, and appropri
ately designated as munambd, '
wailer,' and lallaru,
* howler.' Of some terms in this list, like asinnu, it is doubtful whether they
indicate a special class of priests or are terms for servitors in
general, attached to a temple ; in the case of others, like nash
pilakki,
* ax carrier,' we do not know exactly of what nature the
service was.2 Lastly, priests in their capacity as scribes 3 and
as judges 4 formed another distinct class, though it should be
noted that in Assyria we meet with scribes occasionally who
are not priests.

The range thus covered by the temple service, magic, ora
cles, sacrifices, the lament for the dead, and the judiciary, is
exceedingly large. The subdivisions, no doubt, varied in each center. In the smaller sanctuaries, those who offered the sac
rifices may also have served as soothsayers and dirge singers, and the judicial functions may likewise have been in the same
hands as those who performed other services. On the other
hand, in a temple like E-Sagila the classes and subclasses must have been very numerous. Of the details of the organization
we as yet know very little. There was a high priest, known as the shangam-makhu? and from the existence of a title like
sur-makhti, that is, the chief surru? we may conclude that each class of priests had its chief likewise. With the
natural tendency in ancient civilizations for professions to be
come vested in families, the priests in the course of time became a caste ; but there is no reason to believe that entrance
into this caste was only possible through the accident of birth.
That instruction in the reading and writing of the cuneiform characters, and hence the introduction into the literature, was

open to others than the scions of priests is shown by the pres
ence in the legal literature of formal contracts for instruction
between teachers and pupils who belong to the *
laity.' These pupils could become scribes and judges, and their standing as
'priests' represented merely the Babylonian equivalent to a modern university degree. For such service as the bewailing of the dead and as musicians, persons were initiated who were taken from various classes and likewise for the menial duties
of the temples, and it is only when we come to the more dis
tinctive priestly functions, like the exorcising of evil spirits, securing an oracle, or performing sacrifices, that the rules limiting these privileges to certain families were iron bound. As
among the Hebrews and other nations, stress was laid also upon freedom from physical, blemishes in the case of the
priests. The leper, we learn, was not fit for the priesthood. 1 In the astronomical reports that were spoken of in a previous chapter, 2 there are references to the ' watches ' kept by the
astronomers. These watches, however, were probably not observed for astronomical purposes alone, but represent the
time division, as among the Hebrews, for the temple service. There were three night watches among the Babylonians,3 and,
in all probability, therefore, three day watches likewise.
Relays of priests were appointed in the large sanctuaries for service during the continuance of each watch, and we may some day find that the Hebrews obtained their number of
twenty-four priests for each ' watch ' from a custom prevailing
in some Babylonian temple. An interesting feature of the Babylonian priesthood is the position occupied by the woman. In the historical texts from the days of Hammurabi onward, the references to women

660 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
attached to the service of temples are not infrequent. Gudea
expressly mentions the 'wailing women,' and there is every reason to believe that the female wailers, like the male ones,
belong to some priestly class. Again, examples of women as exorcisers and as furnishing oracles l may be instanced in
Babylonia as well as in Assyria, and we have also references to
female musicians as late as the days of Ashurbanabal. A
specially significant role was played by the priestesses in Ishtar's temple at Erech, and probably at other places where the cult of the great mother goddess was carried on. The
Ishtar priestess was known by the general term of Kadishtu,
that is, 'the holy one,' or Ishtaritum, 'devoted to Ishtar'; but, from the various other names for the sacred harlot that we
come across,2 it would appear that the priestesses were divided
into various classes, precisely like the priests. That in the
ceremonies of initiation at Erech, and perhaps elsewhere, some rites were observed that on the surface appeared obscene
is eminently likely ; but there is no evidence that obscene
rites, as instanced by Herodotus, formed part of the regular cult of the goddess. Except in the case of the Ishtar wor
ship, the general observation may be made that the position of
the priestess is more prominent in the early period of Babylonian history than in the days when the culture and power of
Babylonia and Assyria reached its zenith.
SACRIFICES AND VOTIVE OFFERINGS.
The researches of Robertson Smith 3 and of others have shown that the oldest Semitic view of sacrifice was that of a meal, shared by the worshipper with the deity to be honored or

propitiated. Dependent as we are in the case of the Babylonian-Assyrian religion for our knowledge of sacrifices upon incidental references in historical or religious texts, it is not
possible to say how far the Semitic dwellers of the Euphrates
Valley were influenced by the primitive conception of sacrifice.
Historical and votive inscriptions and a religious literature
belong to a comparatively advanced stage of culture, and earlier views of sacrifice that may have existed were necessarily
modified in the process of adaptation to later conditions. The
organization of an elaborate cult with priests and numerous
temple servitors changes the sacrifices into a means of income
for the temple. The deity's representatives receive the share originally intended for the deity himself ; and, instead of
sanctifying the offering to a god by contact with the sacred
element fire, the temple accepts the offering for its own use.
It is likely, however, that among the Babylonians, as among the Hebrews, certain parts of the animal which were not fit to
eat l were burned as a symbolical homage to a god. No refer
ences have as yet been found pointing to any special sanctity that was attached to the blood; but it is eminently likely that
the blood was regarded at all times as the special property of the gods, and was poured on the altar. The two kinds of
sacrifice animals and vegetable products date from the
earliest period of the Babylonian religion of which we have
any knowledge. In a long list of offerings, Gudea 2 includes
oxen, sheep, goats, lambs, fish, birds (as eagles, cranes, 3
etc.), and also such products as dates, milk, and greens. From
other sources we may add gazelles, date wine, butter, cream,
honey, garlic, corn, herbs, oil, spices, and incense. Stress is laid upon the quality of the sacrifice. 4 The animals must be

without blemish, and if well nurtured, they would be all the more pleasing in the sight of the gods. The omission of dogs and swine is not accidental. Under that double aspect of
sanctity which we find among the Babylonians as among so many nations, certain animals were too sacred to be offered,
and, on the other hand, they were regarded as unclean. 1 In treating of the omen texts we already had occasion to speak of
the peculiar ideas attached to the dog by the Babylonians, 2 and there is sufficient evidence to show that the boar likewise
was viewed as a sacred animal, at least in certain parts of
Babylonia. 3 No certain traces of human sacrifices have been
found, either in Babylonian literature or in artistic representa
tions. 4 If the rite was ever practised among the Babylonians
or Assyrians it must have been at a very early period earlier than any of which we as yet have any knowledge. On the
other hand, a trace of some primitive form of tree worship may
be recognized in the representation, so frequent on seal cylinders and monuments, of curious figures, in part human, in part animal, standing in front of the palm tree. 5 The symbol
belongs to Assyria as well as to Babylonia. In some of the designs the figures human heads and bodies but furnished
with large wings appear to be in the act of artificially fertilizing the palm tree by scattering the male blossom over the
female palm. This plausible interpretation first suggested by E. B. Tylor 6 carries with it the conclusion that the importance

THE TEMl'LES AND THE CULT. 663
of palm culture in the Euphrates Valley not only gave the palm the character of a sacred tree, but lent to the symbol a
wider significance to a more advanced age, as illustrating fer
tility and blessings in general. The scene, reproduced in almost endless variations in which both trees and figures become
conventionalized, came to be regarded as a symbol of adora
tion and worship in general. As such, it survived in religious art and continued to be pictured on seal cylinders to a late age. The occasions on which sacrifices were brought were
frequent. If the gods were to be consulted for the purpose
of obtaining an oracle, elaborate offerings formed a necessary preliminary. In this case, the animals presented at the altar served a double purpose. 1 They constituted a means of
propitiating the god in favor of the petitioner, and at the same
time the inspection of certain parts of the animal served as an
omen in determining what was the will of the god appealed to. When the foundations were to be laid for a temple or a palace,
it was especially important to secure the favor of the gods by
suitable offerings, and, similarly, when a canal was to be built or any other work of a public character undertaken. Again,
upon the dedication of a sacred edifice or of a palace, or upon
completing the work of restoration of a temple, sheep and oxen in abundance were offered to the gods, as well as various
kinds of birds and the produce of the orchards and fields.
The Babylonian rulers appear to have accompanied their sacrifices on such occasions with prayers, and in a previous
chapter we had occasion to discuss some of these dedicatory
invocations. 2 In the Assyrian inscriptions, prayers are specifically referred to only as being offered before setting out on an
expedition, before a battle, or when the kings find themselves
in distress, 3 so that if the Babylonian custom likewise prevailed

664 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
in Assyria, it did not form a necessary part of the sacrificial
ritual. The sacrifice as a pure homage is illustrated by the
zeal which the Assyrian kings manifest towards honoring the great temples of the south. The northern rulers were anxious at all times to reconcile the southern population to Assyrian
control, and it was no doubt gratifying to the south to find
Tiglathpileser II.,
1 upon entering the ancient centers like
Sippar, Nippur, Babylon, Borsippa, Cuthah, Kish, Dilbat, and Erech, proceeding to the temples in those places in order to offer his sacrifices. The example of Tiglathpileser is followed by his successors down through the time of Ashurbanabal. As often as the Assyrian monarchs may have had occasion to
proceed to Babylonia and the occasions were frequent, owing to the constant disposition of the south to throw off the
hated yoke they emphasized their devotion to Marduk, Nabu, En-lil, Shamash, and the other gods who had their seats in the south. Sargon 2 goes so far in this homage as
to pose as the reorganizer of the cults of Sippar, Nippur, Bor sippa, and Babylon, and of restoring the income to temples in other places. 3 But there was another side to this homage
that must not be overlooked. By sacrificing in the Babylonian
temples, the Assyrian rulers indicated their political control
over the south. Such homage as they manifested was the
exclusive privilege of legitimate rulers, and it was important for the Assyrians to legitimize their control over the south.
A phase of sacrifice is represented by the libations of oil
and wine to which frequent references are found in the
historical texts. It appears to have been customary to anoint
the foundation stones of temples and palaces with oil and wine. Over the thresholds, too, and over the stones bearing commemorative or votive inscriptions libations of oil, honey, and wine were poured.

THE TEMPLES AND THE CULT. 665
Nebopolassar 1 speaks of placing sweet herbs under the walls, and Nabonnedos 2 pours oil over the bolts and doors, as well as on the thresholds of the Shamash temple at Sippar, and
fills the temple with the aroma of frankincense. Much impor
tance was attached to this rite, and the kings take frequent occasion to adjure their successors who may in the course of
restoring edifices come across stones bearing the record of former builders, to anoint these stones with oil and offer
sacrifices. 3 Thus, Nabonnedos, 4 when he finds the inscription of Ashurbanabal in the Shamash temple at Sippar, carefully
obeys the injunction. The rite bears all the marks of great antiquity. The instances of its occurrence in the Old Testa
ment notably in the case of Jacob's act of pouring oil over the holy stone at Bethel 5 confirm this view; and the inter
pretation for the rite suggested by Robertson Smith 6 that the
oil was originally the fat of the sacrificed animal smeared over
an object or a person, as a means of investing them with
sanctity, accounts satisfactorily for the invariable juxtaposition in the cuneiform texts of sacrificial offerings with the anoint
ing of the inscribed stones.
We have no evidence that the rulers of Babylonia and
Assyria were anointed with oil on their installation, though it is not improbable that such was the case. The use of the
oil in this case is but a modification of the same rite, which, it
is to be noted, loses some of its ancient force by the spread of
the custom in the Orient of unguents as a part of the toilet. 7
The use of odorous herbs, which, we have seen, were placed
under the walls, and of honey and wine, which were poured
over bolts, 8 is also directly connected with the sacrificial cult.

The libation in its purer form appears in the custom of the
Assyrian kings of pouring wine over the animal slain by them in the hunt. The act is intended to secure divine favor towards a deed which involved the destruction of something that by all
ancient nations was held sacred, namely, life. Even a despot
of Assyria felt that to wantonly destroy life could not be safely undertaken without making sure of the consent of the gods.
Significantly enough, Ashurbanabal offers his libations after
the lion or bull hunts to Ishtar as the "goddess of battle." 1
The animal is sanctified by being devoted to a goddess, just
as the victims in a battle constitute the conqueror's homage
offered to the gods who came to his assistance.
Sacrifices with libations are so frequently represented on the
seal cylinder that this testimony alone would suffice to vouch
for the importance attached to this rite in the cult. One of
the most archaic specimens of Babylonian art 2 represents a worshipper, entirely naked, pouring a libation into a large cup which stands on an altar. Behind the altar sits a goddess who
is probably A or Malkatu, the consort of the sun-god. The naked worshipper is by no means an uncommon figure in the
early Babylonian art, 3 and it would appear that at one time it
was customary to remove one's garments preliminary to stepping into the god's presence, just as among the Arabs the cult of the Caaba in Mecca was conducted by the worshippers at
an early period without their clothes. 4 The custom so frequently referred to in the Old Testament to remove one's shoes
upon entering sacred territory, a custom still observed by the modern Muslim, who leaves his shoes outside of the Mosque,
may be regarded as an indication, that at an earlier period
people removed their garments as well as the sandals. It may

THE TEMPLES AND THE CULT. 667
be that the order to take off the sandal alone, as recorded
in the Old Testament, is nothing but a euphemistic phrase
(suggested by a more refined age) to strip oneself. Certainly, when we find that in the days of Saul, the seers went about
naked, there can no longer be any doubt that there was a time
when the Hebrews, too, like the Arabs and Babylonians, entered the holy presence naked.
The institution of daily sacrifices is vouched for in the case
of the larger religious centers like Babylonia, Borsippa, Sippar, Cuthah, as well as Nineveh for the late periods. Nebuchad
nezzar, for example, tells us 1 that he provided for a sacrifice of
six lambs daily in the temple E-shidlam at Cuthah, sacred to
Nergal and Laz ; while for Nabu's temple at Borsippa, the
daily sacrifices were arranged on a still larger scale, and included two fattened bulls of perfect form, sixteen smaller
animals, besides offerings of fish, birds, leek, various kinds of
wine, honey, cream, and the finest oil, all intended, as the king tells us, for the table of Nabu and his consort. No doubt the
daily official sacrifices at Marduk's temple were even more
elaborate. The custom of regular sacrifices in the larger tem
ples may be traced back to an early period. The technical terms for such sacrifices are sattuku and ginfi. Both terms
convey the idea of being " fixed," perpetual, 2 and suggest a comparison with the Pentateuchal institution of the tamid? i.e.,
the daily sacrifice. Whenever the kings in their inscriptions mention the regular sacrifices, it is in almost all cases with reference to their reinstitution of an old custom that had been
allowed to fall into neglect (owing to political disturbances which always affected the temples), and not as an innovation.
Innovations were limited to increasing the amounts of these

668 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
regular sacrifices. So, for example, Nabubaliddin restores and increases the gine of the great temple E-babbara at Sippar. 1
But regular sacrifices do not necessarily involve daily offerings.
The same terms, ginu and sattfiku, are applied frequently to
monthly offerings, and except in the large religious centers, regular sacrifices were in all probabilities brought on certain
days of each month, and not daily. The days thus singled out, as will be shown further on, differed for various sanctu
aries. It would be important if we could determine the share
in these regular sacrifices taken by the people at large, but the
material at hand does not suffice for settling the question.
There are frequent references to tithes in the clay tablets
forming part of the archives of temples, and monthly tributes
are also mentioned. We certainly may conclude from these references that the people were taxed in some way for the sup
port of the temples. Ashurbanabal in one place speaks of
reimposing upon the population of the south the provision for the sattfiku and ginu due to Ashur and Belit 2 and the gods of
Assyria; but, for all that, it is not certain that the regular sac
rifices at the temples partook of a popular character. One
gains the impression that, except on the occasions when the people came to the sanctuaries for individual purposes, the
masses as such had but comparatively little share in it. In
this respect the cult of the Hebrews, which has so many points
in common with the Babylonian ritual as to justify the hypoth
esis that the details of sacrificial regulations in the priestly
code are largely derived from practices in Babylonian temples, was more democratic. Closely attached as the Babylonians
were to their sanctuaries, the regular sacrifices do not appear
to have been an active factor in maintaining this attachment.
A more decidedly popular character is apparent in the votive
offerings made to the temples. These offerings cover a wide

THE TEMPLES AND THE CULT. 669
range. Rulers and people alike felt prompted to make gifts to the sanctuaries on special occasions, either as a direct homage
to the gods or with the avowed purpose and hope of securing divine favor or divine intercession.
The statues of themselves which the rulers from the days of Gudea 1 on were fond of erecting were dedicated by them as
offerings to the gods, and this avowed aim tempers, in a meas
ure, the vanity which no doubt was the mainspring of their action. The statues were placed in the temples, and from Gudea 2 we learn of the elaborate ceremonies connected with
the dedication of one of the king's colossal blocks of diorite.
For seven days all manual labor was interrupted in Lagash. Masters and slaves shared in the festivities. The temple of
Nin-girsu is sanctified anew by purification rites, and the statue
is formally presented to the god amidst sacrifices and offerings of rich gifts. The account given in the Book of Daniel 3 of the dedication of Nebuchadnezzar's statue may be regarded as an
equally authentic picture of a custom that survived to the clos
ing days of the Babylonian monarchy, except that we have no proof that divine honors were paid to these statues.4 The front, sides, and back of Gudea's images were covered with
inscriptions, partly of a commemorative character, but in part,
also, conveying a dedication to Nin-girsu. Similarly, the steles of the Assyrian kings, set up by them either in the temples or on the highways beyond the confines of Assyria, and which
had images of the rulers sculptured on them in high relief, were covered with inscriptions, devoted primarily to celebrat
ing the deeds of the kings ; but, since the victories of the armies were ascribed to the assistance furnished by the gods,
an homage to Ashur or some other deity was involved in the

recital. That the gods were accorded a minor share of the
glory was but in keeping with the pride of the Assyrian rulers, who were less affected than the rulers of the south by the
votive character of the statues.
Both Babylonians and Assyrians, however, unite in making images of the gods as a distinct homage, and in giving elabo
rate presents of gold, silver, precious stones, costly woods, and garments to the sanctuaries as votive offerings to the gods. These presents were used in the decoration of temples and
shrines, as well as of the statues of the gods or as direct con
tributions to the temple treasury. Celebrations of victories
were chosen as particularly appropriate occasions for making such votive offerings. So Agumkakrimi, upon bringing back to E-Sagila the statues of Marduk and Sarpanitum that had
been taken away by ruthless hands, bestows rich gifts upon
the temples and describes J at great length the costly garments embroidered with gold and studded with precious stones that were hung on Marduk and his consort. Equally vivid is the
description of the high, conical-shaped caps, made of lapis lazuli and gold, and decorated, furthermore, with various kinds of stones, that were placed on the heads of the deities. Gar
ments for the statues of the gods appear to have been favorite
votive offerings at all times. Nabubaliddin, in restoring the cult of Shamash at Sippar, makes provisions for an elaborate
outfit of garments, 2 specifying different garments for various
periods of the year. It would appear from this that for the
various festive occasions of the year, the garments of the gods
were changed, much as in other religions including the Catholic Church the officiating priests are robed in different garments on the various festive or solemn occasions.

inscriptions 'were deposited in the temples. What particular purpose they served we do not know. As a specimen of the
more common formula on these tablets, a lapis lazuli tablet of
Nippur may be chosen. It is offered by a Cassite king, and
reads l as follows : To Bel His lord
Kadashman-Turgu For his life Presented.
A knob-shaped object 2 of fine limestone contains a dedication
in similar phrases to Marduk. It is offered by Bel-epush, who
is probably identical with a Babylonian ruler of this name in
the seventh century, a contemporary of Sennacherib: 3
To Marduk, his lord
Bel-epush for the preservation of his life Made and presented.
Kings, however, do not appear to be the only ones for whom
these votive offerings were prepared. A dedication to a
personage otherwise unknown and to all appearances a layman reads :
4
To Ea,5 his lord, Bel-zir, Son of Ea-ban, For the preservation of his life
Made and presented.
The formulas are thus seen to be conventional ones, though
occasionally the inscription is somewhat longer. So, for example, Nazi-Maruttash, another Cassite king, puts a little
prayer on a votive offering:
1 Hilprecht, Old Babylonian Inscriptions, i. i, pi. 23, no. 62. - In the museum at Copenhagen. Described by Knudtzon in the Zeits.f. Assyr., xii. 255.
3 Tiele, Babylonisch-Assyrische Geschichte, p. 287. 4 In the Berlin Museum (Knudtzon, ib.). It is also on a knob which contains remains of an iron stick, to which, evidently, the knob was fastened. 5 Written A-e.

[To Bel, his lord] * Nazi-Maruttash, Son of Kurigalzu, To hearken to his supplication, To be favorable to his prayer,
To accept his entreaty, To lengthen his days, [He made and presented].
This inscription appears, as Dr. Hilprecht informs us, 1 on an ax made of imitation lapis lazuli. 2 Other votive inscriptions are found on rings and on knobs of ivory or magnesite.3 These
various designs no doubt all had some symbolical significance. The ring suggests some ultimate connection between votive
offerings and amulets. The seal cylinders, we know, although put to practical use in impressing the design on a clay tablet as a substitute for a personal signature, were also regarded as
amulets, and this accounts for the frequency with which
scenes of religious worship were introduced as designs on
the cylinders. The ring is distinctly an amulet in Babylonia as elsewhere, and hence it is by no means improbable that the custom of carrying little inscribed tablets, discs, or knobs about
the person as a protection against mischances preceded the use of such tablets as votive offerings to be placed in a temple.
A very common votive object in Babylonia, especially in the earlier period, was the clay cone. Such cones were found in large numbers at Lagash, while at Nippur Peters came across
what may be safely regarded as a magazine where such cones (and other votive objects) were manufactured in large numbers. 4 The cones of Gudea bear conventional inscriptions of a
votive character addressed to Nin-girsu. In other temples,

other gods were similarly remembered. It has been customary
to regard these cones as phallic symbols ;
l but it should be noted that not only is the evidence for this lacking, but that
what we know of the popular practices of the Babylonians does not warrant us in assuming any widespread phallic symbolism. The point of the cones suggests rather that the objects were intended to be stuck into the ground or into walls. At Lagash
De Sarzec found, besides cones, a large number of copper
statuettes 2 of gods and goddesses and of animals, chiefly bulls, all terminating in a sharp point or attached to a cone
shaped object. Others again are clearly human figures, either male personages holding the cone in their hands,3 or females
holding baskets on their heads, the customary attitude of
making an offering. These curious statuettes frequently bear inscriptions of a votive character, and there can be no doubt that they were used to be stuck into some substance. At one
place, De Sarzec found a series set up in concentric circles 4 in
the corners of an edifice and under the floor. Heuzey is of the
opinion that these statuettes thus arranged were to serve as a
warning for the demons, but it is more in keeping with the gen
eral character of the Babylonian religion to look upon these
objects simply as votive offerings placed at various parts of a building as a means of securing the favor of the gods. The cone, I venture to think, is merely the conventionalized shape of a
votive object originally intended to be stuck into some part of a
sacred building. The large quantity of cones that have been found at Lagash, Nippur, and elsewhere is an indication of
their popular use. It is not improbable that at one time, and, at all events, in certain temples, the cones and statuettes
represented the common votive offerings with which worshippers

provided themselves upon entering the sacred precinct. To facilitate the reproduction of the statuettes, moulds were used, another indication of the widespread use of these objects.
Clay figures of gods and goddesses were also made in moulds or modelled by hand and served as votive offerings. At
Nippur, the images represent chiefly Bel and Belit, 1 either separately or in combination ; but figurines of Ishtar have also
been found.'2 In some the goddess is represented as suckling a child. Often she is pictured as naked, clasping her breasts or her womb. The attitude which was suggested by the character
of the goddess as the promoter of fertility appears to have been too obscene to a more refined age, and, accordingly, we find in
later times the sexual parts suppressed or the figure properly clothed. The character of these figurines varied naturally
with each religious center, and even in the same center modifications were introduced.
Whether these clay figurines, cones, and metallic statuettes
were also placed by individuals in their dwellings, like the
" plague " tablets, 3 we cannot as yet definitely say, but it is more than likely that such was the case. The teraphim familiar to us from the references in the Old Testament,4 and
evidently used as talismans, belong to the class of votive offerings under consideration. The figurines and cones, and also
(though to a smaller degree) the copper statuettes, thus introduce us to the popular phases of the cult. As symbols of
homage they appear to have survived to a late period, and
their use as talismans did not materially affect their character
as offerings, made by the people upon seeking the sanctuaries. The more costly objects, as vases,5

other furniture for the temples were left to the rulers. Such
offerings were made with great pomp. They were formally dedicated by large processions of priests, with the accompaniment of hymns and music. The kings of Assyria presented the captured gods as votive gifts pleasing to their deity.
1 They bring back with them from their campaigns the beams of the
edifices that they destroyed and offer them to Ishtar.2 Upon
coming to Babylonia, they do not fail to bring presents of gold,
silver, precious stones, copper, iron, purple, precious garments, and scented woods to Marduk and Sarpamtum, to Nabu and
Tashmitum, and the other great gods.3 The first fruits of extensive groves are offered by Ashurnasirbal to Ashur and the
temples of his land.4 The rulers of Assyria vie with the kings
of Babylonia in presenting gardens 5 and lands to the gods as votive offerings ; but for all that, in ancient Babylonia and
Assyria, as among other peoples of antiquity, the more fervent religious spirit was manifested in the small tokens of the masses, whose attachment to the temples was of a different order from that which prompted the rulers of the north and south to a display, in which vanity and the desire to manifest
their power play a larger part as one generation succeeds the other.
FESTIVALS.
We have seen 6 that in the developed system of the Baby
lonian religion, every day of the year had some significance, and
that certain days in each month so, e.g., the yth, i/j-th, igth,
2ist, and 28th had a special significance. It has also been pointed out that in different religious centers, the days singled out for special significance differed. In view of this, we must

676 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
be prepared to find that the festival days were not the same
in all parts of Babylonia, nor necessarily identical in the vari
ous periods of Babylonian and Assyrian history. The common name for festival was isinnu. If we may judge from the use of assinnu as a general name for priest,
1a
servant of a deity, the underlying stem appears to signify simply
* to serve.' Another name that reveals more as to the
character of the Babylonian festivals is tashiltu, which is used
as a synonym for 'joy, delight.' The festivals were indeed
joyous occasions, marked by abundance of offerings and merrymaking, though, as we shall see, the somber note in the rejoicings was not absent. The kings dedicate their temples and
palaces amidst manifestation of rejoicing. They pray that the
gods may occupy the dwellings prepared for them " in joy and jubilance," 2 and the reference to festivals in the historical texts
are all of such a character as to make us feel that the Baby
lonian could apppreciate the Biblical injunction to "
rejoice " in the divine presence, on the occasions set apart as, in a
peculiar sense, sacred. Defective as our knowledge of the ancient Babylonian festivals still is, the material at our disposal shows that at a com
paratively early period, there was one day in the year on which a festival was celebrated in honor of a god or goddess that had a more important character than any other. In the devel
oped zodiacal system of Babylonia each month is sacred to a
deity.
4 This system was perfected under the direct influence
of the theological schools of Babylonia, but so much of it,
at all events, rests upon ancient traditions which assigns a month to each god; and since Marduk is not accorded the
first place, but takes his position in a group of solar deities,
1 See above, p. 658. 2 This is a standing phrase in the inscriptions of Nebuchadnezzar, as well as of other kings. See Delitzsch, Assyr. Handivorterbuch, p. 2;ob. 3 Deut. xii. 18: xvi. 14, etc.
4 See pp. 462, 463.



77/A TEMPLES AND THE CULT. 677
and since, moreover, these solar deities have a position in the
calendar which accords with their specific solar character, 1 we may proceed a step further and assume with some confidence
that the Babylonian scholars were guided in large part, at least by ancient traditions in parceling out the months as
they did. Anu, Bel, and Ea, it is true, may have been assigned to the first three months because of the preeminent position of
these three gods as a special triad ; but even here the antiquity of the triad furnishes a guarantee that the association of some
month with some deity belongs to a very ancient period of
Babylonian history. This being the case, it would be natural that the first day of the month sacred to a deity would be
regarded as his or her festival par excellence, and in the case
of the cult of a deity spreading beyond its original limits, this festival would assume a more general character. On this day the people would come from all parts of the district within
which the cult was carried on, to pay their homage to the god
or goddess. In the days of Gudea, we find Bau occupying this superior rank. Her festival had assumed such importance as to serve for reckoning the commencement of the year. Hence it became known simply as the day of zag-muku,2 that is, the New Year's Day. 3 Whether this festival of Bau was
recognized as the New Year's Day throughout Babylonia, we do not know, but it must have been observed in a considerably extensive district, or Gudea would have made the attempt to give some festival connected with his favorite deity Nin
girsu this character. As it is, he can only combine Bau's
festival with the cult of Nin-girsu, by making the New Year's
Day the occasion of a symbolical marriage between the god
and the goddess. Nin-girsu is represented as offering marriage

gifts to Bau, 1 on the Zagmuku. How early Bau came to occupy so significant a rank has not been ascertained. It is her
quality as the '
great mother,' as the goddess of fertility and abundance, 2 rather than any political supremacy of the district in which she was worshipped, that constitutes the chief factor
in giving Bau this preeminence, just as we have found in
the case of the other great goddesses of Babylonia, Nina, Nana, Ishtar, specific traits and not political importance
lending them the significance they acquired. At one time we may well suppose that the festival of En-lil
at Nippur, which brought worshippers from all parts of Babylonia, was recognized as a ' New Year's Day,' and we may some day find evidence that at a still earlier period the first
day of a month sacred to -some other god, Sin or Shamash
or Nana-Ishtar of Erech, was recognized in some districts
as the starting-point for the year ; but to an agricultural community, the spring, when the seeds are sown, or the fall, after the harvest has been gathered, are the two most natural periods
for reckoning the beginning of the year. Since we know that
at the time when Babylon acquired her supremacy the year began in the spring, the conservatism attaching to religious observances makes it more than probable that Bau's festival
also fell in the spring.
After the ancient religious and political centers of the south
yielded their privileges to Babylon, it was natural for the
priests of Marduk to covet the honor of the New Year's festival
for the new head of the pantheon. Accordingly, we find the Zagmuku transformed into a Marduk festival. That it did not
originally belong to Marduk follows from the fact that it was
celebrated in the month of Nisan, the first month, whereas the month sacred to Marduk was Arakh-shamna (or Marcheshwan), the eighth month. The deliberate transfer of the
1 Inscription G, ib., and Inscription D, col. ii. 11. 1-9. See also p. 59. 2 See above, ib.



yyy/s TEMPLES AND THE CULT. 679
Zagmuku to Marduk is also indicated by the fact that the festival of Nisan has another name by which it is more commonly designated, Akitu. 1 The name seems to have been
originally a general term for a festival, and it is natural that Marduk's festival should have come to be known as the fes
tival, just as among the Hebrews the annual fall pilgrimage to
the sanctuary at Jerusalem became known as the Hag, the
pilgrimage par excellence. To distinguish it from other festivals, Marduk's festival is sometimes spoken of as the "great" or
the "
lofty
" Akitu. The first day was properly the Zagmuku, whereas the Akitu itself extended at least over the first eleven
days of Nisan 2 and may indeed have lasted the entire month;
but Zagmuku was also used for the festival period. The New Year's Day was marked by a solemn procession. The union of Nabu and Marduk was symbolized by a visit which the
former paid to his father, the chief of the Babylonian pantheon.
In his ship, magnificently fitted out, 3 Nabu was carried along
the street known as Ai-ibur-shabu, 4 leading from Borsippa
across the Euphrates to Babylon. The street was handsomely paved, 5 and everything was done
to heighten the impressiveness of the ceremony. The visit of Nabu marked the homage of the gods to Marduk ; and Nabu
set the example for other gods, who were all supposed to
assemble in E-Sagila during the great festival. We have
already pointed out that the cult of Nabu at Borsippa at one time was regarded with greater sanctity than the Marduk worship in Babylon. As a concession to the former supremacy
of Nabu, the priests of E-Sagila, carrying the statue of Marduk, escorted Nabu back to Borsippa. The return visit raises the
suspicion that it was originally Marduk who was obliged to pay an annual homage to Nabu.

680 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
However this may be, the double ceremony became to such an extent the noteworthy feature of the Zagmuku or Akitu that when the chroniclers wish to indicate that, because of political
disturbances, the festival was not celebrated, they use the simple formula : Nabu did not come to Babylon. Bel [i.e., Marduk] did not march out.1
The Akitu festival brought worshippers from all parts of
Babylonia and Assyria to the capitol. Kings and subjects alike paid their devotions to Marduk. The former approached
the divine presence directly, and, seizing hold of the hands of Marduk's statue, were admitted into a kind of covenant with
the god. The ceremony became the formal rite of royal instal
lation in Babylonia. " To seize the hands of Bel " was equiva
lent to legitimizing one's claim to the throne of Babylonia, and
the chroniclers of the south consistently decline to recognize
Assyrian rulers as kings of Babylonia until they have come to Babylon and "seized the hands of Bel." 2 That this ceremony
was annually performed by the kings of Babylonia after the union of the southern states is quite certain. It marked a renewal of the pledge between the king and his god. The
Assyrian kings, however, contented themselves, with a single visit. Of Tiglathpileser II. 3 and Sargon, 4 we know that they
came to Babylonia for the purpose of performing the old ceremony j and others did the same. The eighth and eleventh days of the festival month were

invested with special sanctity. On these days all the gods
were brought together in the " chamber of fates " of Marduk's
temple. In symbolical imitation of the assembly of the gods in Ubshu-kenna,1 Marduk sits on his throne and the gods
are represented as standing in humble submission before him, while he decrees the fates of mankind for the coming year.
The Zagmuku festival in its developed form has striking points of resemblance to the Jewish New Year's Day. On this day,
according to the popular Jewish tradition, God sits in judgment
with a book before Him in which He inscribes the fate of man
kind. Nine days of probation are allowed, and on the tenth day the Day of Atonement the fates are sealed. The
Jewish New Year is known as Rosh-hash-shana,2 which is an
exact equivalent of the Babylonian rcsh shafti (or zag-muku).
A difference, however, between the Babylonian and the Jewish festival is that the latter is celebrated in the seventh month.
It is not correct, therefore, to assume that the Hebrews borrowed their Rosh-hash-shana from the Babylonians. Even after
they adopted the Babylonian calendar, 3 they continued to regard the seventh month the harvest month as the beginning of
the year. That among the Babylonians the seventh month also had a sacred character may be concluded from the mean
ing of the ideographs with which the name is written. 4 The
question may, therefore, be raised whether at an earlier period
and in some religious center Nippur, Sippar, or perhaps Ur the seventh month may not have been celebrated as the
Zagmuku. At all events, we must for the present assume that the Hebrews developed their New Year's Day, which they
may have originally received from Babylonia, independently of Marduk's festival, though, since the Rosh-hash-shana does not
come into prominence among the Jews until the period of the

so-called Babylonian exile, the possibility of a direct Babylonian influence in the later conceptions connected with the day cannot be denied. 1
Of the other festivals of the Babylonians and Assyrians but few details are known. Several references have already been
made to the Tammuz festival. 2 Originally a solar festival, celebrated in the fourth month at the approach of the summer
solstice, it became through the association of ideas suggested by the mourning of Ishtar for her lost consort Tammuz a kind of 'All Souls' Day,' on which the people remembered their
dead. Dirges were sung by the wailing women to the accom
paniment of musical instruments; offerings were made to the dead, and it is plausible to assume that visits were paid to
the graves. The mourning was followed .by a festival of
rejoicing, symbolizing the return of the solar-god. The Tammuz festival appears to have had a strong hold upon the
masses, by reason of the popularity of the Tammuz myth ; nor was it limited to the Babylonians. Among the Phoenicians the cult of Tammuz, known by his title Adon (whence Adonis), was maintained to a late period, and the Hebrews,
likewise, as late as the days of Ezekiel, 3 commemorated with rites of mourning the lost Tammuz. The calendar of the
Jewish Church still marks the i;th day of Tammuz as a fast, and Houtsma has shown 4 that the association of the day with
the capture of Jerusalem by the Romans represents merely the attempt to give an ancient festival a worthier interpretation. The day was originally connected with the Tammuz
1 The opinion of many scholars that the Rosh-hash-shana dates from the Babylonian exile because not referred to in the Book of Deuteronomy is open to serious objections. The festival has traces of antiquity (like the Day of Atonement), and appears to have been revived during the captivity, under Babylonian influence.

The interpretation offered by Robertson Smith (Religion of the Semites, p. 392, note) for the mourning rites appears strained. 4 Over de Israelictischc Vastcndagcn (Amsterdam, 1897, pp. 4-6 ; 12-17).

cult. Eerdmans l has recently endeavored to show that the
festival of Hosein, celebrated by the Shiitic sect of Moham
medanism in memory of the tragic death of the son of Ali, is in
reality a survival of the Babylonian-Phoenician Tammuz festival. The spread of the Tammuz-Adonis myth and cult to the Greeks 2 is but another indication of the popularity of this ancient
Semitic festival.
The old Zagmuku festival in honor of Bau and the Tammuz
festival, celebrated in spring and summer, respectively, are
also closely associated with agricultural life. The spring as the seedtime is, as we have seen, a natural period for begin
ning the calculation of the New Year, while a first harvest of
the wheat and barley is reaped in Babylonia at the time of the
summer solstice. We should expect, therefore, to find a third
festival in the fall, at the close of the harvest and just before the winter rains set in. The seventh month Tishri was
a sacred month among the ancient Hebrews as well as among
the Babylonians, but up to the present no distinct traces of
a festival period in Tishri have been found in Babylonian
texts. We must content ourselves, therefore, with the conjecture, above thrown out, that an Akitu was originally celebrated in this month at some ancient religious center of the Euphrates Valley. Further publications of cuneiform texts may throw
light upon this point. The unpublished material in European and American museums harbors many surprises. In AshurbanabaPs annals 3 there is an interesting reference
to a festival celebrated in honor of the goddess Gula, the god
dess of healing, 4 on the twelfth day of lyyar, the second month.
The festival is described ideographically as Si-gar, 6 but from

684 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
the fact that the same ideographs are used elsewhere to describe a day sacred to Sin and Shamash, 1 it would appear that
Si-gar is not a specific appellation, but a general name again for festival. This month lyyar and this particular day, as a "favorable one," is chosen by Ashurbanabal for his installa
tion as king of Assyria. The same month is selected for a
formal pilgrimage to Babylonia for the purpose of restoring to E-Sagila a statue of Marduk that a previous Assyrian king had taken from its place, 2 and Lehmann is probably correct in
concluding 3 that this month of lyyar was a particularly sacred one in Assyria, emphasized with intent perhaps by the kings, as an offset against the sacredness of Nisan in Babylonia.
Festivals in honor of Ninib were celebrated in Calah in the months of Elul the sixth month and Shabat the eleventh
month.4 The sixth month, it will be recalled, is sacred to
Ishtar. 5 Ninib being a solar deity, his festival in Elul was
evidently of a solar character. From Ashurbanabal, 6 again, we learn that the 25th day of Siwan the third month
was sacred to Belit of Babylon, and on that day a procession
took place in her honor. The Belit meant is Sarpanitum in
her original and independent role as a goddess of fertility. The statue of the goddess, carried about, presumably in her ship, formed the chief feature of the procession. Ashur
banabal chooses this " favorable " day as the one on which to

2 See the discussion (and passages) in Lehmann's Skamash-skumukin, pp. 43 seg. One is tempted to conclude that Marduk's statue was removed to Nineveh, not in a spirit of vandalism, but in order to enable Assyrian kings to ' seize the hands of Bel ' without proceeding to E-Sagila. The Babylonians, no doubt, were offended by such an act, and in order to conciliate them, Ashurbanabal, who pursues a mild policy towards the south, orders the statue to be restored at the time that he appoints his brother Shamash-shumukin as governor of the southern provinces. 3 Ib. p. 53, note.

break up camp in the course of one of his military expe
ditions. We would naturally expect to find a festival month devoted to the god Ashur in Assyria. This month was Elul the sixth month. 1 The choice of this month lends weight
to the supposition that Ashur was originally a solar deity.
2
The honors once paid to Ninib in Calah in this month
could thus easily be transferred to the head of the Assyrian
pantheon. Although in the calendar the sixth month is sacred
to Ishtar, her festival was celebrated in the fifth month, known
as Ab.'" This lack of correspondence between the calendar
and the festivals is an indication of the greater antiquity of the
latter.
In the great temple to Shamash at Sippar, there appear to have been several days that were marked by religious observances. Nabubaliddin 4
(ninth century) emphasizes that he presented rich garments to the temple for use on six days of
the year, the yth day of Nisan (first month), loth of lyyar
(second month), 3d of Elul (sixth month), yth of Tishri (seventh month), 1 5th of Arakh-shamna (or Marcheshwan, eighth month), and the i5th of Adar (twelfth month). These garments are given to Shamash, to his consort Malkatu, and to Bunene. 5 Since
from a passage in a Babylonian chronicle 6 it appears that it
was customary for Shamash on his festival to leave his temple, we may conclude that the garments were put on Shamash and
his associates, for the solemn procession on the six days in
question. The festivals in Nisan and Elul are distinctly of a solar
character. The choice of two other months immediately fol

lowing Nisan and Elul cannot be accidental. The interval of
thirty-three days between the Nisan and lyyar festivals and
thirty-four days between the Elul and Tishri festivals may
represent a sacred period. 1 Tishri, moreover, as has been pointed out, is a sacred month in a peculiar sense. Marcheshwan, it may be well to bear in mind, is sacred to Marduk,
a solar deity, while the i5th of Adar, curiously enough, is an old solar festival that, modified and connected with histori
cal reminiscences, became popular among the Jews of Persia and Babylonia during the Persian supremacy in the Semitic Orient, and survives to this day under the name of the Purim
festival. 2 At all events, the six days may be safely regarded as connected in some way, direct or indirect, with solar wor
ships, and it is natural to find that in so prominent a center
of sun-worship as Sippar, all the solar festivals were properly and solemnly observed.
1 One is reminded of the sanctity attaching in the Jewish ritual to the " counting " of the seven weeks intervening between Passover (the old Nisan festival) and Pentecost (an old summer festival). See Deut. xvi. 9. The 33d day of this period has a special significance in the Jewish Church. 2 The non-Jewish origin of the Purim festival is generally accepted by critical
scholars. Lagarde (Purim Em Beitrag zur Gcschichtedcr Religions) endeavors to trace it back to a Persian fire festival; Zimmern (Zeits.f. Alt. Wiss., 1891, pp. 160 scq.} connects it with the Babylonian Zagmuku. Sayce's supposition (Proc. Soc. Bibl. Arch. xix. 280, 281) is not to be taken seriously. The origin of the Jewish feast and fast of Purim is still obscure. The fact that there is both a fast (i4th Adar) and a festival (i5th Adar) is a safe indication of antiquity. Zimmern's view of a possible relationship between Purim and Zagmuku is untenable, but that there is a connection between Purim and some Babylonian festival follows from the fact that the two chief personages in the Book of Esther namely, Mordecai and Esther bear names identical with the two Babylonian deities, Marduk and Ishtar. This cannot be an accident. On the other hand, Haman and Vashti, according to Jensen (Wiener Zci/s. f. d. Kundc des Morgenlandes,v\. 70), are Elamitic names of deities corresponding to the Babylonian Marduk and Ishtar. The case for Vashti is not clearly made out by Jensen, but, for all that, it is certain that the Babylonian elements in the institution have been combined with some bits of Persian mythology. The historical setting is the work of the Jewish compiler of the tale, that has of course some his
torical basis. See now Toy, Esther as a Babylonian Goddess ( The New World,
vi. 130-145).



THE TEMPLES AND THE CULT. 687
It is disappointing that up to the present so little has been
ascertained of the details of the moon-cult the great rival to Shamash worship in the old cities of Ur and Harran. In
the Babylonian calendar, the third month Siwan is sacred
to Sin, but since, as we have found, the festivals in honor
of the gods do not always correspond to the assignment of the months, we cannot be certain that in this month a special festival in honor of Sin was observed. Lastly, besides the regular and
fixed festivals, the kings, and more especially the Assyrian rulers, did not hesitate to institute special festivals in memory of some
event that contributed to their glory. Agumkakrimi l instituted
a festival upon restoring the statues of Marduk and Sarpanitum
to Babylon, and Sargon does the same upon restoring the palace at Calah. 2 Dedications of temples and palaces were in general
marked by festivities, and so when the kings return in triumph
from their wars, laden with spoils and captives, popular rejoicings were instituted. But such festivals were merely sporadic,
and, while marked by religious ceremonies, were chiefly occasions of general jollification combined with homage to the rulers. Such a festival was not called an isinnu, but a nigfitu?

official, known as the //;;/;;///, who during his year of service
enjoyed the privilege of having official documents dated with his name.5 The ceremony involved a running 6 of some kind,
and reminds one of the running between the two hills Marwa and Safa in Mekka that forms part of the religious observances

in connection with a visit to the Kaaba. 1 The name of the
ceremony appears to have been puru (or bum). To connect this word with the Jewish festival of Purim, as Sayce proposes, 2
is wholly unwarranted. The character of the Puru ceremony
points to its being an ancient custom, the real significance of which in the course of time became lost. Fast days instituted
for periods of distress might also be added to the cult, but
these, too, like the special festivals, were not permanent institutions. For such occasions many of the penitential psalms
which were discussed in a previous chapter 3 were composed. To conciliate angered gods whose temples had been devastated
in days of turmoil, atonement and purification rites were ob
served. So Ashurbanabal 4 upon his conquest of Babylonian
cities tells us that he pacified the gods of the south with peni
tential psalms and purified the temples by magic rites; and Nabubaliddin,5 incidental to his restoration of the Shamash
cult at Sippar, refers to an interesting ceremony of purification, which consisted in his taking water and washing his mouth
according to the purification ritual of Ea and Marduk, 6 preliminary to bringing sacrifices to Shamash in his shrine. Sippar had been overrun by nomads,7 the temple had been defiled, and before sacrifices could again be offered, the sacred edifice
and sacred quarter had to be purified. The king's action was
a symbol of this purification. Many such customs must have
been in vogue in Babylonia and Assyria. Some and these
were the oldest were of popular origin. On the seal cylinders
there is frequently represented a pole or a conventionalized

form of a tree, generally in connection with a design illustrat
ing the worship of a deity.
1 This symbol is clearly a survival
of some tree worship 2 that was once popular. The comparison with the ashera or pole worship among Phoenicians and
Hebrews 3 is fully justified, and is a proof of the great antiquity of the symbol, which, without becoming a formal part of the later cult, retained in some measure a hold upon the popular mind. Other symbols and customs were introduced under the influence of the doctrines unfolded in the
schools of thought in the various intellectual centers, and as
an expression of the teachings of the priests. The cult of Babylonia, even more so than the literature, is a compound of tnese two factors, popular beliefs and the theological elab
oration and systematization of these beliefs. In the course
of this elaboration, many new ideas and new rites were intro
duced. The official cult passed in some important particulars
far beyond popular practices.

CHAPTER XXVII.
CONCLUSION.
GENERAL ESTIMATE AND INFLUENCE.
IN forming a general estimate of a religion, one's verdict
will largely depend upon the point of view from which the
religion in question is regarded. It is manifestly unjust and illogical to apply modern standards to an ancient religion, not
that such a religion would necessarily suffer by the comparison involved, but because of the totally different conditions under
which religion developed in antiquity from those prevailing in modern times. The close association, nay, the inseparable bond, between religion and the state is only one of several determining factors that might be adduced, while the small
scope" permitted to individualism in matters of religious belief
and practice in a country like Babylonia or Assyria was fraught with such peculiar results that all comparisons, even with other
religions of antiquity, could only obscure and not illumine our
judgment. There are manifestly three phases of the religion of Babylonia and Assyria that need to be considered in reaching some general conclusions as to the character and rank to be accorded
to it, the doctrines, the rites, and the ethics. So far as the
pantheon is concerned, the limitations in the development of doctrines connected with it were reached when the union of
the several Euphratean states was permanently effected under
Hammurabi. Marduk, a solar deity, takes his place as the head
of the pantheon by virtue of the preeminent place occupied by
his patron city, Babylon. The other great gods, each repre

senting some religious center that at one time or the other
rose to importance, grouped themselves around Marduk, as the princes and nobles gather around a supreme monarch. A certain measure of independence was reserved for the great
mother goddess Ishtar, who, worshipped under various names
as the symbol of fertility, plenty, and strength, is not so decidedly affected by the change as deities like En-lil, Shamash, Sin, and Ea, who could at any time become rivals of Marduk. As the position of Marduk, however, became more and more assured without danger of being shaken, the feeling of rivalry in his relations to the other gods began to disappear. Marduk's
supremacy no longer being questioned, there was no necessity to curtail the homage paid to Shamash at Sippar or to En-lil
at Nippur ; hence the religious importance of the old centers
is not diminished by the surpassing glory of Babylon. There was room for all. Marduk's toleration is the best evidence
of his unquestioned headship. The centralization of political power and of religious supremacy is concomitant with the focussing of intellectual life in
Babylon. The priests of Marduk set the fashion in theo
logical thought. So far as possible, the ancient traditions
and myths were reshaped so as to contribute to the glory of
Marduk. The chief part in the work of creation is assigned
to him. The storm-god En-lil is set aside to make room for
the solar deity Marduk. But, despite such efforts, the old tales,
once committed to writing on the practically imperishable clay, survived, if not in the minds of the people, at least in the archives of the ancient temples.
The antiquity of literature in Babylonia was the factor that
prevented the cult from acquiring a uniform character in the
various parts of the empire. The priests of Nippur, of Sippar, of Eridu, of Erech, Cuthah, Ur, and other places began long before the period of Hammurabi to compile, on the basis of
past experience and as a guide for future needs, omen lists,



692 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
incantation formulas, and sacrificial rituals. These collections created orthodox standards, and these standards, once acknowledged, the natural conservatism attaching to religious customs was sufficient to maintain their continuance. The uniformity of doctrine was thus offset by variations in the cult;
and the policy adopted by both Babylonian and Assyrian rulers, in permitting each center to remain undisturbed, and in freely
recognizing the religious independence of each, prevented the Babylonian and Assyrian religion from falling into the state of stagnation which would otherwise have been its fate. In the views taken of the relationship between the gods and men, no notable advances were made when once the ethical
spirit was infused into the religious beliefs. The problem of
good and evil was solved in a simple fashion. By the side of
the great gods there existed a large, almost infinite number
of spirits and demons, who were generally held responsible for the evils affecting mankind. 1 These demons and spirits were
in many cases gods 'fallen from grace,' minor local deities
who, unable to maintain themselves in the face of the growing
popularity of the great gods', sank to an inferior position as messengers, forced to do the will of their masters and who
could be controlled by the latter. But the intercession of the
priests was essential to obtaining divine help against the mischievous workings of the spirits. Even the kings, though
originally standing very close to the gods, could not dispense with the services of the priests, and by virtue of their conspicu
ous position had to exercise greater precautions than the masses not to offend the gods, by errors of commission or omission in the cult. The priests held the secret that could
secure freedom from ills and promote the comparative well
being of rulers and subjects. They alone knew what incantations to use for each case that was brought before them, in
what way the sacrifices were to be brought, when the deity

CONCLUSION. 693
should be approached, and why divine anger had manifested
itself. The intellectual leadership thus acquired by the priests, in addition to their control of religious affairs, was an additional
factor in maintaining orthodox standards of belief when once
they had become fixed. In the doctrines of life after death,
this influence of the priesthood is distinctly seen. The popular
notions were systematized, but the priests, true to their rule as
conservators, did not pass beyond primitive conceptions. Some weak attempts at a philosophical view of the problem of death are attempted in the Gilgamesh epic as finally put together under the influence of the Babylonian schools of thought, 1 but
the leaders shared with the people the sense of hopelessness
when picturing the life in the great hollow Aralu. It is in the
hymns and prayers, rather than in the cosmology and eschatol
ogy, that the spiritual aspirations of the priests (and to a limited degree of the masses) manifest themselves. In these
productions, whether existing independently or incorporated into incantation rituals, we see the religion of Babylonia at its
best. A strong emphasis is placed upon the doctrine that misfortunes and ills come as a punishment for sins of com
mission or omission. It is true that no distinction is drawn
between ceremonial errors and real misdeeds, but the sense of guilt is aroused by the priests in the minds of those who come
to the temples, seeking relief from the attacks of the evil spirits
or the bewitchment of sorcerers.
It is in this doctrine of guilt, as revealed through the magi
cal texts, that we must seek both for the starting-point of the
development of an ethical system (so far as such a system existed among the Babylonians), and also for the limitations
of this system. The aim of the priests to observe the right
ceremonies, to pronounce the right words in order to accomplish their aim, reacted on rulers and subjects, and led them to
make the pleasure of the gods the goal of life. With fear of

694 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
the gods, upon which stress is always laid, 1 there is thus asso
ciated an equally strong love 2 of the divine powers. Obedience to the gods is primarily inculcated as a means of securing
their protection and blessing ; but the fear of the gods, we are
told, is the cause of joy; 8 and the Babylonians passed far beyond the stage of making the satisfaction of one's own
desires the standard of right and wrong. A penitential psalm declares 4 that what is pleasing to oneself may be sinful in the
eyes of a god. The kings pride themselves upon being the promoters of justice. Even the Assyrian rulers, who impress one while conducting their wars as bereft of all softer emotions, declare that
their highest aim is to spread plenty and happiness. 5 Sennacherib calls himself a king who ' loves righteousness,' 6 and he,
as well as his predecessors and successors, busies himself with
actually restoring the rights of those of his subjects who have
been wrongfully deprived of their possessions. The standard of private morality was high both in Babylonia and Assyria. The legal and commercial tablets reveal that
proper consideration was given to the treatment of woman a most satisfactory index of ethical conditions. 7 She could
hold property and dispose of it. Before the courts, her status
did not differ materially from that of the male population. The husband could not divorce his wife without sufficient cause, and
children owed obedience to the mother as well as to the father. 8

CONCLUSION. 695
Polygamy, as a matter of course, prevailed, but it is an error to
suppose that polygamy is inconsistent with high ideals of family
life, even though it does not lead to the highest ideals.
Hatred, lying, cheating, using false measures, removing boundaries, adultery, insincerity are denounced in the incantation texts, 1 and in accord with this standard, we see in the
recordsuits of lawsuits and agreements between parties 2 clear
indications of the stringent laws that prevailed in order to
protect citizens against infringement of their rights. It comes
as a surprise, but also as a welcome testimony to the efficacy of justice in Assyria, to find Ashurbanabal emphasizing the fact that he established ordinances so that the strong should do no harm to the weak.3
The institution of slavery flourished in Babylonia and Assy
ria throughout all periods of their history,
4 but there were
various grades of slaves. Some classes differed but little from
that of servants, indentured for a longer or shorter period for
certain services. The temple slaves appear to have largely
belonged to this class. Mild treatment of slaves is enjoined
and was the rule. The slaves are often the confidential agents
of their masters who attend to the business affairs of the latter.
We find slaves holding property in their own right. Con
tracts entered into by them are legal and binding. Injuries
inflicted upon them by their masters are punished, and they are
protected against losses and mishaps encountered while in service. While we have no evidence to show that the laws of
Assyria were on a lower ethical plane than those of Babylonia, still, as the pupils and imitators of the Babylonians in almost
everything pertaining to culture and religion, the general tone
of life in Assyria was hardly as high as in the south. The war

like spirit of the rulers is but a symptom of the fiercer charac
ter of the people.
The tendency towards monotheism in the religion of Baby
lonia and Assyria has been referred to.. We must remember
that it was only a tendency. No decided steps in this direction were ever taken. Both in the south and in the north, this
tendency is but the expression of the preeminent rank accorded to Marduk and Ashur, respectively. The independent existence of two heads in the combined pantheon was sufficient to
prevent the infusion of an ethical spirit into this monotheistic
tendency ; and unless a monotheistic conception of the uni
verse is interpreted in an ethical sense, monotheism (or monol
atry) has no great superiority, either religiously or philosophi
cally, over polytheism. From the standpoint of religious doctrine, accordingly, the religion of Babylonia and Assyria does not occupy a unique position. In this respect, the Egyptian religion reaches a higher level. For all that, the influence exerted by the reli
gion that developed in the Euphrates Valley was profound and
lasting. We have had occasion in various chapters of this
work to point out the close analogies existing between the
thoughts, tradition, and practices of the Hebrews and the Baby
lonians. 1 A proper study of the Hebrew religion is closely
bound up with an investigation of the religious antiquities of Babylonia ; and as our knowledge of these antiquities increases, it will be found that not only are Hebrews and
Babylonians equipped with many common possessions when starting out upon their intellectual careers, but that, at different
times and in diverse ways, the stimulus to religious advance came to the Hebrews from the ancient centers of thought and
worship in the Euphrates Valley. This influence was particu
larly strong during the period of Jewish history known as Babylonian exile. The finishing touches to the structure of Judaism

CONCLUSION. 697
given on Babylonian soil 1 reveal the Babylonian trademark.
Ezekiel, in many respects the most characteristic Jewish figure
of the exile, is steeped in Babylonian theology and mysticism ; and the profound influence of Ezekiel is recognized by modern
scholarship in the religious spirit that characterizes the Jews upon the reorganization of their commonwealth.
It would be a mistake, however, to suppose that what Babylonia gave to others was always the best she had to offer.
Degrading tendencies, too, found an entrance into post-exilic Judaism through Babylonian influence. Close contact of Jews with Babylonians served to make the former more accessible to
the popular beliefs in incantations and in the power of demons than they would otherwise have been. Not that the Jews (as
little as any other people) were ever entirely free from super
stitious practices ; but, living in an atmosphere charged, so to speak, with magic and astrology, it was inevitable that even the best among them should be infected by customs that they daily
witnessed. In the Babylonian Talmud, the references to evil
spirits are numerous. Specific incantations are introduced, and
an elaborate system of angelology and demonology forms a feature of Talmudical Judaism in which, by the side of Per
sian influences,2 we may detect equally strong traces of Babylonian ideas. In the upper strata of the ruins of Nippur, hundreds of clay bowls were found, inscribed with Jewish inscriptions, in the Aramaic dialect that was spoken by the Babylonian Jews.3 Similar bowls were found elsewhere in the mounds of the Euphrates Valley. 4 These bowls indicate
the presence of Jews in various parts of the country. 5 Placed

698 BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN RELIGION.
in the graves as a protection for the dead against evil spirits, the inscriptions contain formulas of denunciation against the demons that constitute a striking parallel to the incantation
texts of ancient Babylonia. Some of the demons are identi
cal with those occurring in these texts, and by the side of the
inscriptions, there are illustrations l and magical designs to which parallels exist on the Babylonian tablets.
This custom of endeavoring to secure protection for the
dead through the power of the curses and propitiatory phrases inscribed on bowls continued in vogue as late as the ninth
century at the least, and perhaps considerably later. There are indications also that Babylonian ideas found an entrance
into the Jewish Kabbala, the strange mystic system of the middle ages, the sources of which are to be sought in the
apocalyptic chapters of Ezekiel and Daniel. Christianity as well as Judaism felt the fascination of the mystic lore of Babylonia. Gunkel 2 has demonstrated the
Babylonian origin of the myth embodied in the twelfth chapter of Revelations. This myth is but another form of the Marduk
Tiamat contest, which, it will be recalled, is the chief episode in the Babylonian creation f
epic.'
3 More significant is the influence exerted by the religious ideas of Babylonia upon the various Gnostic sects that arose within the Christian Church. That the source of Gnosticism was to be sought
in Mesopotamia was always recognized by scholars, but until the discovery of Babylonian literature, it was customary to seek for Jewish influences in the formation of the various Gnostic sects. Kessler 4 was the first to demonstrate clearly
the dependence of the leading ideas of Gnosticism upon

CONCLUSION. 699
the Babylonian cosmology and the conceptions deveolped with reference to the gods. More recently, Anz 1 has under
taken a renewed investigation of the subject, and, approaching the theme from various points of view, reaches conclusions
confirmatory of Kessler's thesis. All of the Gnostic sects have
certain fundamental doctrines in common, such as the dwelling
of God in the abyss, 2 the migration of the soul after death through seven zones, the emanation of aeons from a supreme
aeon. 3 All these doctrines exhibit such close affinities with
Babylonian ideas as to warrant the assertion that the religion
of Babylonia survives in Gnosticism ; and since, as we know, Babylonian culture and customs maintained an undisturbed existence almost to the threshold of our era, there is no need
to go back to the older periods of the Babylonian religion to find the connecting link, uniting Gnosticism with the Babylonian religion. The spread and influence of the Gnostic sects was
notoriously wide. It is sufficient to recall the chief centers of
Gnostic schools of thought in Antioch, Edessa, and Alexandria and the various branches of the powerful sect of the Ophites. The influence of these schools extended into Greece and Rome.
While the Gnostic sects disappear in the sixth century, the influence of Gnosticism can be followed down to the twelfth
century, a significant testimony to the enduring qualities of Babylonian doctrines.
In the ancient world, prior to the rise of Christianity, Egypt, Persia, and Greece felt the influence of the Baby
lonian religion. Budge 4 is of the opinion that many of the magic practices carried on in the Egyptian temples are to be traced back to the incantation rituals perfected by the Babylonian priests. In view of the early contact between

Egypt and Babylonia, as revealed by the El-Amarna tablets, there were certainly abundant opportunities for the infusion of
Babylonian views and customs into Egyptian cults. In Persia, the Mithra cult reveals the unmistakable influence of Baby
lonian conceptions ;
1 and if it be recalled what a degree of
importance the mysteries connected with this cult acquired among the Romans, another link will be added connecting the ramifications of ancient culture with the civilization of the
Euphrates Valley. The strong admixture of Semitic elements
both in early Greek mythology and in Grecian cults is now so
generally admitted by scholars as to require no further comment. 2 These Semitic elements are to a large extent more
specifically Babylonian. The spread of the Gilgamesh epic and of the Ishtar cult into Asia Minor and Greece may be
instanced as illustrations of Babylonian influence ; and granting that the Phoenicians acted largely as the mediators in carrying these ideas to the Greek settlements, still there must have
been influences at work long before this direct contact with
Semitic culture that prepared the way for the ready acceptance
which Semitic conceptions and Semitic practices found. The
time has not yet come for pronouncing an opinion as to the
influence exerted by Babylonia upon lands in the distant East.
The theory of DeLacouperie 3 and Ball, which proposes to trace the Chinese script to the hieroglyphic system of Babylonia, is still to be tested. Early commercial contact between
the Euphrates Valley and India is maintained as a probable
theory by several scholars, 4 and the possibility, therefore, of the spread of the religious ideas of Babylonia to the distant East is not to be rejected. Patient research and the additional

CONCLUSION, 701
discoveries (which are constantly being made) will alone place us in a position some day to give a definite answer to the question. Whatever that answer may be, the verdict as to the high
quality and profound influence of the religion that arose in the
valley of the Euphrates and that flourished for several millen
niums will not be altered.
To show the general indebtedness of Grecian, Roman,
mediaeval, and even modern civilization to Babylonian culture
lies beyond the range of this work, but the profound impression made upon the ancient world by the remarkable manifes
tations of religious thought in Babylonia and by the religious activity that prevailed in that region is but an index of the influence that must have been exerted in other directions by
the varied intellectual activity that converted a district, exposed to the by no means tender mercies of the elements, into one of the most notable illustrations of the power and achievements of man.






BIBLIOGRAPHY.






NOTE.
THE bibliography is arranged in nine sections, the order adopted corresponding to the broad subdivisions of the book. The beginning is therefore made : (1) With references to the most important or most useful publications, dealing with the excavations conducted in Babylonia and
Assyria, the method of decipherment of the cuneiform inscriptions,
the general history of Babylonia and Assyria, and the general aspects of the Babylonian-Assyrian culture. This section corresponds to the first two chapters of the book.
(2) The second section is devoted to books, monographs, articles,
and chapters in bot>ks, dealing with the general subject of the Baby
lonian-Assyrian religion. In neither of these two sections have I aimed at being exhaustive,
though the second will be found, I think, to include almost everything of any value.
The detailed bibliography begins with the following section. Corresponding again to the treatment of the subject in the book, I take up in succession :
(3) The Pantheon.
(4) Religious Texts. (5) Cosmology. (6) Gilgamesh Epic (including the Deluge episode). (7) Beliefs and Customs (Views of Life after Death, Funeral
Rites, Legends, Ethics, etc.}. (8) Temples and Cult. (9) Bearings of the Babylonian-Assyrian Religion on the Old Testament, and General Influence Exerted by the Religion.
Of these seven sections, all but the last aim at being exhaustive. It was not always easy to decide into what division a particular ref

erence belonged, but I have been generally guided by the needs of
students for whom this portion of the bibliography is particularly intended. The fifth and sixth sections should be taken together ; and similarly the seventh and eighth, while the fourth section should of course be consulted in connection with the third, fifth, sixth, seventh, and
eighth. Under each section the authors named are arranged in alphabetical order. Occasionally, I have added some comments to the reference
given, as a guide or a warning to students. In a subject like Assyriology, where new discoveries are constantly being made and progress
in the interpretation of texts is steadily going on, it is inevitable that views and translations should be subject to modification sometimes
slight, but frequently significant. I have endeavored to avoid repetition of references. In a few cases this was unavoidable. In the second section portions of books are referred to, which by virtue of
their character as very general works had to be assigned a place also in the first section. Two or three of the references in the fourth section had to be repeated elsewhere ; and I should also add that there are a few references which I have been unable to verify.

HANDBOOKS ON THE HISTORY OF RELIGIONS.
Edited by MORRIS JASTROW, Jr., Ph.D.,
Professor of Semitic Languages at the University of Pennsylvania.
The historical study of religions has secured a foothold in both European and
American Universities, and the number of institutions that are making ampler
provisions for its pursuit is steadily increasing. At the same time, the investiga
tions of scholars on both sides of the Atlantic during the past decades have not
only been productive of significant results, but have also led to a greater degree
of perfection in the methods of study. With a view of illustrating these modern
methods of study and of compiling the ascertained results of scholarship, it is
proposed to issue a series of Handbooks, dealing with the various religions, that
may serve the purpose at once of practical text and reference books. The dis
tinguishing features of this Series will be: (i) Each volume dealing with the
history of a special religion is to be entrusted to the hands of a competent
specialist. (2) With a view of securing the unity of the series, the treatment of
the subject in the various volumes will follow so far as possible a uniform order.
Each volume will accordingly begin with an introductory chapter setting forth
the sources for the study. This will be followed by a section on the land and
people under consideration. The third division, forming, as it were, the kernel
of the book, will embody a full exposition of the beliefs and rites, the religious
art and literature, set forth in each case in the manner best adapted to the
religion in question. A fourth division will give the history of the religion, and
set forth its relation to others ; and, lastly, each volume will be supplied with a
substantial Bibliography, with indexes and maps, and, so far as necessary, illustrations. (3) Polemical discussion will be rigidly excluded, the subject
being viewed from the historical side exclusively. (4) For the present, the series
will be confined to the ancient and non-Christian religions.
Each volume will contain about 3^0 pages, and the average price will be $1.50.
The first volume, however, embracing as it does a larger field than any of the
other topics arranged for, is exceptionally large, and the price consequently is
above the average for the series. It was thought best, however, to include the
material in one volume rather than to issue it in two separate volumes.

ETHICAL SERIES
UNDIiU TUB EDITORIAL SUPERVISION OK
E. IIERSHEY SNEATH,
Assistant Professor of Philosophy in Yale University.
THE primary object of the Series is to facilitate the study of the History of Ethics in colleges. This History will be in the form of a series of small volumes, each devoted to the presentation of a representative system of Modern Ethics in selections from the original works. The selections will be accompanied by Notes, and prefaced by a brief biographical sketch of the author, a statement of the relation of his system to preceding and subsequent ethical thought, a brief exposition of the system, and a bibliography. The following volumes of the Series are now ready :
The Ethics of Hume. By J. II . HYSLOP, Professor of Logic and
Ethics in Columbia University. I2mo. Cloth. 275 pages. For introduction, $1.00.
THE present volume contains the whole of the third book of the
Treatise of Human Nature, and such portions of the second book as
throw light upon or are connected with Hume's moral theory.
The analysis and criticism of his system follows lines somewhat
different from that of Green, and are designed to present Hume in
another light. In all respects it is hoped that the volume may prove
helpful to those who wish to study the ethical system of Kant's predecessor.
The Ethics Of Hegel. Translated Selections from his "Rechtsphi
losophie." With an Introduction by J. MACHRIDK STKRKKTT,
Professor of Philosophy in the Columbian University, Washing
ton, D.C. I2mo. Cloth. 216 pages. For introduction, $1.00.
THE great revival of interest and work in the department of Ethics
during the present quarter of a century has had its chief inspiration
and source in the idealistic philosophy of Germany. Of this philosophy
Hegel was the culmination and crown. Apart from the empirical evo
lutionary school, nearly all the prominent writers on Ethics in England
have been following quite the spirit and substance of Hegel.
The Ethics of Hobbes. As contained in Selections from his Works. With an Introduction by E. HF.KSMKY SNKATH, Assistant Pro
fessor of Philosophy in Yale University. I2mo. Cloth. 349
pages. For introduction,
