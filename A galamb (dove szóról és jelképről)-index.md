For some time I have been troubled in my spirit concerning the use of the term ‘dove’
and the symbolism associated with it as it is used in the Christian churches. Recently the
Lord prompted me to compile some of the recorded data for your perusal so that we might
have a better understanding on the origin of its’ use in religion. So we shall start with the
definitions given in some of our recognized dictionaries. We will then move on to historical
evidence which defines the use of the word ‘dove’ and its’ symbolism in religion.
In the Advanced Edition of the Winston Dictionary, 1944; we read the following
description of the word, ‘dove.’ Quote! ‘(duv), n. [<A.S. dûfe, dove, akin to dûfan, to dive], 1. Any of several birds
of the same family (Columbidæ) as the pigeon; 2. One who is pure and lovely, or very dear; a term of endearment;
3. The emblem of the Holy Spirit in Christian art and symbolism; 4. An emblem of innocence and gentleness.’ end
of quote.
In the Strongs concordance the word ‘dove’ as used in scripture to define the descending of the Holy Spirit
upon Jesus Christ is peristera {per-is-ter-ah'} and numbered 4058. The dictionary states; ‘of uncertain derivation;’
TDNT - 6:63,830; n f AV - dove 9, pigeon 1; 10 1) a dove.
Concerning the use of or making of images of any living creature the commandments from the scripture states
as follows; Exodus 20:4- ‘Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness [of any thing] that [is]
in heaven above, or that [is] in the earth beneath, or that [is] in the water under the earth:’ Moses then teaches the
people what God had meant by a graven image. In Deuteronomy chapter 4 we read starting at verse 12; ‘And the
LORD spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only [ye
heard] a voice. And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, [even] ten
commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone. Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye
saw no manner of similitude on the day [that] the LORD spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire: Lest
ye corrupt [yourselves], and make you a graven image, the similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or female,
The likeness of any beast that [is] on the earth, the likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air, The likeness of
any thing that creepeth on the ground, the likeness of any fish that [is] in the waters beneath the earth:’
Let us now go back in time to the Babylonian Assyrian empires to the days of Nimrod and Semiramis and
Tammuz and look at how the ‘dove’ was assimilated and used in many forms of pagan worship. It is a direct blatant
expression of defiance against the commands of God. It has been used to give pagan customs a face of acceptance
even up to this very day. The scripture states that Nimrod and his kingdom (which was Babylon) was ‘mighty before
or against God.’ Genesis 10:8-10
Semiramis, that is Astarte which is the same as Venus and Aphrodite
is represented as a dove. Every quality of gentleness and mercy was regarded
as centered in her; and when death had closed her career, while she was fabled
to have been deified and changed into a dove, to express the celestial benignity
of her nature, she was called by the name of D'Iune, or "The Dove," or without
the article "Juno." Just who is Pope John Paul II Worshiping?
The name of the Roman "queen of heaven," has the very same meaning;
and under the form of a dove as well as her own, she was worshiped by the
Babylonians. The dove, the chosen symbol of this deified queen, is commonly
represented with an olive branch in her mouth. A branch was the symbol of the deified son Nimrod, and when the
deified mother was represented as a Dove, what could the meaning of this representation be but just to identify her
with the Spirit of all grace, that brooded, dove-like, over the deep at the creation; for in the sculptures of Nineveh,

a city in the Babylonian kingdom of Nimrod, as you may have seen, the wings and tail of the dove represented the
third member of the idolatrous Assyrian trinity. See fig. 25.
In confirmation of this view, it must be stated that the Assyrian "Juno," or "The Virgin Venus," as she was
called, was identified with the air. In Chaldee the same word which signifies the air signifies also the Holy Ghost.
The statement of Proclus, that "Juno imports the generation of soul."*
*Proclus, lib.vi.cap.22, vol.ii.p.76
Whence could the soul-the spirit of man - be supposed to have its origin, but from the Spirit of God. In
accordance with this character of Juno as the incarnation of the Divine Spirit, the source of life, and also as the
goddess of the air, thus is she invoked in the "Orphic Hymns":
O royal Juno, the majestic mien, Aerial formed, divine, Jove's blessed queen, throned in the bosom of caerulean air,
the race of mortals is thy constant care;
The cooling gales, thy power alone inspires, which nourish life, which every life desires;
Mother of showers and winds, from thee alone producing all things, mortal life is known;
All natures show thy temperament divine, and universal sway alone is thine, with sounding blasts of wind, the
swelling sea and rolling rivers roar when shook by thee.
Thus, then, the deified Semiramis, (the wife of Nimrod) when in all respects regarded as a veritable woman,
was at the same time adored as the incarnation of the Holy Ghost, the Spirit of peace and love in the form of a dove.
In the temple of Hierapolis in Syria, (the city of obelisks) there was a famous statue of the goddess Juno, to which
crowds from all quarters flocked to worship.
The image of the goddess was richly habited, on her head was a golden dove, and she was called by the name
peculiar to the country, Semeion. What is the meaning of Semeion? It is evidently "The Habitation;" and the "golden
dove" on her head shows plainly who it was that was supposed to dwell in her. Even the Spirit of God!

To the eyes of men she was Venus Urania, "The heavenly Venus," the queen of beauty, who assured her
worshipers of salvation, while at the same time giving loose reins to every unholy passion, and every depraved
and sensual appetite. No wonder that every where she was enthusiastically adored. Under the name of the
"Mother of gods," the goddess queen of Babylon became an object of almost universal worship. "The Mother of the
gods," says Clericus, "was worshiped by the Persians, the Syrians, and all the kings of Europe and Asia, with the most
profound religious veneration."|
|Joannes Clericus, Philos. Orient., lib.ii., De Persis, cap.9, vol.ii.p.340.
Truly the nations might be said to be "made drunk" with the wine of
her fornications.
Revelation 17:1-2 ‘And there came one of the seven angels which had the
seven vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will shew
unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters:
With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the
inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her
fornication.’
Semiramis, being deified as Astarte, came to be raised to the highest honors and more worshiped than any
other god; and her change into a dove was evidently intended, when the distinction of sex had been blasphemously
attributed to the Godhead, to identify her, under the name of the Mother of gods, with that Divine Spirit, without
whose agency no one can be born a child of God, and whose emblem, in the symbolical language of Scripture, was
the Dove, as that of the Messiah was the Lamb.
Now Semiramis, deified as the Dove, was Astarte in the most gracious and benignant form. The first form
of Astarte was as Eve who brought sin into the world; the second form before the Flood, was avenging as the goddess
of justice. This form was "Benignant and Merciful." Thus, also, Semiramis, or Astarte, as Venus the goddess of love
and beauty, became "The Hope of the whole world," and men gladly had recourse to the "mediation" of one so
tolerant of sin.||
