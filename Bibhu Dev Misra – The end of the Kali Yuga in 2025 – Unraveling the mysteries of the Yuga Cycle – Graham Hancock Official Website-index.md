Part 1: Unraveling the Yuga Cycle Timeline
The Yuga Cycle doctrine tells us that we are now living in the Kali Yuga; the
age of darkness, when moral virtue and mental capabilities reach their
lowest point in the cycle. The Indian epic TheMahabharatadescribes the
Kali Yuga as the period when the “World Soul” is Black in hue; only one
quarter of virtue remains, which slowly dwindles to zero at the end of the
Kali Yuga. Men turn to wickedness; disease, lethargy, anger, natural
calamities, anguish and fear of scarcity dominate. Penance, sacri ces and
religious observances fall into disuse. All creatures degenerate. Change
passes over all things, without exception.
The Kali Yuga (Iron Age) was preceded by three others Yugas: Satya or Krita
Yuga (Golden Age), Treta Yuga (Silver Age) and the Dwapara Yuga (Bronze
Age). In the Mahabharata, Hanuman gives the following description of the
Yuga Cycle to the Pandava prince Bhima:
“The Krita Yuga was so named because there was but one religion, and
all men were saintly: therefore they were not required to perform
religious ceremonies... Men neither bought nor sold; there were no
poor and no rich; there was no need to labour, because all that men
required was obtained by the power of will...The Krita Yuga was
without disease; there was no lessening with the years; there was no
hatred, or vanity, or evil thought whatsoever; no sorrow, no fear. All
mankind could attain to supreme blessedness. The universal soul was
White... the identi cation of self with the universal soul was the whole
religion of the Perfect Age. In the Treta Yuga sacri ces began, and the

World Soul became Red; virtue lessened a quarter. Mankind sought
truth and performed religious ceremonies; they obtained what they
desired by giving and by doing. In the Dwapara Yuga the aspect of the
World Soul was Yellow: religion lessened one-half. The Veda was
divided into four parts, and although some had knowledge of the four
Vedas, others knew but three or one. Mind lessened, Truth declined,
and there came desire and diseases and calamities; because of these
men had to undergo penances. It was a decadent Age by reason of the
prevalence of sin.”[1]
And now we are living in the dark times of the Kali Yuga, when goodness and
virtue has all but disappeared from the world. But when did the Kali Yuga
begin? And when does it end? In spite of the elaborate theological
framework which describes the characteristics of this age, the start and end
dates of the Kali Yuga remain shrouded in mystery. The popularly accepted
date for the beginning of the Kali Yuga is 3102 BC, thirty- ve years after the
conclusion of the great battle of the Mahabharata. This is remarkably close
to the proposed beginning of the current “Great Cycle” of the Mayan Long
Count Calendar in 3114 BC. It is of interest to note that in both of these
cases the beginning dates of the respective cycles were calculated
retrospectively. The Mayans had recomputed their ancient calendars
sometime between 400 BC to 50 CE, at the ceremonial center of Izapa in
Mexico, and xed the starting date of the current Great Cycle of their Long
Count Calendar. And in India, sometime around 500 CE, a major review of
the Indian calendric systems had taken place. It was during this time that
the renowned astronomer Aryabhatta had identi ed the beginning date of
the Kali Yuga as 3102 BC. Why was it suddenly necessary for two ancient
civilizations to re-calculate dates that should have been an integral part of
their calendric systems? Howdidsuchimportanttime-markersslipoutof
theircollectivememory? We will revisit these questions later.
It is generally believed that Aryabhatta had calculated the start date of the
Kali Yuga on the basis of the information in the Sanskrit astronomical
treatise, the SuryaSiddhanta, according to which the ve “geocentric
planets” (i.e. the planets visible to the naked eye) – Mercury, Venus, Mars,
Jupiter and Saturn – were aligned to 0° of Aries (near the star zetaPiscium)
at the beginning of the Kali Yuga. He, thus, arrived at the date of 17/18
February, 3102 BC as the starting point of the Kali Yuga. However, modern
simulations carried out by Richard Thompson show that on 17/18 February,
3102 BC, the ve geocentric planets occupied an arc of roughly 42° in the

sky and were scattered over three zodiacal signs – Aries, Pisces and
Aquarius. This cannot be considered as a conjunction by any means. Far
more spectacular ‘alignment’ of planets has occurred in the preceding and
succeeding centuries. In other words, the conjunction of geocentric planets
at 0° of Aries that was supposedly targeted by Aryabhatta did not take place
in 3102 BC.
Does this mean Aryabhatta made an error in his back calculations? Not
really. For, the Surya Siddhanta does not ever specify that such an alignment
of planets took place atthebeginningoftheKaliYuga. On the contrary, the
Surya Siddhanta explicitly states that this conjunction of planets at 0° of
Aries takes place attheendoftheGoldenAge(Satya / Krita Yuga). The text
states: “Now, at the end of the Golden Age (Krita Yuga), all the planets, by
their mean motion – excepting however their nodes and apsides – are in
conjunction in the rst of Aries”[2] Unfortunately, however, this simple
statement was misrepresented by some of the early commentators, in their
eagerness to nd an astronomical rationale for the 3102 BC date, and it has
subsequently been promulgated as a fact.
The general understanding in ancient Hindu astronomy was that atthe
beginningofthepresentorderofthings, all the planets commenced their
movement together at 0° of Aries; and all the planets return to the same
position in the heavens, at certain xed intervals, resulting in a universal
conjunction. The Surya Siddhanta states that this conjunction takes place at
the end of the GoldenAge. However, there is also a prevailing belief in
Hindu astronomy that this conjunction takes place at the beginning of a Day
and Night of Brahma, comprising of a 1000 Yuga Cycles.
Similar information regarding the conjunction of planets is also present in
the ancient Greek texts. In the Timaeus, Plato refers to a “Perfect Year”
which elapses at that moment when the sun, moon and the planets all
return to the same relative position despite all their intervening reversals.[3]
This idea was echoed by the 3 century Roman writer Censorinus, who said
that the orbits of the sun, moon and the ve wandering planets complete
one “Great Year of Heraclitus”, when they are brought back together at the
same time to the same sign where once they were.[4] This “Great Year”
which is known by various other names – “Perfect Year”, “Platonic Year”,
“Supreme Year of Aristotle” etc. – was variously represented as being of
12,954 years (Cicero) or 10,800 years (Heraclitus) duration.

There can be no doubt that the 3102 BC date for the Kali Yuga was not
based on any information in the Surya Siddhanta or any other Sanskrit text.
The date virtually pops out of nowhere. Before 500 CE, this date was not
mentioned in any Sanskrit text. From where, then, did Aryabhatta obtain
this date? There seems to be no indication that Aryabhatta had computed
this date himself. There is a single, stray reference to this date in the
Sanskrit text Aryabhatiya,where Aryabhatta mentions that the text was
composed 3,600yearsintotheKaliYuga,whenhewas23yearsold. Since
the Aryabhatiya was composed in 499 CE, the beginning of the Kali Yuga can
be traced back to 3102 BC. The statement, by itself, does not reveal any
information about the astronomical basis on which the date was calculated,
or whether the calculation was performed by Aryabhatta himself. It is
possible that this date was adopted by Aryabhatta from some other source.
The vagueness surrounding the origin of this date makes its validity highly
suspect.
The task of guring out this date from the ancient Sanskrit texts, however, is
fraught with di culties, since a number of inaccuracies have crept into the
Yuga Cycle information contained within them. As pointed out by Sri
Yukteswar, in many Sanskrit texts the 12,000 year duration of the Yuga Cycle
was arti cially in ated to an abnormally high value of 4,320,000 years by
introducing a multiplication factor of “360”, which was represented as the
number of “human years” which constitutes a “divine year”. However,
certain texts, such as the Mahabharataand the LawsofManu, still retain the
original value of the Yuga Cycle as 12,000 years. Many other ancient cultures
– the Chaldeans, Zoroastrians and Greeks – also believed in a 12,000 year
Cycle of the Ages. The renowned Sanskrit scholar and nationalist leader of
India, B.G.Tilak had mentioned in his book, TheArcticHomeintheVedas
(1903), that:
“The writers of the Puranas, many of which appear to have been
written during the rst few centuries of the Christian, era, were
naturally unwilling to believe that the Kali Yuga had passed away...An
attempt was, therefore, made to extend the duration of the Kali Yuga
by converting 1000 (or 1200) ordinary human years thereof into as
many divine years, a single divine year, or a year of the gods, being
equal to 360 human years...this solution of the di culty was
universally adopted, and a Kali of 1200 ordinary years was at once
changed, by this ingenious arti ce, into a magni cent cycle of as many
divine, or 360 × 1200 = 432,000 ordinary years.”[5]

https://grahamhancock.com/dmisrab6/ 6/25
Yukteswar also clari ed in the book TheHolyScience(1894),that a complete
Yuga Cycle takes 24,000 years, and is comprised of an ascending cycle of
12,000 years when virtue gradually increases and a descending cycle of
another 12,000 years, in which virtue gradually decreases. Hence, after we
complete a 12,000 year descending cycle from Satya Yuga -> Kali Yuga, the
sequence reverses itself, and an ascending cycle of 12,000 years begins
which goes from Kali Yuga -> Satya Yuga. Yukteswar states that, “Each of
these periods of 12,000 years brings a complete change, both externally in
the material world, and internally in the intellectual or electric world, and is
called one of the Daiva Yugas or Electric Couple.”[6] The 24,000 year
duration of the complete Yuga Cycle closely approximates the Precessional
Year of 25,765 years, which is the time taken by the sun to “precess” i.e.
move backwards, through the 12 zodiac constellations. Interestingly, the
SuryaSiddhantaspeci es a value of 54 arc seconds per year for precession,
as against the current value of 50.29 arc seconds per year. This translates
into a Precessional Year of exactly 24,000 years! This raises the possibility
that the current observed value of precession may simply be a temporary
deviation from the mean.
The concept of an ascending and descending cycle of Yugas is not a
proposition that Yukteswar conjured out of thin air. This idea is still
prevalent among the Jains of India, who are one of the oldest religious sects
of the country. The Jains believe that a complete Time Cycle (Kalachakra) has
a progressive and a regressive half. During the progressive half of the cycle
(Utsarpini), there is a gradual increase in knowledge, happiness, health,
ethics, and spirituality, while during the regressive half of the cycle
(Avasarpini) there is a gradual reduction in these qualities. Each half cycle is
comprised of six smaller periods, and together these two half cycles
constitute a complete Time Cycle. These two half cycles follow each other in
an unbroken succession for eternity, just like the cycles of day and night or
the waxing and waning of the moon. It is possible that Yukteswar may have
been in uenced by the belief system of the ancient Jains; or he may have
based his ideas on ancient oral traditions that are not a part of the
mainstream documented knowledge.
The idea of an ascending and descending Cycle of Ages was also prevalent
in Greek myths. The Greek poet Hesiod (c. 750 BC – 650 BC) had given an
account of the World Ages in the WorksandDays, in which he had inserted
a fth age called the “Age of Heroes”, between the Bronze Age and the Iron
Age. In Hesiod’sCosmos, Jenny Strauss Clay writes:

https://grahamhancock.com/dmisrab6/ 7/25
“Drawing on the myth in Plato’s Statesman, Vernant also claimed that
the temporal framework of Hesiodic myth, that is, the succession of
races, is not linear but cyclical; at the end of the age of iron, which he
divides into two, the cycle of races starts again with a new golden age
or, more likely, a new age of heroes, as the sequence reverses itself...
Vernant himself o ers a solution when he remarks that ‘there is not in
reality one age of iron but two types of human existence.’ ”[7]
This is highly interesting. Jean-Pierre Vernant, who is a highly acclaimed
specialist in ancient Greek culture, clearly believes that the Cycle of the Ages
reverses itself as per Hesiod’s account. Not only that, he states that the Iron
Age has two parts, which corresponds exactly to Yukteswar’s interpretation
in which the descending Kali Yuga is followed by the ascending Kali Yuga. We
can surmise, in this context, that the “Age of Heroes”, which immediately
followed the Bronze Age in Hesiod’s account, must be the name ascribed by
Hesiod to the descendingKaliYuga.
The evidence from di erent sources supports the notion of a complete Yuga
Cycle of 24,000 years, comprised of an ascending and descending cycle of
12,000 years each. This brings us to the question of the relative durations of
the di erent Yugas in the Yuga Cycle, and the transitional periods, which
occur at the beginning and end of each Yuga, and are known as Sandhya
(dawn) and Sandhyansa(twilight) respectively. The following values are
provided in the Sanskrit texts for the duration of the Yugas and their
respective dawns and twilights.
Satya Yuga (Golden Age): 4000 years + 400 years dawn + 400 years
twilight = 4800 years
Treta Yuga (Silver Age): 3000 years + 300 years dawn + 300 years
twilight = 3600 years
Dwapara Yuga (Bronze Age): 2000 years + 200 years dawn + 200 years
twilight = 2400 years
Kali Yuga (Iron Age): 1000 years + 100 years dawn + 100 years twilight
= 1200 years
Since so many inaccuracies have crept into the Yuga Cycle doctrine, as
pointed out by Yukteswar and Tilak, we also need to question the accuracy
of the relative durations of the Yugas mentioned in the Sanskrit texts.
Although the Yuga Cycle is mentioned in the mythic accounts of around
thirty ancient cultures, as described by Giorgio de Santillana, professor of

the history of science at MIT, in the book Hamlet’sMill(1969), we nd very
little information regarding the relative durations of the di erent ages within
this cycle. This is quite surprising. Nearly all the accounts tell us that virtue
and righteousness decreases as we move from the Golden Age to the
subsequent ages. Some of them speci cally mention that virtue decreases
byaquarterin every age. However, there appears to be scant mention of
the durations of the ages themselves. IfthedurationofeachYuga
decreasedfromoneYugatothenext,shouldn’tthisimportantpointalso
havebeenmentionedintheseaccounts?
In the few accounts where the durations of the Yuga are speci ed, we nd
that each age in the Yuga Cycle is of the same duration. For instance, the
Zoroastrians believe that the world lasts for 12,000 years, which is divided
into four equal ages of 3,000 years each. A Mexican source known as the
CodexRios(also referred to as Codex 3738 and Codex Vaticanus A) states
that each age lasts for 4008, 4010, 4801 and 5042 years respectively for a
total of 17,861 years. We can see that in this case also the duration of each
age is nearly the same.
Therefore, the durations of the four Yugas mentioned in the Sanskrit texts
(i.e. 4800, 3600, 2400, and 1200 years) deviate from the norm. The duration
of each Yuga, in this sequence, decreases by 1200 years from the previous
one. This is an arithmeticprogressionwhich is rarely, if ever, found in
natural cycles. This seemingly unnatural sequence raises the question
whether the Yuga durations were deliberately altered at some point in the
past, inordertogivetheimpressionthatthedurationofeachYuga

It is important to note that the ratio’s of the durations of the four Yugas in
this sequence is 4:3:2:1. This gives the super cial impression that the
duration of each Yuga is reducing by a quarter from one to the next. But
that is actually not the case. They are decreasing by a xed number of years
i.e. 1200 years.
Here is the most startling fact: Two of the most famous astronomers of
ancient India, Aryabhatta and Paulisa, both believed that theYugaCycleis
comprisedofYugasofequalduration! In the 11 century, the medieval
scholar Al-Beruni had travelled across India for 13 years, questioning and
conversing with learned men, reading the Sanskrit texts, observing the
religious rites and customs, and had compiled a comprehensive
commentary on Indian philosophy, sciences and culture. In Alberuni’sIndia,
th

https://grahamhancock.com/dmisrab6/ 9/25
Al-Beruni mentions that the Yuga Cycle doctrine was based on the
derivations of the Indian astronomer Brahmagupta, who in turn derived his
knowledge from the Sanskrit Smrititexts. He makes an interesting
statement in this regard:
“Further, Brahmagupta says that “Aryabhatta considers the four yugas
as the four equal parts of the caturyuga(YugaCycle).Thus he di ers
from the doctrine of the book Smriti, just mentioned, and he who
di ers from us is an opponent”.[8]
The fact that Aryabhatta believed the four yugasto be of equal duration is
extremely pertinent! Al-Beruni reasserts this in no uncertain terms:
“Therefore, according to Aryabhatta, the Kali Yuga has 3000 divya
years....each two yugas has 6000 divya years...each three years has 9000
divya years.” Why would Aryabhatta subscribe to such a belief? Did he have
access to sources of information that are lost to us now?
Surprisingly, it was not only Aryabhatta, who held this point of view. Another
celebrated astronomer of ancient India was Paulisa, who had apparently
earned Brahmagupta’s favor by supporting the 4:3:2:1 ratio for the duration
of the yugas. According to Al-Beruni, however, “it is possible that Paulisa
simply mentions this method as one among others, and that it is not that
one in particular which he himself adopted.”[9] This is evident from Paulisa’s
belief regarding the caturyuga, as documented by Al-Beruni: “Of the current
caturyuga(Yuga Cycle), there have elapsed three yugasi.e. according to him
3,240,000 years i.e. 9000 divya-years. The latter number represents three
fourths of the years of a caturyuga.”[10] This indicates that Paulisa believed
that each Yuga was of 3000 divine years’ duration. He uses the same
method while presenting his calculations for the duration of a kalpa where
“he (Pulisa) has not changed the caturyugasinto exact yugas,but simply
changed them into fourth parts, and multiplied these fourth parts by the
number of years of a single fourth part.”[11]
This clearly indicates that two of the most respected astronomers of ancient
India, Aryabhatta and Paulisa, believed in a Yuga Cycle that comprised of 4
Yugas of equal duration of 3,000 divine-years each. However, their opinion
was overshadowed by the contradictory view held by Brahmagupta. He
railed against Aryabhatta and the other astronomers who held di ering
opinions, and even abused them. Al-Beruni says about Brahmagupta:
“He is rude enough to compare Aryabhatta to a worm which, eating
the wood, by chance describes certain characters in it without

understanding them and without intending to draw them. “He,
however, who knows these things thoroughly, stands opposed to
Aryabhatta, Srishena, and Vishnucandra like the lion against gazelles.
They are not capable of letting him see their faces. ” In such o ensive
terms he attacks Aryabhatta and maltreats him.”[12]
We can now understand why Brahmagupta’s opinion nally prevailed over
that of the other astronomers of his time, and it certainly did not have
anything to do with the inherent soundness of his logic, or the authenticity
of his sources.
It is time for us to stop standing in opposition to Aryabhatta, Paulisa,
Srishena, Vishnucandra and others like the “lion against gazelles”, and
instead take cognizance of the very real possibility that the Yugas in the
Yuga Cycle are of equal duration, and the 4:3:2:1 sequence of the Yugas may
have been a mathematical manipulation that crept into the Yuga Cycle
doctrine sometime prior to 500 CE. It is possible that this manipulation was
introduced because people were inclined to believe that the duration of a
Yuga should decrease in tandem with the decrease in virtue and human
longetivity from one Yuga to the next. A neat formula was devised in which
the total duration of the Yugas added up to 12,000 years. However, there
was one problem. If the Kali Yuga is of 1,200 years duration, then it should
have been completed many times over, since its proposed beginning in
3102 BC. In order to circumvent this potentially embarrassing situation,
another complexity was introduced. Each “year” of the Yuga Cycle became a
“divine year” comprised of 360 human years. The Yuga Cycle became
in ated to 4,320,000 years (12,000*360) and the Kali Yuga became equal to
432,000 years (1,200*360). Humanity became consigned to an interminable
duration of darkness.
The original Yuga Cycle doctrine appears to have been very simple: AYuga
Cycledurationof12,000years,witheachYugalastingfor3,000years. This
cycle is encoded in the “Saptarsi Calendar” which has been used in India for
thousands of years. It was used extensively during the Maurya period in the
4 century BC, and is still in use in some parts of India. The term “Saptarsi”
refers to the “Seven Rishis” or the “Seven Sages” representing the seven
stars of the Great Bear constellation (Ursa Major). They are regarded as the
enlightened rishis who appear at the beginning of every Yuga to spread the
laws of civilization. The Saptarsi Calendar used in India had a cycle of 2,700
years; it is said that the Great Bear constellation stays for 100 years in each
th

of the 27 “Nakshatras” (lunar asterisms) which adds up to a cycle of 2,700
years.[13] The 2,700 year cycle was also referred to as a “Saptarsi Era” or a
“Saptarsi Yuga”.
Fig1:TheGreatBearconstellation(UrsaMajor)isclearlyvisibleinthenorthernskythroughoutthe year.ThesevenprominentstarsrepresenttheSevenSages(Saptarshi).TheGreatBearconstellation guresprominentlyinthemythologyofmanycultures.
If the 2,700 year cycle of the Saptarsi Calendar represents the actual
duration of a Yuga, then the remaining 300 years out of the total Yuga
duration of 3,000 years (representing 1/10 of the Yuga duration),
automatically represents the “transitional period”, before the qualities of the
subsequent Yuga are fully manifested. In accordance with the current
convention, this intervening period can be broken up into two separate
periods of 150 years each, one occurring at the beginning of the Yuga,
known as Sandhya(i.e. dawn), and the other at its termination, known as
Sandhyansa(i.e. twilight). The total duration of the Yuga Cycle, excludingthe
transitionalperiods, is equal to (2700*4) i.e. 10,800 years, which is same as
the duration of the “Great Year of Heraclitus” in the Hellenic tradition!
It is agreed by historians that the Saptarsi Calendar that was in use during
the Maurya period in the 4 century BC, started in 6676 BC. In the book,
“TraditionsoftheSevenRsis”, Dr.J.E. Mitchiner con rms this: “We may
conclude that the older and original version of the Era of the Seven Rsis
commenced with the Seven Rsis in Krttika in 6676 BC...This version was in
use in northern India from at least the 4 century BC, as witnessed by the
statements of Greek and Roman writers; it was also the version used by
Vrddha Garga, at around the start of the Christian era.”[14]

In fact, the recorded choronology of Indian kings goes back further than
6676 BC as documented by the Greek and Roman historians Pliny and
Arrian. Pliny states that, “From Father Liber [Roman Bacchus or Greek
Dionysus] to Alexander the Great (d. 323 BC), Indians reckon 154 kings, and
they reckon (the time as) 6451 years and 3 months.”[15] Arrian puts 153
kings and 6462 years between Dionysus and Sandrokottos (Chandragupta
Maurya), to whose court a Greek embassy was sent in 314 BC.[16] Both
indications add up to a date of roughly c.6776 BC, which is a 100 years prior
to the beginning of the Saptarsi Calendar in 6676 BC.
It is obvious from the accounts of Pliny and Arrian that they must have
identi ed a speci ckingin the Indian kings list, who corresponded to the
Greek Dionysus or Roman Bacchus, and whose reign had ended at around
c.6776 BC. Who could that have been? According to the renowned scholar
and Orientalist Sir William Jones, Dionysus or Bacchus was none other than
the Indian monarch Rama. In his essay “OntheGodsofGreece,Italyand
India” (1784), Sir William Jones “deems Rama to be the same as the Grecian
Dionysos, who is said to have conquered India with an army of satyrs,
commanded by Pan; and Rama was also a mighty conqueror, and had an
army of large monkeys or satyrs, commanded by Maruty (Hanuman), son of
Pavan. Rama is also found, in other points, to resemble the Indian
Bacchus.”[17] Sir William Jones also points out that, “Merosis said by the
Greeks to have been a mountain of India, on which their Dionysus was born,
and that Meruis also a mountain near the city of Naishada, or Nysa, called
by the Grecian geographers Dionysopolis, and universally celebrated in the
Sanskrit poems.”[18]
Both Pliny and Arrian were aware of these associations. Pliny had placed the
Dionysian satyrs “in the tropical mountains of India”, while “we learn from
Arrian (Hist.Ind. p 318, 321) that the worship of Bacchus, or Dionysus, was
common in India and that his votaries observed a number of rites similar to
those of Greece...On this account, when Alexander entered India, the
natives considered the Greeks as belonging to the same family with
themselves; and when the people of Nysa sent the principal person of their
city to solicit their freedom of the Grecian conqueror, they conjured him by
the well-known name of Dionysus, as the most e ectual means of obtaining
their purpose. ‘O King, the Nyssaeans entreat thee to allow them to enjoy
their liberties and their laws, out of respect to Dionysus .’”[19]

The identi cation of Dionysus with Rama provides us with fresh
perspectives. According to the Indian tradition, Rama had lived towards the
end of the Treta Yuga (Silver Age), and the Dwapara Yuga (Bronze Age) had
started soon after his demise. This implies that the 6676 BC date for the
beginning of the Saptarsi Calendar, which is a 100 years after Dionysus i.e.
Rama, indicates the beginning of the Dwapara Yuga in the descending cycle.
A later Saptarsi Calendar, still in use in India, began from 3076 BC. But, as
Dr. Subhash Kak points out, “the new count that goes back to 3076 BC was
started later to make it as close to the start of the Kali era as possible”[20].
This modi cation can be easily identi ed, since in 3076 BC, the Great Bear
were in the “Magha” nakshatra (lunar asterism) as mentioned by
Varahamihira in Brihat-Samhita(Brs. 13-3). But Subhash Kak points out that,
“By the time of the Greeks, the naksatras were listed starting with Asvin
(SuryaSiddhanta8.9). As Magha is the tenth naksatra in a count beginning
with Asvin, one needs to add 900 years to nd the epoch for the beginning
of the cycle. This takes one to 3976 BC. One more complete Saptarsi Cycle of
2,700 years before that brings us to 6676 BC.”[21] Since the Dwapara Yuga
immediately precedes the Kali Yuga, we are once again led to the conclusion
that the Saptarsi Calendar with a start date of 6676 BC was counting time
from the Dwapara Yuga.
Fig2:TheListofthe27Nakshatras.TheGreatBearwasinMaghain3076BCandinAshviniin3976BC/6676BC
We also know that the Saptarsi Calendar used during the Mauryan period
was used for tracking the genealogical records of the Mahabharata war
kings. Since the Mahabharata describes events that transpired in the
Dwapara Yuga, there cannot be any doubt that the Saptarsi Cycle beginning
6676 BC marks the beginning of the descending Dwapara Yuga. If we use
this date as the anchor point, and the Saptarsi Calendar as the basis for the
Yuga Cycle durations (i.e. Yuga duration of 2,700 years, with transitional
periods of 300 years), then the entire timeline of the Yuga Cycle gets
unraveled:

Fig3:YugaCycleTimeline.
This Yuga Cycle timeline takes the beginning of the Golden Age to 12676 BC,
more than 14,500 years before present, when the Great Bear was in the
“Shravana” nakshatra (the Great Bear will advance by 3 nakshtras in every
Yuga because of the 300 year transitional period). This agrees very well with
the Indian tradition, since the Mahabharatamentions that in the ancient
tradition the Shravana nakshatra was given the rst place in the Nakshatra
cycle. The timeline also indicates that the ascending Kali Yuga, which is the
current epoch in which we are living, will end in 2025 CE. The full
manifestation of the next Yuga – the ascending Dwapara – will take place in
2325 CE, after a transitional period of 300 years. The ascending Dwapara
Yuga will then be followed by two more Yugas: the ascending Treta Yuga and
the ascending Satya Yuga, which will complete the 12,000 year ascending
cycle. The Sanskrit text Brahma-vaivartaPuranadescribes a dialogue
between Lord Krishna and the Goddess Ganges. Here, Krishna says that
after 5,000 years of Kali Yuga there will be a dawn of a new Golden Age
which will last for 10,000 years (Text 50, 59). This can be immediately
understood in the context of the Yuga Cycle timeline described here. We are
now ending the Kali Yuga, nearly 5,700 years since its beginning in 3676 BC.
And the end of the Kali Yuga will be followed by three more Yugas spanning
9,000 years, before the ascending cycle ends.
Part 2: The archaeological and historical evidence
According to the Yuga Cycle doctrine, the transitional periods between
Yugas are alwaysassociated with a worldwide collapse of civilizations and
severe environmental catastrophes, which wipe out virtually every trace of

any human civilization. The new civilization that emerges in the new Yuga is
guided by a few survivors of the cataclysm, who carry with them the
technical and spiritual knowledge of the previous epoch. Many ancient
sources tell us of the enigmatic group of “Seven Sages” (“Saptarsi”) who are
said to appear at the beginning of every Yuga and promulgate the arts of
civilization. We nd them in myths from across the world – in Sumeria, India,
Polynesia, South America and North America. They possessed in nite
wisdom and power, could travel over land and water, and took on various
forms at will. Were they the survivors of the previous Yuga or visitors from
outer space? Opinions di er on this point, but surely neither option can be
discarded without proper scrutiny. In any case, the main point is that the
transitional periods between Yugas must necessarily correlate with the
severe cataclysmic events that regularly impact our planet, as re ected in
the archeological records. As we shall see, the Yuga Cycle timeline proposed
here correlates with these catastrophic events with a stunning accuracy. In
addition, the transitional periods can also be correlated with dates recorded
in various ancient calendars and traditions.
The rst transitional period in the 12,000 year descending Yuga Cycle is the
300 year period at the end of the Golden Age from 9976 BC – 9676 BC. This
is the time when the last Ice Age came to a sudden end; the climate became
very warm quite abruptly, and several large mammalian species such as the
woolly mammoth became extinct. A number of scienti c studies show that a
devastating global ood occurred at around 9600 BC.[22] This is in
accordance with many ancient traditions and legends. In the Timaeus,Plato
talks of the mythical island of Atlantis, which was swallowed up by the sea in
a “single day and night of misfortune” in c.9600 BC. This event has also been
recorded in the ood myths of many ancient cultures, which almost
uniformly talk of enormous walls of water that submerged the entire land to
the highest mountain tops, accompanied by heavy rain, reballs from the
sky, intense cold and long periods of darkness. In the Indian tradition, this
ood took place at the end of the Satya Yuga (Golden Age). The survivor of
this great deluge was Manu, the progenitor of mankind, who is placed at the
head of the genealogy of Indian kings.
What could have led to this sudden worldwide deluge? Archaeologist Bruce
Masse of the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico had examined
a sample of 175 ood myths from di erent cultures around the world and
concluded that the environmental aspects described in these events, which
is also consistent with the archaeological and geophysical data, could have

only been precipitated by a destructive, deep-water, oceanic comet impact.
[23] In 2008, a team of Danish geologists from the Niels Bohr Institute (NBI)
in Copenhagen studied the ice core data from Greenland, and concluded
that the ice age ended exactly in 9703 BC. Researcher Jorgen Peder
Ste ensen said that, “in the transition from the ice age to our current warm,
interglacial period the climate shift is so sudden that it is as if a button was
pressed”[24]. More recently, in 2012, an international team of scientists
concluded that the earth was bombarded by a meteorite storm nearly
12,000 years ago, which e ectively ended the ice age, and led to the end of
a prehistoric civilization and the extinction of many animal species.[25] It is
interesting to note that the 9703 BC date for the sudden climate shift falls
within the 300 year transitional period at the end of the Golden Age from
9976 BC – 9676 BC, and as such, it provides the rst important validation of
the Yuga Cycle timeline identi ed here.
The 300 year transitional period between the Treta Yuga (Silver Age) and the
Dwapara Yuga (Bronze Age) from 6976 BC – 6676 BC also coincides with a
signi cant environmental event – the BlackSeaCatastrophewhich has
recently been dated to 6700 BC. The Black Sea once used to be a freshwater
lake. That is, until the Mediterranean Sea, swollen with melted glacial
waters, breached a natural dam, and cut through the narrow Bosphorous
Strait, catastrophically ooding the Black Sea. This raised the water levels of
the Black Sea by several hundred feet, ooded more than 60,000 square
miles of land, and signi cantly expanded the Black Sea shoreline (by around
30%).[26] This event fundamentally changed the course of civilization in
Southeastern Europe and western Anatolia. Geologists Bill Ryan and Walter
Pitman of Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory in New York, who had rst
proposed the Black Sea Catastrophe hypothesis, have gone to the extent of
comparing it to Noah’sFlood.
Similar major ooding events were taking place in many parts of the world,
as massive glacial lakes, swelled by the waters of the melting ice, breached
their ice barriers, and rushed into the surrounding areas. In the book
Underworld, Graham Hancock has described some of the terrible events
that ravaged the planet during that time. Sometime between 6900 BC
6200 BC the Laurentide ice-sheet disintegrated in the Hudson Bay and an
enormous quantity of glacial waters from the inland Lake Agassiz/Ojibway
discharged into the Labrador Sea. This was possibly the “single largest ood
of the Quarternary Period”, which may have single-handedly raised global
sea-level by half a metre.[27] The period between 7000 BC – 6000 BC was

also characterized by the occurrences of gigantic earthquakes in Europe. In
northern Sweden, some of these earthquakes caused “waves on the
ground”, 10 metres high, referred to as “rock tsunamis”. It is possible that
the global chain of cataclysmic events during this transitional period may
have been triggered by a single underlying cause, which we are yet to nd
out.

The transitional period between the Dwapara Yuga and Kali Yuga, from 3976
BC – 3676 BC was again marked by a series of environmental cataclysms,
whose exact nature remains a mystery. It is referred to in geology as the 5.9
kiloyearevent, and it is considered as one of the most intense aridi cation
events during the Holocene period. It occurred around 3900 BC, ending the
Neolithic Subpluvial and initiated the most recent desiccation of the Sahara
desert. At the same time, between 4000 BC – 3500 BC, the coastal plains of
Sumer experienced severe ooding, which “was the local e ect of a
worldwide episode of rapid, relatively short-term ooding known as the
Flandrian transgression – which had a signi cant impact not only along the
shores of the Gulf but in many other parts of Asia as well.”[28] This
catastrophic ooding event led to the end of the Ubaid period in
Mesopotemia, and triggered a worldwide migration to river valleys.

https://grahamhancock.com/dmisrab6/ 18/25
This transitional period between the Yugas is recorded in many ancient
calendars, as we nd a clustering of important dates around this epoch. For
a very long time, there was a prevalent belief in the western world that the
world was created in 4004 BC. This date comes to us from the genealogies
of the OldTestament. This date is just 28 years prior to the end of the
Dwapara and the beginning of the transitional period. A Saptarsi Calendar,
still in use in India, counted time in the Kali Yuga starting from 3976 BC,
which coincides with the beginning of the transitional period. The year of
world creation in the Jewish religious calendar is 3761 BC, which is in the
middle of the transitional period.
The famous Mahabharata War of the Indian subcontinent, which took place
during the transitional period between Yugas, 35 years prior to the
beginning of the Kali Yuga, can now be dated to 3711 BC. The Mahabharata
mentions that the Dwapara Yuga ended and the Kali Yuga started as soon as
Krishna left this world; and then the seas swelled up and submerged the
island-city of Dwarka, which was located o the coast of western India. In
2002, the National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIO), India, discovered
two cities submerged in the Gulf of Cambay, at a depth of 120 feet. These
mysterious submerged cities were laid out in a grid, had towering walls,
massive geometrical buildings and huge engineering works such as dams,
and they stood entirely above water around 7,000 years ago. Nearly 2,000
man-made artifacts were recovered from the sites, some of which have
been carbon dated to 6500 BC – 7500 BC, indicating their existence in the
Dwapara Yuga.

As per the ancient traditions, the descending Kali Yuga, which was referred
to by Hesiod as the “Age of Heroes”, came to an end with the battle fought
on the plains of Troy. The Yuga Cycle timeline indicates that the 300 year
intervening period between the descending and ascending Kali Yuga
extended from 976 BC – 676 BC; and very interestingly, this overlaps with
the 300 year period from 1100 BC to 800 BC which is referred to by
historians as the GreekDarkAges! The archaeological evidence shows that
tremendous destruction visited the Greek isles at this time. The great
Mycenaean cities and palaces collapsed. Villages and towns were burnt,
destroyed and abandoned. The population of the cities reduced drastically,
there was widespread famine and people lived in isolated, small
settlements. Such was the magnitude of the cataclysms that ancient Greeks
entirely forgot the art of writing which they had to re-learn from the
Phoenicians in the 8 century! The ancient trade networks were disrupted
and came to a grinding halt.
However, this was not just a collapse of the ancient Greek civilization; there
was a worldwide collapse of civilizations during this period. The Hittites
su ered serious disruption and cities from Troy to Gaza were destroyed.
Egypt too lost control over its kingdom. The period from 1070 BC – 664 BC is
known as the “Third Intermediate Period” of Egypt, during which time Egypt
was run over and ruled by foreign rulers, and there was political and social
disintegration and chaos. Egypt was increasingly beset by a series of
droughts, below-normal ooding of the Nile, and famine. In India, the Indus
Valley civilization nally ended at around 1000 BC. Catastrophe also struck
the ancient Olmec civilization of Mesoamerica at this time. The rst Olmec
center, San Lorenzo, was abandoned at around 900 BC. A wholesale
destruction of many San Lorenzo monuments also occurred in c.950 BC,
and scholars believe that drastic environmental changes may have been
responsible for this shift in Olmec centers, with certain important rivers
changing course.
Once again we don’t know what may have triggered this calamitous turn of
events across the world. Historians speculate about a combination of
catastrophic climatic events. Egyptian accounts tell us that, “something in
the air prevented much sunlight from reaching the ground and also arrested
global tree growth for almost two full decades until 1140 BC.”[29] One
proposed cause is the Hekla 3 eruption of the Hekla volcano in Iceland, but
the dating of that event remains in dispute. However, since the descending
and ascending Kali Yuga are not so di erent in terms of their qualitative
th

aspects, the level of devastation during this transitional period was perhaps
not as severe as the previous one, as a result of which some aspects of
civilization survived.
When the ascending Kali Yuga began in 676 BC, much of the knowledge,
traditions and skills from the descending Kali Yuga were lost. In Greece, the
construction of monumental architecture ceased. The cavalry was replaced
by foot soldiers.Pottery styles were simpli ed. In India, the use of Sanskrit
as the means of communication was replaced by the language of the
common masses – Pali and Prakrit. Knowledge of the ancient scriptures,
sciences and arts had been all but forgotten. Possibly in response to this
grave social crisis, a number of philosophers and prophets appeared at this
time, trying to re-discover the lost wisdom, and spread it amongst the
ignorant masses. Among them were Buddha (623 BC), Pythagoras (570 BC),
Zoroaster (600 BC), and Mahavir Jain (599 BC).
People were so perturbed by the calamities of the previous centuries that
they began a vigorous attempt to nally document the ancient scriptures,
which were till then being transmitted in a purely oral fashion. It was in this
grave social and cultural milieu that the Mayans re-calculated and re
calibrated their calendric system at Izapa sometime after 400 BC. And a few
centuries later Aryabhatta and others attempted to x the beginnings of the
Kali Yuga. Such an e ort would have been quite un-necessary if the
cataclysms of the previous centuries had not disrupted the ow of the rich
oral traditions. However, much of the knowledge from the previous epoch
was irretrievably lost. For instance, the original Vedas were comprised of
1,180 sakhas (i.e. branches), of which only 7 or 8 sakhas (less than 1 %) are
remembered now. As a result, it is only natural to expect that even within
the texts that were nally documented, various errors and omissions had
crept in. The mistakes in the Yuga Cycle doctrine were some of them.
The Yuga Cycle timelines proposed here accurately mirrors the worldwide
environmental catastrophes that accompanies the transitional periods
between Yugas. The four key transitional periods, since the end of the
Golden Age, have been summarized here:

Fig7:TheTransitionalPeriodsbetweenYugas
This recurrent pattern of devastation is clearly discernible in the
archaeological records. Every 2,700 years our planet is impacted by a series
of cataclysmic events for a period of a few hundred years, which brings
about a total or near total collapse of civilizations across the world. In all the
cases, however, we nd that civilization restarts immediately after the
period of destruction.
In recent years, many independent historians and researchers have realized
that the concept of a Yuga Cycle is a far better descriptor of ancient history,
than the model of linear progress favored by mainstream historians.
Egyptologist John Anthony West, whose seminal work on the dating of the
Sphinx has won him worldwide acclaim, mentions in his article “Consider
theKaliYuga” that:
“Since Egypt’s Old Kingdom, up until very recently...civilization has
been going down, not up; simple as that. We can follow that
degenerative process physically in Egypt; it is written into the stones
and it is unmistakable. The same tale is told in the mythologies and
legends of virtually all other societies and civilizations the world over...
Progress does not go in a straight line from primitive ancestors to
smart old us with our bobblehead dolls and weapons of mass
destruction; our tra c jams and our polluted seas, skies and lands.
There is another, and far more realistic, way to view history. Plato
talked about a cycle of Ages: Golden, Silver, Bronze and Iron (or Dark)
Age; a cycle, a wave form – not a straight line. A similar understanding
is re ected by virtually all other ancient accounts. The best known, and
by far the most elaborately developed of these systems, is the Hindu,
with its Yuga Cycle, which corresponds to the Platonic idea of four
de nable Ages.”[30]



2022. 05. 01. 16:12 The end of the Kali Yuga in 2025: Unraveling the mysteries of the Yuga Cycle - Graham Hancock Official Website
https://grahamhancock.com/dmisrab6/ 23/25
It is evident that the original Yuga Cycle was based on the Saptarsi Calendar.
It was of 12,000 years duration, comprised of four Yugas of equal duration
of 2,700 years each, separated by transitional periods of 300 years. The
complete Yuga Cycle of 24,000 years was comprised of an ascending and
descending Yuga cycle, which followed each other for eternity like the cycles
of day and night. For the past 2,700 years we have been evolving through
the ascending Kali Yuga, and this Yuga is coming to an end in 2025. The end
of the Yuga will inevitably be followed by cataclysmic earth changes and
civilization collapses, as is characteristic of the transitional periods. The
Dwapara Yuga is fundamentally di erent from the Kali in its spiritual and
material dimensions, as can be gleaned from the ancient texts. Hence, we
may anticipate far-reaching changes in our environment, and possibly in our
cosmic neighborhood, as we transition to this period of enhanced
consciousness. The current upswing in tectonic activities and the increased
incidence of extreme weather phenomena may be indicative of the fact that
we are slowly entering into a period of volatile earth changes. We need to be
aware of these greater cycles of time that govern human civilization, and the
changes that are looming in the horizon.
