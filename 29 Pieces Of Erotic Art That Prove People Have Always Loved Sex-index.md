29 Pieces Of Erotic Art That Prove
People Have Always Loved Sex
Sexuality has been a part of the human experience since our
inception as a species.
Since the beginning of civilization, humans have incorporated
sexuality into erotic art, worship, and daily life. There have been
cultures and times were explicit references to sexuality were more
accepted by societal norms, and times when there have not.



However, the repressive view of sexuality espoused by the Church in
the Middle Ages, and then the repressed sexuality of the Victorian
era have left many in the Western world believing that few if any in
the past were willing and able to accept and even revel in their
sexuality.
Most of us look to the past and think of an era where sexuality was a
taboo subject, until the groundbreaking social changes of the 60s
and 70s.
This view was supported by many of the authorities of the 20th
century, who often edited explicitly sexual objects and events out of
history books and museums.
When the lost city of Pompeii was first rediscovered in the 19th
century, King Francis of Sicily had all the many sex artifacts found
placed in a "secret cabinet" to be locked away.
As sexual norms have changed through the course of the 20th
century, we have begun to see the true nature of the past, and see
that many past civilizations celebrated sexuality and genitalia in a
way that would seem extreme today.
Sculptures of penises and vaginas are rampant throughout cultures
across the world, with many using exaggerated figures of theses
genitals as representations of gods of fertility.
From Rome to India to Persia to the Americas, sexual art existed
throughout the ancient world. Sexual art was sometimes used to
denote that a place was a brothel, to promote fertility, to tell sexual
stories, or even to mark graves.
Here are some of the most interesting historical pieces of erotic art.
