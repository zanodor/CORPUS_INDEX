PREFACE vii
peoples in other cultural areas where they were similarly
overlaid with local colour* Modes of thought were the
products of modes of life and were influenced in their
development by human experiences. The influence of environment on the growth of culture has long been recognized, but consideration must also be given to the
choice of environment by peoples who had adopted
distinctive habits of life. Racial units migrated from
cultural areas to districts suitable for colonization and
carried with them a heritage of immemorial beliefs and
customs which were regarded as being quite as in
dispensable for their welfare as their implements and domesticated animals.
' When consideration is given in this connection to the
conservative element in primitive religion, it is not sur
prising to find that the growth of religious myths was not so spontaneous in early civilizations of the highest order as has hitherto been assumed. It seems clear that in each
great local mythology we have to deal, in the first place,
not with symbolized ideas so much as symbolized folk
beliefs of remote antiquity and, to a certain degree, of
common inheritance. It may not be found possible to arrive at a conclusive solution of the most widespread,
and therefore the most ancient folk myths, such as, for
instance, the Dragon Myth, or the myth of the culture
hero. Nor,^ perhaps, is it necessary that we should concern ourselves greatly regarding the origin of the idea
of the dragon, which in one country symbolized fiery drought and in another overwhelming river floods.
The student will find footing on surer ground by
following the process which exalts the dragon of the folk
tale into the symbol of evil and primordial chaos. The
Babylonian Creation Myth, for instance, can be shown to be a localized and glorified legend in which the hero and



viii PREFACE
his tribe are displaced by the war god and his fellow
deities whose welfare depends on his prowess. Merodach
kills the dragon, Tiamat, as the heroes of Eur-Asian folk
stories kill grisly hags, by casting his weapon down her throat.
He severed her inward parts, he pierced her heart,
He overcame her and cut off her life; He cast down her body and stood upon it ...
And with merciless club he smashed her skull. He cut through the channels of her blood,
And he made the north wind to bear it away into secret places.
Afterwards
He divided the flesh of the Ku-pu and devised a cunning plan.
Mr. L. W. King, from whose scholarly Seven Tablets
of Creation these lines are quoted, notes that "Ku-pu" is
a word of uncertain meaning. Jensen suggests "trunk, body". Apparently Merodach obtained special know
ledge after dividing, and perhaps eating, the "Ku-pu". His "cunning plan" is set forth in detail: he cut up the
dragon's body:
He split her up like a flat fish into two halves.
He formed the heavens with one half and the earth with the other, and then set the universe in order. His power and wisdom as the Demiurge were derived from
the fierce and powerful Great Mother, Tiamat.
In other dragon stories the heroes devise their plans
after eating the dragon's heart. According to Philostratus,1 Apollonius of Tyana was worthy of being remembered for two things his bravery in travelling among fierce robber tribes, not then subject to Rome, and his
1 Life of Apollonius of Tyana, i, 20.



PREFACE ix
wisdom in learning the language of birds and other ani
mals as the Arabs do. This accomplishment the Arabs
acquired, Philostratus explains, by eating the hearts of
dragons. The "animals" who utter magic words are, of
course, the Fates. Siegfried of the Nibelungenlied, after slaying the Regin dragon, makes himself invulnerable by
bathing in its blood. He obtains wisdom by eating the heart : as soon as he tastes it he can understand the
language of birds, and the birds reveal to him that Mimer
is waiting to slay him. Sigurd similarly makes his plans after eating the heart of the Fafner dragon. In Scottish
legend Finn-mac-Coul obtains the power to divine secrets
by partaking of a small portion of the seventh salmon
associated with the " well dragon ", and Michael Scott
and other folk heroes become great physicians after tasting the juices of the middle part of the body of the white
snake. The hero of an Egyptian folk tale slays a "death
less snake " by cutting it in two parts and putting sand
between the parts. He then obtains from the box, of which it is the guardian, the book of spells ; when he reads a page of the spells he knows what the birds of the
sky, the fish of the deep, and the beasts of the hill say; the book gives him power to enchant "the heaven and the earthj^the abyss, the mountains and the sea".1
Magic and religion were never separated in Babylonia;
not only the priests but also the gods performed magical ceremonies. Ea, Merodach's father, overcame Apsu, the
husband of the dragon Tiamat, by means of spells : he was "the great magician of the gods". Merodach's division of the "Ku-pu" was evidently an act of con
tagious magic ; by eating or otherwise disposing of the vital part of the fierce and wise mother dfagon, he became
endowed with her attributes, and was able to proceed

with the work of creation. Primitive peoples in our own
day, like the Abipones of Paraguay, eat the flesh of fierce
and cunning animals so that their strength, courage, and wisdom may be increased.
The direct influence exercised by cultural contact, on
the other hand, may be traced when myths with an alien
geographical setting are found among peoples whose experiences could never have given them origin. In India,
where the dragon symbolizes drought and the western
river deities are female, the Manu fish and flood legend
resembles closely the Babylonian, and seems to throw
light upon it. Indeed, the Manu myth appears to have
been derived from the lost flood story in which Ea figured
prominently in fish form as the Preserver. The Baby
lonian Ea cult and the Indian Varuna cult had apparently
much in common, as is shown.
Throughout this volume special attention has been
paid to the various peoples who were in immediate con
tact with, and were influenced by, Mesopotamia!! civiliza
tion. The histories are traced in outline of the Kingdoms
of Elam, Urartu (Ancient Armenia), Mitanni, and the Hittites, while the story of the rise and decline of the
Hebrew civilization, as narrated in the Bible and referred
to in Mesopotamia!! inscriptions, is related from the earliest times until the captivity in the Neo-Babylonian
period and the restoration during the age of the Persian
Empire. The struggles waged between the great Powers for the control of trade routes, and the periodic migrations
of pastoral warrior folks who determined the fate of
empires, are also dealt with, so that light may be thrown
on the various processes and influences associated with
the developments of local religions and mythologies.
Special chapters, with comparative notes, are devoted to the Ishtar-Tammuz myths, the Semiramis legends, Ashur



PREFACE xi
and his symbols, and the origin and growth of astrology
and astronomy.
The ethnic disturbances which occurred at various
well-defined periods in the Tigro-Euphrates valley were not always favourable to the advancement of knowledge
and the growth of culture. The invaders who absorbed
Sumerian civilization may have secured more settled con
ditions by welding together political units, but seem to have exercised a retrogressive influence on the growth of
local culture. " Babylonian religion ", writes Dr. Langdon,
" appears to have reached its highest level in the Sumerian
period, or at least not later than 2000 B.C. From that
period onward to the first century B.C. popular religion maintained with great difficulty the sacred standards of
the past/' Although it has been customary to characterize Mesopotamian civilization as Semitic, modern
research tends to show that the indigenous inhabitants,
who were non-Semitic, were its originators. Like the
proto-Egyptians, the early Cretans, and the Pelasgians in southern Europe and Asia Minor, they invariably achieved the intellectual conquest of their conquerors, as in the
earliest times they had won victories over the antagonistic forces of nature. If the modern view is accepted that
these ancient agriculturists of the goddess cult were of
common racial origin, it is to the most representative communities of the widespread Mediterranean race that the credit belongs of laying the foundations of the brilliant civilizations of the ancient world in southern
Europe, and Egypt, and the valley of the Tigris and Euphrates.

INTRODUCTION
Ancient Babylonia has made stronger appeal to the imagination of Christendom than even Ancient Egypt,
because of its association with the captivity of the
Hebrews, whose sorrows are enshrined in the familiar
psalm :
By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down;
Yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion.
We hanged our harps upon the willows. . . .
In sacred literature proud Babylon became the city of
the anti-Christ, the symbol of wickedness and cruelty
And human vanity. Early Christians who suffered persecution compared their worldly state to that of the
oppressed and disconsolate Hebrews, and, like them,
they sighed for Jerusalem the new Jerusalem. When St. John the Divine had visions of the ultimate triumph
of Christianity, he referred to its enemies the unbelievers
and persecutors as the citizens of the earthly Babylon,
the doom of which he pronounced in stately and memor
able phrases :
Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen,
And is become the habitation of devils,
And the hold of every foul spirit,
And a cage of every unclean and hateful bird . , .



xxii MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
For her sins have reached unto heaven And God hath remembered her iniquities . . . The merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her,
For no man buyeth their merchandise any more.
"At the noise of the taking of Babylon ", cried Jeremiah,
referring to the original Babylon, " the earth is moved,
and the cry is heard among the nations. ... It shall
be no more inhabited forever ; neither shall it be dwelt
in from generation to generation." The Christian Saint rendered more profound the brooding silence of the deso
lated city of his vision by voicing memories of its beauty
and gaiety and bustling trade :
The voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers and trumpeters shall be heard no more at all in thee; And no craftsman, of whatsoever craft he be, shall be found any more in thee; And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee; And the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard
no more at all in thee: For thy merchants were the great men of the earth; For by thy sorceries were all nations deceived.
And in her was found the blood of prophets^ and of saints^ And of all that were slain upon the earth.1
So for nearly two thousand years has the haunting
memory of the once-powerful city pervaded Christian literature, while its broken walls and ruined temples and
palaces lay buried deep in desert sand. The history of the ancient land of which it was the capital survived in
but meagre and fragmentary form, mingled with accumu
lated myths and legends. A slim volume contained all that could be derived from references in the Old Testa
ment and the compilations of classical writers.
1 Revelation, xviii. The Babylon of the Apocalypse is generally believed to symbolize or be a mystic designation of Rome,



INTRODUCTION xxiii
It is only within the past half-century that the wonder
ful story of early Eastern civilization has been gradually
pieced together by excavators and linguists, who have thrust open the door of the past and probed the hidden
secrets of long ages. We now know more about "the
land of Babel " than did not only the Greeks and Romans,
but even the Hebrew writers who foretold its destruction.
Glimpses are being afforded us of its life and manners
and customs for some thirty centuries before the captives
of Judah uttered lamentations on the banks of its reedy
canals. The sites of some of the ancient cities of Baby
lonia and Assyria were identified by European officials
and travellers in the East early 411 the nineteenth century,
and a few relics found their way to Europe. But before
Sir A. H. Layard set to work as an excavator in the
"forties**, "a case scarcely three feet square", as he him
self wrote, " enclosed all that remained not only of the
great city of Nineveh, but of Babylon itself ".l
Layard, the distinguished pioneer Assyriologist, was
an Englishman of Huguenot descent, who was born in Paris. Through his mother he inherited a strain of
Spanish blood. During his early boyhood he resided in Italy, and his education, which began there, was continued
in schools in France, Switzerland, and England. He
was a man of scholarly habits and fearless and inde
pendent character, a charming writer, and an accomplished fine-art critic ; withal he was a great traveller, a strenuous
politician, and an able diplomatist. In 1845, while sojourning in the East, he undertook the exploration of
ancient Assyrian cities. He first set to work at Kalkhi,
the Biblical Calah. Three years previously M. P. C
Botta, the French consul at Mosul, had begun to in
vestigate the Nineveh mounds ; but these he abandoned
1 Nineveh and Its Remains, vol. i, p. 17.



xxiv MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
for a mound near Khorsabad which proved to be the site
of the city erected by c< Sargon the Later'*, who is referred
to by Isaiah. The relics discovered by Botta and his suc
cessor, Victor Place, are preserved in the Louvre At Kalkhi and Nineveh Layard uncovered the palaces
of some of the most famous Assyrian Emperors, including the Biblical Shalmaneser and Esarhaddon, and obtained
the colossi, bas reliefs, and other treasures of antiquity which formed the nucleus of the British Museum's un
rivalled Assyrian collection. He also conducted diggings
at Babylon and Niffer (Nippur), His work was con
tinued by his assistant, Hormuzd Rassam, a native Christian of Mosul, near Nineveh, Rassam studied for a time at Oxford. The discoveries made by Layard and Botta stimulated
others to follow their example. In the "fifties" Mr. W.
K. Loftus engaged in excavations at Larsa and Erech,
where important discoveries were made of ancient build
ings, ornaments, tablets, sarcophagus graves, and pot burials, while Mr. J. E. Taylor operated at Ur, the seat
of the moon cult and the birthplace of Abraham, and at
Eridu, which is generally regarded as the cradle of early
Babylonian (Sumerian) civilization. In 1854 Sir Henry Rawlinson superintended diggings
at Birs Nimrud (Borsippa, near Babylon), and excavated relics of the Biblical Nebuchadrezzar. This notable
archaeologist began his career in the East as an officer
in the Bombay army. He distinguished himself as a
political agent and diplomatist. While resident at Baghdad, he devoted his leisure time to cuneiform studies. One of his remarkable feats was the copying of the famous trilingual rock inscription of Darius the Great on a mountain cliff at Behistun, in Persian Kurdistan. This
work was carried out at great personal risk, for the cliff



INTRODUCTION xxv
is 1700 feet high and the sculptures and inscriptions are situated about 300 feet from the ground. Darius was the first monarch of his line to make use of the Persian cuneiform script, which in this case he
utilized in conjunction with the older and more compli
cated Assyro-Babylonian alphabetic and syllabic characters to record a portion of the history of his reign. Rawlinson's translation of the famous inscription was an important contribution towards the decipherment of the
cuneiform writings of Assyria and Babylonia.
Twelve years of brilliant Mesopotamia!! discovery concluded in 1854, and further excavations had to be suspended until the "seventies" on account of the un
settled political conditions of the ancient land and the
difficulties experienced in dealing with Turkish officials.
During the interval, however, archaeologists and philolo
gists were kept fully engaged studying the large amount of material which had been accumulated. Sir Henry
Rawlinson began the issue of his monumental work
The Cuneiform Inscriptions of Western Asia on behalf of
the British Museum.
Goodspeed refers to the early archaeological work as
the " Heroic Period " of research, and says that the
u Modern Scientific Period " began with Mr. George
Smith's expedition to Nineveh in 1873.
George Smith, like Henry Schliemann, the pioneer
investigator of pre-Hellenic culture, was a self-educated
man of humble origin. He was born at Chelsea in 1840.
At fourteen he was apprenticed to an engraver. He was a youth of studious habits and great originality, and interested himself intensely in the discoveries which had
been made by Layard and other explorers. At the
British Museum, which he visited regularly to pore over
the Assyrian inscriptions, he attracted the attention of Sir



xxvi MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
Henry Rawlinson. So greatly impressed was Sir Henry by the young man's enthusiasm and remarkable intelli
gence that he allowed him the use of his private room
and provided casts and squeezes of inscriptions to assist him in his studies. Smith made rapid progress. His
earliest discovery was the date of the payment of tribute
by Jehu, King of Israel, to the Assyrian Emperor Shalmaneser. Sir Henry availed himself of the young in
vestigator's assistance in producing the third volume of
The Cuneiform Inscriptions. In 1867 Smith received an appointment in the Assyri
ology Department of the British Museum, and a few years later became famous throughout Christendom as
the translator of fragments of the Babylonian Deluge
Legend from tablets sent to London by Rassam. Sir
Edwin Arnold, the poet and Orientalist, was at the time
editor of the T>aily Telegraph, and performed a memorable
service to modern scholarship by dispatching Smith, on behalf of his paper, to Nineveh to search for other fragments of the Ancient Babylonian epic. Rassam had obtained the tablets from the great library of the cultured
Emperor Ashur-bani-pal, " the great and noble Asnapper "
of the Bible, 1 who took delight, as he himself recorded, in
The wisdom of Ea, 2 the art of song, the treasures of science.
This royal patron of learning included in his library collection, copies and translations of tablets from Baby
lonia. Some of these were then over 2000 years old.
The Babylonian literary relics were, indeed, of as great antiquity to Ashur-bani-pal as that monarch's relics are
to us.
The Emperor invoked Nebo, god of wisdom and
learning, to bless his "books", praying:
l xrat iv, 10. 2 The culture god.

Mr. George Smith's expedition to Nineveh in 1873 was
exceedingly fruitful of results. More tablets were dis
covered and translated. In the following year he returned to the ancient Assyrian city on behalf of the
British Museum, and added further by his scholarly
achievements to his own reputation and the world's
knowledge of antiquity. His last expedition was made early in 1876 ; on his homeward journey he was stricken
down with fever, and on 1 9th August he died at Aleppo
in his thirty-sixth year. So was a brilliant career brought
to an untimely end. Rassam was engaged to continue Smith's great work,
and between 1877 an d 1882 made many notable dis
coveries in Assyria and Babylonia, including the bronze doors of a Shalmaneser temple, the sun temple at Sippar;
the palace of the Biblical Nebuchadrezzar, which was
famous for its "hanging gardens'
1
; a cylinder of Na~ bonidus, King of Babylon ; and about fifty thousand tablets.
M. de Sarzec, the French consul at Bassorah, began in 1877 excavations at the ancient Sumerian city of
Lagash (Shirpula), and continued them until 1900. He found thousands of tablets, many bas reliefs, votive
statuettes, which worshippers apparently pinned on sacred shrines, the famous silver vase of King Entemena, statues
of King Gudea, and various other treasures which are
now in the Louvre. The pioneer work achieved by British and French
excavators stimulated interest all over the world. An

expedition was sent out from the United States by the
University of Pennsylvania, and began to operate at
Nippur in 1888. The Germans, who have displayed great
activity in the domain of philological research, are at present
represented by an exploring party which is conducting the
systematic exploration of the ruins of Babylon. Even the Turkish Government has encouraged research work, and its excavators have accumulated a fine collection of
antiquities at Constantinople. Among the archaeologists
and linguists of various nationalities who are devoting
themselves to the study of ancient Assyrian and Baby
lonian records and literature, and gradually unfolding the
story of ancient Eastern civilization, those of our own
country occupy a prominent position. One of the most interesting discoveries of recent years has been new
fragments of the Creation Legend by L. W. King of the British Museum, whose scholarly work, The Seven Tablets
of Creation, is the standard work on the subject.
The archaeological work conducted in Persia, Asia
Minor, Palestine, Cyprus, Crete, the ./Egean, and Egypt
has thrown, and is throwing, much light on the relations
between the various civilizations of antiquity. In addi
tion to the Hittite discoveries, with which the name of
Professor Sayce will ever be associated as a pioneer, we
now hear much of the hitherto unknown civilizations of
Mitanni and Urartu (ancient Armenia), which contributed
to the shaping of ancient history. The Biblical narratives
of the rise and decline of the Hebrew kingdoms have also
been greatly elucidated.
In this volume, which deals mainly with the intel
lectual life of the Mesopotamia!! peoples, a historical
narrative has been provided as an appropriate setting for the myths and legends. In this connection the reader
must be reminded that the chronology of the early



INTRODUCTION xxix
period is still uncertain. The approximate dates which
are given, however, are those now generally adopted by most European and American authorities. Early Babylonian history of the Sumertan period begins some time
prior to 3000 B.C.; Sargon of Akkad flourished about
2650 B.C., and Hammurabi not long before or after
2000 B.C. The inflated system of dating which places
Mena of Egypt as far back as 5500 B.C. and Sargon at about 3800 B.C. has been abandoned by the majority of
prominent archaeologists, the exceptions including Professor Flinders Petrie. Recent discoveries appear to sup
port the new chronological system. " There is a growing conviction", writes Mr. Hawes, "that Cretan evidence, especially in the eastern part of the island, favours the
minimum (Berlin) system of Egyptian chronology, according to which the Sixth (Egyptian) Dynasty began at c. 2540 B.C. and the Twelfth at c. 2000 B.C. 1 Petrie dates
the beginning of the Twelfth Dynasty at c. 3400 B.C.
To students of comparative folklore and mythology
the myths and legends of Babylonia present many features
of engrossing interest. They are of great antiquity, yet
not a few seem curiously familiar. We must not con
clude, however, that because a European legend may bear resemblances to one translated from a cuneiform
tablet it is necessarily of Babylonian origin. Certain beliefs, and the myths which were based upon them, are
older than even the civilization of the Tigro- Euphrates
valley. They belong, it would appear, to a stock of
common inheritance from an uncertain cultural centre of immense antiquity. The problem involved has been referred to by Professor Frazer in the Golden Bough.
Commenting on the similarities presented by certain
ancient festivals in various countries, he suggests that

xxx MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
they may be due to " a remarkable homogeneity of civi
lization throughout Southern Europe and Western Asia
in prehistoric times. How far", he adds, a such homogeneity of civilization may be taken as evidence of homo
geneity of race is a question for the ethnologist.*'
1
In Chapter I the reader is introduced to the ethno
logical problem, and it is shown that the results of
modern research tend to establish a remote racial connection between the Sumerians of Babylonia, the
prehistoric Egyptians, and the Neolithic (Late Stone Age) inhabitants of Europe, as well as the southern
Persians and the "Aryans" of India.
Comparative notes are provided in dealing with the customs, religious beliefs, and myths and legends of the Mesopotamia!! peoples to assist the student towards the
elucidation and partial restoration of certain literary frag
ments from the cuneiform tablets. Of special interest in this connection are the resemblances between some of
the Indian and Babylonian myths. The writer has drawn
upon that " great storehouse " of ancient legends, the voluminous Indian epic, the Mahdbhdrata, and it is shown that there are undoubted links between the Garuda
eagle myths and those of the Sumerian Zu bird and the
Etana eagle, while similar stories remain attached to the
memories of " Sargon of Akkad" and the Indian hero Kama, and of Semiramis (who was Queen Sammu-ramat
of Assyria) and Shakuntala. The Indian god Varuna and
the Sumerian Ea are also found to have much in common,
and it seems undoubted that the Manu fish and flood
myth is a direct Babylonian inheritance, like the Yuga (Ages of the Universe) doctrine and the system of cal
culation associated with it. It is of interest to note, too,
that a portion of the Gilgamesh epic survives in the
1 The Scapegoat vol., p. 409 (3rd edition).



INTRODUCTION xxxi
Rdmdyana story of the monkey god Hanuman's search
for the lost princess Sita; other relics of similar character
suggest that both the Gilgamesh and Hanuman narratives
are derived in part from a very ancient myth. Gilgamesh
also figures in Indian mythology as Yama, the first man,
who explored the way to the Paradise called " The Land
of Ancestors ", and over which he subsequently presided as a god. Other Babylonian myths link with those found
in Egypt, Greece, Scandinavia, Iceland, and the British
Isles and Ireland. The Sargon myth, for instance, re
sembles closely the myth of Scyld (Sceaf), the patriarch, in the Beowulf epic, and both appear to be variations of
the Tammuz-Adonis story. Tammuz also resembles in
one of his phases the Celtic hero Diarmid, who was slain
by the "green boar" of the Earth Mother, as was Adonis by the boar form of Ares, the Greek war god.
In approaching the study of these linking myths it would be as rash to conclude that all resemblances are
due to homogeneity of race as to assume that folklore
and mythology are devoid of ethnological elements. Due consideration must be given to the widespread influence
exercised by cultural contact. We must recognize also
that the human mind has ever shown a tendency to arrive
quite independently at similar conclusions, when confronted by similar problems, in various parts of the world. But while many remarkable resemblances may be
detected between the beliefs and myths and customs of
widely separated peoples, it cannot be overlooked that
pronounced and striking differences remain to be ac
counted for. Human experiences varied in localities because all sections of humanity were not confronted in
ancient times by the same problems in their everyday
lives. Some peoples, for instance, experienced no great difficulties regarding the food supply, which might be

provided for them by nature in lavish abundance; others
were compelled to wage a fierce and constant conflict
against hostile forces in inhospitable environments with purpose to secure adequate sustenance and their meed of
enjoyment. Various habits of life had to be adopted in
various parts of the world, and these produced various
habits of thought. Consequently, we find that behind
all systems of primitive religion lies the formative back
ground of natural phenomena. A mythology reflects the geography, the fauna and flora, and the climatic conditions
of the area in which it took definite and permanent shape.
In Babylonia, as elsewhere, we expect, therefore, to find a mythology which has strictly local characteristics
one which mirrors river and valley scenery, the habits
of life of the people, and also the various stages of pro
gress in the civilization from its earliest beginnings.
Traces of primitive thought survivals from remotest
antiquity should also remain in evidence. As a matter
of fact Babylonian mythology fulfils our expectations in
this regard to the highest degree. Herodotus said that Egypt was the gift of the Nile:
similarly Babylonia may be regarded as the gift of the
Tigris and Euphrates those great shifting and flooding rivers which for long ages had been carrying down from
the Armenian Highlands vast quantities of mud to thrust back the waters of the Persian Gulf and form a country
capable of being utilized for human habitation. The
most typical Babylonian deity was Ea, the god of the fertilizing and creative waters.
He was depicted clad in the skin of a fish, as gods in
other geographical areas were depicted wearing the skins of animals which were regarded as ancestors, or hostile
demons that had to be propitiated. Originally Ea appears to have been a fish the incarnation of the spirit of, or



INTRODUCTION xxxiii
life principle in, the Euphrates River. His centre of wor
ship was at Eridu, an ancient seaport, where apparently
the prehistoric Babylonians (the Sumerians) first began to utilize the dried -up beds of shifting streams to irrigate
the soil. One of the several creation myths is remi
niscent of those early experiences which produced early local beliefs:
O thou River, who didst create all things,
When the great gods dug thee out,
They set prosperity upon thy banks, Within thee Ea, the king of the Deep, created his dwelling.1
The Sumerians observed that the land was brought into
existence by means of the obstructing reeds, which caused
mud to accumulate. When their minds began to be
exercised regarding the origin of life, they conceived that
the first human beings were created by a similar process:
Marduk (son of Ea) laid a reed upon the face of the waters,
He formed dust and poured it out beside the reed . . .
He formed mankind.2
Ea acquired in time, as the divine artisan, various attri
butes which reflected the gradual growth of civilization:
he was reputed to have taught the people how to form
canals, control the rivers, cultivate the fields, build their
houses, and so on.
But although Ea became a beneficent deity, as a
result of the growth of civilization, he had also a de
moniac form, and had to be propitiated. The worshippers of the fish god retained ancient modes of thought and
perpetuated ancient superstitious practices.
The earliest settlers in the Tigro-Euphrates valley were
agriculturists, like their congeners, the proto-Egyptians
* The Scvtn Tablets of Creation^ 1*, W. King, p. 129. 2 //W, pp. 133-4,



xxxiv MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
and the Neolithic Europeans. Before they broke away
from the parent stock in its area of characterization they
had acquired the elements of culture, and adopted habits
of thought which were based on the agricultural mode of life. Like other agricultural communities they were wor
shippers of the " World Mother ", the Creatrix, who was
the giver of all good things, the "Preserver" and also
the "Destroyer" the goddess whose moods were reflected by natural phenomena, and whose lovers were the
spirits of the seasons.
In the alluvial valley which they rendered fit for habitation the Sumerians came into contact with peoples
of different habits of life and different habits of thought. These were the nomadic pastoralists from the northern
steppe lands, who had developed in isolation theories
regarding the origin of the Universe which reflected their
particular experiences and the natural phenomena of their
apea of characterization. The most representative people
of this class were the " Hatti" of Asia Minor, who were of Alpine or Armenoid stock. In early times the nomads were broken up into small tribal units, like Abraham and
his followers, and depended for their food supply on the prowess of the males. Their chief deity was the sky and
mountain god, who was the "World Father", the creator, and the wielder of the thunder hammer, who waged war against the demons of storm or drought, and ensured
the food supply of his worshippers.
The fusion in Babylonia of the peoples of the god
and goddess cults was in progress before the dawn of
history, as was the case in Egypt and also in southern
Europe. In consequence independent Pantheons came into existence in the various city States in the Tigro
Euphrates valley. These were mainly a reflection of city politics : the deities of each influential section had to



INTRODUCTION xxxv
receive recognition. But among the great masses of the people ancient customs associated with agriculture con
tinued in practice, and, as Babylonia depended for its
prosperity on its harvests, the force of public opinion
tended, it would appear, to perpetuate the religious beliefs of the earliest settlers, despite the efforts made by con
querors to exalt the deities they introduced.
Babylonian religion was of twofold character. It em
braced temple worship and private worship. The religion of the temple was the religion of the ruling class, and
especially of the king, who was the guardian of the people. Domestic religion was conducted in homes, in reed huts,
or in public places, and conserved the crudest superstitions
surviving from the earliest times. The great " burn
ings*' and the human sacrifices in Babylonia, referred to
in the Bible, were, no doubt, connected with agricultural religion of the private order, as was also the ceremony of baking and offering cakes to the Queen of Heaven, condemned by Jeremiah, which obtained in the streets of
Jerusalem and other cities. Domestic religion required no temples. There were no temples in Crete : the world
was the " house " of the deity, who had seasonal haunts
on hilltops, in groves, in caves, &c. In Egypt Herodotus witnessed festivals and processions which are not referred
{o in official inscriptions, although they were evidently practised from the earliest times.
Agricultural religion in Egypt was concentrated in the cult of Osiris and Isis, and influenced all local theologies,
In Babylonia these deities were represented by Tammux
and Ishtar. Ishtar, like Isis, absorbed many other local
goddesses. According to the beliefs of the ancient agriculturists
the goddess was eternal and undecaying. She was the Great Mother of the Universe and the source of the food
(0642) 3



xxxvi MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
supply. Her son, the corn god, became, as the Egyptians
put it, "Husband of his Mother ". Each year he was born anew and rapidly attained to manhood; then he
was slain by a fierce rival who symbolized the season of
pestilence-bringing and parching sun heat, or the rainy season, or wild beasts of prey. Or it might be that he
was slain by his son, as Cronos was by Zeus and Dyaus
by Indra. The new year slew the old year.
The social customs of the people, which had a religious basis, were formed in accordance with the doings of the
deities ; they sorrowed or made glad in sympathy with
the spirits of nature. Worshippers also suggested by
their ceremonies how the deities should act at various
seasons, and thus exercised, as they believed, a magical control over them.
In Babylonia the agricultural myth regarding the Mother goddess and the young god had many variations. In one form Tammuz, like Adonis, was loved by two
goddesses the twin phases of nature the Queen of Heaven and the Queen of Hades. It was decreed that
Tammuz should spend part of the year with one goddess
and part of the year with the other. Tammuz was also
a Patriarch, who reigned for a long period over the land and had human offspring. After death his spirit appeared at certain times and seasons as a planet, star, or con
stellation. He was the ghost of the elder god, and he
was also the younger god who was born each year.
In the Gilgamesh epic we appear to have a form of the patriarch legend the story of the "culture hero"
and teacher who discovered the path which led to the
land of ancestral spirits. The heroic Patriarch in Egypt
was Apuatu, " the opener of the ways ", the earliest form
of Osiris ; in India he was Yama, the first man, " who
searched and found out the path for many".



INTRODUCTION xxxvii
The King as Patriarch was regarded during life as an
incarnation of the culture god : after death he merged in
the god. c< Sargon of Akkad" posed as an incarnation
of the ancient agricultural Patriarch: he professed to be
a man of miraculous birth who was loved by the goddess
Ishtar, and was supposed to have inaugurated a New Age of the Universe.
The myth regarding the father who was superseded
by his son may account for the existence in Babylonian
city pantheons of elder and younger gods who symbolized the passive and active forces of nature.
Considering the persistent and cumulative influence
exercised by agricultural religion it is not surprising to find, as has been indicated, that most of a the Babylonian
gods had Tammuz traits, as most of the Egyptian gods had Osirian traits. Although local or imported deities
were developed and conventionalized in rival Babylonian
cities, they still retained traces of primitive conceptions. They existed in all their forms as the younger god
who displaced the elder god and became the elder god,
and as the elder god who conciliated the younger god
and made him his active agent ; and as the god who was
identified at various seasons with different heavenly bodies
and natural phenomena. Merodach, the god of Babylon,
who was exalted as chief of the National pantheon in the
Hammurabi Age, was, like Tammuz, a son, and therefore
a form of Ea, a demon slayer, a war god, a god of
fertility, a corn spirit, a Patriarch, and world ruler and
guardian, and, like Tammuz, he had solar, lunar, astral, and atmospheric attributes. The complex characters of
Merodach and Tammuz were not due solely to the
monotheistic tendency: the oldest deities were of mystical
character, they represented the "Self Power" of Naturalism as well as the spirit groups of Animism.



xxxviii MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
The theorizing priests, who speculated regarding the mysteries of life and death and the origin of all things,
had to address the people through the medium of popular
beliefs. They utilized floating myths for this purpose.
As there were in early times various centres of culture
which had rival pantheons, the adapted myths varied greatly. In the different forms in which they survive
to us they reflect, not only aspects of local beliefs, but
also grades of culture at different periods. We must not
expect, however, to find that the latest form of a myth
was the highest and most profound. The history of
Babylonian religion is divided into periods of growth and
periods of decadence. The influence of domestic religion
was invariably opposed to the new and high doctrines which emanated from the priesthood, and in times of
political upheaval tended to submerge them in the debris
of immemorial beliefs and customs. The retrogressive tendencies of the masses were invariably reinforced by
the periodic invasions of aliens who had no respect for
official deities and temple creeds.
We must avoid insisting too strongly on the application of the evolution theory to the religious phenomena
of a country like Babylonia.
The epochs in the intellectual life of an ancient people
are not comparable to geological epochs, for instance, because the forces at work were directed by human wills,
whether in the interests of progress or otherwise. The
battle of creeds has ever been a battle of minds. It
should be recognized, therefore, that the human element
bulks as prominently in the drama of Babylon's religious
history as does the prince of Denmark in the play of
Hamlet. We are not concerned with the plot alone. The
characters must also receive attention. Their aspirations
and triumphs, their prejudices and blunders, were the



INTRODUCTION xxxix
billowy forces which shaped the shoreland of the story
and made history. Various aspects of Babylonian life and culture are
dealt with throughout this volume, and it is shown that
the growth of science and art was stimulated by unwholesome and crude superstitions. Many rank weeds
flourished beside the brightest blossoms of the human
intellect that wooed the sun in that fertile valley of rivers.
As in Egypt, civilization made progress when wealth was
accumulated in sufficient abundance to permit of a leisured
class devoting time to study and research. The endowed
priests, who performed temple ceremonies, were the
teachers of the people and the patrons of culture. We
may think little of their religious beliefs, regarding which
after all we have only a superficial knowledge, for we have yet discovered little more than the fragments of the
shell which held the pearl, the faded petals that were
once a rose, but we must recognize that they provided inspiration for the artists and sculptors whose achieve
ments compel our wonder and admiration, moved states
men to inaugurate and administer humanitarian laws, and
exalted Right above Might.
These civilizations of the old world, among which the
Mesopotamia!! and the Nilotic were the earliest, were built on no unsound foundations. They made possible "the glory that was Greece and the grandeur that was
Rome", and it is only within recent years that we have
begun to realize how incalculable is the debt which the modern world owes to them.

BEFORE the dawn of the historical period Ancient Baby
lonia was divided into a number of independent city
states similar to those which existed in pre-Dynastic
Egypt. Ultimately these were grouped into loose con
federacies. The northern cities were embraced in the territory known as Akkad, and the southern in the land of Sumer, or Shumer. This division had a racial as
well as a geographical significance. The Akkadians were



2 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
"late comers" who had achieved political ascendency in
the north when the area they occupied was called Uri, or Kiuri, and Sumer was known as Kengi. They were a
people of Semitic speech with pronounced Semitic affini
ties. From the earliest times the sculptors depicted them
with abundant locks, long full beards, and the prominent
distinctive noses and full lips, which we usually associate
with the characteristic Jewish type, and also attired in
long, flounced robes, suspended from their left shoulders,
and reaching down to their ankles. In contrast, the
Sumerians had clean-shaven faces and scalps, and noses of Egyptian and Grecian rather than Semitic type, while
they wore short, pleated kilts, and went about with the upper part of their bodies quite bare like the Egyptian
noblemen of the Old Kingdom period. They spoke a non-Semitic language, and were the oldest inhabitants of
Babylonia of whom we have any knowledge. Sumerian
civilization was rooted in the agricultural mode of life,
and appears to have been well developed before the Semites became numerous and influential in the land.
Cities had been built chiefly of sun-dried and fire-baked
bricks; distinctive pottery was manufactured with much
skill; the people were governed by humanitarian laws,
which formed the nucleus of the Hammurabi code, and had in use a system of cuneiform writing which was still
in process of development from earlier pictorial characters.
The distinctive feature of their agricultural methods was
the engineering skill which was displayed in extending the cultivatable area by the construction of irrigating
canals and ditches. There are also indications that they
possessed some knowledge of navigation and traded on the Persian Gulf. According to one of their own tradi
tions Eridu, originally a seaport, was their racial cradle.
The Semitic Akkadians adopted the distinctive culture of

EARLY CIVILIZATION 3
these Sumerians after settlement, and exercised an in
fluence on its subsequent growth.
Much controversy has been waged regarding the
original home of the Sumerians and the particular racial
type which they represented. One theory connects them with the lank-haired and beardless Mongolians, and it is
asserted on the evidence afforded by early sculptural
reliefs that they were similarly oblique-eyed. As they
also spoke an agglutinative language, it is suggested that they were descended from the same parent stock as the Chinese in an ancient Parthian homeland. If, however,
the oblique eye was not the result of faulty and primitive art, it is evident that the Mongolian type, which is
invariably found to be remarkably persistent in racial blends, did not survive in the Tigris and Euphrates valleys, for in the finer and more exact sculpture work
of the later Sumerian period the eyes of the ruling classes
are found to be similar to those of the Ancient Egyptians
and southern Europeans. Other facial characteristics
suggest that a Mongolian racial connection is highly im
probable; the prominent Sumerian nose, for instance, is quite unlike the Chinese, which is diminutive. Nor
can far-reaching conclusions be drawn from the scanty
linguistic evidence at our disposal. Although the languages of the Sumerians and long-headed Chinese are
of the agglutinative variety, so are those also which are spoken by the broad-headed Turks and Magyars of Hungary, the broad-headed and long-headed, dark and
fair Finns, and the brunet and short-statured Basques
with pear-shaped faces, who are regarded as a variation of the Mediterranean race with distinctive characteristics
developed in isolation. Languages afford no sure indica
tion of racial origins or affinities.
Another theory connects the Sumerians with the



4 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
broad-headed peoples of the Western Asian plains and
plateaus, who are vaguely grouped as Ural-Altaic stock
and are represented by the present-day Turks and the dark variety of Finns. It is assumed that they migrated
southward in remote times in consequence ot tribal
pressure caused by changing climatic conditions, and
abandoned a purely pastoral for an agricultural life. The late Sumerian sculpture work again presents difficulties in
this connection, for the faces and bulging occiputs suggest rather a long-headed than a broad-headed type, and
the theory no longer obtains that new habits of life alter
skull forms which are usually associated with other dis
tinctive traits in the structure of skeletons. These broad
headed nomadic peoples of the Steppes are allied to
Tatar stock, and distinguished from the pure Mongols
by their abundance of wavy hair and beard. The fact
that the Sumerians shaved their scalps and faces is highly
suggestive in this connection. From the earliest times it
has been the habit of most peoples to emphasize their
racial characteristics so as to be able, one may suggest, to
distinguish readily a friend from a foeman. At any rate
this fact is generally recognized by ethnologists. The Basques, for instance, shave their pointed chins and sometimes grow short side whiskers to increase the dis
tinctive pear-shape which is given to their faces by their
prominent temples. In contrast, their neighbours, the Andalusians, grow chin whiskers to broaden their already
rounded chins, and to distinguish them markedly from
the Basques.
1 Another example of similar character is
afforded in Asia Minor, where the skulls of the children
of long-headed Kurds are narrowed, and those of the children of broad-headed Armenians made flatter behind
as a result of systematic pressure applied by using cradle
1 The Races of Europe, W. Z. Ripley, p. 203.



EARLY CIVILIZATION 5
boards. In this way these rival peoples accentuate their
contrasting head forms, which at times may, no doubt, show a tendency towards variation as a result of the
crossment of types. When it is found, therefore, that the Sumerians, like the Ancient Egyptians, were in the habit
of shaving, their ethnic affinities should be looked for
among a naturally glabrous rather than a heavilybearded people.
A Central Asiatic source for Sumerian culture has
also been urged of late with much circumstantial detail.
It breaks quite fresh and interesting ground. Recent scientific expeditions in Russian and Chinese Turkestan have accumulated important archaeological data which
clearly establish that vast areas of desert country were at a remote period most verdurous and fruitful, and thickly
populated by organized and apparently progressive com
munities. From these ancient centres of civilization wholesale migrations must have been impelled from time to time in consequence of the gradual encroachment of
wind -distributed sand and the increasing shortage of
water. At Anau in Russian Turkestan, where excavations were conducted by the Pumpelly expedition, abundant traces were found of an archaic and forgotten
civilization reaching back to the Late Stone Age. The
pottery is decorated with geometric designs, and resembles
somewhat other Neolithic specimens found as far apart
as Susa, the capital of ancient Elam, on the borders of
Babylonia, Boghaz Kfti in Asia Minor, the seat of Hittite
administration, round the Black Sea to the north, and at points in the southern regions of the Balkan Peninsula.
It is suggested that these various finds are scattered
evidences of early racial drifts from the Central Asian
areas which were gradually being rendered uninhabitable.
Among the Copper Age artifacts at Anau are clay votive



6 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
statuettes resembling those which were used in Sumeria
for religious purposes. These, however, cannot be held
to prove a racial connection, but they are important in so far as they afford evidence of early trade relations in a
hitherto unsuspected direction, and the long distances over which cultural influence extended before the dawn
of history. Further we cannot go. No inscriptions have yet been discovered to render articulate this mysterious
Central Asian civilization, or to suggest the original source
of early Sumerian picture writing. Nor is it possible to confirm Mr. Pumpelly's view that from the Anau district the Sumerians and Egyptians first obtained barley and
wheat, and some of their domesticated animals. If, as
Professor Elliot Smith believes, copper was first used by
the Ancient Egyptians, it may be, on the other hand, that
a knowledge of this metal reached Anau through Sumeria, and that the elements of the earlier culture were derived
from the same quarter by an indirect route. The evi
dence obtainable in Egypt is of interest in this connection. Large quantities of food have been taken from the stomachs and intestines of sun-dried bodies which have
lain in their pre-Dynastic graves for over sixty centuries.
This material has been carefully examined, and has yielded,
among other things, husks of barley and millet, and frag
ments of mammalian bones, including those, no doubt, of the domesticated sheep and goats and cattle painted
on the pottery.
1 It is therefore apparent that at an
extremely remote period a knowledge of agriculture ex
tended throughout Egypt, and we have no reason for
supposing that it was not shared by the contemporary inhabitants of Sumer.
The various theories which have been propounded regarding the outside source of Sumerian culture are
1 The Ancient Egyptians, by Elliot Smith, p. 41 ft sey.



EARLY CIVILIZATION 7
based on the assumption that it commenced abruptly and
full grown. Its rude beginnings cannot be traced on
the banks of the Tigris and Euphrates, but although no specimens of the earliest form of picture writing have been recovered from the ruins of Sumerian and Akkadian
cities, neither have any been found elsewhere. The pos
sibility remains, therefore, that early Babylonian culture
was indigenous. "A great deal of ingenuity has been displayed by many scholars ", says Professor Elliot Smith, "with the object of bringing these Sumerians from some
where else as immigrants into Sumer; but no reasons have been advanced to show that they had not been
settled at the head of the Persian Gulf for long genera
tions before they first appeared on the stage of history.
The argument that no early remains have been found
is futile, not only because such a country as Sumer is no more favourable to the preservation of such evidence than
is the Delta of the Nile, but also upon the more general
grounds that negative statements of this sort cannot be
assigned a positive evidence for an immigration." 1 This
distinguished ethnologist is frankly of opinion that the Sumerians were the congeners of the pre-Dynastic Egyp
tians of the Mediterranean or Brown race, the eastern branch of which reaches to India and the western to the
British Isles and Ireland. In the same ancient family are
included the Arabs, whose physical characteristics distinguish them from the Semites of Jewish type. Some light may be thrown on the Sumerian problem
by giving consideration to the present-day racial com
plexion of Western Asia. The importance of evidence of this character has been emphasized elsewhere. In
Egypt, for instance, Dr. C. S. Myers has ascertained that
the modern peasants have skull forms which are identical
1 The Ancient Egyptians, p. 1 40.



8 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
with those of their pre-Dynastic ancestors. Mr. Hawcs
has also demonstrated that the ancient inhabitants of
Crete are still represented on that famous island. But
even more remarkable is the fact that the distinctive racial
type which occupied the Palaeolithic caves of the Dordogne
valley in France continues to survive in their vicinity after
an interval of over twenty thousand years.
1 It is note
worthy, therefore, to find that in south-western Asia at the
present day one particular racial type predominates over
all others. Professor Ripley, who summarizes a con
siderable mass of data in this connection, refers to it as
the "Iranian", and says:
c( It includes the Persians and
Kurds, possibly the Ossetes in the Caucasus, and farther
to the east a large number of Asiatic tribes, from the
Afghans to the Hindus. These peoples are all primarily long-headed and dark brunets. They incline to slender
ness of habit, although varying in stature according to circumstances. In them we recognize at once undoubted
congeners of our Mediterranean race in Europe. The
area of their extension runs off into Africa, through the
Egyptians, who are clearly of the same race. Not only the modern peoples, but the Ancient Egyptians and the Phoenicians also have been traced to the same source.
By far the largest portion of this part of Western Asia
is inhabited by this eastern branch of the Mediterranean
race." The broad -headed type "occurs sporadically
among a few ethnic remnants in Syria and Mesopotamia".2
The exhaustive study of thousands of ancient crania in
London and Cambridge collections has shown that Medi
terranean peoples, having alien traits, the result of early admixture, were distributed between Egypt and the
Punjab.8 Where blending took place, the early type,

EARLY CIVILIZATION 9
apparently, continued to predominate ; and it appears to
be reasserting itself in our own time in Western Asia,
as elsewhere. It seems doubtful, therefore, that the
ancient Sumerians differed racially from the pre-Dynastic
inhabitants of Egypt and the Pelasgians and Iberians
of Europe. Indeed, the statuettes from Tello, the site
of the Sumerian city of Lagash, display distinctively
Mediterranean skull forms and faces. Some of the
plump figures of the later period suggest, however, " the particular alien strain" which in Egypt and elsewhere
"is always associated with a tendency to the develop
ment of fat", in contrast to "the lean and sinewy ap
pearance of most representatives of the Brown race". 1 This change may be accounted for by the presence of the Semites in northern Babylonia.
Whence, then, came these invading Semitic Akka
dians of Jewish type? It is generally agreed that they were closely associated with one of the early outpourings
of nomadic peoples from Arabia, a country which is
favourable for the production of a larger population than it is able to maintain permanently, especially when its natural resources are restricted by a succession of abnor
mally dry years. In tracing the Akkadians from Arabia, however, we are confronted at the outset with the diffi
culty that its prehistoric, and many of its present-day,
inhabitants are not of the characteristic Semitic type. On the Ancient Egyptian pottery and monuments the Arabs
are depicted as men who closely resembled the representatives of the Mediterranean race in the Nile valley
and elsewhere. They shaved neither scalps nor faces as
did the historic Sumerians and Egyptians, but grew the slight moustache and chin -tuft beard like the Libyans
on the north and the majority of the men whose bodies
1 The Ancient Egyptians^ p. 114.



io MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
have been preserved in pre-Dynastic graves in the Nile valley. "If", writes Professor Elliot Smith, "the gene
rally accepted view is true, that Arabia was the original home of the Semites, the Arab must have undergone a
profound change in his physical characters after he left his homeland and before he reached Babylonia." This
authority is of opinion that the Arabians first migrated into
Palestine and northern Syria, where they mingled with the southward - migrating Armenoid peoples from Asia
Minor. " This blend of Arabs, kinsmen of the proto
Egyptians and Armenoids, would then form the big-nosed, long-bearded Semites, so familiar not only on the ancient
Babylonian and Egyptian monuments, but also in the modern Jews/' 1 Such a view is in accord with Dr. Hugo Winckler's contention that the flow of Arabian migrations was northwards towards Syria ere it swept through Meso
potamia. It can scarcely be supposed that these invasions
of settled districts did not result in the fusion and cross
ment of racial types and the production of a sub-variety with medium skull form and marked facial characteristics.
Of special interest in this connection is the evidence
afforded by Palestine and Egypt. The former country
has ever been subject to periodic ethnic disturbances and
changes. Its racial history has a remote beginning in the Pleistocene Age. Palaeolithic flints of Chellean and other
primitive types have been found in large numbers, and a valuable collection of these is being preserved in a French
museum at Jerusalem. In a northern cave fragments of
rude pottery, belonging to an early period in the Late Stone Age, have been discovered in association with the
bones of the woolly rhinoceros. To a later period
belong the series of Gezer cave dwellings, which, according to Professor Macalister, the well-known Palestinian
1 The Ancient Egyptians, p. 136.



EARLY CIVILIZATION 11
authority, "were occupied by a non-Semitic people of low stature, with thick skulls and showing evidence of the
great muscular strength that is essential to savage life'*. 1
These people are generally supposed to be representatives of the Mediterranean race, which Sergi has found to have
been widely distributed throughout Syria and a part of
Asia Minor.2 An interesting problem, however, is raised by the fact that, in one of the caves, there are evidences
that the dead were cremated. This was not a Medi
terranean custom, nor does it appear to have prevailed
outside the Gezer area. If, however, it does not indicate that the kinsmen of the Ancient Egyptians came into
contact with the remnants of an earlier people, it may be
that the dead of a later people were burned there. The
possibility that unidentified types may have contributed
to the Semitic blend, however, remains. The Mediterraneans mingled in Northern Syria and Asia Minor
with the broad-headed Armenoid peoples who are repre
sented in Europe by the Alpine race. With them they
ultimately formed the great Hittite confederacy. These Armenoids were moving southwards at the very dawn
of Egyptian history, and nothing is known of their con
quests and settlements. Their pioneers, who were prob
ably traders, appear to have begun to enter the Delta
region before the close of the Late Stone Age.3 The
earliest outpourings of migrating Arabians may have been in progress about the same time. This early southward
drift of Armenoids might account for the presence in
southern Palestine, early in the Copper Age, of the tall
race referred to in the Bible as the Rephaim or Ana
kim, "whose power was broken only by the Hebrew

1 Joshua drove them out of Hebron,2 in the
neighbourhood of which Abraham had purchased a burial
cave from Ephron, the Hittite.3 Apparently a system
of land laws prevailed in Palestine at this early period.
It is of special interest for us to note that in Abraham's
day and afterwards, the landed proprietors in the country of the Rephaim were identified with the aliens from Asia
Minor the tall variety in the Hittite confederacy. Little doubt need remain that the Arabians during
their sojourn in Palestine and Syria met with distinctive
types, and if not with pure Armenoids, at any rate with
peoples having Armenoid traits. The consequent multi
plication of tribes, and the gradual pressure exercised by the constant stream of immigrants from Arabia and Asia Minor, must have kept this part of Western Asia in a constant state of unrest. Fresh migrations of the
surplus stock were evidently propelled towards Egypt in one direction, and the valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates
in another. The Semites of Akkad were probably the
conquerors of the more highly civilized Sumerians, who
must have previously occupied that area. It is possible that they owed their success to the possession of superior weaponso Professor Elliot Smith suggests in this con
nection that the Arabians had become familiar with the
use of copper as a result of contact with the Egyptians
in Sinai. There is no evidence, however, that the Sumerians were attacked before they had begun to make
metal weapons. It is more probable that the invading
nomads had superior military organization and considerable experience in waging war against detached tribal units. They may have also found some of the northern Sumerian city states at war with one another and taken

advantage of their unpreparedness to resist a common
enemy. The rough Dorians who overran Greece and
the fierce Goths who shattered the power of Rome were
similarly in a lower state of civilization than the peoples
whom they subdued.
The Sumerians, however, ultimately achieved an in
tellectual conquest of their conquerors. Although the leaders of invasion may have formed military aristocracies
in the cities which they occupied, it was necessary for the
great majority of the nomads to engage their activities
in new directions after settlement. The Semitic Ak
kadians, therefore, adopted Sumerian habits of life which were best suited for the needs of the country, and they consequently came under the spell of Sumerian modes of thought. This is shown by the fact that the native
speech of ancient Sumer continued long after the dawn
of history to be the language of Babylonian religion and culture, like Latin in Europe during the Middle Ages. For centuries the mingling peoples must have been bi
lingual, as are many of the inhabitants of Ireland, Wales, and the Scottish Highlands in the present age, but
ultimately the language of the Semites became the
prevailing speech in Sumer and Akkad. This change was the direct result of the conquests and the political
supremacy achieved by the northern people. A con
siderable period elapsed, however, ere this consummation was reached and Ancient Babylonia became completely
Semitized. No doubt its brilliant historical civilization
owed much of its vigour and stability to the organizing genius of the Semites, but the basis on which it was estab
lished had been laid by the ingenious and imaginative Sumer
ians who first made the desert to blossom like the rose. The culture of Sumer was a product of the Late
Stone Age, which should not be regarded as necessarily



i 4 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
an age of barbarism. During its vast periods there were
great discoveries and great inventions in various parts
of Asia, Africa, and Europe. The Neoliths made pottery
and bricks ; we know that they invented the art of
spinning, for spindle-whorls are found even in the Gezer caves to which we have referred, while in Egypt the pre
Dynastic dead were sometimes wrapped in finely woven
linen: their deftly chipped flint implements are eloquent of artistic and mechanical skill, and undoubted mathe
matical ability must be credited to the makers of smoothly polished stone hammers which are so perfectly balanced
that they revolve on a centre of gravity. In Egypt and
Babylonia the soil was tilled and its fertility increased
by irrigation. Wherever man waged a struggle with
Nature he made rapid progress, and consequently we find that the earliest great civilizations were rooted in
the little fields of the Neolithic farmers. Their mode
of life necessitated a knowledge of Nature's laws; they had to take note of the seasons and measure time. So
Egypt gave us the Calendar, and Babylonia the system
of dividing the week into seven days, and the day into twelve double hours.
The agricultural life permitted large communities to live in river valleys, and these had to be governed by
codes of laws; settled communities required peace and
order for their progress and prosperity. All great civil
izations have evolved from the habits and experiences
of settled communities. Law and religion were closely associated, and the evidence afforded by the remains of
stone circles and temples suggests that in the organization and division of labour the influence of religious teachers
was pre-eminent. Early rulers, indeed, were priestkings incarnations of the deity who owned the land and measured out the span of human life.



EARLY CIVILIZATION 15
We need not assume that Neolithic man led an idyllic
existence; his triumphs were achieved by slow and gradual steps; his legal codes were, no doubt, written in blood
and his institutions welded in the fires of adversity.
But, disciplined by laws, which fostered humanitarian
ideals, Neolithic man, especially of the Mediterranean
race, had reached a comparatively high state of civiliza
tion long ages before the earliest traces of his activities
can be obtained. When this type of mankind is portrayed in Ancient Sumeria, Ancient Egypt, and Ancient
Crete we find that the faces are refined and intellectual
and often quite modern in aspect. The skulls show that
in the Late Stone Age the human brain was fully de
veloped and that the racial types were fixed. In every
country in Europe we still find the direct descendants
of the ancient Mediterranean race, as well as the de
scendants of the less highly cultured conquerors who swept westward out of Asia at the dawn of the Bronze Age; and everywhere there are evidences of crossment of
types in varying degrees. Even the influence of Neo
lithic intellectual life still remains. The comparative
study of mythology and folk beliefs reveals that we
have inherited certain modes of thought from our remote ancestors, who were the congeners of the Ancient Sumerians and the Ancient Egyptians. In this connec
tion it is of interest, therefore, to refer to the social
ideals of the early peoples who met and mingled on the
southern plains of the Tigris and Euphrates, and especi
ally the position occupied by women, which is engaging
so much attention at the present day. It would appear that among the Semites and other
nomadic peoples woman was regarded as the helpmate
rather than the companion and equal of man. The birth of a son was hailed with joy; it was "miserable to have



16 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
a daughter ", as a Hindu sage reflected ; in various countries it was the custom to expose female children
after birth and leave them to die. A wife had no rights
other than those accorded to her by her husband, who
exercised over her the power of life and death. Sons
inherited family possessions; the daughters had no share allotted to them, and could be sold by fathers and
brothers. Among the peoples who observed " male
right ", social life was reflected in the conception of con
trolling male deities, accompanied by shadowy goddesses
who were often little else than figures of speech.
The Ancient Sumerians, on the other hand, like the Mediterranean peoples of Egypt and Crete, reverenced
and exalted motherhood in social and religious life.
Women were accorded a legal status and marriage laws
were promulgated by the State. Wives could possess
private property in their own right, as did the Babylonian
Sarah, wife of Abraham, who owned the Egyptian slave
Hagar.1 A woman received from her parents a marriage dowry, and in the event of separation from her husband she could claim its full value. Some spinsters, or wives, were accustomed to enter into business partnerships with men or members of their own sex, and could sue and be
sued in courts of law. Brothers and sisters were joint
heirs of the family estate. Daughters might possess property over which their fathers exercised no control:
they could also enter into legal agreements with their
parents in business matters, when they had attained to
years of discretion. Young women who took vows of
celibacy and lived in religious institutions could yet make
business investmbnts, as surviving records show. There
is only one instance of a Sumerian woman ascending the
throne, like Queen Hatshepsut of Egypt. Women, there
1 Genesis, xvi. 8, 9.



EARLY CIVILIZATION 17
fore, were not rigidly excluded from official life. Dungi II,
an early Sumerian king, appointed two of his daughters as rulers of conquered cities in Syria and Elam. Simi
larly Shishak, the Egyptian Pharaoh, handed over the city of Gezer, which he had subdued, to his daughter, Solomon's wife. 1 In the religious life of ancient Sumeria
the female population exercised an undoubted influence,
and in certain temples there were priestesses. The oldest
hymns give indication of the respect shown to women by making reference to mixed assemblies as "females and
males", just as present-day orators address themselves to
"ladies and gentlemen". In the later Semitic adapta
tions of these productions, it is significant to note, this conventional reference was altered to "male and female".
If influences, however, were at work to restrict the posi
tion of women they did not meet with much success, because when Hammurabi codified existing laws, the
ancient rights of women received marked recognition. There were two dialects in ancient Sumeria, and the
invocatory hymns were composed in what was known as
"the women's language". It must not be inferred, how
ever, that the ladies of Sumeria had established a speech
which differed from that used by men. The reference
would appear to be to a softer and homelier dialect, per
haps the oldest of the two, in which poetic emotion found
fullest and most beautiful expression. In these ancient
days, as in our own, the ideal of womanhood was the
poet's chief source of inspiration, and among the hymns the highest reach of poetic art was attained in the invoca
tion of Ishtar, the Babylonian Venus. The'/ollowing hymn is addressed to that deity in her Valkyrie-like
character as a goddess of war, but her more feminine traits are not obscured :

ANCIENT Babylonia was for over four thousand years the garden of Western Asia. In the days of Hezekiah and
Isaiah, when it had come under the sway of the younger
civilization of Assyria on the north, it was " a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of oil
olive and of honey".1 Herodotus found it still flourish
ing and extremely fertile. "This territory", he wrote,
" is of all that we know the best by far for producing
grain ; it is so good that it returns as much as two
hundredfold for the average, and, when it bears at its
best, it produces three hundredfold. The blades of the
wheat and barley there grow to be full four fingers broad ;

and from millet and sesame seed, how large a tree grows,
I know myself, but shall not record, being well aware that
even what has already been said relating to the crops
produced has been enough to cause disbelief in those
who have not visited Babylonia." 1 To-day great tracts
of undulating moorland, which aforetime yielded two and
three crops a year, are in summer partly barren wastes
and partly jungle and reedy swamp. Bedouins camp beside sandy heaps which were once populous and thriving cities, and here and there the shrunken remnants of
a people once great and influential eke out precarious
livings under the oppression of Turkish tax-gatherers who are scarcely less considerate than the plundering nomads
of the desert.
This historic country is bounded on the east by Persia and on the west by the Arabian desert. In shape some
what resembling a fish, it lies between the two great
rivers, the Tigris and the Euphrates, 100 miles wide at its broadest part, and narrowing to 35 miles towards the
"tail'' in the latitude of Baghdad; the "head" converges to a point above Basra, where the rivers meet and form
the Shatt-el-Arab, which pours into the Persian Gulf
after meeting the Karun and drawing away the main
volume of that double-mouthed river. The distance
from Baghdad to Basra is about 300 miles, and the area
traversed by the Shatt-el-Arab is slowly extending at the
rate of a mile every thirty years or so, as a result of the
steady accumulation of silt and mud carried down by the
Tigris and Euphrates. When Sumeria was beginning to flourish, these two% rivers had separate outlets, and Eridu,
the seat of the cult of the sea god Ea, which now lies
125 miles inland, was a seaport at the head of the Persian
Gulf. A day's journey separated the river mouths when
1 Herodotus^ i, 193.



THE LAND OF RIVERS 23
Alexander the Great broke the power of the Persian
Empire.
In the days of Babylonia's prosperity the Euphrates
was hailed as " the soul of the land " and the Tigris
as "the bestower of blessings". Skilful engineers had solved the problem of water distribution by irrigating
sun-parched areas and preventing the excessive flooding
of those districts which are now rendered impassable
swamps when the rivers overflow. A network of canals
was constructed throughout the country, which restricted
the destructive tendencies of the Tigris and Euphrates
and developed to a high degree their potentialities as
fertilizing agencies. The greatest of these canals appear to have been anciently river beds. One, which is called
Shatt en Nil to the north, and Shatt el Kar to the south,
curved eastward from Babylon, and sweeping past Nippur,
flowed like the letter S towards Larsa and then rejoined
the river. It is believed to mark the course followed in
the early Sumerian period by the Euphrates river, which has moved steadily westward many miles beyond the sites
of ancient cities that were erected on its banks. Another
important canal, the Shatt el Hai, crossed the plain from
the Tigris to its sister river, which lies lower at this point,
and does not run so fast. Where the artificial canals were
constructed on higher levels than the streams which fed
them, the water was raised by contrivances known as
" shaddufs "
; the buckets or skin bags were roped to a
weighted beam, with the aid of which they were swung up
by workmen and emptied into the canals. It is possible
that this toilsome mode of irrigation was substituted in
favourable parts by the primitive water wheels which are
used in our own day by the inhabitants of the country
who cultivate strips of land along the river banks.
In Babylonia there are two seasons the rainy and



24 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
the dry. Rain falls from November till March, and the
plain is carpeted in spring by patches of vivid green
verdure and brilliant wild flowers. Then the period of
drought ensues; the sun rapidly burns up all vegetation, and everywhere the eye is wearied by long stretches of brown and yellow desert. Occasional sandstorms darken
the heavens, sweeping over sterile wastes and piling up the shapeless mounds which mark the sites of ancient
cities. Meanwhile the rivers are increasing in volume,
being fed by the melting snows at their mountain sources
far to the north. The swift Tigris, which is 1146 miles
long, begins to rise early in March and reaches its highest level in May; before the end of June it again subsides.
More sluggish in movement, the Euphrates, which is 1780
miles long, shows signs of rising a fortnight later than the Tigris, and is in flood for a more extended period;
it does not shrink to its lowest level until early in
September. By controlling the flow of these mighty rivers, preventing disastrous floods, and storing and dis
tributing surplus water, the ancient Babylonians developed to the full the natural resources of their country, and made it what it may once again become one of the
fairest and most habitable areas in the world. Nature
conferred upon them bountiful rewards for their labour;
trade and industries flourished, and the cities increased in
splendour and strength. Then as now the heat was great during the long summer, but remarkably dry and unvary
ing, while the air was ever wonderfully transparent under
cloudless skies of vivid blue. The nights were cool and
of great beauty, whether in brilliant moonlight or when ponds and canals were jewelled by the lustrous displays of clear and numerous stars which glorified that homeland of the earliest astronomers.
Babylonia is a treeless country, and timber had to be



THE LAND OF RIVERS 25
imported from the earliest times. The date palm was
probably introduced by man, as were certainly the vine
and the fig tree, which were widely cultivated, especially in the north. Stone, suitable for building, was very
scarce, and limestone, alabaster, marble, and basalt had to be taken from northern Mesopotamia, where the
mountains also yield copper and lead and iron. Except Eridu, where ancient workers quarried sandstone from
its sea-shaped ridge, all the cities were built of brick, an
excellent clay being found in abundance. When brick walls were cemented with bitumen they were given great stability. This resinous substance is found in the north
and south. It bubbles up through crevices of rocks on
river banks and forms small ponds. Two famous springs at modern Hit, on the Euphrates, have been drawn upon
from time immemorial. "From one", writes a traveller, "flows hot water black with bitumen, while the other
discharges intermittently bitumen, or, after a rainstorm, bitumen and cold water. . . . Where rocks crop out in the plain above Hit, they are full of seams of bitumen." 1
Present-day Arabs call it " kiyara", and export it for coat
ing boats and roofs; they also use it as an antiseptic, and apply it to cure the skin diseases from which camels suffer.
Sumeria had many surplus products, including corn and figs, pottery, fine wool and woven garments, to offer
in exchange for what it most required from other coun
tries. It must, therefore, have had a brisk and flourish
ing foreign trade at an exceedingly remote period. No doubt numerous alien merchants were attracted to its
cities, and it may be that they induced or encouraged Semitic and other raiders to overthrow governments and
form military aristocracies, so that they themselves might obtain necessary concessions and achieve a degree of
J Peter's Nippur, i, p. 160.



26 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
political ascendancy. It does not follow, however, that the peasant class was greatly affected by periodic revolu
tions of this kind, which brought little more to them
than a change of rulers. The needs of the country necessitated the continuance of agricultural methods and
the rigid observance of existing land laws; indeed, these constituted the basis of Sumerian prosperity. Conquerors
have ever sought reward not merely in spoil, but also the
services of the conquered. In northern Babylonia the
invaders apparently found it necessary to conciliate and secure the continued allegiance of the tillers of the soil.
Law and religion being closely associated, they had to adapt their gods to suit the requirements of existing
social and political organizations. A deity of pastoral nomads had to receive attributes which would give him
an agricultural significance; one of rural character had to
be changed to respond to the various calls of city life.
Besides, local gods could not be ignored on account of
their popularity. As a result, imported beliefs and religious customs must have been fused and absorbed
according to their bearing on modes of life in various
localities. It is probable that the complex character of
certain deities was due to the process of adjustment to which they were subjected in new environments.
The petty kingdoms of Sumeria appear to have been
tribal in origin. Each city was presided over by a deity
who was the nominal owner of the surrounding arable
land, farms were rented or purchased from the priesthood,
and pasture was held in common. As in Egypt, where
we find, for instance, the artisan god Ptah supreme at
Memphis, the sun god Ra at Heliopolis, and the cat goddess Bast at Bubastis, the various local Sumerian and
Akkadian deities had distinctive characteristics, and simi
larly showed a tendency to absorb the attributes of their



THE LAND OF RIVERS 27
rivals. The chief deity of a state was the central figure
in a pantheon, which had its political aspect and influenced
the growth of local theology. Cities, however, did not, as a rule, bear the names of deities, which suggests that several were founded when Sumerian religion was in its
early animistic stages, and gods and goddesses were not sharply defined from the various spirit groups.
A distinctive and characteristic Sumerian god was Ea,
who was supreme at the ancient sea -deserted port of
Eridu. He is identified with the Cannes of Berosus,1
who referred to the deity as " a creature endowed with
reason, with a body like that of a fish, with feet below
like those of a man, with a fish's tail". This description
recalls the familiar figures of Egyptian gods and priests
attired in the skins of the sacred animals from whom
their powers were derived, and the fairy lore about swan
maids and men, and the seals and other animals who
could divest themselves of their " skin coverings
" and
appear in human shape. Originally Ea may have been
a sacred fish. The Indian creative gods Brahma and
Vishnu had fish forms. In Sanskrit literature Manu,
the eponymous "first man", is instructed by the fish to build a ship in which to save himself when the world
would be purged by the rising waters. Ea befriended in similar manner the Babylonian Noah, called Pir-na
pishtim, advising him to build a vessel so as to be pre
pared for the approaching Deluge. Indeed the Indian legend appears to throw light on the original Sumerian conception of Ea. It relates that when the fish was
small and in danger of being swallowed by other fish
in a stream it appealed to Manu for protection. The

28 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
sage at once lifted up the fish and placed it in a jar of
water. It gradually increased in bulk, and he transferred
it next to a tank and then to the river Ganges. In time
the fish complained to Manu that the river was too small
for it, so he carried it to the sea. For these services the
god in fish form instructed Manu regarding the approach
ing flood, and afterwards piloted his ship through the weltering waters until it rested on a mountain top.
1
If this Indian myth is of Babylonian origin, as appears
probable, it may be that the spirit of the river Euphrates,
" the soul of the land ", was identified with a migrating
fish. The growth of the fish suggests the growth of the
river rising in flood. In Celtic folk tales high tides and
valley floods are accounted for by the presence of a "great
beast " in sea, loch, or river. In a class of legends,
"specially connected with the worship of Atargatis",
wrote Professor Robertson Smith, " the divine life of
the waters resides in the sacred fish that inhabit them.
Atargatis and her son, according to a legend common to Hierapolis and Ascalon, plunged into the waters in the first case the Euphrates, in the second the sacred pool at the temple near the town and were changed
into fishes ". The idea is that "where a god dies, that
is, ceases to exist in human form, his life passes into the
waters where he is buried; and this again is merely a
theory to bring the divine water or the divine fish into
harmony with anthropomorphic ideas. The same thing was sometimes effected in another way by saying that the anthro
pomorphic deity was born from the water, as Aphrodite sprang from sea foam, or as Atargatis, in another form of
the Euphrates, legend, . . . was born of an egg which the
sacred fishes found in the Euphrates and pushed ashore." 2
As " Shar Apsi ", Ea was the " King of the Watery

Deep". The reference, however, according to Jastrow,
u is not to the salt ocean, but the sweet waters flowing
under the earth which feed the streams, and through
streams and canals irrigate the fields*'. 1 As Babylonia
was fertilized by its rivers, Ea, the fish god, was a ferti
lizing deity. In Egypt the " Mother of Mendes " is
depicted carrying a fish upon her head; she links with Isis and Hathor; her husband is Ba-neb-Tettu, a form
of Ptah, Osiris, and Ra, and as a god of fertility he is
symbolized by the ram. Another Egyptian fish deity was the god Rem, whose name signifies "to weep"; he
wept fertilizing tears, and corn was sown and reaped
amidst lamentations. He may be identical with Remi,
who was a phase of Sebek, the crocodile god, a developed
attribute of Nu, the vague primitive Egyptian deity who
symbolized the primordial deep. The connection between a fish god and a corn god is not necessarily remote when
we consider that in Babylonia and Egypt the harvest was
the gift of the rivers.
The Euphrates, indeed, was hailed as a creator of all that grew on its banks.
O thou River who didst create all things,
When the great gods dug thee out,
They set prosperity upon thy banks,
Within thee Ea, the King of the Deep, created his dwelling . * .
Thou judgest the cause of mankind!
O River, thou art mighty! O River, thou art supreme!
O River, thou art righteous! 2

leading him, as the Indian Manu led the Creator and "Preserver" in fish form, from river to water pot, water
pot to pond or canal, and then again to river and ocean,

30 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
the Babylonians became expert engineers and experienced agriculturists, the makers of bricks, the builders of cities, the framers of laws. Indeed, their civilization was a
growth of Ea worship. Ea was their instructor. Berosus
states that, as Oannes, he lived in the Persian Gulf, and
every day came ashore to instruct the inhabitants of
Eridu how to make canals, to grow crops, to work
metals, to make pottery and bricks, and to build temples; he was the artisan god Nun-ura, "god of the potter"; Kuski-banda, "god of goldsmiths", &c. the divine
patron of the arts and crafts. "Ea knoweth everything",
chanted the hymn maker. He taught the people how to
form and use alphabetic signs and instructed them in mathematics : he gave them their code of laws. Like
the Egyptian artisan god Ptah, and the linking deity
Khnumu, Ea was the " potter or moulder of gods and
man ". Ptah moulded the first man on his potter's wheel: he also moulded the sun and moon; he shaped
the universe and hammered out the copper sky. Ea
built the world " as an architect builds a house "-1 Simi
larly the Vedic Indra, who wielded a hammer like Ptah, fashioned the universe after the simple manner in which
the Aryans made their wooden dwellings.2
Like Ptah, Ea also developed from an artisan god
into a sublime Creator in the highest sense, not merely
as a producer of crops. His word became the creative
force; he named those things he desired to be, and they
came into existence. "Who but Ea creates things",
exclaimed a priestly poet. This change from artisan god
to creator (Nudimmud) may have been due to the ten
dency of earlj religious cults to attach to their chief god
the attributes of rivals exalted at other centres.

Ea, whose name is also rendered Aa, was identified
with Ya, Ya'u, or Au, the Jah of the Hebrews. "In
Ya-Daganu, 'Jah is Dagon'", writes Professor Pinches,
"we have the elements reversed, showing a wish to
identify Jah with Dagon, rather than Dagon with Jah; whilst another interesting name, Au-Aa, shows an identification of Jah with Aa, two names which have every
appearance of being etymologically connected." Jah's name "is one of the words for c god' in the Assyro
Babylonian language".1
Ea was "Enki", "lord of the world ", or "lord of
what is beneath"; Amma-ana-ki, "lord of heaven and
earth"; Sa-kalama, "ruler of the land", as well as
Engur, "god of the abyss", Naqbu, "the deep", and
Lugal-ida, "king of the river". As rain fell from "the waters above the firmament ", the god of waters was also
a sky and earth god.
The Indian Varuna was similarly a sky as well as
an ocean god before the theorizing and systematizing Brahmanic teachers relegated him to a permanent abode at the bottom of the sea. It may be that Ea-Oannes and
Varuna were of common origin.
Another Babylonian deity, named Dagan, is believed to be identical with Ea. His worship was certainly of
great antiquity. " Hammurabi ", writes Professor Pinches,
"seems to speak of the Euphrates as being 'the boundary
of Dagan *, whom he calls his creator. In later inscriptions
the form Daguna, which approaches nearer to the West
Semitic form (Dagon of the Philistines), is found in a
few personal names. 2
It is possible that the Philistine deity Dagon was a

32 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
specialized form of ancient Ea, who was either imported from Babylonia or was a sea god of more than one branch
of the Mediterranean race. The authorities are at variance
regarding the form and attributes of Dagan. Our know
ledge regarding him is derived mainly from the Bible.
He was a national rather than a city god. There are
references to a Beth-dagon 1
, "house or city of Dagon";
he had also a temple at Gaza, and Samson destroyed it
by pulling down the two middle pillars which were its
main support. 2 A third temple was situated in Ashdod.
When the captured ark of the Israelites was placed in it
the image of Dagon " fell on his face ", with the result that "the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were
cut off upon the threshold; only the stump of Dagon was
left ".8 A further reference to "the threshold of Dagon"
suggests that the god had feet like Ea-Oannes. Those
who hold that Dagon had a fish form derive his name
from the Semitic " dag = a fish ", and suggest that after
the idol fell only the fishy part (dago) was left. On the
other hand, it was argued that Dagon was a corn god, and that the resemblance between the words Dagan and
Dagon are accidental. Professor Sayce makes reference
in this connection to a crystal seal from Phoenicia in the
Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, bearing an inscription which he reads as Baal-dagon. Near the name is an ear of corn,
and other symbols, such as the winged solar disc, a gazelle, and several stars, but there is no fish. It may be, of
course, that Baal-dagon represents a fusion of deities.
As we have seen in the case of Ea-Oannes and the deities
of Mendes, a fish god may also be a corn god, a land
animal god and a god of ocean and the sky. The offer

land",1 made by the Philistines, suggests that Dagon was the fertilizing harvest god, among other things, whose usefulness had been impaired, as they believed, by the mistake committed of placing the ark of Israel in the
temple at Ashdod. The Philistines came from Crete,
and if their Dagon was imported from that island, he may
have had some connection with Poseidon, whose worship extended throughout Greece. This god of the sea, who
is somewhat like the Roman Neptune, carried a lightning
trident and caused earthquakes. He was a brother of
Zeus, the sky and atmosphere deity, and had bull and horse forms. As a horse he pursued Demeter, the earth
and corn goddess, and, like Ea, he instructed mankind, but especially in the art of training horses. In his train
were the Tritons, half men, half fishes, and the water
fairies, the Nereids. Bulls, boars, and rams were offered
to this sea god of fertility. Amphitrite was his spouse.
An obscure god Shony, the Cannes of the Scottish
Hebrides, received oblations from those who depended
for their agricultural prosperity on his gifts of fertilizing
seaweed. He is referred to in Martin's Western Isles,
and is not yet forgotten. The Eddie sea god Njord
of Noatun was the father of Frey, the harvest god.
Dagda, the Irish corn god, had for wife Boann, the
goddess of the river Boyne. Osiris and Isis of Egypt
were associated with the Nile. The connection between
agriculture and the water supply was too obvious to
escape the early symbolists, and many other proofs of this than those referred to could be given.
Ea's " faithful spouse
" was the goddess Damkina,
who was also called Nin-ki, "lady of the earth". "May
Ea make thee glad ", chanted the priests, " May Damkina, queen of the deep, illumine thee with her counten

ance; may Merodach (Marduk), the mighty overseer of
the Igigi (heavenly spirits), exalt thy head/ 1 Merodach was their son: in time he became the Bel, or "Lord", of
the Babylonian pantheon. Like the Indian Varuna, the sea god, Ea-Oannes had control over the spirits and demons of the deep. The
"ferryman" who kept watch over the river of death was
called Arad-Ea, " servant of Ea ". There are also refer
ences to sea maidens, the Babylonian mermaids, or Nereids.
We have a glimpse of sea giants, which resemble the
Indian Danavas and Daityas of ocean, in the chant:
Seven are they, seven are they, In the ocean deep seven are they, Battening in heaven seven are they, Bred in the depths of ocean. . . . Of these seven the first is the south wind, The second a dragon with mouth agape. . . .l
A 'suggestion of the Vedic Vritra and his horde of monsters.
These seven demons were also " the messengers of
Anu", who, although specialized as a sky god in more
than one pantheon, appears to have been closely associated with Ea in the earliest Sumerian period. His
name, signifying "the high one", is derived from "ana", "heaven"; he was the city god of Erech (Uruk). It is
possible that he was developed as an atmospheric god with
solar and lunar attributes. The seven demons, who were
his messengers, recall the stormy Maruts, the followers of Indra. They are referred to as
Forcing their way with baneful windstorms, Mighty destroyers, the deluge of the storm god, Stalling at the right hand of the storm god. 2

THE LAND OF RIVERS 35
When we deal with a deity in his most archaic form
it is difficult to distinguish him from a demon. Even
the beneficent Ea is associated with monsters and furies.
" Evil spirits ", according to a Babylonian chant, were
"the bitter venom of the gods". Those attached to a
deity as " attendants "
appear to represent the original animistic group from which he evolved. In each district
the character of the deity was shaped to accord with local
conditions.
At Nippur, which was situated on the vague and
shifting boundary line between Sumer and Akkad, the
chief god was Enlil, whose name is translated " lord of
mist", "lord of might", and "lord of demons" by
various authorities. He was a storm god and a war
god, and " lord of heaven and earth ", like Ea and Anu.
An atmospheric deity, he shares the attributes of the
Indian Indra, the thunder and rain god, and Vayu, the
wind god; he also resembles the Semitic Adad or Rim
man, who links with the Hittite Tarku. All these are deities of tempest and the mountains Wild Huntsmen
in the Raging Host. The name of Enlil's temple at
Nippur has been translated as " mountain house ", or
" like a mountain ", and the theory obtained for a time
that the god must therefore have been imported by a
people from the hills. But as the ideogram for "mountain" and "land" was used in the earliest times, as King
shows, with reference to foreign countries,1 it is more
probable that Enlil was exalted as a world god who had dominion over not only Sumer and Akkad, but also the
territories occupied by the rivals and enemies of the early
Babylonians. Enlil is known as the "older Bel" (lord), to dis
tinguish him from Bel Merodach of Babylon. He was
1 A History of Sumer and Akkad^ L. W. King, p. 54.



36 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
the chief figure in a triad in which he figured as earth
god, with Anu as god of the sky and Ea as god of the
deep. This classification suggests that Nippur had either
risen in political importance and dominated the cities of
Erech and Eridu, or that its priests were influential at
the court of a ruler who was the overlord of several city
states.
Associated with Bel Enlil was Beltis, later known as
" Beltu the lady ". She appears to be identical with
the other great goddesses, Ishtar, Nana, Zer-panitum,
&c.j a " Great Mother ", or consort of an early god with
whom she was equal in power and dignity. In the later systematized theology of the Babylonians we seem to trace the fragments of a primitive mythology which was vague in outline, for the deities were not
sharply defined, and existed in groups. Enneads were
formed in Egypt by placing a local god at the head of
a group of eight elder deities. The sun god Ra was the
chief figure of the earliest pantheon of this character at
Heliopolis, while at Hermopolis the leader was the lunar
god Thoth. Professor Budge is of opinion that " both the Sumerians and the early Egyptians derived their
primeval gods from some common but exceedingly ancient source ", for he finds in the Babylonian and Nile
valleys that there is a resemblance between two early
groups which " seems to be too close to be accidental". 1
The Egyptian group comprises four pairs of vague
gods and goddesses Nu and his consort Nut, Hehu and his consort Hehut, Kekui and his consort Kekuit, and Kerh
and his consort Kerhet. " Man always has fashioned ",
he says, "and probably always will fashion, his god or
gods in his own image, and he has always, having reached
a certain stage in development, given to his gods wives
1 The Gods of the Egyptians, E. Wallis Budge, vol. i, p. 290.



THE LAND OF RIVERS 37
and offspring; but the nature of the position taken by
the wives of the gods depends upon the nature of the
position of women in the households of those who write
the legends and the traditions of the gods. The gods
of the oldest company in Egypt were, the writer believes,
invented by people in whose households women held a
high position, and among whom they possessed more power than is usually the case with Oriental peoples."
1
We cannot say definitely what these various deities
represent. Nu was the spirit of the primordial deep, and Nut of the waters above the heavens, the mother of moon and sun and the stars. The others were phases of light and darkness and the forces of nature in activity
and repose.
Nu is represented in Babylonian mythology by Apsu
Rishtu, and Nut by Mummu-Tiamat or Tiawath ; the
next pair is Lachmu and Lachamu, and the third, Anshar
and Kishar. The fourth pair is missing, but the names
of Anu and Ea (as Nudimmud) are mentioned in the first tablet of the Creation series, and the name of a third
is lost. Professor Budge thinks that the Assyrian editors
substituted the ancient triad of Anu, Ea, and Enlil for
the pair which would correspond to those found in Egypt.
Originally the wives of Anu and Ea may have made up
the group of eight primitive deities. There can be little doubt but that Ea, as he survives
to us, is of later characterization than the first pair of
primitive deities who symbolized the deep. The attributes of this beneficent god reflect the progress, and the
social and moral ideals of a people well advanced in
civilization. He rewarded mankind for the services they
rendered to him; he was their leader and instructor; he achieved for them the victories over the destructive forces
1 The Gods of the Egyptians, vol. i, p. 287.



38 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
of nature. In brief, he was the dragon slayer, a dis
tinction, by the way, which was attached in later times
to his son Merodach, the Babylonian god, although Ea was still credited with the victory over the dragon's husband.
When Ea was one of the pre-Babylonian group the
triad of Bel-Enlil, Anu, and Ea he resembled the Indian
Vishnu, the Preserver, while Bel-Enlil resembled Shiva,
the Destroyer, and Anu, the father, supreme Brahma, the Creator and Father of All, the difference in exact
adjustment being due, perhaps, to Sumerian political conditions.
Ea, as we have seen, symbolized the beneficence of
the waters; their destructive force was represented by
Tiamat or Tiawath, the dragon, and Apsu, her husband,
the arch-enemy of the gods. We shall find these elder
demons figuring in the Babylonian Creation myth, which
receives treatment in a later chapter. The ancient Sumerian city of Eridu, which means "on the seashore ", was invested with great sanctity from the
earliest times, and Ea, the "great magician of the gods",
was invoked by workers of spells, the priestly magicians of historic Babylonia. Excavations have shown that
Eridu was protected by a retaining wall of sandstone, of which material many of its houses were made. In its
temple tower, built of brick, was a marble stairway, and evidences have been forthcoming that in the later Su
merian period the structure was lavishly adorned. It is
referred to in the fragments of early literature which have
survived as "the splendid house, shady as the forest ",
that " none may enter ". The mythological spell exer
cised by Eridu in later times suggests that the civilization
of Sumeria owed much to the worshippers of Ea. At
the sacred city the first man was created : there the souls

of the dead passed towards the great Deep. Its proximity
to the sea Ea was Nin-bubu, " god of the sailor " may
have brought it into contact with other peoples and other
early civilizations. Like the early Egyptians, the early Sumerians may have been in touch with Punt (Somali
land), which some regard as the cradle of the Medi
terranean race. The Egyptians obtained from that sacred
land incense-bearing trees which had magical potency. In a fragmentary Babylonian charm there is a reference to a sacred tree or bush at Eridu. Professor Sayce has
suggested that it is the Biblical " Tree of Life " in the
Garden of Eden. His translations of certain vital words,
however, is sharply questioned by Mr. R. Campbell
Thompson of the British Museum, who does not accept
the theory.
1 It may be that Ea's sacred bush or tree is
a survival of tree and water worship.
If Eridu was not the " cradle " of the Sumerian race,
it was possibly the cradle of Sumerian civilization. Here,
amidst the shifting rivers in early times, the agriculturists may have learned to control and distribute the water
supply by utilizing dried-up beds of streams to irrigate the land. Whatever successes they achieved were credited
to Ea, their instructor and patron; he was Nadimmud,
" god of everything ".

IN dealing with the city cults of Sumer and Akkad, consideration must be given to the problems involved
by the rival mythological systems. Pantheons not only varied in detail, but were presided over by different
supreme gods. One city's chief deity might be regarded as a secondary deity at another centre. Although Ea, for instance, was given first place at Eridu, and was
so pronouncedly Sumerian in character, the moon god Nannar remained supreme at Ur, while the sun god,
whose Semitic name was Shamash, presided at Larsa and
Sippar. Other deities were similarly exalted in other
states.
As has been indicated, a mythological system must
have been strongly influenced by city politics. To hold

a community in sway, it was necessary to recognize officially the various gods worshipped by different sections, so as to secure the constant allegiance of all classes to
their rulers. Alien deities were therefore associated with
local and tribal deities, those of the nomads with those
of the agriculturists, those of the unlettered folks with
those of the learned people. Reference has been made
to the introduction of strange deities by conquerors.
But these were not always imposed upon a community by violent means. Indications are not awanting that the worshippers of alien gods were sometimes welcomed and
encouraged to settle in certain states. When they came
as military allies to assist a city folk against a fierce
enemy, they were naturally much admired and praised,
honoured by the women and the bards, and rewarded
by the rulers.
In the epic of Gilgamesh, the Babylonian Hercules,
we meet with Ea-bani, a Goliath of the wilds, who is
entreated to come to the aid of the besieged city of
Erech when it seemed that its deities were unable to help
the people against their enemies.
The gods of walled-round Erech
To flies had turned and buzzed in the streets; The winged bulls of walled-round Erech
Were turned to mice and departed through the holes.
Ea-bani was attracted to Erech by the gift of a fair
woman for wife. The poet who lauded him no doubt
mirrored public opinion. We can see the slim, shaven Sumerians gazing with wonder and admiration on their
rough heroic ally.
All his body was covered with hair, His locks were like a woman's, Thick as corn grew his abundant hair.



42 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
He was a stranger to the people and in that land.
Clad in a garment like Gira, the god,
He had eaten grass with the gazelles, He had drunk water with savage beasts.
His delight was to be among water dwellers.
Like the giant Alban, the eponymous ancestor of a
people who invaded prehistoric Britain, Ea-bani appears
to have represented in Babylonian folk legends a certain
type of foreign settlers in the land. No doubt the city
dwellers, who were impressed by the prowess of the hairy
and powerful warriors, were also ready to acknowledge the greatness of their war gods, and to admit them into
the pantheon. The fusion of beliefs which followed
must have stimulated thought and been productive of
speculative ideas. " Nowhere ", remarks Professor Jastrow,
" does a high form of culture arise without the com
mingling of diverse ethnic elements/'
4 We must also take into account the influence exercised
by leaders of thought like En-we-dur-an-ki, the famous
high priest of Sippar, whose piety did much to increase
the reputation of the cult of Shamesh, the sun god. The
teachings and example of Buddha, for instance, revolutionized Brahmanic religion in India.
A mythology was an attempt to solve the riddle of the
Universe, and to adjust the relations of mankind with
the various forces represented by the deities. The priests
systematized existing folk beliefs and established an
official religion. To secure the prosperity of the State, it was considered necessary to render homage unto
whom homage was due at various seasons and under
various circumstances.
The religious attitude of a particular community, therefore, must have been largely dependent on its needs and experiences. The food supply was a first consideration.



RIVAL PANTHEONS 43
At Eridu, as we have seen, it was assured by devotion
to Ea and obedience to his commands as an instructor.
Elsewhere it might happen, however, that Ea's gifts were restricted or withheld by an obstructing force the raging
storm god, or the parching, pestilence-bringing deity of the sun. It was necessary, therefore, for the people to
win the favour of the god or goddess who seemed most
powerful, and was accordingly considered to be the
greatest in a particular district. A rain god presided over the destinies of one community, and a god of disease and death over another; a third exalted the war god, no doubt because raids were frequent and the city owed its
strength and prosperity to its battles and conquests. The
reputation won by a particular god throughout Babylonia would depend greatly on the achievements of his
worshippers and the progress of the city civilization over which he presided. Bel-Enlil's fame as a war deity
was probably due to the political supremacy of his city of Nippur; and there was probably good reason for
attributing to the sun god a pronounced administrative and legal character; he may have controlled the
destinies of exceedingly well organized communities in which law and order and authority were held in high esteem.
In accounting for the rise of distinctive and rival
city deities, we should also consider the influence of
divergent conceptions regarding the origin of life in mingled communities. Each foreign element in a com
munity had its own intellectual life and immemorial tribal
traditions, which reflected ancient habits of life and per
petuated the doctrines of eponymous ancestors. Among
the agricultural classes, the folk religion which entered so intimately into their customs and labours must have
remained essentially Babylonish in character. In cities,
(0042) 6



44 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
however, where official religions were formulated, foreign ideas were more apt to be imposed, especially when embraced by influential teachers. It is not surprising,
therefore, to find that in Babylonia, as in Egypt, there
were differences of opinion regarding the origin of life
and the particular natural element which represented the
vital principle. One section of the people, who were represented by
the worshippers of Ea, appear to have believed that the
essence of life was contained in water. The god of
Eridu was the source of the " water of life ". He fer
tilized parched and sunburnt wastes through rivers and
irrigating canals, and conferred upon man the sustaining
" food of life ". When life came to an end
Food of death will be offered thee . . . Water of death will be offered thee . . .
Offerings of water and food were made to the dead
so that the ghosts might be nourished and prevented from
troubling the living. Even the gods required water and food ; they were immortal because they had drunk
ambrosia and eaten from the plant of life. When the
goddess Ishtar was in the Underworld, the land of the
dead, the servant of Ea exclaimed
" Hail ! lady, may the well give me of its waters, so that I may drink."
The goddess of the dead commanded her servant to
" sprinkle the lady Ishtar with the water of life and bid
her depart". The sacred water might also be found at
a confluence of rivers. Ea bade his son, Merodach, to
" draw water from the mouth of two streams ", and u on
this water to put his pure spell ".
The worship of rivers and wells which prevailed in



RIVAL PANTHEONS 45
many countries was connected with the belief that the
principle of life was in moisture. In India, water was
vitalized by the intoxicating juice of the Soma plant, which inspired priests to utter prophecies and filled their
hearts with religious fervour. Drinking customs had
originally a religious significance. It was believed in India that the sap of plants was influenced by the moon,
the source of vitalizing moisture and the hiding-place of the mead of the gods. The Teutonic gods also drank
this mead, and poets were inspired by it. Similar beliefs
obtained among various peoples. Moon and water wor
ship were therefore closely associated; the blood of animals
and the sap of plants were vitalized by the water of life and under control of the moon. The body moisture of gods and demons had vitalizing
properties. When the Indian creator, Prajapati, wept at
the beginning, " that (the tears) which fell into the water
became the air. That which he wiped away, upwards,
became the sky/' 1 The ancient Egyptians believed that
all men were born from the eyes of Horus except negroes,
who came from other parts of his body.2 The creative
tears of Ra, the sun god, fell as shining rays upon the
earth. When this god grew old saliva dripped from his
mouth, and Isis mixed the vitalizing moisture with dust, and thus made the serpent which bit and paralysed the
great solar deity.3 Other Egyptian deities,, including Osiris and Isis, wept creative tears. Those which fell from the eyes of the evil
gods produced poisonous plants and various baneful animals. Orion, the Greek giant, sprang from the body
moisture of deities. The weeping ceremonies in connec

tion with agricultural rites were no doubt believed to be
of magical potency; they encouraged the god to weep creative tears.
Ea, the god of the deep, was also "lord of life" (Enti),
" king of the river "
(Lugal-ida), and god of creation (Nudimmud). His aid was invoked by means or magical
formulae. As the "great magician of the gods " he uttered charms himself, and was the patron of all
magicians. One spell runs as follows:
I am the sorcerer priest of Ea . . .
To revive the . . . sick man The great lord Ea hath sent me;
He hath added his pure spell to mine,
He hath added his pure voice to mine,
He hath added his pure spittle to mine. R. C. Thompson's Translation.
Saliva, like tears, had creative and therefore curative
qualities; it also expelled and injured demons and brought good luck. Spitting ceremonies are referred to in the
religious literature of Ancient Egypt. When the Eye
of Ra was blinded by Set, Thoth spat in it to restore
vision. The sun god Turn, who was linked with Ra
as Ra-Tum, spat on the ground, and his saliva became the gods Shu and Tefnut. In the Underworld the devil
serpent Apep was spat upon to curse it, as was also its waxen image which the priests fashioned.1
Several African tribes spit to make compacts, declare
friendship, and to curse. Park, the explorer, refers in his Travels to his carriers
spitting on a flat stone to ensure a good journey.
Arabian holy men and descendants of Mohammed spit

and Plutarch testify to the ancient Grecian customs of
spitting to cure and to curse, and also to bless when
children were named. Pliny has expressed belief in the
efficacy of the fasting spittle for curing disease, and referred to the custom of spitting to avert witchcraft. In
England, Scotland, and Ireland spitting customs are not yet obsolete. North of England boys used to talk of
" spitting their sauls "
(souls). When the Newcastle
colliers held their earliest strikes they made compacts by
spitting on a stone. There are still " spitting stones "
in the north of Scotland. When bargains are made in
rural districts, hands are spat upon before they are shaken.
The first money taken each day by fishwives and other
dealers is spat upon to ensure increased drawings. Brand,
who refers to various spitting customs, quotes Scofs Dis
covery of Witchcraft regarding the saliva cure for king's evil, which is still, by the way, practised in the Hebrides. Like Pliny, Scot recommended ceremonial spitting as a
charm against witchcraft.1 In China spitting to expel
demons is a common practice. We still call a hasty
person a " spitfire ", and a calumniator a " spit-poison ".
The life principle in trees, &c., as we have seen, was believed to have been derived from the tears of
deities. In India sap was called the " blood of trees ",
and references to "bleeding trees" are still widespread and common. "Among the ancients", wrote Professor
Robertson Smith, " blood is generally conceived as the
principle or vehicle of life, and so the account often given
of sacred waters is that the blood of the deity flows in them. Thus as Milton writes:
Smooth Adonis from his native rock
Ran purple to the sea, supposed with blood

48 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
The ruddy colour which the swollen river derived from
the soil at a certain season was ascribed to the blood of the god, who received his death wound in Lebanon
at that time of the year, and lay buried beside the sacred
source/' 1
In Babylonia the river was regarded as the source
of the life blood and the seat of the soul. No doubt
this theory was based on the fact that the human liver
contains about a sixth of the blood in the body, the largest
proportion required by any single organ. Jeremiah makes
"Mother Jerusalem " exclaim: "My liver is poured upon
the earth for the destruction of the daughter of my
people ", meaning that her life is spent with grief. Inspiration was derived by drinking blood as well as
by drinking intoxicating liquors the mead of the gods.
Indian magicians who drink the blood of the goat sacri
ficed to the goddess Kali, are believed to be temporarily
possessed by her spirit, and thus enabled to prophesy.2 Malayan exorcists still expel demons while they suck the
blood from a decapitated fowl. 3 Similar customs were prevalent in Ancient Greece.
A woman who drank the blood of a sacrificed lamb or
bull uttered prophetic sayings.
4
But while most Babylonians appear to have believed
that the life principle was in blood, some were apparently
of opinion that it was in breath the air of life. A man
died when he ceased to breathe; his spirit, therefore, it was argued, was identical with the atmosphere the
moving wind and was accordingly derived from the
atmospheric or wind god. When, in the Gilgamesh epic, the hero invokes the dead Ea-bani, the ghost rises

All that is evil in their hosts, like a whirlwind, Hath come forth from the grave. 1

in his character as an atmospheric deity The ascendancy of storm and wind gods in some Babylonian cities may have been due to the belief that they were the source
of the "air of life". It is possible that this conception
was popularized by the Semites. Inspiration was perhaps derived from these deities by burning incense, which, if
we follow evidence obtained elsewhere, induced a pro
phetic trance. The gods were also invoked by incense.
In the Flood legend the Babylonian Noah burned incense.
" The gods smelled a sweet savour and gathered like flies
over the sacrificer." In Egypt devotees who inhaled the
breath of the Apis bull were enabled to prophesy.
In addition to water and atmospheric deities Babylonia
had also its fire gods, Girru, Gish Bar, Gibil, and Nusku. Their origin is obscure. It is doubtful if their wor
shippers, like those of the Indian Agni, believed that
fire, the "vital spark", was the principle of life which
was manifested by bodily heat. The Aryan fire wor
shippers cremated their dead so that the spirits might be

transferred by fire to Paradise. This practice, however,
did not obtain among the fire worshippers of Persia, nor,
as was once believed, in Sumer or Akkad either. Fire
was, however, used in Babylonia for magical purposes. It destroyed demons, and put to flight the spirits of disease. Possibly the fire -purification ceremonies resembled those which were practised by the Canaanites,
and are referred to in the Bible* Ahaz "made his son
to pass through the fire, according to the abominations
of the heathen 'V Ezekiel declared that "when ye offer
your gifts, when ye make your sons to pass through the
fire, ye pollute yourselves with all your idols ",2 In
Leviticus it is laid down: "Thou shalt not let any of thy
seed pass through the fire to Moloch ", 3 It may be that
in Babylonia the fire-cleansing ceremony resembled that which obtained at Beltane (May Day) in Scotland,
Germany, and other countries. Human sacrifices might
also have been offered up as burnt offerings. Abraham,
who came from the Sumerian city of Ur, was prepared
to sacrifice Isaac, Sarah's first-born. The fire gods of
Babylonia never achieved the ascendancy of the Indian
Agni; they appear to have resembled him mainly in so far as he was connected with the sun. Nusku, like
Agni, was also the " messenger of the gods ". When Merodach or Babylon was exalted as chief god of the
pantheon his messages were carried to Ea by Nusku.
He may have therefore symbolized the sun rays, for
Merodach had solar attributes. It is possible that the
belief obtained among even the water worshippers of Eridu that the sun and moon, which rose from the
primordial deep, had their origin in the everlasting fire in Ea's domain at the bottom of the sea. In the Indian
god Varuna's ocean home an " Asura fire " (demon fire)

burned constantly; it was "bound and confined ", but
could not be extinguished. Fed by water, this fire, it was believed, would burst forth at the last day and con
sume the universe.1 A similar belief can be traced in
Teutonic mythology. The Babylonian incantation cult
appealed to many gods, but " the most important share
in the rites", says Jastrow, "are taken by fire and water
suggesting, therefore, that the god ot water more
particularly Ea and the god of fire . . . are the chief
deities on which the ritual itself hinges". In some
temples there was a bit rimki, a "house of washing", and a bit nun, a "house of light".
2
It is possible, of course, that fire was regarded as the vital principle by some city cults, which were influenced
by imported ideas. If so, the belief never became preva
lent. The most enduring influence in Babylonian religion was the early Sumerian ; and as Sumerian modes of
thought were the outcome of habits of life necessitated
by the character of the country, they were bound, sooner
or later, to leave a deep impress on the minds of foreign
peoples who settled in the Garden of Western Asia. It
is not surprising, therefore, to find that imported deities assumed Babylonian characteristics, and were identified or
associated with Babylonian gods in the later imperial
pantheon.
Moon worship appears to have been as ancient as
water worship, with which, as we have seen, it was closely
associated. It was widely prevalent throughout Baby
lonia. The chief seat of the lunar deity, Nannar or Sin,
was the ancient city of Ur, from which Abraham migrated
to Harran, where the " Baal "
(the lord) was also a moon
god. Ur was situated in Sumer, in the south, between

the west bank of the Euphrates and the low hills border
ing the Arabian desert, and not far distant from sea
washed Eridu. No doubt, like that city, it had its origin
at an exceedingly remote period. At any rate, the excavations conducted there have afforded proof that it
flourished in the prehistoric period.
As in Arabia,, Egypt, and throughout ancient Europe
and elsewhere3 the moon god of Sumeria was regarded
as the " friend of man ". He controlled nature as a
fertilizing agency; he caused grass, trees5 and crops to
grow; he increased flocks and herds, and gave human
offspring. At Ur he was exalted above Ea as " the lord
and prince of the gods, supreme in heaven, the Father of
all"; he was also called "great Anu 39
5 an indication that
Anu, the sky god, had at one time a lunar character. The
moon god was believed to be the father of the sun god:
he was the "great steer with mighty horns and perfect limbs".
His name Sin is believed to be a corruption of
" Zu-ena ", which signifies " knowledge lord'V Like the
lunar Osiris of Egypt, he was apparently an instructor of
mankind; the moon measured time and controlled the
seasons; seeds were sown at a certain phase of the moon,
and crops were ripened by the harvest moon. The moun
tains of Sinai and the desert of Sin are called after this
deity. As Nannar, which Jastrow considers to be a variation
of "Narnar", the "light producer", the moon god scattered darkness and reduced the terrors of night. His
spirit inhabited the lunar stone, so that moon and stone
worship were closely associated; it also entered trees and
crops, so that moon worship linked with earth worship, as both linked with water worship.

The consort of Nannar was Nin-Uruwa, "the lady
of Ur ", who was also called Nin-gala. She links with
Ishtar as Nin, as Isis of Egypt linked with other mother
deities. The twin children of the moon were Mashu and
Mashtu, a brother and sister, like the lunar girl and boy
of Teutonic mythology immortalized in nursery rhymes
as Jack and Jill.
Sun worship was of great antiquity in Babylonia, but
appears to have been seasonal in its earliest phases. No
doubt the sky god Anu had his solar as well as his lunar
attributes, which he shared with Ea. The spring sun was
personified as Tammuz, the youthful shepherd, who was loved by the earth goddess Ishtar and her rival Eresh
ki-gal, goddess of death, the Babylonian Persephone.
During the winter Tammuz dwelt in Hades, and at the
beginning of spring Ishtar descended to search for him
among the shades.1 But the burning summer sun was
symbolized as a destroyer, a slayer of men, and therefore a war god. As Ninip or Nirig, the son of Enlil, who was made in the likeness of Anu, he waged war against the
earth spirits, and was furiously hostile towards the deities
of alien peoples, as befitted a god of battle. Even his
father feared him, and when he was advancing towards
Nippur, sent out Nusku, messenger of the gods, to soothe
the raging deity with soft words. Ninip was symbolized as a wild bull, was connected with stone worship, like the
Indian destroying god Shiva, and was similarly a deity
of Fate. He had much in common with Nin-Girsu, a
god of Lagash, who was in turn regarded as a form of
Tammuz.
Nergalj another solar deity, brought disease and pestilence, and, according to Jensen, all misfortunes due to
excessive heat. He was the king of death, husband of
1 In early times two goddesses searched for Tammuz at different periods.



54 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
Eresh-ki-gal, queen of Hades. As a war god he thirsted
for human blood, and was depicted as a mighty lion.
He was the chief deity of the city of Cuthah, which, Jastrow suggests, was situated beside a burial place of
great repute, like the Egyptian Abydos.
The two great cities of the sun in ancient Babylonia were the Akkadian Sippar and the Sumerian Larsa. In these the sun god, Shamash or Babbar, was the patron
deity. He was a god of Destiny, the lord of the living and the dead, and was exalted as the great Judge, the
lawgiver, who upheld justice ; he was the enemy of
wrong, he loved righteousness and hated sin, he inspired his worshippers with rectitude and punished evildoers.
The sun god also illumined the world, and his rays
penetrated every quarter: he saw all things, and read the thoughts of men; nothing could be concealed from
Shamash. One of his names was Mitra, like the god
who was linked with Varuna in the Indian Rigveda. These twin deities, Mitra and Varuna, measured out the span of human life. They were the source of all
heavenly gifts : they regulated sun and moon, the winds and waters, and the seasons. 1
These did the gods establish in royal power over themselves, because they were wise and the children of wisdom, and because
they excelled in power. Prof. Arnold's trans, of Rigvedic Hymn.
Mitra and Varuna were protectors of hearth and home,
and they chastised sinners. " In a striking passage of
the MalMhdrata" says Professor Moulton, "one in which Indian thought comes nearest to the conception of
conscience, a kingly wrongdoer is reminded that the sun
sees secret sin." 2
In Persian mythology Mitra, as Mithra, is the patron
1 Indian Myth and Legend, p. 30. 2 Early Religious Poetry of Persia, p. 35.



RIVAL PANTHEONS 55
of Truth, and "the Mediator " between heaven and earth.1
This god was also worshipped by the military aristocracy of Mitanni, which held sway for a period over Assyria.
In Roman times the worship of Mithra spread into
Europe from Persia. Mithraic sculptures depict the deity as a corn god slaying the harvest bull; on one of the monuments "cornstalks instead of blood are seen
issuing from the wound inflicted with the knife ". 2 The
Assyrian word "metru" signifies rain. 1 As a sky god Mitra may have been associated, like Varuna, with the
waters above the firmament. Rain would therefore be
gifted by him as a fertilizing deity. In the Babylonian
Flood legend it is the sun god Shamash who " appointed the time" when the heavens were to "rain destruction"
in the night, and commanded Pir-napishtim, " Enter into
the midst of thy ship and shut thy door". The solar
deity thus appears as a form of Anu, god of the sky and
upper atmosphere, who controls the seasons and the various
forces of nature. Other rival chiefs of city pantheons,
whether lunar, atmospheric, earth, or water deities, were
similarly regarded as the supreme deities who ruled the
Universe, and decreed when man should receive benefits
or suffer from their acts of vengeance.
It is possible that the close resemblances between
Mithra and Mitra of the Aryan -speaking peoples of India and the Iranian plateau, and the sun god of the
Babylonians the Semitic Shamash, the Sumerian Utu were due to early contact and cultural influence through
the medium of Elam. As a solar and corn god, the Persian Mithra links with Tammuz, as a sky and atmos
pheric deity with Anu, and as a god of truth, righteous
ness,, and law with Shamash. We seem to trace in the

dissipate. Thou knowest their transgressions, the plan of the wicked thou

The worshippers of Varuna and Mitra in the Punjab
did not cremate their dead like those who exalted the
rival fire god Agni. The grave was the " house of clay ",
as in Babylonia. Mitra, who was identical with Yama,
ruled over departed souls in the " Land of the Pitris " (Fathers), which was reached by crossing the mountains
and the rushing stream of death.4 As we have seen, the
Babylonian solar god Nergal was also the lord of the dead.

over the heavens by day and through the underworld of
darkness and death during the night. The consort of Shamash was Aa, and his attendants were Kittu and
Mesharu, " Truth " and "Righteousness". Like the Hittites, the Babylonians had also a sun
goddess: her name was Nin-sun, which Jastrow renders
"the annihilating lady". At Erech she had a shrine in
the temple of the sky god Anu.
We can trace in Babylonia, as in Egypt, the early belief that life in the Universe had a female origin. Ninsun links with Ishtar, whose Sumerian name is Nana.
Ishtar appears to be identical with the Egyptian Hathor,
who, as Sekhet, slaughtered the enemies of the sun god
Ra. She was similarly the goddess of maternity, and is depicted in this character, like I sis and other goddesses
of similar character, suckling a babe. Another Babylonian
lady of the gods was Ama, Mama, or Mami, " the creatress
of the seed of mankind ", and was " probably so called
as the c mother' of all things".
1
A characteristic atmospheric deity was Ramman, the
Rimmon of the Bible, the Semitic Addu, Adad, Hadad,
or Dadu. He was not a presiding deity in any pantheon, but was identified with Enlil at Nippur. As a
hammer god, he was imported by the Semites from the
hills. He was a wind and thunder deity, a rain bringer,
a corn god, and a god of battle like Thor, Jupiter, Tarku,
Indra, and others, who were all sons of the sky. In this brief review of the representative deities of
early Babylonia, it will be seen that most gods link with
Anu, Ea, and Enlil, whose attributes they symbolized
in various forms. The prominence accorded to an in
dividual deity depended on local conditions, experiences, and influences. Ceremonial practices no doubt varied
1 The Religion of Babylonia and Assyria^ T. G. Pinches, p. 94.



58 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
here and there, but although one section might exalt Ea
and another Shamash, the religious faith of the people as
a whole did not differ to any marked extent; they served
the gods according to their lights, so that life might be
prolonged and made prosperous, for the land of death
and " no return " was regarded as a place of gloom and
misery.
When the Babylonians appear before us in the early stages of the historical period they had reached that stage
of development set forth so vividly in the Orations of
Isocrates: "Those of the gods who are the source to us
of good things have the title of Olympians; those whose
department is that of calamities and punishments have
harsher titles: to the first class both private persons and
states erect altars and temples; the second is not wor
shipped either with prayers or burnt sacrifices, but in their case we perform ceremonies of riddance".1
The Sumerians, like the Ancient Egyptians, developed their deities, who reflected the growth of culture, from
vague spirit groups, which, like ghosts, were hostile to
mankind. Those spirits who could be propitiated were
exalted as benevolent deities ; those who could not be
bargained with were regarded as evil gods and goddesses.
A better understanding of the character of Babylonian deities will therefore be obtained by passing the demons and evil spirits under review.

60 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like
unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man's device." 1
Babylonian temples were houses of the gods in the literal sense; the gods were supposed to dwell in them,
their spirits having entered into the graven images or blocks of stone. It is probable that like the Ancient
Egyptians they believed a god had as many spirits as
he had attributes. The gods, as we have said, appear
to have evolved from early spirit groups. All the world swarmed with spirits, which inhabited stones and trees,
mountains and deserts, rivers and ocean, the air, the
sky, the stars, and the sun and moon. The spirits con
trolled Nature: they brought light and darkness, sun
shine and storm, summer and winter; they were mani
fested in the thunderstorm, the sandstorm, the glare of sunset, and the wraiths of mist rising from the steaming
marshes. They controlled also the lives of men and
women. The good spirits were the source of luck. The
bad spirits caused misfortunes, and were ever seeking
to work evil against the Babylonian. Darkness was
peopled by demons and ghosts of the dead. The spirits of disease were ever lying in wait to clutch him with
cruel invisible hands.
Some modern writers, who are too prone to regard
ancient peoples from a twentieth-century point of view,
express grave doubts as to whether " intelligent Baby
lonians "
really believed that spirits came down in the
rain and entered the soil to rise up before men's eyes
as stalks of barley or wheat. There is no reason for sup
posing that they thought otherwise. The early folks based their theories on the accumulated knowledge of
their age. They knew nothing regarding the com

DEMONS, FAIRIES, AND GHOSTS 61
position of water or the atmosphere, of the cause of
thunder and lightning, or of the chemical changes effected
in soils by the action of bacteria. They attributed all
natural phenomena to the operations of spirits or gods. In believing that certain demons caused certain diseases,
they may be said to have achieved distinct progress, for
they anticipated the germ theory. They made discoveries, too, which have been approved and elaborated
in later times when they lit sacred fires, bathed in sacred
waters, and used oils and herbs to charm away spirits of
pestilence. Indeed, many folk cures, which were originally associated with magical ceremonies, are still prac
tised in our own day. They were found to be effective
by early observers, although they were unable to explain
why and how cures were accomplished, like modern
scientific investigators.
In peopling the Universe with spirits, the Babylonians, like other ancient folks, betrayed that tendency to sym
bolize everything which has ever appealed to the human
mind. Our painters and poets and sculptors are greatest when they symbolize their ideals and ideas and impres
sions, and by so doing make us respond to their moods.
Their " beauty and their terror are sublime ". But what
may seem poetic to us, was invariably a grim reality to
the Babylonians. The statue or picture was not merely a work of art but a manifestation of the god or demon.
As has been said, they believed that the spirit of the god inhabited the idol; the frown of the brazen image was the
frown of the wicked demon. They entertained as much dread of the winged and human-headed bulls guarding the entrance to the royal palace as do some of the Arab
workmen who, in our own day, assist excavators to rescue
them from sandy mounds in which they have been hidden
for long centuries.



62 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
When an idol was carried away from a city by an invading army, it was believed that the god himself had
been taken prisoner, and was therefore unable any longer
to help his people. In the early stages of Sumerian culture, the gods and
goddesses who formed groups were indistinguishable from
demons. They were vaguely define'd, and had changing
shapes. When attempts were made to depict them they
were represented in many varying forms. Some were
winged bulls or lions with human heads; others had even
more remarkable composite forms. The " dragon of
Babylon ", for instance, which was portrayed on walls
of temples, had a serpent's head, a body covered with
scales, the fore legs of a lion, hind legs of an eagle, and
a long wriggling serpentine tail. Ea had several monster
forms. The following description of one of these is
repulsive enough:
The head is the head of a serpent,
From his nostrils mucus trickles, His mouth is beslavered with water;
The ears are like those of a basilisk, His horns are twisted into three curls, He wears a veil in his head band,
The body is a siih-fish full of stars,
The base of his feet are claws, The sole of his foot has no heel,
His name is Sassu-wunnu,
A sea monster, a form of Ea. R. C. Thompson's Translation. 1
Even after the gods were given beneficent attributes
to reflect the growth of culture, and were humanized, they still retained many of their savage characteristics.
Bel Enlil and his fierce son, Nergal, were destroyers

of mankind; the storm god desolated the land; the sky
god deluged it with rain; the sea raged furiously, ever
hungering for human victims; the burning sun struck down its victims; and the floods played havoc with the
dykes and houses of human beings. In Egypt the sun
god Ra was similarly a " producer of calamity ", the com
posite monster god Sokar was "the lord of fear". 1 Osiris
in prehistoric times had been "a dangerous god", and some of the Pharaohs sought protection against him in
the charms inscribed in their tombs. 2 The Indian Shiva,
"the Destroyer", in the old religious poems has also
primitive attributes of like character.
The Sumerian gods never lost their connection with
the early spirit groups. These continued to be repre
sented by their attendants, who executed a deity's stern
and vengeful decrees. In one of the Babylonian charms
the demons are referred to as u the spleen of the gods
"
the symbols of their wrathful emotions and vengeful
desires. Bel Enlil, the air and earth god, was served
by the demons of disease, " the beloved sons of Bel ", which issued from the Underworld to attack mankind.
Nergal, the sulky and ill-tempered lord of death and destruction, who never lost his demoniac character, swept
over the land, followed by the spirits of pestilence, sun
stroke, weariness, and destruction. Anu, the sky god,
had " spawned " at creation the demons of cold and rain
and darkness. Even Ea and his consort, Damkina, were
served by groups of devils and giants, which preyed upon
mankind in bleak and desolate places when night fell. In
the ocean home of Ea were bred the " seven evil spirits
"
of tempest the gaping dragon, the leopard which preyed upon children, the great Beast, the terrible serpent, &c.

In Indian mythology Indra was similarly followed by
the stormy Maruts, and fierce Rudra by the tempestuous
Rudras. In Teutonic mythology Odin is the u Wild
Huntsman in the Raging Host ". In Greek mythology the ocean furies attend upon fickle Poseidon. Other
examples of this kind could be multiplied. As we have seen (Chapter II) the earliest group of
Babylonian deities consisted probably of four pairs of
gods and goddesses as in Egypt. The first pair was
Apsu-Rishtu and Tiamat, who personified the primordial
deep. Now the elder deities in most mythologies the
"grandsires" and "grandmothers" and "fathers" and
" mothers " are ever the most powerful and most
vengeful. They appear to represent primitive u layers
"
of savage thought. The Greek Cronos devours even
his own children, and, as the late Andrew Lang has
shown, there are many parallels to this myth among
primitive peoples in various parts of the world. Lang regarded the Greek survival as an example of
"the conservatism of the religious instinct". 1 The grand
mother of the Teutonic deity Tyr was a fierce giantess with nine hundred heads ; his father was an enemy of the gods. In Scotland the hag-mother of winter and
storm and darkness is the enemy of growth and all life,
and she raises storms to stop the grass growing, to slay young animals, and prevent the union of her son with
his fair bride. Similarly the Babylonian chaos spirits, Apsu and Tiamat, the father and mother of the gods,
resolve to destroy their offspring, because they begin to set the Universe in order. Tiamat, the female dragon,
is more powerful than her husband Apsu, who is slain
by his son Ea. She summons to her aid the gods of
evil, and creates also a brood of monsters serpents,

dragons, vipers, fish men, raging hounds, &c. so as to bring about universal and enduring confusion and
evil. Not until she is destroyed can the beneficent gods
establish law and order and make the earth habitable and
beautiful.
But although Tiamat was slain, the everlasting battle between the forces of good and evil was ever waged in
the Babylonian world. Certain evil spirits were let loose
at certain periods, and they strove to accomplish the destruction of mankind and his works. These invisible
enemies were either charmed away by performing magical
ceremonies, or by invoking the gods to thwart them and bind them. Other spirits inhabited the bodies of animals and were
ever hovering near. The ghosts of the dead and male and female demons were birds, like the birds of Fate
which sang to Siegfried. When the owl raised its melancholy voice in the darkness the listener heard the
spirit of a departed mother crying for her child. Ghosts
and evil spirits wandered through the streets in darkness;
they haunted empty houses; they fluttered through the
evening air as bats; they hastened, moaning dismally, across barren wastes searching for food or lay in wait
for travellers ; they came as roaring lions and howl
ing jackals, hungering for human flesh. The " shedu "
was a destructive bull which might slay man wantonly
or as a protector of temples. Of like character was the
" lamassu ", depicted as a winged bull with human head, the protector of palaces; the "alu" was a bull -like
demon of tempest, and there were also many composite, distorted, or formless monsters which were vaguely
termed " seizers " or " overthrowers ", the Semitic
" labashu " and " ach-chazu ", the Sumerian " dimmea "
and " dimme-kur ". A dialectic form of "gallu" or devil

was "mulla". Professor Pinches thinks it not improbable
that "mulla" may be connected with the word " mula ",
meaning " star ", and suggests that it referred to a " will

rhyme. Some call him Robin Good-fellow,
Hob-goblin, or mad Crisp,
And some againe doe tearme him oft By name of Will the Wisp.
Other names are "Kitty", " Peg ", and "Jack with a

sang:
I should indeed as soon expect
That Peg-a-lantern would direct

As wand'ring stars, quite out of sight.
In Shakespeare's Tempest* a sailor exclaims : " Your
fairy, which, you say, is a harmless fairy, has done little better than played the Jack with us". Dr. Johnson com
mented that the reference was to "Jack with a lantern".
Milton wrote also of the "wandering fire",
Which oft, they say, some evil spirit attends,
Hovering and blazing with delusive light, Misleads th' amaz'd night wand'rer from his way
To bogs and mires, and oft through pond or pool; There swallowed up and lost from succour far.3
"When we stick in the mire", sang Drayton, "he doth with laughter leave us." These fires were also "fallen

5 "death fires", and "fire drakes":
So have I seen a fire drake glide along
Before a dying man, to point his grave,
And in it stick and hide.4

Pliny referred to the wandering lights as stars. 1 The
Sumerian "mulla" was undoubtedly an evil spirit. In
some countries the " fire drake " is a bird with gleaming
breast: in Babylonia it assumed the form of a bull, and may have had some connection with the bull of Ishtar.
Like the Indian " Dasyu " and "Dasa",2 Gallu was
applied in the sense of "foreign devil " to human and
superhuman adversaries of certain monarchs. Some of
the supernatural beings resemble our elves and fairies
and the Indian Rakshasas. Occasionally they appear in
comely human guise; at other times they are vaguely
monstrous. The best known of this class is Lilith, who,
according to Hebrew tradition, preserved in the Talmud,
was the demon lover of Adam. She has been immortalized
by Dante Gabriel Rossetti:
Of Adam's first wife Li lit h, it is told (The witch he loved before the gift of Eve)
That, ere the snake's, her sweet tongue could deceive,
And her enchanted hair was the first gold.
And still she sits, young while the earth is old,
And, subtly of herself contemplative,
Draws men to watch the bright web she can weave, Till heart and body and life are in its hold.
The rose and poppy are her flowers; for where
Is he not found, O Lilith, whom shed scent
And soft shed kisses and soft sleep shall snare ?
Lo! as that youth's eyes burned at thine, so went
Thy spell through him, and left his straight neck bent
And round his heart one strangling golden hair.
Lilith is the Babylonian Lilithu, a feminine form of Lilu, the Sumerian Lila. She resembles Surpanakha of
the Rdmdyana, who made love to Rama and Lakshmana, and the sister of the demon Hidimva, who became

enamoured of Bhima, one of the heroes of the Mahd
bh&rataf and the various fairy lovers of Europe who
lured men to eternal imprisonment inside mountains, or vanished for ever when they were completely under their
influence, leaving them demented. The elfin Lilu similarly wooed young women, like the Germanic Laurin of
the "Wonderful Rose Garden ",2 who carried away the
fair lady Kunhild to his underground dwelling amidst the Tyrolese mountains, or left them haunting the place of their meetings, searching for him in vain:
A savage place ! as holy and enchanted
As ere beneath the waning moon was haunted
By woman wailing for her demon lover . . .
His flashing eyes, his floating hair ! Weave a circle round him thrice,
And close your eyes with holy dread,
For he on honey dew hath fed
And drunk the milk of Paradise.
Coleridge s Kubla Khan.
Another materializing spirit of this class was Ardat
Lili, who appears to have wedded human beings like the swan maidens, the mermaids, and Nereids of the Euro
pean folk tales, and the goddess Ganga, who for a time was the wife of King Shantanu of the Mahdbhdrata?
The Labartu, to whom we have referred, was a female who haunted mountains and marshes ; like the fairies
and hags of Europe, she stole or afflicted children, who accordingly had to wear charms round their necks for
protection. Seven of these supernatural beings were
reputed to be daughters of Anu, the sky god.
The Alu, a storm deity, was also a spirit which caused
nightmare. It endeavoured to smother sleepers like the

Scandinavian hag Mara, and similarly deprived them of power to move. In Babylonia this evil spirit might also cause sleeplessness or death by hovering near a bed. In
shape it might be as horrible and repulsive as the Egyptian ghosts which caused children to die from fright or by
sucking out the breath of life.
As most representatives of the spirit world were enemies of the living, so were the ghosts of dead men
and women. Death chilled all human affections; it turned
love to hate; the deeper the love had been, the deeper became the enmity fostered by the ghost. Certain ghosts
might also be regarded as particularly virulent and hostile
if they happened to have left the body of one who was
ceremonially impure. The most terrible ghost in Baby
lonia was that of a woman who had died in childbed. She was pitied and dreaded ; her grief had demented
her; she was doomed to wail in the darkness; her im
purity clung to her like poison. No spirit was more prone to work evil against mankind, and her hostility was accompanied by the most tragic sorrow. In Northern
India the Hindus, like the ancient Babylonians, regard
as a fearsome demon the ghost of a woman who died
while pregnant, or on the day of the child's birth. 1 A
similar belief prevailed, in Mexico. In Europe there
are many folk tales of dead mothers who return to
avenge themselves on the cruel fathers of neglected
children.
A sharp contrast is presented by the Mongolian
Buriats, whose outlook on the spirit world is less gloomy
than was that of the ancient Babylonians. According to
Mr. Jeremiah Curtin, this interesting people are wont
to perform a ceremony with purpose to entice the ghost to return to the dead body a proceeding which is

dreaded in the Scottish Highlands. 1 The Buriats address
the ghost, saying: " You shall sleep well. Come back
to your natural ashes. Take pity on your friends. It
is necessary to live a real life. Do not wander along the
mountains. Do not be like bad spirits. Return to your
peaceful home. . . . Come back and work for your
children. How can you leave the little ones?" If it
is a mother, these words have great effect; sometimes the spirit moans and sobs, and the Buriats tell that
there have been instances of it returning to the body. 2
In his Arabia Deserta* Doughty relates that Arab women
and children mock the cries of the owl. One explained
to him: "It is a wailful woman seeking her lost child; she has become this forlorn bird ". So do immemorial
beliefs survive to our own day.
The Babylonian ghosts of unmarried men and women and of those without offspring were also disconsolate
night wanderers. Others who suffered similar fates were
the ghosts of men who died in battle far from home and
were left unburied, the ghosts of travellers who perished in the desert and were not covered over, the ghosts of
drowned men which rose from the water, the ghosts of
prisoners starved to death or executed, the ghosts of
people who died violent deaths before their appointed
time. The dead required to be cared for, to have liba
tions poured out, to be fed, so that they might not prowl
1 When a person, young or old, is dying, near relatives must not call out their names
in case the soul may come back from the spirit world. A similar belief still lingers, especially among women, in the Lowlands. The writer was once present in a room when a child was supposed to be dying. Suddenly the mother called out the child's
name in agonized voice. It revived soon afterwards. Two old women who had at
tempted to prevent " the calling" shook their heads and remarked: "She has done it!
The child will never do any good in this world after being called back/' In England and Ireland, as well as in Scotland, the belief also prevails in certain localities that if a
dying person is " called back" the soul will tarry for another twenty-four hours, during which the individual will suffer great agony.

through the streets or enter houses searching for scraps
of food and pure water. The duty of giving offerings to the dead was imposed apparently on near relatives.
As in India, it would appear that the eldest son per
formed the funeral ceremony: a dreadful fate therefore
awaited the spirit of the dead Babylonian man or woman
without offspring. In Sanskrit literature there is a refer
ence to a priest who was not allowed to enter Paradise,
although he had performed rigid penances, because he had no children. 1 There were hags and giants of mountain and desert,
of river and ocean. Demons might possess the pig, the
goat, the horse, the lion, or the ibis, the raven, or the hawk. The seven spirits of tempest, fire, and destruction rose from the depths of ocean, and there were hosts of demons
which could not be overcome or baffled by man without
the assistance of the gods to whom they were hostile.
Many were sexless; having no offspring, they were devoid
of mercy and compassion. They penetrated everywhere:
The high enclosures, the broad enclosures* like a flood
they pass through, From house to house they dash along.
No door can shut them out ; No bolt can turn them back.
Through the door, like a snake, they glide,
Through the hinge, like the wind, they storm, Tearing the wife from the embrace of the man, Driving the freedman from his family home. 2
These furies did not confine their unwelcomed attentions to mankind alone:
They hunt the doves from their cotes,
And drive the birds from their nests,

The Babylonian poet, like Burns, was filled with pity for the animals which suffered in the storm:

And close thy e'e?
According to Babylonian belief, " the great storms
directed from heaven " were caused by demons. Man
kind heard them "loudly roaring above, gibbering below". 1
The south wind was raised by Shutu, a plumed storm
demon resembling Hraesvelgur of the Icelandic Eddas:
Corpse-swal lower sits at the end of heaven,
A Jotun in eagle form; From his wings, they say, comes the wind which fares Over all the dwellers of earth. 2
The northern story of Thor's fishing, when he hooked
and wounded the Midgard serpent, is recalled by the
Babylonian legend of Adapa, son of the god Ea. This
hero was engaged catching fish, when Shutu, the south
wind, upset his boat. In his wrath Adapa immediately
attacked the storm demon and shattered her pinions.
Anu, the sky god, was moved to anger against Ea's son

and summoned him to the Celestial Court. Adapa, how
ever, appeared in garments of mourning and was forgiven.
Anu offered him the water of life and the bread of life which would have made him immortal, but Ea's son
refused to eat or drink, believing, as his father had
warned him, that the sky god desired him to partake of the bread of death and to drink of the water of
death.
Another terrible atmospheric demon was the southwest wind, which caused destructive storms and floods,
and claimed many human victims like the Icelandic
" corpse swallower ". She was depicted with lidless
staring eyes, broad flat nose, mouth gaping horribly, and showing tusk-like teeth, and with high cheek bones, heavy
eyebrows, and low bulging forehead. In Scotland the hag of the south-west wind is
similarly a bloodthirsty and fearsome demon. She is
most virulent in the springtime. At Cromarty she is
quaintly called " Gentle Annie " by the fisher folks, who
repeat the saying: "When Gentle Annie is skyawlan (yelling) roond the heel of Ness (a promontory) wi' a white feather on her hat (the foam of big billows) they
(the spirits) will be harrying (robbing) the crook " that is, the pot which hangs from the crook is empty
during the spring storms, which prevent fishermen going
to sea. In England the wind hag is Black Annis, who dwells in a Leicestershire hill cave. She may be identical
with the Irish hag Anu, associated with the "Paps of
Anu ". According to Gaelic lore, this wind demon of
spring is the "Cailleach "
(old wife). She gives her name in the Highland calendar to the stormy period of late
spring; she raises gale after gale to prevent the coming of summer. Angerboda, the Icelandic hag, is also a storm
demon, but represents the east wind. A Tyrolese folk



74 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
tale tells of three magic maidens who dwelt on Jochgrimm
mountain, where they "brewed the winds". Their demon
lovers were Ecke, "he who causes fear"; Vasolt, "he who causes dismay"; and the scornful Dietrich in his
mythical character of Donar or Thunor (Thor), the thunderer. Another Sumerian storm demon was the Zu bird,
which is represented among the stars by Pegasus and
Taurus. A legend relates that this " worker of evil,
who raised the head of evil", once aspired to rule the
gods, and stole from Bel, " the lord " of deities, the
Tablets of Destiny, which gave him his power over the
Universe as controller of the fates of all. The Zu bird
escaped with the Tablets and found shelter on its moun
tain top in Arabia. Anu called on Ramman, the thun
derer, to attack the Zu bird, but he was afraid; other
gods appear to have shrunk from the conflict. How the
rebel was overcome is not certain, because the legend sur
vives in fragmentary form. There is a reference, how
ever, to the moon god setting out towards the mountain
in Arabia with purpose to outwit the Zu bird and recover
the lost Tablets. How he fared it is impossible to ascertain. In another legend that of Etana the mother
serpent, addressing the sun god, Shamash, says:
Thy net is like unto the broad earth; Thy snare is like unto the distant heaven! <
Who hath ever escaped from thy net?
Even Zu, the worker of evil, who raised the head
of evil [did not escape] !
L. W. King's Translation.
In Indian mythology, Garuda, half giant, half eagle,
robs the Amrita (ambrosia) of the gods which gives them their power and renders them immortal. It had assumed
a golden body, bright as the sun. Indra, the thunderer,



DEMONS, FAIRIES, AND GHOSTS 75
flung his bolt in vain ; he could not wound Garuda,
and only displaced a single feather. Afterwards, how
ever, he stole the moon goblet containing the Amrita, which Garuda had delivered to his enemies, the serpents, to
free his mother from bondage. This Indian eagle giant
became the vehicle of the god Vishnu, and, according to the Mahdbhdratay
" mocked the wind with his fleetness ".
It would appear that the Babylonian Zu bird sym
bolized the summer sandstorms from the Arabian desert.
Thunder is associated with the rainy season, and it may
have been assumed, therefore, that the thunder god was
powerless against the sandstorm demon, who was chased, however, by the moon, and finally overcome by the triumphant sun when it broke through the darkening sand drift
and brightened heaven and earth, " netting*' the rebellious
demon who desired to establish the rule of evil over gods and mankind. In the " Legend of Etana" the Eagle, another demon which links with the Indian Garuda, slayer of serpents, devours the brood of the Mother Serpent. For this
offence against divine law, Shamash, the sun god, pro
nounces the Eagle's doom. He instructs the Mother
Serpent to slay a wild ox and conceal herself in its en
trails. The Eagle comes to feed on the carcass, unheeding
the warning of one of his children, who says, "The serpent lies in this wild ox":
He swooped down-and stood upon the wild ox,
The Eagle . . . examined the flesh;
He looked about carefully before and behind him;
He again examined the flesh; He looked about carefully before and behind him,
Then, moving swiftly, he made for the hidden parts.
When he entered into the midst,
The serpent seized him by his wing. (C642) 8



76 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
In vain the Eagle appealed for mercy to the Mother
Serpent, who was compelled to execute the decree of
Shamash; she tore off the Eagle's pinions, wings, and claws, and threw him into a pit where he perished from
hunger and thirst. 1 This myth may refer to the ravages
of a winged demon of disease who was thwarted by the
sacrifice of an ox. The Mother Serpent appears to be
identical with an ancient goddess of maternity resem
bling the Egyptian Bast, the serpent mother of Bubastis.
According to Sumerian belief, Nintu, " a form of the
goddess Ma", was half a serpent. On her head there is
a horn; she is "girt about the loins"; her left arm holds
"a babe suckling her breast":
From her head to her loins The body is that of a naked woman;
From the loins to the sole of the foot
Scales like those of a snake are visible.
R. C. Thompson's Translation.
The close association of gods and demons is illustrated
in an obscure myth which may refer to an eclipse of the
moon or a night storm at the beginning of the rainy
season. The demons go to war against the high gods,
and are assisted by Adad (Ramman) the thunderer, Shamash the sun, and Ishtar. They desire to wreck the
heavens, the home of Anu:
They clustered angrily round the crescent of the moon god,
And won over to their aid Shamash, the mighty, and Adad, the
warrior, And Ishtar, who with Anu, the King, Hath founded a shining dwelling.
The moon god Sin, " the seed of mankind ", was
darkened by the demons who raged, "rushing loose over

the land " like to the wind, Bel called upon his messen
ger, whom he sent to Ea in the ocean depths, saying:
"My son Sin . . . hath been grievously bedimmed". Ea
lamented, and dispatched his son Merodach to net the
demons by magic, using " a two-coloured cord from the hair of a virgin kid and from the wool of a virgin lamb". 1
As in India, where Shitala, the Bengali goddess of
smallpox, for instance, is worshipped when the dreaded disease she controls becomes epidemic, so in Babylonia
the people sought to secure immunity from attack by
worshipping spirits of disease. A tablet relates that Ura,
a plague demon, once resolved to destroy all life, but
ultimately consented to spare those who praised his name
and exalted him in recognition of his bravery and power. This could be accomplished by reciting a formula. Indian
serpent worshippers believe that their devotions "destroy all danger proceeding from snakes' 1
.
2
Like the Ancient Egyptians, the Babylonians also had
their kindly spirits who brought luck and the various
enjoyments of life. A good "labartu" might attend on
a human being like a household fairy of India or Europe:
a friendly " shedu " could protect a household against the attacks of fierce demons and human enemies. Even the
spirits of Fate who served Anu, god of the sky, and that
"Norn" of the Underworld, Eresh-ki-gal, queen of Hades, might sometimes be propitious : if the deities were successfully invoked they could cause the Fates to
smite spirits of disease and bringers of ill luck. Damu,
a friendly fairy goddess, was well loved, because she
inspired pleasant dreams, relieved the sufferings of the
1 cihe Devils and Evil Spirits of Babylonia, R. Campbell Thompson, vol. i, p. 53
et seq, 3 Omens and Superstitions of Southern lndia> E. Thurston, p. 124..



7 8 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
afflicted, and restored to good health those patients whom she selected to favour.
In the Egyptian Book of the Dead the kindly spirits are overshadowed by the evil ones, because the various
magical spells which were put on record were directed
against those supernatural beings who were enemies of
mankind. Similarly in Babylonia the fragments of this class of literature which survive deal mainly with wicked
and vengeful demons. It appears probable, however, that the highly emotional Sumerians and Akkadians were
on occasion quite as cheerful a people as the inhabitants
of ancient Egypt. Although they were surrounded by
bloodthirsty furies who desired to shorten their days, and
their nights were filled with vague lowering phantoms which inspired fear, they no doubt shared, in their charm
protected houses, a comfortable feeling of security after
performing magical ceremonies, and were happy enough
when they gathered round flickering lights to listen to ancient song and story and gossip about crops and traders, the members of the royal house, and the family affairs of
their acquaintances.
The Babylonian spirit world, it will be seen, was of complex character. Its inhabitants were numberless, but
often vaguely defined, and one class of demons linked
with another. Like the European fairies of folk belief,
the Babylonian spirits were extremely hostile and irresistible at certain seasonal periods; and they were fickle
and perverse and difficult to please even when inclined
to be friendly. They were also similarly manifested from time to time in various forms. Sometimes they were
comely and beautiful; at other times they were appari
tions of horror. The Jinn of present-day Arabians are
of like character; these may be giants, cloudy shapes,
comely women, serpents or cats, goats or pigs.



DEMONS, FAIRIES, AND GHOSTS 79
Some of the composite monsters of Babylonia may
suggest the vague and exaggerated recollections of terror
stricken people who have had glimpses of unfamiliar wild
beasts in the dusk or amidst reedy marshes. But they cannot be wholly accounted for in this way. While
animals were often identified with supernatural beings,
and foreigners were called cc devils ", it would be mis
leading to assert that the spirit world reflects confused
folk memories of human and bestial enemies. Even when a demon was given concrete human form it re
mained essentially non-human: no ordinary weapon could inflict an injury, and it was never controlled by natural
laws. The spirits of disease and tempest and darkness
were creations of fancy: they symbolized moods; they
were the causes which explained effects. A sculptor or
storyteller who desired to convey an impression of a spirit of storm or pestilence created monstrous forms to
inspire terror. Sudden and unexpected visits of fierce and
devastating demons were accounted for by asserting that
they had wings like eagles, were nimble-footed as gazelles,
cunning and watchful as serpents; that they had claws to
clutch, horns to gore, and powerful fore legs like a lion to smite down victims. Withal they drank blood like
ravens and devoured corpses like hyaenas. Monsters were all the more repulsive when they were partly human. The human-headed snake or the snake-headed man and the man with the horns of a wild bull and the legs of a
goat were horrible in the extreme. Evil spirits might
sometimes achieve success by practising deception. They
might appear as beautiful girls or handsome men and
seize unsuspecting victims in deathly embrace or leave them demented and full of grief, or come as birds and
suddenly assume awesome shapes. Fairies and elves, and other half-human demons, are



8o MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
sometimes regarded as degenerate gods. It will be seen, however, that while certain spirits developed into deities, others remained something between these two classes of
supernatural beings: they might attend upon gods and
goddesses, or operate independently now against man
kind and now against deities even. The " namtaru ",
for instance, was a spirit of fate, the son of Bel-Enlil and
Eresh-ki-gal, queen of Hades. " Apparently ", writes
Professor Pinches, " he executed the instructions given
him concerning the fate of men, and could also have power
over certain of the gods." 1 To this middle class belong
the evil gods who rebelled against the beneficent deities.
According to Hebridean folk belief, the fallen angels are
divided into three classes the fairies, the "nimble men*'
(aurora borealis), and the "blue men of the Minch".
In Beowu/fthe "brood of Cain " includes "monsters and
elves and sea-devils giants also, who long time fought with God, for which he gave them their reward".2 Simi
larly the Babylonian spirit groups are liable to division
and subdivision. The various classes may be regarded
as relics of the various stages of development from crude animism to sublime monotheism : in the fragmentary
legends we trace the floating material from which great
mythologies have been framed.

AMONG the gods of Babylonia none achieved wider and
more enduring fame than Tammuz, who was loved by
Ishtar, the amorous Queen of Heaven the beautiful youth who died and was mourned for and came to life
again. He does not figure by his popular name in any of the city pantheons, but from the earliest times of which
we have knowledge until the passing of Babylonian civilization, he played a prominent part in the religious life of the people.
Tammuz, like Osiris of Egypt, was an agricultural
deity, and as the Babylonian harvest was the gift of the
rivers, it is probable that one of his several forms was
Dumu-zi-abzu, "Tammuz of the Abyss ". He was also



82 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
"the child", "the heroic lord ", "the sentinel", "the
healer ", and the patriarch who reigned over the early
Babylonians for a considerable period. "Tammuz of the
Abyss " was one of the members of the family of Ea,
god of the Deep, whose other sons, in addition to
Merodach, were Nira, an obscure deity; Ki-gulla, "world
destroyer ", Burnunta-sa, " broad ear ", and Bara and Baragulla, probably "revealers" or "oracles'*. In addi
tion there was a daughter, Khi-dimme-azaga, "child of the renowned spirit ". She may have been identical with
Belit-sheri, who is referred to in the Sumerian hymns as
the sister of Tammuz. This family group was probably
formed by symbolizing the attributes of Ea and his spouse Damkina. Tammuz, in his character as a patriarch, may
have been regarded as a hostage from the gods: the
human form of Ea, who instructed mankind, like King
Osiris, how to grow corn and cultivate fruit trees. As
the youth who perished annually, he was the corn
spirit. He is referred to in the Bible by his Babylonian name.
When Ezekiel detailed the various idolatrous prac
tices of the Israelites, which included the worship of the
sun and " every form of creeping things and abominable
beasts" a suggestion of the composite monsters of Baby
lonia he was brought " to the door of the gate of the
Lord's house, which was towards the north; and, behold,
there sat women weeping for Tammuz ".*
The weeping ceremony was connected with agricul
tural rites. Corn deities were weeping deities, they shed fertilizing tears ; and the sowers simulated the sorrow
of divine mourners when they cast seed in the soil " to
die ", so that it might spring up as corn. This ancient
custom, like many others, contributed to the poetic



TAMMUZ AND ISHTAR 83
imagery of the Bible. " They that sow in tears ", David
sang, " shall reap in joy. He that goeth forth and
weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him/' 1
In Egypt the priestesses who acted the parts of Isis and
Nepthys, mourned for the slain corn god Osiris.
Gods and men before the face of the gods are weeping for
thee at the same time, when they behold me ! . . .
All thy sister goddesses are at thy side and behind thy couch,
Calling upon thee with weeping yet thou are prostrate upon
thy bed ! . . . Live before us, desiring to behold thee. 2
It was believed to be essential that human beings should share the universal sorrow caused by the death
of a god. If they remained unsympathetic, the deities would punish them as enemies. Worshippers of nature
gods, therefore, based their ceremonial practices on natural
phenomena. "The dread of the worshippers that the neglect of the usual ritual would be followed by disaster,
is particularly intelligible ", writes Professor Robertson
Smith, " if they regarded the necessary operations of agriculture as involving the violent extinction of a particle
of divine life." 3 By observing their ritual, the wor
shippers won the sympathy and co-operation of deities, or exercised a magical control over nature.
The Babylonian myth of Tammuz, the dying god, bears a close resemblance to the Greek myth of Adonis.
It also links with the myth of Osiris. According to Pro
fessor Sayce, Tammuz is identical with "Daonus or Daos,
the shepherd of Pantibibla ", referred to by Berosus as
the ruler of one of the mythical ages of Babylonia. We
1 Psalms, cxxvi. 8 The Burden of his, J. T. Dennis (Wisdom of the East scries), pp. Z1 9 22.
* Religion of the Semites^ pp. 412, 414.



84 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
have therefore to deal with Tammuz in his twofold
character as a patriarch and a god of fertility.
The Adonis version of the myth may be summarized
briefly. Ere the god was born, his mother, who was pursued by her angry sire, as the river goddesses of the folk
tales are pursued by the well demons, transformed herself
into a tree. Adonis sprang from the trunk of this tree,
and Aphrodite, having placed the child in a chest, committed him to the care of Persephone, queen of Hades,
who resembles the Babylonian Eresh-ki-gal. Persephone desired to retain the young god, and Aphrodite (Ishtar)
appealed to Zeus (Anu), who decreed that Adonis should
spend part of the year with one goddess and part of the year with the other.
It is suggested that the myth of Adonis was derived in post -Homeric times by the Greeks indirectly from
Babylonia through the Western Semites, the Semitic title
"Adbn", meaning "lord", having been mistaken for a proper name. This theory, however, cannot be accepted without qualifications. It does not explain the existence
of either- the Phrygian myth of Attis, which was de
veloped differently from the Tammuz myth, or the Celtic
story of " Diarmid and the boar ", which belongs to the
archaeological " Hunting Period ". There are traces in
Greek mythology of pre-Hellenic myths about dying harvest deities, like Hyakinthos and Erigone, for instance, who appear to have been mourned for. There is every
possibility, therefore, that the Tammuz ritual may have been attached to a harvest god of the pre-Hellenic Greeks,
who received at the same time the new name of Adonis.
Osiris of Egypt resembles Tammuz, but his Mesopo
tamian origin has not been proved. It would appear
probable that Tammuz, Attis, Osiris, and the deities
represented by Adonis and Diarmid were all developed



TAMMUZ AND ISHTAR 85
from an archaic god of fertility and vegetation, the central
figure of a myth which was not only as ancient as the
knowledge and practice of agriculture, but had existence
even in the "Hunting Period ". Traces of the Tammuz
Osiris story in various forms are found all over the area occupied by the Mediterranean or Brown race from
Sumeria to the British Isles. Apparently the original myth was connected with tree and water worship and
the worship of animals. Adonis sprang from a tree; the body of Osiris was concealed in a tree which grew round
the sea-drifted chest in which he was concealed. Diarmid concealed himself in a tree when pursued by Finn. The blood of Tammuz, Osiris, and Adonis reddened the swollen rivers which fertilized the soil. Various animals
were associated with the harvest god, who appears to have been manifested from time to time in different forms, for
his spirit pervaded all nature. In Egypt the soul of
Osiris entered the Apis bull or the ram of Mendes.
Tammuz in the hymns is called " the pre-eminent
steer of heaven ", and a popular sacrifice was "a white
kid of the god Tammuz'', which, however, might be substituted by a sucking pig. Osiris had also associa
tions with swine, and the Egyptians, according to Hero
dotus, sacrificed a pig to him annually. When Set at
full moon hunted the boar in the Delta marshes, he probably hunted the boar form of Osiris, whose human body
had been recovered from the sacred tree by I sis. As the
soul of Bata, the hero of the Egyptian folk tale,
1 migrated from the blossom to the bull, and the bull to the tree, so
apparently did the soul of Osiris pass from incarnation to
incarnation. Set, the demon slayer of the harvest god,
had also a boar form; he was the black pig who devoured
the waning moon and blinded the Eye of Ra.

In his character as a long-lived patriarch, Tammuz, the King Daonus or Daos of Berosus, reigned in Baby
lonia for 36,000 years. When he died, he departed to
Hades or the Abyss. Osiris, after reigning over the Egyptians, became Judge of the Dead.
Tammuz of the Sumerian hymns, however, is the Adonis-like god who lived on earth for a part of the
year as the shepherd and agriculturist so dearly beloved by the goddess Ishtar. Then he died so that he might
depart to the realm of Eresh-ki-gal (Persephone), queen of Hades. According to one account, his death was caused
by the fickle Ishtar. When that goddess wooed Gilgamesh,
the Babylonian Hercules, he upbraided her, saying:
On Tammuz, the spouse of thy youth,
Thou didst lay affliction every year. Kings Translation.
References in the Sumerian hymns suggest that there
also existed a form of the legend which gave an account
of the slaying of the young god by someone else than
Ishtar. The slayer may have been a Set-like demon
perhaps Nin-shach, who appears to have symbolized the
destroying influence of the sun. He was a war deity,
and his name, Professor Pinches says, " is conjectured to mean 'lord of the wild boar' ". There is no direct evi
dence, however, to connect Tammuz's slayer with the boar
which killed Adonis. Ishtar's innocence is emphasized by
the fact that she mourned for her youthful lover, crying:
Oh hero, my lord, ah me ! I will say ;
Food I eat not . . . water I drink not . . . Because of the exalted one of the nether world, him of the
radiant face, yea radiant, Of the exalted one of the nether world, him of the dove
like voice, yea dove-like. 1

The Phrygian Attis met his death, according to one legend, by self-mutilation under a sacred tree. Another
account sets forth, however, that he was slain by a boar.
The Greek Adonis was similarly killed by a boar. This animal was a form of Ares (Mars), god of war and
tempest, who also loved Aphrodite (Ishtar). The Celtic Diarmid, in his character as a love god, with lunar attri
butes, was slain by " the green boar ", which appears to have been one of the animals of a ferocious Hag, an
earth and air " mother " with various names. In one
of the many Fingalian stories the animal is
. . . That venomous boar, and he so fierce, That Grey Eyebrows had with her herd of swine.1
Diarmid had eloped with the wife of Finn-mac-Coul
(Fingal), who, like Ares, plotted to bring about his rival's death, and accordingly set the young hero to hunt the
boar. As a thunder god Finn carried a hammer with
which he smote his shield; the blows were heard in
Lochlann (Scandinavia). Diarmid, like Tammuz, the "god of the tender voice and shining eyes", had much
beauty. When he expired, Finn cried:
No maiden will raise her eye
Since the mould has gone over thy visage fair . . . Blue without rashness in thine eye !
Passion and beauty behind thy curls ! . . .
Oh, yesternight it was green the hillock,
Red is it this day with Diarmid's blood.2
Tammuz died with the dying vegetation, and Diarmid
expired when the hills apparently were assuming their
purple tints.8 The month of Tammuz wailings was from

brought forth the demons of pestilence. The mourners chanted:
He has gone, he has gone to the bosom of the earth,
And the dead are numerous in the land . . .
Men are filled with sorrow: they stagger by day in gloom . . . In the month of thy year which brings not peace hast thou gone.
Thou hast gone on a journey that makes an end of thy people.
The following extract contains a reference to the
slaying of the god:
The holy one of Ishtar, in the middle of the year the fields lan
guish ...
The shepherd, the wise one, the man of sorrows, why have they slain ? . . .
In his temple, in his inhabited domain,
The child, lord of knowledge, abides no more . . .
In the meadows, verily, verily, the soul of life perishes.
There is wailing for Tammuz " at the sacred cedar,
where the mother bore thee ", a reference which connects
the god, like Adonis and Osiris, with tree worship:
The wailing is for the herbs : the first lament is,
" they are not
produced ".
The wailing is for the grain, ears are not produced. The wailing is for the habitations, for the flocks which bring forth no more.
The wailing is for the perishing wedded ones; for the perishing children; the dark-headed people create no more.
The wailing is also for the shrunken river, the parched
meadows, the fishpools, the cane brakes, the forests, the
deities who differed from the Celtic Danann deities. Theodoric the Goth, as Dietrich von Bern, was identified, for instance, with Donar or Thunor (Thor), the thunder godc In Scotland Finn and his followers are all giants. Diarmid is the patriarch of the
Campbell clan, the MacDiarmids being " sons of Diarmid ".

plains, the gardens, and the palace, which all suffer because
the god of fertility has departed. The mourner cries :
How long shall the springing of verdure be restrained ?
How long shall the putting forth of leaves be held back?
Whither went Tammuz ? His destination has already
been referred to as "the bosom of the earth", and in the Assyrian version of the "Descent of Ishtar" he dwells in
"the house of darkness " among the dead, "where dust is their nourishment and their food mud", and "the
light is never seen" the gloomy Babylonian Hades. In
one of the Sumerian hymns, however, it is stated that
Tammuz "upon the flood was cast out". The reference
may be to the submarine " house of Ea ", or the Blessed
Island to which the Babylonian Noah was carried. In this Hades bloomed the nether "garden of Adonis".
The following extract refers to the garden of Damu
(Tammuz) 1
:
Damu his youth therein slumbers . . . Among the garden flowers he slumbers; among the garden flowers
he is cast away . . .
Among the tamarisks he slumbers, with woe he causes us to be
satiated.
Although Tammuz of the hymns was slain, he returned again from Hades. Apparently he came back as
a child. He is wailed for as " child, Lord Gishzida ",
as well as "my hero Damu". In his lunar character the
Egyptian Osiris appeared each month as " the child sur
passingly beautiful "
; the Osiris bull was also a child of
the moon ;
" it was begotten ", says Plutarch, " by a ray
of generative light falling from the moon". When the bull of Attis was sacrificed his worshippers were drenched

with its blood, and were afterwards ceremonially fed with
milk, as they were supposed to have " renewed their
youth" and become children. The ancient Greek god
Eros (Cupid) was represented as a wanton boy or hand
some youth. Another god of fertility, the Irish Angus,
who resembles Eros, is called "the ever young"; he
slumbers like Tammuz and awakes in the Spring.
Apparently it was believed that the child god, Tammuz, returned from the earlier Sumerian Paradise of the Deep,
and grew into full manhood in a comparatively brief period,
like Vyasa and other super-men of Indian mythology. A
couplet from a Tammuz hymn says tersely :
In his infancy in a sunken boat he lay. In his manhood in the submerged grain he lay.
1
The "boat" may be the "chest" in which Adonis
was concealed by Aphrodite when she confided him to
the care of Persephone, queen of Hades, who desired to retain the young god, but was compelled by Zeus to
send him back to the goddess of love and vegetation.
The fact that Ishtar descended to Hades in quest of
Tammuz may perhaps explain the symbolic references in hymns to mother goddesses being in sunken boats also
when their powers were in abeyance, as were those of the
god for part of each year. It is possible, too, that the boat had a lunar and a solar significance. Khonsu, the Egyp
tian moon god, for instance, was associated with the Spring
sun, being a deity of fertility and therefore a corn spirit ;
he was a form of Osiris, the Patriarch, who sojourned on
earth to teach mankind how to grow corn and cultivate
fruit trees. In the Egyptian legend Osiris received the
corn seeds from Isis, which suggests that among Great

TAMMUZ AND ISHTAR 91
Mother-worshipping peoples, it was believed that agri
cultural civilization had a female origin. The same myths may have been attached to corn gods and corn goddesses,
associated with water, sun, moon, and stars. That there existed in Babylonia at an extremely re
mote period an agricultural myth regarding a Patriarch of
divine origin who was rescued from a boat in his child
hood, is suggested by the legend which was attached to
the memory of the usurper King Sargon of Akkad. It
runs as follows:
" I am Sargon, the mighty King of Akkad. My mother was a
vestal (priestess), my father an alien, whose brother inhabited the
mountain. . . . When my mother had conceived me, she bare
me in a hidden place. She laid me in a vessel of rushes, stopped the door thereof with pitch, and cast me adrift on the river. . . .
The river floated me to Akki, the water drawer, who, in drawing
water, drew me forth. Akki, the water drawer, educated me as
his son, and made me his gardener. As a gardener, I was beloved by the goddess Ishtar."
It is unlikely that this story was invented by Sargon.
Like the many variants of it found in other countries,
it was probably founded on a form of the TammuzAdonis myth. Indeed, a new myth would not have suited
Sargon's purpose so well as the adaptation of an old one, which was more likely to make popular appeal when con
nected with his name. The references to the goddess
Ishtar, and Sargon's early life as a gardener, suggest that the king desired to be remembered as an agricultural
Patriarch, if not of divine, at any rate of semi-divine
origin.
What appears to be an early form of the widespread
Tammuz myth is the Teutonic legend regarding the
mysterious child who came over the sea to inaugurate
a new era of civilization and instruct the people how to
(C642) 9



92 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
grow corn and become great warriors. The Northern
peoples, as archaeological evidence suggests, derived their
knowledge of agriculture, and therefore their agricultural myths, from the Neolithic representatives of the Mediter
ranean race with whom they came into contact. There can
be no doubt but that the Teutonic legend refers to the
introduction of agriculture. The child is called "Scef"
or "Sceaf", which signifies " Sheaf ", or "Scyld, the son
of Sceaf". Scyld is the patriarch of the Scyldings, the Danes, a people of mixed origin. In the Anglo-Saxon
Beowulf poem, the reference is to " Scyld ", but Ethel
weard, William of Malmesbury, and others adhered to
" Sceaf " as the name of the Patriarch of the Western Saxons.
The legend runs that one day a boat was seen
approaching the shore; it was not propelled by oars or
sail. In it lay a child fast asleep, his head pillowed upon
a sheaf of grain. He was surrounded by armour, treasure,
and various implements, including the fire- borer. The
child was reared by the people who found him, and he became a great instructor and warrior and ruled over the
tribe as king. In Beowulf Scyld is the father of the elder
Beowulf, whose grandson Hrothgar built the famous Hall.
The poem opens with a reference to the patriarch " Scyld
of the Sheaf '\ When he died, his body, according to the request he had made, was laid in a ship which was
set adrift:
Upon his breast lay many treasures which were to travel with
him into the power of the flood. Certainly they (the mourners) furnished him with no less of gifts, of tribal treasures, than those
had done who, in his early days, started him over the sea alone,
child as he was. Moreover, they set besides a gold-embroidered standard high above his head, and let the flood bear him gave
him to the sea. Their soul was sad, their spirit sorrowful. Who



TAMMUZ AND ISHTAR 93
received that load, men, chiefs of council, heroes under heaven, cannot for certain tell. 1
Sceaf or Scyld is identical with Yngve, the patriarch
of the Ynglings; with Frey, the harvest and boar god,
son of Njord,
2 the sea god; and with Hermod, referred
to as follows in the Eddie "Lay of Hyndla":
To some grants he wealth, to his children war fame, Word skill to many and wisdom to men,
Fair winds to sea-farers, song craft to skalds, And might of manhood to many a warrior.
Tammuz is similarly "the heroic lord of the land",
the " wise one ", the " lord of knowledge ", and cc the
sovereign, lord of invocation ".
Heimdal, watchman of the Teutonic gods, also dwelt
for a time among men as " Rig ", and had human off
spring, his son Thrall being the ancestor of the Thralls, his son Churl of churls, and Jarl of noblemen.
Tammuz, like Heimdal, is also a guardian. He
watches the flocks and herds, whom he apparently guards against the Gallu demons as Heimdal guards the world and the heavens against attacks by giants and monsters.
The flocks of Tammuz, Professor Pinches suggests, "re
call the flocks of the Greek sun god Helios. These were
the clouds illuminated by the sun, which were likened to
sheep indeed, one of the early Sumerian expressions for
c fleece* was c sheep of the sky'. The name of Tammuz
in Sumerian is Dumu-zi, or in its rare fullest form, Dumu
zida, meaning < true or faithful son \ There is prob
ably some legend attached to this which is at present
unknown." 3

So the Sumerian hymn-chanters lamented:
Like an herdsman the sentinel place of sheep and cattle he (Tammuz) has forsaken . . .
From his home, from his inhabited domain, the son, he of wisdom,
pre-eminent steer of heaven,
The hero unto the nether herding place has taken his way. 1
Agni, the Aryo-Indian god, who, as the sky sentinel, has points of resemblance to Heimdal, also links with
Tammuz, especially in his Mitra character:
Agni has been established among the tribes of men, the son of
the waters, Mitra acting in the right way. Rigveda, iii, 5^.3. Agni, who has been looked and longed for in Heaven, who has
been looked for on earth he who has been looked for has entered
all herbs. Rigveda y i, g8. 2
Tammuz, like the Egyptian lunar and solar god
Khonsu, is "the healer ", and Agni "drives away all dis
ease". Tammuz is the god "of sonorous voice "; Agni
" roars like a bull"; and Heimdal blows a horn when the
giants and demons threaten to attack the citadel of the
gods. As the spring sun god, Tammuz is " a youthful
warrior ", says Jastrow, " triumphing over the storms of
winter ",3 The storms, of course, were symbolized as
demons. Tammuz, " the heroic lord ", was therefore
a demon slayer like Heimdal and Agni. Each of these
gods appear to have been developed in isolation from an
archaic spring god of fertility and corn whose attributes
were symbolized. In Teutonic mythology, for instance, Heimdal was the warrior form of the patriarch Scef, while
Frey was the deified agriculturist who came over the
deep as a child. In Saxo's mythical history of Denmark,
1 Langdon's Sumerian and Babylonian Psalms, pp. 325, 3392 Professor Oldenberg's translation. 3 Osiris is also invoked to "remove storms and rain and give fecundity in the nighttime". As a spring sun god he slays demons; as A lunar god he brings fertility.



TAMMUZ AND ISHTAR 95
Frey as Frode is taken prisoner by a storm giant, Beli,
" the howler ", and is loved by his hag sister in the
Teutonic Hades, as Tammuz is loved by Eresh-ki-gal,
spouse of the storm god Nergal, in the Babylonian Hades. Frode returns to earth, like Tammuz, in due season.
It is evident that there were various versions of the
Tammuz myth in Ancient Babylonia. In one the goddess
Ishtar visited Hades to search for the lover of her youth.
A part of this form of the legend survives in the famous
Assyrian hymn known as "The Descent of Ishtar ". It
was first translated by the late Mr. George Smith, of the
British Museum. A box containing inscribed tablets had
been sent from Assyria to London, and Mr. Smith, with
characteristic patience and skill, arranged and deciphered them, giving to the world a fragment of ancient literature
infused with much sublimity and imaginative power. Ishtar is depicted descending to dismal Hades, where the souls of the dead exist in bird forms:
I spread like a bird my hands.
I descend, I descend to the house of darkness, the dwelling of the god Irkalla:
To the house out of which there is no exit,
To the road from which there is no return : To the house from whose entrance the light is taken,
The place where dust is their nourishment and their food mud. Its chiefs also are like birds covered with feathers; The light is never seen, in darkness they dwell. . . .
Over the door and bolts is scattered dust.
When the goddess reaches the gate of Hades she cries
to the porter:
Keeper of the waters, open thy gate,
Open thy gate that I may enter.
If thou openest not the gate that I may enter
I will strike the door, the bolts I will shatter,



96 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
I will strike the threshold and will pass through the doors; I will raise up the dead to devour the living, Above the living the dead shall exceed in numbers.
The porter answers that he must first consult the Queen
of Hades, here called Allatu, to whom he accordingly announces the arrival of the Queen of Heaven. Allatu's
heart is filled with anger, and makes reference to those
whom Ishtar caused to perish:
Let me weep over the strong who have left their wives,
Let me weep over the handmaidens who have lost the embraces of
their husbands,
Over the only son let me mourn, who ere his days are come is
taken away.
Then she issues abruptly the stern decree :
Go, keeper, open the gate to her, Bewitch her according to the ancient rules;
that is, " Deal with her as you deal with others who come here".
As Ishtar enters through the various gates she is
stripped of her ornaments and clothing. At the first gate her crown was taken off, at the second her ear-rings, at
the third her necklace of precious stones, at the fourth the
ornaments of her breast, at the fifth her gemmed waist
girdle,
1 at the sixth the bracelets of her hands and feet,
and at the seventh the covering robe of her body. Ishtar asks at each gate why she is thus dealt with, and the
porter answers, " Such is the command of Allatu."
After descending for a prolonged period the Queen of Heaven at length stands naked before the Queen
of Hades. Ishtar is proud and arrogant, and Allatu,
desiring to punish her rival whom she cannot humble,
1 Like the love-compelling girdle of Aphrodite,



TAMMUZ AND ISHTAR 97
commands the plague demon, Namtar, to strike her with
disease in all parts of her body. The effect of Ishtar's
fate was disastrous upon earth: growth and fertility came
to an end.
Meanwhile Pap-sukal, messenger of the gods, hastened to Shamash, the sun deity, to relate what had occurred.
The sun god immediately consulted his lunar father, Sin,
and Ea, god of the deep. Ea then created a man lion,
named Nadushu-namir, to rescue Ishtar, giving him power
to pass through the seven gates of Hades. When this
being delivered his message
Allatu . . . struck her breast ; she bit her thumb, She turned again : a request she asked not.
In her anger she cursed the rescuer of the Queen of Heaven.
May I imprison thee in the great prison, May the garbage of the foundations of the city be thy food, May the drains of the city be thy drink, May the darkness of the dungeon be thy dwelling, May the stake be thy seat, May hunger and thirst strike thy offspring.
She was compelled, however, to obey the high gods, and addressed Namtar, saying:
Unto Lhtar give the waters of life and bring her before me.
Thereafter the Queen of Heaven was conducted through
the various gates, and at each she received her robe and the ornaments which were taken from her on entering. Namtar says :
Since thou hast not paid a ransom for thy deliverance to her
(Allatu), so to her again turn back,
For Tammuz the husband of thy youth.
The glistening waters (of life) pour over him . . . In splendid clothing dress him, with a ring of crystal adorn him.



98 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
Ishtar mourns for "the wound of Tammuz", smiting
her breast, and she did not ask for " the precious eyestones, her amulets ", which were apparently to ransom
Tammuz. The poem concludes with Ishtar's wail :
O my only brother (Tammuz) thou dost not lament for me.
In the day that Tammuz adorned me, with a ring of crystal,
With a bracelet of emeralds, together with himself, he adorned me,1 With himself he adorned me; may men mourners and women mourners On a bier place him, and assemble the wake.2
A Sumerian hymn to Tammuz throws light on this
narrative. It sets forth that Ishtar descended to Hades
to entreat him to be glad and to resume care of his flocks,
but Tammuz refused or was unable to return.
His spouse unto her abode he sent back.
She then instituted the wailing ceremony:
The amorous Queen of Heaven sits as one in darkness. 3
Mr. Langdon also translates a hymn (Tammuz III) which appears to contain the narrative on which the Assyrian version was founded. The goddess who de
scends to Hades, however, is not Ishtar, but the "sister'*, Belit-sheri. She is accompanied by various demons
the " gallu-demon ", the "slayer", &c. and holds a con
versation with Tammuz which, however, is "unintelligible
and badly broken". Apparently, however, he promises to return to earth.
... I will go up, as for me I will depart with thee . . .
... I will return, unto my mother let us go back.
1 A wedding bracelet of crystal is worn by Hindu women; they break it when the husband dies. 2 Quotations from the translation in The Chaldean Account of Genesis, by George Smith. 8 Langdon' a Sumenan and Babylonian Psalms^ p. 329 et seq.



TAMMUZ AND ISHTAR 99
Probably two goddesses originally lamented for Tarnmuz, as the Egyptian sisters, Isis and Nepthys, lamented
for Osiris, their brother. Ishtar is referred to as " my
mother'*. Isis figures alternately in the Egyptian chants as mother, wife, sister, and daughter of Osiris. She
cries, " Come thou to thy wife in peace ; her heart
fluttereth for thy love", ... u I am thy wife, made
as thou art, the elder sister, soul of her brother*'. . . .
" Come thou to us as a babe ". . . . " Lo, thou art
as the Bull of the two goddesses come thou, child
growing in peace, our lord!" ... "Lo! the Bull,
begotten of the two cows, Isis and Nepthys". . , .
" Come thou to the two widowed goddesses ". . . .
"Oh child, lord, first maker of the body". . . . "Father
Osiris." 1
As Ishtar and Belit-sheri weep for Tammuz, so do
Isis and Nepthys weep for Osiris.
Calling upon thee with weeping yet thou art prostrate upon thy bed! Gods and men . . . arc weeping for thee at the same time, when
they behold me (Isis).
Lo ! I invoke thee with wailing that reacheth high as heaven.
Isis is also identified with Hathor (Ishtar) the Cow. . . .
"The cow weepeth for thee with her voice." 2
There is another phase, however, to the character of
the mother goddess which explains the references to the
desertion and slaying of Tammuz by Ishtar. "She is",
says Jastrow, " the goddess of the human instinct, or
passion which accompanies human love. Gilgamesh . . .
reproaches her with abandoning the objects of her passion after a brief period of union." At Ishtar's temple "public
maidens accepted temporary partners, assigned to them by

Ishtar". 1 The worship of all mother goddesses in ancient
times was accompanied by revolting unmoral rites which
are referred to in condemnatory terms in various passages
in the Old Testament, especially in connection with the
worship of Ashtoreth, who was identical with Ishtar and
the Egyptian Hathor. Ishtar in the process of time overshadowed all the
other female deities of Babylonia, as did Isis in Egypt.
Her name, indeed, which is Semitic, became in the plural,
Ishtarate, a designation for goddesses in general. But although she was referred to as the daughter of the
sky, Anu, or the daughter of the moon, Sin or Nannar, she still retained traces of her ancient character. Origin
ally she was a great mother goddess, who was worshipped
by those who believed that life and the universe had a
female origin in contrast to those who believed in the
theory of male origin. Ishtar is identical with Nina,
the fish goddess, a creature who gave her name to the Sumerian city of Nina and the Assyrian city of Nineveh.
Other forms of the Creatrix included Mama, or Mami,
or Ama, "mother", Aruru, Bau, Gula, and Zer-panitum. These were all "Preservers'" and healers. At the same
time they were " Destroyers ", like Nin-sun and the Queen
of Hades, Eresh-ki-gal or Allatu. They were accompanied by shadowy male forms ere they became wives of
strongly individualized gods, or by child gods, their sons,
who might be regarded as " brothers " or "husbands of
their mothers", to use the paradoxical Egyptian term. Similarly Great Father deities had vaguely defined wives.
The " Semitic " Baal, " the lord ", was accompanied by
a female reflection of himself Beltu, "the lady".
Shamash, the sun god, had for wife the shadowy Aa.

TAMMUZ AND ISHTAR 101
As has been shown, Ishtar is referred to in a Tammuz
hymn as the mother of the child god of fertility. In an
Egyptian hymn the sky goddess Nut, "the mother " of
Osiris, is stated to have a built up life from her own
body". 1 Sri or Lakshmi, the Indian goddess, who became the wife of Vishnu, as the mother goddess Sara
swati, a tribal deity,, became the wife of Brahma, was,
according to a Purana commentator, " the mother of the
world . . . eternal and undecaying". 2
The gods, on the other hand, might die annually : the goddesses alone were immortal. Indra was supposed
to perish of old age, but his wife, Indrani, remained ever
young. There were fourteen Indras in every " day of
Brahma ", a reference apparently to the ancient conception
of Indra among the Great-Mother-worshipping sections of
the Aryo-Indians. 3 In the Mahdbhdmta the god Shiva,
as Mahadeva, commands Indra on "one of the peaks of
Himavat", where they met, to lift up a stone and join
the Indras who had been before him. "And Indra on
removing that stone beheld a cave on the breast of that
king of mountains in which were four others resembling
himself." Indra exclaimed in his grief, " Shall I be even
like these ?" These five Indras, like the " Seven Sleepers ",
awaited the time when they would be called forth. They
were ultimately reborn as the five Pandava warriors.4
The ferocious, black-faced Scottish mother goddess,
Cailleach Bheur, who appears to be identical with Mala
Lith, " Grey Eyebrows " of Fingalian story, and the
English "Black Annis", figures in Irish song and legend
as "The Old Woman of Beare". This "old woman"

periods of youth one after another, so that every man
who had lived with her came to die of old age, and her
grandsons and great-grandsons were tribes and races ".
When old age at length came upon her she sang
her "swan song", from which the following lines are extracted :
Ebb tide to me us of the sea!
Old age causes me reproach . . . It is riches
Ye love, it is not men : In the time when we lived It was men we loved . . . My arms when they are seen
Are bony and thin :
Once they would fondle,
They would be round glorious kings . . I must take my garment even in the sun :
The time is at hand that shall renew me. 1
Freyja, the Germanic mother goddess, whose car was
drawn by cats, had similarly many lovers. In the Ice
landic poem " Lokasenna ", Loki taunts her, saying:
Silence, Freyja! Full well I know thee,
And faultless art thou not found ; Of the gods and elves who here are gathered Each one hast thou made thy mate.
Idun, the keeper of the apples of immortal youth,
which prevent the gods growing old, is similarly addressed :
Silence, Idun ! I swear, of all women
Thou the most wanton art ;
Who couldst fling those fair-washed arms of thine About thy brother's slayer.

The goddesses of classic mythology had similar
reputations. Aphrodite (Venus) had many divine and mortal lovers. She links closely with Astarte and Ashto
reth (Ishtar), and reference has already been made to her
relations with Adonis (Tammuz). These love deities
were all as cruel as they were wayward. When Ishtar
wooed the Babylonian hero, Gilgamesh, he spurned her advances, as has been indicated, saying:
On Tammuz, the spouse of thy youth,
Thou didst lay affliction every year.
Thou didst love the brilliant Allalu bird But thou didst smite him and break his wing;
He stands in the woods and cries "O my wing".
He likewise charged her with deceiving the lion and the
horse, making reference to obscure myths:
Thou didst also love a shepherd of the flock,
Who continually poured out for thee the libation,
And daily slaughtered kids for thee ; But thou didst smite him and didst change him into a leopard,
So that his own sheep boy hunted him,
And his own hounds tore him to pieces.2
These goddesses were ever prone to afflict human
beings who might offend them or of whom they wearied.
Demeter (Ceres) changed Ascalaphus into an owl and Stellio into a lizard. Rhea (Ops) resembled

the wanton who loved Attis (Adonis). Artemis (Diana) slew her lover Orion, changed Actaeon into a stag, which
was torn to pieces by his own dogs, and caused numerous
deaths by sending a boar to ravage the fields of Qineus,
king of Calydon. Human sacrifices were frequently
offered to the bloodthirsty "mothers". The most famous victim of Artemis was the daughter of Aga
memnon, " divinely tall and most divinely fair ".* Agamemnon had slain a sacred stag, and the goddess
punished him by sending a calm when the war fleet was
about to sail for Troy, with the result that his daughter
had to be sacrificed. Artemis thus sold breezes like the northern wind hags and witches.
It used to be customary to account for the similarities
manifested by the various mother goddesses by assuming that there was constant cultural contact between separate
nationalities, and, as a result, a not inconsiderable amount
of " religious borrowing ". Greece was supposed to have
received its great goddesses from the western Semites,
who had come under the spell of Babylonian religion. Archaeological evidence, however, tends to disprove this
theory. " The most recent researches into Mesopotamia!!
history ", writes Dr. Farnell, " establish with certainty the conclusion that there was no direct political contact
possible between the powers in the valley of the Euphrates and the western shores of the -#Lgean in the second millennium B.C. In fact, between the nascent Hellas
and the great world of Mesopotamia there were powerful
and possibly independent strata of cultures interposing/' 2 The real connection appears to be the racial one.
Among the Mediterranean Neolithic tribes of Sumeria,
Arabia, and Europe, the goddess cult appears to have
1 Tennyson*8 A Dream of Fair Women* 3 Greece and Babylon, L. R. Farnell (Edinburgh, I9ii)> P* 35'



TAMMUZ AND ISHTAR 105
been influential. Mother worship was the predominant
characteristic of their religious systems, so that the Greek
goddesses were probably of pre- Hellenic origin, the
Celtic of Iberian, the Egyptian of proto-Egyptian, and
the Babylonian of Sumerian. The northern hillmen,
on the other hand, who may be identified with the
" Aryans " of the philologists, were father worshippers. The Vedic Aryo-lndians worshipped father gods,
1 as did
also the Germanic peoples and certain tribes in the
" Hittite confederacy ". Earth spirits were males, like
the Teutonic elves, the Aryo-Indian Ribhus, and the
Burkans, " masters ", of the present-day Buriats, a Mon
golian people. When the father-worshipping peoples
invaded the dominions of the mother-worshipping peoples, they introduced their strongly individualized gods, but
they did not displace the mother goddesses. " The
Aryan Hellenes ", says Dr. Farnell, " were able to plant their Zeus and Poseidon on the high hill of Athens, but not to overthrow the supremacy of Athena in the
central shrine and in the aboriginal soul of the Athenian
people/' 2 As in Egypt, the beliefs of the father wor
shippers, represented by the self-created Ptah, were fused
with the beliefs of the mother worshippers, who adored
Isis, Mut, Neith, and others. In Babylonia this process of racial and religious fusion v/as well advanced before the
dawn of history. Ea, who had already assumed manifold
forms, may have originally been the son or child lover of
Damkina, "Lady of the Deep", as was Tammnz of Ishtar.
As the fish, Ea was the offspring of the mother river.
The mother worshippers recognized male as well as
female deities, but regarded the great goddess as the First
Cause. Although the primeval spirits were grouped in

Vedic Aryans. J Greece and Babylon, p. 96.

four pairs in Egypt, and apparently in Babylonia also, the female in the first pair was more strongly indi
vidualized than the male. The Egyptian Nu is vaguer
than his consort Nut, and the Babylonian Apsu than his
consort Tiamat. Indeed, in the narrative of the Creation Tablets of Babylon, which will receive full treatment
in a later chapter, Tiamat, the great mother, is the con
trolling spirit. She is more powerful and ferocious than
Apsu, and lives longer. After Apsu's death she elevates
one of her brood, named Kingu, to be her consort, a fact which suggests that in the Ishtar-Tammuz myth survives
the influence of exceedingly ancient modes of thought.
Like Tiamat, Ishtar is also a great battle heroine, and in
this capacity she was addressed as "the lady of majestic rank
exalted over all gods". This was no idle flattery on the
part of worshippers, but a memory of her ancient supremacy.
Reference has been made to the introduction of
Tammuz worship into Jerusalem. Ishtar, as Queen of Heaven, was also adored by the backsliding Israelites
as a deity of battle and harvest. When Jeremiah cen
sured the people for burning incense and serving gods
" whom they knew not ", he said, " neither they, ye, nor your fathers", they made answer: "Since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out
drink offerings unto her, we have wanted all things, and have been consumed by the sword and the famine ".
The women took a leading part in these practices, but
refused to accept all the blame, saying, " When we burned incense to the queen of heaven, and poured out drink
offerings unto her, did we make our cakes and pour out
drink offerings unto her without our men?" 1 That the
husbands, and the children even, assisted at the ceremony
is made evident in another reference to goddess worship:

TAMMUZ AND 1SHTAR 107
"The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the
fire, and the women knead the dough, to make cakes to the queen of heaven ".1
Jastrow suggests that the women of Israel wept for Tammuz, offered cakes to the mother goddess, &c.,
because " in all religious bodies . . . women represent the conservative element ; among them religious customs continue in practice after they have been abandoned by
men ".2 The evidence of Jeremiah, however, shows that the men certainly co-operated at the archaic ceremonials.
In lighting the fires with the "vital spark", they ap
parently acted in imitation of the god of fertility. The
women, on the other hand, represented the reproductive harvest goddess in providing the food supply. In recognition of her gift, they rewarded the goddess by offering her the cakes prepared from the newly ground
wheat and barley the " first fruits of the harvest ". As
the corn god came as a child, the children began the
ceremony by gathering the wood for the sacred fire.
When the women mourned for Tammuz, they did so evidently because the death of the god was lamented
by the goddess Ishtar. It would appear, therefore, that
the suggestion regarding the " conservative element "
should really apply to the immemorial practices of folk religion. These differed from the refined ceremonies of
the official cult in Babylonia, where there were suitable
temples and organized bands of priests and priestesses. But the official cult received no recognition in Palestine; the cakes intended for a goddess were not offered up in
the temple of Abraham's God, but " in the streets of
Jerusalem " and those of other cities.3

The obvious deduction seems to be that in ancient
times women everywhere played a prominent part in the ceremonial folk worship of the Great Mother goddess,
while the men took the lesser part of the god whom
she had brought into being and afterwards received as cc husband of his mother ". This may account for the
high social status of women among goddess worshippers, like the representatives of the Mediterranean race, whose
early religion was not confined to temples, but closely associated with the acts of everyday life.

WHEN the curtain rises to reveal the drama of Babylonian
civilization we find that we have missed the first act and
its many fascinating scenes. Sumerians and Akkadians
come and go, but it is not always possible to distinguish between them. Although most Semites are recognizable
by their flowing beards, prominent noses, and long robes,
some have so closely imitated the Sumerians as to suffer
almost complete loss of identity. It is noticeable that in
the north the Akkadians are more Semitic than their con
temporaries in the south, but it is difficult at times to say
whether a city is controlled by the descendants of the in
digenous people or those of later settlers. Dynasties rise
and fall, and, as in Egypt at times, the progress of the
fragmentary narrative is interrupted by a sudden change
109



no MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
of scene ere we have properly grasped a situation and
realized its significance. What we know for certain is that civilization is well
advanced. Both in the north and the south there are
many organized and independent city states, and not unfrequently these wage war one against another. Occasion
ally ambitious rulers tower among their fellows, conduct
vigorous military campaigns, and become overlords of
wide districts. As a rule, a subjugated monarch who has
perforce to acknowledge the suzerainty of a powerful king is allowed to remain in a state of semi-independence on
condition that he pays a heavy annual tribute of grain.
His own laws continue in force, and the city deities
remain supreme, although recognition may also be given
to the deities of his conqueror. He styles himself a
Patesi a cc
priest king ", or more literally, " servant of the chief deity ". But as an independent monarch may
also' be a pious Patesi, it does not always follow when a
ruler is referred to by that title he is necessarily less
powerful than his neighbours.
When the historical narrative begins Akkad included
the cities of Babylon, Cutha, Kish, Akkad, and Sippar, and north of Babylonia proper is Semitic Opis. Among
the cities of Sumer were Eridu, Ur, Lagash, Larsa, Erech,
Shuruppak, and probably Nippur, which was situated on
the " border ". On the north Assyria was yet " in the
making ", and shrouded in obscurity. A vague but vast
area above Hit on the Euphrates, and extending to the
Syrian coast, was known as the "land of the Amorites".
The fish -shaped Babylonian valley lying between the rivers, where walled towns were surrounded by green
fields and numerous canals flashed in the sunshine, was
bounded on the west by the bleak wastes of the Arabian
desert? where during the dry season " the rocks branded



WARS OF CITY STATES in
the body " and occasional sandstorms swept in blinding
folds towards the "plain of Shinar" (Sumer) like demon
hosts who sought to destroy the world. To the east the
skyline was fretted by the Persian Highlands, and amidst the southern mountains dwelt the fierce Elamites, the
hereditary enemies of the Sumerians, although a people apparently of the same origin. Like the Nubians and
the Libyans, who kept watchful eyes on Egypt, the Elamites seemed ever to be hovering on the eastern
frontier of Sumeria, longing for an opportunity to raid
and plunder. The capital of the Elamites was the city of Susa,
where excavations have revealed traces of an independent
civilization which reaches back to an early period in the
Late Stone Age. Susa is referred to in the Old Testa
ment "The words of Nehemiah ... I was in Shushan
the palace ".* An Assyrian plan of the city shows it occupying a strategic position at a bend of the Shawur river, which afforded protection against Sumerian attacks from the west, while a canal curved round its northern
and eastern sides, so that Susa was completely surrounded
by water. Fortifications had been erected on the river
and canal banks, and between these and the high city
walls were thick clumps of trees. That the kings of
Elam imitated the splendours of Babylonian courts in
the later days of Esther and Haman and Mordecai, is
made evident by the Biblical references to the gorgeous
palace, which had " white, green, and blue hangings, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver
rings and pillars of marble; the beds were of gold and
silver, upon a pavement of red, and blue, and white, and
black marble ",2 Beyond Elam were the plains, plateaus,
and grassy steppes occupied by the Medes and other

ii2 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
peoples of Aryan speech. Cultural influences came and went like spring winds between the various ancient com
munities.
For ten long centuries Sumer and Akkad flourished
and prospered ere we meet with the great Hammurabi, whose name has now become almost as familiar as that
of Julius Caesar. But our knowledge of the leading his
torical events of this vast period is exceedingly fragmen
tary. The Sumerians were not like the later Assyrians
or their Egyptian contemporaries a people with a passion
for history. When inscriptions were composed and cut on stone, or impressed upon clay tablets and bricks, the kings selected as a general rule to record pious deeds
rather than to celebrate their victories and conquests.
Indeed, the average monarch had a temperament resem
bling that of Keats, who declared:
The silver flow Of Hero's tears, the swoon of Imogen, Fair Pastorella in the bandits' den, Are things to brood on with more ardency
Than the death day of empires.
The Sumerian king was emotionally religious as the
great English poet was emotionally poetical. The tears of Ishtar for Tammuz, and the afflictions endured by the
goddess imprisoned in Hades, to which she had descended
for love of her slain husband, seemed to have concerned
the royal recorder to a greater degree than the memories
of political upheavals and the social changes which passed over the land, like the seasons which alternately brought
greenness and gold, barrenness and flood.
City chronicles, as a rule, are but indices of obscure
events, to which meagre references were sometimes also
made on mace heads, vases, tablets, stelae, and sculptured



WARS OF CITY STATES 113
monoliths. Consequently, present-day excavators and students have often reason to be grateful that the habit
likewise obtained of inscribing on bricks in buildings and
the stone sockets of doors the names of kings and others.
These records render obscure periods faintly articulate,
and are indispensable for comparative purposes. Historical clues are also obtained from lists of year names.
Each city king named a year in celebration of a great
event his own succession to the throne, the erection
of a new temple or of a city wall, or, mayhap, the defeat of an invading army from a rival state. Sometimes, too,
a monarch gave the name of his father in an official
inscription, or happily mentioned several ancestors. An
other may be found to have made an illuminating state
ment regarding a predecessor, who centuries previously erected the particular temple that he himself has piously
restored. A reckoning of this kind, however, cannot
always be regarded as absolutely correct. It must be compared with and tested by other records, for in these
ancient days calculations were not unfrequently based
on doubtful inscriptions, or mere oral traditions, perhaps.
Nor can implicit trust be placed on every reference to
historical events, for the memoried deeds of great rulers were not always unassociated with persistent and cumu
lative myths. It must be recognized, therefore, that even portions of the data which had of late been sifted and
systematized by Oriental scholars in Europe, may yet have to be subjected to revision. Many interesting and
important discoveries, which will throw fresh light on this fascinating early period, remain to be made in that ancient and deserted land, which still lies under the
curse of the Hebrew prophet, who exclaimed: "Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees' ex
cellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and



ii 4 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
Gomorrah. It shall never be inhabited ; neither shall
the Arabian pitch tent there ; neither shall the shep
herds make their fold there. But wild beasts of the
desert shall lie there; and their houses shall be full of
doleful creatures; and owls shall dwell there, and satyrs
shall dance there. And the wild beasts of the islands
shall cry in their desolate houses and dragons ill their
pleasant palaces." 1
The curtain rises, as has been indicated, after civiliza
tion had been well advanced. To begin with, our interests
abide with Akkad, and during a period dated approxi
mately between 3000 B.C. and 2800 B.C., when Egypt was already a united kingdom, and the Cretans were at the
dawn of the first early Minoan period, and beginning to use bronze. In Kish Sumerian and Akkadian elements
had apparently blended, and the city was the centre of a
powerful and independent government. After years have fluttered past dimly, and with them the shadow-shapes of
vigorous rulers, it is found that Kish came under the
sway of the pronouncedly Semitic city of Opis, which was
situated " farthest north " and on the western bank of
the river Tigris. A century elapsed ere Kish again threw off the oppressor's yoke and renewed the strength of its
youtTh.he city of Kish was one of the many ancient centres
of goddess worship. The Great Mother appears to have been the Sumerian Bau, whose chief seat was at Lagash.
If tradition is to be relied upon, Kish owed its existence
to that notable lady, Queen Azag-Bau. Although float
ing legends gathered round her memory as they have often gathered round the memories of famous men, like Sargon of Akkad, Alexander the Great, and Theodoric
the Goth, who became Emperor of Rome, it is probable
1 Isaiah, xiii, 19-22.



WARS OF CITY STATES 115
that the queen was a prominent historical personage. She was reputed to have been of humble origin, and to have
first achieved popularity and influence as the keeper of a
wine shop. Although no reference survives to indicate that she was believed to be of miraculous birth, the
Chronicle of Kish gravely credits her with a prolonged
and apparently prosperous reign of a hundred years. Her
son, who succeeded her, sat on the throne for a quarter of a century. These calculations are certainly remarkable. If the Queen Azag-Bau founded Kish when she was only
twenty, and gave birth to the future ruler in her fiftieth
year, he must have been an elderly gentleman of seventy
when he began to reign. When it is found, further, that the dynasty in which mother and son flourished was sup
posed to have lasted for 586 years, divided between eight
rulers, one of whom reigned for only three years, two for six, and two for eleven, it becomes evident that the
historian of Kish cannot be absolutely relied upon in
detail. It seems evident that the memory of this lady of
forceful character, who flourished about thirteen hundred
years before the rise of Queen Hatshepsut of Egypt, has overshadowed the doubtful annals of ancient Kish at a period when Sumerian and Semite were striving in the
various states to achieve political ascendancy. Meanwhile the purely Sumerian city of Lagash had
similarly grown powerful and aggressive. For a time it acknowledged the suzerainty of Kish, but ultimately it
threw off the oppressor's yoke and asserted its indepen
dence. The cumulative efforts of a succession of energetic
rulers elevated Lagash to the position of a metropolis in
Ancient Babylonia.
The goddess Bau, "the mother of Lagash", was
worshipped in conjunction with other deities, including the god Nin-Girsu, an agricultural deity, and therefore



n6 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
a deity of war, who had solar attributes. One of the
titles of Nin-Girsu was En-Mersi, which, according to Assyrian evidence, was another name of Tammuz, the
spring god who slew the storm and winter demons, and
made the land fertile so that man might have food. Nin
Girsu was, it would seem, a developed form of Tammuz, like the Scandinavian Frey, god of harvest, or Heimdal, the celestial warrior. Bau was one of the several god
desses whose attributes were absorbed by the Semitic
Ishtar. She was a " Great Mother ", a creatrix, the
source of all human and bestial life, and, of course, a
harvest goddess. She was identified with Gula, " the
great one", who cured diseases and prolonged life. Evi
dently the religion of Lagash was based on the popular worship of the "Queen of Heaven", and her son, the
dying god who became " husband of his mother ".
The first great and outstanding ruler of Lagash was Ur-Nina, who appears to have owed his power to the
successful military operations of his predecessors. It is uncertain whether or not he himself engaged in any great
war. His records are silent in that connection, but, judging from what we know of him, it may be taken
for granted that he was able and fully prepared to give
a good account of himself in battle. He certainly took
steps to make secure his position, for he caused a strong wall to be erected round Lagash. His inscriptions are
eloquent of his piety, which took practical shape, for
he repaired and built temples, dedicated offerings to deities, and increased the wealth of religious bodies and
the prosperity of the State by cutting canals and develop
ing agriculture. In addition to serving local deities, he
also gave practical recognition to Ea at Eridu and Enlil
at Nippur. He, however, overlooked Anu at Erech, a fact which suggests that he held sway over Eridu and



W -H Z>






WARS OF CITY STATES 117
Nippur, but had to recognize Ercch as an independent
city state.
Among the deities of Lagash, Ur-Nina favoured most
the goddess Nina, whose name he bore. As she was
a water deity, and perhaps identical with Belit-sheri, sister
of " Tammuz of the Abyss " and daughter of Ea, one of the canals was dedicated to her. She was also honoured
with a new temple, in which was probably placed her
great statue, constructed by special order of her royal
worshipper. Like the Egyptian goddess, the " Mother of Mendes ", Nina received offerings of fish, not only
as a patroness of fishermen, but also as a corn spirit and a goddess of maternity. She was in time identified
with Ishtar.
A famous limestone plaque, which is preserved in the
Louvre, Paris, depicts on its upper half the pious King Ur-Nina engaged in the ceremony of laying the foundations of a temple dedicated either to the goddess Nina
or to the god Nin-Girsu. His face and scalp are clean
shaven, and he has a prominent nose and firm mouth,
eloquent of decision. The folds of neck and jaw suggest
Bismarckian traits. He is bare to the waist, and wears
a pleated kilt, with three flounces, which reaches almost
to his ankles. On his long head he has poised deftly
a woven basket containing the clay with which he is to
make the first brick. In front of him stand five figures.
The foremost is honoured by being sculptured larger than
the others, except the prominent monarch. Apparently
this is a royal princess, for her head is unshaven, and her shoulder dress or long hair drops over one of her arms.
Her name is Lida, and the conspicuous part she took in
the ceremony suggests that she was the representative of the goddess Nina. She is accompanied by her brothers,
and at least one official, Anita, the cup-bearer, or high



n8 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
priest. The concluding part of this ceremony, or another ceremonial act, is illustrated on the lower part of the
plaque. Ur-Nina is seated on his throne, not, as would
seem at first sight, raising the wine cup to his lips and
toasting to the success of the work, but pouring out a
libation upon the ground. The princess is not present; the place of honour next to the king is taken by the
crown prince. Possibly in this case it is the god Nin
Girsu who is being honoured. Three male figures, per
haps royal sons, accompany the prominent crown prince.
The cup-bearer is in attendance behind the throne.
The inscription on this plaque, which is pierced in the centre so as to be nailed to a sacred shrine, refers to the
temples erected by Ur-Nina, including those of Nina and Nin-Girsu.
After Ur-Nina's prosperous reign came to a close,
his son Akurgal ascended the throne. He had trouble with Umma, a powerful city, which lay to the north-west of Lagash, between the Shatt-el-Kai and Shatt-el-Hai
canals. An army of raiders invaded his territory and had
to be driven back. The next king, whose name was Eannatum, had
Napoleonic characteristics. He was a military genius with great ambitions, and was successful in establishing by conquest a small but brilliant empire. Like his grand
father, he strengthened the fortifications of Lagash; then
he engaged in a series of successful campaigns. Umma
had been causing anxiety in Lagash, but Eannatum
stormed and captured that rival city, appropriated one of its fertile plains, and imposed an annual tribute to
be paid in kind. An army of Elamites swept down from
the hills, but Ur-Nina's grandson inflicted upon these
bold foreigners a crushing defeat and pursued them over the frontier. Several cities were afterwards forced to



WARS OF CITY STATES 119
come under the sway of triumphant Lagash, including Erech and Ur, and as his suzerainty was already acknowledged at Eridu, Eannatum's power in Sumeria became
as supreme as it was firmly established.
Evidently Zuzu, king of the northern city of Opis, considered that the occasion was opportune to overcome
the powerful Sumerian conqueror, and at the same time establish Semitic rule over the subdued and war-wasted
cities. He marched south with a large army, but the tireless and ever-watchful Eannatum hastened to the fray,
scattered the forces of Opis, and captured the foolhardy Zuzu.
Eannatum's activities, however, were not confined to
battlefields. At Lagash he carried out great improve
ments in the interests of agriculture ; he constructed a
large reservoir and developed the canal system. He also
extended and repaired existing temples in his native city and at Erech. Being a patron of the arts, he encouraged
sculpture work, and the finest Sumerian examples belong
to his reign. Eannatum was succeeded by his brother, Enannatum I. Apparently the new monarch did not share the military
qualities of his royal predecessor, for there were signs of
unrest in the loose confederacy of states. Indeed, Umma
revolted. From that city an army marched forth and took forcible possession of the plain which Eannatum had
appropriated, removing and breaking the landmarks, and
otherwise challenging the supremacy of the sovran state.
A Lagash force defeated the men of Umma, but appears to have done little more than hold in check their aggressive
tendencies.
No sooner had Entemena, the next king, ascended the throne than the flame of revolt burst forth again. The
Patesi of Umma was evidently determined to free, once



MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
and for all, his native state from the yoke of Lagash.
But he had gravely miscalculated the strength of the
vigorous young ruler. Entemena inflicted upon the
rebels a crushing defeat, and following up his success, entered the walled city and captured and slew the patesi. Then he took steps to stamp out the embers of revolt
in Umma by appointing as its governor one of his own
officials, named Hi, who was duly installed with great
ceremony. Other military successes followed, including the sacking of Opis and Kish, which assured the suprem
acy of Lagash for many years. Entemena, with charac
teristic vigour, engaged himself during periods of peace in strengthening his city fortifications and in continuing the work of improving and developing the irrigation
system. He lived in the golden age of Sutnerian art,
and to his reign belongs the exquisite silver vase of Lagash, which was taken from the Tello mound, and is
now in the Louvre. This votive offering was placed by
the king in the temple of Nin-Girsu. It is exquisitely
shaped, and has a base of copper. The symbolic decorations include the lion-headed eagle, which was probably
a form of the spring god of war and fertility, the lion, beloved by the Mother goddess, and deer and ibexes, which recall the mountain herds of Astarte. In the
dedicatory inscription the king is referred to as a patesi, and the fact that the name of the high priest, Dudu, is given may be taken as an indication of the growing power
of an aggressive priesthood. After a brilliant reign of twenty-nine years the king died, and was succeeded by
his son, Enannatum II, who was the last ruler of Ur
Nina's line. An obscure period ensued. Apparently
there had been a city revolt, which may have given the
enemies of Lagash the desired opportunity to gather strength for the coming conflict. There is a reference to

an Elamite raid which, although repulsed, may be regarded as proof of disturbed political conditions.
One or two priests sat on the throne of Lagash in
brief succession, and then arose to power the famous
Urukagina, the first reformer in history. He began to
rule as patesi, but afterwards styled himself king. What
appears certain is that he was the leader of a great social
upheaval, which received the support of a section of the
priesthood, for he recorded that his elevation was due to
the intercession of the god Nin-Girsu. Other deities,
who were sons and daughters of Nin-Girsu and Nina,
had been given recognition by his predecessors, and it is possible that the orthodox section of Lagash, and
especially the agricultural classes, supported the new ruler in sweeping away innovations to which they were
hostile.
Like Khufu and his descendants, the Pyramid kings
of Egypt's fourth dynasty, the vigorous and efficient monarchs of the Ur-Nina dynasty of Lagash were apparently remembered and execrated as tyrants and oppres
sors of the people. To maintain many endowed temples
and a standing army the traders and agriculturists had been heavily taxed. Each successive monarch who under
took public works on a large scale for the purpose of
extending and developing the area under cultivation, appears to have done so mainly to increase the revenue
of the exchequer, so as to conserve the strength of the
city and secure its pre-eminence as a metropolis. A leisured class had come into existence, with the result
that culture was fostered and civilization advanced.
Lagash seems to have been intensely modern in character prior to 2800 B.C., but with the passing of the old order
of things there arose grave social problems which never
appear to have been seriously dealt with. All indications

of social unrest were, it would appear, severely repressed by the iron-gloved monarchs of Ur-Nina's dynasty.
The people as a whole groaned under an everincreasing burden of taxation. Sumeria was overrun by
an army of officials who were notoriously corrupt; they do not appear to have been held in check, as in Egypt,
by royal auditors. " In the domain of Nin-Girsu ", one
of Urukagina's tablets sets forth, " there were tax
gatherers down to the sea." They not only attended to the needs of the exchequer, but enriched themselves
by sheer robbery, while the priests followed their example
by doubling their fees and appropriating temple offerings
to their own use. The splendid organization of Lagash
was crippled by the dishonesty of those who should have
been its main support.
Reforms were necessary and perhaps overdue, but,
unfortunately for Lagash, Urukagina's zeal for the people's cause amounted to fanaticism. Instead of gradually re
adjusting the machinery of government so as to secure equality of treatment without impairing its efficiency as
a defensive force in these perilous times, he inaugurated
sweeping and revolutionary social changes of far-reaching
character regardless of consequences. Taxes and temple fees were cut down, and the number of officials reduced
to a minimum. Society was thoroughly disorganized.
The army, which was recruited mainly from the leisured
and official classes, went practically out of existence, so that traders and agriculturists obtained relief from taxation
at the expense of their material security.
Urukagina's motives were undoubtedly above reproach, and he showed an example to all who occupied
positions of trust by living an upright life and denying
himself luxuries. He was disinterestedly pious, and built and restored temples, and acted as the steward of his god



WARS OF CITY STATES 123
with desire to promote the welfare and comfort of all true worshippers. His Jaws were similar to those which over two centuries afterwards were codified by Hammurabi,
and like that monarch he was professedly the guardian of the weak and the helper of the needy; he sought to establish justice and liberty in the kingdom. But his social Arcadia vanished like a dream because he failed
to recognize that Right must be supported by Might. In bringing about his sudden social revolution,
Urukagina had at the same time unwittingly let loose the forces of disorder. Discontented and unemployed
officials, and many representatives of the despoiled leisured
and military classes of Lagash, no doubt sought refuge elsewhere, and fostered the spirit of revolt which ever
smouldered in subject states. At any rate, Umma, re
membering the oppressions of other days, was not slow to recognize that the iron hand of Lagash had become
unnerved. The zealous and iconoclastic reformer had
reigned but seven years when he was called upon to de
fend his people against the invader. He appears to have
been utterly unprepared to do so. The victorious forces
of Umma swept against the stately city of Lagash and shattered its power in a single day. Echoes of the great
disaster which ensued rise from a pious tablet inscription
left by a priest, who was convinced that the conquerors would be called to account for the sins they had com
mitted against the great god Nin-Girsu. He lamented
the butchery and robbery which had taken place. We gather from his composition that blood was shed by the
raiders of Umma even in the sacred precincts of temples,
that statues were shattered, that silver and precious stones
were carried away, that granaries were plundered and stand
ing crops destroyed, and that many buildings were set on fire. Amidst these horrors of savagery and vengeance,

i2 4 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
the now tragic figure of the great reformer suddenly vanishes from before our eyes. Perhaps he perished
in a burning temple; perhaps he found a nameless grave with the thousands of his subjects whose bodies had lain scattered about the blood-stained streets. With Uruka
gina the glory of Lagash departed. Although the city was rebuilt in time, and was even made more stately than
before, it never again became the metropolis of Sumeria.
The vengeful destroyer of Lagash was Lugal-zaggisi, Patesi of Umma, a masterful figure in early Sumerian
history. We gather from the tablet of the unknown
scribe, who regarded him as a sinner against the god
Nin-Girsu, that his city goddess was named Nidaba. He appears also to have been a worshipper of Enlil of
Nippur, to whose influence he credited his military suc
cesses. But Enlil was not his highest god, he was the
interceder who carried the prayers of Lugal-zaggisi to
the beloved father, Anu, god of the sky. No doubt Nin
Girsu represented a school of theology which was asso
ciated with unpleasant memories in Umma. The sacking
and burning of the temples of Lagash suggests as much. Having broken the power of Lagash, Lugal-zaggisi directed his attention to the rival city of Kish, where
Semitic influence was predominating. When Nanizak, the last monarch of the line of the famous Queen Azag
Bau, had sat upon the throne for but three years, he
perished by the sword of the Umma conqueror. Nippur likewise came under his sway, and he also subdued the southern cities.
Lugal-zaggisi chose for his capital ancient Erech, the city of Anu, and of his daughter, the goddess Nana, who afterwards was identified with Ishtar. Ami's spouse was
Anatu, and the pair subsequently became abstract deities, like Anshar and Kishar, their parents, who figure in the



WARS OF CITY STATES 125
Babylonian Creation story. Nana was worshipped as the
goddess of vegetation, and her relation to Anu was similar
to that of Belit-sheri to Ea at Eridu. Anu and Ea were
originally identical, but it would appear that the one was differentiated as the god of the waters above the heaven
and the other as god of the waters beneath the earth, both being forms of Anshar. Elsewhere the chief god of the
spring sun or the moon, the lover of the goddess, became
pre-eminent, displacing the elder god, like Nin-Girsu at Lagash. At Sippar the sun god, Babbar, whose Semitic name was Shamash, was exalted as the chief deity, while
the moon god remained supreme at Ur. This specializing
process, which was due to local theorizing and the in
fluence of alien settlers, has been dealt with in a previous
chapter. In referring to himself as the favoured ruler of various
city deities, Lugal-zaggisi appears as a ruler of all Sumeria.
How far his empire extended it is impossible to determine
with certainty. He appears to have overrun Akkad, and
even penetrated to the Syrian coast, for in one inscription
it is stated that he " made straight his path from the Lower Sea (the Persian Gulf) over the Euphrates and
Tigris to the Upper Sea (the Mediterranean) ". The allegiance of certain states, however, depended on the
strength of the central power. One of his successors
found it necessary to attack Kish, which was ever waiting
for an opportunity to regain its independence. According to the Chronicle of Kish, the next ruler of
Sumer and Akkad after Lugal-zaggisi was the famous Sargon I. It would appear that he was an adventurer
or usurper, and that he owed his throne indirectly to Lugal-zaggisi, who had dethroned the ruler of Akkad. Later traditions, which have been partly confirmed by con
temporary inscriptions, agree that Sargon was of humble



126 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
birth. In the previous chapter reference was made to the Tammuz-like myth attached to his memory. His mother
was a vestal virgin dedicated to the sun god, Shamash, and his father an unknown stranger from the mountains
a suggestion of immediate Semitic affinities. Perhaps
Sargon owed his rise to power to the assistance received
by bands of settlers from the land of the Amorites, which
Lugal-zaggisi had invaded.
According to the legend, Sargon's birth was concealed.
He was placed in a vessel which was committed to the
river. Brought up by a commoner, he lived in obscurity
until the Semitic goddess, Ishtar, gave him her aid.
A similar myth was attached in India to the memory of Kama, the Hector of that great Sanskrit epic the
Mahdbhdrata. Kama's mother, the Princess Pritha, who afterwards became a queen, was loved by the sun god,
Surya. When in secret she gave birth to her son she
placed him in an ark of wickerwork, which was set adrift
on a stream. Ultimately it reached the Ganges, and it
was borne by that river to the country of Anga, where
the child was rescued by a woman and afterwards reared
by her and her husband, a charioteer. In time Kama
became a great warrior, and was crowned King of Anga by the Kaurava warriors.1 Before he became king, Sargon of Akkad, the
Sharrukin of the texts, was, according to tradition, a gardener and watchman attached to the temple of the
war god Zamama of Kish. This deity was subsequently
identified with Merodach, son of Ea; Ninip, son of Enlil;
and Nin-Girsu of Lagash. He was therefore one of the
many developed forms of Tarn muz a solar, corn, and
military deity, and an interceder for mankind. The goddess of Kish appears to have been a form of Bau, as is
1 Indian Myth and Legend, pp. 173-175 and 192-194.



WARS OF CITY STATES 127
testified by the name of Queen Azag-Bau, the legendary founder of the city.
Unfortunately our knowledge of Sargon's reign is of meagre character. It is undoubted that he was a
distinguished general and able ruler. He built up an
empire which included Sumer and Akkad, and also
Amurru, "the western land ", or " land of the Amorites ". The Elamites gave him an opportunity to extend his conquests eastward. They appear to have attacked Opis,
but he drove them back, and on more than one occasion
penetrated their country, over the western part of which,
known as Anshan, he ultimately imposed his rule. Thither went many Semitic settlers who had absorbed the culture of Sumeria.
Durinp Sargon's reign Akkad attained to a splendour
which surpassed that of Babylon. In an omen text the
monarch is lauded as the " highly exalted one without
a peer ". Tradition relates that when he was an old man
all the Babylonian states rose in revolt against him and
besieged Akkad. But the old warrior led forth his army
against the combined forces and achieved a shattering
victory. Manishtusu, who succeeded Sargon I, had similarly
to subdue a great confederacy of thirty-two city states, and must therefore have been a distinguished general.
But he is best known as the monarch who purchased
several large estates adjoining subject cities, his aim having been probably to settle on these Semitic allies
who would be less liable to rebel against him than the
workers they displaced. For the latter, however, he found employment elsewhere. These transactions, which
were recorded on a monument subsequently carried off
with other spoils by the Elamites and discovered at Susa,
show that at this early period (about 2600 B.C.) even a



128 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
conquering monarch considered it advisable to observe
existing land laws. Urumush, 1 the next ruler, also achieved successes in Elam and elsewhere, but his life
was cut short by a palace revolution.
The prominent figure of Naram Sin, a later king of Akkad, bulks largely in history and tradition. According to the Chronicle of Kish, he was a son of Sargon.
Whether he was or not, it is certain that he inherited
the military and administrative genius of that famous
ex-gardener. The arts flourished during his reign. One of the memorable products of the period was an ex
quisitely sculptured monument celebrating one of Naram Sin's victories, which was discovered at Susa. It is one
of the most wonderful examples of Babylonian stone work which has come to light.
A successful campaign had been waged against a
mountain people. The stele shows the warrior king
leading his army up a steep incline and round the base of a great peak surmounted by stars. His enemies flee
in confusion before him. One lies on the ground clutch
ing a spear which has penetrated his throat, two are
falling over a cliff, while others apparently sue for mercy. Trees have been depicted to show that part of the conquered territory is wooded. Naram Sin is armed with battleaxe and bow, and his helmet is decorated with horns.
The whole composition is spirited and finely grouped;
and the military bearing of the disciplined troops contrasts
sharply with the despairing attitudes of the fleeing
remnants of the defending army. During this period the Semitized mountaineers to the
north-east of Babylonia became the most aggressive op
ponents of the city states. The two most prominent
were the Gutium, or men of Kutu, and the Lulubu.
1 Or Rimush.

WARS OF CITY STATES 129
Naram Sin's great empire included the whole of
Sumer and Akkad, Amurru and northern Palestine, and
part of Elam, and the district to the north. He also
penetrated Arabia, probably by way of the Persian Gulf,
and caused diorite to be quarried there. One of his
steles, which is now in the Imperial Ottoman Museum
at Constantinople, depicts him as a fully bearded man with Semitic characteristics. During his lifetime he was
deified a clear indication of the introduction of foreign
ideas, for the Sumerians were not worshippers of kings
and ancestors.
Naram Sin was the last great king of his line. Soon
after his death the power of Akkad went to pieces, and the Sumerian city of Erech again became the centre of
empire. Its triumph, however, was shortlived. After
a quarter of a century had elapsed, Akkad and Sumer were overswept by the fierce Gutium from the northeastern mountains. They sacked and burned many cities,
including Babylon, where the memory of the horrors perpetrated by these invaders endured until the Grecian Age.
An obscure period, like the Egyptian Hyksos Age,
ensued, but it was of comparatively brief duration.
When the mists cleared away, the city Lagash once
more came to the front, having evidently successfully withstood the onslaughts of the Gutium, but it never recovered the place of eminence it occupied under the
brilliant Ur-Nina dynasty. It is manifest that it must
have enjoyed under the various overlords, during the
interval, a considerable degree of independence, for its
individuality remained unimpaired. Of all its energetic and capable patesis, the most celebrated was Gudea, who reigned sometime before 2400 B.C. In contrast to the
Semitic Naram Sin, he was beardless and pronouncedly
Sumerian in aspect. His favoured deity, the city god



1 30 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
Nin-Girsu, again became prominent, having triumphed
over his jealous rivals after remaining in obscurity for three or four centuries. Trade flourished, and the arts were fostered. Gudea had himself depicted, in one of
the most characteristic sculptures of his age, as an archi
tect, seated reverently with folded hands with a temple
plan lying on his knees, and his head uplifted as if
watching the builders engaged in materializing the dream
of his life. The temple in which his interests were centred
was erected in honour of Nin-Girsu. Its ruins suggest
that it was of elaborate structure and great beauty. Like
Solomon in later days, Gudea procured material for his
temple from many distant parts cedar from Lebanon, marble from Amurru, diorite from Arabia, copper from
Elam, and so forth. Apparently the King of Lagash was
strong enough or wealthy enough to command respect over a wide area.
Another city which also rose into prominence, amidst
the shattered Sumerian states, was Ur, the centre of moon
worship. After Gudea's death, its kings exercised sway
over Lagash and Nippur, and, farther south, over Erech and Larsa as well. This dynasty endured for nearly a
hundred and twenty years, during which Ur flourished like Thebes in Egypt. Its monarchs styled themselves
as " Kings of the Four Regions ". The worship of
Nannar (Sin) became officially recognized at Nippur, the seat of Enlil, during the reign of King Dungi of Ur; while at Erech, the high priest of Anu, the sky god,
became the high priest of the moon god. Apparently matriarchal ideas, associated with lunar worship, again
came into prominence, for the king appointed two of
his daughters to be rulers of conquered states in Elam
and Syria. In the latter half of his reign, Dungi, the
conqueror, was installed as high priest at Eridu. It



STATUE OF GUDEA
(Louvre, Paris]






WARS OF CITY STATES 131
would thus appear that there was a renascence of early
Sumerian religious ideas. Ea, the god of the deep, had
long been overshadowed, but a few years before Dungi's death a temple was erected to him at Nippur, where he
was worshipped as Dagan. Until the very close of his
reign, which lasted for fifty-eight years, this great monarch of tireless activity waged wars of conquest, built temples and palaces, and developed the natural resources of Sumer and Akkad. Among his many reforms was the introduction of standards of weights, which received divine
sanction from the moon god, who, as in Egypt, was the
measurer and regulator of human transactions and human
life.
To this age also belongs many of the Sumerian
business and legal records, which were ultimately carried off to Susa, where they have been recovered by French
excavators.
About half a century after Dungi's death the Dynasty
of Ur came to an end, its last king having been captured by an Elamite force.
At some time subsequent to this period, Abraham
migrated from Ur to the northern city of Harran, where
the moon god was also the chief city deity the Baal, or
" lord ". It is believed by certain Egyptologists that
Abraham sojourned in Egypt during its Twelfth Dynasty,
which, according to the Berlin system of minimum dating,
extended from about 2000 B.C. till 1780 B.C. The Hebrew
patriarch may therefore have been a contemporary of
Hammurabi's, who is identified with Amraphel, king of Shinar (Sumer) in the Bible.1
But after the decline of Ur's ascendancy, and long
before Babylon's great monarch came to the throne, the centre of power in Sumeria was shifted to Isin, where
1 Genesis, xiv.



1 32 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
sixteen kings flourished for two and a quarter centuries.
Among the royal names, recognition was given to Ea and Dagan, Sin, Enlil, and Ishtar, indicating that Sumerian
religion in its Semitized form was receiving general re
cognition. The sun god was identical with Ninip and
Nin-Girsu, a god of fertility, harvest, and war, but now
more fully developed and resembling Babbar, "the shining one ", the solar deity of Akkadian Sippar, whose Semitic name was Shamash. As Shamash was ultimately de
veloped as the god of justice and righteousness, it would appear that his ascendancy occurred during the period
when well - governed communities systematized their
religious beliefs to reflect social conditions.
The first great monarch of the Isin dynasty was Ishbi
Urra, who reigned for thirty-two years. Like his suc
cessors, he called himself " King of Sumer and Akkad ",
and it appears that his sway extended to the city of Sippar,
where solar worship prevailed. Traces of him have also
been found at Eridu, Ur, Erech, and Nippur, so that he
must have given recognition to Ea, Sin, Anu, and Enlil. In this period the early national pantheon may have taken
shape, Bel Enlil being the chief deity. Enlil was after
wards displaced by Merodach of Babylon. Before 2200 B.C. there occurred a break in the su
premacy of Isin. Gungunu, King of Ur, combined with Larsa, whose sun temple he restored, and declared him
self ruler of Sumer and Akkad. But Isin again gathered
strength under Ur-Ninip, who was not related to his
predecessor. Perhaps he came from Nippur, where the god Ninip was worshipped as the son of Bel Enlil.
According to a Babylonian document, a royal grandson of Ur-Ninip's, having no direct heir, selected as his
successor his gardener, Enlil-bani. He placed the crown
on the head of this obscure individual, abdicated in his



WARS OF CITY STATES 133
favour, and then died a mysterious death within his
palace.
It is highly probable that Enlil-bani, whose name
signifies "Enlil is my creator ", was a usurper like Sargon of Akkad, and he may have similarly circulated a myth regarding his miraculous origin to justify his sudden rise
to power. The truth appears to be that he came to the
throne as the leader of a palace revolution at a time of great unrest. But he was not allowed to remain in un
disputed possession. A rival named Sin-ikisha, evidently
a moon worshipper and perhaps connected with Ur, dis
placed the usurper, and proclaimed himself king. After a brief reign of six months he was overthrown, however,
by Enlil-bani, who piously credited his triumph over his enemy to the chief god of Nippur, whose name he bore.
Although he took steps to secure his position by strengthening the fortifications of Isin, and reigned for about a
quarter of a century, he was not succeeded by his heir, if
he had one. King Zambia, who was no relation, followed
him, but his reign lasted for only three years. The names of the next two kings are unknown. Then came
Sin-magir, who was succeeded by Damik-ilishu, the last King of Isin.
Towards the close of Damik-ilishu's reign of twenty
four years he came under the suzerainty of Larsa, whose
ruler was Rim Sin. Then Isin was captured by Sin
muballit, King of Babylon, the father of the great Ham
murabi. Rim Sin was an Elamite.
Afterwards the old order of things passed away. Baby
lon became the metropolis, the names of Sumer and Akkad dropped out of use, and the whole country between the
rivers was called Babylonia. 1 The various systems of
1 That ia, the equivalent of Babylonia. During the Kassite period the name was Karduniash.



134 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
law which obtained in the different states were then codi
fied by Hammurabi, who appointed governors in all the
cities which came under his sway to displace the patesis
and kings. A new national pantheon of representative character was also formed, over which Merodach (Mar
duk), the city god of Babylon, presided. How this younger deity was supposed to rise to power is related in the Babylonian legend of Creation, which is dealt with in the next chapter.
1 In framing this myth from the fragments of older myths, divine sanction was given to the
supremacy achieved by Merodach's city. The allegiance of future generations was thus secured, not only by the strong arm of the law, but also by the combined influence
of the reorganized priesthoods at the various centres of
administration.
An interesting problem, which should be referred to
here, arises in connection with the sculptured represen
tations of deities before and after the rise of Akkad as
a great Power. It is found, although the Sumerians
shaved their scalps and faces at the dawn of the historical
age, that they worshipped gods who had long hair and also beards, which were sometimes square and sometimes
pointed.
At what period the Sumerian deities were given human shape it is impossible to determine. As has been shown
(Chapters II and III) all the chief gods and goddesses had animal forms and composite monster forms before
they became anthropomorphic deities. Ea had evidently a fish shape ere he was clad in the skin of a fish, as an
Egyptian god was simply a bull before he was depicted
in human shape wearing a bull's skin. The archaic Su
merian animal and composite monster gods of animistic
1 The narrative follows The Seven Tablets of Creation and other fragments, while the account given by Berosua is also drawn upon.



WARS OF CITY STATES 135
and totemic origin survived after the anthropomorphic
period as mythical figures, which were used for decorative
or magical purposes and as symbols. A form of divine headdress was a cap enclosed in horns, between which
appeared the soaring lion-headed eagle, which symbolized Nin-Girsu. This god had also lion and antelope forms,
which probably figured in lost myths perhaps they were like the animals loved by Ishtar and referred to in the
Gilgamesh epic. Similarly the winged bull was associated
with the moon god Nannar, or Sin, of Ur, who was " a
horned steer ". On various cylinder seals appear groups of composite monsters and rearing wild beasts, which were
evidently representations of gods and demons in conflict. Suggestive data for comparative study is afforded in this connection by ancient Egypt. Sokar, the primitive
Memphite deity, retained until the end his animal and
composite monster forms. Other gods were depicted
with human bodies and the heads of birds, serpents,
and crocodiles, thus forming links between the archaic
demoniac and the later anthropomorphic deities. A
Sumerian example is the deified Ea-bani, who, like
Pan, has the legs and hoofs of a goat.
The earliest representations of Sumerian humanized
deities appear on reliefs from Tello, the site of Lagash.
These examples of archaic gods, however, are not bearded
in Semitic fashion. On the contrary, their lips and
cheeks are shaved, while an exaggerated chin tuft is re
tained. The explanation suggested is that the Sumerians
gave their deities human shape before they themselves
were clean shaven, and that the retention of the charac
teristic facial hair growth of the Mediterranean Race is
another example of the conservatism of the religious
instinct. In Egypt the clean-shaven Pharaohs, who re
presented gods, wore false chin-tuft beards; even Queen



1 36 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
Hatshepsut considered it necessary to assume a beard on state occasions. Ptah-Osiris retained his archaic beard
until the Ptolemaic period.
It seems highly probable that in similarly depicting their gods with beards, the early Sumerians were not
influenced by the practices of any alien people or peoples.
Not until the period of Gudea, the Patesi of Lagash, did
they give their gods heavy moustaches, side whiskers, and flowing beards of Semitic type. It may be, how
ever, that by then they had completely forgotten the significance of an ancient custom. Possibly, too, the sculptors of Lagash were working under the influence of the Akkadian school of art, which had produced the
exquisite stele of victory for Naram-Sin, and consequently adopted the conventional Semitic treatment of bearded
figures. At any rate, they were more likely to study and follow the artistic triumphs of Akkad than the crude
productions of the archaic period. Besides, they lived in an age when Semitic kings were deified and the
Semitic overlords had attained to great distinction and
influence.
The Semitic folks were not so highly thought of in
the early Sumerian period. It is not likely that the agri
cultural people regarded as models of gods the plunderers
who descended from the hills, and, after achieving suc
cesses, returned home with their spoils. More probably
they regarded them as " foreign devils ". Other Semites,
however, who came as traders, bringing wood, stone, and especially copper, and formed communities in cities, may
well have influenced Sumerian religious thought. The
god Ramman, for instance, who was given recognition all through Babylonia, was a god of hill folks as far
north as Asia Minor and throughout Syria. He may have been introduced by settlers who adopted Sumerian



WARS OF CITY STATES 137
habits of life and shaved scalp and face. But although
the old cities could never have existed in a complete state
of isolation from the outer world, it is unlikely that their
inhabitants modelled their deities on those worshipped by
groups of aliens. A severe strain is imposed on our
credulity if we are expected to believe that it was due
to the teachings and example of uncultured nomads that
the highly civilized Sumerians developed their gods from
composite monsters to anthropomorphic deities. Such
a supposition, at any rate, is not supported by the evidence of Ancient Egypt

IN the beginning the whole universe was a sea. Heaven on high had not been named, nor the earth beneath. Their begetter was Apsu, the father of the prim
ordial Deep, and their mother was Tiamat, the spirit of
Chaos. No plain was yet formed, no marsh could be
seen; the gods had no existence, nor had their fates been
determined. Then there was a movement in the waters,
and the deities issued forth. The first who had being
were the god Lachmu and the goddess Lachamu. Long
ages went past. Then were created the god Anshar and
the goddess Kishar. When the days of these deities had
increased and extended, they were followed by Anu, god of the sky, whose consort was Anatu; and Ea, most wise
and all-powerful, who was without an equal. Now Ea,
god of the deep, was also Enki, " lord of earth ", and
138

CREATION LEGEND 139
his eternal spouse, Damkina, was Gashan-ki, "lady of
earth ". The son of Ea and Damkina was Bel, the lord, who in time created mankind. 1 Thus were the high gods
established in power and in glory.
Now Apsu and Tiamat remained amidst confusion in
the deeps of chaos. They were troubled because their
offspring, the high gods, aspired to control the universe and set it in order.2 Apsu was still powerful and fierce,
and Tiamat snarled and raised tempests, smiting herself. Their purpose was to work evil amidst eternal confusion.
Then Apsu called upon Mummu, his counsellor, the
son who shared his desires, and said, " O Mummu, thou
who art pleasing unto me, let us go forth together unto Tiamat and speak with her." So the two went forth and prostrated themselves before the Chaos Mother to consult with her as to what
should be done to prevent the accomplishment of the
purpose of the high gods.
Apsu opened his mouth and spake, saying, " O Tiamat, thou gleaming one, the purpose of the gods troubles me.
I cannot rest by day nor can I repose by night. I will
thwart them and destroy their purpose. I will bring
sorrow and mourning so that we may lie down undisturbed by them." Tiamat heard these words and snarled. She raised
angry and roaring tempests ; in her furious grief she
uttered a curse, and then spake to Apsu, saying, "What
shall we do so that their purpose may be thwarted and
we may lie down undisturbed again?"
Mummu, the counsellor, addressing Apsu, made
answer, and said, " Although the gods are powerful, thou

1 40 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
canst overcome them ; although their purpose is strong,
thou canst thwart it. Then thou shalt have rest by day
and peace by night to lie down."
The face of Apsu grew bright when he heard these words spoken by Mummu, yet he trembled to think of
the purpose of the high gods, to whom he was hostile.
With Tiamat he lamented because the gods had changed
all things ; the plans of the gods filled their hearts with
dread ; they sorrowed and spake with Mummu, plotting
evil.
Then Ea, who knoweth all, drew near ; he beheld the
evil ones conspiring and muttering together. He uttered a pure incantation and accomplished the downfall of Apsu
and Mummu, who were taken captive.
1
Kingu, who shared the desires of Tiamat, spake unto
her words of counsel, saying, " Apsu and Mummu have
been overcome and we cannot repose. Thou shalt be
their Avenger, O Tempestuous One." Tiamat heard the words of this bright and evil god,
and made answer, saying, " On my strength thou canst trust. So let war be waged." Then were the hosts of chaos and the deep gathered
together. By day and by night they plotted against the
high gods, raging furiously, making ready for battle, fuming and storming and taking no rest.
Mother Chuber,2 the creator of all, provided irresistible
weapons. She also brought into being eleven kinds of
fierce monsters giant serpents, sharp of tooth with unsparing fangs, whose bodies were filled with poison instead
of blood ; snarling dragons, clad with terror, and of such
lofty stature that whoever saw them was overwhelmed
with fear, nor could any escape their attack when they

hurricane monsters, raging hounds, scorpion men, tempest furies, fish men, and mountain rams. These she armed with fierce weapons and they had no fear of war.
Then Tiamat, whose commands are unchangeable and
mighty, exalted Kingu, who had come to her aid, above
all the evil gods ; she made him the leader to direct the
army in battle, to go in front, to open the attack. Rob
ing Kingu in splendour, she seated him on high and spoke,
saying :
" I have established thy command over all the gods.
Thou shalt rule over them. Be mighty, thou my chosen
husband, and let thy name be exalted over all the spirits
of heaven and spirits of earth. " Unto Kingu did Tiamat deliver the tablets of fate ;
she laid them in his bosom, and said, "Thy commands cannot be changed; thy words shall remain firm." Thus was Kingu exalted ; he was vested with the
divine power of Anu to decree the fate of the gods,
saying, " Let thy mouth open to thwart the fire god ;
be mighty in battle nor brook resistance."
Then had Ea knowledge of Tiamat's doings, how she
had gathered her forces together, and how she had pre
pared to work evil against the high gods with purpose to
avenge Apsu. The wise god was stricken with grief, and he moaned for many days. Thereafter he went and
stood before his father, Anshar, and spake, saying, " Our mother, Tiamat, hath turned against us in her wrath. She hath gathered the gods about her, and those thou
didst create are with her also."
When Anshar heard all that Ea revealed regarding
the preparations made by Tiamat, he smote his loins and clenched his teeth, and was ill at ease. In sorrow and
anger he spoke and said, "Thou didst go forth afore



1 42 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
time to battle; thou didst bind Mummu and smite Apsu.
Now Kingu is exalted, and there is none who can oppose Tiamat." l
Anshar called his son, Ami, before him, and spoke,
saying: "O mighty one without fear, whose attack is
irresistible, go now before Tiamat and speak so that her
anger may subside and her heart be made merciful. But
if she will not hearken unto thee, speak thou for me, so
that she may be reconciled.'*
Anu was obedient to the commands of Anshar. He
departed, and descended by the path of Tiamat until he
beheld her fuming and snarling, but he feared to approach her, and turned back. Then Ea was sent forth, but he was stricken with terror and turned back also. 2
Anshar then called upon Merodach, son of Ea, and
addressed him, saying, " My son, who softeneth my heart,
thou shalt go forth to battle and none shall stand against
thee." The heart of Merodach was made glad at these words.
He stood before Anshar, who kissed him, because that he
banished fear. Merodach spake, saying : " O lord of the
gods, withdraw not thy words; let me go forth to do as
is thy desire. What man hath challenged thee to battle?"
Anshar made answer and said: "No man hath
challenged me. It is Tiamat, the woman, who hath
resolved to wage war against us. But fear not and make
merry, for thou shalt bruise the head of Tiamat. O wise
god, thou shalt overcome her with thy pure incantation.
Tarry not but hasten forth; she cannot wound thee; thou
shalt come back again."
1 There is another gap here which interrupts the narrative. 3 This may refer to Ea's first visit when he overcame Kingu, but did not attack Tiamat.



CREATION LEGEND 143
The words of Anshar delighted the heart of Merodach,
who spake, saying: "O lord of the gods, O fate of the
high gods, if I, the avenger, am to subdue Tiamat and
save all, then proclaim my greatness among the gods.
Let all the high gods gather together joyfully in Upshukinaku (the Council Hall), so that my words like thine
may remain unchanged, and what I do may never be altered. Instead of thee I will decree the fates of the
gods.'* Then Anshar called unto his counsellor, Gaga, and
addressing him, said: " O thou who dost share my de
sires, thou who dost understand the purpose of my heart,
go unto Lachmu and Lachamu and summon all the high
gods to come before me to eat bread and drink wine.
Repeat to them all I tell you of Tiamat's preparations
for war, of my commands to Anu and Ea, who turned
back, fearing the dragon, of my choice of Merodach to
be our avenger, and his desire to be equipped with my
power to decree fate, so that he may be made strong to
combat against our enemy." As Anshar commanded so did Gaga do. Fie went
unto Lachmu and Lachamu and prostrated himself humbly
before them. Then he rose and delivered the message
of Anshar, their son, adding: "Hasten and speedily decide for Merodach your fate. Permit him to depart to meet
your powerful foe."
When Lachmu and Lachamu heard all that Gaga revealed unto them they uttered lamentations, while the
Igigi (heavenly spirits) sorrowed bitterly, and said:
"What change hath happened that Tiamat hath become
hostile to her own offspring? We cannot understand her deeds." All the high gods then arose and went unto Anshar. They filled his council chamber and kissed one another.



i 44 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
Then they sat down to eat bread and drink sesame wine.
And when they were made drunk and were merry and at
their ease, they decreed the fate for Merodach. In the chamber of Anshar they honoured the Avenger.
He was exalted as a prince over them all, and they said:
"Among the high gods thou art the highest; thy com
mand is the command of Anu. Henceforth thou wilt
have power to raise up and to cast down. None of the
gods will dispute thy authority. O Merodach, our avenger, we give thee sovereignty over the entire Universe. Thy weapon will ever be irresistible. Smite
down the gods who have raised revolt, but spare the
lives of those who repose their trust in thee/'
Then the gods laid down a garment before Merodach,
saying: "Open thy mouth and speak words of command, so that the garment may be destroyed; speak again and it will be brought back." Merodach spake with his mouth and the garment
vanished ; he spake again and the garment was reproduced.
All the gods rejoiced, and they prostrated themselves
and cried out, " Merodach is King !
"
Thereafter they gave him the sceptre and the throne
and the insignia of royalty, and also an irresistible weapon x
with which to overcome his enemies, saying: "Now, O Merodach, hasten and slay Tiamat. Let the winds carry her blood to hidden places." So was the fate of Merodach decreed by the gods ; so
was a path of prosperity and peace prepared for him. He
made ready for battle ; he strung his bow and hung his
quiver; he slung a dart over his shoulder, and he grasped a club in his right hand; before him he set lightning, and
with flaming fire he filled his body. Anu gave unco him
1 The lightning trident or thunderstone.

CREATION LEGEND 145
a great net with which to snare his enemies and prevent their escape. Then Merodach created seven winds the
wind of evil, the uncontrollable wind, the sandstorm, and
the whirlwind, the fourfold wind, the sevenfold wind, and
the wind that has no equal and they went after him.
Next he seized his mighty weapon, the thunderstone, and leapt into his storm chariot, to which were yoked four
rushing and destructive steeds of rapid flight, with foam
flecked mouths and teeth full of venom, trained for battle,
to overthrow enemies and trample them underfoot. A light burned on the head of Merodach, and he was clad
in a robe of terror. He drove forth, and the gods, his fathers, followed after him : the high gods clustered
around and followed him, hastening to battle. Merodach drove on, and at length he drew nigh to
the secret lair of Tiamat, and he beheld her muttering
with Kingu, her consort. For a moment he faltered, and
when the gods who followed him beheld this, their eyes
were troubled. Tiamat snarled nor turned her head. She uttered
curses, and said: "O Merodach, I fear not thy advance
as chief of the gods. My allies are assembled here, and
are more powerful than thou art."
Merodach uplifted his arm, grasping the dreaded
thunderstone, and spake unto Tiamat, the rebellious one,
saying: "Thou hast exalted thyself, and with wrathful
heart hath prepared for war against the high gods and
their fathers, whom thou dost hate in thy heart of evil.
Unto Kingu thou hast given the power of Anu to decree
fate, because thou art hostile to what is good and loveth
what is sinful. Gather thy forces together, and arm
thyself and come forth to battle."
When Tiamat heard these mighty words she raved
and cried aloud like one who is possessed ; all her limbs



146 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
shook, and she muttered a spell. The gods seized their
weapons. Tiamat and Merodach advanced to combat against
one another. They made ready for battle. The lord of
the high gods spread out the net which Anu had given
him. He snared the dragon and she could not escape. Tiamat opened her mouth which was seven miles wide, and Merodach called upon the evil wind to smite her ;
he caused the wind to keep her mouth agape so that she could not close it. All the tempests and the hurricanes
entered in, filling her body, and her heart grew weak ;
she gasped, overpowered. Then the lord of the high gods seized his dart and cast it through the lower part of
her body; it tore her inward parts and severed her heart. So was Tiamat slain. Merodach overturned the body of the dead dragon
and stood upon it. All the evil gods who had followed
her were stricken with terror and broke into flight. But they were unable to escape. Merodach caught them in
his great net, and they stumbled and fell uttering cries of distress, and the whole world resounded with their wailing
and lamentations. The lord of the high gods broke the
weapons of the evil gods and put them in bondage.
Then he fell upon the monsters which Tiamat had created;
he subdued them, divested them of their powers, and trampled them under his feet. Kingu he seized with the
others. From this god great Merodach took the tablets
of fate, and impressing upon them his own seal, placed them in his bosom. So were the enemies of the high gods overthrown by
the Avenger. Ansar's commands were fulfilled and the
desires of Ea fully accomplished. Merodach strengthened the bonds which he had laid
upon the evil gods and then returned to Tiamat. He



CREATION LEGEND 147
leapt upon the dragon's body ; he clove her skull with his great club ; he opened the channels of her blood which streamed forth, and caused the north to carry her
blood to hidden places. The high gods, his fathers, clustered around ; they raised shouts of triumph and
made merry. Then they brought gifts and offerings to
the great Avenger. Merodach rested a while, gazing upon the dead body
of the dragon. He divided the flesh of Ku-pu,1 and
devised a cunning plan.
Then the lord of the high gods split the body of
the dragon like that of a mashde fish into two halves.
With one half he enveloped the firmament; he fixed it there and set a watchman to prevent the waters falling
down.2 With the other half he made the earth.3 Then he made the abode of Ea in the deep, and the abode
of Anu in high heaven. The abode of Enlil was in
the air.
Merodach set all the great gods in their several
stations. He also created their images, the stars of
the Zodiac, and fixed them all. He measured the year and divided it into months; for twelve months he made
three stars each. After he had given starry images of
the gods separate control of each day of the year, he
founded the station of Nibiru (Jupiter), his own star,
to determine the limits of all stars, so that none might
err or go astray. He placed beside his own the stations
of Enlil and Ea, and on each side he opened mighty
1 The authorities are not agreed as to the meaning of " Ku-pu ". Jensen suggests "trunk, body". In European dragon stories the heroes of the Siegfried order roast and eat the dragon's heart. Then they are inspired with the dragon's wisdom and cunning. Sigurd and Siegfried immediately acquire the language of birds. The birds are the "Fates", and direct the heroes what next they should do. Apparently Mcrodach's "cunning plan" was inspired after he had eaten a part of the body of Tiamat.

gates, fixing bolts on the left and on the right. He set the zenith in the centre.
Merodach decreed that the moon god should rule the night and measure the days, and each month he
was given a crown. Its various phases the great lord
determined, and he commanded that on the evening of
its fullest brilliancy it should stand opposite the sun. 1
He placed his bow in heaven (as a constellation) and his net also.
We have now reached the sixth tablet, which begins with a reference to words spoken to Merodach by the
gods. Apparently Ea had conceived in his heart that
mankind should be created. The lord of the gods read
his thoughts and said: "I will shed my blood and fashion
bone ... I will create man to dwell on the earth so
that the gods may be worshipped and shrines erected
for them. I will change the pathways of the gods . . .".
The rest of the text is fragmentary, and many lines
are missing. Berosus states, however, that Belus (Bel Merodach) severed his head from his shoulders. His blood flowed forth, and the gods mixed it with earth and
formed the first man and various animals.
In another version of the creation of man, it is related
that Merodach "laid a reed upon the face of the waters;
he formed dust, and poured it out beside the reed. . . .
That he might cause the gods to dwell in the habitation of their heart's desire, he formed mankind/' The god
dess Aruru, a deity of Sippar, and one of the forms of
" the lady of the gods ", is associated with Merodach as the creatrix of the seed of mankind. "The beasts of
the field and living creatures in the field he formed."
1 This portion is fragmentary and seems to indicate that the Babylonians had made considerable progress in the science of astronomy. It is suggested that they knew that
the moon derived its light from the sun.



CREATION LEGEND 149
He also created the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, grass,
reeds, herbs and trees, lands, marshes and swamps, cows,
goats, &C. 1 In the seventh tablet Merodach is praised by the
gods the Igigi (spirits of heaven). As he has absorbed all their attributes, he is addressed by his fifty-one names; henceforth each deity is a form of Merodach. Bel Enlil,
for instance, is Merodach of lordship and domination; Sin, the moon god, is Merodach as ruler of night; Shamash is Merodach as god of law and holiness; Nergal
is Merodach of war; and so on. The tendency to monotheism appears to have been most marked among the
priestly theorists of Babylon. Merodach is hailed to begin with as Asari, the intro
ducer of agriculture and horticulture, the creator of grain
and plants. He also directs the decrees of Anu, Bel,
and Ea; but having rescued the gods from destruction at the hands of Kingu and Tiamat, he was greater than
his " fathers ", the elder gods. He set the Universe
in order, and created all things anew. He is therefore
Tutu, "the creator", a merciful and beneficent god.
The following are renderings of lines 25 to 32:

He who had mercy on the gods who had been overpowered ;

Apparently the Babylonian doctrine set forth that
mankind was created not only to worship the gods, but
also to bring about the redemption of the fallen gods
who followed Tiamat.
Those rebel angels (/'//', gods) He prohibited return;
He stopped their service ; He removed them unto the gods (ill) who were His enemies. In their room he created mankind. 2
Tiamat, the chaos dragon, is the Great Mother. She
has a dual character. As the origin of good she is the
creatrix of the gods. Her beneficent form survived as
the Sumerian goddess Bau, who was obviously identical
with the Phoenician Baau, mother of the first man. An
other name of Bau was Ma, and Nintu, " a form of the
goddess Ma ", was half a woman and half a serpent, and
was depicted with " a babe suckling her breast "
(Chapter IV). The Egyptian goddesses Neheb-kau and Uazit were serpents, and the goddesses Isis and Nepthys had
also serpent forms. The serpent was a symbol of fertility, and as a mother was a protector. Vishnu, the Preserver
of the Hindu Trinity, sleeps on the world-serpent's body. Serpent charms are protective and fertility charms.

As the origin of evil Tiamat personified the deep and tempests. In this character she was the enemy of order
and good, and strove to destroy the world.
I have seen The ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam
To be exalted with the threatening clouds.1
Tiamat was the dragon of the sea, and therefore the
serpent or leviathan. The word "dragon" is derived
from the Greek "drakon", the serpent known as "the
seeing one " or " looking one ", whose glance was the
lightning. The Anglo-Saxon "fire drake" ("draca",
Latin " draco ") is identical with the "flying dragon**.
In various countries the serpent or worm is a destroyer
which swallows the dead. "The worm shall eat them
like wool ", exclaimed Isaiah in symbolic language. 2 It lies in the ocean which surrounds the world in Egyptian,
Babylonian, Greek, Teutonic, Indian, and other mytholo
gies. The Irish call it " moriiach ", and give it a mermaid
form like the Babylonian Nintu. In a Scottish Gaelic
poem Tiamat figures as "The Yellow Muilearteach", who
is slain by Finn-mac-Coul, assisted by his warrior band.
There was seen coming on the top of the waves
The crooked, clamouring, shivering brave . . . Her face was blue black of the lustre of coal, And her bone-tufted tooth was like rusted bone.3
The serpent figures in folk tales. When Alexander
the Great, according to Ethiopic legend, was lowered in a glass cage to the depths of the ocean, he saw a great monster going past, and sat for two days "watch
ing for its tail and hinder parts to appear ".* An

152 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
Argyllshire Highlander had a similar experience. He
went to fish one morning on a rock. " He was not long
there when he saw the head of an eel pass. He con
tinued fishing for an hour and the eel was still passing.
He went home, worked in the field all day, and having returned to the same rock in the evening, the eel was
still passing, and about dusk he saw her tail disappear
ing."
l Tiamat's sea-brood is referred to in the Anglo
Saxon epic Beowulf as " nickers ". The hero " slew by
night sea monsters on the waves (line 422).
The well dragon the French "draco" also recalls the Babylonian water monsters. There was a "dragon
well " near Jerusalem. 2 From China to Ireland rivers
are dragons, or goddesses who flee from the well dragons.
The demon of the Rhone is called the "drac". Floods
are also referred to as dragons, and the Hydra, or water
serpent, slain by Hercules, belongs to this category.
Water was the source of evil as well as good. To the
Sumerians, the ocean especially was the abode of monsters.
They looked upon it as did Shakespeare's Ferdinand,
when, leaping into the sea, he cried : " Hell is empty
and all the devils are here".3
There can be little doubt but that in this Babylonian story of Creation we have a glorified variation of the wide
spread Dragon myth. Unfortunately, however, no trace can be obtained of the pre-existing Sumerian oral version which the theorizing priests infused with such sublime
symbolism. No doubt it enjoyed as great popularity as the immemorial legend of Perseus and Andromeda, which
the sages of Greece attempted to rationalize, and parts of which the poets made use of and developed as these
appealed to their imaginations.
1 Campbell's West Highland Tales. 2 Nehemiah, ii, 13. 9 The Tempest^ i, 2, 212.



CREATION LEGEND 153
The lost Sumerian story may be summarized as follows:
There existed in the savage wilds, or the ocean, a family of
monsters antagonistic to a group of warriors represented in the Creation legend by the gods. Ea, the heroic
king, sets forth to combat with the enemies of man, and
slays the monster father, Apsu, and his son, Mummu. But the most powerful demon remains to be dealt with.
This is the mother Tiamat, who burns to avenge the
deaths of her kindred. To wage war against her the
hero makes elaborate preparations, and equips himself with special weapons. The queen of monsters cannot be
overcome by ordinary means, for she has great cunning, and is less vulnerable than were her husband and son.
Although Ea may work spells against her, she is able to thwart him by working counter spells. Only a hand-to-hand
combat can decide the fray. Being strongly protected by her scaly hide, she must be wounded either on the under
part of her body or through her mouth by a weapon
which will pierce her liver, the seat of life. It will be
noted in this connection that Merodach achieved success by causing the winds which followed him to distend the
monster's jaws, so that he might be able to inflict the
fatal blow and prevent her at the same time from uttering spells to weaken him. This type of story, in which the mother monster is
greater and more powerful than her husband or son, is
exceedingly common in Scottish folklore. In the legend
which relates the adventures of " Finn in the Kingdom
of Big Men", the hero goes forth at night to protect his
allies against the attacks of devastating sea monsters.
Standing on the beach, " he saw the sea advancing in
fiery kilns and as a darting serpent. ... A huge monster came up, and looking down below where he
(Finn) was, exclaimed, What little speck do I see here ?'"



154 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
Finn, aided by his fairy dog, slew the water monster. On
the following night a bigger monster, " the father ", came ashore, and he also was slain. But the most powerful
enemy had yet to be dealt with. " The next night a Big Hag came ashore, and the tooth in the front of her mouth
would make a distaff. c You killed my husband and son/
she said." Finn acknowledged that he did, and they began
to fight. After a prolonged struggle, in which Finn was almost overcome, the Hag fell and her head was cut off. 1
The story of " Finlay the Changeling
" has similar
features. The hero slew first a giant and then the giant's
father. Thereafter the Hag came against him and ex
claimed, "Although with cunning and deceitfulness you killed my husband last night and my son on the night
before last, I shall certainly kill you to-night." A fierce
wrestling match ensued on the bare rock. The Hag was
ultimately thrown down. She then offered various
treasures to ransom her life, including "a gold sword in
my cave", regarding which she says,
<c never was it drawn to man or to beast whom it did not overcome ".2 In
other Scottish stories of like character the hero climbs a
tree, and says something to induce the hag to open her
mouth, so that he may plunge his weapon down her throat.
The Grendel story in Beowulf? the Anglo-Saxon epic,
is of like character. A male water monster preys nightly
upon the warriors who sleep in the great hall of King
Hrothgar. Beowulf comes over the sea, as did Finn
to the " Kingdom of Big Men ", to slay Grendel. He
wrestles with this man-eater and mortally wounds him.
Great rejoicings ensue, but they have to be brought to an abrupt conclusion, because the mother of Grendel has

CREATION LEGEND 155
meanwhile resolved " to go a sorry journey and avenge the death of her son ".
The narrative sets forth that she enters the Hall in
the darkness of night. " Quickly she grasped one of the nobles tight, and then she went towards the fen", towards her submarine cave. Beowulf follows in due
course, and, fully armoured, dives through the waters and ultimately enters the monster's lair. In the combat
the "water wife" proves to be a more terrible opponent than was her son. Indeed, Beowulf was unable to slay
her until he possessed himself of a gigantic sword, "adorned with treasure", which was hanging in the
cave. With this magic weapon he slays the mother monster, whose poisonous blood afterwards melts the
" damasked blade ". Like Finn, he subsequently returns with the head of one of the monsters.
An interesting point about this story is that it does not appear in any form in the North German cycle of
Romance. Indeed, the poet who included in his epic the fiery dragon story, which links the hero Beowulf with
Sigurd and Siegfried, appears to be doubtful about the mother monster's greatness, as if dealing with unfamiliar
material, for he says: "The terror (caused by GrendeFs
mother) was less by just so much as woman's strength,
woman's war terror, is (measured) by fighting men".1
Yet, in the narrative which follows the Amazon is proved to be the stronger monster of the two. Traces of the
mother monster survive in English folklore, especially in the traditions about the mythical "Long Meg of
Westminster ", referred to by Ben Jonson in his masque
of the " Fortunate Isles "
:
Westminster Meg,
With her long leg,
1 Beowulf, translated by Clark Hall, London, 1911, p. 69, lines izSo-nS/. (0642) 13



1 56 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
As long as a crane; And feet like a plane, With a pair of heels As broad as two wheels.
Meg has various graves. One is supposed to be marked
by a huge stone in the south side of the cloisters
of Westminster Abbey; it probably marks the trench
in which some plague victims regarded, perhaps, as victims of Meg were interred. Meg was also reputed
to have been petrified, like certain Greek and Irish giants
and giantesses. At Little Salkeld, near Penrith, a stone
circle is referred to as " Long Meg and her Daughters ".
Like "Long Tom", the famous giant, " Mons Meg"
gave her name to big guns in early times, all hags and giants having been famous in floating folk tales as throwers
of granite boulders, balls of hard clay, quoits, and other gigantic missiles.
The stories about Grendel's mother and Long Meg
ar-e similar to those still repeated in the Scottish High
lands. These contrast sharply with characteristic Ger
manic legends, in which the giant is greater than the
giantess, and the dragon is a male, like Fafner, who is
slain by Sigurd, and Regin whom Siegfried overcomes. It is probable, therefore, that the British stories of female
monsters who were more powerful than their husbands and sons, are of Neolithic and Iberian origin immemorial
relics of the intellectual life of the western branch of the Mediterranean race.
In Egypt the dragon survives in the highly developed mythology of the sun cult of Heliopolis, and, as sun worship is believed to have been imported, and the sun deity
is a male, it is not surprising to find that the night demon,
Apep, was a personification of Set. This god, who is identical with Sutekh, a Syrian and Asia Minor deity, was



CREATION LEGEND 157
apparently worshipped by a tribe which was overcome in
the course of early tribal struggles in pre-dynastic times. Being an old and discredited god, he became by a familiar
process the demon of the conquerors. ^In the eighteenth dynasty, however, his ancient glory was revived, for the
Sutekh of Rameses II figures as the " dragon slayer 'V It is in accordance with Mediterranean modes of thought,
however, to find that in Egypt there is a great celestial
battle heroine. This is the goddess Hathor-Sekhet, the
"Eye of Ra".2 Similarly in India, the post-Vedic goddess Kali is a destroyer, while as Durga she is a guardian of heroes.3 Kali, Durga, and Hathor-Sekhet link with
the classical goddesses of war, and also with the Baby
lonian Ishtar, who, as has been shown, retained the
outstanding characteristics of Tiamat, the fierce old
" Great Mother " of primitive Sumerian folk religion.
It is possible that in the Babylonian dragon myth the
original hero was Ea. As much may be inferred from
the symbolic references in the Bible to Jah's victory over the monster of the deep: "Art thou not it that hath cut
Rahab and wounded the dragon?" 4 "Thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters ; thou brakest the
heads of leviathan in pieces, and gavest him to be meat
to the people inhabiting the wilderness" ;
5 "He divideth
the sea with his power, and by his understanding he
smiteth through the proud (Rahab). By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens: his hand hath formed (or
pierced) the crooked serpent"; 6 "Thou hast broken
Rahab in pieces as one that is slain: thou hast scattered
thine enemies with thy strong arm"; 7 "In that day the

In the Babylonian Creation legend Ea is supplanted as dragon slayer by his son Merodach. Similarly Ninip took the place of his father, Enlil, as the champion of
the gods. "In other words," writes Dr. Langdon, "later
theology evolved the notion of the son of the earth god,
who acquires the attributes of the father, and becomes the
god of war. It is he who stood forth against the rebel
lious monsters of darkness, who would wrest the dominion of the world from the gods who held their conclave on the
mountain. The gods offer him the Tablets of Fate; the
right to utter decrees is given unto him/' This develop
ment is " of extreme importance for studying the growth of the idea of father and son, as creative and active principles
of the world ".2 In Indian mythology Indra similarly
takes the place of his bolt-throwing father Dyaus, the sky god, who so closely resembles Zeus. Andrew Lang has
shown that this myth is of widespread character.8 Were
the Babylonian theorists guided by the folk-lore clue ?
Now Merodach, as the son of Ea whom he consulted
and received spells from, was a brother of " Tammuz of
the Abyss ". It seems that in the great god of Babylon we should recognize one of the many forms of the prime
val corn spirit and patriarch the shepherd youth who
was beloved by Ishtar. As the deity of the spring sun,
Tammuz slew the winter demons of rain and tempest, so
that he was an appropriate spouse for the goddess of harvest and war. Merodach may have been a develop
ment of Tammuz in his character as a demon slayer.

When he was raised to the position of Bel, "the
Lord", by the Babylonian conquerors, Merodach sup
planted the older Bel Enlil of Nippur. Now Enlil, who had absorbed all the attributes of rival deities, and become a world god, was the
Lord of the harvest lands . . . lord of the grain fields,
being "lord of the anunnaki ", or "earth spirits". As
agriculturists in early times went to war so as to secure
prisoners who could be sacrificed to feed the corn spirit, Enlil was a god of war and was adored as such:
The haughty, the hostile land thou dost humiliate . , .
With thee who ventureth to make war ?
He was also " the bull of goring horns . . . Enlil
the bull ", the god of fertility as well as of battle. 1 Asari, one of Merodach's names, links him with
Osiris, the Egyptian Tammuz, who was supplanted by his son Horus. As the dragon slayer, he recalls, among
others, Perseus, the Grecian hero, of whom it was pro
phesied that he would slay his grandfather. Perseus,
like Tammuz and Osiris, was enclosed in a chest which
was cast into the sea, to be rescued, however, by a fisher
man on the island of Seriphos. This hero afterwards
slew Medusa, one of the three terrible sisters, the Gorgons a demon group which links with Tiamat. In
time, Perseus returned home, and while an athletic con
test was in progress, he killed his grandfather with a
quoit. There is no evidence, however, to show that the
displacement of Enlil by Merodach had any legendary
sanction of like character. The god of Babylon absorbed
all other deities, apparently for political purposes, and in accordance with the tendency of the thought of the times,

when raised to supreme rank in the national pantheon;
and he was depicted fighting the winged dragon, flapping
his own storm wings, and carrying the thunder weapon
associated with Ramman.
Merodach's spouse Zer-panitum was significantly
called " the lady of the Abyss
'?
, a title which connects
her with Damkina, the mother, and Belit-sheri, the sister of Tammuz. Damkina was also a sky goddess like Ishtar.
Zer-panitum was no pale reflection of her Celestial
husband, but a goddess of sharply defined character with
independent powers. Apparently she was identical with
Aruru, creatrix of the seed of mankind, who was asso
ciated with Merodach when the first man and the first
woman were brought into being. Originally she was one of the mothers in the primitive spirit group, and so
identical with Ishtar and the other prominent god
desses.
As all goddesses became forms of Ishtar, so did all
gods become forms of Merodach. Sin was " Mero
dach as illuminator of night ", Nergal was " Merodach
of war ", Addu (Ramman) was " Merodach of rain ", and
so on. A colophon which contains a text in which these
identifications are detailed, appears to be " a copy ", says
Professor Pinches, " of an old inscription ", which, he
thinks, " may go back as far as 2000 B.C. This is the
period at which the name Taum -iluy
c jah is god', is found, together with references to ilu as the name for the one
great god, and is also, roughly, the date of Abraham,
who, it may be noted, was a Babylonian of Ur of the
Chaldees." 1 In one of the hymns Merodach is addressed as
follows :

The monotheistic tendency, which was a marked
feature of Merodach worship, had previously become
pronounced in the worship of Bel Enlil of Nippur. Although it did not affect the religion of the masses, it serves to show that among the ancient scholars and
thinkers of Babylonia religious thought had, at an early period, risen far above the crude polytheism of those
who bargained with their deities and propitiated them
with offerings and extravagant flattery, or exercised over them a magical influence by the performance of seasonal
ceremonies, like the backsliders in Jerusalem, censured so severely by Jeremiah, who baked cakes to reward the Queen of Heaven for an abundant harvest, and wept
with her for the slain Tammuz when he departed to Hades. Perhaps it was due to the monotheistic tendency, if
not to the fusion of father-worshipping and mother-wor
shipping peoples, that bi-sexual deities were conceived
of. Nannar, the moon god, was sometimes addressed as

goddess. In Egypt Isis is referred to in a temple chant
as "the woman who was made a male by her father
Osiris", and the Nile god Hapi was depicted as a man with female breasts.

floating legends of antiquity were attached to his memory,
and he became identified with gods and giants and knight
errants "old in story". In Scotland, for instance, the boulder-throwing giant of Eildon hills bears the name of
Wallace, the Edinburgh giant of Arthur's Seat is called
after an ancient Celtic king,
1 and Thomas the Rhymer
takes the place, in an Inverness fairy mound called Tom
na-hurich, of Finn (Fingal) as chief of the " Seven
Sleepers ". Similarly Napoleon sleeps in France and SkobeleflF in Russia, as do also other heroes elsewhere.
In Germany the myths of Thunor (Thor) were mingled
with hazy traditions of Theodoric the Goth (Dietrich), while in Greece, Egypt, and Arabia, Alexander the Great
absorbed a mass of legendary matter of great antiquity, and displaced in the memories of the people the heroes
of other Ages, as those heroes had previously displaced
the humanized spirits of fertility and growth who alter
nately battled fiercely against the demons of spring, made love, gorged and drank deep and went to sleep the sleep of winter. Certain folk tales, and the folk beliefs on which they were based, seem to have been of hoary
antiquity before the close of the Late Stone Age.
There are two great heroes of Babylonian fame who
link with Perseus and Hercules, Sigurd and Siegfried, Dietrich and Finn-mac-Coul. These are Etana and Gil
gamesh, two legendary kings who resemble Tammuz the
Patriarch referred to by Berosus, a form of Tammuz
the Sleeper of the Sumerian psalms. One journeys to
the Nether World to obtain the Plant of Birth and
the other to obtain the Plant of Life. The floating
legends with which they were associated were utilized

bear may have been the " totem " of the Arthur tribe represented by the Scottish clan of MacArthurs.



DEIFIED HEROES 165
and developed by the priests, when engaged in the process
of systematizing and symbolizing religious beliefs, with purpose to unfold the secrets of creation and the Other
world.
Etana secures the assistance of a giant eagle who is an
enemy of serpents like the Indian Garuda, half giant, half
eagle. As Vishnu, the Indian god, rides on the back of
Garuda, so does Etana ride on the back of the Babylonian
Eagle. In one fragmentary legend which was preserved in
the tablet-library of Ashur-banipal, the Assyrian monarch, Etana obtained the assistance of the Eagle to go in quest of the Plant of Birth. His wife was about to become a
mother, and was accordingly in need of magical aid. A similar belief caused birth girdles of straw or serpent
skins, and eagle stones found in eagles' nests, to be used in ancient Britain and elsewhere throughout Europe
apparently from the earliest times.1
On this or another occasion Etana desired to ascend
to highest heaven. He asked the Eagle to assist him, and
the bird assented, saying: "Be glad, my friend. Let me bear thee to the highest heaven. Lay thy breast on mine
and thine arms on my wings, and let my body be as thy
body." Etana did as the great bird requested him, and together they ascended towards the firmament. After a flight which extended over two hours, the Eagle asked
Etana to gaze downwards. He did so, and beheld the
ocean surrounding the earth, and the earth seemed like a
mountainous island. The Eagle resumed its flight, and when another two hours had elapsed, it again asked Etana to look downwards. Then the hero saw that the sea
resembled a girdle which clasped the land. Two hours later Etana found that he had been raised to a height

1 66 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
from which the sea appeared to be no larger than a pond. By this time he had reached the heaven of Arm, Bel, and
Ea, and found there rest and shelter. Here the text becomes fragmentary. Further on it is
gathered from the narrative that Etana is being carried
still higher by the Eagle towards the heaven of Ishtar,
"Queen of Heaven ", the supreme mother goddess.
Three times, at intervals of two hours, the Eagle asks Etana to look downwards towards the shrinking earth.
Then some disaster happens, for further onwards the
broken tablet narrates that the Eagle is falling. Down
and down eagle and man fall together until they strike
the earth, and the Eagle's body is shattered.
The Indian Garuda eagle
1 never met with such a fate,
but on one occasion Vishnu overpowered it with his right
arm, which was heavier than the whole universe, and
caused many feathers to fall off. In the story of Rama's
wanderings, however, as told in the RdmAyana and the
Mahdbhdrata, there are interesting references in this connection to Garuda's two "sons". One was mortally
wounded by Ravana, the demon king of Ceylon. The
other bird related to Rama, who found it disabled: "Once
upon a time we two (brothers), with the desire of out
stripping each other, flew towards the sun. My wings
were burnt, but those of my brother were not. ... I
fell down on the top of this great mountain, where I still am." 2
Another version of the Etana story survives among
the Arabian Moslems. In the "Al Fatihat" chapter of
the Koran it is related that a Babylonian king held a
dispute with Abraham "concerning his Lord". Com
1 Like the Etana " mother eagle " Garuda was a slayer of serpents (Chapter III).

mentators identify the monarch with Nimrod, who afterwards caused the Hebrew patriarch to be cast into a fire from which he had miraculous deliverance. Nimrod then built a tower so as to ascend to heaven "to see Abraham's god", and make war against Him, but the tower was
overthrown. He, however, persisted in his design. The
narrative states that he was " carried to heaven in a chest
borne by four monstrous birds; but after wandering for
some time through the air, he fell down on a mountain
with such a force that he made it shake". A reference in the Koran to " contrivances . . . which make mountains
tremble " is believed to allude to Nimrod's vain attempt. 1 Alexander the Great was also reputed to have ascended
on the back of an eagle. Among the myths attached to
his memory in the Ethiopic " history
" is one which explains
how " he knew and comprehended the length and breadth
of the earth", and how he obtained knowledge regarding
the seas and mountains he would have to cross. " He
made himself small and flew through the air on an eagle,
arid he arrived in the heights of the heavens and he explored them." Another Alexandrian version of the Etana myth resembles the Arabic legend of Nimrod. "In the Country of Darkness" Alexander fed and tamed
great birds which were larger than eagles. Then he ordered four of his soldiers to mount them. The men
were carried to the "Country of the Living", and when
they returned they told Alexander "all that had happened and all that they had seen". 2
In a Gaelic story a hero is carried off by a Cro
mhineach, "avast bird like an eagle". He tells that it
" sprang to the clouds with me, and I was a while that 1

1 68 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
did not know which was heaven or earth for me". The
hero died, but, curiously enough, remained conscious of
what was happening. Apparently exhausted, the eagle flew to an island in the midst of the ocean. It laid the
hero on the sunny side. The hero proceeds: "Sleep
came upon herself (the eagle) and she slept. The sun
was enlivening me pretty well though I was dead." Afterwards the eagle bathed in a healing well, and as it
splashed in the water, drops fell on the hero and he came
to life. " I grew stronger and more active ", he adds, "than I had ever been before. 1 ' 1
The eagle figures in various mythologies, and appears to have been at one time worshipped as the god or god
dess of fertility, and storm and lightning, as the bringer of children, and the deity who carried souls to Hades. It
was also the symbol of royalty, because the earthly ruler
represented the controlling deity. Nin-Girsu, the god of
Lagash, who was identified with Tammuz, was depicted
as a lion-headed eagle. Zeus, the Greek sky and air god, was attended by an eagle, and may, at one time, have been
simply an eagle. In Egypt the place of the eagle is taken
by Nekhebit, the vulture goddess whom the Greeks iden
tified with " Eileithyia, the goddess of birth ; she was
usually represented as a vulture hovering over the king".2 The double-headed eagle of the Hittites, which figures
in the royal arms of Germany and Russia, appears to have
symbolized the deity of whom the king was an incarna
tion or son. In Indian mythology Garuda, the eagle
giant, which destroyed serpents like the Babylonian Etana eagle, issued from its egg like a flame of fire; its eyes
flashed the lightning and its voice was the thunder. This
bird is identified in a hymn with Agni, god of fire, who
1 Campbell's West Highland Tales, vol. iii, pp. 251-4 (1892 ed.). * Religion of the Ancient Egyptians, A. Wicdcmann, p. 141.



DEIFIED HEROES 169
has the attributes of Tammuz and Mithra, with Brahma,
the creator, with Indra, god of thunder and fertility, and
with Yama, god of the dead, who carries off souls to
Hades. It is also called "the steed-necked incarnation of Vishnu", the "Preserver" of the Hindu trinity who rode on its back. The hymn referred to lauds Garuda
as " the bird of life, the presiding spirit of the animate
and inanimate universe . . . destroyer of all, creator of
all". It burns all "as the sun in his anger burneth all
creatures". 1 Birds were not only fates, from whose movements in
flight omens were drawn, but also spirits of fertility.
When the childless Indian sage Mandapala of the fMahdibhdrata was refused admittance to heaven until a son was
born to him, he "pondered deeply" and "came to know that of all creatures birds alone were blest with fecundity ";
so he became a bird.
It is of interest, therefore, to find the Etana eagle
figuring as a symbol of royalty at Rome. The deified
Roman Emperor's waxen image was burned on a pyre
after his death, and an eagle was let loose from the great
pile to carry his soul to heaven.2 This custom was prob
ably a relic of seasonal fire worship, which may have
been introduced into Northern and Western Syria and
Asia Minor by the mysterious Mitanni rulers, if it was
not an archaic Babylonian custom 3 associated with fire
and-water magical ceremonies, represented in the British
Isles by May-Day and Midsummer fire-and-water festivals.

Adonis, The burning of straw figures, representing gods of fertility, on May-Day bonfires may have been a fer
tility rite, and perhaps explains the use of straw birth
girdles. According to the commentators of the Koran^ Nimrod,
the Babylonian king, who cast victims in his annual bon
fires at Cuthah, died on the eighth day of the Tammuz
month, which, according to the Syrian calendar, fell on 1 3th July. 2 It is related that gnats entered Nimrod's
brain, causing the membrane to grow larger. He suffered great pain, and to relieve it had his head beaten with a
mallet. Although he lived for several hundred years,
like other agricultural patriarchs, including the Tammuz of Berosus, it is possible that he was ultimately sacrificed and burned. The beating of Nimrod recalls the beating
of the corn spirit of the agricultural legend utilized by Burns in his ballad of "John Barleycorn'*, which gives a
jocular account of widespread ancient customs that are
not yet quite extinct even in Scotland: 3
They laid him down upon his back
And cudgelled him full sore ; They hung him up before a storm
And turned him o'er and o'er.
They filled up a darksome pit
With water to the brim,

The marrow of his bones, But the miller used him worst of all, For he crushed him between two stones.
Hercules, after performing many mythical exploits, had himself burned alive on the pyre which he built upon
Mount CEta, and was borne to Olympus amidst peals of thunder.
Gilgamesh, the Babylonian Hercules, who links with Etana, Nimrod, and Sandan, is associated with the eagle, which in India, as has been shown, was identified with
the gods of fertility, fire, and death. According to a
legend related by ^Elian,1 " the guards of the citadel of
Babylon threw down to the ground a child who had been
conceived and brought forth in secret, and who afterwards
became known as Gilgamos". This appears to be another version of the Sargon-Tammuz myth, and may also refer
to the sacrifice of children to Melkarth and Moloch, who were burned or slain "in the valleys under the clifts of
the rocks " 2 to ensure fertility and feed the corn god.
Gilgamesh, however, did not perish. "A keen -eyed eagle saw the child falling, and before it touched the
ground the bird flew under it and received it on its back,
and carried it away to a garden and laid it down gently."
Here we have, it would appear, Tammuz among the
flowers, and Sargon, the gardener, in the "Garden of Adonis". Mimic Adonis gardens were cultivated by
women. Corn, &c., was forced in pots and baskets, and
thrown, with an image of the god, into streams. " Igno

MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
make rain, by lighting a fire they make sunshine, and so
on. 1 * 1 Evidently Gilgamesh was a heroic form of the god Tammuz, the slayer of the demons of winter and
storm, who passed one part of the year in the world and another in Hades (Chapter VI).
Like Hercules, Gilgamesh figured chiefly in legendary
narrative as a mighty hero. He wa apparently of great
antiquity, so that it is impossible to identify him with any forerunner of Sargon of Akkad, or Alexander the Great.
His exploits were depicted on cylinder seals of the Sumerian period, and he is shown wrestling with a lion as Hercules wrestled with the monstrous lion in the valley of Nemea. The story of his adventures was narrated on
twelve clay tablets, which were preserved in the library of
Ashur-banipal, the Assyrian emperor. In the first tablet, which is badly mutilated, Gilgamesh is referred to as the man who beheld the world, and had great wisdom because
he peered into the mysteries. He travelled to distant
places, and was informed regarding the flood and the
primitive race which the gods destroyed; he also obtained
the plant of life, which his enemy, the earth-lion, in the form of a serpent or well demon, afterwards carried
away. Gilgamesh was associated with Erech, where he reigned
as " the lord". There Ishtar had a great temple, but her
worldly wealth had decreased. The fortifications of the
city were crumbling, and for three years the Elamites
besieged it. The gods had turned to flies and the winged
bulls had become like mice. Men wailed like wild beasts
and maidens moaned like doves. Ultimately the people
prayed to the goddess Aruru to create a liberator. Bel,
Shamash, and Ishtar also came to their aid.

Arum heard the cries of her worshippers. She dipped her hands in water and then formed a warrior with clay.
He was named Ea-bani, which signifies "Ea is my
creator". It is possible, therefore, that an ancient myth
of Eridu forms the basis of the narrative.
Ea-bani is depicted on the cylinder seals as a hairy
man-monster resembling the god Pan. He ate grass with the gazelles and drank water with wild beasts, and
he is compared to the corn god, which suggests that he was an early form of Tammuz, and of character somewhat
resembling the Egyptian Bast, the half- bestial god of
fertility. A hunter was sent out from Erech to search for the man-monster, and found him beside a stream in
a savage place drinking with his associates, the wild
animals. The description of Ea-bani recalls that of Nebuchadnezzar when he was stricken with madness. " He was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen,
and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his
hairs were grown like eagles' feathers, and his nails like
birds' claws/' 1
The hunter had no desire to combat with Ea-bani, so
he had him lured from the wilds by a beautiful woman.
Love broke the spell which kept Ea-bani in his savage state, and the wild beasts fled from him. Then the
temptress pleaded with him to go with her to Erech,
where Anu and Ishtar had their temples, and the mighty
Gilgamesh lived in his palace. Ea-bani, deserted by his bestial companions, felt lonely and desired human friend
ship. So he consented to accompany his bride. Having
heard of Gilgamesh from the hunter, he proposed to test his strength in single combat, but Shamash, god of the sun, warned Ea-bani that he was the protector of Gilgamesh,
1 Daniel, iv, 33. It is possible that Nebuchadnezzar, as the human representative of the god of corn and fertility, imitated the god by living a time in the wilds like Ea-bani.



174 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
who had been endowed with great knowledge by Bel and
Anu and Ea. Gilgamesh was also counselled in a vision
of night to receive Ea-bani as an ally.
Ea-bani was not attracted by city life and desired to
return to the wilds, but Shamash prevailed upon him to
remain as the friend of Gilgamesh, promising that he
would be greatly honoured and exalted to high rank.
The two heroes became close friends, and when the
narrative becomes clear again, they are found to be setting
forth to wage war against Chumbaba,1 the King of Elam.
Their journey was long and perilous. In time they entered a thick forest, and wondered greatly at the numerous and lofty cedars. They saw the great road which the king had caused to be made, the high mountain, and the temple of the god. Beautiful were the trees
about the mountain, and there were many shady retreats
that were fragrant and alluring. At this point the narrative breaks off, for the tablet is
mutilated. When it is resumed a reference is made to " the head of Chumbaba ", who has apparently been slain by the heroes. Erech was thus freed from the
oppression of its fierce enemy. Gilgamesh and Ea-bani appear to have become prosperous and happy. But in the hour of triumph a shadow
falls. Gilgamesh is robed in royal splendour and wears
his dazzling crown. He is admired by all men, but sud
denly it becomes known that the goddess Ishtar has been
stricken with love for him. She "loved him with that love which was his doom ". Those who are loved by
celestials or demons become, in folk tales, melancholy wanderers and "night wailers". The "wretched wight"
in Keats1 "La Belle Dame Sans Merci" is a typical
example.

Having kissed her lover to sleep, the fairy woman
vanished. The "knight" then saw in a dream the ghosts

I saw their starved lips in the gloam, With horrid warning gaped wide ;

The goddess Ishtar appeared as "La Belle Dame Sans

thy strength unto me. Be thou my husband and I will
be thy bride. Thou shalt have a chariot of gold and
lapis lazuli with golden wheels and gem-adorned. Thy steeds shall be fair and white and powerful. Into my
dwelling thou shalt come amidst the fragrant cedars.
Every king and every prince will bow down before thee,
O Gilgamesh, to kiss thy feet, and all people will become subject unto thee."
Gilgamesh feared the fate which would attend him as

the lover of Ishtar, and made answer saying: "To what husband hast thou ever remained faithful ? Each year
Tammuz, the lover of thy youth, is caused by thee to
weep. Thou didst love the Allala bird and then broke
his wings, and he moans in the woods crying, <O my
wings!' Thou didst love the lion and then snared him.
Thou didst love the horse, and then laid harness on him
and made him gallop half a hundred miles so that he
suffered great distress, and thou didst oppress his mother
Silili. Thou didst love a shepherd who sacrificed kids
unto thee, and then thou didst smite him so that he
became a jackal (or leopard) ; his own herd boy drove
him away and his dogs rent him in pieces. Thou didst
love Ishullanu, the gardener of Anu, who made offerings unto thee, and then smote him so that he was unable to move. Alas ! if thou wouldst love me, my fate would
be like unto the fates of those on whom thou hast laid
affliction."
Ishtar's heart was filled with wrath when she heard
the words which Gilgamesh had spoken, and she prevailed
upon her father Anu to create a fierce bull which she sent
against the lord of Erech.
This monster, however, was slain by Gilgamesh 1 and Ea-bani, but their triumph was shortlived. Ishtar cursed
Gilgamesh. Ea-bani then defied her and threatened to deal with her as he had dealt with the bull, with the
result that he was cursed by the goddess also.
Gilgamesh dedicated the horns of the bull to Shamash and returned with his friend to Erech, where they were
received with great rejoicings. A festival was held, and afterwards the heroes lay down to sleep. Then Ea-bani
dreamt a dream of ill omen. He met his death soon
afterwards, apparently in a battle, and Gilgamesh lamented

it would appear that Gilgamesh resolved to undertake a
journey, for he had been stricken by disease. He wept
and cried out, "Oh! let me not die like Ea-bani, for
death is fearful. I will seek the aid of mine ancestor,
Pir-napishtim
" the Babylonian Noah, who was believed to be dwelling on an island which corresponds to the
Greek u Island of the Blessed ". The Babylonian island lay in the ocean of the Nether World.
It seems that Gilgamesh not only hoped to obtain the
Water of Life and the Plant of Life to cure his own
disease, but also to restore to life his dead friend, Ea-bani,
whom he loved.
Gilgamesh set out on his journey and in time reached a mountain chasm. Gazing on the rugged heights, he
beheld fierce lions and his heart trembled. Then he
cried upon the moon god, who took pity upon him, and
under divine protection the hero pressed onward. He crossed the rocky range and then found himself con
fronted by the tremendous mountain of Mashi " Sunset hill ", which divided the land of the living from the
western land of the dead. The mountain peak rose to
heaven, and its foundations were in Aralu, the Under
world. 1 A dark tunnel pierced it and could be entered
through a door, but the door was shut and on either side
were two monsters of horrible aspect the gigantic
" scorpion man " and his wife, whose heads reached to
the clouds. When Gilgamesh beheld them he swooned
with terror. But they did him no harm, perceiving that
he was a son of a god and had a body like a god.
When Gilgamesh revived, he realized that the mon

1 78 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
sters regarded him with eyes of sympathy. Addressing the scorpion giant, he told that he desired to visit his
ancestor, Pir-napishtim, who sat in the council of the gods and had divine attributes. The giant warned him
of the dangers which he would encounter, saying that the mountain passage was twelve miles long and beamless
and black. Gilgamesh, however, resolved to encounter
any peril, for he was no longer afraid, and he was allowed to go forward. So he entered through the monsterguarded mountain door and plunged into thick unbroken darkness. For twice twelve hours he groped blindly
onward, until he saw a ray of light. Quickening his steps, he then escaped from the dreadful tunnel and once
more rejoiced in the rays of the sun. He found himself in an enchanted garden, and in the midst of it he saw a
divine and beautiful tree towards which he hastened. On
its gleaming branches hung clusters of precious stones
and its leaves were of lapis lazuli. His eyes were dazzled,
but he did not linger there. Passing many other wonder
ful trees, he came to a shoreland, and he knew that he was drawing nigh to the Sea of Death. The country which he entered was ruled over by the sea lady whose name was
Sabitu. When she saw the pilgrim drawing nigh, she entered her palace and shut the door.
Gilgamesh called out requesting that he should be
allowed to enter, and mingled his entreaties with threats
to break open the door. In the end Sabitu appeared and
spoke, saying:
Gilgamesh, whither hurriest thou ?
The life that thou seekest thou wilt not find. When the gods created man They fixed death for mankind.
Life they took in their own hand.
Thou, O Gilgamesh, let thy belly be filled !

Day and night be merry, Daily celebrate a feast, Day and night dance and make merry!
Clean be thy clothes, Thy head be washed, bathe in water !
Look joyfully on the child that grasps thy hand, Be happy with the wife in thine arms !

This is the philosophy of the Egyptian " Lay of the
Harper ". The following quotations are from two separate versions:
How rests this just prince !
The goodly destiny befalls,
The bodies pass away Since the time of the god,
And generations come into their places.
(Make) it pleasant for thee to follow thy desire While thou livest.

following quotation from Ecclesiastes :

a merry heart. . . . Let thy garments be always white ; and

" The pious Hebrew mind ", Jastrow adds, " found the corrective to this view of life in the conception of a stern
but just God, acting according to self-imposed standards of right and wrong, whose rule extends beyond the
grave." The final words of the Preacher are, " Fear God and keep his commandments ",2
Gilgamesh did not accept the counsel of the fatalistic
sea lady. He asked her how he could reach Pir-napish
tim, his ancestor, saying he was prepared to cross the Sea of Death: if he could not cross it he would die of
grief.
Sabitu answered him, saying: "O Gilgamesh, no mortal
is ferried over this great sea. Who can pass over it save
Shamash alone ? The way is full of peril. O Gilgamesh,
how canst thou battle against the billows of death?"
At length, however, the sea lady revealed to the
pilgrim that he might obtain the aid of the sailor, Arad
Ea, who served his ancestor Pir-napishtim.
Gilgamesh soon found where Arad Ea dwelt, and after
a time prevailed upon him to act as ferryman. Arad Ea required a helm for his boat, and Gilgamesh hastened to
fashion one from a tree. When it was fixed on, the boat
was launched and the voyage began. Terrible experiences
were passed through as they crossed the Sea of Death,
but at length they drew nigh to the " Island of the Blessed" on which dwelt Pir-napishtim and his wife.
Wearied by his exertions and wasted by disease, Gilgamesh
sat resting in the boat. He did not go ashore.
1 Ecctestastes, ix, 7-9. 2 //</., xii, 13.



DEIFIED HEROES 181
Pir-napishtim had perceived the vessel crossing the Sea of Death and marvelled greatly.
The story is unfortunately interrupted again, but it
appears that Gilgamesh poured into the ears of his ancestor the tale of his sufferings, adding that he feared
death and desired to escape his fate.
Pir-napishtim made answer, reminding the pilgrim
that all men must die. Men built houses, sealed con
tracts, disputed one with another, and sowed seeds in the
earth, but as long as they did so and the rivers rose in
flood, so long would their fate endure. Nor could any
man tell when his hour would come. The god of destiny
measured out the span of life: he fixed the day of death,
but never revealed his secrets.
Gilgamesh then asked Pir-napishtim how it chanced
that he was still alive. "Thou hast suffered no change/'
he said, u thou art even as I am. Harden not thy heart against me, but reveal how thou hast obtained divine life
in the company of the gods."
Pir-napishtim thereupon related to his descendant the
story of the deluge, which is dealt with fully in the next
chapter. The gods had resolved to destroy the world,
and Ea in a dream revealed unto Pir-napishtim how he
could escape. He built a ship which was tossed about on the waters, and when the world had been destroyed,
Bel discovered him and transported him to that island in the midst of the Sea of Death.
Gilgamesh sat in the boat listening to the words of
his ancestor. When the narrative was ended, Pir-napish
tim spoke sympathetically and said: "Who among the
gods will restore thee to health, O Gilgamesh ? Thou
hast knowledge of my life, and thou shalt be given the
life thou dost strive after. Take heed, therefore, to what
I say unto thee. For six days and seven nights thou



1 82 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
shalt not lie down, but remain sitting like one in the
midst of grief."
l
Gilgamesh sat in the ship, and sleep enveloped him like to a black storm cloud.
Pir-napishtim spoke to his wife and said: "Behold the
hero who desireth to have life. Sleep envelops him like to a black storm cloud/'
To that lone man his wife made answer: "Lay thine
hand upon him so that he may have perfect health and be
enabled to return to his own land. Give him power to
pass through the mighty door by which he entered/'
Then Pir-napishtim addressed his wife, saying: "His
sufferings make me sad. Prepare thou for him the magic food, and place it near his head."
On the day when Gilgamesh lay down, the food was
prepared by seven magic processes, and the woman ad
ministered it while yet he slept. Then Pir-napishtim touched him, and he awoke full of life.
Gilgamesh spake unto Pir-napishtim and said: " I was suddenly overcome by sleep. . . . But thou didst awaken
me by touching me, even thou. . , . Lo! I am bewitched.
What hast thou done unto thy servant?"
Then Pir-napishtim told Gilgamesh that he had been given to eat of the magic food. Afterwards he caused
Arad Ea to carry Gilgamesh to a fountain of healing,
where his disease -stricken body was cleansed. The blemished skin fell from him, and he was made whole.
Thereafter Gilgamesh prepared to return to his own
land. Ere he bade farewell, however, Pir-napishtim revealed unto him the secret of a magic plant which had
power to renew life and give youth and strength unto
those who were old.

DEIFIED HEROES 183
Arad Ea conducted the hero to the island where the
plant grew, and when Gilgamesh found it he rejoiced, and
said that he would carry it to Erech, his own city, where
he would partake of it and restore his youth.
So Gilgamesh and Arad Ea went on their way to
gether, nor paused until they came to a well of pure
water. The hero stooped down to draw water.1 But
while he was thus engaged that demon, the Earth Lion,
crept forth as a serpent, and, seizing the magic plant of life, carried it away. Stricken with terror, Gilgamesh uttered a curse. Then he sat down and wept bitterly,
and the tears streamed over his face. To Arad Ea he
spake, saying: "Why has my health been restored to me?
Why should I rejoice because that I live ? The benefit
which I should have derived for myself has now fallen to the Earth Lion/'
The two travellers then resumed their journey, per
forming religious acts from time to time; chanting dirges and holding feasts for the dead, and at length Gilgamesh
returned to Erech. He found that the city walls were
crumbling, and he spake regarding the ceremonies which had been performed while yet he was in a far-distant
country. During the days which followed Gilgamesh sorrowed for his lost friend Ea-bani, whose spirit was in the
Underworld, the captive of the spirits of death. " Thou canst not draw thy bow now," he cried, "nor raise the
battle shout. Thou canst not kiss the woman thou
hast loved ; thou canst not kiss the child thou hast
loved, nor canst thou smite those whom thou hast
hated."
In vain Gilgamesh appealed to his mother goddess to
restore Ea-bani to him. Then he turned to the gods, and
1 Probably to perform the ceremony of pouring out a libation.



1 84 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
Ea heard him. Thereafter Nergal, god of death, caused the grave to yawn, and the spirit of Ea-bani arose like a
wind gust. Gilgamesh, still dreading death, spoke to the ghost of
his friend, saying: "Tell me, my friend, O tell me regarding the land in which thou dost dwell/' Ea-bani made answer sorrowfully: "Alas! I cannot
tell thee, my friend. If I were to tell thee all, thou
wouldst sit down and weep."
Said Gilgamesh : " Let me sit down and weep, but
tell me regarding the land of spirits."
The text is mutilated here, but it can be gathered that Ea-bani described the land where ill-doers were punished,
where the young were like the old, where the worm devoured, and dust covered all. But the state of the
warrior who had been given burial was better than that of the man who had not been buried, and had no one to
lament or care for him. " He who hath been slain in
battle," the ghost said, "reposeth on a couch drinking pure water one slain in battle as thou hast seen and I
have seen. His head is supported by his parents: beside
him sits his wife. His spirit doth not haunt the earth.
But the spirit of that man whose corpse has been left
unburied and uncared for, rests not, but prowls through
the streets eating scraps of food, the leavings of the feast, and drinking the dregs of vessels." So ends the story of Gilgamesh in the form which survives to us.
The journey of Gilgamesh to the Island of the Blessed
recalls the journeys made by Odin, Hermod, Svipdag,
Hotherus and others to the Germanic Hela. When Hermod went to search for Balder, as the Prose Edda
relates, he rode through thick darkness for nine days and
nine nights ere he crossed the mountains. As Gilgamesh



DEIFIED HEROES 185
met Sabitu, Hermod met Modgudur, " the maiden who
kept the bridge
" over the river Gjsll. Svipdag, accord
ing to a Norse poem, was guided like the Babylonian
hero by the moon god, Gevar, who instructed him what
way he should take to find the irresistible sword. Saxo's
Hother, who is instructed by "King Gewar", crosses
dismal mountains "beset with extraordinary cold".1
Thorkill crosses a stormy ocean to the region of perpetual darkness, where the ghosts of the dead are confined in loathsome and dusty caves. At the main entrance
" the door posts were begrimed with the soot of ages ".* In the Elder Edda Svipdag is charmed against the
perils he will be confronted by as he fares "o'er seas
mightier than men do know ", or is overtaken by night
" wandering on the misty way ".8 When Odin " down
ward rode into Misty Hel " he sang spells at a " witch's
grave ", and the ghost rose up to answer his questions
regarding Balder. "Tell me tidings of Hel", he addressed her, as Gilgamesh addressed the ghost of Ea-bani.
In the mythical histories of Alexander the Great, the hero searches for the Water of Life, and is confronted
by a great mountain called Musas (Mashti). A demon
stops him and says; "O king, thou art not able to march
through this mountain, for in it dwelleth a mighty god
who is like unto a monster serpent, and he preventeth
everyone who would go unto him." In another part of the narrative Alexander and his army arrive at a
place of darkness " where the blackness is not like the darkness of night, but is like unto the mists and clouds
which descend at the break of day ". A servant uses
a shining jewel stone, which Adam had brought from
Paradise, to guide him, and found the well. He drank

of the "waters of life " and bathed in them, with the result
that he was strengthened and felt neither hunger nor
thirst. When he came out of the well " all the flesh of
his body became bluish-green and his garments likewise bluish-green ". Apparently he assumed the colour of
supernatural beings. Rama of India was blue, and certain of his monkey allies were green, like the fairies of Eng
land and Scotland. This fortunate man kept his secret. His name was Matun, but he was afterwards nicknamed
" <El-Khidr ', that is to say,
c Green' ". What explanation he offered for his sudden change of appearance has not
been recorded. 1 It is related that when Matun reached
the Well of Life a dried fish which he dipped in the
water was restored to life and swam away. In the Koran
a similar story is told regarding Moses and Joshua, who
travelled " for a long space of time " to a place where
two seas met. " They forgot their fish which they had
taken with them, and the fish took its way freely to the
sea." The Arabian commentators explain that Moses
once agreed to the suggestion that he was the wisest of
men. In a dream he was directed to visit Al Khedr,
who was " more knowing than he ", and to take a fish
with him in a basket. On the seashore Moses fell asleep,
and the fish, which had been roasted, leapt out of the
basket into the sea. Another version sets forth that
Joshua, " making the ablution at the fountain of life ",
some of the water happened to be sprinkled on the fish,
which immediately leapt up.

The Well of Life is found in Fingalian legends.
When Diarmid was mortally wounded by the boar, he
called upon Finn to carry water to him from the well:

Campbell's West Highland Tales, vol. iii, 80.
The quest of the plant, flower, or fruit of life is
referred to in many folk tales. In the Mahdbhdrata,
Bhima, the Indian Gilgamesh or Hercules, journeys to
north-eastern Celestial regions to find the lake of the
god Kuvera (Kubera), on which grow the " most beauti
ful and unearthly lotuses ", which restore health and give
strength to the weary. As Gilgamesh meets with Pir
napishtim, who relates the story of the Deluge which
destroyed the "elder race", Bhima meets with Hanuman,
who informs him regarding the Ages of the Universe
and the races which were periodically destroyed by
deluges. When Bhima reaches the lotus lake he fights
with demons. To heal his wounds and recover strength
he plunges into the lake. "As he drank of the waters,
like unto nectar, his energy and strength were again
fully restored.' 1 l
Hercules similarly sets out to search for the golden
apples which grow in
those Hesperian gardens famed of old, Fortunate fields, and groves and flowery vales.
As Bhima slew Yakshas which guarded the lotuses, Hercules slew Ladon, the guardian of the apples. Other
heroes kill treasure-protecting dragons of various kinds. There is a remarkable resemblance between the Baby
lonian account of Gilgamesh's journey through the mountain tunnel to the garden and seashore, and the Indian
story of the demigod Hanuman passing through the long

cavern to the shoreland palace of the female ascetic, when he
was engaged searching for Sita, the wife of Rama, who had
been carried away by Ravana, the demon king of Ceylon. In the version of the latter narrative which is given in the
MahAbhdrata, Hanuman says: "I bring thee good news,
O Rama; for Janaka's daughter hath been seen by me.
Having searched the southern region with all its hills,
forests, and mines for some time, we became very weary.
At length we beheld a great cavern. And having beheld it, we entered that cavern which extended over many
yojanas. It was dark and deep, and overgrown with trees
and infested by worms. And having gone a great way
through it, we came upon sunshine and beheld a beautiful
palace. It was the abode of the Daitya (sea demon)
Maya. And there we beheld a female ascetic named
ParbhAvati engaged in ascetic austerities. And she gave
us food and drink of various kinds. And having refreshed
ourselves therewith and regained our strength, we proceeded along the way shown by her. At last we came out of the cavern and beheld the briny sea, and on its
shores, the Sahya, the Malaya^ and the great Dardura
mountains. And ascending the mountains of Malaya, we beheld before us the vast ocean (or, "the abode of
Varuna "). And beholding it, we felt sorely grieved in
mind. . . . We despaired of returning with our lives.
. . . We then sat together, resolved to die there of
starvation."
Hanuman and his friends, having had, so far, experiences similar to those of Gilgamesh, next discovered the
eagle giant which had burned its wings when endeavouring to soar to the sun. This great bird, which resembles the
Etana eagle, expressed the opinion that Sita was in Lanka (Ceylon), whither she must have been carried by Ravana.
But no one dared to cross the dangerous ocean. Hanuman

at length, however, obtained the assistance of Vayu, the
wind god, his divine father, and leapt over the sea, slaying
monsters as he went. He discovered where the fair lady
was concealed by the king of demons.1
The dark tunnel is met with in many British stories
of daring heroes who set out to explore it, but never
return. In the Scottish versions the adventurers are
invariably pipers who are accompanied by dogs. The sound of the pipes is heard for a time; then the music
ceases suddenly, and shortly afterwards the dog returns
without a hair upon its body. It has evidently been in conflict with demons.
The tunnel may run from a castle to the seashore,
from a cave on one side of a hill to a cave on the other,
or from a seashore cave to a distant island.
It is possible that these widespread tunnel stories had
origin among the cave dwellers of the Palaeolithic Age,
who believed that deep caverns were the doors of the
underground retreats of dragons and giants and other supernatural enemies of mankind.
In Babylonia, as elsewhere, the priests utilized the
floating material from which all mythologies were framed, and impressed upon it the stamp of their doctrines. The
symbolized stories were afterwards distributed far and
wide, as were those attached to the memory of Alexander
the Great at a later period. Thus in many countries may
be found at the present day different versions of im
memorial folk tales, which represent various stages of
culture, and direct and indirect contact at different periods
with civilizations that have stirred the ocean of human
thought, and sent their ideas rippling in widening circles
to far-distant shores.

THE story of the Deluge which was related to Gilgamesh
by Pir-napishtim runs as follows:
" Hear me, O Gilgamesh, and I will make revelation
regarding the hidden doings of the high gods. As thou knowest, the city of Shurippak is situated upon the bank
of the Euphrates. The gods were within it : there they assembled together in council. Anu, the father, was there, and Bel the counsellor and warrior, Ninip the
messenger, and Ennugi the governor. Ea, the wise lord, sat also with them. In their hearts the gods agreed
together to send a great deluge.
"Thereafter Ea made known the purpose of the
divine rulers in the hut of reeds, saying:1 C O hut of
1 Ea addresses the hut in which his human favourite, Pir-napishtim, slept. His message was conveyed to this man in a dream. 190



DELUGE LEGEND 191
reeds, hear; O wall, understand . . . O man of Shurippak,
son of Umbara Tutu, tear down thy house and build
a ship ; leave all thou dost possess and save thy life,
and preserve in the ship the living seed of every kind.
The ship that thou wilt build must be of goodly pro
portions in length and height. It must be floated on
the great deep.'
" I heard the command of Ea and understood, and
I made answer, saying,
* O wise lord, as thou hast said
so will I do, for thy counsel is most excellent. But how
shall I give reason for my doings to the young men and
the elders?'
" Ea opened his mouth and said unto me, his servant :
c What thou shalt say unto them is this . . . //
hath been revealed unto me that Eel doth hate mey there
fore I cannot remain any longer in his domain^ this city of Shurippak) so I must depart unto the domain of Ea and dwell with him . . . Unto you will Bel send abundance
of rain, so that you may obtain birds and fishes in plenty and have a rich harvest. But Shamash hath appointed
a time for Ramman to pour down destruction from the
heavens.'"^
Ea then gave instructions to Pir-napishtim how to build the ship in which he should find refuge. So far
as can be gathered from the fragmentary text, it appears that this vessel was to have a deck house six stories
high, with nine apartments in each story. According
to another account, Ea drew a plan of the great ship upon the sand.
Pir-napishtim set to work and made a flat-bottomed vessel, which was 120 cubits wide and 120 cubits in
height. He smeared it with bitumen inside and pitch outside ; and on the seventh day it was ready. Then
1 The second sentence of Ea's speech is conjectural, as the lines are mutilated.



192 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
he carried out Ea's further instructions. Continuing
his narrative to Gilgamesh, he said :
" I gathered together all that I possessed, my silver
and gold and seeds of every kind, and my goods also.
These I placed in the ship. Then I caused to go aboard all my family and house servants, the animals of the
field and the beasts of the field and the workers every one of them I sent up.
" The god Shamash appointed the time, saying :
cI
will cause the Night Lord to send much rain and bring
destruction. Then enter thou the ship and shut thy
door.'
" At the appointed time the Night Lord sent at evenr
time much rain. I saw the beginning of the deluge and I was afraid to look up. I entered the ship and shut
the door. I appointed Buzur-Kurgala, the sailor, to be
captain, and put under his command the great vessel and all that it contained. "At the dawn of day I saw rising athwart the heavens
a dark cloud, and in the midst of it Ramman thundered. Nebo and Merodach went in front, speeding like emis
saries over hills and plains. The cables of the ship were
let loose.
"Then Ninip, the tempest god, came nigh, and the storm broke in fury before him. All the earth spirits
leapt up with flaming torches and the whole land was
aflare. The thunder god swept over the heavens,
blotting out the sunlight and bringing thick darkness.
Rain poured down the whole day long, and the earth was covered with water ; the rivers were swollen ; the land was in confusion ; men stumbled about in the darkness, battling with the elements. Brothers were unable
to see brothers; no man could recognize his friends. . . .
The spirits above looked down and beheld the rising

flood and were afraid : they fled away, and in the heaven
of Anu they crouched like to hounds in the protecting
enclosures.
" In time Ishtar, the lady of the gods, cried out dis
tressfully, saying :
c The elder race hath perished and
turned to clay because that I have consented to evil counsel in the assembly of the gods. Alas ! I have
allowed my people to be destroyed. I gave being to man, but where is he ? Like the offspring of fish he cumbers the deep/
" The earth spirits were weeping with Ishtar : they
sat down cowering with tightened lips and spake not ; they mourned in silence.
" Six days and six nights went past, and the tempest raged over the waters which gradually covered the land.
But when the seventh day came, the wind fell, the whirl
ing waters grew peaceful, and the sea retreated. The storm was over and the rain of destruction had ceased.
I looked forth. I called aloud over the waters. But all mankind had perished and turned to clay. Where fields had been I saw marshes only.
"Then I opened wide the window of the ship, and the sunlight suffused my countenance. I was dazzled
and sank down weeping and the tears streamed over
my face. Everywhere I looked I saw water.
"At length, land began to appear. The ship drifted towards the country of Nitsir, and then it was held fast
by the mountain of Nitsir. Six days went past and the
ship remained stedfast. On the seventh day I sent forth
a dove, and she flew away and searched this way and that, but found no resting place, so she returned. I then sent
forth a swallow, and she returned likewise. Next 1 sent
forth a raven, and she flew away. She saw that the waters were shrinking, and gorged and croaked and waded, but

did not come back. Then I brought forth all the animals
into the air of heaven.
"An offering I made on the mountain. I poured
out a libation. I set up incense vessels seven by seven
on heaped-up reeds and used cedar wood with incense.
The gods smelt the sweet savour, and they clustered like
flies about the sacrificer.
"Thereafter Ishtar (Sirtu) drew nigh. Lifting up the
jewels, which the god Anu had fashioned for her accord
ing to her desire, she spake, saying :
< Oh ! these gods !
1 vow by the lapis lazuli gems upon my neck that I will
never forget ! I will remember these days for ever and ever. Let all the gods come hither to the offering, save
Bel (Enlil) alone, because that he ignored my counsel,
and sent a great deluge which destroyed my people.'
" But Bel Enlil came also, and when he beheld the
ship he paused. His heart was filled with wrath against
the gods and the spirits of heaven. Angrily he spake and said: 'Hath one escaped? It was decreed that no human being should survive the deluge.'
" Ninip, son of Bel, spoke, saying: 'Who hath done
this save Ea alone ? He knoweth all things.'
" Ea, god of the deep, opened his mouth and said
unto the warrior Bel: 'Thou art the lord of the gods, O warrior. But thou wouldst not hearken to my counsel
and caused the deluge to be. Now punish the sinner
for his sins and the evil doer for his evil deed, but be
merciful and do not destroy all mankind. May there
never again be a flood. Let the lion come and men will

Flood myths are found in many mythologies both in
the Old World and the New.
The violent and deceitful men of the mythical Bronze
Age of Greece were destroyed by a flood. It is related
that Zeus said on one occasion to Hermes: "I will send
a great rain, such as hath not been since the making of
the world, and the whole race of men shall perish. 1 am
weary of their iniquity." For receiving with hospitable warmth these two gods
in human guise^ Deucalion, an old man, and his wife Pyrrha were spared, however. Zeus instructed his host
to build an ark of oak, and store it well with food.
When this was done, the couple entered the vessel and
shut the door. Then Zeus " broke up all the fountains
of the deep, and opened the well springs of heaven, and
it rained for forty days and forty nights continually".
The Bronze folk perished : not even those who fled to
the hilltops could escape. The ark rested on Parnassus, and when the waters ebbed the old couple descended the mountain and took up their abode in a cave.1

196 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
In Indian mythology the world is destroyed by a flood at the end of each Age of the Universe. There
are four ages : the Krita or Perfect Age, the Treta Age,
the Dwapara Age, and the Kali or Wicked Age. These
correspond closely to the Greek and Celtic ages.
1 There
are also references in Sanskrit literature to the destruction
of the world because too many human beings lived upon
it. "When the increase of population had been so
frightful," a sage related, " the Earth, oppressed with the excessive burden, sank down for a hundred Yojanas.
Suffering pain in all her limbs, and being deprived of her senses by excessive pressure, the Earth in distress sought
the protection of Narayana, the foremost of the gods." 2 Manu's account of the flood has been already referred
to (Chapter II). The god in fish shape informed him:
" The time is ripe for purging the world. . . . Build a
strong and massive ark, and furnish it with a long rope.
. . ." When the waters rose the horned fish towed the
ark over the roaring sea, until it grounded on the highest peak of the Himavat, which is still called Naubandha
(the harbour). Manu was accompanied by seven rishis.8 In the Celtic (Irish) account of the flood, Cessair, granddaughter of Noah, was refused a chamber for herself in the ark, and fled to the western borders of the world
as advised by her idol. 4 Her fleet consisted of three
ships, but two foundered before Ireland was reached.
The survivors in addition to Cessair were, her father Bith,
two other men, Fintan and Ladru, and fifty women.
All of these perished on the hills except Fintan, who
slept on the crest of a great billow, and lived to see
Partholon, the giant, arriving from Greece.

DELUGE LEGEND 197
There is a deluge also in Egyptian mythology.
When Ra, the sun god, grew old as an earthly king, men
began to mutter words against him. He called the gods
together and said : " I will not slay them (his subjects) until I have heard what ye say concerning them/' Nu,
his father, who was the god of primeval waters, advised the wholesale destruction of mankind. Said Ra: "Behold men flee unto the hills; their heart
is full of fear because of that which they said."
The goddess Hathor-Sekhet, the Eye of Ra, then went forth and slew mankind on the hills. Thereafter
Ra, desiring to protect the remnant of humanity, caused
a great offering to be made to the goddess, consisting of corn beer mixed with herbs and human blood. This
drink was poured out during the night. "And the goddess came in the morning; she found the fields inundated,
she rejoiced thereat, she drank thereof, her heart was rejoiced, she went about drunken and took no more
cognizance of men." 1 It is obvious that the Egyptian myth refers to the
annual inundation of the Nile, the " human blood " in
the "beer" being the blood of the slain corn god, or of
his earthly representative. It is probable that the flood legends of North and South America similarly reflected
local phenomena, although the possibility that they were of Asiatic origin, like the American Mongoloid tribes,
cannot be overlooked. Whether or not Mexican civiliza
tion, which was flourishing about the time of the battle
of Hastings, received any cultural stimulus from Asia is a
question regarding which it would be unsafe to dogmatize, owing to the meagre character of the available data.
The Mexican deluge was caused by the "water sun", which suddenly discharged the moisture it had been

drawing from the earth in the form of vapour through
long ages. All life was destroyed.
A flood legend among the Nahua tribes resembles
closely the Babylonian story as told by Pir-napishtim.
The god Titlacahuan instructed a man named Nata to
make a boat by hollowing out a cypress tree, so as to escape the coming deluge with his wife Nena. This pair
escaped destruction. They offered up a fish sacrifice in
the boat and enraged the deity who visited them, dis
playing as much indignation as did Bel when he discovered
that Pir-napishtim had survived the great disaster. Nata and Nena had been instructed to take with them one ear
of maize only, which suggests that they were harvest
spirits.
In Brazil, Monan, the chief god, sent a great fire to
burn up the world and its wicked inhabitants. To extin
guish the flames a magician caused so much rain to fall
that the earth was flooded.
The Californian Indians had a flood legend, and
believed that the early race was diminutive; and the Athapascan Indians of the north-west professed to be
descendants of a family who escaped the deluge. Indeed,
deluge myths were widespread in the " New World ".
The American belief that the first beings who were created were unable to live on earth was shared by the
Babylonians. According to Berosus the first creation was
a failure, because the animals could not bear the light and
they all died. 1 Here we meet with the germs of the Doctrine of the World's Ages, which reached its highest
development in Indian, Greek, and Celtic (Irish) myth
ologies. The Biblical account of the flood is familiar to readers.

it differs so much in many essential details." 1
The drift of Babylonian culture was not only directed westward towards the coast of Palestine, and from thence to Greece during the Phoenician period, but also eastward
through Elam to the Iranian plateau and India. Reference has already been made to the resemblances between
early Vedic and Sumerian mythologies. When the " new
songs
" of the Aryan invaders of India were being com
posed, the sky and ocean god, Varuna, who resembles
Ea-Oannes, and Mitra, who links with Shamash, were
already declining in splendour. Other cultural influences were at work. Certain of the Aryan tribes, for instance,
buried their dead in Varuna's " house of clay ", while a
growing proportion cremated their dead and worshipped Agni, the fire god. At the close of the Vedic period there were fresh invasions into middle India, and the
" late comers " introduced new beliefs, including the
doctrines of the Transmigration of Souls and of the Ages
of the Universe. Goddesses also rose into prominence,
and the Vedic gods became minor deities, and subject to
Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva. These " late comers " had
undoubtedly been influenced by Babylonian ideas before they entered India. In their Doctrine of the World's
Ages or Yugas, for instance, we are forcibly reminded
of the Euphratean ideas regarding space and time. Mr.
Robert Brown, junr., who is an authority in this con
nection, shows that the system by which the " Day of

astronomical system which obtained in Babylonia, where
apparently the theory of cosmic periods had origin.
1
The various alien peoples, however, who came under the spell of Babylonian modes of thought did not remain
in a state of intellectual bondage. Thought was stimu
lated rather than arrested by religious borrowing, and the
development of ideas regarding the mysteries of life and death proceeded apace in areas over which the ritualistic
and restraining priesthood of Babylonia exercised no sway. As much may be inferred from the contrasting conceptions of the Patriarchs of Vedic and Sumerian mythologies.
Pir-napishtim, the Babylonian Noah, and the semi-divine
Gilgamesh appear to be represented in Vedic mythology
by Yama, god of the dead. Yama was " the first man ",
and, like Gilgamesh, he set out on a journey over
mountains and across water to discover Paradise. He
is lauded in the Vedic hymns as the explorer of " the
path" or "way" to the "Land of the Pitris" (Fathers), the Paradise to which the Indian uncrematcd dead walked
on foot. Yama never lost his original character. He is
a traveller in the Epics as in the Vedas.2

They are identical with the Persian Celestial twins, Yima
and Yimeh. Yima resembles Mitra (Mithra); Varuna, the twin brother of Mitra, in fact, carries the noose
associated with the god of death. 1
The Indian Yama, who was also called Pitripati, " lord of the fathers ", takes Mitra's place in the Paradise of
Ancestors beside Varuna, god of the sky and the deep.
He sits below a tree, playing on a flute and drinking
the Soma drink which gives immortality. When the
descendants of Yama reached Paradise they assumed
shining forms " refined and from all taint set free ",2
In Persian mythology" Yima 7
*, says Professor Moulton, "reigns over a community which may well have been
composed of his own descendants, for he lived yet longer
than Adam. To render them immortal, he gives them to eat forbidden food, being deceived by the Daevas (demons).
What was this forbidden food ? May we connect it with
another legend whereby, at the Regeneration, Mithra is to
make men immortal by giving them to eat the fat of
the Ur-Kuh) the primeval cow from whose slain body,
according to the Aryan legends adopted by Mithraism, mapkind was first created ?"
Yima is punished for " presumptuously grasping at immortality for himself and mankind, on the suggestion of an evil power, instead of waiting Ahura's good time ".
Professor Moulton wonders if this story, which he
endeavours to reconstruct, "owed anything to Babylon ?"
Yima, like the Babylonian Pir-napishtim, is also a
revealer of the secrets of creation. He was appointed to
be " Guardian, Overseer, Watcher over my Creation " by

of Balder with corn suggests that, like Nata of the Nahua
tribes, he was a harvest spirit, among other things.
Leaving, meantime, the many problems which arise from consideration of the Deluge legends and their con
nection with primitive agricultural myths, the attention of readers may be directed to the Babylonian conception of the Otherworld.
Pir-napishtim, who escaped destruction at the Flood, resides in an Island Paradise, which resembles the Greek "Islands of the Blessed ", and the Irish "Tir nan og" or
"Land of the Young'*, situated in the western ocean, and
identical with the British 2
island-valley of Avilion,
Where falls not hail, or rain, or any snow, Nor ever wind blows loudly, but it lies
Deep meadow'd, happy, fair with orchard lawns
And bowery hollows crowned with summer sea.3
Only two human beings were permitted to reside on the Babylonian island paradise, however. These were
Pir-napishtim and his wife. Apparently Gilgamesh could not join them there. His gods did not transport heroes
and other favoured individuals to a happy isle or isles
like those of the Greeks and Celts and Aryo-Indians.
There was no Heaven for the Babylonian dead. All mankind were doomed to enter the gloomy Hades of the
Underworld, " the land of darkness and the shadow of
death; a land of darkness, as darkness itself; and of the shadow of death, without any order, and where the light is darkness ", as Job exclaimed in the hour of despair,
lamenting his fate.4

This gloomy habitation of the dead resembles the Greek Hades, the Teutonic Nifelhel, and the Indian
" Put ". No detailed description of it has been found.
The references, however, in the " Descent of Ishtar " and
the Gilgamesh epic suggest that it resembled the hidden
regions of the Egyptians, in which souls were tortured by
demons who stabbed them, plunged them in pools of fire, and thrust them into cold outer darkness where they
gnashed their teeth, or into places of horror swarming
with poisonous reptiles. Ishtar was similarly tortured by the plague demon,
Namtar, when she boldly entered the Babylonian Under
world to search for Tammuz. Other sufferings were, no
doubt, in store for her, resembling those, perhaps, with
which the giant maid in the Eddie poem " Skirnismal "
was threatened when she refused to marry Frey, the god
of fertility and harvest :
Trolls shall torment thae from morn till eve In the realms of the Jotun race, Each day to the dwellings of Frost giants must thou
Creep helpless, creep hopeless of love ;
Thou shalt weeping have in the stead of joy,
And sore burden bear with tears. . . .
May madness and shrieking, bondage and yearning
Burden thee with bondage and tears. 1
In like manner, too, the inhabitants of the Indian Hell
suffered endless and complicated tortures.2
The Persephone of the Babylonian Underworld was
Eresh-ki-gal, who was also called Allatu. A myth, which was found among the Egyptian Tel-el-Amarna "Letters",
sets forth that on one occasion the Babylonian gods held
a feast. All the deities attended it, except Eresh-ki-gal.

She was unable to leave her gloomy Underworld, and sent
her messenger, the plague demon Namtar, to obtain her
share. The various deities honoured Namtar, except
Nergal, by standing up to receive him. When Eresh-ki
gal was informed of this slight she became very angry, and demanded that Nergal should be delivered up to her
so that he might be put to death. The storm god at
once hastened to the Underworld, accompanied by his
own group of fierce demons, whom he placed as guardians at the various doors so as to prevent the escape of Eresh
ki-gal. Then he went boldly towards the goddess, clutched her by the hair, and dragged her from her throne. After a brief struggle, she found herself over
powered. Nergal made ready to cut off her head, but
she cried for mercy and said : " Do not kill me, my
brother! Let me speak to thee."
This appeal indicated that she desired to ransom her
life like the hags in the European folk tales so Nergal unloosed his hold Then Eresh-ki-gal continued: "Be thou my husband
and I will be thy wife. On thee I confer sovereignty over the wide earth, giving thee the tablet of wisdom.
Thou shalt be my lord and I will be thy lady."
Nergal accepted these terms by kissing the goddess.
Affectionately drying her tears, he spoke, saying: "Thou
shalt now have from me what thou hast demanded during these past months."
In other words, Nergal promises to honour her as
she desired, after becoming her husband and equal. In the "Descent of Ishtar" the Babylonian Underworld is called Cuthah. This city had a famous cemetery,
like Abydos in Egypt, where many pious and orthodox
worshippers sought sepulture. The local god was Nergal,
who symbolized the destructive power of the sun and the



206 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
sand storm; he was a gloomy, vengeful deity, attended
by the spirits of tempest, weariness, pestilence, and disease, and was propitiated because he was dreaded. In Nether Cuthah, as Ea-bani informed Gilgamesh,
the worm devoured the dead amidst the dust and thick
darkness. It is evident that this Underworld was modelled on
the grave. In early times men believed that the spirits of the dead hovered in or about the place of sepulture.
They were therefore provided with "houses" to protect
them, in the same manner as the living were protected in their houses above the ground.
The enemies of the human ghosts were the earth
spirits. Weapons were laid beside the dead in their
graves so that they might wage war against demons when
necessary. The corpse was also charmed, against attack, by the magical and protecting ornaments which were
worn by the living necklaces, armlets, ear-rings, &c.
Even face paint was provided, probably as a charm against the evil eye and other subtle influences.
So long as corpses were left in their graves, the spirits of the dead were, it would appear, believed to be safe. But they required food and refreshment. Food vessels
and drinking urns were therefore included in the funerary
furniture, and the dead were given food offerings at regular intervals. Once a year the living held feasts in
the burial ground, and invited the ghosts to share in the repast. This custom was observed in Babylonia, and is not yet obsolete in Egypt; Moslems and Coptic Chris
tians alike hold annual all-night feasts in their cemeteries.
The Japanese "Land of Yomi" is similarly an under
world, or great grave, where ghosts mingle with the
demons of disease and destruction. Souls reach it by
"the pass of Yomi". The Mikado, however, may be



DELUGE LEGEND 207
privileged to ascend to heaven and join the gods in the Eternal Land".
Among the ancient Romans the primitive belief sur
vived that the spirit of the dead "just sank into the earth where it rested, and returned from time to time to the
upper world through certain openings in the ground
(mundi), whose solemn uncovering was one of the regular observances of the festal calendar".1
According to Babylonian belief, the dead who were not properly buried roamed through the streets searching
for food, eating refuse and drinking impure water. Prior to the period of ceremonial burials, the dead
were interred in the houses in which they had lived a
custom which has made it possible for present-day scientists to accumulate much valuable data regarding
primitive races and their habits of life. The Palaeolithic
cave-dwellers of Europe were buried in their caves. These were then deserted and became the haunts of wild
animals. After a long interval a deserted cave was occu
pied by strangers. In certain characteristic caves the
various layers containing human remains represent distinct periods of the vast Pleistocene Age.
When Mediterranean man moved northward through
Europe, he utilized some of these caves, and constructed
in them well-built graves for his dead, digging down through older layers. In thus making a "house" within a "house", he has provided us with a link between an old custom and a new. Apparently he was influenced by
local practices and beliefs, for he met and mingled in
certain localities with the men of the Late Palaeolithic
Age.The primitive house-burial rite is referred to in the
Ethiopic version of the life of Alexander the Great. The

"Two-horned", as the hero was called, conversed with
Brahmans when he reached India. He spoke to one of
them, " saying :
c Have ye no tombs wherein to bury any
man among ye who may die ?' And an interpreter made answer to him, saying:
c Man and woman and child grow
up, and arrive at maturity, and become old, and when any one of them dieth we bury him in the place wherein
he lived; thus our graves are our houses. And our God knoweth that we desire this more than the lust for food and meat which all men have: this is our life and manner
of living in the darkness of our tombs. '" When Alex
ander desired to make a gift to these Brahmans, and asked
them what they desired most, their answer was, " Give us
immortality". 1 In the Gilgamesh epic the only ray of hope which relieves the gloomy closing passages is Ea-bani's suggestion that the sufferings endured by the dead may be
alleviated by the performance of strict burial rites. Com
menting on this point Professor Jastrow says: "A proper burial with an affectionate care of the corpse ensures at
least a quiet repose.
Such a one rests on a couch and drinks pure water ; But he whose shade has no rest in the earth, as I have seen
and you will see, His shade has no rest in the earth Whose shade no one cares for . . . What is left over in the pot, remains of rood That are thrown in the street, he eats." 2

His Brahmans evidently believed that immortality was denied to ordinary men, and reserved only for the king, who was the representative of the deity, of course. 2 Aspects of Religious Belief and Practice in Babylonia and Assyria, Morris Jastrow, pp. 358-9.

By disseminating the belief that the dead must be
buried with much ceremony, the priests secured great
power over the people, and extracted large fees.
In Egypt, on the other hand, the teachers of the
sun cult sold charms and received rewards to perform ceremonies so that chosen worshippers might enter the
sun-barque of Ra; while the Osirian priests promised
the just and righteous that they would reach an agricul
tural Paradise where they could live and work as on earth,
but receive a greater return for their labour, the harvests of the Otherworld being of unequalled abundance. In the sacred books of India a number of Paradises
are referred to. No human beings, however, entered the Paradise of Varuna, who resembles the Sumerian Ea-Oannes. The souls of the dead found rest and en
joyment in the Paradise of Yama, while "those kings
that yield up their lives, without turning their backs on
the field of battle, attain", as the sage told a hero, "to the mansion of Indra", which recalls the Valhal of Odin.
It will thus be seen that belief in immortality was a tenet of the Indian cults of Indra and Yama.
It is possible that the Gilgamesh epic in one of its forms concluded when the hero reached the island of Pir-napishtim, like the Indian Yama who "searched and
spied the path for many". The Indian "Land of the
Pitris "
(Ancestors), over which Yama presided, may be compared to the Egyptian heaven of Osiris. It contains,
we are told, "all kinds of enjoyable articles", and also
"sweet, juicy, agreeable and delicious edibles . . . floral
wreaths of the most delicious fragrance, and trees that
yield fruits that are desired of them". Thither go "all
sinners among human beings, as also (those) that have
died during the winter solstice' 11 a suggestion that this

210 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
Paradise was not unconnected with the Tammuz-like
deity who took up his abode in the spirit land during the
barren season.
The view may be urged that in the Gilgamesh epic
we have a development of the Tammuz legend in its
heroic form. Like Ishtar, when she descended to Hades,
the King of Erech could not return to earth until he
had been sprinkled by the water of life. No doubt, an
incident of this character occurred also in the original
Tammuz legend. The life of the god had to be renewed before he could return. Did he slumber, like one of the
Seven Sleepers, in Ea's house, and not awake again until
he arrived as a child in his crescent moon boat " the
sunken boat " of the hymns like Scef, who came over the waves to the land of the Scyldings ? It seems remarkable that the doctrine of Eternal
Bliss, which obtained in Egypt on the one hand and in India on the other, should never have been developed
among the Babylonians. Of course, our knowledge in this connection is derived from the orthodox religious
texts. Perhaps the great thinkers, whose influence can be traced in the tendencies towards monotheism which be
came marked at various periods, believed in a Heaven for
the just and good. If they did, their teachings must have
been suppressed by the mercenary priests. It was ex
tremely profitable for these priests to perpetuate the belief that the spirits of the dead were consigned to a gloomy
Hades, where the degree of suffering which they endured depended on the manner in which their bodies were dis
posed or upon earth. An orthodox funeral ceremony was
costly at all times. This is made evident by the inscrip
tions which record the social reforms of Urukagina, the
ill-fated patesi of Lagash. When he came to the throne
he cut down the burial fees by more than a half. "In



DELUGE LEGEND 211
the case of an ordinary burial," writes Mr. King, " when
a corpse was laid in a grave, it had been the custom for
the presiding priest to demand as a fee for himself seven
urns of wine or strong drink, four hundred and twenty loaves of bread, one hundred and twenty measures of
corn, a garment, a kid, a bed, and a seat." The reformer
reduced the perquisites to " three urns of wine, eighty
loaves of bread, a bed, and a kid, while the fee of his
(the priest's) assistant was cut down from sixty to thirty measures of corn".1
The conservative element in Babylonian religion is
reflected by the burial customs. These did not change
greatly after the Neolithic period. Prehistoric Sumerian
graves resemble closely those of pre-Dynastic Egypt.
The bodies of the dead were laid on their sides in
crouching posture, with a " beaker ", or " drinking
cup " urn, beside the right hand. Other vessels were
placed near the head. In this connection it may be noted
that the magic food prepared for Gilgamesh by Pir
napishtim's wife, when he lay asleep, was also placed near his head.
The corpse was always decked with various ornaments,
including rings, necklaces, and armlets. As has been
indicated, these were worn by the living as charms, and, no doubt, they served the same purpose for the dead. This charm - wearing custom was condemned by the
Hebrew teachers. On one occasion Jacob commanded
his household to " put away the strange gods which were
in their hand, and all the ear-rings which were in their ears ; and Jacob buried them under the oak which was
by Shechem".2 To Jacob, personal ornaments had quite
evidently an idolatrous significance.
" A very typical class of grave furniture ", writes Mr.

King, "consisted of palettes, or colour dishes, made of
alabaster, often of graceful shape, and sometimes standing on four feet. . . . There is no doubt as to their use, for
colour still remains in many of them, generally black and
yellow, but sometimes a light rose and light green." Palettes for face paint have also been found in many early
Egyptian graves.
The gods had their faces painted like the living and the dead and were similarly adorned with charms. In the
course of the daily service in the Egyptian temples an
important ceremony was "dressing the god with white,
green, bright-red, and dark-red sashes, and supplying two kinds of ointment and black and green eye paint". 1 In
the word-picture of the Aryo-Indian Varuna's heaven in
the MahAbhdrata the deity is depicted "attired in celestial robes and decked with celestial ornaments and jewels ".
His attendants, the Adityas, appear "adorned with celestial
garlands and perfumed with celestial scents and besmeared
with paste of celestial fragrance".
2 Apparently the "paste", like the face paint of the Babylonians and
Egyptians, had protective qualities. The Picts of Scotland may have similarly painted themselves to charm their
bodies against magical influences and the weapons of their
enemies. A painted man was probably regarded as one
who was likely to have good luck, being guarded against bad luck.
Weapons and implements were also laid in the
Sumerian graves, indicating a belief that the spirits of the dead could not only protect themselves against their enemies but also provide themselves with food. The
funerary gifts of fish-hooks suggests that spirits were expected to catch fish and thus obtain clean food, instead

Some bodies which were laid in Sumerian graves were
wrapped up in reed matting, a custom which suggests that the reeds afforded protection or imparted magical powers. Magical ceremonies were performed in Baby
lonian reed huts. As we have seen, Ea revealed the
" purpose " of the gods, when they resolved to send a
flood, by addressing the reed hut in which Pir-napishtim
lay asleep. Possibly it was believed that the dead might
also have visions in their dreams which would reveal the
" purpose " of demons who were preparing to attack them.
In Syria it was customary to wrap the dead in a sheep
skin. 1 As priests and gods were clad in the skins of
animals from which their powers were derived, it is prob
able that the dead were similarly supposed to receive
inspiration in their skin coverings. The Highland seer was wrapped in a bull's skin and left all night beside a
stream so as to obtain knowledge of the future. This
was a form of the Taghairm ceremony, which is referred
to by Scott in his " Lady of the Lake ".2 The belief in
the magical influence of sacred clothing gave origin to
the priestly robes. When David desired to ascertain what
Saul intended to do he said, "Bring hither the ephod".

Then he came to know that his enemy had resolved to
attack Keilah.1 Elisha became a prophet when he re
ceived Elijah's mantle. 2 Sometimes the bodies of the Sumerians were placed
in sarcophagi of clay. The earlier type was of "bath
tub "
shape, round and flat-bottomed, with a rounded lid,
while the later was the " slipper-shaped coffin ", which was ornamented with charms. There is a close resemblance
between the " bath-tub " coffins of Sumeria and the
Egyptian pottery coffins of oval shape found in Third and Fourth Dynasty tombs in rock chambers near Nuerat.
Certain designs on wooden coffins, and tombs as early as
the First Dynasty, have direct analogies in Babylonia.3
No great tombs were erected in Sumeria. The
coffins were usually laid in brick vaults below dwellings,
or below temples, or in trenches outside the city walls.
On the " stele of victory ", which belongs to the period of Eannatum, patesi of Lagash, the dead bodies on the battlefield are piled up in pairs quite naked, and earth
is being heaped over them ; this is a specimen of mound
burial.
According to Herodotus the Babylonians "buried their dead in honey, and had funeral lamentations like the
Egyptians ",4 The custom of preserving the body in this manner does not appear to have been an ancient one, and
may have resulted from cultural contact with the Nile
valley during the late Assyrian period. So long as the bones were undisturbed, the spirit was supposed to be assured of rest in the Underworld. This archaic belief
was widespread, and finds an echo in the quaint lines
over Shakespeare's grave in Stratford church :
1 / Samuel, xxiii, 9-11. 2 / Kings, xix, 19 and 2 Kings, ii, 13-15.

DELUGE LEGEND 215
Good friend, for Jesus' sake forbeare
To dig the dust enclosed heare ; Blest be the man that spares these stones,
And curst be he that moves my bones.
In Babylonia the return of the spirits of the dead was
greatly dreaded. Ishtar once uttered the terrible threat:
"I will cause the dead to rise ; they will then eat and live.
The dead will be more numerous than the living." When
a foreign country was invaded, it was a common custom to break open the tombs and scatter the bones they con
tained. Probably it was believed, when such acts of vandalism were committed, that the offended spirits would
plague their kinsfolk. Ghosts always haunted the homes
they once lived in, and were as malignant as demons. It
is significant to find in this connection that the bodies of
enemies who were slain in battle were not given decent
burial, but mutilated and left for birds and beasts of prey to devour.
The demons that plagued the dead might also attack
the living. A fragmentary narrative, which used to be
referred to as the " Cuthean Legend of Creation ",
a
and has been shown by Mr. L. W. King to have no connection with the struggle between Merodach and the
dragon,2 deals with a war waged by an ancient king
against a horde of evil spirits, led by " the lord of heights,
lord of the Anunaki (earth spirits) ". Some of the supernatural warriors had bodies like birds; others had "raven
faces ", and all had been " suckled by Tiamat ".
For three years the king sent out great armies to attack the demons, but "none returned alive ". Then he decided to go forth himself to save his country from
destruction. So he prepared for the conflict, and took

the precaution of performing elaborate and therefore costly
religious rites so as to secure the co-operation of the gods.
His expedition was successful, for he routed the super
natural army. On his return home, he recorded his great
victory on tablets which were placed in the shrine of
Nergal at Cuthah.
This myth may be an echo of Nergal's raid against Eresh-ki-gal. Or, being associated with Cuthah, it may
have been composed to encourage burial in that city's sacred cemetery, which had been cleared by the famous old king of the evil demons which tormented the dead
and made seasonal attacks against the living.

THE rise of Babylon inaugurated a new era in the history of Western Asia. Coincidentally the political power of the Sumerians came to an end. It had been paralysed
by the Elamites, who, towards the close of the Dynasty of
I sin, successfully overran the southern district and endeavoured to extend their sway over the whole valley.
Two Elamite kings, Warad-Sin and his brother Rim-Sin,
struggled with the rulers of Babylon for supremacy, and for a time it appeared as if the intruders from the East
were to establish themselves permanently as a military aristocracy over Sumer and Akkad. But the Semites were strongly reinforced by new settlers of the same
blended stock who swarmed from the land of the Amo
rites. Once again Arabia was pouring into Syria vast
hordes of its surplus population, with the result that ethnic disturbances were constant and widespread. This migration is termed the Canaanitic or Amorite: it flowed
into Mesopotamia and across Assyria, while it supplied
217



2i 8 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
the "driving power" which secured the ascendancy of
the Hammurabi Dynasty at Babylon. Indeed, the ruling family which came into prominence there is believed to have been of Canaanitic origin.
Once Babylon became the metropolis it retained its
pre-eminence until the end. Many political changes took
place during its long and chequered history, but no rival city in the south ever attained to its splendour and greatness. Whether its throne was occupied by Amorite or
Kassite, Assyrian or Chaldean, it was invariably found to be the most effective centre of administration for the
lower Tigro-Euph rates valley. Some of the Kassite
monarchs, however, showed a preference for Nippur.
Of its early history little is known. It was overshadowed in turn by Kish and Umma, Lagash and Erech,
and may have been little better than a great village when
Akkad rose into prominence. Sargon I, the royal gardener, appears to have interested himself in its development, for it was recorded that he cleared its trenches
and strengthened its fortifications. The city occupied
a strategic position, and probably assumed importance on that account as well as a trading and industrial centre.
Considerable wealth had accumulated at Babylon when
the Dynasty of Ur reached the zenith of its power. It is
recorded that King Dungi plundered its famous " Temple
of the High Head", E-sagila, which some identify with
the Tower of Babel, so as to secure treasure for Ea's
temple at Eridu, which he specially favoured. His van
dalistic raid, like that of the Gutium, or men of Kutu,
was remembered for long centuries afterwards, and the city god was invoked at the time to cut short his days.
No doubt, Hammurabi's Babylon closely resembled
the later city so vividly described by Greek writers,
although it was probably not of such great dimensions.



BUILDINGS AND LAWS OF BABYLON 219
According to Herodotus, it occupied an exact square on the broad plain, and had a circumference of sixty of our
miles. " While such is its size/' the historian wrote,
"in magnificence there is no other city that approaches to it." Its walls were eighty-seven feet thick and three
hundred and fifty feet high, and each side of the square
was fifteen miles in length. The whole city was surrounded by a deep, broad canal or moat, and the river
Euphrates ran through it.
"Here", continued Herodotus, U I may not omit to
tell the use to which the mould dug out of the great moat was turned, nor the manner in which the wall was
wrought. As fast as they dug the moat the soil which
they got from the cutting was made into bricks, and when a sufficient number were completed they baked the
bricks in kilns. Then they set to building, and began with bricking the borders of the moat, after which they
proceeded to construct the wall itself, using throughout
for their cement hot bitumen, and interposing a layer of
wattled reeds at every thirtieth course of the bricks. On
the top, along the edges of the wall, they constructed
buildings of a single chamber facing one another, leaving between them room for a four-horse chariot to turn. In
the circuit of the wall are a hundred gates, all of brass,
with brazen lintels and side posts."
1 These were the
gates referred to by Isaiah when God called Cyrus :
I will loose the loins of kings, to open before him the two
leaved gates; and the gates shall not be shut: I will go before
thee, and make the crooked places straight; I will break in pieces the gates of brass, and cut in sunder the bars of iron.2
The outer wall was the main defence of the city, but there was also an inner wall less thick but not much
1 Hcrodofus, book i, 179 (Rawlinson's translation). s Isaiah^ xlv, i, 2. (0042) 17



220 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
inferior in strength. In addition, a fortress stood in each
division of the city. The king's palace and the temple of Bel Merodach were surrounded by walls.
All the main streets were perfectly straight, and each
crossed the city from gate to gate, a distance of fifteen
miles, half of them being interrupted by the river, which had to be ferried. As there were twenty-five gates on
each side of the outer wall, the great thoroughfares numbered fifty in all, and there were six hundred and seventysix squares, each over two miles in circumference. From
Herodotus we gather that the houses were three or four
stories high, suggesting that the tenement system was
not unknown, and according to Q. Curtius, nearly half
of the area occupied by the city was taken up by gardens within the squares. In Greek times Babylon was famous for the hanging
or terraced gardens of the "new palace ", which had been
erected by Nebuchadnezzar II. These occupied a square which was more than a quarter of a mile in circumference.
Great stone terraces, resting on arches, rose up like a giant stairway to a height of about three hundred and
fifty feet, and the whole structure was strengthened by a surrounding wall over twenty feet in thickness. So
deep were the layers of mould on each terrace that fruit
trees were grown amidst the plants of luxuriant foliage
and the brilliant Asian flowers. Water for irrigating the
gardens was raised from the river by a mechanical con
trivance to a great cistern situated on the highest terrace,
and it was prevented from leaking out of the soil by
layers of reeds and bitumen and sheets of lead. Spacious
apartments, luxuriously furnished and decorated, were constructed in the spaces between the arches and were
festooned by flowering creepers. A broad stairway ascended from terrace to terrace.



BUILDINGS AND LAWS OF BABYLON 221
The old palace stood in a square nearly four miles in
circumference, and was strongly protected by three walls,
which were decorated by sculptures in low relief, representing battle scenes and scenes of the chase and royal ceremonies. Winged bulls with human heads guarded
the main entrance.
Another architectural feature of the city was E-sagila,
the temple of Bel Merodach, known to the Greeks as
" Jupiter-Belus". The high wall which enclosed it had
gates of solid brass. "In the middle of the precinct",
wrote Herodotus, " there was a tower of solid masonry, a
furlong in length and breadth, upon which was raised a second tower, and on that a third, and so on up to eight.
The ascent to the top is on the outside, by a path which
winds round all the towers. When one is about halfway
up, one finds a resting-place and seats, where persons are
wont to sit some time on their way to the summit. On
the topmost tower there is a spacious temple, and inside
the temple stands a couch of unusual size, richly adorned, with a golden table by its side. There is no statue of
any kind set up in the place, nor is the chamber occupied
of nights by anyone but a single native woman, who, as the Chaldseans, the priests of this god, affirm, is chosen for
himself by the deity out of all the women of the land."
A woman who was the "wife of Amon" also slept in
that god's temple at Thebes in Egypt. A similar custom was observed in Lycia.
" Below, in the same precinct," continued Herodotus,
" there is a second temple, in which is a sitting figure of
Jupiter, all of gold. Before the figure stands a large golden table, and the throne whereon it sits, and the base
on which the throne is placed, are likewise of pure
gold. . . . Outside the temple are two altars, one of
solid gold, on which it is only lawful to offer sucklings ;



222 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
the other, a common altar, but of great size, on which the full-grown animals are sacrificed. It is also on the
great altar that the Chaldaeans burn the frankincense,
which is offered to the amount of a thousand talents'
weight, every year, at the festival of the god. In the
time of Cyrus there was likewise in this temple a figure
of a man, twelve cubits high, entirely of solid gold. . . .
Besides the ornaments which I have mentioned, there
are a large number of private offerings in this holy
precinct."
l
The city wall and river gates were closed every night, and when Babylon was besieged the people were able to
feed themselves. The gardens and small farms were
irrigated by canals, and canals also controlled the flow of
the river Euphrates. A great dam had been formed above the town to store the surplus water during inunda
tion and increase the supply when the river sank to its
lowest.
In Hammurabi's time the river was crossed by ferry
boats, but long ere the Greeks visited the city a great
bridge had been constructed. So completely did the fierce
Sennacherib destroy the city, that most of the existing ruins date from the period of Nebuchadnezzar II.2
Our knowledge of the social life of Babylon and the
territory under its control is derived chiefly from the Hammurabi Code of laws, of which an almost complete copy was discovered at Susa, towards the end of 1901,
by the De Morgan expedition. The laws were inscribed on a stele of black diorite 7 ft. 3 in. high, with a circum
ference at the base of 6 ft. 2 in. and at the top of 5 ft.
4 in. This important relic of an ancient law-abiding people had been broken in three pieces, but when these

STELE OF HAMMURABI, WITH CODE OF LAWS"

BUILDINGS AND LAWS OF BABYLON 223
were joined together it was found that the text was not
much impaired. On one side are twenty-eight columns and on the other sixteen. Originally there were in all
nearly 4000 lines of inscriptions, but five columns, comprising about 300 lines, had been erased to give space,
it is conjectured, for the name of the invader who carried
the stele away, but unfortunately the record was never made. On the upper part of the stele, which is now one of
the treasures of the Louvre, Paris, King Hammurabi
salutes, with his right hand reverently upraised, the sun god Shamash, seated on his throne, at the summit of
E-sagila, by whom he is being presented with the stylus with which to inscribe the legal code. Both figures are
heavily bearded, but have shaven lips and chins. The god wears a conical headdress and a flounced robe suspended
from his left shoulder, while the king has assumed a
round dome-shaped hat and a flowing garment which almost sweeps the ground. It is gathered from the Code that there were three
chief social grades the aristocracy, which included land
owners, high officials and administrators; the freemen, who
might be wealthy merchants or small landholders; and
the slaves. The fines imposed for a given offence upon
wealthy men were much heavier than those imposed upon the poor. Lawsuits were heard in courts. Witnesses
were required to tell the truth, "affirming before the god
what they knew", and perjurers were severely dealt with;
a man who gave false evidence in connection with a capital
charge was put to death. A strict watch was also kept over the judges, and if one was found to have willingly
convicted a prisoner on insufficient evidence he was fined
and degraded. Theft was regarded as a heinous crime, and was invari



224 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
ably punished by death. Thieves included those who made
purchases from minors or slaves without the sanction of elders or trustees. Sometimes the accused was given the
alternative of paying a fine, which might exceed by ten or even thirty fold the value of the article or animal he had
appropriated. It was imperative that lost property should be restored. If the owner of an article of which he had
been wrongfully deprived found it in possession of a man
who declared that he had purchased it from another, evi
dence was taken in court. When it happened that the
seller was proved to have been the thief, the capital
penalty was imposed. On the other hand, the alleged purchaser was dealt with in like manner if he failed to
prove his case. Compensation for property stolen by a
brigand was paid by the temple, and the heirs of a man
slain by a brigand within the city had to be compensated
by the local authority.
Of special interest are the laws which relate to the
position of women. In this connection reference may
first be made to the marriage-by-auction custom, which
Herodotus described as follows : " Once a year in each
village the maidens of age to marry were collected all
together into one place, while the men stood round them
in a circle. Then a herald called up the damsels one
by one, and offered them for sale. He began with
the most beautiful. When she was sold for no small
sum of money, he offered for sale the one who came
next to her in beauty. All of them were sold to be
wives. The richest of the Babylonians who wished to
wed bid against each other for the loveliest maidens, while
the humbler wife - seekers, who were indifferent about
beauty, took the more homely damsels with marriage portions. For the custom was that when the herald
had gone through the whole , number of the beautiful



BUILDINGS AND LAWS OF BABYLON 225
damsels, he should then call up the ugliest a cripple, if there chanced to be one and offer her to the men,
asking who would agree to take her with the smallest
marriage portion. And the man who offered to take
the smallest sum had her assigned to him. The marriage portions were furnished by the money paid for the beauti
ful damsels, and thus the fairer maidens portioned out
the uglier. No one was allowed to give his daughter in
marriage to the man of his choice, nor might anyone carry
away the damsel whom he had purchased without finding
bail really and truly to make her his wife; if, however, it turned out that they did not agree, the money might be
paid back. All who liked might come, even from distant
villages, and bid for the women/ 11 This custom is mentioned by other writers, but it is
impossible to ascertain at what period it became prevalent
in Babylonia and by whom it was introduced. Herodotus
understood that it obtained also in " the Illyrian tribe of
the Eneti", which was reputed to have entered Italy with
Antenor after the fall of Troy, and has been identified
with the Venetians of later times. But the ethnic clue
thus afforded is exceedingly vague. There is no direct
reference to the custom in the Hammurabi Code, which
reveals a curious blending of the principles of " Father
right
1 ' and "Mother right". A girl was subject to her father's will; he could dispose of her as he thought
best, and she always remained a member of his family; after marriage she was known as the daughter of so and so rather than the wife of so and so. But marriage
brought her freedom and the rights of citizenship. The power vested in her father was never transferred to her husband.
A father had the right to select a suitable spouse for
1 Herodotus, book i, 196 (Ravvlinson's translation).



226 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
his daughter, and she could not marry without his con
sent. That this law did not prevent "love matches" is
made evident by the fact that provision was made in the
Code for the marriage of a free woman with a male slave, part of whose estate in the event of his wife's death could
be claimed by his master.
When a betrothal was arranged, the father fixed the "bride price ", which was paid over before the contract
could be concluded, and he also provided a dowry. The
amount of the " bride price" might, however, be refunded
to the young couple to give them a start in life. If,
during the interval between betrothal and marriage, the
man "looked upon another woman", and said to his
father-in-law, "I will not marry "your daughter", he forfeited the "bride price" for breach of promise of
marriage.
A
girl might also obtain a limited degree of freedom
by taking vows of celibacy and becoming one of the vestal
virgins, or nuns, who were attached to the temple of the
sun god. She did not, however, live a life of entire
seclusion. If she received her due proportion of her
father's estate, she could make business investments within
certain limits. She was not, for instance, allowed to own a wineshop, and if she even entered one she was burned at the stake. Once she took these vows she had to observe
them until the end of her days. If she married, as she might do to obtain the legal status of a married woman
and enjoy the privileges of that position, she denied her husband conjugal rites, but provided him with a concubine
who might bear him children, as Sarah did to Abraham. These nuns must not be confused with the unmoral
women who were associated with the temples of Ishtar
and other love goddesses of shady repute.
The freedom secured by a married woman had its



BUILDINGS AND LAWS OF BABYLON 227
legal limitations. If she became a widow, for instance, she could not remarry without the consent of a judge,
to whom she was expected to show good cause for the step she proposed to take. Punishments for breaches
of the marriage law were severe. Adultery was a capital
crime; the guilty parties were bound together and thrown into the river. If it happened, however, that the wife of
a prisoner went to reside with another man on account of
poverty, she was acquitted and allowed to return to her husband after his release. In cases where no plea of
poverty could be urged the erring women were drowned.
The wife of a soldier who had been taken prisoner by
an enemy was entitled to a third part of her husband's estate if her son was a minor, the remainder was held
in trust. The husband could enter into possession
of all his property again if he happened to return home. Divorce was easily obtained. A husband might send
his wife away either because she was childless or because
he fell in love with another woman. Incompatibility of
temperament was also recognized as sufficient reason for
separation. A woman might hate her husband and wish
to leave him. " If", the Code sets forth, "she is careful
and is without blame, and is neglected by her husband who has deserted her", she can claim release from the
marriage contract. But if she is found to have another
lover, and is guilty of neglecting her duties, she is liable to be put to death.
A married woman possessed her own property. In
deed, the value of her marriage dowry was always vested in her. When, therefore, she divorced her husband, or was divorced by him, she was entitled to have her dowry
refunded and to return to her father's house. Apparently she could claim maintenance from her father.



228 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
A woman could have only one husband, but a man
could have more than one wife. He might marry a
secondary wife, or concubine, because he was without
offspring, but " the concubine ", the Code lays down,
" shall not rank with the wife ". Another reason for
second marriage recognized by law was a wife's state of
health. In such circumstances a man could not divorce
his sickly wife. He had to support her in his house as
long as she lived.
Children were the heirs of their parents, but if a man
during his lifetime gifted his property to his wife, and confirmed it on "a sealed tablet ", the children could have
no claim, and the widow was entitled to leave her estate
to those of her children she preferred; but she could not
will any portion of it to her brothers. In ordinary cases
the children of a first marriage shared equally the estate
of a father with those of a second marriage. If a slave
bore children to her employer, their right to inheritance
depended on whether or not the father had recognized
them as his offspring during his lifetime. A father might
legally disown his son if the young man was guilty of
criminal practices. The legal rights of a vestal virgin were set forth in detail. If she had received no dowry from her father
when she took vows of celibacy, she could claim after his
death one-third of the portion of a son. She could will
her estate to anyone she favoured, but if she died intestate
her brothers were her heirs. When, however, her estate
consisted of fields or gardens allotted to her by her father,
she could not disinherit her legal heirs. The fields or gar
dens might be worked during her lifetime by her brothers
if they paid rent, or she might employ a manager on the
" share system ".
Vestal virgins and married women were protected



BUILDINGS AND LAWS OF BABYLON 229
against the slanderer. Any man who "pointed the finger
"
against them unjustifiably was charged with the offence
before a judge, who could sentence him to have his fore
head branded. It was not difficult, therefore, in ancient Babylonia to discover the men who made malicious and unfounded statements regarding an innocent woman.
Assaults on women were punished according to the vic
tim's rank; even slaves were protected.
Women appear to have monopolized the drink traffic.
At any rate, there is no reference to male wine sellers. A
female publican had to conduct her business honestly, and was bound to accept a legal tender. If she refused corn and demanded silver, when the value of the silver by
"grand weight
" was below the price of corn, she was
prosecuted and punished by being thrown into the water.
Perhaps she was simply ducked. As much may be in
ferred from the fact that when she was found guilty of
allowing rebels to meet in her house, she was put to death.
The land laws were strict and exacting. A tenant
could be penalized for not cultivating his holding pro
perly. The rent paid was a proportion of the crop, but
the proportion could be fixed according to the average yield of a district, so that a careless or inefficient tenant
had to bear the brunt of his neglect or want of skill.
The punishment for allowing a field to lie fallow was to
make a man hoe and sow it and then hand it over to
his landlord, and this applied even to a man who leased unreclaimed land which he had contracted to cultivate.
Damage done to fields by floods after the rent was paid
was borne by the cultivator; but if it occurred before the
corn was reaped the landlord's share was calculated in
proportion to the amount of the yield which was recovered. Allowance was also made for poor harvests, when the



230 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
shortage was not due to the neglect of the tenant, but to other causes, and no interest was paid for borrowed
money even if the farm suffered from the depredations
of the tempest god; the moneylender had to share risks
with borrowers. Tenants who neglected their dykes,
however, were not exempted from their legal liabilities, and their whole estates could be sold to reimburse their
creditors.
The industrious were protected against the careless.
Men who were negligent about controlling the water
supply, and caused floods by opening irrigation ditches which damaged the crops of their neighbours, had to pay /or the losses sustained, the damages being estimated
according to the average yield of a district. A tenant
who allowed his sheep to stray on to a neighbour's pasture had to pay a heavy fine in corn at the harvest
season, much in excess of the value of the grass cropped
by his sheep. Gardeners were similarly subject to strict laws. All business contracts had to be conducted accord
ing to the provisions of the Code, and in every case it was necessary that a proper record should be made on clay tablets. As a rule a dishonest tenant or trader had
to pay sixfold the value of the sum under dispute if the
judge decided in court against his claim.
The law of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
was strictly observed in Babylonia. A freeman who destroyed an eye of a freeman had one of his own destroyed; if he broke a bone, he had a bone broken.
Fines were imposed, however, when a slave was injured.
For striking a gentleman, a commoner received sixty
lashes, and the son who smote his father had his hands
cut off. A slave might have his ears cut off for assaulting
his master's son.
Doctors must have found their profession an extremely



BUILDINGS AND LAWS OF BABYLON 231
risky one. No allowance was made for what is nowadays
known as a "professional error ". A doctor's hands were cut off if he opened a wound with a metal knife and his
patient afterwards died, or if a man lost his eye as the
result of an operation. A slave who died under a doctor's
hands had to be replaced by a slave, and if a slave lost his eye, the doctor had to pay half the man's market
value to the owner. Professional fees were fixed accord
ing to a patient's rank. Gentlemen had to pay five shekels
of silver to a doctor who set a bone or restored diseased
flesh, commoners three shekels, and masters for their
slaves two shekels. There was also a scale of fees for
treating domesticated animals, and it was not over
generous. An unfortunate surgeon who undertook to
treat an ox or ass suffering from a severe wound had to
pay a quarter of its price to its owner if it happened, to
die. A shrewd farmer who was threatened with the loss of an animal must have been extremely anxious to engage
the services of a surgeon.
It is not surprising, after reviewing this part of the Hammurabi Code, to find Herodotus stating bluntly that
the Babylonians had no physicians. "When a man is ill", he wrote, "they lay him in the public square, and the passers-by come up to him, and if they have ever had
his disease themselves, or have known anyone who has
suffered from it, they give him advice, recommending
him to do whatever they found good in their own case,
or in the case known to them; and no one is allowed to
pass the sick man in silence without asking him what
his ailment is." One might imagine that Hammurabi
had legislated the medical profession out of existence, were it not that letters have been found in the Assyrian

sicians were held in high repute. It is improbable, how

ever, that they were numerous. The risks they ran in
Babylonia may account for their ultimate disappearance
in that country.
No doubt patients received some benefit from ex
posure in the streets in the sunlight and fresh air, and perhaps, too, from some of the old wives' remedies which
were gratuitously prescribed by passers-by. In Egypt, where certain of the folk cures were recorded on papyri,
quite effective treatment was occasionally given, although the "medicines" were exceedingly repugnant as a rule; ammonia, for instance, was taken with the organic substances found in farmyards. Elsewhere some wonderful
instances of excellent folk cures have come to light,
especially among isolated peoples, who have received
them interwoven in their immemorial traditions. A medi
cal man who has investigated this interesting subject in the Scottish Highlands has shown that "the simple obser
vation of the people was the starting-point of our fuller
knowledge, however complete we may esteem it to be ".
For dropsy and heart troubles, foxglove, broom tops, and
juniper berries, which have reputations "as old as the
hills ", are " the most reliable medicines in our scientific
armoury at the present time ". These discoveries of the
ancient folks have been "merely elaborated in later days".
Ancient cures for indigestion are still in use. "Tar water,
which was a remedy for chest troubles, especially for those of a consumptive nature, has endless imitations in our
day"; it was also "the favourite remedy for skin diseases".
No doubt the present inhabitants of Babylonia, who utilize
bitumen as a germicide, are perpetuating an ancient folk custom. This medical man who is being quoted adds: "The
whole matter may be summed up, that we owe infinitely
more to the simple nature study of our people in the



BUILDINGS AND LAWS OF BABYLON 233
great affair of health than we owe to all the later
science." 1
Herodotus, commenting on the custom of patients
taking a census of folk cures in the streets, said it was
one of the wisest institutions of the Babylonian people.
It is to be regretted that he did not enter into details
regarding the remedies which were in greatest favour in his day. His data would have been useful for compara
tive purposes. So far as can be gathered from the clay tablets, faith cures were not unknown, and there was a good deal of
quackery. If surgery declined, as a result of the severe restrictions which hampered progress in an honourable
profession, magic flourished like tropical fungi. Indeed, the worker of spells was held in high repute, and his
operations were in most cases allowed free play. There
are only two paragraphs in the Hammurabi Code which
deal with magical practices. It is set forth that if one
man cursed another and the curse could not be justified,
the perpetrator of it must suffer the death penalty. Pro
vision was also made for discovering whether a spell had
been legally imposed or not. The victim was expected to plunge himself in a holy river. If the river carried
him away it was held as proved that he deserved his
punishment, and " the layer of the spell
" was given
possession of the victim's house. A man who could swim was deemed to be innocent ; he claimed the resi
dence of " the layer of the spell ", who was promptly put
to death. With this interesting glimpse of ancient superstition the famous Code opens, and then strikes a modern
note by detailing the punishments for perjury and the unjust administration of law in the courts.

234 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
The poor sufferers who gathered at street corners in
Babylon to make mute appeal for cures believed that they
were possessed by evil spirits. Germs of disease were
depicted by lively imaginations as invisible demons, who
derived nourishment from the human body. When a patient was wasted with disease, growing thinner and weaker and more bloodless day by day, it was believed
that a merciless vampire was sucking his veins and de
vouring his flesh. It had therefore to be expelled by
performing a magical ceremony and repeating a magical
formula. The demon was either driven or enticed away.
A magician had to decide in the first place what par
ticular demon was working evil. He then compelled its attention and obedience by detailing its attributes and
methods of attack, and perhaps by naming it. Thereafter
he suggested how it should next act by releasing a raven, so that it might soar towards the clouds like that bird, or
by offering up a sacrifice which it received for nourish
ment and as compensation. Another popular method
was to fashion a waxen figure of the patient and prevail upon the disease demon to enter it. The figure was
then carried away to be thrown in the river or burned
in a fire.
Occasionally a quite effective cure was included in
the ceremony. As much is suggested by the magical treatment of toothache. First of all the magician identi
fied the toothache demon as " the worm ". Then he re
cited its history, which is as follows : After Anu created
the heavens, the heavens created the earth, the earth
created the rivers, the rivers created the canals, the canals
created the marshes, and last of all the marshes created
"the worm".
This display of knowledge compelled the worm to listen, and no doubt the patient was able to indicate to



BUILDINGS AND LAWS OF BABYLON 235
what degree it gave evidence of its agitated mind. The
magician continued :
Came the worm and wept before Shamash, Before Ea came her tears :
" What wilt thou give me for my food,
What wilt thou give me to devour?"
One of the deities answered : " I will give thee dried
bones and scented . . . wood"; but the hungry worm
protested :
" Nay, what are these dried bones of thine to me?
Let me drink among the teeth ;
And set me on the gums That I may devour the blood of the teeth,
And of their gums destroy their strength
Then shall I hold the bolt of the door."
The magician provided food for " the worm ", and
the following is his recipe : " Mix beer, the plant sa-kilbir, and oil together ; put it on the tooth and repeat In
cantation." No doubt this mixture soothed the pain, and
the sufferer must have smiled gladly when the magician
finished his incantation by exclaiming:
" So must thou say this, O Worm !
May Ea smite thee with the might of his fist." l
Headaches were no doubt much relieved when damp
cloths were wrapped round a patient's head and scented
wood was burned beside him, while the magician, in
whom so much faith was reposed, droned out a mystical
incantation. The curative water was drawn from the confluence of two streams and was sprinkled with much
ceremony. In like manner the evil-eye curers, who still
1 Translations by R. C. Thompson in The Devils and Spirits of Babylon, vol. i, pp. Ixiii ft !cq.

236 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
operate in isolated districts in these islands, draw water
from under bridges " over which the dead and the living
pass ",* and mutter charms and lustrate victims. Headaches were much dreaded by the Babylonians.
They were usually the first symptoms of fevers, and the
demons who caused them were supposed to be blood
thirsty and exceedingly awesome. According to the
charms, these invisible enemies of man were of the brood
of Nergal. No house could be protected against them. They entered through keyholes and chinks of doors and
windows ; they crept like serpents and stank like mice ;
they had lolling tongues like hungry dogs. Magicians baffled the demons by providing a charm. If a patient "touched iron" meteoric iron, which was
the " metal of heaven " relief could be obtained. Or,
perhaps, the sacred water would dispel the evil one ; as
the drops trickled from the patient's face, so would the
fever spirit trickle away. When a pig was offered up in
sacrifice as a substitute for a patient, the wicked spirit was
commanded to depart and allow a kindly spirit to take
its place an indication that the Babylonians, like the
Germanic peoples, believed that they were guarded by
spirits who brought good luck.
The numerous incantations which were inscribed on
clay tablets and treasured in libraries, do not throw much
light on the progress of medical knowledge, for the
genuine folk cures were regarded as of secondary importance, and were not as a rule recorded. But these
metrical compositions are of special interest, in so far as they indicate how poetry originated and achieved wide
spread popularity among ancient peoples. Like the religious dance, the earliest poems were used for magical
purposes. They were composed in the first place by men
1 Bridges which lead to graveyards.



BUILDINGS AND LAWS OF BABYLON 237
and women who were supposed to be inspired in the
literal sense ; that is, possessed by spirits. Primitive
man associated "spirit" with " breath ", which was the
" air of life ", and identical with wind. The poetical
magician- drew in a " spirit ", and thus received inspiration, as he stood on some sacred spot on the mountain
summit, amidst forest solitudes, beside a whispering stream, or on the sounding shore. As Burns has sung :
The muse, nae poet ever fand her, Till by himseP he learn'd to wander,
Adown some trottin' burn's meander, An' no think lang :
O sweet to stray, an' pensive ponder
A heart-felt sang!
Or, perhaps, the bard received inspiration by drinking magic water from the fountain called Hippocrene, or the skaldic mead which dripped from the moon.
The ancient poet did not sing for the mere love of
singing: he knew nothing about "Art for Art's sake".
His object in singing appears to have been intensely
practical. The world was inhabited by countless hordes
of spirits, which were believed to be ever exercising them
selves to influence mankind. The spirits caused suffer
ing ; they slew victims ; they brought misfortune ; they
were also the source of good or " luck ". Man regarded
spirits emotionally; he conjured them with emotion; he warded off their attacks with emotion ; and his emotions
were given rhythmical expression by means of metrical magical charms.
Poetic imagery had originally a magical significance ; if the ocean was compared to a dragon, it was because it
was supposed to be inhabited by a storm-causing dragon ; the wind whispered because a spirit whispered in it.



238 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
Love lyrics were charms to compel the love god to
wound or possess a maiden's heart to fill it, as an Indian
charm sets forth, with "the yearning of the Apsaras
(fairies) "; satires conjured up evil spirits to injure a victim ; and heroic narratives chanted at graves were state
ments made to the god of battle, so that he might award
the mighty dead by transporting him to the Valhal of
Odin or Swarga of Indra.
Similarly, music had magical origin as an imitation of the voices of spirits of the piping birds who were
" Fates ", of the wind high and low, of the thunder roll,
of the bellowing sea. So the god Pan piped on his reed bird-like notes, Indra blew his thunder horn, Thor used
his hammer like a drumstick, Neptune imitated on his "wreathed horn" the voice of the deep, the Celtic oak
god Dagda twanged his windy wooden harp, and Angus, the Celtic god of spring and love, came through budding forest ways with a silvern harp which had strings of gold,
echoing the tuneful birds, the purling streams, the whispering winds, and the rustling of scented fir and blossom
ing thorn.
Modern-day poets and singers, who voice their moods
and cast the spell of their moods over readers and
audiences, are the representatives of ancient magicians
who believed that moods were caused by the spirits
which possessed them the rhythmical wind spirits, those harpers of the forest and songsters of ocean.
The following quotations from Mr. R. C. Thompson's
translations of Babylonian charms will serve to illustrate
their poetic qualities :
Fever like frost hath come upon the land.
Fever hath blown upon the man as the wind blast, It hath smitten the man and humbled his pride.



BUILDINGS AND LAWS OF BABYLON 239
Headache lieth like the stars of heaven in the desert and hath no
praise ; Pain in the head and shivering like a scudding cloud turn unto the form of man.
Headache whose course like the dread windstorm none knoweth.
Headache roareth over the desert, blowing like the wind,
Flashing like lightning, it is loosed above and below, It cutteth off him, who feareth not his god, like a reed . . . From amid mountains it hath descended upon the land.
Headache ... a rushing hag-demon,
Granting no rest, nor giving kindly sleep . . . Whose shape is as the whirlwind.
Its appearance is as the darkening heavens,
And its face as the deep shadow of the forest.
Sickness . . . breaking the fingers as a rope of wind . . .
Flashing like a heavenly star, it cometh like the dew.
These early poets had no canons of Art, and there
were no critics to disturb their meditations. Many singers
had to sing and die ere a critic could find much to say.
In ancient times, therefore, poets had their Golden Age
they were a law unto themselves. Even the "minors"
were influential members of society.

SUN worship came into prominence in its most fully developed form during the obscure period which followed the decline of the Dynasty of Ism. This was probably
due to the changed political conditions which brought about the ascendancy for a time of Larsa, the seat of the Sumerian sun cult, and of Sippar, the seat of the Akkadian sun cult. Larsa was selected as the capital of the Ela
mite conquerors, while their rivals, the Amorites, appear to have first established their power at Sippar.
Babbar, the sun god of Sippar, whose Semitic name was Shamash, must have been credited with the early
successes of the Amorites, who became domiciled under
his care, and it was possibly on that account that the ruling
family subsequently devoted so much attention to his
worship in Merodach's city of Babylon, where a sun temple was erected, and Shamash received devout recog
240



THE GOLDEN AGE OF BABYLONIA 241
nition as an abstract deity of righteousness and law, who
reflected the ideals of well organized and firmly governed communities.
The first Amoritic king was Sumu-abum, but little is
known regarding him except that he reigned at Sippar.
He was succeeded by Sumu-la-ilu, a deified monarch,
who moved from Sippar to Babylon, the great wall of
which he either repaired or entirely reconstructed in his
fifth year. With these two monarchs began the brilliant
Hammurabi, or First Dynasty of Babylonia, which endured
for three centuries. Except Sumu-abum, who seems to
stand alone, all its kings belonged to the same family, and son succeeded father in unbroken succession.
Sumu-la-ilu was evidently a great general and conqueror of the type of Thothmes III of Egypt. His
empire, it is believed, included the rising city states of Assyria, and extended southward as far as ancient Lagash.
Of special interest on religious as well as political grounds was his association with Kish. That city had
become the stronghold of a rival family of Amoritic kings,
some of whom were powerful enough to assert their
independence. They formed the Third Dynasty of Kish.
The local god was Zamama, the Tammuz-like deity, who,
like Nin-Girsu of Lagash, was subsequently identified
with Merodach of Babylon. But prominence was also
given to the moon god Nannar, to whom a temple had been erected, a fact which suggests that sun worship was not more pronounced among the Semites than the
Arabians, and may not, indeed, have been of Semitic
origin at all. Perhaps the lunar temple was a relic of the
influential Dynasty of Ur.
Sumu-la-ilu attacked and captured Kish, but did not
slay Bunutakhtunila, its king, who became his vassal. Under the overlordship of Sumu-la-ilu, the next ruler of



242 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
Kish, whose name was Immerum, gave prominence to the
public worship of Shamash. Politics and religion went
evidently hand in hand. Sumu-la-ilu strengthened the defences of Sippar, re
stored the wall and temple of Cuthah, and promoted the
worship of Merodach and his consort Zerpanitum at
Babylon. He was undoubtedly one of the forceful personalities of his dynasty. His son, Zabium, had a short
but successful reign, and appears to have continued the
policy of his father in consolidating the power of Babylon
and securing the allegiance of subject cities. He enlarged Merodach's temple, E-sagila, restored the Kish
temple of Zamama, and placed a golden image of himself
in the temple of the sun god at Sippar. Apil-Sin, his son, surrounded Babylon with a new wall, erected a
temple to Ishtar, and presented a throne of gold and silver to Shamash in that city, while he also strengthened
Borsippa, renewed NergaTs temple at Cuthah, and dug
canals.
The next monarch was Sin-muballit, son of Apil-Sin
and father of Hammurabi. He engaged himself in ex
tending and strengthening the area controlled by Babylon
by building city fortifications and improving the irrigation system. It is recorded that he honoured Shamash with
the gift of a shrine and a golden altar adorned with jewels.
Like Sumu-la-ilu, he was a great battle lord, and was
specially concerned in challenging the supremacy of Elam in Sumeria and in the western land of the Amorites.
For a brief period a great conqueror, named RimAnum, had established an empire which extended from
Kish to Larsa, but little is known regarding him. Then several kings flourished at Larsa who claimed to have
ruled over Ur. The first monarch with an Elamite name who became connected with Larsa was Kudur



THE GOLDEN AGE OF BABYLONIA 243
Mabug, son of Shimti-Shilkhak, the father of Warad-Sin and Rim-Sin. It was from one of these Elamite monarchs that Sin
muballit captured Isin, and probably the Elamites were
also the leaders of the army of Ur which he had routed
before that event took place. He was not successful,
however, in driving the Elamites from the land, and
possibly he arranged with them a treaty of peace or perhaps of alliance.
Much controversy has been waged over the historical
problems connected with this disturbed age. The records
are exceedingly scanty, because the kings were not in the
habit of commemorating battles which proved disastrous
to them, and their fragmentary references to successes are
not sufficient to indicate what permanent results accrued
from their various campaigns. All we know for certain
is that for a considerable period, extending perhaps over
a century, a tremendous and disastrous struggle was
waged at intervals, which desolated middle Babylonia. At least five great cities were destroyed by fire, as is testified by the evidence accumulated by excavators. These
were Lagash, Umma, Shurruppak, Kisurra, and Adab.
The ancient metropolis of Lagash, whose glory had been
revived by Gudea and his kinsmen, fell soon after the rise
of Larsa, and lay in ruins until the second century B.C.,
when, during the Seleucid Period, it was again occupied
for a time. From its mound at Tello, and the buried
ruins of the other cities, most of the relics of ancient
Sumerian civilization have been recovered.
It was probably during one of the intervals of this
stormy period that the rival kings in Babylonia joined
forces against a common enemy and invaded the Western
Land. Probably there was much unrest there. Great
ethnic disturbances were in progress which were changing



244 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
the political complexion of Western Asia. In addition to
the outpourings of Arabian peoples into Palestine and
Syria, which propelled other tribes to invade Mesopotamia,
northern Babylonia, and Assyria, there was also much unrest all over the wide area to north and west of Elam.
Indeed, the Elamite migration into southern Babylonia may not have been unconnected with the southward drift of
roving bands from Media and the Iranian plateau.
It is believed that these migrations were primarily due
to changing climatic conditions, a prolonged " Dry Cycle" having caused a shortage of herbage, with the result that
pastoral peoples were compelled to go farther and farther afield in quest of "fresh woods and pastures new". Innumerable currents and cross currents were set in motion
once these race movements swept towards settled districts
either to flood them with human waves, or surround them
like islands in the midst of tempest-lashed seas, fretting the frontiers with restless fury, and ever groping for an
inlet through which to flow with irresistible force.
The Elamite occupation of Southern Babylonia appears to have propelled migrations of not inconsiderable
numbers of its inhabitants. No doubt the various
sections moved towards districts which were suitable for
their habits of life. Agriculturists, for instance, must
have shown preference for those areas which were capable
of agricultural development, while pastoral folks sought grassy steppes and valleys, and seafarers the shores of
alien seas.
Northern Babylonia and Assyria probably attracted the tillers of the soil. But the movements of seafarers
must have followed a different route. It is possible that
about this time the Phoenicians began to migrate towards
the "Upper Sea". According to their own traditions
their racial cradle was on the northern shore of the Persian



THE GOLDEN AGE OF BABYLONIA 245
Gulf. So far as we know, they first made their appearance on the Mediterranean coast about 2000 B.C., where
they subsequently entered into competition as sea traders with the manners of ancient Crete. Apparently the
pastoral nomads pressed northward through Meso
potamia and towards Canaan. As much is suggested by
the Biblical narrative which deals with the wanderings of
Terah, Abraham, and Lot. Taking with them their
"flocks and herds and tents", and accompanied by wives,
and families, and servants, they migrated, it is stated, from
the Sumerian city of Ur northwards to Haran "and dwelt there ". After Terah's death the tribe wandered
through Canaan and kept moving southward, unable, it
would seem, to settle permanently in any particular district. At length "there was a famine in the land" an
interesting reference to the " Dry Cycle
" and the
wanderers found it necessary to take refuge for a time in
Egypt. There they appear to have prospered. Indeed, so greatly did their flocks and herds increase that when
they returned to Canaan they found that " the land was
not able to bear them", although the conditions had
improved somewhat during the interval. "There was",
as a result, " strife between the herdmen of Abram's
cattle and the herdmen of Lot's cattle."
It is evident that the area which these pastoral flocks were allowed to occupy must have been strictly circum
scribed, for more than once it is stated significantly that "the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled in the land".
The two kinsmen found it necessary, therefore, to part company. Lot elected to go towards Sodom in the
plain of Jordan, and Abraham then moved towards the
plain of Mamre, the Amorite, in the Hebron district.1
With Mamre, and his brothers, Eshcol and Aner, the
1 Genesis, xii and xiii.



246 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
Hebrew patriarch formed a confederacy for mutual protection. 1
Other tribes which were in Palestine at this period
included the Horites, the Rephaims, the Zuzims, the Zamzummims, and the Emims. These were probably
representatives of the older stocks. Like the Amorites,
the Hittites or " children of Heth " were evidently " late
comers", and conquerors. When Abraham purchased the
burial cave at Hebron, the landowner with whom he had
to deal was one Ephron, son of Zohar, the Hittite.2 This
illuminating statement agrees with what we know regard
ing Hittite expansion about 2000 B.C. The " Hatti " or
" Khatti " had constituted military aristocracies throughout
Syria and extended their influence by forming alliances.
Many of their settlers were owners of estates, and traders
who intermarried with the indigenous peoples and the
Arabian invaders. As has been indicated (Chapter I),
the large-nosed Armenoid section of the Hittite con
federacy appear to have contributed to the racial blend
known vaguely as the Semitic. Probably the particular
group of Amorites with whom Abraham became associated
had those pronounced Armenoid traits which can still be
traced in representatives of the Hebrew people. Of special interest in this connection is Ezekiel's declaration
regarding the ethnics of Jerusalem : "Thy birth and thy nativity", he said, "is of the land of Canaan; thy father was an Amorite, and thy mother an Hittite." 3
It was during Abraham's residence in Hebron that
the Western Land was raided by a confederacy of Baby
lonian and Elamite battle lords. The Biblical narrative
which deals with this episode is of particular interest and
has long engaged the attention of European scholars:
"And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel
1 Geneus, xiv, 13. J lbiJ. y xxiii. * E*tkiel9 xvi, 3.



THE GOLDEN AGE OF BABYLONIA 247
(Hammurabi) king of Shinar (Sumer), Arioch (Eri-aku or Warad-Sin) king of Ellasar (Larsa), Chedor-laomer
(Kudur-Mabug) king of Elam, and Tidal (Tudhula)
king of nations ; that these made war with Bera king
of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab
king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar. All these joined to
gether in the vale of Siddim, which is the salt sea.
Twelve years they served Chedor-laomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled." 1 Apparently the Elamites
had conquered part of Syria after entering southern Babylonia.
Chedor-laomer and his allies routed the Rephaims,
the Zuzims, the Emims, the Horites and others, and
having sacked Sodom and Gomorrah, carried away Lot
and "his goods*'. On hearing of this disaster, Abraham collected a force of three hundred and eighteen men, all
of whom were no doubt accustomed to guerrilla warfare, and delivered a night attack on the tail of the victorious
army which was withdrawing through the area afterwards
allotted to the Hebrew tribe of Dan. The surprise was
complete; Abraham "smote" the enemy and "pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.
And he brought back all the goods, and also brought
again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also,
and the people/' 2
The identification of Hammurabi with Amraphel is
now generally accepted. At first the guttural " h", which
gives the English rendering " Khammurabi ", presented a
serious difficulty, but in time the form " Ammurapi "
which appears on a tablet became known, and the con
clusion was reached that the softer " h " sound was used
and not the guttural. The "1" in the Biblical Amraphel
1 Genesis, xiv, 1-4.. 2 Ibid.) 5-24.



248 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
has suggested " Ammurapi-ilu", " Hammurabi, the god", but it has been argued, on the other hand, that the change may have been due to western habitual phonetic conditions,
or perhaps the slight alteration of an alphabetical sign. Chedor-laomer, identified with Kudur-Mabug, may have
had several local names. One of his sons, either Warad
Sin or Rim-Sin, but probably the former, had his name Semitized as Eri-Aku, and this variant appears in inscrip
tions. "Tidal, king of nations", has not been identified.
The suggestion that he was "King of the Gutium" re
mains in the realm of suggestion. Two late tablets have
fragmentary inscriptions which read like legends with
some historical basis. One mentions Kudur-lahmal
(? Chedor-laomer) and the other gives the form "Kudurlahgumal", and calls him "King of the land of Elam".
Eri-Eaku (?Eri-aku) and Tudhula (? Tidal) are also mentioned. Attacks had been delivered on Babylon, and the
city and its great temple E-sagila were flooded. It is asserted that the Elamites "exercised sovereignty in Baby
lon*' for a period. These interesting tablets have been published by Professor Pinches.
The fact that the four leaders of the expedition to
Canaan are all referred to as "kings" in the Biblical
narrative need not present any difficulty. Princes and other subject rulers who governed under an overlord
might be and, as a matter of fact, were referred to as
kings. " I am a king, son of a king", an unidentified monarch recorded on one of the two tablets just referred
to. Kudur-Mabug, King of Elam, during his lifetime
called his son Warad-Sin (Eri-Aku = Arioch) " King of
Larsa". It is of interest to note, too, in connection with
the Biblical narrative regarding the invasion of Syria and
Palestine, that he styled himself " overseer of the Amurru
(Amorites) ".



HAMMURA1U RECEIVING THE "CODE OF LAWS"
FROM THE SUN GOD
(Louvre, Paris')






THE GOLDEN AGE OF BABYLONIA 249
.No traces have yet been found in Palestine of its con
quest by the Elamites, nor have the excavators been able
to substantiate the claim of Lugal-zaggizi of a previous
age to have extended his empire to the shores of the Mediterranean. Any relics which these and other eastern
conquerors may have left were possibly destroyed by the Egyptians and Hittites.
When Hammurabi came to the throne he had appar
ently to recognize the overlordship of the Elamite king or his royal son at Larsa. Although Sin-muballit had
captured Isin, it was retaken, probably after the death of
the Babylonian war-lord, by Rim-Sin, who succeeded his brother Warad-Sin, and for a time held sway in Lagash,
Nippur, and Erech, as well as Larsa.
It was not until the thirty-first year of his reign that
Hammurabi achieved ascendancy over his powerful rival.
Having repulsed an Elamite raid, which was probably
intended to destroy the growing power of Babylon, he
"smote down Rim-Sin", whose power he reduced almost
to vanishing point. For about twenty years afterwards that subdued monarch lived in comparative obscurity; then he led a force of allies against Hammurabi's son and
successor, Samsu-iluna, who defeated him and put him to
death, capturing, in the course of his campaign, the revolting cities of Emutbalum, Erech, and Isin. So was the last smouldering ember of Elamite power stamped out in Babylonia.
Hammurabi, statesman and general, is one of the great
personalities of the ancient world. No more celebrated
monarch ever held sway in Western Asia. He was proud
of his military achievements, but preferred to be remembered as a servant of the gods, a just ruler, a father of his
people, and "the shepherd that gives peace". In the epilogue to his code of laws he refers to "the burden



250 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
of royalty", and declares that he "cut off the enemy"
and "lorded it over the conquered" so that his subjects
might have security. Indeed, his anxiety for their welfare was the most pronounced feature of his character. "I
carried all the people of Sumer and Akkad in my bosom ",
he declared in his epilogue. " By my protection, I guided
in peace its brothers. By my wisdom I provided for
them." He set up his stele, on which the legal code
was inscribed, so "that the great should not oppress the
weak" and "to counsel the widow and orphan", and "to
succour the injured . . . The king that is gentle, king of
the city, exalted am I." 1 Hammurabi was no mere framer of laws but a practical
administrator as well. He acted as supreme judge, and
his subjects could appeal to him as the Romans could to
Caesar. Nor was any case too trivial for his attention.
The humblest man was assured that justice would be
done if his grievance were laid before the king. Ham
murabi was no respecter of persons, and treated alike all
his subjects high and low. He punished corrupt judges,
protected citizens against unjust governors, reviewed the transactions of moneylenders with determination to curb
extortionate demands, and kept a watchful eye on the
operations of taxgatherers. There can be little doubt but that he won the hearts
of his subjects, who enjoyed the blessings of just adminis
tration under a well-ordained political system. He must also have endeared himself to them as an exemplary ex
ponent of religious tolerance. He respected the various
deities jn whom the various groups of people reposed their faith, restored despoiled temples, and re-endowed them
with characteristic generosity. By so doing he not only

afforded the pious full freedom and opportunity to per
form their religious ordinances, but also promoted the material welfare of his subjects, for the temples were centres of culture and the priests were the teachers of the young. Excavators have discovered at Sippar traces
of a school which dates from the Hammurabi Dynasty.
Pupils learned to read and write, and received instruction
in arithmetic and mensuration. They copied historical
tablets, practised the art of composition, and studied
geography. Although there were many professional scribes, a not inconsiderable proportion of the people of both sexes were able to write private and business letters. Sons wrote
from a distance to their fathers when in need of money then as now, and with the same air of undeserved martyr
dom and subdued but confident appeal. One son indited
a long complaint regarding the quality of the food he was
given in his lodgings. Lovers appealed to forgetful ladies,
showing great concern regarding their health. " Inform
me how it fares with thee," one wrote four thousand years
ago. " I went up to Babylon so that I might meet thee,
but did not, and was much depressed. Let me know why
thou didst go away so that I may be made glad. And do
come hither. Ever have care of thy health, remembering
me." Even begging -letter writers were not unknown.
An ancient representative of this class once wrote to his
employer from prison. He expressed astonishment that he had been arrested, and, having protested his innocence, he made touching appeal for little luxuries which were
denied to him, adding that the last consignment which had been forwarded had never reached him. Letters were often sent by messengers who were
named, but there also appears to have been some sort
of postal system. Letter carriers, however, could not

252 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
have performed their duties without the assistance of
beasts of burden. Papyri were not used as in Egypt.
Nor was ink required. Babylonian letters were shapely
little bricks resembling cushions. The angular alpha
betical characters, bristling with thorn -like projections,
were impressed with a wedge-shaped stylus on tablets of soft clay which were afterwards carefully baked in an
oven. Then the letters were placed in baked clay
envelopes, sealed and addressed, or wrapped in pieces of sacking transfixed by seals. If the ancient people had
a festive season which was regarded, like the European
Yuletide or the Indian Durga fortnight, as an occasion
suitable for the general exchange of expressions of goodwill, the Babylonian streets and highways must have been
greatly congested by the postal traffic, while muscular postmen worked overtime distributing the contents of
heavy and bulky letter sacks. Door to door deliveries
would certainly have presented difficulties. Wood being dear, everyone could not afford doors, and some houses
were entered by stairways leading to the flat and partly open roofs.
King Hammurabi had to deal daily with a voluminous
correspondence. He received reports from governors in
all parts of his realm, legal documents containing appeals, and private communications from relatives and others.
He paid minute attention to details, and was probably
one of the busiest men in Babylonia. Every day while
at home, after worshipping Merodach at E-sagila, he
dictated letters to his scribes, gave audiences to officials,
heard legal appeals and issued interlocutors, and dealt
with the reports regarding his private estates. He looks
a typical man of affairs in sculptured representations shrewd, resolute, and unassuming, feeling "the burden
of royalty", but ever ready and well qualified to discharge



THE GOLDEN AGE OF BABYLONIA 253
his duties with thoroughness and insight. His grasp of detail was equalled only by his power to conceive of great
enterprises which appealed to his imagination. It was a
work of genius on his part to weld together that great empire of miscellaneous states extending from southern
Babylonia to Assyria, and from the borders of Elam to the Mediterranean coast, by a universal legal Code which
secured tranquillity and equal rights to all, promoted business, and set before his subjects the ideals of right thinking
and right living. Hammurabi recognized that conquest was of little avail unless followed by the establishment of a just and
well-arranged political system, and the inauguration of practical measures to secure the domestic, industrial, and
commercial welfare of the people as a whole. He engaged
himself greatly, therefore, in developing the natural resources of each particular district. The network of irrigating canals was extended in the homeland so that
agriculture might prosper : these canals also promoted trade, for they were utilized for travelling by boat and
for the distribution of commodities. As a result of his
activities Babylon became not only the administrative, but also the commercial centre of his Empire the Lon
don of Western Asia and it enjoyed a spell of prosperity
which was never surpassed in subsequent times. Yet it
never lost its pre-eminent position despite the attempts of
rival states, jealous of its glory and influence, to suspend its activities. It had been too firmly established during
the Hammurabi Age, which was the Golden Age of
Babylonia, as the heartlike distributor nnd controller of
business life through a vast network of veins and arteries,
to be displaced by any other Mesopotamian city to pleasure even a mighty monarch. For two thousand years, from the time of Hammurabi until the dawn of the



254 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
Christian era, the city of Babylon remained amidst many
political changes the metropolis of Western Asiatic commerce and culture, and none was more eloquent in its
praises than the scholarly pilgrim from Greece who won
dered at its magnificence and reverenced its antiquities.
Hammurabi's reign was long as it was prosperous.
There is no general agreement as to when he ascended the throne some say in 2123 B.C., others hold that it
was after 2000 B.C. but it is certain that he presided
over the destinies of Babylon for the long period of forty
three years. There are interesting references to the military suc
cesses of his reign in the prologue to the legal Code. It
is related that when he "avenged Larsa", the seat of Rim
Sin, he restored there the temple of the sun god. Other
temples were built up at various ancient centres, so that
these cultural organizations might contribute to the
welfare of the localities over which they held sway. At
Nippur he thus honoured Enlil, at Eridu the god Ea, at
Ur the god Sin, at Erech the god Anu and the goddess
Nana (Ishtar), at Kish the god Zamama and the goddess
Ma-ma, at Cuthah the god Nergal, at Lagash the god
Nin-Girsu, while at Adab and Akkad, " celebrated for its
wide squares", and other centres he carried out religious
and public works. In Assyria he restored the colossus of
Ashur, which had evidently been carried away by a con
queror, and he developed the canal system of Nineveh.
Apparently Lagash and Adab had not been completely deserted during his reign, although their ruins have not
yielded evidence that they flourished after their fall
during the long struggle with the aggressive and plundering Elamites.
Hammurabi referred to himself in the Prologue as "a king who commanded obedience in all the four



THE GOLDEN AGE OF BABYLONIA 255
quarters". He was the sort of benevolent despot whom Carlyle on one occasion clamoured vainly for not an
Oriental despot in the commonly accepted sense of the
term. As a German writer puts it, his despotism was a
form of Patriarchal Absolutism. " When Marduk (Mero
dach)", as the great king recorded, "brought me to
direct all people, and commissioned me to give judgment,
I laid down justice and right in the provinces, I made all
flesh to prosper/* 1 That was the keynote of his long
life; he regarded himself as the earthly representative of the Ruler of all Merodach, "the lord god of right",
who carried out the decrees of Anu, the sky god of
Destiny. The next king, Samsu-iluna, reigned nearly as long as his illustrious father, and similarly lived a strenuous and
pious life. Soon after he came to the throne the forces
of disorder were let loose, but, as has been stated, he crushed and slew his most formidable opponent, Rim-Sin,
the Elamite king, who had gathered together an army of
allies. During his reign a Kassite invasion was repulsed.
The earliest I&issites, a people of uncertain racial affinities,
began to settle in the land during Hammurabi's lifetime.
Some writers connect them with the Hittites, and others
with the Iranians, vaguely termed as Indo-European or Indo-Germanic folk. Ethnologists as a rule regard them
as identical with the Cossaei, whom the Greeks found
settled between Babylon and Media, east of the Tigris
and north of Elam. The Hittites came south as raiders
about a century later. It is possible that the invading Kassites had overrun Elam and composed part of Rim
Sin's army. After settled conditions were secured many
of them remained in Babylonia, where they engaged like
1 Translation by Johns in Babylonian and Assyrian Laws, Contracts^ and Letters, pp. 390 et scq.



256 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
their pioneers in agricultural pursuits. No doubt they
were welcomed in that capacity, for owing to the con
tinuous spread of culture and the development of commerce, rural labour had become scarce and dear. Farmers
had a long-standing complaint, "The harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few'*. 1 "Despite the
existence of slaves, who were for the most part domestic
servants, there was", writes Mr. Johns, "considerable
demand for free labour in ancient Babylonia. This is
clear from the large number of contracts relating to hire
which have come down to us. ... As a rule, the man was hired for the harvest and was free directly after.
But there are many examples in which the term of service
was different one month, half a year, or a whole year.
. . . Harvest labour was probably far dearer than any
other, because of its importance, the skill and exertion
demanded, and the fact that so many were seeking for it
at once.'* When a farm worker was engaged he received
a shekel for "earnest money " or arles, and was penalized
for non-appearance or late arrival.2
So great was the political upheaval caused by Rim-Sin
and his allies and imitators in southern Babylonia, that it
was not until the seventeenth year of his reign that Samsu
iluna had recaptured Erech and Ur and restored their walls. Among other cities which had to be chastised was
ancient Akkad, where a rival monarch endeavoured to establish himself. Several years were afterwards spent
in building new fortifications, setting up memorials in
temples, and cutting and clearing canals. On more than one occasion during the latter part of his reign he had to deal with aggressive bands of Amorites.
The greatest danger to the Empire, however, was
threatened by a new kingdom which had been formed in
1 Matthew, ix, 37. 2 Johns's Babylonian and Assyrian Laivs, &fc., pp. 371-2.



THE GOLDEN AGE OF BABYLONIA 257
Bit-Jakin, a part of Sealand which was afterwards controlled
by the mysterious Chaldeans. Here may have collected evicted and rebel bands of Elamites and Sumerians and various "gentlemen of fortune" who were opposed to
the Hammurabi regime. After the fall of Rim-Sin it
became powerful under a king called Ilu-ma-ilu. Samsu
iluna conducted at least two campaigns against his rival, but without much success. Indeed, he was in the end
compelled to retreat with considerable loss owing to the
difficult character of that marshy country.
Abeshu, the next Babylonian king, endeavoured to shatter the cause of the Sealanders, and made it possible
for himself to strike at them by damming up the Tigris
canal. He achieved a victory, but the wily Ilu-ma-ilu
eluded him, and after a reign of sixty years was succeeded
by his son, Kiannib. The Sealand Dynasty, of which
little is known, lasted for over three and a half centuries,
and certain of its later monarchs were able to extend their
sway over part of Babylonia, but its power was strictly circumscribed so long as Hammurabi's descendants held
sway. During Abeshu's reign of twenty-eight years, of which but scanty records survive, he appears to have proved
an able statesman and general. He founded a new city
called Lukhaia, and appears to have repulsed a Kassite raid.
His son, Ammiditana, who succeeded him, apparently
inherited a prosperous and well-organized Empire, for during the first fifteen years of his reign he attended
chiefly to the adornment of temples and other pious
undertakings. He was a patron of the arts with archaeo
logical leanings, and displayed traits which suggest that he inclined, like Sumu-la-ilu, to ancestor worship. Entemena, the pious patesi of Lagash, whose memory is



258 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
associated with the famous silver vase decorated with the
lion-headed eagle form of Nin-Girsu, had been raised to
the dignity of a god, and Ammiditana caused his statue to
be erected so that offerings might be made to it. He set
up several images of himself also, and celebrated the
centenary of the accession to the throne of his grand
father, Samsu-iluna, " the warrior lord", by unveiling
his statue with much ceremony at Kish. About the middle of his reign he put down a Sumerian rising,
and towards its close had to capture a city which is
believed to be Isin, but the reference is too obscure
to indicate what political significance attached to this
incident. His son, Ammizaduga, reigned for over
twenty years quite peacefully so far as is known, and was succeeded by Samsuditana, whose rule extended over
a quarter of a century. Like Ammiditana, these two monarchs set up images of themselves as well as of the
gods, so that they might be worshipped, no doubt. They also promoted the interests of agriculture and commerce, and incidentally increased the revenue from taxation by
paying much attention to the canals and extending the
cultivatable areas.
But the days of the brilliant Hammurabi Dynasty
were drawing to a close. It endured for about a century longer than the Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt, which came
to an end, according to the Berlin calculations, in 1788 B.C. Apparently some of the Hammurabi and Amenemhet
kings were contemporaries, but there is no evidence that
they came into direct touch with one another. It was not
until at about two centuries after Hammurabi's day that
Egypt first invaded Syria, with which, however, it had for a long period previously conducted a brisk trade.
Evidently the influence of the Hittites and their Amoritic
allies predominated between Mesopotamia and the Delta



THE GOLDEN AGE OF BABYLONIA 259
frontier of Egypt, and it is significant to find in this con
nection that the " Khatti " or " Hatti " were referred to
for the first time in Egypt during the Twelfth Dynasty,
and in Babylonia during the Hammurabi Dynasty, sometime shortly before or after 2000 B.C. About 1800 B.C.
a Hittite raid resulted in the overthrow of the last
king of the Hammurabi family at Babylon. The Hyksos invasion of Egypt took place after 1788 B.C.

WHEN the Hammurabi Dynasty, like the Twelfth Dynasty
of Egypt, is found to be suffering languid decline, the gaps in the dulled historical records are filled with the
echoes of the thunder god, whose hammer beating re
sounds among the northern mountains. As this deity
comes each year in Western Asia when vegetation has
withered and after fruits have dropped from trees, bring
ing tempests and black rainclouds to issue in a new
season of growth and fresh activity, so he descended from the hills in the second millennium before the Christian era
as the battle lord of invaders and the stormy herald of
a new age which was to dawn upon the ancient world.
He was the war god of the Hittites as well as of the



RISE OF THE HITTITES, ETC. 261
northern Amorites, the Mitannians, and the Kassites; and he led the Aryans from the Iranian steppes towards the
verdurous valley of the Punjab. His worshippers engraved his image with grateful hands on the beetling cliffs of
Cappadocian chasms in Asia Minor, where his sway was
steadfast and pre-eminent for long centuries. In one
locality he appears mounted on a bull wearing a fringed and belted tunic with short sleeves, a conical helmet, and
upturned shoes, while he grasps in one hand the light
ning symbol, and in the other a triangular bow resting on his right shoulder. In another locality he is the
bringer of grapes and barley sheaves. But his most
familiar form is the bearded and thick-set mountaineer,
armed with a ponderous thunder hammer, a flashing
trident, and a long two-edged sword with a hemispherical knob on the hilt, which dangles from his belt, while an
antelope or goat wearing a pointed tiara prances beside him. This deity is identical with bluff, impetuous Thor of northern Europe, Indra of the Himalayas, Tarku of Phrygia, and Teshup or Teshub of Armenia and northern
Mesopotamia, Sandan, the Hercules of Cilicia, Adad or
Hadad of Amurru and Assyria, and Ramman, who at an
early period penetrated Akkad and Sumer in various forms. His Hittite name is uncertain, but in the time of Rameses II he was identified with Sutekh (Set). He
passed into southern Europe as Zeus, and became " the
lord " of the deities of the ^Egean and Crete.
The Hittites who entered Babylon about 1800 B.C.,
and overthrew the last king of the Hammurabi Dynasty,
may have been plundering raiders, like the European
Gauls of a later age, or a well-organized force of a strong, consolidated power, which endured for a period of un
certain duration. They were probably the latter, for
although they carried off Merodach and Zerpanitum
, these



262 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
idols were not thrust into the melting pot, but retained
apparently for political reasons. These early Hittites are "a people of the mist".
More than once in ancient history casual reference is
made to them ; but on most of these occasions they soon vanish suddenly behind their northern mountains.
The explanation appears to be that at various periods great leaders arose who were able to weld together the
various tribes, and make their presence felt in Western
Asia. But when once the organization broke down, either
on account of internal rivalries or the influence of an out
side power, they lapsed back again into a state of political insignificance in the affairs of the ancient world. It is
possible that about 1800 B.C. the Hittite confederacy was
controlled by an ambitious king who had dreams of a
great empire, and was accordingly pursuing a career of
conquest. Judging from what we know of the northern wor
shippers of the hammer god in later times, it would appear that when they were referred to as the Hatti
or Khatti, the tribe of that name was the dominating
power in Asia Minor and north Syria. The Hatti are usually identified with the broad-headed mountaineers of
Alpine or Armenoid type the ancestors of the modern
Armenians. Their ancient capital was at Boghaz-Kfti,
the site of Pteria, which was destroyed, according to the
Greeks, by Croesus, the last King of Lydia, in the sixth century B.C. It was strongly situated in an excellent
pastoral district on the high, breezy plateau of Cappadocia, surrounded by high mountains, and approached through narrow river gorges, which in winter were blocked with snow.
Hittite civilization was of great antiquity. Excavations which have been conducted at an undisturbed artificial



RISE OF THE HITTITES, ETC. 263
mound at Sakje-Geuzi have revealed evidences of a con
tinuous culture which began to flourish before 3000 B.C.1
In one of the lower layers occurred that particular type
of Neolithic yellow-painted pottery, with black geometric designs, which resembles other specimens of painted fabrics
found in Turkestan by the Pumpelly expedition; in Susa,
the capital of Elam, and its vicinity, by De Morgan; in the Balkan peninsula by Schliemann; in a First Dynasty tomb at Abydos in Egypt by Petrie ; and in the late
Neolithic and early Bronze Age (Minoan) strata of Crete
by Evans. It may be that these interesting relics were connected with the prehistoric drift westward of the
broad-headed pastoral peoples who ultimately formed the
Hittite military aristocracy. According to Professor Elliot Smith, broad-headed
aliens from Asia Minor first reached Egypt at the dawn
of history. There they blended with the indigenous tribes
of the Mediterranean or Brown Race. A mesocephalic
skull then became common. It is referred to as the Giza type, and has been traced by Professor Elliot Smith from
Egypt to the Punjab, but not farther into India.2
During the early dynasties this skull with alien traits
was confined chiefly to the Delta region and the vicinity
of Memphis, the city of the pyramid builders. It is not
improbable that the Memphite god Ptah may have been introduced into Egypt by the invading broad heads.
This deity is a world artisan like Indra, and is similarly associated with dwarfish artisans ; he hammers out the
copper sky, and therefore links with the various thunder
gods Tarku, Teshup, Adad, Ramman, &c., of the Asian mountaineers. Thunderstorms were of too rare
occurrence in Egypt to be connected with the food supply,
1 The Land of the Hittites, John Garstang, pp. 312 et seq. and 3 1 5 et seq.

264 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
which has always depended on the river Nile. Ptah's
purely Egyptian characteristics appear to have been ac
quired after fusion with Osiris-Seb, the Nilotic gods of
inundation, earth, and vegetation. The ancient god Set
(Sutekh), who became a demon, and was ultimately re
exalted as a great deity during the Nineteenth Dynasty, may also have had some connection with the prehistoric
Hatti.
Professor Elliot Smith, who has found alien traits in the mummies of the Rameses kings, is convinced that the
broad-headed folks who entered Europe by way of Asia
Minor, and Egypt through the Delta, at the close of the
Neolithic Age, represent " two streams of the same
Asiatic folk". 1 The opinion of such an authority cannot
be lightly set aside.
The earliest Egyptian reference to the Kheta, as the
Hittites were called, was made in the reign of the first
Amenemhet of the Twelfth Dynasty, who began to reign
about 2000 B.C. Some authorities, including Maspero,2 are of opinion that the allusion to the Hatti which is
found in the Babylonian Book of Omens belongs to the
earlier age of Sargon of Akkad and Naram-Sin, but Sayce
favours the age of Hammurabi. Others would connect
the Gutium, or men of Kutu, with the Kheta or Hatti.
Sayce has expressed the opinion that the Biblical Tidal, identified with Tudkhul or Tudhula, "king of nations",
the ally of Arioch, Amraphel, and Chedor-laomer, was a Hittite king, the "nations" being the confederacy of
Asia Minor tribes controlled by the Hatti. " In the
fragments of the Babylonian story of Chedor-laomer published by Dr. Pinches", says Professor Sayce, "the name of Tidcal is written Tudkhul, and he is described
as King of the Umman Manda^ or Nations of the North,
1 The Anatnt Egyptians, p. 130. a Struggle of the Nations (1896), p. 19.



RISE OF THE HITTITES, ETC. 265
of which the Hebrew Goyyim is a literal translation. Now
the name is Hittite. In the account of the campaign
of Rameses II against the Hittites it appears as Tid^al,
and one of the Hittite kings of Boghaz-K6i bears
the same name, which is written as Dud-khaliya in cuneiform. 1
One of the racial types among the Hittites wore
pigtails. These head adornments appear on figures in
certain Cappadocian sculptures and on Hittite warriors
in the pictorial records of a north Syrian campaign of Rameses II at Thebes. It is suggestive, therefore, to find that on the stele of Naram-Sin of Akkad, the moun
taineers who are conquered by that battle lord wear pig
tails also. Their split robes are unlike the short fringed
tunics of the Hittite gods, but resemble the long split
mantles worn over their tunics by high dignitaries like
King Tarku-dimme, who figures on a famous silver boss of an ancient Hittite dagger. Naram-Sin inherited the
Empire of Sargon of Akkad, which extended to the Mediterranean Sea. If his enemies were not natives of
Cappadocia, they may have been the congeners of the
Hittite pigtailed type in another wooded and mountainous
country. It has been suggested that these wearers of pigtails
were Mongolians. But although high cheek bones and
oblique eyes occurred in ancient times, and still occur, in
parts of Asia Minor, suggesting occasional Mongolian admixture with Ural-Altaic broad heads, the Hittite pig
tailed warriors must not be confused with the true small
nosed Mongols of north-eastern Asia. The Egyptian
sculptors depicted them with long and prominent noses, which emphasize their strong Armenoid affinities.
Other tribes in the Hittite confederacy included the
1 Note contributed to The Land of the Hittites, J. Garstang, p. 324.



266 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
representatives of the earliest settlers from North Africa of Mediterranean racial stock. These have been identi
fied with the Canaanites, and especially the agriculturists among them, for the Palestinian Hittites are also referred
to as Canaanites in the Bible, and in one particular con
nection under circumstances which afford an interesting
glimpse of domestic life in those far-off times. When
Esau, Isaac's eldest son, was forty years of age, " he took
to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and
Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite " l
. Apparently the Hittite ladies considered themselves to be of
higher caste than the indigenous peoples and the settlers
from other countries, for when Ezekiel declared that the
mother of Jerusalem was a Hittite he said : " Thou art
thy mother's daughter, that lotheth her husband and her
children." 2 Esau's marriage was " a grief of mind unto
Isaac and to Rebekah "-1 The Hebrew mother seems to
have entertained fears that her favourite son Jacob would
fall a victim to the allurements of other representatives of
the same stock as her superior and troublesome daughters
in-law, for she said to Isaac : " I am weary of my life
because of the daughters of Heth ; if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these which are of the
daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?" 3
Isaac sent for Jacob, "and charged him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of
Canaan. Arise, go to Padan-aram, to the house of Bethuel, thy mother's father ; and take thee a wife from
thence of the daughters of Laban, thy mother's brother." 4 From these quotations two obvious deductions may be
drawn : the Hebrews regarded the Hittites "of the land"
as one with the Canaanites, the stocks having probably
1 Genesis, xxvi, 34, 35. 2 Exekie/, xvi, 45. * Genesis^ xxvii, 46. * Genesis^ xxviii, I, 2.



RISE OF THE HITTITES, ETC 267
been so well fused, and the worried Rebekah had the
choosing of Jacob's wife or wives from among her own
relations in Mesopotamia who were of Sumerian stock and kindred of Abraham.1 It is not surprising to find traces of Sumerian pride among the descendants of the
evicted citizens of ancient Ur, especially when brought
into association with the pretentious Hittites.
Evidence of racial blending in Asia Minor is also
afforded by Hittite mythology. In the fertile agricultural valleys and round the shores of that great Eur-Asian
"land bridge" the indigenous stock was also of the Mediterranean race, as Sergi and other ethnologists have
demonstrated. The Great Mother goddess was worshipped from the earliest times, and she bore various
local names. At Comana in Pontus she was known to the Greeks as Ma, a name which may have been as old as
that of the Sumerian Mama (the creatrix), or Mamitum
(goddess of destiny) ; in Armenia she was Anaitis; in Cilicia she was Ate ('Atheh of Tarsus) ; while in Phrygia
she was best known as Cybele, mother of Attis, who links with Ishtar as mother and wife of Tammuz, Aphrodite as mother and wife of Adonis, and Isis as mother and wife of Osiris. The Great Mother was in Phoenicia
called Astarte ; she was a form of Ishtar, and identical
with the Biblical Ashtoreth. In the Syrian city of Hierapolis she bore the name of Atargatis, which Meyer, with
whom Frazer agrees, considers to be the Greek rendering of the Aramaic 'Athar-'Atheh the god 'Athar and the goddess 'Atheh. Like the "bearded Aphrodite", Atar
gatis may have been regarded as a bisexual deity. Some
of the specialized mother goddesses, whose outstanding attributes reflected the history and politics of the states
they represented, were imported into Egypt the land of
1 Genesis, xxiv. (C042) 20



268 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
ancient mother deities during the Empire period, by the half-foreign Rameses kings ; these included the voluptuous Kadesh and the warlike Anthat. In every
district colonized by the early representatives of the Mediterranean race, the goddess cult came into prominence, and the gods and the people were reputed to be descen
dants of the great Creatrix. This rule obtained as far
distant as Ireland, where the Danann folk and the Danann gods were the children of the goddess Danu.
Among the Hatti proper that is, the broad-headed
military aristocracy the chief deity of the pantheon was
the Great Father, the creator, " the lord of Heaven ", the
Baal. As Sutekh, Tarku, Adad, or Ramman, he was the
god of thunder, rain, fertility, and war, and he ultimately
acquired solar attributes. A famous rock sculpture at
Boghaz-Kfti depicts a mythological scene which is be
lieved to represent the Spring marriage of the Great Father and the Great Mother, suggesting a local fusion of beliefs which resulted from the union of tribes of the
god cult with tribes of the goddess cult. So long as
the Hatti tribe remained the predominant partner in the Hittite confederacy, the supremacy was assured of the
Great Father who symbolized their sway. But when,
in the process of time, the power of the Hatti declined, their chief god c< fell . . , from his predominant place in
the religion of the interior ", writes Dr. Garstang. " But
the Great Mother lived on, being the goddess of the
land." 1
In addition to the Hittite confederacy of Asia Minor and North Syria, another great power arose in northern Mesopotamia. This was the Mitanni Kingdom. Little is known regarding it, except what is derived from indirect
sources. Winckler believes that it was first established
1 The Syrian Goddt^ John Garstang (London, 1913), pp. 17-8.



RISE OF THE HITTITES, ETC. 269
by early "waves" of Hatti people who migrated from
the east.
The Hittite connection is based chiefly on the follow
ing evidence. One of the gods of the Mitanni rulers
was Teshup, who is identical with Tarku, the Thor of Asia Minor. The raiders who in 1800 B.C. entered
Babylon, set fire to E-sagila, and carried off Merodach
and his consort Zerpanitum
, were called the Hatti. The
images of these deities were afterwards obtained from
Khani (Mitanni).
At a later period, when we come to know more about Mitanni from the letters of one of its kings to two
Egyptian Pharaohs, and the Winckler tablets from Bog
haz-Koi, it is found that its military aristocracy spoke an
Indo-European language, as is shown by the names of their kings Saushatar, Artatama, Sutarna, Artashshumara, Tushratta, and Mattiuza. They worshipped the follow
ing deities :
Mi-it-ra, Uru-w-na, In-da-ra, and Na-sa-at-ti-ia
Mitra, Varuna, Indra, and Nasatyau (the "Twin Aswins"
= Castor and Pollux) whose names have been deciphered by Winckler. These gods were also imported into
India by the Vedic Aryans. The Mitanni tribe (the
military aristocracy probably) was called " Kharri ", and some philologists are of opinion that it is identical with "Arya", which was "the normal designation in Vedic literature from the Rigveda onwards of an Aryan of the
three upper classes 'V Mitanni signifies " the river lands ", and the descendants of its inhabitants, who lived in
Cappadocia, were called by the Greeks " Mattienoi ".

of the modern Kurds 'V a conspicuously long-headed people, proverbial, like the ancient Aryo-Indians and the Gauls, for their hospitality and their raiding pro
pensities. It would appear that the Mitannian invasion of
northern Mesopotamia and the Aryan invasion of India
represented two streams of diverging migrations from a
common cultural centre, and that the separate groups of
wanderers mingled with other stocks with whom they
came into contact. Tribes of Aryan speech were associ
ated with the Kassite invaders of Babylon, who took
possession of northern Babylonia soon after the disastrous
Hittite raid. It is believed that they came from the east
through the highlands of Elam. For a period, the dating of which is uncertain, the Mitannians were overlords of part of Assyria, including
Nineveh and even Asshur, as well as the district called
"Musri" by the Assyrians, and part of Cappadocia. They also occupied the cities of Harran and Kadesh.
Probably they owed their great military successes to their
cavalry. The horse became common in Babylon during the Kassite Dynasty, which followed the Hammurabi, and
was there called " the ass of the east ", a name which
suggests whence the Kassites and Mitannians came. The westward movement of the Mitannians in the second millennium B.C. may have been in progress prior
to the Kassite conquest of Babylon and the Hyksos in
vasion of Egypt. Their relations in Mesopotamia and Syria with the Hittites and the Amorites are obscure.
Perhaps they were for a time the overlords of the Hittites.
At any rate it is of interest to note that when Thothmes
III struck at the last Hyksos stronghold during his long Syrian campaign of about twenty years' duration, his

RISE OF THE HITTITES, ETC. 271
operations were directly against Kadesh on the Orontes, which was then held by his fierce enemies the Mitannians of Naharina. 1
During the Hyksos Age the horse was introduced
into Egypt. Indeed the Hyksos conquest was probably due to the use of the horse, which was domesticated, as
the Pumpelly expedition has ascertained, at a remote period in Turkestan, whence it may have been obtained
by the horse-sacrificing Aryo- Indians and the horsesacrificing ancestors of the Siberian Buriats.
If the Mitanni rulers were not overlords of the Hittites
about 1800 B.C., the two peoples may have been military
allies of the Kassites. Some writers suggest, indeed, that
the Kassites came from Mitanni. Another view is that
the Mitannians were the Aryan allies of the Kassites who
entered Babylon from the Elamite highlands, and that
they afterwards conquered Mesopotamia and part of
Cappadocia prior to the Hyksos conquest of Egypt. A third solution of the problem is that the Aryan rulers of
the Mitannian Hittites were the overlords of northern
Babylonia, which they included in their Mesopotamian empire for a century before the Kassites achieved political
supremacy in the Tigro-Euphrates valley, and that they were also the leaders of the Hyksos invasion of Egypt,
which they accomplished with the assistance of their Hittite and Amoritic allies.
The first Kassite king of Babylonia of whom we have
knowledge was Gandash. He adopted the old Akkadian
title, "king of the four quarters", as well as the title
"king of Sumer and Akkad", first used by the rulers of
the Dynasty of Ur. Nippur appears to have been selected
by Gandash as his capital, which suggests that his war and
storm god, Shuqamuna, was identified with Bel Enlil, who
1 Brcasted's History of Egypt) pp. 219-20.



272 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
as a "world giant" has much in common with the north
ern hammer gods. After reigning for sixteen years,
Gandash was succeeded by his son, Agum the Great, who
sat on the throne for twenty-two years. The greatgrandson of Agum the Great was Agum II, and not until
his reign were the statues of Merodach and his consort
Zerpanitum brought back to the city ot Babylon. This monarch recorded that, in response to the oracle of
Shamash, the sun god, he sent to the distant land ot
Khani (Mitanni) for the great deity and his consort.
Babylon would therefore appear to have been deprived
of Merodach for about two centuries. The HittiteMitanni raid is dated about 1800 B.C., and the rise of
Gandash, the Kassite, about 1700 B.C. At least a cen
tury elapsed between the reigns of Gandash and Agum II.
These calculations do not coincide, it will be noted, with the statement in a Babylonian hymn, that Merodach
remained in the land of the Hatti for twenty-four years,
which, however, may be either a priestly fiction or a refer
ence to a later conquest. The period which followed the
fall of the Hammurabi Dynasty of Babylonia is as obscure
as the Hyksos Age of Egypt. Agum II, the Kassite king, does not state whether or
not he waged war against Mitanni to recover Babylon's god Merodach. If, however, he was an ally of the Mitanni ruler, the transference of the deity may have
been an ordinary diplomatic transaction. The possibility may also be suggested that the Hittites of Mitanni were
not displaced by the Aryan military aristocracy until after the Kassites were firmly established in northern Babylonia between 1700 B.C. and 1600 B.C. This may account for
the statements that Merodach was carried off by the Hatti and returned from the land of Khani.
The evidence afforded by Egypt is suggestive in this



RISE OF THE HITTITES, ETC. 273
connection. There was a second Hyksos Dynasty in that
country. The later rulers became " Egyptianized " as
the Kassites became " Babylonianized ", but they were all referred to by the exclusive and sullen Egyptians as
"barbarians" and "Asiatics". They recognized the sun
god of Heliopolis, but were also concerned in promoting
the worship of Sutekh, a deity of sky and thunder, with
solar attributes, whom Rameses II identified with the
" Baal" of the Hittites. The Mitannians, as has been
stated, recognized a Baal called Teshup, who was identical
with Tarku of the Western Hittites and with their own
tribal Indra also. One of the Hyksos kings, named Ian
or Khian, the lanias of Manetho, was either an overlord
or the ally of an overlord, who swayed a great empire in Asia. His name has been deciphered on relics found as
far apart as Knossos in Crete and Baghdad on the Tigris,
which at the time was situated within the area of Kassite
control. Apparently peaceful conditions prevailed during his reign over a wide extent of Asia and trade was brisk
between far -distant centres of civilization. The very
term Hyksos is suggestive in this connection. According
to Breasted it signifies "rulers of countries", which com
pares with the Biblical "Tidal king of nations", whom
Sayce, as has been indicated, regards as a Hittite monarch.
When the Hittite hieroglyphics have been read and
Mesopotamia thoroughly explored, light may be thrown on the relations of the Mitannians, the Hittites, the
Hyksos, and the Kassites between 1 800 B.C. and 1 500 B.C.
It is evident that a fascinating volume of ancient history
has yet to be written.
The Kassites formed the military aristocracy of Babylonia, which was called Karduniash, for nearly six cen
turies. Agum II was the first of their kings who became
thoroughly Babylonianized, and although he still gave



274 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
recognition to Shuqamuna, the Kassite god of battle, he re-exalted Merodach, whose statue he had taken back
from "Khani", and decorated E-sagila with gifts of gold,
jewels, rare woods, frescoes, and pictorial tiles ; he also
re-endowed the priesthood. During the reign of his successor, Burnaburiash 1, the Dynasty of Sealand came to an end.
Little is known regarding the relations between Elam
and Babylonia during the Kassite period. If the Kassite
invaders crossed the Tigris soon after the raid of the Mitannian Hittites they must have previously overrun
a great part of Elam, but strongly situated Susa may
have for a time withstood their attacks. At first the
Kassites held northern Babylonia only, while the ancient Sumerian area was dominated by the Sealand power, which
had gradually regained strength during the closing years
of the Hammurabi Dynasty. No doubt many northern
Babylonian refugees reinforced its army.
The Elamites, or perhaps the Kassites of Elam, appear to have made frequent attacks on southern Babylonia.
At length Ea-gamil, king of Sealand, invaded Elam with purpose, no doubt, to shatter the power of his restless
enemies. He was either met there, however, by an army from Babylon, or his country was invaded during his absence. Prince Ulamburiash, son of Burnaburiash I,
defeated Ea-gamil and brought to an end the Sealand Dynasty which had been founded by Ilu-ma-ilu, the con
temporary and enemy of Samsu-la-ilu, son of Hammurabi. Ulamburiash is referred to on a mace-head which was
discovered at Babylon as "king of Sealand", and he prob
ably succeeded his father at the capital. The whole of
Babylonia thus came under Kassite sway.
Agum III, a grandson of Ulamburiash, found it
necessary, however, to invade Sealand, which must



RISE OF THE HITTITES, ETC. 275
therefore have revolted. It was probably a centre of
discontent during the whole period of Kassite ascend
ancy. After a long obscure interval we reach the period
when the Hyksos power was broken in Egypt, that is,
after 1580 B.C. The great Western Asiatic kingdoms
at the time were the Hittite, the Mitannian, the Assyrian,
and the Babylonian (Kassite). Between 1557 B.C. and 1501 B.C. Thothmes I of Egypt was asserting his sway over part of Syria. Many years elapsed, however, before
Thothmes III, who died in 1447 B.C., established firmly,
after waging a long war of conquest, the supremacy of Egypt between the Euphrates and the Mediterranean coast as far north as the borders of Asia Minor.
" At this period ", as Professor Flinders Petrie
emphasizes, "the civilization of Syria was equal or
superior to that of Egypt." Not only was there in the
cities "luxury beyond that of the Egyptians ", but also
"technical work which could teach them". The Syrian
soldiers had suits of scale armour, which afterwards were manufactured in Egypt, and they had chariots adorned
with gold and silver and highly decorated, which were
greatly prized by the Egyptians when they captured them, and reserved for royalty. "In the rich wealth of gold
and silver vases", obtained from captured cities by the
Nilotic warriors, "we see also", adds Petrie, "the sign of
a people who were their (the Egyptians') equals, if not
their superiors in taste and skill. "* It is not to be wondered
at, therefore, when the Pharaohs received tribute from
Syria that they preferred it to be carried into Egypt by
skilled workmen. " The keenness with which the
Egyptians record all the beautiful and luxurious products of the Syrians shows that the workmen would

276 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
probably be more in demand than other kinds of slave
tribute." 1 One of the monarchs with whom Thothmes III corre
sponded was the king of Assyria. The enemies of Egypt
in northern Mesopotamia were the Hittites and Mi
tannians, and their allies, and these were also the enemies
of Assyria. But to enable us to deal with the new situa
tion which was created by Egypt in Mesopotamia, it is
necessary in the first place to trace the rise of Assyria,
which was destined to become for a period the dominating
power in Western Asia, and ultimately in the Nile valley also.
The Assyrian group of cities grew up on the banks of
the Tigris to the north of Babylonia, the mother country.
The following Biblical references regarding the origins of
the two states are of special interest:
Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah: Shem, Ham,
and Japheth. . . . The sons of Ham: Cush, and Mizraim, and
Phut, and Canaan. . . . And Cush begat Nimrod; he began to be
a mighty one in the earth. He was a mighty hunter before the
Lord ; wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter
before the Lord. And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel,
and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. Out of that land went forth Asshur and builded Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah, and Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the
same is a great city.
The children of Shem: Elam and Asshur . . . (Genesis, x, 1-22). The land of Assyria . . . and the land of Nimrod in the entrances thereof (Micah, v, 6).
It will be observed that the Sumero-Babylonians are
Cushites or Hamites, and therefore regarded as racially akin to the proto-Egyptians of the Mediterranean race an
interesting confirmation of recent ethnological conclusions.
1 A History of Egypt, W. M. Flinders Pctric, vol. ii, p. 147 (1904 ed.).



RISE OF THE HITTITES, ETC. 277
Nimrod, the king of Babel (Babylon), in Shinar
(Sumer), was, it would appear, a deified monarch who
became ultimately identified with the national god of
Babylonia. Professor Pinches has shown1 that his name is a rendering of that of Merodach. In Sumerian Mero
dach was called Amaruduk or Amarudu, and in the
Assyro- Babylonian language Marduk. By a process
familiar to philologists the suffix "uk" was dropped and
the rendering became Marad. The Hebrews added " ni "
= " ni-marad ", assimilating the name "to a certain extent
to the '
niphal forms* of the Hebrew verbs and making
a change", says Pinches, "in conformity with the genius
of the Hebrew language ".
Asshur, who went out of Nimrod's country to build
Nineveh, was a son of Shem a Semite, and so far as is
known it was after the Semites achieved political supremacy
in Akkad that the Assyrian colonies were formed.
Asshur may have been a subject ruler who was deified
and became the god of the city of Asshur, which probably
gave its name to Assyria. According to Herodotus, Nineveh was founded by King Ninus and Queen Semiramis. This lady was re
puted to be the daughter of Derceto, the fish goddess,
whom Pliny identified with Atargatis. Semiramis was
actually an Assyrian queen of revered memory. She was deified and took the place of a goddess, apparently Nina, the prototype of Derceto. This Nina, perhaps a form of Damkina, wife of Ea, was the great mother of the
Sumerian city of Nina, and there, and also at Lagash, received offerings of fish. She was one of the many
goddesses of maternity absorbed by Ishtar. The Greek Ninus is regarded as a male form of her name; like
1 The Old Testament in the Light of the Historical R words and Legends of Assyria and
Babylonia, pp. 126 et seq.



278 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
Atargatis, she may have become a bisexual deity, if she
was not always accompanied by a shadowy male form. Nineveh (Ninua) was probably founded or conquered by colonists from Nina or Lagash, and called after the fish
goddess. All the deities of Assyria were imported from Baby
lonia except, as some hold, Ashur, the national god. 1
The theory that Ashur was identical with the Aryo
Indian Asura and the Persian Ahura is not generally
accepted. One theory is that he was an eponymous hero
who became the city god of Asshur, although the early form of his name, Ashir, presents a difficulty in this connection. Asshur was the first capital of Assyria. Its
city god may have become the national god on that
account.
At an early period, perhaps a thousand years before Thothmes III battled with the Mitannians in northern
Syria, an early wave of one of the peoples of Aryan speech may have occupied the Assyrian cities. Mr. Johns points out in this connection that the names of Ushpia,
Kikia, and Adasi, who, according to Assyrian records, were early rulers in Asshur, "are neither Semitic nor
Sumerian". An ancient name of the goddess of Nineveh
was Shaushka, which compares with Shaushkash, the consort of Teshup, the Hittite-Mitanni hammer god. As
many of the Mitannian names "are", according to Mr.
Johns, "really Elamitic", he suggests an ethnic connection between the early conquerors of Assyria and the
people of Elam. 2 Were the pre-Semitic Elamites origi
nally speakers of an agglutinative language, like the Sumerians and present-day Basques, who were conquered in prehistoric times by a people of Aryan speech?
1 His connection with Anu is discussed in chapter xiv.
2 Ancient Assyria^ C. H. W. Johns, p. n (London, 1912).



RISE OF THE HITTITES, ETC. 279
The possibility is urged by Mr. Johns's suggestion that Assyria may have been dominated in pre-Semitic
times by the congeners of the Aryan military aristocracy
of Mitanni. As has been shown, it was Semitized by the
Amoritic migration which, about 2000 B.C., brought into
prominence the Hammurabi Dynasty of Babylon.
A long list of kings with Semitic names held sway in
the Assyrian cities during and after the Hammurabi Age. But not until well on in the Kassite period did any of
them attain prominence in Western Asia. Then Ashur
bel-nish-eshu, King of Asshur, was strong enough to deal on equal terms with the Kassite ruler Kara-indash I, with
whom he arranged a boundary treaty. He was a contemporary of Thothmes III of Egypt. After Thothmes III had secured the predominance of
Egypt in Syria and Palestine he recognized Assyria as an independent power, and supplied its king with Egyptian gold to assist him, no doubt, in strengthening his
territory against their common enemy. Gifts were also sent from Assyria to Egypt to fan the flame of cordial
relations.
The situation was full of peril for Saushatar, king
of Mitanni. Deprived by Egypt of tribute-paying cities in Syria, his exchequer must have been sadly depleted.
A standing army had to be maintained, for although
Egypt made no attempt to encroach further on his territory, the Hittites were ever hovering on his north-western
frontier, ready when opportunity offered to win back
Cappadocia. Eastward, Assyria was threatening to be
come a dangerous, rival. He had himself to pay tribute
to Egypt, and Egypt was subsidizing his enemy. It was imperative on his part, therefore, to take action without
delay. The power of Assyria had to be crippled ; its revenues were required for the Mitannian exchequer. So



280 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
Saushatar raided Assyria during the closing years of the reign of Thothmes III, or soon after his successor, Amenhotep II, ascended the Egyptian throne.
Nothing is known from contemporary records regard
ing this campaign; but it can be gathered from the refer
ences of a later period that the city of Asshur was captured
and plundered; its king, Ashur-nadin-akhe, ceased corre
sponding and exchanging gifts with Egypt. That Nineveh
also fell is made clear by the fact that a descendant of
Saushatar (Tushratta) was able to send to a descendant
of Thothmes III at Thebes (Amenhotep III) the image
of Ishtar (Shaushka) of Nineveh. Apparently five suc
cessive Mitannian kings were overlords of Assyria during
a period which cannot be estimated at much less than a hundred years. Our knowledge regarding these events is derived chiefly from the Tell-el-Amarna letters, and the tablets found by Professor Hugo Winckler at Boghaz-Koi in
Cappadocia, Asia Minor.
The Tell-el-Amarna letters were discovered among
the ruins of the palace of the famous Egyptian Pharaoh,
Akhenaton, of the Eighteenth Dynasty, who died about 1358 B.C. During the winter of 18878 an Egyptian
woman was excavating soil for her garden, when she
happened Upon the cellar of Akhenaton's foreign office in
which the official correspondence had been stored. The
" letters " were baked clay tablets inscribed with cunei
form alphabetical signs in the Babylonian - Assyrian language, which, like French in modern times, was the
language of international diplomacy for many centuries in
Western Asia after the Hyksos period.
The Egyptian natives, ever so eager to sell antiquities
so as to make a fortune and retire for life, offered some
specimens of the tablets for sale. One or two were sent

RISE OF THE HITTITES, ETC. 281
to Paris, where they were promptly declared to be forgeries, with the result that for a time the inscribed bricks
were not a marketable commodity. Ere their value was
discovered, the natives had packed, them into sacks, with
the result that many were damaged and some completely
destroyed. At length, however, the majority of them
reached the British Museum and the Berlin Museum,
while others drifted into the museums at Cairo, St.
Petersburg, and Paris. When they were deciphered, Mitanni was discovered, and a flood of light thrown on
the internal affairs of Egypt and its relations with various
kingdoms in Asia, while glimpses were also afforded of
the life and manners of the times.
The letters covered the reigns of Amenhotep III, the great-grandson of Thothmes III, and of his son Akhenaton, "the dreamer king", and included communications
from the kings of Babylonia, Assyria, Mitanni, Cyprus, the Hittites, and the princes of Phoenicia and Canaan.
The copies of two letters from Amenhotep III to Kallima
Sin, King of Babylonia, had also been preserved. One
deals with statements made by Babylonian ambassadors,
whom the Pharaoh stigmatizes as liars. Kallima-Sin had
sent his daughter to the royal harem of Egypt, and
desired to know if she was alive and well. He also asked
for " much gold
" to enable him to carry on the work of
extending his temple. When twenty minas of gold was sent to him, he complained in due course that the quantity received was not only short but that the gold was not pure; it had been melted in the furnace, and less than five minas came out. In return he sent to Akhenaton
two minas of enamel, and some jewels for his daughter,
who was in the Egyptian royal harem.
Ashur-uballit, king of Ashur, once wrote intimating to Akhenaton that he was gifting him horses and chariots



282 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
and a jewel seal. He asked for gold to assist in building
his palace. "In your country", he added, "gold is as
plentiful as dust." He also made an illuminating statement to the effect that no ambassador had gone from
Assyria to Egypt since the days of his ancestor Ashur
nadin-akhe. It would therefore appear that Ashur-uballit
had freed part of Assyria from the yoke of Mitanni.
The contemporary king of Mitanni was Tushratta.
He corresponded both with his cousin Amenhotep III and his son-in-law Akhenaton. In his correspondence
with Amenhotep III Tushratta tells that his kingdom had
been invaded by the Hittites, but his god Teshup had
delivered them into his hand, and he destroyed them;
"not one of them", he declared, "returned to his own
country". Out of the booty captured he sent Amenhotep
several chariots and horses, and a boy and a girl. To his
sister Gilu-khipa, who was one of the Egyptian Pharaoh's
wives, he gifted golden ornaments and a jar of oil. In
another letter Tushratta asked for a large quantity of
gold "without measure". He complained that he did
not receive enough on previous occasions, and hinted that
some of the Egyptian gold looked as if it were alloyed with copper. Like the Assyrian king, he hinted that
gold was as plentiful as dust in Egypt. His own presents to the Pharaoh included precious stones, gold ornaments,
chariots and horses, and women (probably slaves). This
may have been tribute. It was during the third Amenhotep's illness that Tushratta forwarded the Nineveh
image of Ishtar to Egypt, and he made reference to its
having been previously sent thither by his father, Sutarna.
When Akhenaton came to the throne Tushratta wrote
to him, desiring to continue the friendship which had
existed for two or three generations between the kings of
Mitanni and Egypt, and made complimentary references



RISE OF THE HITTITES, ETC. 283
to "the distinguished Queen Tiy ", Akhenaton's mother,
who evidently exercised considerable influence in shaping
Egypt's foreign policy. In the course of his long
correspondence with the Pharaohs, Tushratta made those statements regarding his ancestors which have provided
so much important data for modern historians of his
kingdom. During the early part of the Tell-el-Amarna period, Mitanni was the most powerful kingdom in Western Asia. It was chiefly on that account that the daughters of its rulers were selected to be the wives and mothers of great Egyptian Pharaohs. But its numerous enemies
were ever plotting to accomplish its downfall. Among
these the foremost and most dangerous were the Hittites
and the Assyrians.
The ascendancy of the Hittites was achieved in northern Syria with dramatic suddenness. There arose
in Asia Minor a great conqueror, named Subbi-luliuma,
the successor of Hattusil I, who established a strong
Hittite empire which endured for about two centuries.
His capital was at Boghaz-Koi. Sweeping through
Cappadocia, at the head of a finely organized army, remarkable for its mobility, he attacked the buffer states
which owed allegiance to Mitanni and Egypt. City after city fell before him, until at length he invaded Mitanni ; but it is uncertain whether or not Tushratta met him in
battle. Large numbers of the Mitannians were, however, evicted and transferred to the land of the Hittites, where
the Greeks subsequently found them, and where they are
believed to be represented by the modern Kurds, the hereditary enemies of the Armenians. In the confusion which ensued, Tushratta was murdered by Sutarna II, who was recognized by Subbi
luliuma. The crown prince, Mattiuza, fled to Babylon,
(0642) 21



284 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
where he found protection, but was unable to receive any
assistance. Ultimately, when the Hittite emperor had secured his sway over northern Syria, he deposed Sutarna II and set Mattiuza as his vassal on the throne of the shrunken Mitanni kingdom.
Meanwhile the Egyptian empire in Asia had gone to
pieces. When Akhenaton, the dreamer king, died in his
palace at Tell-el-Amarna, the Khabiri were conquering the Canaanite cities which had paid him tribute, and the
Hittite ruler was the acknowledged overlord of the Amorites.
The star of Assyria was also in the ascendant. Its
king, Ashur-uballit, who had corresponded with Akhenaton, was, like the Hittite king, Subbi-luliuma, a distin
guished statesman and general, and similarly laid the foundations of a great empire. Before or after Subbi
luliuma invaded Tushratta's domains, he drove the Mitannians out of Nineveh, and afterwards overcame the Shubari tribes of Mitanni on the north-west, with the
result that he added a wide extent of territory to his
growing empire.
He had previously thrust southward the Assyro
Babylonian frontier. In fact, he h^d become so formid
able an opponent of Babylonia that his daughter had been accepted as the wife of Karakhardash, the Kassite king of that country. In time his grandson, Kadashman-Kharbe, ascended the Babylonian throne. This young monarch
co-operated with his grandfather in suppressing the Suti,
who infested the trade routes towards the west, and plun
dered the caravans of merchants and the messengers of
great monarchs with persistent impunity.
A reference to these bandits appears in one of the
Tell-el-Amarna letters. Writing to Akhenaton, Ashur
uballit said: "The lands (of Assyria and Egypt) are



RISE OF THE H1TTITES, ETC. 285
remote, therefore let our messengers come and go. That
your messengers were late in reaching you, (the reason is that) if the Suti had waylaid them, they would have been dead men. For if I had sent them, the Suti would have sent bands to waylay them ; therefore I have retained
them. My messengers (however), may they not (for
this reason) be delayed." 1 Ashur-uballit's grandson extended his Babylonian
frontier into Amurru, where he dug wells and erected
forts to protect traders. The Kassite aristocracy, how
ever, appear to have entertained towards him a strong
dislike, perhaps because he was so closely associated with
their hereditary enemies the Assyrians. He had not reigned for long when the embers of rebellion burst into
flame and he was murdered in his palace. The Kassites
then selected as their king a man of humble origin, named
Nazibugash, who was afterwards referred to as " the son
of nobody ". Ashur-uballit deemed the occasion a fitting
one to interfere in the affairs of Babylonia. He suddenly
appeared at the capital with a strong army, overawed the
Kassites, and seized and slew Nazibugash. Then he set
on the throne his great grandson the infant Kurigalzu II,
who lived to reign for fifty-five years. Ashur-uballit appears to have died soon after this
event. He was succeeded by his son Bel-nirari, who
carried on the policy of strengthening and extending the Assyrian empire. For many years he maintained excel
lent relations with his kinsman Kurigalzu II, but ulti
mately they came into conflict apparently over disputed
territory. A sanguinary battle was fought, in which the
Babylonians suffered heavily and were put to rout. A treaty of peace was afterwards arranged, which secured for the Assyrians a further extension of their frontier c< from

286 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
the borders of Mitanni as far as Babylonia ". The struggle
of the future was to be for the possession of Mesopo
tamia, so as to secure control over the trade routes.
Thus Assyria rose from a petty state in a compara
tively brief period to become the rival of Babylonia, at a
time when Egypt at the beginning of its Nineteenth
Dynasty was endeavouring to win back its lost empire in
Syria, and the Hittite empire was being consolidated in the north.

war. It was necessary, therefore, that he should continue to find favour in the eyes of the deity who had been proved to be more powerful than the god of his enemies.
Besides, he had to make provision during his absence on long campaigns, or while absorbed in administrative work,
for the constant performance of religious rites, so that the various deities of water, earth, weather, and corn might be

sustained or propitiated with sacrificial offerings, or held
in magical control by the performance of ceremonial rites.
Consequently an endowed priesthood became a necessity
in all powerful and well-organized states.
Thus came into existence in Babylonia, as elsewhere,
as a result of the accumulation of wealth, a leisured
official class, whose duties tended to promote intellectual
activity, although they were primarily directed to per
petuate gross superstitious practices. Culture was really a by-product of temple activities ; it flowed forth like
pure gold from furnaces of thought which were walled up by the crude ores of magic and immemorial tradition.
No doubt in ancient Babylonia, as in Europe during
the Middle Ages, the men of refinement and intellect
among the upper classes were attracted to the temples,
while the more robust types preferred the outdoor life,
and especially the life of the soldier. 1 The permanent
triumphs of Babylonian civilization were achieved either
by the priests, or in consequence of the influence they exercised. They were the grammarians and the scribes, the mathematicians and the philosophers of that ancient
country, the teachers of the young, and the patrons of the
arts and crafts. It was because the temples were centres
of intellectual activity that the Sumerian language re
mained the language of culture for long centuries after it
ceased to be the everyday speech of the people. Reference has already been made to the growth of art,
and the probability that all the arts had their origin in
magical practices, and to the growth of popular education necessitated by the centralization of business in the
1 "It maybe worth while to note again", says Beddoe, "how often finely developed
skulls are discovered in the graveyards of old monasteries, and how likely seems Galton's conjecture, that progress was arrested in the Middle Ages, because the celibacy of the clergy brought about the extinction of the best strains of blood." The Anthropological
History of Europt, p. 1 6 1 (1912).



ASTROLOGY AND ASTRONOMY 289
temples. It remains with us to deal now with priestly contributions to the more abstruse sciences. In India
the ritualists among the Brahmans, who concerned themselves greatly regarding the exact construction and mea
surements of altars, gave the world algebra ; the pyramid
builders of Egypt, who erected vast tombs to protect
royal mummies, had perforce to lay the groundwork of
the science of geometry ; and the Babylonian priests who elaborated the study of astrology became great astron
omers because they found it necessary to observe and
record accurately the movements of the heavenly bodies.
From the earliest times of which we have knowledge,
the religious beliefs of the Sumerians had vague stellar
associations. But it does not follow that their myths
were star myths to begin with. A people who called
constellations "the ram ", "the bull", "the lion", or
"the scorpion", did not do so because astral groups
suggested the forms of animals, but rather because the animals had an earlier connection with their religious life.
At the same time it should be recognized that the
mystery of the stars must ever have haunted the minds
of primitive men. Night with all its terrors appealed
more strongly to their imaginations than refulgent day
when they felt more secure ; they were concerned most
regarding what they feared most. Brooding in darkness
regarding their fate, they evidently associated the stars with the forces which influenced their lives the ghosts
of ancestors, of totems, the spirits that brought food or
famine and controlled the seasons. As children see
images in a fire, so they saw human life reflected in the
starry sky. To the simple minds of early folks the great
moon seemed to be the parent of the numerous twinkling
and moving orbs. In Babylon, indeed, the moon was regarded as the father not only of the stars but of the sun



290 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
also; there, as elsewhere, lunar worship was older than
solar worship. Primitive beliefs regarding the stars were of similar
character in various parts of the world. But the impor
tance which they assumed in local mythologies depended
in the first place on local phenomena. On the northern
Eur-Asian steppes, for instance, where stars vanished during summer's blue nights, and were often obscured by clouds in winter, they did not impress men's minds so
persistently and deeply as in Babylonia, where for the greater part of the year they gleamed in darkness through a dry transparent atmosphere with awesome intensity.
The development of an elaborate system of astral myths,
besides, was only possible in a country where the people
had attained to a high degree of civilization, and men enjoyed leisure and security to make observations and
compile records. It is not surprising, therefore, to find that Babylonia was the cradle of astronomy. But before
this science had destroyed the theory which it was
fostered to prove, it lay smothered for long ages in the
debris of immemorial beliefs. It is necessary, therefore,
in dealing with Babylonian astral myths to endeavour
to approach within reasonable distance of the point of
view, or points of view, of the people who framed them.
Babylonian religious thought was of highly complex character. Its progress was ever hampered by blended
traditions. The earliest settlers in the Tigro- Euphrates
valley no doubt imported many crude beliefs which they
had inherited from their Palaeolithic ancestors the modes of thought which were the moulds of new theories
arising from new experiences. When consideration is
given to the existing religious beliefs of various peoples throughout the world, in low stages of culture, it is
found that the highly developed creeds of Babylonia,



ASTROLOGY AND ASTRONOMY 291
Egypt, and other countries where civilization flourished
were never divested wholly of their primitive traits.
Among savage peoples two grades of religious ideas have been identified, and classified as Naturalism and Animism. In the plane of Naturalism the belief obtains
that a vague impersonal force, which may have more than one manifestation and is yet manifested in everything,
controls the world and the lives of human beings. An
illustration of this stage of religious consciousness is
afforded by Mr. Risley, who, in dealing with the religion of the jungle dwellers of Chota Nagpur, India, says that
" in most cases the indefinite something which they fear
and attempt to propitiate is not a person at all in any sense of the word; if one must state the case in positive
terms, I should say that the idea which lies at the root of
their religion is that of a power rather than many powers".1 Traces of Naturalism appear to have survived in
Sumeria in the belief that " the spiritual, the Zi, was that
which manifested life. . . . The test of the manifestation
of life was movement/' 2 All things that moved, it was
conceived in the plane of Naturalism, possessed " self power"; the river was a living thing, as was also the
fountain; a stone that fell from a hill fell of its own
accord; a tree groaned because the wind caused it to
suffer pain. This idea that inanimate objects had con
scious existence survived in the religion of the Aryo
Indians. In the Nala story of the Indian epic, the
Mahdbhdrata, the disconsolate wife Damayanti addresses
a mountain when searching for her lost husband:
This, the monarch of all mountains, ask I of the king of men ;
O all-honoured Prince of Mountains, with thy heavenward
soaring peaks
1 Census of India, vol. i, part i, pp. 352 2 Hibbert Lectures, Professor Sayce, p. ;



292 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
Hast thou seen the kingly Nala in this dark and awful wood?. . .
Why repliest thou not, O Mountain?"
She similarly addresses the Asoka tree:
" Hast thou seen Nishadha's monarch, hast thou seen my only love? . . .
That I may depart ungrieving, fair Asoka, answer me. . . ." Many a tree she stood and gazed on. . . .*
it will be recognized that when primitive men gave names to mountains, rivers, or the ocean, these possessed for them a deeper significance than they do for us at the
present day. The earliest peoples of Indo-European
speech who called the sky "dyeus", and those of
Sumerian speech who called it "ana", regarded it not
as the sky "and nothing more", but as something which
had conscious existence and "self power". Our remote
ancestors resembled, in this respect, those imaginative children who hold conversations with articles of furniture,
and administer punishment to stones which, they believe, have tripped them up voluntarily and with desire to commit an offence.
In this early stage of development the widespread totemic beliefs appear to have had origin. Families
or tribes believed that they were descended from moun
tains, trees, or wild animals.
jEsop's fable about the mountain which gave birth to
a mouse may be a relic of Totemism ; so also may be the
mountain symbols on the standards of Egyptian ships
which appear on pre-dynastic pottery; the black dwarfs of Teutonic mythology were earth children.2
1 The Story of Nala, Monier Williams, pp. 68-9 and 77.
2 " In Ymer*8 flesh (the earth) the dwarfs were engendered and began to move and live. . . . The dwarfs had been bred in the mould of the earth, just as worms are in a dead body." The Prose Edda.
"The gods . . . took counsel whom they should make the lord of dwarfs out of



ASTROLOGY AND ASTRONOMY 293
Adonis sprang from a tree; his mother may have,
according to primitive belief, been simply a tree; Dagda, the patriarchal Irish corn god, was an oak; indeed, the idea of a "world tree", which occurs in Sumerian, Vedic
Indian, Teutonic, and other mythologies, was probably a product of Totemism. Wild animals were considered to be other forms of
human beings who could marry princes and princesses as they do in so many fairy tales. Damayanti addressed
the tiger, as well as the mountain and tree, saying:
I approach him without fear.
" Of the beasts art thou the monarch, all this forest thy domain; . . .
Thou, O king of beasts, console me, if my Nala thou hast seen." 1
A
tribal totem exercised sway over a tribal district. In
Egypt, as Herodotus recorded, the crocodile was wor
shipped in one district and hunted down in another.
Tribes fought against tribes when totemic animals were
slain. The Babylonian and Indian myths about the con
flicts between eagles and serpents may have originated as records of battles between eagle clans and serpent clans.
Totemic animals were tabooed. The Set pig of Egypt
and the devil pig of Ireland, Scotland, and Wales were
not eaten except sacrificially. Families were supposed to be descended from swans and were named Swans, or from
seals and were named Seals, like the Gaelic " Mac
Codrums", whose surname signifies "son of the seal";
the nickname of the Campbells, " sons of the pig ", may
refer to their totemic boar's head crest, which commemo
rated the slaying, perhaps the sacrificial slaying, of the boar by their ancestor Diarmid. Mr. Garstang, in The
Syrian Goddess^ thinks it possible that the boar which killed
Ymer's blood (the sea) and his swarthy limbs (the earth)," The Elder Edda (Voluspfi) stanza 9). 1 The Story of Nala, Monier Williams, p. 67.



MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
Adonis was of totemic origin. So may have been the
fish form of the Sumerian god Ea. When an animal
totem was sacrificed once a year, and eaten sacrificially
so that the strength of the clan might be maintained, the
priest who wrapped himself in its skin was supposed to have transmitted to him certain magical powers ; he be
came identified with the totem and prophesied and gave
instruction as the totem. Ea was depicted clad in the
fish's skin.
Animism, the other early stage of human develop
ment, also produced distinctive modes of thought. Men conceived that the world swarmed with spirits, that a
spirit groaned in the wind-shaken tree, that the howl
ing wind was an invisible spirit, that there were spirits
in fountains, rivers, valleys, hills, and in ocean, and in
all animals; and that a hostile spirit might possess an
individual and change his nature. The sun and the
moon were the abodes of spirits, or the vessels in which
great spirits sailed over the sea of the sky ; the stars were all spirits, the "host of heaven". These spirits
existed in groups of seven, or groups of three, and the
multiple of three, or in pairs, or operated as single individuals.
Although certain spirits might confer gifts upon mankind, they were at certain seasons and in certain
localities hostile and vengeful, like the grass-green fairies
in winter, or the earth-black elves when their gold was
sought for in forbidden and secret places. These
spirits were the artisans of creation and vegetation, like
the Egyptian Khnumu and the Indian Rhibus ; they fashioned the grass blades and the stalks of corn,
but at times of seasonal change they might ride on
their tempest steeds, or issue forth from flooding rivers
and lakes, Man was greatly concerned about striking



ASTROLOGY AND ASTRONOMY 295
bargains with them to secure their services, and about
propitiating them, or warding off their attacks with protective charms, and by performing "ceremonies of
riddance". The ghosts of the dead, being spirits, were
similarly propitious or harmful on occasion; as emissaries
of Fate they could injure the living.
Ancestor worship, the worship of ghosts, had origin in the stage of Animism. But ancestor worship was not
developed in Babylonia as in China, for instance, although traces of it survived in the worship of stars as ghosts, in
the deification of kings, and the worship of patriarchs, who might be exalted as gods or identified with a
supreme god. The Egyptian Pharaoh Unas became the sun god and the constellation of Orion by devouring his
predecessors.
1 He ate his god as a tribe ate its animal totem; he became the "bull of heaven ".
There were star totems as well as mountain totems.
A
St. Andrew's cross sign, on one of the Egyptian ship
standards referred to, may represent a star. The Baby
lonian goddess Ishtar was symbolized as a star, and she was the "world mother''. Many primitive currents of
thought shaped the fretted rocks of ancient mythologies. In various countries all round the globe the belief
prevailed that the stars were ghosts of the mighty dead
of giants, kings, or princes, or princesses, or of pious
people whom the gods loved, or of animals which were
worshipped. A few instances may be selected at random.
When the Teutonic gods slew the giant Thjasse, he appeared in the heavens as Sirius. In India the ghosts of
the "seven Rishis" , who were semi -divine Patriarchs, formed the constellation of the Great Bear, which in Vedic
times was called the "seven bears ". The wives of the
seven Rishis were the stars of the Pleiades. In Greece
ian Myth and Legend, pp. 168 et seq.



296 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
the Pleiades were the ghosts of the seven daughters of Adas and Pleione, and in Australia they were and are
a queen and six handmaidens. In these countries, as elsewhere, stories were told to account for the "lost Pleiad ",
a fact which suggests that primitive men were more constant observers of the heavenly bodies than might otherwise be supposed. The Arcadians believed that they were
descended, as Hesiod recorded, from a princess who was transformed by Zeus into a bear ; in this form Artemis
slew her and she became the " Great Bear" of the sky.
The Egyptian Isis was the star Sirius, whose rising co
incided with the beginning of the Nile inundation. Her
first tear for the dead Osiris fell into the river on " the
night of the drop". The flood which ensued brought the food supply. Thus the star was not only the Great
Mother of all, but the sustainer of all.
The brightest stars were regarded as being the greatest and most influential. In Babylonia all the planets were
identified with great deities. Jupiter, for instance, was
Merodach, and one of the astral forms of Ishtar was
Venus. Merodach was also connected with " the fish of
Ea" (Pisces), so that it is not improbable that Ea worship had stellar associations. Constellations were given recog
nition before the planets were identified.
A strange blending of primitive beliefs occurred when
the deities were given astral forms. As has been shown
(Chapter III) gods were supposed to die annually. The
Egyptian priests pointed out to Herodotus the grave of Osiris and also his star. There are "giants' graves" also
in those countries in which the gods were simply ferocious
giants. A god might assume various forms ; he might take the form of an insect, like Indra, and hide in a plant,
or become a mouse, or a serpent, like the gods of Erech
in the Gilgamesh epic. The further theory that a god



ASTROLOGY AND ASTRONOMY 297
could exist in various forms at one and the same time
suggests that it had its origin among a people who
accepted the idea of a personal god while yet in the stage of Naturalism. In Egypt Osiris, for instance, was the
moon, which came as a beautiful child each month and was
devoured as the wasting "old moon" by the demon Set;
he was the young god who was slain in his prime each year;
he was at once the father, husband, and son of Isis; he was the Patriarch who reigned over men and became the Judge of the Dead; he was the earth spirit, he was the
bisexual Nile spirit, he was the spring sun; he was the
Apis bull of Memphis, and the ram of Mendes; he was
the reigning Pharaoh. In his fusion with Ra, who was
threefold Khepera, Ra, and Turn he died each day as
an old man; he appeared in heaven at night as the con
stellation Orion, which was his ghost, or was> perhaps, rather the Sumerian Zi5 the spiritual essence of life.
Osiris, who resembled Tammuz, a god of many forms
also, was addressed as follows in one of the Isis chants:
There proceedeth from thee the strong Orion in heaven at evening,
at the resting of every day !
Lo it is I (Isis), at the approach of the Sothis (Sirius) period, who doth watch for him (the child Osiris), Nor will I leave off watching for him; for that which proceedeth
from thee (the living Osiris) is revered.
An emanation from thee causeth life to gods and men, reptiles and
animals, and they live by means thereof.
Come thou to us from thy chamber, in the day when thy soul be
getteth emanations,
The day when offerings upon offerings are made to thy spirit,
which causeth the gods and men likewise to live. 1
This extract emphasizes how unsafe it is to confine
certain deities within narrow limits by terming them simply
1 The Burden of Isis, Dennis, p. 24.



298 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
"solar gods", "lunar gods", "astral gods", or "earth
gods". One deity may have been simultaneously a sun
god and moon god, an air god and an earth god, one who
was dead and also alive, unborn and also old. The priests of Babylonia and Egypt were less accustomed to concrete
and logical definitions than their critics and expositors of
the twentieth century. Simple explanations of ancient' beliefs are often by reason of their very simplicity highly
improbable. Recognition must ever be given to the
puzzling complexity of religious thought in Babylonia and Egypt, and to the possibility that even to the priests the doctrines of a particular cult, which embraced the
accumulated ideas of centuries, were invariably confusing
and vague, and full of inconsistencies; they were mystical in the sense that the understanding could not grasp them
although it permitted their acceptance. A god, for instance, might be addressed at once in the singular and
plural, perhaps because he had developed from an animistic group of spirits, or, perhaps, for reasons we cannot
discover. This is shown clearly by the following pregnant extract from a- Babylonian tablet: "Powerful, Sevenfold,
one are ye". Mr. L. W. King, the translator, comments
upon it as follows : " There is no doubt that the name
was applied to a group of gods who were so closely connected that, though addressed in the plural, they could
in the same sentence be regarded as forming a single
personality". 1 Like the Egyptian Osiris, the Babylonian Merodach
was a highly complex deity. He was the son of Ea, god
of the deep; he died to give origin to human life when he commanded that his head should be cut off so that the
first human beings might be fashioned by mixing his
blood with the earth; he was the wind god, who gave
1 Babylonian JMagtc And Sorcery^ p. 117.



ASTROLOGY AND ASTRONOMY 299
"the air of life"; he was the deity of thunder and the
sky; he was the sun of spring in his Tammuz character;
he was the daily sun, and the planets Jupiter and Mercury as well as Sharru (Regulus); he had various astral associa
tions at various seasons. Ishtar, the goddess, was Iku
(Capella), the water channel star, in January-February, and Merodach was Iku in May June. This strange
system of identifying the chief deity with different stars
at different periods, or simultaneously, must not be con
fused with the monotheistic identification of him with
other gods. Merodach changed his forms with Ishtar,
and had similarly many forms. This goddess, for in
stance, was, even when connected with one particular
heavenly body, liable to change. According to a tablet
fragment she was, as the planet Venus, "a female at sunset and a male at sunrise" 1 that is, a bisexual deity like
Nannar of Ur, the father and mother deity combined, and Isis of Egypt. Nannar is addressed in a famous hymn:
Father Nannar, Lord, God Sin, ruler among the gods. . . . Mother body ivhich produceth all things. . . .
Merciful, gracious Father, in whose hand the life of the whole land is contained.
One of the Isis chants of Egypt sets forth, addressing Osiris:
There cometh unto thee Isis, lady of the horizon, who hath begotten herself alone in the image of the gods . . .
She hath taken vengeance before Horus, the woman who was made a male by her father Osiris?
Merodach, like Osiris-Sokar, was a "lord of many
existences", and likewise "the mysterious one, he who is unknown to mankind'*.3 It was impossible for the
human mind "a greater than itself to know".

300 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
Evidence has not yet been forthcoming to enable us
to determine the period at which the chief Babylonian
deities were identified with the planets, but it is clear that Merodach's ascendancy in astral form could not have
occurred prior to the rise of that city god of Babylon as
chief of the pantheon by displacing Enlil. At the same
time it must be recognized that long before the Ham
murabi age the star-gazers of the Tigro-Euphrates valley must have been acquainted with the movements of the
chief planets and stars, and, no doubt, they connected them with seasonal changes as in Egypt, where Isis was
identified with Sirius long before the Ptolemaic age, when
Babylonian astronomy was imported. Horus was identified not only with the sun but also with Saturn, Jupiter,
and Mars. 1 Even the primitive Australians, as has been
indicated, have their star myths ; they refer to the stars
Castor and Pollux as two young men, like the ancient
Greeks, while the African Bushmen assert that these
stars are two girls. It would be a mistake, however, to assume that the prehistoric Sumerians were exact astron
omers. Probably they were, like the Aryo-Indians of the
Vedic period, "not very accurate observers ".2
It is of special interest to i find that the stars were
grouped by the Babylonians at the earliest period in
companies of seven. The importance of this magical
number is emphasized by the group of seven demons which rose from the deep to rage over the land (p. 71).
Perhaps the sanctity of Seven was suggested by Orion, the Bears, and the Pleiad, one of which constellations may have been the "Sevenfold" deity addressed as "one".
At any rate arbitrary groupings of other stars into com
panies of seven took place, for references are made to
1 Religion of tht Ancient Egyptians, A. Wiedemann, p. 30.

ASTROLOGY AND ASTRONOMY 301
the seven Tikshi, the seven Lumashi, and the seven
Mashi, which are older than the signs of the Zodiac;
so far as can be ascertained these groups were selected
from various constellations. When the five planets were
identified, they were associated with the sun and moon
and connected with the chief gods of the Hammurabi
pantheon. A bilingual list in the British Museum
arranges the sevenfold planetary group in the following order: The moon, Sin. The sun, Shamash. Jupiter, Merodach.
Venus, Ishtar.
Saturn, Ninip (Nirig). Mercury, Nebo. Mars, Nergal.
An ancient name of the moon was Aa, A, or Ai, which recalls the Egyptian Adh or Ah. The Sumerian moon
was Aku, "the measurer ", like Thoth of Egypt, who in his lunar character as a Fate measured out the lives of
men, and was a god of architects, mathematicians, and
scribes. The moon was the parent of the sun or its
spouse; and might be male, or female, or both as a bi
sexual deity. As the "bull of light
"
Jupiter had solar associations; he was also the shepherd of the stars, a title shared by
Tammuz as Orion ; Nin-Girsu, a developed form of Tammuz, was identified with both Orion and Jupiter.
Ishtar's identification with Venus is of special interest.
When that planet was at its brightest phase, its rays were referred to as "the beard" of the goddess; she was the
"bearded Aphrodite" a bisexual deity evidently. The astrologers regarded the bright Venus as lucky and the
rayless Venus as unlucky.



302 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
Saturn was Nirig, who is best known as Ninip, a deity who was displaced by Enlil, the elder Bel, and afterwards
regarded as his son. His story has not been recovered,
but from the references made to it there is little doubt
that it was a version of the widespread myth about the
elder deity who was slain by his son, as Saturn was by
Jupiter and Dyaus by Indra. It may have resembled the
lost Egyptian myth which explained the existence of the
two Horuses Horus the elder, and Horus, the posthu
mous son of Osiris. At any rate, it is of interest to find
in this connection that in Egypt the planet Saturn was
Her-Ka, "Horus the Bull". Ninip was also identified with the bull. Both deities were also connected with the
spring sun, like Tammuz, and were terrible slayers of their
enemies. Ninip raged through Babylonia like a storm flood, and Horus swept down the Nile, slaying the
followers of Set. As the divine sower of seed, Ninip
may have developed from Tammuz as Horus did from Osiris. Each were at once the father and the son,
different forms of the same deity at various seasons of
the year. The elder god was displaced by the son
(spring), and when the son grew old his son slew him
in turn. As the planet Saturn, Ninip was the ghost of the elder god, and as the son of Bel he was the solar war
god of spring, the great wild bull, the god of fertility.
He was also as Ber "lord of the wild boar", an animal associated with Rimmon.1
Nebo (Nabu), who was identified with Mercury, was
a god of Borsippa. He was a messenger and "announcer"
of the gods, as the Egyptian Horus in his connection with
Jupiter was Her-ap-sheta, "Horus the opener of that which is secret ",2 Nebo's original character is obscure.

He appears to have beeji a highly developed deity of a
people well advanced in civilization when he was exalted
as the divine patron of Borsippa. Although Hammurabi
ignored him, he was subsequently invoked with Mero
dach, and had probably much in common with Merodach. Indeed, Merodach was also identified with the planet Mercury. Like the Greek Hermes, Nebo was a messen
ger of the gods and an instructor of mankind. Jastrow
regards him as "a counterpart of Ea", and says: "Like
Ea, he is the embodiment and source of wisdom. The
art of writing and therefore of all literature is more par
ticularly associated with him. A common form of his name
designates him as the *god of the stylus Y' 1 He appears
also to have been a developed form of Tammuz, who was an incarnation of Ea. Professor Pinches shows that one of his names, Mermer, was also a non-Semitic name of
Ramman. 2 Tammuz resembled Ramman in his character as a spring god of war. It would seem that Merodach
as Jupiter displaced at Babylon Nebo as Saturn, the elder
god, as Bel Enlil displaced the elder Ninip at Nippur.
The god of Mars was Nergal, the patron deity of
Cuthah,3 who descended into the Underworld and forced
into submission Eresh-ki-gal (Persephone), with whom he
was afterwards associated. His " name ", says Professor
Pinches, "is supposed to mean c lord of the great habita
tion ', which would be a parallel to that of his spouse,
Eresh-ki-gal".4 At Erech he symbolized the destroying influence of the sun, and was accompanied by the demons
of pestilence. Mars was a planet of evil, plague, and death; its animal form was the wolf. In Egypt it was

304 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
called Herdesher, " the Red Hprus ", and in Greece it
was associated with Ares (the Roman Mars), the war god, who assumed his boar form to slay Adonis (Tammuz).
Nergal was also a fire god like the Aryo-Indian Agni,
who, as has been shown, links with Tammuz as a demon
slayer and a god of fertility. It may be that Nergal was a specialized form of Tammuz, who, in a version of the myth, was reputed to have entered the Underworld as a
conqueror when claimed by Eresh-ki-gal, and to have become, like Osiris, the lord of the dead. If so, Nergal was at once the slayer and the slain.
The various Babylonian deities who were identified with
the planets had their characters sharply defined as mem
bers of an organized pantheon. But before this development took place certain of the prominent heavenly bodies,
perhaps all the planets, were evidently regarded as mani
festations of one deity, the primeval Tammuz, who was
a form of Ea, or of the twin deities Ea and Anu. Tam
muz may have been the " sevenfold one " of the hymns.
At a still earlier period the stars were manifestations of
the Power whom the jungle dwellers of Chota Nagpur attempt to propitiate the "world soul" of the cultured
Brahmans of the post-Vedic Indian Age. As much is suggested by the resemblances which the conventionalized
planetary deities bear to Tammuz, whose attributes they
symbolized, and by the Egyptian conception that the sun,
Jupiter, Saturn, and Mars were manifestations of Horus.
Tammuz and Horus may have been personifications of
the Power or World Soul vaguely recognized in the stage of Naturalism.
The influence of animistic modes of thought may be
traced in the idea that the planets and stars were the
ghosts of gods who were superseded by their sons. These
sons were identical with their fathers ; they became, as



ASTROLOGY AND ASTRONOMY 305
in Egypt, " husbands of their mothers ". This idea
was perpetuated in the Aryo-Indian Laws of Manu, in which it is set forth that <c the husband, after conception
by his wife, becomes an embryo and is born again of
her ".* The deities died every year, but death was simply
change. Yet they remained in the separate forms they
assumed in their progress round " the wide circle of
necessity". Horus was remembered as various planets as the falcon, as the elder sun god, and as the son
of Osiris; and Tammuz was the spring sun, the child,
youth, warrior, the deity of fertility, and the lord of
death (Orion-Nergal), and, as has been suggested, all
the planets. The stars were also the ghosts of deities who died
daily. When the sun perished as an old man at evening, it rose in the heavens as Orion, or went out and in among
the stars as the shepherd of the flock, Jupiter, the planet of Merodach in Babylonia, and Attis in Asia Minor. The
flock was the group of heavenly spirits invisible by day,
the " host of heaven " manifestations or ghosts of the
emissaries of the controlling power or powers.
The planets presided over various months of the
year. Sin (the moon) was associated with the third
month; it also controlled the calendar; Ninip (Saturn) was associated with the fourth month, Ishtar (Venus) with
the sixth, Shamash (the sun) with the seventh, Merodach
(Jupiter) with the eighth, Nergal (Mars) with the ninth,
and a messenger of the gods, probably Nebo (Mercury), with the tenth.
Each month was also controlled by a zodiacal constel
lation. In the Creation myth of Babylon it is stated that
when Merodach engaged in the work of setting the
Universe in order he "set all the great gods in their

several stations ", and "also created their images, the
stars of the Zodiac, 1 and fixed them all" (p. 147).
Our signs of the Zodiac are of Babylonian origin. They were passed on to the Greeks by the Phoenicians
and Hittites. " There was a time ", says Professor Sayce,
"when the Hittites were profoundly affected by Baby
lonian civilization, religion, and art. . . ." They "carried the time-worn civilizations of Babylonia and Egypt to
the furthest boundary of Egypt, and there handed them
over to the West in the grey dawn of European history.
. . . Greek traditions affirmed that the rulers of Mykense
had come from Lydia, bringing with them the civiliza
tion and treasures of Asia Minor. The tradition has been confirmed by modern research. While certain elements
belonging to the prehistoric culture of Greece, as revealed at Mykense and elsewhere, were derived from Egypt and
Phoenicia, there are others which point to Asia Minor
as their source. And the culture of Asia Minor was
Hittite."*
The early Babylonian astronomers did not know, of course, that the earth revolved round the sun. They
believed that the sun travelled across the heavens
flying like a bird or sailing like a boat.3 In studying its
movements they observed that it always travelled from
west to east along a broad path, swinging from side to
side of it in the course of the year. This path is the

The sun maiden also married the moon god. The Vedic gods ran a race and Jndra and Agni were the winners. The tun was "of the nature of Agni". Indian Myth and Legend^ pp. 14,

line of the sun's path is the Ecliptic. The Babylonian scientists divided the Ecliptic into twelve equal parts,
and grouped in each part the stars which formed their
constellations; these are also called "Signs of the Zodiac ".
Each month had thus its sign or constellation.
The names borne at the present day by the signs of
the Zodiac are easily remembered even by children, who
are encouraged to repeat the following familiar lines:
The Ram y the Bull, the heavenly Twins,
And next the Crab, the Lion shines.
The Virgin and the Scales;
The Scorpion, Archer, and Sea goat, The man that holds the water pot,
And Fish with glitt'ring 1 tails.
The table on p. 308 shows that our signs are derived from ancient Babylonia.
The celestial regions were also divided into three or
more parts. Three ""fields" were allotted to the ancient
triad formed by Ea, Anu, and Bel. The zodiacal "path"
ran through these " fields ". Ea's field was in the west,
and was associated with Amurru, the land of the Amorites;
Anu's field was in the south, and was associated with
Elam; and Bel's central "field" was associated with the
land of Akkad. When the rulers of Akkad called them
selves "kings of the four quarters", the reference was to
the countries associated with the three divine fields and
to Gutium 2
(east = our north-east). Was Gutium associated with demons, as in Scandinavia the north-east was
associated with the giants against whom Thor waged war ?
The Babylonian Creation myth states that Merodach, having fixed the stars of the Zodiac, made three stars for

each month (p. 147). Mr. Robert Brown, jun., who has
dealt as exhaustively with the astronomical problems of
Babylonia as the available data permitted him, is of opinion that the leading stars of three constellations are referred



ASTROLOGY AND ASTRONOMY 309
to, viz.: (i) the central or zodiacal constellations, (2) the
northern constellations, and (3) the southern constella
tions. We have thus a scheme of thirty-six constellations.
The " twelve zodiacal stars were flanked on either side by
twelve non-zodiacal stars ". Mr. Brown quotes Diodorus,
who gave a r6sum of Babylonian astronomico-astrology,
in this connection. He said that " the five planets were
called c
Interpreters'; and in subjection to these were marshalled c Thirty Stars', which were styled
c Divinities of the
Council'. . . The chiefs of the Divinities are twelve in
number, to each of whom they assign a month and one of the twelve signs of the Zodiac." Through these
twelve signs sun, moon, and planets run their courses.
" And with the zodiacal circle they mark out twenty-four
stars, half of which they say are arranged in the north and half in the south." 1 Mr. Brown shows that the thirty stars
referred to " constituted the original Euphratean Lunar
Zodiac, the parent of the seven ancient lunar zodiacs which
have come down to us, namely, the Persian, Sogdian, Khorasmian, Chinese, Indian, Arab, and Coptic schemes ".
The three constellations associated with each month
had each a symbolic significance: they reflected the characters of their months. At the height of the rainy season, for instance, the month of Ramman, the thunder god, was presided over by the zodiacal constellation of the water
urn, the northern constellation " Fish of the Canal ", and the southern "the Horse". In India the black horse
was sacrificed at rain-getting and fertility ceremonies. The
months of growth, pestilence, and scorching sun heat were
in turn symbolized. The "Great Bear" was the "chariot"
= "Charles's Wain", and the "Milky Way" the "river
of the high cloud ", the Celestial Euphrates, as in Egypt
it was the Celestial Nile.

310 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
Of special interest among the many problems presented by Babylonian astronomical lore is the theory of Cosmic periods or Ages of the Universe. In the Indian,
Greek, and Irish mythologies there are four Ages the Silvern (white). Golden (yellow), the Bronze (red), and
the Iron (black). As has been already indicated, Mr. R.
Brown, jun., shows that u the Indian system of Yugas, or
ages of the world, presents many features which forcibly
remind us of the Euphratean scheme". The Babylonians
had ten antediluvian kings, who were reputed to have
reigned for vast periods, the total of which amounted to
1 20 saroi, or 432,000 years. These figures at once recall
the Indian Maha-yuga of 4,320,000 years = 432,000 x
10. Apparently the Babylonian and Indian systems of
calculation were of common origin. In both countries the measurements of time and space were arrived at by utilizing the numerals 10 and 6.
When primitive man began to count he adopted a method which comes naturally to every schoolboy ; he utilized his fingers. Twice five gave him ten, and from
ten he progressed to twenty, and then on to a hundred
and beyond. In making measurements his hands, arms,
and feet were at his service. We are still measuring by
feet and yards (standardized strides) in this country, while
those who engage in the immemorial art of knitting, and,
in doing so, repeat designs found on neolithic pottery, continue to measure in finger breadths, finger lengths, and hand breadths as did the ancient folks who called an
arm length a cubit. Nor has the span been forgotten,
especially by boys in their games with marbles; the space from the end of the thumb to the end of the little finger when the hand is extended must have been an important measurement from the earliest times.
As he made progress in calculations, the primitive



ASTROLOGY AND ASTRONOMY 311
Babylonian appears to have been struck by other details
in his anatomy besides his sets of five fingers and five
toes. He observed, for instance, that his fingers were divided into three parts and his thumb into two parts
only;
1 four fingers multiplied by three gave him twelve,
and multiplying 12 by 3 he reached 36. Apparently the figure 6 attracted him. His body was divided into 6
parts 2 arms, 2 legs, the head, and the trunk; his 2 ears, 2 eyes, and mouth, and nose also gave him 6. The
basal 6, multiplied by his 10 fingers, gave him 60, and
60 x 2 (for his 2 hands) gave him 120. In Babylonian arithmetic 6 and 60 are important numbers, and it is not
surprising to find that in the system of numerals the
signs for i and 10 combined represent 60.
In fixing the length of a mythical period his first great calculation of 120 came naturally to the Babylonian, and when he undertook to measure the Zodiac he equated
time and space by fixing on 120 degrees. His first zodiac was the Sumerian lunar zodiac, which contained
thirty moon chambers associated with the "Thirty Stars"
of the tablets, and referred to by Diodorus as " Divinities
of the Council". The chiefs of the Thirty numbered
twelve. In this system the year began in the winter
solstice. Mr. Hewitt has shown that the chief annual
1 In India "finger counting" (Kaur guna) is associated with prayer or the repeating of mantras. The counting is performed by the thumb, which, when the hand is drawn up, touches the upper part of the third finger. The two upper "chambers" of the third ringer are counted, then the two upper "chambers" of the little finger; the thumb then touches the tip of each finger from the little finger to the first; when it comes down into the upper chamber of the first finger 9 is counted. By a similar process each round
of 9 on the right hand is recorded by the left up to 12; 12 X 9= 108 repetitions of a
mantra. The upper "chambers" of the fingers are the "best" or "highest" (uttama),
the lower (adhama) chambers are not utilized in the prayer-counting process. When Hindus sit cross-legged at prayers, with closed eyes, the right hand is raised from the elbow in front of the body, and the thumb moves each time a mantra is repeated; the left hand lies palm upward on the left knee, and the thumb moves each time nine mantras have been counted.



312 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
festival of the Indian Dravidians begins with the first
full moon after the winter festival, and Mr. Brown
emphasizes the fact that the list of Tamil (Dravidian)
lunar and solar months are named like the Babylonian
constellations.1 "Lunar chronology ", wrote Professor
Max M tiller, " seems everywhere to have preceded solar
chronology." 2 The later Semitic Babylonian system had twelve solar chambers and the thirty-six constellations.
Each degree was divided into sixty minutes, and each minute into sixty seconds. The hours of the day and
night each numbered twelve.
Multiplying 6 by 10 (pur), the Babylonian arrived at 60 (soss); 60 x 10 gave him 600 (ner), and 600 x 6, 3600
(sar), while 3600 x 10 gave him 36,000, and 36,000 x 12, 432,000 years, or 120 saroi, which is equal to the "sar"
multiplied by the "soss"x2. "Pur" signifies "heap"
the ten fingers closed after being counted; and "ner"
signifies "foot". Mr, George Bertin suggests that when
6 x 10 fingers gave 60 this number was multiplied by the ten toes, with the result that 600 was afterwards associated
with the feet (ner). The Babylonian sign for 10 resembles
the impression of two feet with heels closed and toes apart.
This suggests a primitive record of the first round of
finger counting. In India this Babylonian system of calculation was
developed during the Brahmanical period. The four Yugas or Ages, representing the four fingers used by the primitive mathematicians, totalled 12,000 divine years,
a period which was called a Maha-yuga; it equalled the
Babylonian 120 saroi, multiplied by 100. Ten times a hundred of these periods gave a "Day of Brahma".
Each day of the gods, it was explained by the
1 Primitive Constellations, R. Brown, jun., vol. ii, p. 61 ; and Early History of JSort/iern India^ J, F. Hewitt, pp. 551-2. * Ri^ueda-Samhita^ vol. iv (1892), p. 67.

Brahmans, was a year to mortals. Multiplied by 360
days, 12,000 divine years equalled 4,320,000 human
years. This Maha-yuga, multiplied by 1000, gave the
"Day of Brahma " as 4,320,000,000 human years.
The shortest Indian Yuga is the Babylonian 120 saroi
multiplied by 10=1200 divine years for the Kali Yuga; twice that number gives the Dvapara Yuga of 2400
divine years; then the Treta Yuga is 2400+ 1200 = 3600
divine years, and Krita Yuga 3600+1200 = 4800 divine
years. The influence of Babylonia is apparent in these calcu
lations. During the Vedic period "Yuga" usually
signified a "generation", and there are no certain refer
ences to the four Ages as such. The names "Kali",
"Dvapara", "Treta", and "Krita" "occur as the
designations of throws of dice". 1 It was after the arrival
of the " late comers ", the post-Vedic Aryans, that the
Yuga system was developed in India.2
In Indian Myth and Legend* it is shown that the Indian
and Irish Ages have the same colour sequence: (i) White
or Silvern, (2) Red or Bronze, (3) Yellow or Golden, and (4) Black or Iron. The Greek order is: (i) Golden, (2)
Silvern, (3) Bronze, and (4) Iron. The Babylonians coloured the seven planets as follows :
the moon, silvern; the sun, golden; Mars, red; Saturn,
black; Jupiter, orange; Venus, yellow; and Mercury, blue.

probable that the planets were similarly connected with mythical ages which were equated with the cc four
quarters
" of the celestial regions and the four regions of
the earth, which in Gaelic story are called " the four red
divisions of the world ". Three of the planets may have been heralds of change.
Venus, as "Dilbat", was the " Proclaimer", and both Jupiter and Mercury were called "Face voices of light ",
and " Heroes of the rising sun " among other names.
Jupiter may have been the herald of the "Golden Age"
as a morning star. This planet was also associated with
bronze, as " Kakkub Urud", "the star of bronze", while
Mars was " Kakkub Aban Kha-urud", "the star of the
bronze fish stone". Mercury, the lapis lazuli planet, may have been connected with the black Saturn, the
ghost of the dead sun, the demoniac elder god ; in Egypt
lapis lazuli was the hair colour of Ra when he grew old,
and Egyptologists translate it as black. 1 The rare and
regular appearances of Mercury may have suggested the planet's connection with a recurring Age. Venus as an
evening star might be regarded as the herald of the lunar
or silver age ; she was propitious as a bearded deity and
interchanged with Merodach as a seasonal herald.
Connecting Jupiter with the sun as a propitious
planet, and with Mars as a destroying planet, Venus with the moon, and Mercury with Saturn, we have left four
colour schemes which suggest the Golden, Silvern, Bronze,
and Iron Ages. The Greek order of mythical ages may
have had a solar significance, beginning as it does with
the "golden" period. On the other hand the Indian and
Irish systems begin with the Silvern or white lunar period.

In India the White Age (Treta Yuga) was the age of perfect men, and in Greece the Golden Age was the age
of men who lived like gods. Thus the first ages in both
cases were "Perfect" Ages. The Bronze Age of Greece
was the age of notorious fighters and takers of life ; in Babylonia the bronze planet Mars was the symbol of the
destroying Nergal, god of war and pestilence, while Jupiter was also a destroyer as Merodach, the slayer of Tiamat. In India the Black Age is the age of wickedness.
The Babylonian Saturn, as we have seen, is black, and its
god, Ninip, was the destroying boar, which recalls the
black boar of the Egyptian demon (or elder god) Set.
The Greek Cronos was a destroyer even of his own children. All the elder gods had demoniac traits like the
ghosts of human beings. As the Babylonian lunar zodiac was imported into
India before solar worship and the solar zodiac were
developed, so too may have been the germs of the Yuga
doctrine, which appears to have a long history. Greece, on the other hand, came under the influence of Babylon
at a much later period. In Egypt Ra, the sun god, was an antediluvian king, and he was followed by Osiris.
Osiris was slain by Set, who was depicted sometimes red
and sometimes black. There was also a Horus Age.
The Irish system of ages suggests an early cultural drift into Europe, through Asia Minor, and along the
uplands occupied by the representatives of the Alpine
or Armenoid peoples who have been traced from Hindu
Kush to Brittany. The culture of Gaul resembles that
of India in certain particulars; both the Gauls and the
post-Vedic Aryans, for instance, believed in the doctrine
of Transmigration of Souls, and practised " suttee ".
After the Roman occupation of Gaul, Ireland appears to
have been the refuge of Gaulish scholars, who imported

316 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
their beliefs and traditions and laid the foundations of
that brilliant culture which shed lustre on the Green Isle
in late Pagan and early Christian times.
The part played by the Mitanni people of Aryan speech in distributing Asiatic culture throughout Europe
may have been considerable, but we know little or
nothing regarding their movements and influence, nor has sufficient evidence been forthcoming to connect them
with the cremating invaders of the Bronze Age, who penetrated as far as northern Scotland and Scandinavia.
On the other hand it is certain that the Hittites adopted
the planetary system of Babylonia and passed it on to
Europeans, including the Greeks. The five planets Ninip, Merodach, Nergal, Ishtar, and Nebo were called by the
Greeks after their gods Kronos, Zeus, Ares, Aphrodite,
and Hermes, and by the Romans Saturnus, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, and Mercurius. It must be recognized, however^
that these equations were somewhat arbitrary. Ninip resembled Kronos and Saturnus as a father, but he was also at the same time a son; he was the Egyptian Horus
the elder and Horus the younger in one. Merodach was similarly of complex character a combination of Ea,
Anu, Enlil, and Tammuz, who acquired, when exalted by
the Amoritic Dynasty of Babylon, the attributes of the
thunder god Adad-Ramman in the form of Amurru,
"lord of the mountains'*. During the Hammurabi Age
Amurru was significantly popular in personal names. It is as Amurru-Ramman that Merodach bears comparison
with Zeus. He also links with Hercules. Too much must not be made, therefore, of the Greek and Roman
identifications of alien deities with their own. Mulla, the
Gaulish mule god, may have resembled Mars somewhat,
but it is a "far cry" from Mars-Mulla to Mars-Nergal,
as it is also from the Gaulish Moccus, the boar, called



ASTROLOGY AND ASTRONOMY 317
"Mercury", to Nebo, the god of culture, who was the
"Mercury" of the Tigro-Euphrates valley. Similarly
the differences between " Jupiter-Amon" of Egypt and
" Jupiter-Merodach" of Babylon were more pronounced than the resemblances.
The basal idea in Babylonian astrology appears to be
the recognition of the astral bodies as spirits or fates, who exercised an influence over the gods, the world, and man
kind. These were worshipped in groups when they were
yet nameless. The group addressed, " Powerful, O sevenfold, one are ye", may have been a constellation
consisting of seven stars.1 The worship of stars and
planets, which were identified and named, "seems never to
have spread ", says Professor Sayce, " beyond the learned classes, and to have remained to the last an artificial
system. The mass of the people worshipped the stars as a whole, but it was only as a whole and not individually,"
2
The masses perpetuated ancient animistic beliefs, like the
pre-Hellenic inhabitants of Greece. " The Pelasgians, as
I was informed at Dodona," wrote Herodotus, " formerly
offered all things indiscriminately to the gods. They
distinguished them by no name or surname, for they were hitherto unacquainted with either ; but they called
them gods, which by its etymology means disposers, from
observing the orderly disposition and distribution of the
various parts of the universe." 3 The oldest deities are those which bore no individual names. They were simply
"Fates" or groups called "Sevenfold". The crude giant
gods of Scotland are " Fomhairean "
(Fomorians), and do not have individual names as in Ireland. Families and
tribes were controlled by the Fates or nameless gods,
1 As Nin-Girsu, Tammuz was associated with "sevenfold" Oiion.

which might appear as beasts or birds, or be heard knock
ing or screaming. In the Babylonian astral hymns, the star spirits are associated with the gods, and are revealers of the decrees
of Fate. " Ye brilliant stars ... ye bright ones . . .
to destroy evil did Anu create you. ... At thy com
mand mankind was named (created) ! Give thou the Word, and with thee let the great gods stand! Give
thou my judgment, make my decision !
"l
The Indian evidence shows that the constellations,
and especially the bright stars, were identified before the
planets. Indeed, in Vedic literature there is no certain
reference to a single planet, although constellations are
named. It seems highly probable that before the Baby
lonian gods were associated with the astral bodies, the
belief obtained that the stars exercised an influence over human lives. In one of the Indian "Forest Books'*, for instance, reference is made to a man who was "born under
the Nakshatra Rohini ". 2 " Nakshatras " are stars in the Rigveda and later, and "lunar mansions" in Brahmanical
compositions.3 " Rohini, ( ruddy ', is the name of a conspicuously reddish star, a Tauri or Aldebaran, and denotes the group of the Hyades." 4 This reference may be dated
before 600 B.C., perhaps 800 B.C. From Greece comes the evidence of Plutarch regard
ing the principles of Babylonian astrology. " Respecting
the planets, which they call the birth-ruling divinities, the
Chaldeans", he wrote, "lay down that two (Venus and
Jupiter) are propitious, and two (Mars and Saturn)
malign, and three (Sun, Moon, and Mercury) of a middle
nature, and one common." " That is," Mr. Brown com

ASTROLOGY AND ASTRONOMY 319
ments, "an astrologer would say, these three are propitious with the good, and may be malign with the bad." 1 Jastrow's views in this connection seem highly con
troversial. He holds that Babylonian astrology dealt
simply with national affairs, and had no concern with " the
conditions under which the individual was born "
; it did
not predict " the fate in store for him ". He believes
that the Greeks transformed Babylonian astrology and infused it with the spirit of individualism which is a
characteristic of their religion, and that they were the first
to give astrology a personal significance.
Jastrow also perpetuates the idea that astronomy began
with the Greeks. " Several centuries before the days of
Alexander the Great/' he says, a the Greeks had begun
to cultivate the study of the heavens, not for purposes of
divination, but prompted by a scientific spirit as an intellectual discipline that might help them to solve the
mysteries of the universe." It is possible, however, to
overrate the " scientific spirit
" of the Greeks, who, like
the Japanese in our own day, were accomplished borrowers from other civilizations. That astronomy had
humble beginnings in Greece as elsewhere is highly pro
bable. The late Mr. Andrew Lang wrote in this connection :
" The very oddest example of the survival of
the notion that the stars are men and women is found in
the Pax of Aristophanes. Trygaeus in that comedy has
just made an expedition to heaven. A slave meets him, and asks him :
c Is not the story true, then, that we be
come stars when we die?' The answer is, 'Certainly';
and Trygaeus points out the star into which Ion of
Chios has just been metamorphosed." Mr. Lang added:
"Aristophanes is making fun of some popular Greek
superstition ". The Eskimos, Persians, Aryo-Indians,
1 Primitive Constellations, vol. i, p. 343.



320 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
Germans, New Zealanders, and others had a similar
superstition.
1
Jastrow goes on to say that the Greeks " imparted their scientific view of the Universe to the East. They
became the teachers of the East in astronomy as in medi
cine and other sciences, and the credit of having dis
covered the law of the precession of the equinoxes belongs
to Hipparchus, the Greek astronomer, who announced
this important theory about the year 130 B.C." 2 Undoubtedly the Greeks contributed to the advancement of
the science of astronomy, with which, as other authorities
believe, they became acquainted after it had become well
developed as a science by the Assyrians and Babylonians.
"In return for improved methods of astronomical
calculation which," Jastrow says, " /'/ may be assumed (the italics are ours), contact with Greek science gave to the
Babylonian astronomers, the Greeks accepted from the Babylonians the names of the constellations of the eclip
tic." 3 This is a grudging admission ; they evidently
accepted more than the mere names.
Jastrow's hypothesis is certainly interesting, especially as he is an Oriental linguist of high repute. But it is
not generally accepted. The sudden advance made by
the Tigro-Euphratean astronomers when Assyria was at the height of its glory, may have been due to the dis
coveries made by great native scientists, the Newtons and
the Herschels of past ages, who had studied the data
accumulated by generations of astrologers, the earliest recorders of the movements of the heavenly bodies. It
is hard to believe that the Greeks made much progress

Babylonians were acquainted with the precession of the equinoxes. Das Alter der Babylonischen Astronomic (Hinrichs, Leipzig, 1908), pp. 47 et seq. 3 Aspects of Religious Belief and Practice in Babylonia and Assyria, pp. 207 et seq.

as scientists before they had identified the planets, and
become familiar with the Babylonian constellations through
the medium of the Hittites or the Phoenicians. What is
known for certain is that long centuries before the Greek
science was heard of, there were scientists in Babylonia.
During the Sumerian period " the forms and relations of
geometry", says Professor Goodspeed, "were employed
for purposes of augury. The heavens were mapped out, and the courses of the heavenly bodies traced to de
termine the bearing of their movements upon human
destinies/' 1
Several centuries before Hipparchus was born, the
Assyrian kings had in their palaces official astronomers who
were able to foretell, with varying degrees of accuracy, when eclipses would take place. Instructions were sent
to various observatories, in the king's name, to send in
reports of forthcoming eclipses. A translation of one of these official documents sent from the observatory of Baby
lon to Nineveh, has been published by Professor Harper.
The following are extracts from it: "As for the eclipse
of the moon about which the king my lord has written to
me, a watch was kept for it in the cities of Akkad, Bor
sippa, and Nippur. We observed it ourselves in the city
of Akkad. . . . And whereas the king my lord ordered
me to observe also the eclipse of the sun, I watched to see whether it took place or not, and what passed before
my eyes I now report to the king my lord. It was an
eclipse of the moon that took place. ... It was total over Syria, and the shadow fell on the land of the
Amorites, the land of the Hittites, and in part on the land of the Chaldees." Professor Sayce comments :
" We gather from this letter that there were no less than
three observatories in Northern Babylonia : one at Akkad,
1 A History of the Babylonians and Assyrians, p. 93.



322 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
near Sippara ; one at Nippur, now Niffer ; and one at Bor
sippa, within sight of Babylon. As Borsippa possessed a university, it was natural that one of the three observa
tories should be established there." 1
It is evident that before the astronomers at Nineveh
could foretell eclipses, they had achieved considerable
progress as scientists. The data at their disposal prob
ably covered nearly two thousand years. Mr. Brown, junior, calculates that the signs of the Zodiac were fixed
in the year 2084 B.C.2 These star groups do not now
occupy the positions in which they were observed by the
early astronomers, because the revolving earth is rocking like a top, with the result that the pole does not always
keep pointing at the same spot in the heavens. Each
year the meeting-place of the imaginary lines of the ecliptic and equator is moving westward at the rate of
about fifty seconds. In time ages hence the pole will
circle round to the point it spun at when the constella
tions were named by the Babylonians. It is by calculat
ing the period occupied by this world-curve that the date 2084 B.C. has been arrived at.
As a result of the world-rocking process, the present
day " signs of the Zodiac " do not correspond with the
constellations. In March, for instance, when the sun
crosses the equator it enters the sign of the Ram (Aries),
but does not reach the constellation till the 2Oth, as the
comparative table shows on p. 308.
When " the ecliptic was marked off into the twelve
regions" and the signs of the Zodiac were designated, "the year of three hundred sixty-five and one-fourth
days was known", says Goodspeed, "though the common year was reckoned according to twelve months of thirty
1 Babylonians and Assyrian*; Life and Customs, pp. 219, 220. 8 Primitive Constellations, vol. ii, pp, 147 et sey.



ASTROLOGY AND ASTRONOMY 323
days each, 1 and equated with the solar year by inter
calating a month at the proper times. . . . The month
was divided into weeks of seven days. . . . The clepsydra and the sundial were Babylonian inventions for measuring
time." 2
The sundial of Ahaz was probably of Babylonian
design. When the shadow went "ten degrees back
ward " (2 KingSy xx, 11) ambassadors were sent from
Babylon " to enquire of the wonder that was done in
the land" (2 Chron., xxxii, 31). It was believed that the
king's illness was connected with the incident. According
to astronomical calculation there was a partial eclipse of
the sun which was visible at Jerusalem on nth January,
689 B.C., about 11.30 a.m. When the upper part of the solar disc was obscured, the shadow on the dial was
strangely affected.
The Babylonian astrologers in their official documents were more concerned regarding international omens than
those which affected individuals. They made observa
tions not only of the stars, but also the moon, which, as
has been shown, was one of their planets, and took note of the clouds and the wind likewise.
As portions of the heavens were assigned to various
countries, so was the moon divided into four quarters for
the same purpose the upper part for the north, Gutium,
the lower for the south, Akkad or Babylonia, the eastern
part for Elam, and the western for Amurru. The crescent
was also divided in like manner; looking southward the
astrologers assigned the right horn to the west and the left to the east. In addition, certain days and certain months were connected with the different regions. Lunar
astrology was therefore of complicated character. When
1 The Aryo-Indians had a lunar year of 360 days (Fedic Index% ii, 158).
2 A History of the Babylonians and Assyrians, p. 94.



324 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
the moon was dim at the particular phase which was connected with Amurru, it was believed that the fortunes of
that region were in decline, and if it happened to shine
brightly in the Babylonian phase the time was considered
auspicious to wage war in the west. Great importance was attached to eclipses, which were fortunately recorded, with the result that the ancient astronomers were ultimately
enabled to forecast them.
The destinies of the various states in the four quarters
were similarly influenced by the planets. When Venus, for instance, rose brightly in the field of Anu, it was a
" prosperor
" for Elam ; if it were dim it foretold mis
fortune. Much importance was also attached to the
positions occupied by the constellations when the planets were propitious or otherwise ; no king would venture
forth on an expedition under a "yoke of inauspicious stars".
Biblical references to the stars make mention of well
known Babylonian constellations:
Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion? Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth (?the Zodiac) in his season? or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons? Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set the dominion thereof
in the earth? Job, xxxviii, 31-33. Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south. Job, ix, 9.
Seek him that maketh the seven stars and Orion, and turneth the shadow of death into the morning, and maketh the day dark
with night. Amos, v, 8.
The so-called science of astrology, which had origin in
ancient Babylonia and spread eastward and west, is not yet
extinct, and has its believers even in our own country at
the present day, although they are not nearly so numerous as when Shakespeare made Malvolio read:



ASTROLOGY AND ASTRONOMY 325
In my stars I am above thee ; but be not afraid of greatness : some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have great
ness thrust upon 'em. Thy Fates open their hands. . . .*
or when Byron wrote:
Ye stars! which are the poetry of heaven!
If in your bright leaves we would read the fate
Of men and empires 't is to be forgiven
That in our aspirations to be great, Our destinies o'erleap their mortal state And claim a kindred with you. . . .
2
Our grave astronomers are no longer astrologers, but they still call certain constellations by the names given
them in Babylonia. Every time we look at our watches
we are reminded of the ancient mathematicians who
counted on their fingers and multiplied 10 by 6, to give us minutes and seconds, and divided the day and the
night into twelve hours by multiplying six by the two
leaden feet of Time. The past lives in the present.

THE rise of Assyria brings into prominence the national god
Ashur, who had been the city god of Asshur, the ancient
capital. When first met with, he is found to be a complex
and mystical deity, and the problem of his origin is conse
quently rendered exceedingly difficult. Philologists are not agreed as to the derivation of his name, and present as
varied views as they do when dealing with the name of
Osiris. Some give Ashur a geographical significance, urging that its original form was Aushar, "water field "; others
prefer the renderings "Holy", "the Beneficent One", or
"the Merciful One"; while not a few regard Ashur as
simply a dialectic form of the name of Anshar, the god
who, in the Assyrian version, or copy, of the Babylonian
Creation myth, is chief of the " host of heaven", and the
father of Anu, Ea, and Enlil.



THE NATIONAL GOD OF ASSYRIA 327
If Ashur is to be regarded as an abstract solar deity,
who was developed from a descriptive place name, it
follows that he had a history, like Arm or Ea, rooted in
Naturalism or Animism. We cannot assume that his
strictly local character was produced by modes of thought
which did not obtain elsewhere. The colonists who
settled at Asshur no doubt imported beliefs from some
cultural area; they must have either given recognition
to a god, or group of gods, or regarded the trees, hills, rivers, sun, moon, and stars, and the animals as manifesta
tions of the "self power" of the Universe, before they undertook the work of draining and cultivating the "water
field" and erecting permanent homes. Those who settled
at Nineveh, for instance, believed that they were protected
by the goddess Nina, the patron deity of the Sumerian
city of Nina. As this goddess was also worshipped at Lagash, and was one of the many forms of the Great
Mother, it would appear that in ancient times deities had
a tribal rather than a geographical significance. If the view is accepted that Ashur is Anshar, it can be urged that he was imported from Sumeria. <c Out of that
land (Shinar)", according to the Biblical reference, "went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh/' 1 Asshur, or Ashur
(identical, Delitzsch and Jastrow believe, with Ashir),2 may have been an eponymous hero a deified king like Etana,
or Gilgamesh, who was regarded as an incarnation of an
ancient god. As Anshar was an astral or early form of
Anu, the Sumerian city of origin may have been Erech,
1 Genesis, x, 1 1 . 2 " A number of tablets have been found in Cappadocia of the time of the Second Dynasty of Ur which show marked affinities with Assyria. The divine name Ashir, as in early Assyrian texts, the institution of eponyms and many personal names which occur in Assyria, are so characteristic that we must assume kinship of peoples. But whether they witness to a settlement in Cappadocia from Assyria, or vice versa, is not
yet clear." Ancient Assyria, C. H. W. Johns (Cambridge, 1912), pp. iz-ij.



328 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
where the worship of the mother goddess was also given
prominence. Damascius rendered Anshar's name as "Assoros", a
fact usually cited to establish Ashur's connection with
that deity. This writer stated that the Babylonians passed
over " Sige,
1 the mother, that has begotten heaven and
earth ", and made two Apason (Apsu), the husband, and
Tauthe (Tiawath or Tiamat), whose son was Moymis
(Mummu). From these another progeny came forth Lache and Lachos (Lachmu and Lachamu). These were followed by the progeny Kissare and Assoros (Kishar and
Anshar), "from which were produced Anos (Anu), Illillos
(Enlil) and Aos (Ea). And of Aos and Dauke (Dawkina
or Damkina) was born Belos (Bel Merodach), whom they
say is the Demiurge" 2 (the world artisan who carried out
the decrees of a higher being). Lachmu and Lachamu, like the second pair of the
ancient group of Egyptian deities, probably symbolized darkness as a reproducing and sustaining power. Anshar
was apparently an impersonation of the night sky, as his
son Anu was of the day sky. It may have been believed
that the soul of Anshar was in the moon as Nannar (Sin),
or in a star, or that the moon and the stars were mani
festations of him, and that the soul of Anu was in the
sun or the firmament, or that the sun, firmament, and the wind were forms of this "self power ". If Ashur combined the attributes of Anshar and Anu,
his early mystical character may be accounted for. Like
the Indian Brahma, he may have been in his highest form
an impersonation, or symbol, of the "self power" or "world soul" of developed Naturalism the "creator",
"preserver", and "destroyer" in one, a god of water, earth,
1 Sumcrian Ziku, apparently derived from Zi, the spiritual essence of life, the "self
power " of the Universe. 2 Pen Archon, cxxv.



THE NATIONAL GOD OF ASSYRIA 329
air, and sky, of sun, moon, and stars, fire and lightning, a god of the grove, whose essence was in the fig, or the fir
cone, as it was in all animals. The Egyptian god Amon of
Thebes, who was associated with water, earth, air, sky, sun
and moon, had a ram form, and was " the hidden one", was
developed from one of the elder eight gods; in the Pyra
mid Texts he and his consort are the fourth pair. When
Amon was fused with the specialized sun god Ra, he was
placed at the head of the Ennead as the Creator. " We
have traces'', says Jastrow, "of an Assyrian myth of Creation in which the sphere of creator is given to Ashur." 1 Before a single act of creation was conceived of, how
ever, the early peoples recognized the eternity of matter, which was permeated by the "self power" of which the
elder deities were vague phases. These were too vague,
indeed, to be worshipped individually. The forms of the
"self power" which were propitiated were trees, rivers, hills,
or animals. As indicated in the previous chapter, a tribe
worshipped an animal or natural object which dominated its
environment. The animal might be the source of the
food supply, or might have to be propitiated to ensure the
food supply. Consequently they identified the self power of the Universe with the particular animal with which they
were most concerned. One section identified the spirit of the heavens with the bull and another with the goat. In
India Dyaus was a bull, and his spouse, the earth mother,
Prithivi, was a cow. The Egyptian sky goddess Hathor was a cow, and other goddesses were identified with the
hippopotamus, the serpent, the cat, or the vulture. Ra, the sun god, was identified in turn with the cat, the ass,
the bull, the ram, and the crocodile, the various animal
forms of the local deities he had absorbed. The eagle in

330 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
Babylonia and India, and the vulture, falcon, and mysterious Phoenix in Egypt, were identified with the sun, fire,
wind, and lightning. The animals associated with the god
Ashur were the bull, the eagle, and the lion. He either
absorbed the attributes of other gods, or symbolized the "Self Power" of which the animals were manifestations.
The earliest germ of the Creation myth was the idea
that night was the parent of day, and water of the earth. Out of darkness and death came light and life. Life
was also motion. When the primordial waters became
troubled, life began to be. Out of the confusion came
order and organization. This process involved the idea
of a stable and controlling power, and the succession of
a group of deities passive deities and active deities.
When the Babylonian astrologers assisted in developing the Creation myth, they appear to have identified with
the stable and controlling spirit of the night heaven that
steadfast orb the Polar Star. Anshar, like Shakespeare's
Caesar, seemed to say:
I am constant as the northern star, Of whose true-fixed and resting quality There is no fellow in the firmament. The skies are painted with unnumbered sparks ;
They are all fire, and every one doth shine;
But there's but one in all doth hold his place. 1
Associated with the Polar Star was the constellation Ursa
Minor, "the Little Bear", called by the Babylonian astronomers, "the Lesser Chariot". There were chariots
before horses were introduced. A patesi of Lagash had
a chariot which was drawn by asses.
The seemingly steadfast Polar Star was called "Ilu
Sar ", "the god Shar", or Anshar, "star of the height ",
1 Julius Owr, act iii, scene I.



THE NATIONAL GOD OF ASSYRIA 331
or " Shar the most high ". It seemed to be situated at
the summit of the vault of heaven. The god Shar, there
fore, stood upon the Celestial mountain, the Babylonian
Olympus. He was the ghost of the elder god, who in
Babylonia was displaced by the younger god, Merodach, as Mercury, the morning star, or as the sun, the planet of day; and in Assyria by Ashur, as the sun, or Regulus, or Arcturus, or Orion. Yet father and son were identical.
They were phases of the One, the " self power ".
A deified reigning king was an incarnation of the god;
after death he merged in the god, as did the Egyptian
Unas. The eponymous hero Asshur may have similarly
merged in the universal Ashur, who, like Horus, an incarnation of Osiris, had many phases or forms.
Isaiah appears to have been familiar with the Tigro
Euphratean myths about the divinity of kings and the
displacement of the elder god by the younger god, of
whom the ruling monarch was an incarnation, and with the idea that the summit of the Celestial mountain was crowned by the "north star", the symbol of Anshar.
"Thou shalt take up this parable ", he exclaimed, making
use of Babylonian symbolism, " against the king of
Babylon and say, How hath the oppressor ceased ! the
golden city ceased! . . . How art thou fallen from
heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou
cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!
For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend unto
heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God;
I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the
sides of the north\ I will ascend above the heights of the
clouds; I will be like the most High." 1 The king is identified with Lucifer as the deity of fire and the morning
star ; he is the younger god who aspired to occupy the

332 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
mountain throne of his father, the god Shar the Polar or North Star.
It is possible that the Babylonian idea of a Celestial
mountain gave origin to the belief that the earth was a mountain surrounded by the outer ocean, beheld by Etana when he flew towards heaven on the eagle's back.
In India this hill is Mount Meru, the "world spine", which "sustains the earth "; it is surmounted by Indra's Valhal, or "the great city of Brahma". In Teutonic mythology the heavens revolve round the Polar Star,
which is called "Veraldar nagli ",* the "world spike";
while the earth is sustained by the " world tree ".
The "ded" amulet of Egypt symbolized the backbone
of Osiris as a world god : " ded " means " firm ",
"established"; 2 while at burial ceremonies the coffin was
set up on end, inside the tomb, "on a small sandhill
intended to represent the Mountain of the West the realm of the dead".3 The Babylonian temple towers
were apparently symbols of the " world hill ", At
Babylon, the Du-azaga, " holy mound ", was Merodach's
temple E-sagila, " the Temple of the High Head ".
E-kur, rendered " the house or temple of the Moun
tain ", was the temple of Bel Enlil at Nippur. At
Erech, the temple of the goddess Ishtar was E-anna, which connects her, as Nina or Ninni, with Anu, derived from "ana", "heaven". Ishtar was "Queen of heaven ". Now Polaris, situated at the summit of the celestial
mountain, was identified with the sacred goat, " the highest
of the flock of night ".* Ursa Minor (the "Little Bear"
constellation) may have been <c the goat with six heads ",

referred to by Professor Sayce.
1 The six astral goats or
goat-men were supposed to be dancing round the chief
goat-man or Satyr (Anshar). Even in the dialogues of Plato the immemorial belief was perpetuated that the
constellations were " moving as in a dance ". Dancing
began as a magical or religious practice, and the earliest astronomers saw their dancing customs reflected in the heavens by the constellations, whose movements were
rhythmical. No doubt, Isaiah had in mind the belief of
the Babylonians regarding the dance of their goat-gods when he foretold: "Their houses shall be full of doleful
creatures; and owls (ghosts) shall dwell there, and satyrs shall dance there ".2 In other words, there would be no
people left to perform religious dances beside the " desolate houses "; the stars only would be seen dancing round
Polaris.
Tammuz, like Anshar, as sentinel of the night heaven,
was a goat, as was also Nin-Girsu of Lagash. A Su
merian reference to "a white kid of En Mersi (Nin
Girsu)
" was translated into Semitic, " a white kid of
Tammuz ". The goat was also associated with Mero
dach. Babylonians, having prayed to that god to take away their diseases or their sins, released a goat, which
was driven into the desert. The present Polar Star,
which was not, of course, the Polar star of the earliest
astronomers, the world having rocked westward, is called in Arabic Al-Jedy, "the kid ". In India, the goat was connected with Agni and Varuna ; it was slain at funeral ceremonies to inform the gods that a soul was about to
enter heaven. Ea, the Sumerian lord of water, earth, and
heaven, was symbolized as a " goat fish ". Thor, the
1 Cuneiform Inscriptions of Western Asia, xxx, 1 1 .

tion, " or he-goats ".



334 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
Teutonic fertility and thunder god, had a chariot drawn
by goats. It is of interest to note that the sacred Sumerian goat bore on its forehead the same triangular
symbol as the Apis bull of Egypt.
Ashur was not a " goat of heaven ", but a " bull of heaven ", like the Sumerian Nannar (Sin), the moon god
of Ur, Ninip of Saturn, and Bel Enlil. As the bull,
however, he was, like Anshar, the ruling animal of the heavens; and like Anshar he had associated with him
" six divinities of council ".
Other deities who were similarly exalted as " high
heads " at various centres and at various periods, included
Anu, Bel Enlil, and Ea, Merodach, Nergal, and Shamash.
A symbol of the first three was a turban on a seat, or
altar, which may have represented the "world mountain 1
'.
Ea, as "the world spine", was symbolized as a column, with ram's head, standing on a throne, beside which crouched a "goat fish". Merodach's column terminated
in a lance head, and the head of a lion crowned that of Nergal. These columns were probably connected with
pillar worship, and therefore with tree worship, the pillar
being the trunk of the " world tree ". The symbol of the sun god Shamash was a disc, from which flowed
streams of water ; his rays apparently were " fertilizing tears ", like the rays of the Egyptian sun god Ra. Horus,
the Egyptian falcon god, was symbolized as the winged
solar disc.
It is necessary to accumulate these details regarding
other deities and their symbols before dealing with Ashur. The symbols of Ashur must be studied, because
they are one of the sources of our knowledge regarding
the god's origin and character. These include (i) a
winged disc with horns, enclosing four circles revolving
round a middle circle; rippling rays fall down from either

side of the disc ; (2) a circle or wheel, suspended from
wings, and enclosing a warrior drawing his bow to dis
charge an arrow; and (3) the same circle; the warrior's
bow, however, is carried in his left hand, while the right
hand is uplifted as if to bless his worshippers. These
symbols are taken from seal cylinders.
An Assyrian standard, which probably represented the
" world column ", has the disc mounted on a bull's head
with horns. The upper part of the disc is occupied by
a warrior, whose head, part of his bow, and the point of his arrow protrude from the circle. The rippling
water rays are V-shaped, and two bulls, treading riverlike rays, occupy the divisions thus formed. There are
also two heads a lion's and a man's with gaping
mouths, which may symbolize tempests, the destroying power of the sun, or the sources of the Tigris and
Euphrates. Jastrow regards the winged disc as "the purer and
more genuine symbol of Ashur as a solar deity ". He
calls it " a sun disc with protruding rays ", and says :
"To this symbol the warrior with the bow and arrow
was added a despiritualization that reflects the martial
spirit of the Assyrian empire 'V
The sun symbol on the sun boat of Ra encloses
similarly a human figure, which was apparently regarded as the soul of the sun: the life of the god was in the
"sun egg". In an Indian prose treatise it is set forth:
" Now that man in yonder orb (the sun) and that man
in the right eye truly are no other than Death (the soul).
His feet have stuck fast in the heart, and having pulled them out he comes forth; and when he comes forth then
that man dies; whence they say of him who has passed
1 Aspects of Religious Belief and Practice in Babylonia and Assyria, p. 120, plate 18 and note.



336 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
away, c he has been cut off (his life or life string has been
severed) V 1 The human figure did not indicate a process
of " despiritualization
" either in Egypt or in India. The
Horus "winged disc" was besides a symbol of destruc
tion and battle, as well as of light and fertility. Horus
assumed that form in one legend to destroy Set and his
followers. 2 But, of course, the same symbols may not
have conveyed the same ideas to all peoples. As Blake
put it:
What to others a trifle appears
Fills me full of smiles and tears. . . . With my inward Eye, *t is an old Man grey,
With my outward, a Thistle across my way.
Indeed, it is possible that the winged disc meant one thing
to an Assyrian priest, and another thing to a man not
gifted with what Blake called a double vision ".
What seems certain, however, is that the archer was
as truly solar as the "wings" or "rays". In Babylonia and Assyria Hie sun was, among other things, a destroyer from the earliest times. It is not surprising, therefore,
to find that Ashur, like Merodach, resembled, in one of
his phases, Hercules, or rather his prototype Gilgamesh.
One of Gilgamesh's mythical feats was the slaying of three demon birds. These may be identical with the
birds of prey which Hercules, in performing his sixth labour, hunted out of Stymphalus.3 In the Greek
Hipparcho-Ptolemy star list Hercules was the constella
tion of the " Kneeler ", and in Babylonian -Assyrian
astronomy he was (as Gilgamesh or Merodach) " Sarru ",
" the king

was pointed against the constellations of the " Eagle ",
" Vulture ", and " Swan ". In Phoenician astronomy the Vulture was "Zither*' (Lyra), a weapon with which Her
cules (identified with Melkarth) slew Linos, the musician. Hercules used a solar arrow, which he received from
Apollo. In various mythologies the arrow is associated
with the sun, the moon, and the atmospheric deities, and
is a symbol of lightning, rain, and fertility, as well as of
famine, disease, war, and death. The green-faced goddess Neith of Libya, compared by the Greeks to Minerva,
carries in one hand two arrows and a bow.1 If we knew as little of Athena (Minerva), who was armed with a
lance, a breastplate made of the skin of a goat, a shield, and helmet, as we do of Ashur, it might be held that she
was simply a goddess of war. The archer in the sun disc
of the Assyrian standard probably represented Ashur as the god of the people a deity closely akin to Merodach,
with pronounced Tammuz traits, and therefore linking with other local deities like Ninip, Nergal, and Shamash,
and partaking also like these of the attributes of the elder
gods Anu, Bel Enlil, and Ea. All the other deities worshipped by the Assyrians
were of Babylonian origin. Ashur appears to have differed from them just as one local Babylonian deity differed
from another. He reflected Assyrian experiences and
aspirations, but it is difficult to decide whether the
sublime spiritual aspect of his character was due to the
beliefs of alien peoples, by whom the early Assyrians were
influenced, or to the teachings of advanced Babylonian thinkers, whose doctrines found readier acceptance in a
"new country*' than among the conservative ritualists
1 The so-called "shuttle" of Neith may be a thunderbolt. Scotland's archaic thunder
deity is a goddess. The bow and arrows suggest a lightning goddess who wae a deity of war because she was a deity of fertility.



338 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
of ancient Sumerian and Akkadian cities. New cults were formed from time to time in Babylonia, and when
they achieved political power they gave a distinctive character to the religion of their city states. Others which did
not find political support and remained in obscurity at home, may have yet extended their influence far and
wide. Buddhism, for instance, originated in India, but
now flourishes in other countries, to which it was introduced by missionaries. In the homeland it was sub
merged by the revival of Brahmanism, from which it
sprung, and which it was intended permanently to dis
place. An instance of an advanced cult suddenly achieving prominence as a result of political influence is afforded by
Egypt, where the fully developed Aton religion was embraced and established as a national religion by Akhenaton,
the so-called " dreamer ". That migrations were some
times propelled by cults, which sought new areas in which
to exercise religious freedom and propagate their beliefs, is suggested by the invasion of India at the close of
the Vedic period by the " later comers ", who laid the foundations of Brahmanism. They established them
selves in Madhyadesa, "the Middle Country", "the land where the Brahmanas and the later Samhitas were
produced ". From this centre went forth missionaries,
who accomplished the Brahmanization of the rest of

It may be, therefore, that the cult of Ashur was in
fluenced in its development by the doctrines of advanced
teachers from Babylonia, and that Persian Mithraism was
also the product of missionary efforts extended from that
great and ancient cultural area. Mitra, as has been stated, was one of the names of the Babylonian sun god, who was also a god of fertility. But Ashur could not have been to

begin with merely a battle and solar deity. As the god of
a city state he must have been worshipped by agriculturists, artisans, and traders ; he must have been recognized as a
deity of fertility, culture, commerce, and law. Even as a national god he must have made wider appeal than to the
cultured and ruling classes. Bel Enlil of Nippur was a
" world god " and war god, but still remained a local corn
god. Assyria's greatness was reflected by Ashur, but he also
reflected the origin and growth of that greatness. The
civilization of which he was a product had an agricultural
basis. It began with the development of the natural
resources of Assyria, as was recognized by the Hebrew
prophet, who said: "Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches. . . . The waters made him
great, the deep set him up on high with her rivers running
round about his plants, and sent out her little rivers unto
all the trees of the field. Therefore his height was exalted
above all the trees of the field, and his boughs were multiplied, and his branches became long because of the multitude of waters when he shot forth. All the fowls of
heaven made their nests in his boughs, and under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their
young, and under his shadow dwelt all great nations.
Thus was he fair in his greatness, in the length of his
branches ; for his root was by great waters. The cedars
in the garden of God could not hide him: the fir trees
were not like his boughs, and the chestnut trees were not
like his branches ; nor any tree in the garden of God was
like unto him in his beauty/' 1
Asshur, the ancient capital, was famous for its mer
chants. It is referred to in the Bible as one of the cities
which traded with Tyre " in all sorts of things, in blue
1 Exckiel, xxxi, 3-8.



340 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
clothes, and broidered work, and in chests of rich apparel, bound with cords, and made of cedar".1
As a military power, Assyria's name was dreaded.
" Behold," Isaiah said, addressing King Hezekiah, " thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all
lands by destroying them utterly."
2 The same prophet,
when foretelling how Israel would suffer, exclaimed: "O
Assyrian, the rod of mine anger, and the staff in their
hand is mine indignation. I will send him against an
hypocritical nation, and against the people of my wrath
will I give him a charge, to take the spoil, and to take
the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the
streets." 3
We expect to find Ashur reflected in these three phases
of Assyrian civilization. If we recognize him in the first
place as a god of fertility, his other attributes are at once
included. A god of fertility is a corn god and a water
god. The river as a river was a "creator" (p. 29), and
Ashur was therefore closely associated with the " watery
place", with the canals or "rivers running round about
his plants". The rippling water-rays, or fertilizing tears, appear on the solar discs. As a corn god, he was a god
of war. Tammuz's first act was to slay the demons of
winter and storm, as Indra's in India was to slay the demons of drought, and Thor's in Scandinavia was to
exterminate the frost giants. The corn god had to be
fed with human sacrifices, and the people therefore waged
war against foreigners to obtain victims. As the god
made a contract with his people, he was a deity of commerce ; he provided them with food and they in turn fed
him with offerings.
In Ezekiel's comparison of Assyria to a mighty tree,
there is no doubt a mythological reference. The Hebrew

prophets invariably utilized for their poetic imagery the
characteristic beliefs of the peoples to whom they made
direct reference. The "owls", " satyrs ", and " dragons
"
of Babylon, mentioned by Isaiah, were taken from Baby
lonian mythology, as has been indicated. When, there
fore, Assyria is compared to a cedar, which is greater than fir or chestnut, and it is stated that there are nesting birds
in the branches, and under them reproducing beasts of the
field, and that the greatness of the tree is due to " the multitude of waters ", the conclusion is suggested that
Assyrian religion, which Ashur's symbols reflect, included
the worship of trees, birds, beasts, and water. The symbol of the Assyrian tree probably the "world tree"
of its religion appears to be " the rod of mine anger . . .
the staff in their hand"; that is, the battle standard which
was a symbol of Ashur. Tammuz and Osiris were tree
gods as well as corn gods.
Now, as Ashur was evidently a complex deity, it is futile to attempt to read his symbols without giving con
sideration to the remnants of Assyrian mythology which
are found in the ruins of the ancient cities. These either
reflect the attributes of Ashur, or constitute the material from which he evolved.
As Layard pointed out many years ago, the Assyrians had a sacred tree which became conventionalized. It was
"an elegant device, in which curved branches, springing from a kind of scroll work, terminated in flowers of
graceful form. As one of the figures last described 1 was
turned, as if in act of adoration, towards this device, it
was evidently a sacred emblem ; and I recognized in it
the holy tree, or tree of life, so universally adored at the remotest period in the East, and which was preserved in
the religious systems of the Persians to the final over

342 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
throw of their Empire. . . . The flowers were formed by
seven petals/'
1
This tree looks like a pillar, and is thrice crossed by
conventionalized bull's horns tipped with ring symbols
which may be stars, the highest pair of horns having a
larger ring between them, but only partly shown as if it
were a crescent. The tree with its many <c sevenfold "
designs may have been a symbol of the " Sevenfold-one
are-ye
"
deity. This is evidently the Assyrian tree which
was called "the rod " or " staff".
What mythical animals did this tree shelter ? Layard
found that " the four creatures continually introduced on
the sculptured walls ", were " a man, a lion, an ox, and an
eagle". 2
In Sumeria the gods were given human form, but before this stage was reached the bull symbolized Nannar
(Sin), the moon god, Ninip (Saturn, the old sun), and
Enlil, while Nergal was a lion, as a tribal sun god. The
eagle is represented by the Zu bird, which symbolized the storm and a phase of the sun, and was also a deity of
fertility. On the silver vase of Lagash the lion and eagle were combined as the lion-headed eagle, a form of Nin
Girsu (Tammuz), and it was associated with wild goats,
stags, lions, and bulls. On a mace head dedicated to
Nin-Girsu, a lion slays a bull as the Zu bird slays serpents in the folk tale, suggesting the wars of totemic deities,
according to one "school", and the battle of the sun with
the storm clouds according to another. Whatever the
explanation may be of one animal deity of fertility slaying another, it seems certain that the conflict was associated
with the idea of sacrifice to procure the food supply.
In Assyria the various primitive gods were combined
as a winged bull, a winged bull with human head (the

THE NATIONAL GOD OF ASSYRIA 343
king's), a winged lion with human head, a winged man,
a deity with lion's head, human body, and eagle's legs with claws, and also as a deity with eagle's head and
feather headdress, a human body, wings, and feather-fringed robe, carrying in one hand ? metal basket on which two
winged men adored the holy tree, and in the other a fir
cone. 1
Layard suggested that the latter deity, with eagle's
head, was Nisroch, "the word Nisr signifying, in all Semitic languages, an eagle". 2 This deity is referred to
in the Bible : " Sennacherib, king of Assyria, . . . was
worshipping in the house of Nisroch, his god".3 Professor
Pinches is certain that Nisroch is Ashur, but considers
that the " ni " was attached to "Ashur" (Ashuraku or
Ashurachu), as it was to " Marad " (Merodach) to give
the reading Ni-Marad == Nimrod. The names of heathen
deities were thus made " unrecognizable, and in all probability ridiculous as well. . . . Pious and orthodox lips
could pronounce them without fear of defilement."* At
the same time the " Nisr "
theory is probable : it may
represent another phase of this process. The names of heathen gods were not all treated in like manner by the
Hebrew teachers. Abcd-nebo, for instance, became Abednego (Daniel, i, 7), as Professor Pinches shows.
Seeing that the eagle received prominence in the mythologies of Sumeria and Assyria, as a deity of fertility
with solar and atmospheric attributes, it is highly probable that the Ashur symbol, like the Egyptian Horus solar disk,
is a winged symbol of life, fertility, and destruction. The
idea that it represents the sun in eclipse, with protruding
J The fir cone was offered to Attis and Mithra. It* association with Ashur suggests that the great Assyrian deity resembled the gods of corn and trees and fertility.

344 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
rays, seems rather far-fetched, because eclipses were disasters and indications of divine wrath; 1 it certainly does
not explain why the "rays" should only stretch out side
ways, like wings, and downward like a tail, why the "rays"
should be double, like the double wings of cherubs, bulls, &c., and divided into sections suggesting feathers, or why the disk is surmounted by conventionalized horns, tipped
with star-like ring symbols, identical with those depicted in
the holy tree. What particular connection the five small rings within the disk were supposed to have with the
eclipse of the sun is difficult to discover.
In one of the other symbols in which appears a feather
robed archer, it is significant to find that the arrow he is
about to discharge has a head shaped like a trident ; it is
evidently a lightning symbol.
When Ezekiel prophesied to the Israelitish captives at
Tel-abib, " by the river of Chebar " in Chaldea (Kheber,
near Nippur), he appears to have utilized Assyrian symbolism. Probably he came into contact in Babylonia with
fugitive priests from Assyrian cities.
This great prophet makes interesting references to
" four living creatures ", with " four faces " the face of
a man, the face of a lion, the face of an ox, and the face of an eagle; "they had the hands of a man under their
wings, . . . their wings were joined one to another; . . . their wings were stretched upward: two wings of every
one were joined one to another. . . . Their appearance
was like burning coals of fire and like the appearance of
lamps. . . . The living creatures ran and returned as
the appearance of a flash of lightning."

life, Ezekiel tells that when Aholibah "doted upon the
Assyrians
" she " saw men pourtrayed upon the wall, the
images of the Chaldeans pourtrayed with vermilion, girded with girdles upon their loins ".* Traces of the red colour
on the walls of Assyrian temples and palaces have been
observed by excavators. The winged gods " like burning
coals " were probably painted in vermilion. Ezekiel makes reference to "ring*' and "wheel"
symbols. In his vision he saw "one wheel upon the
earth by the living creatures, with his four faces. The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the colour of beryl ; and they four had one likeness ; and
their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel. ... As for their rings, they were
so high that they were dreadful ; and their rings were full
of eyes round about them four. And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them ; and when the
living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels
were lifted up. Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they
went, thither was their spirit to go; and the wheels were
lifted up over against them ; for the spirit of the living
creature was in the wheels? . . . And the likeness of the
firmament upon the heads of the living creature was as the
colour of terrible crystal, stretched forth over their heads
above. . . . And when they went I heard the noise of
their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of
the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the noise of an host;
when they stood they let down their wings. . . ." 8 Another description of the cherubs states: "Their
whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their
wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes (? stars) round

about, even the wheels that they four had. As for the
wheels, it was cried unto them in my hearing, O wheel !
"
or, according to a marginal rendering, "they were called
in my hearing, wheel, or Gilgal," i.e. move round. . . .
" And the cherubims were lifted up." l
It would appear that the wheel (or hoop, a variant
rendering) was a symbol of life, and that the Assyrian feather-robed figure which it enclosed was a god, not of
war only, but also of fertility. His trident-headed arrow
resembles, as has been suggested, a lightning symbol. Ezekiel's references are suggestive in this connection.
When the cherubs " ran and returned "
they had " the
appearance of a flash of lightning*', and "the noise of their
wings " resembled " the noise of great waters ". Their
bodies were "like burning coals of fire ". Fertility gods
were associated with fire, lightning, and water. Agni of India, Sandan of Asia Minor, and Melkarth of Phoenicia
were highly developed fire gods of fertility. The fire
cult was also represented in Sumeria (pp. 49-51). In the Indian epic, the Mahdbhdrata, the revolving ring
or wheel protects the Soma 2 (ambrosia) of the gods, on
which their existence depends. The eagle giant Garuda
sets forth to steal it. The gods, fully armed, gather
round to protect the life-giving drink. Garuda approaches "darkening the worlds by the dust raised by the hurricane
of his wings ". The celestials, " overwhelmed by that dust", swoon away. Garuda afterwards assumes a fiery
shape, then looks " like masses of black clouds ", and in
the end its body becomes golden and bright " as the rays
of the sun ". The Soma is protected by fire, which the
bird quenches after " drinking in many rivers " with the
numerous mouths it has assumed. Then Garuda finds that right above the Soma is "a wheel of steel, keen
* Evtkiel, x, 11-5. 8 Also called " Amrit* ".



THE NATIONAL GOD OF ASSYRIA 347
edged, and sharp as a razor, revolving incessantly. That fierce instrument, of the lustre of the blazing sun and
of terrible form, was devised by the gods for cutting to pieces all robbers of the Soma." Garuda passes "through the spokes of the wheel ", and has then to contend against
" two great snakes of the lustre of blazing fire, of tongues
bright as the lightning flash, of great energy, of mouth
emitting fire, of blazing eyes". He slays the snakes. . . .
The gods afterwards recover the stolen Soma.
Garuda becomes the vehicle of the god Vishnu, who carries the discus, another fiery wheel which revolves and
returns to the thrower like lightning. "And he (Vishnu)
made the bird sit on the flagstaff of his car, saying: 'Even
thus thou shalt stay above me Y' 1
The Persian god Ahura Mazda hovers above the
king in sculptured representations of that high dignitary, enclosed in a winged wheel, or disk, like Ashur, grasping a ring in one hand, the other being lifted up as if blessing
those who adore him.
Shamash, the Babylonian sun god; Ishtar, the goddess of heaven; and other Babylonian deities carried rings as
the Egyptian gods carried the ankh, the symbol of life. Shamash was also depicted sitting on his throne in a
pillar-supported pavilion, in front of which is a sun wheel.
The spokes of the wheel are formed by a star symbol and threefold rippling "water rays".
In Hittite inscriptions there are interesting winged
emblems; "the central portion" of one "seems to be
composed of two crescents underneath a disk (which is also divided like a crescent). Above the emblem there
appear the symbol of sanctity (the divided oval) and the
hieroglyph which Professor Sayce interprets as the name
of the god Sandes." In another instance " the centre of

the winged emblem may be seen to be a rosette, with a
curious spreading object below. Above, two dots follow the name of Sandes, and a human arm bent c in adoration'
is by the side. . . ." Professor Garstang is here dealing
with sacred places "on rocky points or hilltops, bearing out the suggestion of the sculptures near Boghaz-Keui1
,
in which there may be reasonably suspected the surviving traces of mountain cults, or cults of mountain deities,
underlying thd*" newer religious symbolism ". Who the
deity is it is impossible to say, but " he was identified at
some time or other with Sandes". 2 It would appear, too,
that the god may have been " called by a name which was
that used also by the priest ". Perhaps the priest king was believed to be an incarnation of the deity. Sandes or Sandan was identical with Sandon of Tarsus,
"the prototype of Attis",8 who links with the Babylonian
Tammuz. Sandon's animal symbol was the lion, and he
carried the " double axe " symbol of the god of fertility
and thunder. As Professor Frazer has shown in The
Golden Bough, he links with Hercules and Melkarth.4
All the younger gods, who displaced the elder gods as
one year displaces another, were deities of fertility, battle,
lightning, fire, and the sun; it is possible, therefore, that Ashur was like Merodach, son of Ea, god of the deep, a
form of Tammuz in origin. His spirit was in the solar wheel which revolved at times of seasonal change. In
Scotland it was believed that on the morning of May
Day (Beltaine) the rising sun revolved three times. The
younger god was a spring sun god and fire god. Great

bonfires were lit to strengthen him, or as a ceremony of riddance; the old year was burned out. Indeed the god himself might be burned (that is, the old god), so that he might renew his youth. Melkarth was burned at Tyre. Hercules burned himself on a mountain top, and his soul ascended to heaven as an eagle.
These fiery rites were evidently not unknown in
Babylonia and Assyria. When, according to Biblical
narrative, Nebuchadnezzar "made an image of gold"
which he set up u in the plain of Dura, in the province
of Babylon ", he commanded: "O people, nations, and
languages ... at the time ye hear the sound of the
cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of musick . . . fall down and worship the golden
image". Certain Jews who had been "set over the
affairs of the province of Babylonia", namely, " Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego", refused to adore the idol.
They were punished by being thrown into " a burning fiery furnace", which was heated "seven times more than
it was wont to be heated". They came forth uninjured.
1
In the Koran it is related that Abraham destroyed the
images of Chaldean gods; he "brake them all in pieces
except the biggest of them; that they might lay the blame on that".2 According to the commentators the Chaldaeans
were at the time " abroad in the fields, celebrating a great
festival ". To punish the offender Nimrod had a great
pyre erected at Cuthah. " Then they bound Abraham, and putting him into an engine, shot him into the midst
of the fire, from which he was preserved by the angel
Gabriel, who was sent to his assistance." Eastern Chris
tians were wont to set apart in the Syrian calendar the

25th of January to commemorate Abraham's escape from NimrocPs pyre.

It is evident that the Babylonian fire ceremony was
observed in the spring season, and that human beings
were sacrificed to the sun god. A mock king may have
been burned to perpetuate the ancient sacrifice of real
kings, who were incarnations of the god.
Isaiah makes reference to the sacrificial burning of
kings in Assyria : " For through the voice of the Lord shall the Assyrian be beaten down, which smote with a
rod. And in every place where the grounded staff shall
pass, which the Lord shall lay upon him, it shall be with
tabrets and harps: and in battles of shaking will he fight
with it. For Tophet is ordained of old ; yea, for the
king it is prepared: he hath made it deep and large: the
pile thereof is fire and much wood : the breath of the
Lord, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it." 2 When
Nineveh was about to fall, and with it the Assyrian Empire,
the legendary king, Sardanapalus, who was reputed to have founded Tarsus, burned himself, with his wives, con
cubines, and eunuchs, on a pyre in his palace. Zimri,
who reigned over Israel for seven days, "burnt the king's house over him with fire" 3
. Saul, another fallen king, was burned after death, and his bones were buried "under
the oak in Jabesh". 4 In Europe the oak was associated
with gods of fertility and lightning, including Jupiter and
Thor. The ceremony of burning Saul is of special interest. Asa, the orthodox king of Judah, was, after death, "laid in the bed which was filled with sweet odours and
divers kinds of spices prepared by the apothecaries' art:
and they made a very great burning for him" (2 Chronicles^
1 The Koran, George Sale, pp. 245- 6. 2 Isaiah, xxx, 31-3. See also for Tophet customs 2 Kings, xxiii, 10; Jeremiah, vii, 31, 32 and xix, 5-12. 8 / Kings, xvi, 18. 4 7 Samuel, xxxi, 12, 13 and / Chronicles, x, n, 12.



THE NATIONAL GOD OF ASSYRIA 351
xvi, 14). Jehoram, the heretic king of Judah, who "walked in the way of the kings of Israel", died of "an
incurable disease. And his people made no burning for
him, like the burning of his fathers "
(2 Chronicles^ xxi,
1 8, 19).
The conclusion suggested by the comparative study of the beliefs of neighbouring peoples, and the evidence
afforded by Assyrian sculptures, is that Ashur was a
highly developed form of the god of fertility, who was sustained, or aided in his conflicts with demons, by the
fires and sacrifices of his worshippers.
It is possible to read too much into his symbols.
These are not more complicated and vague than are the symbols on the standing stones of Scotland the crescent
with the " broken " arrow ; the trident with the double
rings, or wheels, connected by two crescents; the circle with the dot in its centre; the triangle with the dot; the
large disk with two small rings on either side crossed by
double straight lines; the so-called "mirror", and so on.
Highly developed symbolism may not indicate a process
of spiritualization so much, perhaps, as the persistence of magical beliefs and practices. There is really no direct
evidence to support the theory that the Assyrian winged disk, or disk "with protruding rays", was of more spiritual character than the wheel which encloses the feather
robed archer with his trident-shaped arrow.
The various symbols may have represented phases of
the god. When the spring fires were lit, and the god
"renewed his life like the eagle", his symbol was possibly the solar wheel or disk with eagle's wings, which became
regarded as a symbol of life. The god brought life and light to the world; he caused the crops to grow; he gave increase; he sustained his worshippers. But he was also
the god who slew the demons of darkness and storm.



352 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
The Hittite winged disk was Sandes or Sandon, the god
of lightning, who stood on the back of a bull. As the
lightning god was a war god, it was in keeping with his
character to find him represented in Assyria as "Ashur
the archer'' with the bow and lightning arrow. On the
disk of the Assyrian standard the lion and the bull appear
with "the archer " as symbols of the war god Ashur, but
they were also symbols of Ashur the god of fertility.
The life or spirit of the god was in the ring or wheel, as the life of the Egyptian and Indian gods, and of the
giants of folk tales, was in "the egg". The "dot within
the circle ", a widespread symbol, may have represented the seed within "the egg" of more than one mythology, or the thorn within the egg of more than one legendary
story. It may be that in Assyria, as in India, the crude beliefs and symbols of the masses were spiritualized by
the speculative thinkers in the priesthood, but no literary evidence has survived to justify us in placing the Assyrian
teachers on the same level as the Brahmans who com
posed the Upanishads. Temples were erected to Ashur, but he might be
worshipped anywhere, like the Queen of Heaven, who
received offerings in the streets of Jerusalem, for " he needed no temple", as Professor Pinches says. Whether
this was because he was a highly developed deity or a
product of folk religion it is difficult to decide. One
important fact is that the ruling king of Assyria was more closely connected with the worship of Ashur than the
king of Babylonia was with the worship of Merodach.
This may be because the Assyrian king was regarded as
an incarnation of his god, like the Egyptian Pharaoh.
Ashur accompanied the monarch on his campaigns: he
was their conquering war god. Where the king was,
there was Ashur also. No images were made of him,



THE NATIONAL GOD OF ASSYRIA 353
but his symbols were carried aloft, as were the symbols of Indian gods in the great war of the Mahdbhdrata
epic. It would appear that Ashur was sometimes worshipped
in the temples of other gods. In an interesting inscription
he is associated with the moon god Nannar (Sin) of Haran.
Esarhaddon, the Assyrian king, is believed to have been
crowned in that city. "The writer", says Professor
Pinches, "is apparently addressing Assur-bani-apli,
c the
great and noble Asnapper':
" When the father of my king my lord went to Egypt, he was
crowned (?) in the gannl of Harran, the temple (lit.
' Bethel ') of
cedar. The god Sin remained over the (sacred) standard, two crowns upon his head, (and) the god Nusku stood beside him.
The father of the king my lord entered, (and) he (the priest of
Sin) placed (the crown?) upon his head, (saying) thus: 'Thou shalt go and capture the lands in the midst'. (He we)nt, he captured
the land of Egypt. The rest of the lands not submitting (?) to
Assur (Ashur) and Sin, the king, the lord of kings, shall capture
(them)." 1
Ashur and Sin are here linked as equals. Associated
with them is Nusku, the messenger of the gods, who was
given prominence in Assyria. The kings frequently in
voked him. As the son of Ea he acted as the messenger
between Merodach and the god of the deep. He was
also a son of Bel Enlil, and like Anu was guardian or chief of the Igigi, the "host of heaven". Professor
Pinches suggests that he may have been either identical
with the Sumerian fire god Gibil, or a brother of the fire
god, and an impersonation of the light of fire and sun. In
Haran he accompanied the moon god, and may, therefore,
have symbolized the light of the moon also. Professor

Babylonia, pp. 201-2.



354 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
Pinches adds that in one inscription "he is identified
with Nirig or En-reshtu " (Nin-Girsu = Tammuz).1 The
Babylonians and Assyrians associated fire and light with moisture and fertility.
The astral phase of the character of Ashur is highly
probable. As has been indicated, the Greek rendering of Anshar as "Assoros", is suggestive in this connection.
Jastrow, however, points out that the use of the characters
Anshar for Ashur did not obtain until the eighth century
B.C. " Linguistically ", he says, " the change of Ashir to Ashur can be accounted for, but not the transformation of An-shar to Ashur or Ashir; so that we must assume the
' etymology
' of Ashur, proposed by some learned scribe,
to be the nature of a play upon the name." 2 On the
other hand, it is possible that what appears arbitrary to us
may have been justified in ancient Assyria on perfectly reasonable, or at any rate traditional, grounds. Professor Pinches points out that as a sun god, and "at the same time not Shamash ", Ashur resembled Merodach. "His
identification with Merodach, if that was ever accepted,
may have been due to the likeness of the word to Asari,
one of the deities1 names." 3 As Asari, Merodach has been
compared to the Egyptian Osiris, who, as the Nile god,
was Asar-Hapi. Osiris resembles Tammuz and was similarly a corn deity and a ruler of the living and the
dead, associated with sun, moon, stars, water, and vegeta
tion. We may consistently connect Ashur with Aushar,
"water field", Anshar, "god of the height", or "most
high ", and with the eponymous King Asshur who went
out on the land of Nimrod and " builded Nineveh ", if
we regard him as of common origin with Tammuz, Osiris,

and Attis a developed and localized form of the ancient
deity of fertility and corn. Ashur had a spouse who is referred to as Ashuritu, or
Beltu, cc the lady ". Her name, however, is not given, but it is possible that she was identified with the Ishtar of
Nineveh. In the historical texts Ashur, as the royal god,
stands alone. Like the Hittite Great Father, he was per
haps regarded as the origin of life. Indeed, it may have been due to the influence of the northern hillmen in the
early Assyrian period, that Ashur was developed as a father
god a Baal. When the Hittite inscriptions are read,
more light may be thrown on the Ashur problem. An
other possible source of cultural influence is Persia. The
supreme god Ahura-Mazda (Ormuzd) was, as has been in
dicated, represented, like Ashur, hovering over the king's head, enclosed in a winged disk or wheel, and the sacred
tree figured in Persian mythology. The early Assyrian kings had non-Semitic and non-Sumerian names. It seems
reasonable to assume that the religious culture of the
ethnic elements they represented must have contributed
to the development of the city god of Asshur.

IT is possible that during the present century Babylonia may once again become one of the great wheat
producing countries of the world. A scheme of land reclamation has already been inaugurated by the construc
tion of a great dam to control the distribution of the
waters of the Euphrates, and, if it is energetically promoted on a generous scale in the years to come, the ancient canals, which are used at present as caravan roads,
may yet be utilized to make the whole country as fertile
and prosperous as it was in ancient days. When that
happy consummation is reached, new cities may grow up and flourish beside the ruins of the old centres of Baby
lonian culture.
With the revival of agriculture will come the revival of commerce. Ancient trade routes will then be re
opened, and the slow-travelling caravans supplanted by

speedy trains. A beginning has already been made in
this direction. The first modern commercial highway
which is crossing the threshold of Babylonia's new Age
is the German railway through Asia Minor, North Syria,
and Mesopotamia to Baghdad.1 It brings the land of
Hammurabi into close touch with Europe, and will solve
problems which engaged the attention of many rival
monarchs for long centuries before the world knew aught
of " the glory that was Greece and the grandeur that was
Rome".
These sudden and dramatic changes are causing history
to repeat itself. Once again the great World Powers are
evincing much concern regarding their respective "spheres of influence" in Western Asia, and pressing together
around the ancient land of Babylon. On the east, where
the aggressive Elamites and Kassites were followed by the
triumphant Persians and Medes, Russia and Britain have
asserted themselves as protectors of Persian territory, and the influence of Britain is supreme in the Persian Gulf.
Turkey controls the land of the Hittites, while Russia
looms like a giant across the Armenian highlands ;
Turkey is also the governing power in Syria and Mesopotamia, which are being crossed by Germany's Baghdad
railway. France is constructing railways in Syria, and will control the ancient "way of the Philistines". Britain
occupies Cyprus on the Mediterranean coast, and presides over the destinies of the ancient land of Egypt, which,
during the brilliant Eighteenth Dynasty, extended its sphere of influence to the borders of Asia Minor. Once
again, after the lapse of many centuries, international

358 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
politics is being strongly influenced by the problems connected with the development of trade in Babylonia and
its vicinity. The history of the ancient rival States, which is
being pieced together by modern excavators, is, in view of
present-day political developments, invested with special
interest to us. We have seen Assyria rising into prominence. It began to be a great Power when Egypt was
supreme in the "Western Land" (the land of the Amor
ites) as far north as the frontiers of Cappadocia. Under
the Kassite regime Babylonia's political influence had declined in Mesopotamia, but its cultural influence remained,
for its language and script continued in use among traders
and diplomatists. At the beginning of the Pharaoh Akhenaton period,
the supreme power in Mesopotamia was Mitanni. As the ally of Egypt it constituted a buffer state on the
borders of North Syria, which prevented the southern
expansion from Asia Minor of the Hittite confederacy
and the western expansion of aggressive Assyria, while it also held in check the ambitions of Babylonia, which still claimed the "land of the Amorites". So long as Mitanni
was maintained as a powerful kingdom the Syrian possessions of Egypt were easily held in control, and the Egyp
tian merchants enjoyed preferential treatment compared with those of Babylonia. But when Mitanni was over
come, and its territories were divided between the Assy
rians and the Hittites, the North Syrian Empire of Egypt
went to pieces. A great struggle then ensued between
the nations of western Asia for political supremacy in the "land of the Amorites".
Babylonia had been seriously handicapped by losing control of its western caravan road. Prior to the Kassite
period its influence was supreme in Mesopotamia and



CONFLICTS FOR TRADE 359
middle Syria; from the days of Sargon of Akkad and of
Naram-Sin until the close of the Hammurabi Age its merchants had naught to fear from bandits or petty kings between the banks of the Euphrates and the Mediter
ranean coast. The city of Babylon had grown rich and
powerful as the commercial metropolis of Western Asia.
Separated from the Delta frontier by the broad and
perilous wastes of the Arabian desert, Babylonia traded with Egypt by an indirect route. Its caravan road ran northward along the west bank of the Euphrates towards Haran, and then southward through Palestine. This was
a long detour, but it was the only possible way. During the early Kassite Age the caravans from
Babylon had to pass through the area controlled by Mitanni, which was therefore able to impose heavy duties
and fill its coffers with Babylonian gold. Nor did the
situation improve when the influence of Mitanni suffered
decline in southern Mesopotamia. Indeed the difficulties
under which traders operated were then still further
increased, for the caravan roads were infested by plunder
ing bands of " Suti ", to whom references are made in the
Tell-el-Amarna letters. These bandits defied all the great
powers, and became so powerful that even the messengers sent from one king to another were liable to be robbed
and murdered without discrimination. When war broke
out between powerful States they harried live stock and sacked towns in those areas which were left unprotected.
The "Suti" were Arabians of Aramaean stock. What
is known as the " Third Semitic Migration " was in pro
gress during this period. The nomads gave trouble to
Babylonia and Assyria, and, penetrating Mesopotamia and Syria, sapped the power of Mitanni, until it was unable to resist the onslaughts of the Assyrians and the Hittites.
The Aramaean tribes are referred to, at various periods



360 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
and by various peoples, not only as the "Suti", but also as the "Achlame", the "Arimi", and the "Khabiri".
Ultimately they were designated simply as "Syrians",
and under that name became the hereditary enemies of
the Hebrews, although Jacob was regarded as being of
their stock: "A Syrian ready to perish ", runs a Biblical
reference, " was my father (ancestor), and he went down
into Egypt and sojourned there with a few, and became
there a nation, great, mighty, and populous
1
'. 1
An heroic attempt was made by one of the Kassite
kings of Babylonia to afford protection to traders by stamping out brigandage between Arabia and Mesopo
tamia, and opening up a new and direct caravan road to
Egypt across the Arabian desert. The monarch in ques
tion was Kadashman-Kharbe, the grandson of Ashur
uballit of Assyria. As we have seen, he combined forces
with his distinguished and powerful kinsman, and laid a
heavy hand on the " Suti ". Then he dug wells and
erected a chain of fortifications, like " block-houses ", so
that caravans might come and go without interruption, and merchants be freed from the imposts of petty kings
whose territory they had to penetrate when travelling by
the Haran route. This bold scheme, however, was foredoomed to
failure. It was shown scant favour by the Babylonian
Kassites. No record survives to indicate the character of the agreement between Kadashman-Kharbe and Ashuruballit, but there can be little doubt that it involved the
abandonment by Babylonia of its historic claim upon
Mesopotamia, or part of it, and the recognition of an Assyrian sphere of influence in that region. It was probably on account of his pronounced pro-Assyrian tendencies that the Kassites murdered Kadashman-Kharbe,
1
Deuteronomy^ xxvi, 5,



CONFLICTS FOR TRADE 361
and set the pretender, known as " the son of nobody", on the throne for a brief period. Kadashman-Kharbe's immediate successors recognized
in Assyria a dangerous and unscrupulous rival, and resumed the struggle for the possession of Mesopotamia.
The trade route across the Arabian desert had to be
abandoned. Probably it required too great a force to
keep it open. Then almost every fresh conquest achieved
by Assyria involved it in war with Babylonia, which
appears to have been ever waiting for a suitable oppor
tunity to cripple its northern rival.
But Assyria was not the only power which Babylonia
had to guard itself against. On its eastern frontier Elam
was also panting for expansion. Its chief caravan roads ran from Susa through Assyria towards Asia Minor, and
through Babylonia towards the Phoenician coast. It was
probably because its commerce was hampered by the
growth of Assyrian power in the north, as Servians com
merce in our own day has been hampered by Austria, that
it cherished dreams of conquering Babylonia. In fact, as Kassite influence suffered decline, one of the great prob
lems of international politics was whether Elam or Assyria
would enter into possession of the ancient lands of Sumer and Akkad.
Ashur-uballit's vigorous policy of Assyrian expansion was continued, as has been shown, by his son Bel-nirari.
His grandson, Arik-den-ilu, conducted several successful
campaigns, and penetrated westward as far as Haran, thus
crossing the Babylonian caravan road. He captured great herds of cattle and flocks of sheep, which were transported
to Asshur, and on one occasion carried away 250,000
prisoners. * Meanwhile Babylonia waged war with Elam. It is
related that Khur-batila, King of Elam, sent a challenge



362 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
to Kurigalzu III, a descendant of Kadashman-Kharbe,
saying: "Come hither; I will fight with thee". The
Babylonian monarch accepted the challenge, invaded the
territory of his rival, and won a great victory. Deserted by his troops, the Elamite king was taken prisoner, and
did not secure release until he had ceded a portion of
his territory and consented to pay annual tribute to
Babylonia. Flushed with his success, the Kassite king invaded Assyria when Adad-nirari I died and his son Arik-den-ilu
came to the throne. He found, however, that the
Assyrians were more powerful than the Elamites, and suffered defeat. His son, Na'zi-mar-ut'tash 1
, also made an unsuccessful attempt to curb the growing power of the northern Power.
These recurring conflicts were intimately associated
with the Mesopotamian question. Assyria was gradually expanding westward and shattering the dreams of the
Babylonian statesmen and traders who hoped to recover
control of the caravan routes and restore the prestige of
their nation in the west.
Like his father, Adad-nirari 1 of Assyria had attacked
the Aramaean "Suti" who were settling about Haran. He
also acquired a further portion of the ancient kingdom
of Mitanni, with the result that he exercised sway over
part of northern Mesopotamia. After defeating Na'zimar-ut'tash, he fixed the boundaries of the Assyrian and
Babylonian spheres of influence much to the advantage
of his own country. At home Adad-nirari conducted a vigorous policy.
He developed the resources of the city state of Asshur
by constructing a great dam and quay wall, while he contributed to the prosperity of the priesthood and the
* Pr. as oo,



CONFLICTS FOR TRADE 363
growth of Assyrian culture by extending the temple of the god Ashur. Ere he died, he assumed the proud
title of "Shar Kishshate", "king of the world", which
was also used by his son Shalmaneser I. His reign extended over a period of thirty years and terminated
about 1300 B.C. Soon after Shalmaneser came to the throne his country
suffered greatly from an earthquake, which threw down Ishtar's temple at Nineveh and Ashur's temple at Asshur.
Fire broke out in the latter building and destroyed it
completely. These disasters did not dismay the young monarch.
Indeed, they appear to have stimulated him to set out on
a career of conquest, to secure treasure and slaves, so as to
carry out the work of reconstructing the temples without
delay. He became as great a builder, and as tireless a
campaigner as Thothmes III of Egypt, and under his
guidance Assyria became the most powerful nation in Western Asia. Ere he died his armies were so greatly
dreaded that the Egyptians and Assyrians drew their long
struggle for supremacy in Syria to a close, and formed
an alliance for mutual protection against their common
enemy.
It is necessary at this point to review briefly the his
tory of Palestine and north Syria after the period of Hittite expansion under King Subbi-luliuma and the decline of
Egyptian power under Akhenaton. The western part of Mitanni and the most of northern Syria had been colon
ized by the Hittites. 1 Farther south, their allies, the
Amorites, formed a buffer State on the borders of Egypt's limited sphere of influence in southern Palestine, and of
Babylonia's sphere in southern Mesopotamia. Mitanni
1 The chief cities of North Syria were prior to this period Hittite. This expansion did not change the civilization but extended the area of occupation and control. (0642) 26



364 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
was governed by a subject king who was expected to
prevent the acquisition by Assyria of territory in the north-west. Subbi-luliuma was succeeded on the Hittite throne by
his son, King Mursil, who was known to the Egyptians as
" Meraser ", or " Maurasar ". The greater part of this
monarch's reign appears to have been peaceful and pros
perous. His allies protected his frontiers, and he was
able to devote himself to the work of consolidating his
empire in Asia Minor and North Syria. He erected a
great palace at Boghaz Koi, and appears to have had dreams of imitating the splendours of the royal Courts of
Egypt, Assyria, and Babylon.
At this period the Hittite Empire was approaching the zenith of its power. It controlled the caravan roads
of Babylonia and Egypt, and its rulers appear not only to have had intimate diplomatic relations with both these countries, but even to have concerned themselves regard
ing their internal affairs. When Rameses I came to the
Egyptian throne, at the beginning of the Nineteenth
Dynasty, he sealed an agreement with the Hittites, and
at a later date the Hittite ambassador at Babylon, who
represented Hattusil II, the second son of King Mursil, actually intervened in a dispute regarding the selection of
a successor to the throne.
The closing years of King Mursil's reign were dis
turbed by the military conquests of Egypt, which had renewed its strength under Rameses I. Seti I, the son of Rameses I, and the third Pharaoh of the powerful
Nineteenth Dynasty, took advantage of the inactivity of
the Hittite ruler by invading southern Syria. He had
first to grapple with the Amorites, whom he successfully defeated. Then he pressed northward as far as Tunip,
and won a decisive victory over a Hittite army, which



CONFLICTS FOR TRADE 365
secured to Egypt for a period the control of Palestine
as far north as Phoenicia. When Mursil died he was succeeded on the Hittite
throne by his son Mutallu, whom the Egyptians referred
to as " Metella " or " Mautinel ". He was a vigorous
and aggressive monarch, and appears to have lost no time in compelling the Amorites to throw off their
allegiance to Egypt and recognize him as their overlord.
As a result, when Rameses II ascended the Egyptian throne he had to undertake the task of winning back
the Asiatic possessions of his father.
The preliminary operations conducted by Rameses on
the Palestinian coast were attended with much success. Then, in his fifth year, he marched northward with a
great army, with purpose, it would appear, to emulate the achievements of Thothmes III and win fame as a
mighty conqueror. But he underestimated the strength of his rival and narrowly escaped disaster. Advancing impetuously, with but two of his four divisions, he suddenly found himself surrounded by the army of the wily
Hittite, King Mutallu, in the vicinity of the city of Kadesh, on the Orontes. His first division remained
intact, but his second was put to flight by an intervening
force of the enemy. From this perilous position Rameses
extricated himself by leading a daring charge against the Hittite lines on the river bank, which proved successful.
Thrown into confusion, his enemies sought refuge in the city, but the Pharaoh refrained from attacking them there. Although Rameses boasted on his return home of
having achieved a great victory, there is nothing more certain than that this campaign proved a dismal failure.
He was unable to win back for Egypt the northern terri
tories which had acknowledged the suzerainty of Egypt
during the Eighteenth Dynasty. Subsequently he was



366 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
kept fully engaged in maintaining his prestige in northern
Palestine and the vicinity of Phoenicia. Then his Asiatic
military operations, which extended altogether over a
period of about twenty years, were brought to a close
in a dramatic and unexpected manner. The Hittite king Mutallu had died in battle, or by the hand of an assassin, and was succeeded by his brother Hattusil II (Khetasar),
who sealed a treaty of peace with the great Rameses.
An Egyptian copy of this interesting document can still be read on the walls of a Theban temple, but it is
lacking in certain details which interest present-day his
torians. No reference, for instance, is made to the boun
daries of the Egyptian Empire in Syria, so that it is
impossible to estimate the degree of success which attended
the campaigns of Rameses. An interesting light, however, is thrown on the purport of the treaty by a tablet letter which has been discovered by Professor Hugo
Winckler at Boghaz Kfti. It is a copy of a communi
cation addressed by Hattusil II to the King of Babylonia,
who had made an enquiry regarding it. " I will inform my brother," wrote the Hittite monarch ;
" the King
of Egypt and 1 have made an alliance, and made our
selves brothers. Brothers we are and will [unite against]
a common foe, and with friends in common." l The common foe could have been no other than Assyria, and
the Hittite king's letter appears to convey a hint to
Kadashman-turgu of Babylon that he should make com
mon cause with Rameses II and Hattusil. Shalmaneser I of Assyria was pursuing a determined
policy of western and northern expansion. He struck
boldly at the eastern Hittite States and conquered Malatia,
where he secured great treasure for the god Ashur. He
even founded colonies within the Hittite sphere of influ
1 Garstang's The Land of the Hittite^ p. 349.



CONFLICTS FOR TRADE 367
ence on the borders of Armenia. Shalmaneser's second
campaign was conducted against the portion of ancient
Mitanni which was under Hittite control. The vassal
king, Sattuari, apparently a descendant of Tushratta's, endeavoured to resist the Assyrians with the aid of
Hittites and Aramaeans, but his army of allies was put
to flight. The victorious Shalmaneser was afterwards
able to penetrate as far westward as Carchemish on the
Euphrates. Having thus secured the whole of Mitanni, the
Assyrian conqueror attacked the Aramaean hordes which
were keeping the territory round Haran in a continuous
state of unrest, and forced them to recognize him as
their overlord.
Shalmaneser thus, it would appear, gained control of
northern Mesopotamia and consequently of the Baby
lonian caravan route to Haran. As a result Hittite
prestige must have suffered decline in Babylon. For a
generation the Hittites had had the Babylonian merchants
at their mercy, and apparently compelled them to pay heavy duties. Winckler has found among the Boghaz
Kfti tablets several letters from the king of Babylon, who
made complaints regarding robberies committed by Amor
itic bandits, and requested that they should be punished and kept in control. Such a communication is a clear
indication that he was entitled, in lieu of payment, to
have an existing agreement fulfilled. Shalmaneser found that Asshur, the ancient capital, was unsuitable for the administration of his extended
empire, so he built a great city at Kalkhi (Nimrud), the Biblical Calah, which was strategically situated amidst
fertile meadows on the angle of land formed by the
Tigris and the Upper Zab. Thither to a new palace
he transferred his brilliant Court.



368 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
He was succeeded by his son, Tukulti-Ninip I, who was the most powerful of the Assyrian monarchs of the
Old Empire. He made great conquests in the north and
east, extended and strengthened Assyrian influence in
Mesopotamia, and penetrated into Hittite territory, bring
ing into subjection no fewer than forty kings, whom he compelled to pay annual tribute. It was inevitable that
he should be drawn into conflict with the Babylonian
king, who was plotting with the Hittites against him.
One of the tablet letters found by Winckler at Boghaz Koi
is of special interest in this connection. Hattusil advises
the young monarch of Babylonia to " go and plunder the land of the foe". Apparently he sought to be freed from
the harassing attention of the Assyrian conqueror by
prevailing on his Babylonian royal friend to act as a "cat's paw".
It is uncertain whether or not Kashtiliash II of Baby
lonia invaded Assyria with purpose to cripple his rival.
At any rate war broke out between the two countries, and
Tukulti-Nmip proved irresistible in battle. He marched
into Babylonia, and not only defeated Kashtiliash, but captured him and carried him off to Asshur, where he was presented in chains to the god Ashur.
The city of Babylon was captured, its wall was de
molished, and many of its inhabitants were put to the
sword. Tukulti-Ninip was evidently waging a war of
conquest, for he pillaged E-sagila, "the temple of the high head", and removed the golden statue of the god Merodach to Assyria, where it remained for about sixteen
years. He subdued the whole of Babylonia as far south
as the Persian Gulf, and ruled it through viceroys.
Tukulti-Ninip, however, was not a popular emperor
even in his own country. He offended national suscepti
bilities by showing preference for Babylonia, and founding



CONFLICTS FOR TRADE 369
a new city which has not been located. There he built a
great palace and a temple for Ashur and his pantheon.
He called the city after himself, Kar-Tukulti-Ninip 1
.
Seven years after the conquest of Babylonia revolts
broke out against the emperor in Assyria and Babylonia, and he was murdered in his palace, which had been
besieged and captured by an army headed by his own son,
Ashur-natsir-pal I, who succeeded him. The Babylonian nobles meantime drove the Assyrian garrisons from their cities, and set on the throne the Kassite prince Adadshum-utsur.
Thus in a brief space went to pieces the old Assyrian
Empire, which, at the close of Tukulti-Ninip's thirty
years' reign, embraced the whole Tigro-Euphrates valley
from the borders of Armenia to the Persian Gulf. An
obscure century followed, during which Assyria was raided by its enemies and broken up into petty States.
The Elamites were not slow to take advantage of the
state of anarchy which prevailed in Babylonia during the
closing years of Assyrian rule. They overran a part of ancient Sumer, and captured Nippur, where they slew a large number of inhabitants and captured many prisoners.
On a subsequent occasion they pillaged Isin. When, however, the Babylonian king had cleared his country of the Assyrians, he attacked the Elamites and drove them
across the frontier.
Nothing is known regarding the reign of the parricide
Ashur-natsir-pal I of Assyria. He was succeeded by
Ninip-Tukulti-Ashur and Adad-shum-lishir, who either reigned concurrently or were father and son. After a
brief period these were displaced by another two rulers, Ashur-nirari III and Nabu-dan.
It is not clear why Ninip-Tukulti-Ashur was deposed,
1 " Burgh of Tukulti-Ninip."



370 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
Perhaps he was an ally of Adad-shum-utsur, the Baby
lonian king, and was unpopular on that account. He
journeyed to Babylon on one occasion, carrying with him the statue of Merodach, but did not return. Perhaps he fled from the rebels. At any rate Adad-shum-utsur was
asked to send him back, by an Assyrian dignitary who
was probably Ashur-nirari III. The king of Babylon
refused this request, nor would he give official recognition
to the new ruler or rulers.
Soon afterwards another usurper, Bel-kudur-utsur, led
an Assyrian army against the Babylonians, but was slain
in battle. He was succeeded by Ninip-apil-esharia, who led his forces back to Asshur, followed by Adad-shum
utsur. The city was besieged but not captured by the Babylonian army. Under Adad-shum-utsur, who reigned for thirty years, Babylonia recovered much of its ancient splendour. It
held Elam in check and laid a heavy hand on Assyria,
which had been paralysed by civil war. Once again it
possessed Mesopotamia and controlled its caravan road to
Haran and Phoenicia, and apparently its relations with the
Hittites and Syrians were of a cordial character. The
next king, Meli-shipak, assumed the Assyrian title " Shar
Kishshati ", " king of the world ", and had a prosperous
reign of fifteen years. He was succeeded by Marduk
aplu-iddin I, who presided over the destinies of Babylonia for about thirteen years. Thereafter the glory of the Kassite
Dynasty passed away. King Zamama-shum-iddin followed with a twelvemonth's reign, during which his kingdom
was successfully invaded from the north by the Assyrians under King Ashur-dan I, and from the east by the
Elamites under a king whose name has not been traced.
Several towns were captured and pillaged, and rich booty was carried off to Asshur and Susa.



CONFLICTS FOR TRADE 371
Bel-shum-iddin succeeded Zamama-shum-iddin, but
three years afterwards he was deposed by a king of Isin. So ended the Kassite Dynasty of Babylonia, which had
endured for a period of 576 years and nine months. Babylonia was called Karduniash during the Kassite
Dynasty. This name was originally applied to the district at the river mouths, where the alien rulers appear to have
first achieved ascendancy. Apparently they were strongly supported by the non-Semitic elements in the population,
and represented a popular revolt against the political supremacy of the city of Babylon and its god Merodach. It is significant to find in this connection that the early
Kassite kings showed a preference for Nippur as their
capital and promoted the worship of Enlil, the elder Bel,
who was probably identified with their own god of fertility
and battle. Their sun god, Sachi, appears to have been
merged in Shamash. In time, however, the kings followed
the example of Hammurabi by exalting Merodach.
The Kassite language added to the "Babel of tongues"
among the common people, but was never used in in
scriptions. At an early period the alien rulers became
thoroughly Babylonianized, and as they held sway for nearly six centuries it cannot be assumed that they were
unpopular. They allowed their mountain homeland, or earliest area of settlement in the east, to be seized and
governed by Assyria, and probably maintained as slight a connection with it after settlement in Babylonia as did the Saxons of England with their Continental area of origin.
Although Babylonia was not so great a world power
under the Kassites as it had been during the Hammurabi
Dynasty, it prospered greatly as an industrial, agricultural,
and trading country. The Babylonian language was used
throughout western Asia as the language of diplomacy and commerce, and the city of Babylon was the most



372 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
important commercial metropolis of the ancient world.
Its merchants traded directly and indirectly with far
distant countries. They imported cobalt which was used
for colouring glass a vivid blue from China, and may
have occasionally met Chinese traders who came westward with their caravans, while a brisk trade in marble and limestone was conducted with and through Elam. Egypt
was the chief source of the gold supply, which was obtained from the Nubian mines ; and in exchange for
this precious metal the Babylonians supplied the Nilotic merchants with lapis-lazuli from Bactria, enamel, and their own wonderful coloured glass, which was not unlike the
later Venetian, as well as chariots and horses. The
Kassites were great horse breeders, and the battle steeds
from the Babylonian province of Namar were everywhere in great demand. They also promoted the cattle trade.
Cattle rearing was confined chiefly to the marshy districts
at the head of the Persian Gulf, and the extensive steppes on the borders of the Arabian desert, so well known to
Abraham and his ancestors, which provided excellent
grazing. Agriculture also flourished; as in Egypt it constituted the basis of national and commercial prosperity.
It is evident that great wealth accumulated in Kar
duniash during the Kassite period. When the images of Merodach and Zerpanitu01 were taken back to Babylon,
from Assyria, they were clad, as has been recorded, in
garments embroidered with gold and sparkling with gems, while E-sagila was redecorated on a lavish scale with price
less works of art.
Assyria presented a sharp contrast to Babylonia, the mother land, from which its culture was derived. As a
separate kingdom it had to develop along different lines. In fact, it was unable to exist as a world power without
the enforced co-operation of neighbouring States. Baby



CONFLICTS FOR TRADE 373
Ionia, on the other hand, could have flourished in com
parative isolation, like Egypt during the Old Kingdom period, because it was able to feed itself and maintain a
large population so long as its rich alluvial plain was irrigated during its dry season, which extended over about eight months in the year.
The region north of Baghdad was of different geographical formation to the southern plain, and therefore
less suitable for the birth and growth of a great inde
pendent civilization. Assyria embraced a chalk plateau
of the later Mesozoic period, with tertiary deposits, and
had an extremely limited area suitable for agricultural
pursuits. Its original inhabitants were nomadic pastoral
and hunting tribes, and there appears to be little doubt that agriculture was introduced along the banks of the
Tigris by colonists from Babylonia, who formed city States which owed allegiance to the kings of Sumer and Akkad. After the Hammurabi period Assyria rose into pro
minence as a predatory power, which depended for its stability upon those productive countries which it was able to conquer and hold in sway. It never had a numerous
peasantry, and such as it had ultimately vanished, for
the kings pursued the short-sighted policy of colonizing districts on the borders of their empire with their loyal
subjects, and settling aliens in the heart of the homeland, where they were controlled by the military. In this
manner they built up an artificial empire, which suffered
at critical periods in its history because it lacked the
great driving and sustaining force of a population welded together by immemorial native traditions and the love of
country which is the essence of true patriotism. National
sentiment was chiefly confined to the military aristocracy and the priests ; the enslaved and uncultured masses of



374 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
aliens were concerned mainly with their daily duties, and
no doubt included communities, like the Israelites in
captivity, who longed to return to their native lands.
Assyria had to maintain a standing army, which grew
from an alliance of brigands who first enslaved the native
population, and ultimately extended their sway over
neighbouring States. The successes of the army made
Assyria powerful. Conquering kings accumulated rich booty by pillaging alien cities, and grew more and more wealthy as they were able to impose annual tribute on those States which came under their sway. They even
regarded Babylonia with avaricious eyes. It was to achieve the conquest of the fertile and prosperous mother
State that the early Assyrian emperors conducted military operations in the north-west and laid hands on
Mesopotamia. There was no surer way of strangling it
than by securing control of its trade routes. What the
command of the sea is to Great Britain at the present
day, the command of the caravan roads was to ancient
Babylonia. Babylonia suffered less than Assyria by defeat in
battle ; its natural resources gave it great recuperative
powers, and the native population was ever so intensely patriotic that centuries of alien sway could not obliterate
their national aspirations. A conqueror of Babylon had
to become a Babylonian. The Amorites and Kassites had
in turn to adopt the modes of life and modes of thought
of the native population. Like the Egyptians, the Babylonians ever achieved the intellectual conquest of their
conquerors.
The Assyrian Empire, on the other hand, collapsed like a house of cards when its army of mercenaries
suffered a succession of disasters. The kings, as we have
indicated, depended on the tribute of subject States to pay



CONFLICTS FOR TRADE 375
their soldiers and maintain the priesthood ; they were
faced with national bankruptcy when their vassals success
fully revolted against them.
The history of Assyria as a world power is divided
into three periods: (i) the Old Empire; (2) the Middle
Empire; (3) the New or Last Empire.
We have followed the rise and growth of the Old
Empire from the days of Ashur-uballit until the reign of
Tukulti-Ninip, when it flourished in great splendour and suddenly went to pieces. Thereafter, until the second
period of the Old Empire, Assyria comprised but a few city States which had agricultural resources and were
trading centres. Of these the most enterprising was
Asshur. When a ruler of Asshur was able, by conserv
ing his revenues, to command sufficient capital with pur
pose to raise a strong army of mercenaries as a business
speculation, he set forth to build up a new empire on
the ruins of the old. In its early stages, of course, this
process was slow and difficult. It necessitated the adop
tion of a military career by native Assyrians, who officered
the troops, and these troops had to be trained and dis
ciplined by engaging in brigandage, which also brought them rich rewards for their services. Babylonia became
powerful by developing the arts of peace; Assyria became powerful by developing the science of warfare.

GREAT changes were taking place in the ancient world
during the period in which Assyria rose into prominence and suddenly suffered decline. These were primarily due
to widespread migrations of pastoral peoples from the steppe lands of Asia and Europe, and the resulting dis
placement of settled tribes. The military operations of
the great Powers were also a disturbing factor, for they
not only propelled fresh movements beyond their spheres of influence, but caused the petty States to combine
against a common enemy and foster ambitions to achieve
conquests on a large scale. Towards the close of the Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt, of which Amenhotep III and Akhenaton were
the last great kings, two well-defined migrations were in 876



RACE MOVEMENTS 377
progress. The Aramaean folk-waves had already begun to
pour in increasing volume into Syria from Arabia, and in Europe the pastoral fighting folk from the mountains
were establishing themselves along the south-eastern coast
and crossing the Hellespont to overrun the land of the Hittites. These race movements were destined to exer
cise considerable influence in shaping the history of the
ancient world.
The Aramaean, or Third Semitic migration, in time
swamped various decaying States, Despite the successive
efforts of the great Powers to hold it in check, it ulti
mately submerged the whole of Syria and part of Meso
potamia. Aramaean speech then came into common use
among the mingled peoples over a wide area, and was not displaced until the time of the Fourth Semitic or
Moslem migration from Arabia, which began in the seventh century of the Christian era, and swept northward
through Syria to Asia Minor, eastward across Mesopotamia into Persia and India, and westward through Egypt
along the north African coast to Morocco, and then into
SpainW.hen Syria was sustaining the first shocks of Ara
maean invasion, the last wave of Achaeans, " the tamers of
horses" and "shepherds of the people
1
', had achieved the conquest of Greece, and contributed to the overthrow of
the dynasty of King Minos of Crete. Professor Ridge
way identifies this stock, which had been filtering south
ward for several centuries, with the tall, fair-haired, and
grey-eyed "Keltoi" (Celts),
1 who, Dr. Haddon believes,
were representatives of " the mixed peoples of northern and Alpine descent".2 Mr. Hawes, following Professor Sergi, holds, on the other hand, that the Achaeans were
1 Article u Celts " in Encydopadia Britannica^ eleventh ed.
8 Tke Wanderings of Peoples, p. 41.



378 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
"fair in comparison with the native (Pelasgian- Mediter
ranean) stock, but not necessarily blonde".1 The earliest Achaeans were rude, uncultured barbarians, but the last wave came from some unknown centre of civilization, and
probably used iron as well as bronze weapons.
The old Cretans were known to the Egyptians as the "Keftiu", and traded on the Mediterranean and the
Black Sea. It is significant to find, however, that no mention is made of them in the inscriptions of the
Pharaohs after the reign of Amenhotep III. In their
place appear the Shardana, the Mykenaean people who
gave their name to Sardinia, the Danauna, believed to be
identical with the Danaoi of Homer, the Akhaivasha,
perhaps the Achaeans, and the Tursha and Shakalsha, who may have been of the same stock as the piratical Lycians.
When Rameses II fought his famous battle at Kadesh the Hittite king included among his allies the Aramaeans
from Arabia, and other mercenaries like the Dardanui and
Masa, who represented the Thraco-Phrygian peoples who had overrun the Balkans, occupied Thrace and Macedonia, and crossed into Asia Minor. In time the Hittite con
federacy was broken up by the migrating Europeans, and
their dominant tribe, the Muski 2 the Moschoi of the Greeks and the Meshech of the Old Testament came
into conflict with the Assyrians. The Muski were fore
runners of the Phrygians, and were probably of allied
stock.
Pharaoh Meneptah, the son of Rameses II, did not
benefit much by the alliance with the Hittites, to whom
he had to send a supply of grain during a time of famine.
He found it necessary, indeed, to invade Syria, where their influence had declined, and had to beat back from
the Delta region the piratical invaders of the same tribes
1 Crete, th Forfrunner of Greece^ p. 146. a Pr, Moosh'kcc,



RACE MOVEMENTS 379
as were securing a footing in Asia Minor. In Syria
Meneptah fought with the Israelites, who apparently had begun their conquest of Canaan during his reign. Before the Kassite Dynasty had come to an end,
Rameses III of Egypt (1198-1167 B.C.) freed his country from the perils of a great invasion of Europeans by land
and sea. He scattered a fleet on the Delta coast, and
then arrested the progress of a strong force which was pressing southward through Phoenicia towards the Egyp
tian frontier. These events occurred at the beginning of the Homeric Age, and were followed by the siege of Troy,
which, according to the Greeks, began about 1194 B.C.
The land raiders who were thwarted by Rameses III
were the Philistines, a people from Crete. 1 When the prestige of Egypt suffered decline they overran the coast
line of Canaan, and that country was then called Palestine,
"the land of the Philistines", while the Egyptian over
land trade route to Phoenicia became known as " the way
of the Philistines". Their conflicts with the Hebrews
are familiar to readers of the Old Testament. " The only
contributions the Hebrews made to the culture of the
country", writes Professor Macalister, "were their simple
desert customs and their religious organization. On the
other hand, the Philistines, sprung from one of the great homes of art of the ancient world, had brought with them
the artistic instincts of their race: decayed no doubt, but
still superior to anything they met with in the land itself.
Tombs to be ascribed to them, found in Gezer, contained beautiful jewellery and ornaments. The Philistines, in
fact, were the only cultured or artistic race who ever occu
pied the soil of Palestine, at least until the time when the
influence of classical Greece asserted itself too strongly
1 " Have I not brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt and the Philistines from
Caphtor (Crete)?" Amos, viii, 7.

380 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
to be withstood. Whatsoever things raised life in the
country above the dull animal existence of fellahin were
due to this people. . . . The peasantry of the modern
villages . . . still tell of the great days of old when it
(Palestine) was inhabited by the mighty race of the 'Fenish'." 1
When the Kassite Dynasty of Babylonia was extin
guished, about 1 140 B.C., the Amorites were being displaced in Palestine by the Philistines and the Israelitish tribes;
the Aramaeans were extending their conquests in Syria and Mesopotamia ; the Muski were the overlords of the
Hittites; Assyrian power was being revived at the beginning of the second period of the Old Empire; and Egypt
was governed by a weakly king, Rameses VIII, a puppet
in the hands of the priesthood, who was unable to protect
the rich tombs of the Eighteenth Dynasty Pharaohs
against the bands of professional robbers who were plun
dering them.
A new dynasty the Dynasty of Pashe had arisen at
the ancient Sumerian city of Ism. Its early kings were
contemporary with some of the last Kassite monarchs,
and they engaged in conflicts with the Elamites, who were
encroaching steadily upon Babylonian territory, and were ultimately able to seize the province of Namar, famous for its horses, which was situated to the east of Akkad.
The Assyrians, under Ashur-dan I, were not only recon
quering lost territory, but invading Babylonia and carrying off rich plunder. Ashur-dan inflicted a crushing defeat
upon the second-last Kassite ruler.
There years later Nebuchadrezzar I, of the Dynasty
of Pashe, seized the Babylonian throne. He was the
most powerful and distinguished monarch of his line an accomplished general and a wise statesman. His name
1 A Hiitory of CrviliiHition in Palestine, p. 58.



RACE MOVEMENTS 381
signifies: "May the god Nebo protect my boundary".
His first duty was to drive the Elamites from the land, and win back from them the statue of Merodach which
they had carried off from E-sagila. At first he suffered
a reverse, but although the season was midsummer, and
the heat overpowering, he persisted in his campaign.
The Elamites were forced to retreat, and following up
their main force he inflicted upon them a shattering
defeat on the banks of the Ula, a tributary of the Tigris.
He then invaded Elam and returned with rich booty.
The province of Namar was recovered, and its governor,
Ritti Merodach, who was Nebuchadrezzar's battle com
panion, was restored to his family possessions and ex
empted from taxation. A second raid to Elam resulted
in the recovery of the statue of Merodach. The Kassite and Lullume mountaineers also received attention, and were taught to respect the power of the new monarch.
Having freed his country from the yoke of the
Elamites, and driven the Assyrians over the frontier, Nebuchadrezzar came into conflict with the Hittites, who
appear to have overrun Mesopotamia. Probably the invaders were operating in conjunction with the Muski,
who were extending their sway over part of northern
Assyria. They were not content with securing control of the trade route, but endeavoured also to establish them
selves permanently in Babylon, the commercial metropolis, which they besieged and captured. This happened in the third year of Nebuchadrezzar, when he was still reigning at Isin. Assembling a strong force, he hastened north
ward and defeated the Hittites, and apparently followed
up his victory. Probably it was at this time that he
conquered the "West Land" (the land of the Amorites) and penetrated to the Mediterranean coast. Egyptian
power had been long extinguished in that region.



382 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
The possession of Mesopotamia was a signal triumph
for Babylonia. As was inevitable, however, it brought
Nebuchadrezzar into conflict some years later with the
Assyrian king, Ashur-resh-ishi 1, grandson of Ashur-dan,
and father of the famous Tiglath-pileser I. The northern monarch had engaged himself in subduing the Lullume
and Akhlami hill tribes in the south-east, whose territory had been conquered by Nebuchadrezzar. Thereafter he crossed the Babylonian frontier. Nebuchadrezzar drove him back and then laid siege to the border fortress of
Zanki, but the Assyrian king conducted a sudden and successful reconnaissance in force which rendered perilous
the position of the attacking force. By setting fire to his siege train the Babylonian war lord was able, however, to retreat in good order.
Some time later Nebuchadrezzar dispatched another
army northward, but it suffered a serious defeat, and its
general, Karashtu, fell into the hands of the enemy, Nebuchadrezzar reigned less than twenty years, and
appears to have secured the allegiance of the nobility by restoring the feudal system which had been abolished by
the Kassites. He boasted that he was " the sun of his
country, who restored ancient landmarks and boundaries",
and promoted the worship of Ishtar, the ancient goddess
of the people. By restoring the image of Merodach he
secured the support of Babylon, to which city he trans
ferred his Court. Nebuchadrezzar was succeeded by his son Ellil-nadin
apil, who reigned a few years; but little or nothing is
known regarding him. His grandson, Marduk-nadin
akhe, came into conflict with Tiglath-pileser I of Assyria, and suffered serious reverses, from the effects of which
his country did not recover for over a century.
Tiglath-pileser I, in one of his inscriptions, recorded



RACE MOVEMENTS 383
significantly: "The feet of the enemy I kept from my
country". When he came to the throne, northern Assyria was menaced by the Muski and their allies, the Hittites
and the Shubari of old Mitanni. The Kashiari hill tribes
to the north of Nineveh, whom Shalmaneser I subdued,
had half a century before thrown off the yoke of Assyria,
and their kings were apparently vassals of the Muski.
Tiglath-pileser first invaded Mitanni, where he routed a combined force of Shubari hillmen and Hittites. There
after a great army of the Muski and their allies pressed
southward with purpose to deal a shattering blow against
the Assyrian power. The very existence of Assyria as a separate power was threatened by this movement.
Tiglath-pileser, however, was equal to the occasion. He surprised the invaders among the Kashiari mountains and
inflicted a crushing defeat, slaying about 14,000 and
capturing 6000 prisoners, who were transported to Asshur. In fact, he wiped the invading army out of existence and possessed himself of all its baggage. There
after he captured several cities, and extended his empire
beyond the Kashiari hills and into the heart of Mitanni.
His second campaign was also directed towards the Mitanni district, which had been invaded during his
absence by a force of Hittites, about 4000 strong. The invaders submitted to him as soon as he drew near, and
he added them to his standing army.
Subsequent operations towards the north restored the
pre-eminence of Assyria in the Nairi country, on the shores of Lake Van, in Armenia, where Tiglath-pileser
captured no fewer than twenty-three petty kings. These he liberated after they had taken the oath of allegiance and consented to pay annual tribute.
In his fourth year the conqueror learned that the
Aramaeans were crossing the Euphrates and possessing



384 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
themselves of Mitanni, which he had cleared of the
Hittites. By a series of forced marches he caught them
unawares, scattered them in confusion, and entered Car
chemish, which he pillaged. Thereafter his army crossed
the Euphrates in boats of skin, and plundered and destroyed six cities round the base of the mountain of Bishru.
While operating in this district, Tiglath-pileser engaged
in big-game hunting. He recorded: "Ten powerful bull elephants in the land of Haran and on the banks of the
Khabour I killed ; four elephants alive I took. Their
skins, their teeth, with the living elephants, I brought to
my city of Asshur." 1 He also claimed to have slain 920
lions, as well as a nujnber of wild oxen, apparently includ
ing in his record the " bags
" of his officers and men.
A
later king credited him with having penetrated to the
Phoenician coast, where he put to sea and slew a sea monster called the "nakhiru". While at Arvad, the
narrative continues, the King of Egypt, who is not named,
sent him a hippopotamus (pagutu). This story, however, is of doubtful authenticity. About this time the prestige
of Egypt was at so low an ebb that its messengers were
subjected to indignities by the Phoenician kings.
The conquests of Tiglath-pileser once more raised the
Mesopotamia!! question in Babylonia, whose sphere of
influence in that region had been invaded. Marduk
nadin-akhe, the grandson of Nebuchadrezzar I, "arrayed his chariots" against Tiglath-pileser, and in the first
conflict achieved some success, but subsequently he was
defeated in the land of Akkad. The Assyrian army
afterwards captured several cities, including Babylon and
Sippar. Thus once again the Assyrian Empire came into being

as the predominant world Power, extending from the land of the Hittites into the heart of Babylonia. Its cities
were enriched by the immense quantities of booty captured by its warrior king, while the coffers of state were glutted
with the tribute of subject States. Fortifications were
renewed, temples were built, and great gifts were lavished on the priesthood. Artists and artisans were kept fully
employed restoring the faded splendours of the Old Empire, and everywhere thousands of slaves laboured to
make the neglected land prosperous as of old. Canals were repaired and reopened ; the earthworks and quay wall of Ashur were strengthened, and its great wall was
entirely rebuilt, faced with a rampart of earth, and pro
tected once again by a deep moat. The royal palace was enlarged and redecorated. Meanwhile Babylonia was wasted by civil war and invasions. It was entered more than once by the Ara
maeans, who pillaged several cities in the north and the
south. Then the throne was seized by Adad-aplu-iddina,
the grandson of "a nobody", who reigned for about ten
years. He was given recognition, however, by the Assy
rian king, Ashur-bel-kala, son of Tiglath-pileser I, who married his daughter, and apparently restored to him
Sippar and Babylon after receiving a handsome dowry. Ashur-bel-kala died without issue, and was succeeded by his brother, Shamshi-Adad.
An obscure period followed. In Babylonia there were
two weak dynasties in less than half a century, and there
after an Elamite Dynasty which lasted about six years.
An Eighth Dynasty ensued, and lasted between fifty and
sixty years. The records of its early kings are exceedingly meagre and their order uncertain. During the reign of
Nabu-mukin-apli, who was perhaps the fourth monarch, the Aramaeans constantly raided the land and hovered



386 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
about Babylon. The names of two or three kings who
succeeded Nabu-mukin-apli are unknown.
A century and a half after Tiglath-pileser I conquered
the north Syrian possessions of the Hittites, the Old Assyrian Empire reached the close of its second and last
period. It had suffered gradual decline, under a series
of inert and luxury-loving kings, until it was unable to withstand the gradual encroachment on every side of the
restless hill tribes, who were ever ready to revolt when
the authority of Ashur was not asserted at the point of the sword.
After 950 B.C. the Hittites of North Syria, having
shaken off the last semblance of Assyrian authority,
revived their power, and enjoyed a full century of inde
pendence and prosperity. In Cappadocia their kinsmen had freed themselves at an earlier period from the yoke
of the Muski, who had suffered so severely at the hands
of Tiglath-pileser I. The Hittite buildings and rock sculptures of this period testify to the enduring character of the ancient civilization of the "Hatti". Until the
hieroglyphics can be read, however, we must wait patiently for the detailed story of the pre-Phrygian period, which was of great historical importance, because the tide of
cultural influence was then flowing at its greatest volume from the old to the new world, where Greece was emer
ging in virgin splendour out of the ruins of the ancient
Mykenaean and Cretan civilizations.
It is possible that the conquest of a considerable part
of Palestine by the Philistines was not unconnected with
the revival of Hittite power in the north. They may
have moved southward as the allies of the Cilician State
which was rising into prominence. For a period they
were the overlords of the Hebrews, who had been dis
placing the older inhabitants of the " Promised Land ",



RACE MOVEMENTS 387
and appear to have been armed with weapons of iron. In
fact, as is indicated by a passage in the Book of Samuel,
they had made a "corner" in that metal and restricted its
use among their vassals. "Now", the Biblical narrative
sets forth, " there was no smith found throughout all the
land of Israel; for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords and spears; but all the Israelites went
down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share,
and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock".1 "We are
inclined", says Professor Macalister, "to picture the West as a thing of yesterday, new fangled with its inventions
and its progressive civilization, and the East as an embodiment of hoary and unchanging traditions. But when
West first met East on the shores of the Holy Land, it
was the former which represented the magnificent traditions of the past, and the latter which looked forward to
the future. The Philistines were of the remnant of the
dying glories of Crete; the Hebrews had no past to speak
of, but were entering on the heritage they regarded as theirs, by right of a recently ratified divine covenant." 2
Saul was the leader of a revolt against the Philistines
in northern Palestine, and became the ruler of the kingdom
of Israel. Then David, having liberated Judah from the
yoke of the Philistines, succeeded Saul as ruler of Israel,
and selected Jerusalem as his capital. He also conquered
Edom and Moab, but was unsuccessful in his attempt to
subjugate Ammon. The Philistines were then confined
to a restricted area on the seacoast, where they fused
with the Semites and ultimately suffered loss of identity. Under the famous Solomon the united kingdom of the
Hebrews reached its highest splendour and importance among the nations.
If the Philistines received the support of the Hittites,
1 / Samuel, xiii, 19. 2 A History of Civilization in Palestine, p. 54.



388 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
the Hebrews were strengthened by an alliance with
Egypt. For a period of two and a half centuries no
Egyptian army had crossed the Delta frontier into Syria.
The ancient land of the Pharaohs had been overshadowed meantime by a cloud of anarchy, and piratical and robber
bands settled freely on its coast line. At length a Libyan
general named Sheshonk (Shishak) seized the throne
from the Tanite Dynasty. He was the Pharaoh with
whom Solomon "made affinity",
1 and from whom he received the city of Gezer, which an Egyptian army had
captured.2 Solomon had previously married a daughter of Sheshonk's.
Phoenicia was also flourishing. Freed from Egyptian,
Hittite, and Assyrian interference. Tyre and Sidon at
tained to a high degree of power as independent city States. During the reigns of David and Solomon, Tyre was the predominant Phoenician power. Its kings, Abi
baal and his son Hiram, had become " Kings of the
Sidonians", and are believed to have extended their sway
over part of Cyprus. The relations between the Hebrews and the Phoenicians were of a cordial character, indeed
the two powers became allies.
And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his
father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David. And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying, Thou knowgst how that David my father could
not build an house unto the narrfe of the Lord His God for the wars which were about him on every side, until the Lord put them
under the soles of his feet. But now the Lord my God hath given
me rest on every side, so that there is neither adversary nor evil occurrent. And, behold, I purpose to build an house unto the name of the Lord my God, as the Lord spake unto David my father,
saying, Thy son, whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room,
he shall build an house unto my name. Now therefore command

thou that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon; and my servants
shall be with thy servants: and unto thee will I give hire for thy
servants according to all that thou shalt appoint: for thou knowest that there is not among us any that can skill to hew timber like
unto the Sidonians. And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be the Lord this day, which hath given unto David a wise son over this great people.
And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the
things which thou sentest to me for: and I will do all thy desire
concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir. My
servants shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea: and I will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that thou shalt
appoint me, and will cause them to be dischaiged there, and thou shalt receive them: and thou shalt accomplish my desire, in giving
food for my household. So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and
fir trees according to all his desire.
And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat
for food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus
gave Solomon to Hiram year by year. And the Lord gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and there was peace between Hiram
and Solomon; and they two made a league together. 1
Hiram also sent skilled workers to Jerusalem to assist
in the work of building the temple and Solomon's palace,
including his famous namesake, " a widow's son of the
(Hebrew) tribe of Naphtali", who, like his father, "a man
of Tyre", had "understanding and cunning to work all works in brass". 2
Solomon must have cultivated good relations with the
Chaldseans, for he had a fleet of trading ships on the Persian Gulf which was manned by Phoenician sailors.
"Once in three years", the narrative runs, "came the
navy of Tharshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and
apes, and peacocks." 3 Apparently he traded with India, the land of peacocks, during the Brahmanical period, when

the Sanskrit name "Samudra", which formerly signified the "collected waters" of the broadening Indus, was
applied to the Indian Ocean. 1 The Aramaeans of the Third Semitic migration were not slow to take advantage of the weakness of Assyria and Babylon. They overran the whole of Syria, and
entered into the possession of Mesopotamia, thus acquiring full control of the trade routes towards the west.
From time to time they ravaged Babylonia from the north to the south. Large numbers of them acquired
permanent settlement in that country, like the Amorites
of the Second Semitic migration in the pre-Hammurabi
Age. In Syria the Aramaeans established several petty States,
and were beginning to grow powerful at Damascus, an important trading centre, which assumed considerable
political importance after the collapse of Assyria's Old
Empire. At this period, too, the Chaldaeans came into promi
nence in Babylonia. Their kingdom of Chaldaea (Kaldu, which signifies Sealand) embraces a wide stretch of the coast land at the head of the Persian Gulf between Arabia and
Elam. As we have seen, an important dynasty flourished
in this region in the time of Hammurabi. Although more than one king of Babylon recorded that he had
extinguished the Sealand Power, it continued to exist
all through the Kassite period. It is possible that this
obscure kingdom embraced diverse ethnic elements, and
that it was controlled in turn by military aristocracies of
Sumerians, Elamites, Kassites, and Arabians. After the downfall of the Kassites it had become thoroughly
Semitized, perhaps as a result of the Aramaean migration, which may have found one of its outlets around the head
1 Indian Myth and Legend, pp. 83-4.



RACE MOVEMENTS 391
of the Persian Gulf. The ancient Sumerian city of Ur,
which dominated a considerable area of steppe land to the west of the Euphrates, was included in the Sealand
kingdom, and was consequently referred to in after-time
as "Ur of the Chaldees".
When Solomon reigned over Judah and Israel, Babylonia was broken up into a number of petty States, as in
early Sumerian times. The feudal revival of Nebuchadrezzar I had weakened the central power, with the result
that the nominal high kings were less able to resist the
inroads of invaders. Military aristocracies of Aramaeans, Elamites, and Chaldaeans held sway in various parts of the
valley, and struggled for supremacy.
When Assyria began to assert itself again, it laid claim
on Babylonia, ostensibly as the protector of its indepen
dence, and the Chaldaeans for a time made common cause
with the Elamites against it. The future, however, lay with the Chaldaeans, who, like the Kassites, became the
liberators of the ancient inhabitants. When Assyria was
finally extinguished as a world power they revived the
ancient glory of Babylonia, and supplanted the Sumerians
as the scholars and teachers of Western Asia. The Chal
daeans became famous in Syria, and even in Greece, as "the wise men from the east", and were renowned as
astrologers.
The prestige of the Hebrew kingdom suffered sharp and serious decline after Solomon's death. Pharaoh
Sheshonk fostered the elements of revolt which ultimately
separated Israel from Judah, and, when a favourable
opportunity arose, invaded Palestine and Syria and re
established Egypt's suzerainty over part of the area
which had been swayed by Rameses II, replenishing his exhausted treasury with rich booty and the tribute he
imposed. Phoenicia was able, however, to maintain its



392 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
independence, but before the Assyrians moved westward again, Sidon had shaken off the yoke of Tyre and become
an independent State. It will be seen from the events outlined in this chapter
how greatly the history of the ancient world was affected
by the periodic migrations of pastoral folks from the steppe lands. These human tides were irresistible. The
direction of their flow might be diverted for a time, but
they ultimately overcame every obstacle by sheer persistency and overpowering volume. Great emperors in Assyria and Egypt endeavoured to protect their countries
from the "Bedouin peril" by strengthening their frontiers
and extending their spheres of influence, but the dammed
up floods of humanity only gathered strength in the interval for the struggle which might be postponed but could not be averted.
These migrations, as has been indicated, were due to
natural causes. They were propelled by climatic changes which caused a shortage of the food supply, and by the
rapid increase of population under peaceful conditions.
Once a migration began to flow, it set in motion many currents and cross currents, but all these converged
towards the districts which offered the most attractions
to mankind. Prosperous and well-governed States were
ever in peril of invasion by barbarous peoples. The fruits
of civilization tempted them; the reward of conquest
was quickly obtained in Babylon and Egypt with their
flourishing farms and prosperous cities. Waste land was
reclaimed then as now by colonists from centres of civili
zation; the migrating pastoral folks lacked the initiative
and experience necessary to establish new communities in
undeveloped districts. Highly civilized men sowed the
harvest and the barbarians reaped it.
It must not be concluded, however, that the migra

tions were historical disasters, or that they retarded the
general advancement of the human race. In time the
barbarians became civilized and fused with the peoples
whom they conquered. They introduced, too, into communities which had grown stagnant and weakly, a fresh
and invigorating atmosphere that acted as a stimulant in
every sphere of human activity. The Kassite, for in
stance, was a unifying and therefore a strengthening influ
ence in Babylonia. He shook oflf the manacles of the past which bound the Sumerian and the Akkadian alike
to traditional lines of policy based on unforgotten ancient
rivalries. His concern was chiefly with the future. The
nomads with their experience of desert wandering promoted trade, and the revival of trade inaugurated new eras of
prosperity in ancient centres of culture, and brought them into closer touch than ever before with one another. The
rise of Greece was due to the blending of the Achaeans
and other pastoral fighting folks with the indigenous Pelasgians. Into the early States which fostered the
elements of ancient Mykenaean civilization, poured the cultural influences of the East through Asia Minor and
Phoenicia and from the Egyptian coast. The conquerors
from the steppes meanwhile contributed their genius for
organization, their simple and frugal habits of life, and
their sterling virtues ; they left a deep impress on the moral, physical, and intellectual life of Greece.

IN one of the Scottish versions of the Seven Sleepers
legend a shepherd enters a cave, in which the great heroes
of other days lie wrapped in magic slumber, and blows two blasts on the horn which hangs suspended from the
roof. The sleepers open their eyes and raise themselves
on their elbows. Then the shepherd hears a warning voice which comes and goes like the wind, saying: "If
the horn is blown once again, the world will be upset
altogether". Terrified by the Voice and the ferocious
appearance of the heroes, the shepherd retreats hurriedly, locking the door behind him; he casts the key into the
sea. The story proceeds: "If anyone should find the
key and open the door, and blow but a single blast on
the horn, Finn and all the Feans would come forth. And that would be a great day in Alban." 1

HEBREWS IN ASSYRIAN HISTORY 395
After the lapse of an obscure century the national
heroes of Assyria were awakened as if from sleep by the
repeated blasts from the horn of the triumphant thunder
god amidst the northern and western mountains Adad
or Rimmon of Syria, Teshup of Armenia, Tarku of the
western Hittites. The great kings who came forth to
"upset the world " bore the familiar names, Ashur-natsir
pal, Shalmaneser, Shamash-Adad, Ashur-dan, Adad-nirari, and Ashur-nirari. They revived and increased the ancient
glory of Assyria during its Middle Empire period.
The Syro-Cappadocian Hittites had grown once again powerful and prosperous, but no great leader like Subbiluliuma arose to weld the various States into an Empire,
so as to ensure the protection of the mingled peoples from the operations of the aggressive and ambitious
war-lords of Assyria. One kingdom had its capital at
Hamath and another at Carchemish on the Euphrates.
The kingdom of Tabal flourished in Cilicia (Khilakku);
it included several city States like Tarsus, Tiana, and Comana (Kammanu). Farther west was the dominion
of the Thraco-Phrygian Muski. The tribes round the
shores of Lake Van had asserted themselves and extended
their sphere of influence. The State of Urartu was of
growing importance, and the Nairi tribes had spread
round the south-eastern shores of Lake Van. The
northern frontier of Assyria was continually menaced by
groups of independent hill States which would have been
irresistible had they operated together against a common
enemy, but were liable to be extinguished when attacked
in detail.
A number of Aramaean kingdoms had come into
existence in Mesopotamia and throughout Syria. The most influential of these was the State of Damascus, the king of which was the overlord of the Hebrew
(C64ti) 28



396 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
kingdoms of Israel and Judah when Ashur-natsir-pal III ascended the Assyrian throne about 885 B.C. Groups of
the Aramaeans had acquired a high degree of culture and
become traders and artisans. Large numbers had filtered,
as well, not only into Babylonia but also Assyria and the north Syrian area of Hittite control. Accustomed for
generations to desert warfare, they were fearless warriors.
Their armies had great mobility, being composed mostly of mounted infantry, and were not easily overpowered by the Assyrian forces of footmen and charioteers. Indeed,
it was not until cavalry was included in the standing
army of Assyria that operations against the Aramaeans were attended with permanent success.
Ashur-natsir-pal III 1 was preceded by two vigorous
Assyrian rulers, Adad - nirari III (911-890 B.C.) and
Tukulti-Ninip II (890-885 B.C.). The former had raided
North Syria and apparently penetrated as far as the Mediterranean coast. In consequence he came into con
flict with Babylonia, but he ultimately formed an alliance
with that kingdom. His son, Tukulti-Ninip, operated in
southern Mesopotamia, and apparently captured Sippar. In the north he had to drive back invading bands of
the Muski. Although, like his father, he carried out
great works at Asshur, he appears to have transferred his
Court to Nineveh, a sure indication that Assyria was once
again becoming powerful in northern Mesopotamia and the regions towards Armenia.
Ashur-natsir-pal III, son of Tukulti-Ninip II, inaugurated a veritable reign of terror in Mesopotamia and northern Syria. His methods of dealing with revolting
tribes were of a most savage character. Chiefs were
skinned alive, and when he sacked their cities, not only
fighting -men but women and children were either

slaughtered or burned at the stake. It is not surprising
to find therefore that, on more than one occasion, the kings of petty States made submission to him without resistance as soon as he invaded their domains.
In his first year he overran the mountainous district
between Lake Van and the upper sources of the Tigris.
Bubu, the rebel son of the governor of Nishtun, who had
been taken prisoner, was transported to Arbela, where he was skinned alive. Like his father, Ashur-natsir - pal
fought against the Muski, whose power was declining.
Then he turned southward from the borders of Asia Minor and dealt with a rebellion in northern Meso
potamia.
An Aramaean pretender named Akhiababa had estab
lished himself at Suru in the region to the east of the
Euphrates, enclosed by its tributaries the Khabar and the
Balikh. He had come from the neighbouring Aramaean
State of Bit-Adini, and was preparing, it would appear,
to form a powerful confederacy against the Assyrians.
When Ashur-natsir-pal approached Suru, a part of its
population welcomed him. He entered the city, seized
the pretender and many of his followers. These he dis
posed of with characteristic barbarity. Some were skinned
alive and some impaled on stakes, while others were enclosed in a pillar which the king had erected to remind the Aramaeans of his determination to brook no opposition. Akhiababa the pretender was sent to Nineveh with
a few supporters; and when they had been flayed their skins were nailed upon the city walls.
Another revolt broke out in the Kirkhi district be
tween the upper reaches of the Tigris and the south
western shores of Lake Van. It was promoted by the
Nairi tribes, and even supported by some Assyrian officials. Terrible reprisals were meted out to the rebels.



398 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
When the city of Kinabu was captured, no fewer than
3000 prisoners were burned alive, the unfaithful governor
being flayed. The city of Damdamusa was set on fire. Then Tela was attacked. Ashur-natsir-pars own account
of the operations runs as follows:
The city (of Tello) was very strong ; three walls surrounded
it. The inhabitants trusted to their strong walls and numerous soldiers; they did not come down or embrace my feet. With
battle and slaughter I assaulted and took the city. Three thousand
warriors I slew in battle. Their booty and possessions, cattle,
sheep, I carried away; many captives I burned with fire. Many of their soldiers I took alive; of some I cut off* hands and limbs;
of others the noses, ears, and arms; of many soldiers I put out the eyes. I reared a column of the living and a column of heads. I
hung on high their heads on trees in the vicinity of their city. Their boys and girls I burned up in flames. I devastated the city,
dug it up, in fire burned it; I annihilated it. 1
The Assyrian war-lord afterwards forced several Nairi
kings to acknowledge him as their overlord. He was
so greatly feared by the Syro-Cappadocian Hittites that when he approached their territory they sent him tribute,
yielding without a struggle. For several years the great conqueror engaged himself in thus subduing rebellious tribes and extending his terri
tory. His military headquarters were at Kalkhi, to which city the Court had been transferred. Thither he drafted
thousands of prisoners, the great majority of whom he
incorporated in the Assyrian army. Assyrian colonies were established in various districts for strategical pur
poses, and officials supplanted the petty kings in certain of the northern city States.
The Aramaeans of Mesopotamia gave much trouble
to Ashur-natsir-pal. Although he had laid a heavy hand

HEBREWS IN ASSYRIAN HISTORY 399
on Sum, the southern tribes, the Sukhi, stirred up revolts
in Mesopotamia as the allies of the Babylonians. On one
occasion Ashur-natsir-pal swept southward through this region, and attacked a combined force of Sukhi Aramaeans
and Babylonians. The Babylonians were commanded by
Zabdanu, brother of Nabu-aplu-iddin, king of Babylonia, who was evidently anxious to regain control of the western
trade route. The Assyrian war-lord, however, proved to
be too powerful a rival. He achieved so complete a
victory that he captured the Babylonian general and 3000 of his followers. The people of Kashshi (Babylonia) and Kaldu (Chaldaea) were "stricken with terror'', and had to
agree to pay increased tribute.
Ashur-natsir-pal reigned for about a quarter of a century, but his wars occupied less than half of that
period. Having accumulated great booty, he engaged himself, as soon as peace was secured throughout his
empire, in rebuilding the city of Kalkhi, where he erected
a great palace and made records of his achievements. He
also extended and redecorated the royal palace at Nineveh, and devoted much attention to the temples.
Tribute poured in from the subject States. The mountain and valley tribes in the north furnished in
abundance wine and corn, sheep and cattle and horses, and from the Aramaeans of Mesopotamia and the Syro
Cappadocian Hittites came much silver and gold, copper
and lead, jewels and ivory, as well as richly decorated furniture, armour and weapons. Artists and artisans
were also provided by the vassals of Assyria. There are
traces of Phoenician influence in the art of this period.
Ashur-natsir-paPs great palace at Kalkhi was excavated
by Layard, who has given a vivid description of the verdant plain on which the ancient city was situated, as it appeared
ih spring. "Its pasture lands, known as the c
jaif', are

renowned ", he wrote, " for their rich and luxuriant
herbage. In times of quiet, the studs of the Pasha and
of the Turkish authorities, with the horses of the cavalry
and of the inhabitants of Mosul, are sent here to graze. . . . Flowers of every hue enamelled the meadows; not
thinly scattered over the grass as in northern climes, but
in such thick and gathering clusters that the whole plain
seemed a patchwork of many colours. The dogs, as they returned from hunting, issued from the long grass dyed
red, yellow, or blue, according to the flowers through which they had last forced their way. ... In the evening,
after the labour of the day, I often sat at the door of my
tent, giving myself up to the full enjoyment of that calm and repose which are imparted to the senses by such
scenes as these. ... As the sun went down behind the
low hills which separate the river from the desert even
their rocky sides had struggled to emulate the verdant
clothing of the plain its receding rays were gradually withdrawn, like a transparent veil of light from the landscape. Over the pure cloudless sky was the glow of the
last light. In the distance and beyond the Zab, Keshaf, another venerable ruin, rose indistinctly into the evening
mist. Still more distant, and still more indistinct, was a
solitary hill overlooking the ancient city of Arbela. The Kurdish mountains, whose snowy summits cherished the
dying sunbeams, yet struggled with the twilight. The bleating of sheep and lowing of cattle, at first faint, became louder as the flocks returned from their pastures and
wandered amongst the tents. Girls hurried over the
greensward to seek their fathers' cattle, or crouched down to milk those which had returned alone to their wellremembered folds. Some were coming rrom the river

carriage, were carrying the heavy loads of long grass which they had cut in the meadows/' 1
Across the meadows so beautiful in March the great
armies of Ashur-natsir-pal returned with the booty of
great campaigns horses and cattle and sheep, bales of
embroidered cloth, ivory and jewels, silver and gold, the
products of many countries; while thousands of prisoners were assembled there to rear stately buildings which ulti
mately fell into decay and were buried by drifting sands.
Layard excavated the emperor's palace and dispatched to London, among other treasures of antiquity, the sublime
winged human-headed lions which guarded the entrance,
and many bas reliefs.
The Assyrian sculptures of this period lack the tech
nical skill, the delicacy and imagination of Sumerian and
Akkadian art, but they are full of energy, dignified and massive, and strong and lifelike. They reflect the spirit
of Assyria's greatness, which, however, had a materialistic
basis. Assyrian art found expression in delineating the
outward form rather than in striving to create a " thing
of beauty" which is "a joy for ever".
When Ashur-natsir-pal died, he was succeeded by his son Shalmaneser 111 (860-825 B.C.), whose military activi
ties extended over his whole reign. No fewer than thirty
two expeditions were recorded on his famous black obelisk.
As Shalmaneser was the first Assyrian king who came
into direct touch with the Hebrews, it will be of interest
here to review the history of the divided kingdoms of
Israel and Judah, as recorded in the Bible, because of the
light it throws on international politics and the situation which confronted Shalmaneser in Mesopotamia and Syria
in the early part of his reign. After Solomon died, the kingdom of his son Rehoboam
1 Discoveries at Nine<ueh> Sir A. H. Layard (London, 1856), pp. 55, 56.



402 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
was restricted to Judah, Benjamin, Moab, and Edom.
The " ten tribes " of Israel had revolted and were ruled
over by Jeroboam, whose capital was at Tirzah. 1 "There were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually."
2
The religious organization which had united the Hebrews under David and Solomon was thus broken up.
Jeroboam established the religion of the Canaanites and
made a gods and molten images". He was condemned
for his idolatry by the prophet Ahijah, who declared,
"The Lord shall smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the
water; and he shall root up Israel out of this good land,
which he gave to their fathers, and shall scatter them
beyond the river, because they have made their groves,
provoking the Lord to anger. And he shall give Israel
up because of the sins of Jeroboam, who did sin, and
who made Israel to sin." 3
In Judah Rehoboam similarly "did evil in the sight
of the Lord"; his subjects "also built them high places
and images and groves, on every high hill, and under every green tree ".* After the raid of the Egyptian
Pharaoh Shishak (Sheshonk) Rehoboam repented, how
ever. "And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the Lord turned from him, that he would not destroy him
altogether: and also in Judah things went well." 5
Rehoboam was succeeded by his son Abijah, who shat
tered the power of Jeroboam, defeating that monarch in battle after he was surrounded as Rameses II had been
by the Hittite army. " The children of Israel fled before
Judah : and God delivered them into their hand. And
Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter:
so there fell down slain in Israel five hundred thousand

chosen men. Thus the children of Israel were brought
under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed,
because they relied upon the Lord God of their fathers.
And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Bethel with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the
towns thereof, and Ephraim with the towns thereof.
Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah, and the Lord struck him and he died." 1
Ere Jeroboam died, however, " Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David : and
Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land
was quiet ten years. And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the Lord his God. For he took
away the altars of the strange gods, and the high places,
and brake down the images, and cut down the groves.
And commanded Judah to seek the Lord God of their fathers and to do the law and the commandment. Also
he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places
and the images : and the kingdom was quiet before him.
And he built fenced cities in Judah : for the land had
rest, and he had no war in those years; because the Lord
had given him rest/' 2
Jeroboam died in the second year of Asa's reign, and
was succeeded by his son Nadab, who " did evil in the
sight of the Lord, and walked in the way of his father,
and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin ". 3 Nadab
waged war against the Philistines, and was besieging Gibbethon when Baasha revolted and slew him. Thus ended
the First Dynasty of the Kingdom of Israel.
Baasha was declared king, and proceeded to operate
against Judah. Having successfully waged war against Asa, he proceeded to fortify Ramah, a few miles to the

4o4 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
north of Jerusalem, " that he might not suffer any to go
out or come in to Asa king of Judah".1
Now Israel was at this time one of the allies of the
powerful Aramaean State of Damascus, which had resisted the advance of the Assyrian armies during the reign of
Ashur-natsir-pal I, and apparently supported the rebellions of the northern Mesopotamia!! kings. Judah was nominally subject to Egypt, which, however, was weakened by internal troubles, and therefore unable either to assert
its authority in Judah or help its king to resist the advance
of the Israelites.
In the hour of peril Judah sought the aid of the king
of Damascus. " Asa took all the silver and the gold that
were left in the treasures of the house of the Lord, and
the treasures of the king's house, and delivered them into
the hand of his servants: and King Asa sent them to
Ben-hadad, the son of Tabrimon, the son of Hezion,
king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying, There is
a league between me and thee, and between my father
and thy father : behold, I have sent unto thee a present
of silver and gold : come and break thy league with Baasha
king of Israel, that he may depart from me".2
Ben-hadad accepted the invitation readily. He waged war against Israel, and Baasha was compelled to abandon
the building of the fortifications at Ramah. " Then king
Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah ; none was exempted : and they took away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha had builded ; and
king Asa built with them Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah." 3
Judah and Israel thus became subject to Damascus, and had to recognize the king of that city as arbiter in
all their disputes.
After reigning about twenty-four years, Baasha of

Israel died in 886 B.C. and was succeeded by his son
Elah, who came to the throne "in the twenty and sixth
year of Asa ". He had ruled a little over a year when he
was murdered by " his servant Zimri, captain of half his chariots ", while he was "drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza steward of his house in Tirzah".1 Thus
ended the Second Dynasty of the Kingdom of Israel.
Zimri's revolt was shortlived. He reigned only
" seven days in Tirzah ". The army was " encamped
against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines.
And the people that were encamped heard say, Zimri hath
conspired and hath also slain the king ; wherefore all
Israel made Omri, the captain of the host, king over
Israel that day in the camp. And Omri went up from
Gibbethon and all Israel with him, and they besieged
Tirzah. And it came to pass when Zimri saw that the
city was taken, that he went into the palace of the king's house, and burnt the king's house over him with fire, and
died." 2
Omri's claim to the throne was disputed by a rival
named Tibni. " But the people that followed Omri
prevailed against the people that followed Tibni, son of Ginath : so Tibni died, and Omri reigned." 3 Omri was the builder of Samaria, whither his Court was transferred from Tirzah towards the close of his
six years reign. He was followed by his son Ahab, who ascended the throne "in the thirty and eighth year of Asa
king of Judah . . . And Ahab . . . did evil in the sight of the Lord above all that were before him." So notorious indeed were father and son that the prophet
Micah declared to the backsliders of his day, " For the

Ahab was evidently an ally of Sidon as well as a
vassal of Damascus, for he married the notorious princess
Jezebel, the daughter of the king of that city State. He also became a worshipper of the Phoenician god Baal, to
whom a temple had been erected in Samaria. "And Ahab made a grove; and Ahab did more to provoke the Lord
God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that
were before him." 2 Obadiah, who "feared the Lord
greatly", was the governor of Ahab's house, but the
outspoken prophet Elijah, whose arch enemy was the notorious Queen Jezebel, was an outcast like the hundred prophets concealed by Obadiah in two mountain caves.3
Ahab became so powerful a king that Ben-hadad II of Damascus picked a quarrel with him, and marched against Samaria. It was on this occasion that Ahab sent
the famous message to Ben-hadad : " Let not him that girdeth on his harness (armour) boast himself as he
that putteth it off". The Israelites issued forth from
Samaria and scattered the attacking force. "And Israel
pursued them: and Ben-hadad the king of Syria escaped
on a horse with the horseman. And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and chariots, and slew
the Syrians with a great slaughter." Ben-hadad was made to believe afterwards by his counsellors that he
owed his defeat to the fact that the gods of Israel were
"gods of the hills; therefore they are stronger than we".
They added : " Let us fight against them in the plain,
and surely we shall be stronger than they". In the
following year Ben-hadad fought against the Israelites

HEBREWS IN ASSYRIAN HISTORY 407
at Aphek, but was again defeated. He then found it
necessary to make " a covenant " with Ahab. 1
In 854 B.C. Shalmaneser III of Assyria was engaged
in military operations against the Aramaean Syrians. Two years previously he had broken the power of Akhuni, king of Bit-Adini in northern Mesopotamia, the leader
of a strong confederacy of petty States. Thereafter the Assyrian monarch turned towards the south-west and
attacked the Hittite State of Hamath and the Aramaean
State of Damascus. The various rival kingdoms of Syria
united against him, and an army of 70,000 allies
attempted to thwart his progress at Qarqar on the Orontes. Although Shalmaneser claimed a victory on
this occasion, it was of no great advantage to him, for he was unable to follow it up. Among the Syrian allies
were Bir-idri (Ben-hadad II) of Damascus, and Ahab of
Israel ( Akhabbu of the land of the Sir'ilites"). The latter had a force of 10,000 men under his command.
Four years after Ahab began to reign, Asa died at
Jerusalem and his son Jehoshaphat was proclaimed king
of Judah. "And he walked in all the ways of Asa his
father ; he turned not aside from it, doing that which
was right in the eyes of the Lord : nevertheless the high
places were not taken away ; for the people offered and
burnt incense yet in the high places/'
2
There is no record of any wars between Israel and
Judah during this period, but it is evident that the two
kingdoms had been drawn together and that Israel was
the predominating power. Jehoshaphat "joined affinity
with Ahab", and some years afterwards visited Samaria, where he was hospitably entertained.3 The two monarchs
plotted together. Apparently Israel and Judah desired
1 / Kings, xx. 2 Ibid.) xxii, 43. 8 2 Chronicles^ xviii, 1-2.



4o8 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
to throw off the yoke of Damascus, which was being kept
constantly on the defence by Assyria. It is recorded in the Bible that they joined forces and set out on an
expedition to attack Ramoth in Gilead, which Israel claimed, and take it "out of the hand of the king of
Syria ".* In the battle which ensued (in 853 B.C.) Ahab was mortally wounded, "and about the time of the sun
going down he died". He was succeeded by his son
Ahaziah, who acknowledged the suzerainty of Damascus. After a reign of two years Ahaziah was succeeded by
Joram. Jehoshaphat did not again come into conflict with
Damascus. He devoted himself to the development of
his kingdom, and attempted to revive the sea trade on the Persian gulf which had flourished under Solomon.
" He made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold ; but they went not ; for the ships were broken (wrecked)
at Ezion-geber." Ahaziah offered him sailors probably
Phoenicians but they were refused.2 Apparently Jehosha
phat had close trading relations with the Chaldaeans, who
were encroaching on the territory of the king of Babylon, and menacing the power of that monarch. Jehoram
succeeded Jehoshaphat and reigned eight years. After repulsing the Syrian allies at Qarqar on the Orontes in 854 B.C., Shalmaneser III of Assyria found
it necessary to invade Babylonia. Soon after he came to the throne he had formed an alliance with Nabu-aplu
iddin of that kingdom, and was thus able to operate in
the north-west without fear of complications with the
rival claimant of Mesopotamia. When Nabu-aplu-iddin died, his two sons Marduk-zakir-shum and Marduk-bel
usate were rivals for the throne. The former, the
rightful heir, appealed for help to Shalmaneser, and that

monarch at once hastened to assert his authority in the
southern kingdom. In 851 B.C. Marduk-bel-usate, who was supported by an Aramaean army, was defeated and
put to death. Marduk-zakir-shum afterwards reigned over Baby
lonia as the vassal of Assyria, and Shalmaneser, his over
lord, made offerings to the gods at Babylon, Borsippa, and Cuthah. The Chaldaeans were afterwards subdued,
and compelled to pay annual tribute.
In the following year Shalmaneser had to lead an ex
pedition into northern Mesopotamia and suppress a fresh revolt in that troubled region. But the western allies
soon gathered strength again, and in 846 B.C. he found it necessary to return with a great army, but was not
successful in achieving any permanent success, although
he put his enemies to flight. The various western king
doms, including Damascus, Israel, and Tyre and Sidon,
remained unconquered, and continued to conspire against him.
The resisting power of the Syrian allies, however, was being greatly weakened by internal revolts, which may
have been stirred up by Assyrian emissaries. Edom
threw off the yoke of Judah and became independent.
Jehoram, who had married Athaliah, a royal princess of Israel, was dead. His son Ahaziah, who succeeded him,
joined forces with his cousin and overlord, King Joram
of Israel, to assist him in capturing Ramoth-gilead from the king of Damascus. Joram took possession of the
city, but was wounded, and returned to Jezreel to be
healed. 1 He was the last king of the Omri Dynasty of
Israel. The prophet Elisha sent a messenger to Jehu,
a military leader, who was at Ramoth-gilead, with a box
of oil and the ominous message, " Thus saith the Lord,

Jehu " conspired against Joram ", and then, accom
panied by an escort, " rode in a chariot and went to
Jezreel", so that he might be the first to announce the
revolt to the king whom he was to depose.
The watchman on the tower of Jezreel saw Jehu and
his company approaching and informed Joram, who twice
sent out a messenger to enquire, "Is it peace ?" Neither
messenger returned, and the watchman informed the
wounded monarch of Israel, " He came even unto them,
and cometh not again ; and the driving is like the
driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi ; for he driveth
furiously". King Joram went out himself to meet the famous charioteer, but turned to flee when he discovered that he came as an enemy. Then Jehu drew his bow and shot Joram through the heart. Ahaziah endeavoured to
conceal himself in Samaria, but was slain also. Jezebel was thrown down from a window of the royal harem and trodden under foot by the horsemen of Jehu; her body was devoured by dogs.

The Syrian king against whom Joram fought at
Ramoth-gilead was Hazael. He had murdered Ben

him with a thick cloth soaked in water. Then he had
himself proclaimed the ruler of the Aramaean State of
Damascus. The prophet Elisha had previously wept
before him, saying, " I know the evil that thou wilt do

unto the children of Israel; their strongholds wilt thou

women with child".1
The time seemed ripe for Assyrian conquest. In 843 B.C. Shalmaneser III crossed the Euphrates into
Syria for the sixteenth time. His first objective was
Aleppo, where he was welcomed. He made offerings
there to Hadad, the local Thor, and then suddenly marched southward. Hazael went out to oppose the
advancing Assyrians, and came into conflict with them
in the vicinity of Mount Hermon. " I fought with
him'*, Shalmaneser recorded, "and accomplished his defeat; I slew with the sword 1600 of his warriors and
captured 1121 chariots and 470 horses. He fled to
save his life."
Hazael took refuge within the walls of Damascus,
which the Assyrians besieged, but failed, however, to capture. Shalmaneser's soldiers meanwhile wasted and
burned cities without number, and carried away great
booty. a In those days", Shalmaneser recorded, "I received tribute from the Tyrians and Sidonians and from
Yaua (Jehu) son (successor) of Khumri (Omri)." The following is a translation from a bas relief by Professor
Pinches of a passage detailing Jehu's tribute:
The tribute of Yaua, son of Khumri : silver, gold, a golden
cup, golden vases, golden vessels, golden buckets, lead, a staff for the hand of the king (and) sceptres, I received.2
The scholarly translator adds, " It is noteworthy that the Assyrian form of the name, Yaua, shows that the
unpronounced aleph at the end was at that time sounded,

so that the Hebrews must have called him Yahua
(Jehua)". Shalmaneser did not again attack Damascus. His sphere of influence was therefore confined to North
Syria. He found it more profitable, indeed, to extend his territories into Asia Minor. For several years he engaged himself in securing control of the north-western caravan road, and did not rest until he had subdued
Cilicia and overrun the Hittite kingdoms of Tabal and Malatia. Hazael of Damascus avenged himself meanwhile on
his unfaithful allies who had so readily acknowledged the
shadowy suzerainty of Assyria. " In those days the Lord began to cut Israel short: and Hazael smote them
in all the coasts of Israel; from Jordan eastward, all the
land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan." 1 Israel thus came completely under the sway of Damascus. Jehu appears to have cherished the ambition of unit
ing Israel and Judah under one crown. His revolt received
the support of the orthodox Hebrews, and he began well
by inaugurating reforms in the northern kingdom with
purpose apparently to re-establish the worship of David's
God. He persecuted the prophets of Baal, but soon
became a backslider, for although he stamped out the
Phoenician religion he began to worship "the golden calves that were in Bethel and that were in Dan. . . .
He departed not from the sins of Jeroboam, which made
Israel to sin/' 2 Apparently he found it necessary to
secure the support of the idolaters of the ancient cult
of the "Queen of Heaven ". The crown of Judah had been seized by the Israelitish

Queen mother Athaliah after the death of her son Ahaziah at the hands of Jehu.1 She endeavoured to destroy "all the seed royal of the house of Judah". But
another woman thwarted the completion of her monstrous
design. This was Jehoshabeath, sister of Ahaziah and
wife of the priest Jehoiada, who concealed the young
prince Joash "and put him and his nurse in a bedchamber", in "the house of God". There Joash was
strictly guarded for six years.
2
In time Jehoiada stirred up a revolt against the Baal
worshipping queen of Judah. Having secured the sup
port of the captains of the royal guard and a portion of the army, he brought out from the temple the seven
years old prince Joash, " the king's son, and put upon him the crown, and gave him the testimony, and made
him king. And Jehoiada and his sons anointed him,
and said, God save the king.
" Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the people
running and praising the king, she came to the people into the house of the Lord : and she looked, and, behold
the king stood at his pillar at the entering in, and the
princes and the trumpets by the king : and all the people of the land rejoiced, and sounded with trumpets, also the singers with instruments of musick, and such as taught
to sing praise. Then Athaliah rent her clothes, and said, Treason, Treason.
"Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds that were set over the host, and said unto
them, Have her forth of the ranges : and whoso followeth
her, let him be slain by the sword. For the priest said,
Slay her not in the house of the Lord. So they laid
hands on her ; and when she was come to the entering
of the horse gate by the king's house, they slew her there.

4 i4 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
" And Jehoiada made a covenant between him, and
between all the people, and between the king, that they should be the Lord's people. Then all the people went to the house of Baal, and brake it down, and brake his
altars and his images in pieces, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.'* 1
When Jehu of Israel died, he was succeeded by
Jehoahaz. u The Lord was kindled against Israel, and he delivered them into the hand of Ben-hadad the son
of Hazael all their days." Then Jehoahaz repented.
He " besought the Lord, and the Lord hearkened unto him: for he saw the oppression of Israel, because the
king of Syria oppressed them. And the Lord gave Israel a saviour, so that they went out from under the
hands of the Syrians."
2 The "saviour", as will be shown, was Assyria. Not only Israel, but Judah, under King Joash, Edom, the Philistines and the Ammonites were
compelled to acknowledge the suzerainty of Damascus. Shalmaneser III swayed an extensive and powerful
empire, and kept his generals continually employed suppressing revolts on his frontiers. After he subdued the
Hittites, Kati, king of Tabal, sent him his daughter, who was received into the royal harem. Tribes of the Medes came under his power : the Nairi and Urartian
tribes continued battling with his soldiers on his northern
borders like the frontier tribes of India against the British
troops. The kingdom of Urartu was growing more and
more powerful. In 829 B.C. the great empire was suddenly shaken to
its foundations by the outbreak of civil war. The party of rebellion was led by Shalmaneser's son Ashur-danin
apli, who evidently desired to supplant the crown prince
Shamshi-Adad. He was a popular hero and received
1 2 Chronicle^ xxiii, i 17.

HEBREWS IN ASSYRIAN HISTORY 415
the support of most of the important Assyrian cities, including Nineveh, Asshur, Arbela, Imgurbel, and Durbalat, as well as some of the dependencies. Shalmaneser
retained Kalkhi and the provinces of northern Mesopo
tamia, and it appears that the greater part of the army also remained loyal to him. After four years of civil war Shalmaneser died. His chosen heir, Shamshi-Adad VII, had to continue the
struggle for the throne for two more years.
When at length the new king had stamped out the last embers of revolt within the kingdom, he had to
undertake the reconquest of those provinces which in the
interval had thrown off their allegiance to Assyria. Urartu in the north had grown more aggressive, the
Syrians were openly defiant, the Medes were conducting
bold raids, and the Babylonians were plotting with the
Chaldaeans, Elamites, and Aramaeans to oppose the new ruler. Shamshi-Adad, however, proved to be as great a
general as his father. He subdued the Medes and the
Nairi tribes, burned many cities and collected enormous tribute, while thousands of prisoners were taken and
forced to serve the conqueror.
Having established his power in the north, Shamshi
Adad then turned attention to Babylonia. On his way
southward he subdued many villages. He fell upon the
first strong force of Babylonian allies at Dur-papsukal in Akkad, and achieved a great victory, killing 13,000 and
taking 3000 captives. Then the Babylonian king, Marduk-balatsu-ikbi, advanced to meet him with his mixed
force of Babylonians, Chaldaeans, Elamites, and Aramaeans, but was defeated in a fierce battle on the banks of the
Daban canal. The Babylonian camp was captured, and the prisoners taken by the Assyrians included 5000 footmen, 200 horsemen, and 100 chariots



4 i 6 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
Shamshi-Adad conducted in all five campaigns in
Babylonia and Chaldaea, which he completely subdued, penetrating as far as the shores of the Persian Gulf. In
the end he took prisoner the new king, Bau-akh-iddina,
the successor of Marduk-balatsu-ikbi, and transported him to Assyria, and offered up sacrifices as the overlord
of the ancient land at Babylon, Borsippa, and Cuthah.
For over half a century after this disaster Babylonia was
a province of Assyria. During that period, however, the influence which it exercised over the Assyrian Court was
so great that it contributed to the downfall of the royal
line of the Second Empire.

of Assyria's Middle Empire Dynasty.
ONE of the most interesting figures in Mesopotamian history came into prominence during the Assyrian Middle Empire period. This was the famous Sammu-rammat,
the Babylonian wife of an Assyrian ruler. Like Sargon of Akkad, Alexander the Great, and Dietrich von Bern, she made, by reason of her achievements and influence,
a deep impression on the popular imagination, and as these monarchs became identified in tradition with gods
of war and fertility, she had attached to her memory the
myths associated with the mother goddess of love and
battle who presided over the destinies of mankind. In
her character as the legendary Semiramis of Greek litera
ture, the Assyrian queen was reputed to have been the
417



4 i 8 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
daughter of Derceto, the dove and fish goddess of Askalon, and to have departed from earth in bird form. It is not quite certain whether Sammu-rammat was the wife of Shamshi-Adad VII or of his son, Adad-nirari IV. Before the former monarch reduced Babylonia to
the status of an Assyrian province, he had signed a treaty of peace with its king, and it is suggested that it was
confirmed by a matrimonial alliance. This treaty was
repudiated by King Bau-akh-iddina, who was transported with his palace treasures to Assyria.
As Sammu-rammat was evidently a royal princess of Babylonia, it seems probable that her marriage was arranged with purpose to legitimatize the succession of the
Assyrian overlords to the Babylonian throne. The principle of "mother right" was ever popular in those countries where the worship of the Great Mother was perpetuated
if not in official at any rate in domestic religion. Not a few Egyptian Pharaohs reigned as husbands or as sons of royal ladies. Succession by the female line was also
observed among the Hittites. When Hattusil II gave
his daughter in marriage to Putakhi, king of the Amorites,
he inserted a clause in the treaty of alliance " to the effect
that the sovereignty over the Amorite should belong to the son and descendants of his daughter for evermore".1
As queen or queen-mother, Sammu-rammat occupied
as prominent a position in Assyria as did Queen Tiy of Egypt during the lifetime of her husband, Amenhotep III,
and the early part of the reign of her son, Amenhotep IV
(Akhenaton). The Tell-el-Amarna letters testify to Tiy's
influence in the Egyptian "Foreign Office", and we know
that at home she was joint ruler with her husband and
took part with him in public ceremonials. During their
reign a temple was erected to the mother goddess Mut,
1 The Land of the Hitiites, J. Garstang, p. 354.



THE AGE OF SEMIRAMIS 419
and beside it was formed a great lake on which sailed
the "barque of Aton " in connection with mysterious
religious ceremonials. After Akhenaton's religious revolt
was inaugurated, the worship of MuL was discontinued and Tiy went into retirement. In Akhenaton's time the
vulture symbol of the goddess Mut did not appear above
the sculptured figures of royalty.
What connection the god Aton had with Mut during
the period of the Tiy regime remains obscure. There is
no evidence that Aton was first exalted as the son of the
Great Mother goddess, although this is not improbable.
Queen Sammu-rammat of Assyria, like Tiy of Egypt,
is associated with social and religious innovations. She
was the first, and, indeed, the only Assyrian royal lady, to be referred to on equal terms with her royal husband
in official inscriptions. In a dedication to the god Nebo,
that deity is reputed to be the protector of " the life of
Adad-nirari, king of the land of Ashur, his lord, and the life of Sammu-rammat, she of the palace, his lady".1 During the reign of Adad-nirari IV the Assyrian Court
radiated Babylonian culture and traditions. The king not
only recorded his descent from the first Shalmaneser, but
also claimed to be a descendant of Bel-kap-kapu, an earlier,
but, to us, unknown, Babylonian monarch than <c Sulili ",
i.e. Sumu-la-ilu, the great-great-grandfather of Hammurabi. Bel-kap-kapu was reputed to have been an over
lord of Assyria. Apparently Adad-nirari desired to be regarded as the
legitimate heir to the thrones of Assyria and Babylonia. His claim upon the latter country must have had a sub
stantial basis. It is not too much to assume that he was
a son of a princess of its ancient royal family. Sammu

Babylonia, T. G. Pinches, p. 343.



420 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
rammat may therefore have been his mother. She could
have been called his " wife " in the mythological sense,
the king having become " husband of his mother ". If
such was the case, the royal pair probably posed as the
high priest and high priestess of the ancient goddess cult
the incarnations of the Great Mother and the son who
displaced his sire. The worship of the Great Mother was the popular
religion of the indigenous peoples of western Asia, including parts of Asia Minor, Egypt, and southern and
western Europe. It appears to have been closely asso
ciated with agricultural rites practised among representative communities of the Mediterranean race. In Babylonia
and Assyria the peoples of the goddess cult fused with
the peoples of the god cult, but the prominence main
tained by Ishtar, who absorbed many of the old mother
deities, testifies to the persistence of immemorial habits
of thought and antique religious ceremonials among the
descendants of the earliest settlers in the Tigro-Euphrates
valley. Merodach's spouse Zerpanitum was not a shadowy
deity but a goddess who exercised as much influence as
her divine husband. As Aruru she took part with him in the creation of mankind. In Asia Minor the mother
goddess was overshadowed by the father god during the
period of Hatti predominance, but her worship was revived after the early people along the coast and in the agricultural valleys were freed from the yoke of the father-god
worshippers. It must be recognized, in this connection, that an official religion was not always a full reflection of popular
beliefs. In all the great civilizations of antiquity it was
invariably a compromise between the beliefs of the military
aristocracy and the masses of mingled peoples over whom they held sway. Temple worship had therefore a political



THE AGE OF SEM1RAMIS 421
aspect; it was intended, among other things, to strengthen the position of the ruling classes. But ancient deities
could still be worshipped, and were worshipped, in homes
and fields, in groves and on mountain tops, as the case
might be. Jeremiah has testified to the persistence of the folk practices in connection with the worship of the
mother goddess among the inhabitants of Palestine.
Sacrificial fires were lit and cakes were baked and offered
to the "Queen of Heaven" in the streets of Jerusalem
and other cities. In Babylonia and Egypt domestic
religious practices were never completely supplanted by temple ceremonies in which rulers took a prominent part.
It was always possible, therefore, for usurpers to make
popular appeal by reviving ancient and persistent forms of
worship. As we have seen, Jehu of Israel, after stamping out Phoenician Baal worship, secured a strong following
by giving official recognition to the cult of the golden
calf.
It is not possible to set forth in detail, or with intimate
knowledge, the various innovations which Sammu-rammat
introduced, or with which she was credited, during the reigns of Adad-nirari IV (810-782 B.C.) and his father.
No discovery has been made of documents like the Tell-el-Amarna "letters 7
*, which would shed light on
the social and political life of this interesting period. But evidence is not awanting that Assyria was being suffused
with Babylonian culture. Royal inscriptions record the triumphs of the army, but suppress the details of bar
barities such as those which sully the annals of Ashur
natsir-pal, who had boys and girls burned on pyres and
the heroes of small nations flayed alive. An ethical
tendency becomes apparent in the exaltation of the Baby
lonian Shamash as an abstract deity who loved law and order, inspired the king with wisdom and ordained the



422 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
destinies of mankind. He is invoked on equal terms with Ashur.
The prominence given to Nebo, the god of Borsippa,
during the reign of Adad-nirari IV is highly significant.
He appears in his later character as a god of culture and
wisdom, the patron of scribes and artists, and the wise
counsellor of the deities. He symbolized the intellectual
life of the southern kingdom, which was more closely
associated with religious ethics than that of war-loving
Assyria.
A great temple was erected to Nebo at Kalkhi, and four statues of him were placed within it, two of which
are now in the British Museum. On one of these was cut
the inscription, from which we have quoted, lauding the exalted and wise deity and invoking him to protect Adad-
nirari and the lady of the palace, Sammu-rammat, and
closing with the exhortation, " Whoso cometh in after time, let him trust in Nebo and trust in no other god ".
The priests of Ashur in the city of Asshur must have
been as deeply stirred by this religious revolt at Kalkhi as
were the priests of Amon when Akhenaton turned his back on Thebes and the national god to worship Aton in his new capital at Tell-el-Amarna.
It would appear that this sudden stream of Babylonian
culture had begun to flow into Assyria as early as the reign of Shalmaneser III, and it may be that it was on account of that monarch's pro-Babylonian tendencies that
his nobles and priests revolted against him. Shalmaneser
established at Kalkhi a royal library which was stocked
with the literature of the southern kingdom. During
the reign of Adad-nirari IV this collection was greatly
increased, and subsequent additions were made to it by
his successors, and especially Ashur-nirari IV, the last monarch of the Middle Empire. The inscriptions of

Shamshi-Adad, son of Shalmaneser III, have literary
qualities which distinguish them from those of his predecessors, and may be accounted for by the influence
exercised by Babylonian scholars who migrated northward.
To the reign of Adad-nirari belongs also that impor
tant compilation the " Synchronistic History of Assyria and Babylonia ", which deals with the relations of the two
kingdoms and refers to contemporary events and rulers.
The legends of Semiramis indicate that Sammu-rammat
was associated like Queen Tiy with the revival of mother
worship. As we have said, she went down to tradition
as the daughter of the fish goddess, Derceto. Pliny
identified that deity with Atargatis of Hierapolis.
1
In Babylonia the fish goddess was Nina, a developed
form of Damklna, spouse of Ea of Eridu. In the in
scription on the Nebo statue, that god is referred to as
the "son of Nudimmud" (Ea). Nina was the goddess
who gave her name to Nineveh, and it is possible that Nebo may have been regarded as her son during the Semiramis period.
The story of Semiramis's birth is evidently of great
antiquity. It seems to survive throughout Europe in the
nursery tale of the " Babes in the Wood ". A striking
Indian parallel is afforded by the legend of Shakuntala, which may be first referred to for the purpose of com
parative study. Shakuntala was the daughter of the rishi,
Viswamitra, and Menaka, the Apsara (celestial fairy). Menaka gave birth to her child beside the sacred river
Malini. " And she cast the new-born infant on the bank
of that river and went away. And beholding the new
born infant lying in that forest destitute of human beings
but abounding with lions and tigers, a number of vultures
sat around to protect it from harm/' A sage discovered
1 Nat. Hht.y v, 19 and Straho, xvi, 1-27.



42 4 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
the child and adopted her. " Because ", he said, " she was surrounded by Shakuntas (birds), therefore hath she
been named by me Shakuntala (bird protected)." 1 Semiramis was similarly deserted at birth by her
Celestial mother. She was protected by doves, and her
Assyrian name, Sammu-rammat, is believed to be derived
from "Summat" "dove", and to signify "the dove
goddess loveth her". Simmas, the chief of royal shepherds, found the child and adopted her. She was of great
beauty like Shakuntala, the maiden of "perfect symmetry",
"sweet smiles ", and "faultless features", with whom King
Dushyanta fell in love and married in Gandharva fashion. 2 Semiramis became the wife of Onnes, governor of
Nineveh, and one of the generals of its alleged founder, King Ninus. She accompanied her husband to Bactria
on a military campaign, and is said to have instructed the
king how that city should be taken. Ninus fell in love
with Semiramis, and Onnes, who refused to give her up,
went and hanged himself. The fair courtesan then became the wife of the king.
The story proceeds that Semiramis exercised so great
an influence over the impressionable King Ninus, that she
persuaded him to proclaim her Queen of Assyria for five days. She then ascended the throne decked in royal
robes. On the first day she gave a great banquet, and on
the second thrust Ninus into prison, or had him put to
death. In this manner she secured the empire for herself.
She reigned for over forty years. Professor Frazer inclines to the view that the legend
is a reminiscence of the custom of appointing a mock king
and queen to whom the kingdom was yielded up for five

days. Semiramis played the part of the mother goddess, and the priestly king died a violent death in the character
of her divihe lover. " The mounds of Semiramis which were pointed out all over Western Asia were sid to have
been the graves of her lovers whom she buried alive. . . .
This tradition is one of the surest indications of the
identity of the mythical Semiramis with the Babylonian goddess Ishtar or Astarte." 1 As we have seen, Ishtar
and other mother goddesses had many lovers whom they
deserted like La Belle Dame sans Merci (pp. 1745).
As Queen of Assyria, Semiramis was said to have cut
roads through mountainous districts and erected many
buildings. According to one version of the legend she founded the city of Babylon. Herodotus, however, says in this connection: "Semiramis held the throne for five
generations before the later princess (Nitocris). . . . She raised certain embankments, well worthy of inspection, in
the plain near Babylon, to control the river (Euphrates), which, till then, used to overflow and flood the whole
country round about/' 2 Lucian, who associates the
famous queen with " mighty works in Asia ", states that
she was reputed by some to be the builder of the ancient
temple of Aphrodite in the Libanus, although others credited it to Cinyras, or Deukalion. 3 Several Median
places bear her name, and according to ancient Armenian tradition she was the founder of Van, which was formerly
called " Shamiramagerd ". Strabo tells that unidentified mountains in Western Asia were named after Semiramis.4
Indeed, many of the great works in the Tigro-Euphrates valley,' not excepting the famous inscription of Darius, were credited to the legendary queen of Babylonia and
1 The Golden Bough (The Scapegoat), pp. 369 et scq. (jrd edition). Perhaps the mythic Semiramis and legends connected were in existence long before the historic Sammu-rammat, though the two got mixed up. * Herodotus, i, 184. * D< dea Syria, 9-14. * Strabo^ xvi, I, 3,

Assyria.
1 She was the rival in tradition of the famous
Sesostris of Egypt as a ruler, builder, and conqueror. All the military expeditions of Semiramis were attended with success, except her invasion of India. She was
supposed to have been defeated in the Punjab. After
suffering this disaster she died, or abdicated the throne in
favour of her son Ninyas. The most archaic form of the
legend appears to be that she was turned into a dove and took flight to heaven in that form. After her death
she was worshipped as a dove goddess like " Our Lady
of Trees and Doves " in Cyprus, whose shrine at old Paphos was founded, Herodotus says, by Phoenician
colonists from Askalon. 2 Fish and doves were sacred to Derceto (Attar),3 who had a mermaid form. " I have
beheld ", says Lucian, "the image of Derceto in Phoenicia.
A marvellous spectacle it is. One half is a woman, but
the part which extends from thighs to feet terminates
with the tail of a fish." 4 Derceto was supposed to have been a woman who
threw herself in despair into a lake. After death she
was adored as a goddess and her worshippers abstained
from eating fish, except sacrificially. A golden image of
a fish was suspended in her temple. Atargatis, who was identical with Derceto, was reputed in another form of
the legend to have been born of an egg which the sacred
fishes found in the Euphrates and thrust ashore (p. 28).
The Greek Aphrodite was born of the froth of the sea
and floated in a sea-shell. According to Hesiod,
The wafting waves First bore her to Cythera the divine:
To wave-encircled Cyprus came she then,
And forth emerged, a goddess, in the charms

The animals sacred to Aphrodite included the sparrow,

presided over the month of April, and the myrtle, rose, poppy, and apple were sacred to her.
Some writers connect Semiramis, in her character as a dove goddess, with Media and the old Persian mother
goddess Anaitis, and regard as arbitrary her identification
with the fish goddess Derceto or Atargatis. The dove
was certainly not a popular bird in the religious art of Babylonia and Assyria, but in one of the hymns translated
by Professor Pinches Ishtar says, " Like a lonely dove I rest". In another the worshipper tries to touch Ishtar's
heart by crying, "Like the dove I moan ". A Sumerian
psalmist makes a goddess (Gula, who presided over Larak, a part of Isin) lament over the city after it was
captured by the enemy :

" Fates ", however, thr wryneck may have been connected with the belief that the perpetrator of a murder, or a death spell, could be detected when he approached his victim's corpse. If there was no wound to "bleed afresh", the "death thraw" (the contortions of death) might indicate who the criminal was. In a Scottish ballad regarding a lady, who was murdered by her lover, the verse occurs :
'Twas in the middle o' the night
The cock began to craw; And at the middle o' the night The corpse began to thraw. (0642) 30

Beneath are turned to strangeness, above are turned to strangeness,
With wailings on the lyre my dwelling-place is surrendered to the stranger,
The dove cots they wickedly seized, the doves they entrapped . . . The ravens he (Enlil) caused to fly.

Apparently there were temple and household doves in
Babylonia. The Egyptians had their household dovecots in ancient as in modern times. Lane makes reference
to the large pigeon houses in many villages. They are
of archaic pattern, "with the walls slightly inclining in
wards (like many of the ancient Egyptian buildings) ",
and are " constructed upon the roofs of the huts with
crude brick, pottery, and mud. . . . Each pair of pigeons
occupies a separate (earthen) pot." 2 It may be that the dove bulked more prominently in domestic than in official
religion, and had a special seasonal significance. Ishtar appears to have had a dove form. In the Gilgamesh epic
she is said to have loved the "brilliant Allalu bird" (the
"bright-coloured wood pigeon", according to Sayce), and
to have afterwards wounded it by breaking its wings. 3 She also loved the lion and the horse, and must therefore have assumed the forms of these animals. The goddess
Bau, "she whose city is destroyed", laments in a Sumerian
psalm :
Like a dove to its dwelling-place, how long to my dwelling-place will they pursue me,
T my sanctuary . . . the sacred place they pursue me . . .
My resting place, the brick walls of my city Isin, thou art destroyed;
My sanctuary, shrine of my temple Galmah, thou art destroyed. Langdon*s translation.

5 Tammuz is referred to in a Sumerian psalm as " him of the dovelike voice, yea, dovelike". He may have had a dove form. Angus, the Celtic god of spring, love, and
fertility, had a swan form; he also had his seasonal period of sleep like Tammuz.



THE AGE OF SEMIRAMIS 429
Here the goddess appears to be identified with the doves
which rest on the walls and make their nests in the
shrine. The Sumerian poets did not adorn their poems
with meaningless picturesque imagery; their images were
stern facts; they had a magical or religious significance like the imagery of magical incantations; the worshipper invoked the deity by naming his or her various attributes,
forms, &c. Of special interest are the references in Sumerian
psalms to the ravens as well as the doves of goddesses.
Throughout Asia and Europe ravens are birds of ill omen.
In Scotland there still linger curious folk beliefs regarding
the appearance of ravens and doves after death. Michael
Scott, the great magician, when on his deathbed told his
friends to place his body on a hillock. " Three ravens
and three doves would be seen flying towards it. If the
ravens were first the body was to be burned, but if the
doves were first it was to receive Christian burial. The
ravens were foremost, but in their hurry flew beyond their
mark. So the devil, who had long been preparing a bed
for Michael, was disappointed.
"l
In Indian mythology Purusha, the chaos giant, first
divided himself. " Hence were husband and wife produced." This couple then assumed various animal forms and thus "created every living pair whatsoever
down to the ants". 2 Goddesses and fairies in the folk
tales of many countries sometimes assume bird forms.
The " Fates "
appear to Damayanti in the Nala story as
swans which carry love messages.3
According to Aryo-Indian belief, birds were " blessed
with fecundity". The Babylonian Etana eagle and the Egyptian vulture, as has been indicated, were deities of

430 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
fertility. Throughout Europe birds, which were "Fates",
mated, according to popular belief, on St. Valentine's Day
in February, when lots were drawn for wives by rural folks. Another form of the old custom is referred to by
the poet Gay :
Last Valentine, the day when birds of kind
Their paramours with mutual chirpings find,
I early rose . . .
Thee first I spied, and the first swain we see,
In spite of fortune, shall our true love be.
The dove appears to have been a sacred bird in
various areas occupied by tribes of the Mediterranean race. Models of a shrine found in two royal graves at
Mycenae are surmounted by a pair of doves, suggesting twin goddesses like Isis and Nepthys of Egypt and Ishtar and Belitsheri of Babylonia. Doves and snakes were
associated with the mother goddess of Crete, " typifying ",
according to one view, " her connection with air and
earth. Although her character was distinctly beneficent and pacific, yet as Lady of the Wild Creatures she had a more fearful aspect, one that was often depicted on carved
gems, where lions are her companions/' 1
Discussing the attributes and symbols of this mother goddess, Pro
fessor Burrows says : " As the serpent, coming from the
crevices of the earth, shows the possession of the tree
or pillar from the underworld, so the dove, with which
this goddess is also associated, shows its possession from
the world of the sky ".2 Professor Robertson Smith has demonstrated that the dove was of great sanctity
among the Semites. 3 It figures in Hittite sculptures and
was probably connected with the goddess cult in Asia
1 Crete, the Forerunner of Greece, C. H. and H. B. Hawes, p. 139. 8 The Discoveries in Crete, pp. 137-8. 8

Minor. Although Egypt had no dove goddess, the bird was addressed by lovers
I hear thy voice, O turtle dove
The dawn is all aglow
Weary am I with love, with love, Oh, whither shall I go? 1
Pigeons, as indicated, are in Egypt still regarded as sacred birds, and a few years ago British soldiers created a riot by shooting them. Doves were connected with the ancient Greek oracle at Dodona. In many countries the dove
is closely associated with love, and also symbolizes inno
cence, gentleness, and holiness.
The pigeon was anciently, it would appear, a sacred bird in these islands, and Brand has recorded curious
folk beliefs connected with it. In some districts the idea
prevailed that no person could die on a bed which con
tained pigeon feathers : " If anybody be sick and lye a
dying, if they lye upon pigeon feathers they will be languishing and never die, but be in pain and torment,"
wrote a correspondent. A similar superstition about the feathers of different varieties of wild fowl 2 obtained in
other districts. Brand traced this interesting traditional
belief in Yorkshire, Lancashire, Derbyshire, and some of the Welsh and Irish counties. 3 It still lingers in parts
of the Scottish Highlands. In the old ballad of "The
Bloody Gardener" the white dove appears to a young
man as the soul of his lady love who was murdered by
his mother. He first saw the bird perched on his breast
and then " sitting on a myrtle tree ".4
The dove was not only a symbol of Semiramis, but

432 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
also of her mother Derceto, the Phoenician fish goddess.
The connection between bird and fish may have been
given an astral significance. In " Poor Robin's Almanack "
for 1757 a St. Valentine rhyme begins:
This month bright Phoebus enters Pisces,
The maids will have good store of kisses, For always when the sun comes there,
Valentine's day is drawing near,
And both the men and maids incline To choose them each a Valentine.
As we have seen, the example was set by the mating
birds. The "Almanack*' poet no doubt versified an old
astrological belief: when the spring sun entered the sign of the Fishes, the love goddess in bird form returned to
earth.
Advocates of the Totemic theory, on the other hand, may hold that the association of doves with snake god
desses and fishLgoddesses of fertility was due to the fusion
of tribes who had various animal totems. "The Pelew
Islanders believed ", says Professor Frazer, " that the
souls of their forefathers lived in certain species of animals,
which accordingly they held sacred and would not injure.
For this reason one man would not kill snakes, another would not harm pigeons, and so on ; but everyone was
quite ready to kill and eat the sacred animals of his neigh
bours. J>1 That the Egyptians had similar customs is
suggested by what Herodotus tells us regarding their
sacred animals : " Those who live near Thebes and the
lake Mceris hold the crocodile in religious veneration.
. . . Those who live in or near Elephantine, so far from
considering these beasts as sacred, make them an article
of food. . . . The hippopotamus is esteemed sacred in the

THE AGE OF SEMIRAMIS 433
district of Papremis, but in no other part of Egypt. . . .
They roast and boil . . . birds and fishes . . . excepting
those which are preserved for sacred purposes." 1 Totemic
animals controlled the destinies of tribes and families.
" Grose tells us ", says Brand, " that, besides general notices of death, many families have particular warnings or notices: some by the appearance of a bird, and others
by the figure of a tall woman, dressed all in white. . . .
Pennant says that many of the great families in Scotland
had their demon or genius, who gave them monitions of future events/* 2 Members of tribes which venerated the
pigeon therefore invoked it like the Egyptian love poet and drew omens from its notes, or saw one appearing as
the soul of the dead like the lover in the ballad of " The
Bloody Gardener". They refrained also from killing the
pigeon except sacrificially, and suffered agonies on a death
bed which contained pigeon feathers, the " taboo "
having been broken.
Some such explanation is necessary to account for the
specialization of certain goddesses as fish, snake, cat, or
bird deities. Aphrodite, who like Ishtar absorbed the
attributes of several goddesses of fertility and fate, had
attached to her the various animal symbols which were
prominent in districts or among tribes brought into close
contact, while the poppy, rose, myrtle, &c., which were used as love charms, or for making love potions, were
also consecrated to her. Anthropomorphic deities were
decorated with the symbols and flowers of folk religion.
From the comparative evidence accumulated here, it
will be seen that the theory of the mythical Semiramis's Median or Persian origin is somewhat narrow. It is
possible that the dove was venerated in Cyprus, as it cer
tainly was in Crete, long centuries before Assyrian and
1 Herodotus^ ii, 69, 71, and 77. 2 Brand's Popular Antiquititsy vol. iii, p. 227.



434 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
Babylonian influence filtered westward through Phoenician
and Hittite channels. In another connection Sir Arthur Evans shows that the resemblance between Cretan and
early Semitic beliefs " points rather to some remote com
mon element, the nature of which is at present obscure, than to any definite borrowing by one side or another". 1
From the evidence afforded by the Semiramis legends
and the inscriptions of the latter half of the Assyrian
Middle Empire period, it may be inferred that a renas
cence of "mother worship" was favoured by the social
and political changes which were taking place. In the first place the influence of Babylon must have been
strongly felt in this connection. The fact that Adad
nirari found it necessary to win the support of the Babylonians by proclaiming his descent from one of their
ancient royal families, suggests that he was not only concerned about the attitude assumed by the scholars of the
southern kingdom, but also that of the masses of old
Sumerian and Akkadian stocks who continued to bake cakes to the Queen of Heaven so as to ensure good
harvests. In the second place it is not improbable that
even in Assyria the introduction of Nebo and his spouse
made widespread appeal. That country had become largely peopled by an alien population ; many of these aliens came from districts where <c mother worship
"
prevailed, and had no traditional respect for Ashur, while
they regarded with hostility the military aristocracy who conquered and ruled in the name of that dreaded deity.
Perhaps, too, the influence of the Aramaeans, who in Babylonia wrecked the temples of the sun god, tended to
revive the ancient religion of the Mediterranean race.
Jehu's religious revolt in Israel, which established once
again the cult of Ashtoreth, occurred after he came under
1 Cited by Profeiior Burrows in Tht Discoveries in Crifr, p. 134.



THE AGE OF SEMIRAMIS 435
the sway of Damascus, and may have not been unconnected with the political ascendancy elsewhere of the
goddess cult.
Nebo, whom Adad-nirari exalted at Kalkhi, was more
than a local god of Borsippa. "The most satisfactory
view ", says Jastrow, " is to regard him as a counterpart of Ea. Like Ea, he is the embodiment and source of wisdom. . . . The study of the heavens formed part of the wisdom which is traced back to Nebo, and the temple
school at Borsippa became one of the chief centres for the
astrological, and, subsequently, for the astronomical lore
of Babylonia. . . . Like Nebo, Ea is also associated with
the irrigation of the fields and with their consequent fer
tility. A hymn praises him as the one who fills the canals
and the dikes, who protects the fields and brings the crops to maturity." Nebo links with Merodach (Mar
duk), who is sometimes referred to as his father. Jastrow
assumes that the close partnership between Nebo and
Merodach " had as a consequence a transfer of some of
the father Marduk's attributes as a solar deity to Nebo,1 his
son, just as Ea passed his traits on to his son, Marduk".2
As the " recorder " or "scribe" among the gods,
Nebo resembles the Egyptian god Thoth, who links with Khonsu, the lunar and spring sun god of love and fer
tility, and with Osiris. In Borsippa he had, like Mero
dach in Babylon, pronounced Tammuz traits. Nebo, in
fact, appears to be the Tammuz of the new age, the son
of the ancient goddess, who became " Husband of his
Mother". If Nebo had no connection with Great
Mother worship, it is unlikely that his statue would have
1 Like the Egyptian Horus, Nebo had many phases: he was connected with the sun and moon, the planet Mercury, water and crops 5 he was young and yet old a mysticaJ god. 8 Atptcts of Religious Btlitf and Practice in Babylonia and Assyria, pp. 94 it seq.



436 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
borne an inscription referring to King Adad-nirari and
Queen Sammu-rammat on equal terms. The Assyrian
spouse of Nebo was called Tashmit. This "goddess of
supplication and love" had a lunar significance. A prayer addressed to her in association with Nannar (Sin) and
Ishtar, proceeds :
In the evil of the eclipse of the moon which . . . has taken place,
In the evil of the powers, of the portents, evil and not good, which
are in my palace and my land, (I) have turned towards thee! . . .
Before Nabu (Nebo) thy spouse, thy lord, the prince, the first-born
of E-sagila, intercede for me ! May he hearken to my cry at the word of thy mouth ; may he
remove my sighing, may he learn my supplication!
Damkina is similarly addressed in another prayer :
O Damkina, mighty queen of all the gods,
O wife of Ea, valiant art thou,
O Ir-nina, mighty queen of all the gods . . .
Thou that dwellest in the Abyss, O lady of heaven and earth! . . .
In the evil of the eclipse of the moon, etc.
Bau is also prayed in a similar connection as u mighty
lady that dwellest in the bright heavens ", i.e. " Queen of heaven". 1
Tashmit, whose name signifies a Obedience ", accord
ing to Jastrow, or " Hearing ", according to Sayce, carried
the prayers of worshippers to Nebo, her spouse. As Isis interceded with Osiris, she interceded with Nebo, on behalf of mankind. But this did not signify that she
was the least influential of the divine pair. A goddess
played many parts : she was at once mother, daughter, and wife of the god ; the servant of one god or the*
" mighty queen of all the gods ". The Great Mother
1 Babylonian Magic and Sorcery, L. W. King, pp. 6-7 and 26-7.



THE AGE OF SEMIRAMIS 437
was, as has been indicated, regarded as the eternal and
undecaying one ; the gods passed away, son succeeding father ; she alone remained. Thus, too, did Semiramis
survive in the popular memory, as the queen-goddess of
widespread legends, after kings and gods had been for
gotten. To her was ascribed all the mighty works of
other days in the lands where the indigenous peoples
first worshipped the Great Mother as Damkina, Nina, Bau, Ishtar, or Tashmit, because the goddess was anciently believed to be the First Cause, the creatrix, the mighty one
who invested the ruling god with the powers he possessed
the god who held sway because he was her husband,
as did Nergal as the husband of Eresh-ki-gal, queen of Hades.
The multiplication of well-defined goddesses was partly due to the tendency to symbolize the attributes of the
Great Mother, and partly due to the development of the great "Lady" in a particular district where she reflected local phenomena and where the political influence achieved
by her worshippers emphasized her greatness. Legends regarding a famous goddess were in time attached to other
goddesses, and in Aphrodite and Derceto we appear to
have mother deities who absorbed the traditions of more
than one local " lady
" of river and plain, forest and
mountain. Semiramis, on the other hand, survived as a link between the old world and the new, between the country from which emanated the stream of ancient cul
ture and the regions which received it. As the high
priestess of the cult, she became identified with the goddess whose bird name she bore, as Gilgamesh and Etana became
identified with the primitive culture-hero or patriarch of
the ancient Sumerians, and Sargon became identified with
Tammuz. No doubt the fame of Semiramis was specially
emphasized because of her close association, as Queen

Sammu-rammat, with the religious innovations which disturbed the land of the god Ashur during the Middle
Empire period. Adad-nirari IV, the son or husband of Sammu-rammat,
was a vigorous and successful campaigner. He was the
Assyrian king who became the "saviour" of Israel. Al
though it is not possible to give a detailed account of his
various expeditions, we find from the list of these which
survives in the Eponym Chronicle that he included in the
Assyrian Empire a larger extent of territory than any of his predecessors. In the north-east he overcame the
Median and other tribes, and acquired a large portion of
the Iranian plateau ; he compelled Edom to pay tribute, and established his hold in Babylonia by restricting the power of the Chaldaeans in Sealand. In the north he
swayed at least, so he claimed the wide domains of the
Nairi people. He also confirmed his supremacy over the
Hittites. The Aramasan state of Damascus, which had withstood the attack of the great Shalmaneser and afterwards
oppressed, as we have seen, the kingdoms of Israel and
Judah, was completely overpowered by Adad-nirari. The old king, Hazael, died when Assyria's power was being
strengthened and increased along his frontiers. He was
succeeded by his son Mari, who is believed to be identical
with the Biblical Ben-Hadad III. 1
Shortly after this new monarch came to the throne,
Adad-nirari IV led a great army against him. The Syrian
ruler appears to have been taken by surprise ; probably his kingdom was suffering from the three defeats which
had been previously administered by the revolting Israel
ites.2 At any rate Mari was unable to gather together an
army of allies to resist the Assyrian, advance, and took
1 2 Kings, xiii, 3. a 2 Kings, xiii, 14-25.



THE AGE OF SEMIRAMIS 439
refuge behind the walls of Damascus. This strongly
fortified city was closely invested, and Mari had at length to submit and acknowledge Adad-nirari as his overlord.
The price of peace included 23,000 talents of silver, 20
of gold, 3000 of copper, and 5000 of iron, as well as
ivory ornaments and furniture, embroidered materials,
and other goods "to a countless amount ". Thus u the
Lord gave Israel a saviour, so that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians : and the children of Israel
dwelt in their tents, as beforetime". This significant
reference to the conquest of Damascus by the Assyrian king is followed by another which throws light on the
religious phenomena of the period : " Nevertheless they
departed not from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, who made Israel sin, but walked therein : and there remained the grove also in Samaria".1 Ashtoreth and her golden
calf continued to be venerated, and doves were sacrificed
to the local Adonis.
It is not certain whether Adad-nirari penetrated
farther than Damascus. Possibly all the states which
owed allegiance to the king of that city became at once
the willing vassals of Assyria, their protector. The tribute received by Adad-nirari from Tyre, Sidon, the
land of Omri (Israel), Edom, and Palastu (Philistia) may
have been gifted as a formal acknowledgment of his
suzerainty and with purpose to bring them directly under Assyrian control, so that Damascus might be pre
vented from taking vengeance against them. Meagre details survive regarding the reign of the
next king, Shalmaneser IV (781-772 B.C.). These are,
however, supplemented by the Urartian inscriptions. Although Adad-nirari boasted that he had subdued the
kingdom of Urartu in the north, he appears to have
1 2 A.'/.t, xiii, 5, 6.



440 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
done no more than limit its southern expansion for a
time.
The Urarti were, like the Mitanni, a military aristoc
racy 1 who welded together by conquest the tribes of the eastern and northern Highlands which several Assyrian
monarchs included in their Empire. They acquired the
elements of Assyrian culture, and used the Assyrian
script for their own language. Their god was named
Khaldis, and they called their nation Khaldia. During
the reign of Ashur-natsir-pal their area of control was confined to the banks of the river Araxes, but it was
gradually extended under a succession of vigorous kings towards the south-west until they became supreme round
the shores of Lake Van. Three of their early kings were Lutipris, Sharduris I, and Arame.
During the reign of Shamshi-Adad the Assyrians
came into conflict with the Urarti, who were governed at
the time by " Ushpina of Nairi "
(Ishpuinis, son of
Sharduris II). The Urartian kingdom had extended
rapidly and bordered on Assyrian territory. To the west were the tribes known as the Mannai, the northern
enemies of the Medes, a people of Indo-European speech.
When Adad-nirari IV waged war against the Urarti,
their king was Menuas, the son of Ishpuinis. Menuas
was a great war-lord, and was able to measure his strength
against Assyria on equal terms. He had nearly doubled
by conquest the area controlled by his predecessors. Adad-nirari endeavoured to drive his rival northward, but
all along the Assyrian frontier from the Euphrates to the Lower Zab, Menuas forced the outposts of Adad-nirari
to retreat southward. The Assyrians, in short, were
unable to hold their own.
*Thc masses of the Urartian folk appear to have been of Hatti sfock "broad heads", like their descendants, the modern Armenians.



THE AGE OF SEMIRAMIS 441
Having extended his kingdom towards the south,
Menuas invaded Hittite territory, subdued Malaria and
compelled its king to pay tribute. He also conquered
the Mannai and other tribes. Towards the north and
north-west he added a considerable area to his kingdom,
which became as large as Assyria.
Menuas's capital was the city of Turushpa or Dhuspas (Van), which was called Khaldmas l after the national god.
For a century it was the seat of Urartian administration.
The buildings erected there by Menuas and his successors
became associated in after-time with the traditions of
Semiramis, who, as Queen Sammu-rammat of Assyria,
was a contemporary of the great Urartian conqueror.
Similarly a sculptured representation of the Hittite god was referred to by Herodotus as a memorial of the
Egyptian king Sesostris.
The strongest fortification at Dhuspas was the citadel,
which was erected on a rocky promontory jutting into
Lake Van. A small garrison could there resist a pro
longed siege. The water supply of the city was assured by the construction of subterranean aqueducts. Menuas
erected a magnificent palace, which rivalled that of the
Assyrian monarch at Kalkhi, and furnished it with the rich
booty brought back from victorious campaigns. He was a lover of trees and planted many, and he laid out gardens which bloomed with brilliant Asian flowers. The palace
commanded a noble prospect of hill and valley scenery on the south-western shore of beautiful Lake Van.
Menuas was succeeded by his son Argistis, who ascended the throne during the lifetime of Adad-nirari
of Assyria. During the early part of his reign he conducted military expeditions to the north beyond the river

442 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
Araxes. He afterwards came into conflict with Assyria,
and acquired more territory on its northern frontier.
He also subdued the Mannai, who had risen in revolt.
For three years (781-778 B.C.) the general of Shal
maneser IV waged war constantly with Urartu, and again in 776 B.C. and 774 B.C. attempts were made to prevent
the southern expansion of that Power. On more than
one occasion the Assyrians were defeated and compelled
to retreat.
Assyria suffered serious loss of prestige on account
of its inability to hold in check its northern rival.
Damascus rose in revolt and had to be subdued, and
northern Syria was greatly disturbed. Hadrach was
visited in the last year of the king's reign.
Ashur-dan III (771-763 B.C.) occupied the Assyrian
throne during a period of great unrest. He was unable
to attack Urartu. His army had to operate instead on
his eastern and southern frontiers. A great plague broke
out in 765 B.C., the year in which Hadrach had again to
be dealt with. On June 15, 763 B.C., there was a total
eclipse of the sun, and that dread event was followed by
a revolt at Asshur which was no doubt of priestly origin. The king's son Adad-nirari was involved in it, but it is
not certain whether or not he displaced his father for a
time. In 758 B.C. Ashur-dan again showed signs of
activity by endeavouring to suppress the revolts which during the period of civil war had broken out in Syria.
Adad-nirari V came to the throne in 763 B.C. He
had to deal with revolts in Asshur in other cities. Indeed
for the greater part of his reign he seems to have been
kept fully engaged endeavouring to establish his authority
within the Assyrian borders. The Syrian provinces re
gained their independence. During the first four years of his successor Ashur



THE AGE OF SEMIRAMIS 443
nirari IV (753-746 B.C.) the army never left Assyria. Namri was visited in 749-748 B.C., but it is not certain whether he fought against the Urartians, or the Aramaeans
who had become active during this period of Assyrian decline. In 746 B.C. a revolt broke out in the city of
Kalkhi and the king had to leave it. Soon afterwards he died perhaps he was assassinated and none of his sons
came to the throne. A year previously Nabu-natsir, known to the Greeks as Nabonassar, was crowned king
of Babylonia.
Ashur-nirari IV appears to have been a monarch of somewhat like character to the famous Akhenaton of
Egypt an idealist for whom war had no attractions.
He kept his army at home while his foreign possessions rose in revolt one after another. Apparently he had
dreams of guarding Assyria against attack by means of
treaties of peace. He arranged one with a Mesopotamian
king, Mati-ilu of Agusi, who pledged himself not to go to war without the consent of his Assyrian overlord, and it is possible that there were other documents of like
character which have not survived to us. During his
leisure v hours the king engaged himself in studious pur
suits and made additions to the royal library. In the
end his disappointed soldiers found a worthy leader in
one of its generals who seized the throne and assumed
the royal name of Tiglath-pileser. Ashur-nirari IV was the last king of the Middle
Empire of Assyria. He may have been a man of high
character and refinement and worthy of our esteem,
although an unsuitable ruler for a predatory State.

Assyrian civilization the period of the Third or New
Empire during which flourished Tiglath-pileser IV, the mighty conqueror ; the Shalmaneser of the Bible; "Sargon

Tiglath-pileser IV, who deposed Ashur-nirari IV, was
known to the Babylonians as Pulu, which, some think, was a term of contempt signifying "wild animal". In
the Bible he is referred to as Pul, Tiglath-pilneser, and

Tiglath-pileser.
1 He came to the Assyrian throne towards
the end of April in 745 B.C. and reigned until 727 B.C.
We know nothing regarding his origin, but it seems clear
that he was not of royal descent. He appears to have
been a popular leader of the revolt against Ashur-nirari, who, like certain of his predecessors, had pronounced
pro-Babylonian tendencies. It is significant to note in
this connection that the new king was an unswerving adherent of the cult of Ashur, by the adherents of
which he was probably strongly supported. Tiglath-pileser combined in equal measure those
qualities of generalship and statesmanship which were necessary for the reorganization of the Assyrian state and
the revival of its military prestige. At the beginning of
his reign there was much social discontent and suffering.
The national exchequer had been exhausted by the loss
of tribute from revolting provinces, trade was paralysed, and the industries were in a languishing condition. Plundering bands of Aramaeans were menacing the western frontiers and had overrun part of northern Babylonia.
New political confederacies in Syria kept the north-west
regions in a constant state of unrest, and the now powerful
Urartian kingdom was threatening the Syro-Cappadocian states as if its rulers had dreams of building up a great
world empire on the ruins of that of Assyria.
Tiglath-pileser first paid attention to Babylonia, and extinguished the resistance of the Aramaeans in Akkad.
He appears to have been welcomed by Nabonassar, who
became his vassal, and he offered sacrifices in the cities of
Babylon, Sippar, Cuthah, and Nippur. Sippar had been occupied by Aramaeans, as on a previous occasion when they destroyed the temple of the sun god Shamash which
was restored by Nabu-aplu-iddina of Babylon,

Tiglath-pileser did not overrun Chaldaea, but he
destroyed its capital, Sarrabanu, and impaled King Nabu
ushabshi. He proclaimed himself " King of Sumer and
Akkad " and " King of the Four Quarters ". The frontier
states of Elam and Media were visited and subdued.
Having disposed of the Aramaeans and other raiders, the Assyrian monarch had next to deal with his most
powerful rival, Urartu. Argistis 1 had been succeeded
by Sharduris III, who had formed an alliance with the
north Mesopotamian king, Mati-ilu of Agusi, on whom Ashur-nirari had reposed his faith. Ere long Sharduris pressed southward from Malatia and compelled the north
Syrian Hittite states, including Carchemish, to acknow
ledge his suzerainty. A struggle then ensued between Urartu and Assyria for the possession of the Syro-Cappadocian states.
At this time the reputation of Tiglath-pileser hung in the balance. If he failed in his attack on Urartu, his prestige would vanish at home and abroad and Sharduris
might, after establishing himself in northern Syria, invade
Assyria and compel its allegiance.
Two courses lay before Tiglath-pileser. He could either cross the mountains and invade Urartu, or strike
at his rival in north Syria, where the influence of Assyria
had been completely extinguished. The latter appeared to him to be the most feasible and judicious procedure, for if he succeeded in expelling the invaders he would at
the same time compel the allegiance of the rebellious
Hittite states.
In the spring of 743 B.C. Tiglath-pileser led his army across the Euphrates and reached Arpad without meeting
with any resistance. The city appears to have opened its
gates to him although it was in the kingdom of Mati-ilu,
who acknowledged Urartian sway. Its foreign garrison

was slaughtered. Well might Sharduris exclaim, in the
words of the prophet, " Where is the king of Arpad ? where are the gods of Arpad P" 1
Leaving Arpad, Tiglath - pileser advanced to meet
Sharduris, who was apparently hastening southward to
attack the Assyrians in the rear. Tiglath-pileser, however, crossed the Euphrates and, moving northward, delivered an unexpected attack on the Urartian army in
Qummukh. A fierce battle ensued, and one of its dra
matic incidents was a single combat between the rival
kings. The tide of battle flowed in Assyria's favour, and when evening was falling the chariots and cavalry of
Urartu were thrown into confusion. An attempt was
made to capture King Sharduris, who leapt from his
chariot and made hasty escape on horseback, hotly pur
sued in the gathering darkness by an Assyrian contingent
of cavalry. Not until "the bridge of the Euphrates" was reached was the exciting night chase abandoned.
Tiglath-pileser had achieved an overwhelming victory
against an army superior to his own in numbers. Over
70,000 of the enemy were slain or taken captive, while the Urartian camp with its stores and horses and followers
fell into the hands of the triumphant Assyrians. Tiglathpileser burned the royal tent and throne as an offering to Ashur, and carried Sharduris's bed to the temple of the
goddess of Nineveh, whither he returned to prepare a
new plan of campaign against his northern rival.
Despite the blow dealt against Urartu, Assyria did
not immediately regain possession of north Syria. The shifty Mati-ilu either cherished the hope that Sharduris
would recover strength and again invade north Syria, or
that he might himself establish an empire in that region.
Tiglath-pileser had therefore to march westward again.
1 2 Khgij xviii, 34 and xix, 13.



448 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
For three years he conducted vigorous campaigns in "the
western land", where he met with vigorous resistance. In
740 B.C. Arpad was captured and Mati-ilu deposed and prob
ably put to death. Two years later Kullani and Hamath
fell, and the districts which they controlled were included
in the Assyrian empire and governed by Crown officials. Once again the Hebrews came into contact with
Assyria. The Dynasty of Jehu had come to an end by this time. Its fall may not have been unconnected with
the trend of events in Assyria during the closing years of the Middle Empire.
Supported by Assyria, the kings of Israel had become
powerful and haughty. Jehoash, the grandson of Jehu, had achieved successes in conflict with Damascus. In
Judah the unstable Amaziah, son of Joash, was strong enough to lay a heavy hand on Edom, and flushed with
triumph then resolved to readjust his relations with his
overlord, the king of Israel. Accordingly he sent a communication to Jehoash which contained some proposal
regarding their political relations, concluding with the
offer or challenge, " Come, let us look one another in the
face ". A contemptuous answer was returned.
Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah,
saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was
in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife : and
there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trode down
the thistle. Thou hast indeed smitten Edom, and thine heart
hath lifted thee up: glory of this, and tarry at home, for why shouldest thou meddle to thy hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with thee? But Amaziah would not hear. Therefore Jehoash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth-shemesh [city of Shamash, the sun god],
which belongeth to Judah. And Judah was put to the worse
before Israel j and they fled every man to their tents.



ASSYRIA'S AGE OF SPLENDOUR 449
Jehoash afterwards destroyed a large portion of the wall of Jerusalem and plundered the temple and palace,
returning home to Samaria with rich booty and hostages.
1
Judah thus remained a vassal state of Israel's.
Jeroboam, son of Jehoash, had a long and prosperous
reign. About 773 B.C. he appears to have co-operated with Assyria and conquered Damascus and Hamath. His
son Zachariah, the last king of the Jehu Dynasty of Israel, came to the throne in 740 B.C. towards the close of the
reign of Azariah, son of Amaziah, king of Judah. Six months afterwards he was assassinated by Shallum. This
usurper held sway at Samaria for only a month. " For
Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah, and came to Samaria, and smote Shallum the son of Jabcsh
in Samaria, and slew him, and reigned in his stead." 2
Tiglath-pileser was operating successfully in middle
Syria when he had dealings with, among others, c< Meni
himme (Menahem) of the city of the Samarians ", who
paid tribute. No resistance was possible on the part of
Menahem, the usurper, who was probably ready to wel
come the Assyrian conqueror, so that, by arranging an
alliance, he might secure his own position. The Biblical
reference is as follows : " And Pul the king of Assyria
came against the land : and Menahem gave Pul a thou
sand talents of silver, that his hand might be with him to
confirm the kingdom in his hand. And Menahem exacted
the money of Israel, even of all the mighty men of wealth,
of each man fifty shekels of silver, to give to the king of
Assyria. So the king of Assyria turned back, and stayed
not there in the land." 3 Rezin of Damascus, Hiram of
Tyre, and Zabibi, queen of the Arabians, also sent gifts
to Tiglath-pileser at this time (738 B.C.). Aramaean revolts on the borders of Elam were suppressed by
1 2 Kings9 xiv, 1-14. *2KingS) xv, 1-14. * 2 Ktngs, xv, 19, 20.

Assyrian governors, and large numbers of the inhabitants
were transported to various places in Syria.
Tiglath-pileser next operated against the Median and other hill tribes in the north-east. In 735 B.C. he invaded
Urartu, the great Armenian state which had threatened
the supremacy of Assyria in north Syria and Cappadocia. King Sharduris was unable to protect his frontier or
hamper the progress of the advancing army, which penetrated to his capital. Dhuspas was soon captured, but Sharduris took refuge in his rocky citadel which he and
his predecessors had laboured to render impregnable. There he was able to defy the might of Assyria, for the fortress could be approached on the western side alone
by a narrow path between high walls and towers, so that
only a small force could find room to operate against the
numerous garrison.
Tiglath-pileser had to content himself by devastating
the city on the plain and the neighbouring villages. He
overthrew buildings, destroyed orchards, and transported to Nineveh those of the inhabitants he had not put to
the sword, with all the live stock he could lay hands
on. Thus was Urartu crippled and humiliated : it never
regained its former prestige among the northern states.
In the following year Tiglath-pileser returned to Syria. The circumstances which made this expedition necessary
are of special interest on account of its Biblical associations.
Menahem, king of Israel, had died, and was succeeded by his son Pekahiah. "But Pekah the son of Remaliah,
a captain of his, conspired against him and smote him in Samaria, in the palace of the king's house, . . . and he
killed him, and reigned in his room." 1 When Pekah
was on the throne, Ahaz began to reign over Judah. Judah had taken advantage of the disturbed conditions

*



ASSYRIA'S AGE OF SPLENDOUR 451
in Israel to assert its independence. The walls of Jeru
salem were repaired by Jotham, father of Ahaz, and a tunnel constructed to supply it with water. Isaiah refers
to this tunnel : " Go forth and meet Ahaz ... at the
end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of
the fuller's field "
(Isaiah, vii, 3). Pekah had to deal with a powerful party in Israel
which favoured the re-establishment of David's kingdom
in Palestine. Their most prominent leader was the prophet Amos, whose eloquent exhortations were couched in
no uncertain terms. He condemned Israel for its idola
tries, and cried :
For thus saith the Lord unto the house of Israel, Seek ye me
and ye shall live. . . . Have ye offered unto me sacrifices and offer
ings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel ? But ye ha\ e borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images, the
star of your god, which ye made to yourselves.
1
Pekah sought to extinguish the orthodox party's
movement by subduing Judah. So he plotted with
Rezin3 king of Damascus. Amos prophesied.
Thus saith the Lord. ... I will send a fire into the house of Hazael, which will devour the palaces of Ben-hadad. I will break also the bar of Damascus . . . and the people of Syria shall go
into captivity unto Kir. . . . The remnant of the Philistines shall
perish.
Tyre, Edom, and Ammon would also be punished.2
Judah was completely isolated by the allies who
acknowledged the suzerainty of Damascus. Soon after
Ahaz came to the throne he found himself hemmed in on
every side by adversaries who desired to accomplish his
fall. "At that time Rezin, king of Syria, and Pekah
. . came up to Jerusalem to war : and they besieged

Ahaz, but could not overcome him." 1 Judah, however, was overrun; the city of Elath was captured and restored
to Edom, while the Philistines were liberated from the
control of Jerusalem. Isaiah visited Ahaz and said,
Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither be faint-hearted
for the two tails of these smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of Remaliah. Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have taken evil counsel
against thee, saying, Let us go up against Judah, and vex it, and let us make a breach therein for us, and set a king in the midst of it, even the son of Tabeal: Thus saith the Lord God, It shall
not stand, neither shall it come to pass. 2
The unstable Ahaz had sought assistance from the
Baal, and "made his son to pass through the fire, accord
ing to the abominations of the heathen". 3 Then he
resolved to purchase the sympathy of one of the great Powers. There was no hope of assistance from cc the fly
that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt", for
the Ethiopian Pharaohs had not yet conquered the Delta
region, so he turned to " the bee that is in the land of
Assyria".4 Assyria was the last resource of the king of
Judah.
So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria,
saying, I am thy servant and thy son: come up and save me out of the hand of Syria and out of the hand of the king of Israel, which rise up against me. And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the Lord, and in the treasures of the king's
house, and sent it for a present to the king of Assyria.
And the king of Assyria hearkened unto him : for the king of
Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried the
people of it captive to Kir 6 and slew Rezin.6

Tiglath-pileser recorded that Rezin took refuge in his
city like " a mouse ". Israel was also dealt with.
In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, and took Ijon and Abel-beth-maachah, and Janoah and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali, and carried them captive to Assyria. And Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the son of Remaliah, and smote him, and slew him, and reigned in his stead. 1
Tiglath-pileser recorded : " They overthrew Paqaha (Pekah), their king, and placed Ausi'a (Hoshea) over
them ". He swept through Israel " like a hurricane ".
The Philistines and the Arabians of the desert were also subdued. Tribute was sent to the Assyrian monarch by
Phoenicia, Moab, Ammon, and Edom. It was a proud day for Ahaz when he paid a visit to Tiglath-pileser at
Damascus.2 An Assyrian governor was appointed to rule
over Syria and its subject states.
Babylon next claimed the attention of Tiglath-pileser. Nabonassar had died and was succeeded by his son Nabu
nadin-zeri, who, after reigning for two years, was slain in a rebellion. The throne was then seized by Nabu-shum
ukin, but in less than two months this usurper was
assassinated and the Chaldaeans had one of their chiefs,
Ukinzer, proclaimed king (732 B.C.).
When the Assyrian king returned from Syria in 731
B.C. he invaded Babylonia. He was met with a stubborn
resistance. Ukinzer took refuge in his capital, Shapia,
which held out successfully, although the surrounding
country was ravaged and despoiled. Two years afterwards
Tiglath-pileser returned, captured Shapia, and restored
peace throughout Babylonia. He was welcomed in Babylon, which opened its gates to him, and he had himself

proclaimed king of Sumer and Akkad. The Chaldaeans
paid tribute.
Tiglath-pileser had now reached the height of his
ambition. He had not only extended his empire in the
west from Cappadocia to the river of Egypt, crippled Urartu and pacified his eastern frontier, but brought Assyria into close union with Babylonia, the mother
land, the home of culture and the land of the ancient
gods. He did not live long, however, to enjoy his final triumph, for he died a little over twelve months after he
"took the hands of Bel (Merodach)" at Babylon.
He was succeeded by Shalmaneser V (727-722 B.C.),
who may have been his son, but this is not quite certain.
Little is known regarding his brief reign. In 725 B.C. he
led an expedition to Syria and Phoenicia. Several of the
vassal peoples had revolted when they heard of the death
of Tiglath-pileser. These included the Phoenicians, the Philistines, and the Israelites who were intriguing with
either Egypt or Mutsri.
Apparently Hoshea, king of Israel, pretended when the Assyrians entered his country that he remained friendly. Shalmaneser, however, was well informed, and made Hoshea a prisoner. Samaria closed its gates against him
although their king had been dispatched to Assyria.
The Biblical account of the campaign is as follows :
"Against him (Hoshea) came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria ; and Hoshea became his servant, and gave him
presents. And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea : for he had sent messengers to So king of
Egypt,1 and brought no present to the king of Assyria,
1 In the Hebrew text this monarch is called Sua, Seven, and So, says Maspero. The
Assyrian texts refer to him as Sebek, Shibahi, Shabe, &c. He has been identified with Pharaoh Shabaka of the Twenty-fifth Egyptian Dynasty j that monarch may have been a petty king before he founded his Dynasty. Another theory is that he was Seve,



ASSYRIA'S AGE OF SPLENDOUR 455
as he had done year by year ; therefore the king of
Assyria shut him up and bound him in prison.
"Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and went up to Samaria, and besieged it three
i
years.
l
Shalmaneser died before Samaria was captured, and
may have been assassinated. The next Assyrian monarch,
Sargon II (722-705 B.C.), was not related to either of his
two predecessors. He is referred to by Isaiah,2 and is
the Arkeanos of Ptolemy. He was the Assyrian monarch
who deported the " Lost Ten Tribes".
"In the ninth year of Hoshea" (and the first of
Sargon) " the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah and
in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the
Medes." 3 In all, according to Sargon's record, "27,290
people dwelling in the midst of it (Samaria) I carried off".
They (the Israelites) left all the commandments of the Lord
their God, and made them molten images, even two calves, and
made a grove, and worshipped all the host of heaven (the stars),
and served Baal. And they caused their sons and their daughters
to pass through the fire, and used divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the Lord, to provoke him to anger. Therefore the Lord was very angry with Israel, and removed them out of his sight : there was none left but the
tribe of Judah only.
And the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Ava, and from Hamath, and from Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of
Israel : and they possessed Samaria, and dwelt in the cities thereof.
. . . And the men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, and the men
of Cuth (Cuthah) made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made
king of Mutsri, and still another that he was a petty king of an Egyptian state in the Delta and not Shabaka. 1 3 King^ xvii, 3-5. 3 Isatah, xx, i. 3 2 Kwgs<> xvii, 6.

A number of the new settlers were slain by lions, and the king of Assyria ordered that a Samaritan priest should
be sent to " teach them the manner of the God of the
land". This man was evidently an orthodox Hebrew,
for he taught them " how they should fear the Lord. . . .
So they feared the Lord ", but also " served their own
gods . . . their graven images'

There is no evidence to suggest that the "Ten Lost
Tribes", "regarding whom so many nonsensical theories have been formed ", were not ultimately absorbed by the
peoples among whom they settled between Mesopotamia
and the Median Highlands.2 The various sections must have soon lost touch with one another. They were not
united like the Jews (the people of Judah), who were
transported to Babylonia a century and a half later, by
a common religious bond, for although a few remained faithful to Abraham's God, the majority of the Israelites worshipped either the Baal or the Queen of Heaven.
The Assyrian policy of transporting the rebellious inhabitants of one part of their empire to another was
intended to break their national spirit and compel them
to become good and faithful subjects amongst the aliens,
who must have disliked them. " The colonists," says Professor Maspero, "exposed to the same hatred as the
original Assyrian conquerors, soon forgot to look upon the latter as the oppressors of all, and, allowing their
present grudge to efface the memory of past injuries, did

not hesitate to make common cause with them. In time
of peace the (Assyrian) governor did his best to protect them against molestation on the part of the natives, and
in return for this they rallied round him whenever the latter threatened to get out of hand, and helped him to
stifle the revolt, or hold it in check until the arrival of
reinforcements. Thanks to their help, the empire was consolidated and maintained without too many violent outbreaks in regions far removed from the capital, and beyond the immediate reach of the sovereign." 1 While Sargon was absent in the west, a revolt broke
out in Babylonia. A Chaldaean king, Merodach Baladan
III, had allied himself with the Elamites, and occupied
Babylon. A battle was fought at Dur-ilu and the Elamites
retreated. Although Sargon swept triumphantly through the land, he had to leave his rival, the tyrannous Chaldasan,
in possession of the capital, and he reigned there for over eleven years.
Trouble was brewing in Syria. It was apparently fostered by an Egyptian king probably Bocchoris of Sais, the sole Pharaoh so far as can be ascertained of the
Twenty-fourth Dynasty, who had allied himself with the
local dynasts of Lower Egypt and apparently sought to extend his sway into Asia, the Ethiopians being supreme
in Upper Egypt. An alliance had been formed to cast
off the yoke of Assyria. The city states involved Arpad,
Simirra, Damascus, Samaria, and Gaza. Hanno of Gaza had fled to Egypt after Tiglath-pileser came to the relief
of Judah and broke up the league of conspirators by capturing Damascus, and punishing Samaria, Gaza, and other cities. His return in Sargon's reign was evidently connected with the new rising in which he took part. The throne of Hamath had been seized by an adventurer,

458 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
named Ilu-bi'di, a smith. The Philistines of Ashdod and
the Arabians being strongly pro-Egyptian in tendency, were willing sympathizers and helpers against the hated
Assyrians.
Sargon appeared in the west with a strong army before
the allies had matured their plans. He met the smith
king of Hamath in battle at Qarqar, and, having defeated
him, had him skinned alive. Then he marched south
ward. At Rapiki (Raphia) he routed an army of allies.
Shabi (?So), the Tartan (commander-in-chief) of Pi'ru * (Pharaoh), King of Mutsri (an Arabian state confused,
perhaps, with Misraim = Egypt), escaped " like to a shepherd whose sheep have been taken ". Piru and other two southern kings, Samsi and Itamara, afterwards
paid tribute to Sargon. Hanno of Gaza was transported to Asshur.
In 715 B.C. Sargon, according to his records, appeared with his army in Arabia, and received gifts in token of homage from Piru of Mutsri, Samsi of Aribi, and Itamara
of Saba. Four years later a revolt broke out in Ashdod which
was, it would appear, directly due to the influence of
Shabaka, the Ethiopian Pharaoh, who had deposed Bocchoris of Sais. Another league was about to be formed against Assyria. King Azuri of Ashdod had been de
posed because of his Egyptian sympathies by the Assyrian governor, and his brother Akhimiti was placed on the
throne. The citizens, however, overthrew Akhimiti, and
an adventurer from Cyprus was proclaimed king (711 B.C.). It would appear that advances were made by the anti
1 Those who, like Breasted, identify "Piru of Mutsri" with "Pharaoh of Egypt" adopt the view that Bocchoris of Sais paid tribute to Sargon. Piru, however, is subsequently referred to with two Arabian kings as tiibute payers to Sargon apparently after Lower Egypt had come under the sway of Shabaka, the first king of the Ethiopian or Twenty-fifth Dynasty.



ASSYRIA'S AGE OF SPLENDOUR 459
Assyrians to Ahaz of Judah. That monarch was placed
in a difficult position. He knew that if the allies suc
ceeded in stamping out Assyrian authority in Syria and Palestine they would certainly depose him, but if on the
other hand he joined them and Assyria triumphed, its
emperor would show him small mercy. As Babylon defied Sargon and received the active support of Elam, and there were rumours of risings in the north, it must have seemed to the western kings as if the Assyrian
empire was likely once again to go to pieces.
Fortunately for Ahaz he had a wise counsellor at this
time in the great statesman and prophet, the scholarly
Isaiah. The Lord spake by Isaiah saying, " Go and loose the sackcloth from off thy loins, and put off thy
shoe from thy foot. And he did so, walking naked and
barefoot. And the Lord said, Like as my servant Isaiah
hath walked naked and barefoot three years for a sign
and wonder upon Egypt and upon Ethiopia; so shall the
king of Assyria lead away the Egyptians prisoners. . . .
And they (the allies) shall be afraid and ashamed of
Ethiopia their expectation, and of Egypt their glory."
1
Isaiah warned Ahaz against joining the league, " in the year that Tartan 2 came unto Ashdod (when Sargon
the king of Assyria sent him)". The Tartan "fought
against Ashdod and took it".3 According to Sargon's record the Pretender of Ashdod fled to Arabia, where he was seized by an Arabian chief and delivered up to
Assyria. The pro -Egyptian party in Palestine went under a cloud for a period thereafter. Before Sargon could deal with Merodach Baladan of
Babylon, he found it necessary to pursue the arduous task
of breaking up a powerful league which had been formed
against him in the north. The Syro-Cappadocian Hittite

states, including Tabal in Asia Minor and Carchemish in
north Syria, were combining for the last time against
Assyria, supported by Mita (Midas), king of the MuskiPhrygians, and Rusas, son of Sharduris III, king of Urartu. Urartu had recovered somewhat from the disasters
which it had suffered at the hands of Tiglath-pileser, and
was winning back portions of its lost territory on the
north-east frontier of Assyria. A buffer state had been
formed in that area by Tiglath-pileser, who had assisted
the king of the Mannai to weld together the hill tribes
men between Lake Van and Lake Urmia into an organized
nation. Iranzu, its ruler, remained faithful to Assyria and consequently became involved in war with Rusas of
Urartu, who either captured or won over several cities of the Mannai. Iranzu was succeeded by his son Aza,
and this king was so pronounced a pro-Assyrian that his pro-Urartian subjects assassinated him and set on the throne Bagdatti of Umildish.
Soon after Sargon began his operations in the north
he captured Bagdatti and had him skinned alive. The
flag of revolt, however, was kept flying by his brother,
Ullusunu, but ere long this ambitious man found it prudent to submit to Sargon on condition that he would
retain the throne as a faithful Assyrian vassal. His
sudden change of policy appears to have been due to the
steady advance of the Median tribes into the territory of the Mannai. Sargon conducted a vigorous and successful campaign against the raiders, and extended Ullusunu's
area of control.
The way was now clear to Urartu. In 714 B.C.
Sargon attacked the revolting king of Zikirtu, who was
supported by an army led by Rusas, his overlord. A fierce battle was fought in which the Assyrians achieved



ASSYRIA'S AGE OF SPLENDOUR 46 1
a great victory. King Rusas fled, and when he found
that the Assyrians pressed home their triumph by laying waste the country before them, he committed suicide,
according to the Assyrian records, although those of Urartu indicate that he subsequently took part in the
struggle against Sargon. The Armenian peoples were
compelled to acknowledge the suzerainty of Assyria, and the conqueror received gifts from various tribes between
Lake Van and the Caspian Sea, and along the frontiers from Lake Van towards the south-east as far as the borders of Elam. Rusas of Urartu was succeeded by Argistes II, who
reigned over a shrunken kingdom. He intrigued with
neighbouring states against Assyria, but was closely watched. Ere long he found himself caught between
two fires. During his reign the notorious Cimmerians
and Scythians displayed much activity in the north and
raided his territory.
The pressure of fresh infusions of Thraco-Phrygian
tribes into western Asia Minor had stirred Midas of the
Muski to co-operate with the Urartian power in an
attempt to stamp out Assyrian influence in Cilicia, Cappa
docia, and north Syria. A revolt in Tabal in 718 B.C.
was extinguished by Sargon, but in the following year evidences were forthcoming of a more serious and wide
spread rising. Pisiris, king of Carchemish, threw off the Assyrian yoke. Before, however, his allies could hasten to his assistance he was overcome by the vigilant Sargon,
who deported a large proportion of the city's inhabitants
and incorporated it in an Assyrian province. Tabal revolted in 713 B.C. and was similarly dealt with. In 712 B.C. Milid had to be overcome. The inhabitants
were transported, and " Suti " Aramaean peoples settled
in their homes. The king of Commagene, having



462 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
remained faithful, received large extensions of territory.
Finally in 709 B.C. Midas of the Muski-Phrygians was
compelled to acknowledge the suzerainty of Assyria. The northern confederacy was thus completely worsted and
broken up. Tribute was paid by many peoples, including the rulers of Cyprus.
Sargon was now able to deal with Babylonia, which for about twelve years had been ruled by Merodach
Baladan, who oppressed the people and set at defiance
ancient laws by seizing private estates and transferring
them to his Chaldaean kinsmen. He still received the
active support of Elam.
Sargon's fifst move was to interpose his army between those of the Babylonians and Elamites. Pushing southward, he subdued the Aramaeans on the eastern banks of the Tigris, and drove the Elamites into the mountains. Then he invaded middle Babylonia from the east. Mero
dach Baladan hastily evacuated Babylon, and, moving
southward, succeeded in evading Sargon's army. Finding Elam was unable to help him, he took refuge in the
Chaldaean capital, Bit Jakin, in southern Babylonia. Sargon was visited by the priests of Babylon and Borsippa, and hailed as the saviour of the ancient kingdom.
He was afterwards proclaimed king at E-sagila, where
he a took the hands of Bel ". Then having expelled the Aramaeans from Sippar, he hastened southward, attacked
Bit Jakin and captured it. Merodach Baladan escaped
into Elam. The whole of Chaldaea was subdued.
Thus "Sargon the Later*' entered at length into full
possession of the empire of Sargon of Akkad. In Babylonia he posed as an incarnation of his ancient namesake,
and had similarly Messianic pretensions which were no
doubt inspired by the Babylonian priesthood. Under
him Assyria attained its highest degree of splendour.



ASSYRIA'S AGE OF SPLENDOUR 463
He recorded proudly not only his great conquests but also his works of public utility: he restored ancient cities,
irrigated vast tracts of country, fostered trade, and promoted the industries. Like the pious Pharaohs of Egypt
he boasted that he fed the hungry and protected the weak
against the strong. Sargon found time during his strenuous career as a
conqueror to lay out and build a new city, called Dur
Sharrukin, " the burgh of Sargon ", to the north of Nineveh. It was completed before he undertook the
Babylonian campaign. The new palace was occupied in 708 B.C. Previous to that period he had resided prin
cipally at Kalkhi, in the restored palace of Ashur-natsir
pal III.
He was a worshipper of many gods. Although he claimed to have restored the supremacy of Asshur "which had come to an end", he not only adored Ashur but
also revived the ancient triad of Anu, Bel, and Ea, and
fostered the growth of the immemorial " mother-cult " of
Ishtar. Before he died he appointed one of his sons,
Sennacherib, viceroy of the northern portion of the
empire. He was either assassinated at a military review
or in some frontier war. As much is suggested by the
following entry in an eponym list.

A soldier (entered) the camp of the king of Assyria (and killed him?), month Ab, day I2th, Sennacherib (sat on
the throne).1
The fact that Sennacherib lamented his father's sins
suggests that the old king had in some manner offended
1 The Old Testament in the Light of the Historical Records and Legends of Assyria and
Babylonia, T. G. Pinches, p. 372.



464 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
the priesthood. Perhaps, like some of the Middle Empire monarchs, he succumbed to the influence of Babylon
during the closing years of his life. It is stated that " he
was not buried in his house'', which suggests that the
customary religious rites were denied him, and that his lost soul was supposed to be a wanderer which had to eat
offal and drink impure water like the ghost of a pauper
or a criminal.
The task which lay before Sennacherib (705-680 B.C.)
was to maintain the unity of the great empire of his dis
tinguished father. He waged minor wars against the Kassite and Illipi tribes on the Elamite border, and the
Muski and Hittite tribes in Cappadocia and Cilicia. The
Kassites, however, were no longer of any importance, and the Hittite power had been extinguished, for ere the
states could recover from the blows dealt by the Assyrians
the Cimmerian hordes ravaged their territory. Urartu
was also overrun by the fierce barbarians from the north.
It was one of these last visits of the Assyrians to Tabal of
the Hittites and the land of the Muski (Meshech) which
the Hebrew prophet referred to in after-time when he exclaimed :
Asshur is there and all her company: his graves are about him: all of them slain, fallen by the sword. . . . There is Meshech, Tubal, and all her multitude: her graves are round about him: all
of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword, though they caused
their terror in the land of the living. . . . (E*ekiely xxxii.)
Sennacherib found that lonians had settled in Cilicia, and he deported large numbers of them to Nineveh. The metal and ivory work at Nineveh show traces of Greek
influence after this period.
A great conspiracy was fomented in several states
against Sennacherib when the intelligence of Sargon's



ASSYRIA'S AGE OF SPLENDOUR 465
death was bruited abroad. Egypt was concerned in it. Taharka (the Biblical Tirhakah 1
), the last Pharaoh of the
Ethiopian Dynasty, had dreams of re-establishing Egyptian supremacy in Palestine and Syria, and leagued himself
with Luli, king of Tyre, Hezekiah, king of Judah, and
others. Merodach Baladan> the Chaldaean king, whom
Sargon had deposed, supported by Elamites and Aramaeans,
was also a party to the conspiracy. u At that time Mero
dach Baladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent
letters and a present to Hezekiah . . . And Hezekiah was glad of them/' 2 Merodach Baladan again seized the throne of Babylon.
Sargon's son, who had been appointed governor, was murdered and a pretender sat on the throne for a brief period, but Merodach Baladan thrust him aside and
reigned for nine months, during which period he busied
himself by encouraging the kings of Judah and Tyre to revolt. Sennacherib invaded Babylonia with a strong army, deposed Merodach Baladan, routed the Chaldaeans
and Aramaeans, and appointed as vassal king Bel-ibni, a
native prince, who remained faithful to Assyria for about
three years.
In 707 B.C. Sennacherib appeared in the west. When
he approached Tyre, Luli, the king, fled to Cyprus. The city was not captured, but much of its territory was ceded to the king of Sidon. Askalon was afterwards reduced. At Eltekeh Sennacherib came into conflict with an army
of allies, including Ethiopian, Egyptian, and Arabian
Mutsri forces, which he routed. Then he captured a
number of cities in Judah and transported 200,150 people.
He was unable, however, to enter Jerusalem, in which Hezekiah was compelled to remain "like a bird in a cage".
It appears that Hezekiah "bought off" the Assyrians on
^ xxxvii, 9. * Isaiah, xxxix, I, 2.



466 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
this occasion with gifts of gold and silver and jewels,
costly furniture, musicians, and female slaves. In 689 B.C. Sennacherib found it necessary to penetrate
Arabia. Apparently another conspiracy was brewing, for
Hezekiah again revolted. On his return from the south
according to Berosus he had been in Egypt the
Assyrian king marched against the king of Judah.
And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that
he was purposed to fight against Jerusalem, he took counsel with
the princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which were without the city: and they did help him. . . . Why
should the kings of Assyria come and find much water ?
Sennacherib sent messengers to Jerusalem to attempt
to stir up the people against Hezekiah. " He wrote also
letters to rail on the Lord God of Israel, and to speak
against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of other
lands have not delivered their people out of mine hand,
so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver his people out of mine hand.' 71
Hezekiah sent his servants to Isaiah, who was in
Jerusalem at the time, and the prophet said to them:
Thus shall ye say to your master. Thus saith the Lord, Be not afraid of the words which thou hast heard, with which the
servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me. Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumour, and shall
return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword
in his own land. 2
According to Berosus, the Babylonian priestly historian, the camp of Sennacherib was visited in the night by swarms of field mice which ate up the quivers and bows
and the (leather) handles of shields. Next morning the
army fled.
1 2 Chronicle^ xxxii, 9-17. 2 2 L'*njr^ xix, 6, 7.



ASSYRIA'S AGE OF SPLENDOUR 467
The Biblical account of the disaster is as follows:
And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the Lord went out, and smote the camp of the Assyrians an hundred and four score and five thousand: and when they arose early in the
morning, behold, they were all dead corpses. So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned and dwelt at Nineveh. 1
A pestilence may have broken out in the camp, the
infection, perhaps, having been carried by field mice. Byron's imagination was stirred by the vision of the
broken army of Assyria.
The Assyrian came down like a wolf on the fold,
And his cohorts were gleaming with purple and gold ;
And the sheen of their spears was like stars of the sea,
When the blue wave rolls nightly on deep Galilee.
Like the leaves of the forest when summer is green, That host with their banners at sunset were seen; Like the leaves of the forest when autumn hath blown, That host on the morrow lay withered and strown.
For the Angel of Death spread his wings on the blast,
And breathed on the face of the foe as he passed;
And the eyes of the sleepers waxed deadly and chill,
And their hearts but once heaved and forever grew still!
And there lay the steed with his nostril all wide, But through it there rolled not the breath of his pride;
And the foam of his gasping lay white on the turf,
And cold as the spray of the rock-beating surf.
And there lay the rider distorted and pale,
With the dew on his brow, and the rust on his mail;
And the tents were all silent the banners alone The lances uplifted the trumpet unblown.
And the widows of Asshur are loud in their wail,
And the idols are broke in the temple of Baal;
1 2 Kings, xix, 35, 36.



468 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
And the might of the Gentile, unsmote by the sword, Hath melted like snow in the glance of the Lord.
Before this disaster occurred Sennacherib had to invade
Babylonia again, for the vassal king, Bel-ibni, had allied himself with the Chaldaeans and raised the standard of
revolt. The city of Babylon was besieged and captured, and its unfaithful king deported with a number of nobles to Assyria. Old Merodach Baladan was concerned in the plot and took refuge on the Elamite coast, where the
Chaldaeans had formed a colony. He died soon afterwards.
Sennacherib operated in southern Babylonia and invaded Elam. But ere he could return to Assyria he was
opposed by a strong army of allies, including Babylonians, Chaldaeans, Aramaeans, Elamites, and Persians, led by
Samunu, son of Merodach Baladan. A desperate battle
was fought. Although Sennacherib claimed a victory, he
was unable to follow it up. This was in 692 B.C. A Chal
daean named Mushezib-Merodach seized the Babylonian throne.
In 691 B.C. Sennacherib again struck a blow for Babylonia, but was unable to depose Mushezib-Merodach.
His opportunity came, however, in 689 B.C. Elam had
been crippled by raids of the men of Parsua (Persia), and was unable to co-operate with the Chaldaean king
of Babylon. Sennacherib captured the great commercial
metropolis, took Mushezib-Merodach prisoner, and dispatched him to Nineveh. Then he wreaked his vengeance
on Babylon. For several days the Assyrian soldiers looted
the houses and temples, and slaughtered the inhabitants
without mercy. E-sagila was robbed of its treasures, images of deities were either broken in pieces or sent to Nineveh: the statue of Bel-Merodach was dispatched to

Asshur so that he might take his place among the gods
who were vassals of Ashur. " The city and its houses,"
Sennacherib recorded, " from foundation to roof, I de
stroyed them, I demolished them, I burned them with
fire ; walls, gateways, sacred chapels, and the towers of earth and tiles, I laid them low and cast them into the Arakhtu." 1 " So thorough was Sennacherib's destruction of the
city in 689 B.C.," writes Mr. King, "that after several
years of work, Dr. Koldewey concluded that all traces
of earlier buildings had been destroyed on that occasion.
More recently some remains of earlier strata have been
recognized, and contract-tablets have been found which
date from the period of the First Dynasty. Moreover, a number of earlier pot-burials have been unearthed, but a careful examination of the greater part of the ruins has
added little to our knowledge of this most famous city
before the Neo-Babylonian period."
2
It is possible that Sennacherib desired to supplant
Babylon as a commercial metropolis by Nineveh. He
extended and fortified that city, surrounding it with two
walls protected by moats. According to Diodorus, the walls were a hundred feet high and about fifty feet wide. Excavators have found that at the gates they were about
a hundred feet in breadth. The water supply of the
city was ensured by the construction of dams and canals,
and strong quays were erected to prevent flooding. Sennacherib repaired a lofty platform which was isolated
by a canal, and erected upon it his great palace. On another platform he had an arsenal built.
Sennacherib's palace was the most magnificent building of its kind ever erected by an Assyrian emperor. It was

470 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
lavishly decorated, and its bas-reliefs display native art
at its highest pitch of excellence. The literary remains of
the time also give indication of the growth of culture: the
inscriptions are distinguished by their prose style. It is
evident that men of culture and refinement were numerous
in Assyria. The royal library of Kalkhi received many
additions during the reign of the destroyer of Babylon. Like his father, Sennacherib died a violent death.
According to the Babylonian Chronicle he was slain in
a revolt by his son " on the twentieth day of Tebet "
(680 B.C.). The revolt continued from the " 2oth of
Tebet "
(early in January) until the 2nd day of Adar (the
middle of February). On the i8th of Adar, Esarhaddon,
son of Sennacherib, was proclaimed king. Berosus states that Sennacherib was murdered by two of his sons, but Esarhaddon was not one of the con
spirators. The Biblical reference is as follows : " Senna
cherib . . . dwelt at Nineveh. And it came to pass, as
he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch (PAshur) his
god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer (Ashur-shar-etir) his sons smote him with the sword : and they escaped
into the land of Armenia (Urartu). And Esarhaddon
his son reigned in his stead. " Ashur-shar-etir appears
to have been the claimant to the throne.
Esarhaddon (680-668 B.C.) was a man of different type
from his father. He adopted towards vassal states a policy
of conciliation, and did much to secure peace within the
empire by his magnanimous treatment of rebel kings who had been intimidated by their neighbours and forced to entwine themselves in the meshes of intrigue. His wars
were directed mainly to secure the protection of outlying
provinces against aggressive raiders. The monarch was strongly influenced by his mother,
Naki'a, a Babylonian princess who appears to have been



ASSYRIA'S AGE OF SPLENDOUR 471
as distinguished a lady as the famous Sammu-rammat.
Indeed, it is possible that traditions regarding her contributed to the Semiramis legends. But it was not only
due to her that Esarhaddon espoused the cause of the
pro-Babylonian party. He appears to be identical with
the Axerdes of Berosus, who ruled over the southern
kingdom for eight years. Apparently he had been appointed governor by Sennacherib after the destruction of
Babylon, and it may be that during his term of office in
Babylonia he was attracted by its ethical ideals, and de
veloped those traits of character which distinguished him
from his father and grandfather. He married a Baby
lonian princess, and one of his sons, Shamash-shum-ukin,
was born in a Babylonian palace, probably at Sippar. He was a worshipper of the mother goddess Ishtar of Nineveh
and Ishtar of Arbela, and of Shamash, as well as of the
national god Ashur. As soon as Esarhaddon came to the throne he under
took the restoration of Babylon, to which many of the
inhabitants were drifting back. In three years the city
resumed its pre-eminent position as a trading and indus
trial centre. Withal, he won the hearts of the natives
by expelling Chaldaeans from the private estates which
they had seized during the Merodach-Baladan regime,
and restoring them to the rightful heirs.
A Chaldaean revolt was inevitable. Two of Merodach
Baladan's sons gave trouble in the south, but were routed
in battle. One fled to Elarn, where he was assassinated ;
the other sued for peace, and was accepted by the diplomatic Esarhaddon as a vassal king.
Egypt was intriguing in the west. Its Ethiopian king, Taharka (the Biblical Tirhakah) had stirred up
Hezekiah to revolt during Sennacherib's reign. An
Assyrian ambassador who had visited Jerusalem " heard



472 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
say concerning Tirhakah. . . . He sent messengers to
Hezekiah saying . . . Let not thy God, in whom thou
trustest, deceive thee saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria. Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands
by destroying them utterly; and shalt thou be delivered?
Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my
fathers have destroyed, as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph,
and the children of Eden which were in Telassar ? Where
is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arphad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah?" 1
Sidon was a party to the pro-Egyptian league which had been formed in Palestine and Syria.
Early in his reign Esarhaddon conducted military
operations in the west, and during his absence the queen
mother Naki'a held the reins of government. The Elam
ites regarded this innovation as a sign of weakness, and
invaded Babylon. Sippar was plundered, and its gods
carried away. The Assyrian governors, however, ulti
mately repulsed the Elamite king, who was deposed soon
after he returned home. His son, who succeeded him,
restored the stolen gods, and cultivated good relations
with Esarhaddon, There was great unrest in Elam at
this period: it suffered greatly from the inroads of Median
and Persian pastoral fighting folk. In the north the Cimmerians and Scythians, who were
constantly warring against Urartu, and against each other, had spread themselves westward and east. Esarhaddon drove Cimmerian invaders out of Cappadocia, and they
swamped Phrygia.
The Scythian peril on the north-east frontier was,
however, of more pronounced character. The fierce mountaineers had allied themselves with Median tribes
1 Isaiah^ xxxvii, 8-13.



ASSYRIA'S AGE OF SPLENDOUR 473
and overrun the buffer State of the Mannai. Both Urartu
and Assyria were sufferers from the brigandage of these
allies. Esarhaddon's generals, however, were able to deal
with the situation, and one of the notable results of the
pacification of the north-eastern area was the conclusion of an alliance with Urartu.
The most serious situation with which the emperor
had to deal was in the west. The King of Sidon, who
had been so greatly favoured by Sennacherib, had espoused
the Egyptian cause. He allied himself with the King of
Cilicia, who, however, was unable to help him much.
Sidon was besieged and captured; the royal allies escaped, but a few years later were caught and beheaded. The
famous seaport was destroyed, and its vast treasures de
ported to Assyria (about 676 B.C.). Esarhaddon replaced it by a new city called Kar-Esarhaddon, which formed the nucleus of the new Sidon.
It is believed that Judah and other disaffected States were dealt with about this time. Manasseh had succeeded Hezekiah at Jerusalem when but a boy of twelve
years. He appears to have come under the influence of
heathen teachers.
For he built up again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he reared up altars for Baal, and made a
grove, as did Ahab king of Israel ; and worshipped all the host of
heaven, and served them. . . . And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the Lord. And he made his son pass through the fire, and observed times, and used enchantments, and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards: he wrought much wickedness in the sight of the Lord, to provoke
him to anger. And he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the house, of which the Lord said to David, and to
Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever,1
1 2 Kings, xxi, 3-7.



474 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
Isaiah ceased to prophesy after Manasseh came to
the throne. According to Rabbinic traditions he was seized by his enemies and enclosed in the hollow trunk of a tree, which was sawn through. Other orthodox
teachers appear to have been slain also. " Manasseh
shed innocent blood very much, till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another/ 11 It is possible that
there is a reference to Isaiah's fate in an early Christian
lament regarding the persecutions of the faithful : "Others
had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover
of bonds and imprisonment : they were stoned, they were sawn asunder^ were tempted, were slain with the sword ". 2
There is no Assyrian evidence regarding the captivity of
Manasseh. " Wherefore the Lord brought upon them
(the people of Judah) the captains of the host of the king of Assyria, which took Manasseh among the thorns, and
bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon.
And when he was in affliction, he besought the Lord his
God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his
fathers, and prayed unto him : and he was intreated of
him, and heard his supplication, and brought him again
to Jerusalem into his kingdom. " 3 It was, however, in keeping with the policy of Esarhaddon to deal in this
manner with an erring vassal. The Assyrian records include Manasseh of Judah (Menas6 of the city of Yaudu)
with the kings of Edom, Moab, Ammon, Tyre, Ashdod,
Gaza, Byblos, &c., and " twenty-two kings of Khatti " as payers of tribute to Esarhaddon, their overlord. Hazael
of Arabia was conciliated by having restored to him his gods which Sennacherib had carried away.
Egypt continued to intrigue against Assyria, and Esar
1 a Kings, xxi, 1 6. * Hebrews, xi, 36, 37. *2 Chronicle^ xxxiii, 11-3. It may be that Manasseh was taken to Babylon during Ashur-bani-pal's reign. See next chapter.



ASSYRIA'S AGE OF SPLENDOUR 475
haddon resolved to deal effectively with Taharka, the last
Ethiopian Pharaoh. In 674 B.C. he invaded Egypt, but suffered a reverse and had to retreat. Tyre revolted soon
afterwards (673 B.C.).
Esarhaddon, however, made elaborate preparations for his next campaign. In 671 B.C. he went westward with
a much more powerful army. A detachment advanced to
Tyre and invested it. The main force meanwhile pushed
on, crossed the Delta frontier, and swept victoriously as far south as Memphis, where Taharka suffered a crushing
defeat. That great Egyptian metropolis was then occupied
and plundered by the soldiers of Esarhaddon. Lower
Egypt became an Assyrian province; the various petty
kings, including Necho of Sais, had set over them Assyrian
governors. Tyre was also captured.
When he returned home Esarhaddon erected at the
Syro-Cappadocian city of Singirli
1 a statue of victory, which
is now in the Berlin museum. On this memorial the
Assyrian " King of the kings of Egypt " is depicted as a
giant. With one hand he pours out an oblation to a god; in the other he grasps his sceptre and two cords attached
to rings, which pierce the lips of dwarfish figures representing the Pharaoh Taharka of Egypt and the unfaithful
King of Tyre.
In 668 B.C. Taharka, who had fled to Napata in
Ethiopia, returned to Upper Egypt, and began to stir up
revolts. Esarhaddon planned out another expedition, so
that he might shatter the last vestige of power possessed
by his rival. But before he left home he found it neces
sary to set his kingdom in order.
During his absence from home the old Assyrian party,
who disliked the emperor because of Babylonian sym
pathies, had been intriguing regarding the succession to

the throne. According to the Babylonian Chronicle, "the
king remained in Assyria" during 669 B.C., "and he slew with the sword many noble men". Ashur-bani-pal was
evidently concerned in the conspiracy, and it is significant to find that he pleaded on behalf of certain of the con
spirators. The crown prince Sinidinabal was dead: per
haps he had been assassinated.
At the feast of the goddess Gula (identical with Bau,
consort of Ninip), towards the end of April, in 668 B.C.,
Esarhaddon divided his empire between two of his sons.
Ashur-bani-pal was selected to be King of Assyria, and Shamash-shum-ukin to be King of Babylon and the vassal
of Ashur-banipal. Other sons received important priestly
appointments. Soon after these arrangements were completed Esar
haddon, who was suffering from bad health, set out for
Egypt. He died towards the end of October, and the
early incidents of his campaign were included in the
records of Ashur-bani-pal's reign. Taharka was defeated
at Memphis, and retreated southward to Thebes.
So passed away the man who has been eulogized as
"the noblest and most sympathetic figure among the
Assyrian kings ". There was certainly much which was
attractive in his character. He inaugurated many social
reforms, and appears to have held in check his overbear
ing nobles. Trade flourished during his reign. He did
not undertake the erection of a new city, like his father,
but won the gratitude of the priesthood by his activities
as a builder and restorer of temples. He founded a new
"house of Ashur" at Nineveh, and reconstructed several
temples in Babylonia. His son Ashur-bani-pal was the
last great Assyrian ruler,

Against a gloomy background, dark and ominous as
a thundercloud, we have revealed in the last century of
Mesopotamia!! glory the splendour of Assyria and the

quickly before the end came. Kings still revelled in
pomp and luxury. Cities resounded with " the noise of

An obscure sense

1 Goodtpced'i A Hittory of th Babylonians and Assyrians, p. 348,



480 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
the threshold of a new age, when their doom was sounded
and their power was shattered for ever. Nineveh perished
with dramatic suddenness: Babylon died of" senile decay ".
When, in 668 B.C., intelligence reached Nineveh that Esarhaddon had passed away, on the march through Egypt, the arrangements which he had made for the suc
cession were carried out smoothly and quickly. Naki'a,
the queen mother, was acting as regent, and completed her lifework by issuing a proclamation exhorting all loyal
subjects and vassals to obey the new rulers, her grandsons,
Ashur-bani-pal, Emperor of Assyria, and Shamash-shumukin, King of Babylon. Peace prevailed in the capital, and there was little or no friction throughout the pro
vinces: new rulers were appointed to administer the States
of Arvad and Ammon, but there were no changes elsewhere.
Babylon welcomed its new king a Babylonian by
birth and the son of a Babylonian princess. The ancient
kingdom rejoiced that it was no longer to be ruled as a
province; its ancient dignities and privileges were being
partially restored. But one great and deep-seated griev
ance remained. The god Merodach was still a captive in
the temple of Ashur. No king could reign aright if Merodach were not restored to E-sagila. Indeed he
could not be regarded as the lord of the land until he had "taken the hands of Bel".
The ceremony of taking the god's hands was an act
of homage. When it was consummated the king became
the steward or vassal of Merodach, and every day he
appeared before the divine one to receive instructions and
worship him. The welfare of the whole kingdom depended on the manner in which the king acted towards
the god. If Merodach was satisfied with the king he sent
blessings to the land ; if he was angry he sent calamities.



THE LAST DAYS OF ASSYRIA 481
A pious and faithful monarch was therefore the protector
of the people. This close association of the king with the god gave
the priests great influence in Babylon. They were the
power behind the throne. The destinies of the royal
house were placed in their hands ; they could strengthen the position of a royal monarch, or cause him to be de
posed if he did not satisfy their demands. A king who
reigned over Babylon without the priestly party on his
side occupied an insecure position. Nor could he secure
the co-operation of the priests unless the image of the
god was placed in the temple. Where king was, there Merodach had to be also. Shamash-shum-ukin pleaded with his royal brother and overlord to restore Bel Merodach to Babylon. Ashur
bani-pal hesitated for a time; he was unwilling to occupy
a less dignified position, as the representative of Ashur, than his distinguished predecessor, in his relation to the
southern kingdom. At length, however, he was prevailed upon to consult the oracle of Shamash, the solar lawgiver,
the revealer of destiny. The god was accordingly asked
if Shamash-shum-ukin could " take the hands of Bel " in
Ashur's temple, and then proceed to Babylon as his representative. In response, the priests of Shamash informed
the emperor that Bel Merodach could not exercise sway
as sovereign lord so long as he remained a prisoner in a city which was not his own.
Ashur-bani-pal accepted the verdict, and then visited Ashur's temple to plead with Bel Merodach to return to
Babylon. "Let thy thoughts'*, he cried, "dwell in Babylon, which in thy wrath thou didst bring to naught. Let thy face be turned towards E-sagila, thy lofty and
divine temple. Return to the city thou hast deserted for
a house unworthy of thee. O Merodach ! lord of the



482 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
gods, issue thou the command to return again to
Babylon.
Thus did Ashur-bani-pal make pious and dignified
submission to the will of the priests. A favourable re
sponse was, of course, received from Merodach when addressed by the emperor, and the god's image was carried
back to E-sagila, accompanied by a strong force. Ashurbani-pal and Shamash-shum-ukin led the procession of
priests and soldiers, and elaborate ceremonials were ob
served at each city they passed, the local gods being carried forth to do homage to Merodach.
Babylon welcomed the deity who was thus restored
to his temple after the lapse of about a quarter of a
century, and the priests celebrated with unconcealed satis
faction and pride the ceremony at which Shamash-shum
ukin " took the hands of Bel ". The public rejoicings
were conducted on an elaborate scale. Babylon believed
that a new era of prosperity had been inaugurated, and the priests and nobles looked forward to the day when
the kingdom would once again become free and indepen
dent and powerful. Ashur-bani-pal (668-626 B.C.) made arrangements to
complete his father's designs regarding Egypt. His Tartan continued the campaign, and Taharka, as has been
stated, was driven from Memphis. The beaten Pharaoh
returned to Ethiopia and did not again attempt to expel
the Assyrians. He died in 666 B.C. It was found that some of the petty kings of Lower Egypt had been in
triguing with Taharka, and their cities were severely dealt
with. Necho of Sais had to be arrested, among others,
but was pardoned after he appeared before Ashur-bani-pal,
and sent back to Egypt as the Assyrian governor. Tanutamon, a son of Pharaoh Shabaka, succeeded Taharka, and in 663 B.C. marched northward from Thebes



THE LAST DAYS OF ASSYRIA 483
with a strong army. He captured Memphis. It is believed Necho was slain, and Herodotus relates that his son Psamtik took refuge in Syria. In 66 1 B.C. Ashur
bani-pal's army swept through Lower Egypt and expelled the Ethiopians. Tanutamon fled southward, but on this
occasion the Assyrians followed up their success, and
besieged and captured Thebes, which they sacked. Its nobles were slain or taken captive. According to the
prophet Nahum, who refers to Thebes as No (Nu-Amon
=
city of Amon), " her young children also were dashed
in pieces at the top of all the streets: and they (the
Assyrians) cast lots for her honourable men, and all her
great men were bound in chains' 1
.
1 Thebes never again
recovered its prestige. Its treasures were transported to
Nineveh. The Ethiopian supremacy in Egypt was finally
extinguished, and Psamtik, son of Necho, who was appointed the Pharaoh, began to reign as the vassal of
Assyria.
When the kings on the seacoasts of Palestine and Asia Minor found that they could no longer look to
Egypt for help, they resigned themselves to the inevitable, and ceased to intrigue against Assyria. Gifts were sent to
Ashur-bani-pal by the kings of Arvad, Tyre, Tarsus, and
Tabal. The Arvad ruler, however, was displaced, and his son set on his throne. But the most extraordinary de
velopment was the visit to Nineveh of emissaries from
Gyges, king of Lydia, who figures in the legends of Greece. This monarch had been harassed by the Cim
merians after they accomplished the fall of Midas of
Phrygia in 676 B.C., and he sought the help of Ashur
bani-pal. It is not known whether the Assyrians operated against the Cimmerians in Tabal, but, as Gyges did not
send tribute, it would appear that he held his own with

the aid of mercenaries from the State of Caria in southwestern Asia Minor. The Greeks of Cilicia, and the Achaeans and Phoenicians of Cyprus remained faithful to
Assyria. Elam gave trouble in 665 B.C. by raiding Akkad, but the Assyrian army repulsed the invaders at Dur-ilu and
pushed on to Susa. The Elamites received a crushing
defeat in a battle on the banks of the River Ula. King
Teumman was slain, and a son of the King of Urtagu was
placed on his throne. Elam thus came under Assyrian
swayT.he most surprising and sensational conspiracy against Ashur-bani-pal was fomented by his brother Shamash
shum-ukin of Babylon, after the two had co-operated
peacefully for fifteen years. No doubt the priestly party at E-sagila were deeply concerned in the movement, and the king may have been strongly influenced by the fact
that Babylonia was at the time suffering from severe
depression caused by a series of poor harvests. Merodach,
according to the priests, was angry ; it was probably
argued that he was punishing the people because they had not thrown off the yoke of Assyria.
The temple treasures of Babylon were freely drawn
upon to purchase the allegiance of allies. Ere Ashur
bani-pal had any knowledge of the conspiracy his brother
had won over several governors in Babylonia, the Chal
daeans, Aramaeans and Elamites, and many petty kings in Palestine and Syria: even Egypt and Libya were prepared to help him. When, however, the faithful governor of
Ur was approached, he communicated with his superior
at Erech, who promptly informed Ashur-bani-pal of the
great conspiracy. The intelligence reached Nineveh like a bolt from the blue. The emperor's heart was filled
with sorrow and anguish. In after-time he lamented in



THE LAST DAYS OF ASSYRIA 485
an inscription that his " faithless brother "
forgot the
favours he had shown him. " Outwardly with his lips
he spoke friendly things, while inwardly his heart plotted murder."
In 652 B.C. Shamash-shum-ukin precipitated the crisis
by forbidding Ashur-bani-pal to make offerings to the
gods in the cities of Babylonia. He thus declared his
independence.
War broke out simultaneously. Ur and Erech were
besieged and captured by the Chaldseans, and an Elamite army marched to the aid of the King of Babylon, but it was withdrawn before long on account of the unsettled
political conditions at home. The Assyrian armies swept through Babylonia, and the Chaldaeans in the south were
completely subjugated before Babylon was captured.
That great commercial metropolis was closely besieged
for three years, and was starved into submission. When
the Assyrians were entering the city gates a sensational happening occurred. Shamash-shum-ukin, the rebel king, shut himself up in his palace and set fire to it, and
perished there amidst the flames with his wife and chil
dren, his slaves and all his treasures. Ashur-bani-pal was
in 647 B.C. proclaimed King Kandalanu 1 of Babylon, and reigned over it until his death in 626 B.C.
Elam was severely dealt with. That unhappy country
was terribly devastated by Assyrian troops, who besieged and captured Susa, which was pillaged and wrecked. It was recorded afterwards as a great triumph of this campaign that the statue of Nana of Erech, which had been
carried off by Elamites 1635 years previously, was recovered and restored to the ancient Sumerian city. Elam's
power of resistance was finally extinguished, and the
country fell a ready prey to the Medes and Persians, who

486 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
soon entered into possession of it. Thus, by destroying
a buffer State, Ashur-bani-pal strengthened the hands of
the people who were destined twenty years after his death
to destroy the Empire of Assyria.
The western allies of Babylon were also dealt with, and it may be that at this time Manasseh of Judah was
taken to Babylon (2 Chronicles , xxxiii, 1 i), where, how
ever, he was forgiven. The Medes and the Mannai in the north-west were visited and subdued, and a new alliance was formed with the dying State of Urartu.
Psamtik of Egypt had thrown off the yoke of Assyria, and with the assistance of Carian mercenaries received
from his ally, Gyges, king of Lydia, extended his sway
southward. He made peace with Ethiopia by marrying a princess of its royal line. Gyges must have weakened
his army by thus assisting Psamtik, for he was severely defeated and slain by the Cimmerians. His son, Ardys,
appealed to Assyria for help. Ashur-bani-pal dispatched an army to Cilicia. The joint operations of Assyria and Lydia resulted in the extinction of the kingdom of the Cimmerians about 645 B.C.
The records of Ashur-bani-pal cease after 640 B.C., so that we are unable to follow the events of his reign
during its last fourteen years. Apparently peace prevailed
everywhere. The great monarch, who was a pronounced adherent of the goddess cults, appears to have given himself up to a life of indulgence and inactivity. Under the
name Sardanapalus he went down to tradition as a sensual Oriental monarch who lived in great pomp and luxury, and
perished in his burning palace when the Medes revolted
against him. It is evident, however, that the memory of
more than one monarch contributed to the Sardanapalus
legend, for Ashur-bani-pal had lain nearly twenty years in his grave before the siege of Nineveh took place.

In the Bible he is referred to as " the great and noble
Asnapper", and he appears to have been the emperor who
settled the Babylonian, Elamite, and other colonists " in the cities of Samaria".1
He erected at Nineveh a magnificent palace, which
was decorated on a lavish scale. The sculptures are the
finest productions of Assyrian art, and embrace a wide
variety of subjects battle scenes, hunting scenes, and elaborate Court and temple ceremonies. Realism is combined with a delicacy of touch and a degree of
originality which raises the artistic productions of the
period to the front rank among the artistic triumphs of
antiquity.
Ashur-bani-pal boasted of the thorough education which he had received from the tutors of his illustrious
father, Esarhaddon. In his palace he kept a magnificent library. It contained thousands of clay tablets on which
were inscribed and translated the classics of Babylonia.
To the scholarly zeal of this cultured monarch is due the
preservation of the Babylonian story of creation, the Gil
gamesh and Etana legends, and other literary and religious
products of remote antiquity. Most of the literary tablets
in the British Museum were taken from Ashur-bani-paFs
library. There are no Assyrian records of the reigns of Ashur
bani-pal's two sons, Ashur-etil-ilani who erected a small
palace and reconstructed the temple to Nebo at Kalkhi
and Sin-shar-ishkun, who is supposed to have perished in Nineveh. Apparently Ashur-etil-ilani reigned for at least
six years, and was succeeded by his brother.
A year after Ashur-bani-pal died, Nabopolassar, who was probably a Chaldaean, was proclaimed king at Babylon. According to Babylonian legend he was an Assyrian general
1 E*ra, iv, 10.



4 88 MYTHS OF BABYLONIA
who had been sent southward with an army to oppose
the advance of invaders from the sea. Nabopolassar's
sway at first was confined to Babylon and Borsippa, but
he strengthened himself by forming an offensive and de
fensive alliance with the Median king, whose daughter he
had married to his son Nebuchadrezzar. He strengthened
the fortifications of Babylon, rebuilt the temple of Mero
dach, which had been destroyed by Ashur-bani-pal, and waged war successfully against the Assyrians and their
allies in Mesopotamia. About 606 B.C. Nineveh fell, and Sin-shar-ishkun may
have burned himself there in his palace, like his uncle, Shamash-shum-ukin of Babylon, and the legendary Sar
danapalus. It is not certain, however, whether the Scythians or the Medes were the successful besiegers of the great
Assyrian capital. "Woe to the bloody city! it is all full
of lies and robbery", Nahum had cried. "... The gates of the rivers shall be opened, and the palace shall be dis
solved. . . . Take ye the spoil of silver, take the spoil
of gold. . . . Behold, I am against thee, saith the Lord of hosts." 1
According to Herodotus, an army of Medes under
Cyaxares had defeated the Assyrians and were besieging Nineveh when the Scythians overran Media. Cyaxares
raised the siege and went against them, but was defeated.
Then the Scythians swept across Assyria and Mesopotamia, and penetrated to the Delta frontier of Egypt. Psamtik ransomed his kingdom with handsome gifts.
At length, however, Cyaxares had the Scythian leaders
slain at a banquet, and then besieged and captured Nineveh. Assyria was completely overthrown. Those of its
nobles and priests who escaped the sword no doubt

escaped to Babylonia. Some may have found refuge also in Palestine and Egypt.
Necho, the second Pharaoh of the Twenty -sixth
Egyptian Dynasty, did not hesitate to take advantage of
Assyria's fall. In 609 B.C. he proceeded to recover the
long-lost Asiatic possessions of Egypt, and operated with an army and fleet. Gaza and Askalon were captured.
Josiah, the grandson of Manasseh, was King of Judah.
" In his days Pharaoh-nechoh king of Egypt went up
against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king Josiah went against him; and he (Necho) slew him at Megiddo." l His son, Jehoahaz, succeeded him, but
was deposed three months later by Necho, who placed
another son of Josiah, named Eliakim, on the throne>
u and turned his name to Jehoiakim".2 The people were
heavily taxed to pay tribute to the Pharaoh.
When Necho pushed northward towards the Euphrates
he was met by a Babylonian army under command of
Prince Nebuchadrezzar.3 The Egyptians were routed at
Carchemish in 605 B.C. (Jeremiah, xvi, 2). In 604 B.C. Nabopolassar died, and the famous Nebu
chadrezzar II ascended the throne of Babylon. He lived
to be one of its greatest kings, and reigned for over forty years. It was he who built the city described by Herodotus (pp. 219 et seq.\ and constructed its outer wall, which
enclosed so large an area that no army could invest it.
Merodach's temple was decorated with greater magni
ficence than ever before. The great palace and hanging
gardens were erected by this mighty monarch, who no doubt attracted to the city large numbers of the skilled
artisans who had fled from Nineveh. He also restored
temples at other cities, and made generous gifts to the

priests. Captives were drafted into Babylonia from various
lands, and employed cleaning out the canals and as farm
labourers.
The trade and industries of Babylon flourished greatly, and Nebuchadrezzar's soldiers took speedy vengeance on
roving bands which infested the caravan roads. " The
king of Egypt ", after his crushing defeat at Carchemish,
" came not again any more out of his land : for the king
of Babylon had taken from the river of Egypt unto the
river Euphrates all that pertained to the king of Egypt." 1 Jehoiakim of Judah remained faithful to Necho until he
was made a prisoner by Nebuchadrezzar, who " bound
him in fetters to carry him to Babylon ", 2 He was after
wards sent back to Jerusalem. "And Jehoiakim became
his (Nebuchadrezzar's) servant three years: then he turned
and rebelled against him." 3
Bands of Chaldseans, Syrians, Moabites, and Ammonites were harassing the frontiers of Judah, and it seemed
to the king as if the Babylonian power had collapsed. Nebuchadrezzar hastened westward and scattered the
raiders before him. Jehoiakim died, and his son Jehoi
achan, a youth of eighteen years, succeeded him. Nebu
chadrezzar laid siege to Jerusalem, and the young king submitted to him and was carried off to Babylon, with
"all the princes, and all the mighty men of valour, even ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and smiths:
none remained save the poorest sort of the people of the land". 4 Nebuchadrezzar had need of warriors and workmen. Zedekiah was placed on the throne of Judah as an
Assyrian vassal. He remained faithful for a few years,
but at length began to conspire with Tyre and Sidon,

Moab, Edom, and Ammon in favour of Egyptian suze
rainty. Pharaoh Hophra (Apries), the fourth king of
the Twenty-sixth Dynasty, took active steps to assist the
conspirators, and " Zedekiah rebelled against the king of
Babylon". 1 Nebuchadrezzar led a strong army through Mesopotamia, and divided it at Riblah, on the Orontes River.
One part of it descended upon Judah and captured Lachish and Azekah. Jerusalem was able to hold out
for about eighteen months. Then " the famine was sore in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of
the land. Then the city was broken up, and all the men
of war fled, and went forth out of the city by night by way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the
king's garden." Zedekiah attempted to escape, but was
captured and carried before Nebuchadrezzar, who was at Riblah, in the land of Hamath.
And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his
eyes. . . . Then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him in chains and carried him to Babylon and
put him in prison till the day of his death.2
The majority of the Jews were deported to Babylonia,
where they were employed as farm labourers. Some rose
to occupy important official positions. A remnant escaped to Egypt with Jeremiah.
Jerusalem was plundered and desolated. The Assy
rians " burned the house of the Lord and the king's
house, and all the houses of Jerusalem ", and " brake
down all the walls of Jerusalem round about ". Jeremiah lamented :

Tyre was besieged, but was not captured. Its king, however, arranged terms of peace with Nebuchadrezzar.
Amel-Marduk, the " Evil Merodach " of the Bible,
the next king of Babylon, reigned for a little over two
years. He released Jehoiachin from prison, and allowed him to live in the royal palace.
2 Berosus relates that
Amel-Marduk lived a dissipated life, and was slain by his
brother-in-law, Nergal-shar-utsur, who reigned two years (559-6 B.C.). Labashi-Marduk, son of Nergal-shar-utsur,
followed with a reign of nine months. He was deposed
by the priests. Then a Babylonian prince named Nabu
na'id (Nabonidus) was set on the throne. He was the
last independent king of Babylonia. His son Belshazzar appears to have acted as regent during the latter part of
the reign. Nabonidus engaged himself actively during his reign
(556-540 B.C.) in restoring temples. He entirely reconstructed the house of Shamash, the sun god, at Sippar, and,
towards the end of his reign, the house of Sin, the moon
god, at Haran. The latter building had been destroyed by the Medes.
The religious innovations of Nabonidus made him
exceedingly unpopular throughout Babylonia, for he carried away the gods of Ur, Erech, Larsa, and Eridu,

and had them placed in E-sagila. Merodach and his
priests were displeased: the prestige of the great god was
threatened by the policy adopted by Nabonidus. As an
inscription composed after the fall of Babylon sets forth 5
Merodach " gazed over the surrounding lands . t . look
ing for a righteous prince, one after his own heart,
who should take his hands. . . . He called by name
Cyrus." Cyrus was a petty king of the shrunken Elamite
province of Anshan, which had been conquered by the
Persians. He claimed to be an Achaemenian that is a descendant of the semi-mythical Akhamanish (the Achaemenes of the Greeks), a Persian patriarch who resembled
the Aryo-Indian Manu and the Germanic Mannus. Akhamanish was reputed to have been fed and protected in
childhood by an eagle-t-the sacred eagle which cast its
shadow on born rulers. Probably this eagle was remotely Totemic, and the Achaemenians were descendants of an
ancient eagle tribe. Gilgamesh was protected by an eagle, as we have seen, as the Aryo-Indian Shakuntala was by
vultures and Semiramis by doves. The legends regarding
the birth and boyhood of Cyrus resemble those related
regarding Sargon of Akkad and the Indian Kama and Krishna.
Cyrus acknowledged as his overlord Astyages, king
of the Medes. He revolted against Astyages, whom he defeated and took prisoner. Thereafter he was proclaimed
King of the Medes and Persians, who were kindred peoples
of Indo-European speech. The father of Astyages was
Cyaxares, the ally of Nabopolassar of Babylon. When this powerful king captured Nineveh he entered into possession of the northern part of the Assyrian Empire, which extended westward into Asia Minor to the frontier of the
Lydian kingdom ; he also possessed hirftself of Urartu

(Armenia). Lydia had, after the collapse of the Cimmerian power, absorbed Phrygia, and its ambitious king,
Alyattes, waged war against the Medes. At length, owing to the good offices of Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon and
Syennesis of Cilicia, the Medes and Lydians made peace in 585 B.C. Astyages then married a daughter of the
Lydian ruler.
When Cyrus overthrew Cyaxares, king of the Medes, Croesus, king of Lydia, formed an alliance against him with Amasis, king of Egypt, and Nabonidus, king of
Babylon. The latter was at first friendly to Cyrus, who
had attacked Cyaxares when he was advancing on Babylon to dispute Nabonidus's claim to the throne, and perhaps
to win it for a descendant of Nebuchadrezzar, his father's
ally. It was after the fall of the Median Dynasty that
Nabonidus undertook the restoration of the moon god's
temple at Haran. Cyrus advanced westward against Croesus of Lydia
before that monarch could receive assistance from the
intriguing but pleasure-loving Amasis of Egypt ; he defeated and overthrew him, and seized his kingdom (547
546 B.C.). Then, having established himself as supreme
ruler in Asia Minor, he began to operate against Babylonia. In 539 B.C. Belshazzar was defeated near Opis. Sippar
fell soon afterwards. Cyrus's general, Gobryas, then advanced upon Babylon, where Belshazzar deemed him
self safe. One night, in the month of Tammuz
Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and drank wine before the thousand. Belshazzar, whiles he
tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple
which was in Jerusalem; that the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, might drink therein. . . . They drank wine,
and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron ? of

wood, and of stone. ... In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain. 1
On the 1 6th of Tammuz the investing army under
Gobryas entered Babylon, the gates having been opened
by friends within the city. Some think that the Jews
favoured the cause of Cyrus. It is quite as possible,
however, that the priests of Merodach had a secret under
standing with the great Achsemenian, the "King of kings".
A few days afterwards Cyrus arrived at Babylon. Belshazzar had been slain, but Nabonidus still lived, and he was deported to Carmania. Perfect order prevailed
throughout the city, which was firmly policed by the Persian soldiers, and there was no looting. Cyrus was
welcomed as a deliverer by the priesthood. He <c took the hands" of Bel Merodach at E-sagila, and was pro
claimed " King of the world, King of Babylon, King of
Sumer and Akkad, and King of the Four Quarters ".
Cyrus appointed his son Cambyses as governor of
Babylon. Although a worshipper of Ahura-Mazda and Mithra, Cambyses appears to have conciliated the priest
hood. When he became king, and swept through Egypt,
he was remembered as the madman who in a fit of passion
slew a sacred Apis bull. It is possible, however, that he
performed what he considered to be a pious act : he may have sacrificed the bull to Mithra.
The Jews also welcomed Cyrus. They yearned for
their native land.
By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept,
when we remembered Zion. We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof. For there they that carried us away
captive required of us a song; and they that wasted us required of

Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the Lord
stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing,
saying, Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, The Lord God of heaven
hath given me all kingdoms of the earth; and he hath charged me
to build him an house at Jerusalem, which is* in Judah. Who is
there among you of all his people? his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of
the Lord God of Israel (he is the God) which is in Jerusalem. 2
In 538 B.C. the first party of Jews who were set free
saw through tears the hills of home, and hastened their
steps to reach Mount Zion. Fifty years later Ezra led back another party of the faithful. The work of restoring Jerusalem was undertaken by Nehemiah in 445 B.C.
The trade of Babylon flourished under the Persians,
and the influence of its culture spread far and wide. Persian religion was infused with new doctrines, and their
deities were given stellar attributes. Ahura-Mazda be
came identified with Bel Merodach, as, perhaps, he had
previously been with Ashur, and the goddess Anahita
absorbed the attributes of Nina, Ishtar, Zerpanitum
, and
other Babylonian "mother deities^. Another "Semiramis" came into prominence. This
was the wife and sister of Cambyses. After Cambyses died she married Darius I, who, like Cyrus, claimed to
be an Achaemenian. He had to overthrow a pretender, but submitted to the demands of the orthodox Persian

party to purify the Ahura-Mazda religion of its Babylonian innovations. Frequent revolts in Babylon had afterwards
to be suppressed. The Merodaoh priesthood apparently suffered loss of prestige at Court. According to Herod
otus, Darius plotted to carry away from E-sagila a great
statue of Bel " twelve cubits high and entirely of solid
gold ". He, however, was afraid " to lay his hands upon
it". Xerxes, son of Darius (485-465 B.C.), punished Babylon for revolting, when intelligence reached them of
his disasters in Greece, by pillaging and partly destroying
the temple. " He killed the priest who forbade him to
move the statue, and took it away/' 1 The city lost its vassal king, and was put under the control of a governor.
It, however, regained some of its ancient glory after the burning of Susa palace, for the later Persian monarchs
resided in it Darius II died at Babylon, and Artaxerxes
II promoted in the city the worship of Anaitis.
When Darius III, the last Persian emperor, was over
thrown by Alexander the Great in 331 B.C., Babylon welcomed the Macedonian conqueror as it had welcomed Cyrus. Alexander was impressed by the wisdom and
accomplishments of the astrologers and priests, who had
become known as " Chaldaeans", and added Bel Merodach
to his extraordinary pantheon, which already included
Amon of Egypt, Melkarth, and Jehovah. Impressed by
the antiquity and magnificence of Babylon, he resolved to make it the capital of his world-wide empire, and there
he received ambassadors from countries as far east as India and as far west as Gaul.
The canals of Babylonia were surveyed, and building
operations on a vast scale planned out. No fewer than
ten thousand men were engaged working for two months
reconstructing and decorating the temple of Merodach,

which towered to a height of 607 feet. It looked as if
Babylon were about to rise to a position of splendour unequalled in its history, when Alexander fell sick, after
attending a banquet, and died on an evening of golden splendour sometime in June of 323 B.C.
One can imagine the feelings of the Babylonian priests
and astrologers as they spent the last few nights of the emperor's life reading "the omens of the air" taking note of wind and shadow, moon and stars and planets, seeking for a sign, but unable to discover one favourable.
Their hopes of Babylonian glory were suspended in the
balance, and they perished completely when the young emperor passed away in the thirty-third year of his life. For four days and four nights the citizens mourned in
silence for Alexander and for Babylon.
The ancient city fell into decay under the empire of
the Seleucidae. Seleucus I had been governor of Babylon, and after the break-up of Alexander's empire he returned
to the ancient metropolis as a conqueror. " None of the
persons who succeeded Alexander", Strabo wrote, "attended to the undertaking at Babylon" the reconstruction
of Merodach's temple. " Other works were neglected,
and the city was dilapidated partly by the Persians and partly by time and through the indifference of the Greeks,
particularly after Seleucus Nicator fortified Seleukeia on
the Tigris."
1
Seleucus drafted to the city which bore his name the
great bulk of the inhabitants of Babylon. The remnant which was left behind continued to worship Merodach
and other gods after the walls had crumbled and the great
temple began to tumble down. Babylon died slowly, but at length the words of the Hebrew prophet were ful
filled:
1 Strabo, xvi, 1-5.

The cormorant and the bittern shall possess it; the owl also and the raven shall dwell in it. . . . They shall call the nobles thereof
to the kingdom, but none shall be there, and all her princes shall
be nothing. And thorns shall come up in her palaces, nettles and brambles in the fortresses thereof: and it shall be an habitation of
dragons, and a court for owls. The wild beasts of the desert shall
also meet with the wild beasts of the island, and the satyr shall
cry to his fellow: the screech owl also shall rest there, and find for herself a place of rest. 1
