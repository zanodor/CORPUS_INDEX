The names śirā (also hirā) and dhamani , of two different kinds of channels in the body, seem to have been
distinguished at a period as early as the Atharva-Veda...ājñā-cakra between the eyebrows, within which is the manaś
cakra , the centre of all sense-knowledge and dream-knowledge, and the seat of manas , the mind-organ.
Vijñānabhikṣu says in his Yoga-vārttika that one branch of the suṣumṇā goes upwards from here, which is the nāḍī for
carrying the functions of manas and is called mano-vahā nāḍī; the Jñāna-sarnkalinī tantra calls it jñāna-nāḍī. It
seems, therefore, that it is through this nāḍī that connection is established between the soul, residing in the brain, and
the manas , residing in the manaś-cakra.

NOTES: śataṃ hirāḥ sahasraṃ dhamanīr uta. Atharva- Veda, vii. 36. 2. Sāyana explains hirā as garbha-dhāraṇārthaṃ antar-avasthitāḥ sūkṣmā nāḍyaḥ and dhamanī as garbhāśayasya avaṣṭambhikā sthūlā nāḍyaḥ. Atharva-Veda, 1. 17.
1, 2, also seems to distinguish hirā from dhamanī. In I. 17. 1 the hirās are described as being of red garments (lohita-vāsasaḥ), which Sāyana explains as lohitasya rudhirasya nivāsa-bhūtā hi (the abode of blood) and paraphrases as rajo-vahana-nāḍyaḥ. It seems, therefore, that the larger ducts were called dhamanis.
In I. 17. 3 the Atharva-Veda speaks of huṇḍreds of dhamanīs and thousands of hirās.

This is a landmark exhibit in the Vatican showing a colossal bronze pine-cone flanked by two peacocks.
I suggest that the pine-cone and bronze peacocks are Meluhha hieroglyphs denoting metalwork in early Bronze Age.
Pigna is the Italian name of rione IX of Rome, a pine-cone. The provinience of the bronze cone has been shown to have adorned a temple for Isis and Serapis... One surmise is that the pinecone acted as a fountain in the Baths of Agrippa dated to 1st century BCE. http://roma.andreapollett.com/S5/rione09.htm This surmise is based on the evidence of a pinecone fountain.

Need for studies on extratemporal lobe epilepsy
The circadian rhythm refers to the 24-h cycle of behavioral and physiological activity. The circadian rhythmicity of mammals is a hierarchically organized multi-oscillator system, coordinated by a central pacemaker located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus... Core-Clock Gene and Epilepsy
The core-clock genes not only regulate the circadian rhythms but also contribute to epileptic susceptibility. The core-clock genes can disrupt the neuronal inhibitory and the excitatory balance rhythmically, leading to seizure periodicity.. However, the exact role of the core-clock genes in the process of epileptogenesis remains unknown. Future studies with functional assays may give us more insight... Interestingly, the expression of the CLOCK gene in epileptic brain specimens, obtained from focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) cases, is found to be reduced in epileptogenic tissue when compared to control tissue. In addition, Emx- Cre, Clockflox/flox mice with conditional deletion of CLOCK in the excitatory neurons, exhibits sleep-related seizures. Those results suggest that the disruption of the function of the core-clock genes may play an important role in the generation of focal epilepsy. However, most experiments are conducted on temporal lobe epilepsy; further studies on extratemporal lobe epilepsy are warranted. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7225332/

The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway is a critical regulator of
protein and lipid synthesis, growth, and proliferation of cells (21). A series of recent
publications have shown that the mTOR pathway is overactivated in the epileptic tissue
obtained from temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis and FCD (22, 23).
Interestingly, several results have shown that there is a close interaction between core-clock
genes and the mTOR signaling pathway. Circadian rhythmicity can be observed in the
mTOR signaling pathway (24, 25).

How is melatonin controlled? In humans and other mammals, the daily rhythm of pineal melatonin production is driven by the 'master' circadian clock. This 'clock' is in a region of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nuclei, which expresses a series of genes termed clock genes that continuously oscillate throughout the day. This is synchronised to the solar day via light input from the eyes. The suprachiasmatic nuclei link to the pineal gland through a complex pathway in the nervous system, passing through different brain areas, into the spinal cord and then finally reaching the pineal gland. During the day, the suprachiasmatic nuclei stops melatonin production by sending inhibitory messages to the pineal gland. At night however, the suprachiasmatic nuclei are less active, and the inhibition exerted during the day is reduced resulting in melatonin production by the pineal gland. Light is an important regulator of melatonin production from the pineal gland. Firstly, it can reset a specific area of the brain (the suprachiasmatic nuclei clock) and, as a result, the timing of the melatonin production. Secondly, exposure to light during the body's biological night reduces melatonin production and release. https://www.yourhormones.info/hormones/melatonin/
Melatonin is produced by various tissues in the body, although the major source is the pineal gland in the brain. Melatonin (blue) is produced naturally from the amino acid tryptophan, by the pineal gland (purple) at night-time. Night-time is detected by reduced light entering the eyes (left), and the arrow shows the melatonin secretion signal sent by the optic nerve to the pineal gland once darkness has fallen.

The Pineal Gland and Melatonin The pineal gland or epiphysis synthesizes and secretes melatonin, a structurally simple hormone that communicates information about environmental lighting to various parts of the body. Ultimately, melatonin has the ability to entrain biological rhythms and has important effects on reproductive function of many animals. The light-transducing ability of the pineal gland has led some to call the pineal the "third eye". Anatomy of the Pineal Gland The pineal gland is a small organ shaped like a pine cone (hence its name). It is located on the midline, attached to the posterior end of the roof of the third ventricle in the brain. The pineal varies in size among species; in humans it is roughly 1 cm in length, whereas in dogs it is only about 1 mm long. To observe the pineal, reflect the cerebral hemispheres laterally and look for a small grayish bump in front of the cerebellum. The images below shows the pineal gland of a horse in relation to the brain.

Histologically, the pineal is composed of "pinealocytes" and glial cells. In older animals, the pineal often is contains calcium deposits ("brain sand"). How does the retina transmit information about lightdark exposure to the pineal gland? Light exposure to the retina is first relayed to the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus, an area of the brain well known to coordinate biological clock signals. Fibers from the hypothalamus descend to the spinal cord and ultimately project to the superior cervical ganglia, from which post-ganglionic neurons ascend back to the pineal gland. Thus, the pineal is similar to the adrenal medulla in the sense that it transduces signals from the sympathetic nervous system into a hormonal signal. http://www.vivo.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/endo crine/otherendo/pineal.html
Melatonin: Synthesis, Secretion and Receptors
The precursor to melatonin is serotonin, a neurotransmitter that itself is derived from the amino acid tryptophan. Within the pineal gland, serotonin is acetylated and then methylated to yield melatonin.

Synthesis and secretion of melatonin is dramatically affected by light
exposure to the eyes. The fundamental pattern observed is that serum
concentrations of melatonin are low during the daylight hours, and
increase to a peak during the dark.
Examples of the circadian rhythm in melatonin secretion in humans is depicted in the figure to the right (adapted from Vaughn, et al, J Clin Endo Metab 42:752, 1976). The dark gray bars represent night, and serum melatonin levels are shown for two individuals (yellow versus light blue). Note that blood levels of melatonin are essentially undetectable during daytime, but rise sharply during the dark. Very similar patterns are seen in other species.The duration of melatonin
secretion each day is directly proportional to the length of the night. http://www.vivo.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/endocrine/otherendo/pin eal.html The mechanism behind this pattern of secretion during the dark cycle is that activity of the rate-limiting enzyme in melatonin synthesis - serotonin N-acetyltransferase (NAT) - is low during daylight and peaks during the dark phase. In some species, circadian changes in NAT activity are tightly correlated with transcription of the NAT messenger RNA, while in other species, post-transcriptional regulation of NAT activity is responsible. Activity of the other enzyme involved in synthesis of melatonin from serotonin - the methyltransferase - does not show regulation by pattern of light exposure. Biological Effects of Melatonin
Melatonin has important effects in integrating photoperiod and affecting circadian rhythms. Consequently, it has been reported to have significant effects on reproduction, sleep-wake cycles and other phenomena showing circadian rhythm.
