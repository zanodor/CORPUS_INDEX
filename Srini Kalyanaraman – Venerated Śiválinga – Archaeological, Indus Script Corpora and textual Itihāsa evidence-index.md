Three lingas signify - / and )
English translation:
“We worship Tryambaka, whose fame is fragrant, the augmenter of increase; may I be liberated fromdeath, and, like the urvāru a from its stalk, but not to immortality; let us worship Trayambaka, whose fame is fragrant, the augmenter of increase; may I be liberated ro death li e the urvāru a ro its stal , but not unto i ortalit .”
Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya
Tryambaka: the father, ambaka of the three deities, Brahma, Viṣ u and Rudra; also identified with mahatva (Ṛgvidhāna); whose fame is fragrant: sugandhim = prasāritapu a īrti , whose a e o virtue is spread; in li e anner as the ragrance o a tree full in flower sheds sweetness, so spreads the fragrance of holyactions; the augmenter of increase: puṣṭi vardhanam, the augmenter of nutrition, jagad-vīja , the seed of theworld; or, the multiplier of good things subservient to objects of bodily enjo ent, wealh, śarīradhanādiviṣa ān vardhayati yaḥ; may I be liberated: mṛtyor makṣiya = may I be liberated from the world, or the revolutions of life and death; may I attain mokṣa;
Urvāru a = karkaṭi, a species of cucumber; or,karkandhu, which, when ripe falls of itself from its stalk; but not to i ortalit : ā ṛtāt ā ā amṛta, not toor until the immortal or immortality; either the long life of the gods or svarga paradise;
r a ba a =nētratra opetā rudra , the triocular rudra;
Sugandhim = divya gandhopeta , o celestial ragrance ( athāvṛkṣasya sampuṣpitasya dūrādgandho vāt eva pu yasya kṛrma o dūrādgandho vāti: aittirī aĀra yaka)
Kanda II, adhyaya 6, brahmana 2
1. Verily, by means of the Great Oblation the gods slew Vṛtra; by it they gained that supreme authority which they now wield. Now whichever of them were hit by (the Asuras’) arrows in that battle, those sa e darts the extracted, those the pulled out, by performing the Tryambaka-offerings.
Kanda II, adhyaya 5, brahmana 3 C. THE SĀKAMEDHA OFFERINGS
Note: he per or ance o the ā a edha o ferings requires two days. In the first place-a ter the Āhavanī a has been 'ta en out' ro the ārhapat a--both fires are taken up by means of (or 'made to mount') the two kindling-sticks, and transferred (by 'churning out') to another altar (the uttaravedi). On the first day oblations are then made to Agni Anī avat, the Marutaḥ āntapanāḥ and the Maruto Gṛhamedhinaḥ, these being completed on the next morning by a Darvihoma to Indra, and an oblation of cake to the Marutaḥ Krī inaḥ. hen ollows the Mahāhavis, consisting--besides the five constant

oblations--of oblations to Indra-Agni, Mahendra, and Viśva ar an. In the a ternoon ta es place the Mahāpitṛyajña, or (Great) sacrifice to the Manes (performed on a special altar and fire-place, south of the Dakṣi āgi); which is succeeded b the Traiyambakahoma, or offering to Rudra Tryambaka, performed on a cross-way somewhere north of the sacrificial ground.

Lord Śiva is the essence, the ragrance o the three tattvas, three fires, of every thing that is trichotomised, of the three worlds, of the three arms and of the trinity. He is the nourisher. In all living beings, everywhere, in the three guṇas, in the creation, in the sense-organs, in the Devas and Ga as, he is the essence as the fragrance in a lower. He is the lord o Devas.
