Does the Pictish Beast Symbol represent the astrology sign of Capricorn?
Pictish Beast/Elephant
This symbol, which appears on stones more than fifty times,
resembles no known animal and therefore most likely represents
some sort of mythological creature. The symbols are surprisingly
uniform across Pictland, exhibiting the same or a very similar set of
features. There are a number of these features that stand out. Firstly,
the legs do not end in well defined feet or paws, there is no evidence
of claws, but rather they end in swirling patterns; clearly this is no
ordinary animal. Indeed, the swirling patterns terminating the feet,
might suggest that this animal is nebulous in nature, perhaps blown
along cloud-like by the wind. The second feature that stands out is
the ‘hornʼ or ‘crestʼ that in most of the examples typically curls back
from the top of the head. This bears no obvious resemblance to any
trait of any native animal. It could represent a single horn, or perhaps
a mane-like structure. However there are some examples of Pictish



beasts where this feature clearly arises not from the top of the head
but from the side, in approximately the same place as one might
expect horns to appear on other animals, suggesting that this is
more likely to be a horn-like structure, although highly stylised.
Thirdly, the shape of the head and snout are quite distinctive and has
given rise to the description of the symbol as an ‘elephantʼ although,
unlike an elephant, the snout clearly has a mouth incorporated within
it.
It has been suggested that the Pictish beast is some sort of aquatic
creature, and primarily because of the shape of the snout, a dolphin,
or dolphin-like beast. As we have seen before, a dolphin
constellation is actually present in the night sky (Delphinus).
However, only the head would seem to bear even a passing
resemblance to that of a dolphin.
Another fascinating explanation is that this obviously mythological
animal represents an aquatic spirit. This idea is based on the
possibility that legends have percolated down from the Picts to
modern Scotland as tales of water spirits, or kelpies, perhaps even
giving rise to the legend of the Loch Ness monster.
Perhaps the most intriguing connection however requires an
examination of the symbolism of one of the classical signs of the
zodiac; Capricorn. In the book I discuss the possibility that the
‘beastʼ symbol on the obviously Christian Shandwick stone could
well be associated with the winter solstice, and therefore Christmas
in a Christian context. This possibility arises from a carved scene
immediately below the ‘Beastʼ which may constitute a celestial
calendar. In this context, the likeliest candidate for the ‘Beastʼ is the
constellation of Capricorn. However the imagery of the classical
representations of this zodiacal sign does not match particularly well
with the beast symbol. It is now pertinent to revisit the notion that



the beast might represent the constellation of Capricorn.
The constellation Capricorn
That Capricorn is represented by a goat, is a modern invention. This
sign of the zodiac is actually a ‘sea-goatʼ, classically portrayed by the
Greeks, Romans, Assyrians, and Egyptians, as having the head and
front legs of a goat, and the tail of a fish. The constellation of
Capricorn occupies that portion of the night sky associated with
water and therefore has an aquatic aspect to it. While a sea-goat
would seem a long way conceptually from the beast, there is a
fascinating connection. The Indian zodiac also has its own version of
Capricorn, which shares little in common with the goat-fish, but
bears more than a passing resemblance to the ‘beastʼ. This creature
is the fearsome ‘Makaraʼ, which like the western Capricorn is aquatic,
but is considerably more sinister. Depictions vary considerably, but
at its most simplistic it is shown with the head of an elephant and the



body of a crocodile, sometimes with the tail of a peacock. A number
of older carvings show the head as rounded like an elephant, but
with a long snout, which like the Pictish ‘beastʼ incorporates a
mouth. In the case of the ‘Makaraʼ the mouth is armed with sharp
teeth. The creatureʼs legs vary considerably and can resemble those
of a lion, a crocodile, or an elephant. In some cases the body ends in
a flourish of ethereal swirls, which like the nebulous terminations on
the ‘beastʼ may emphasise that this is a supernatural creature. In
mythology, the Makara seems to have both an aquatic and sky
aspect, being associated with rivers and pools (in a similar way to the
kelpie), but was also ridden through the air by Varuna who is both a
sky god and a god of the ocean. Although there are obvious
differences between this Indian creature and the Pictish symbol,
there are a number of features that the Makara, and the ‘beastʼ seem
to share, perhaps most obviously the long snout and rounded head.
In some of the images and sculptures of the Makara, the upper
portion of the snout (despite the incorporation of the mouth) is
reminiscent of the elephantʼs trunk with its bands of muscular tissue
that allow the animal it to articulate the structure. However, in
common with depictions of the Pictish beast, the length of the
Makaraʼs snout varies and can be quite a bit shorter than one would
expect to see on an elephant, and the tip seems also to end in a tight
curl. Examination of the beast found on the Shandwick stone reveals
that the upper portion of the snout also ends in a tight curl. Clearly,
the ‘beastʼ does not have any defined feet, whereas most examples
of the Makara do indeed have feet, although these vary
considerably; some Makara have four and some two, ending with a
swirling tail. The two dimensional Pictish ‘beastʼ appears to be four
legged with a rather simple tail, although both legs and feet end in a
swirling pattern suggesting it is of supernatural origin. Some Makara
also exhibit a small beard-like feature below the lower jaw,
reminiscent of the goat-like western Capricorn, and in addition has a



crest on its head, reminding us of both the beastʼs crest and the
horns of Capricorn (that typically sweep backwards in the same
manner as the Pictish beastʼs crest).

A further connection can be made between the beast and the
Makara, if we consider the possibility that the beast could well be
representing on the Shandwick stone, not only the constellation of
Capricorn but the winter solstice and by default the Nativity. In India,
the winter solstice festival is referred to as ‘Makar Sankrantiʼ and
marks the day the Sun enters the sign of Capricorn. It is seen as
highly significant, symbolising the dawn of a new day for the gods (a
year was said equivalent to a day and a night to the gods in Hindu



tradition). This to the Hindus also marks the point in time where the
Sun begins it journey northwards again and the turning point in the
year. Today it is celebrated, not at the solstice, but on or around the
15 January. In AD 700 we find that, due to precession, the Sun would
have already traversed much of Capricorn by this date. In effect,
Makar Sankranti would be expected to have started on the 25
December; Christmas Day. If the Makara and the Pictish beast both
represent Capricorn, then this would seem to reinforce the theory
that the Shandwick stone is proclaiming the Nativity, using a long
forgotten symbol for mid-winter; the constellation Capricorn. The
month prior to this event in India is seen as very inauspicious, by
contrast Makar Sankranti is seen as highly auspicious; perhaps too
the Picts regarded the 25 December in the same way, a state of mind
that would be very useful to the church as it gradually imposed
Christianity on the population. What better symbolism for the
Nativity than a proclamation of the dawn of a highly auspicious
period of time?



The so-called ‘Pictish beastʼ symbol on the Shandwick stone
If the ‘beastʼ really does equate to the Makara of India, then the
mythology of the Makara, a monster that drags people or even other
mythical creatures into his watery lair, might find parallels in tales
that have survived in Scotland from Pictish times. As previously
mentioned, the most obvious tales are those of the kelpies, or water
horses, that are associated with specific Scottish lochs. Like the
Makara in legend, they too lie in wait, ambushing their victims and
dragging them into the depths. It is perhaps also pertinent to
mention that a common translation of the word Makara is ‘water
horseʼ. Viewing the kelpie as a Makara-like mythological figure also
helps to explain one of Scotlandʼs most famous tourist attractions;
Nessie. This legendary monster is not, contrary to many peoples
belief a modern invention, but has a well attested mythology going
back to the age of the Picts. St Columba, who is credited with



bringing Christianity to the northern Picts, was travelling through
Pictland in AD 565. On reaching Loch Ness he saved a man from a
water monster, banishing the creature with his staff. The Loch has
been inextricably linked with a monster, or as some locals prefer, a
kelpie, ever since. Perhaps, in a mirror to Hindu tales of the Makara,
the Picts originally had a myth or legend linking such a monster to
the Loch, a monster that was stopped in the process of drowning a
person by divine intervention. Maybe this intervention originally took
the form of a Pictish god interceding directly as Vishnu is credited
with doing in Indian Makara mythology, but this myth was later
‘appropriatedʼ by Columbaʼs biographer Adamnan as a miracle by the
Christian missionary in order to boost his status. A story relating to
the banishment of a monster in the process of drowning a righteous
man, is transformed into a story where the monster is banished by
the power of Christ through his servant St Columba.
There is one more piece of visual evidence that to say the least is
startling and is not easy to explain unless the Pictish beast symbol is
indeed the Makara. If we return to the fine example of the beast on
the Shandwick stone and take another look at the head and snout,
as we have previously noted, that there appears to be some
resemblance to the Makara. There is the rounded elephant-like head,
the crest, the long snout and the end of the upper jaw appearing to
end in small swirl reminiscent of some of the older Makara carvings.
However we must remember that the Shandwick stone has been
badly weathered in the past after many years of exposure to the salt
air of the North Sea. The question is then; are there any features that
were apparent in the past that have faded with time that back up the
growing evidence that the Pictish beast and the Hindu Makara are
one and the same? There are early drawings and photographs from
the late nineteenth and early twentieth century of the Shandwick
beast that appear to show more detail than is apparent today. These

clearly show that the beastʼs snout bears all the same hallmarks of
the Makaraʼs trunk, with the classic muscular banded features of a
typical elephantʼs trunk. Traces of this banding can just be made out
in the picture above. Amazingly this was an integral feature of the
‘beastʼ symbol displayed on a stone in northern Scotland and
created in the so-called ‘Dark Agesʼ. The trunk of the Pictish beast
does not just vaguely or accidently incorporate some trunk-like
features, but it would appear that an elephantine resemblance may
have been deliberately sought, in much the same way as in the
depictions of the Makara. Both the Hindu and Pictish sculptors
however are also obviously aware at the same time that this is not an
elephant, and appear to have a very clear, similar and well defined
creature in mind. We can therefore say with increased authority, that
both the Pictish symbol and the Indian version of Capricorn both
display the same bizarre and almost identical snout-like feature,
which is modified in both cases by shortening, curled tightly at the
end and incorporating a mouth. How this incredible similarity could
possibly come about, creates more questions than it answers,
questions that probe the very relationship in space and time between
the Celts of north western Europe and the Hindus of India. Whilst the
Makara represents the whole of Capricorn in Indian solar astrology,
the equivalent nakshatra in Vedic Lunar astrology is represented by
the front portion of the constellation; the ‘elephantʼs trunkʼ. We
therefore have the possibility that the beast could either be
equivalent to the entire constellation or solar zodiacal sign of
Capricorn or a Pictish version of the much smaller lunar nakshatra;
Uttarashadha.
