Suprachiasmatic Nucleus
R.Y. Moore, in International Encyclopedia of the Social & Behavioral Sciences, 2001
The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus is the principal circadian pacemaker in the mammalian brain and, as
such, it generates circadian rhythms in rest and activity, core body temperature, neuroendocrine function, autonomic function,
memory and psychomotor performance, and a host of other behavioral and physiological processes. The SCN is the central
player in an important neural system, the circadian timing system (CTS). This article reviews the principal properties of
circadian rhythms, the characteristics of circadian rhythmicity in the SCN, and the major output of the latter. The nature of the
SCN in nonmammalian vertebrates is also briefly considered.
Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN), master oscillator
The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is a bilateral structure that
is the central pacemaker of the circadian timing system (CTS)
and regulates most, if not all, circadian rhythms in the body.

“The circadian clock evolved in diverse organisms to integrate external environmental changes
and internal physiology. The clock endows the host with temporal precision and robust
adaptation to the surrounding environment. When circadian rhythms are perturbed or
misaligned, as a result of jet lag, shiftwork or other lifestyle factors, adverse health
consequences arise, and the risks of diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases or
metabolic disorders increase. Although the negative impact of circadian rhythm disruption is
now well established, it remains underappreciated how to take advantage of biological timing,
or correct it, for health benefits. In this Review, we provide an updated account of the
circadian system and highlight several key disease areas with altered circadian signalling. We
discuss environmental and lifestyle modifications of circadian rhythm and clock-based
therapeutic strategies, including chronotherapy, in which dosing time is deliberately optimized
for maximum therapeutic index, and pharmacological agents that target core clock components
and proximal regulators. Promising progress in research, disease models and clinical
applications should encourage a concerted effort towards a new era of circadian medicine.”

“The circadian clock is a complex cellular mechanism that, through the control
of diverse metabolic and gene expression pathways, governs a large array of
cyclic physiological processes. Epidemiological and clinical data reveal a
connection between the disruption of circadian rhythms and cancer that is
supported by recent preclinical data. In addition, results from animal models
and molecular studies underscore emerging links between cancer metabolism
and the circadian clock. This has implications for therapeutic approaches, and
we discuss the possible design of chronopharmacological strategies.”

The circadian clock plays a critical role in physiology and medicine by cyclically regulating
the expression of numerous genes. The core components of the clock are thought to be
controlled by several regulatory mechanisms, including post-translational modifications,
but the full extent of this regulation is not known. In this issue, Sessa and co-workers
demonstrate that the transcription factor CLOCK is a direct substrate of the kinase AKT.
This phosphorylation controls the nuclear–cytosolic translocation of CLOCK and thus its
ability to regulate circadian gene expression in peripheral tissues... a core intracellular
survival regulator acts on a central clock component, impacting its function. These new
data help to solidify our comprehension of clock regulation and point to intriguing new
connections between nutrient sensing and biological timekeeping.

The full length v-akt oncogene was cloned, sequenced and biochemically
characterized as a protein kinase C-related serine-threonine kinase by the
Staal group in 1991...Taken together these points, it seems that the origin of
the name for the mouse homologue AKT of the viral v-akt gene product
could be at least interpreted as “a serine/threonine protein kinase encoded by
the oncogene in the transforming retrovirus isolated from the thymoma cell
line AKT-8, which is derived from the Stock A Strain k AKR mouse
originally inbred in the laboratory of Dr. C. P. Rhoads by K. B. Rhoads at
the Rockefeller Institute.” Source: Bellacosa A, Testa JR, Staal SP, Tsichlis

“Since its initial discovery as a proto-oncogene, the serine/threonine kinase Akt (also known as protein kinase B or PKB) has become a major focus of attention because of its critical role in regulating diverse cellular functions including metabolism, growth, proliferation, survival, transcription and protein synthesis. The Akt signaling cascade is activated by receptor tyrosine kinases, integrins, B and T cell receptors, cytokine receptors, G-protein-coupled receptors and other stimuli that induce production of phospha- tidylinositol trisphosphates (PIP3) by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). These lipids serve as plasma membrane docking sites for proteins that harbor pleckstrin-homology (PH) domains, including Akt and its upstream activator PDK1. At the membrane PDK1 phosphorylates Akt at Thr308 leading to partial activation of Akt. Phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 by mTORC2 stimulates full enzymatic activity. Members of the PI3K-related kinase (PIKK) family, including DNAPK, can also phosphorylate Akt at Ser473. Akt is dephosphorylated by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and the PH-domain leucine-rich-repeatcontaining protein phosphatases (PHLPP1/2). In addition, the tumor suppres- sor phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) inhibits Akt activity by dephosphorylating PIP3.”

AKT keeps the beat in CLOCK's circadian rhythm
Figure 1 AKT is a post-translational modifier of CLOCK
localization. The study by Sessa and co-workers
demonstrated that AKT phosphorylates CLOCK at Ser-845
to control the nuclear–cytosolic translocation of CLOCK to
regulate circadian gene expression in vivo. “Given that the
activities of AKT and TOR pathways underlie metabolic
disorders and/or cancers, the current study supports the
view that altered circadian activity by AKT-mediated
CLOCK phosphorylation might be causative of human
diseases...”

Schematic representation of circadian clock genes: The mechanism of core circadian clock depends upon a transcriptional-translational feedback loop comprising the transcription factors BMAL1 and CLOCK/NPAS2. The positively regulated gene BMAL1 and CLOCK/NPAS2 heterodimerize and bind E-box elements in PER and CRY genes. The PER and CRY proteins inhibit their own transcription by interfering with CLOCK/NPAS2 and BMAL1 activity. DEC1 and DEC2 are involved in the regulation of circadian genes as well. A

and RORα. Additionally, CK1ε phosphorylates PER and tags it
for proteasome-mediated degradation. Blue arrows represent activation, red lines represent suppression and thin blue arrow represents signal for proteasome degradation. Source: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/333499250_Circadian_

Circadian rhythm regulation has a big role in developing various carcinomas, and head
and neck tumors are no exception. A number of studies have reported that alteration in
clock gene expression is associated with several cancers, including HNSCC. Analyses on
circadian clock genes and their association with HNSCC have shown that expression of
PER1, PER2, PER3, CRY1, CRY2, CKIε, TIM, and BMAL1 are deregulated in HNSCC
tissues. This review paper comprehensively presents data on deregulation of circadian
genes in HNSCC and critically evaluates their potential diagnostics and prognostics role
in this type of pathology.

Figure 1. An internal biological clock. Leaves of mimosa plants open towards the sun during
daytime and close at dusk. Jean Jacques d’Ortous de Mairan placed a mimosa plant in
constant dark and found that the leaves continued to follow their daily rhythm for several
days. This suggested that mimosa plants have a cell autonomous clock that can maintain the
biological rhythm even under constant conditions.

Figure 2. A simplified illustration of the feedback regulation of the period gene. A) Both period
mRNA and PER protein oscillate, with PER protein accumulating several hours after the peak in
period mRNA. PER protein localizes in the nucleus, and the period gene activity oscillates as a result
of PER protein feedback inhibition of its own gene. B) Additional proteins are essential for the
oscillation of the period gene. TIM protein, encoded by the timeless gene is also oscillating and
interacts with PER protein. The interaction is critical for PER protein nuclear accumulation and
repression of the period gene. DBT protein is encoded by the doubletime gene. DBT is a protein
kinase that phosphorylates PER, leading to PER protein degradation. DBT-mediated PER protein
degradation contributes to the delay between period mRNA and PER protein accumulation. CLK and
CYK, encoded by the clock and cycle genes, are two transcription factors that activate the period

Further studies are needed to delineate 1) the role of pineal gland and 2) molecular
mechanisms which result in the increased secretion of melatonin at night.
Exposure to sunlight or a sun lamp has been shown to increase the body's production of
melatonin at night. Melatonin is a hormone produced in the pineal gland and is the key
hormone for setting this body's circadian rhythm.
Bidirectional interactions between sleep, circadian rhythm and epilepsy have been evidenced.
These studies need to be further augmented to delineate 1) the relationship between circadian
rhythm and epilepsy; and 2) develop new treatment strategies to improve seizure control.
These studies in neuroscience will help unravel the neural correlates of consciousness with
greater precision and better understand the metaphor of the Cosmic Dancer arousing the
