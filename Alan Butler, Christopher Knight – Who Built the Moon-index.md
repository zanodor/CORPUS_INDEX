# Index for Alan Butler, Christopher Knight – Who Built the Moon.pdf

Christopher Knight has worked in
advertising and marketing for over
thirty years, specialising in consumer
psychology and market research.
His writing career began almost by
accident after he had invested seven
years conducting research into the
origins of Freemasonic rituals and he
has written four books to date, co
authored with Robert Lomas. His first
book, The Hiram Key, was published in
1996 and it immediately went into the
UK top ten bestseller list and remained



in the chart for eight consecutive weeks.
It has since been translated into thirty
seven languages and sold over a million
copies worldwide, becoming a bestseller
in several countries. He now divides his
time between marketing consultancy
and historical research for writing
books.
Alan Butler qualified as an engineer,
but was always fascinated by history,
and made himself into something of an
expert in astrology and astronomy.
Since 1990, he has been researching



ancient cultures, pagan beliefs and
comparative religion and has published
four successful books on such topics as
the Knights Templar and the Grail
legend. He is also a published
playwright and a very successful radio
dram atist.

For most people the suggestion that the
Moon could be artificial is about as
sensible as saying that it is made of
green cheese. This is a perfectly
reasonable response based on everything
that we know about the world we live in,
where there are just two kinds of objects:
those that are here because the random
forces of the Universe – that we call



‘nature’ – caused them to exist; or
because they were manufactured by
human hand.
However super-rational our
scientific community considers itself to
be, there are still huge numbers of
people who believe things that are not
proven by empiric means. In a recent
poll it was found that no less than
ninety-two per cent of Americans say
they believe in God1 – and other surveys
indicate that many millions of people
are equally convinced that aliens have



visited our planet.
God may well exist, and so too
might aliens for all we know, but this
book will only concern itself with hard,
scientific facts. And, unlike so many of
those trapped in the politically correct
world of academia, our published
findings will not be constrained by the
demands of current convention. The
information we put forward here is
clear, testable and, we believe,
irrefutable.
Despite the fact that the Moon is



almost certainly 4.6 billion years old, we
will demonstrate beyond all reasonable
doubt that Earth’s Moon cannot be a
natural object. And then we shall
explain in detail how the agency that
manufactured the Moon left a series of
detailed messages of what had been
done and for whom it had been
undertaken.
So, here is our challenge. Put aside
your natural incredulity and read this
book with an open mind, check out the
evidence then ask yourself ‘Who built



the Moon?’
We have cited three possibilities
but maybe you can think of more.
However, the last of our suggestions
appears to us to be increasingly likely. It
is a worrying, staggering, exciting and
completely awesome concept. And, if
there is even an outside chance that this
could be the answer, the world has a
major new challenge ahead of it.



The entire population appeared to have
simultaneously decided to evacuate
every building, and the streets and car
parks were quickly filling with people
standing almost shoulder-to-shoulder.
Traffic began to grind to a halt as



drivers leaned out of their windows, and
even the birds abandoned the sky to
assemble in rows along guttering and
telephone wires, chattering like some
misplaced dawn chorus.
The large grey clouds obligingly
parted to reveal a muted late- morning
Sun that had a small bite out of its
right-hand edge. As the dark spot grew,
the birds fell silent and a sea of
expectant faces became transfixed
upwards. Three welders from a nearby
garage became instantly popular as they



passed around their dark-lensed masks,
allowing the smiling onlookers a direct
view of the diminishing solar disc.
Then it happened; the moment of
totality arrived. The Sun disappeared
for several seconds, allowing the
darkness of night to wholly consume
the day. Then slowly a bright sparkle
materialized that soon looked like a
diamond set on the band of some
heavenly ring.
The last total solar eclipse of the
twentieth century had just occurred on



the morning of August 11th 1999. It
had begun when the Moon passed
between the Earth and Sun, throwing an
umbral shadow, forty-nine kilometres
wide, on the North Atlantic just south
of Nova Scotia. The inky black circle
then swept across the ocean surface
until it passed over the Isles of Scilly, off
the south-west coast of England, some
forty minutes later. Here the path width
had expanded to 103 kilometres and
was now covering the ground at a speed
approaching 1,000 metres per second.
The circular shadow then curved its way



over Europe and on to the Middle East
before crossing India and finally
disappearing over the Bay of Bengal.
Such events do not happen often
in the lifetime of an individual but once
seen, a total solar eclipse is never
forgotten. Solar eclipses occur around
two to five times per year but the area
on the ground covered by the totality is
very small, so in any given location on
Earth a total eclipse will only happen
once every 360 years.
One can only imagine how



primitive peoples may have feared for
their lives as the Sun was apparently
extinguished before their eyes. No doubt
the astronomer priests of ancient time
held sway over their people by having
the apparently magical power of
predicting such terrifying events.
But even today the magic and
mystery of the eclipse is very real.
It is a very strange quirk of fate indeed
that the disc of the Moon should seem,
from an earthly perspective, to be
exactly the same size as the Sun. Whilst



we casually take it for granted that the
two main bodies seen in Earth’s skies
look the same size, it is actually
something of a miracle. Most people are
fully aware that the Moon is tiny
compared to the Sun but that it is
much closer to us causing them to
appear as equal discs. To be precise, the
Moon is 400 times smaller than the star
at the centre of our solar system, yet it is
also just 1/400th of the distance between
the Earth and the Sun.
Whilst the surprisingly neat



number of 400 for relative size and
distance is apparently an amusing
coincidence of the decimal counting
system, the odds against this optical
illusion happening at all are huge.
Experts are deeply puzzled by the
phenomenon. Isaac Asimov, the
respected scientist and science-fiction
guru, described this perfect visual
alignment as being ‘the most unlikely
coincidence imaginable’.
This perfect fit of the lunar and
solar discs is a very human perspective



because it only works from the
viewpoint of someone standing on the
Earth’s surface. But the magic of the
Moon’s movements above our heads
goes to even more astonishing levels. By
some absolutely incomprehensible
quirk of nature, the Moon also manages
to precisely imitate the perceived annual
movements of the Sun each month.
So, when the Sun is at its lowest
and weakest in midwinter, the full
Moon is at its highest and brightest, and
in midsummer, when the Sun is at its



highest and brightest, the Moon is at its
weakest.
If you want to understand how
extraordinary this doppelgänger effect
is, stand on a hilltop or an open plain
and film the Sun at midwinter sunset
(its most southerly point on the
horizon), at the spring equinox, again at
midsummer and again at the autumn
equinox. Then on those same dates film
the Moon setting and you will see that
they both go down at the same point on
the horizon at the equinoxes (March



21st and September 21st) but the Moon
will have the opposite setting point to
the Sun at solstices in December and
June. 2
Figure 1
This drawing shows the peculiar relationship of the
Sun and Moon throughout the year as seen from



Earth. At midsummer in the northern hemisphere the
Sun sets north of west, whereas the full Moon sets
south of west. At midwinter the situation is reversed,
with the Sun setting south of west and the Moon
setting north of west.
Figure 2
At the time of the spring and autumn equinox sunset
happens at a due west position, whilst the full Moon
also sets in this part of the sky.



It would be easy to dismiss these
Sun-mimicking performances by saying
that it is simply a consequence of the
Moon’s distance from Earth and its
orbital characteristics. And that is what
most scientifically trained people will
say because it is self-evidently true. But
what they are really saying is ‘It is so
because it is so’ – which takes us
nowhere. Of course, it could, and
logically has to be, one big coincidence.
What else could it be? Even most of the
ninety-two per cent of the American
population who state that they believe



in God would probably assume
coincidence and only a minority might
claim that it is the grand plan of the
Alm ighty.
The Moon’s dance around the
Earth that produces these startling
performances is extremely complex and
it is a consequence of the relative
movements of the Earth and the Sun as
well of the Moon itself.
The path of the Moon’s orbit is
inclined at 5°9 ́ to the line of Earth’s
path around the Sun, known as the



plane of the ecliptic. The Earth is also
tilted at an angle of just over 23°27 ́,
although this is slowly decreasing so
that in several million years it will reach
22°54 ́, after which it will again increase.
Figure 3
It follows that solar eclipses can



only occur when the Moon passes
through the plane of the ecliptic and the
Sun’s light is blocked by the Moon.
These points of intersection happen
twice for each lunar orbit and are
known as ‘nodes’. These nodes appear
to move slowly around the background
stars giving the impression of moving
backwards through the calendar
occurring 19.618 days earlier per year.
The cycle completes every 18.618 years,
which amounts to a surprisingly neat
6,800 days.



Closely allied to this node cycle is
the so-called ‘Saros cycle’, which
governs the periodicity and recurrence
of eclipses, where each eclipse sequence
has a duration of approximately
6,585.32 days (eighteen years, eleven
days, seven hours, forty minutes and
forty-eight seconds). The people of
Ancient Mesopotamia knew of this
astronomical principle and it is quite
possible that earlier observers, long
before written records began, were also
aware of it.



However, one has to wait for three
Saros cycles in order for a solar eclipse
to repeat at the same spot on Earth
because successive eclipses in the Saros
cycle happen one-third of the way
around the world from each other. You
would therefore have to wait over fifty
four years to see an eclipse return to the
same geographic area. There are twelve
different Grand Saros eclipse series at
the present time.
Human knowledge about the
movements of the Moon is far older



than most people might imagine. More
than 25,000 years ago an early
astronomer created a lunar calendar
that is still intact. The bone he engraved
was excavated nearly a hundred years
ago at Abri Blanchard, not far from
Lascaux in France. Experts agree that
the markings accurately correspond
with a two-month lunar calendar.
Around 250 generations later another
astronomer also recorded this already
ancient knowledge, using various
natural minerals daubed onto a cave
wall to leave the image of an empty



rectangle followed by a series of fourteen
sooty dots. It was realized that these
marks might also be a lunar calendar.
The fourteen dots, it was argued,
represented the face of the Moon from
full to new, after which the empty
rectangle would symbolize the
disappearance of the Moon’s face on the
fifteenth day.
If anyone doubted that the marks
on the cave walls at Lascaux really was a
lunar calendar, or even continued to
believe counting was something that did



not appear until the arrival of the
written word some 5,000 years ago,
another picture close by might cause
them to think again. On this part of the
cave wall there were twenty-nine dots,
snaking around the bottom of a
beautifully executed painting of a wild
horse. Twenty-nine days is the period
from new Moon through full Moon to
new Moon again. And yet another
artefact known as the Isturitz Baton,
displays an even more advanced four
month and five- month lunar calendar.



It is humbling to realize that these
records were created more than ten
thousand years before the Ice Age ended
and the woolly mammoth disappeared.
These kinds of lunar observations
are not restricted to southern France.
The Ishango Bone, which was found in
the Congo, Africa, also carries markings
that seem to represent a lunar calendar.
What is more, it is of an almost
identical age to the Isturitz Baton,
though it originated many hundreds of
kilometres to the south and on a



different continent.
The existence of lunar calendars
from such an early date is of great
importance to our understanding of our
own development. They demonstrate a
clear awareness of the passing of time
and the cycles of the natural world. The
discovery of an archaeological artefact is
a matter of chance and is dependent on
the number of objects of any particular
sort that once existed. The fact that so
many of these bones, antlers and
paintings have been discovered is a good



indication that they were not unique
and that Moon knowledge was
important to the Palaeolithic people of
Europe and Africa, though this does
give us cause to wonder why such an
early lunar fascination developed.
A recent discovery has shown why
such intricate observations ‘suddenly’
became possible for our distant
forebears around 32,000 years ago. In
July 2004, Rachel Caspari of the
University of Michigan and Sang-Hee
Lee of the University of California



published a paper in the Proceedings of
the National Academy of Sciences,
concerning comparisons of 768
different human fossils from a huge
span of human development. They
then divided the fossils into two groups
– adults of reproductive age, which they
settled on as fifteen years, and adults
that lived to be twice as old, based on
tooth wear.
In primitive societies, people were
often grandparents by the age of thirty,
if they were lucky enough to live that



long.
Dr Caspari said, ‘We found this
proportion of older to young adults in
the fossil record increased over time and
in the Upper Paleolithic that proportion
just skyrocketed.’
By calculating the ratio of old to
young individuals in the samples, the
researchers found that their numbers
soared up to fivefold in the Upper
Palaeolithic group, a leap that was so
surprising that the team at first
questioned its own results.



This dramatic leap in average
lifespan allowed individuals to grow
older and wiser and afforded each of
these new elders time to pass on their
knowledge to the next generation of
adults. The wear on the teeth suggests
that this leap in longevity must have
given rise to a true form of education
that could build up a body of ‘species
intelligence’ where the entire social
group knows far more than any one
individual. This would allow for the
first specialization in which talented
men and women were fed and



protected by the group to allow them to
add value to their early society.
This sudden transition from a
society of children to one of ‘greybeards’
must have been a watershed that laid
the foundations for what would
eventually become true civilization. The
period of history, known as the Upper
Palaeolithic Period, marks a time when
modern man was becoming established
in Europe and there was an expansion
of population, creating social pressures
that led to the growth of trade networks,



increased mobility, and more complex
systems of co-operation and
com petition.
We could now understand why
observational astronomy became the
first real science for humankind. All
science is based upon observation of
patterns that stand out from the ‘noise’
of simple random chance and then,
through understanding, we can make
predictions of future events and
outcomes. In this way the tides, the
seasons and the movements of the



heavens could be seen as being parts of
a single engine driving the variations in
the immediate environment of the early
thinkers.
These early observational scientists
would also note where patterns from
completely different events appeared to
be related. Why should high tide
happen twice a day and rise higher
when the Moon was full or when there
was no Moon at all? Did the Moon have
some kind of control over something as
massive as the oceans? Even stranger,



why did women of childbearing age lose
blood once for every complete cycle of
the Moon?
We can be sure that this particular
fact was not lost upon these people.
Back in 1911 a French physician
by the name of J G Lalanne was
examining caves in Laussel, in the
Dordogne, when he chanced upon
something that turns out to be very
illuminating in terms of the Palaeolithic
mindset. Carved into the wall of a
limestone rock shelter, he found a 33cm



female figure. The artistry involved
from so early a period is quite
remarkable, the more so given that it
was executed with flint tools. The naked
and full-bellied woman has her left
hand on her abdomen and in her right
hand is holding a bison horn, in the
shape of a crescent moon. Upon the
bison horn there are thirteen incised
lines. The Venus of Laussel, as she is
called, is at least 20,000 years old.
This carving is one of many that
strongly suggest there was a very early



recognition that human fertility seemed
to be tied to the phases and period of
the Moon. Human female reproduction
is dependent on the menstrual cycle
which has an average of twenty-eight
days, and approximately halfway
through the cycle a mature cell is
released from a woman’s ovaries and
becomes available for fertilization. If
sexual intercourse does not take place
and the egg is not fertilized, it
disintegrates after a couple of days. At
the end of the cycle, if no conception
has taken place, menstruation begins



and the cycle commences once again.
A series of intriguing studies by
Professor LeRoy McDermott of the
Missouri State University has suggested
that these early ‘Venus’ images of the
female figure were self-portraits. His
analysis showed that the figurines were
made from the point of view of ‘self’
rather than ‘other’ and they could only
represent a women’s view of her own
body both emotionally and physically
as she looks downwards. Using
photographic simulations of what a



modern female sees of herself,
McDermott demonstrates that the
anatomical omissions and proportional
distortions found in various Venus
figurines occur naturally in autogenous,
or self-generated, information. The size,
shape, and articulation of the objects
appear to be determined by their
relationship to the eyes and the relative
effects of foreshortening, distance, and
occlusion rather than by any symbolic
distortion. As self-portraits of women at
different stages of life, McDermott
believes these earliest representations of



the human form embodied obstetric-al
and gynaecological information and
probably signified an advance in
women’s self-conscious control over the
material conditions of their
reproductive lives.
The lunar month symbolism in
the Venus of Laussel strongly suggests
that women 20,000 years ago knew the
length of their menstrual cycles and
already equated them with the phases of
the Moon. The thirteen lines on the
crescent-shaped bison horn could easily



relate to the thirteen menstrual cycles an
average woman could expect in each
year. At the same time, it is not at all
uncommon for a human female to
menstruate on the same Moon phase
each month because twenty-eight days
is merely an average, whilst the period
between one full Moon and the next is
29.53 days.
The historical connection between
human fertility and the Moon even
extends to the word ‘menstrual’. It
derives from the Latin mensis, meaning



month, whilst the word ‘month’ is very
ancient and refers to the period of four
weeks as being one ‘moonth’.
The connection between human
fertility and the cycles of the Moon is
considered to be ‘apparent rather than
actual’, but it isn’t in the least surprising
that the possibility of a relationship was
noticed by our ancient ancestors. The
clincher probably came when someone
realized that the average gestation
period of a human female, from
conception to birth, is around 266 days



– or nine full lunar synodic cycles.
In a social and a religious sense,
fertility undoubtedly played a crucial
part in the lives of people at the time
the Venus of Laussel was carved. It is
more or less universally accepted that
female deities were important to
human culture for thousands of years
of prehistory. Statues of pregnant
women with exaggerated genitals and
breasts are common from the
Palaeolithic to the Neolithic periods and
there are strong indications of the



existence of a fertility-based deity who
has come down to us as ‘The Great
Goddess’. The Venus of Laussel could
quite easily be a representation of this
deity, complete with a representation of
the heavenly body with which she was
equated – the Moon.
About 6,000 years ago there was an
outbreak of building in stone across the
western parts of Europe, particularly in
the British Isles, that tells us a great deal
about the Neolithic people’s fascination
with the Moon.



Dr Philip Stooke, of the University
of Western Ontario, Canada had always
been puzzled as to why there were no
maps or drawings of the Moon older
than the one drawn by Leonardo da
Vinci five hundred years ago. He
decided to look at ancient manuscripts
and the records of excavations of the
Neolithic sites on the British Isles.
Amongst other sites, he looked at the
truly amazing prehistoric structures
known as Newgrange and Knowth in
County Meath, Ireland. And it was at
the recently excavated Knowth that he



found a 5,200-year-old carving made
up of a set of lines and dots. Dr Stooke
realized that this was not simply a
Stone-Age doodle but a drawing of the
face of the Moon. He said:
‘I was amazed when
I saw it. Place the
markings over a
picture of the full
Moon and you will
see that they line
up. It is without
doubt a map of the



Moon, the most
ancient one ever
found. It’s all there
in the carving. You
can see the overall
pattern of the lunar
features, from
features such as
Mare Humorun
through to Mare
Crisium. The
people who carved
this Moon map
were the first



scientists – they
knew a great deal
about the motion of
the Moon. They
were not primitive
at all.’
Figure 4



These people were not merely Moon
watchers. Chris, along with Robert
Lomas, had already published his
analysis of the astronomical function of
nearby Newgrange, which was carefully
designed and engineered to allow the
light of Venus to penetrate deep into the
domed structure once every eighth
winter solstice.3 This focused beam of
light gave these early scientists a very
precise tracking of Venus, which
allowed them to maintain a calendar
that would be accurate to a matter of
seconds over each eight-year cycle.



There was no doubt that these builders
were far from primitive, as
archaeological convention once
suggested.
Investigations at Knowth had
already shown that at certain times
moonlight shines down the eastern
passage of the structure. Dr Stooke has
now pointed out that these narrow
moonbeams would also fall right onto
the Neolithic lunar map. He concluded,
‘It was obviously built by men who had
a sophisticated understanding of the



motions of the Sun, Moon and stars.’
The switch from a powerful female
deity, often equated with the Moon, and
solar-based masculine deities seems to
have taken place at about the same time
humanity began to discover writing.
This occurred in Sumer (modern Iraq
and Kuwait) and Egypt just after
structures like Newgrange and Knowth
had been constructed.
One researcher, Dr Leonard
Shlain, Chief of Labroscopic Surgery at
the California-Pacific Medical Center,



has suggested this connection in his
controversial but immensely popular
book, The Alphabet versus the Goddess.4
Here Shlain outlines his view that the
evolution of writing specifically involved
the use of the practical left hemisphere
of the brain, as a direct contrast to the
many thousands of years during which
the more intuitive, inspirational right
hemisphere had predominated. He
maintains that this explains the virtual
abandonment of a generally peaceful
feminine-centred society across much of
Europe, the Middle East and Asia. This



transition was staggered but it began
around 3,000 BC, when a more
aggressive, patriarchal social structure
emerged with masculine deities
predom inating.
This thesis sounds very reasonable
and, if true, we could expect to find this
legacy of the Moon-associated goddesses
still present at the dawn of writing,
when myths and stories were first being
catalogued. And this is indeed the case.
In Sumer we find Nana, a very early
Moon goddess, whilst in nearby Egypt,



where writing came just a little later,
there is an even better example in terms
of Isis, who rose to become one of the
most important and revered goddesses
across the whole known world for
several thousand years. Isis originated as
a Moon goddess, and the fact is borne
out by one specific part of her story. Isis
had to rebuild the body of her husband,
Osiris, after he had been brutally
murdered and his body chopped into
pieces. She travelled all over the world
to find the dismembered parts of her
husband of which there were fourteen in



total. The story is analogous to the
gradual increase in size of the Moon
across fourteen days from new to full.
Referring to the Egyptians,
Plutarch, the Greek essayist, writing
around 60 AD said:
‘Egyptian priests
called the Moon
“the Mother of the
Universe”, because
the Moon, having
the light which
makes moist and



pregnant, is
promotive of the
generation of living
beings.’
Although to some early cultures the
Moon was associated with a masculine
deity, such as the Babylonian Sin for
example, in by far the majority of cases
the Moon was considered to be female
and carried strong aspects of fertility.
This goddess had many names across
the world. To the Greeks she was
Artemis and the Romans called her



Diana and Selene. Her Finnish name
was Kuu and to the Celts she was
worshipped as Cerridwen. Nor was she
ignored in the New World; in what is
now Mexico the Moon goddess was
called Tlazolteotli and to the Mayans
she was Ixchup. These names represent
only a tiny proportion of those that are
still remembered and there can be no
doubt at all that Earth’s Moon has been
deeply important to humanity across
the whole world and for many
thousands of years.



The Moon was almost certainly the
first heavenly body used to measure the
passage of time for reasons other than
human fertility. In this capacity it is still
enshrined in our own systems by the
use of months to split the solar year.
Looking back at history it is easy to see
the repeated attempts of different
cultures to reconcile lunar time with a
growing recognition of the length of the
year, which is governed by the Sun. A
truly ancient culture, such as that of the
Sumerians, never abandoned its lunar
calendar, beginning each month as the



first crescent of the Moon showed itself
in the dawn sky. However, at the same
time Sumerian Priests adopted a
‘stylized’ month of thirty days in length,
which fitted the solar year in a more
regular way. Lunar reckoning is still
used in Islam, a legacy of the religion’s
origins in the Arabian Peninsula.
In a physical sense this intense
interest in the Moon is not at all
surprising. We tend to forget in our
modern world of electric lights that
there was a time, not so long ago, when



the Moon was a welcome sight on a
dark night, but at the same time it was
recognized to have awesome powers. It
was believed by cultures from across the
world that the Moon could have a
bearing on people’s mental states (see
chapter five). The English word ‘lunatic’
enshrines this belief and, up to very
recent times, it was considered that
those who were mentally unstable could
be triggered into madness and violence
by the appearance of the full Moon. In
addition, our ancient ancestors were
well aware that the Moon was



responsible for one of the most
frightening and awe-inspiring
happenings that periodically ‘stole’ the
Sun from the sky.
Solar eclipses happen when the
new Moon passes directly between the
Sun and the Earth. At such times the
shadow of the Moon is cast upon the
Earth. If the observer is in the right
place on the Earth, it will appear that
the light of the Sun has been blotted out
and day can suddenly become night. A
total eclipse is a truly remarkable event



because in order for it to happen the
size of the Moon and the Sun, as seen
from the Earth, must be identical.
Nevertheless it does happen and it must
have struck absolute terror into the
hearts of early humans. This fear would
have been slightly mitigated when it
became possible to predict eclipses,
something that a number of early
cultures sought to do.
A second sort of eclipse, which is
seen more often because of the
planetary geometry involved, is called a



‘lunar eclipse’ – and in its own way this
must have been just as potent and
frightening. A lunar eclipse happens
when the Moon moves through the
shadow of the Earth, so the full Moon is
seen to slowly disappear in a clear night
sky. (See figure 19, pg 246)
On these occasions the Moon’s face
is not totally blotted out by Earth’s
shadow, often appearing as a ghostly
blood red disc. Even today this is a
chilling sight and one can sympathize
with people who viewed the event with a



sense of foreboding.
Without a good understanding of
the planetary cycles involved, eclipses of
both sorts could easily appear to be
random events and many early cultures
sought to discover the patterns involved,
probably working on the assumption
that understanding inferred a degree of
control. This may well have represented
the first serious attempts at astronomy.
It is known that both the Assyrians and
the Babylonians could predict eclipses.
In both cases many of the astronomical



skills were inherited from the earlier
Sumerians and it is highly likely that
eclipse prediction already existed before
3,000 BC.
Further west there have been
suggestions that some Megalithic
monuments were built as eclipse
predictors, maybe as early as 4,000 BC.
Astronomer Gerald Hawkins in his
b o o k Stonehenge Decoded used a
computer model to demonstrate that
Stonehenge in Wiltshire, England,
might have been partly built with



eclipse prediction in mind.5
By at least the second millennium
BC the Chinese could also predict
eclipses. As far back as 2650 BC, Li Shu
was writing about the subject of
astronomy. Three and a half centuries
later, ancient Chinese astrologers had
sophisticated observatory buildings, and
solar eclipses were considered essential
for forecasting the future health and
successes of the emperor. These
astronomers were keen to be accurate as
failure to get the prediction correct was



likely to be lethal for them. In one
documented case referring to the eclipse
of 2136 BC the two astrologers who got
it wrong were beheaded. The following
recorded their fate: ‘Here lie the bodies
of Ho and Hi, Whose fate, though sad,
is risible; Being slain because they could
not spy Th’ eclipse which was invisible.’

For thousands of years the Moon was a
thing of awe and wonder to human
beings across the entire planet and it
remains so to millions of people today,



despite technological advances and a
good understanding of its physical
characteristics. For example, the Moon
has always been equated with
agriculture. Even in some parts of the
fully developed world there are farmers
and gardeners who would not dream of
either planting or harvesting without
direct reference to the phase of the
Moon or even the part of the zodiac it
occupies at any particular point in time.
The Moon is the fastest moving
astronomical body when viewed from
the Earth and appears to pass through



all the zodiac signs in only 27.322 days.
Generally speaking, crops were
often planted close to the new Moon, so
that they could grow with the face of the
Moon. Whilst there is no known
scientific basis for such ideas, the advice
offered is often very specific and doesn’t
vary much across the world. Nor does
Moon-lore relate only to sowing seeds.
For example, it is suggested that when
picking apples for immediate eating, it
is best to harvest them at the time of the
full Moon, though if they are to be



stored, the new Moon is preferred, since
the apples are believed to be less likely to
rot.
Even today the Moon has always been
important to humanity and it is central
to one of the most important festivals of
the Christian religion. Easter, which falls
in the early spring in the northern
hemisphere, is an ancient celebration of
rebirth that long predates its association
with the death and resurrection of Jesus
Christ.
The New Testament states that



Jesus Christ was crucified on the eve of
Passover before rising again a short time
later. In consequence, the ancient Easter
festival was reassigned to commemorate
this miracle. There was, however,
considerable debate over the date on
which Easter should fall. The early
Christians of Jewish origin celebrated
the Resurrection immediately following
their Passover festival, which, according
to their lunar calendar, fell on the
evening of the full Moon. This was the
fourteenth day in the month of Nisan
(the first month of their year), thereby



causing Easter to fall on different days
of the week. The new breed of non
Jewish Christians from around the
Roman Empire wished to
commemorate the Resurrection on a
Sunday – their newly defined Sabbath.
In 325 AD the Roman emperor
Constantine I convened the Council of
Nicaea to debate whether or not Jesus
Christ was a man or a god. Having
officially designated Jesus to be God, by
a narrow margin, the council then ruled
that the Easter festival should be
celebrated on the first Sunday after the



full Moon following the vernal equinox;
and that if the full Moon should occur
on a Sunday and thereby coincide with
the Passover festival, Easter should be
commemorated on the Sunday
following.
The origin of the word ‘Easter’ is
thought to come from Eostre, the
Anglo-Saxon name of a Teutonic
goddess of spring and fertility. Her
festival was celebrated on the day of the
vernal equinox which now falls around
March 21st when the Sun rises in the



east and sets in the west, and the day
has twelve hours of daylight and twelve
hours of darkness. Traditions associated
with this pagan festival survive in the
idea of the Easter rabbit, a symbol of
fertility, and in brightly decorated Easter
eggs, which were a symbol of rebirth.



‘The important thing is not to
stop questioning.Curiosity has
its own reason for existing.’
Albert Einstein



In the early 1930s a young Scottish
engineer noticed that several of the
widely ignored, prehistoric Megalithic
sites near his home appeared to have
lunar alignments. He decided to study
some of the sites and he began a process
of careful surveying that was eventually
to lead him to make a discovery of
staggering importance.
As a young engineer at Glasgow
University, Alexander Thom visited a
number of prehistoric stone structures
near to his home in Scotland during the



early 1930s. He marvelled at the
grandeur and admired the way so many
of the giant stones had survived the
weathering of more than 5,000 years, as
well as proving resistant to the thieving
tendencies of croft and road builders
across dozens of centuries. As he
contemplated the various sites he
mused over their purpose and as he
looked to the horizon he could imagine
how the stones might have been used as
sighting stones for astronomical
purposes. When he checked out the
rising and setting points of the Sun and



the Moon across the year his hunch
appeared to be born out.
His first survey was at a site known
as Callanish, on the Isle of Lewis in the
Hebrides off the west coast of Scotland.
This complex of standing stones
revealed many astronomical alignments
and is today often referred to as a
‘Moon temple’. Thom went on to
spend nearly half a century carefully
surveying the so-called Megalithic (the
word means giant stones) structures
that lay scattered across the countryside



from the islands off northern Scotland
down to the French region of Brittany.
Along the way he became a highly
respected professor of Engineering at
Oxford University until his retirement
in 1961.
Thom had quickly realized that
these prehistoric builders were engineers
like himself and that they had a
surprisingly sophisticated knowledge of
geometry and astronomy. The
approach taken by this talented
engineer was to assess what he believed



the site had been intended to do – and
then redesign it himself. He quickly
gained an empathy with the Stone-Age
builders that gave him a real insight
into the purpose of each site that would
possibly be lost on a conventional
archaeologist. Once he had a picture in
his mind of what he thought their plan
had been, he went away to create his
own solution to the assumed problem.
Having drawn up his own design he
then returned to compare the site layout
to his own blueprint. Through this
process he could predict the location of



missing stones and, on further
inspection, he would usually reveal the
socket hole that confirmed his theory.
Thom developed a new statistical
technique to establish the relative
positions of the stones and, over time,
something spectacularly unusual
emerged from the amassed data. These
prehistoric builders had not been
lugging huge stones willy-nilly; they had
manufactured these structures working
with a standard unit of measurement
across a huge area of thousands of



square miles of what was then dense
forest and barren moorland.
It was amazing that these
supposedly primitive people could have
had an ‘international’ convention for a
unit of length, but the mystery deepens
because Thom was eventually able to
describe the supreme accuracy of a unit
he called the Megalithic Yard. This was
no approximate measure taken from
paces or body parts; it was equal to
2.722 feet +/- 0.002 feet (82.96656cm
+/- 0.061cm). Thom was also able to



demonstrate that the unit was
frequently used in its double and half
form as well as being broken down into
forty sub-units for use in design work
that he designated as ‘Megalithic
Inches’.
Most archaeologists refuted the
finding on the basis that the idea that a
unit of measurement that was more
accurate than a modern measuring tape
was absurd. Thom admitted that he
could not suggest how it could have
been achieved but he stood by his



evidence that simply said it ‘had’ been
done. In our previous book, Civilization
One, we described how we set out to
investigate the concept of the Megalithic
Yard. Our initial hypothesis was that if
the unit was not an error of Thom’s
data analysis it logically should have
two properties:
1. 1. It should have
an origin in
som ething
m eaningful,
rather than



just being an
abstraction
that was
adopted by
everyone.
2. It should have
a means of
reproduction
that could be
used by
anyone
without
reference to



any sort of
standard
measuring rod,
that would
have been
difficult to
m anufacture
and impossible
to keep
accurate across
centuries.
We realized that our assumption could
be wrong on either or both counts but



as it turned out, we were correct on
both. Thom had not made an error.
As we describe in Civilization One,
the Megalithic Yard is a geodetic unit, in
that it is integral (has a whole number
relationship) to the polar circumference
of the Earth. We found that these early
Megalithic builders viewed a circle as
having 366 degrees rather than the 360
degrees that we use today. We realized
that there really should be 366 degrees in
a circle for the very good reason that
there are 366 rotations of the Earth in



one orbit of the Sun – the most
fundamental of all circles in human
existence.
One solar orbit is, of course, a year
but there is a very slight difference
between the number of rotations of the
planet and the 365 days in a year. This
is because the mean solar day is based
on the time between the Sun being at its
zenith on two consecutive days (86,400
seconds) but an actual rotation or
‘sidereal day’ takes 236 seconds less. All
of those ‘saved’ seconds add up to



exactly one more day over the year. A
sidereal day can be easily appreciated by
observing a star returning to the same
point in the heavens on two consecutive
nights. This is one spin of our planet
because it is unaffected by the secondary
motion of the Earth’s orbit around the
Sun.



Wheels within wheels
Early cultures frequently took their lead
from nature and they were fond of
‘wheels within wheels’. If the circle of
the heavens had 366 parts, why should
every circle not follow the same rule?
We were able to confirm this hypothesis
by a variety of means including
evidence from later cultures that appear
to have adopted the 366-degree
principle.
The approach our Megalithic



ancestors took, we argue, was to
hypothetically divide the circle of the
Earth into 366 degrees with sixty
minutes per degree and six seconds per
minute. It was reasonable to assume
that these ancient builders used the
polar circumference of the Earth that
passed through the area around the
British Isles. Our planet is nearly
spherical but it does have a bulge in the
centre between the poles, so the
equatorial circumference is a little
longer that the polar. There are varying
estimations of the Earth’s polar



circumference, with NASA, for
example, quoting an average figure of
39,941km, whilst other sources
regularly quote 40,006km or 40,010km
– but the most frequently used figure
appears to be 40,008km. Undoubtedly
much depends on where the
measurement is taken or if an average
of them all is calculated.
Interestingly, the shortest polar
circumference (one that has least
landmass) is the one that passes
through the British Isles and is now



considered as the zero line of longitude.
But there is also another
possibility.
Just for interest, we looked at the
flattest possible circumference
achievable on the globe, i.e. a line that
equally bisects the planet that has most
sea and least land. We were amazed to
discover that a person standing in the
middle of Salisbury Plain in Wiltshire,
England (where Stonehenge and the
Megalithic circle at Avebury were built)
is in the absolute centre of such a line.



This means that if we consider
Stonehenge to be the ‘top’ of the world,
the imaginary equator from that point
is almost 98per cent sea – more than
any other point on Earth. This line
passes across the South Atlantic, skims
just below Africa, moves up across the
Indian Ocean, clips small pieces of land
at Banda Aceh, Sumatra, Thailand and
Vietnam, over the South China Sea and
then more than 20,000 kilometres
across the Pacific to pass over a section
of South America.



As far as we know such a line has
not been measured, and we cannot
imagine how it could have been
measured without the aid of modern
satellite technology. However, just
because we do not know how it could
have been done does not mean that it
was not done. Without further evidence
we have to assume that it is pure
coincidence that Stonehenge stands on
the only place on Earth to be
equidistant from the optimum and
near perfect sea-level circumference of
the globe.



We can only assume that a polar
circumference was used and taking the
40,008km figure it translates to
48,221,838 Megalithic Yards using
Thom’s central value for the unit. It was
then subdivided as follows:
Polar circumference
= 48,221,838 MY
1 Degree (1/366th)
= 131,754 MY
1 Minute (1/60th)
= 2,196 MY
1 Second (1/6th) =



366 MY
So, this brilliant system of geometry
starts with 366 degrees and finishes with
seconds of arc that are 366 Megalithic
Yards long. Self- evidently, an amazing
set of ‘wheels within wheels’!
We knew that the system must
work this way because we found that the
later Minoan culture, which developed
on the Mediterranean island of Crete
around 2000 BC, also used the
Megalithic second of arc. However, the
Minoans sub-divided it into 1,000 parts



to become their standard unit of
measure that was equal to 30.36cm.
This unit was dubbed the ‘Minoan
Foot’ by the Canadian archaeologist,
Professor Joseph Graham who first
detected its use in the palaces of ancient
Crete.6
We went on to demonstrate how
any person could generate a highly
accurate Megalithic Yard by measuring
the movement of Venus in the evening
sky using a rope, some twine, a blob of
clay, and a few sticks. The secret was to



take one 366th part of the horizon and
time the passage of Venus across it, and
then to cause a piece of twine with a
blob of clay on the end to swing like a
pendulum 366 times during that
period. From fulcrum to the centre of
the blob was a mathematically perfect
1⁄2 Megalithic Yard or twenty
Megalithic Inches. The process was
simple to carry out and works on the
fact that a pendulum is responsive to
only two factors: the length of the
pendulum and the mass of the Earth. If
the pendulum beat 366 times during



the transit of Venus across a 366th part
of the sky – you had your measure! (See
Appendix 1 for a more detailed
explanation of the pendulum method.)
It is doubtful that these ancient
stonemasons realized the fact but the
period of time that they watched Venus
and elected to subdivide into 366 beats,
is equal to the difference between a
mean solar day and a sidereal day.
Our starting point had been to
search for all possible sources of reliable
measurement available from nature.



And we found that there was only one:
the turning of the Earth on its axis as
seen by watching the movement of the
heavens. It was possible to time the
passage of a star, or in this case the
planet Venus, with reliable accuracy
using a pendulum. The pendulum then
turned a unit of time into a unit of
length because the timed beat will
always produce a fixed length – with
tiny variations due to latitude and
altitude.
It was then a simple matter to turn



a unit of length into a measure of
volume and capacity by creating cubes
and filling them with liquid or dry
goods such as barley or wheat. However,
we were not prepared for the shock we
received when we created a cube with
sides of four Megalithic Inches and
found that it held a pint that was
accurate to a staggering one part in
5,000 against the standard laid down in
the year 1601. Doubling the sides to
eight Megalithic Inches produced an
accurate gallon and doubling again
produced the old dry measure known



as a bushel. The mystery was
compounded when we filled the ‘pint’
cube with barley and found that it
weighed exactly one pound!
Things turned from the sublime to
the ridiculous when further
experimentation showed that a sphere
with a diameter of six Megalithic Inches
held virtually one litre and one ten
times the size weighed a metric tonne
when filled with water; all to an
accuracy of better than 99 per cent.
The fact that Thom’s apparently



meaningless Megalithic Yard, extracted
from surveying hundreds of prehistoric
ruins, produces these cubic and
spherical feats is not debatable. No one,
no matter how sceptical they might be,
can deny the simple maths. Neither can
they deny that the odds of such
compounded apparent connections
being coincidence are very high. Yet, the
pound and the pint are thought to be
Medieval and the litre and the tonne
were invented at the end of the
eighteenth century.



A connection seemed impossible.
Then we looked at the Sumerian
people who lived in the region we now
call Iraq some 5,000 years ago. They are
attributed with inventing writing, glass,
the wheel, the hour, minute and second
of time as well as the 360-degree circle
with its subdivisions of 60 minutes and
60 seconds of arc. Quite amazing
people.
As we probed the achievements of
this civilization we found that the unit
of length the Sumerians had used was



virtually a metre at 99.88cm and that
they had also used weights and
capacities that were as equally matched
to the kilo and litre of the French metric
system created thousands of years later.
Quite a coincidence we thought – but it
was nothing of the kind, for when we
applied the principles of the pendulum
to the Sumerian unit of length called
the ‘double kush’ we found that a
pendulum of this length beat at the rate
of one per second. This meant that the
Sumerian’s key unit of length and their
key unit of time were two sides of the



same coin when used as a pendulum. A
double-kush pendulum would always
beat out a second and a pendulum that
beat at the rate of a second would
always be a double kush in length. This
demonstrates beyond all reasonable
doubt that the Sumerians used
pendulums to define their
measurements. The question was, had
they used the same Venus-watching
principle as the Megalithic builders of
the British Isles to reproduce their units?
Sumerian written records tell us



that the planet Venus was considered to
be the goddess Inanna, who was of
central importance to their culture, so it
seemed entirely plausible. If they had
used the same principle it seemed
logical that they would have employed
their own values; essentially keeping the
same ‘software’ but inputting their own
data. Instead of the 366 degrees of the
Megalithic system we would have to use
the more familiar 360 degrees first used
by the Sumerians. And when we
checked out the results for such a
process – it worked perfectly.



When the horizon was divided into
360 parts and Venus was timed across
that part of the sky at the appropriate
time of year the double-kush pendulum
metres out exactly 240 seconds. And the
period of 240 seconds is recorded as
being so important to the Sumerians it
had its own name – a ‘gesh’. It therefore
seems certain that these people followed
the Megalithic idea of creating a unit of
length from timing the movement of
Venus across the evening sky.



The American connection
Later in our research we came across a
letter written by the great American
statesman, Thomas Jefferson and sent
to the House of Representatives on July
4th 1776. In this letter Jefferson laid out
a recommendation for a new system of
weights and measures for the new
United States that he had helped to
establish. He gave his reasoning and
described some unusual facts he had
uncovered whilst developing his
intended units.



He explained how he had realized
that there was only one aspect of nature
that gave rise to any reliable unit of
measure – which he named as the
turning of the Earth. So, like ourselves
and the Megalithic builders of five and
six millennia before him, he used the
heavens to provide a basis for all
measurement. In his letter he stated
that he had come to realize that the
imperial system of measurement used
in Britain was not an accumulation of
unrelated units as generally imagined.
On the contrary, he said that their



harmony indicated to him that they
were members of a group of
measurement units ‘from very high
antiquity’.
He gave a number of reasons for
this belief including his astonishment
that the foot, made up of twelve inches,
was directly related to the ounce weight
through the use of cubes. He said: ‘It
has been found by accurate experiments
that a cubic foot of rain water weighs
1000 ounces avoirdupois (Imperial).’
It could be coincidence that a cubic



foot holds 1,000 ounces of rainwater,
not 999 or 1,001, but exactly 1,000 – or
that the cube has sides that are a perfect
10 x 10 x 10 one-tenths of a foot. But
Jefferson did not think so. And nor do
we. However, it was Jefferson’s proposed
units that fascinated us. They were
never adopted but their properties are
am azing.
Jefferson’s logical mind also caused
him to use a pendulum to convert time
into a linear unit. He decided that he
should use a pendulum that had a beat



of one second as the basis for his
measuring system. Of course, Jefferson
had no idea that the second had come
from the Sumerian culture or that it
had been created by the use of a
pendulum in the first place. Jefferson
added one improvement suggested to
him by a certain Mr Graham of
Philadelphia – that he use a rigid
pendulum of very thin metal without a
weight on the end because it is more
accurate than a conventional type of
pendulum. The rules change with such
a pendulum (known as a rod). A rod



has to be exactly 50 per cent longer than
a pendulum to produce the same time
period. Jefferson’s timing piece, that
beat once per second, is known as a
‘seconds rod’, and is 149.158145cm in
length.
The world knew nothing of the
Sumerian culture in Jefferson’s time
and he could not possibly have been
aware that his rod that beat once per
second was essentially three kush in
length – just a whisker less than one and
a half metres (remembering that the



metre had not been invented at that
tim e).
The three-kush rod behaves exactly
like a double-kush pendulum and
therefore it beats 240 times during one
360th part of a day; observable by
watching Venus move across a 360th
part of the sky. Jefferson was therefore
accidentally re-enacting the ritual used
by Sumerian astronomer priests nearly
5,000 years earlier and connecting with
the principles of prehistoric
m easurem ents.



The units that Jefferson identified
from this ancient process were all based
on the length of this ‘seconds rod’. He
wrote:
‘Let the second rod,
then, as before
described, be the
standard of
measure; and let it
be divided into five
equal parts, each of
which shall be
called a foot; for,



perhaps, it may be
better generally to
retain the name of
the nearest present
measure, where one
is tolerably near. It
will be about one
quarter of an inch
shorter than the
present foot.
Let the foot be
divided into 10
inches;
The inch into 10



lines;
The line into 10
points;
Let 10 feet make a
decad;
10 decads one rood;
10 roods a furlong;
10 furlongs a mile.’
We can see that his proposed ‘decad’
was based on a double-seconds rod. It
was equivalent to six Sumerian kush,
and his furlong was equal to 600 kush.
This brings about an even deeper



connection with the people of ancient
Iraq because they used a system of
counting that was sexagesimal; which
means it used a combination of base ten
and base sixty. They had a system of
notation that worked as follows:
Step multiple Value
1. 1 1
2. x 10 10



3. x 6 60
4. x 10 600
5. x 6 3,600
It can be seen that the figure of 600 is
indeed a Sumerian value for a
Sumerian unit of length.
But not only is the Jefferson
furlong equal to 600 kush – it is also an
almost perfect 360 Megalithic Yards.



Strangely, Jefferson had connected
well with both the Megalithic and the
Sumerian system. But something even
stranger happened when we took
Jefferson’s furlong and multiplied it by
366 and 366 again:
3662 furlongs = 39,961.257km
As we have already mentioned, the
range of assumed lengths of the Earth
circumference varies by a few kilometres
depending on what source one consults,
probably because each cross section will
differ and tides and plate tectonics



involving mountains leave room for
some debate. At the higher end 40,008
kilometres is widely used, however if we
take NASA preferred figures they quote
a polar radius of 6,356.8 kilometres
which equates to a polar circumference
of 39,941.0 kilometres.
That means that 3662 Jefferson
furlongs match Nasa’s estimate of the
Earth’s size to an accuracy of 99.95 per
cent – which is as perfect as it gets!



Problems with Foucault’s
pendulum
We became more and more fascinated
by everything to do with pendulums.
During one particular telephone
conversation, which had gone on for
over an hour, we had, yet again,
discussed at length the idea that there
might be some unknown law of
astrophysics – that was revealed by
pendulums – at work here. We
considered some highly speculative
thoughts that ranged from standing



electromagnetic sine waves due to a
gyroscopic effect of the Earth’s spin
through to gravitons containing packets
of information about ‘geometrical
shape’. But we agreed that we just did
not know enough to even start to
investigate such ideas. Chris wrote the
following paragraph into a draft of this
chapter as a summary of our mutual
frustration and finished work for the
day.
‘We have to admit
that we still do not



understand why it is
so, but the use of
pendulums in
association with
these ancient values
appears to be
elemental to the
planet Earth – some
physical reality
seems to be at work
here. Every
pendulum reacts to
the mass of the
Earth but there



seems to be some
kind of ‘harmonic’
response at certain
rhythms: points
where the mass and
the spin of the
planet resonate in
some way.’
But at that very point in time everything
changed.
At five o’ clock the following
morning Chris was unable to sleep and
decided to get up and make a cup of



tea. It was then that a ‘library angel’
turned up.7 Looking for something to
read he pulled the delivery sleeve of a
magazine that had arrived in the post
the previous day and flicked it open.
The main feature article in this edition
o f New Scientist was entitled: ‘Shadow
over gravity’. It sounded interesting
even early on a dark November
m orning.
But he quickly realized it was far
more important than merely
‘interesting’. The opening paragraph



was incredibly similar to that which
opens this book, carrying a description
of how it feels to witness a total eclipse
and then it transpired that the thrust of
the article was that solar eclipses have a
profound effect on pendulums! A
debate is presently raging as to why this
should be the case, because the
suggestion has been made that
pendulums may well be the key to a
significant hole in Einstein’s theory of
relativity.
The starting point concerns the



work of Jean Bernard Leon Foucault
who demonstrated a special quality of
pendulums at the Great Exhibition,
held in London in 1851. His
pendulum, now always referred to as
‘Foucault’s pendulum’, is simply a very
heavy weight fastened to a very long
wire attached to a ceiling inside a very
tall building, with a universal joint
allowing it to rotate freely around a
fixed point so that it will swing in a slow
arc in any direction. Giant pendulums
of this kind are now routine exhibits at
some of the major museums around



the world including the Smithsonian in
Washington and the Science Museum
in London.
Once set in motion its direction of
swing will appear to rotate at a rate of
about twelve degrees an hour. But this is
actually an illusion because it is the
observer and the rest of the world that is
moving whilst the pendulum is
maintaining a fixed swing back and
forth in relation to the Universe. This
happens because the pendulum is
independent of the movement of the



Earth, which is rotating underneath the
pendulum, making it appear that the
pendulum is changing direction. The
reason a pendulum swings is because
the Earth’s gravity continually tugs
down on it. According to Einstein’s
general theory of relativity this relentless
tugging is due to the fact that every
mass bends the fabric of space-time
around it causing other masses to slide
down into the dimple it creates in
space-tim e.
The amount of rotation of a



Foucault pendulum is dependent on
latitude. At the North or South Pole the
pendulum appears to rotate through an
entire 360 degrees once every turn of the
Earth (each sidereal day) because the
planet rotates all the way round
underneath it. In the northern
hemisphere at the latitude of the British
Isles the rate of rotation is reduced to
around 280 degrees per day and the rate
of rotation continues to fall the closer
one gets to the equator, where a
Foucault pendulum does not rotate at
all.



For over a hundred years everyone
knew that a Foucault’s pendulum
would swing in an entirely predictable
manner at any specific location. Then
in 1954 a French engineer, economist
and would-be physicist by the name of
Maurice Allais found that this was not
always the case. He was conducting an
experiment at the School of Mining in
Paris to investigate a possible link
between magnetism and gravitation, in
which he released a Foucault pendulum
every fourteen minutes for thirty days
and nights, recording the direction of



rotation in degrees. By chance, a total
solar eclipse occurred on one of those
days.
Each day the pendulum moved
with mechanical precision but on June
30th 1954, when a partial eclipse
occurred, one of Allais’ assistants
realized that the pendulum had gone
haywire. As the eclipse began, the swing
plane of the pendulum suddenly started
to rotate backwards. It veered furthest
off course twenty minutes before
maximum eclipse, when the Moon



covered a large portion of the Sun’s
surface before returning to its normal
swing once the eclipse was over. It
seemed that the pendulum had
somehow been influenced by the
alignment of the Earth, the Moon and
the Sun.
This was totally unexpected and
utterly startling. Allais’ experiment was
being conducted indoors, out of the
sunlight so there was no apparent way
the eclipse could have affected it. Allais
was at a loss to explain what had taken



place but when he conducted an
improved version of his experiment in
June and July 1958 with two
pendulums six kilometres apart he
found the same effect. Then during the
partial solar eclipse of October 22nd
1959, Allais once again witnessed the
same erratic rotation – but this time
similar effects were reported by three
Romanian scientists who knew nothing
of Allais’ work.
Many people have questioned his
results, mainly because science does not



like that which it cannot explain. Many
others have now repeated the
experiment with mixed results: some
found no measurable effect, but most
have confirmed the result at different
locations – including one conducted in
an underground laboratory! 8
It is interesting to note that in 1988
Allais was awarded a Nobel Prize for
economics. Like Alexander Thom (and
many other paradigm busters) a major
discovery had come from someone
working outside their own field. These



are bright people who are driven by
curiosity and who are not the products
of conventional training.
Allais despairs at the standards of
those that oppose without logic or
reasoning: ‘In the history of science,
every revolutionary result meets with
very strong opposition... Relativists say
I’m wrong without providing any
demonstration. Most of them haven’t
even read what I wrote.’
In 1970 Erwin Saxl and Mildred
Allen of Mount Holyoke College,



Massachusetts, studied the behaviour of
a pendulum before, during and after a
total eclipse. The pair took a slightly
different approach to Allais as they used
a torsion pendulum, which is a massive
disc suspended from a wire attached to
its centre. Rotating the disc slightly
causes the wire to twist. When it is
released, the disc continues to twirl first
clockwise, then anticlockwise, with a
fixed period. But during an eclipse, their
pendulum sped up significantly. They
concluded that gravitational theory
needs to be modified.



In India in 1995, D C Mishra and
M B S Rao of the National Geophysical
Research Institute in Hyderabad
observed a small but sudden drop in
the strength of gravity when using an
extremely accurate gravimeter during a
solar eclipse. But results have been
mixed. When the eclipsed Sun rose
above Helsinki on July 22nd 1990,
Finnish geophysicists found no
disturbance to the usual swing, yet in
March 1997 scientists observed
gravimeter anomalies during an eclipse
in a very remote area of north-east



China.
The mystery continues and yet no
academic institution appears willing to
invest time and money to study this
phenomenon in depth. However,
Thomas Goodey, a self-funding
independent researcher from Brentford
in England, has decided that he will
investigate the Allais effect by using
several pendulums during an eclipse.
Because modern equipment is much
more accurate and sensitive than that
available in 1954 – giving twenty to one



hundred times better resolution, he is
confident of a clear result.
Goodey plans to travel the world
over the next few years with twelve
specially constructed pendulums. In
May 2004, he presented his strategy at a
meeting of the Society for Scientific
Exploration in Las Vegas and invited
physicists to join him. As New Scientist
reported, several leapt at the chance.
Goodey suspects that the
anomalies occur when an observer is
near the line that connects the centres of



masses of the Sun and the Moon.
During a total solar eclipse, the Sun
Moon line intersects the surface of the
Earth at two points on roughly opposite
sides of the globe. This theory would
explain why the sunrise eclipse in
Helsinki did not produce a result.
Goodey is quoted as saying that
observations at this ‘anti-eclipse’ point
where no eclipse is visible might carry
much greater weight.
We wait with interest to hear the
final results of Thomas Goodey’s



experiments. At this point it seems as
though we might well have been right to
suspect that pendulums reveal a great
deal about the nature of our planet’s
gravity and its gravitational relationship
with the Moon and the Sun. Could it be
that because the Moon blocks out the
disc of the Sun so perfectly it is acting as
a shield to an ongoing interaction
between the Earth and the Sun? Or
perhaps it is because all three centres of
mass are lined up and something
physical occurs at this time?



We also wonder whether the
unknown individuals who devised the
Megalithic Yard and its inherent
geometry understood much more
about this pendulum effect than we do.
Our previous findings strongly suggest
that they knew a great deal more about
the Earth –Moon–Sun relationship.



A special relationship
Our initial findings about Megalithic
geometry, described in Civilization One,
had caused us to examine all kinds of
unexpected relationships between the
Earth and ancient measures. This had
further prompted us to wonder whether
the 366 geometry, that produced the
Megalithic Yard, was in some way
planet specific. Was there some
connection between the mass, spin and
solar orbit that made it special to the
Earth?



First we applied the principles of
Megalithic geometry to all of the planets
of the solar system. No discernable
pattern emerged – they appeared to be
completely random results. For
example Mars produced 19.78
Megalithic Yards per second of arc and
Venus an unimpressive 347.8. We also
checked out the major moons of other
planets to no avail.
A good friend of Chris, Dr Hilary
Newbigen, suggested that, for
thoroughness, we try using the number



of days per orbit for each planet to see if
there was a relationship to the
individual dimensions, but again the
results were negative.
Then we looked at Earth’s Moon.
The result here was anything but
meaningless. We took the Moon’s
radius, defined by NASA as being
1,738,100 kilometres, to calculate a
circumference of a meaningless
sounding 10,920,800 metres. We then
converted this distance into Megalithic
Yards, which gave us the equally



apparently arbitrary value of
13,162,900.
We then applied the rules of
Megalithic geometry by dividing this
circumference into 366 degrees, sixty
minutes and six seconds of arc. To our
total amazement there were 100
Megalithic Yards per lunar Megalithic
second of arc. The accuracy of the result
was 99.9 per cent which is well within
the range of error of this kind of
calculation.
How strange that the Megalithic



Yard is so elegantly ‘lunardetic’ as well
as geodetic!
Our next thought was the Sun.
Because we know that the Sun is 400
times the size of the Moon it should
logically have a perfect 40,000
Megalithic Yards per second of arc. For
thoroughness we checked out the sums
and it did indeed work as perfectly as
we expected.
This all seemed very odd. The
Megalithic structures that were built
across western Europe were frequently



used to observe the movements of the
Sun and the Moon, but how could the
unit of measure upon which these
structures were based be so beautifully
integer to the circumference of these
bodies as well as of the Earth?
Is it coincidence? On top of all the
other strange facts regarding the Moon
it becomes rather unrealistic to keep
putting everything down to a random
fluke of nature. Of course, we were well
aware that the numbers we were looking
at were only integer when one uses base



ten – and we will deal with that issue
later.
If it is not coincidence then there
are only two other options. The first is
that there is some unknown law of
astrophysics at work, causing
relationships to emerge that were
spotted in some way by our Stone-Age
forebears. The other is conscious design.
The idea of deliberate design
seemed plum crazy – common sense
tells us it’s wrong. Then we, once again,
considered more wise words from



Albert Einstein: ‘Common sense is the
collection of prejudices acquired by age
eighteen.’
At the age of eighteen we, like
everyone else, ‘knew’ that everything in
the world was natural. But when we put
our prejudices of what can and cannot
be, to one side and thought laterally
about it, the more reasonable it seemed.
It was not unreasonable to believe
that the stonemasons of the Neolithic
period were smart enough to measure
the polar circumference of the Earth



and that they devised a unit of measure
that was integer to the planet. Such a
feat can be achieved with very simple
tools as demonstrated by the Ancient
Greeks. But could they really have
measured the circumference of the
Moon and the Sun?
Or was this mysterious property of
pendulums something to do with it?
Most of all we marvelled at the fact
that, yet again, it was the size and
position of the Moon that revealed that
there is an issue to resolve.

Moon is observational error

The one inescapable fact about the
Moon is that it orbits the Earth. It is up
there beaming down on us, but
according to everything that science
knows, it shouldn’t be.
As we have seen, it is known that
people have been Moon-gazing for tens
of thousands of years, and our
understanding has grown to a point
where we are now very confused.
The Greeks were great gatherers of
knowledge and investigators of the rules
of nature. In the fifth century BC



Democritus, who originated the theory
that matter was made of indivisible
units he called atoms, went to the other
end of the scale and suggested that the
markings on the Moon could be
mountains. A little later Eudoxus of
Cnidus, who was an astronomer and
mathematician, calculated the Saros
cycle of eclipses and thereby could
predict when they would appear.
Around 260 BC, yet another Greek
by the name of Aristarchus, devised a
method by which he thought he could



measure the size of the Moon and gauge
its distance from Earth. He never
actually achieved it but a
mathematician and astronomer of
major importance known as
Hipparchus of Rhodes achieved the feat
around a hundred years later. He used
an ingenious technique that was
conducted during a solar eclipse. The
eclipse in question was total in Syene
but only partial in Alexandria which was
some 729 kilometres away. Enlisting the
help of like-minded friends,
Hipparchus was able to use the known



distance from Syene to Alexandria,
together with the angular difference of
the total and partial eclipse to establish
the Moon’s true size and distance from
the Earth.
At the end of the first century AD,
Plutarch wrote a short work about the
Moon, entitled On the Face in the
Moon’s Orb where he suggested that the
markings on the face of the Moon were
caused by deep recesses, too deep to
reflect sunlight. He proposed that the
Moon had mountains and river valleys



and even speculated that people might
live there.
Although a Hindu astronomer,
Aryabbata, repeated and confirmed the
experiment conducted by Hipparchus
as late as 500 AD, Christian authorities
of the time maintained a biblical
approach to the Moon and only
information about our near neighbour
that didn’t contradict the scriptures was
countenanced. With the arrival of
Christianity the world entered a dark
age where scripture rather than science



was the only permitted guide to human
existence.
The grip of the Church slipped
somewhat during the fifteenth and
sixteenth centuries and the Renaissance
(literally meaning ‘rebirth’) emerged
bringing radical and comprehensive
changes to European culture. The
Renaissance brought about the demise
of the Middle Ages and for the first time
the values of the modern world made
an appearance. The consciousness of
cultural rebirth was itself a characteristic



of the Renaissance. Italian scholars and
critics of this period proclaimed that
their age had progressed beyond the
barbarism of the past and had found its
inspiration, and its closest parallel, in
the civilizations of ancient Greece and
Rome. By the end of the sixteenth
century, a genius from the town of Pisa
called Galileo Galilei became one of the
most important scientists of the
Renaissance carrying out experiments
into pendulums, falling weights, the
behaviour of light and many other
subjects that captured his imagination.



Above all, for most of his adult life
Galileo was an avid astronomer.
In May 1609, Galileo received a
letter from Paolo Sarpi telling him
about an ingenious spyglass that a
Dutchman had shown in Venice.
Galileo wrote in April 1610:
‘About ten months
ago a report reached
my ears that a
certain Fleming had
constructed a
spyglass by means



of which visible
objects, though very
distant from the eye
of the observer, were
distinctly seen as if
nearby. Of this truly
remarkable effect
several experiences
were related, to
which some persons
believed while
others denied them.
A few days later the
report was



confirmed by a
letter I received
from a Frenchman
in Paris, Jacques
Badovere, which
caused me to apply
m yself
wholeheartedly to
investigate means
by which I might
arrive at the
invention of a
similar instrument.
This I did soon



afterwards, my basis
being the doctrine
of refraction.’
From these reports, and by applying his
skills as a mathematician and a
craftsman, Galileo began to make a
series of telescopes with an optical
performance much better than that of
the Dutch instrument. His first
telescope was made from available
lenses and gave a magnification of
about four times, but to improve on
this Galileo taught himself to grind and



polish his own lenses and by August
1609 he had an instrument with a
magnification of around eight or nine.
He quickly realized the commercial and
military value of his super-telescope
that he called a perspicillum, particularly
for seafaring purposes. As the winter of
1609 brought colder, clearer nights
Galileo turned his telescope towards the
night sky and began to make a series of
truly remarkable discoveries.
The astronomical discoveries he
made with his telescopes were described



in a short book called The Starry
Messenger published in Venice in May
of the following year – and they caused
a sensation! Amongst many other
findings Galileo claimed to have proved
that the Milky Way was made up of
tiny stars, to have seen four small
moons orbiting Jupiter and to have seen
mountains on the Moon.
As with many of his scientific
investigations Galileo could easily have
fallen foul of the Church authorities if
his drawings of the Moon had been



made public. According to Christian
tradition both the Sun and the Moon
were perfect, unblemished spheres.
They simply had to be so because God
had created them – and none of the
Almighty’s creations could be flawed.
Eventually Galileo was put under
perpetual house arrest by the Papacy for
his blasphemous claim that the Sun was
at the centre of the solar system. It is
therefore quite possible that he knew
more about the Moon than he was
willing to admit in public.



In order to explain the markings
on the Moon without treading on the
toes of the Church, a number of ideas
were put forward in Christian countries.
Perhaps the most popular of these, at
least for a while, was the suggestion that
the Moon was a perfect mirror. If this
was the case there were no markings on
the Moon but rather reflections of
surface features on the Earth. It didn’t
seem to occur to anyone that as the
Moon orbited the Earth the markings
should change, since the land beneath it
would not remain constant.



Another suggestion, and one that
was accepted in some circles, was that
there were mysterious vapours between
the Earth and the Moon. The images, it
was suggested, were present in sunlight
and were merely being reflected from
‘the vapours’. But the most popular
theory, probably because it didn’t
impinge on Christian doctrine, was that
there were variations in the density of
the Moon and that these created the
optical illusions we see as markings on
the Moon’s surface. This unlikely
explanation was safe, though it probably



did little to convince early scientists, and
certainly would not have impressed
Galileo.
After Galileo’s time, telescopes
improved markedly and it was obvious
to anyone who studied the Moon that it
was a sphere with a rocky and
undulating surface. As the Church
gradually lost its power to direct
scientific thought, many of the earlier
ideas regarding the Moon became
unthinkable. But no one had any idea
how the Moon had come into being



and why it occupied the orbit it did
around the Earth.
It didn’t take long for the subject
of the Moon to become very important
to astronomers. Empires such as those
created by Britain, France and Spain,
were expanding. This necessitated long
sea voyages and led to that most urgent
of searches – a way to plot ‘longitude’
whilst at sea. It is quite easy to establish
one’s position on the planet in a north
south line (latitude) but it was
impossible to know where you were in



terms of east–west (longitude). In the
northern hemisphere, for example,
latitude can be quickly gauged by
measuring the angular distance between
the horizon and the Pole Star. This
angle also defines one’s position north
of the equator.
The longitude problem was
eventually solved by having an
extremely accurate clock on board a
ship that was set to the time at one’s
point of departure. It wasn’t difficult to
work out the difference between local



time, say at midday, and the time at the
home port. It was then simply a matter
of adding or subtracting to discover
one’s true position on the Earth’s
surface. This was fine but it took many
decades before a suitably accurate clock
could be created. In the meantime,
astronomers sought for other methods
to determine longitude, not least of all
because there was a fabulous prize on
offer for anyone who could crack the
problem. And the place where many of
them turned to establish longitude was
the Moon.



Astronomers proposed that if
really accurate tables were kept of the
Moon’s position relative to the
background stars it would be possible to
assess the true time of day in one’s
home port. The reason this could work
was that the Moon, being very close to
the Earth and orbiting quickly, moved
across the heavens by around thirteen
degrees of arc per day. Using the Moon
it was a fairly simple matter to establish
‘local time’ and then to do the necessary
computations to discover one’s
position.



The lists of tables necessary to
accomplish the task were not so simple,
however, and as soon as good
chronometers were available the Moon
was abandoned as a means for
longitude assessment. However, the
desire to solve this problem, and the
potential profitability of doing so,
meant that the Moon was receiving a
great deal of attention during the
seventeenth century and very accurate
maps of its surface began to appear.
It wasn’t until the nineteenth



century, however, that probably the first
reasoned explanation as to the Moon’s
origin was put forward. George Darwin,
the son of Charles Darwin, the
controversial Englishman who first
proposed the theory of natural selection,
was a known and respected astronomer
who studied the Moon extensively and
came up with what became known as
the ‘fission theory’ in 1878. George
Darwin may have been the first
astronomer to ascertain that the Moon
was moving away from the Earth.
Working backwards from his



knowledge of the rate the Moon was
receding from the Earth, Darwin
proposed a time that the Earth and the
Moon could have been part of the same
common mass. He suggested that this
molten, viscous sphere had been
rotating extremely rapidly in about five
and a half hours.
Darwin further speculated that the
tidal action of the Sun had caused what
he termed as ‘fission’ – a Moon-sized
dollop of the molten Earth spinning
away from the main mass and



eventually taking up station in orbit. At
the time this seemed very reasonable
and was the favoured theory by the
beginning of the twentieth century. In
fact the fission theory did not come
under serious attack until the 1920s
when a British astronomer called
Harold Jeffries was able to show that the
viscosity of the Earth in its semi-molten
state would have dampened the
motions required to generate the right
sort of vibration necessary to fulfil
Darwin’s fission.



A second theory that once
convinced a number of experts was the
‘coaccretion theory’. This postulates
that the Earth, having already been
formed, accumulated a disc of solid
particles – a little like the rings of
Saturn. It was suggested that, in the case
of the Earth, this disc of particles
ultimately came together to form the
Moon. There are several reasons why
this theory can’t be the answer. Not least
is the problem of the angular
momentum of the Earth–Moon system
that could never have been as it is, if the



Moon had formed in this way. There
are also difficulties regarding the
melting of the magma ocean of the
infant Moon.
The third theory regarding the
origin of the Moon that was in
circulation around the time that the
first lunar probes were launched was the
‘intact capture theory’. At one time
seeming to be the most attractive
possibility, the intact capture theory
suggested that the Moon originated far
from the Earth and that the Moon



became a ‘rogue’ body that was simply
captured by the gravitational pull of the
Earth and that it took up orbit around
the Earth.
There are many reasons why the
intact capture theory is now
disregarded. Oxygen isotopes of the
rocks on the Moon and on the Earth
prove conclusively that they originated
at the same distance from the Sun,
which could not be the case if the Moon
had been formed elsewhere. There are
also insurmountable problems in trying



to build a model that would allow a
body as big as the Moon to take up
orbit around the Earth. Such a huge
object could not simply drift neatly into
an Earth orbit at low speed like carefully
docking a super-tanker – it would
almost certainly smash into the Earth at
a massive speed or possibly skim off
and hurtle onward.
By the middle of the 1970s all
previous theories about the way the
Moon had been formed were running
into trouble for one reason or another



and this created a virtually unthinkable
situation in which acclaimed experts
might have to stand up in public and
admit that they simply didn’t know
how or why the Moon was there. As
acclaimed science writer William K
Hartmann, senior scientist at the
Planetary Science Institute, Tucson,
Arizona said in 1986 in his book Origin
of the Moon:
‘Neither the Apollo
astronauts, the
Luna vehicles, nor



all the king’s horses
and all the king’s
men could
assemble enough
data to explain the
circumstances of
the moon’s birth.’ 9
Out of this miasma came a new theory
and, in fact, the only one that is
presently widely accepted despite some
fundamental problems. It is known as
the ‘Big Whack theory’.
The idea came out of theories that



originated in the Soviet Union in the
1960s – specifically the work of Russian
scientist V S Savronov, who had been
working on the possibility of planetary
origins from literally millions of
different-sized asteroids known as
planetesim als.
As a divergence from the Soviet
ideas, Hartmann, together with a
colleague, D R Davis, suggested that the
Moon had come into being as a result
of the collision of two planetary bodies,
one being the Earth and the other a



rogue planet at least as large as the
planet Mars. Hartmann and Davis
hypothesized that the two planets had
collided in a very specific way that
allowed jets of matter to be ejected from
the mantles of both bodies. This matter
was thrown into orbit, where it
eventually came together to form the
Moon.10
The suggestion seems to have
many merits. First and foremost it
appears to address the greatest puzzle
that the recovery of Moon rock had



thrown up: How was it that the
composition of the Moon was so similar
to that of the Earth, but only in part?
A close analysis of Moon rock has
shown that it is very similar to the rock
that forms the mantle of the Earth, yet
the Moon is nowhere near as massive as
the Earth in proportional terms. (The
Earth is only 3.66 times as big as the
Moon but has eighty-one times the
Moon’s mass.) It was obvious that the
Moon could not contain many of the
heavy elements that are found inside



the Earth and the Big Whack theory
purported to explain why this was the
case. The Earth and the rogue visitor
had come together in a very specific
way. Although they would eventually
form one planet it was reasoned that
they must have impacted, drawn apart
and then come together again.
Computer modelling showed that
under these very special circumstances it
would have been possible for the
material thrown off to have been
mantle material, from close to the
surface of the two bodies.



Although the theory eventually
gained ground, at first it seemed so
improbable that it was generally
rejected. But with the passing of time,
further work showed that such an
unlikely scenario could conceivably have
taken place. In 1983 an international
conference was held at Kona, Hawaii, to
try and solve the problems regarding
the origins of the Moon. It was at this
meeting that the Big Whack theory, also
known as the Giant Impact Hypothesis
of the Collision Ejection theory, began
to gain ground. Hartmann’s own



suggestions, together with those of other
scientists at the conference, formed the
nucleus of the 1986 book, Origin of the
Moon, which was edited by Hartmann
him self.
In the intervening period several
experts have created computer models
that purport to add weight to the Big
Whack theory and the most convincing
of these are those of Dr Robin Canup,
who is now Assistant Director of the
Department of Space Studies in
Colorado, USA. Canup wrote her PhD



dissertation on the Moon’s origin and
specifically the Big Whack theory. Her
early work led to the conclusion that the
suggested impact would have actually
led to a swarm of moonlets, rather than
the Moon, but by 1997 further
computer modelling resulted in a
model of the impact that would lead to
the Moon’s presence.
Despite the fact that the Big
Whack theory is now generally accepted
by most authorities, it has many
problems. Not least of all is that



recognized by Robin Canup herself as
she admits that there is one key aspect
of the theory that doesn’t make sense.
This stems from the fact that other
researchers have pointed out that such a
massive impact as that proposed could
not have failed to speed up the rotation
of the Earth to a level far beyond today’s
situation. Canup agrees and the only
way that she could deal with this
anomaly is to propose a second major
impact – which was designated ‘Big
Whack II’. This suggests that the second
planetary collision happened perhaps



only a few thousand years after the first
one but, quite incredibly, this incoming
object came from the opposite direction
and so cancelled out the huge spin
imparted to the Earth by the first
cataclysmic event. This balanced double
act sounds unlikely in the extreme. Two
cosmic collisions that just happen to
precisely return the planet to its natural
rhythm? To us, this explanation smacks
of desperation!
Canup herself is not happy with
Big Whack II and is hopeful of



modifying the original theory so that it
can account for the present rate of spin
of the Earth.
There is another big problem to
overcome if the Big Whack theory is to
be taken seriously. When rocks were
brought back from the Moon, both by
American astronauts and Soviet
unmanned Moon missions, they were
subjected to every conceivable test. The
observed fact that put paid to the
captured asteroid theory of the Moon is
also a gigantic stumbling block to the



Big Whack theory. It has been observed
that the oxygen isotope signatures of
Moon rocks are identical with those of
rocks from the Earth – and that fact has
some serious implications: Moon rocks
and Earth rocks can only have the same
oxygen isotope signature if they
originated at the same distance from
the Sun. This would mean that the
Mars-sized body that hit the Earth must
have occupied a similar orbit to that of
the Earth and yet had already managed
to survive for many millions of years
before it hit the Earth.



That does not sound reasonable.
This situation is extremely unlikely
and it throws up other difficulties. The
present obliquity of the Earth (its
twenty-three degree tilt against the plane
of its orbit around the Sun) is usually
deemed to be the result of the giant
impact, but any body of the size of
Mars that was in an orbit similar to that
of the Earth could not have had
sufficient momentum to knock the
Earth’s angle of rotation back so
severely. Either the rogue planet was



Mars-sized, and came from way out in
the solar system and was therefore
travelling extremely fast, or else it had to
be at least three times the size of Mars,
which doesn’t tie in with the computer
models as they stand.
Some of the other problems were
cited by Jack J Lissauer, a well-respected
scientist from NASA’s Ames Research
Center in an article he wrote for Nature
in1997.11 Lissauer is said to have joked
to his students about a remark made by
another scientist, Irwin Shapiro from



the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
Astrophysics: ‘The best explanation for
the Moon is observational error – the
Moon does not exist!’
Lissauer’s article pointed out some
of the problems with the Big Whack
theory. He made it clear that in his
opinion the latest research
demonstrated that much of the
material blown out by the impact (the
ejecta) would have fallen back to the
Earth. He says:
‘The implication



here is that lunar
growth in an
im pact-produced
disk is not very
efficient. So, to
form our Moon,
more material must
be placed in orbit at
a greater distance
from Earth than
was previously
believed.’
Lissauer made it clear that as a result,



he too is of the opinion that the rogue
planet must have been substantially
larger than that originally proposed but
noted that it is difficult to see how the
excess angular momentum resulting
from such a large impact could have
been lost.
Three other scientists, Ruzicka,
Snyder and Taylor, approached the
problem from a slightly different
direction by analysing the biochemical
data available against the theoretical Big
Whack. After a detailed examination



they concluded: ‘There is no strong
geochemical support for either the
Giant Impact or Impact-triggered
Fission hypotheses.’12
These words used in the
conclusion to this biochemical analysis
indicate just how hopelessly contrived
the whole Big Whack theory is. They go
on to say: ‘This [hypothesis] has arisen
not so much because of the merits of
[its] theory as because of the apparent
dynamical or geochemical short
comings of other theories.’



In other words scientists hang onto
the Big Whack theory, even though it
has more holes than a rusty colander,
simply because no other logical
explanation has been found. It is just
the least impossible explanation for a
celestial body that has no right to be
there.
Not only is the Big Whack theory
discredited on a number of grounds by
the scientific fraternity itself, it also
singularly fails to deal with the
anomalies thrown up by our own



research, as outlined throughout this
book. Big Whack cannot explain the
extraordinary ratio relationship between
the Moon and the Sun or the Moon
and the Earth. The Moon could, by
pure chance, end up being exactly
1/400th the size of the Sun and
occupying an orbit that allows it to
stand 1/400th the distance between the
Earth and the Sun – but the odds are,
quite literally, astronomically against it.
The Moon is proportionally bigger
in relation to its host planet than any



other in the solar system apart from
Charon, Pluto’s moon, which is more
than half the diameter of Pluto. These
two bodies are essentially twin planets or
may be asteroids orbiting each other at
close range although they are believed to
have an unrelated origin.
Mercury has no moons at all and
neither has Venus. Mars does have two
moons but they are tiny in comparison
with our own.
A close examination of the many
samples of Moon rock brought back by



the American Apollo missions and the
Soviet unmanned missions has thrown
up what turned out to be one of the
biggest surprises of all. It has been
observed that the oldest of the rocks
collected from the Moon are
significantly more ancient that any rock
ever found on Earth. The most
venerable rocks to be found on the
Earth date back 3.5 billion years, whilst
some samples from the Moon are
around 4.5 billion years old – which is
very close to the estimated age of our
solar system. When radioactive dating



techniques are applied to meteorites
they are uniformly found to be 4.6
billion years old.
Yet even these rocks have the same
oxygen isotope signature as those on
Earth, another indication that the Moon
has occupied its present distance from
the Sun for an incredibly long time.
There is currently no persuasive
argument for this state of affairs.
Our own, almost accidental,
discoveries regarding the peculiar ratio
relationships between the Earth, Moon



and Sun described in our previous
book, Civilization One,13 led us to an in
depth appraisal of the latest theories
regarding the Moon and its origins. We
were stunned by what we discovered.
The Moon is bigger than it should be,
apparently older than it should be and
much lighter in mass than it should be.
It occupies an unlikely orbit and is so
extraordinary that all existing
explanations for its presence are fraught
with difficulties and none of them could
be considered remotely watertight. We
came to realize that many reputable



experts across the world have significant
misgivings about current theories
concerning the Moon’s origins that, as
we have shown in this chapter, they
were quite willing to voice publicly.
No matter how much the
advocates of the Big Whack theory may
claim they have solved the puzzle that is
the Moon, it is quite obvious that this
claim is far from being true. The Moon
remains, to borrow the words of
Winston Churchill, ‘a riddle wrapped in
a mystery inside an enigma’.



‘We choose to go to the moon.’
President John F Kennedy: September 12th,
1962
After the end of the Second World War,



rocket scientists from Germany were
‘liberated’ by both the United States and
the Soviet Union, and by the beginning
of the 1950s these experts were put to
work on creating weapons of various
sorts that would fuel the Cold War
between the Eastern communists and
the Western capitalists. On the
American side the most famous of the
German experts was Vernher Von
Braun who had created the V1 and V2
rockets for Nazi Germany and who
eventually went on to design the Saturn
V rocket that would take people to the



Moon.
At the outset the USA focused its
attentions on developing new types of
small but immensely powerful
hydrogen bombs based on nuclear
fusion whilst the USSR continued to
refine the older and much heavier
fission bomb. The Soviets therefore had
to develop more powerful rockets and
the R-7 missile, capable of carrying a
five-tonne warhead, was the result.
Their Chief Designer, Sergei Korolyov,
realized that these rockets would also be



capable of putting a one-and-a-half
tonne satellite into Earth’s orbit and he
put forward his plan for such a mission.
Korolyov’s project was well under
way when news came that the US was
developing its own satellite launch,
known as Project Vanguard. This new
challenge set up a ‘race to space’ and
Korolyov’s main satellite project was
temporarily suspended as all efforts
became focused on the early launch of a
smaller artificial satellite that could be
built far more quickly. Sputnik lifted



into the skies on October 4th 1957.
This first spacecraft was a forty
pound sphere that carried a simple
transmitter so that it could make
meaningless, but technical sounding,
bleeping sounds at which the world
could marvel. The acclaim and sheer
excitement caused by Sputnik’s success
led the Soviet leader, Nikita Khruschev,
to demand more high-profile stunts
rather than a return to serious science.
The team responded immediately by
screwing together the original Sputnik’s



backup spares to create a second
Sputnik. They had only a few weeks as
they were instructed that the next
launch must happen before November
7th – the fortieth anniversary of the
Great October Revolution.
Sputnik 2 was something of a
botched job but it captured the
imagination of the planet because it
took off four days ahead of the
anniversary and, amazingly, it was
carrying a passenger: a dog called Laika.
Unfortunately for this canine hero, her



ticket was strictly one way because this
hastily assembled craft had no
mechanism for a controlled return to
Earth – so the animal was destined to
die in orbit from the outset. It is
thought that she lived for four days in
space before suffering a painful death as
the cabin overheated. The fatality was
part of the plan and the mission was
considered a success as it proved that a
living creature could survive the journey
into orbit. So despite the fact that
Sputnik 2 was initiated as a publicity
stunt it was an important prelude to a



human being making the trip.
The first two Sputniks were
therefore politically inspired projects
carried out by Sergei Korolyov under
orders from the Kremlin and it was not
until May 15th 1958 that his original
spacecraft was launched – now
designated Sputnik 3. This was a serious
piece of equipment that was an
automated scientific laboratory. It
carried twelve instruments providing
data on pressure and composition of
the upper atmosphere; concentration of



charged particles; photons in cosmic
rays; heavy nuclei in cosmic rays;
magnetic and electrostatic fields; and
meteoric particles. And it was Sputnik 3
that first detected the presence of the
outer radiation belts that surround the
Earth.
The United States was highly
embarrassed by the Soviet
achievements, and particularly so
because it was having little success with
its own rocket launchers. So many of
them blew up on the launch pad or



during takeoff that the world’s press
variously dubbed the American space
mission ‘Kaputnik, Flopnik, and
Stayputnik’.
In the summer of 1958 the
Western world was rocking and rolling
to Elvis Presley’s ‘Hound Dog’,
‘Heartbreak Hotel’ and ‘Jailhouse Rock’
whilst the politicians of the ex-Russian
territory of Alaska were lobbying to be
accepted as the 49th State of the Union.
In Washington, however, the US
government’s main focus was on



something much more important – a
new idea that was going to be a grand
solution to a double-edged problem.
Their first concern was Sputnik.
These high-profile launches had very
effectively announced to the world that
Soviet scientists were smarter than
American ones and it was also implicit
that the ‘bad guys’ had the technology
to deliver heavy nuclear weapons
around the planet. America had fallen
well behind in the race for definitive
military advantage and the idea of a



‘first strike’ by the Soviets suddenly
seemed possible and, for some, even
probable given the USA’s current
inability to respond in kind.
The second problem was one of
internal power blocks. The US Army
and Navy were politically untouchable
and each had separate rocketry
programmes causing duplication of
effort that was dramatically slowing
down the rate of overall progress. In the
light of all this, Congress decided to side
step military fiefdoms and set up a new



organization to oversee and coordinate
American space research.
Accordingly the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA) was formed on October 1st
1958 and the idea of putting a man into
space was immediately outlined, and
given the title ‘Project Mercury’. But it
was a race they were destined to lose
because on April 12th 1961 cosmonaut
Yuri Gagarin became the first human to
travel into space.
Gagarin’s 108-minute voyage took



him once around the planet, although
he was not allowed to operate the
controls because the effects of
weightlessness had only been tested on
dogs, and scientists were concerned that
he may not be able to function
properly. Consequently, ground crews
controlled the mission with an override
key provided just in case of an
em ergency.
NASA responded quickly by
sending the astronaut Alan Shepherd
on a ballistic trajectory sub-orbital flight



to an altitude of 116 miles, returning to
Earth at a landing point just 302 miles
down the Atlantic Missile Range.
America’s first manned space flight was
a fifteen minute sky rocket event that
was nowhere near the same league as
Yuri Gagarin’s 25,000 mile, high-speed
voyage into Earth’s orbit.
The race to get a man into space
had been won by the USSR but there
was a second, more ambitious
competition running in parallel.
Reaching for the Moon!



At first these were half-hearted
attempts to get some metal, any bit of
metal, onto the Moon. It had started
with the first Pioneer rocket launched in
1958 by the United States – which
lasted a full seventy-seven seconds
before disintegrating into a giant
fireball. A few months later the USSR
launched Luna I, which performed
beautifully but unfortunately missed the
Moon and headed into solar orbit. In
September 1959 the USSR managed to
hit the bull’s-eye when Luna 2 became
the first craft to land on another celestial



body, slamming into the Moon’s
surface just east of the Sea of Serenity.
Before the impact Luna 2 was able to
report back that there was something
very odd about the Moon – it did not
seem to have a magnetic field.
The next Soviet craft, Luna 3,
made a great stride forward by swinging
around the Moon, taking photographs
of the ‘dark’ side before heading back to
Earth in April 1960. The Americans
meanwhile had failure after failure.
Nikita Khrushchev was pleased



with the way that his nation was
winning the space race and when Yuri
Gagarin had orbited the Earth his
propaganda machine went into
overdrive to ensure that the world knew
how superior his space engineers were.
America’s newly elected President was
no slouch when it came to inspiring the
public and John F Kennedy decided to
take control of the situation by
announcing that the real battle was to
put men on the Moon. Despite a
history of underperformance in space
technology, he rather bravely publicly



pledged to land a man on the Moon
before the end of the 1960s.
Many American Ranger and Soviet
Luna spacecraft headed for the Moon
during the decade but a large number
missed and others crashed onto the
lunar surface either by accident or
sometimes by design. But it was the
USSR, once again, that made the next
breakthrough when Luna 9 became the
first spacecraft to make a controlled
landing onto the surface of another
celestial body on February 3rd 1966.



A significant part of the problem
was the weird nature of the Moon’s
mass that was not at all what was
expected. Instead of a generally constant
gravitational field such as the Earth
exhibits across its surface, the Moon is
an inconsistent, lumpy ball that has
huge variations in gravity from region
to region.
As we have discussed, a pendulum
swings with fairly regular precision on
the Earth, with only quite small
variations in swing rate because of the



bulging of the planet at the equator.
This is due to the fact that a person
standing at sea level at the equator is a
little further away from Earth’s dense
core than someone closer to one of the
poles. Using a pendulum on the Moon
would not produce any meaningful
result because of what are known as
‘m ascons’.
The term mascon is an
abbreviation for ‘mass concentration’
regions of the Moon that have hugely
dense material below the surface, rather



than in the core as everyone would
naturally expect. These mascons made
it very difficult for spacecraft to orbit
close to the Moon without continual
adjustments to compensate for the
variations in gravity. Some observers
believe that it was this gravitational
minefield that caused all of the
problems for the early probes that were
directed on the basis of a homogeneous
gravity.
The existence of mascons was
discovered after Lunar Orbiter 1 went



into orbit around the Moon on August
14th 1966 and sent back high-quality
images of over two million square miles
of lunar surface, including the first
detailed images of potential landing
sites for the planned Apollo missions.
This new discovery of gravitational
‘hotspots’ on the Moon had an impact
on a man who is arguably the greatest
science fiction writer of all time and an
acknowledged inspiration to NASA.
Arthur C Clarke combined forces with
film director Stanley Kubrick to write



and shoot the most realistic space
adventure ever. When their film 2001: A
Space Odyssey premiered in April 1968,
it stunned audiences across the world
with its beautifully produced vision of
the future.
The plot of the film starts millions
of years ago when our ancestors were
still apelike creatures without speech or
tools. There is a visitation from some
undisclosed power in the form of a jet
black and perfectly finished rectangular
monolith that stands upright. When



touched by the probing fingers of the
gang of primates at dawn the monolith
somehow remaps their brains to begin a
process that will take these proto
humans on the evolutionary road to
intellectual development. As the camera
pans up the length of the monolith the
Sun and the Moon appear directly
overhead as though an eclipse is about
to occur. The scene then leaps forward
to the beginning of the twenty-first
century when a powerful magnetic
anomaly is discovered just below the
surface of the Moon in the Tycho crater



and excavations are carried out to
discover what is causing the effect. A
black monolith, some four metres tall is
uncovered and a team of experts sets
out from Earth to investigate the clearly
artificial phenomenon.
The team travel to the Tycho
crater as the Sun rises and wearing
spacesuits they walk down a ramp into
the pit where the monolith stands just a
few metres below the surface. Like the
man-apes millions of years earlier the
team leader, Dr Floyd, is mesmerized



by this alien structure and he touches it
with his gloved hand. A moment later a
ray of sunlight comes over the edge of
the pit and strikes the monolith,
signalling the end of the dark lunar
night that lasts for two Earth weeks.
This time, as we look up the monolith
we see the Sun and Earth hovering
directly above and almost touching.
Then suddenly, the object transmits a
signal in the direction of one of the
moons of Jupiter (in Clarke’s novel
version this was changed to Iapetus, one
of Saturn’s moons).



The ingenious idea that Clarke put
forward here was astonishingly close to
the real-world discovery of the lunar
mascons that had been made around
the time he was writing. The similarity
between Clarke’s magnetic anomaly
and the gravitational anomalies are
obvious. We wonder whether Clarke
was aware of the newly discovered
mascons and whether that gave him the
idea of a kind of trip switch placed on
the Moon in the extreme past by some
alien intelligence to trigger a signal that
told them that creatures from the Earth



had become smart enough to reach the
Moon and spot a serious abnormality.
What a brilliant concept!
If an alien intelligence had indeed
been responsible for the evolution of
humans from ape to technologist, then
what better way would there be of
setting up an alarm system to confirm
our intellectual ‘arrival’.
At the time that Clarke and
Kubrick’s film was first capturing the
imagination of a generation, no human



had yet reached the Moon. But the
following year, with less than six
months to go to the late President
Kennedy’s deadline, Commander Neil
Armstrong stepped out onto the surface
of the Moon on July 20th 1969 with his
famous but slightly misdelivered line:
‘That’s one small
step for man, one
giant leap for
m ankind.’
At this point we must mention that
there are some people who seriously



believe that NASA faked the Moon
landings on a film set just like the one
used by Stanley Kubrick. The evidence
they produce looks reasonable at a
casual glance; assuming you know
nothing at all about photography or the
facts relating to lunar conditions. These
ideas suddenly leaped into the public
imagination on February 15th 2001
when Fox television in the USA
broadcast a programme called
Conspiracy Theory: Did We Land on the
Moon? The thrust of the show was that
NASA technology in the 1960s was



simply too primitive to have taken men
to the Moon, and because they were so
close to President Kennedy’s politically
important deadline they fabricated the
entire mission in a movie studio.
To them the fraud was obvious.
They point out that shots of the
astronauts on the lunar surface show a
completely black sky without any stars.
Had this proved too difficult for the set
constructors to fake they ask? The
answer is actually very simple. As any
proficient photographer knows, it is



difficult to capture something extremely
bright and something else extremely
dim in the same shot. This means that
for the stars to be visible, the lunar
surface and the astronauts would have
been burned out into a white blaze; the
emulsion on a piece of film does not
have enough dynamic range to capture
both ends of the brightness scale
sim ultaneously.
Amongst the other pieces of
‘evidence’ was the issue of the flapping
flag. The NASA set designers were



apparently so dumb that they allowed a
stiff breeze to waft through the studio
causing the flag that the astronauts
planted to wave about. As the Moon has
no atmosphere this is said to prove that
it was filmed on Earth.
The fact is, the flag waved about so
much precisely because there was no
atmosphere. When astronauts planted
the flagpole they rotated it back and
forth to ensure that it penetrated the
lunar surface causing the flag to wobble
from side to side on its supporting



frame. On Earth the presence of an
atmosphere quickly dampens this
motion as the surrounding air absorbs
the energy from the moving flag,
whereas in an airless environment the
flag has nothing to dampen its motion.
It could therefore keep going for many
hours before the energy finally
dissipated.
So anyone who has seriously
looked into the case for and against the
actuality of the Moon landings cannot
fail to reject every one of the strands of



evidence put forward by the conspiracy
theorists. We do believe that
conspiracies happen, because people
will conspire together for all kinds of
reasons – but the Apollo 11 mission was
certainly not one of them.
We can be certain that twelve
astronauts walked on the Moon between
1969 and 1972 and that they brought
back 842 pounds of the Moon in the
form of rocks, core samples, pebbles,
sand and fine dust from six different
exploration sites.



The last human being to walk on
the Moon was Eugene Cernan in
December 1972 and the information
gathered over those three years, and
later by Russian unmanned craft, has
greatly increased our knowledge of the
Moon. But it has also posed as many
questions as it has answered.
It was expected that the samples of
Moon rock would prove one of the
existing theories about the Earth–Moon
system. If the rock from the samples
had been substantially different from



rocks on Earth, then it was likely that
the Moon had originated in some other
part of the solar system and had been
captured by the young Earth. If the
Moon was identical in every way to the
Earth, then it was likely they had both
come into existence together and at the
same time. However, it soon became
apparent that both theories had to be
wrong and no logical explanation for
the Moon, being what it is and where it
is, exists even now.
The convoluted ‘Left hand/right



hand double big whack’ theory tends to
crudely fill the void, to prevent us
worrying too much about this hole in
our knowledge of our planet and its
neighbour. Whilst most people believe
this rather unlikely hypothesis to be
true, the people involved with
developing it acknowledge that it is
improbable. All existing theories of the
Moon’s origin have problems and the
University of Wisconsin has pointed out
that those for the Big Whack include:
1. It requires that the entire



Moon be initially molten
and accreted from
devolatilized material i.e.
it does not account for
the Moon’s lower
mantle’s apparently
largely undifferentiated
com position.
2. It requires that the
impactor be accreted
from the same oxygen
reservoir as the Earth (a
previous moon of



Earth?).
3. It does not account for a
necessary density reversal
below the upper mantle.
4. It requires that
differentiation of the
Earth and the impactor,
and their impact, occur
within the 5HF/W 55
million-year model age
for the lunar magma
ocean.



5. It does not account for
the cumulative effect of
many large impactors on
the Moon’s non-parallel
rotational axis.
6. It does not account for
the necessary chronology
of tidal separation of the
Earth and moon origin
of the Moon.
There is also another major problem
with this scenario revealed by the issue
of the ongoing slowing down of Earth.



Very precise astronomical
measurements, some of them dating
back to the observation of eclipses 2,500
years ago, indicate that the day is
increasing in length by about one or two
thousandths of a second per day per
century. It has been thought that this
tiny lengthening of the day was entirely
due to the friction of the tides caused by
the Sun and the Moon. But when
attempts were made to predict changes
in the apparent position of the Moon
on the basis of this effect alone, it was
found that the calculations did not



agree with the observations at all.
Another factor must be at work as well.
That factor was that iron is sinking
to the core of the Earth, changing the
moment of inertia and thereby the
length of the day. When this was taken
into consideration and calculations were
made on the basis of both the tides and
the changing moment of inertia due to
sinking iron, the sums did agree with
the observations. But in order to make
the calculations agree, it was necessary
to postulate a flow of 50,000 tonnes of



iron from the mantle to the core of the
earth every second!
Staggering though this volume of
flow is, it would still take 500 million
years to form the metallic core of the
Earth and some calculations indicate
that it may have taken as long as two
billion years. If this reasoning is correct,
which it appears to be, the Earth was
made initially with large amounts of
iron in its exterior parts. As the Moon
was formed at a very early stage in the
Earth’s existence (and possibly before),



any material knocked off the surface by
a major impact would contain large
amounts of iron – which it does not.
The Big Whack theories are simply
the best of all the impossible
explanations for the existence of the
Moon.
It is widely accepted that despite
the intense investigation that has gone
into understanding the Moon, and for
all we know about its surface and the
composition of its rocks, we are as
much in the dark concerning its origins



as we were before the first projectile left
the Earth’s atmosphere.
As we have discussed, the oxygen
isotope investigation proved that both
Moon rocks and Earth rocks must have
developed at exactly the same distance
from the Sun, so the Moon definitely
wasn’t a captured asteroid. The Moon
has its fair share of the elements found
on Earth but not in the same
proportion. The Moon is substantially
lacking in heavy metals when compared
with the Earth, which accounts for its



large size but small mass.
But it was the Apollo missions that
identified something else that was weird
about the Moon.



‘Houston, we’ve got a
problem’
The first two Apollo crews had landed
out on the smooth lunar mare, the lava
seas that are relatively young by lunar
standards, and now NASA wanted to
visit a site where they could study the
older parts of the Moon, which meant
the rugged highlands. Although NASA
was not ready to commit a lunar
module (LM) to a landing in highly
rocky terrain, the site selection
committee was very interested in a place



called the Fra Mauro Hills in the
middle of the Ocean of Storms, which
seemed like a fairly smooth section of
the highlands.
Commander Jim Lovell along with
Jack Swigert and Fred Haise were
chosen for the Fra Mauro mission as
the crew of Apollo 13. The launch, on
April 11th 1970, went well, allaying the
worst fears of those who were concerned
about a mission with the unlucky
number thirteen.
Then, fifty-five hours and fifty-five



minutes into the mission (and on the
thirteenth day of the month) all three
astronauts heard and felt what they
described as a ‘pretty large bang’ on
board the spacecraft. The crew and the
ground controllers made a rapid
assessment of the health of the
spacecraft and it was obvious that two
of the three fuel cells in the service
module were dead. No one knew exactly
what had gone wrong but there was no
doubt that the crew were in serious
danger.



To survive they needed enough
power, oxygen, and water for a four-day
trip around the Moon and back to
Earth, and it now looked as if these
commodities were going to be in very
short supply. Oxygen and hydrogen
were normally combined in the fuel
cells to produce electricity and water
and both oxygen tanks were rapidly
losing pressure so even the remaining
fuel cell wouldn’t last long. In addition
to short supplies of these basic
commodities, without power in the
command module, they would have to



rely on the LM environmental control
system to remove excess carbon dioxide
from the cabin. And to add to their
many woes, the main engine now had
no power supply.
However, the flight crew and
ground personnel all realized just how
lucky they had been. As desperate as the
situation was, the accident had come
early in the mission and they still had
their fully stocked lunar module as a
resource. The LM had an engine that
could be used to put the crew back on a



homeward path, and it carried just
enough water, oxygen, and power for
the four days they need to fly around
the Moon and head home.
As the stricken spacecraft swung
behind the Moon, 164 miles above the
surface, contact with the Earth was lost
until it emerged on the other side and
was again picked up by tracking
stations. The following words were
heard: ‘The view out there is fantastic...
You can see where we’re zooming off.’
At 8:09 pm EST on April 14th,



Apollo 13 turned for home and the
third stage of the Saturn V launch
vehicle, weighing fifteen tonnes, was
sent crashing into the Moon. As
planned it struck the Moon with a force
equivalent to 111⁄2 tonnes of TNT. The
impact point was eighty-five miles west
northwest of the site where the Apollo
12 astronauts had set up a seismometer.
NASA reports demonstrate the
reaction of scientists on Earth as the
Saturn V hit the lunar surface – ‘The
Moon rang like a bell.’



In November 1969 the Apollo 12
crew had sent their lunar module
crashing into the Moon following their
return to the command craft after their
lunar landing mission. That lunar
module had struck with a force of one
tonne of TNT causing the shock waves
to build up to a peak in eight minutes
and then continue for nearly an hour.
The seismic signals produced by the
impact from Apollo 13 were twenty to
thirty times greater and lasted four
times longer than those resulting from
the earlier LM crash. This time, peak



intensity occurred after seven minutes
and the reverberations lasted for three
hours and twenty minutes, travelling to
a depth of twenty-five miles, leading to
the conclusion that the Moon has an
unusually light core or possibly no core
at all.
At the time Houston remarked to
the Apollo 13 crew: ‘By the way,
Aquarius, we see the results now from
12’s seismometer. Looks like your
booster just hit the Moon, and it’s
rocking a little bit.’



NASA reports how the
information from these two artificial
moonquakes led to a reconsideration of
theories proposed about the lunar
interior. Among the puzzling features,
they say, are the rapid build-up to the
peak and the prolonged reverberations,
because nothing comparable happens
when objects strike Earth.
When Chris was in Seattle a few
years ago he had a meeting with Ken
Johnston who had worked for Brown
Root and Northrop, which was a



consortium between the Brown-Root
Corporation and the Northrop
Corporation at the Lunar Receiving
Laboratory. The company was one of
the prime contractors for NASA at the
time of the Apollo missions and Ken
was supervisor of the data and photo
control department. Ken told Chris that
at the time of the impact created by the
Apollo 13 launch vehicle the scientists
were not only saying that ‘the Moon
rang like a bell’, they also described how
the whole structure of the Moon
‘wobbled’ in a precise way, ‘almost as



though it had gigantic hydraulic
damper struts inside it.’
This ringing effect caused many
people to pick up on speculation that
had been going on for years that the
Earth’s Moon could be hollow. Back in
1962 Dr Gordon McDonald, a leading
scientist at NASA, published a report in
the Astronautics Magazine where he
stated that analysis of the Moon’s
motion indicated that the Moon is
hollow.
Dr Sean C Solomon, who was



Professor of Geophysics at MIT and is
the Director of the Terrestrial
Magnetism Department, Carnegie
Institution of Washington as well as the
Principal Investigator for Carnegie’s
research as part of the NASA
Astrobiology Institute, has said: ‘The
lunar orbiter experiments vastly
improved our knowledge of the moon’s
gravitational field...indicating the
frightening possibility that the moon
may be hollow.’
Why should this be frightening?



Carl Sagan, Professor of
Astronomy and Space Sciences and
director of the Laboratory for Planetary
Studies at Cornell University hinted at
the answer when he said, whilst
discussing the moons of Mars, that ‘It is
well understood that a natural satellite
cannot be a hollow object.’14
The problem therefore is simple
if the Moon is hollow, someone or
something manufactured it.
But the debate continues. A team
from the University of Arizona in



Tucson has detailed the results of their
interpretation of data from the Lunar
Prospector magnetometer where they
estimate that the moon does have a tiny
metal core that is roughly 420 miles
(680km) across, plus or minus 112
miles (180km). Their team leader, was
Lon Hood. ‘We knew that the Moon’s
core was small, but we didn’t know it
was this small,’ Hood said. ‘This really
does add weight to the idea that the
Moon’s origin is unique, unlike any
other terrestrial body – Earth, Venus,
Mars or Mercury.’15



So, it is possible that the Moon is
hollow at its centre or has a very small
core. There is also the possibility that it
has voids in its make-up just as it has
the super-dense zones we call mascons.
But it seems that the structure is
unusual whatever the case turns out to
be.
The main argument against the idea of
a hollow Moon that we found repeated
time and again, was that there was no
theory of the Moon’s origin that could
explain such a circumstance. The



argument goes: ‘Because we can’t
explain how a natural satellite can form
with a hollow centre – it cannot have
one QED.’
This standpoint is fair enough – if
you accept its founding premise, that
the Moon is natural. And who would
not make such an assumption?
But as we put aside all of our
preconceptions about what can and
cannot be, we have to accept that solid
objects do not ring like a bell – but
hollow ones do.



Hollow or not, we decided to look
more closely at the mechanics of the
Moon.



We had seen just how peculiar the
Moon is, in so many ways. Our next
step was to look into how our next-door
neighbour in the cosmos actually affects
life on Earth.
First of all we could not ignore the
myth that the full Moon brings out



madness and other evils in the form of
more violence, more suicides, more
accidents and more aggression – ideas
that are possibly as old as history itself.
The belief that the full Moon causes
mental disorders and strange behaviour
was particularly widespread throughout
Europe in the Middle Ages.
But is there any scientific evidence
to support these beliefs?
There have been many
investigations into the subject and some
have produced surprising results.



Research carried out by a medical team
at a hospital in Bradford, England, set
out to test the hypothesis that the
incidence of animal bites increases at
the time of a full Moon. Using
retrospective observational analysis at
their accident and emergency
department they investigated the
pattern of patients who attended from
1997 to 1999 after being bitten by an
anim al.
The number of bites in each day
was compared with the lunar phase in



each month and they found that the
incidence of animal bites rose
significantly at the time of a full Moon.
With the period of the full Moon as the
reference point, the incidence rate ratio
of the bites for all other periods of the
lunar cycle was significantly lower. They
concluded that the full Moon is
associated with a significant increase in
animal bites to humans.16
Of course, we must remember that
correlation does not equate to causation.
The pattern they found may be a



strange statistical blip or, even if it is
real, it could be entirely coincidental
with the phases of the Moon. Without
any suggestion of how the Moon could
cause an increase in animal aggression
towards humans, it is not possible to
consider any connection as proven.
Another study looked into human
aggression and the lunar synodic cycle
occurring in Dade County, Florida.
Data on five aggressive and/or violent
human behaviours were examined to
determine whether a relationship existed



between the two. These included
looking at the pattern of homicides,
suicides, fatal traffic accidents,
aggravated assaults and psychiatric
emergency room visits.
The team concluded that
homicides and aggravated assaults
demonstrated a statistically significant
clustering of cases around the full
Moon. Psychiatric emergency room
visits clustered around the first quarter
and showed a significantly decreased
frequency around new and full Moon.



The suicide curve showed correlations
with both aggravated assaults and fatal
traffic accidents suggesting, they say, a
self-destructive component for each of
these behaviours. The existence of a
biological rhythm of human aggression,
which resonates with the lunar synodic
cycle was postulated.17
Whilst these investigations were
carried out carefully and scientifically it
is important to remember that there are
dozens of other studies that have failed
to identify similar correlations. If there



is some substance behind lunar myth it
is yet to be proven. However, we feel
that such a relationship is not beyond
reason as the Moon exerts considerable
gravitational effects on the Earth
creating the tidal movements of the
waters of our oceans, and humans are
made up of nearly eighty per cent water.
Whether or not lunar cycles affect our
lives; solar ones certainly do.



The Four Seasons
At the time of writing these words the
leaves on the trees here in Britain are
beginning to be tinged with brown. The
days are growing shorter and the nights
are getting longer. As this happens, the
average temperature each day begins to
fall and much of our flora and fauna
goes into a dormant state.
Of course, the same seasonal
change is happening all across the
northern hemisphere at latitudes



between the Tropic of Cancer and the
Arctic Circle. Meanwhile, countries in
the southern hemisphere are entering
spring and new growth is beginning to
stir as the days lengthen and the average
daily temperature increases. All of us
who do not live on or near to the
equator are familiar with the pattern of
the changing seasons and the effect that
these cycles have on the way we live our
lives. To our ancestors in northern parts
of Europe, Asia and America, the onset
of winter must have been a time of fear
and doubt, whilst the first buds of



spring would have been a merciful relief
with the signal that there would soon be
fresh food to eat.
What most of us don’t stop to
think about is why seasons happen at
all. It is a common misunderstanding
to imagine it has something to do with
how close the Earth is to the Sun. It is
not – it is due to the angle of the planet
in relation to the Sun, which is about
22.5 degrees from what might be
described as a vertical position. The
diagram below shows how the Earth



would look if it was standing upright as
it goes around the Sun, which would
mean that the equator of the Earth
would always point straight at the
equator of the Sun.
Figure 5
If our planet really did stand in



If our planet really did stand in
this position, the bulge of the Sun’s
equator and that of the Earth would be
closer together than the Sun’s poles and
the Earth’s poles. The result of this
would be a super-hot equatorial
temperature on the Earth, whilst the
polar regions of the Earth would be
much colder than they presently are.
Strangely enough it’s not so much a
case of the difference in distance
between the Earth and the Sun that
matters; it is more to do with the
thickness of the atmosphere above any
given part of the Earth in relationship to



the direction of the Sun. In the
imaginary situation above, sunlight has
to travel through far more atmosphere
to get to the poles of the Earth than it
does to reach the equator, thus greatly
reducing the heat.



Figure 6
Another important factor that
reduces the heat at the poles is



diminished power density, where the
Sun’s energy is dissipated across a
greater area as the Earth curves away
from an upright position. For example,
a circle of sunlight with a one-kilometre
diameter will hit the Earth’s surface as a
near perfect circle at the equator, but in
extreme northern or southern latitudes
it will be distorted into a long oval due
to the curvature of the planet. This
means that the heat of the sunlight at
the poles will be spread over several
times the area and therefore be several
times weaker.



The planet Mercury is an excellent
example of a world that is standing
virtually upright, in relation to its orbit
around the Sun. Apart from the fact
that little Mercury is so close to the Sun,
its angle of inclination, or ‘obliquity’ as
it is more properly called, would make
it a very uncomfortable place for
humans. If it were possible to stand on
Mercury during one of its very short
eighty-eight-day years, the Sun would
rise due east every day (which is equal to
fifty-eight Earth days) at the equator
and set due west. Mercury has



equatorial temperatures that would
keep lead boiling, yet probes sent from
Earth have shown that the polar regions
of Mercury are constantly covered in ice.
So, if the Earth were in this upright
mode, life would be almost impossible
across much of the planet, with
extremes of temperature providing only
a narrow band suitable for mammals
such as humans to survive. Even then,
the sea and air currents would move
wildly between the hot and cold zones
causing catastrophic weather conditions



with regions of permanent rainfall and
others with none at all. Hurricanes and
tornadoes would ravage many areas and
overall it seems extremely unlikely that
higher life forms would ever develop on
such a planet.
Now consider another imaginary
scenario in which the Earth is tilted on
its axis a full 90 degrees relative to its
orbit around the Sun so that one pole
faces the Sun at all times.



Figure 7
One of the poles, say the South
Pole, would be permanently in daylight
– stuck for ever in a position equivalent
to noon on midsummer’s day in central
Africa. The Sun would blaze down from
directly overhead every minute of every



day! The North Pole on the other hand,
would be in a state of constant
midnight. Indeed, all of the northern
hemisphere would be in constant night
and the southern in constant day.
The dark side of the planet would
never warm up and it would be frozen
solid with temperatures far below
anything we actually experience. The
region that is currently between our
equator and the Tropic of Capricorn
would see the Sun circling right around,
low on the horizon once each day.



Because of the angle of the sunlight
through the atmosphere, there would be
very little warmth getting through and
the entire region would be covered in
glaciers and swept with snowstorms
driving down from the dark northern
hem isphere.
Antarctica would be utterly
uninhabitable, being far hotter than
anywhere on our planet as we know it
today. Only the southern tip of South
America, Tasmania, New Zealand and
maybe the southern section of Australia



would have temperatures that were
within a tolerable range. But it is hard to
imagine what kinds of terrible weather
anyone living there would have to
endure, with freezing ocean currents
moving from the north and very hot
ones arriving from the south. A state of
permanent fog seems certain; which
would in turn block out the Sun.
If the Earth orbited the Sun in
either of the two modes we have just
described, there would be no seasons at
all – and almost certainly no higher life



form s.
Thankfully we do have seasons,
courtesy of the fact that the Earth is
actually at an angle of around 22.5
degrees relative to the equator of the
Sun. And that angle is maintained by
the Moon, which acts as a gigantic
planetary stabilizer.



Figure 8
Because of this tilt, the northern
hemisphere experiences summer when
the Earth is on that part of its orbit that
angles it more towards, the Sun.
Therefore the Sun rises higher in the sky
and is above the horizon longer, and the
rays of the Sun strike the ground more



directly. Conversely, when the northern
hemisphere is oriented away from the
Sun, the Sun only rises low in the sky, is
above the horizon for a shorter period,
and the rays of the Sun strike the
ground more obliquely.
Figure 9
Whilst it is true that the extreme



polar regions of the Earth are frozen
throughout the year, the tilt angle of
22.5 degrees ensures that most parts of
the Earth’s surface get a fair share of
warmth throughout each year. This in
turn means that by far the vast majority
of water on the surface of the planet
remains in a liquid state. All of life is
utterly dependent on water and cannot
exist without it. The band of
temperatures at which water is liquid is
really very narrow. The oceans of the
Earth would freeze at around 1.91°C,
with boiling point occurring at 100°C.



The Earth is therefore extremely
well balanced. The coldest temperature
ever recorded was -89.2°C (-128.6°F) at
the Vostok Station in Antarctica and the
highest was 58°C (136°F) at El Azizia in
Libya. That is a range of absolute
extremes of less than 148°C, which is
very little indeed in terms of the entire
spectrum. The coldest anything can get
is known as ‘absolute zero’ when all
molecular motion stops. This occurs at
a rather chilly -273.15°C (-459.67°F).
On the other hand there is no



known upper limit for temperature but
the hottest temperature in our solar
system is the Sun’s core, which comes
in at an impressive 15,000,000°C
(27,000,000°F).
The normal temperature range on
Earth is such that there are very few
parts of the globe that cannot support
human life. We have a normal range of
body temperature between 36.1 to
37.8°C (97 to 100°F) and yet the Inuit
people live happily within the Arctic
Circle and the Bedouin travel the deserts



of North Africa.
The world’s average temperature
fluctuates slightly around the 14.5°C
(58°F) mark, which is comfortable for
physical work. Of course, some people
will say that the world ‘is’ that
temperature and that we would not
have evolved as we have if it were any
different – but this is flawed logic. We
could just as well have evolved in a
world where only small sections of the
planet were available to us to inhabit.
No other known planet has such a



narrow temperature band – and a range
of temperature that permits water to be
liquid most of the time.
In fact water is a very curious
substance altogether. On Earth we can
see it at the same time in its three states
– as solid ice, as liquid water and as a
gas in clouds. Each water molecule is
composed of just two atoms of
hydrogen and one of oxygen and yet it
acts as a universal solvent with a high
surface tension.
Perhaps most surprising of all is



how its density changes. Water has its
maximum density at 4°C which means
that it not only gets lighter as it warms
from that point – it also gets lighter as it
cools. As everyone knows, warm water
rises as convection currents but it is also
true that ice floats. Other planets in our
solar system may have ice or steam but
only the Earth is awash with life-giving
liquid water.
Liquid water has been absolutely
crucial in creating the world we know
today and, as far as is known, life



cannot exist without it. As surely as
plate tectonics and the Earth’s hot core
constantly create new mountain ranges,
via volcanoes and the pushing up of
mountains as land masses meet, so
water is mainly responsible for
flattening them again. Constant
weathering crumbles away the rocks as
mountains age and water, in the form
of rain, ice and snow, is primarily
responsible. Liquid water, as streams
and rivers, also disperses the weathered
rock, carrying it down to the plains
where it is distributed across flatter land,



bringing much needed nutrients to
nourish life. Even more nutrients are
carried by the rivers to the oceans where
they offer the necessary food for aquatic
plants that stand at the bottom of the
oceanic food chain.
Of course, none of this would be
possible if the vast majority of water on
the Earth was not in a liquid state. Only
two per cent of Earth’s water is locked
up in glaciers and the icecaps, with
ninety-seven per cent being the water of
our seas and oceans and just one per



cent available for human consumption
as fresh water. With only a small change
in the overall temperature of the Earth,
or an alteration in the seasonal patterns,
the nature of the water on our planet
would change. As we have seen, a more
pronounced planetary tilt could well
lead to a freezing of the oceans. This
would result in an overall loss of
temperature at the surface of the planet,
with even greater freezing.
On the other hand, if the Earth
were not tilted at all, the equatorial



regions would become unbearably hot
and weather patterns across the planet
would be radically changed. In
addition, the biodiversity, that scientists
are now certain has been so important
to our evolution, might never have
developed in a world with more
polarized areas of temperature.
It has therefore been vital for our
existence that the tilt of the Earth has
been maintained at around 22.5 degrees
for an extremely long period of time,
and yet, bearing in mind the



composition of the planet this is a very
unlikely state of affairs. Venus is the
nearest planet to Earth and the most
similar to our own, but it has toppled
over in the past and other planets in the
solar system show signs of having varied
markedly in their tilt angle across time.
The Earth is very active internally and
highly unstable, yet, despite a few
periodic wobbles, it keeps the same
angle relative to the Sun.
Astronomer Jacques Laskar, a
Director of Research at the National



Scientific Research Centre (CNRS) and
head of a team at the Observatory of
Paris is in no doubt that the Earth
would indeed topple over, if it were not
for the presence of the Moon!18
With computer modelling, Laskar
showed in 1993 that all the other Earth
like planets (Mercury, Venus and Mars)
have highly unstable obliquity, which,
in the case of Mars for example, varies
wildly across time between 0 degrees
and 60 degrees. The same computer
modelling indicates that in the case of



the Earth the obliquity would vary even
more, between 0 degrees and 85 degrees
– but for the stabilizing influence of our
incredibly large Moon.
Nobody knows for certain how
long it would take for the Earth’s
obliquity to change significantly if the
Moon was not exerting such a massive
influence. There is a constant transfer of
energy taking place between the two
bodies, which in addition to stabilizing
Earth’s obliquity has also significantly
slowed our planet’s rate of spin. This



constant obliquity has made the Earth a
perfect crucible for advanced life by
providing many millions of years of
stability for life to develop from its
simplest form to the complex patterns it
adopts today.
Although the Earth is significantly
more massive than the Moon, the
Moon is still a very large body. Tides in
Earth’s oceans, seas and lakes are caused
by the gravitational interaction of the
Earth, the Moon and the Sun. Tides
have an effect on dry land as well as



oceans but this effect can only be
detected by careful measurement. Solar
tides (the point of greatest gravitational
pull by the Sun) are twelve hours apart
but since the Moon is also moving,
lunar tides are slightly more irregular,
occurring every 12.42 hours on average.
The height of tides in any
particular part of the ocean is
dependent on a number of factors such
as the shape of any nearby landmasses
and the depth of the seabed. In some
areas of the world, tides hardly seem to



lift the level of water at all – this is just
as well for some low-lying places such as
the islands of the Maldives in the Indian
Ocean because their average height
above sea level is less than one metre. In
other places, like the British coast, tides
can have a huge range between high and
low water.



Figure 10
The Moon has sufficient gravity to pull a bulge of
water from the oceans of the Earth closest to its
position towards it. It also distorts the Earth, creating
a corresponding bulge in the oceans on the opposite
side of the Earth. Because of the Earth’s rotation the
bulge on the Moon side runs slightly ahead of the
Moon.



Tides would not cease if the Moon
were not present because they are also
created by the Sun. However, they
would be very much lower than they are
now because although the Sun is
massive and the Moon much smaller,
the Moon is extremely close and the
Sun much more distant. It is the
interaction of solar and lunar tides that
makes it rather complicated to predict
when tides will occur and how high or
low they are likely to be.
The highest of the lunar tides



occur when the Moon is either in its full
or new mode, because at such times it is
in line with the Sun and its gravitational
forces are added to those of the Sun.
Much lower tides are on the first and
last quarters of the Moon when the
gravity of the Moon and the Sun are
working against each other.
Life in the tidal margins of the
oceans and seas has evolved to take
advantage of tides, either in a daily or a
monthly sense. Some species of crabs
for example, lay their eggs in the sand at



the high-water mark at the time of the
full or new Moon so that they will be
safe from marine predators during
incubation. There are also many
creatures that leave the ocean on the
high tide at night to scavenge in the
inter-tidal margins, before seeking safety
with the next high tide.
Many shellfish are absolutely
dependent on the ebb and flow of the
tides for the purpose of feeding and it
was shown in the 1960s that oysters are
sensitive enough to be aware of the



Moon’s position, either overhead or at
the opposite side of the planet. Oysters,
which obviously have no eyes, were
taken from the ocean and placed in
tanks in the Rocky Mountains where
they began to open and close, as they
would have done in the ocean, had it
extended so far inland. Because other
stimulus such as current or wave
motion were absent, it suggests that they
are able to feel minute increases and
decreases in the gravitational pull of the
Moon and the Sun.



If molluscs, our very distant
evolutionary cousins, can somehow
sense such astronomical movements
then there would seem to be no reason
why humans would not be able to do
the same. This just might point the way
forward in investigating a possible
causation for variations in human
behaviour according to the phase of the
Moon.
It probably is not too surprising
that some creatures have learned to
exploit tides, which are tiny these days



in comparison with the remote past
when the Moon was much closer to the
Earth. The tremendous forces created
by a very close Moon would have
generated much heat and might even
have caused parts of the Earth’s surface
to melt. However, this phase did not
last all that long because the very
transfer of energy that promotes tides is
also causing the Moon to drift further
and further away from the Earth. This
happens because the Earth rotates
around its own axis more quickly than
the Moon revolves around the Earth.



The rapid rotation means that the tidal
bulge of the Earth forward of the Moon,
(see figure 11) is always ahead of the
Moon’s position. The tidal bulge exerts
a pull on the Moon and this increases
the Moon’s overall energy. Meanwhile,
friction between the Earth’s surface and
its own oceans is actually slowing the
rate of Earth rotation. It is not much,
but it does amount to around 0.002
seconds in a century.
The end result of this dance will be
that the Moon will continue to move



away from the Earth until a situation of
equilibrium is achieved, which is
expected to happen in about fifteen
billion years. The Moon will then be 1.6
times further out from the Earth than it
is now and the Earth will have a solar
day that is equal to the orbit of the
Moon, which by then will be fifty-five
days. However, we do not have to lose
too much sleep about this eventuality
because the Sun will have become a red
giant about a billion years before that, at
which time the Earth will have ceased to
exist in any case.



Figure 11
As the Earth revolves, it takes the tidal bulges with it,
but because of the gravity of the Moon, the water in
the bulges is trying to travel in the opposite direction.
As a result, waves ground on the bottom of the oceans
and on seashores, causing friction. The friction slows
the Earth and the energy is passed to the Moon, which
responds by speeding up. As it does so, the laws of
physics dictate that its orbit must widen.
Over huge periods of time the



Over huge periods of time the
relationship between the Earth and the
Moon changes, so we find ourselves
living in what amounts to a ‘tiny
snapshot’ of the overall situation. At
present the Moon takes 27.322 days to
go around the Earth and because the
Earth is also going around the Sun, full
and new Moons are ruled by a slightly
longer cycle that takes 29.53 days. Both
these figures have been significantly
different in the past and will be different
again in the future but the changes are
very slow and, according to NASA, the
Moon is becoming more distant from



the Earth by around 3.8cm per year.
Perhaps it is just as well that an
expanding Sun will overtake us before
the Moon does get to its final position
relative to the Earth. By the time the
Moon and the Earth reach their
ultimate stations, the Moon will be too
distant to exert enough influence on our
planet to keep its obliquity steady.
Bearing in mind the Earth’s unstable
core, this would almost certainly mean
rapid and perhaps catastrophic changes
in both obliquity and climate.



Neil F Comins, Professor of
Physics and Astronomy at the
University of Maine, has written about
the consequences if the Moon did not
exist. He explains that the Earth would
be turning so fast that a day would take
just eight hours and complex life would
not exist yet. If higher life forms did
eventually manage to evolve, such
creatures would be very different to us
without, for example, any
communication through speech.19
One thing is certain then: no Moon



would mean no humans!



Humans are incredibly robust creatures
considering we are little more than
animated bags of water hanging on a
mineral frame. We can withstand
difficult conditions and even survive
without food for many weeks, yet we die
quickly without air to breath or with



direct exposure to unusually high or low
temperatures. It is thanks to eons of
Darwinian evolution that we are
perfectly designed for our environment
– but perhaps we should not be too
casual about the extraordinary good
fortune that brought us to this point.
Every human is very special. We
differ from other creatures, so we are
told, because we are able to define
ourselves by our own self-awareness
resulting in a situation where there is a
simple polarity to the Universe. We all



know that: ‘There is me and then there
is everything else.’ Each and every one
of us is an emotional-intellectual island
connected to that ‘everything else’ by
the complex interaction of our five
senses.
Two small regions of our skin have
developed the ability to decode energy
reflections in the form of sight, two
more make sense of a cacophony of
colliding compression waves in the gases
around us giving us hearing. Then we
have skin sensitive enough to tell us



about shape and texture, a mouth that
accurately differentiates between
different chemical substances we are
about to consume in the form of taste
and we have an air inlet that can pick
out the presence of a specific molecule
within a million others in the
atmosphere as the sense we call smell.
These five connection modes cause
us to have interaction with the
‘everything else’ – especially other
humans, so we do not exist alone. These
points of stimulus combine to give life



to the most remarkable array of aspects
of self. Love, fear, loathing, compassion,
laughter and countless other emotions
make us special and mark us out as
entities that are utterly different to the
rest of creation.
But how and why have we become
so spectacularly differentiated from
other combinations of recycled stardust?
What makes Neil Armstrong more
special than the 3.5-billion-year-old
rock he first lifted from the lunar
surface?



Those with religious faith turn to
their interpretation of God to explain
the unexplainable and the more
scientific amongst us turns to the
Anthropic Principle. The good old
‘Anthropic Principle’ is less there to help
us answer the BIG question than to
avoid having to deal with it. It accepts
the vanishingly tiny probability of
human existence by stating that the
rules of the Universe that produced us
have to be exactly as they are or we
would not be here to perceive them.



To us, this is rather like defining
moving, emotionally stimulating music
by merely expressing it as ‘music that is
good’. The statement is correct but it
does not compare with the experience!
What the Anthropic Principle does
is to stop us worrying too much about
the fact that we really have no right to
exist. Of the two approaches, anthropic
or divine, at least the God scenario is an
attempt to move the problem on a
notch rather than utilizing a principle
that seems to have been conceived to



ignore it.
Most scientifically minded people
probably subscribe to the theory that
humans, like everything else, are the
product of billions of years of random
chance. However, the most famous
scientist of all time, Albert Einstein, was
very unhappy about nature being based
on randomness. He said about
quantum physics: ‘God does not play
dice.’
The more we looked into how our
planet developed into a paradise for



living creatures the more surprised we
became. The miracle of life on Earth is
due to our narrow temperature band
that provides us with liquid water and,
as we have explained, it is the Moon
that is responsible for maintaining the
perfect tilt that provides our benign
climate. But amazingly, it was the very
act of the Moon’s creation that
produced the first link in the chain of
events that would lead the Universe to
make you!
In 1911 a brilliant young scientist by the



name of Alfred Lothar Wegener was
browsing through the library of his
university in Marburg, Germany, when
he came across a scientific paper that
listed a host of identical plant and
animal species that could be found on
opposite sides of the Atlantic. Although
having obtained a PhD in astronomy at
a very early age, Wegener was
particularly interested in geophysics, a
field of study that was in its infancy at
the time.
Something in the paper caught



Wegener’s imagination and he began to
spend time looking for other examples
of similar plants and creatures
separated by oceans. There was, at the
time, no reasonable explanation as to
how such a state of affairs could have
come about. It had been postulated that
the solution to this puzzle had to be
land bridges that must have existed in
very ancient times and that had allowed
both plants and animals to move
between continents. However, there were
many examples that could not be
explained in this way.



Wegener had also noted, as had
others before him, how many cases
there were in which the coastline of one
continent looked as though it could fit
snugly into that of another, such as the
west coast of Africa and the east coast of
South America. He also found that if
the continental shelf is studied, rather
than the apparent coastline shaped by
current sea level, the fit is often very
much better.
Alfred Wegener began to ask
himself if the answer to these anomalies



might lie not in land bridges but in the
fact that the continents were once joined
together in one large continent, and that
this had somehow broken up and
drifted apart. Later in his life he wrote
about this process of logical deduction.
‘A conviction of the fundamental
soundness of the idea took root in my
m ind.’
Wegener spent a considerable
period collecting further examples of
extended flora and fauna and the
available evidence continued to support



his early theory. For example, he found
the fossils of plants and creatures in
places where the climate must have
been significantly different when they
were alive and flourishing, such as
fossilized cycads – ancient tropical
plants found as far away from the
tropics as Spitsbergen in the Arctic.
From the weight of evidence he
had collected, Wegener deduced that all
the continents had once been part of a
single landmass, which he chose to call
‘Pangaea’ – a Greek word meaning ‘all



the Earth’. He suggested that this super
continent had broken up and had
begun to drift apart 300 million years
ago. He called the process ‘Continental
Drift’ and although he wasn’t the first
to suggest that there had originally been
a single continent, he was able to
provide substantial evidence to back up
the claim. Wegener first published his
findings and his hypothesis in his book
The Origin of Continents and Oceans.20
Although it was brilliantly argued, his
ideas were not widely accepted at the
tim e.



A flood of scientific indignation
broke over Alfred Wegener. This
happened for a couple of reasons:
firstly, his theory was revolutionary,
which inevitably clashed with the
conservative tendencies of other experts;
and in addition, although Wegener was
certain that continental drift must have
taken place, he had no theory as to how
or why this might have happened. The
best he could suggest was that the
continents, influenced by centrifugal
and tidal forces as the Earth spun on its
axis, were simply ploughing their way



across the surface of the planet.
Dissenters pointed out that, if this
was the case, the coastlines of the
continents could hardly be expected to
have remained so similar to the original
‘fit’ that it could still be observed. On
the contrary, they would have been
distorted beyond recognition. It was also
suggested that tidal and centrifugal
forces would be far too weak to move
entire continents.
Poor Alfred Wegener didn’t have
the chance to look too much further



into the matter; he died in 1930 whilst
taking part in a rescue mission to
deliver food to a party of explorers and
scientists trapped in Greenland.
Wegener did have some notable
supporters but in general his ideas
remained on the shelf until as recently
as the 1950s, by which time greater
exploration and understanding of the
Earth’s geophysical makeup had begun
to catch up with the idea of continental
drift. The truth of the matter is that
Wegener was wrong in terms of his



suggested mechanism, but quite correct
in his basic assumption. Rather than
ploughing their way across the planet’s
surface, the continents ‘float’ on what is
known as the ‘asthenosphere’, the
underlying rock of our planet. This is
under so much pressure and becomes
so incredibly hot that it acts more like
thick treacle than solid rock.



Figure 12
One of the factors that made Wegener’s
ideas more acceptable was the study of
mountain ranges. An earlier position



held by many experts had been the
‘contraction theory’. This suggested that
the Earth had begun its life as a molten
ball and that as it cooled it had cracked
and folded up on itself. This folding,
the theory suggested, was what had
created mountain ranges. The real
problem with the contraction theory
was that all mountain ranges should
therefore be of the same age and it was
rapidly becoming apparent that this
could not be the case. Wegener had
suggested that mountains were
constantly being created as landmasses



came into contact, exerting unbelievable
pressure and pushing up land at or
close to the points of contact.
Just a year before Alfred Wegener’s
death some corroborative evidence had
been forthcoming, but it wasn’t well
accepted at the time. In 1929 Arthur
Holmes, a physicist at the Imperial
College of Science in London suggested
that the mantle of the Earth undergoes
‘thermal convection’. The Earth’s
mantle is that region immediately
below the outer crust. It extends all the



way down to the Earth’s core. Its
composition varies with increased
pressure and temperature but it makes
up the biggest part of the Earth.
Holmes knew that when a
substance is heated, its density
decreases. In the case of the mantle this
would cause material to rise to the
surface where it would gradually cool,
become denser and then sink again. A
similar process takes place with porridge
that is boiling in a saucepan. Holmes
was quite taken with Wegener’s idea of



continental drift and suggested that the
tremendous pressures caused by
thermal convection could act like a
conveyor belt. This might cause the
continents to break apart and to be
‘carried’ across the surface of the planet.
For years these ideas were
dismissed, until knowledge caught up
with the theories. By the 1960s there
was a greater understanding of the
‘oceanic ridges’–regions where, it was
being realized, Holmes’ thermal
convection might actually be taking



place. It was also realized that oceanic
trenches occurred, together with arcs of
islands, close to the continental
margins. All of this meant that
convection was not only probable but
certain. Two other scientists, R Deitz in
1961 and Harry Hess in 1962 separately
published similar hypotheses based on
mantle convection currents, and
continental drift became universally
accepted.
Deitz and Hess between them
modified Holmes’ original theory of



convection and came eventually to their
own mechanism for continental drift,
which is based on what they termed
‘seafloor spreading’. This spreading, it is
suggested, begins in the mid-oceanic
ridges. These are huge mountain ranges
in the middle of the Earth’s largest
oceans. So large are the mid-oceanic
ridges that they are higher than the
Himalayas and are more than 2,000
kilometres wide. Associated with the
ridges are great trenches that bisect the
length of the ridges and which can be as
deep as 2,000 metres. The greatest heat



flow from the ocean floor takes place
near the summit of the mid-oceanic
ridges. There are also far more
earthquakes on and around the ridges
than are experienced elsewhere, showing
these to be geologically active areas.
An increase in understanding of
the Earth’s magnetic field led to the
realization that periodically this reverses.
Such fluctuations can be detected with a
device called a magnetometer. It was
discovered that, either side of the mid
oceanic ridges, it was possible to detect



these past reversals in the Earth’s
magnetic field. The conclusion was that
new material was constantly being
thrown up on the ridges and was being
pushed outwards on either side. The
reversals of the magnetic field
demonstrated that this process was
ancient but that it was still taking place.
Also of interest were ‘deep-Sea
trenches’. The trenches are generally
long and narrow and they are often
associated with, and parallel to,
continental mountain ranges. In



addition they run parallel to the ocean
margins. There is great seismic activity
associated with the deep-sea trenches,
indicating that they too are associated
with the process of seafloor spreading
and that they are directly related to the
oceanic-ridges.
What is now thought to be
happening is as follows: underneath the
Earth’s outer crust is the asthenosphere.
This is a malleable layer of heated rock.
It is kept hot because of radioactive
decay in elements such as uranium.



The source for the radioactivity, which
also includes thorium and potassium,
lies deep within the planet. The
asthenosphere, constantly heated, rises
to the surface, pushing new material out
at the mid-oceanic ridges. Magma
escapes along the cracks formed at the
ridges, forcing the new seafloor in
different directions. The new material
spreads outwards until it makes contact
with a continental plate and will then be
‘subducted’ beneath the continent. The
lithosphere at this point sinks back into
the asthenosphere, where it once again



becomes heated.
Few experts disagree with this basic
explanation, partly because it can be
seen at work. India, for example, started
its life on a completely different part of
the planet. It is now being forced up
into the body of Asia and the
Himalayas are the result – a huge
mountain range forced up by the
pressure of the two landmasses meeting.
The whole process is known as
plate tectonics and scientists were keen
to see whether or not a similar process



was taking place on the other terrestrial
type planets in our solar system
Mercury, Venus and Mars. Probes sent
to these planets have now shown
conclusively that plate tectonics do not
take place on any of our companion
worlds, making it a strictly Earth-bound
phenomenon, at least as far as our own
solar system is concerned.
This is something of a puzzle.
What is taking place in the Earth system
that is so different from the other Earth
like planets? What caused plate



tectonics to commence in the first place
and what is the engine that keeps
driving the process? There is a growing
body of evidence to show that in both
cases the answer is almost certainly the
Moon. What is more, it is now being
suggested that without plate tectonics
the Earth may not have proved to be a
suitable haven for life at all.
Dr Nick Hoffman, a geophysicist
at the Department of Earth Sciences,
Melbourne University, Australia, has
recently suggested that the Moon made



plate tectonics happen simply by
coming into existence.
As we have discussed, the origin of
the Moon is still shrouded in mystery,
no matter how much proponents of
any specific theory of its origin may
pretend. However, there are certain facts
that are known for sure. As we have
seen, the Moon is definitely made of the
same stuff as the Earth, but not all of
the Earth. Rather the composition of
the Moon closely resembles the material
in the Earth’s crust, without many of



the heavier components, such as iron,
that make up the Earth’s core.
But how could such a large
amount of the Earth leap from the
planet’s surface into a position tens of
thousands of miles in space?
Scientists were puzzled. And then a
potential explanation was put forward
in the form of the original Big Whack
theory – the suggestion that maybe
some object, about the size of Mars,
collided with the young Earth and that
the Moon was formed from surface



material that was blasted off the face of
the infant Earth. There did not seem to
be any other possibility, so it is now
regularly taught as though it is a fact.
The major problem of the Earth’s
current speed of rotation was tentatively
explained away by proposing a second
impact from the opposite direction
occurring quite soon after the first.
To us this sounds like a rather
desperate scenario to believe in. And as
we have seen, other problems remain
for this would-be explanation; not least



the question of where the material from
the incoming objects went to. If the
Double Whack theory as correct, the
Moon should be made up of three
different sets of material, but it is not. It
is made of Earth rock alone.
Nick Hoffman, as an acclaimed
expert on the terrestrial planets within
our solar system, has suggested that the
removal of the material that went to
make the Moon may have triggered
plate tectonics by creating the space for
the planet’s skin to shift. He points out



that on Venus, for example, the same
sort of forces are at work but the crust of
the planet is so thick, the stresses within
the crust simply cancel each other out,
with the exception of a few wrinkles here
and there. Hoffman has noted that if
the seventy per cent of Earth crust that
was destined to become the Moon was
returned to the Earth, it would ‘fill the
ocean basins with wall-to-wall
continent’.
What would the Earth be like
without plate tectonics?



Hoffman suggests it would be a
water world, covered with oceans and
with only the tips of extremely high
mountain ranges poking out above the
surface of the water. Of course there is
nothing to suggest that life could not
have existed on such a planet and
Hoffman agrees that life is most likely
to develop in a watery environment. It’s
a fact, though, that what we term as
being ‘intelligent life’, such as our own
species, has developed on land. The use
of fire would not be possible in a watery
habitat and the use of tools, one of the



factors that is generally accepted as the
starting point of our advance, is also a
dry land phenomenon.
In any case, as we will see, the
Moon is so important in other ways
that even a watery world may have
proved to be impossible without its
existence.



Nick Hoffman’s suggestion that the
creation of the Moon removed so much
material from the surface of the Earth
that plate tectonics could become a
reality is fascinating. It is estimated that
seventy per cent of the primordial crust



of the Earth would be necessary in order
to create the Moon. Its removal caused
the remainder of the crust to spread,
allowing continental drift to take place.
Whether or not this is the whole
story, plate tectonics are a reality as far
as the Earth is concerned and what is
more, it is a phenomenon that only
occurs on the Earth. In other words, no
other terrestrial- type body in the solar
system had continents travelling about
its surface.
One of the three Earth-like planets



in the solar system, apart from the
Earth itself, is Mars, which is half the
size and a tenth the mass of our planet.
It has an atmosphere that is ninety-five
per cent carbon dioxide and nearly five
per cent nitrogen with a pressure at the
surface that is only 1/200th that of
Earth. Unfortunately for any potential
Martian life form, liquid water cannot
exist at the ambient pressure and at the
temperature of the Martian surface. On
this planet, water goes directly between
solid and vapour phases without
becoming liquid at all.



The puzzle as to why plate
tectonics have either never started or else
never been maintained on Mars has not
been totally explained, but there are
theories.
Mars has no appreciable mountain
ranges, though it does have giant
volcanoes. Some geologists suggest that
the absence of true mountain ranges
gives one clue as to why Mars did not
develop plate tectonics. Like Earth,
Mars has a lithosphere. This is a region
in the crust of the planet that is cooler



than its interior – a little like the skin
that forms on a cup of hot milk. The
centre of the Earth is extremely hot,
probably more so than that of Mars,
but the presence of volcanoes on Mars
must indicate a hot core. One difference
might be that Mars has nowhere near as
much water in its composition as Earth.
It is thought that it is water trapped
within the Earth which acts as a
lubricant allowing different parts of its
rocky surface to slide against each other.
The limited amount of water on Mars
seems to prevent the lithosphere from



allowing fresh material from deep
within the planet to rise to the surface in
the way it is constantly doing on Earth.
As a result the lithosphere has not been
disturbed for aeons and has cooled
gradually, getting thicker and thicker.
When pressure has become so great
within the body of Mars that it is
powerful enough to escape, it has done
so via volcanism and not along features
like the mid-oceanic ridges on Earth.
The other Earth-like body, Venus,
which orbits closer to the Sun than our



own planet, has a surface very different
to that of Mars or the Earth. In some
ways Venus is more like Earth than
Mars. Venus is a similar size and mass
and is also compositionally quite like
Earth – or at least it was once. Experts
such as David Grinspoon, a research
scientist at Southwest Research Institute
in Boulder, Colorado, have studied
Venus closely, aided by a whole series of
orbital and lander space missions.
Grinspoon is not alone in believing
that in its early stages of development



Venus was even more like the Earth.
There is no discernable water on Venus
now but there are traces in the
atmosphere, which most likely indicates
that in its very early stages it had
proportionally as much water as Earth.
This is not too surprising because the
planets formed at the same time and
fairly close together.
Venus is not unlike Mars in many
ways but its surface pressure is ninety
two times that of Earth. It is thought
that Venus lost its water because of a



greenhouse effect and it is now covered
in dense swirling clouds of sulphuric
acid. These clouds are so thick that only
a small percentage of the sunlight that
falls on Venus actually gets through to
the planet’s surface, so even if it weren’t
such a hell in other ways, it would be a
very gloomy world. It might be thought
that less sunlight would lead to a lower
temperature but this isn’t the case.
Rather, heat already at or near the
surface is maintained and increased
because it cannot escape through the
dense carbon dioxide. This has caused a



dramatic heating of the surface of
Venus to a present temperature of
730°C.
Like Mars and Earth, Venus has
volcanoes; in fact it has more than any
other planet in the solar system. But
again, like Mars, the volcanoes of Venus
exist as individual entities and not as
part of long mountain ranges as is the
case on Earth. The volcanoes of Venus
are randomly spread about its surface
and many of them look very recent,
even though this may not be the case.



Electrical storms rage constantly
through the clouds of sulphuric acid
but, even so, wind erosion on Venus is
limited compared to the water-rich
Earth. It turns out that erosion is
extremely important in terms of
supplying the right chemical and
nutrient balances that have made the
Earth a haven for life.
The surface of Venus looks broadly
similar wherever one looks and is
thought to be comparatively recent in
origin – something in the order of 600



to 700 million years. Venus has a
generally smooth surface with some rifts
and folds but everything appears to be
the same age. It is generally accepted
that between 600 and 700 million years
ago some cataclysm took place on
Venus that remodelled its whole
surface. Whether this was as a result of
the internal stresses within the planet is
not known, but for some reason the
planet’s surface appears to have literally
melted or more likely was uniformly
covered with volcanic basalt.



Nobody knows for certain whether
a similar thing will happen again on
Venus, in other words whether we are
seeing only one phase of a stop-start
process that is taking place, but it is
considered to be a distinct possibility.
Probably because of its greenhouse
atmosphere Venus is deficient in water
and so once again may have built up a
thick lithosphere. It certainly does not
display any of the characteristics of plate
tectonics.
It is interesting to note that Venus



has no moons, whilst Mars has two,
though both of these are extremely
small and can have little or no effect on
their host planet. As we have seen, it is
now being suggested that the very
creation of such a large moon as that
enjoyed by Earth was directly
responsible for the start of plate
tectonics, which in turn allowed life to
form on the planet in the first place.
In the early stages of its existence,
the Moon was very much closer to the
Earth than it is today. And it is the



existence of the Earth’s oceans that is
primarily responsible for the gradual
lengthening of the distance between the
Earth and the Moon. This is a process
that has been taking place for the last
four billion years and which is still
taking place.
One way of looking at the situation
was presented by Neil F Comins,
Professor of Astronomy at the
University of Maine. Back in 1990 he
had been struck by the comments of a
colleague, to the effect that science



educators are always looking at the
world from the same old perspective.
Comins suggested that it might be
sensible to step aside and look at the
world differently.
As a result of this conversation
Comins decided to turn his attention to
something we all take for granted,
namely the Earth and its relationship to
the Moon – but from an entirely
different perspective. He set out to
consider what the Earth would have
been like today if it had not enjoyed the



benefits of so large a Moon. He called
his hypothetical world ‘Solon’ and over
a period of time he wrote a series of
articles about Solon that appeared in
Astronomy magazine. He eventually
published his overall observations in a
book, which was entitled Voyages to
Earth that Might Have Been.21
Comins examined every aspect of
the Earth and its relationship with the
Moon to build a picture of a similar
planet, at the same distance from the
Sun and which was the same age as



Earth. The only thing that was different
is that the Moon did not exist, but the
alterations this absence would make to
the Earth were dramatic.
Nick Hoffman suggests that the
very nature of the Earth’s surface would
have been entirely different if the
material that makes up the Moon had
not been removed from the Earth’s
crust. However, Comins’ starting point
is to assume that the surface details of
the Earth would be roughly the same as
they are now.



One of the greatest differences in
terms of the early, developing Earth
would have been tides. Comins makes
the point that a Moon ten times as close
would have led to daily lunar tides that
would have been a thousand times
greater than they are today. Bearing in
mind that it is generally accepted that
the infant Earth was spinning about its
centre every six hours, this means that
tsunami-strength tides would have been
hurtling across the Earth every three
hours! Not only were these tides more
frequent, but, being so very much



larger, they would have crashed many
hundreds of kilometres inland – and
with tremendous destructive force.
The mechanism that has slowed
the Earth’s spin is directly related to
tides and the Moon is not the only body
responsible for them because part of the
ocean tides on the Earth are responsive
to the Sun. But the Moon is much
closer and has done far more to slow
the Earth than has the more distant
Sun. Comins estimates that without the
Moon, the Earth day would be only



eight hours in length and solar
generated tides alone would be less than
a third of what they are today.
The immediate implication has
great ramifications on the possibility of
evolving life. At present many scientists
accept that DNA, the fundamental
building block of all life, occurred
spontaneously in Earth’s early oceans.
We will have much more to say about
DNA later, but for the moment we will
accept the general view that it first
appeared in the early oceans of the



Earth, a legacy of what is known as the
‘primeval soup – a specific blend of
water and chemicals upon which life
depends.
The massive tides created by the
infant Moon would have caused erosion
on a scale quite beyond our experience
today. Millions upon millions of tonnes
of land would have been pulverized and
swept out to sea, then widely distributed
and eventually settled on the seabed.
This process liberated vast amounts of
minerals into the oceans – minerals that



emerging life simply could not do
without. Presumably a Moonless world
would still have had weather patterns,
including rain, so erosion would have
taken place but on a tiny scale
compared with what happened when
the Moon was so much closer to the
Earth. This means that life would have
taken much longer to gain a foothold, if
it had managed to do so at all.
We have no problem with the
concept that life first developed and
flourished in the ocean, but there had to



be a time at which it migrated from its
salty environs and learned to survive on
dry land. It is possible that insect life
took the leap first but the fish ancestors
of amphibians and reptiles followed
and between them they eventually gave
way to all land-living animals in the
world today.
Life is always evolving to
harmonize with the prevailing
environment and to capitalize on new
niches that are not already being
exploited. Around 400 million years ago



one such area of potential exploitation
was rock-pools. Fish are accidentally left
behind in rock pools with every
retreating tide, both then and now. In
most cases it doesn’t matter because the
next high tide will free the fish again,
back into the sea. However, if a fish is
isolated in a rock pool during a
particularly high tide, it may have to
survive for weeks before it will be
liberated. Fish that found themselves in
this situation would die unless they
somehow managed to get back to the
ocean by moving over dry land and also



managing to breathe out of the water.
It seems that some fish did find
ways to drag themselves across the sand,
at the same time changing enough
physically to take gulps of air whilst out
of the water. These fish found that dry
land offered some rich pickings and any
animal that learned to live, even
temporarily, on dry land, would be well
rewarded. Gradually, and over a long
period of time, fins that pushed the fish
over sand became stouter until they
became legs and the fish in question



ceased to be fish at all.
Since the Sun also creates tides it
isn’t out of the question that fish would
ultimately have left the oceans, even if
lunar tides had not been present.
However, the waves in question would
have been significantly smaller and their
value in terms of depositing detritus
much more limited. What is quite clear
is that life would also have been very
much slower in developing to a stage
advanced enough to leave the oceans
had it not been for the lunar tides, if it



could ever have happened at all. When
we take on board the prospect of an
Earth with a variable obliquity, no plate
tectonics and such a dizzying spin about
its axis, the prognosis for life of any sort
on Comins’ Solon is not good.
Fortunately for us the Moon was
present and stamped its authority on
the developing Earth in a number of
different but equally crucial ways. It
helped to create many differing
habitats, which in turn engendered
biodiversity. Most experts believe that it



was biodiversity that led to intelligent
life becoming possible. Evolution tries
and retries many different models.
Animals that were ideally suited to their
environment flourished on the Earth,
only to fall by the wayside when
conditions changed and they could not
adapt.
Giant reptiles, that we generically
call ‘dinosaurs’, ruled the Earth for
millions of years until these impressive
and diverse creatures vanished from the
face of the planet. Whether as a result of



some cataclysm, such as a huge
meteorite strike, or thanks to some
other misfortune, species that had
flourished for eons were wiped out
astonishingly quickly, but life itself
remained untouched. Such was the
multiplicity of species already
inhabiting the Earth that some were
bound to overcome the problems that
put paid to thousands of others at a
stroke.
One of the animals that did
survive whatever circumstances put



paid to the dinosaurs was a tiny shrew
like creature that occupied the vacant
niche left by the demise of the reptiles.
However, it was different to the reptiles
because it gave birth to live young and
suckled its infants with milk created
from its own body. These first
mammals then evolved to diversify and
spread across the planet where they
have been adaptable enough to survive
and flourish.
Tree-dwelling species became
monkeys and some of these creatures



came down from the trees and began to
move across the open savannah, most
likely created by yet more climatic
changes. Down on the ground these
anthropoids were vulnerable. If they
were going to survive they were going to
need something that had not been
specifically necessary to earlier creatures.
They needed bigger brains.
Evolution responded and a whole
family of hominids was the result, of
which Homo sapiens is now the only
surviving example. But despite our



general sense of specialness, recent
events point to our solus position as
being surprisingly recent.
One of the greatest breakthroughs
for humans was the control of fire; but
the earliest known evidence of regular
fire using is unequivocally attributed to
our larger-brained cousins, the
Neanderthals, some 200,000 years ago.
We coexisted with these people until
they finally disappeared in southern
Europe around 25,000 years ago.
Science had believed that an earlier



hom inid, Homo erectus, had become
extinct hundreds of thousands of years
ago, until the mid-1990s when remains
found on the island of Java in Indonesia
were found to indicate that they too
were around until 25,000 years ago.
Both these alternative humans
disappeared at a time when
midsummer’s day fell around June 21st
in the northern hemisphere – just as it
does today. The dates on which
astronomical events such as the
summer and winter solstices and the



spring and autumn equinoxes fall,
move backwards through the calendar
by one day (around one Megalithic
degree) every seventy-one years. This is
due to the long, slow wobble of the
Earth on its axis, known as ‘the
precession of the equinoxes’ which takes
25,920 years for each cycle.
This movement through the
calendar has no effect on people at all,
but it is interesting to note that a recent
discovery suggests we were not alone as
a species as recently as 13,000 years ago,



when the summer solstice in the
northern hemisphere fell in late
December; the exact opposite of where it
is right now.
The discovery of what is claimed to
be a previously unknown branch of
hominid occurred on the island of
Flores, near Java, and was announced to
the world in 2004. Remains have been
found of a dwarf hominid, named
Homo floresiensis, which was only as tall
as a modern three-year-old with a facial
morphology very different to Homo



sapiens. Strangely, these miniature
people had mini-brains yet they
produced relatively sophisticated tools.
Not only have we recently shared the
planet with other hominids, it now
seems that the ancestors of today’s
Europeans may have interbred with
other types of human in the not too
distant past.
As part of a large-scale gene
mapping programme, researchers at
deCODE Genetics in Reykjavik, Iceland,
were looking at the families of nearly



30,000 Icelanders. They found that
women who had an inversion on
chromosome 17 had, on average, 3.5
per cent more children than women
who did not. Kari Stefansson,
deCODE’s chief executive, considered
this to be a very significant impact in
terms of an evolutionary timescale. It is
possible to roughly date the origin of
this phenomenon by counting the
number of genetic differences that have
accumulated in it compared to a
normal DNA sequence. It turns out that
this element has so many differences



that it must have occurred about three
million years ago. Which is long before
modern humans evolved.
Stefansson has suggested that this
element of the DNA might have been
native to some other species of early
human and came to our own species
around 50,000 years ago. He added:
‘There aren’t all that many ways you
can explain it except by the
reintroduction into the modern human
population... That raises the possibility
it was reintroduced by cross-breeding



with earlier species.’22
But as these other humans
disappeared, Homo sapiens developed a
growing intelligence that allowed us to
begin to manipulate the environment in
which we live. The great breakthrough
was the development of agriculture – a
move that allowed civilization to
em erge.
With civilization came the ability
to count and ultimately a way of
expressing language in a written form.
Knowledge that had once been



laboriously passed from one generation
to the next could now be stored and
retrieved from places outside the
human brain. Intelligence also created
technology and a great desire to
understand the workings of the world
and the cosmos of which it was part.
But this curiosity began long before we
sent representatives of our species to
walk on the Moon. It had been present
for more than 30,000 years, when the
first lunar calendars were created. It is
almost certain that after the Sun, the
Moon was the most important heavenly



body to captivate our species.
How little those cave dwellers, who
scratched their knowledge of the lunar
cycle onto animal bones and antlers,
were aware that without the presence of
the lunar disc that so captivated them,
the Earth would probably be a lifeless
rock, silently spinning around the Sun,
like the inferno of Venus and the frozen
wastes of Mars.



‘Rather than transmitting radio
messages, extraterrestrial
civilizations would find it far
more efficient to send us a
“message in a bottle”, some
kind of physical message



inscribed on matter. And it
could be waiting for us in our
own backyard.’
Professor Christopher Rose of Rutgers
University, New Jersey & Gregory Wright, a
physicist with Antiope Associates, New
Jersey
The idea that intelligent life forms
might exist elsewhere in the cosmos is a
comparatively recent interest for
humanity. For thousands of years and
across countless cultures, it was more or
less accepted that anything dwelling



outside our own immediate
environment inevitably fell into the
classification of a god or a servant of the
gods, such as the saints, angels or
seraphim that inhabit the heaven of the
Judeo-Christian tradition.
Even after the telescope appeared,
around the year 1600, the Catholic
Church in particular was not keen to
have its dogmas regarding the nature of
the Earth and its relationship with space
tampered with in any way. In Christian
doctrine, the Sun and the Moon have



both been directly created by God, as
have the stars and planets. The first
book of the Bible, Genesis, lay down the
order in which God created the
observable cosmos and anyone who
seemed to be throwing a spanner in the
works, for example Galileo (1564–1642)
who suggested that the Sun, and not the
Earth, was the centre of the solar
system, was liable to be severely
censured. Galileo was forced to recant
his heretical views and was condemned
to perpetual house arrest but was
probably lucky to escape with his life.



Even before Galileo’s time,
thinking people were not fooled by the
Church’s account of the solar system.
The Portuguese navigator Ferdinand
Magellan (1480–1521) understood
what he was seeing at the time of a
lunar eclipse: ‘The church says the earth
is flat, but I know it is round for I have
seen its shadow on the moon and I have
more faith in a shadow than the
church.’
Only the effects of the Renaissance
and Church reformations across Europe



broke the hold of old church dogma. By
the late seventeenth century, with
telescopes proliferating and almost
anyone able to take a close-up view of
the Sun, Moon, planets and stars, the
cat was truly out of the bag and the
genuine nature of the solar system in
particular was beginning to become
apparent.
Since Charles Darwin wrote The
Origin of Species in the mid-nineteenth
century it has become clear that life on
Earth has evolved over billions of years



from the first single-cell entities through
to all of the creatures in the world
today. Darwin’s ideas were argued over
fiercely at the time, but the massing
evidence from palaeontology, genetics,
zoology, molecular biology and many
other fields gradually established
evolution’s truth beyond reasonable
doubt.
It is ironic, therefore, that the most
scientifically advanced nation the world
has ever known, the United States, has
large numbers of ‘Creationists’ – people



who still cling to the teachings of the
mediaeval Church. They are currently
trying to persuade politicians, judges
and the general public that evolution is
an unproven myth cobbled together by
atheists. They lobby for their ideas, such
as ‘intelligent design’, to be taught as
alternatives to evolution in science
classrooms. Their proponents admit
that their aim is to keep the scriptures
of the Christian religion taught in
school as the word of God, rather than a
collection of ancient Jewish texts.



Their arguments against Darwin’s
concept of ‘natural selection’ are not
well reasoned or based on any normal
principle of modern science. These
people appear to be intellectually stuck,
hundreds of years in the past, at a time
before masses of new data became
available. However, it is interesting to
note that academics once thought like
this too. Dr John Lightfoot, the Vice
chancellor of the University of
Cambridge was not frightened of being
precise about the origin of the entire
Universe when he said in 1642:



‘Heaven and earth,
centre and
circumference, were
created together, in
the same instant,
and clouds of
water... This work
took place and man
was created... on the
17th of September
3928 BC at nine
o’clock in the
m orning.’



Poor Dr Lightfoot seems to have been
ignorant of even the most basic facts of
science. He clearly did not realize that
there is no such thing as nine o’clock in
the morning because every hour of the
day exists simultaneously on our
revolving planet; it just depends where
you are standing. Happily, the very year
that Lightfoot made this statement, a
baby boy was born in the village of
Woolsthorpe in Leicestershire. The
infant’s name was Isaac Newton and he
went on to become Cambridge
University’s most famous professor and



a man that would create a leap forward
in humankind’s understanding of the
Universe.
Newton however, did not dismiss
the role of God as he wrote on Judaeo
Christian prophecy, the decipherment
of which he saw as being essential to the
understanding of God. His book on the
subject espoused his view that
Christianity had gone astray in 325 AD,
when the crumbling Roman Empire
declared that Jesus Christ was not a
man but an aspect of the very deity that



had built the Universe.
Today we have the benefit of
masses of data from all kinds of
disciplines that point to the Earth being
nearly five billion years old, but many
creationists frequently quote the
chronology produced by James Ussher
who was Archbishop of Armagh and
Primate of All Ireland in the early
seventeenth century. His analysis, based
on his interpretation of the King James
Bible, allowed him to confidently
declare that the creation of the world



occurred in 4004 BC.
Such a dating raises all kinds of
problems, from fitting in the obvious
existence of dinosaurs, for example, to
the fact that the city of Jericho, near to
the River Jordan, has been continuously
occupied for 10,000 years.
(Interestingly, the origin of the name
‘Jericho’ is Canaanite and means ‘the
Moon’).
There are creationist websites that
put forward ‘evidence’ that their writers
believe demonstrates that people and



dinosaurs lived at the same time
presumably around the time that the
Megalithic Yard was being introduced!
But these are not fringe ideas as there
are large numbers of people who believe
that geological time is a myth.
According to a survey run by the Gallup
Organization in 1999, the majority of
Americans educated up to high school
level or less, believe that God created
humans in their present form within
the past 10,000 years or so. And a
worrying forty-four per cent of college
graduates believe the same.



An international research team led
by scientists at the University of British
Columbia sees the creation as being a
little earlier than Dr Lightfoot and
Archbishop Ussher. Professor Harvey
Richer, the study’s principal
investigator, confirmed previous
research that sets the age of the Universe
at thirteen to fourteen billion years. The
team measured the brightness and
temperatures of white dwarf stars (the
burned-out remnants of the earliest
stars which formed in our galaxy)
because they are ‘cosmic clocks’ that get



fainter as they cool in a very predictable
way.
More recent calculations, by
Lawrence Krauss of Case Western
Reserve University and Brian Chaboyer
at Dartmouth College, published in the
journal Science, put the Universe at
anything up to twenty billion years old.
Creationists often try to invalidate
all of evolution by pointing to science’s
current inability to explain the origin of
life. John Rennie, the editor in chief of
Scientific American has countered this by



saying:
‘...even if life on
Earth turned out to
have a non
evolutionary origin
(for instance, if
alien’s introduced
the first cells billions
of years ago),
evolution since then
would be robustly
confirmed by
countless micro



evolutionary and
m acro-evolutionary
studies.’23
It is true that, whilst science can explain
how life has evolved on Earth, the way it
all began is a complete mystery. And, as
far as we know, the Earth is the only
location where life exists.
In the nineteenth century some
people speculated that there might be
life, or even people, living on the Moon.
It is now certain that no natural life
could exist on the Moon, which is a



barren world constantly irradiated by
the Sun and lacking in both available
surface water and a sufficiently dense
atmosphere to support life. There was a
more recent time when Venus, the
second planet out from the Sun,
seemed a potential candidate for some
type of life because its dense clouds hid
the surface from view so that, for all we
knew, it might be as green and verdant
as that of the Earth. But as we now
know, it is furnace hot and continually
subjected to sulphuric acid rain. As a
result, the chances for life seem almost



nonexistent.
Mars is certainly cooler and there
may be water existing near its polar
regions. At the time of writing this
book, some people are still clinging to
the possibility that there could be some
sort of primitive life on Mars either
now, or at some time in its remote past.
If it does exist at all, life on Mars is likely
to be extremely simple. Other planets in
the solar system, being gaseous giants in
the main, are even less likely to support
any sort of life as we know it.



By far the majority of experts now
accept that if advanced life of any sort
does exist in places other than the Earth,
we will almost certainly have to look
deep into interstellar space to find it.
Our solar system is only one of many
that undoubtedly exist, even in our own
corner of space. Astronomers have
identified suns that have planets
orbiting them and it is estimated there
are a thousand million stars in our own
galaxy, any one of which could possess a
planetary system where life might have
evolved and flourished. Beyond our



galaxy there are countless others, so it
may be wrong to think that only our
tiny little blue planet, amidst such a
proliferation of planet-bearing suns, has
produced a thinking species such as our
own.
But as far as we know right now,
we are alone.
Once the sheer size of space was
ascertained it also became apparent that
even if there are hundreds or thousands
of intelligent species out there, the
chances of us actually encountering



them in any way is quite small.
Distance is a problem but it isn’t the
only one. One of the greatest stumbling
blocks could be time itself. In order for
us to communicate with another
advanced species, it would have to have
reached at least our level of
sophistication either at the same time as
us or shortly before. Although
humanity has created at least a couple
of probes that are presently leaving the
environs of our own solar system, it will
be decades, or maybe centuries, before
we embark on interstellar space travel to



any significant extent. Even if we do, the
answers we are looking for, in terms of
finding other intelligent beings, are
likely to be protracted.
The thought of any spacecraft
travelling faster than the speed of light
remains in the realms of science fiction.
If, as Einstein proposed, light speed is as
fast as anything can ever travel, it would
take many years merely to reach the
nearest star. To go beyond our own
galaxy, the Milky Way, would seem
impossible because the next nearest



place we could visit is the Sagittarius
Dwarf galaxy which has ‘only’ a few
million stars and is a staggering 80,000
light years away. The next nearest galaxy
is the Large Magellanic Cloud and that
is 170,000 light years distant.
Setting out to actually meet our
intergalactic or extragalactic cousins
seems to be a hopeless idea, even if we
knew where they were located. So does
this mean we can never say hello to any
of them? Not necessarily. If we cannot
greet them face-to-face, it might be



possible to listen to them.
Much of the energy so created
streams out into space as
electromagnetic radiation. There are
many wavelengths of this radiation,
some of which are familiar to us in our
daily lives. The full panoply of this
radiation is known as the
‘electromagnetic spectrum’. The
shortest of the wavelengths are those we
call ‘gamma waves’. At the other end of
the electromagnetic spectrum are
extremely long radio waves, which we



harness every day. Visible light is also a
component of the electromagnetic
spectrum, as are the microwaves used
daily in many cookers.
In fact we are getting radio
messages from all parts of the cosmos
all the time. These are emitted by suns
and other much stranger bodies within
our own galaxy and beyond it, as a
result of the physical processes taking
place within them. Electromagnetic
radiation travels across the near vacuum
of space at the speed of light. Once it



was realized that we could listen in on
the processes taking place in our stellar
backyard and beyond, radio astronomy
was born.
In 1931 an American engineer by
the name of Karl Jansky, who was
working for the Bell Telephone
Laboratories, was conducting
experiments into interference that was
taking place across certain radio
wavelengths. He built a succession of
aerials and managed to isolate three
distinct sources of radio interference or



static. Firstly he could detect local
thunderstorms; and secondly, storms
taking place at a greater distance.
However, there was a third source of
interference that was steady and always
present which he couldn’t, at first,
identify. By moving his aerials, Jansky
was eventually able to isolate the source
of this third form of radio interference.
To his own and many other people’s
great surprise it was coming from
within the Milky Way and in fact it
originated at the very centre of our own
galaxy.



Like many controversial discoveries
Jansky’s were ignored for some years.
But not everyone was sceptical. Reading
about Jansky’s observations, in 1937
another radio engineer, Grote Reber,
built his own aerial, though this one
would have been more familiar to a
modern radio astronomer because it
was a dish. Reber also picked up the
strange ‘messages’ from space.
Interest in the signals from space
gradually increased. In 1942 a British
Army officer, J S Hay, made the first



observations of radio emissions from
our own Sun, whilst working on ways to
jam German radio signals. Once the
Second World War was over, radio
astronomy really took off and within a
few years discrete signals from all parts
of space were being received. Ultimately
a background radio source was
recognized that could not be isolated to
a particular point in space and it was
finally realized, in the 1960s, that this
was the signal left by the Big Bang – the
very birth of the Universe itself.



Of course, all the signals that were
being received were perfectly natural in
origin. But towards the end of the 1950s
it began to occur to a number of those
involved in radio astronomy that if any
species out there in space was already
more advanced than we were, it might
well make use of radio waves in order to
let us know it existed. Most radio signals
received from space can be readily
identified and even those that proved to
be a puzzle at first have been shown to
have a natural origin. But if an
advanced species actively wanted to



send a message, it would not be difficult
for it to use a type of radio signal that
could not be confused with that created
by any natural phenomena – for
example, one containing an obvious
mathematical formula.
In 1961, when the ‘race for space’
had fired the imagination of a
generation, a new organization came
into existence. It was called SETI – ‘the
Search for ExtraTerrestrial Intelligence’.
SETI was primarily the brainchild of an
enthusiastic young electrical engineer



turned radio astronomer by the name
of Frank Drake, a 31-year-old engineer
who had become interested in radio
astronomy whilst at Harvard Graduate
School.
Drake was fascinated by the
prospect of radio astronomy being used
to identify other intelligent species in the
cosmos and thought that we should be
actively listening in for any message that
might be transmitted from deep space.
Together with another interested
scientist, J Peter Pearman, an officer on



the Space Board of the National
Academy of Sciences, Drake arranged
the first SETI conference.
Anxious to show the world just
how likely extraterrestrial life surely was,
Drake came up with what is now
known as the ‘Drake Equation’. This
reached the conclusion that there must
be many thousands of intergalactic
civilizations capable of creating and
sending radio messages across space.
The idea of SETI was immediately
popular with the public and for a while



NASA had some involvement. During
the 1960s and ’70s, NASA’s
contribution was fairly low-key, but in
1992 nasa initiated a much more
formal SETI programme.
Unfortunately, less than a year later, the
United States Congress cancelled the
funding and NASA, reluctantly, pulled
out of the SETI research programme.
This certainly wasn’t the end of the
story because a proportion of the
intended NASA research was taken over
by the non-profit-making SETI
Institute and by an associated body, the



SETI League.
SETI has now enlisted the help
and support of people from around the
globe. Many computer users are
regularly sent packages of information
received by SETI, in order that it can be
analyzed during computer down time.
Millions of individuals are involved in
what is known as the SETI@home
project at the present time.
Exactly where in the
electromagnetic spectrum we should be
listening for deliberately created



messages from the stars was decided in
1959. Phillip Morrison and Giuseppe
Cocconi, two young physicists at
Cornell University in the United States
had co-operated to submit an article to
the prestigious science journal, Nature,
which appeared in September 1959. It
was entitled ‘Searching for Interstellar
Communications’. When trying to
ascertain which part of the
electromagnetic spectrum to monitor
for alien signals, Morrison and Cocconi
ultimately opted for a frequency of
1420MHz. Not only does this frequency



fall in a very ‘quiet’ part of the available
spectrum, it also represents the
emission frequency of the most
common element in the Universe,
which is hydrogen. Morrison and
Cocconi believed that any intelligent
species would realize these two facts and
so would therefore be most likely to
transmit a greeting at or around this
frequency.
Some promising messages have
been received across the last three
decades but, in the end, all of them



turned out to be natural phenomena.
Space can supply some surprisingly
‘ordered’ signals. Rapidly spinning
objects in space known as ‘pulsars’ are a
good case in question, so SETI experts
are extremely careful and also deeply
sceptical when any apparent ‘letter from
the stars’ is announced.
One of the greatest problems for
SETI, or indeed anyone trying to pick
up a message from space, is knowing
exactly what to expect. It is certain that
any species sending such a message will



be in advance of us technologically
because if the message received comes
from deep space it must have taken
thousands or even millions of years to
reach us. The culture that sent it might,
by the time it is received, have
disappeared, advanced even further or
simply become bored with the whole
notion. All we can do is to take an
educated guess and suppose that for
any species there will be commonality
in terms of the irrefutable laws of
physics.



We may receive a logically
repeating mathematical sequence such
as pi or a list of prime numbers, it is
simply impossible to know. There are
sceptics around who suggest that the
whole process of looking for such a
message is destined to fail, if only
because other intelligent species out in
space may be so different to us that
there would be no points of contact
recognizable on both sides. In other
words, they may be trying to contact us
right now and we simply cannot
understand the message.



By the summer of 2004 we were already
beginning to reach our own conclusions
about how an intelligent species from
elsewhere might have already contacted
us – humanity simply had not
recognized the fact yet. Serendipity
being what it is, an article appeared in
the August 2004 edition of New
Scientist. It was written by Paul Davies, a
scientist at The Australian Centre for
Astrobiology at Macquarie University,
Sydney. We found it pleasing that a
respected scientist was publicly
discussing the idea that an alien culture



may have put a message intended for us
in place many millions of years ago: a
message, that Professor Davies also
likens to the plot of the film 2001: A
Space Odyssey.
Whilst congratulating SETI for its
efforts to track down incoming
messages from space, Paul Davies
makes the suggestion that to try and
contact humanity by way of radio
signals might prove to be fairly
unreliable for any alien species far away.
He points out that the problem of



‘timing’ might make radio contact
difficult, if not impossible. No matter
how many such intelligent societies
there might be, the chance of them
transmitting during the short time slot
during which we have been listening is
very remote. Is it not possible, Davies
asks, whether such a culture, probably
immeasurably older than our own, may
have conceived of a much more reliable
way to let us know of its existence?
Might it not have opted for a
method of communication that was not



dependent upon transmitting signals
for many millions of years in the hope
that we, or someone like us, had just
evolved the ability to decipher messages
in the form of radio waves? Would it
not be more likely that our intergalactic
cousins would have chosen something
much more timeless?
This suggestion, when we read it
near the start of Davies’ article, made us
sit upright and pay attention because we
were already asking ourselves the same
question. Davies goes on to suggest that,



rather than radio messages, a far more
reliable way for any alien species to
contact us would be to leave artefacts in
the vicinity of planets likely to spawn
intelligent life that, given sufficient
advancement on the part of such a
developing species, it could not fail to
recognize.
Then we came across yet more
heavyweight scientists with similar,
highly logical, thought.
Professor Christopher Rose of
Rutgers University in New Jersey and



Gregory Wright, a physicist with
Antiope Associates also in New Jersey,
have stated that the transmission of a
radio signal by an extraterrestrial
civilization, that would probably have to
be detected 10,000 light years away,
does not make sense. They suggest that
it would be far more efficient to send us
some kind of physical message
inscribed on physical matter – a kind of
‘message in a bottle’. And, they believe,
such a message could already be waiting
for us in our own backyard.24



Rose observed that: ‘If energy is
what you care about, it’s tremendously
more efficient to toss a rock.’ Once
radio signals pass us by they are gone
for ever, so aliens would have to beam
signals continuously as we have only
had radio for a miniscule fraction of
our existence as an advanced species.
We had to ask ourselves, what if
that physical object was the Moon and
the information is there for us to see
once we understand the vocabulary?
If the Moon does hold a message,



it would be exactly what Paul Davies
called a ‘set and forget’ technique that
would survive for millions or even
billions of years. Any conventional sort
of physical structure, no matter how
impressive, would eventually crumble
under geological forces, especially on a
very active planet such as our own. It
turns out that the possibilities for a
‘letter from the stars’ that can survive
eons are actually very limited indeed. In
the end such a ‘physical’ message needs
to be either extremely large or extremely
small – and as we were to discover,



perhaps both.
We had already uncovered a
wealth of published academic material
that points to the Moon being the single
most important factor in the
development and nurturing of complex
life forms on the planet Earth. Quite
simply, if the Earth is thought of as an
incubator for life – the Moon is the
carefully programmed machine that
monitors and stabilizes the process. A
real life-support system.
This may be a wonderful



coincidence of epic proportions, or it
could be yet another miracle to ignore
as an inevitable consequence of the
‘Anthropic Principle’.
Whether or not the suggestion put
forward by Davies has any merit, it was
the second time in a month during
which perfectly respectable and serious
scientists had published articles dealing
honestly with the possibility that we are
not alone in the Universe and that other
species may be trying, or might have
tried in the past, to contact us. Whilst



we are delighted with the open-minded
attitude that seems to be developing
with regard to this subject it is our
profound belief that the message, for
which SETI, Paul Davies and Rose and
Wright are seeking, is right in front of
our eyes. It has been there as long as
humanity has existed and what it has to
tell us is breathtaking in its
im plications.



A Potential Message?
At this point we asked ourselves what
would a message look like that had been
planted on Earth or in its immediate
environs and which was intended to
survive for a huge period of time.
Firstly, we reasoned, it would have to be
recognizable, so it could be clearly
interpreted as a message before its
contents could be deciphered. Secondly,
it would need to be either extremely
large or else very small in order to
survive the destructive power of Earth’s



geology and weather systems.
In Clarke and Kubrick’s 2001: A
Space Odyssey, the technique used by
the unknown aliens was to have a major
anomaly that could only be detected by
a technically competent species. By
placing objects with huge mass under
the surface of the Moon the aliens knew
they would be easy to spot in a place
where there was little else to distract. But
in that story the purpose of the
gravitational anomalies was not to
communicate with the new species – it



was to send a message back to the aliens
that the local creatures had reached a
specific level of intelligence.
So, an anomaly of this sort might
be enough to alert an unknown species,
such as our own, that there is a message
waiting. The next step would be for
those planting the message to ensure
that the target species understood that it
was addressed to them.
It has long been agreed that
numbers are the best way to
communicate with intelligent creatures



from another world. Hieroglyphs or any
kind of marks are unlikely to be
understood without any point of
reference, just as there was no way to
understand ancient Egyptian
hieroglyphs until the Rosetta Stone was
discovered in 1799. This inscribed
artefact from the second century BC
gave the same text in both Greek and
hieroglyphs; thereby providing the key
to understanding a lost language.
If numbers are used in such a
message they need to have a discernable



pattern, however they are
communicated, so that they stand out
against the background ‘noise’ of
number values that surround us
everywhere. Even then, it is extremely
challenging to think of numbers that
are certain to be spotted once they are
planted in our own environment. The
safest method would be to use ratios
that stand out, because ratios are not
dependent on units of measurement or
any chosen base (e.g. base ten in
everyday usage or base two [binary] as
used in computing).



But it occurred to us that we were
examining this process backwards,
because we started out by being alerted
to major anomalies specifically related
to the Moon. Not only does it appear
very unlikely that the Moon could have
occurred naturally in thefirst place, it
also turns out that it has been the
incubation machine that so perfectly
nurtured life.
We now needed to go back to our
starting position and look at the
numbers that had fallen out of the



Earth–Moon–Sun relationship in terms
of ratios and to those measurements
that stood out so well when we applied
Megalithic units to them.
The first and most obviously
strange thing about the Moon is how it
appears to be the same size as the Sun
when viewed from Earth. It is 400 times
smaller and 400 times closer to the
Earth than the Sun. Assuming for a
moment that this might be the first part
of a calling card from an unknown
source rather than just a bizarre



coincidence, we have to note three
factors:
1. 1. It is designed
to be
m eaningful
only to
intelligent
creatures living
on the Earth’s
surface.
2. It is designed
to be noticed at
this specific



point in time,
give or take a
million years
or so each way,
because the
Moon only
behaves in the
way it does at
this time.
3. It appears to
be addressed to
a species with
ten fingers,



because the
ratio
relationship of
that between
the Moon and
the Sun is such
a round
number when
expressed in
base ten (e.g.
in base eight
the ratio would
be one to 620).



Now we will speculate that the ratio of
the Moon and the Sun just might be
pointing to a deliberately created
message. In order to do so, we must
suspend all preconceptions of what
seems sensible and consider instead
what under normal circumstances
might be judged unthinkable.
We will therefore temporarily
accept that points 1, 2 and 3 above are
valid and that someone or something is
trying to direct the attention of
Earthlings, sporting ten digits and living



during this particular point in time, to
look at the Moon as a potential
m essage.
So, here we go!



In the beginning there was
neither existence nor non
existence; there was no
atmosphere, no sky, and no
realm beyond the sky. What
power was there? Where was



that power? Who was that
power?
Rig Veda 10:129.1-7 (circa 4000 BC)
At this point we had decided that we
could not continue to gather further
facts without having some plan in place.
The way forward seemed to be to
develop a hypothesis so that we could
see how the component parts of the
puzzle may fit together. We agreed to
suspend all negative comments for a
time, so that we did not miss a point by



rejecting something that challenged our
preconceptions. Only when we had a
complete model for our hypothesis,
would we critically appraise it and
compare it to other possible
explanations.
So, we are now entering the
modelling world by temporarily
accepting the following three concepts
as real:
1. 1. The Moon was
engineered by
an unknown



agency circa
4.6 billion
years ago, to
act as an
incubator to
prom ote
intelligent life
on Earth.
2. The unknown
agency knew
that
hum anoids
would be the



result of the
evolutionary
chain.
3. That unknown
agency wanted
the resulting
humanoids to
know what
had been done
and they left a
m essage
indicated by
the dynamics



of the Moon.
We were well aware that there were
some issues with these assumptions,
which, if we forced ourselves to reconcile
them simultaneously, would inhibit
lateral thinking. One such problem was
the issue of motivation: Why would any
agency want a grand plan that spanned
a period that was equal to around fifty
per cent of the age of the Universe at
that astronomically distant time? This
would be long-range planning beyond
all comprehension. Even then, how did



such an agency know that the resulting
life form would have ten digits? We
would try and deal with these issues but
it might be necessary to tackle them at a
later stage.
Another problem that had to be
put to one side for the moment, was the
issue of how Stone-Age builders came to
be using units of measurement that are
the key to decoding the message. These
issues, amongst others, will have to be
dealt with in due course, but now we
will review the basis of the message.



At the root of our hypothesis is the
idea that the very dimensions and
movements of the Moon are designed
to alert us to the fact that this is not a
natural body. We therefore need to go
back to the beginning of the solar
system itself.
No one knows for sure how the
solar system came into existence but,
despite all of the ideas about the Moon
being made from the Earth, everyone
agrees that the Sun, Earth and the
Moon were all formed around 4.6



billion years ago. It is thought that the
Earth and the Moon were formed very
soon after the Sun became a star.
Theories come and theories go, but
it is likely that it all began when a vast
cloud of dust and gas in an empty
region of our galaxy became
compressed by starlight and
gravitational forces, thereby causing an
accumulation process. Otto Schmidt
first put the theory of ‘accretion’
forward in 1944 and as more and more
evidence has become available,



competitor theories have withered away.
In some way, that astronomers do
not yet understand, the Sun was formed
and produced light and heat much as it
does today. The cloud of dust and gas
that was wheeling around the new star,
kept on cooling and shrinking and
whirling faster and faster before
separating into rings. Each of these rings
also kept on cooling and shrinking and
is thought to have gradually gathered
together into a sphere of fiery gas, in the
case of the terrestrial planets, before



cooling so much that the main part of it
became liquid and, eventually, solid.
Until quite recently there were two
principle theories to explain the Moon’s
existence. One was that it was an object
that had formed elsewhere and was
somehow taken into Earth’s orbit; and
the other was a theory called ‘co
accretion’ or the ‘double planet’
hypothesis. This second theory
supposed that the Earth and the Moon
simply grew together as twins, born out
of the primordial swarm of small



‘planetesimals’. However, when lunar
rocks were brought back to Earth it was
realized that the Moon has no
substantial metallic iron core and that
its rocks have oxygen isotopic ratios that
are identical to the Earth’s.
The theory that the Moon had
originated elsewhere died instantly
because it was obvious that the rocks
had formed in exactly the same region
of the solar system as those of the Earth.
But the worrying point was that the
only alternative theory was as effectively



debunked as the ‘capture’ hypothesis.
The ‘co-accretion’ could not be correct
because the type and proportion of
materials should be pretty much the
same for both bodies if they were twin
planets.
Suddenly there was no theory of
the Moon’s origin in existence. Scientists
tell us that nature abhors a vacuum
but scientists abhor a vacuum even
more. Something had to be found to
explain the inexplicable.
It took some years, but in 1984 an



idea that seemed to explain the facts was
put forward. The original Big Whack
theory was an attempt to explain how
the Moon could be made of selected
Earth materials. For reasons already
covered, it is a theory that simply does
not work and we are still in a position
where there is no watertight explanation
for the Moon being where it is.
So let us return to what is generally
held to be true about the early solar
system. The process of making the
Earth was not especially quick, as Stein



B Jacobsen, a professor of geochemistry
at Harvard University says: ‘Within
100,000 years of the formation of the
Sun, the first embryos of the planets
Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars had
formed... Some grew more rapidly
than others, and within ten million
years, about sixty-five per cent of Earth
had formed.’ 25
Let us now consider a theory of the
Earth–Moon system that does work.
The thrust is that it is the result of
intelligent design. We do not know who



or what this hypothetical intelligence
was, so we will designate it UCA
(Unknown Creative Agency) for the
time being.



In the Beginning
The young star was shining out, and the
clouds of matter that had recently
circled around it in a series of rings had
begun the process of accreting into
spheres at differing ranges from the star.
One of these proto-planets was some
150,000 kilometres distant from the
mother star and the UCA realized that
it had the potential to produce
intelligence.
The UCA may believe that the



Universe is destined to die, maybe by
becoming a smooth and static soup of
incredibly thinly dispersed matter, just a
tiny fraction above absolute zero. A
nothingness that would essentially be
the end of everything – even time.
The goal of the UCA was to seed
life wherever possible, to create
intelligent beings that could flourish
and go out and seed more life
themselves. In this way the very fabric
of the Universe would be turned into
self-aware matter that would slowly halt



and reverse the mindless spiral into
entropy and eternal chaos. They had a
model to use for this location – one that
would produce a specific type of
intelligent creature, based on carbon
and enabled by liquid water.
But it would take several billion
years for the tumbling sphere to
stabilize and go through a process of
evolution of life forms that would result
in a species with the intelligence and,
more importantly, the imagination to
understand their role of striking out



into the cosmos to shape and form
swirling stardust – and then give it the
spark of life.
It was important that when this
fledgling planet spawned its thinking
and technologically able offspring, the
creatures would understand exactly
what had happened to bring them into
existence, so that they could eventually
repeat the process themselves. In this
way, a self-aware Universe would
continue to replicate itself across the
massive span of space and time.



The engineering requirement was
dem anding.
The proto-planet was completely
unstable and it was destined to develop
a surface that would be far too rigid to
create the necessary conditions for life to
begin and to thrive. It required a
regulator – a gravitational presence close
by, that would tip it over just enough to
cause the surface to have a tiny
temperature range that would oscillate
gently to evenly distribute the energy
radiated from its mother star. This also



had to be a regulator that would initially
use its gravity to plough the surface so
that essential minerals could be released
for the life-development process to
continue.
It was clear that the planet needed
to have a loosened surface and the
obvious conclusion was to manufacture
the regulator from the surface material.
This would reduce the tendency of the
surface to form one continuous crust
and would allow movement within the
crust itself. Judging the required mass,



size and orbital characteristics of the
regulator was a stupendously complex
calculation, because it not only needed
to have a changing relationship with the
planet over time – it also had to contain
the message addressed to the resulting
intelligent life form.
The equilibrium point was
calculated and it was found that
seventy-four quintillion tonnes would
have to be removed from the planet to
manufacture the regulator. To meet all
requirements it was going to need a



mass that was only 1.234 per cent of the
revised planet yet its physical size had to
be a relatively large, being 27.322 per
cent of its parent. It would therefore
have to be made with the barest
minimum of heavy elements such as
iron and, even then, it would need to
either be partially hollow or have the
consistency of a sponge.
Mechanisms were then put in
place to remove a stream of material
from the young planet, that would be
spun into a new planet in close Earth



orbit. The design was such that the
regulator would slowly increase its
orbital distance until it reached an
average range of around 384,500
kilometres at the expected time of the
arrival of intelligent life. This would
mean that to the creatures on the
planet’s surface, the disc of the regulator
would appear, with the naked eye, to be
the same size as the star at the centre of
the system – which would be the first
line of the message to make the
developing Earth creatures become
curious about the regulator. The



realization that the factor for each was
precisely 400 would also indicate that
the message would be delivered in base
ten arithmetic.
Perhaps the UCA used something
like black-hole technology to carefully
strip only lighter elements from the
infant planet. A black hole is a super
dense entity with so much gravity that
even light is jsucked into it, like dust
into a vacuum cleaner. A black hole
with the mass of Mount Everest would
have a miniscule radius – roughly the



size of an atomic nucleus – and current
thinking is that it would be hard for
such a black hole to swallow anything,
although it would certainly attract
material like a giant magnet. Such an
idea might explain the mascons (the
regions of high gravity) still found on
the Moon.
However the engineering job was
undertaken, the biggest challenge was to
communicate the message that the
intelligent creatures endemic to the
Earth would spot, because the very



familiarity of seeing the regulator in the
night sky would cause them to take it
for granted. And the UCA knew that
intelligence sometimes leads to a dulling
of imagination, resulting in confusion
between ‘describing’ and
‘understanding’. Contrary to what some
intelligent individuals consider, the
ability to describe something does not
equate with understanding it.
The next levels of the message
needed to be more difficult to ignore.
The decision was made to create



number patterns that stand out as very
strange.
The UCA realized that it needed to
draw further attention to the artificial
nature of the regulator by building on a
truly fundamental number that
represented the planet. The number
that was chosen was the planet’s spin
rate per orbit of the star, which would
have to be instantly recognizable as a
value that was unique to the planet – a
natural PIN (personal identification
number) for an entire world. So, in this



case it was a Planetary Identification
Number that was required.
At the required time window, the
planet would be rotating at a rate of 366
revolutions for each orbit around its
mother star, and the use of the number
value 366 would therefore be easily
spotted as the Planetary Identification
Num ber.
The intelligent creatures would
recognize the PIN number from an
early date as it requires only very basic
astronomy to appreciate that this three



digit number is the most fundamental
of all numbers that are unique to the
planet.
Surely these Earth-dwelling
creatures would be very surprised when
they calculated the relative size of their
planet to the orbiting regulator and
discovered that the one is 366 per cent
larger than the other.
The regulator was also engineered
with a PIN number that was
meaningful to the intended intelligent
creatures. That number would be the



reciprocal of the planet’s PIN number
the mirror image of 366.
The mathematics was simplicity
itself. The regulator’s PIN number
would be arrived at by considering its
size as 100 per cent and dividing it by
the relative size of the planet, namely
366 per cent. Working to five decimal
places the result is:
100/366 = 0.27322
The regulator was then carefully
engineered so that at the key point in



time it would be orbiting the planet at a
rate of once every 27.322 planetary
days.
Surely, the creatures would notice
that? And as an extra layer, if they
looked at the issue the other way
around, the size of the regulator
compared to the planet has precisely the
same number value – being 27.322 per
cent of its parent.
Surely the intelligent Earth
creatures could not fail to be alerted by
such an unbelievably improbable



number matching? There is absolutely
no reason why the regulator’s orbital
period in planetary days should
numerically echo the relative size
relationship it also enjoyed with the
Earth.
The consequence of these
arrangements would not be lost on the
new life forms because they would easily
realize that for every 10,000 of their
planetary days, the regulator would
complete exactly 366 orbits of the
planet. Surely they would spot the use



of round base-ten numbers and the PIN
number 366 being echoed by the
regulator?
But then, if they did not recognize
these message patterns it would mean
that they still lacked the intelligence or
imagination to be considered mature.



Fitting the Moon into the
Earth–Sun Model
It struck us as extremely likely that the
UCA must have had some control over
the Earth’s rate of spin and its orbital
speed, so that they could ensure that it
got to the magic 366 rotations at the
required time. From everything that is
known about the Earth, its orbital speed
has been steadily decreasing for a long
time but to the astonishment of
scientists at the National Institute for
Science and Technology in Boulder,



Colorado, it suddenly stopped this
deceleration in 1999. CNN reported the
story on January 2nd 2004 saying:
‘Experts agree that
the rate at which the
Earth travels
through space has
slowed ever so
slightly for
millennia. To make
the world’s official
time agree with
where the Earth



actually is in space,
scientists in 1972
started adding an
extra ‘leap second’
on the last day of
the year.
For twenty-eight
years, scientists
repeated the
procedure. But in
1999, they
discovered the Earth
was no longer
lagging behind.



At the National
Institute for Science
and Technology in
Boulder,
spokesman Fred
McGehan said most
scientists agree the
Earth’s orbit around
the sun has been
gradually slowing
for millennia. But
he said they don’t
have a good
explanation for why



it’s suddenly on
schedule.’
This caused us to look up the actual
speed that the Earth has settled at in its
circumnavigation of the Sun, and we
were surprised to find that its mean
orbital velocity is almost exactly one ten
thousandth of the speed of light in a
vacuum. At 29,780 metres per second,
the variance is less than two-thirds of
one percent.
We thought that this was probably
a coincidence – but we could not pick



and choose which factors are, and are
not, significant. And we had to
remember that the value 10,000 had
already shown up in the number of
Earth days for every 366 lunar orbits.
We next turned our attention to
the Sun. The diameter of the Sun is
estimated at 1,392,000km and as the
average diameter of the Earth is
12,742km, so it follows that 109.245
Earths could be placed side by side
along the diameter of the Sun. This is
not a number that stands out for any



reason – at least not immediately. But
when we looked at the number of Sun
diameters in the Earth’s aphelion (its
greatest distance to the Sun) we found
that there are 109.267, effectively an
identical value because the estimate of
the Sun’s diameter is within this tiny
m argin.
How strange. There are the same
number of Earth diameters in the Sun’s
diameter as there are Sun diameters
between the Earth and the Sun. This is a
near perfect echo that does not work for



any other planet in the solar system.
These numbers are ratios and are
therefore real and independent of units
of measurement. But the number also
stood out because there are 10,920.8km
in the Moon’s equatorial circumference.
At the time we noticed this, we
considered that it really did have to be a
coincidence because the number of
kilometres in anything just could not be
relevant since the metre is a unit that is
an invented human convention.
But then we realized that the Moon



turns at a rate of precisely one kilometre
every second at its equator and that did
strike us as very odd. Maybe we had
been too hasty in rejecting the role of
the metric system.
Our observations about the
patterns inherent in the size and
movement of the Moon, in terms of
ratios, stand out as being beyond mere
accident. Although we accept that the
apparent patterns that rely on units of
measurement, such as kilometres, are
far harder to accept without an



explanation of how this could have
come about. Any ‘reasonable’ person
would immediately reject such factors
as meaningless – but then we think
there is a great deal in the old adage that
‘all progress is dependent on the
unreasonable person’.
And some people would not even
get to the point of recognizing the
patterns in the ratios within the Sun
Earth–Moon system. A scientifically
trained person looking at any one of
these points would almost certainly



respond by saying that ‘all numbers are
equally valid’. A value such as 100 or
40,000 dropping out of the mix is just
as likely as any other number.
We absolutely agree with this view
and we would ignore such results if they
were only happening once or even twice,
but we are confronting a whole list of
non random-looking values that add
up to create what would otherwise be
the most unlikely series of chance events
in the history of the cosmos. And, in
our view, anyone who dismisses all of



these points as coincidence is being
either very illogical or downright
dishonest.
It is absolutely true that if someone
tosses a coin 100 times and it comes out
heads every time, the chance of the next
toss resulting in another head is exactly
50/50. However, if this ever happens to
you in the real world, we would suggest
that, before you let them toss the coin
again, you check that it is not double
headed. Only a fool would not be
suspicious.



Scientific discovery has always been
a process of identifying patterns that
stand out from the chaos of random
events. For example, identifying areas
where there are more cases of a specific
illness is likely to point to a local factor
such as radioactive bedrock, a leakage of
harmful industrial effluence or a
contaminated food plant. When
something varies markedly from the
norm there is usually a reason.
If we look at the available
information logically, and without



preconceptions of what is and is not
possible, the Moon appears to have
been inserted into the Sun–Earth
relationship with the accuracy of the
proverbial Swiss clockmaker!



A Recent Interaction
It appears that no one has previously
spotted this message and we only came
across it because of our findings relating
to Megalithic units. We suspect that the
problem is one of too much knowledge
and a loss of the ability of experts, in
our super-technological world, to think
simply. Perhaps if Galileo or Isaac
Newton had access to the information
that we have today they would have
noticed these issues concerning the
Moon, but, alas, they did not have the



accurate measurements that we have
today and therefore they could not
observe the patterns. Today we have the
necessary information, but astronomers
are understandably more interested in
quasars, pulsars and all kinds of deep
space objects rather than the
fundamentals of the Earth–Moon
relationship.
We now needed to consider a
scenario that would explain how the
Megalithic Yard came to be involved in
this ultra-long-distance message.



Maybe the UCA was aware of the
potential problem of the message
headline being missed due to over
sophistication and took steps to inject
extra information near to the key
moment when the message needed to
be interpreted. Perhaps, we mused, the
UCA had stepped in at a number of key
points throughout the process of
human development.
These thoughts were more
complex than the set-and-forget
scenario of an unknown agency



building a planetary regulator that was,
in effect, an incubator for life. The idea
that some entity, probably an advanced
species from another galaxy, established
a mechanism to foster life and then
moved on seemed reasonable in the face
of such evidence. But to have an agency
that has maintained a periodic
involvement with humankind across
several billions of years is much harder
to reconcile.
However, we decided to stick to
our methodology of viewing the reasons



‘why’ ahead of dealing with the reasons
‘why not’. We needed to review the
material from ancient history and
prehistory that had brought us to look
so hard at the Moon.
Firstly we had to remember that it
was because the stone structures from
the fourth millennium BC were
apparently created to study the Moon,
that Alexander Thom began his lifetime
quest to investigate them. Could these
large standing stones be pointing
deliberately at the Moon and the Sun?



The orientation of the Megalithic
structures certainly led him to identify
the Megalithic Yard as being a unit of
82.96656cm – give or take 0.61cm. And
this in turn led us to the findings laid
out in this book.
As stated earlier, we had discovered
that the Megalithic Yard was merely the
starting point of a holistic measuring
system that dealt with linear distance,
mass, volume and time. It was an
utterly brilliant system and we found
that many modern units had descended



from it, such as the imperial pint and
the pound. We had been unable to
imagine how the pound and the pint
could have survived across so many
millennia but it is a fact of mathematics
that they are directly related, either by
design or by an incredible series of
coincidences.
To recap, the most intriguing fact
about the Megalithic Yard lay in the
way it had been ingeniously devised to
fit accurately into the circumference of
the Earth. Megalithic geometry was



slightly different to the 360-degree
geometry invented by the Sumerians,
which is still in use more than four
thousand years later. It had been based
on 366 degrees, apparently (and very
logically) because the Earth revolves
once on its axis whilst it travels in its
great orbital circle around the Sun.
Under this Stone-Age system of
geometry, each of the 366 degrees was
split into sixty minutes of arc and each
minute of arc into six seconds of arc.
The incredible beauty of the



system is that when the globe of the
Earth was treated as a huge circle, the
polar circumference of the Earth is
exactly the right size to give 366
Megalithic Yards to a polar second of
arc.
We had been very surprised at the
way the Megalithic Yard bisected the
circumference of the Earth, but what we
didn’t expect to discover was any direct
connection between the Megalithic Yard
and other bodies within our solar
system. And there are none – apart



from the Moon and the Sun.
The Moon has a beautifully neat
100 Megalithic Yards to each second of
arc, which could be a very odd
coincidence if it were not for all of the
other facts we discovered which point to
a whole range of round numbers. And
of course the Sun has an incredibly
round 40,000 Megalithic Yards to each
Megalithic second of arc. What a perfect
way to announce an awareness that the
Moon is exactly 400 times smaller than
the Sun.



We also noted that whilst the Sun
has 40,000 Megalithic Yards to a
Megalithic second of arc, the metric
system was designed so that the Earth’s
polar circumference would be 40,000
kilom etres.
It had struck us as quite amazing
that anyone more than 5,000 years ago
could have created a unit of measure
that worked as a perfect integer of the
planet within such an elegant system of
geometry – starting and finishing with
the Earth’s PIN number of 366. Whilst



this was impressive, we were perplexed
at the apparent impossibility of creating
a unit and a geometry that produced
beautifully round integers on the Earth,
Moon and Sun. To do so should be as
close to impossible as anything can get.
Units that are integer, within the
same geometry, for two heavenly bodies
would be very difficult – but three?
That’s ridiculous! And yet the sums
spoke for themselves. The fact that the
approach did not work for any other
body in the solar system pointed to a



very special relationship for the Earth,
Moon and Sun.
The apparent impossibility of the
Neolithic inhabitants having had the
skills to develop such a marvellous
system is now resolved when we
introduce the unknown creative agency
because, if it started with knowledge of
the dimensions of the two original
bodies (the Sun and the Earth), it could
have engineered the Moon to made it fit
the same rules. Our hypothesis was,
therefore, to assume that the UCA



somehow instructed the Stone-Age
builders to adopt the system we call
Megalithic geometry.
In our previous book, Civilization
One, we speculated that the earliest
records of the Sumerians and the
ancient Egyptians were actually correct
when they claimed that their own
civilizations had been instructed in the
arts and sciences by an external agency.
In these records there are references to
people called ‘the watchers’ who taught
geometry, mathematics, astronomy,



agriculture and other sciences. The
indigenous population did not know
where these people had come from and
they described them as having
superhuman powers, although they
were clearly human beings and not
gods.
In around 3100 BC, ancient Egypt
became a united kingdom and its
period of recorded history began. At the
same time, the Sumerians were building
their great cities and developing
sophisticated techniques of



metalworking, glass manufacture and
agriculture. In the Indus valley of the
Indian subcontinent, the Harappa and
Mohenjodaro civilizations were also
constructing huge cities and in the
British Isles, superb megalithic
structures like Newgrange, Maes Howe
and the Ring of Brodgar were being
built. Is it not very strange indeed, that
within such a precise period of time the
whole world suddenly decided to step
up a gear and enter into a period of true
civilization?



We found it more than odd that
these unconnected peoples should all
take such a large step forward at exactly
the same time. And we have recently
come across very new information that
made our suspicions even greater. On
December 23rd 2004, new findings were
published that markedly revise the
dating of the first American
civilizations. It reported that evidence
now shows that the oldest civilization in
the Americas dates back far earlier than
previously thought – in fact right back
to 3100 BC, at which time complex



societies and communal building
suddenly appeared in Peru. This
emerging culture was the first in the
Americas to develop centralized
decision-making, formalized religion,
social hierarchies and a mixed economy
based on agriculture and fishing.
One member of the team that has
reported these findings in the pre
eminent scientific journal, Nature, is
Jonathan Haas of the Department of
Anthropology at the Field Museum in
Chicago. He said:



‘The scale and
sophistication of
these sites is
unheard of
anywhere in the
New World at this
time, and at almost
any time. These
dates push back the
origins of
civilization in the
Americas to
something more
parallel to those of



the other great early
civilizations.’ 26
Some of the settlements that are
believed to have had at least 3,000
inhabitants included platform mounds,
thought to be pyramids, central plazas,
temples and housing. The largest
pyramid at Caral, known as the
Primade Mayor, is contemporary with
the earlier Egyptian pyramids, dating
from 2627 BC. From this data, the
archaeologists have concluded that there
was large-scale communal construction



and population concentration across the
entire area.
Dr José Oliver, a lecturer in Latin
American archaeology at the Institute of
Archaeology at University College
London, said: ‘This confirms that by
3100 BC monumental buildings were
already under way, not just at an
isolated site but across a whole region.’
As we have already stated, science
is about recognizing patterns. Humans
have not changed physically or
intellectually over the last hundred



thousand years but suddenly, just over
5,000 years ago, unconnected people
around the world began building major
structures and cities; but apart from
some Sumerian–Egyptian interaction,
these groups appear to have developed
quite independently. Archaeology has
not found obvious cross-cultural
artefacts so it is assumed that they all
blossomed at the same time through
sheer coincidence.
But if they appeared worldwide
because they had all benefited from the



instruction of an unknown creative
agency, one shouldn’t necessarily expect
an exact commonality of interpretation
of these ideas. Nevertheless, it is clear
that there are some significant cultural
connections such as the building of
pyramids and Venus worship.
There is, it seems, some very
powerful, albeit circumstantial, evidence
for an intervention by a highly
advanced group more than 5,000 years
ago. We have to admit, however, that
we cannot conceive how any agency



could have maintained contact with the
Earth’s development over several
billions of years. Nevertheless, we do not
see it as our place to reject information
just because we cannot explain it.
Everything depends on the ground rules
of the observer: if someone refuses to
look at obvious patterns because they
consider a pattern should not be there,
then they will see nothing but the
reflection of their own prejudices.



Reciprocal Numbers
As we reflected on what we had found,
the number play involved in the Earth
Moon–Sun system was nothing less
than staggering. We were amused by the
charm of this virtual machine especially
when using the metric system. We
looked at this little equation using
kilom etres:
(Moon x Earth)/100
= Sun
This means that if we multiply the



circumference of the Moon by that of
the Earth, the result is 436,669,140km.
If we then divide this figure by 100 we
arrive at 436,669km, which is the
circumference of the Sun, correct to
99.9 per cent.
How weird!
Of course, if we divide the
circumference of the Sun by that of the
Moon and multiply by 100 we get the
polar circumference of the Earth. And,
as we have pointed out, if we divide the
size of the Sun by the size of the Earth



and multiply by 100 we get the size of
the Moon.
None of this is magic or pointless
numerology. It may well be nothing
more than an amusing coincidence but,
given all of the ratio patterning we have
observed, it would be foolish to ignore
it.
However, the idea that kilometres
can be meaningful to issues regarding
the Moon is hard to swallow. Any
reader could be forgiven for doubting
what they read here. Nevertheless if



anyone chooses to check out the
numbers – it all works. And if you are
still not sure about the idea, have a look
at this fact; it certainly astounded us
when we came across it.
The Moon has a sidereal rotation
period of 655.728 hours, which means
it rotates once every 27.322 Earth days.
Given that the Moon has an equatorial
circumference of 10,920.8 kilometres,
this means that the Moon is turning at
400 kilometres per Earth day!
Just consider these unquestionable



facts as a whole:
The Moon is one
400th the size of the
Sun.
The Moon is 400
times closer to the
Earth than the Sun.
The Moon is
rotating at a rate of
400km per Earth
day.
Coincidence? Well, maybe – or maybe
not.



The Earth is rotating at 40,000
kilometres a day and the Moon is
turning at a rather precise 100 times
less. The Moon always faces the Earth as
it travels on its orbit around our planet
and yet the average distance is such that
the equatorial rotational speed is
precisely one per cent of an Earth day.
These figures are entirely checkable and
indisputable. How could all this be
accidental?
Surely, only a fool would not wish
to examine this situation further. Yet we



have to be realistic about how some
people will view our decision to consider
the apparently impossible. We are well
aware that many, and possibly most,
experts will turn a blind eye.
Terence Kealey, a clinical
biochemist and the Vice-Chancellor of
the University of Buckingham, wrote an
article in the (London) Times on
November 15th 2004 under the title
‘Who says science is about facts? They
only get in the way of a good theory’. In
this he recollected as follows:



‘When Charles
Moore was editing
The Spectator he
once asked me why,
of his contributors,
it was those trained
in science who were
the least honest...
Charles Moore had
supposed that
scientists would
revere facts, but that
supposition is a
myth: scientists



actually treat facts
the way barristers
treat hostile
witnesses – with
suspicion.
The mythmaker
was Karl Popper.
Popper was not a
scientist but a
political
philosopher who
proposed that
science works by
‘falsifiability’:



scientists discover
facts; they create a
theory to explain
them; and the
theory is accepted
until it is falsified by
the discovery of
incompatible facts
that then inspire a
new theory... Yet it
is a myth that
working scientists
always respect
falsifiability.



Scientists often
ignore inconvenient
findings.’
We could not agree more, and therefore
we will not be surprised if people ignore
the possibility that the metric system
just might be (crazy though it sounds)
fundamental in some way to the Sun
and the Moon as well as to the Earth.
The fact remains that, for some reason,
the kilometre demonstrates the essence
of the Sun–Moon–Earth relationship,
both in terms of size and orbital



characteristics.
As if all of this isn’t incredible
enough we must also address the fact
that the Moon has an orbit that makes
it a ‘mirror of time’. As we observed
earlier, the Moon mimics the Sun at key
points in the year. For example, whilst
the Sun sets in the north at the time of
the summer solstice, the Moon sets in
the south and when the Sun sets in the
south at the time of the winter solstice,
the Moon unerringly sets in the north.
This is an aspect of Sun and Moon



associations that undoubtedly seemed
like magic to our ancient ancestors and
is yet another reflection of the current
position and orbital characteristics of
the Moon.



The Reasons Why Not
We have a constructed a scenario that
fits all the facts but has deliberately
ignored some of the challenging
consequences that have arisen. We now
need to deal with the reasons why this
scenario might be wrong. Without the
intellectual tether of having to conform
to ideas that are within the bounds of
what is already accepted, we have
argued that an intelligent agency
constructed the Moon to enable life to
develop upon the planet we call Earth.



We have taken a holistic view and we
have not ignored any facts that we do
not wish to have in our picture of what
might have been.
The first problem that we thought
we confronted – that of motivation, has
been potentially answered in that it
might be part of a grand quest to
convert the Universe into an intelligent,
self-aware single entity at the end of
time. Such an idea would certainly
seem to sit well with the principles of
some Eastern belief systems such as



Hinduism .
The Moon was already
outrageously impossible before we
introduced the issues of the intricate
web of interrelated values, which we
have argued is a deliberate message.
With the number values that exist in the
ratios alone, we fail to understand how
anyone could seriously claim that they
are coincidences. But the biggest
challenge we have to confront is the
issue of how the Megalithic Yard and
the metric system came to be involved



with an artificial Moon constructed as a
life-support system for the Earth.
We cannot hide from the problem
that, if our deductions are accurate, our
unidentified creative agency has had
contact with us at least once over the
last 6,000 years. If this agency wished
humans to know what they had done
and they (or it) are capable of making
contact so recently – then why don’t
they just turn up right now and tell us
what was done in the distant past,
instead of leaving messages on the



Moon?
We were puzzled. This did not
seem to make sense.
As we debated this tricky point, we
considered an alternative scenario that
would not require direct contact from
the UCA. Perhaps, we mused, the rise
of the Megalithic system and even the
metric system were programmed into
our planet, to the extent that humans
respond to these values quite naturally
and without knowing why. Perhaps the
gravitational effects of the Sun and the



Moon interact with the Earth’s own
gravity and the effects of its spinning
journey through space. It is known that
the spinning orbit of the Earth does
cause a disturbance in time-space, so
maybe the value that we have called the
PIN number, the value 366, is actually
the heartbeat of our planet. Perhaps we
cannot help but follow certain
numerical patterns?
We were raising questions faster
than we were solving problems but there
was a strong logic to this notion. We



knew that the ancient Sumerians had
used a system virtually identical to the
metric system in the middle of the third
millennium BC, with a double kush
that was 99.88 per cent of a metre. This
unit was accompanied by others that
were virtually a litre and a kilo.
We had already noted that the
second of time appeared to be real in
some way, rather than just an abstract
convention. On Earth a pendulum that
swings at a rate of once a second will
have a length of a metre, with tiny



variations dependent on the user’s
precise distance from the planet’s core.
Perhaps the values programmed
into the Earth by the UCA were so
fundamental that any intelligent life
form evolving on the Earth would
respond to them. The relatively recent
discovery that pendulums appear to go
haywire during a total eclipse could
point to brief interruptions of this
Earthly harmony. We were aware that
we were putting speculation upon
speculation but it made sense. And we



have to remember that we are not trying
to displace any well-reasoned theory
already in existence, so these possibilities
have the benefit of being alone in fitting
all of the known facts.
The bottom line to all this is that
some unknown creative agency made
the Moon out of parts of the Earth so
that it would act as an incubator for life.
The next question to confront was this:
What was put into the incubator so that
it would eventually grow into an
intelligent life form? Setting up the



hardware was impressive enough but
what software was used?



‘A super-intelligence is the only
good explanation for the origin
of life and the complexity of
nature.’
Professor Anthony Flew, December 2004



Not very long ago, religion was the only
guide to the way the world was
perceived. For right or for wrong the
various scriptures of theological
tradition provided a way of making
sense of everything from the miracle of
birth to the movement of the stars in
the sky. But today we have rational
thinking – we have science.
The word ‘science’ is from the
Latin scire, meaning ‘to know’ and it is
concerned with the organization of
objectively verifiable sense experience. In



other words, it makes sense of the way
we see the world in a testable and
verifiable way. It seems that there is
nothing that science cannot explain
given enough time and study. From
Anthropology to Zoology, the people of
the twenty-first century have experts
who can explain where almost
everything came from and how it
works.
But science does have its limits.
The Heisenberg uncertainty principle,
for example, means that we cannot



exactly know the position and the
momentum of a particle
simultaneously. We can choose one or
the other – but we cannot have both.
And there is at least one subject that
science appears to be unable to explain.
The origin of life.
In his book, How to Think Straight,
Professor Anthony Flew has pointed out
that practical reasoning and clear
thinking are essential for everyone who
wants to make proper sense of the
information we receive each day. He



stresses the importance of being able to
quickly know the difference between
valid and invalid arguments, the
contradictory versus the contrary,
vagueness and ambiguity, contradiction
and self-contradiction, the truthful and
the fallacious. These, he says, are the
qualities that separate clear thinkers
from the crowd.27After sixty-six years as
a leading champion of atheism and
logical thinking, Professor Anthony
Flew has made sense of new
information which has led him to state
that science appears to have proven the



existence of God. Flew’s reason for this
monumental about turn is the
discovery of evidence that shows that
some sort of intelligence must have
created the world we inhabit. He has
particularly pointed to the investigation
of DNA by biologists, which has shown
that an unbelievable complexity of the
arrangements are needed to produce
life; leading to the conclusion that
intelligence must have been involved.
We have bemoaned the lack of
objectivity that often pervades the



academic community but we must
applaud a man who is prepared, at the
age of eighty-one, to throw away the
cornerstone of his life’s work. That takes
guts!
The first the world knew of Flew’s
change of heart was his letter to the
August–September 2004 issue of the
Philosophy Now journal where he stated:
‘It has become inordinately difficult
even to begin to think about
constructing a naturalistic theory of the
evolution of that first reproducing



organism .’
Flew is a man of principle and
when he was asked if his startlingly new
ideas would upset some people, he
responded by saying, ‘That’s too bad...
my whole life has been guided by the
principle of Plato’s Socrates: Follow the
evidence, wherever it leads.’
How refreshing. That is exactly
what we are trying to do with the
information we have gathered about the
Moon and the origins of life on our
apparently designed incubator.



We have arrived at a point where
we need to try and understand the
emergence of life. And we find, at this
precise moment, that the old
assumptions about how life originated
have been thrown out of the window.
The first question we asked
ourselves is: What do we mean by ‘life’?
We use the term to cover all kinds
of organisms from cyanobacteria to
plants and animals. The essence of life
is reproduction, the formation of
identical or near identical copies of a



complex structure from simple starting
materials. The increase of complexity
involved in the formation of living
organisms from their precursors
distinguishes the processes of biological
growth and reproduction from physical
processes such as crystallization. This
local increase of complexity can also be
described as a decrease of entropy,
which we have already speculated might
be the motivation of the unknown
creative agency that seeded and
promoted life on Earth.



But where is the boundary of what
is and what is not a life form. Is, for
example, a virus a living entity? The
standard answer is ‘no it is not’, but that
is now seen as a very debatable point.
Viruses cannot replicate on their own
but can do so when they occupy a host.
In the late nineteenth century,
researchers realized that some diseases
were caused by biological objects that
were then thought to be the simplest
and smallest of all living, gene-bearing
life-forms. Throughout most of the
twentieth century, though, viruses have



been designated as non-living material.
All living organisms possess a
genome, which is the set of instructions
for making the body, and this is always
composed of nucleic acid. It is usually
DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) or in the
case of some viruses, RNA (ribonucleic
acid). The genome consists of a number
of genes, each of which is a segment of
nucleic acid coding for a particular type
of protein molecule. In October 2004,
French researchers announced findings
that blurred the boundary once again.



Didier Raoult and his colleagues at the
University of the Mediterranean in
Marseille announced that they had
sequenced the genome of the largest
known virus, Mimivirus, which had
been discovered in 1992. This virus,
about the size of a small bacterium,
contained numerous genes previously
thought to only exist in cellular
organisms. The virus is therefore a very
smart bit of ‘dead’ matter or it is part of
a unique club of entities only known to
exist upon Earth.



The remarkable nature of living
matter caused astrobiologist Paul Davies
to observe in December 2004:
‘Most people take
the existence of life
for granted, but to a
physicist like me it
seems astounding.
How do stupid
atoms do such
clever things?
Physicists normally
think of matter in



terms of inert, clod
like particles jostling
each other, so the
elaborate
organization of the
living cell appears
little short of
m iraculous.
Evidently, living
organisms represent
a state of matter in
a class apart from
the rest.’



The Solution that
Identified the Problem
Back in 1953, when Watson and Crick
discovered the helical structure of the
DNA molecule and the general way that
it coded the formation and replication
of proteins in cells, it seemed that a
plausible scientific explanation for the
origin of life was about to be assembled.
The laboratory synthesis of amino acids
from basic chemicals further heightened
the expectations that humankind was
on the verge of creating a living cell.



It was suggested that the early
Earth, through a mixture of volcanic
activity and landmass weathering, had
acquired oceans rich in nutrients and
chemicals – known as ‘the primeval
soup’. It was in the constant mixing and
intermixing of chemicals, and probably
with the aid of lightning strikes, that the
first primitive life had come into
existence – or so the evolutionists
suggested. Experts remained confident
that the primeval soup theory was the
most likely explanation and were
convinced that, given time, someone



would manage to create life in a
laboratory.
Soon after Watson and Crick’s
discovery, Stanley Miller, a graduate
student from Chicago University, co
operated with Harold Urey, a Nobel
Prize winner, to recreate the exact
circumstances that are believed to have
existed in the primeval soup of the
infant Earth. Their soup contained
water vapour, hydrogen, methane and
ammonia. It was estimated that
lightning had played a part in the



emergence of life, so Miller and Urey
provided an electrical spark to their
chemical soup and eventually succeeded
in creating simple amino acids.
‘Hooray!’, they and everyone else
concerned said, because amino acids are
a major component of organic life.
Unfortunately, more than half a
century later, no one has come any
closer to actually creating life than this.
It has also been pointed out that
the amino acids created by Miller, Urey
and others are but a tiny few of the



constituents required for life. In any
case, the experiment was very selective
in its methods. Amino acids are referred
to as being left- and right-handed, both
of which were present in Miller and
Urey’s soup, whereas life uses only left
handed amino acids. What is more, the
very electrical spark that created the
amino acids would also have destroyed
them, so they had to be artificially
isolated in the experiment.
It might be thought reasonable
that if life once formed in the oceans, it



would continue to do so today. In
reality this can’t happen because the
mixture of temperatures, chemicals and
gases present is wrong. It was generally
accepted that life could not
spontaneously appear in an oxygen rich
atmosphere and so the evolutionists
had to suggest a very different sort of
atmosphere on the infant Earth.
(Oxygen, whilst preserving life, destroys
organic molecules that are not alive.)
Generating life in the laboratory
proved to be utterly impossible and



researchers began to realize that new
natural laws would need to be
discovered to explain how the high
degree of order and specificity of even a
single cell could be generated by
random, natural processes.
The DNA molecule is in the form
of a double helix – rather like a ladder
twisted into a spiral. The bases of the
DNA are found in pairs and these make
up the rungs of the ladder that carry the
information to replicate the entity.
When DNA copies itself, the ladder



breaks down the middle of the rungs.
New bases are matched to the bases of
each upright and so the original DNA
molecule then becomes two new
identical molecules of DNA.
Information necessary to build new
proteins, and to perform other
necessary chemical changes, is taken to
various parts of a cell by another
molecule, this one being ribonucleic
acid (RNA). RNA is similar to DNA but
is only a single helix. RNA is therefore
the ‘messenger’ that allows the
information held within DNA to be



distributed and acted upon.
An important question remains,
and it is one that science still cannot
answer. How did DNA come about in
the first place, because as things stand
now, only DNA can create DNA.
Some chromosomes contain
extremely long strings of DNA of more
than a metre in length, which is colossal
considering the microscopic nature of
the DNA molecule itself. However, the
question that has puzzled everyone
concerned is the origin of this process,



because all enzymes are proteins and
protein synthesis must be directed by
DNA. Yet, DNA replication cannot take
place without these proteins. So, what
came first – the protein or the DNA?
The problem goes right back to the
origin of all life. But it is a problem that
appears to have no answer. What is
certain is that amino acids, nucleotides,
lipids and other multi-atom molecules
can be manufactured at random by
heat, for example from lightning strikes.
They can also come about from



sunlight and other sources of energy
that don’t themselves have life. Many
ideas have been put forward to explain
the occurrence of DNA but none of
them can be more than educated
guesses.
But as we were researching this
book a new theory appeared, and it is
one that has gained favour with many
experts. This theory suggests that DNA
exists thanks to the presence of Earth’s
Moon!
Four billion years ago, the orbit of



the Moon was much closer to the Earth
than it is today. At this time, the Earth
was spinning much faster on its axis
and phenomenal tides were being raised
on the Earth, by the constant passing of
the Moon. With the Moon so much
closer to Earth the height of the tides
would have been colossal (see chapter
5).
Richard Lathe, a molecular
biologist at Pieta Research in Edinburgh,
has suggested that within the
primordial oceans, constantly dragged



back and forth by the passing of the
Moon, DNA could have been rapidly
multiplied. 28
One of the most commonly held
theories regarding the origin of DNA is
that it emerged when smaller, precursor
molecules in the waters of the early
oceans – ‘primeval soup’ – came
together or were ‘polymerized’ into long
strands. These long strands, it is
suggested, became the templates for
more molecules to attach themselves
along the templates, which eventually



resulted in double-stranded molecules
like DNA.
Richard Lathe suggests that the
problem lies in the need for some
mechanism that would constantly break
apart the double strands, in order to
keep the process going. He maintains it
would have taken some external force to
dissociate the two strands.
It is at around 50°C that single
DNA strands act as templates for
synthesizing complementary strands,
whereas at the higher temperature of



about 100°C, these double strands break
apart and this doubles the number of
molecules. When the temperature falls,
the process begins again. The number
of replications grows exponentially with
just forty cycles producing a trillion
identical copies.
A billion years after the Moon
came to orbit the Earth, it was extremely
close to its host planet and the Earth
was spinning much faster than it is
now. The tides, as Lathe suggests, must
have extended several hundred



kilometres inland, which meant that
coastal areas were subjected to rapid
changes in salinity and this would have
led to repeated and very frequent
association and dissociation of double
stranded molecules similar to those of
DNA.
As the huge tides advanced, salt
concentrations would have been very
low. Even modern double-stranded
DNA breaks apart under such
conditions, because electrically charged
phosphate groups on each strand repel



each other. However, when the tides
receded, precursor molecules and
precipitated salt would have been
present in high concentrations. Lathe
claims that this would have encouraged
DNA-like double-stranded molecules to
form, because high salt concentrations
neutralize DNA’s phosphate charges
and this allows strands to stick together.
It is these constant salty cycles and
changes in temperature that, Lathe says,
would have amplified molecules such as
DNA but he points out that the tidal



forces were absolutely vital in the
process. Whilst it is true that the Sun
also creates tides on the Earth, these are
of a very low magnitude compared to
those caused by the much closer Moon.
Three billion years ago it was closer still.
Without DNA there could be no
life because it stands at the very heart of
the replication of living matter. From
the single-celled amoeba to the largest
blue whale on our planet, DNA is the
vital component that began life and
which keeps it going. Perhaps Richard



Lathe is correct and it was the presence
of so large a Moon that began the
chemical process that led to us, but it
does remain a fact that despite all the
theories, no scientist has yet managed to
take the various chemicals that
comprise life and arrange them in such
a way that they become even the very
simplest life form.
Lathe’s theory could explain how
the Moon caused the early replication of
DNA but its origin remains a complete
mystery, and many scientists are quite



unsettled about the theory of how life
came into existence in the first place.
For example, David A Kaufmann PhD,
of the University of Florida said,
‘Evolution lacks a scientifically
acceptable explanation of the source of
the precisely planned codes within cells
without which there can be no specific
proteins and hence, no life.’
Admittedly David Kaufmann is a
creationist, so maybe we can expect him
to come to this conclusion. But then
there is Professor Hubert P Yockey, a



physicist from the University of
California – who is most definitely not
an adherent of creation and is
concerned that discredited ideas
continue to clog up the process of
seeking out the truth. He wrote:
‘Although at the
beginning the
paradigm was
worth
consideration, now
the entire effort in
the primeval soup



paradigm is self
deception on the
ideology of its
cham pions...
The history of
science shows that a
paradigm, once it
has achieved the
status of acceptance
(and is incorporated
in textbooks) and
regardless of its
failures, is declared
invalid only when a



new paradigm is
available to replace
it. Nevertheless, in
order to make
progress in science,
it is necessary to
clear the decks, so
to speak, of failed
paradigms. This
must be done even
if this leaves the
decks entirely clear
and no paradigms
survive. It is a



characteristic of the
true believer in
religion, philosophy
and ideology that
he must have a set
of beliefs, come
what may (Hoffer,
1951). Belief in a
primeval soup on
the grounds that no
other paradigm is
available is an
example of the
logical fallacy of the



false alternative. In
science it is a virtue
to acknowledge
ignorance. This has
been universally the
case in the history
of science as Kuhn
(1970) has
discussed in detail.
There is no reason
that this should be
different in the
research on the
origin of life.’ 29



Yockey makes this statement because,
like many other scientists, he cannot
believe that the question regarding the
emergence of life can be answered at all
well by the primeval soup theory. Like
the Double Whack theory of the
Moon’s birth – it is simply wrong and
obfuscating progress to a workable
explanation.
The main reason there is so much
unrest about this question is because
DNA cannot exist without life, and life
cannot exist without DNA. The two are



totally interdependent and create a
chicken-and- egg situation that seems
impossible to resolve.
It occurs to us that even the
theories of Richard Lathe, on the way
the Moon may have contributed to the
rapid spreading of life through huge
tides and chemical mixing, come no
closer to explaining how life actually
came about.
Some experts still claim that it
must have happened by accident,
presumably because the other



possibilities are too hard to swallow.
However, it would be far more sensible
to claim that fairies from Neverland did
it.



The Probability Problem
Nobody doubts that the information
contained in a single gene must be at
least as great as the enzyme it controls.
However, just one average protein
contains over 300 amino acids. In order
to create the protein it would take a
gene of DNA that would have to
contain 1,000 nucleotides in its chain.
Every DNA chain contains four sorts of
nucleotide. This seems complicated but
it results in a possible 4 x 101000 possible
forms. For those who do not realize, 4 x



101000 represents the number 4 followed
by 1,000 zeros.
These are values beyond all
comprehension. To get some
perspective on this, it is interesting to
note that it is estimated that there are
only 10 x 1080 particles in the whole
Universe. One begins to realize how
utterly impossible it would have been
for complex DNA to be accidentally
created in the primeval soup of the
young Earth.
In the world of probability, some



things are very likely to happen, others
might sometimes happen but some can
never happen at all. An expert in
probability, Emile Borel (1871–1956)
claimed that phenomena with very
small probability don’t occur. He
estimated that there would be about one
chance in 10 x 1050 for a small
probability. Minute though these odds
were, they weren’t remote enough for
more modern experts in probability.
William M Dembski, associate research
professor in the conceptual foundations
of science at Baylor University and a



senior fellow with Discovery Institute’s
Center for Science and Culture in
Seattle, decided to go further. He
estimated that there were 10 x 1080
particles in the Universe and wondered
how many times per second an event
might occur. The number he came up
with was 10 x 1045. He then calculated
the number of seconds from the
beginning of the Universe to the present
time and then, to make sure he was
erring on the side of caution, he
multiplied this number by one billion
and arrived at the number 10 x 1025



seconds. He now multiplied all the
figures together achieving a result of 10
x 10150 for his Law of Small
Probability.30
For a minimum living cell there
are 60,000 proteins of 150
c o n f i g u r a t i o n s . 31 Joseph A
Mastropaolo, an expert who has tackled
this problem at length, estimates that
the probability of the evolution of this
first cell would be an absolutely
staggering 1 in 10 x 104,478,296 or 10
followed by 4,478,296 zeros. This



exceeds Dembski’s estimation for Small
Probability by such a great margin that
were it not for the fact that DNA does
clearly exist, no self-respecting scientist
could uphold the possibility of it having
originated by chance.
If every particle in the Universe
had one chance for every second since
the beginning of time – we still would
not have DNA.
In case there are readers who doubt
Mastropaolo’s scepticism regarding the
possibility of DNA creating itself from



scratch, it is interesting to see that he is
far from alone. Peter T Mora of
Macromolecular Biology Section,
Immunology Program, National
Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland
wrote: ‘The presence of a living unit is
exactly opposite to what we would
expect on the basis of pure statistical
and probability considerations.’32
The English scientist J D Bernal
said, way back in 1965: ‘The answer
would seem to me, combined with the
knowledge that life is actually there, to



lead to the conclusion that some
sequences other than chance
occurrences must have led to the
appearance of life as we know it.’33
And to add to the list of dissenters
regarding a theory that clearly doesn’t
hold water, primeval or not, we have
the opinion of the late Professor Sir
Fred Hoyle, one of the most respected
astronomers who has ever lived. ‘Rather
than accept that fantastically small
probability of life having arisen through
the blind forces of nature, it seemed



better to suppose that the origin of life
was a deliberate intellectual act. By
“better” I mean less likely to be
wrong.’34
However, no matter how great and
how many the howls of indignation at
this complete disregard of probability,
one of the fundamental tools of science,
it remains a fact that DNA did occur
somehow. As the saying goes, nature
abhors a vacuum of any sort. No matter
how much Professor Yockey may
suggest that if we have no viable theory



we should exist without it until one is
discovered, it seems that to many
scientists a twisted and broken
paradigm is better than none at all.
After all, the alternative might be
unthinkable to most experts. We might,
for example, have to consider the
possibility of a ‘mind’ behind the
creation of DNA, even if we can accept
evolution as a viable theory once DNA
existed.
The majority of scientists would
prefer to break their own rules rather



than to evoke the deity, but even
Professor Sir Fred Hoyle was left with
the only conclusion that could occur to
him, namely that the Universe was
under some sort of ‘intelligent cosmic
control’.35 Is this the way forward? If we
are going to be truly honest, bearing in
mind the utter impossibility of the
chance occurrence of DNA, might we
have to accept that ‘God spoke and it
was so’?
Who can blame Anthony Flew for
turning a lifetime’s work on its head



and saying: ‘A super-intelligence is the
only good explanation for the origin of
life and the complexity of nature.’
However, Flew’s definition of God
bears little resemblance to the deity of
Judeo-Christian-Islamic tradition,
which he describes as being depicted as
‘omnipotent Oriental despots – cosmic
Saddam Husseins’. He is actually
describing something as open as our
own ‘Unknown Creative Agency’
which presumably might mean
virtually anything from a sublime single



entity to a galactic federation of planet
seeders!



The Seeds of Life
Some sixty years ago, when quantum
theory first emerged, physicists thought
the mystery of life was about to be
resolved. By looking at the tiniest
building blocks of matter it was starting
to explain how everything worked – so it
surely would also explain the essence
that we call life. They were to be
disappointed, but recent developments
have raised the hopes of some scientists
that the nature of first life might be
explained by new levels of



understanding about sub atomic
behaviour in biology.
In 2004, these new ideas caused
NASA to convene a workshop of
leading scientists to discuss the subject
of ‘quantum life’ at their astrobiology
laboratory in Ames, California, where
discussion covered fields such as
nanotechnology and quantum
com putation.
Nanotechnology is concerned with the
manufacture of artefacts or machines
that are assembled on an atom-by



atom basis. A nanometre is an almost
unbelievably small unit of length. A
human hair is typically about one
10,000th of a metre in diameter and a
common cold virus is approximately
one thousandth of this size. A typical
protein unit making up the coating of
such a virus is typically ten nanometres
thick – equivalent to about 100 atomic
diameters, or the size of one of the
amino acid groups making up that
protein molecule.
A whole new world of technology is



envisaged from building self-replicating
machines that could, for instance, carry
out surgery at a cellular level inside the
human body. However, an increasing
number of scientists are suggesting that
nature may have used this idea a long
time ago. As Professor Paul Davies has
pointed out, the living cell is full of
nanomachines designed and refined by
biological evolution. And he posed the
question: ‘Could it be that some of
them acquired their amazing properties
by deploying fancy quantum tricks?’36
He says: ‘One vital part of a cell’s



reproductive machinery is a little
motor, called a polymerase enzyme,
which crawls along unzipped strands of
DNA and forges the links that match
up the unpaired nucleotide bases with
complementary bases floating through
its environment.’
Apoorva Patel of the Indian
Institute of Science, believes that living
cells may use quantum mechanics to
boost their information-processing
efficiency, which could explain why the
genetic code is the way it is, and why it



is found in all organisms. As Davies
points out, quantum theory describes
atoms and molecules as waves, which
can overlap and combine coherently
known as superposition. This means
that the normal rules of time/space do
not apply and an atom can exist in a
superposition of excited and unexcited
states, or of states corresponding to
several spatial locations at the same
time. These superpositions are expected
to be the basis of quantum computers
that will be able to hunt for a target
among a jumble of data. This is said to



be equivalent to finding a name in a
telephone directory when you know
only the phone number.
The role of quantum theory in the
origin of life is not yet clear. But it
seems that the new technologies that
humankind is now investigating may be
at the root of life itself. Paul Davies
acknowledges that life somehow
emerged from the ferment of the
quantum molecular world, and he
adds:
‘The role of



quantum processes
in living matter is
still unclear. It is
entirely possible
that quantum
mechanics was the
midwife of life, but
has played an
insignificant role
since... All scientists
agree that life
somehow emerged
from the ferment of
the quantum



molecular world.
The key issue is on
which side of the
quantum -classical
divide the transition
to life occurred.
Niels Bohr once
said that anyone
who is not shocked
by quantum
mechanics hasn’t
understood it. I
believe that anyone
who is not shocked



by life hasn’t
understood it. The
question before us is
whether quantum
mechanics is
shocking enough to
explain life.’
It seems to us that whoever seeded life
on our planet, all those billions of years
ago, was using a form of self-replicating
‘technology’ which will eventually come
to be understood. And we might not be
that far from that understanding now.



Who Built the Moon?
At this point we are as sure as we
possibly can be that the following
statements are true:
1. The Moon is
approximately 4.6 billion
years old.
2. The Earth is
approximately 4.6 billion
years old.
3. The Moon was



manufactured from
lighter materials taken
from the young Earth.
4. The Moon was made as
an incubator to foster life
on Earth.
5. The manufacturer of the
Moon seeded life on
Earth.
6. Evolution as described by
Darwin is broadly
accurate.



The manufacturer of the Moon left
deliberate messages, intended to be read
by humans at this point in geological
time, to draw attention to what they
have done.
It appears reasonable to assume
that the manufacturer of the Moon (the
UCA) has a good reason for wanting
humans to understand what was done.
The UCA could have seeded life and
moved on, if its motive was pure
altruism. It therefore seems that it is
important to work out who built the



Moon.
It seems certain that we have only
identified the first ‘introduction’ aspect
of the message from the UCA. The
details of the message are likely to hold
the key to the next phase of human
development: information that will
change our destiny forever.
We believe that we have succeeded
in identifying the key numbers that will
be used in deeper layers of the detailed
communication. We trust that others
will take up the challenge of interpreting



other aspects of the message, but our
immediate task is to try and work out
who built the Moon.
And we believe there are only three
possibilities.



‘And God made two great
lights; the greater light to rule
the day, and the lesser light to
rule the night: he made the
stars also.’
Genesis 1:16, The King James Bible



Good things and terrible things have
always happened to mortal man. The
warmth of spring, the survival of
infants, the provision of animals to
hunt, plants to harvest and freedom
from disease must surely be the work of
an unseen force with powers far beyond
than that of mere people. So too, the ills
and woes of failed crops, floods and
death wrought upon whole tribes by war
and desperate want. It must be the will
of the gods.
Thank the gods, fear the gods,



appease the gods.
Religion is as old as the stories that
humans first told. From the early Stone
Age to the Internet Age, humankind
appears to need the power of deities that
inhabit an unseen world and yet have
the power to affect the lives we live. The
greatest love and the greatest hate spill
forth in the name of gods.
Today, the great religions of the
world tend to describe the gods in the
singular as God, even though they all
refer to many aspects under different



nam es.
The Hindu tradition has ideas that
are increasingly seen as corresponding
with modern science. It perceives the
existence of the cyclical nature of the
Universe and everything within it, where
the cosmos follows one cycle within a
framework of larger cycles. The
Universe has been created and reached
an end, but it represents only one turn
in the perpetual ‘wheel of time’, which
revolves infinitely through successive
cycles of creation and destruction. This



cycle of creation and destruction of the
Universe could be seen as a series of Big
Bangs and Big Crunches, where all
matter explodes outwards from
nowhere and then recedes back again.
Within these gigantic cycles the soul also
undergoes its own cycle, called samsara
– where death and rebirth sees the same
souls repeatedly reincarnated.
Meanwhile, Christianity is a broad
church indeed, covering an incredible
span of beliefs. At one end of the
spectrum there are many scientific



thinkers – including at least two Fellows
of the Royal Society. One of them, John
Polkinghorne, was a mathematical
physicist before resigning his position as
a professor at Cambridge University in
1979 to be ordained as priest in the
Church of England. Polkinghorne has
since devoted his life to exploring the
connections between science and
theology, describing the Universe as
open and flexible – a place where
patterns seem to exist and where he says
the ‘providential aspect’ cannot be ruled
out.



Many Christians fully support
science and have no problem with
evolution, quantum mechanics or the
big bang origin of the Universe. For
them it is simply a question of the
authorship of the blueprint that
obviously exists. The designer of all this
is their God. And yet they also believe in
an event that others would find
incredible. Without wishing to be
disrespectful, we would précis that event
as follows: The initial intellect that
created everything became a man and
died, nailed to a wooden post, some two



thousand years ago, before briefly
returning to human life and then
transferring back to His ethereal state
somewhere outside of the physical
world. This anthropoid interlude for
this creator deity (many billions of years
after the start of the Universe) is
believed to compensate for the bad
behaviour of those people who accept
this story as real, thereby ensuring a
pleasant continuation of consciousness
after their physical body has ceased to
be alive.



At the other end of the Christian
belief are the creationists. They hold
that a collection of ancient Canaanite
and Mesopotamian myths, from at
least three separate traditions and first
written down in the sixth century BC by
Jewish priests, are a literal account of
how the world came into being. They
take an uncomplicated view of life and
consider that all species are unchanging
and derive their forms from an
unchanging, divine blueprint. To a
creationist a rose is a rose is a rose, and
it is foolish to think that a rose bush



could become a daffodil, or an apple
tree. They see God’s plan as timeless
and unchanging, with separate types of
plants and animals that have nothing to
connect them. For them the world and
everything within it was created in six
days of a single week, somewhere
around 4004 BC.
It is of central importance to
creationists that there is an absolute
divide between humans and other
animals. They often use the phrase
‘don’t let them make a monkey out of



you’ in the mistaken belief that
evolutionists claim that humans
developed from monkeys.
Buddhist philosophy is
evolutionary and in many ways agrees
with mainstream scientists. Buddha
taught that all things are impermanent,
constantly arising, becoming, changing
and fading. Buddhist philosophers
consequently rejected the Platonic idea
of production from ‘ideal forms’ as
being the fallacy of ‘production from
inherently existent other’. According to



most schools of Buddhism there is
nothing whatsoever that is inherently or
independently existent.
Buddhist philosophers have always
accepted that the Universe is billions of
years old and they have no
corresponding creation myth to that of
the Judaeo-Christian tradition. Unlike
creationists, Buddhists believe that both
humans and animals possess sentient
minds that survive death.
There are many people today who
are agnostic, meaning that they do not



see any proof of God but neither do
they believe it to be impossible that
there could be a God. Perhaps a small
minority of the world are true atheists
believing that all matter, including their
own self-awareness, is merely the
culmination of multiple accidents
occurring at random within the basic
laws of physics.
The classical argument for God
has been that there must have been a
‘first cause’ but this is considered to be
invalid by relatively modern



philosophers such as David Hume and
Immanuel Kant, because the thesis is
negated by its own premise. If
everything must have a first cause then
what made God? It therefore follows
that the Universe could arrive
spontaneously just as much as God
could.
But, it occurs to us, what if God
and the essence of the Universe were,
and are, the same thing?



God in Contact
Human societies have probably always
developed the idea that the world they
see around them must have a conscious
mind behind it. And the Judaeo
Christian tradition holds that God has
had quite regular contact, particularly
with His chosen people, from Adam
through characters such as Enoch,
Noah, Abraham, Moses, Ezekiel, Isaiah
and John the Baptist (Jesus Christ
cannot count because that would be
God talking to Himself). Following the



crucifixion of Jesus, God, or members
of His ethereal team, are believed to
have had contact with inspired
individuals from St Paul to Joan of Arc,
and there have been many miraculous
appearances at locations such as
Lourdes in France, Fatima in Portugal
and Knock in Ireland.
These visitations are held to be
wonderful by believers and considered
baloney by others. Apart from the
apparent miracle of existence itself, all
other aspects of God require faith. Faith



could be described as intellectual belief
that transcends normal standards of
proof. In other words, the individual
with faith holds things to be true that
are not evidenced in a form that
rational science would accept.
But what would happen if God
suddenly turned up in an unambiguous
way; if the creator of the Universe
appeared, in person, on the Earth with
positive proof of identity?
Logic says it could not happen
because it is likely that only the



agnostics would be happy. Those who
would be most likely to welcome the
coming of God are, by definition, the
people with the most complex belief
systems. And every group (possibly
except one) would be disappointed.
Would Mormons be told they had it
right after all or maybe Roman
Catholics?; or maybe some followers of
Mohammad or Siddhartha Gautama
or any one of the countless prophets
down the ages.
Imagine the Pope and the Dalai



Lama sitting shaking their heads in
disbelief as it turns out that the
Australian Aboriginal people and those
of the Japanese Shinto faith both had it
right when they called God Izanagi.
Surely, it would have to be those with
the most religion who would have the
most to lose.
But then, it is not likely that they
are all correct in some way and that
God is actually non-denominational.
What if He now considers that the
childhood of the human race is over



and we are now grown up enough to be
told the true mysteries of existence – he
might choose to make gentle contact to
let us know that in some way ‘we had
arrived’.
It is our initial thought that the
number patterns built into the Moon
and its relationship with Earth, could be
a first global contact with God Himself.
Such an event would change everything.
If God formally made his presence
known, who would dare wage a war in
His name? The world might listen



carefully instead of proclaiming its right
to speak on His behalf from the
churches, synagogues, mosques and
temples around the globe.
What evidence is there that this
message could be from God?
The first problem is one of
definition. What do we mean when we
speak of God? For recent convert,
Anthony Flew, God is simply the
creative force that does not interact with
people, but for many millions of others
He is a benign father figure who listens



to their prayers.
Upon reflection, the only way to
deal with this point is to ignore it. If the
human species has reached the end of
its ‘childhood’, the nature of God will
be appreciated in a new light anyway.
The most fundamental case for the
God scenario, when it comes to the
message the Moon has to impart to us
about its artificial construction, is that
any entity who created our world is
God, almost by definition. Scriptures
from all around the world attribute the



making of our planet and the heavens
to a creative force that usually has a
special relationship with humankind.
That relationship is so special in
Christianity that it is central to the very
belief system that the creator of our
world actually became a man for thirty
three years some two millennia ago.
The fact that the numbers used in
the Moon’s message are in base ten,
implies that the UCA knew that the
intelligent species that would evolve on
Earth would have ten fingers. God



would know that. It is also clearly the
case that the UCA knew that it would be
at this particular point in the Earth’s
history that humans would be ready for
the next stage of their relationship with
God.
The story told in the Book of
Genesis in the Old Testament would
turn out to be remarkably correct and
even the Christian creationists would be
right in part.
‘In the beginning
God created the



heaven and the
earth.’
In this scenario, God did create the
Earth and the heavens, and by
regulating its attitude with the Moon
caused it to have liquid water on its
surface:
‘And the earth was
without form, and
void; and darkness
was upon the face
of the deep. And
the Spirit of God



moved upon the
face of the waters.’
In its early years the Moon was orbiting
close to the Earth, gradually slowing
down both its own spin and producing
a spin that gave regular days and nights:
‘And God said, Let
there be light: and
there was light.And
God saw the light,
that it was good:
and God divided
the light from the



darkness. And God
called the light Day,
and the darkness he
called Night. And
the evening and the
morning were the
first day.
And let them be for
lights in the
firmament of the
heaven to give light
upon the earth: and
it was so. And God
made two great



lights; the greater
light to rule the day,
and the lesser light
to rule the night: he
made the stars also.’
The tilt of the Earth was held steady by
the Moon and the Earth enjoyed regular
days, years and changing seasons:
‘And God said, Let
there be lights in the
firmament of the
heaven to divide the
day from the night;



and let them be for
signs, and for
seasons, and for
days, and years.’
The early Moon was huge and powerful
as it orbited close to the Earth raising
colossal tides every time it passed
overhead. If the Moon had not been
created, the seas of the Earth would
cover virtually all of the planet leaving
little dry land:
‘And God said, Let
there be a



firmament in the
midst of the waters,
and let it divide the
waters from the
waters. And God
made the
firmament, and
divided the waters
which were under
the firmament
from the waters
which were above
the firmament: and
it was so.’



Thanks to its close proximity, the
Moon’s tidal surges travelled far inland,
constantly stirring the life-nurturing
soup of the oceans, ready for the
moment life arrived. As more advanced
life developed, plant life came first:
‘And God said, Let
the earth bring forth
grass, the herb
yielding seed, and
the fruit tree
yielding fruit after
his kind, whose seed



is in itself, upon the
earth: and it was so.
And the earth
brought forth grass,
and herb yielding
seed after his kind,
and the tree yielding
fruit, whose seed
was in itself, after
his kind: and God
saw that it was
good.’
The first animal life began in the oceans



before spreading to land and into the
air:
‘And God said, Let
the waters bring
forth abundantly
the moving creature
that hath life, and
fowl that may fly
above the earth in
the open firmament
of heaven. And God
created great
whales, and every



living creature that
moveth, which the
waters brought
forth abundantly,
after their kind, and
every winged fowl
after his kind: and
God saw that it was
good.
And God blessed
them, saying, Be
fruitful, and
multiply, and fill
the waters in the



seas, and let fowl
multiply in the
earth. And God
said, Let the earth
bring forth the
living creature after
his kind, cattle, and
creeping thing, and
beast of the earth
after his kind: and it
was so. And God
made the beast of
the earth after his
kind, and cattle



after their kind, and
every thing that
creepeth upon the
earth after his kind:
and God saw that it
was good.’
Millions and millions of creatures came
and went, slowly changing into more
complex life forms and eventually
gaining intelligence and self-awareness.
One branch of mammals climbed into
the trees and later returned to the plains
as hominids – our ancient, ape-like



ancestors. There were many species of
hominid that learned to use primitive
tools and that survived as hunter
gatherers. As recently as 25,000 years
ago there were still three species of
h u m a n : Homo floresienis, Homo
neanderthalis and Homo sapiens. The
Neanderthals had larger brains than
ours and we can be sure that they
laughed and talked and cried – their
burial practices even suggest that they
may have had religious belief. But
today, we are alone:



‘And God said, Let
us make man in
our image, after our
likeness: and let
them have
dominion over the
fish of the sea, and
over the fowl of the
air, and over the
cattle, and over all
the earth, and over
every creeping thing
that creepeth upon
the earth. So God



created man in his
own image, in the
image of God
created he him;
male and female
created he them.
And God blessed
them, and God said
unto them, Be
fruitful, and
multiply, and
replenish the earth,
and subdue it: and
have dominion over



the fish of the sea,
and over the fowl of
the air, and over
every living thing
that moveth upon
the earth.’
The period during which we have
learned to walk upright and have
developed such large brains that our
Mothers risk their lives in giving birth to
us, is miniscule in terms of the period
the Earth has existed. It has taken us
only a couple of million years in total.



The amount of time we have been
bright enough to look with knowing
eyes at our world has been much less
than that, merely a few tens of
thousands of years. We learned how to
hunt and to survive from the bounty of
nature and eventually we became
farmers, living fixed lives and
establishing villages that became towns
and eventually cities.
Maybe six or seven thousand years
ago something remarkable may have
happened. Whoever or whatever had



manufactured the Moon returned. In
an operation that possibly involved a
whole series of ‘visits’, the cipher
necessary to crack the code of the
message, that had been so carefully
encapsulated into the Moon, was given
to humanity. This ‘key’ was the
Megalithic system of measurement and
geometry and specifically the Megalithic
Yard. The Moon’s creator must have
been aware that if the Megalithic Yard
was written into the stone circles and
avenues of what is now Britain and
France, someone would eventually



recover the information and rebuild the
entire system in all its splendour.
This was clearly not enough.
Another series of visitations took place,
not long after the first but this time to
another proto-civilization far from the
first, between the rivers Tigress and
Euphrates, in what is today the area
known as Iraq. Here a second system of
mathematics and geometry was seeded,
this one less related to the mathematical
certainties of the Earth and its
relationship with the Moon but more



closely tied to everyday life. It was the
forerunner of much that was to follow
and when the rise of science came
along, humanity invented the metric
system, which almost eerily reflected
what the Sumerians had been so
carefully taught. The astronomer priests
of Sumer were shown that the whole
world, its size, mass and volume, could
be derived from the most humble
source possible – a single seed of barley.
(See Appendix Five.) This plant had
clearly been genetically engineered not
only to be of fantastic use to humanity



but also to lock into the dimensions and
mass of the Earth in an almost
unbelievable way.
Mythology and folklore tells us
time and again that ‘messengers’ were
sent in the remote past to teach
humanity the rudiments of civilization
and we now know why. None of this is
beyond the capabilities of God and it is
likely that a percentage of readers will
already be convinced that this must be
the solution to the message contained in
the Moon.



God could quite easily have created
the Moon and done so well within the
laws of physics He had ordained. It
would have been His deliberate
intention that the life He seeded on the
young Earth would eventually give birth
to a thinking, rational species that was,
in some way, made in His own image.
His interest in humanity, when it
eventually evolved, remained as He had
quite clearly intended. We can see a
situation in which the Deity sent
messengers to lay the foundations of an
eventual recognition of the message



which would lead to the first tangible
proof of the existence of a Creator.
Nothing is beyond the mind or
capability of God. We have endowed
Him with unparalleled power and
timelessness. But for countless
generations the reality of God has
resided in ‘faith’ rather than ‘proof’.
Perhaps those with religion will resent
the suggestion that God has removed
the need for faith.
The humorous and thought
provoking writer, the late Douglas



Adams, played with this notion in his
b o o k The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the
Galaxy.37 Adams created a remarkable
creature known as the Babel Fish, that
when placed in anyone’s ear could act
as an inter-galactic speech translator. So
remarkable was the existence of this
little fish that people said it must stand
as irrevocable proof of the existence of
God because nothing so amazing could
possibly come about by chance.
However, it was pointed out that since
God existed by faith alone – and not by
proof – the absolute proof of his



existence meant for certain that he
could not exist.
‘I never thought of
that,’ said God, and
disappeared in a
puff of logic.’
It is clear that if we accept that God was
responsible for creating the Moon and
that He specifically incorporated within
it proof of what He had done, we must
begin to look at Him in a very different
light. In a world in which religion has
been diminishing in importance, and



particularly in the technological West,
an acceptance of God’s direct
intervention in our part of the solar
system might see thousands or millions
of people flocking back to Church. The
most fervent creationists may abandon
their insistence that the Earth is only a
few thousand years old and might
accept that God did indeed work his
magic through evolution. The
recognition of God’s special pact with
life, and especially with humanity,
might fund a push towards
ecumenicism and a coming together of



the world’s fractious religions.
Unfortunately it is equally likely
that the reverse would happen because
power-bases, religious or secular, have
always shown a reluctance to diminish
in importance. Clearly, if we are looking
at God’s true covenant with humanity
through his intentional creation of the
Moon, with its attendant and obviously
deliberate messages, no existing belief
pattern can be any more important
than another and the whole basis of
religious dogma is in doubt.



We could not criticize anyone who
wishes to attribute the message to God.
But neither could we argue with anyone
who says that God does not need to
leave messages coded into ancient stone
circles that He already knows will
eventually be recognized by humanity.
If we are ultimately left in no doubt as
to his existence, the whole procedure has
been somewhat unnecessary. God is
capable of showing Himself to
humanity at any time He chooses, with
absolutely no ambiguity or the remotest
uncertainty.



Everything about the Moon and its
addition to the solar system seems to
speak of a message that ‘must’ be
imparted one day and of a series of
deliberate ‘humanlike’ interventions
that would ensure this was the case.
Further to this, we might argue
that the Moon was almost certainly
added to our part of the solar system as
an afterthought. It had to be, because
the very material from which it was
made came from the already existent
Earth. God could quite easily have



made the Earth a haven for life in its
own right. It has to be remembered that
it was the ‘shortcomings’ of the Earth
that necessitated the addition of the
Moon to the planetary system. Surely
the God of the human imagination is
all-powerful and has no shortcomings.
We cannot deny that a world in
which humanity was certain of the
existence of God, and in which there
was no longer any doubt about what He
represented, ‘might’ become a more
cohesive and peaceful place and we did



not turn away from this possibility
lightly. However, we have tried to
approach our research from a genuinely
scientific point of view (we would argue
that our approach is more scientific and
less based on enshrined belief than that
of many so-called scientists.) This being
said, we felt ourselves obliged to look at
other possible solutions to the questions
raised by the evidence we had amassed.
Those who wish to attribute the creation
of the Earth– Moon system to God will
continue do so, though we felt it
impossible to stop searching. We are



cognisant that by His sheer timeless
power God can be used as a cure-all to
answer any question. That has been the
pattern of humanity across the ages and
it is not one we feel constrained to
follow.
In short, there are other
possibilities that might prove to be just
as surprising but considerably more
plausible.



Postscript to this chapter
This chapter was completed during the
closing days of 2004. On the morning
of Sunday December 26th an
Earthquake five miles beneath the ocean
floor, west of Sumatra, produced a
tsunami with the power of more than
10,000 atomic bombs. Travelling at
speeds of up to 800 kilometres an hour
it tore into coastal areas all around the
Indian Ocean causing devastation that
was as sudden as it was terrible. Many
tens of thousands of people died within



minutes and millions more were left to
grieve for their lost loved ones and to
struggle against hunger, thirst and the
threat of consequential disease.
The event was so powerful that the
entire Earth moved.
Geologist Kerry Sieh of the
California Institute of Technology said
‘It caused the planet to wobble a little
bit.’ As the Indian Ocean’s heavy
tectonic plate lurched underneath the
Indonesian plate there was a shift of
mass towards the planet’s centre,



causing the globe to rotate faster and
shortening the period of our planet’s
rotation by some three microseconds. A
team of researchers at NASA’s Jet
Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena,
California also found that the incident
caused the Earth’s tilt to be increased by
2.5cm .
The mobility of the Earth’s crust
was central to the emergence of life and
now the residual shifting of tectonic
plates causes death and destruction to
those too near to the event. If the careful



design of the Earth and its Moon were
the work of God, His life-bringing
mechanisms are, in this instance at
least, working against the interests of
His chosen species.
The events in the Indian Ocean
horrified the world. In Britain the
Archbishop of Canterbury, who leads
the Church of England, was deeply
troubled. Dr Rowan Williams, writing
eight days later in the Sunday Telegraph
questioned the nature of God’s
interaction with humans:



‘The question:
“How can you
believe in a God
who permits
suffering on this
scale?” is therefore
very much around
at the moment, and
it would be
surprising if it
weren’t – indeed, it
would be wrong if it
weren’t. The
traditional answers



will get us only so
far. God, we are
told, is not a
puppet-master in
regard either to
human actions or
to the processes of
the world. If we are
to exist in an
environment where
we can live lives of
productive work
and consistent
understanding



human lives as we
know them – the
world has to have a
regular order and
pattern of its own.
Effects follow causes
in a way that we can
chart, and so can
make some attempt
at coping with. So
there is something
odd about expecting
that God will
constantly step in if



things are getting
dangerous. How
dangerous do they
have to be? How
many deaths would
be acceptable?
So why do religious
believers pray for
God’s help or
healing? They ask
for God’s action to
come in to a
situation and
change it, yes; but if



they are honest,
they don’t see
prayer as a plea for
magical solutions
that will make the
world totally safe
for them and
others.
All this is fair
enough, perhaps
true as far as it goes.
But it doesn’t go
very far in helping
us, one week on,



with the intolerable
grief and
devastation in front
of us. If some
religious genius did
come up with an
explanation of
exactly why all these
deaths made sense,
would we feel
happier or safer or
more confident in
God? Wouldn’t we
feel something of a



chill at the prospect
of a God who
deliberately plans a
programme that
involves a certain
level of casualties?’
If a single entity that we could
reasonably call God did indeed establish
the Earth and its Moon so that we
might evolve, He might be obliged to
work within His own rules of the
Universe. Creating a life-bearing planet
required a ploughing of the surface and



this is a process that cannot be switched
on and off like a light switch. Dr
Williams presumably has a problem
because he believes in a God who is in
on-going contact – a God who can
choose to respond to individual prayers.
But maybe the situation is not like that.
The title we chose for this chapter
is ‘Childhood’s End’. This seemed to be
a fitting summation for the discussion
of the possibility that God had made
the world and had, from the outset,
built into it a message that we would



understand when we were sufficiently
emotionally and intellectually mature.
We were aware that Arthur C Clarke
had written a novel with this title more
than half a century earlier with a very
different but not unconnected theme.
Sir Arthur is an inspired writer and
his ideas expressed in 2001: A Space
Odyssey, have been discussed in this
book. When we realized that the Indian
Ocean tsunami had caused a massive
loss of life in Sri Lanka, we were
concerned for him, because we were



aware that he is wheelchair bound in his
home near the beach in Colombo.
Thankfully Sir Arthur was not hurt and
was able to write an account of what
had happened in his adopted country.
He wrote: ‘I have no idea if God
had any scenario in mind when this
happened. In a way, the disaster was a
random event, but at the same time
nothing in this world is totally random,
there is always cause and effect.’
All of this could very much
describe a God who has a working plan



that appears to be less than perfect.
Tectonic plates were necessary to create
us but their current movements are
simply a small, incidental effect of a far
greater cause. Are we to believe that in
the mind of God the ultimate end
justifies the sometimes very painful
m eans?



‘...it’s entirely possible, in my
view, that we could retrieve a
message from another world
within just a few decades...’
Seth Shostak – Senior Astronomer, SETI
The idea that intelligent creatures might



exist somewhere else in the cosmos has
fascinated humanity ever since the
invention of the telescope revealed that
our world is but one amongst countless
others. At first some people wondered if
there were people living around the
supposed seas on the Moon and others
feared invasion from near neighbours,
particularly Mars.
In 1858 an Italian astronomer
called Secchi announced that he had
seen ‘canali’ on the surface of Mars, and
in 1877 Giovanni Virginio Schiaparelli,



an astronomer at the Milan
Observatory, produced drawings of
these features. Though the most
accurate translation of the Italian word
‘canali’ would have been ‘channels’, it
was translated into English as ‘canals’.
With the completion of the Suez Canal
fresh in people’s minds, the
interpretation was taken to mean that
huge artificial waterways had been
discovered – which amounted to
evidence of intelligent life.
Debate raged over the findings,



with Schiaparelli himself stating that
there was no reason to suppose that the
canals were artificial. The discovery
sparked the imagination of a young
man named Percival Lowell who was at
the beginning of what was to be a
distinguished career in astronomy. He
was one of the first to realize that it was
far more sensible to site observatories in
out-of -the-way places, such as deserts
or on mountaintops, where smoke and
light spillage from cities would not
diminish the astronomers view of the
heavens. He was the driving force



behind the creation of the Lowell
Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona, in
1894.
Professor Lowell studied linear
features on Mars with his twenty-four
inch telescope and developed theories
about the habitability of Mars, based on
his estimate that the planet had an
average temperature of 48°F. The
Lowell Observatory made consistent
observations of the Martian canals and
Lowell personally maintained that the
linear features were indeed of artificial



origin.
When spacecraft reached Mars,
scientists expected to discover what the
canals really were but they found that
there were no canals and almost no
straight lines on the planet at all. We
have to conclude that either the
Martians have camouflaged them
rather well over the last century or,
infinitely more likely, a generation of
astronomers were imagining things at
the limits of their optical telescopes.
The idea that there could be real



Martians was a popular worry that was
brilliantly used as the plot by H G Wells
in his novel War of the Worlds.
A wave of mass hysteria gripped
thousands of radio listeners in October
1938, when a dramatization of this
book was broadcast and led
unsuspecting listeners to believe that an
interplanetary conflict had started, with
invading Martians spreading death and
destruction across New Jersey and New
York.
The next day the New York Times



reported on the scare:
‘A weather report
was given,
prosaically. An
announcer
remarked that the
program would be
continued from a
hotel, with dance
music. For a few
moments a dance
program was given
in the usual



manner. Then there
was a “break-in”
with a “flash” about
a professor at an
observatory noting a
series of gas
explosions on the
planet Mars.
News bulletins and
scene broadcasts
followed, reporting,
with the technique
in which the radio
had reported actual



events, the landing
of a “meteor” near
Princeton N. J.,
“killing” 1,500
persons, the
discovery that the
“meteor” was a
“metal cylinder”
containing strange
creatures from Mars
armed with “death
rays” to open
hostilities against
the inhabitants of



the earth.’
By far the majority of experts now
accept that if advanced life of any sort
does exist in places other than the Earth,
we will almost certainly have to look
towards interstellar space in order to
find it. But our greater knowledge of
outer space has not quelled the public’s
appetite for close-encounter stories.
The famous Roswell incident is
believed by many to be an extra
terrestrial encounter. It is said that a
UFO crashed in the New Mexico desert



in July 1947 and the debris was
removed to an army base in Fort
Worth, Texas.
A US government cover-up is said
to have tried to pass off the event by
stating that the debris was actually part
of a radar unit from a weatherballoon.
Rumours about the existence of
secret alien bases located in various
places, such as the Moon, under the
ocean, or in a tropical rain forest have
persisted. Some people have gone so far
as to claim that they have worked on



secret UFO projects for the government
and seen UFOs at military installations.
According to a recent poll, some
three million Americans believe that
they have encountered bright lights and
incurred strange bodily marks indicative
of a possible encounter with aliens.
Psychological tests confirm that these
‘abductees’ are rarely psychotic or
mentally ill in any usual sense of the
term .
It makes us wonder whether
humans are simply prone to having



some kind of neural dysfunction
involving optical illusions. Maybe the
decline of old-style belief in mythical
creatures like fairies and goblins and in
religious imagery such as angels or the
Virgin Mary, has caused people to have
new kinds of hallucinations. Where
people once thought they saw the ‘little
people’ dancing in a circle of light or a
heavenly messenger with a glowing
halo, the bright lights in their heads are
now translated as alien contact.
Whilst the debate continues about



everything from Roswell to crop circles,
it has to be admitted that there has
never been any proof of alien contact
and it is, of course, impossible to prove
the negative. However, the probability of
contact does seem extremely small,
given the vast amounts of space and
time involved.
The solar system, of which the
Earth forms a small part, is only one of
many even in our own corner of our
galaxy – the Milky Way. Astronomers
have identified stars that definitely have



planets orbiting them, so the state of
affairs within our own solar system is
certainly not unique. An interesting
finding has been that larger, gaseous
planets in other star systems, much like
Jupiter and Saturn in our own, have
been discovered to have an orbit that is
always very close to their host star.
From these early indications it seems
that our planetary arrangement is
unique, which just might not be
accidental.
It is a fact that if Jupiter were not



just over five times more distant from
the Sun than we are, advanced life on
Earth would not exist. This giant planet
is positioned as a ‘catcher’ of space
objects that would otherwise impact
into the Earth. A dramatic example of
this was seen in July 1994, when twenty
one fragments of the comet
Shoemaker-Levy 9 smashed into Jupiter
at speeds of up to half a million
kilometres and hour, creating fireballs
larger than the planet Earth.
If we are right about the Moon



being constructed to act as an incubator,
the manufacturer would have been
pleased to note that Jupiter and Saturn
were in very unusual and perhaps
unique outer orbits. If it were not so,
they would have to have caused them to
be in this position – which would
suggest that the entire solar system
could have been designed for the benefit
of humankind!
Whether or not our solar system is
a happy accident, it is estimated that
there are a thousand million other stars



in our galaxy alone, any one of which
could possess a planetary system where
life might have evolved and even
flourished. Beyond our galaxy there
must be stars with Earth-like planets
beyond counting. Bearing these facts in
mind, it surely appears unreasonable to
believe that only our tiny little green
planet is alone in producing a self-aware
species.
However as we have previously
noticed, setting out to actually meet our
intergalactic or extragalactic cousins



seems hopeless, even if we knew where
they were located. But this may not be
the end of the story.
Time is not a fixed concept. If a
person could travel close to the speed of
light, they would experience a severe
slowdown in time, relative to a slower
moving object. At light speed, time
stops completely, relative to something
moving at a much lesser speed. Because
of this ‘time stop’, a photon that travels
at the speed of light would not
experience distance and time in the



normal way. So from the photon’s
point of view, it could go from one end
of the Universe to the other instantly,
while from an outside point of view it
would take about thirteen billion years.
Still stranger, scientists have found
the need to speculate about the existence
of a particle called a ‘tachyon’ that can
travel faster than light. But theoretically
at least, travelling faster than light
would result in an individual going
backwards in time. So the tachyon is
something of a mystery at the moment,



with scientists having to calculate the
activity of these particles with time
working in reverse.
So, just maybe, there will be ways
to work around the problem of
travelling at speeds close to, or even
above, the speed of light.
Next, there is the possibility of
intergalactic communication using what
physicists call ‘quantum entanglement’,
that can happen to sub atomic particles.
If quarks with identical spin are paired
and separated, and the spin of one is



changed, the other changes its spin
instantaneously to match that of its
partner – no matter how far apart they
are separated. Einstein called this
phenomenon ‘spooky distance’, and it
suggests that some force, not yet
understood, must be capable of
travelling in folded space in some
manner or may not exist at all in space
as we know it, and therefore not be
restricted to the effects of travel.
It is therefore not inconceivable
that other advanced creatures have



found a way to bridge the chasm of
space-time between their planet and
ours. But we are not able to deal with
such technology yet, even though we
can envisage its existence. Right now, as
far as we know, we cannot greet them
face to face, but as we pointed out in
Chapter Eight it might be possible to
listen to them or even talk to them.
As we have also noted, recent
publications by leading academics such
as Paul Davies, Christopher Rose and
Gregory Wright, are suggesting that



physical artefacts are a far better way of
communicating across the vastness of
space. Paul Davies has stated that a far
more reliable way for any alien species
to contact us would be to leave artefacts
in the vicinity of planets likely to spawn
intelligent life that, given sufficient
advancement on the part of such a
developing species, it could not fail to
recognize.
And so, the question that confronts
us is: Could aliens have built the Moon
from the very substance of the Earth in



order to allow our development, and
then left a physical message of what
they had done in the very dimensions
and movements of the bodies?
We believe that the message we
have detected in the Moon and its
relationship to the Earth is so amazingly
differentiated from the ‘background
noise’ of all other measurements that it
forms a breakthrough for humanity.
Certainly, if a message of such clarity
and consistency was received from
beyond our planet by means of good



old-fashioned electromagnetic
radiation, the personnel at SETI would
be jumping up and down with joy.
If the message from the UCA is
attributable to aliens we have already
speculated that its motive could simply
be a desire to progressively transform
the matter in the Universe from a
chaotic condition to an ordered state of
self-awareness. One can image that,
given enough time, all of the matter in
existence could be united in a single
thinking entity. Astronomer Royal, Sir



Fred Hoyle, wrote a novel called The
Black Cloud38 in which he speculated
about a cloud of space matter that had
such instantaneous interaction between
its particles it was, effectively, a single
living entity. Could this be the long
term goal for all intelligence? If so, we
will need to understand what has
happened in the case of our own planet
much more clearly so that we will be
able, in due course, to take part in this
ultimate mission for the Universe.
If we accept alien intervention in



our distant past, we have to ask how
these visitors from elsewhere could have
known that the fruits of their labours
would come to have ten fingers and
therefore work in base ten. A possible
answer is that all successful life forms
come to intellectual maturity with these
characteristics, but the whole notion
does seem odd.
Furthermore, there is the problem
of how the alien Moon builders came to
use Megalithic geometry and kilometres
to incorporate elements of the message.



This too seems unusual. What is more,
as we have observed, there appear to
have been visits to the Earth by the UCA
in much more recent times. This would
suggest that the alien visitors, having
manufactured the Moon, would have
had to return to the Earth over four
billion years later in order to pass the
Megalithic message onto the developing
human culture in Britain and France.
We find it difficult to imagine a culture
or society that could endure for such a
vast period of time. It is much more
likely that such a civilization would have



gone the way of inevitable evolution,
managed somehow to destroy itself, or
simply grown bored with the whole
experiment in only a tiny fraction of the
time involved.
If readers wish to believe that aliens
are responsible for this message, we
would have to say that this is a theory
worthy of further investigation. For our
part, we can see no direct proof that this
has been the case, and there seem to be
factors involved that make the alien
hypothesis unlikely to be the answer we



are seeking. However, there is a third,
and altogether more amazing option yet
to consider and it is one that appears to
fit the bill in every respect.



‘Let us make man in our
image, after our likeness’
God: Genesis 1:26
For those people who call themselves



creationists, the Bible is the word of
God. But which Bible is the authentic
one? There are countless versions of the
books contained in both the Old and
New Testaments and the oldest versions
have been carefully dissected to reveal
the different styles of authorship woven
into the fabric of the stories. Two of the
three main traditions – the Yahwist and
the Elohim (a word meaning gods in
the plural) – talk of a specific sequence
of creation. This deals with the arrival of
plants, then good and evil, then animals
and next women.



The third, priestly tradition has a
sequence of creation that is rather more
in line with modern theories about
evolution. First comes light followed by
heaven, the Earth (land and then sea),
vegetation, then the Sun, Moon and
stars. Next come birds and fishes and
finally man and women together.
An interesting fact is that the first
two traditions use the Hebrew yàsar for
the creative act of making man, which
has a simplistic or crude implication of
being shaped, as a potter models clay



objects. Both also use the word demut
for likeness, which implies similarity or
looking the same. However, in the
Priestly tradition, (the version that has
God talking to his wider council about
making man in their image) He uses a
very different word. In this case the
word bàrà is used for the creation of
man and this is a word that carries a
more complex, creative value. Next we
find selem as the chosen word for the
use of the creator’s image, which means
something more like a precise duplicate.
Selem is a term directly related to the



Canaanite word for Venus that is
associated with resurrection and
therefore rebirth of the individual.39
We find it strange that a
supposedly singular God is talking to
others around him, even before
humans have been created. He has
already made the Sun, Moon and Earth
and supplied the oceans along with
plant and animal life – but to whom is
he talking? And why do they all,
whoever ‘they’ are (including God
Himself) apparently have heads with



noses, ears and eyes, bodies with arms
and legs and presumably even genitalia?
Why is God, along with his
undisclosed team, human in
appearance?
It is not our place here to try and
make sense of Judaeo-Christian myth,
but we came to find the idea fascinating
and surprisingly plausible. The Bible
has been edited, changed and added to
by a succession of people who wanted it
to support whatever they deemed to be
true. Early Christians even accused the



Jews of having incorrect versions of their
own scriptures when they were found to
differ from the texts the early Christians
had doctored. In terms of Christianity,
it seems unlikely that a passage that
involves God talking to others before he
created humanity would have survived,
had it not been for an important aspect
of the new Christian faith. This was the
‘new’ concept of the trinity – where God
is said to comprise three separate
entities including his living human
mode as Jesus.



We are not attempting to claim
that the Bible provides us with any
evidence for the authorship of the
message we had discovered, but a close
look at the situation did lead us to a
tantalizing thought.
Could the only known intelligent
life force in the Universe be responsible
for the message? To be blunt: Could
modern humans have built the Moon?
There is obviously one very
substantial issue of logic to address here,
which is obviously the time gap of 4.6



billion years between the creation of the
Moon and the present era. Clearly, if
humanity created the Moon, this would
have to be explained. In reality, this
may not be the obstacle it appears to be,
because leading scientists are currently
debating the possibility of travelling
backwards in time. Virtually everyone
speculating about time travel is agreed
that the associated mathematics
indicates it should be possible. We will
come to the problem of travelling in
time shortly, but for the moment let us
put the issue of the time gap aside and



consider the reasons why the Moon’s
message might be from closer to home
than we ever dreamed could be possible.
The hypothesis we originally laid
down was:
1. 1. The Moon was
engineered by
an unknown
agency circa
4.6 billion
years ago to act
as an incubator
to promote



intelligent life
on Earth.
2. The unknown
agency knew
that
hum anoids
would be the
result of the
evolutionary
chain.
3. That unknown
agency wanted
the resulting



humanoids to
know what
had been done
and they left a
m essage
indicated by
the dynamics
of the Moon
and its
relationship
with the Earth.
Firstly, it has to be acknowledged that
there are no other possible candidates



that we know of anywhere in the
Universe. God exists by faith and not as
a result of evidence, and aliens may or
may not exist. It is entirely possible that
we are totally alone, either in our part of
space or in the whole of the Universe. In
any case, who would have more to gain
from a life-producing planet than the
very intelligent creature that has most
benefited from its existence, namely
hum anity?
The question of how the UCA
could have known that the intelligent



species on Earth would evolve with ten
fingers and therefore adopt base-ten
arithmetic, at a time when the Moon
was exactly where it is today, is answered
instantly if humanity is the agency we
are seeking. The mystery simply
dissolves if we are that unknown
creative agency.
Another difficult issue to explain
has been how the UCA could possibly
have used Megalithic and metric units
as part of the message. Once again, this
scenario resolves the problem. Indeed, it



adds to the message because it makes it
very clear that the UCA ‘has to be’
humans from our future, travelling
back in time to manufacture the Moon.
The motive for the message
becomes obvious and absolutely
necessary. If humans do not become
alerted to the need to manufacture the
Moon as an incubator for life – we
would not be here.
However, there is the problem we
can’t avoid. Humanity might be
described as having been reasonably



technologically advanced for around
100 years. The Moon came into being
some 4,600,000,000,000 years ago. We
have to admit that this does represent a
bit of a gap.
The answer can only be time
travel.



Tomorrow’s yesterday
Time is perceived as flowing like a river
from the past into the future and we are
all riding the wave in one direction. But
what if it were possible to head back
upstream? Not necessarily for humans
themselves, though that cannot be ruled
out, but for pre-programmed super
machines; equipment so sophisticated
that it could engineer planetary-sized
objects. After all, most spacecraft today
are unmanned units that carry out all
kinds of experiments, take photographs



and even analyse samples of alien rock.
It would not therefore be hard to
imagine a project team from our
relatively near future designing and
deploying ‘chronobots’40 to construct
key elements of the past.
But is time travel a dream or a
possible reality?
For most people such thoughts
cause headaches. The question that
anyone will reasonably focus upon is: If
humans went back in time to build the
Moon so that there would be humans



where did humans come from?
It seems like an impossible loop
but is it stranger than the age-old
conundrum about the chicken and the
egg? Logically, it is necessary to have a
chicken to lay an egg, yet one needs an
egg for that chicken to have sprung
from. A creationist would have no
problem as their God manufactured the
first chicken with an ability to lay eggs.
The evolutionists would be a little
sneakier and say that a creature that was
not quite a chicken laid an egg that



produced a mutation that was the first
proper chicken. So, the egg came first.
It really is not worth losing sleep
about such problems, as the only way to
deal with any paradox is to simply
accept it.
Today, we are programmed with a
need for neat, predictable Newtonian
style logic. Simple cause and effect – so
that if ‘A’ happens ‘B’ will result. People
everywhere seem willing to accept the
idea that we were either created by God,
or that we exist due to a mega-series of



flabbergastingly beneficial accidents.
Look at these two possibilities again and
then ask yourself if it is any more far
fetched or unreasonable to suggest that,
as a species, we went back to create our
own life-giving planet system and
ultimately ourselves? (For some reason,
to the religiously-minded, the
insurmountable question of ‘Who
made God?’ can be safely ignored, as
can the ridiculous improbability of an
infinitely flowing stream of beneficial
serendipity to non-believers).



Humans throughout history have
generally had a psychological need for a
higher authority, whether it be a
supreme deity or the laws of physics.
Thankfully, that is not necessarily the
whole story at all.
The debate about time travel goes
on amongst the experts as it has done
for many decades. Generally speaking,
philosophers don’t care for the idea, for
a whole host of logical or illogical
reasons, though some of them are
coming round in the face of the latest



evidence. Meanwhile physicists are
becoming increasingly certain that time
travel is possible, and they have the
mathematics to back up what is far
from being a simple hunch.
Whilst the idea of travelling into
the past is so counterintuitive for most
people that they just cannot get their
heads around it, a physics heavyweight
and a philosophy heavyweight from
Oxford University have another view.
They once teamed up to confront the
apparent paradox that seems to forbid



the highly fluid present penetrating the
apparently frozen structure of the past.
David Deutsch and Michael Lockwood
have the problem in context; saying
about the quantum physics of time
travel: ‘Common sense may rule out
such excursions – but the laws of
physics do not.’41
Most people have a real problem
with the idea of time travel, and the so
called ‘grandfather paradox’
encapsulates why the idea appears to
assault common sense so strongly. The



idea is that if a young man was able to
travel back from the present time to,
say, 1950, he might kill, or cause his
grandfather to be killed before his own
father was born. If this were to happen,
it would mean that he could not exist
and therefore could not have killed his
grandfather. The problem just goes
around in apparently impossible circles.
The only solution appears, at first view,
to be to consider all such journeys as
utterly impossible – if for no other
reason than to save us from terminal
confusion!



However, Deutsch and Lockwood
are not so easily fazed and they remain
unconvinced about the need to protect
our sensibilities from issues of reality
just because laypeople tend to become
confused. In an article published in
Scientific American they discuss another
apparent time paradox that deals with
the possibility that even knowledge does
not seem to require a beginning.
They refer to the grandfather
killing scenario as being an
‘inconsistency paradox’ and then they



discuss another type of apparent time
traveller violation of logic that they call
a ‘knowledge paradox’. This is an
apparent violation of the principle that
knowledge can only come into existence
as a result of problem-solving processes,
such as biological evolution or human
thought. In the example, they talk
about a hypothetical art critic who goes
back in time to visit a famous artist
from the previous century who, the
critic realizes, is only producing very
mediocre work. The time traveller
shows the painter a book containing



reproductions of his later and greater
works, which he then proceeds to
carefully copy in every detail with oil
paints onto canvas. This means that the
reproductions in the book exist because
they are copied from the paintings and
the paintings exist because they were
copied from the reproductions. So,
where did the inspiration come from?
‘This kind of puzzling paradox,’
say Deutsch and Lockwood, ‘once
caused physicists to invoke a chronology
principle that, by fiat alone, ruled out



travel into the past.’ But they believe
that travelling into the past does not
violate any principle of physics, however
much it seems counterintuitive to the
average person. Furthermore, the
Oxford duo state that quantum
mechanical effects actually facilitate
time travel rather than prevent it, as
some scientists once argued.
They explain the basics of the
concept of time by pointing to
Einstein’s special and general theories of
relativity where three-dimensional space



is combined with time to form four
dimensional space-time. Within this,
everyone’s life forms a kind of four
dimensional ‘worm’ in space-time, with
the tip of the worm’s tail corresponding
to their birth and the top of the head to
the person’s death. The line along
which the ‘worm’ lies is called the
person’s (or object’s) ‘worldline’ and
each moment of time is a cross section
of that worldline.
Einstein’s general theory of
relativity predicts that massive bodies,



such as stars and black holes, distort
space-time and bend worldlines. This is
believed to be the origin of gravity
and, for example, the Earth’s worldline
spirals around that of the Sun, which in
turn spirals around that of the centre of
our galaxy. Deutsch and Lockwood
propose that if space-time becomes
really distorted by gravity some
worldlines would become closed loops
where they would continue to conform
to all the familiar properties of space
and time in their own locality, yet they
would become corridors to the past.



They state:
‘If we tried to follow
such a Closed
Timelike Curve (or
CTC) exactly, all
the way around, we
would bump into
our former selves
and get pushed
aside. But by
following part of a
CTC, we could
return to the past



and participate in
events there. We
could shake hands
with our younger
selves or, if the loop
were large enough,
visit our ancestors.
To do this, we
should either have
to harness naturally
occurring CTCs or
create CTCs by
distorting and
tearing the fabric of



space-time. So a
time machine,
rather than being a
special kind of
vehicle, would
provide a route to
the past, along
which an ordinary
vehicle, such as a
spacecraft, could
travel.’42
So, world-class physicists like Professor
Deutsch can conceive of potentially



giant spacecraft voyaging backwards in
time. Perhaps such craft could be filled
with chronobots that could even self
replicate to take on a task that might
take hundreds of thousands, or even
millions, of years. Building an object the
size of the Moon with pre-programmed
orbital requirements is unlikely to be a
quick exercise. But time would literally
be on their side.
There are various ideas about how
these time-travel enabling CTCs might
be formed. The mathematician Kurt



Gödel found a solution to Einstein’s
equations that describes CTCs within a
rotating Universe and they also appear
in solutions of Einstein’s equations
describing rotating black holes. But
there are many practical problems
including the evidence that naturally
occurring black holes are not spinning
fast enough. Maybe a technique will one
day be found to increase their rotation
rate until safe CTCs appear.
The physicist John A Wheeler
from Princeton University has famously



suggested shortcuts through space-time
that he calls ‘wormholes’, and other
scientists have shown how two ends of a
wormhole could be moved, so as to
form a CTC.
Professor Deutsch has become a
champion of the many-Universes
theory, first put forward by Hugh
Everett III in 1957, where everything
that can happen does happen. For this
reason, the supposed paradoxes of time
travel simply do not exist. In the
scenario where the man kills his



grandfather, he does not exist in the one
single Universe where the murder is
committed, but he does in the ones
where he fails to assassinate his forebear.
Deutsch and Lockwood conclude
that there is no scientific objection to
time travel, saying in their article:
‘The idea that time
travel paradoxes
could be resolved by
“parallel Universes”
has been anticipated
in science fiction



and by some
philosophers. What
we have presented
here is not so much
a new resolution as
a new way of
arriving at it, by
deducing it from
existing physical
theory... These
calculations
definitively dispose
of the inconsistency
paradoxes, which



turn out to be
merely artifacts of
an obsolete, classical
worldview.’
They appear to be suggesting a loop in
time that has a twist in it so that contact
is made with a near identical parallel
existence, through which the time
traveller can arrive at a time and place
that always has them present.
Their thought-provoking article
concludes with the authors pointing out
that science says time travel is



theoretically possible. As a result, the
onus is on those who wish to argue
otherwise to prove their case:
‘We conclude that if
time travel is
impossible, then the
reason has yet to be
discovered. We may
or may not one day
locate or create
navigable CTCs.
But if anything like
the many-Universes



picture is true – and
in quantum
cosmology and the
quantum theory of
computation no
viable alternative is
known – then all
the standard
objections to time
travel depend on
false models of
physical reality. So
it is incumbent on
anyone who still



wants to reject the
idea of time travel
to come up with
some new scientific
or philosophical
argum ent.’
And many experts agree. Physicist, Matt
Visser of Victoria University of
Wellington, has compiled a short list of
the time travel opportunities that have
turned up since Einstein showed us how
to warp space-time. He has said that
Einstein’s general theory of relativity not



only allows time machines to exist, it is
‘completely infested with them’.
Others fear the concept of time
travel, even though they have not been
able to demonstrate that it cannot be
done. ‘I think most of us would like to
get rid of time machines if we possibly
could,’ says Amanda Peet of the
University of Toronto. ‘They offend our
fundamental sensibilities.’
The only argument that has been
made against time travel comes from
the famous Cambridge phycisist,



Stephen Hawking, in the form of his
‘chronology protection conjecture’. This
suggestion boils down to the notion that
the Universe might have a built-in time
cop, so whenever anyone is on the verge
of constructing a working time machine
the time cop turns up and shuts the
operation down before it has a chance
to damage the past. However, there are
no time cops evident in the laws of
physics, so, at the moment, the
chronology protection conjecture is
simply wishful thinking.



As far as our scenario is concerned,
humans exist because, at some future
point, we will return to the time when
our planet was a young lump of
unstratified matter and then we shall
make the Moon.
Once complete, our Moon worked
its magic and life began, evolving
eventually into an intelligent, ten
fingered species that uses Megalithic
and metric units. The message had to
be built into the very nature of the
structure or else we would miss the cue



to understand what we need to do.
But how can we do it and when
will we do it?
Ronald Mallett, a Professor of
Theoretical Physics at Connecticut
University, already believes he has
found a way to create a CTC or time
machine using light. He has identified
that a circulating beam of light, slowed
right down to a snail’s pace, may well be
the key to the door of time travel
because, although light has no mass it
does bend space. The realization that



time, as well as space, might be twisted
by circulating light beams caused
Mallett to team up with other scientists
at Connecticut University in 2001, with
the intention of building a prototype,
saying, ‘With this device time travel
may become a practical possibility.’
Mallett decided that if he added a
second light beam, circulating in the
opposite direction to the first, it would
increase the intensity of the light enough
to cause space and time to swap roles.
Inside the circulating light beam, time



runs round and round, and, what to an
outsider appears to be time becomes
like an ordinary dimension of space. A
person walking along in the right
direction could actually be walking
backwards in time – as measured
outside the circle. So after walking for a
while, you could leave the circle and
meet yourself before you have entered
it.
However, it turns out that the
energy needed to twist time into a loop
is enormous, and when Mallett



reviewed his progress he realized that
the effect of circulating light depends on
its velocity: the slower the light, the
stronger the distortion in space-time.
By strange good fortune, Lene
Hau, a phycisist at Harvard University,
has slowed light from the usual
300,000km per second to just a few
metres per second, and almost frozen
its progress completely. Mallett was
ecstatic saying, ‘The slow light opens up
a domain we just haven’t had before.
All you need is to have the light



circulate in one of these media.’
Maybe current scientists will crack
the problem of time travel but it seems
logical to expect the necessary
instructions to be contained in the
deeper layer of the Moon’s message.
However, it seems likely that black holes
may be at the root of the technology
required.
The black holes of deep space are
the gravitational remains of dead stars.
They are super-dense, bottomless pits in
both space and time that are capable of



sucking in almost infinite amounts of
material, including light. Everything a
black hole swallows gets compressed
into an unimaginably tiny central
region called a ‘singularity’ in which the
atoms are crushed into an unmoving
whole. If the Earth were to become as
dense as a black hole, it would be
smaller than a golf ball. (And they say
you can’t compress water!)
There seems to be no way to get
any information about what is
happening inside a black hole, as even



light is trapped inside. However,
Cambridge physicist Stephen Hawking
proposed a way in which black holes do
radiate matter and slowly dissipate until
they eventually disappear in a final
mega-burst of radiation.
Amazingly, scientists are becoming
increasingly confident that they will be
able to create black holes on demand
using the new atom-smashers due to
come on line in 2007. It is believed that
the new Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
being built astride the Franco-Swiss



border west of Geneva by the European
Centre for Nuclear Research (CERN)
will be able to create black holes at the
rate of one per second. The LHC is an
accelerator which will bombard protons
and antiprotons together, with such a
force that the collision will create
temperatures and energy densities not
seen since the first trillionth of a second
after the big bang. This should be
enough to pop off numerous tiny black
holes, with masses of just a few hundred
protons. Black holes of this size will
evaporate almost instantly, their



existence detectable only by dying bursts
of Hawking radiation.
This work is at an early stage but it
may well prove to be the beginnings of a
platform that could drive the search for
the technology to enable time travel.
If humans from our future did travel to
the distant past to create the incubator
that would produce our own species, it
does make complete sense of the
message left to us. We have to imagine
that our ability to complete such an
awesome task must be hundreds or



even thousands of years ahead of our
current level of capabilities. However,
what if the instructions of how to
proceed were contained inside the
message itself? If this was the case, the
development time might be cut to a
m inim um .
Maybe a question we should be
asking ourselves is why the message was
so carefully timed to reveal itself at this
particular time. Could it be that we
have so far only seen what is little more
than a ‘waving flag’ to alert us to a



greater message that tells us exactly what
must be done in order to fulfill our own
destiny? Maybe the central pattern
revealed by the mutual orbits of the
Earth and its Moon and, quite
separately, by the relative sizes of 366.3
x 27.3 = 10,000 is the most
fundamental key of all.
At this stage there are two entirely
separate questions that need to be
answered:
1. 1. To what are we
to apply the



cipher?
2. If humans
created the
Moon as an
incubator for
life, where did
the seeds for
germ ination
come from?
The answer to both final elements of
this ultimate riddle may well rest in the
same place: DNA.



The secrets of the Genome
The Human Genome Project,
completed in 2003, was a thirteen-year
mission to unravel the secrets of the
minute data store that carries all the
information needed to make a human
being, what we call DNA. The key goals
of the project were to:
1. 1. Identify all the
genes in
human DNA,
of which there



are believed to
be
approxim ately
20,000–25,000
2. Determine the
sequences of
the three
billion
chemical base
pairs that
make up
human DNA
Professor Paul Davies has published an



idea that strikes a real chord with the
findings laid out in this book. He does
not criticize the people from SETI for
constantly sweeping the skies with radio
telescopes, in the hope of stumbling
across a signal from deep space, but he
is realistic about the chances of success.
He points out that it is inconceivable
that aliens would beam signals at our
planet continuously for untold aeons,
merely in the hope that one day
intelligent beings might evolve and
decide to turn a radio telescope in their
direction. And if the aliens only



transmit messages sporadically, the
chances of us tuning in at just the right
time are infinitesimal.
However, he does not write off the
idea of contact: ‘But what if the truth
isn’t out there at all? What if it lies
somewhere else? Now may be the time
to try a radically different approach.’43
Davies uses the idea we have
already reported of a ‘set-and-forget’
technique of communication, whereby
the information content of the message
may have to survive for hundreds of



millions of years. He acknowledges that
a conventional artefact placed on the
Earth’s surface would be almost
certainly overlooked, even if it did
somehow survive. He then suggests that
an altogether better solution would be:
‘...a legion of small, cheap, self
repairing and self-replicating machines
that can keep editing and copying
information and perpetuate themselves
over immense durations in the face of
unforeseen environmental hazards.’
This sounds like pure science



fiction but he continues by saying: ‘...
Fortunately, such machines already
exist. They are called living cells.’
What a brilliantly simple idea. We
have already established that large
sections of the scientific community are
openly saying that DNA absolutely
could not have spontaneously arrived
it must have been designed. So, why
would the manufacturer not use it to
contain a message?
Is it possible? Is there spare space
in there for a message?



As Paul Davies confirms, the cells
in our bodies, and anything else that
lives for that matter, contain messages
set out billions of years ago. He also says
that the idea that aliens have
deliberately hidden messages inside
DNA has been ‘swirling around’ for a
few years, and has been championed in
recent times by the Apollo astronaut
Rusty Schweickart. But, says Davies, on
the face of it, there is a serious problem.
Living cells are not completely
immune to change, and mutations



introduce random errors that become
stored as information, and, over a long
enough time span, they would turn the
original message into ‘molecular
gobbledygook’. Davies then reminds us
that there is so-called ‘junk’ DNA:
sections of the genome that seem to
serve no useful purpose. These areas
could be loaded with messages without
affecting the performance of the cells
and some parts of that junk DNA are in
highly conserved regions that are
therefore relatively safe from
degradation.



When a team of genomic
researchers at the Lawrence Berkeley
National Laboratory in California
presented their own findings in June
2004, the audience gasped in unison.
Those listening, simply could not
believe what they were hearing from
Edward Rubin and team who were
reporting that they had deleted huge
sections of the genome of mice without
it making any discernable difference to
the animals. The result was truly
amazing because the deleted sequences
included what is known as ‘conserved



regions’, which were previously
assumed to have been protected because
they contained vital information about
functions.
To find out the function of some
of these highly conserved non-protein
coding regions in mammals, Rubin’s
team deleted two huge regions of DNA
from mice, containing nearly 1,000
highly conserved sequences shared
between humans and mice. One of the
removed chunks was 1.6 million DNA
bases long and the other was over



800,000 bases long – which should have
caused the mice to have serious
problem s.
All DNA can acquire random
mutations, but if a mutation occurs in a
region that has a key function, the
individual will die before they are able
to reproduce and therefore the damage
to the information will be removed
from the species. This protection
mechanism means that the most vital
sequences of DNA remain virtually
unchanged – even between species. So



by comparing the genomes of mice and
men, geneticists had hoped to pick out
those with the most important
functions by studying the conserved
regions.
The geneticists were utterly
perplexed because the regions they
removed made no difference to the
mice in question, so there seemed to be
no reason why these non-coding
sequences, apparently functionless parts
of the DNA, should be protected from
change. Why should they matter? It is



like having the world’s finest encrypted
security system built into your waste
bin.
Any burglar who observed that
your rubbish had so much apparently
unnecessary protection would
immediately suspect that you were
hiding something of great value in an
unexpected place. And that is the
thought that occurred to Paul Davies.
He believes there could be a message
from extra terrestrials in what has been
referred to as junk DNA.



We suspect he might be right
about the message but not about the
author. He says:
‘Looking for
messages in living
cells has the virtue
that DNA is being
sequenced anyway.
All it needs is a
computer to search
for suspicious
looking patterns.
Long strings of the



same nucleotides
are an obvious
attention-grabber.
Peculiar numerical
sequences like
prime numbers
would be a clincher
and patterns that
stand out even
when partially
degraded by
mutational noise
would make the
most sense... if a



sequence of junk
DNA bases were
displayed as an
array of pixels on a
screen (with the
colour depending
on the base: blue for
A, green for G, and
so on...’
He then asks what the message could
contain and notes that one segment of
DNA, chopped out by Rubin and his
team, contained more than a million



base pairs – enough, he says, ‘for a
decent-sized novel or a potted history of
the rise and fall of an alien civilization.’
And this would be from just one
part of the junk DNA.
As we digested Davies’ suggestion
about number sequences making a
screen we were immediately reminded
of how the numbers that we have
identified as the lead key of the message
produce 10,000 – or if the decimal
point is removed from the values we get
the following:



3663 x 273 =
999,999
As close to a million as makes no
difference.
These are the PIN numbers of the
Earth and Moon doubly cross
referenced by their orbital periods and
relative masses. Without the decimal
point, they describe a screen (possibly a
computer monitor) that has a million
pixels with sides of 3663 and 273.
One of the ‘high security’ sections



of apparently empty genome removed
by Rubin’s team had just over a million
elements. It would be more than
interesting to apply the 3663 x 273
matrix to this data.



What will it tell us?
It may well give us vital information
about building equipment that moves
matter backwards in time and it will tell
us where to start the process of planning
to build a Moon! It is likely that it will
also instruct us where to look for further
inform ation.
If we are correct, we are all carrying
this ‘treasure map’ in our hearts, our
brains and even our hair. But so too is
every living creature on God’s Earth.



‘Let us make man in our image,
after our likeness,’ said God.
Could it really be true that a team
of humans will control the creation of
our world and seed it with DNA so that
humans will evolve in our own image?
Will a future president of the United
States of America, or perhaps a Director
General of the United Nations sanction
the launch of a mission to create these
mammoth, but necessary, changes to
the past, whilst quoting the words from
verse 26 of the first chapter of the Book



of Genesis?
This is not a blasphemous
thought. Some Christians and indeed
people of other religions might find this
idea offensive because it appears to
suggest that we humans are God. But
this is not the case. It merely suggests
that we acted and will act on creative
information that was originated
somewhere else by some elemental force
that transcends all Universes – all
parallel realities.
The awe and mystery of existence



remains intact and for those that want
to call that essence ‘God’, He remains
unchallenged.
However, the account we describe
here does sit well with the scriptures of
the great religions. Genesis is
remarkably accurate and, as it turns
out, the creationists may not be entirely
wrong about a grand design in which
humans were existent from the start.
They will have to adjust their dating
assumptions, which do not come from
the Bible anyway. And they will have to



accept that evolution was just a
mechanism within the grand design.
The Hindu perception of the way
the Universe works also remains intact,
and the only adjustment they might
adopt would be to accept that the cycle
of rebirth has twisted into reverse as well
as going forwards. We doubt the
intellectuals within Buddhism will have
a problem with this.
We see this process of self
conception as something akin to a
Möbius strip, named after August



Ferdinand Möbius, the nineteenth
century German mathematician and
astronomer. Möbius was a pioneer in
the field of topology. Along with his
contemporaries, Riemann, Lobachevsky
and Bolyai, Möbius created a non
Euclidean revolution in geometry.
The simple construct that is a
Möbius strip can be made with a strip
of paper by joining the ends with a 180°
twist. It then only has one surface and
one edge that goes around forever.
Without the half- twist it would have



been impossible to move from one side
to the other without crossing an edge
but suddenly the barrier does not exist.
If one travelled in a straight line on a
Möbius surface one would return to the
starting point.



Figure 13
The world’s most famous graphic artist Maurits
Cornelis Escher(1898–1972) was fascinated by the
imagery of the Möbius surface.
We see an analogy with humankind
who evolved from DNA, seeded on
Earth some 3.5 billion years ago by
ourselves, just a little in our future.
When we reach the point of being able
to travel back in time we will have
completed a circuit of the single-sided
loop and then move off into a new
trajectory.



Once the idea of time travel is
accepted as a scientific possibility, there
is no problem with the idea that
humans in the future engineered both
DNA and the life-nurturing Earth
Moon system billions of years ago. We
exist because the right circumstances
were present for life to develop – and so
why does it matter whether a super
entity (God), extraterrestrials or
humans arranged it to be so? Why
should it be wrong to arrange for our
own arrival?



Each of them is extremely unlikely,
but nothing like as unlikely as the
notion of random chance – the endless
mega-string of beneficial good luck.
The idea of the Möbius principle is
that it is a loop that twists back in time
and returns forward again. Imagine a
situation whereby an artefact (say a
black monolith) was manufactured in
the year 2010 and was taken back in
time by four billion years in 2011,
where it was buried in a location of
long-term stability on the Moon. The



artefact could be recovered from the
Moon before it was manufactured and
the atomic matter from which it was
made would exist in two places at the
same time, until it was transported back
to the early Moon.
This seems impossible. But just
about everything about quantum
physics sounds implausible. Quantum
physics tells us that everything from
light to matter is made up of tiny,
indivisible packets called quanta that do
not work as we normally see the world.



Niels Bohr, one of the pioneers of the
subject said: ‘Anyone who can
contemplate quantum mechanics
without getting dizzy hasn’t properly
understood it.’
One of the features of this branch
of science is the recognition that
particles (or wave functions) briefly exist
in several different places
simultaneously. The monolith that had
two concurrent realities would be a
quantum effect on a worldly scale
instead of at a sub atomic level.



Once the 2010 artefact goes back in
time, the duality will be resolved and
the world will continue as normal.
Equally, we could consider all of the
time, from the building of the Moon
through to the point of time travel, as a
Möbius loop where we end up back
where we started. Thereafter we break
out of the loop and move forward in
the normal way.



Time and again
We have speculated that chronobots
were sent back to engineer the Moon
and they must have returned again
nearly a billion years later to seed the
ploughed Earth with DNA, to begin the
process of evolution that would result in
the arrival of humans.
But it appears that there must have
been other interventions at specific
times in the past to bring about certain
events.



We have always agreed with
archaeologists who say that the existence
of the Megalithic Yard is inconsistent
with the technology otherwise known to
have been present amongst the people
of western Europe over five millennia
ago. But we heartily disagreed with
them when most chose to ignore
Professor Thom’s findings rather than
attempt to reconcile them. Such people
are obstacles to knowledge.
When we discovered that the
Megalithic system extended to the



Moon, our credulity was stretched to
the limit but our curiosity carried us
forward to try and make sense of that
which looked impossible to reconcile.
When we found that the metric system
had been in place almost perfectly,
four-and-a-half thousand years before a
team of French scientists reinvented it,
we were amazed. Then we discovered
that metric units were perfect integers
for the most crucial aspects of the Moon
as well as the Earth.
We have noted that through



ancient history different civilizations
have recorded that people with super
powers arrived from nowhere to teach
humanity about the sciences. Then we
noted how all the parallel developments
that occurred around the world in
unconnected locations happened at the
same time.
We have to conclude that people
will travel back to points in history, such
as the era around 3100 BC, when
several civilizations, from South
America to North Africa to Asia to



Europe, were suddenly emerging and
building similar structures. It seems
probable that the Megalithic structures
that have lunar alignments, and use the
unit that describes the dimensions of
the Moon, were deliberately designed
and left to point the way forward.
We do not yet know whether the
detailed message is indeed inside the
protected sections of DNA, but
wherever it is, the initial message was
only recognized because of all those
Megalithic structures extending their



weathered and ancient stone fingers into
the night sky.
The fact that the imperial pound
and the pint are mathematically
derivable from the Megalithic Yard was
puzzling and when we found that the
same Stone-Age unit describes metric
spheres we were dumbfounded. How
could such surprising consequences
come about so accurately by chance
alone?
It now seems that the past has
been modelled by the future. A strange



Möbian twist for reality.
Of course this all sounds so
improbable that some people will refuse
to believe it. They will reject the fact that
everything we have put forward is real
and testable and the elements of
unavoidable speculation are
scientifically sound. But many
creationists will still shout that black is
white and many so-called scientists will
return to their deeply flawed paradigms
as though they were real.
But when the message is actually



found. What then?



‘My own suspicion is that the
Universe is not only queerer
than we suppose but queerer
than we can suppose.’
Haldane’s Law put forward by geneticist, J P
S Haldane



We have come on a strange journey
since we first realized the science that lay
behind the stone circles at Stonehenge,
Brodgar, Avebury and thousands of
other Neolithic sites across the British
Isles.
We believe that our determination
not to draw conclusions too early has
paid dividends. We have refused to
ignore those pieces of the puzzle that
seemed outlandish or even downright
impossible, and have retained our
tolerance for unexpected results.



They say all progress is dependent
on the unreasonable person. Alexander
Thom was certainly an unreasonable
person, or else he would have
capitulated in the face of the wave of
rejection he received from the majority
of professional archaeologists. How
irritating of the man, his opponents
thought, to repeatedly insist that his
reams of data, gathered over scores of
years, show that the Megalithic builders
worked to an incredible degree of
engineering accuracy and employed
precise standardized units of length.



Any reasonable person, and
certainly any academic who wanted
future employment within a specific
discipline, would have buried the data
that showed that the Megalithic Yard
and its accompanying geometry were
integer to the Moon and Sun as well as
the Earth. It sounds ridiculous, and
those who are members of the ‘club’
will consider anyone who speaks of it
equally ridiculous.
Yet the Moon unquestionably does
conform to Megalithic geometry and



now, we believe, we are beginning to
understand why.
The SETI institute is still sweeping
the skies looking for incoming
electromagnetic radiation that deviates
even a tiny amount from the
anticipated background noise
something that could conceivably be an
indication of intelligence elsewhere in
the cosmos. But the message they seek
is already with us because, by the
standards of what SETI considers might
constitute a message, surely the material



we have described here must be the
world’s first prime contact with a
consciousness that existed 4.6 billion
years ago.
The assumption of SETI and its
operatives is that another intelligence
will make contact from far away and so
the searchers are focused on staring into
the far depths of space for a message.
But if any entity were that smart why
would it have to make a long-distance
call?
Four hundred years ago our solar



system was the great mystery – but our
own immediate environs hold less
fascination in the light of incredible
devices such as the Hubble telescope,
which can reach far into space and into
the past. We have ticked the box that is
the solar system and astronomers are
more interested in distant quasars and
nebula. Is it this new leading edge of
attention that has previously blinded us
to the obvious in our own backyard?
The message we have received has
told us about the way that the Moon



was constructed to give life to the Earth,
and there are tantalizing hints that this
design may extend to the rest of the
solar system, and possibly even beyond.
Why is Jupiter in such an untypical
orbit that just happens to be a cosmic
umbrella for Earth? Why does Venus
provide such a perfect clock and
calendar when viewed from Earth?
Modern scientific culture has
evolved from its roots in the ancient
world and has become a complex web
of many highly specialized disciplines.



Gone are the days when one man, such
as the seventeenth-century Robert
Hooke, could be a groundbreaking
inventor, microscopist, physicist,
surveyor, astronomer, biologist and
even artist. Today the sheer enormity of
available information has led to highly
defined specialisms, and academics are
expected to keep to their field – despite
the truism that science has no experts.
No one, for instance, doubted
Alexander Thom’s abilities as a
professor of engineering but he was not
welcome in the world of archaeology.



The gains from modern science are
beyond counting. But the loss, arguably,
is the synthesis of information
generated by the many gentleman
scholars that once existed, before
becoming extinct somewhere around
the late nineteenth century. So few
scholars now have a chance to view the
bigger picture – to seek out patterns that
might unexpectedly exist when
apparently unrelated data is brought
together. It has to be remembered that
the difference between a major
breakthrough and nothing at all can be



just the angle of view rather than
anything else.
Occasionally, two or more
disciplines are brought together to form
a new speciality in science. One of these
turned out to be the subject that was
directly invented by Alexander Thom,
namely archaeoastronomy – a field of
study involved with the use of
astronomy by ancient cultures. Our
previous book, Civilization One,
demonstrated the geometry that lies
behind Thom’s proposed Megalithic



Yard. We unambiguously showed how
it is directly related to other
measurement systems (linear,
volumetric and weight) and put
forward a testable theory of how it was
reproduced using Venus and a
pendulum. We therefore decided to
send a copy of our book to a man who
we believe is the world’s only professor
of archaeoastronomy. He received a
précis and the completed book but we
received no response whatsoever.
We knew that the information we



had put forward was not incorrect
because people suitably qualified in
astronomy and mathematics had
carefully checked it. So why no
response? Perhaps the approach was so
counter to the worldview of this
particular expert he could not
understand it. Or maybe he just did not
like the implications of our conclusions.
We also attempted to get a copy of
the book to a world-class physicist.
When he was told of the subject matter
he responded almost angrily by saying



that it was well known that Thom’s
work had been discredited decades ago
and only weirdos clung onto the
romantic hope that Stone-Age man
possessed a rational and unchanging
unit of length.
In actual fact he was repeating a
mantra that has sprung up in academic
circles but is no more than an urban
myth, because no one has proven
Thom to be wrong. We responded by
pointing out that we had done our
research very carefully and that whilst



there are certainly people who have
argued against Thom’s conclusions,
they have not proven his conclusions to
be wrong – nor is it possible for anyone
to prove a negative.
The academic then responded
politely and accepted what we said,
although he explained that he did not
have time to read our book due to
personal problems.
We therefore expect to have a fight
on our hands when it comes to getting
leading academics to review the findings



contained in this book. But fight we
will.
Finally, it is probably helpful to
apply to our whole hypothesis a test
created by the late, great astronomer
Carl Sagan, that he called a ‘Baloney
Detection Kit’. Sagen suggested a set of
tools shown below for testing claims
and detecting fallacious or fraudulent
arguments. We have put our responses
beneath in italics.
Wherever possible
there must be



independent
confirmation of the
facts.
All of the key
elements that we
consider constitute a
message are
checkable using data
published by leading
authorities.
Encourage
substantive debate
on the evidence by
knowledgeable



proponents of all
points of view.
Yes please. We have
tried and will
continue to do so.
Arguments from
authority carry little
weight (in science
there are no
authorities).
At least it should be
a level playing field.
Spin more than one
hypothesis – don’t



simply run with the
first idea that
caught your fancy.
We have had to
dismiss only one
possible hypothesis:
coincidence, and
have investigated
every other avenue
we can think of.
Try not to get overly
attached to a
hypothesis just
because it’s yours.



Quantify, wherever
possible.
We struggled to
accept our own
results initially and
we remain entirely
open to any other
interpretation that
might be brought
forward.
If there is a chain of
argument every link
in the chain must
work.



Unlike the existing
main theories of the
Moon’s origin and
the origin of DNA,
we believe that we
have a very strong
chain with no weak
link.
Occam’s razor – if
there are two
hypotheses that
explain the data
equally well, choose
the simpler.



Absolutely. But the
simplest is also the
weirdest, although it
is also the most
scientifically robust.
Ask whether the
hypothesis can, at
least in principle, be
falsified (shown to
be false by some
unambiguous test).
In other words, is it
testable? Can others
duplicate the



experiment and get
the same result?
The number
sequences we have
found are checkable
by anyone with a
book on basic
astronomy and a
calculator. The
question is just how
far people are
prepared to go in
claiming coincidence.



We believe we have made a case that
deserves to be heard and investigated. It
is hard to imagine how even the most
sceptical, unimaginative academic
could deny the possibility that we are
looking at a message here. Not to
investigate and discuss it further would
be anti-scientific and, we believe, very
foolish.
Everyone who has bothered to
think about it is agreed; any message
from the distant past either has to be
very big or very small. We believe it is



both.
We have good reason to think that
Professor Paul Davies and others who
suspect that there could be a
communication addressed to us in
apparently empty sections of DNA are
correct. If the next layer of the message
is, as seems likely, contained in the cells
of our own bodies – it must be sought
out!
Our suggestion that the group of a
million unused base pairs, found by
geneticist Edward Rubin and his team,



might be a viewable message if laid out
on a format of 3663 x 273 has to be
tested. It might be the answer and, if so,
humankind is on the verge of a new age
– an age of maturity.
But if the message is not detected
in that way, the peculiarities of the
Moon remain and we need all serious
scientists to work together to solve this
riddle – which must be almost in our
grasp.
We call on the world to assemble a
team of leading scientists from all of the



disciplines that could possibly be
involved in deciphering the Moon’s
message and, if our third scenario is
correct, constructing the CTC – the
time transport system. And we may
need observers from the leading
religions.
We suggest that this be called ‘The
Möbius Mission’ – a project to begin all
projects!
Albert Einstein was an incredibly
wise man as well as a scientific genius.
Amongst his many quotable



observations he once said: ‘Imagination
is more important that knowledge.’
How true. We therefore need
people with depth of vision as well as
knowledge and practical ability. So, it is
our intention to first approach scientists
such as Paul Davies, David Deutsch and
Ronald Mallett. We feel sure that their
curiosity will help to change the world.



About Pendulums
A pendulum is one of the simplest
devices imaginable. In its most basic



form it is nothing more than a weight
suspended on a piece of twine or sinew.
Since the pendulum has another
function, as a plumb line, it may well be
one of the first devices used by
humanity. If allowed to hang, the
weight of a pendulum will pull its string
into a perfectly vertical position.
Certainly the Megalithic people could
never have constructed any of the major
sites to be found all over Britain, Ireland
and Brittany without the use of this
device. It is therefore reasonable to
suggest that if they possessed a plumb



line, they also possessed a pendulum.
Although the device had been
around for a long time it was the
sixteenth-century genius Galileo who
seems to have been the first person to
look seriously at the attributes of
pendulums (or at least the first of
whom we have a record.) He is reported
to have been bored in Church one day
when his attention was caught by a large
incense burner suspended from above
by a chain or a rope, gently swinging
back and forth and forming a natural



pendulum. Galileo realized that the
swings of the pendulum were equal in
terms of time and he counted them
against the beat of his own pulse.
Only two factors are of importance
in the case of a simple pendulum.
These are the length of the string and
the gravitation of the Earth, which
constantly exerts a pressure that will
eventually bring the pendulum back to
a vertical and resting position. The
height of the swing of a pendulum is, to
all intents and purposes, irrelevant



because its time period from one
extremity to the other will always be the
same. In other words if the pendulum
is excited more vigorously it will swing
higher but its time period will remain
the same.
It was a recognition of this
constant nature of a pendulum that
made it useful in the creation of clocks.
In modern timepieces the pendulum
has been superseded, but for many
centuries it ensured the smooth running
of clocks all over the world. It can still



be found in quality clocks. Clock
pendulums were eventually fitted with
devices to prevent them from swinging
too high, and others to regulate the
nature of their arc of swing, but they are
still, essentially, only animated plumb
lines.



The Megalithic Yard
The Megalithic Yard was discovered by
Alexander Thom as part of the
composition of Megalithic sites from
the northernmost part of Scotland,
right down to Brittany in the South.
The main problem with its use, and the
reason archaeologists still doubt its
veracity, lies in the fact that it remained
absolutely accurate across thousands of
square miles and many centuries. This
would appear to be impossible in the
case of a culture that was, at least in its



early stages, devoid of metals to make a
reliable ‘standard’ against which others
could be set. Alexander Thom himself
could think of no reliable way of passing
on the Megalithic Yard without some
variation being inevitable across time.
We eventually reasoned that it
would be possible to turn ‘time’ into
‘distance’ by way of the turning Earth.
The speed of the Earth on its axis is as
accurate a yard stick for the passing of
time as anyone could reasonably require
for most purposes. Of course we can’t



see the Earth turning but we can see its
effects. The Sun, Moon and stars
appear to rise from below the horizon in
the east, to pass over our heads and
then set in the west. In fact, although
the Moon and planets do have
independent movement, the Sun and
the stars are not really moving at all
(actually they are moving slightly but
we need not concern ourselves with this
for our present purposes).
The apparent motion of the stars is
caused by the Earth turning on its axis



and it is this fact that offers us an
accurate clock which, with a little
ingenuity, we can turn into a replicable
linear unit of measurement. In the case
of the Megalithic Yard we eventually
discovered that the pendulum upon
which it is based was set not by viewing
any star but the planet Venus. Venus is,
like the Earth, orbiting the Sun. As a
result, when seen from the Earth, it has
a complex series of movements against
the backdrop of the stars. Sometimes
Venus rises before the Sun, at which
times it is called a morning star, and at



other times it rises after the Sun and is
then known as an evening star. This is
purely a line-of-sight situation, caused
by the fact that both Venus and the
Earth are orbiting the Sun. When Venus
crosses the face of the Sun to become an
evening star, it is moving ‘against’ the
direction followed by the backdrop of
stars. It is within this observable fact
that setting the Megalithic pendulum
becomes possible.
In order to create the Megalithic
Yard one has to follow the simple rules



below:
Venus must be observable as an
evening star, setting after the Sun and
during that period at which it is moving
at its fastest counter to the backdrop of
stars.
The sky is divided into 366 parts.
This can be achieved by trial and error,
as explained in Uriel’s Machine44 and
also in Civilization One45 but is also
achievable through a neat little
mathematical trick demonstrated
below.



1. 1. Stand in an
unobstructed
position on a
wide open
piece of
ground with a
good view of
the western
horizon.
2. Place a stick in
the ground
(stick A) and
stand facing



west with one
of your heels
touching the
stick.
3. Now take 233
steps, heel to
toe, towards
the west. Upon
completing the
233 steps,
place a second
stick in the
ground (stick



B) in front of
your toe.
4. Turn to the
north and
place your heel
against stick B.
Now take four
heel-to-toe
steps to the
north and then
place a third
stick (stick C)
in the ground



in front of
your toe.
5. The distance
between sticks
B and C, when
viewed from A
will now be
1/366th of the
horizon.
It is now necessary to make a braced
wooden frame of the type shown in
figures 14 and 15, which is as wide as
the gap between B and C. This must be



set on poles in such a way that it gains
significant height and can be altered in
its angle.
The purpose of this exercise is so
that the angle of the braced frame can
be identical to that of the planet Venus
as it falls towards its setting position.
Standing at A it is now necessary to
observe Venus passing through the gap
in the braced frame whilst swinging a
pendulum and noting the number of
swings achieved as Venus passes
through the gap. A pendulum that



swings 366 times during this occurrence
must be 1/2 of a Megalithic Yard in
length (41.48cm). The cord of this
length represents the full Megalithic
Yard of 82.966cm in length.
Figure 14



F igure15
In this way the Megalithic Yard
can be reproduced on any site where
observation of Venus, when at the right
part of its cycle, can be achieved. For the
use of the braced frame we are grateful
to the considerations of Professor Archie



Roy, Emeritus Professor of Astronomy
at Glasgow University.
Although pendulums differ
slightly with latitude and altitude,
because gravity also alters slightly, we
have shown that the Megalithic Yard
achieved using this method will remain
within the tolerances discovered by
Alexander Thom from Orkney in the
north to Brittany in the south, in other
words across the whole area containing
monuments surveyed by Alexander
T hom .



The method used by the Sumerians to
set their own basic unit of length, the
double kush, followed the same general
rules as those employed by the
Megalithic peoples of the far west of
Europe. The only difference lay in the



numbers used.
Sumerians relied on a 360o
geometry, of the type we still use today.
Because of this their starting point was
to divide the horizon into 360 equal
units. The mathematical trick used to
short-circuit this procedure that was
itemised in Appendix One does not
apply in this case. It is possible that the
Sumerians devised their own method of
making the initial procedure quicker,
but in any case theirs was a metal-using
culture and one that would therefore



not have needed to repeat the procedure
of defining the linear unit all that often.
They could have created a fairly
accurate standard rod. Establishing the
necessary 1/360th of the horizon by trial
and error would have taken time, but it
is quite possible to achieve with a high
degree of accuracy.
The procedures used in the
preceding Appendix are now followed.
The braced frame would be equal to a
gap of 1/360th of the horizon but Venus
would be tracked in exactly the same



way. The desired number of swings in
this case is 240, which is the same as
240 seconds, a period of time known to
the Sumerians as a ‘gesh’. A pendulum
that swung 240 times during the
passage of Venus through the braced
frame would be 99.88 cm in length, a
linear length that conforms to that
discovered on the statues of Gudea
from Lagesh in Iraq. This unit of length
was known to the Sumerians as the
double kush.
It has to be noted that the



pendulum in question is not strictly
speaking a seconds pendulum of the
sort that was popularly used from the
seventeenth to the nineteenth century.
Because the object being tracked is
Venus, which is moving independently
against the backdrop of stars, the time
taken for each beat of the pendulum is
slightly longer than a second (1.002
seconds). This stands as part of the
proof that the Sumerians did use this
system to define their linear unit. They
fully understood that there were 43,200
seconds in a day (to us there are twice



this number because we use a twenty
four-hour day instead of the Sumerian
twelve-hour day) but there is no
absolutely reliable way of defining the
true second of time by observing the sky
and swinging a pendulum. This could
only be achieved by tracking the average
movement of the Sun in the same way
Venus is used in this exercise. However,
because of the Earth’s own orbital
characteristics, the Sun does appear to
move at a constant speed across the sky.
There are only a few days each year on
which the experiment using the Sun



would work perfectly and the
Sumerians could not have known which
days would have been appropriate. In
addition, the Sun is very much more
difficult, and potentially dangerous, to
track in this way.
Similarly, if they had used a star
instead of the planet Venus, the
pendulum would still not have been a
true seconds pendulum. The reason for
this is that the sidereal day (a day that is
measured by a star passing from one
point in the sky back to that point



again) is shorter than a solar day (a day
that is measured by the Sun passing
from one position in the sky back to
that point again). A seconds pendulum
created by tracking a star would actually
give a time reading of 0.997 seconds
and lead to a pendulum length close to
99.3cm .
We remain convinced that both
the Megalithic culture and that of the
Sumerians were simply following
instructions that had been given to
them by another agency. In the case of



the Sumerians the use of Venus for
setting their pendulum, and therefore
their chosen unit of length, resulted in a
series of measurements that were truly
integrated with the Earth. As we have
shown, the Sumerian double mana unit
of mass divides into the mass of the
Earth
6,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000
times, which would not have been the
case with a shorter pendulum and
therefore a lighter unit of mass. True,
the achieved second of time was slightly
at odds with the genuine second of



time, but the Sumerians, lacking
accurate clocks, could not have been
aware of this fact. In fact the
discrepancy is so small it couldn’t have
been measured until the last century or
so.



The message that we have detected is
present in recurring number sequences
that are, strangely, often round
numbers. We started to realize that
something highly unusual was
happening when we discovered that the



Megalithic system of geometry worked
on the Moon and the Sun as well as the
Earth.
Looking into issues concerning the
Moon we were immediately reminded
of the strange coincidence that the
Moon and the Sun appear to be the
same size in Earth’s skies, leading to the
phenomenon we call a total eclipse. Still
stranger is the fact that the relation is so
numerically neat with the Moon being
400 times smaller than the Sun and 400
times closer to the Earth at the point of



a total eclipse. On its own this could be
a bizarre coincidence, but because of
what follows we believe that it is the
‘headline’ to a message built into the
Moon 4.6 billion years ago.



The Megalithic system
The Megalithic system of geometry is
based on 366° to a circle, sixty minutes
to a degree and six seconds to a minute.
This sequence produces a second of arc
on the Earth’s polar circumference that
is 366 Megalithic Yards long, the linear
measure of the Megalithic builders as
identified by Alexander Thom.
As a cross-reference we had also
discovered that the 4,000-year-old
Minoan Foot is precisely equal to a



1,000th part of a Megalithic second of
arc.
We applied the principles of
Megalithic geometry to all of the planets
and moons in the solar system and
found that it only produced round
integer results for the Sun and the
Moon.
The Sun is very close to being a
true sphere, certainly much more so
than the Earth. NASA quote the mean
volumetric circumference as being
4,373,096km, which we converted into



Megalithic Yards and applied the 366
geom etry.
Sun’s circumference
= 5,270,913,968
MY
One degree =
14,401,404 MY
One minute =
240,023 MY
One second =
40,003.8 MY
The fit is 99.99per cent accurate to
40,000 and given that this is based on a



best estimate of the mean circumference
it has to be considered bang on.
Like the Sun, the Moon is quite
close to being a sphere. NASA gives the
mean volumetric circumference of
10,914.5km, which produces the
following result:
Moon’s
circumference =
13155300 MY
One degree = 35943
MY
One minute = 599



MY
One second = 99.83
MY
If we use the equatorial radius the result
is 99.9 MY per second of lunar arc.
Either way, this is as close to 100 MY as
makes no difference, given the irregular
surface of the Moon and the small
variation in Thom’s definition of the
Megalithic Yard of +/- 0.061cm.
It could have been possible for
people many thousands of years ago to
create a system of geometry that



produces round integers for two celestial
objects such as the Earth and the Sun,
but it would seem impossible to achieve
such a feat for three bodies. It therefore
appears that the Moon was designed
using units derived from the physical
dimensions of the Sun and the Earth.



The Earth–Moon
relationship
The duration of the Moon’s orbit
(sidereal – fixed star to fixed star) is
27.322 Earth days (27.396 rotations of
the Earth). This number is
extraordinarily close to the size
relationship of the Moon to the Earth,
being 27.31 per cent of the Earth’s size.
The Earth currently turns on its
axis 366.259 times for each orbit
around the Sun. This number is



extraordinarily close to the size
relationship of the Earth to the Moon,
being 366.175per cent larger than the
Moon.
There is no reason why these
numbers should repeat in this way:
Earth turns
per orbit
per cent size of polar
circum ference
Earth 366.259 27.31



Moon 27.396 366.175
It is also a consequence of the above
that the Moon makes 366 orbits of the
Earth in 10,000 Earth days.
The size of the Sun, Earth and
Moon have been fixed for billions of
years so their size ratios have not
changed. But the orbital characteristics
of the Earth and the Moon have
changed constantly.
When the Moon was much closer
to the Earth than it is now, its orbit was



much shorter and the Earth day was
also shorter, leading to perhaps as
much as 600 days to the Earth year.
The Earth’s own orbit around the Sun
remains essentially unchanged. It is
only the time it takes to spin on its own
axis that alters.
The close number association
between the size ratios of the Sun, Moon
and Earth, and the orbital
characteristics of the Moon, together
with the present length of the Earth day,
are only applicable to the time that



humans have been fully formed. These
relationships were not present in the
distant past and they will disappear in
the distant future. The number
sequences which alerted us to the
‘message’ are clearly meant for the
present period.



The Metric System
Orbital characteristics and size
relationships are physical factors and
any correlations are real – no matter
what units of measurement are
employed. No one knows the origin of
the Megalithic system but the origin of
the metric system is fully documented.
Whilst it did have a near identical
precursor in the Sumerian system of
more than 4,000 years earlier, the
metric system is known to have been
developed from measuring the polar



circumference of the Earth alone.
It was designed so that there
should be 40,000km in one Earth
circumference. The equator is a little
longer than the polar circumference but
basically the Earth turns through this
distance each day.
The Moon turns through an
unimpressive sounding 10,920.8
kilometres every 27.3217 days. This
converts to 400km per Earth day – to
an accuracy greater than 99.9 per cent.
Again this is a factor that only exists in



the human period of existence.
The number 400 is already central
to human appreciation of the Moon
because it is 400 times closer to us than
the Sun, and it is 400 times smaller.
The use of 400 kilometres per current
Earth day could be a message that the
architect of the Moon knew we would
use kilometres and mean solar days.
Metric units apart, the Moon is
turning at a rate that is almost exactly
one per cent of the Earth’s rotation. Or
to reverse the factor, the Earth is turning



100 times as fast as the Moon. All
curiously round values!
To add to the idea that this is a
deliberate piece of metric design, the
Moon is also travelling on its journey
around the Earth at a steady rate of one
kilometre per second! This speed varies
a little as it travels but does not drop
below 0.964km per second and does
not exceed 1.076km per second.
And there is something else very
special about the kilometre as regards
the Moon. To understand it we need to



realize that there are 109.2 Earth
diameters across the Sun’s diameter.
There are also 109.2 Sun diameters
between the Earth and the Sun at its
furthest point of orbit.
The circumference of the Moon is
109.2 x 100 kilometres.
Is that not odd in the extreme?
One way of looking at the
association between these ratios and
numbers can be seen in the diagram in
figure 16.



There are many factors here that
should bear no relationship with each
other at all. Taken in isolation, any one
of these strange associations might be
considered to be a coincidence but there
comes a time, however, when
coincidences become so frequent that
something else must be at work.






Figure 16



The awesome sight of a black shadow
gradually crossing the face of the Moon
still captivates most people, even
though we now live in an age when we
not only know what causes the
phenomenon but can predict exactly



when it is likely to happen. Early
cultures did not know either and must
have seriously thought, for a few
minutes at least, that the world was
coming to an end.
Back in the 1960s the astronomer
Gerald Hawkins suggested that at least
one of the functions of the structure at
Stonehenge, Salisbury Plain, England,
was to predict the occurrence of eclipses.
Hawkins had carefully studied the
ancient monument, parts of which date
back five thousand years, and subjected



his data to a massive number
crunching computer. He came to the
conclusion that the Aubrey Holes, a
series of fifty-six chalk-filled pits around
the standing stones at Stonehenge,
represented a sophisticated device for
predicting both solar and lunar
eclipses.46
Clay tablets discovered in what is
now Iraq and dating back to the
Sumerian period, which commenced
around 3000 BC, indicate that people in
the region were doing their best to



predict eclipses. And there isn’t any
doubt at all that the Babylonians who
followed the Sumerians were competent
at accurately working out when the face
of the Sun or Moon would darken.
The ancient Chinese, Indians,
Egyptians, American cultures and many
other societies worked hard to develop
an understanding of rudimentary
astronomy for the purpose of eclipse
prediction. This single effort certainly
caused humanity to significantly
improve its naked-eye astronomy and



its understanding of mathematics.
There are good reasons why this should
be the case and at the base of most of
them is power. Any would-be ruler,
secular or religious, who could predict
when an eclipse was likely to take place
was in a very strong position to
manipulate the situation to his or her
own ends.
To the average lay person, eclipses
seem to be totally haphazard but this is
not the case. However, such is the
complicated nature of the interplay of



the Earth and the Sun that
understanding eclipse patterns is far
from easy. Once the pattern is cracked,
its secrets could be passed from one
ruler to another and a whole society
could be alerted to a possible eclipse.
The prediction itself would have seemed
to most people to be the most
sophisticated sort of magic and when
the king or holy man drove away the
dark dragon that was trying to swallow
the Sun or causing the Moon to bleed,
his power would be ensured for a
considerable period ahead.



What the ancients gradually
discovered was that there were very
definite patterns to the occurrence of all
eclipses and that they were governed
overall by a specific period of time that
is known as the ‘saros cycle’. The word
saros was first used by the astronomer
Edmond Halley (1656–1742) and is
supposed to have been derived from a
Babylonian word. The saros cycle is
6,585.3 days in length (18 years, 11
days, 8 hours). It represents the coming
together of three distinct patterns. The
first of these is the Synodic Month (new



Moon to new Moon,) the second is the
Draconian Month (node to node [see
below for information on Moon’s
nodes]) and the third is the Anomalistic
Month (perigee to perigee [see below for
information on Moon’s perigee]).
To within about two hours, 223
synodic months, 242 draconian months
and 239 anomalistic months come out
to the same period of time and it is at
this point that any eclipse will repeat
itself. The reason for this is that the
solar system runs pretty much like a



gearbox and, as with a gearbox, any
pattern created now will sooner or later
be repeated.
Although the saros cycle is very
accurate, there are many such cycles
running at the same time. All that can
be deduced from the saros cycle is that
if an eclipse occurs today, it will occur
again in 6,585.3 days and will have a
quite similar geometry. The system
does fall down somewhat in that it splits
a day and so future eclipses in any given
cycle may not be fully visible from the



same part of the globe. Each saros cycle
runs for around 1,200 years (around
sixty-six repeat eclipses) until it expends
itself. If the saros cycle commences near
the South Pole it will extend itself
gradually further north with each
eclipse until it finally disappears at the
North Pole. The same is true in reverse.
It would appear that the
Babylonians understood the saros cycle,
as did the Ancient Greeks. So, according
to Gerald Hawkins, did the builders of
Stonehenge. Something akin to the



saros cycle would have been useful to
ancient peoples because if the next
eclipse in any given series was less
impressive than the last, it would still
have been predicted, and it was just as
likely to be more impressive as less so.
(Better by far to turn the tribes out for a
less-than-spectacular display than to
miss what could be a super show!)
Our own previous research
demonstrates that following the saros
cycle was actually very easy for the
Megalithic people, who were the



builders of Stonehenge and thousands
of other such monuments. The ritual
year of the Megalithic cultures was 366
days in length. This meant that the
saros cycle to them was just two days
short of eighteen years in length. The
two days didn’t really matter because
solar eclipses can only occur at the new
Moon and lunar eclipses at the full
Moon. In other words, just a couple of
days short of eighteen years after a
particular eclipse, the next full or new
Moon would be certain to bring
another.



Even today we don’t take solar
eclipses for granted. A major eclipse,
such as the one that was visible in
northern Europe on August 11th 1999 is
treated as a time of celebration and is
now revered for its sheer beauty, rather
than being feared as was surely the case
even not so long ago. The face of the
Sun gradually begins to blacken as the
Moon passes between it and the Earth.
If it is a full eclipse the Sun’s disc will be
covered at what is known as totality. At
totality, all that is perceptible is the faint
glow from the corona of the Sun. Soon



after, the shadow begins to move away
and a spectacular shaft of light breaks
out, forming what is known as the
diamond ring effect. The phenomenon
is just as impressive now as it must have
looked from Babylon or Stonehenge.
It might surprise readers to learn
that no matter where our astronauts or
cosmonauts travel in the future within
our solar system, they will never stand
on the surface of any other planet and
watch a total eclipse. They are simply
not possible anywhere else and only



occur as a legacy of a series of
breathtaking, apparent coincidences.
The fit of the Moon’s disc across the
face of the Sun during a total eclipse is
not ‘near’ – it is ‘exact ’– and this fact
should be the greatest sense of wonder
to anyone viewing such an event
because it is very unlikely. No other
planet has a moon anywhere near big
enough or orbiting at the right distance
to fully, but not too fully, eclipse the
Sun.
There are two basic sorts of eclipse,



and then subcategories within the two
types. The most impressive form of
eclipse is known as a solar eclipse. The
drawing below shows what is actually
happening when a solar eclipse takes
place.
Figure 17
When the Moon stands directly between the Earth
and the Sun, a total eclipse is possible but totality



only occurs across a relatively small area of the
Earth’s surface and follows a curve known as the Path
of Totality.
In this example, which is a ‘total
eclipse’, to a proportion of those people
living along the path of totality, the disc
of the Sun will be blotted out
completely. Whilst totality is achieved,
all that can be seen is the sun’s corona
(the halo of bright matter that is
constantly being thrown off by the
Sun). The larger shadow is called the
penumbra and people beneath this will
see a partial eclipse. There is another



form of solar eclipse that can never be
total and this is known as an annular
eclipse. The Moon is 1/400th part the
size of the Sun and it stands at 1/400th
the distance between the Earth and the
Sun, but not always exactly.
The Moon’s orbit around the
Earth is not circular but elliptical. This
means that sometimes the Moon is
slightly closer to the Earth than it is at
other times. If a solar eclipse takes place
when the Moon is furthest from the
Earth, the Moon’s disc looks smaller



and can never totally blot out the Sun.
Total eclipses of the Sun therefore
happen when the Moon is on the part
of its orbit that brings it closest to the
Earth. When the Moon is closest to
Earth it is said to be at perigee and when
it is furthest away it is at apogee.
Solar eclipses can only take place
when the Moon stands between the
Earth and the Sun and this is the short
period on each lunar cycle known as
‘new Moon’. (The time of the lunar
month when no part of the Moon is



visible from Earth.)
It might be thought that because
there is a new Moon each month, there
should therefore be a solar eclipse each
month but this is not the case. The orbit
of the Moon around the Earth does not
follow the same angle as the orbit of the
Earth around the Sun. If it did, every
new Moon would indeed bring a solar
eclipse. Rather it is tilted to the Earth’s
orbit (known as the ecliptic) by five
degrees. Only when new Moon occurs at
a point when the orbit of the Moon



around the Earth crosses that of the
Earth around the Sun, can a solar
eclipse take place. These points north
and south of the ecliptic are called the
Moon’s nodes. This happens ‘at least’
twice each year and can produce a solar
eclipse observable from somewhere on
the Earth.
The second type of eclipse is not
quite so impressive as a solar eclipse but
it would have been fascinating to our
ancient ancestors all the same. It is
more common than a solar eclipse and



is known as a lunar eclipse. A lunar
eclipse takes place when the shadow of
the Earth comes between the Sun and
the Moon. A lunar eclipse can only take
place at the exact opposite time to a
solar eclipse, at the time of the full
Moon when the entire disc of the Moon
is visible from Earth.
During a lunar eclipse the face of
the Moon does not disappear
altogether. Rather it is darkened and,
under some circumstances, it appears to
turn a deep red. Such lunar eclipses



were seen by many ancient cultures as
terrible harbingers of disaster and were
probably feared as much as solar
eclipses.
Figure 18
The path taken by the Earth around the Sun is not
the same as that taken by the Moon around the Earth.
There is a 5° difference. Because of this, total eclipses



can only happen when new Moons fall on what is
known as the node – that point at which the two
orbits cross.
Figure 19
A lunar eclipse takes place when the Earth’s shadow
crosses the face of the Moon at the time of full Moon.
Once again the fact that the plane of the Earth’s orbit
around the Sun and that of the Moon around the
Earth are not the same prevents every full Moon from
being eclipsed.



Until we did some in-depth
research we never realized just how
unlikely or extraordinary a total eclipse
actually was. It’s all a matter of ‘line of
sight’ as the diagrams below should
make clear. Isaac Asimov, the famed
science-fiction guru, described this
perfect visual alignment as being: ‘The
most unlikely coincidence imaginable’.



Figure 20
In this example the eye on the right looks past a small
sphere to a much larger sphere. The size of the spheres
and the distance between them is such that because of
the perspective to the viewer the small sphere will
exactly cover the large sphere.
Figure 21
Now the small sphere is even smaller, but is at the
same distance from the eye of the observer. Under
these circumstances the eye will also see part of the
larger sphere. Finally, if we keep the spheres the same



as in the last example, but move the smaller one
nearer to the eye of the observer we once again create
a situation in which the small sphere appears to
exactly cover the large one.
Figure 22
The sphere of the Sun is almost exactly 400 times
larger than that of the Moon. This in itself might be
considered nothing more than a strange but
meaningless coincidence but we must stretch
coincidence almost to breaking point when we realize
that when the Moon is as close to the Earth as its orbit
will bring it, it stands at 1/400th the distance between



the Earth and the Sun. Under these circumstances
when it stands precisely between the observer and the
Sun, the Moon ‘must’ exactly cover the disc of the Sun
– it is a simple matter of perspective.
In the case of total eclipses we
really are living in a tiny snapshot of the
history of the Earth and the Moon. The
Moon was very much closer to Earth at
the beginning of the relationship, and
by the time the two reach a situation of
perfect stasis the Moon will be 1.6 times
further away from the Earth than it
presently is. If we estimate the Moon to
be 4 billion years in age and then accept



the most common assessment that it
will reach its furthest position from the
Earth in 15 billion years (excluding the
fact that the Sun will most certainly
have gobbled up both Earth and Moon
by then) the sum total of the Moon’s
journey from closest to furthest from
the Earth is 19 billion years. The Moon
is a finite size, as to all intents and
purposes is the Sun. There can only be a
very short window of opportunity
during which the disc of the Moon can
cover that of the Sun, as seen from
Earth, in the truly perfect way that it



does right now. That it has done so just
at the time we have evolved into a
sophisticated enough species to
recognize and study the fact seems
almost incredible. It doesn’t matter how
much experts say ‘It’s just one of those
things’, it is still an example of one of
the most unlikely coincidences
im aginable.
It stands to reason that if the
Moon were any larger or smaller than it
is, total solar eclipses would not be
possible at this time. A smaller Moon



would have brought such phenomena
in the very distant past, when the Moon
was much closer to the Earth than it is
now.
This brings us to a discussion of
the dimensions of the Moon. In
comparison with the size of its host
planet the Moon is huge. Its
circumference would only fit into that
of the Earth 3.66 times. Another of the
terrestrial type planets, Mars, has two
moons, but they are tiny when set
against Earth’s Moon, which in terms of



size might reasonably be termed a
planetoid. Even bearing in mind the
vast size of the planetary super-giants,
with their proliferation of moons,
Earth’s Moon is still the fifth largest in
the whole solar system.
A close examination of Moon rock,
brought back by both American
astronauts and Soviet unmanned
missions, shows that they are very
similar to specific rocks on the Earth.
Analysis of the rocks proves that they
were created at the same distance from



the Sun, so there is no longer any real
doubt that the Earth and the Moon
have a common origin. Yet there is
something very strange about the Moon
that isn’t easy to explain. Although it is
1/3rd as big as the Earth it has only
1/81st of the Earth’s mass.
Had the Moon been composed of
a representative sample of ‘all’ Earth’s
rocks and still been the size it is, it
would have been much more massive.
Conversely, if the Moon had exactly the
same composition as the Earth and had



exerted the gravitational pull it presently
does, it would have been very much
smaller in size.
These facts are discussed in greater
detail elsewhere, but it is the weird
composition of the Moon, which is
comprised of very light, Earth-type
rocks, that means it can be large enough
to create a total solar eclipse and yet not
rip the surface of the Earth to pieces
with its gravitational pull every time it
passes overhead.
In a Universe filled with incredible



wonders, and one so big that it might as
well be infinite as far as we are
concerned, we are certain to stumble
across what looks to us like outrageous
coincidences. Even conservative
astronomers admit that total eclipses
are very unlikely but still maintain such
happenings must be a random chance
event. We beg to differ!



The previous work we had undertaken
for our book Civilization One had
featured a number of ancient
measuring systems. None of these
surprised us more than that created by
the Sumerians, a culture that originated



in what is presently known as Iraq at
about the same time as the Megalithic
culture was flourishing in Britain and
France. Our ongoing work for the
present book made us look again at
some aspects of the Sumerian
measuring system. It could be that yet
another part of the message left to us,
indicating a deliberate intervention into
the origin and progress of humanity, is
encapsulated within the methods the
Sumerians used to measure their world.
Out of a plethora of different linear



lengths, weights and measures, it was
possible for us to reconstruct the entire
Sumerian system as we are sure it was
originally meant to be. We have
demonstrated how the Sumerians used
a pendulum and the planet Venus in
order to establish the basic unit of linear
length, which was known as the double
kush. Existent statues of the Sumerian
King Gudea demonstrate that the
double kush was intended to measure
99.88cm. Units of volume and weight
were derived from the double kush by
creating a cube with sides of 1/10th of a



double kush. The amount of pure water
held by such a cube represented the sila,
which was the Sumerian unit for
measuring volume. The weight of this
water was known as the mana or mina
and was the Sumerian unit for
measuring mass. How we untangled all
of this from the Sumerian records is
explained in detail in our book
Civilization One.47
There seemed to be no doubt that
the double kush had indeed been
created by way of a pendulum and



observations of the planet Venus but it
was not the only way the Sumerian
system could be recreated. Everything in
the system also relied on the size, shape
and weight of a humble barley seed.
To the Sumerians a barley seed
was known as a se. Until our own
investigations, many experts had
believed that the use of the barley seed
by the Sumerians for measuring
purposes was probably an abstraction. It
was generally considered that the
Sumerians might originally have used



such seeds (as was the case in ancient
western Europe), but that as in the case
of Europe the seeds ultimately came to
be words representing sizes and weights
that no longer related to barley seeds at
all.
The Sumerians claimed that 360
barley seeds was the measure of the
double kush, something that experts on
the Sumerian culture actively deny or at
best have totally ignored.
Our extensive investigations
showed conclusively why this state of



affairs had come about. Experts had
undoubtedly assumed that if the
Sumerians had used barley seeds as tiny
units of length, they must have laid the
seeds end to end. It is likely to be for
this reason that it is now generally
considered that the seeds themselves
eventually lost all contact with units of
measure, because when they are laid
end to end they make no sense at all.
However, we discovered that if the seeds
were laid on their sides and front to
back (as they may have been carefully
strung on a necklace) they conformed



absolutely to the Sumerian system.
We then went on to demonstrate,
by practical experiment, that the
Sumerians had also been quite correct
in their estimation of the ‘weight’ of an
average barley seed and we were
staggered to discover that even modern
barley seeds have almost exactly the
same dimensions and weight as their
Sumerian counterparts.
It has been possible to show that in
terms of mass measurement the whole
Sumerian system was irrevocably and



seemingly quite deliberately tied to the
overall mass of the Earth itself. We
appreciate that this sounds absolutely
absurd for such an early culture but
when one sees the figures involved, there
is no doubt about it.
According to Sumerian texts it was
considered that there were 10,800 barley
seeds to the unit of weight known as the
‘mana’. The weight of water held in the
double mana, assuming a double kush
of 99.88cm and a cube with sides of
1/10th of this, would have been 996.4



gram s.
The mass of the Earth is held to be
5.976 x 1024 kg. If we divide this by
.9964 in order to establish how many
double mana there are to the mass of
the Earth, we arrive at 5.99759 x 1024
double mana. This number is so close
to 6 x 1024 (99.99per cent) that this
must surely have been the number
intended. Since there are 10.800 barley
seeds to the mana and therefore 21,600
to the double mana it is possible to
show that the mass of the Earth is equal



to that of 1.296 x 1029 barley seeds. This
might not seem to be a particularly
impressive number but it has some very
important properties.
If we were to segment the Earth, as
we might an orange, we would discover
that each 1/360th segment of the Earth
has a mass equal to 3.6 x 1026 barley
seeds. A further split of sixty brings us to
6 x 1024 barley seeds and yet another
split of sixty results in 1 x 1023 barley
seeds, which can be expressed fully as
100,000,000,000,000,000, 000,000.



The starting point of this exercise
was an Earth mass of 6 x 1024 double
mana for the mass of the Earth, which
would have been highly significant in
Sumerian terms since there’s was a
sexagesimal (sixty base) system.
For all the reasons explained in
Civilization One, we cannot accept that
this state of affairs is a coincidence.
What we have with the Sumerian
system is a fully integrated way of
measuring length, volume, mass, area
and time, using the same number bases



in each case. The whole system can be
constructed from a pendulum set by
the movements of Venus across one
degree of arc of the horizon or else from
the bottom up with nothing more
complicated than barley seeds.
The real question has to be
whether or not the Sumerians
themselves could have possibly known
just how incredible their measuring
systems were? We are left with the
impression that the system would have
been very useful in the marketplace and



on the farm in order to ensure equity of
measurement throughout Sumerian
society but that it is highly unlikely that
the Sumerian Priests could have known
the dimensions of the Earth, let alone its
mass. It is most likely that both
concepts would have been absolutely
alien to them.
This appears to be yet another
example of direct and deliberate
intervention into the development of
humanity. In other words, as their own
mythology demonstrates, someone



‘taught’ the Sumerians about weights
and measures and told them the
numbers to use. By so doing they
supplied the Sumerians with one of the
hallmarks of true civilization, namely
an integrated and replicable measuring
system. At the same time, the use of the
barley seeds added to a significant series
of messages about these events in
prehistory that were intended for our
consumption. Since it seems unlikely
that a cereal grain as widespread and
useful as barley could, by chance,
behave in the way that it does in terms



of its size and weight, it seems very
likely to us that the crop was genetically
engineered. It was used by the
Sumerians for bread but also brewed
into a beer that was drunk for many
centuries across the whole of civilization.
