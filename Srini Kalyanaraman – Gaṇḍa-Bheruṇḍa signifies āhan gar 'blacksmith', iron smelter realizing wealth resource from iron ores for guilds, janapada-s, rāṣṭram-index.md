& Gaṇḍa-Bheruṇḍa tradition from ca. 2500 BCE https://tinyurl.com/y58mjjzd
"...anthropomorphic Gaṇḍa-Bheruṇḍa that makes its first known appearance on the monuments of South India in the Jagadekamallasvara temple in Karnataka’s Shimoga district. Patronised by the Chalukya rulers of Kalyani, the Gaṇḍa-Bheruṇḍa is etched on a tall pillar fronting the temple. Colonial surveyors record the figure as crushing an elephant in its talons, an iconography that matches with the legend in the adjoining fields, that the GaṇḍaBheruṇḍa protects the farmers’ fields from getting ravaged by wild elephants.
Its fierceness therefore lent the Gaṇḍa-Bheruṇḍa apotropaic functions and this is why it mostly figures in liminal spaces in temples. The promise of powerful protection made GaṇḍaBheruṇḍa a title fit for the kings. The Hoysala (feudatories of the Chalukyas) ruler Vira Ballala Deva II, had Gaṇḍa-Bheruṇḍa as one of his many titles. The popularity of the motif can be attested by this well-known South Indian legend which states that in order to control Vishnu in his Narasimha avatar (half man, half lion), Shiva assumed the avatar of another mythical beast, Sarabha (part lion part bird). The fight ended when Vishnu assumed the form of a Gaṇḍa-Bheruṇḍa and conquered the Sarabha. This legend led to the depiction of the motif on Hoysala temples, at times crushing a Sarabha, which in turn is devouring a lion, who is in turn destroying an elephant..."

Hoysala Empire between the 11th and 14th centuries. Chennakesava temple was commissioned by Hoysala Emperor Vishnuvardhana in 1117 CE. An inscription refers to it as Vijaynarayana temple.
Hoysala are from a region called Malenadu in the Western Ghats, known for being experts in warfare techniques.
"It is interesting to note that a number of sculptures in the shrine are inscribed with the names of the sculptors, Each maestro describes his skill with a terse, rightfully-boastful, self styled epithet that indicates keen rivalry among the Hoysala sculptors. Dasoja, the master sculptor signs himself as “ smiter of the crowd of titled sculptors’. a’ bherumda to the Sarabha’s rival sculptors and a ‘bee at the lotus feet of Lord Dharmesvara of Balligramme’., Malligna styles himself as the “Tiger among sculptors’., Padari Malloja calls himself as a ‘pair of large scissors tied to the necks of titled sculptors’., While Chikka Hampa was the ‘ champion over rival sculptors’,. Nagoja was ‘ confounder of sculptors.’ Some other sculptors of note are Dasoja’s are Dasoja’s son Chavana, kencha Malligna. etc." -- Excerpt from History of Chennakeshava Swamy temple, Govt. of Karnataka webpage, Hindu Religious Institutions and Charitable Endowments department

The varying sculptural metaphors designed by different sculptors exemplify the freedom the sculptors enjoyed -- e.g. bherumda sculptors juxtaposed to sarabha rival sculptors -- to interpret the metaphors of Indus Script hieroglyphs and render them in sculptural expressions in stone.

According to a Kannada folklore, there was a young man called Sala who saved his Guru from a tiger by striking with a sword. Since “strike” in old Kannada was called “Hoy”, hence, the name Hoysala. "Hoy means strike while Sala refers to the name of a forefather of this dynasty who saved a saint from a lion by striking him dead..." https://amp.blog.ehokkaido.in/7051661/1/chennakeshava-temple-belur.html

Gaṇḍa-Bheruṇḍa, a two-headed mythological bird
Gaṇḍa-Bheruṇḍa (Gun-daa-bhae-rundaa, from Kannada) is an Indian mythological bird. It is always shown with two heads and beaks, and believed to possess magnificient strength. The Wodeyars, the erstwhile kings of Mysore, used the bird as their royal logo, and beautiful paintings of the bird can be found in the period art.

The Bellagavi iron pillar was erected by Mahamandalesvara Chamunda Rayarasa (under Kalyani Chalukya king Somesvara I) in 1047CE. Called Garudakhamba, anthropomorph Gandabherunda statue was supposed to be stand on top, as capital of this pillar.

The Chennakeshava temple at Somanathapura was consecrated in 1258 CE by Somanatha Dandanayaka, a general of the Hoysala King Narasimha III. It is located 38 kilometres (24 mi) east of Mysuru city. Somanathapura town was founded in the 13th century by a general named Somanatha (Someya Dandanayaka in some inscriptions). He was working for the Hoysala King Narasimha III. (HS Usharani (2012), Somanathapura temples and their oil requirements in epigraphs, Proceedings of the Indian History Congress, Vol. 73 (2012), pp. 486-489).
Association of the Hoysala dynasty with Somanatha is significant and is consistent with the reference to भारुण्ड ाम of Samaveda. See:Gaṇḍa-Bheruṇḍa tradition is a continuum
from भारुण्ड ाम and R̥ gveda R̥ ca 1.94.1, veneration of metalwork expertise of artisans https://tinyurl.com/y3vh5uzw
I have argued that Gaṇḍa-Bheruṇḍa is a metaphor for the wealth resource of ferrite, iron ores of Sahyadri ranges near Bellagavi and that the double-headed eagle signifies Indus Script hypertext of hieroglyphs: śyēna derived from Meluhha aśáni 'hail, thunderbolt' aśáni f. ʻ thunderbolt ʼ RV.,  ̊nī -- f.

Thus, I submit that Gaṇḍa-Bheruṇḍa signifies a blacksmith working with iron stone, ferrites ores (of Sahyadri range iron mines). The city near Belgaum is called Karnataka University town of Dharwar which is derived from धावड dhāvaḍa 'iron smelter'; Two heads of the eagle" dula 'pair' rebus: dul 'metal casting' PLUS the human body ligatured to the doubleeagle: धावड dhāvaḍa 'iron smelter' signifies अहन्-गार् धावड dhāvaḍa 'blacksmith, iron smelter, metal caster'.
The juxtaposition of lion, elephant (in contest) with the śyēna derived from Meluhha aśáni 'hail, thunderbolt' rebus: ahan 'iron' is a juxtaposition of two other wealth resources: ibha 'elephant' rebus: ib 'iron' resource; and simha 'lion' rebus: சிங் கச்சுவணம் ciṅka-c-cuvaṇam , n. prob. siṃhala + svarṇa.

I submit that Gaṇḍa-Bheruṇḍa tradition is a continuum from भारुण्ड ाम and R̥ gveda R̥ ca 1.94.1, which venerate metalwork expertise of artisans -- working with iron and chariots and which constitute wealth resources of the guilds and janapada-s. https://tinyurl.com/y3vh5uzw
From sculptural depictions of शरभः śarabhaḥ, the compositions are combinations of
hieroglyphs which signify wealth resources: शरभः śarabhaḥ is composed of: karabha 'camel' rebus: karba 'iron'; ibha 'elephant' rebus: ib 'iron'; simha 'lion' rebus: ciṅka-c-cuvaṇam 'superior gold'; Eight legs, i.e. doubling of four legs of an animal: dula 'doubling' rebus: dul 'metal casting'. Thus शरभः śarabhaḥ is a hypertext which signifies metal workers and metal casters working with iron and gold.
Thus, the contestants shown on the wall of Chennakeshava Temple which show a series of animals:
Gaṇḍa-Bheruṇḍa शरभः śarabhaḥ simha 'lion' ibha 'elephant' मूषः mūṣaḥ A rat, mouse
These animals are hieroglyphs of Indus script which arec explained as Meluhha Indus Script rebus readings of wealth resources and veneration of metalworkers:
भारुण्ड ाम 'veneration of metal workers'
शबरः śabaraḥ, शवरः śavaraḥ 'mountaineers, metalworkers' karabha 'camel' rebus; karba 'iron' PLUS ibha 'elephant' rebus: ib 'iron' PLUS doubled four or eight legs: dul 'doubled' rebus: 'metal casting' iṅka-c-cuvaṇam 'superior gold' ib 'iron' मूषः mūṣaḥ A crucible.
"On the north-east wall, a story of a chain of destruction is beautifully carved out. A double-headed eagle attacks a Sarabha (mythical animal) which attacks a lion that in turns attacks an elephant who is about to destroy a snake that is trying to swallow up a rat before the ponderous gaze of a
mendicant." https://artoflegendindia.blogspot.com/2012/12/hoysala-temples-belur-halebidand.html Narasimhacharya, Ramanujapuram (1987). The Kesava Temple at Belur. Asiatic Society.
