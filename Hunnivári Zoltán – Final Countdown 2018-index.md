PREFACE TO THE SECOND
(ENLARGED) EDITION
In the first edition (2016) I have surveyed the historical solar and lunar eclipses from „the date of the Creation of the World up to the western campaign of Attila the Hun (CE 644/AD 453) adding to those eclipses a few of their chronological starting or corner points. In my recent study I reached the year of CE 1000. The attentive Reader could already discover also in my previous study that the number of those eclipses which were titled by the academical science as „magic, ghost, false date, usual (false) date, misdated, fictitious, no clear record, predicted, uncertain, possible, invisible, ambiguous, doubtful, alleged, unidentifiable, unlikely recorded” eclipses or „confused predictions” only, was drastically decreased by me. In the first edition of my recent study using the Hungarian Calendar (the time-slip hypothesis of 190/192/194/196/198 years) I have already identified 80 historical solar and lunar eclipses. In my opinion the identification of those eclipses is 100 % sure. In the beginning period of my researches when I unreservedly believed in the correctness of the retro calculations related to the past 2800 years I was somehow limited in my field of research, although from the start I was a bit disturbed by the uncertainties of the delta-T. From the Canon of Theodor Oppolzer I have selected the pictures of the solar eclipses from the „era preceding the involvement of the delta-T” and I considered the explanations of Ginzel. In order to exclude successfully the uncertainties, in more details I have studied only the solar eclipses of west-east direction. Luckily for me the solar eclipse which took place at the location of Nola around the time of the death of Augustus Caesar (Aug 19 AD 14) was enough to prove the righteousness of the Hungarian Calendar (Aug 14 CE 212) in the chronological dispute with the traditional chronology which was determining its date mistakenly and is using its mistaken date up to now. Originally the Hungarian Calendar hypothesis was born in order to eliminate the existing anomaly of the vernal equinoxes (MEQ). When it become evident that 19 lunar eclipses of Ptolemy were placed on the timeaxis mistakenly, and were misplaced by 196 years, I was freed from the necessity to consider the illustrations and the data of the retrocalculated solar and lunar eclipses as completely accurate.

It is well known that the year of the birth of Jesus Christ is the basis for our recent timecounting. However the year of our Lord”, or in Latin „Anno Domini”, is a bit problematic, since we do not know when was it, how many years ago counted back from our recent days! Some people (the humanists) found out that it was 2018 years ago, that is in the 0 year astronomically. They also decided that CE (Common Era) is not else than AD (Anno Domini), consequently AD 1=CE 1! At the same time regarding to the birth of Jesus can be proved an at least 5-9 yearly of date difference in the field of academicals research. As at now in academicals circles they try to ply down the importance of BC and AD terms, saying that these are out of real use today. But it is simply not true, CE 1=AD 1 and BCE=BC are in common use further on. However it was scientifically explained that BC 1 is not else than the „0” year. Thus it does not matter that Jesus was born in BC 5/BC 3/BC 1 /AD 1/AD 3, etc. The Hungarian Calendar, with certain preconditions, puts the birth of Jesus in the year CE 194, but relaxing these preconditions locates the year anywhere between CE 191-194. Having such a big difference in years, the historical Christian chronology cannot be maintained any more. Perhaps it is needless to say that when we search on the basis of the Hungarian Calendar for astronomical events, which happened in times closer to us by 200 years, and when we identify them properly, we at the same time invalidate all the earlier identified astronomical events up to a certain point. Moreover, it is not obligatory to search constantly for an event at an exact 200 year distance, since it is only a freak of fortune that the real event and the mistakenly identified one are separated from each other by exactly such a time-distance. But why should my reader believe more in me than in scientific research of a 400year period of time? My heaviest arguments, of course, will be those astronomical events, which resisted all of science’s efforts to be identified during the past 400 years. They tried the identification but with no success at all. As we mentioned earlier the academicals science titled them as „magic, ghost, misdated, uncertain, fictitious, doubtful, alleged, etc.” eclipses. On the other hand, on the basis of the Hungarian Calendar the events happen to be there, at which place they must be situated according to the orthodox science as well. Showing a couple of such decisive events on behalf of the Hungarian Calendar settles the case. There is no more need to continue the comparison of the earlier (by 200 years) mistaken event with the real one, and does not make sense to muse on which is the better of the two! It is more so in a case when we have a literary reference with day accuracy, since such a reference can be only a product of later retro calculation. Surely nobody could hear in the first century about an erroneous idea (of starting year identification) created by Dionysius Exiguus of the 6th century...
Starting from the middle of the 15th century the interest of the scientists to find out more about our past was quickly growing and they also realized that an astronomical knowledge is also vital for that reason. Our foregoing’s were recording the events very diligently leaving for the posterity a lot of astronomical data recorded in a greatly varied chronological systems (Seleucid era, Arsacid era, Egyptian Calendar, Old Roman Calendar, Byzantine era, Old type Christian chronology, era Safar/Spanish era, etc.)

In 1538 J.J. Scaliger presented also the basic astronomical time-axis of our history selecting the starting point as the date of January 1st of the year -4712th, 12.00 hours. This is the so called Julian Day=0, or most commonly the beginning of the Creation of the World. „Julian Day (JD) is the continuous count of days since the beginnings of the Julian Period used primarily by astronomers. The Julian Day Number (JDN) is the integer assigned to a whole solar day in the Julian day count starting from noon Greenwich Mean Time, with Julian day number 0 assigned to the day starting at noon on January 1, 4713 BC. The Julian day number is based on the Julian Period proposed by Joseph Scaliger in 1583 at the time of the Gregorian calendar reform.” Following this calendar reform our honest scientists according to their best knowledge started to copy, convert and also „correct” those dates of the earlier chronicles which were not seemed properly placed on the time-axis. The historians even today do the same in order to save their readers from continuous calculations. The conversion, or retro calculation inevitably can be the source of mistakes, and in cases when we do not have the source from which they got and converted the date, we have not any chance to question their data which is given by day exactness. It was the situation up to now. In the 19th century the great scientists who worked on the sources were already less meticulous having their feeling self-confidence, self-importance and arrogance they filtered out a lot of „mistakes” from the sources and removed those old data forever. The most famous scientists themselves became basic sources (Mommsen, Ranke, Duby, Homan, Kristo, etc.) Further on the self-importance feeling and the arrogance is ever growing, not only the historians but the astronomer-historians too are taking similar trend. In order to produce the solar and lunar eclipses’ maps of their like they are ready to modify the equations of the moon, using a mysterious Delta-T, they try to prove their correctness. Today the situation is worse than in the time of Galilei. It is true that auto-da-fe is not yet introduced, but there is the conspiracy of silence, the complete censorship in the field of scientific literature. It is impossible to publish in a scientific journal since a timeslip hypothesis of 200 years is considered as nonsense, consequently it is unscientific. Visiting „the scientific forums and blogs” you can find not a better situation. The comments are screened and moderated; the moderator can rightfully exclude and shut out completely from the forum. Very scientifically they can qualify the different opinion as a category of topic’s disturbance. Never mind that we live in the era of internet, the universities and research institutes are protecting their employees and „good name” from uninvited letters (qualifying them as spams), so there is no space for electronical publication of any new approach (hypothesis) and to discuss it widely with the public. During the past 15 years the only refreshing and nice exception was the Trinity College Dublin where the Trinity Centre for Medieval and Renaissance Studies gave me an opportunity on February 24th in 2016, and I could present briefly my hypothesis. The only remaining field for me is the category of alternatives, where again the agents of the academical science are lecturing us, destroying the topic, and at the end, when they lack of any argument, they switch over to the mental state and the medication problem s of the opponent, or they mention the conspiracy theory which can already involve legal consequences...

At the present time we are in this sad situation. Dear English speaking Readers who is interested in my study never mind the above said. I wish you good reading and looking for your kind attention which can help you to understand my presented theory, or might generate your wish to read more about the same subject from my previous books.

PREFACE
Here in my recent study I present in brief all my astronomical results of all my previous books. In addition I also present the determination of the dates for several ancient astronomical events. I had hoped for a while that someone else, with more extensive training in astronomy, would step forward to complete the task. Since nobody accepted this challenge, you must rest contented with my unprofessional studies. However, I hope you will find this content rewarding! Naturally, there will be those who find my work less than rewarding! I gratefully acknowledge my debt to major scientists of the past, particularly T. von Oppolzer, F.K. Ginzel, and Robert R. Newton, whose works gave me a professional orientation, and opportunity to educate myself in astronomy, and good guidance regarding solar and lunar eclipses. It is a pity they have passed from us before the creation of the Hungarian Calendar. The eclipse maps, figures, tables, and predictions appear here by courtesy of Fred Espenak, of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. I wish all my readers a good read. Please take my analysis as food for thought and hazard a guess for the future consequences.

INTRODUCTION
The aim of this study is to provide astronomical support for the Hungarian calendar hypothesis, through a critical analysis of solar and lunar eclipses which occurred during the 2000-year period following the introduction of the Nabonassar era, and which are recorded in literary works. I am well aware that not everyone is familiar with the Hungarian calendar hypothesis, so I shall repeat it here briefly. The Hungarian Calendar hypothesis maintains that Julius Caesar introduced the Julian calendar in the year of CE 152 which is the result of astronomical backward counting from the present and means a period of time elapsed 1866 years ago. The officially accepted and universally propagated date for the introduction of the Julian calendar is the year of BC 45 which differs by 196 years from the proposed date, CE 152, of the Hungarian Calendar.
The Hungarian Calendar has determined the date of CE 152 as the starting date of the Julian calendar by astronomical backward counting of the time related to the vernal equinoxes (spring points). The “New chronology” was then verified and confirmed by the critical analysis of historical solar eclipses. The conclusion of the Hungarian Calendar is that the dates of the vernal equinox (spring point) took place on March 21 of the Julian calendar (CE 152) and on the “Augustan correction” (about CE 190). The Hungarian Calendar provides the answers for why Pop Gregory corrected (very rightfully by the way) the calendar by only 10 days in 1582. In addition, the Hungarian Calendar hypothesis maintains (on the basis of the same backward counting of the time) that Jesus Christ was born about CE 195 assuming that Jesus died when He was 33 years old.

CHRONOLOGY AS SCIENCE
Civilized nations have developed time-measurement and time reckoning into a science. This science is the chronology or science of eras and today both have become very independent and an important auxiliary science of historical science. Almost everywhere and at all times, time-measurement and time-counting have been related to the motion and alteration of celestial bodies. In our Julian/Gregorian calendar, for example, we need only the concepts of the day and the year. A method of time-measurement which is based on the exact calculation of motion from celestial bodies is the subject of mathematical chronology. Historical chronology gives us a picture showing the time-measuring and time-counting methods of different peoples in different eras. The components of our recent time-reckoning come partly from the peoples of the ancient times and the results of amendments made in the Middle Ages. As I have alredy mentioned in my Book – “Hungarian Calendar” (2004), uninitiated readers are generally convinced that chronology (time reckoning) is completely self-evident (being extremely simple), and there is no reason to doubt the accuracy of its presently accepted database. I would like to mention that chronology started to become a science during the 17th18th centuries when different European countries began to provide big source-edition serial publishing. In the 19th century, chronology became the most important auxiliary science of historical science and eventually became an accepted independent science. The scientific chronology corresponding to our modern understanding was introduced by the great French humanist J.J. SCALIGER (1540-1609) and his opponent, the Jesuit monk D. PETAVIUS (1583-1652). Since the publication of the fundamental works of SCALIGER and PETAVIUS, “scientific chronology” has continued to develop. Scientific chronology emerged in the 19th century, while relying on every aspect of the prescientific Christian time reckonings of medieval Europe (starting from the Creation of the World) which in many of their elements differed from each other. The highly complicated synchronization between the different calendar systems was done in a period of time which was lacking any scientific basis, and resulted with only minor corrections. Thus from the point of view of chronology we have an absolutely unfailing system of measuring time (called chronology) since 1582 only, i.e. since the introduction of the Gregorian calendar, more precisely since the 4th/15th of October, 1582.

ASTRONOMY IN THE SERVICE OF
HISTORICAL SCIENCE
It is a well known fact that the records of numerous astronomical observations reached to us in different chronicles and in old accounts of travels, and for ages there were more or less successful efforts to identify those astronomical observations. It is widely accepted by historians that history is usually written after an event and typically by the victors. Consequently, in every case, the veracity of each record must be examined very carefully. We are equally aware that the dates of the historical chronology are verified by the historical solar and lunar eclipses and our recent academic science relies heavily on those dates without any hesitation. Archaeo-astronomy is an interesting branch of science since it connects astronomy, en exact natural science, with historical science, which is an extremely subjective one. What principally connects them is time. Both parties must learn something additional, the astronomer by getting some historical knowledge, and the historians, for their part, by gaining some experience in recognizing astronomical phenomena. Nobody can question the “historical” events which took place on 11th of August 1999 when, above Eurasia, a total solar eclipse was observed. But how far can we travel into the past and still have the same sense of security. Academic science is very optimistic in this regard since we explained to schools that we can journey safely back as far as the beginning of the first millennium BC. However, studying astronomical phenomena (mainly meaning solar and lunar eclipses) we can go back to the past and can examine about 2800 years. Our chronology is determined by absolutely safe corner-points such as the beginning, 45 BC; the death of Caesar on the ides of March in 44 BC; and during the AD period the “engraved in stone” date of the death of Augustus Caesar (at Nola near Naples), which was determined as 19th of August AD 14! To prove the genuineness of the Roman chronology we have good support from the solar and lunar eclipses recorded in historical sources. The academic science praises and prefers this method willingly although the scientists are getting more uncertain about the process of application when they analyze the results of this method. One hundred years ago F.K. Ginzel performed a monumental task (Spezielle Kanon der Sonnen- und Mondfinsternisse von 900 vor Chr. bis 600 nach Chr.) of identifying 60 solar and lunar eclipses up until the fall of the Western Roman Empire. As we approached 1970, the number (60) of identified eclipses became considerably reduced when Robert R. Newton, the professor of John Hopkins University, stated that four-fifths of the ancient “observations” were incorrect or unreliable. The latest research gives us another result which is more distressing than the version of Robert R. Newton. F. Richard Stephenson’s book, “Historical Eclipses and Earth’s Rotation” indicates only two European solar eclipses, for the first 300 years of the Julian calendar, are questionable.
10



Unfortunately the Chinese solar eclipses, which are presented by Stephenson to verify our Roman Catholic chronology, does not amount to much because there was not any contemporary synchronization between the Roman Caesars and Chinese Emperors. The Chinese chronology was established by Jesuits sent to China by the Roman popes after the year of 1582 and those Jesuits used the method of retro-counting of the time. According to the Hungarian Calendar nothing is wrong with the veracity of the ancient solar eclipses. In fact, we start to find and locate those eclipses at their exact position we realize this is an area which is closer to us in time by 200 years! In my book, “The final countdown – Chronology of eclipses from Julius Caesar to Diocletian (2005/2007)” – I have completed extensive research and put the eclipses at their correct places on the time axis. As a result, according to the traditional chronology Augustus Caesar died at Nola near Naples in AD 14 on 19th of August which also equals the year of CE 212 according to the Hungarian Calendar. We know this to be true because presently, the vernal equinox occurred on March 21 at 2 o’clock at dawn while the autumnal equinox ocurred on Sept. 23 at around 12 o’clock. Literary sources mention that a solar eclipse took place at the location of Nola a little earlier than the death of Augustus Caesar. 58 years after the introduction of the Julian calendar and on Aug. 14 in CE 212, a date that is earlier by five days than the death of Augustus, various astronomical programs indicate that a solar eclipse took place. This solar eclipse has a good companion, a lunar eclipse, which is connected to the first year of the reign of Tiberius and mentioned in connection with the revolt of the Pannonien legions. The date of the lunar eclipse is Jan. 24 in CE 213. Looking back to the traditional year of CE 14 my Readers can already guess, without any hinting from me, that the academic science cannot show to us any solar eclipse connected to CE 14. After 400 years of intensive research the experts have agreed with the following opinion of D. Justin Schove:
“In ancient times the Sun was often credited with an eclipse around the time of the death of a famous person. Such a statement usually amounts to no more than a stock literary compliment. Augustus seems to be no exception.” (Schove, p. 5)
In general it might be the case, but in our case this “crediting with an eclipse” was not necessary! This single solar eclipse (CE 212) is enough to prove the righteousness of the Hungarian Calendar in the chronological dispute with the traditional chronology which was mistakenly established and used today. An event recorded in writing can bear any historical character when we safely say the exact time and the location of that event. When we cannot determine these exact dates we are lead into the world of legends and myths. Without mathematics and astronomy our entire history would be a mess and the geese of the Capitolium would be placed easily next to be the capitulation at Sedan.

THE SELEUCID CODE
The most ancient cradles of human civilization exist within the rivers of China’s Yangtse and Huangho, India’s Indus and Ganges, Egypt’s Nile, and Mesopotamia’s Tigris and Euphrates. Approximately 5000 years ago the first formations of humanity were established there. In the 19th century excavations performed at the Mesopotamian locations produced very rich findings. Archeologist found tens of thousands of small plates fully carved with the symbols of an ancient writing, and these are the plates that today are referred to as clay tablets.
Luckily for us we can safely state that any forgery of those tablets can be completely excluded from consideration. When those tablets reached the various museums, nobody could read them, or more precisely, nobody could interpret their meaning.
Towards the end of the 19th century, the cuneiform writing of the tablets came to be deciphered and their contents understood. For the purpose of my study, the clay tablets with astronomical content are the important ones, especially the records made by the Babylonian astronomers during the eras of the Seleucids and the Parthian Arsacides. Those records were elaborated by J. Epping and J. N. Strassmaier, both of whom determined correctly the names of the planets, the signs of the zodiac, thus opening the way to decode the astronomical texts. Unfortunately the clay tablets are in bad shape. The necessary means have not yet been found to make a perfect interpretation of their records. Furthermore, in spite of the optimistic mood of mainstream scientists, an understanding of the ancient professional terminology is also far from perfection. Thanks must go to the Austrian Academy of Science and Mr. Hermann Hunger for translating the astronomical texts of the tablets into English and making them available for everyone to study. At the start of the 20th century the Babylonian chronology was accepted by general agreement. Therefore, year 311/312 of the Seleucid era is equivalent to year CE 1 of our common era.
The key to the date recalculation is
the following relationship: CE 1 = SE 311/312
Perhaps that is enough to say about the clay tablets, at the outset, reflecting on the fact the “wonder weapon” nature of the content applies not just to adherents of traditional chronology but to my Hungarian Calendar as well. I would not like to bore you with the particulars of my examinations. It is the final result which is important. After having evaluated and carefully examined the 40 dated tablets I am afraid I will have to cause distress to the representatives of the academic sciences and their faithful followers. Mainstream scientists made a mistake amounting to 196 years when they synchronized the era of the Seleucids. This 196 year slip, which is nothing other than a 2424 synodic moon-month cycle, was given the name “Seleucid code” by me. Its precise length is 71582.145 days, or in other terms 195.98545 tropical years.
12



The correct (right) key for the recalculation of the
dates is
CE 1 = SE 115/116
or
SE 311/312 = CE 197
Everyone can continue to examine the dated clay tablets using my “Seleucid code” and the result will always be analogical. The academic standpoint is very clear in connection with the tablets. If the lunar eclipse is definitely mentioned on the tablet, but the retro-calculation cannot show one in the traditional chronology, then they determine the case as “prediction”. In about 50 per cent of the examined cases they will, of course, find lunar eclipses retro-calculated in the traditional chronology and generously accept those as “observations” yet suffer greatly from the inaccurate measurements committed by the Babylonian astronomers. Dear Reader, please understand the essence of what I say. Every recorded event was misplaced in time by 196 years. None of the identified solar or lunar eclipses are correct. They were forcibly adjusted to fulfill their purpose, into a kind of scientific strait-jacket. Today, this is known as modern science called Assyriology and astronomical chronology which essentially proves Assyriology using retro-calculation! From this mistaken basic data, the physicists happily calculate the value of delta-T.
The use of “The Seleucid code” reveals the fact that for the past 2600 years the value of delta-T with great certainty will converge to zero...

HUNGARIAN CALENDAR =
ASTRONOMICAL DATING
BCE does not correspond to BC and AD does not correspond to CE!
BRIEFLY TO SAY IN OTHER WORDS THE HUNGARIAN CALENDAR IS NOTHING ELSE THAN AN ASTRONOMICAL DATING OF THIS PART OF THE JULIAN CALENDAR WHICH COVERS THE TIME PERIOD THE DATA OF 4th OCTOBER, 1582.
SOLAR ECLIPSES OF HISTORICAL INTEREST
“Both the popular and technical literature contains many references to solar eclipses of the past. Some of these references are from ancient texts. In other cases, they are attempts to tie an eclipse with a historical event. [...] Some events may be either apocryphal or fictional, or an eclipse may be incorrectly associated with a particular event. The eclipse maps and calculations are simply presented so that they may be compared with references in the literature. It is left to the reader to evaluate whether the eclipse association is valid or not.” (Fred Espenak) http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEhistory/SEhistory.html After this brief introduction I am going to examine few historical eclipses using my Seleucid code and the Hungarian calendar hypothesis.
The year of BCE 560 (Traditional BC 763)
ASSYRIAN ECLIPSE “The Assyrian eclipse is also know as the Bur-Sagale (BurSagille,Pur-Sagale or Par-Sagale) eclipse. It was recorded in Assyrian eponym lists, most likely in the 9th year of king Ashur-dan III. The actual short entry reads as follows:
Bur-Sagale of Guzana, revolt in the city of Assur. In the month Simanu an eclipse of the sun took place.” http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse_of_Bur_Sagale According to Fred Espenak the event had a considerable value of delta-T (recently maintained as 21220.6 sec, in 1997 believed to be 19840.3 sec, while in 2007 it was determined as 22343sec...) and the shadow of the Moon was casted on our globe as it follows. http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEhistory/SEplot/SE0762Jun15T.gif
16



The date June 15, 763 BC is inconsistent with the Babylon calendar. Accepting June 15, 763 BC as the date of the eclipse means that the same year Nisan 1 must have begun on March 20, that is 8 or 9 days before the spring equinox falling that year on March 28/29. The Seleucid code helps us to find easily the date of the genuine solar eclipse. BCE 560 Jul 20 (JD ~1517083.45)
http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/5MCSEmap/-0599—0500/-559-07-20.gif
Of course the value of delta-T is zero instead of the proposed 16500 sec!
The year of BCE 551 (Traditional BC 747)
In a Hungarian calendar, the first day of the Nabonassar era – Toth 1 Nabonassar corresponds to February 20, 551 BCE. (JD ~1520221) According of the Seleucid code the first Month begins February 14, 551 BCE. (JD ~ 1520215.5)

WAS IT THE CRIME OF CLAUDIUS PTOLEMY?
“This is the story of a scientific crime. By this, I do not mean a crime planned with the care and thoroughness that scientists like to think of as a characteristic of their profession, nor do I mean a crime carried out with the aid of technological gadgetry like hidden microphones and coded messages on microdots. I mean a crime committed by a scientist against his fellow scientists and scholars, a betrayal of the ethics and integrity of his profession that has forever deprived

The mathematician Claudius Ptolemy 'the Alexandrian' as imagined by a 16th-century artist



mankind of fundamental information about an important area of astronomy and history.”
[Robert R. Newton; THE CRIME OF CLAUDIUS PTOLEMY, Preface]
The above devastating criticism from Robert R. Newton’s Preface is directed to Ptolemy’s main astronomical work which is usually called the Syntaxis. In chapter XIII of his book R. Newton expresses his firm opinion in connection with the entire Syntaxis that all the “observations” of Ptolemy in relation with the Sun and the Moon are fabricated, they are the results of retro-calculations (thus we have a case of forgery). R. Newton also accuses the astronomer Ptolemy that his data, taken by him from earlier authors, was also partly forged. The academic science did not pay too much attention to Newton’s critical remarks since our scientists are very sure that the inaccuracy of Ptolemy’s data is purely the result of measuring errors which show the limited measuring possibilities of Ptolemy’s own life-time. Recently when we have at hand my Hungarian calendar and Seleucid code there is a completely new perspective to investigate and explain the “inaccurate character” of data recorded in the Syntaxis. In the earlier chapters of my book the Reader was informed about an astonishing fact that as a result of erroneous synchronization there was done a fatal mistake when the Seleucid dates were wrongly placed on the astronomical time axis, that is the mentioned dates were misplaced by 2424 synodical months (let me call this time length as Hunnivari’s cycle). Accepting this revealed misplacement we have also a possibility to check the data of Syntaxis. For me it is not so difficult to perform the checking since we generally have the dates with day exactness. But before we are going to deal with the dates of data in Syntaxis we must answer one basic question, “For Ptolemy who lived in emperor Hadrian’s times, was there a real possibility to retro-calculate with day and hour exactness the occurrence of a lunar eclipse which had happened 850 years earlier than his own life-time and was he capable, at the same time, to properly calculate the duration of the same lunar eclipse?” Without data of observations how could Ptolemy built up his monumental system which covers the time-interval from Nabonassar to the reign of king Antonius, the Roman emperor? It is complete nonsense! It cannot be said in good faith and it is absurd to claim. By the way, is it a reality today for a physicist-astronomer who has the latest model of computers to retro-calculate properly and to determine correctly the data of a lunar eclipse which occurred 2800 years ago? No, he cannot do that at all as it will be convincingly proved in the later parts of this book! At this point we can consider another aspect and we can ask a disturbing question, “What would be the standpoint of the modern physics and astronomy in case the works of Ptolemy, the Almagest or the Syntaxis (which are in publications since 1515) would have been lost forever, or if fatal mistakes would be done by the numerous transcribers (during the passed time of 1300 years)? Would the scientists of NASA estimate, with such self-assurance, the phases of the Moon which are at a distance of 2000 years from us in the past? When we know very well that the synodic month is a measuring unit of very uncertain length?”
20



„For the year 2000, the length of the mean synodic month (New Moon to New Moon) is 29.530588 days (=29d12h44m03s). However, the length of any one synodic month can vary from 29.26 to 29.80 days due to perturbing effects of the Sun on the Moon’s eccentric orbit.” http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/phase/phase2001gmt.html
Nevertheless, our scientists mislead the general public maintaining that they can retrocalculate with the exactness of a second and they can determine the sky positions as far deep in the past as 2800 years. I think it is just enough to remind my Readers about the uncertainty around the deltaT. As far back as 2800 years this uncertainty can cause a mistake of several hours when we try to guess the occurrence of a solar eclipse, especially when we try to determine its location. The main factor which causes the impossibility of the exact retro-calculation is the irregular movement of the Moon. The phases of the Moon cannot be retro-calculated exactly, we can only guess them!
“The fact that the angular velocity of the moon goes through an oscillation, having a place where it is a minimum (apogee) and another where it is a maximum (perigee), has been known for a long time. The Babylonians knew of this oscillation in velocity and had well-developed methods of including it when they calculated ephemerides of the Moon. By following perigee and apogee over long periods of time, they also knew that the positions of the lunar perigee and apogee moved steadily through the heavens, and this knowledge passed to the Greek astronomers.” (Newton, p. 110)
However, at NASA, they pretend as if everything is in complete order. Dating back 4000 years (2000 BCE), they give us the values of the Moon’s phases with a minute exactness and those Moon phases determine the time and place of the historical lunar and solar eclipses. On page 191 of Ptolemy’s modern English edition the anomaly of Moon is demonstrated by the means of three Babylonian eclipses. The main question for my investigation is, “Are we dealing with retro-calculated, that is with forged data, or do we have records of genuine contemporary observations?”
The first lunar eclipse of Ptolemy;
“First, the three ancient eclipses which are selected from those observed in Babylon. The first is recorded as occurring in the first year of Mardokempad, Thot [I] 29/30 in the Egyptian calendar [-720 Mar. 19/20]. The eclipse began, it says well over an hour after moonrise, and was total. Now since the sun was near the end of Pisces and [therefore] the night was about 12 equinoctial hours long, the beginning of the eclipse occurred, clearly 4 1⁄2 equinoctial hours before midnight.” [Almagest, IV, 6; trans. Toomer (1998, p.191).] This lunar eclipse really happened on Martius 12 in BCE 525, not in BCE 721 Martius 19/20. The result of my empirical calculations: In Babylon -524 Martius 12 /Partial lunar eclipse begins at 19:05 Local Time (LT)/ Total lunar eclipse begins at 20:42 LT /Mid. of the eclipse 21:30 LT /Total eclipse ends at 22:18 LT/ Partial eclipse ends at 23:15 LC/ Delta T = zero sec! (JD ~ 1529738.27)

Summarizing the information above concerning the first examined lunar eclipse recorded by Ptolemy, we can firmly state that it was placed erroneously by official science on the astronomical time axis 196 years further into the past (-720 Mar. 20) while the correct date was definitely -524 Martius 12! Because of these facts, NASA illustrates the -524 Mar. 12 lunar eclipse incorrectly; //eclipse.gsfc .../LE-524-03-12P.gif (Z.H.; La nueva cronologia, p. 32-34)

“The second eclipse is recorded as occurring in the second year of the same Mardokempad, Toth [I] 18/19 in the Egyptian calendar [-719 Mar. 18/19]. The [maximum] obscuration, it says was 3 digits from the south exactly at midnight. So, since mid-eclipse was exactly at midnight at Babylon, it must have been 5/6 h before midnight at Alexandria...”
[Almagest, IV, 6; trans. Toomer (1998, p.191-2).] This lunar eclipse really happened on Martius 1/2 in BCE 524 not in BCE 720 Martius 8/9. The result of my empirical calculations: In Babylon -523 Martius 1 /2 /Partial lunar eclipse begins at 23:10 LT /Mid. of the eclipse 24:00 LT/ Partial eclipse end at 0:50 LT (Martius 2) /Delta T = zero sec! (JD ~ 1530092.37) Summarizing the information above concerning the second examined lunar eclipse recorded by Ptolemy, we can firmly state that it was placed erroneously by official science on the astronomical time axis 196 years further into the past (-719 Mar 09) while the correct date was definitely – 523 Mar 01! Because of these facts, NASA illustrates the 523 Mar 01 lunar eclipse incorrectly. //eclipse /LE-523-03-01N.gif (Z.H.; La nueva cronologia, p. 34)

“The third eclipse is recorded as occurring in the (same) second year of Mardokempad, Phamenoth [Month VII] 15/16 in the Egyptian calendar [-719 Sept 1 /2]. The eclipse began, it says, after moonrise, and the [maximum] obscuration was more than half [the disc] from the north. So, since the sun was near the beginning of Virgo, the length of night at Babylon was about 11 equinoctial hours, and half the night was 51/2 [equinoctial] hours. Therefore the beginning of the eclipse was about 5 equinoctial hours before midnight (since it began after moonrise)...” [Almagest, IV, 6; trans. Toomer (1998, p. 192).] This lunar eclipse really happened on Augustus 26 in BCE 524, not in BCE 720 September 1.

At the moment of departure, the sun suddenly quitted his seat in the heavens, and disappeared, though there were no clouds in sight, but the sky was clear and serene. Day was thus turned into night; whereupon Xerxes, who saw and remarked the prodigy, was seized with alarm, and sending at for the Magians, inquired of them the meaning of the portent.

“He says that the next eclipse occurred in the archonship of Phanostratos at Athens, in the month Skirophorion, Phamenot 24/25 in the Egyptian calendar, and that the Moon was eclipsed from the summer rising-point [i.e. the north-east] when the first hour [of night] was well advanced. This moment is in the 366th year from Nabonassar, Phamenoth [VII] 24/25 [-381 June 18/19], about 5 1⁄2 seasonal hours before midnight.” [Almagest, IV, 11; trans.

“He says that the third eclipse occurred in the archonship of Euandros at Athens, in the month Poseidon I, Thoth 16/17 in the Egyptian calendar and that (the moon) was totally eclipsed, beginning from the summer rising-point [i.e. the north-east], after four hours [of night] had passed. This moment is in the 367th year from Nabonassar, Thoth [I] 16/17 [-381 Dec 12/13], about 2 1⁄2 hours before midnight. Now when the Sun is about two-thirds through Sagittarius, one hour of night at Babylon is about 18 timedegrees. So 2 1⁄2 seasonal hours produce 3 equinoctial hours. Therefore the beginning of the eclipse was 9 equinoctial hours after moon on the 16t”. And since the eclipse was total, its duration was about 4 equinoctial hours.” [Almagest, IV, 11; trans. Toomer (1998. p. 213).] This lunar eclipse really happened on December 6 in 186, not in BCE 382 December 13. Delta T = zero sec! (JD ~ 1653825.328) (Z.H.; La nueva cronologia, p. 40-41)

The year of BCE 166 (Traditional BC 364 and BC 361)
“When the common council of the Boeotians convened and the envoys had explained the matters on which they had been instructed, the Boeotians concurred with the Thessalians in every matter, gave Pelopidas seven thousand men and ordered him speedily assist as requested; but as Pelopidas was hastening to leave with his army, the sun, as it happened, was eclipsed.” (Diodorus, Library of History XV 80)
“At this time, Alexander the Pherarean falling back to his old nature, and having seized many of the Thessalian cities, and put garrisons upon the Achaeans of Phthiotis, and the Magnesians, the cities, hearing that Pelopidas was returned, sent an embassy to Thebes requesting succours, and him for their leader. The Thebans willingly granted their desire; and now when all things were prepared, and the general beginning to march, the sun was eclipsed, and darkness spread over the city at noonday.” (Plutarch, Pelopidas, 31) This solar eclipse really happened on May 17 in BCE 166, not in BCE 364 July 13.

“It was now the middle of summer, and the Etesian winds blowing steadily on the seas the moon was at the full... Just after the libations were made, and the accompanying prayers offered, the moon was eclipsed; which was no wonder to Dion, who understood the revolutions of eclipses, and the way in which the moon is overshadowed and the earth interposed between her and the sun.” (Plutarch, Dion, 23; 24)
“So his friend Dion, when the moon, at the time he was to embark from Zacynthus to go against Dionysius, was eclipsed, was not in the least disturbed, but went on, and arriving at Syracuse, expelled the tyrant.” (Plutarch, Nicias, 23) This lunar eclipse really happened on Augustus 3 in BCE 161, not in BCE 357 Augustus 9.

Several Greek and Roman writers record that an eclipse of the Moon happened about the time of a battle between the army of Alexander the Great and the Persian forces at Arbela.
“It came to pass that in the month Boedromion, about the beginning of feast of Mysteries at Athens, there was an eclipse of the moon, the eleventh night after which, the two armies being now in view of another, Darius kept his men in arms, and by torchlight took a general review of them.” (Plutarch, Alexander, 19)
“There he gave his army a rest. There was an almost total eclipse of the moon, and Alexander sacrificed to the Moon, Sun an Earth, who are all said to cause an eclipse. Aristander thought that the eclipse was favorable to the Macedonians and Alexander... ...So ended this battle in the month Pyanepsion of the archonship at Athens of Aristophanes.”

“Continuing our search for dated tablets, on the page 142 (SH III) we can find one with double dating (BM 34050) which is in relatively good condition and is extremely valuable for us. The double dating means that we have an exact date on it not only of the Seleucid era but also of the Arsacid era which differs from the Seleucid era by 64 years. The diary relates to the 107th year of the Arsacid era which is stated to be analogical to the 171st year of the Seleucid era, The months are also recorded as 9 and 10.

The inflated English translation (or rather distortion!) of the tablet’s content leaves no doubt at the all about the sources used, which definitely were the retro-calculated astronomical celestial situations of BC 141 and BC 140. Based on these data the rendering to the calendar was performed. I am sorry to disappoint the authors, but in my opinion the Babylonian astronomer was watching the sky in December of CE 56 and in January of CE 57, and he wrote what he saw with his “reed pen” on the mild clay for the information of future generations. Because of this fact, three very important sections of the tablet produce contradictions for the believers of the BC 141/BC 140 version of events. On the obverse side of the tablet, in line 12, a lunar eclipse is mentioned, which at that time was not visible, and in addition the tablet mentions that were was a lunar eclipse 5 month earlier. This earlier eclipse was visible in the evening of July 15th in CE 56 of the Julian calendar. For the lunar eclipse which was not visible in Babylon the correct date is December 11th, in CE 56. In line 23 of the tablet there is a note about the beginning of the winter solstice, which occurred on the 25th day of the 9th month. Recalculating this date we get December 21st, CE 56. Furthermore, it is unbelievably good luck for us that on the tablet we also have an intact piece telling us about a solar eclipse occurring 4 days later, although they could not see it. Retro-calculation helps us to see that the Sun was rising at the time of its eclipse, and the eclipse ended within not more than thirty minutes. The date of the eclipse after recalculation is December 25th, CE 56. These four dates following each other in such a sequence cannot be reproduced within a time period of 1000 astronomical years, including of course the turn of BC 141/BC 140. I can fully understand the non-committal attitude of the author of the analyzed book when he does not specify the calendar positions of these three very important events in the time-interval which was determined by him. His mistakenly identified solar eclipse was perfectly visible in the area of the Pacific Ocean.” (H.Z.; The Seleucid Code, p. 28-31) Clay tablet BM 34050, Listed as LBAT 420 /SH III p. 142-153 23’ ...The 24th, solstice; This was the winter solstice of CE 56 December 21. 29’ [solar eclipse] which was omitted; This solar eclipse really happened on December 25 in CE 56, not in BCE 140 January 1.

“Now at the very moment of coming to land at Dyrrachium he learned that he should not obtain a prosperous outcome...Hence many wolves and owls were seen in the city itself and continual earthquakes with bellowing’s took place, fire darted across from the west to the east, and another fire consumed the temple of Quirinnus as well of the buildings. The sun, too, suffered a total eclipse, and thunderbolts damaged a scepter of Jupiter and a shield and a helmet of Mars that were votive offerings on the Capitol, and likewise the tables which contained the laws.” (Cassius Dio, Roman History, XLI, 14, Ginzel 31/1)
“ -50 Mar 7 E (Caesar). Reference: Dio Cassius. There are both modern and ancient mysteries connected with this eclipse. Book xli, Chapter 14 of Dio does mention an eclipse of the sun. It mentions it in connection with the flight of Pompey from Brindisi across the southern Adriatic to Dyrrachium. It is one of about a dozen portents that happened during his crossing or his landing or during that year. The passage does not seem worth quoting here, although it might interest a student of magic. There is a slight implication that the eclipse was placed at Rome. The eclipse is magical and has no reliability.“ (Robert R.

The year of CE 151 (Traditional BC 46, or a.u.c.708)
Julius Caesar who was in this year the “Pontifex maximus” (the pontiff), the consul and the dictator in one person, had reinstated the Roman calendar, inserting (or recovering) two intercalary of 27 days each, which were left out earlier in the period of the civil war. The numbers of the days in this year were 354 + 54 = 408 (Hungarian Calendar, edition 2004, p. 91-177)
The year of CE 152 (Traditional BC 45, or a.u.c.709)
The starting year of the Julian calendar, Julius Caesar is the absolute ruler of the whole Roman Empire. In this year he adopted Octavius, the later Emperor Augustus, and appointed him as his heir of his wealth.
The year of CE 153 (Traditional BC 44, or a.u.c. 710)
The devotees of the Republic headed by Brutus and Cassius killed Julius Caesar.
“Alleged eclipses from the time of Caesar” (Ginzel 31/2)
“The most remarkable of mere human coincidences was that which befell Cassius, who when he was defeated at Philippi, killed himself with the same dagger which he had made use of against Caesar. The most signal preternatural appearances were the great comet, which shone very bright for seven nights after Caesar’s death, and then disappeared, and the dimness of the sun, whose orb continued pale and dull for the whole of that year, never showing its or
65



dinary radiance at its rising, and giving but a weak and feeble heat. The air consequently was damp and gross for want of stronger rays to open and rarefy it. The fruits, for that reason, never properly ripened, and began to wither and fall of for want of heat before they were fully formed.” (Plutarch, Caesar) This solar eclipse really happened on Apr 11 in CE 153.

In the year of Poplicola and Nerva consuls there was a solar eclipse according to the Chronicon Paschale. This solar eclipse was observable in the whole basin of the Mediterranean Sea on Sept. 4. (Z.H.; The final countdown, p. 31-33)
The year of CE 166/Era 12
The History of the later Han (Hou Haushu) informs us that one Roman convoy reached the Chinese capital Luoyang in CE 166 (In the 9th year of Jen-hi period of Hau Huan-ti emperor). The convoy was sent by An-tun, the Roman emperor. The mainstream science is sure that An-tun was not else than Marcus Aurelius Antoninus. Some scholars, who do not prefer him, are ready to modify by five years the Chinese chronology in order to find an Antonius Pius. According to the Hungarian Calendar (HC) the “An-tun” of the History of the later Han is Mark Antony (Marcus Antonius).

The year of CE 191/Era 37/ SE 305-306th
(Traditional BC 8/BC 6/AD 1, or a.u.c.746/748/754)
This is the beginning of the Christian chronology, the traditionally accepted date of the birth of Jesus Christ. The academicians naturally also say that this statement about the birth date is completely false, although they used to determine an error of 5-7 years in connection with the birth of Jesus. The Hungarian Calendar maintains that the actual „error” is as large as 194 years and this error brings us to this year. The officially accepted error of 5-7 years is usually blamed on Dionysius Exiguus who lived 500 years later. However, as we will see later on in due course, the starting year which was determined by Dionysius using the retro-counting of time, is in correlation with the year of CE 191. And hereby let us fix once again our basic concept: the 1st year of the New chronology is the year of the birth of Jesus Christ, the year of the Incarnation of our Lord, which year is astronomically the same as the 195th year of the ancient Olympiads (195/1), or the 754th year of Rome’s foundation and the 312th years of the Seleucid chronology. The events preceding the birth of Jesus Christ are dated only from the 17th century by using the Before Christ (BC) indication. Experiencing such an extent of uncertainty, my dear Reader please do not be surprised that the original alteration (an error of 198 years) of the Hungarian Calendar from the traditional chronology gradually is reducing, first going down to 196/194 years, and then „shrinking” to 190 years in the period of the 9th century.
The year of CE 194/Era 40/SE 308-309th (Traditional BC 5/3 or a.u.c.749/751)
The hypothetical year of the birth of Jesus Christ, supposing that he lived up to 33 years of His age. SE= AG 309 – birth of Jesus Christ, according to Chronicon Edessa.
The year of CE 195/Era 41/SE 309-310th (Traditional BC 4/2 or a.u.c.750/752)
On January13 there was a lunar eclipse. Herod the Great presumably died at the end of January. (Ginzel 32) In this astronomical year the Jews, in the terms of the contemporary Julian calendar, observed the 32 hours old new moon crescent on March 29 at sunset, and this observation indicated for them the first day of the Nissan month. The celebration of Pascha which was to be held between Nissan 15 and Nissan 21 meant the celebration in the period of April 12-18. (Z. H.; The final countdown, p. 37-40)

The year of CE 196/Era 42, SE/B 310-311th (Traditional BC 3/BC 1 or a.u.c.751/753)
The astronomers scientifically used to call this year as the „zero” year, but the existing error of 196 years happily will free the astronomers from the inconvenience of such labeling. (Z. H.; La nueva cronologia, p. 61)
The year of CE 197/Era 43, SE/B 311-312th (Traditional BC 2/AD 1 or a.u.c.752/754)
In relation to this year Dio Cassius in his LV book indicates a solar eclipse during the consulship of L. Cornelius Lentulus and M. Valerius Messala. (Ginzel 33) The eclipse occurred on June 3 and the location can be the whole basin of the Mediterranean Sea. Delta T = zero sec! (JD ~ 1793166.15) A blatant error was made by the scientists when they analyzed this eclipse. Not finding any suitable solar eclipse around the Trad. BC 2, BC 3 years they slightly changed the names of the consuls in their original literary source, and made some additions to the source in brackets. And doing so they created a phantom solar eclipse for CE 5, which eclipse also is in difference of 8 years from the related Roman chronology, but it was really well observable for the contemporary people living near the Amazonas River. (See more details in my book; The final countdown, p. 27-30)

The year of CE 212/Era 58
(Traditional AD 14/16 or a.u.c.767/769)
This year is an unmovable corner-stone of the traditional historical chronology, since in this year Emperor Augustus died in Nola. “Let me start in an unorthodox way with my listing of an event from a traditionally
68



„false solar eclipse”, since in our chronology, as I have already mentioned, there is one absolutely safe corner-stone, which is the year of AD 14. For centuries the scientists tried to solve the problem: why is it that for that year which is determined with absolute certainty, suitable solar eclipse for Italy can not be found? . Up to the end of the 19th century there were heated debates caused by the fact that within the period starting from the beginning of the first century and ending at the death of Augustus Caesar on 19th of August, the scientists also could not find for Italy any solar eclipse which happened to be close to totality. The weakening of the preconditions for the search did not particularly help, since for the period of AD 8-AD 16 there is no solar eclipse that could be connected to the Romans. The believers in historically recorded eclipse had, as their counter-argument, the eclipse of 15th February AD 17. The track of this eclipse in Ginzel passes from Libya via Greece to the Danube delta, and the track thus crossed the Mediterranean. Of course the three year long period is too great, it would upset the chronology in full, would disturb the list of the consuls, and in general it would question all the results of the careful scientific activities which were performed earlier. Considering this danger the researcher reached a consensus, stating that 19th of August AD 14 (the day of the death) is indeed an unmovable chronological corner-stone, while, in relation to it, the solar eclipse of AD 17 is false. Naturally, the sources can not be silenced, which is why for more than one hundred years the systematical invalidation, doubting and discrediting of these sources continues. Using scientific methods I need hardly add. The result of 100 years in this vein prompts Schove’s reaction:
In ancient times the Sun was often credited with an eclipse around the time of the death of a famous person. Such a statement usually amounts to no more than a stock of literary compliment. Augustus seems to be no exception. (Schove, p.5)
In such case the typical counter-argument is immediately at hand, stating that the author is not contemporary, he was collecting data considerably later from uncertain sources and compiled his report from them. Using this method, in our case Dio Cassius (who is usually very respectable) also becomes discredited. (LVI, 29) Eusebius, who put his record in nice chronological order when saying „Defectio solis facta et Augustus...moritur” [Obscuration of the Sun happened and Augustus...died.], was accused that he „does not claim totality, or even that the eclipse occurred before the death of Augustus.” (Schove, p. 6) Naturally, Schove does not deny the existence of these sources, but he thinks that the false „solar eclipse of AD 17 is the probable basis for the reports of Dio and Eusebius.” And it is obvious in such cases, when the solar eclipse looked for (in the wrong place) can not be found, such an argument is formed that „there is possible confusion with the observed lunar eclipse of AD 14.” (Schove, p. 6)
69



It is our good luck that the 196/198 year long time-difference of the Hungarian Calendar gives us a surprising result: 58 years after the introduction of the Julian calendar, that is on 14th August CE 212, which is earlier by five days than the time of the death of Augustus, the various astronomical programs indicate a solar eclipse which completely satisfies all my needs. According to the illustrations of Oppolzer, Ginzel and Espenak (sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/eclipse.html) as well, the total solar eclipse can be observed at a nearly analogical area. The track of totality starts from the Spanish Carthago Nova at the moment of sunrise runs to the direction of Sardinia, while at Neapol, Nola and Arpi the darkness is total. In Rome there was morning time, the darkening of the sun was probably 98%. Since it is approximately a solar eclipse of West-East direction, it does not mean anything either that the illustration of Espenak indicates 2h 23m Delta – T for the given time-period. Let us specify the solar eclipse: HC/CE 212 Solar 212 Augustus 14 Total solar eclipse above Southern-Europe
Sources: Cassius Dio, Roman History, LVI, 29; “During a horse-race at the Augustalia, which were celebrated in honors of his birthday, a madman seated himself in the chair which was dedicated to Julius Caesar, and taking his crown, put it on. This incident disturbed everybody, for it seemed to have some bearing upon Augustus, as, indeed, proved true. For in the following year, when Sextus Apuleius and Sextus Pompeius were consuls, Augustus set out for Campania, and after superintending the games at Neapolis, passed away shortly at Nola. Indeed, not a few omens had appeared, and these by no means difficult of interpretation, all pointing to his fate for him. Thus, the sun suffered a total eclipse and most of the sky seemed to be on fire: glowing embers appeared to be falling from it and blood-red comets were seen. When a meeting of the senate had been appointed on account of the emperor`s illness, in order that they might offer prayers, the senate-house was found closed and an owl sitting on it hooted. A thunderbolt fell upon his statue that stood upon the Capitol and blotted out the first letter of the name “Caesar”. This led the seers to declare that on the hundredth day after that he should attain to some divine state. They deduced this from the fact that the letter “C” signifies “one hundred”among Latins, and the remainder of the word means “god” among the Etruscans. Now these signs appeared beforehand while he was still alive: but people of later days were struck also by coincidences in the case of the consuls and of Servius Sulpicius Galba.” Eusebius/Jerome (ed/Schoenr, II 1866,147 or ed. Fotheringham, 1923,253) “Defectio solis facta et Augustus...moritur.” Eusebius/Jerome
“Obscuration of the Sun happened and Augustus...died.”
I could actually end my study with the analysis of this solar eclipse. Determining the calendar by retro-calculation produces the solar eclipse (which was looked for during the last 400 years by the science) exactly at the time and place originally recorded, too improbable to be mere coincidence.
70



Augustus Caesar did not live to see his 76th birthday (autumnal equinox, 23rd of September), and just a bit earlier that that date ( 19th of August) we have an observable total solar eclipse in the area of Rome, Neapolis and Nola. By the way, my method of identification of this eclipse compliments the scientists who are studying the ancient world. They reconstructed carefully and very accurately the ancient relative chronology, and very rightly did not allow their well-established system to be disturbed by an indeed false solar eclipse which at a distance of 3 years from its rightful place. Now the Hungarian Calendar simply has the only task of screening out the non-contemporary literary sources, while academical science must declare that Ptolemy, or more precisely that humanist who forged under his name, is a swindler. (But not an ancient swindler, as Robert R. Newton had already qualified him. “The Crime of Claudius Ptolemy” 1977, the Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, Maryland 21218)

The year of CE 228 (Traditional AD 29/ AD 32 or AD 33)
“S. 228 March 23 UNRECORDED SOLAR ECLIPSE” (Schove, p. 37)
“And Phlegon also who compiled the Olympiads writers about the same things in his 13th book in the following words: ‘In the fourth year of the 202nd Olympiad (AD 32-33), an eclipse of the Sun took place greater than any previously known, and night came on at the sixth hour of the day, so that stars actually appeared in the sky; and a great earthquake took place in Bithynia and overthrew the greater part of Nicaea.”
From: Phlegon, Olympiades, fragment 17 (Ginzel 35) Quoted in Historical Eclipses and Earth’s Rotation, by F Richard Stephenson, Cambridge University Press, 1997, page 359-360 “+29 Nov 24 M (Plegon). Reference: Eusebius [ca325]. Eusebius was a famous church figure who took a leading part in the Council of Nicaea in 325. One of his many writings was the Chronicon, a chronicle of events from the time of Abraham to his time. The original has been lost but there are several replacements. Fortunately, the versions agree closely in the part of immediate interest, and we can safety assume for present purposes that we have a text close to the one that Eusebius wrote. Portions of the Chronicon are preserved in a text by Syncellus written about 800 and in Syriac epitome made about 635, but these have less evidential value. The passage of interest says approximately” ‘Jesus Christ, the Son of God, in accordance with the prophecies made about Him, went to His Passion in the 19th year of Tiberius; for this time we find indeed in different Greek records the following related word for word: the sun was extinguished, in Bithynia an earthquake happened, which overturned, the greater part of Nicaea, — that agrees with what happened at the Passion of our Lord. Thus Phlegon, who wrote the Olympiads, report the following word for word in his thirteenth book: ‘In the fourth year of the 202nd Olympiad, there was an eclipse of the sun which was greater than any known before and in the sixth hour of the day it became night, so that stars appeared in the heaven; and a great earthquake that broke out in Bithynia destroyed the greatest part of Nicaea. As it stands, this is a magical eclipse. It has to be magical if for no other reason than an unstated one: because of the way Passover is determined, the Crucifixion had to occur within a day or so of the full moon. Assimilation may underlie the magic... I see
72



no reason to attach any reliability to this record.” (Newton AAO 110-111)
This solar eclipse really happened on March 23 in CE 228, not in CE 29 November 24. The calculation of the Saros Series 62 is not accurate because of Ptolemy’s wrong phases of the Moon. (JD ~ 1804417) “CRUCIFIXION” LUNAR ECLIPSE IN JERUSALEM” In my opinion the three hours of darkness mentioned by Luke the evangelist is related to the lunar eclipse, which must be looked for somewhere at AD 29 + 198 years on one day earlier than the day preceding the Jewish Passover.
My suggestion is the total lunar eclipse [Luna XIV] of 7th of April in CE 228. The calculation of the Saros Series 74 is not accurate because of Ptolemy’s wrong phases of the Moon. (JD ~ 1804431.76 = [1804417 + 29.53/2])
The year of CE 240 (Traditional CE 45)
A new generation of 21st century philologist will learn a lot from the following solar eclipse, which occurred on the “birthday” of Emperor Claudius. Ginzel (p.237) gives it under serial-number 37. His source is Dio Cassius LX 26, Loeb Classical Library Translation by Earnest Cary. “25. The next year Marcus Vinicius and Statilius Corvinus became consuls, the former for a second time... 26. Since there was to be an eclipse of the sun on his birthday, he feared that there might be some disturbance in consequence, inasmuch as some other portents had already occurred; he therefore issued a proclamation in which he stated not only the fact that there was to be an eclipse, and when, and for how long, but also the reasons for which this was bound to happen. These reasons I will now give. The moon, which revolves in its orbit (or so it is believed), either directly below it or perhaps with Mercury an Venus intervening, has a longitudinal motion, just as the sun has and a vertical motion, as the other perhaps likewise has, but it has also a latitudinal motion such as the sun never shows under any conditions. When therefore, the moon gets in a direct line with the sun over our heads and passes under its blazing orb, it obscures the rays from
73



that body that extend toward the earth. To some of the earth’s inhabitants this obscuration lasts for a longer and to others for a shorter time, whereas to still others it does not occur for even the briefest moment. For since the sun always has a light of its own, it is never deprived of it, and consequently to all those between whom and the sun the moon does not pass, so as to throw a shadow over it, it always appears entire. This, then is what happens to the sun, and it was made public by Claudius at that time. But now that I have once touched upon this subject, it will not be out of place to give the explanation of a lunar eclipse also. Whenever, then the moon gets directly opposite the sun (for it is eclipsed only at full moon, just as the sun is eclipsed at the time of new moon) and runs into the cone-shaped shadow of the earth, a thing that happens whenever it passes through the mean point in its latitudinal motion, it is then deprived of the sun’s light and appears by itself as it really is. Such is the explanation of these phenomena. 27. At the close of that year Valerius Asiaticus and Marcus Silanus became consuls, the former for a second time.” [Suetonius says that the birthday of Claudius was August 1] In this case Ginzel does not let me down, since he doubts that anyone could see the eclipse in Rome with the naked eye. (AD 45, August 1). Of course, on the basis of the source-text, he points out that here we have a case with an event calculated in advance. Leaving Ginzel aside, the biggest problem with this solar eclipse remains the same, that it really could not be observed, but it is on this eclipse that the identification of the age and birthday of Claudius is based. After all, how could Cassius Dio, or more precisely John Xiphilinus “The Epitomizer” [what a nice name] know about this solar eclipse which can only be observed very well in the Dakar-Khartoum-Indian ocean area? Naturally, he tells us that the solar eclipse is result of calculation! The question arises: since when could people calculate solar eclipse? During the time of the emperors Claudius and Caracalla it is certain that they lacked the ability! My opinion in connection with this solar eclipse and birthday-date is that, in the days of Xiphilinus, [the precise dating of this time I leave to more professional researchers] efforts had already been made to retro-calculate solar eclipse with an accuracy of one day, for the whole of the Earth, but the determination of the track of their totality was still in its infancy. Anyhow, after that another historian, Suetonius, also connected the birthday of Claudius to this solar eclipse. Consequently he must be located into the times after Xiphilinus, since Suetonius mentioned 1st of august. This is the only message of this “predicted” solar eclipse for the source-critics dealing with Suetonius. Such a non-visible but calculated solar eclipse can shake the complete structural system of the science to its foundations, including the creditability of C-14 tests and the “science” of paleography! Naturally the dismissal of the wrongly identified (at AD 45) and retro calculated solar eclipse leads to a very serious consequence! Up to now it was the definite proof for the correct use and the leap year distribution of the Julian calendar, at a time 30 years after the death of Augustus Caesar. From this moment on, this proof can be forgotten forever. Moreover,
74



This solar eclipse was the one that was also used to prove the correctness of the AD year counting method arising only 500 years later. This solar eclipse had proved in a wonderful way that during the time of Caracalla the chronological concepts of the later Dionysius Exiguus and the Venerable Bede were already known to Dio Cassius...
And in a final addition the author of the source could ascertain when the emperor Claudius was born according the Julian Calendar, which is mathematically regular and retro-calculated to earlier time, and which is in use by astronomy in the 20th century (AD 1 = CE 1). This solar eclipse really happened on Augustus 5 in CE 240, not in CE 45 Augustus 1. Delta T = Zero sec! (JD ~ 1808934.95) (Z.H.; The final countdown, Budapest, 2007. p. 49-55)

The year of CE 252 (Traditional AD = CE 59)
Our next solar eclipse will be one retro-calculated for a period 200 years earlier. The line of events presented up to now show us clearly that the reign of Nero Caesar occurred somewhere between the period of CE 252 and 266. Consequently, Agrippa could not be killed on 30th April in CE 59, when there was a total solar eclipse visible to the south from Sicily. Pliny errs when he gives us the date with day-exactness, merely showing he can count. And he is sufficiently daring to give us the data about the hour for Armenia! (It happened in Campania between the 7th and 8th hour of the day, and in Armenia between the 10th and 11th hour.) It is very remarkable precision from the “ancient world”, from such an author, who at the same time has a very confused opinion about the names of the consuls supporting the appearance of the islet and in connection with the dates of the main corner-stones of the year. (Z.H.; The final countdown, Budapest 2007. p. 58-59) “ 59 Apr 30E. Reference: Ginzel (1899). Ginzel gives references to this eclipse from several ancient writers. Pliny the Elder (Natural History, Bk. II, 180) gives the most detail. The eclipse was observed in Campania between the 7th and 8th hours of the day, and in Armenia between the 10th and 11th hours. The Armenia observation is treated as the separate observation 59 Apr 30M. Pliny was a serious student of natural history among other things, and was killed on 79 Aug 25 while trying first to observe the great eruption of Vesuvius and later to rescue some friends (Pliny the Younger, ca 100, Letter LXV to Tacitus). He is often regarded as somewhat gullible and willing to accept the marvelous. This does not seem to warrant questioning the eclipse report, which he probably wrote close in time to the event, and which he seems to have been

interested in the difference in times between Armenia and Campania. I give this record a reliability of unity. The standard deviation of magnitude will receive the value 0.1 because eclipse predictions were rather reliable by now and may have been known to a number of people.” (Newton AAO 73-74) This solar eclipse rally happened on June 24 in CE 252, not in CE 59 Apr 30. (Ginzel 39) Delta T = Zero sec! (JD ~ 1813276)
The year of CE 266 (Traditional AD = CE 66 or 67)
“S. 266 Sept. 16 TOTAL IN SYRIA (NO RECORDED)” (Schove, p. 40) Studying the scientific literature on historical solar eclipses, I pay special attention to those events, which can be placed very firmly in time in the system of the traditional chronology, but for which, at the same time, you can find neither solar nor lunar eclipses near or far, for those same events. Two such events, that is, two solar eclipses, were recorded for us by Philostratus, and based on him the two eclipses used to be mentioned as “the solar eclipses of Apollonius”. I start with the first one, the identification of which is very problematical. The work of Philostratus, describing the life of Apollonius of Tyana, has for a long time been labeled as an historical novel. Probably this opinion was strengthened by the fact that his solar eclipses could not be identified. However, we can also learn from this work that shortly before the solar eclipse Apollonius met a flesh and blood, real consul, who held his office in AD 66. Based on this, in 1878 Seyffart identified our event as an event of AD 67 May 31, while the critical edition of the source refers to AD 64 Augustus 1. Of course neither is correct, in spite of the fact that Ginzel, although reluctantly, accepted Seyfart’s idea. Let us quote the source: Flavius Philostratus, “The life of Apollonius of Tyana, LCL, tr. F.C. Conybeare, 1960 “Just at the time when he was holding these conversations with the people of Hellas, the following remarkable portent overspread the heavens. The orb of the sun was surrounded by a wreath, which resembled a rainbow, but dimmed the sunlight. That the heavenly sign portended a revolution was of course clear to all.” (Ginzel 39/1)
Considering the offered location of Rome, and considering the 198 year shift of the Hungarian Calendar we can state that the Romans could observe a very spectacular solar eclipse on September 16 in CE 266 a little after sunrise. I think there is no need out that solar eclipse of CE 266 (identified by me) is not to be compared with the erroneous AD/CE 67 one, and there is no need to calculate the year-difference, which just results in 197 years. After all the above said, it remains only for the historians to consider that the consulship of Telesinus must be attached to this year! (Z.H.; The final countdown, Budapest 2007, p. 60-63) This solar eclipse rally happened on Sept 16 in CE 266 (Ginzel 39) Delta T = Zero sec! (JD ~ 1818472.855)

The year of CE 267 (Traditional AD = CE 69)
“DIO’S ECLIPSES OF VITELLIUS Lunar eclipses about AD 68-69. Various eclipses, some difficult to identify satisfactorily, are mentioned in Cassius Dio LXIV/LXV, 8 and 11, now extant only in the epitomes of Xiphilinus (11th century) and Zonaras (11th.12th century); The great confusion which under these conditions prevailed in the camp of Vitellius was increased that night by an eclipse of the moon. It was not so much its being obscured (though even such phenomena cause fear to men who are excited) as the fact that it appeared both blood-colored and black and gave out still other terrifying colors. Not even for this, however, would the men change their mind or yield; but when they came to blows each other, they fought most eagerly, although, as I said, the Vitellians were leaderless; for Alienus had been imprisoned at Cremona.” (Schove, p. 14-15) This lunar eclipse really happened on Aug 22 in CE 267. Death of Vitellius Dec 20 in CE 267! (AD 69)

“S. 272 Nov. 8 ANNULAR IN N. EGYPT (NO RECORD)” (Schove, p. 41) “M.71 march 4 and S.71 March 20 PLINY’S ECLIPSE PAIR For a year which is unclear, but certainly during the reign of Vespasian, the elder Pliny says, speaking of eclipses of the Sun and Moon, ‘For it has happened even in our time that both stars were missing within 15 days”. (Schove, p. 16-17) The first eclipse pair really happened on June 21 and July 5 in CE 270, not in CE 71. (In the year of the third consulship of the elder Emperor Vespasian ~ AD 72)
The second eclipse pair really happened on Nov 8 and Nov 22 in CE 272, not in CE 74. (The second consulship of the younger ~ AD 74) So, the back calculation of the Lunar Saros series –88 is not accurate!

The year of CE 272 (Traditional AD = CE 71/75/83)
“S. 272 Nov 8 ANNULAR IN N. EGYPT (NO RECORD)” (Schove, p. 41) “POSSIBLE SOLAR ECLIPSE OF PLUTARCH” Eclipse of Plutarch (probably AD 75 or 83). This eclipse, much discussed over the centuries, still lacks definitive identification. Plutarch wrote in Greek, but his works are usually known by their Latinized title. (Schove, p. 17-19) For centuries there have been attempts to identify a solar eclipse for the same period time, an eclipse connected to the name of Plutarch: “Now grant me that nothing that happens to the Sun is so like its setting as a solar eclipse. You will if you call to mind this conjunction recently which, beginning just after noonday, made many stars shine out from many parts of the sky and tempered the air the manner of twilight. If you have forgotten it...” (Fotheringham; Newton, 1970, p-114-117; Stephenson, p.360-364) “In summary, a date for the ‘eclipse of Plutarch’ of AD 71 Mar 20 seems very likely. However, since the historical details are somewhat tenuous and the above date has been derived only as the result of extensive astronomical computations, it would seem scarcely justifiable to use the eclipse to make any deductions on the value of Delta T. (Stephenson, p. 364) Since the scientists were looking for this eclipse in the wrong time-interval, it is not surprising that Robert R. Newton in 1970 wrote the following about it: “I do not take the passage from Plutarch to be a description of a specific eclipse. If it be one, it is unidentifiable both in time and place.” It is my pleasure to declare that the place is Greece, and the time is CE 272 Nov 8! (Z.H.; The final countdown, Budapest, 2007. p. 74)
The year of CE 277 (Traditional AD = CE 79)
Both Suetonius and Dio describe a comet that appeared before the death of Vespasian. The comet had a long, conspicuous tail and so was described as having log hair. The Roman people interpreted this as an omen that Vespasian would soon die. But Dio tells us: To those who said anything to him about the comet he said: This is an omen, not for me, but for the Parthian King; for he has long hair, whereas I am bald. Dio adds that the comet was visible for a long time. In CE 277, a comet was observed and recorded by the ancient Chinese astronomers. “In the 3rd year of same epoch (Han Ning), the 1st moon (February), there was a comet in the west. In the 3rd moon (April) it was in S. D.Wei. In the 4th moon the comet was in Neu Yu. In the 5th moon (June) it was in the east. Death of Vespasian (June 14) Accession of Titus.

The year of CE 292 (Traditional AD = CE 95)
“For those of my readers who still suspect that we only have an unlucky coincidence in connection with the 197/198 years, let us examine the “INVISIBLE ‘SECOND’ APOLLONIAN ‘ECLIPSE” of Philostratus: Based on the source this event is placed in the vicinity of AD 95, which is later by 28 years than the first eclipse. The academical standpoint in connection with this case is its complete rejection. The author also gives the location. Apollonius was in Greece. Here is the source: Flavius Philostaratus, ‘Life of Apollonius of Tyana’, VIII,23
‘...about this time while he was pursuing his studies in Greece, such an omen was observable in the heavens. A crown resembling Iris surrounded the disc of the Sun and darkened its rays.’ (Ginzel 41/1)
The source also indicates that the author speaks about an annular solar eclipse, and from Chapter 25 we can also learn that the event took place around the time of the assassination of Domitian, which happened on AD 96 September 18 in the usual chronology. Ginzel, in 1899, found no suitable eclipse around this time and location, so he regarded the description as referring to something other than an eclipse. Apart from this, other researchers have sometimes taken the passage, if hesitantly, as referring to the solar eclipse of AD 95 May 22, the track of totality of which start in the Indian Ocean and ends in the Pacific... I do not intend to follow them, since the annular solar eclipse of CE 292 May 4 was visible also at the required location that is in Greece! So, the back calculation of the Solar Saros Series –91 is not accurate!
The year of CE 295 (Traditional AD = CE 97/8)
“295 ANNULAR IN MEDITERRANEAN (NO RECORD)” (Schove, p. 42) GHOST ‘ECLIPSE’ OF NERVA’S DEATH Speaking of the emperor Nerva, Sextus Aurelius Victor, in the section of his Roman History entitled ‘De vita et moribus imperatorum Romanum’ often called the epitome, Chap XII (Nerva) par 13, says: ‘On the day on which he [Nerva] died, the eclipse of the sun took place.” (Schove, p. 20) The date of Nerva’s death, like the date of the death of Augustus, is an unmovable corner-stone with a day-exactness (which is AD 98 January 25) and for this date the usual chronology cannot offer anything, there was no solar eclipse in January, within the range of AD 97 and AD 99. “
81



Taking into consideration that here we have a less than two-year time-gap in comparison with the previous source of Philostratus, and supposing that our literary source from Victor recorded (copied?) for us the date of Nerva’s death with erroneous indication of the month and the day, it might be that the different sources relate to the same solar eclipse when mentioning Apollonius in Greece and Nerva in Rome. In this case we have real solar eclipse contrary to the traditionally “Ghost eclipse”. I am very confident in drawing the attention of the interested researchers to the date of 295 March 3, as the DATE OF THE NEW UNMOVABLE CORNER-STONE OF THE ROMAN HISTORY! Consequently the date of Nerva’s death is 295 March 3rd following the record of Sextus Aurelius Victor! (Z.H.; The final countdown, Budapest 2007, p. 67) This solar eclipse rally happened on Mar 03 in CE 295. (Ginzel 39) Delta T = Zero sec! (JD ~ 1828868)

“Two sources have been claimed as evidence for a sizeable solar eclipse visible at Rome in the reign of Commodus: Aelius Lampridius and Herodiani. The prodigies that occurred in his reign, both those which concerned the state and those which affected Commodus personally, were as follows. A comet appeared.” “ 186 Dec 28E. Reference: Ginzel (1899). Ginzel quotes a passage from the 4th century historian Lampridius who says that an eclipse was seen in Rome about Jan 1 during the reign of Commodus (180-192). There was only one eclipse that can meet these conditions. Unfortunately, the sun must have set at Rome while still eclipsed. Under these circumstances, even a small eclipse would be easily seen, and there is no clue to the magnitude. This eclipse will not be calculated.” (Newton AAO p.74) This solar eclipse really happened on April 15 in 386, not in CE 186 December 28. (Ginzel 42) Delta T = zero sec!

The year of CE 418 (Traditional AD = CE 218)
The only ancient writer to describe this eclipse for us, through his later epitomizer, is Cassius Dio. Speaking of the end of the 14-month reign of the usurper Macrinus (usual chronology AD 217 April – 218 June), he says:
“It seems to me that this also had been indicated in advance as clearly as any event that ever happened. For a very distinct eclipse of the sun occurred just that time and the comet was seen for a considerable period;”
Since it is a solar eclipse that passes over whole of the basin of the Mediterranean Sea in a West-East direction, there is no need to search eagerly for a specific location. As a place of observation I can accept Rome, Smyrna, Pergamun, whichever one the author could visit. This solar eclipse really happened on July 19 in CE 418, not in CE 218 October 7. (Delta T = zero sec! (JD ~ 1873932.1) (Ginzel 44) Needless to say, this solar eclipse once again is a VERY FIRM chronological cornerstone, and the ancient Roman history can be fixed to it very safety. Elagabalus proclaimed emperor at Raphaneae (16 May), after his supports defeat Macrinus, who is put to death. Elagabalus winters at Nicomedia. In CE 418, a comet was observes and recorded by the ancient Chinese astronomers. “In the 14th year of the same epoch, 5th moon, day Kang Tsze, there was a comet in Pih Tow Kwei, towards the middle. In the 7th moon, day Kwei Hae (September15) the comet appeared in the western part of Tae Wei, above Juy Ke, and below the star Leang.” (Z.H.; The final countdown, Budapest 2007, p. 84-87)

Firmicus Maternus was a Sicilian, and Ginzel quotes authority for his work being alredy completed before the death of Constantine. Firmicus, describing the fear caused by eclipses ‘in the middle of the day’, says, ‘speaking of the more recent’, that such a was predicted by astrologers (mathematici) in the consulate of Optatus and Paulinus.” (Schove, p. 50) This solar eclipse really happened on April 29 in CE 534, not in CE 334 July 17.

I do not know what caused me to make this blunder; I can only suppose that I mixed up some notes while I was writing the text. Although the duration is clearly exaggerated, it seems safe to accept this as a genuine record, but I shall lower the reliability to 0.5 because of the exaggeration. Because of the stars, I shall use 0.01 for the standard deviation of the magnitude.” (Newton 1972, p. 537)

References to such an eclipse appear not in Zosimus but in the secondary literature, and they do not have any basis in fact, since all we have encountered mention stars seen in the daytime, but there was no suitable eclipse between 402 and 418.” (Schove, p. 71)
Using the Hungarian Calendar we can determine with the exactness of the year and the month, the time when Rome was raided by Alaric, the king of Sarmatas/Getas. The date of CE 410, June 18, could not be the right one, firstly because of the visibility which was limited to Morocco, and secondly because it was not in August...

I suspect that Hydatius calculated the weekday using the date 419 Jul 19 by accident....Since Hydatius had earlier records that apparently come from Galicia, I shall assume that this is also a local record, but I shall lower the reliability to 0.2. Place: Galicia (Robert R. Newton, 1972 p. 508-509) This solar eclipse really happened on Aug 02 in CE 612, not in CE 418 Jul 19. (JD ~ 1944805.183)

“MISDATED ECLIPSE OF PROSPER Possible records formerly ascribed to S.421 May 17. Scal.1598, 573; 1629, 611, discusses records from South Gaul which we may call (i) Prosper, (ii) Pseudo-Prosper. Prosper is based on consular fasti (arranged by pairs of consuls); a standards edition is now Mommsen’s, under the title ‘Prosper Tiro, Epitoma Chronicon’. Pseudo-Prosper is a chronicle (arranged by regnal years), sometimes called Chronicon Pithoeanum. In Mommsen’s edition, (ii) does give, under the 26th year of Honorius (about 421) ‘This year an eclipse of the Sun occurred’. Scaliger noted this, and, calling on both (i) and another manuscript of (ii) for ancillary chronology, identified the eclipse as S. 421 May 17. Oppolzer shows this as approximately annular in West Africa (near Dakar) the South Sahara, and the southern part of the Red Sea – suspiciously far from Gaul.” (Schove p. 73-74) This solar eclipse really happened on May 21 in CE 616.

“GHOST ECLIPSE (AURORA?) OF JEROME (c. 398) Solar obscuration in a treatise of Jerome (about AD 398). Jerome, in a treatise addressed to Pammachius against John, bishop of Jerusalem, appears prima facie to speak of an eclipse: ‘a few months ago, about the days of Pentecost, when, the Sun being obscured, everyone feared that the day of judgement was already at hand.” (Schove p.64) This solar eclipse really happened on May 21 in CE 616.

MacAirt viewed as emendable to 445, and followed C.O’Connor (in his 1825 edition) and Anscombe in identifying the eclipse as S.445 July 20, an identification we have suggested is impossible, see L.Bieler, Irish Historian. Studies, 6. 1949, 252, citing a lecture in Dublin by D.J. Schove. Schove, JBAA, 65, 1954, 389, rejected the earlier eclipse as too late in the day, and too small in Ireland. The revised identification, S.447 Dec. 23, fits better.” (Schove p.76) This solar eclipse really happened on June 1 in CE 634!

The year of CE 639/Era 485 (Traditional AD = CE 447)
“447 Dec 23 E. By Hydatius ‘Ol. 306, 3 Yr 23 Valentinian III. The sun was eclipsed on the 10 Kalends (Some copies have 9 Kalends) of January, which was the third weekday. If ’10 Kalends’ is right, the date equels 447 Dec 23, a Tuesday. This report receives the same characteristics as the last two. Valentinian III was Emperor of the West from 425 to 455.”
(Robert R. Newton, AAO p.75) “447 Dec. 23 BW(?). Reference: Cambriae [ca 1288]. The first entry in Annales Cambriae, for the year 4 of the Welsh era, is : ‘ A day as dark as night.’ This corresponds to 448 if I am correct that the year 1 corresponds to 445. The next entry is for the year 9 (453); it records that Leo, bishop of Rome, changed the date of Easter. The Easter of 455 was one of the dates for which the rules of the Roman church and of the other churches gave different results. Easter would have been on April 24 according to usual rules, but the Roman church (see Section II. 2) wanted April 17. Pope Leo began arguing for April 17 as early as 452. Thus the chronology of Cambriae is fairly close even in the earliest entries. The entry does not necessarily refer to an eclipse. If it doesn’t refer to an eclipse, the only reasonable identification is 447 Dec 23. This date does not necessarily mean that the year 448 was an error according to the annalists’ customs; there were many conventions that put the date we call 447 Dec 23 into what we call the following year. We cannot have high confidence that the observation was made in Wales although it is plausible that such record could have been made there. There was probably church activity in Wales before this time, both as a result of Christian efforts under Roman Empire and missionary efforts from Ireland. Some Welsh monasteries may have been founded already. However, the entry is the kind of brief notice that could easily be taken from one place to another, and the observation may have been made on the continent. I shall calculate this eclipse on the assumption that it was observed at S. David’s, but with the low reliability of 0.05. I shall use a standard deviation of the magnitude of 0.1. Schove [1954], in his interesting study of early British references to eclipses, quotes what is probably a reference to the same eclipse in some Irish annals that I have not found. The eclipse was also reported from Spain by Hydatius [ca. 468]. There is little resemblance between the records, and it is unlikely that Hydatius is the source for the Welsh record.” (Newton 1972 MCRE p.208-209) “There is also a probable reference in MS. B of the so-called Annales Cambriae; e.g. in the edition by J.Williams ab Ithel we find under editorial 447 ‘Dies tenebrosa sicut nox’, ‘A day as dark as night’. The identification is fairly certain, but there is a difficulty, for the statement implies totality (or almost so), which is impossible in either Wales or Ireland. Thus the Welsh record, if literally true, comes from S.W. Europe, perhaps via Ireland. Newt. 1972, 208, rightly deals leniently with the editorial 447. The eclipse is placed in the fourth year of the Welsh Era of the Annales Cambriae, and normally AD WE = 444, so that WE 4 would normally mean AD 448; but the year beginning is uncertain, and about Christmas was common. Newt. appears to accept totality at face value (place St. David’s) but with low weight. The late Annales of Lund (or Esrom) have a milder statement on similar lines, under 447 or 448. They simply say ‘Hic dies tenebrosa fuit’, ‘In this year a dark occurred’; this
95



falls a little short of implying totality. Ginz 1899, 219 mentioned that eclipse must have been very striking in Denmark, but regarded the ultimate source as not yet determined, which seems to be still the case.” (Schove p.76) This solar eclipse really happened on Sep 03 in CE 639, not in CE 447 Dec 23.

The solar eclipse of Hydatius;
“SUNSPOT IN PORTUGAL ? It may be added that Hydatius has, under editorial AD 453 or 454 (29th or 30th year of Valentinian), a curious ‘a sign in the Sun at rising.” (Shove p.78)
“Hydatius says that there was a sign in the sun in the year that equals 454. There was a solar eclipse that should have been large in Galicia on 453 Feb 24. A sign put in the year 454 could be an eclipse in 453, but it could also be many other things. It is safest to ignore this report.” (Robert R. Newton; MEDIEVAL CHRONICLES AND THE ROTATION OF THE EARTH, p. 509) This solar eclipse really happened on Apr. 21 in CE 646, not in CE 453 February 24.

The year of CE 650 (Traditional AD = CE 458)
The solar eclipse of Hydatius; (458 May 28.) Ol. 310.1 (Ginzel 63) 2nd regnal year of Majorian in Italy and Leo in Constantinopolis
“On Wednesday, 28 May, from the forth hour to the sixth, the sun appeared to be diminished in the light of its orb to the appearance a crescent moon on the fifth or sixth day.” (Richard W. Burgess, The chronicle of Hydatius and the Consularia Constantinopolitana. Two contemporary Accounts of the Final Years of the Roman Empire, Oxford Univ. Press, 1997) “For 458 May 28, Hydatius lists a partial solar eclipse with an estimate of the magnitude; the sun was diminished until it appeared like a moon on its fifth or sixth day. While a partial eclipse with a measured magnitude is as good as a total eclipse, this measurement does not seem accurate enough to be valuable, especially since the place of the observation is uncertain.” (Newton AAO p. 76) “458 May 28 E, Sp. Reference: Hydatius.

’01. 309.3 (= 459). On the day 5th calends June (=May 28), the 4th feria, the sun appeared diminished in the brightness of its orb in the form of a moon of the 5th or 6th from the 4th hour to the 6th. The weekday is correct for the eclipse date 458 May 28 rather than for the day stated, thus the feria was not calculated at a later time. A moon 5.5 days old has about 1⁄4 of its surface illuminated. This corresponds to a magnitude of about 0.8. Reliability: 1. Place: Galicia. Magnitude: 0.8 with a standard deviation of 0.1; path north of Spain. I noted the existence of this record in AAO but did not use it.” (Newton, 1972 MCRE p. 509-510) “S. 458 May 28 (Wed.) PARTIAL SOLAR ECLIPSE IN PORTUGAL This eclipse is clearly referred to in the Chronicle of Hydatius: ‘In the first year of Majorian in Italy and Leo in Constantinople, in the 309th Olympiad, on 5.Kal.Jun. (=May 28), the fourth day of the week (Wednesday), from the fourth to the sixth hour, the Sun appeared reduced in the light of his orb to the figure of the Moon five or six days old’. The description implies a magnitude of 0.8 (Newt.1979, 459). Leo reigned from 457 Feb.7, Majorian from 457 April 1, and some editors give second (not first) year. Muralt misdated the eclipse 457. The track of totality goes across the Atlantic via the British Isles to Asia; the noon point is in the North Sea. Ginz.1886, 972 tabulated the part of the Oppolzer track which runs between Ireland and the North Sea, and found magnitude 0.775 at Chaves at 10.43 a.m. Ginz.1899, 221 found magnitude 0.78 at Chaves about 10.45 a.m., and pointed out that the magnitude corresponds to a six-day-old Moon (he referred to Isidore of Seville, Origines 3, 54, for terms describing sickle shapes of the Moon). The magnitude at Chaves was modest, but agrees tolerably with the statement of Hydatius, who, being interested in eclipse, may have been expecting this one. The eclipse is considered in Newt.1970, 76; 1972, 509. Identification goes back at least to Petav.1627, 847. The eclipse having been total in Britain, Schove, JBAA 65(1), 1954, 39, comments on its nonrecording in the British Isles.” (Schove p. 79) This solar eclipse really happened on February 6 in CE 650, not in CE 458 May 28.

The year of CE 654/Era 500 (Traditional AD = CE 462/463)
Hydatius, Ol. 310.3, (AD 463) 1-st regnal year of Severus. “In the province of Gallaecia various portentous manifestations were seen. VI non. Mar. (March 2), the cocks crowed at sunset and the full moon turned to blood. This day was a Friday” (Ginzel 64) “M.462 March 1-2 BLOOD-RED ECLIPSE IN PORTUGAL This eclipse also is clearly referred to in Hydatius: ‘In the first year of Severus, in the 310th Olympiad. in the province of Gallaecia various signs of portents are seen. [Aera D] 6.non.Mar. (March 2), from sunset (to) cock-crow the full Moon is turned to blood; it was the sixth day of the week (Friday)’. Severus began to reign on 461 Nov.19. ‘Aera D’ means Spanish Era 500, hence AD 462 (the difference in the reckonings being 38 years). Oppolzer gives magnitude 1.02 with mid-eclipse at 2.05 a.m., mean time at Greenwich, and a total duration of 3h20m (the duration of the eclipse is, of course, exaggerated in the record). Ginz. 1899, 221 finds magnitude 1.01 at 1.41 a.m., meantime at Chaves. Identification goes back at least to Petav.1627, 846. A probable brief reference in Fredegar, Book 2, Ch.7 would have been difficult to date it its wording had not suggested an abbreviated borrowing from Hydatius.” (Schove p. 79-80) This lunar eclipse really happened on May 7 in CE 654, not in CE 462 March 2. The calculation of the Lunar Saros Series – 80 is not accurate because of Ptolemy’s wrong phases of the Moon. (JD ~ 1960058)
The year of CE 655 (Traditional AD = CE 464)
Ol. 311.1 (Ginzel 65) 2nd regnal year of Severus “On Monday, 20 July, from the third hour to the sixth, the sun was perceived to be diminished in its light to the appearance of the moon on the fifth day.” “464 Jul 20 E, Sp. Reference: Hydatius. ’01.311.1 (=465). On the 13th calends August (= Jul 20), the 2nd feria, the sun was decreased in its light in the form of a 5th moon
100



from the 3rd hour to the 6th.’ 464 Jul 20, rather than 465 Jul 20, was on the 2nd feria. A moon 5 days has about 1/5 of its surface illuminated, so it will be sufficiently accurate to use 0.85 for the magnitude. Reliability: 1. Place: Galacia. Magnitude: 0.85 with a standard deviation of 0.07; path north of Spain. For the last two reports [458, 464], I have taken the standard deviation of the magnitude to be about half the difference between totality and the estimated magnitude.” (Newton 1972 MCRE, p.510) “S.464 July 20 (Mon.) SOLAR ECLIPSES PARTIAL IN PORTUGAL AND LARGE IN SYRIA This is the last eclipse unmistakably in Hydatius: ‘In the second year of Severus, in the 311th Olympiad (should be 310th), on 13.Kal.Aug. (=July 20), the second day of the week (Monday), from the third to the sixth hour, the Sun is observed to be diminished in its light to the figure of a 5-day-old Moon’. Severus began to reign 461 Nov.19, and some editors put the eclipse in his third (not second) year. This description enables Newt.1979 (354, 372, 459) to estimate its magnitude as 0.85+/- 0.075. The track of annularity runs from the Atlantic to approximately Brittany, Northern France, Central Europe, South Russia to the Himalayas. The Western European part of the Oppolzer track is tabulated in Ginz.1886, 972, which gives the greatest magnitude at Chaves as 0.82 about 7.07 a.m. Ginz.1899, 222 finds the greatest magnitude at Chaves to be 0.91 at 7.01. a.m. The times are perhaps a little earlier than one would expect from the record. Identification goes back at least to Petav.1627, 848. See also Louis du Four de Longuerue, Disquisitio de annis Childerici I Francorum regis. The eclipse is mentioned vaguely in Fredegar. It has recently been dealt with in Newton 1972, 510.” (Schove p.80) This solar eclipse really happened on April 12 in CE 655, not in CE 464 July 20. (JD ~ 1960397.9)

101



in Gaul and reported by an embassy which returned in the second year of Anthemius (whose reign began on 467 April12). We read of ‘another sun seen after sunset’. Newt.1972, 510 thinks that the passage may refer to the partial lunar eclipse of 467 June 3. No other lunar eclipse was visible in Western Europe until autumn of 469, although the comet of 467 seems to account for the remark. The sunspot maximum was uncertain, so that an auroral corona is possible.” (Schove p. 80-81) “Hydatius record for ’01. 311.4’ (=468) exists only in a fragmentary form. The isolated words ‘setting of the sun’ occur in it. There were no lunar eclipses in 468. The solar eclipses of 468 May 8 and 468 Nov 1 should not have been visible in Spain. Since Hydatius’ dates are often 1 year too late, we should also try 467. The solar eclipse of 467 Mar 19 would have been a small eclipse visible only in the morning if at all. The lunar eclipse of 467 Jun 3 would have begun at about 19h 30m local time in Galicia and this is also about sunset there on Jun 3. Thus there is a reasonable chance that Hydatius recorded the lunar eclipse of 467 Jun 3, but there is not enough certainty to let us use the record.” (Newton 1972 MCRE, p.510) This lunar eclipse really happened on August 18 in CE 658, not in CE 467 June 3.

As Leo ascended the throne in 457 Jan., this is a reference to S.464 July 20, with an error of one year. Ginz.1899 shows a brief stretch of the band of annularity running north of the Sea of Azov and through the North-Central part of the Caspian Sea. The source of Agapius may thus have been from Armenia.” (Schove p. 80) This solar eclipse really happened on January 28 in CE 659, not in CE 464 July 20.

“497 Apr 18. Reference: Marcellinus. The entry for the year that can be identified as 497 contains: ‘An eclipse of the sun appeared.’ Unfortunately this brief record cannot be identified safely because there were two significant eclipses in both Constantinople and Illyrica within sitxth month of each other. The eclipse of 496 Oct 22, we estimate roughly from the chart in Oppolzer, had a magnitude of about 0.7 in Constantinople or Illyrica. The eclipse of 497 Apr 18 had a magnitude of perhaps 0.8 in Constantinople and somewhat less in Illyrica. Hence there is a good chance that either eclipse would be recorded. The chronology in Marcellinus is usually fairly good, but we cannot rely upon it to resolve an interval as short as six months. Since 497 is apparently the year intended, and since the eclipse of 497 Apr 18 was somewhat larger in Constantinople than the other one, that identification is more probable. However the probability is not high enough to let us use this record.” (Ginzel 68, Newton, 1972 MCRE p. 541-2) “497 Apr 18. References: Ulster.

Clemens, though a classical author, is not an ancient author, but he can be studied by the methods used for one: The quotations clearly show that Clemens saw a total solar eclipse some time before he wrote this work, say between 1850 and 1900 if we pretend that we do not know the exact date of publication.

usually know the date of writing only within a few decades. We know where Clemens lived and we make a preliminary identification of possible eclipses from the charts in Oppolzer [1887]. The eclipses of 1854 May 26, 1869 Aug 7, and 1900 May 28 are good possibilities; other could be admitted with lower probability. We carefully calculate the local circumstances of each eclipse for Clemens’ current home, ignoring the possibility that he might have been traveling. We identify the eclipse as the one with greatest calculated magnitude. We then use this possibility alone using the eclipse to improve the astronomical constants or the accelerations. It is doubtful that anyone would analyze Clemens’ text in this way, but the pretended analysis illustrates three main points that are relevant to the treatment of some ancient ‘eclipse records’ in the current literature. First we can almost surely disprove an eclipse sighting by Clemens on the basis of independent evidence. We cannot usually do this with ancient writer. Thus ignorance, the inability to disprove, has often been equated with an assessment of high reliability. Second, if the reader will study carefully the rules of the peculiar game that has been played, which I shall call the ‘ identification game’, he will see that they lead to a successful ‘identification’ for almost any set of times and places chosen at random. It is only necessary for there to be a modest uncertainty in either the time or place. Further, the calculated path of the ‘identified’ eclipse, by the rules of the game, passes close to some chosen point. Thus, if the ‘eclipse’ report is used to improve the constants that went into the eclipse computation, by making the calculated path go through the chosen point, it is almost guaranteed that the changes in the constants will be acceptably small. Finally Clemens did not need to see an eclipse at all in order to write the passages quoted. He was a skillful and imaginative writer and could have written the passages on the basis of his reading alone. Alternately, his use of an eclipse could have been suggested by seeing a small one or by seeing an eclipse prediction in a newspaper or almanac. By a ‘literary eclipse’, I shall mean one that has been inserted into a work of conscious literary invention. A literary eclipse should be assigned a reliability of zero; it usually comes from imagination and not observation. An exception should be made only if there are strong grounds for believing that the writer did not have access to written or oral descriptions of eclipses (If independent evidence should be found that a writer had in fact witnessed an eclipse, that evidence should be used, but not the literary description).” (Newton AAO p. 45-47) This solar eclipse really happened on June 3 in CE 718 (JD ~ 1983461.12)

The year of CE 721/SE 837 (Traditional AD = CE 525/526)
“An 837. En lequel le soleil s‘ eclipsa au milieu du jour.‘ With Elias, Seleucid 837 means AD 526-6, and the year begins on Oct.1; thus this year is correct. It would be a surprise to find Syriac writer able to mention an eclipse, some five centuries earlier, with its noon point two thousand miles south of Syria. He frequently indicates is source, but unfortunately not here. His sources in general include both Christian and Islamic writers.” (Schove p. 94) This solar eclipse really happened on September 26 in CE 721 Delta T = zero sec!

“S. 732 Mar 1 TOTAL IN S.E. ISLAM BUT NO RECORD” (Schove, p. 150) “Agapius speaking of Justinian, says: ‘In the eighth year of his reign, there was an eclipse of the Sun, on the 29th of Nisan (April), at two hours in the afternoon.’ Justinian was emperor from 527 April 1, sole emperor from 527 Aug.1, so that the year is reasonable. But in the afternoon is quite wrong; no doubt the second hour of the day is meant.” (Schove p. 95) “536 Mar. /537 June VOLCANIC DARKNESS” “Most contemporary reports are no longer extant, but they were summarized later by Michael, probably after John of Ephesus, whose work is partly lost. ‘... in the year of the Greeks 848 (i.e. AD 536) there was a sign in the Sun.” (Schove p. 95-96) This solar eclipse really happened on March 1 in CE 732 Delta T = zero sec!

“538 Feb 15 E. This record is best discussed along with the record for 540 Jun 20 E.” (Newton AAO p.76) “536 Sep 1 (?). Reference: Procopius, De Bello Vandalico, Book II Chapter 14, p.469. Procopius was a Byzantine writer, but this observation, if that is what it is, was made in Italy. Procopius writes: ‘There was a grave portent that year. Indeed for the entire year the sun sent forth his rays without his usual brilliance, like the moon . . . From this it happened that neither war nor famine nor any manner of deadly evil ceased to beleaguer mankind. That was the tenth year of Justinian’s reign.” (Newton 1972, p. 458) This solar eclipse really happened on Augustus 14 in CE 733, not in CE 538 February 15.

The year of CE 735 (Traditional AD = CE 540)
“In the year 540, an eclipse of the sun happened on the 20th of June, and the stars appeared during almost half an hour after the third hour of the day” (Bede: Ecclesiastical History of England, V, 24)
“A.D. 540. This year the sun was eclipsed on the twelfth day before the calends of July; and the stars showed themselves full night half an hour after nine a.m.” (AngloSaxon Chronicle I 28 II 15) “540 Jun 20 E. References: Ginzel [1899]; Bede. Ginzel quotes a passage from a document found in Ravenna that I have not seen directly: ‘Fourth year of Belisarius and fourth year of Straticus, there was darkness from the third till the fourth hour of the day on Saturday.’ Bede writes: ‘In the year 538, there happened an eclipse of the sun, on the 16th of February, from the first to the third hour’. ’In the year 540, an eclipse of the sun happened on the 20th of June, and the stars appeared during almost half an hour about the third hour of the day.’ The quotations are from the translation mentioned in the citation. These are two of three solar eclipses recorded by Bede. The statements are taken from annals and may be given a reliability of unity. Neither document states anything specific about the magnitude of the eclipse of 538, so I give it a standard deviation of 0.06 in magnitude. ‘Almost half an hour’ sounds a little long
110



for stars to remain visible, except possibly for Venus, but time-keeping was rather informal then and this duration can be ignored. On the basis of the stars, I give the eclipse of 540 a standard deviation of 0.01 in magnitude. The main problem concerns the place of these observations. Bede was writing an ecclesiastical history of England and drew mostly upon local sources for the history before his own time. However, he includes some general history and for this he used Continental sources. It is quite possible that he did not realize how narrow the zone of a total solar eclipse is and hence did not realize that a Continental eclipse observation does not necessarily apply to England. The charts in both Oppolzer’s and Ginzel’s canons of eclipses show that the eclipse of 538 Feb 15 passed through the eastern Mediterranean and that the eclipse of 540 Jun 20 passed along the Mediterranean and the southern part of Europe. It is unlikely that either eclipse, and particularly the one in 538, would have been reported from England, and it is most unlikely that stars would have been visible in England during the 540 eclipse. Further, the conditions of life in England at the time were unfavorable to making and recording such observations; the first official church presence in England dates from 597. In spite of this, I would have assigned the places of observation to be somewhere in England if I had not found the Ravenna document. The Ravenna document gives the only cue we have about a place of observation, and it is not satisfactory. There is one report but there were two eclipses. According to Ginzel, the listing of Belisarius and Straticus as consuls identifies the year as 539. This does not agree with either eclipse. ‘Saturday’ does not help because it too does not agree with either eclipse. Since there is no way to choose, Ginzel labels the Ravenna record as ‘538 or 540’. It seems possible that the compiler of the Ravenna record accidentally ran two records together and that the single record does in fact refer to both eclipses, but there is no evidence that this actually happened. The Ravenna record does nothing more than establish the fact of a Continental record for at least one of the eclipses of 538 and 540, and hence it gives credibility to a nonEnglish source for Bede’s reports. The Ravenna record is certainly not the record used by Bede. If it refers to both eclipses, it is almost surely not an original record. However, it is most unlikely that eclipse reports originated from England, and Ravenna is the only place we have, so I shall use it. I shall indicate lack of faith in the choice and keep it from having much importance by assigning a standard deviation of 10° to the longitude. Attribution of a Continental source for these records does not imply that Bede traveled there; that is a separate question.” (Newton AAO p.76-78) This solar eclipse really happened on December 19 in CE 735, not in CE 540 June 20.

The year of CE 743 (Traditional AD = CE 547)
“S. 547 Feb. 6 ECLIPSES OF COSMAS (IN EGYPT?) M. 547 Aug. 17 These two eclipses are easily identified as those mentioned in Book vi of the Topographia Christiana of Cosmas (‘Indicopleustes’) of Alexandria, apparently written close to the time of the eclipses. Cosmas refers to both eclipses as predicted to Alexandria by one Stephan of Antioch; he mentions that the solar eclipse actually occurred, but is silent on whether the lunar eclipse was seen. Ginz. 1899, 225 gives both Greek and a German translation. Greek text and French translation appear in the edition by Wanda Wolska-Conus, Tome III. As Cosmas gives no specific time of day, the interest is primarily calendrical. The dates provide a good example of the working of the Egyptian calendar in its Julian form, with fixed year-beginning Thoth 1 = Aug.29, twelve months each of 30 days, and 5 or 6 supplementary days. Cosmas gives the dates as Mechir 12 and Mesori 24; on the scheme just stated, the 12th of Mechir (sixth month) is Feb.6, and the 24th of Mesori (the twelfth month) is, when no leap year is involved, Aug.17. Since there were eclipses on those dates in AD 547, Ginz. has no hesitation in confirming the identifications made by J. Krall in 1890. In treating of this matter, J.B. Bury has Mesori 14 by misprint for Mesori 24. The solar eclipse was total in or near Nubia, India and China; Ginz. finds magnitude 0.50 at Alexandria about 8.35 a.m. The lunar eclipse was partial, and took place there entirely after Alexandria midnight. The solar eclipse is accepted by Newt.1979, 387, but he points out that Cosmas was famous for his travels and we should not necessarily assume that the observation was made in Alexandria. A solar eclipse of 0.5 is not likely to have been noticed.” (Schove p. 98-99/ Ginzel 72) This solar eclipse really happened on January 30 in CE 743, not in CE 547 Feb. 6. (JD ~ 1992468.1)

The year of CE 753 (Traditional AD = CE 563)
“Once on the first day of October, the sun was in eclipse, so that less than a quarter of it continued to shine, and the rest was so dark and discoloured that you would have said that it was made of sackcloth. Then a star, which some call a comet, appeared over the region for a whole year, with a tail like a sword, and the whole sky seemed to burn and many other portents were seen”(Gregory of Tours, The history of Francs, IV, 31. Penguin classics, London) (Ginzel 73) “563 Oct 3 E,F. Reference: Gregory of Tours, which says in Chapter 4.31: ‘... on the calends of October the sun was so obscured that not a fourth part of it remained shining, but it appeared hideous and discolored like some sort of bag.’ This appears in the chapter that Gregory devoted to signs near this time, and the year is not given exactly. However there does not seem to be any question about the identification of the eclipse, even though the day of the year is wrong by 2. The eclipse was in Gregory’s time, but this does not sound like a strictly contemporaneous account and I shall give it reliability of

And a star, which some call a comet [AD 565 DJS], having a ray like a sword, appeared over that region for a whole year, and the sky was seen to burn, and many other signs appeared.’ Following Struyck 1740, 113, the passage is generally accepted as referring to the annular eclipse of 563 Oct.3, not quite on the kalends of October. The comet is that of 565. The track of annularity runs from near Iceland to Russia and China, so that the eclipse was not very large in France. Thin cloud or haze must have made the observation possible.” (Schove p.100) This solar eclipse really happened on January 9 in CE 753, not in CE 563 October 3. Delta T = zero sec! (JD ~ 1996100)

“When I was celebrating Mass on Saint Martin’s Eve, which is 11 November, a remarkable portent was seen in the middle of the night. A bright star was seen shining in the very center of the moon, and other stars appeared close to the moon, above it and below. Round the moon stretched the circle which is usually a sign of rain. I have no idea what all of this meant. This same year the moon often appeared in eclipse ant there were loud claps of thunder just before Christmas.” (Ginzel 75, Gregory of Tours, The history of Francs, V, 23.) “M. 577 Dec. 11 LUNAR IN FRANCE There is a lunar entry in Gregory. The entry is for a year usually taken to be 577 (or rather the second year of Childebert II, running from 576 Dec. 25 to 577 Dec.24). After mentioning a lunar phenomenon (near-by stars, etc.) on 3.Id.Nov. (= Nov.11), which is not said to be an eclipse date, Gregory continues his signs and portents with: ‘In that year we frequently saw the Moon turned black.’ In fact M.577 Dec.11 is the only lunar eclipse listed by Oppolzer for 577.” (Schove p. 101) This lunar eclipse really happened on April 18/19 in CE 767, not in CE 577 Dec. 11 (JD ~ 2001312.52)

The passage appears to relate to the year 580 (or rather the fifth year of Childebert II, running from 579 Dec.25 to 580 Dec.24). It says’ the Moon was darkened and a comet appeared.’ There was no lunar eclipse in 580, and the passage is usually taken to refer to the partial lunar eclipse of 581 April 5.” (Schove p. 102) “In the 5th year of the same epoch, the 4th moon, day Ke Wei, there was a comet in Whoo Chay. Its luminous envelope appeared much disordered. It was about 30 cubits in length. In the 5th moon, day Ke Maou, the comet was seen in the north. Its colour was white. On the day Kwei Wei it went to the east, and approached the middle star of Pa Kuh. In the 6th moon, day Kwei Maou, it came near San Kung. On the day Ke Wei it disappeared.

“A dispute arose about the date of the Easter, because Victorius, in his cycle, had written that Easter should be celebrated on the fifteenth day after the full moon. To prevent this Christian holding the feast on the same day after the full moon as the Jews, Victorius added: ‘The Church of Rome celebrates on the twenty second day.’ As a result many people in Gaul hold Easter on the fifteenth day, but I myself kept the feast on the twenty-second day. I made careful inquiries and discovered that the Spanish Springs, which flow by divine agency, began to run on the day which I had chosen for Easter. There was a great Earthquake very early in the morning on Wednesday 14 June, just as the day began to dawn. There was an eclipse of the sun in the middle of October. The sun’s rays were so diminished that it gave no more light than the honored moon when five days old.” (Gregory of Tours, The history of Francs, X, 23. Penguin classics, London) (Ginzel 78) “590 Oct 4 E,F. Reference: Gregory of Tours, who writes in Chapter 10.23: ‘Then the sun suffered an eclipse during the 8th month and its light diminished until the part remaining in light had horns like a 5th moon.’ I believe that ‘8th month’ means October in its original literal meaning and that ‘like a 5th moon’ means like the moon when it is 5 days old. A moon that is 5 days old has about 0.25 of its surface illuminated, so I shall take the magnitude of the eclipse to be 0.75 of the area. This is equivalent to a magnitude of about 0.8 as defined in Section IV.5. I shall use this as the magnitude, with a standard deviation of 0.1. Place: Tours. There is no question about the identification of the eclipse, and the account was written within a short time of the eclipse. Hence I shall use a reliability of 1. The path is assumed northeast of Tours.” (Newton, 1972 MCRE p. 322-323) “S.590 Oct.4 PARTIAL SOLAR IN FRANCE Gregory of Tours has apparently in the fifteenth year of Childebert and the twentyninth year of Guntram: ‘The Sun suffered an eclipse in the middle of the eighth month:

and its light diminished, that what it has available was scarcely as much as the horns of a five-day-old Moon have.’ In Gregory ‘the eighth month’ normally means October. In spite of ‘the middle of the eighth month’, the eclipse occurred on 590 Oct.4. There is no doubt about the year, because it was one of the occasional years in which the Easter cycle of Victorius of Aquitaine mentions rival dates on the fifteenth and twenty-second days of the Moon, and Gregory alludes to the fact in the same chapter. The eclipse was nothing like total in France. Correct identification goes back at least to Petavius 1627, 852.” (Schove p.103) This solar eclipse really happened on August 16 in CE 779, not in CE 590 October 4. (JD ~ 2005638.79)

“In the thirtieth year of the reign of the aforesaid prince [Guntram], our Lord’s garment... In this year there was an eclipse of the moon; and in the same year war broke out between the Franks and the Bretons on the banks of the river Vilaine.” (Ginzel 79/The Fourth Book of the Chronicle of Fredegar and Continuations. IV. 12) “M. 590 Oct. 18 PARTIAL LUNAR IN FRANCE Fredegar has, in the 30th year of the reign of Guntram, usually taken to coincide mainly with AD 590, ‘In this year the Moon was eclipsed’. There was a partial eclipse of the Moon on 590 Oct. 18. It may puzzle readers that the solar eclipse which Gregory of Tours puts in the 29th year of Guntram is usually identified as S.590 Oct.4, while the lunar eclipse which Fredegar puts in the 30th year of Guntram is usually identified as M.590 Oct.18. But Fredegar is known to number the years of Guntram’s reign differently from Gregory. Common matter is slight, and there is not complete consistency, but, in general, Fredegar’s year number in Guntram’s reign is one more than Gregory’s. Thus, Greogory’s 29th year of Guntram and Fredegar’s 30th year of Guntram contain common matter, namely a campaign of the Franks against the Bretons ( Beppolen killed, Ebrachar disgraced). This year of Guntram’s reign coincides largely with what we now call AD 590 (Gregory of

“592 Mar 19. Reference: Fredegarius Scholasticus:‘In the 32nd year of the reign of Guntram, the sun was eclipsed from morning to midday, so that hardly a third of it was seen.’ Guntram or Gontram was king of Burgundy from 561 to 593, and 592 was thus the 32nd year of his reign. Further, Oppolzer shows that the eclipse of 592 Mar 19 should have been in the morning in Burgundy. In spite of this agreement we cannot regard the identification as secure. The eclipse of 594 Jul 23 was also in the morning and it should have had about the same magnitude in Burgundy as the eclipse of 592 Mar 19. The chronology definitely excludes the eclipse of 594 Jul 23 if we can accept it as accurate, but mistakes of 2 years in the date of an event are unfortunately rather common. Therefore I shall assume that the probability is 0.5 that the identification of 592 Mar 19 is correct. Since the account is not quite contemporaneous, I shall further lower the reliability to 0.25. Place: 7th century Burgundy, as defined in the preceding section. Magnitude: 2/3 with a standard deviation of 0.1; path south of Burgundy.” (Ginzel 80, Newton 1972, p. 323)
“Fredegar, Book 4, Ch 13 has: ‘In the 32nd year of Guntram’s reign the Sun was eclipsed from dawn to midday to the extent that the third part of it was scarcely visible.’ As we have explained, the 32nd year of Guntram is usually taken to coincide mainly with AD 592.” (Schove p. 106) This solar eclipse really happened on June 15 in CE 782, not in CE 592 March 19.

“S. 786 Apr 3 TOTAL SOLAR IN MIDDLE EAST BUT NOT RECORD” (Shove, p. 162) “The 10th century Syriac writer Agapius, 8(3), 1912, 447, says, under Maurice: ’Next year, which was the 903rd year of Alexander, in the month of Adar (March), in the middle of the day, there was an eclipse of the Sun.’ The 903rd year of Alexander was AD 591-2 (autumn to autumn in Syria), and the passage clearly refers to S.592 March 19. Michael, X, 23, 1963, 373, states ‘there was an eclipse of the Sun, and darkness there, on March 10 from the third to the sixth hour. Everyone said that the Sun obscured itself because of the massacre of the monks, servants of Christ.’ This is evidently a Greek, not a Syrian, record.” (Schove p.105-106) “590 Oct 4. Reference: Simocatta. ‘Not moved by their entreaties, the emperor Mauricius went out of the palace and proceed one and one-half parasangs to the Hebdomon, as it is called in Byzantium. That day there happened a very great eclipse of the sun. Then there arose a violent roaring south wind, that almost tore the pebbles from the depths of the sea.” (Stephenson, p. 542) This solar eclipse really happened on April 3 in CE 786, not in CE 592 March 19, or CE 590 October 4.

The year of CE 787 (Traditional AD = CE 591/592/594)
“591 Sep 23. References: Ulster and Scotorum. This report is best discussed along with the following one.” “592 Mar 19. References: Ulster and Scotorum. Ulster has: ‘Defectio solis .i. mane tenebrorum’ for an unspecified day in the year 591. Ulster also has: ’Matutina tenebrosa’ for an unspecified day in 592. MacCarthy unquestioningly accepted these records of the two eclipses stated. Both records really say the same thing, namely that there was darkness or a failure of the sun in the morning. This statement does not reasonably apply either eclipse in Ireland. The fact that both records say essentially the same thing raises the possibility that one and not two eclipses are meant (That is, the same eclipse may have been recorded in two ancient sources, but under different years because of dating error. The compilers of Ulster could then have interpreted the records as reports of different eclipses.). The suspicion is reinforced by the fact that Scotorum has but one entry, which is for the year 590: ‘Defectus solis, tenbrarum.’ An embarrassing number of eclipses occurred near the years 591 and 592. The eclipse of 590 Oct 4 passed through southern Norway and was largest in Ireland at perhaps 11h. The eclipse of 591 Mar 30 passed through northern Africa at about sunset. The eclipse of 591 Sep 23 passed almost through Dakar and was largest in Ireland sometime in the morning. The eclipse of 592 Mar 19 passed through southern Italy and was largest in Ireland at about 11h. The eclipse of 594 Jul 23 was probably total in Ireland shortly after sunrise. Finally, the eclipse of 596 Jan 5 crossed the Alps near sunset. The only two of these to which ‘early morning’ could properly be applied in Ireland seem to be those of 591 Sep 23 and 594 Jul 23. It is questionable whether the first of these would have been seen in Ireland. I think that the most likely explanation of the entries is that all entries refer to the eclipse of 594 Jul 23. I shall assign zero reliability to this identification. However, I shall calculate the circumstances of the eclipses of 590 Oct 4, 591 Sep 23, 592 Mar 19, and 594 Jul 23 for the center of Ireland, in order to get better estimates of the times and thus to see whether a stronger identification can be made. The results will be presented in Section XVII.2. Schove said of the two entries In Ulster: ‘...it seems probable that the first reference is a further continental import, particularly as a word for eclipse was not likely to have been known to the original annalists.’ However, the Irish church was well established by 590, and the annalists, who were apparently church people since they worked with Easter tables, should have been well acquainted with Latin. Hence they would probably know a word for eclipse, whether there was a special term for one in the native language or not. It should be noticed that the early part of the annals, at least in their present form, is in Latin. Schove concluded that the second entry in Ulster was perhaps a record of the eclipse of 594 Jul 23. He did not consider Scotorum. The early French source ‘Fredegarius Scholasticus’ does indeed report an eclipse ‘a mane usque ad mediam diem’ (from early morning to midday); he states the explicitly that the eclipse was partial. It does not seem likely to me that ‘Fredegarius Scholasticus’ is the source used by the Irish annalists, but the possibility cannot be definitely denied. My feeling arises from the great disparity in wording; neither Irish record is merely an
121



abbreviated form of the French. In Section X.3 I conclude, somewhat uncertainly, that the French record refers to the eclipse of 592 Mar 19.” (Newton 1972, p.189-91) “S. 594 July 23 TOTAL SOLAR IN BRITISH ISLES The track of totality starts at sunrise in the Atlantic, passes via Ireland and Britain to a noon point in Russia, then on to China where it would have been very striking. The eclipse is recorded in Irish annals. There are certainly one or two solar eclipses mentioned in Irish annals around AD 590-4; all records refer to a morning eclipse, though in the case of Chronicum Scotorum the word is supplied by the editor... We agree with Newton 1972, 593 that at least three possible identifications must be kept in mind. (The Irish sources Scotorum and Ulster contain references to an eclipse in the morning sometime around the year 592. We cannot even be sure whether the records refer to one or to two eclipses. I discussed these records under the designation 592 Mar 19 B,I in Section VII.1. The eclipse of 594 Jul 23 was the greatest eclipse in Ireland near 592, and it came about 1h after sunrise there. However, we cannot exclude 590 Oct 4, 591 Sep 23, and 592 Mar 19 without careful calculation, and the eclipse cannot be identified safely. The magnitude of each of the eclipses depends upon accelerations used, and the values about to be given are the greatest found for some combination specified in Equation XVI.9. We find 0.75 for 590 Oct 4, 0.34 for 591 Sep 23, and 0.63 for 592 Mar 19. It is not too likely that the eclipse of 591 Sep 23 was observed in Ireland, but there is reasonable probability that the others were. Thus we must continue to allow at least three possible dates for the eclipse or eclipses recorded in Scotorum and Ulster.) But it seems nowadays that the great Irish total eclipse of the decade, namely S.594 July 23, is not merely present in Irish annals, but also occurs in some cases with a correct year-indicator. It would lead us too far to consider how the dating of Irish annals relates to non-astronomical events (e.g., the pontificate of Gregory the Great, the mission of St. Augustine, and the death of St. Columba). We accept the records as relating to 594 and suspect that two records (one in Latin) were available, one perhaps from Bangor, N.E. Ireland, and one from Iona in what is now Scotland.” (Schove p.106-107) This solar eclipse really happened on September 16 in CE 787, not in CE 594 July 23. The back calculation of the Solar Saros Series – 105 is not accurate. (JD ~ 2008767.9)

Fredegarius puts this eclipse in the year after Phocas killed Mauricius and assumed the Byzantine throne, which happened in 602. The record says: ‘In that year the sun was eclipsed.’ I have found no earlier record of this eclipse and the eclipse was within less than 40 years of the compilation of the chronicle. Thus there is a good chance that the record is independent and local. Reliability: 0.5. Place: 7th century Burgundy.

Although month and day are not given, this solar eclipse can hardly be other than that of 603 Aug.12, which was total in North-East Spain and large throughout France. The identification goes back at least to Petavius 1627 (854).

Stern in 1878 and pointed out to Ginzel by J. Krall. The eclipse it mentions was identified in Ginzel 1883 (655) as S.601 March 10; the identification has been confirmed by E.B. Allen, J. Am. Oriental Soc., 67 (4), 1947, 267-9, and Newton 1979, 388 where further references will be found.

The inscription reads, in Allen’s translation: ‘On the fourteenth of Phamenoth of the fourth indiction, the sun was eclipsed in the fourth hour of the day and in the year in which Peter, son of Palu, was made village official in Djeme”. As the stone was believed to be of the sixth or seventh century AD., and the Egyptian calendar (with Thoth 1 = Aug. 29) makes Pham.14 =March 10, and the indiction is correct, and moreover Ginzel found S.601 March 10 to reach a maximum magnitude of 0.92 and 9.54 a.m. at Thebes, Ginzel’s identification appears reliable...” This eclipse is clearly mentioned in the Chronography of Elias, metropolitan of Nisibis, who wrote early in the eleventh century... ‘Year 912. The sun was eclipsed on Friday 10 Adar [March], in the middle of the day; the stars appeared, and there was a violent wind’.

“612 Aug 2. Reference: Scotorum. The entry for the year 614 says: ‘A star was seen at the seventh hour of the day.’ The entry says nothing about an eclipse, but it is conceivable that the original had ‘An eclipse of the sun and a star was seen...’, and that the first part of the record was lost in copying. The nearest plausible eclipse to 614 is the eclipse of 612 Aug 2, which would have been large in Ireland around the 7th or 8th hour. However, the pattern of dating errors in this portion of Scotorum suggests that the correct year is 617 rather than 612 or 614. I consider it doubtful that this record refers to an eclipse, and I consider the eclipse to be unidentifiable if it does.” (Newton MCRE, p.191-192) “S. 612 Aug. 2 (Wed.). IRISH ‘GHOST’ (FROM S. SPAIN?) We know of no certain Western record. Schroeter shows totality in Morocco. The magnitude reached about 0.9 at Seville, where Isidore was flourishing, but he does not seem to record it. There are, however, possible Irish references. Various Irish annals mention a star seen at the seventh (or eighth) hour of the day. E.g. 7th hour in CS (s.a. 617), AC (s.a.617), and AT (under implied 613?); 8th hour in AU (s.a. 613, probably true 614), and similarly in J. O’Donovan’s Introduction to the Annals of the Four Masters (1, 1851, xlviii), where ‘comata’ is editorially supplied to ‘stella’, indicating a comet. No comet is recorded in China. One may estimate from Schroeter a magnitude of about 0.77 in midafternoon in Central Ireland, for which O’Connor calculates 0.77 about 3.04 p.m. Newton 1972 (191) notes the reasonably fitting hour, but considers doubtful that record refers to an eclipse, and considers the eclipse to be unidentifiable if it does. It should be noted, however, that eclipse identifications S.615 Jan.5, S.615 June 2, S.616 May 21 and S.617 Nov 4 may be eliminated, as all were distinctly morning eclipses in Ireland, if they were visible there (S.616 looks doubtful from Oppolzer). Because of the extreme vagueness of the record, we have not thought it worth while to give fuller references to the Irish Annals, which might have derived the information from Spain.” (Schove p. 114-5) This solar eclipse really happened on February 11 in CE 807.

“617 Nov 4. Reference: Georgios Hamartolos. ‘There happened moreover a severe famine and great mortality; the sun also was darkened and ashes rained.’ This is during the reign of Heraclius (emperor 610-641). It occurs in the early part of the text that deals with his reign, but it is not safe to infer the date from this. There were eclipses on
126



616 May 21, 617 Nov4, and 634 Jun1 during Heraclius’ reign. 617 Nov 4 probably had the largest magnitude in Constantinople, according to the charts in Oppolzer [1887], but it is not legitimate to infer the date from this. I have found no other reference to a famine nor to a rain of ashes near this time. There is no way to date this record and I shall not attempt to use it.” (Newton 1972, MCRE p. 543) “S. 617 Nov. 4, E. MEDITERRANEAN A solar eclipse in the earlier part of the reign of Heraclius is mentioned by the ninthcentury writer George the Monk (‘Hamartolos’): ‘There was hard famine and great mortality, and the Sun was darkened, and it rained ashes.’ The entry occurs in a historical context differently dated by various authorities, but not, as far as we can see, outside the range AD 615-9. We do not know George’s authority for the eclipsed record, which is not mentioned by Theophanes. The same source evidently used Michael the Syrian, who misdated it as follows: ’In the year in which Heraclius commenced to reign over Romans (i.e. 610/611) there was an eclipse of the Sun during four hours.’ Both writers mention famine and this must relate to the large solar eclipse of 617 (See Proudfoot 1975, 390). Meeus (personal communication 1982 Aug 23) calculates that 92% of the sun’s diameter was eclipsed at Constantinople, sufficient to explain the phrase ‘the sun was darkened.’ The annular eclipse of 617 Nov 4 was very large at Constantinople. The track of annularity in Schroeter runs from North-West to South-East from Amsterdam via Vienna, Bucharest, just north of Constantinople, and North-East Asia Minor, to around Babylon. This makes the maximum magnitude at Constantinople about 0.98 around 9.15 a.m. Newton 1972 (530, 543) says ‘617 Nov.4?. Valid observation; cannot date ‘, and mentions also S.616 May 21 and S.634 June 1 as other Byzantine eclipses during the reign of Heraclius. Perhaps, as Newton suggests, the rain of ashes may have been due to a volcanic eruption. This may have darkened the Sun; consequently the record cannot be treated as referring indubitably to a solar eclipse. This eclipse is clearly mentioned by, ostensibly, Stephanus of Alexandria, who worked at Constantinople under the emperor Heraclius. The year of composition, indicated in several places in the work itself, is equivalent to the Byzantine year AD 618-9 (indication 7). The examples all relate to AD 617 and 618, and include syzygy calculations associated with S.617 Nov.4 and M.618 Oct.9. We owe the reference to Neugebauer 1975 (2, 104551), where much detail may be found. Information about S.617 Nov.4 occurs in Usener (pp.293-4, 329). ‘November fourth’ is spelled out, the Egyptian month Athyr is correctly given, and also is indication 6 (AD 617-8). Any reader who wishes to distinguish text, fragmentary extracts and scholia from one another is referred to Usener and Neugebauer. The identification S.617 Nov.4 is secure, but according to Neugebauer (2, 1049) the solar and lunar eclipse computations (as distinct from mere syzygy computations) are unpublished.” (Schove p. 115-6) This solar eclipse really happened on May 14 in CE 812, not in CE 617 November 4.

Totality appears to be mentioned in the text, October (and Phaophi) and seventh indiction (AD 618-9) in a scholium. Thus at the very least there is written tradition of a total lunar eclipse on 618 Oct.9. This is not surprising, since the eclipse was a deep total one (Oppolzer magnitude 1.72), with mid-eclipse about 18h UT, or say 8 p.m. in the Eastern Mediterranean, an evening time very favourable for observation.” (Schove p. 116) This lunar eclipse really happened on October 3 in CE 814, not in CE 618 October 9.

“624 Jun 21. Reference: Cambriae. The notice: ‘The sun was obscured’ (or ‘darkened’) occurs under the year 180, which is presumably 624. I saw no event within 20 years of this that could be dated independently, so there is no way to check the accuracy of the chronology. It is unlikely that the magnitude of the eclipse of 624 Jun 21 exceeded about 0.5 or 0.6 in Wales. The large eclipses nearest in time are those of 619 Mar 21 and 634 Jun1. The penumbral eclipse of 625 Jun10 cannot be ruled out, at least not without detailed computation. This eclipse seems to be unidentifiable.” (Newton 1972, MCRE p. 209210)
“S.624 June 21. ANOTHER IRISH ‘GHOST’ The annular eclipse of 624 June 21 and the penumbral eclipse of 625 June 10 have both been invoked to explain Irish and ‘Welsh’ references to an eclipse in 624 or 625. O’Connor gives magnitudes in mid-Ireland only 47% and 25% respectively, and we do not consider that either eclipse was noticed there. The 624 eclipse may have been considerable (perhaps more than 80%) in Seville, and consequently noticeable there, but it is not mentioned even in Isidore. The reference in the original ‘Chronicle of Ireland’, assembled perhaps at a Bangor or Iona in the later seventh century, was presumably what we now find in the Annals of Ulster, namely ‘annus teneborus’ (very dark year), under AU year 624 presumed as usual to have referred to AD 625 (which must be the case if the statement at the beginning of the annal, that the first day of January was a Tuesday, is true). In the AI, (pp.86-7) an eclipse is specified, but this seems to be the rationalization of a later copyist. ‘The Annals of the Britons’ omit the darkness and state badly that in 624 ‘the sun eclipsed’. This is the so called eclipse of Edwin, but the eclipses of 624 and 625 were not likely to have been noticed anywhere in Ireland or Britain; we therefore consider that the darkness of the year does not refer to an eclipse, unless (as we suspect for 612) the information came originally from Spain. The darkening of the sun in the 620’s is mentioned under c.626-8, and possibly there were volcanic eruptions in this decade which weakened the effective solar heat and light.” (Schove p. 119) This solar eclipse really happened on July 7 in CE 818, not in CE 624 June 21.

“S. 829 Nov. 30 PARTIAL SOLAR IN BAGDAD This eclipse is the first of some thirty Islamic eclipses between AD 829 and AD 1004 which were observed by astronomers (as distinct from mentioned by historians) and constitute an important part of our medieval eclipse information. There are 29 Arabian eclipses, observed in Bagdad or Cairo, to be found mentioned in Newcomb 1878 or Newton 1970 or (in 24 cases) both, taken from Caussin 1804 (a French translation, Le Livre de la grande Table Hakemite, of a work by Ibn Yunus, who died about 1008-9). Caussin 1799 had previously abstracted information about 28 of these eclipses. The records are excellent in general, but weak in a few instances. Newton 1970 (but not Newcomb 1878) also used information about four eclipses between AD 883 and AD 901 reported by Al- Battani (Albategnius) from Syria ( in two cases, Antioch as well as ar-Raqqa), which have been known to European astronomers for many centuries. We shall normally mention only a few salient points about each eclipse, referring the reader to Caussin, Newcomb and Newton for full numerical details. In the case of S.829 Nov.30, the central line of annularity in Oppolz. starts at sunrise in Egypt, and proceeds via approximately Aden to a noon point in the Indian Ocean. At Bagdad the eclipse was only partial; the astronomical report mentions the beginning (though Newcomb doubts whether it was observed) and the end, the latter at about three seasonal hours after sunrise (half-time between sunrise and local apparent noon).” (Schove p.184) “AD 829 Nov 30 [Saros 94]

Ahmad b. ‘Abd Allah known as Habash said: ’There was a lunar eclipse... in the year 198 of Yazdijerd... As of the solar eclipse, which (occurred) in this year at the end of the month of Ramadan, all calculations were in error. The altitude of the Sun at the beginning of the eclipse was 7deg as they (the astronomers) claim. The eclipse ended when the altitude of the Sun was about 24 deg, as though it was 3 hours of day (after sunrise)’. Here we have a combination of a Persian year and a Muslim month. The year 198 of Yazdijerd (= 214/215 AH) covered the period from AD 829 Apr 28 to 830 Apr 27. A date at the very end of Ramadan in that year closely corresponds (within a day or so) to AD 829 Nov 30 – the calculated day of a solar eclipse visible in Baghdad. No observational details are recorded for the lunar eclipse; for the present purpose, the allusion to this event merely serves to establish the year. The remark that the astronomers claimed that the altitude of the Sun at first contact was 7 deg suggests that the measurement was regarded as only approximate.” (Stephenson; HISTORICAL ECLIPSES AND EARTH’S ROTATION, p. 470)

Consequently the eclipse was not visible in the Near East, the eclipse being, for that region, a purely calculated one. According to Camb.Med.Hist. 2, 1926, 354, Umar was killed on 644 Nov.3.

Eccl. of 731 and reasonably clearly in both his small De Temporibus of 703 and his larger De Temporum Ratione of 725. ... Between them they attribute to Bede ‘tomo secundo’ two solar eclipses, S.650 Feb. 6 and S. 661 July 2, which did occur but appear not to be genuinely mentioned by Bede. As both false identifications were copied in Tycho-Curtius 1666...” (Schove p. 125) This solar eclipse really happened on May 5 in CE 840 Delta T = zero sec! (JD ~ 2027993.035)

“S.849 May 25 LARGE SOLAR ECLIPSE IN SCOTLAND NOT RECORDED” (Schove, p. 191) “S.655 April 12. PROBABLY RECORDED IN SPAIN Among continuations of Isidore’s History of the Goths, Vandals and Sueves is a Continuatio of about AD 754, edited by Mommsen. On page 343 are two eclipse references. The first (34) is in the reign of the Byzantine emperor Constans II (641-688): ‘huius imperio sole medio die obscurato celum stellas prodit’.” (Schove, p. 125) “655 Apr 12. Reference: Isidorus. It should be pointed out again that the solar eclipses are actually in a continuation of the history and not in the part written by Isidorus himself. At one point the continuation says: ‘In this reign, the sun being obscured in the middle of the day, stars came out in the sky.’ The reign is that of the Byzantine emperor Constans II, emperor 641-668. There are only three possibilities for a reasonably large eclipse during this time, unless the errors in Oppolzer [1887] are larger than we expect. The eclipses of 644 Nov 5 and 646 Apr 21 are possible, but only if the observation was made in the eastern empire. There are two Byzantine records of the eclipse of 644 Nov 5; neither makes it a large eclipse, but that might be a simple failure to record the indications of one. I have found no Byzantine record of the eclipse of 646 Apr 21. The eclipse of 655 Apr 12 is the only other possible eclipse during the reign of Constans II, and it is the only possibility for an observation in Spain.

A few lines farther on we find the following: ‘In his times an eclipse of the sun, such that stars appeared in the middle of the day, terrified all Spain and foreshadowed a Gascon invasion with a not-small army.’ ‘His’ could still refer to Constans II, but I do not believe that one can safely infer this from the text alone. However, the text definitely puts this eclipse a few years after 647 (685 of the Spanish Era), and the only reasonable possibility is the eclipse of 655 Apr 12. The words used in the two references to an eclipse are quite different but the basic facts are the same. Thus it seems likely that the writer has copied two records of the same eclipse without realizing that fact, although we cannot conclude with surety that the first record refers to 655 Apr 12. I shall assume that we have a record of 655 Apr 12. Because of the likelihood that the record is copied, I shall lower the reliability to 0.5. The writer says ‘all Spain’ and it is safer to use all Spain as the place than to use Seville. Standard deviation of the magnitude: 0.01.” (Newton, p. 510-11) This solar eclipse really happened on May 25 in CE 849, not in CE 655 April 12. (JD ~ 2031300.33)

The record says that the ‘uneclipsed part of the disc exceeded one-tenth.” (Newton, AAO p. 148) “AD 854 Feb 16/17 [Saros 95] This lunar eclipse was mentioned by al-Mahani. ‘There was an eclipse of the Moon in the month of Ramadan in the year 239 of al-Hijrah on the night of Saturday, the middle of the month. It was found by observation that the beginning of this eclipse was at 10 hours and something like half of one-tenth of an hour after midday of Friday. We did not determine its times apart from the beginning. It was found that the uneclipsed part of its body was more than 1/10... (calculated details)...’. The fact that only the time of first contact is reported is surprising; as an evening eclipse, the entire course of events should have been visible unless unfavourable weather intervened. Although the text does not specify whether equal or unequal hours were used, since part of the measured interval of 10;03 hours after midday was in daylight and part in darkness, only equal hours would be meaningful.

The second (36) is in the reign of Reccaswinth, Visigothic king of Spain (sole ruler c. 653-672), and is mentioned immediately after a Council of Toledo usually assigned, as by Mommsen, to 653: ‘Huius temporibus eclipsim solis stellis meridie visentibus omnis Spania territat atque incursationem Vasconum non cum modico exercitus damno prospectat’. Ginzel 1886 (972-4) had already discussed a passage from Roderic of Toledo (died 1248) which is clearly related to the second (36) passage above. Probably correctly, he had ruled out, as insufficiently striking in Spain, the eclipses S.659 Jan.28 and S. 671 Dec.7 (qq.v.). He considered more seriously the two eclipses S.655 April 12 and S.666 Sept.4 (called Nov.4 by oversight). Both were total over much of Spain and large over all Spain, the former more than 4 hours before noon and the latter about 3 hours after noon, so that the reference to ‘the middle of the day’ is apparently to be understood broadly. Ginzel preferred S.666, for reasons which seem weak even in relation to the limited passage from Roderic which he quoted. In relation to the passages from the Continuatio Hispana, and the mention of the 653 Council of Toledo, fresh consideration is needed. It will be noted that both eclipses, S.655 and S.666, fall within both the reigns mentioned; also that it is not clear wheather the two passages (34 and 36) relate to the same eclipse or to two different eclipses. If the eclipse of 34 is derived from some Byzantine
138



source, and ‘medio die’ may be discounted, it could in fact refer to S.644 Nov.5 (q.v). But the eclipse of 36 seems definitely Spanish, and is probably either S.655 or S.666. Newton 1972 (507, 510-1) discusses both passages under S.655 April 12. We adopt the same course, as perhaps the best that can be done with these weak records.” (Schove, p. 125-6) “664 May 1. Reference: Bede. The translation mentioned in the citation reads: ‘In the same year of our Lord’s incarnation, 664, there happened an eclipse of the sun, on the third of May, about ten o’clock in the morning.’...This is the last of three solar eclipse reports by Bede.... The mistake of the two days in the date does not interfere with the identification. The reliability is unity. The standard deviation of magnitude will be taken as 0.06. The place needs discussion.” (Newton, AAO p.49-50) This solar eclipse really happened on January 11 in CE 856, not in CE 664 May 1, and not in CE 666 Sep 4. (JD ~ 2033722.15)

The observer of this eclipse and the observer of the eclipse of 854 Feb 16 were the same. It was tentatively concluded that the magnitude of the latter eclipse was originally referred to the diameter before editing. For this reason I will assume that this measurement is of the diameter. Luckily, for a lunar eclipse near 8 digits, it makes almost no difference whether the magnitude refers to the area or the diameter (Figure V.2).” (Newton, AAO p. 148) “AD 856 Jun 21/22: Baghdad [Saros 82] (This is) the third lunar eclipse mentioned by al-Mahani. ‘There was an eclipse of the Moon on the night of Monday the middle of (the month of) Safar in the year 242 of alHijrah...(date on the Persian Calendar)...

of the eclipse was when the altitude of (the star) al-dabaran was 9;30 deg in the east; the amount of the revolution of the (celestial) sphere from midnight to this time, as we determined (from this measurement) with the astrolabe was 50 deg. We did not determine its times except for the beginning. It was found (by observation) that the uneclipsed part of its body (i.e. disk) was more than one quarter and less than one third...

Elsewhere in the above text, it is stated that times are expressed in seasonal hours. No altitude measurements are preserved, only the reduced times. Zawal means the moment when the shadows of a gnomon begins to noticeably increase after the Sun transits the meridian and is thus a few minutes after noon.

The preceding report for 866 Jun 16 gave details of calculations relating to the eclipse first followed by details of the observations and notes about the discrepancies. This report says that the ‘opposition should have been’ at 9h 31m and so on. The part of the text giving the numbers in Table V. 4 is followed by remarks that make no sense to me and that give no additional numbers. The presumption is that the numbers listed in Table V. 4 are the calculated ones and that the observed values have been omitted in the available text by some accident. Newcomb did not use either eclipse of 866, apparently because of suspicion about which values were observed and which were calculated.” (Newton, AAO p. 149)

Here the continuation says: ‘At the same time, at the beginning of era 758, the 100th year of the Arabs, the sun is recognized by many to be eclipsed from the 7th hour of the day to the 9th, with stars being seen.’ This is also put in the reign of Anastasius II. The chronology is highly confused. Anastasius came to the Byzantine throne in 713 and was deposed in 716, although he was not killed until 721. The year 758 of the Spanish Era is our 720, so the ‘beginning’ is near 720 Jan 1; the Spanish year began on Jan 1. Possibly the writer was still counting Anastasius as the legitimate ruler. If we assume that the time is around 720, the only plausible eclipses are those of 718 Jun 3 and 720 Oct 6. The latter eclipse is possible only if the errors in Oppolzer are rather large. His chart shows that the path missed Spain entirely and that the eclipse would probably have been seen later in the day than record says. Further, it does not seem reasonable to describe either eclipse as being near the beginning of the year. The reference to the year of the Arabs furnishes a resolution of the problem. If the writer thought that 758 of the Spanish era and the ‘100th year of the Arabs’ were equivalent, we can read this as saying that the eclipse was near the beginning of the 100th year of the Hegira. The epoch of the era of the Hegira is taken as either 622 Jul 15 or 622 Jul 16, depending upon the chronologist. The Moslem year is a lunar calendar with 12 lunar months always; no attempt is made to keep it approximately adjusted to the solar year. The rules governing the lengths of the months make the year equal to 354 11/30 days exactly. An elementary calculation that should be accurate within a few days puts the beginning of the year 100 near 718 Aug2. If the writer did not know that the Moslem year was lunar, he would have thought that their year 100 was equal to our year 721 or, rather, its equivalent 759 of the Spanish era; an accident could have put him 1 year in error in his attempted conversion. Thus the eclipse of 718 Jun 3, which should have been large or total in Spain in the first part of the afternoon, fits the conditions of the record as well as we can reconstruct them. No other eclipse fits the conditions well, unless Oppolzer’s approximations happened to cause appreciable error. I shall calculate the circumstances for 720 Oct 6 as a test. If its path crosses any part of Spain, I shall ignore this record. If it does not, I shall take the record as applying to 718 Jun 3, with a reliability of 0.5 Place: Seville. Standard deviation of the magnitude: 0.01.” (Newton, 1972 p. 512-513)

“We had a similar problem in connection with the record 718 Jun 3 E, in Chapter XIV. Isidorus [ca. 624] said that there was an eclipse from the 7th to the 9th hour of the day, and that stars could be seen, in a year that is near 720. In Oppolzer, the only eclipse path that crossed any part of Spain near this time was on 718 Jun 3, although the path of the eclipse of 720 Oct 6 came fairly close to the southern tip. Thus, the identification of the eclipse was made contingent upon careful calculation of the circumstances of 720 Oct 6. For three of the four combinations of accelerations used, the path of totality of the eclipse of 720 Oct 6 crossed some part of Spain. The hour of maximum eclipse was slightly outside the hours stated Isidorus, but not enough so to let us exclude the alternate date. Thus we cannot identify the eclipse in Isidorus. These are the only records in the preceding chapters that I accepted on a contingent basis. In three other cases, I decided to calculate the circumstances even though the records clearly do not contain enough information to permit their use. The purpose of the calculations was to see if we could reach any further conclusions, with the understanding that the records would not be used even if we did.” (Newton, p. 592-593) “S. 718 June 3 TOTAL SOLAR IN SPAIN S. 718 June 3 probable (S.720 Oct. 6 less probable) Isidore Pacenses, in his Continuatio Hispana (about 754) of the Gothic, etc. history by the more famous Isidorus Hispalensis (Isidore of Seville, died 636), has a passage given with slight variations by various editors and commentators. The gist of the passage is that as Spanish Era SpE 757 (or 758) was beginning, in the 100th year of the Arabs, an eclipse of the Sun occurred in Spain, from the 7th (or 6th) to the 9th hour of the day; some place this eclipse in the time of Hurr, but most in the time of his successor Samh. SpE 757 and 758 are AD 719 and 720. The years of the Hijra, AH 99 to 102, began about 717 Aug.14, 718 Aug.3, 719 July 24 and 720 July 12 respectively. Although all the year numbers are a unit or so too large, one must nevertheless agree with the result of the discussion in Ginzel 1886 (974-6): the great Spanish total eclipse of 718 June 3 (Schroeter’s band of totality passes north of Lisbon, south of Madrid, and then to Northern Tunisia) fits better than S.720 Oct.6 (total in North Africa) as regards both totality and hour in Spain. If only one eclipse is involved, S.718 must have the preference. But it is not impossible that the account may have been influenced by both eclipses, e.g., the indication of year may be a compromise by a writer faced with apparently conflicting records and unaware that two different eclipses occurred in the years round 719. The historical chronology about this time seems a little uncertain, but it is probable that 718 June 3 fell in the time of Hurr and 720 Oct. 6 in the time of Samh. If this is true, and one is informed of a division of opinion as to whether ‘this’ eclipse occurred in the time of Hurr or in the time of Samh, one may legitimately suspect conflation.” (Schove. p. 147-8) This solar eclipse really happened on June 17 in CE 912.

The year of CE 923, AH 110/111, YZ 291/292, Seljuk AH 310/311 (Traditional AD = CE 729/733)
“M. 923 June 1 PARTIAL IN BAGHDAD This is one of the Ibn Yunus eclipses. The middle and end were observed at Bagdad by several astronomers in collaboration. It is reported that at mid-eclipse (greatest obscuration) the Sun was 8° high and the magnitude was 9 digits (i.e. 0.75); also that at the end the Sun was 20° high and the time was 2 1/5 seasonal hours after sunrise.” (Schove, p. 221-222) “AD 923 June 1/2: Baghdad [Saros 103] This lunar eclipse was calculated by Ali ibn Amajur al-Turki from the al-Zij al-‘Arabi of Habash and observed by him and his son Abu al-Hasan and his freedman Muflih. (He said:) ‘There was an eclipse of the Moon in (the month of) Safar in the year 311 of alHijrah... (calculated details)... The Moon rose at sunset (already) eclipsed by 1⁄4 or a (a little) more of the digits of the diameter (i.e. 3 digits or a little more). The Moon was eclipsed by (a little) more than 9 didgits of diameter. The middle of the eclipse was at 1 and 2/3 of equal hours of night (i.e. after sunset). The clearance of the eclipse was at 3 equal hours (after sunset) and (that was) when the altitude of (the star) al-ridf was 29;30 deg in the east... (calculated details)... The alternative Arabic name for al-ridf is Dhanab, from which the modern name Deneb is derived. RESULTS...Delta T = 2000 sec.” (Stephenson, p. 47980)
It is quite interesting that up to now never entered somebody’s mind such idea that the retro calculation of the 103 Lunar Saros Series perhaps is not perfect.
So, the back calculation of the Lunar Saros Series - 103 is not accurate. Delta T ~ Zero sec! This lunar eclipse really happened on June 1 in CE 923. (JD ~ 2058335)
151



“AD 923 Nov 11: Baghdad [Saros 96] This solar eclipse was calculated and observed by Abu al-Hasan Ali ibn Amajur, who used the al-Zij al-Arabi of Habash. ‘This eclipse was at the conjunction (i.e. new Moon) of (the month of) Sha’ban in the year 311 (AH). We as a group observed (this eclipse) and clearly distinguished it. The estimate of all (observers) for the middle of the eclipse was that it occurred when the altitude of the Sun was 8 deg in the east; its clearance was at 2 1/5 seasonal hours (after sunrise), when the altitude of the Sun was 20 deg. We observed this eclipse at several sites on the Tarmah (an elevated platform on the outside of the building). The estimate of Abu al-Hasan for the middle of the eclipse at his house was when the altitude of the Sun was 8 deg, as I estimated myself at my house before he arrived. The magnitude of the eclipse was 1⁄2 and 1⁄4 (i.e. 3⁄4) of the Sun’s diameter; the middle of the eclipse, which we estimated when the Sun’s altitude was 8 deg, would be when the elapsed time (after sunrise) was 0;50 seasonal hours, and the (celestial) sphere had revolved (through) 10;40 deg. (The interval) between the middle of the eclipse and its clearance in this observation was 1;22 seasonal hours... (alternative times in equal hours)...’. The statement that the eclipse ‘was at the conjunction of (the month of) Sha’ban’ implies that it occurred at the new Moon of Sha’ban – i.e. the very end of the previous lunar month Rajab. RESULTS...Delta T = 1600 sec.” (Stephenson p. 471-2) “S. 733 Aug 14 TOTAL SOLAR IN ... CAUCASUS “A fragmentary primary source of the 730s has been incorporated into the ‘History of the Caucasian Albanians’ by Movses Dasxuranci (tr. C.J.F. Dowsett, 1961, Oxford University Press). This refers to Cattle Plague, Taxes and Famine in the 720s and is followed by what seems to be description of a total eclipse at a specific place: ‘the borders of Mozu, in the bishopric of Siwnik’. A hermit saw a vision (possibly auroral in origin) and ‘announcing the coming of the wrath (of the Lord) throughout the canton, he besought all to pray, and an impenetrable darkness descended over the borders of Mozu, and the earth shook for forty days, and nigh on 10,000 souls were swallowed up; and because of this (the place) was called Vayoc Jor (Valley of Woe)’.” (Schove, p. 151)
It is quite interesting that up to now never entered somebody’s mind such idea that the retro calculation of the 96 Solar Saros Series perhaps is not perfect. So, the back calculation of the Solar Saros Series - 96 is not accurate. This solar eclipse really happened on November 11 in CE 923 not in CE 733 Augustus 14. Delta T ~ Zero sec! (JD ~ 2058497.8)

The year of CE 924 (Traditional AD = CE 733)
“733 Aug 14 a. Reference: Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. Most texts read something like: ‘In this year Aethelbald occupied Somerton, and there was an eclipse of the sun.’ I discussed this record in Section IV.1 of AAO under the designation 733 Aug 14 B. In AAO, I put the observation in Canterbury for reasons that will be discussed under the next record. On the basis of additional study, I realize that the earlier conclusions are not justified. I shall take the place of this observation to be England. Reliability: 0.5. Standard deviation of the magnitude: 0.1” (Newton, 1972, p. 151-152) 733 Aug 14 b. Reference: Bede. (This is in the ‘Continuation’.) ‘Year 733, there was an eclipse of the sun on the 19th calends September (= Aug 14) about the 3rd hour of the day, such that almost the entire disk of the sun appeared to be covered by a horrible black shield.” (Newton, 1972, p. 152) “S. 733 Aug 14 TOTAL SOLAR IN CENTRAL ENGLAND AND CAUCASUS There is one contemporary account, namely that in the construction of Bede‘s Ecclesiastical History (1969, 572-3): ‘In 733 an eclipse of the Sun occurred on xviiii (variant, xviii) Kal. Sept. about the third hour of the day so that its whole orb seemed to be covered by a black and terrifying shield’. The dates are Aug.14 (variant, 15), the former being correct, and sometimes degenerating into Aug.19 in later-writers. The most correct of the early copyists from the continuation of Bede (or from another set of Northumbrian annals) date from Norman times; they are Simeon of Durham and Roger of Hoveden; the hour is also correctly inserted in the latin version of MS.F of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which otherwise gives year only. Newton 1972 (143-7) lists the English sources up to Roger of Hoveden. The hour, when given, is always ‘about the third’.” (Schove, p. 150) This solar eclipse really happened on May 6 in CE 924, not in CE 733 Augustus 14. (JD ~ 205867522)
153



The year of CE 925
“M. 925 Apr. 11 TOTAL IN BAGDAD A total eclipse, maximum magnitude about 1.09. This is one of the Ibn Yunus eclipses; the beginning and end were observed at Bagdad in the early evening, see Caussin 1799, 7; 1804, 116, Newcomb 1878, Newton 1970. A wildly erroneous stellar altitude at the beginning has to be discarded, see Newcomb, 46, Newton, 150, but enough sound information remains to provide good observed times of both beginning and end of the eclipse.” (Schove, p. 222) “925 Apr 11. A star elevation and its conversion into time were both here. There is good agreement for the end phase. According to Newcomb the elevation given for Arcturus yields a time almost an hour before sunset and quite different from the hour given. The hour given is reasonable, so the presumption is that star identity was recorded wrong.” (Newton, AAO p. 150) “AD 925 Apr 11/12: Baghdad [Saros 85] This lunar eclipse was calculated and observed by Abu al-Hasan ibn Amajur. This eclipse was on the night of Tuesday, the 15th of (the month of) Muharram, year 313 of al Hijrah. He mentioned that the Moon was totally eclipsed and reported its five times (as found by calculation but not given in the text). Then he said: ‘I observed this eclipse. The beginning was when altitude of (the star) (al-simak) al-ramih was 11deg in the east. The end of clearance was when the altitude of (the star) al-nasr al-waqi’ was 24 deg’. He then said: ‘The beginning of the eclipse would be when the time elapsed from the start of night (i.e. from sunset) was 0;55 seasonal hours; the observation was later by 0;23 seasonal hours than that calculated from the al-Zij al-Mumtahan of Habash. The end of clearance by observation would be at 4;36 seasonal hours; observation was (again) later than calculation by 0;17 seasonal hours’. There must be an error in the preserved altitude of alpha Boo at first contact. This star would be 11 deg above the eastern horizon at about 55 minutes before sunset rather than after it but the text clearly implies an observation. Presumably a scribe made an error in reporting the elevation of the star, but there is no obvious alternative reading here. The reported time of 55 minutes after sunset will be adopted instead. When Ibn Amajur compared this time with the result based on the tables of Habash, it showed much the same discrepancy as for the reported time of last contact. It is not stated whether the azimuth of alpha Lyr was east or west of the meridian at last contact. However, it is clear from the reported time of 4 h 36 m after sunset (LT = 22.72 h) that the star was to the east of the meridian; an elevation of 24 deg would correspond to a rather similar LT of 22.77 h. RESULTS ...Delta T = 2400 sec.” (Stephenson, p. 480)
It is quite interesting that up to now never entered somebody’s mind such idea that the retro calculation of the 85 Lunar Saros Series perhaps is not perfect. So, the back calculation of the Lunar Saros Series - 85 is not accurate. This lunar eclipse really happened on April 11 in CE 925. Delta T ~ Zero sec! (JD ~ 2059015)

The year of CE 927
“M. 927 Sept. 13-14 SMALL BUT OBSERVED IN BAGDAD A small partial eclipse, observed during the later part of ‘Friday night’ at Bagdad, according to the Ibn Yunus list. Maximum magnitude about 0.3 was observed, compared with calculated 0.21 (Oppolzer), 0.22 (Newton). Times of beginning, middle and end were given in Caussin 1804, but only that of the beginning was confirmed by a stellar altitude. Newcomb attributes the slight earliness to the keen eye of the young observer (‘mon fils Aboulhassan’) detecting the penumbra before the arrival of the umbra.” (Schove, p. 223) “927 Sep 14. The magnitude is described as greater than 1⁄4 of the diameter and less than 1/3: this is entered in the table as 3 1⁄2 digits. Similar phraseology was used in almost all cases where the tabular magnitude in Table V.4 is reported to half a digit.” (Newton, AAO p.150) “AD 927 Sep 13/14: Baghdad [Saros 110] This lunar eclipse was calculated and observed by Ali ibn Amajur, who used the al-Zij al-‘Arabi of Habash. This eclipse was on the night of Friday, in the year 315 of al- Hijrah.. (calculated details)...’ He said: ‘This eclipse was observed by my son Abu al-Hasan. The beginning of the eclipse was when the altitude of (the star) al-shi’ra al-yamaniyyah was 31 deg in the east; the part of the celestial sphere which has revolved between sunset and the beginning of the eclipse is 148 deg plus a third of a degree and this is (equivalent to) 9;52 equal hours, which is 10;0 seasonal hours. The estimated digits of the eclipse was more than 1⁄4 but less than 1/3, as though it was 3.5 digits...(calculated details...)’. Although the month (and day of the month) is not cited, no other lunar eclipse apart from that identified above occurred in 315 AH (AD 927 Mar – 928 Feb). Confirmation of the calculated date is provided by the recorded weekday (Friday). In addition, the estimate of magnitude is in tolerable accord with calculation for this eclipse. RESULTS ....Delta T = 2950 sec.“ (Stephenson, p. 481)
It is quite interesting that up to now never entered somebody’s mind such idea that the retro calculation of the 110 Lunar Saros Series perhaps is not perfect.

The year of CE 928
“S. 928 Aug.18 SMALL SOLAR OBSERVED IN BAGDAD An annular eclipse, whose path starts at sunrise in East Africa and has noon point near Indonesia. According to the Ibn Yunus account, at Bagdad the Sun rose with a little less than a quarter of its surface eclipsed, and its altitude at the end of the eclipse was 11°53’20”. The Sun was observed distinctly b reflection from a water surface.” (Schove, p. 223) “928 Aug 18. The times in the original record were given to a precision of seconds or even of ‘thirds’: hence they were probably calculations from tables made to compare with the observed circumstances. The height of the sun at the end of the eclipse seems to record a genuine observation. The record says that the eclipse was followed by watching it in a reflecting pool.” (Newton, AAO p.150) “AD 928 Aug 18: Baghdad [Saros 108] This solar eclipse was calculated and observed by Ali ibn Amajur. (According to calculation), the beginning was to be at... (calculated details)... on Monday. He said: ‘I observed this eclipse with my son Abu al- Hasan and Muflih and (found) that the Sun rose (already) eclipsed by less than one 1⁄4 of its surface. The eclipse continued to increase by an amount that we could perceive until 1⁄4 (of its surface) was eclipsed. We observed the Sun distinctly (by reflection) in water. We (found) that it cleared and nothing of the eclipse remained and we distinguished the (full) circle of the Sun1s body in water; (that was) when the altitude was 12 deg in the east, less 1/3 of a division of the al-halaqa (i.e. the ring), which is graduated in thirds (of a degree), that is (less by) 1/9 degree.... (comparison with calculation)...’. Although the full date is not stated, it can fairly readily be established. The observation is cited between the records of two lunar eclipses: those of AD 927 Sep 13/14 and 929 Jan 27/28 (entries 6 and 7 of section 13.8 below). Only one solar obscuration would be visible at Baghdad during this interval- that of AD 928 Aug 18, which indeed occurred on a Monday. Hence the date is firmly established. RESULTS... Delta T = 1800 sec” (Stephenson, p. 472)
It is quite interesting that up to now never entered somebody’s mind such idea that the retro calculation of the 108 Solar Saros Series perhaps is not perfect.

The year of CE 929
“M. 929 Jan.27-28 TOTAL IN BAGDAD A total lunar eclipse, magnitude 1.20 (Oppolz., Schroe.). The beginning was observed at Bagdad, but the time as it has reached us via Ibn Yunus and Caussin is defective. The time of the beginning is given in two ways... Unfortunately, the other way in which the time is specified supports the ‘wrong’ time. The beginning is said to have been observed about ‘5 unequal hours after sunset’. Newton 1970, 232 rightly finds agreement ‘almost to the minute’ with ‘altitude of Arcturus 18°’. Our rough calculations give about UT 20h 9m. Thus unless the observed time of the beginning was at some stage wrongly given in one mode of statement and then correctly converted to the other mode (see Newton 1970, 232), the Bagdad time has to be discarded for astronomical purposes, as it was by Newcomb and Newton. But the identification of the eclipse seems certain.” (Schove. p. 223-4) “AD 929 Jan 27/28: Baghdad [Saros 87] This lunar eclipse was calculated and observed by Abu al-Hasan Ali ibn Amajur. This eclipse was at the opposition (i.e. full Moon) of (the month of) Dhu al-Hijjah, year 316 of al Hijrah... (calculated details)... He said: ‘I observed this eclipse at its beginning when the altitude of (the star) (al-simak) al-ramih was 18 deg in the east; the time elapsed from the start of the night (i.e after sunset) (to the beginning) was 5 hours seasonal, as required by calculation from the (al-Zij) al-Mumtahan’. RESULTS.... Delta T= 6000 sec Although the LT derived from the altitude measurement is in fair accord with the stated time of 5 unequal hours after sunset (equivalent to a LT of 22.88 h), and was said to confirm calculation from tables, the resulting Delta T value is very discordant compared with roughly contemporaneous results. Hence the observation will be rejected.” (Stephenson, p. 481)
It is quite interesting that up to now never entered somebody’s mind such idea that the retro calculation of the 87 Lunar Saros Series perhaps is not perfect.

He said: ‘(According to calculation) from the al-Zij al-Mumtahan al-‘Arabi of Habash, the eclipse opposition was on the night of Tuesday the 13th of (the month of) Dhu al-Qa’dah, year 321 of al-Hijrah... (calculated details)...’ He said ‘I observed this eclipse when (the Moon) entered (the shadow) and (that was) when altitude of (the star) (al-simak) alramih was 15 deg in the east and when the time elapsed from the start of the night was 9;56 seasonal hours...

The year of AD = CE 939...
“AD 939 Jul 19: Olmos/Cueva del la Mora (Spain) (327 AH.)The Caliph al-Nasir li Din Allah advanced (northwards from Cordoba) heading for his holy battle (jihad) until he reached Toledo on Thursday, when seven nights (sic) remained to the completion of (the month of) Ramadan. He stayed there for six days and left on Thursday, when two nights remained to the completion of Ramadan, for Welmish fortress and on Friday to Khalifah Castle. During the forenoon (Duha) of that day (Friday) the Sun was eclipsed totalyy and its disk became dark except for a slight portion as seen by eye. [Ibn Hayyan, al-Muqtabis fi Tarikh al-Andalus, vol V, p.434] Ibn Hayyan is here quoting from the contemporary writer al-Razi, who probably resided at Cordoba. It would appear that the eclipse was witnessed while the Caliph and his army were travelling between Welmish and Khalifah. I learn from Dr Edward Cooper of London Guildhall University that the present-day names for Welmish and Khalifah are respectively Olmos and Cueva de la Mora. Olmos is situated approximately 30 km north of Toledo, while Cueva de la Mora is some 20km further north than Olmos. It is difficult to reconcile the two descriptions (i) ‘the Sun was eclipsed totally’ and (ii) ‘its disk became dark except for a slight portion as seen by eye’. Possibly the Sun was reduced to a small point of light or a bright prominence appeared at the solar
158



limb. However, the true phase must remain in doubt. The value of the observation is further weakened by the uncertainty in the precise place of observation.” (Stephenson p. 443-444) The back calculation of the Solar Saros Series – 102 is not accurate. This solar eclipse really happened on Augustus 2, in CE 1133! (JD ~ 20xxxxxx)
The year of CE 945 (Traditional AD = CE 752/753/756)
“753 Jan 9. Reference: Ulster. The first entry for 753 notes that the sun was darkened, but gives no other details. The fact that this is the first entry for the year creates a mild presumption that the eclipse happened early in the year. I did not see any other events near this one that could be a dated independently, so there is no way to test the accuracy of the year. There were rather large eclipses in Ireland on 753 Jan 9 and 758 Apr 12. Since there was a large eclipse during the year stated, and since it came early in the year as the position of the entry suggests, I shall accept the identification of 753 Jan 9. Since there was another possibility with a dating error of 5 years, I shall use the small reliability of 0.2. Place: Ireland. Standard deviation of the magnitude: 0.1. ” (Newton, p.194) “753 Jan 9. Reference: Bede (This is in the ‘Continuation’.) ‘In the year 753, the 5th year of Eadberht’s reign, there was an eclipse of the sun on the 5th ides January (= Jan 9). Later that same year and month, which is the 9th calends February (= Jan 24), the moon endured an eclipse, covered with horrible black shield, like the sun a little before.’ (The Latin text is as rough as my translation.) There are two disturbing features of this report, besides the need to supply ‘5th’ as described in the footnote. The editor (Plummer) says that the original has the year as 756, but that he changed it to 753 because 753 was the only year for a long time in which both a solar and a lunar eclipse were visible in January in England. Since the day of the month is correct for both eclipses, provided that the year is really 753, this action of the editor seems justified. It is more disturbing that the record uses language clearly taken from the record 733 Aug 14b B, E above. This makes one wonder how reliable the copying of the original text was in even the oldest manuscripts that we now have. Since the days of the month are correct, I shall assume that the copyist merely let his eye wander to an earlier annal, and that the record as we now have it is basically correct. I shall lower the reliability to 0.3 because of all the problems with the record. Standard deviation of the magnitude: 0.1. Place: Jarrow.” (Newton, p. 153-4)

The solar eclipse is also mentioned (dark Sun; no month of day) in th AU under 752 (meaning our 753) and in AT O’Connor 1952 makes the greatest magnitude for midIreland be 0.87 at 10.35 a.m. We have encountered no record except from Britain and Ireland.” (Schove p.153-4) This solar eclipse really happened on September 9 in CE 945, not in CE 753 January 9.

The year of CE 956 (Traditional AD = CE 762/763764)
“764 Jun 4. Reference: Ulster. The entry for 763 (after correcting for the systematic error) notes that the sun was darkened at the third hour of the day, but does not give the day of the year. I did not notice any historical events that would allow testing the accuracy of the year. Ulster notes a lunar eclipse for 773 Dec 4. There was a total eclipse of the moon visible in Ireland on that date, but this is too far away to give good confirmation. However, the entry for 762 records ‘a great snow and an eclipse of the moon’. The reference to the great snow and the fact that this is the first entry of the year both suggest an eclipse occurring early in the year. There was an eclipse of magnitude 0.4 on 762 Jan 15 visible in Ireland, a total eclipse on 763 Jan 4, and an eclipse of magnitude 0.8 on 763 Dec 25. There were no other winter eclipses visible in Ireland for several years on either side of these dates. Hence there is a strong presumption that the year 763 is close to being right for the solar eclipse. The only possible eclipse that occurred during the morning was that of 764 Jun 4; it would have been maximum in Ireland at about the 4th hour. Hence this is almost surely the right identification, and the lunar eclipse was thus probably that of 763 Jan 4. This identification is strengthened by the consideration that the lunar eclipse of 763 Jan 4 is the only one of the various possible eclipses that was total.

“M. 979 May 14-15 ANNULAR IN EGYPT This partial lunar eclipse, of Oppolzer magnitude 0.73, occurred entirely before midnight throughout the Western world, during the evening of Wednesday or Thursday. It is one of the Ibn Yunus eclipses. At Cairo it was observed that the Moon rose eclipsed, and that the eclipse ended 1h 12m after sunset.

(Stephenson, p. 482) “As the horizon at Cairo is somewhat hilly towards the south-east accurate limits to Delta T cannot be derived without considering the horizon profile in detail. However, making no allowance for this effect leads to such wide limits for Delta T (-4100 < Delta T < 550) that attempts to refine this solution would not be worthwhile. The observation will thus not be considered further.” (Stephenson, p. 497)

“M. 979 May 28 ANNULAR IN EGYPT This is another Ibn Yunus eclipse. At Cairo the Sun was seen less than half eclipsed; Schroeter’s table suggests a maximum magnitude about 0.40 there.” (Schove, p. 238) “979 May 28. The time given was not stated to be the beginning of the eclipse but rather the time when it became ‘sensible to view’. This time will be ignored. It is not clear whether the magnitude given was the maximum of the eclipse or the magnitude at sunset; it will be necessary to test both possibilities in Part II.” (Newton, AAO p.150) “AD 979 May 28: Cairo [Saros 111] This solar eclipse was in the late afternoon of Wednesday the 23rd of (the month of) Shawwal in the year 368 of al-Hijrah...(date on Persian, Syrian and Coptic calendars)...

Reference: Theophanes. ‘Ninth of September month, Indiction 11, day of the Lord, a very great eclipse of the sun happened at the 5th hour of the day, during mass.’ This was during the 7th year of Constantine VI, emperor 780-797. Calculation from the Indiction according to the rules given in Section XV.1 yields the year 787. The eclipse date 787 Sep 16 was on the first feria, so it looks as if this is a reliable account of that eclipse, with an accidental error of exactly one week in reading the date from the calendar. I would guess that the eclipse was maximum at about the 3rd hour from Oppolzer, but the difference is not enough to affect the identification. It is notable that Theophanes changed his style of reporting eclipses at this point. Since we are now well into his adult life, it is plausible that he has begun to use his own notes. Reliability: 1. Place: Constantinople. Standard deviation of the magnitude: 0.02, since this was a ‘very great’ eclipse. Cedrenus has obviously copied from Theophanes (or from Theophanes’ source if Theophanes is not original). He has the same mistake of giving Sep 9 rather than Sep 16.” (Newton, 1972 p. 544-5) This solar eclipse really happened on May 28 in CE 979, not in CE 787 Sep 16. Delta T ~ Zero sec!

His lunar altitude at ‘l’attouchement par dehors’ is agreed to give about 4.18 a.m., Cairo mean time; Newt.1970, 150 ignores this time because of the phraseology, but Newc.1878, 52 found it less than a quarter of an hour later than this calculated beginning.” (Schove, p. 239) “981 Oct 15.

The first phase is called ‘sensible to view’, so the time of this phase will be ignored. According to Newcomb, the altitude of the moon given for this phase is physically impossible, so that the time is not usable anyway.” (Newton, AAO p. 150-1) “AD 983 Mar 1/2: Cairo [Saros 87] This lunar eclipse was in the month of Ramadan in the year 372 of al-Hijrah on the night whose morning was Friday, the 15th of the month...

“M. 986 Dec. 19 LARGE PARTIAL IN EGYPT A large partial eclipse, of Oppolzer magnitude 0.925 at UT 4h 11m. Ibn Yunus gives magnitude about 0.83 at Cairo, and an initial lunar altitude from which Newcomb finds a beginning at 4.56 a.m., Cairo mean time, about 22m later than Newcomb’s tabular value. At Cairo the Moon set eclipsed. There is also some problematical information, on which Causs.1799, 9 and Causs.1804, 172 differ, and E.B. Knobel may be consulted. See Newcomb 1878 and Newton 1970; the latter author decides to ignore the record.” (Schove, p. 240-1) “986 Dec 19. The heights of the moon at the beginning and at ‘attouchement’ differ by 26 grad. This seems impossible, whatever attouchement may have meant. Further, attouchement would have had to occur before the beginning. It seems likely that parts of different records have been copied by accident. Since the moon set still eclipsed, the altitude listed for the beginning may be correct, and Newcomb used it. I consider it safer to ignore this record altogether.” (Newton, AAO p. 151) “AD 986 Dec 18/19: Cairo [Saros 89] This lunar eclipse was on the night whose morning was Sunday, the 15th of (the month of) Sha’ban in the year 376 of al-Hijrah. The eclipse became noticeable when the altitude of the Moon was 24 deg in the west... RESULTS ...thus Delta T ~ 800 sec. NB an earlier moment for the detection of the eclipse would, of course, lead to a higher result for Delta T.” (Stephenson, p. 485) So, the back calculation of the Lunar Saros Series - 89 is not accurate because of Ptolemy’s wrong phases of the Moon!
It is quite interesting that up to now never entered somebody’s mind such idea that the retro calculation of the 89 Lunar Saros Series perhaps is not perfect.

Goldstine 1973 gives opposition (not quite the same thing as mid-eclipse) at UT 21h 39m. The eclipse was observed at Cairo with magnitude 0.625, according to Ibn Yunus, but the record has been mistrusted.” (Schove, p. 241)

„S. 797-8 March 3? VOLCANIC DARKNESS We have encountered no true record of either of these eclipses, but they need examination to see whether one of them may have any connection with mention (first at Constantinople) of a darkening of the Sun for 17 days. The answer is certainly No. It is know that in 797 (probably mid-August) Irene blinded her son, Constantine VI, and assumed sole imperial power. Under AM 6289 (AD 786-7) Theophanes, a contemporary, says: ‘The Sun was darkened for 17 days and did not give off its rays, so that ships went off course, and everyone said that the Sun stopped shining because of the blinding of the emperor; and thus his mother Irene came to power’. No eclipse fits.... S.797 March 3 was annular and ended at sunset in the Northern Sudan; S.798 Feb. 20 was also annular, but ended at sunset between Scotland an Iceland; Consequently, it is not worth while to give detailed references to later writers who tell the same tale. Among Byzantines, these include George the Monk (Hamartolos), Leo Grammaticus, and Cedrenus. Among other oriental writers, Hamza al-Isfahani.” (Schove, p. 167) “798 Feb 20. Reference: Theophanes. ‘...the sun for 17 days gave off no rays,...’ One may not totally dismiss a story such as this without study. One must consider the possibility that the account has been garbled, or that an actual event has been exaggerated. It is doubtful that this is an exaggerated account of an eclipse. The eclipse of 798 Feb 20 may have been a partial eclipse visible just at sunset in Western Europe, but it should not have been visible at all in Constantinople within seven years of this date. It is possible that a volcanic eruption or some other event put a large amount of dust into the air, and the account seems to suggest this kind of darkening more than an eclipse... I shall not take this to be a record of an eclipse.” (Newton, 1972 p. 545-6) This solar eclipse really happened on October 21 in CE 990.

“S. 993 Aug. 20 TOTAL SOLAR S. MEDITERRANEAN (LARGE IN EGYPT) Oppolzer’s central line of totality begins in Morocco, and proceeds to a noon point near the coast of Pakistan and an end in Indonesia. Schroeter’s band of totality passes just north of Alexandria and almost centrally over Jerusalem. Ibn Yunus says the eclipse was seen at Cairo, with magnitude two thirds of the surface (implying about 0.73 of the diameter). From solar altitudes at beginning and end, Newcomb and Newton find the equivalent of Cairo mean times about 7.43 and 10.25 a.m.” (Schove, p. 243-4) “AD 993 Aug 20: Cairo [Saros 109] This solar eclipse was in the forenoon of Sunday the 29th of (the month of) Jumada al-Ukhra in the year 383 of al-Hijrah... (date on Persian, Syrian and Coptic calendars)... The eclipse began when the altitude of the Sun was 27 deg in the east and was complete (i.e. reached its maximum) when the altitude was 45 deg in the east. The Sun cleared when its altitude was 60 deg in the east. About 2/3 of it (i.e. the surface) was eclipsed. Use of the provisional Delta T result obtained from equation (8.1) (1750 sec) leads to a calculated magnitude of 0.96. The observed magnitude (equivalent to 0.59 in terms of the solar diameter) would thus appear to represent a considerable underestimate (see also section 13.10). This eclipse was independently reported to be total by the Cairo chronicler, al- Maqrizi (see chapter 12). However, al-Maqrizi lived more than four centuries after the event and his source is unknown. RESULT ...thus Delta T = 2000 sec. NB for this eclipse to be partial at Cairo, in accordance with the observation recorded by Ibn Yunus, either Delta T < -2800 or Delta T > -750 sec. Neither of these limits are at all critical and will be disregarded in further investigation.” (Stephenson, p. 474-5) So, the back calculation of the Solar Saros Series - 109 is not accurate.

It was so dark that the stars appeared and people could not see the palms of their hands. The eclipse cleared at the end of the day. [Al-Maqrizi: Itti’az alHunafa bi Akhbar al-A’imma al-Fatimiyin al-Khulafa, vol. I, p.280] Although al-Maqrizi spent most of his life in Cairo, he wrote more than four centuries after the eclipse. Hence the place of observation must be regarded as very doubtful; there is nothing in the text itself to indicate a Cairo source. Although al-Maqrizi appears to quote from an eye-witness description of totality, careful observations made in Cairo and recorded by the contemporary astronomer ibn Yunus indicate that the eclipse was only partial there and ended in mid-morning (see chapter 13). Al-Maqrizi may have obtained his information from a source much to the east of Cairo.
Calculation using equation (Delta T = 1750 sec) indicate that at Cairo the magnitude would be 0.96 at 8.9 h.”... (Stephenson, p. 444) So, the back calculation of the Solar Saros Series - 102 is not accurate. This solar eclipse really happened on September 4 in CE 1187!!! (JD ~ 2154856)

For the solar eclipse I take the following: Place, England; standard deviation of magnitude, 0.06, reliability, 1. Since neither the hour nor the magnitude of the lunar eclipse [July 1] was recorded, the lunar eclipse report does us no good. Newcomb does not include the eclipse of 809 in his list of eclipses visible in England.” (Newton, AAO p. 51-52) This solar eclipse really happened on October 12 in CE 999 not in CE 809 July 16.

and when the altitude of (the star) al-hadi was 14 deg in the west. The altitude of (the star) (al-simak) al-ramih at the complete clearance was 35 deg. There is evidence of scribal errors in recording both altitudes of alpha Boo. The elevation if this star at first contact (implying an LT of 20.25 h) is incompatible with that of alpha Aur at the same moment (LT= 23.55 h). However, the symbols for the numbers 12 and 52 are so similar that confusion is not uncommon- as noted by Caussin (1804). Reading 52 deg for altitude of alpha Boo leads to a LT of 23.48 h, which is in fairly good accord with that derived from the alpha Aur measurement. This altitude will thus be adopted. Assumption of an altitude for alpha Boo of 35 deg in the west at the end of the eclipse implies an LT of 6.41 h. This is about 40 minutes after sunrise, so that the star would be invisible; further, an excessive duration for the eclipse of nearly 7 h would be implied. In this case, it is not possible to satisfactorily restore the altitude measurement at last contact. RESULT .... thus Delta T = 1750 and 1950 sec. The Delta T results obtained in this section are listed in table 13.3, and are plotted in figure 13.7. Comparison between figure 13.7 and figure 13.6 shows that the scatter is considerably greater for the lunar data. A partial explanation is poorer resolution of the contacts, perhaps combined with the greater difficulty of reading an instrument at night.” (Stephenson, p. 486-8)
It is quite interesting that up to now never entered somebody’s mind such idea that the retro calculation of the 97 Lunar Saros Series perhaps is not perfect.
So, the back calculation of the Lunar Saros Series - 97 is not accurate. This lunar eclipse really happened on March 1/2 in CE 1002. Delta T ~ Zero sec! (JD ~ 2087098.5)

“1004 Jan 24. This record gives times for both the beginning and being sensible to view. These times will be ignored, as will the time of greatest phase of this record and elsewhere. The record does not say whether the magnitude is of the diameter or the area. Luckily, the difference is ignorable for a solar eclipse this large. It will be necessary in Part II to test for the point of observation lying on both sides of the zone of totality, and to hope that one possibility can be excluded on a ‘reasonableness’ basis.” (Newton, AAO p. 151)

“AD 1004 Jan 24: Cairo. [Saros 105] This solar eclipse was in the sign of Aquarius and was in the late afternoon of Monday the 29th of the month of Rabi’ al-Awwal in the year 394 of al Hijrah... (date on Persian, Syrian and Coptic calendars)... The Sun was eclipsed until what remained of it resembled the crescent Moon on the first night of the month. I estimated the eclipsed portion of the Sun to be 11 digits (i.e. of surface). The altitude of the Sun when the eclipse became noticeable in it (i.e. on its disk) was 16.5 deg in the west; thus I estimated (the altitude) at the beginning to be 18.5 deg. About quarter of the diameter was eclipsed when altitude was 15 deg, and half of the diameter was eclipsed when altitude was 10 deg. The eclipse was complete (i.e. maximum phase) when altitude was 5 deg. Although the eclipse was generally annular, it is clear from the text that the observed phase at Cairo was only partial. The progress of the eclipse was carefully followed, and it thus seems very unlikely that the observers overlooked the annular phase.
RESULTS For a partial eclipse at Cairo, either Delta T < 1770 or Delta T > 1940 sec. Since the belt of annularity was rather narrow, only a restricted range of Delta T is ruled out by the observation of a partial eclipse. It is unfortunate that Ibn Yunus does not state whether the upper or lower part of the Sun remained visible. If he had done so, one of the above Delta T ranges would have been excluded. His remark that what remained of the eclipsed Sun ‘resembled the crescent Moon on the first night of the month’ may simply be an indication of the narrowness of the solar crescent, not necessarily the direction in which it was facing. (NB computed LT of maximum phase = 16.7 h; solar altitude = 7deg.)” (Stephenson, p, 468)
It is quite interesting that up to now never entered somebody’s mind such idea that the retro calculation of the 105 Solar Saros Series perhaps is not perfect.
“812 May 14. Reference: Theophanes. ’14 of May month, day sixth, a great solar eclipse happened for about three and half hours, from the eighth hour until the eleventh hour.’ (Newton, 1972 p. 546) “S. 812 May 14. The hours in Theophanes and Michael are reasonable for Western Asia Minor and Syria respectively.” (Schove, p. 180) “S. 814 Sept. 17 CALCULATED SOLAR ECLIPSE The later Genealogia ducum Brabantiae ampliata says, with reference to Charlemagne, ‘quo moriente sol obscuratus est’. Other references may exist, as in our reading we have not always noted vague statements of this kind, which frequently accompany accounts of the deaths of famous persons, and smack of superstition. There was no suitable solar eclipse near or after Charlemagne’s death (814 Jan. 28)... The report is most likely to have arisen either from a mere computational result, or as an abridgement of the usual allusions to eclipsed before Charlemagne’s death...” (Schove, p. 182) So, the back calculation of the Solar Saros Series - 105 is not accurate. This solar eclipse really happened on January 24 in CE 1004. Delta T ~ Zero sec! (JD ~ 2087792)

“S. 813 May 4 TOTAL SOLAR IN SOUTH-EASTERN EUROPE... The primary account is that of Theophanes in the original Greek (Latin versions wrong). Western accounts are almost worthless, being mainly garbled versions of the Byzantine record. Correctly under AM 6305, Theophanes, Chronographia. On the 4th of May an eclipse of the Sun occurred in the 12th degree of Taurus, according to astronomical calculation, as the Sun was rising; and great fear fell on the multitudes’. (Schove, p.180) “813 May 4. Reference: Theophanes. In the year following the preceding account we find: ‘On the 4th of May month an eclipse of the sun happened near the 12th degree of Taurus.’ The position given for the sun was probably taken from tables a calendar
