Tablet #36. Obverse. Line-drawing by Marcel Sigrist. The translation
of this tablet would not have been possible without Mr. Sigrist's line
drawings (I wouldn't have even attempted it). Even the most experienced
Sumerologist would have difficulty translating this tablet from a
photograph without being able to turn the tablet in the light so that the
signs can be seen to best advantage. The crowded lettering, the
compressed signs, and the worn and damaged condition of the tablet
would make it almost illegible to a modern reader. The line-drawings by
Marcel Sigrist (he's done thousands of them) have the beauty of art and
the precision of science.

Tablet #36: Reverse (back). The rounded side of a tablet is the back.
When the front of a tablet was filled with writing, it was flipped over
bottom-to-top (and not right to left, like the page of a book) and the
writing was continued down the back. This makes the writing on the
back of a tablet "upside down" relative to the writng on the front.

1. You [x-x...]
2. Fate [x-x...]
3. Lu-mah, the abundant lord, is a bull [x-x...]
The Sumerian word for "king" is Lu-gal, which literally means "man
great". The subject of this story is Lu-mah, which likewise means "man
great". But instead of writing Lu-mah, the scribe writes Lu-mah(2),
which is pronounced the same, but written with a different sign,
making it nonsensical within the context of the sentence. This was used to
disguise the meaning of the story. To openly mock a great king was a
dangerous thing to do. The scribe could never "publish" this tablet, or even
Annotations for "The Great Fatted Bull" about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/6901.html
1 of 13 8/18/2020, 5:41 PM



quote it aloud at his local tavern. To ridicule
a powerful ruler could have fatal consequences, as the story itself will soon
reveal.
Lu-mah is the name of the Great Fatted Bull. He is named according
to his character, like "John Bull" or "Mr. King". This may be the earliest
known use of this literary convention.
Decoding Lu-mah is described in greater detail in the Transliteration.
4. May the fatted bull the abundant gift of fatherhood [x-x...]
5. Great Fatso is treasured. To the Great Fatso the workmen
send [x-x...]
More word-play: Gal-niga, “great-fattened”, is an adjective used to
describe livestock. The scribe places it at the beginning of the sentence,
where the subject/noun should be, making it into a title for the bull. It is
translated as "Great Fatso” because it's clearly meant to be derogatory
(and it's how the scribe would say it if he translated it into modern
English, as explained in line o5 of the Transliteration). "Great Fatso" is
Lu-mah's lordly address, like “Your Highness” and “Your Majesty”.
Ironically, Sumerians usually regarded a bull as the symbol
of strength and heroism.
6. He bellows:
To the bull, "Bring to me the gifts of food!"
To the bull, "Now send to me my lady!"
Voice + bull + repetitive processing (to the bull. . . to the bull. . . ) is a
literary device used to evoke the bellowing of a bull. The italics, needless to
say, are my own.
The word šagal means both “food” and “fodder”, in keeping with the
man/bull theme.
The Lord Lu-mah is calling for his wife – the sign used is nin, “a titled
Lady”, and not munus, “a woman” – presumably for a conjugal visit (he's a
bull, after all).
7. Lu-mah declares, "My abundant fate is like the Majestic
Shrine.

"It's accumulating up to the heavens!"
Notice how the word "abundant" is used repeatedly in the opening
lines of the story to descibe everything about Lu-mah. It's a wry
commentary on his waistline. Even his name (lu2 = man, or "he who";
mah = large) could be interpreted as "fat man", or "he who is fat".
This sentence may be a reference to Esh-Mah (shrine-great),
otherwise known as the Majestic Shrine, in the city of Nippur. It's
impossible to tell if the sentence is just a metaphor or if a shrine is actually
being built by the workers mentioned in line o5. In either case, the
sentence evokes the image of a great ziggurat to comment on Lu-mah's
ever-increasing amplitude.
The sentence is spoken by Lu-mah with unintentional irony. It is, of
course, the Great Abundant Bull himself who is accumulating (in size
and possessions) up to the heavens. Throughout the story, the scribe uses
verbs that mean "to accumulate" as a way of saying
"to grow fat" (see Transliteration, line r5). "Accumulating" also suggests
the acquisitiveness of a great lord, as soon will be shown, and the shrine
represents it as his god-given right, the divine right of a
king. The monumental shrine, and Lu-mah's great fatness, are symbols of
his colossal greed.
8. He goes into the village, to make the rounds.
He wanders through the marketplace, feeling most
important.
He passes by Grain Field #5 . . .
He enters Grain Field #5, to fill his great bull hands!
Field #5 refers to a person's assigned parcel of land. The
Sumerians allocated fields of farmland to local officials for their
upkeep. Grain rations were also issued as a kind of salary. The henbur
grain mentioned in the next line refers to the edible parts of a reed or
rush.
Grain Field #5 is one of the many small fields of allotted
farmland that surrounded a Sumerian village. The setting is a microcosm
of Sumer itself. The story is Sumerian history. The Fatted Bull is a local
lord who thinks he is a king.

9. “I proclaim this field a gift! And this henbur grain I'll
take!
"With many different wives for my virile self.
10. "And so with my labor, I'll support myself and my
mother!”
His mother? During this kingly proclamation, he's actually talking
about his mother?
Apparently Lu-mah is still a young bull (man) and he's something of
a mama's boy, but there's another reason why he mentions his mother:
He's doing it for his mother, so it's for a good cause. Tyrants
always give a lofty reason for their actions. This is the first of two
propaganda ploys used by the Great Fatted Bull: The Lord Lu-mah
isn't doing this for his own selfish reasons. He is only doing it because he
is the sole support of his sainted mother. Who could fault him for that? A
king will always proclaim that his war of conquest is for a noble cause.
On a different note, given the context of the many "wives" in the
previous sentence, just what exactly does Lu-mah mean by his "labor"?
11. [x-x...] He gets into a huge argument with everyone.
Not surprisingly, he gets into a dispute with the owners of the field.
12. [x-x...] . . . goes the angry lord.
13. [Lord (?)] [x-x] [something, something]
The tablet is heavily damaged in this area.
14. Then the Lord Fatso returns to his village. He proclaims,
“I'm the man who yoked the bandits!”
Propaganda is the art of calling your neighbor a thief to justify
stealing his land.
In modern parlance this would be called "blaming the victim".
Sumerian kings routinely boasted that they placed a yoke on the
necks of thieves, criminals, and foreign enemies.
Lu-mah tells us he has yoked the bandits, so we are expecting to see
many prisoners that are tough "desperados" – but in the next sentence,
Annotations for "The Great Fatted Bull" about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/6901.html

who are the first people we see?
15. He drags the slave women and their captive kinsmen into
his fortress.
This is the Great Fatted Bull's victory procession where the king
parades his captives through the streets in neck stocks. For now, in his
own mind at least, Lu-mah is truly a king.
This one family represents all of the families who throughout history
have suffered a similar fate in war.
The Sumerians, when they weren't fighting against foreign invasions,
often fought
each other. Sumerian history is filled with countless civil wars between the
city-states when local lords battled for regional supremacy. During one of
the wars, when many lords were fighting, a bewildered historian asked,
"Who was king? Who was not king?"
The Sumerian people seem to have accepted constant warfare as
a matter of routine.
This can be seen in the "year names" of the Sumerian calendar. Each
calendar year was not known by a number, but was named for an
important event (e.g., "the year Amar-Suen became king"). All
too often, it was "the year City X was destroyed", or "the year City Y was
destroyed". Sometimes it was "the year cities X and Y were destroyed".
These are enemy cities, the Sumerian towns that were destroyed
in retaliation were seldom mentioned in the official year names. During
the reign of King Shulgi, one year was named: "Year that the enemy cities
of Simurrum and Lullubum were destroyed for the ninth time". This was
the world that the scribe lived in, where he and his family might be
murdered or enslaved when yet another Fatted Bull (foreign or domestic)
came roaring into town.
16. Lu-mah commands, “I order the father to trample his
fields into mash!”
Grain mash: used to make fodder and beer.
“Our father’s fields” was an expression sometimes used to mean
“homeland”. The symbolism of the passage is clear. It's a lot like the
Sumerian proverb, "The warring brothers destroyed their father's house."

"Su-ba" is the name of the hero of this story. Like "Lu-mah", the
name of the Great Fatted Bull, it is written as a pun at the sign level. Also
like Lu-mah, it's a name that describes the character's role in the
story while at the same time hiding his identity. Su-ba means "shepherd".
For notes on decoding his name, see line o18 in the Transliteration.
{Lu-mah says to Su-ba, the "shepherd brother", son of the
unfortunate father, and the brother of the slave women: }
17. “I’ll sell you Pasture #5. Give me all your heaps of grain."
"Pasture #5": After the father has been humiliated by having to
trample his own crops into mash, his land will be stripped of all its grain
to make fodder for the Great Fatted Bull. The shorn fields of the father will
thus become a "pasture”, fit only for the grazing of sheep. An added irony
is the well-known fact that sheep are able to graze on barren pastures that
cannot support other kinds of livestock.
The Great Fatted King is offering to "sell" to the son the land that has
been stolen from the father. His asking price is all the heaps of grain. The
shepherd's meager grain reserves (surplus grain that's stored for use
during winter and for emergencies like drought and famine) will later
be tossed onto Lu-mah's great big Mountain of Grain.
There are many different levels of irony in the first sentence. It shows
that Lu-mah has a sense of humor, albeit a sarcastic one. Lu-mah is the
world's first "snide villain", the type that has become so popular in
modern movies. Notice how Lu-mah abruptly changes his tone
in the above two sentences. At first he is humorous, but then he becomes
menacing.
18. [x-x...]-like, the shepherd brother.
The shepherd is always "the good guy” in any Sumerian story.

{The shepherd brother speaks: }
1. “I will not bow before the man who seizes everything but
wisdom.
"He is not a strong man.
Ki. . . su-ub: to prostrate oneself, literally "to rub the nose on the
ground". This is the ritualized bow that is performed in the presence of a
god. Lu-mah wants to be worshiped as a deified king, a living god.
“He is not a strong man” foreshadows the last line. In this sentence,
and in the next, Su-ba repeatedly reminds The Great Fatted Lord that a
king is not a god, but just a man.
2. "Earth and the heavens feel troubled
when this man is bellowing for plunder!”
This sentence, like line o8, emphasizes Lu-mah's dual nature of man
and bull. Sometimes Lu-mah is a man, sometimes he's a bull. Sometimes
he is both at once. Lu-mah is a man who bellows, he is a bull with hands.
In ancient Sumer a king was traditionally portrayed as a good
shepherd. He is depicted wearing a shepherd’s woolen hat rather than
the crown of a king or the helmet of a warrior. (Not just kings, but even
the gods themselves were likened unto shepherds. There is not

a bad word said about shepherds in all of Sumerian literature). An ancient
Sumerian would instantly recognize the shepherd as The Good King of the
story. Tablet #36 is really all about the Good King vs. the Bad King.
3. Beating ribs, beating back and shoulders, like a storm
arose the angry lord!
A Sumerian, unaccustomed to this kind of plot twist, would have
been shocked by this unexpected turn of events. The good king
is introduced, he makes a short speech, and then he is summarily beaten
to death by the bad king. After that, he is never heard from again.
This should be the part of the story where the hero prevails. But the scribe
doesn’t really say the shepherd brother is dead. The wording is
deliberately ambiguous. It leaves some doubt as to the fate of the shepherd
brother, and it thus foreshadows what comes later.
This is not a fight or a duel. The shepherd brother is a bound
prisoner who is yoked in a neck stock. “Beating back and shoulders”
means that a whip was used.
The lord’s violent reaction to the shepherd brother’s speech shows
why the scribe encoded this tablet so it couldn't be read. Anyone who
dared to criticize a great lord would suffer the same fate as the shepherd
brother. The scribe risked his life to tell this story.
{The scene shifts to Lord Fatso’s victory feast.}
4. He eats his food like a pig. The Pig divides the fodder into
five big bowls,
and with his hand, he crams it into his mouth and chokes it
down.
The five big bowls hold the grain of Field #5 that the father trampled
into mash (fodder).
It's called "poetic justice". The Great Fatted Bull is choking on his ill
gotten gains, although it doesn't seem to stop him from eating:
5. "My flanks grow fat!" he bellows, while eating all the
food his hands can grab.
Again with Lu-mah's grasping hands. This is one of seventeen minor
themes in the story of The Great Fatted Bull, in less than 40 lines (!) not to

mention the numerous major themes (man, bull, king, satire, murder
mystery, etc.). See "A Masterpiece".
6. A man, clothed in darkness, climbs in through the window.
The slave women rush to his side.
It's at first surprising to see women rushing toward
a man climbing in through a window at night. Although confusing at first,
this minor detail is the best clue we have for the identity of the intruder. It
forces us to recognize for ourselves the identity of the man emerging from
the window. Although the intruder is never named, it is of course the
shepherd brother. This is nonetheless a surprise development. When last
seen, the shepherd brother was yoked, bound, and beaten to within an
inch of his life. It's as if he has risen from the dead.
So... how did Su-ba escape from captivity?
What's most telling is what's not said. The sisters do not express
alarm when they see a man climbing through the window, nor do they
show surprise when they realize it's their shepherd brother. They do not
give thanks to find him so miraculously free and alive, nor do they rejoice
in their own deliverance. They simply go to his side without a word, as if
on cue.
It’s as if they knew he was coming, which suggests they also
somehow treated his wounds and aided in his escape.
They are in on the plot. The stage is set for the coup d’état.
7. The man says, “Here’s a gift to anoint the bull! To make him
permanently bellow
with great burning indigestion!”
It’s a line straight out of Hollywood.
The gift is for Lu-mah's coronation, "anointment", as a king.
8. Nose to nose, the lord and the "man not his servant"
{rebel, enemy}
throttle each other.This line absolves the butler of any suspicion
of wrongdoing.
9. The lord opens his mouth and swears two oaths to his

adversary.
10. He gasps, “Feed-grain . . . to abandon! This great eating to
diminish!"
Had he not made these two promises, he would have been strangled
to death.
11. His mother says, “The Fatted Lord is not a lordly one.
"As for me, I know that I don't place great trust in him.”
His own mother says that.
It's an odd thing for a mother to say about her only son, just
moments after his attempted murder. No cries of shock and alarm? No
anguished cries of "My son! My son! Are you okay?" No cries of outrage
for this terrible crime? None of this. Nor does she act the least bit
surprised by this sudden turn of events. Instead, she just calmly
announces that she doesn't really trust Lord Fatso. She's acting more like a
conspirator than a mother, and it sounds as if she's speaking for all of the
conspirators. Could it be that Lu-mah's own mother, his sainted mother,
is in on the plot against him?
Of course she is. After all, a mother knows best.
Is everyone against the Great Fatted Bull?
12. His wife shares his Mountain of Grain with his slave
women
and their slave companions.
What's this? The last that was heard of the long suffering Lady
Fatted Bull was a brief mention at the beginning of the story when she was
being summoned (yet again) by the Great Fatted Lord. Now,
suddenly, here she is again, cavorting with the slaves and their
"companions"? ... the known conspirators? Come to think of it, she's the
one with the most to gain from the attempted murder of Mr. Fatted
Bull. She has taken possession of Lu-mah's domains, and her distribution
of his "mountain of grain" with such largesse can be construed
as some kind of pay off.
The wife has now moved to the top of the suspect list. This brings up
an interesting question: Could Su-ba and his sisters really succeed without
Annotations for "The Great Fatted Bull" about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/6901.html
10 of 13 8/18/2020, 5:41 PM



the wife as their accomplice?
Probably not. This is starting to look like an inside job.
You may, perhaps, think I am reading too much into the story. If so,
then consider this:
It's not easy being married to the Lord Lu-mah. He is a greedy,
demanding, gluttonous man.
He eats his food like a pig, he has a bull's sexual appetite,
and he's violently demonstrated
what happens to people who dare to cross him. His wife is a desperately
unhappy woman.
As everybody knows, a miserable wife is always the prime suspect in the
attempted murder
of her husband.
It is easy for a modern reader, unaccustomed to rigid
class distinctions, to miss the importance of this clue. A modern
reader assumes the wife shared her bounty with the slaves simply
because she is a nice lady. But for a Sumerian, this clue is a dead giveaway.
Even if he was confused about what was happening thus far, this would
open his eyes.
It must be remembered that the wife is a Lady, with a capital "L", the wife
of a great lord. Any proper Sumerian would be shocked to see a
noblewoman frolicking with the slaves in this unseemly manner. It just
wasn't done. So her behavior would immediately raise suspicions,
and eyebrows.
It doesn't take a great stretch of the imagination for a modern reader
to likewise suspect that the Great Fatso has just been cuckolded (assuming
that human nature has not changed too much in the last 4,000 years).
Even if the adultery hasn't already happened, it soon will,
because this is more than just a simple murder plot, it is also a love story.
The scribe doesn't tell us what happened behind the scenes, but he
gives a clue that leaves no doubt as to what really occurred: The wife is
present when the Great Fatted Bull drags his captives into the
fortress. The shepherd brother, the answer to her prayers and the
solution to all of her problems, is hauled in before her; a prisoner, like
herself. She falls in love with the handsome shepherd when he stands up
to Lu-mah and gives his speech about a man being wise and good. She

then watches in horror as the shepherd brother is savagely beaten by her
cruel husband. Afterwards, she secretly arranges for the shepherd's escape
and for the sisters to treat his wounds. Some time later, she makes a
clandestine visit. Words are said, plans are made...
The wife is the mastermind of the operation. She's the one who sets
the plot in motion. She's the one who makes things happen. This is the
only way to logically explain Su-ba's "miraculous" escape from captivity.
After all, she is the only one with the means, the motive,
and the opportunity.
For women, the wife's actions would seem tantamount to a divorce.
Notice how the scribe still insists on not identifying the "unknown
assailant". It must be assumed by the reader that the shepherd and his
father are the "companions". Su-ba is referred to as "the man" (climbing
through the window), the "man not his servant" (rebel), the
adversary, and the companion, but he is never identified by name. This
makes Tablet #36 the world's first true murder mystery because the
reader must solve the case for himself using the clues provided.
As it turns out, Lu-mah's reign as a king did not last through his
victory feast.
The moral of the story seems to be that the Good King (the shepherd
brother) and the Good Queen (the wife) live happily ever after.
13. The fatted bull reaps one single twig of his henbur grain.
Notice how we quickly go from hyperbole (a mountain of grain) in the
last sentence, to understatement in this sentence (a single twig of grain,
not even a whole stalk).
For men, this would also seem like a divorce.

Grain Field #4!
In pasture he grows fat again.
The grain fields seem to be some kind of dowry offering. The
sentence is a comment on the intermarriage between rich people and the
nobility: She has the land, but no royal title
(she is called munus, "woman", and not nin, "Lady"). Lu-mah has
the royal title, but no land. A king could often gain through marriage what
he could not win by conquest.
"In pasture" has the same meaning as "out to pasture", with its usual
connotations of grazing, retirement, and stud.
16. The man goes to do his work. He walks in the pasture,
completely satisfied [x-x]
Here at the end, things turn out pretty good for Lu-mah.

Transliteration of The Great Fatted Bull
56-72 minutes
Detail: Lyre inlay which depicts some rather fanciful scenes and characters. Note the
bearded bullmen in the top panel.
Notes:
1. Verification: Every sign and its definition has been verified through the ePSD, the ETCSL,
the CDLI, the Sumerian Lexicon, and other resources (see the Links page for the meanings of
these abbreviations). My criteria for using a sign definition was it had to appear at least twice
in the ePSD, ETCSL, or the SL (and in the proper context). These are well-attested,
commonly accepted definitions that are correct for the period when the tablet was written.
2. Sign recognition: The scribe uses a "compressed" writing style (the signs are simplified
to make them easier to write and some of them are shortened to save space on the line).
Therefore many of the signs look different than the classic cuneiform script. Every sign on this
tablet has been matched with multiple examples from other known tablets. I do not point out
all of the compressed signs on this tablet because there are 44 occurrences. Basically, if a
sign doesn't look like the ePSD font, then it's compressed, and it can be found on the CDLI's Ur
III and Old Babylonian tablets. Click here to see some examples of the compressed signs. Select

the "Tablet #36 Sign List" tab on the upper left to see all of the signs on the tablet.
3. Strings: For the sake of word separation, not all the word strings are connected.
4. Pronunciation: Š is pronounced "sh", as in shepherd. Ĝ is pronounced "ng", as in sing.
The "H" sound in Sumerian ("ḫ") is pronounced as in the word, "loch". The numerical subscript
of a sign (for example, ĝe26) is a modern convention used to delineate the different meanings
of the sign. It is not pronounced when the word is said aloud.
For first time readers: Written Sumerian doesn't have a direct word-for-word correlation
with verbal speech. For instance, where we would write, "I went to the store to buy some
bread", in Sumerian it would probably be written as "store go bread buy". The reader is often
left to infer such things as articles (a, an, the), verb tense (go, going, has gone), and personal
pronouns (I, you, they go. . . ). All of this would depend on the context of the surrounding
sentences. These details would be supplied by the reader when the sentence is read aloud.
In a way, Sumerian writing "just hits the high spots", so it can sound somewhat telegraphic.
Note, too, that written Sumerian has a "backwards" way of expressing things, in terms of
word formation (bull fatted) and syntax (bull to food send). This artificial construction applied
only to written Sumerian, in an attempt to make it more readable. When the sentence was
read aloud, it was converted to the natural patterns of verbal speech. The first time through,
to get a feel for the actual writing on this tablet, you may want to skip the notes, which are
rather voluminous, especially at the beginninng.

Fate ...
o3. lu2-maḫX ḫi-li-a gu4! me [x ...]
Lu-mah abundant bull be
MahX = AL = mah2 = mah: A pun, used throughout the text as “great” (also see:
o7, o8, o11, r7, r10, r11, r14). This one sign (mahX) is the lock, and the key,
to understanding this tablet. An explanation follows, and additional information
can be found in Appendix A at the end of this page.
AL: Whenever a sign name is written in capital letters, it represents any and all of
the possible meanings and pronunciations of the sign. AL can mean al: hoe, fence, etc.; and
it can also mean mah2: cow. It can also be a CVNE, or it may be just a syllable in one
of 72 other Sumerian words listed on the ePSD. The capitalized sign name is used when it's not
known which of the meanings apply. So when this sign is first encountered in a
line of untranslated text, it's initially called AL because it's not yet known which of its various
meanings (and pronunciations) is the one being used.
AL is one of the reasons why this tablet was so difficult to translate. Tablet #36
could be subtitled "What about AL?" The scribe uses the sign a lot, it shows up
in the most unexpected places, and none of the definitions of AL make a bit of sense
within the context of the sentences (and AL isn't being used as a Compound Verb
Nominal Element, in case you were wondering). The sign is used persistently and
intrusively throughout the text, as if the scribe was deliberately over-using the sign
for some unknown reason. Which seems rather odd, because this ubiquitous sign
is completely bewildering in every sentence where it appears.
It slowly began to dawn on me: perhaps it was more than a coincidence that every time
I started to understand the meaning of the text, this annoying sign would pop up again,
only to create more confusion. Although at first I didn't have the faintest idea about
the contents of the tablet, I began to suspect that the mysterious sign was somehow
the key to unlocking a secret translation.
To make a long story short, it took me a long, long time to figure it out. Then one day,
finally, it occurred to me. I realized that AL is really mah2, a pun for mah:
mah2: "cow".
One of the meanings of AL is mah2, an adjective for a dairy cow. I had briefly
considered it as a possible translation for the sign, but I immediately discarded it
Transliteration of The Great Fatted Bull about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/9801/index.html

because it was bound to be completely nonsensical in any sentence where it appeared.
However, the important thing about the sign is that it's pronounced like mah:
mah: "great".
On this tablet, the sign mah2 (cow) is written to mean mah (great, supreme, large,
majestic, etc.). Because the numerical subscripts of a sign are "silent", mah and mah2
are pronounced the same. Throughout the text, in all eight sentences where it appears,
the sign mah2, "cow", is used exactly as if it were the sign mah, meaning "great". The
consistent use of the sign in this particular way requires a new designation for the sign.
It is called:
mahX: = AL = mah2 = mah = "great".
The "X" in mahX stands for an unknown subscript number. As a subscript number, it is
unpronounced when the word is said aloud. MahX, mah, and mah2 are pronounced exactly
the same.
This at first might not seem like a big deal. It may be clever enough as wordplay,
but it seemed that the scribe went through an awful lot of trouble only to bring forth
this one little pun. There is, however, a method to his madness. This sign is used
to obscure the meaning of the text, to make it difficult to read the tablet, because of the
volatile contents of the story. As will later be shown, this sign (pun) is also used
as a hint to the secret context of the tablet.
When I decoded mahX, the confusion in the sentences disappeared. At least now
the sentences were no longer so nonsensical. At least now they could be translated...
which leads to the crux of the problem: Even after this big breakthrough, I had not yet
translated a single complete sentence, or even half of one. Various words and phrases
hinted at many possible meanings for the story, but I still couldn't read the tablet.
The reason why I was having so much difficulty was the "missing context" of the story.
In Sumerian, context is everything – because all of the signs have multiple meanings.
I therefore needed to know the context (subject) of the writing, in order to eliminate the
many alternative definitions of the signs, so I could concentrate only on the meanings
that might actually make some sense within the framework of the story. For instance,
if I knew a story was about animals, with the sign UR, which means "person, pride,
unity, fish, dog, servant, man, etc.", I could ignore all of the definitions except for "dog".
Transliteration of The Great Fatted Bull about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/9801/index.html
4 of 29 8/18/2020, 5:41 PM



By contrast, all of the definitions could apply if I didn't know the context of the story.
So I therefore needed to know what I was "reading to". Without a known context
it is difficult to read even a simple Sumerian sentence. Not even another Sumerian
could easily read it.
Trying to read Tablet #36 without knowing the context was something of a Catch-22.
I needed to know the context of the writing in order to read the signs, but I had to
read the signs in order to know the context (!) It is very difficult to read a tablet with
an unknown context (and Tablet #36 has two unknown contexts; more on that later).
The missing context(s) of the story is one of the reasons why the tablet seems so
iincomprehensible.
The context of a story is usually given in the first few opening lines of the text.
Unfortunately, the opening lines of the story are missing due to damage on the tablet,
so it seemed that the context would never be known. Fortunately, as luck (or Fate)
would have it, the tablet broke off at just the right place. Here, in the first two signs
of the first readable fragment of a line, is a hint to the "hidden context" of the story.
The two signs are lu2-mahX. As per the pun meaning of mahX, the signs can be
translated as "man-great". On this tablet, lu-mah (big man, great man) is synonymous
with the sign lugal (big man, great man) meaning "lord or king".
This is the secret hidden context of the story: lu-mah = "man-great" = lugal = king.
gal-lu2
Lugal is the Sumerian sign for "king". It is two signs joined together. It's written as gal-lu2,
but it's pronounced "lu-gal" (man-great). It is one of the oldest and most recognizable of the
Sumerian signs. Unlike most of the other signs, which have multiple meanings, this sign
means little else besides its usual definition of "king, lord, master". The scribe doesn't use this
symbol because it's too unmistakable, too unambiguous. If the sign lugal was on this tablet,
then everyone would know what it's written about.
lu2 mah
Lu-mah, literally "man-great", like the above lugal. Mah and gal both mean "great".
lu2 mah2 (mahX)

Lu-mah2, as it appears on Tablet #36. It literally means "man dairy cow", which is
nonsensical, but it's pronounced the same as the above lu-mah (man-great). This pun is a hint
to the secret "hidden context" of the story: lu2-mahX = "man-great" = lugal = king. Lu-mah is
the name of the Great Fatted Bull.
This is not just clever wordplay. Mah2 is introduced early in the story and it is used
many times throughout the text, in a manner for which it was never intended, creating
confusion in every sentence where it appears. If mah2/manX is just a pun, why bother?
Why not use it once, and then use a simple, easily recognizable sign like gal (or mah!)
for all other occurrences of the word "great"? The fact is, no self respecting writer
would create so much havoc in his own composition just to pound on one single pun
eight different times. Which begs the question: why does the scribe deliberately
use a sign that's nonsensical in every sentence where it appears? What is his purpose?
To put it simply, mahX is used to obscure the "king" context of the story, and without
a known context, it is difficult, if not impossible, to read the other signs on the tablet.
Here's how lu2-mahX works: "Lu2 = man. Okay, that was easy enough; so far, so good.
Then, AL = al; a hoe? a fence? Surely it's not mah2, a cow??" Mah2 actually means
"a mature, milk producing cow", which is the opposite of a bull in all regards. Mah2 can
refer to any female animal that has given birth and is therefore capable of producing milk.
So even if mah2 is initially considered as a possible translation for the sign, it would be
immediately discarded as nonsensical (man dairy cow?) and so the pun would be lost,
and along with it, the hint to the secret context of the tablet.
That's the beauty and the genius of this sign. Even if the reader guesses the correct
pronunciation of the sign, he doesn't believe it because it's the wrong definition.
When a Sumerian tried to read this tablet and encountered mah2 (cow), he would do
exactly what I did the first time, he would toss the ridiculous cow right out the window,
and in so doing, lose the king context. After trying unsuccessfully to read the tablet
without understanding mahX and the hidden king concept, a Sumerian would give up
and call the tablet "nonsense". This is precisely what the scribe wanted him to do.
Modern Sumerologists did the same thing, and likewise gave up trying to read the tablet.
Only someone who was truly obsessed (like I was) would persevere and keep trying
to understand this enigmatic tablet. As described in Aventures in Cuneiform Writing,
when I finally got past mah2 (cow) and I realized that it is actually mahX (great), then
the secret king was revealed. After that, I started making real progress in the translation
because now I knew the context.

So, in a way, mahX is both the lock and the key to this tablet. It obscures the true
meaning of the text (the lock), but once it's understood it reveals the hidden context
of the story (the key), which makes it possible to read the other signs on the tablet.
The repeated use of mahX is like the tumblers of the lock. A key doesn't work until
all of the tumblers are in place. When one single word fits in all eight sentences, then
and only then, the tablet finally opens up and it's true meaning is revealed.
The scribe encoded the tablet this way because he is ridiculing great lords and kings.
This was a dangerous thing to do. Sumerian kings were worshiped as living gods,
so they didn't like it when they were ridiculed, not in the least bit. Look at what happens
to the shepherd brother when he mocks Lu-mah for wanting to be worshiped as a god.
The scribe knew that he could be flogged or even executed for writing this story,
so he didn't want anyone to read this tablet and then report him to the authorities (see
The Scribe on this website).
On the one hand, he didn't want anyone to read the tablet, but on the other hand, he did.
He had written this really great story, so of course he wanted someone to read it.
That is why he doesn't make the tablet completely unreadable. To make it unreadable
would be easy enough to do because Sumerian writing is barely readable to begin with.
He could simply substitute a bunch of signs for other signs, and only he would know
their intended meaning, or he could easily make up his own signs. Instead, he writes
the story in a way that makes it incomprehensible to a casual reader, but he provides
all of the necessary clues for a diligent reader to eventually decode the tablet.
With "Lu-mah", the scribe: 1) gives the bull a name, 2) names him for his character,
3) obscures his identity, and 4) gives a hint to the tablet's true context. In addition,
it's a wry comment on the fat bull's waistline (mah also means "to be or make large").
It has to be the greatest name ever given to a fictional character.
The pronunciation of the Sumerian "ḫ" not withstanding, in this particular translation
the Anglicized pronunciation of Lu-mah is the preferred form. "Maḫ" is pronounced
the way it's spelled in English (it rhymes with "ah"). In this way, one isn't required
to pronounce the word with a Sumerian accent.
In the translation, I added the word "lord" because it's implied in "Lu-mah". For notes
on hi-li, see line o4.
An experienced Sumerologist might have already noticed that the sign for bull (gu4)
is "miswritten" here at the beginning of the tablet where the reader would be looking
Transliteration of The Great Fatted Bull about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/9801/index.html
7 of 29 8/18/2020, 5:41 PM



for the context of the story. The bull is the second hidden context of this tablet.
For notes on gu4, see line o6.
The scribe uses numerous other ways to obscure the meaning of the text, all of which
are explained below, and a summary is given in Appendix A at the end of this page.
o4. ba ḫi-li nam-a-a ḫe2 kaš4/de6 nam-[...]
Allotment abundant fatherhood may (he/it) messenger/bring
Because of the missing portion of this line, it's impossible to tell if the Great Fatted Bull
is the "gift of fatherhood" (as a son) or if the gift is bestowed upon him (as the father).
I believe the line announces the birth of Lu-mah, the son, because he seems to grow up
and develop into manhood during the course of events, and because the story seems to
cover his entire lifespan until his retirement ("out to pasture").
The line is written simply as "May (he/it)" but it is tranlated as "May the fatted bull...".
This is justified by the fact that he is called a bull in the previous sentence and
he's called "great fatted" in the next, and by the necessity of having to introduce
the two contexts (bull and king) early in the story. I did this to compensate for the fact
that the scribe deliberately obscured both of the contexts, and to compensate for
the missing opening lines of the tablet. Otherwise the beginning of the story would be
confusing for the reader.
Hi-li can mean "beautiful" or "sexy" or "luxuriant" (abundant). Clearly, in this story,
the Great Fatted Bull isn't being called beautiful or sexy, he is being called abundant
(repeatedly).
o5. gal-niga {in}-kal gal-niga-a lu2-ḫuĝ-ga2 dib2 [...]
Great-fatted treasured. Great-fatted-to man-hired (worker) send
The unusual syntax of this sentence illustrates why this tablet was such a difficult
translation. Gal-niga, "great fatted", is an adjective, so it should always be attached
Transliteration of The Great Fatted Bull about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/9801/index.html
8 of 29 8/18/2020, 5:41 PM



to a noun (e.g., great fatted bull, great fatted sheep, etc.). Gal-niga occurs twice in this
sentence, but it isn't attached to anything. It just hovers there. Since it occurs at the
beginning of both sentences where the subject/noun of the sentences should be,
it is used as if it were a proper noun, and not as an adjective. Gal Niga is meant to be
the mock "lordly address" for the Great Fatted Bull. Some readers may object to my
translating it as "Great Fatso" because fatso is a modern term. I translated it this way
for several reasons. First of all, "fatso" is a noun (for instance, a woman isn't called
a "great beautiful" (adjective), she is called a "great beauty" (noun)). Second, and
more importantly, I am willing to bet that gal-niga was indeed the word for fatso in the
Sumerian language, which was deeply rooted in agriculture and animal husbandry.
So if the Sumerians wanted to call someone a "big fatso", they would call him gal-niga,
like an enormous fatted bull that lumbers in the pasture. "Great Fatso" also conveys the
obvious sarcastic tone of the scribe (you can hear it in his voice). I would suggest that
anyone who thinks niga should be limited to "fatted" (Lord Fatted, or The Great Fatted)
for some purely pedantic reason, is simply being too literal. I believe that within the
context of the sentences, "fatso" (Lord Fatso, The Great Fatso) is exactly the way
the scribe would say it if he were reading this tablet to a modern American audience.
This tablet was never meant to be read, it was meant only to be recited by the scribe,
so it should be spoken in the language of the listener. There are different words for fatso
in different languages, but they mean the same thing.
If dib2 is dab5 (the same sign, but with different meanings and pronunciations) the line
could be interpreted as "the workmen sieze", suggesting conscript labor. Because of
the missing portion of the line it's impossible to know which of the meanings apply.
For additional notes on dib2/dab5, see line r5.
o6. gu3 gu4!-še3 de6 ba ša3-gal gu4!-še3 nin [x] dib2
Voice (bellow) bull-to bring allotment food/fodder, bull-to lady [x] send
Ba = allotment/rations; see line o9 below.
A missing mark on a sign could mean everything – or it could mean nothing. It can
actually change the definition of the sign, or maybe it's just a scribal error, a "typo".
Like in English, if you don't cross the "t" in the word "take", it becomes the word "lake".
Here, and in lines o3 and r7, the sign for bull (gu4) is shown without the vertical stroke.

It is written correctly at the end of line o8. As written, the sign could be interpreted as
2(eše3) or the Old Babylonian version of bi. The sign 2(eše3) is two units of measure
and it's meaningless in the context of the sentences. The Old Babylonian version of bi
is a sign that's been stripped of most of its identifying structure, as part of the process
of simplifying the signs. It didn't appear until very late in the Old Babylonian period
(or as I call it, Severe Babylonian) when lots of other signs were simplified almost
beyond recognition, which is not the case on this tablet. I doubt that it's a scribal error.
I believe it's a deliberate effort to obscure the meaning of the text. I call the sign
"the half hidden bull" because it looks like a bull hiding in the writing of the text,
with just his horns showing, as a hint to the context of the tablet:
Gu4, "bull", normal: It looks like a bull's head.
compressed: The large triangle is replaced by two smaller triangles
(reverse cunei) facing in the opposite direction, and the vertical line is moved into the horn
area.
as written: In the crowded lettering of the tablet, this looks like a bull
"hiding" in the writing of the text, with just his horns showing.
In any case, gu4 fits perfectfly within the context of the sentences. In this sentence
especially (voice + bull + repetitive processing = the bellowing of a bull, SL page 89),
the meaning of the sign is clear. The sign occurs twice in the sentence, in an obvious
bull context, so it would be a natural place to obscure the appearance of the sign.
It's interesting to note that the one place where the sign is written correctly (line o8)
is where it is written the smallest. It's a tiny little sign, written in its compressed form,
that is placed in a crowded margin on the side of the tablet. It is therefore inconspicuous
and difficult to read. It cannot be seen when looking at the front or the back of the tablet,
and it can only be read when the tablet is being held edgewise. See line o8 below
for instructions on how to find the sign on the original tablet.
Bull? What bull?
Gu4 (bull) is one half of the context of the story, and yet it's miswritten four times
out of five. Which seems rather odd. Of the 362 complicated signs on the tablet, this
very simple sign is the only one that is consistently "misspelled". It's unlikely that
Transliteration of The Great Fatted Bull about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/9801/index.html
10 of 29 8/18/2020, 5:41 PM



the scribe, who is clearly an accomplished writer, would make such a stupid mistake
(even an amateur writer like me wouldn't make such a rookie mistake). I am certain
that the scribe did it intentionally, in a devious effort to obscure the meaning of the text.
He clearly did it to make the tablet difficult to read, and in this regard it worked exactly
as planned: Early in the translation I saw that gu4 was written correctly in line o8
so I knew that a bull was at least mentioned on the tablet, but I didn't believe it was
the subject of the story because the bull is never mentioned again. It's as though
I caught a brief glimpse of a bull and then he disappeared. Even after I began to suspect
that the bull may actually be a character in the story (because of the many references
to grain that I was seeing), I still resisted the idea because nowhere else on the tablet
is the sign for bull clearly written. I thought that maybe the other four signs might
possibly be gu4 (miswritten, the bull "hidden" in the writing of the text) but I couldn't
be sure. So I ended up wasting a lot of time trying decipher the bull context of the story,
which should have been rather obvious – if the signs were written correctly. I swear,
it was just like playing a Sumerian version of the game, "Where's Waldo?"
I've gone on about this at some length to demonstrate the kind of challenges that must
be overcome to translate this tablet. Gu4, pronounced "gud", is one of the simplest
of the Sumerian signs. It remained virtually unchanged for 2,000 years, since its earliest
pictograph form (it looks like a bull's head). Then it gets compressed, then miswritten.
It's supposed to be one of the "easy" signs.
Tablet #36 is the only known tablet in the world that has two simultaneous contexts
(bull and king) and both of the contexts are deliberately disguised! Tablet #36
has to be one of the most challenging tablets ever written, but notice how the scribe
doesn't attempt to make the tablet completely unreadable. That would be too easy.
Instead, he provides the necessary clues to solve both of the mysteries that he created.
The clue to the hidden king context is the repeated use of the sign mahX. The clue
to the hidden bull context is that the simple sign for bull is written correctly only once
(and very inconspicuously). It really is rather clever.
In my opinion, this scribe is clearly the best writer in all of Sumerian literature.
o7. na-aĝ2 (ES, nam) -ḫi-li -ĝu10 eš3-maḫX ĝa2-ĝa2-ĝa2 an

In the translation, I added the words "Lu-mah declares". On this tablet, dialogue is not
introduced with phrases like "he said" or "she said". Nor did the Sumerian language
have any helpful devices that separated the spoken word from the rest of the story
(such as commas, quotation marks, and capital letters). The resultant effect can be
very disconcerting: you're reading along, and before you know it, someone is talking.
So I therefore added to the text several introductions to the spoken word (e.g., line r11:
"His mother says") which is sometimes necessary when translating Sumerian. I did not
enclose these additions in brackets, for example, [His mother says], to delineate
my words from those of the author, which is the proper form, because it is too intrusive
and it interferes with the narrative flow.
The sign mu/ĝu10, "he/my", is written with only two pairs of reverse cunei instead of
the usual three. I was able to find several other examples on the CDLI where the sign
is written in this way. The horizontal stroke of the sign is very short (to save space)
and any attempt to crowd all three pairs of reverse cunei onto such a short sign
would make it almost illegible.
Eš3-mahX (shrine-great) may be a reference to the Majestic Shrine in the city of
Nippur, or it may be just a generic term for a "great shrine". Perhaps a shrine is actually
being built by the workers mentioned in line o5. The main reason "Majestic Shrine"
is capitalized in the translation is to convey some of the obvious hyperbole of the
sentence. The name "Majestic Shrine" was chosen rather than "Magnificent Shrine"
(its usual title) because Lu-mah is more "majestic" than he is "magnificent".
ĝa2-ĝa2-ĝa2 = ĝar-ĝar-ĝar = "to accumulate". A (non-numeric) Sumerian sign is
seldom written three times in a row. It happens, but it's relatively rare. It happens three
different times on this tablet. Here it is used as deliberate exaggeration (hyperbole).
The scribe could have witten the sign once, or even twice, and it would have meant
the same thing (to accumulate). Instead, he writes it three times – this from someone
who otherwise uses a great economy of language.
The strings of three signs in-a-row, and the fact that it seems like half of the other signs
are "doubled up" (usually to indicate plural) is another reason why this tablet is such
a difficult translation. The writing looks wild on the page. Visually, it looks out of control;
it looks like "gibberish". Like the next line:

o8. iri niĝin2 kar niĝin2 gur4-gur4-a kur9-kur9
Village make the rounds marketplace wander feel big/important(2x)-in enter (plural)
gana2-5 zal {in}-kur9 maḫX-šu-gu4 si
Field-5 pass, enters. Great-hand-bull fill
The above sentence has an unusual syntax and there is quite a lot of information
packed into a single line of text.
This is the one place on the tablet where gu4 (bull) is written correctly. Note how small
it is, and notice how inconspicuous it is on the orignal tablet (it's on the second line
just under the damaged area on the right edge).
Can't find it? Here it is.
Plural: On this tablet, plural is denoted by writing a sign twice, sometimes the noun,
sometimes the verb (the usual form). Writing the verb twice makes the noun plural.
For instance, "marketplace. . . enter enter" makes the noun (marketplace) plural.
In the next sentence, the noun is pluralized; "wife wife" means "many wives". However,
just because a sign is written twice doesn't automatically make it plural. Sometimes
it's just the way a word is spelled; for instance, ga-ga means "cream". Sometimes
it's used for emphasis, an example of which can also be found in this sentence:
gur4 by itself means "to feel important", written twice it means "to feel very important".
There's also a "reduplication class" of words, where writing a sign twice can actually
change its meaning. In line o16, du8-du8 (duḫ-duḫ) means "grain mash", but in
line r15, du8-du8 (reduplication class) means "to amass", whereas in line o14
du8 by itself means "to yoke". It's enough to make your head spin.
There's the possibility that Lu-mah's village may actually be a larger city because
iri = village/town/city, suggesting that he is bullying a much smaller village.
Village(s): should be translated as plural because kur9 (enter) is written twice,
meaning plural. And if village(s) is plural, then marketplace(s) should also be plural.
They are, however, translated as singular in the English rendition because too many
esses in the sentences made them sound too sibilant.
Number five: see note for line o17.
Again, the same sign three times in-a-row (niĝin2 and gur4 are the same sign, LAGAB)
here used for multiple meanings (rounds, wander) and for emphasis (feel big (twice)).

Two of the three same signs have different meanings (wander, feel big) even though
they are written side-by-side and visually they are exactly alike. Four of the first six
characters on this line are the same sign (followed by another sign, kur9, doubled!).
The scribe does something similar in line r15.
Here, and in lines o11, r10, and r11, mahX (AL) is written in a compressed form.
This is described in greater detail in line o11.
Despite the wild appearance of the writing on the tablet, this is a writer who has a
complete command of the language, a very difficult language at that. The tablet may
look like it's gibberish, like it's a "tale told by an idiot", but it's written by a genius.
Sometimes it seems like he is just showing off.
o9. gana2 ba e-ne-eĝ3 (ES, inim) ne ḫenbur2 tuku dam-dam-da ni2-{da}-pap
Field allotment decree this henbur to take wife (plural)-with self-virile
Here, and in o4 and o6, ba (allotment) is translated as "gift". It is written in its Emesal
form, aĝ2-ba (lemma=niĝ2-ba, label=gift) in r7. "Allotment" is more meaningful in the
Sumerian context, given the practice of allotting food rations and parcels of land, etc;
but it sounds very awkward in the English translation ("an abundant allotment"),
and it requires explanatory comment. "Gift" has a similar context in English,
it scans better, it ties in with line r7 ("Here's a gift... "), and it doesn't require additional
commentary. This translation is meant to have a "stand alone" quality, with a
minimum amount of explication, so that the story can be appreciated on its own merit
with the least interruption to the narrative flow.
In the translation, I sometimes use contractions; e.g., "I'll take. . ." , for "I will take. . .".
This is a modern convention, the Sumerians didn't use contractions. On a similar note,
I often use italics in the translation. Needless to say, the Sumerians didn't use italics.
These signs were complicated enough to begin with. If they also had to be italicized,
the Sumerian scribes would suffer a collective nervous breakdown.

henbur2 (grain)
The scribe uses the IN cluster of reverse cunei for the sign henbur2. It should have
the še (grain) cluster, but then again, the scribe uses eight different versions of še
in signs like zid, li, gal-niga, kur9, etc. As written, henbur2 looks a lot like IN, but with
only one vertical stroke. Of course it could be three scribal errors, but it seems unlikely
that the scribe would mistakenly write IN this way in the exact three places where
henbur2 fits perfectly into the context of the sentences. Henbur is one of the numerous
themes of the story. This is yet another way that the scribe obscures the meaning
of the text, yet another clever way that he fakes the reader out of position.

[labor]-my mother with-self support
o11. [...x]-a da bi iri maḫX inim- lu2-ne mu du3 {in!}-kur9
. . . village. Huge word- dispute he all enters
mahX
It seems there is a progression of AL (mahX) from the archaic version with a curved line
to the final compressed version. The fourth sign from the left, which seems to be a
semi-compressed version of mahX, could be interpreted as u5, and the final
fully compressed version looks a lot like ra/rah2. However, I believe they are all mahX
because the word "great" fits seemlessly into all of the sentences where they appear.
On the other hand, none of the definitions of ra/rah2 fit into any of the sentences.
AL doesn't have a compressed form, so the scribe simply made up his own version.
It is just another one of his tricks to conceal the meaning of the text.

Another reason I don't think the sign is ra occurs in line r11. A = "to", ra ="to", and
še3 = "to". That's three "to"s in a row. Ra is obviously being used for another purpose.
o12. [...] [?] ĝen gir10 en

The damaged sign designated "[?]" at the beginning of the readable portion of the line

Multiple meanings for AŠTE2: chair/throne, trough, reed-bed, etc.
Although there are many intriguing possibilities for this line, I translated it simply as:
"[Lord (?)] [x-x] [something, something]" to indicate the damage on the tablet
and to convey the feel of a fight or argument, without speculating on its contents,
which cannot be known for certain because of the missing portion of the line.

Šu. . . a, "hand. . . in": This is a Sumerian convention that means the subject
wriiten between the two signs is "in hand", meaning "held" or "carried", or in this case,

"captive".
Šeš by itself means "brother". Šeš-na means "brother-man", meaning a male relative.
It is translated as "kinsmen" (plural) because it's assumed the father is also present
since in the next line it seems that Lu-mah is speaking in the presence of the father.
Because the last word before the big argument in line o11 is "village", it's possible
that Lu-mah took all of the villagers captive, of which only the owners of Grain Field #5
are characters in the story.
geme2 = a female servant or slave
What's different about the way the scribe writes this sign is that he uses only two
reverse cunei instead of the usual three. Surprising, the only place that he uses all three
reverse cunei is in line r6, where the sign is not only compressed but actually squashed
in the crowded lettering of the line (above right). As written, the sign could be interpreted
as gu (cord). Although gu is usually written with two vertical lines on the left, it is
sometimes written with only one. However, gu is meaningless in the context of the
sentence, but geme2 fits in all five instances in the three sentences where it appears
and it's one of the 17 minor themes of the story. The signs are disguised to help obscure
the meaning of the story. Geme2 is written correctly only where it's written the smallest,
just like gu4 in line o8, as a hint to its true meaning. If the signs for slave women were
clearly written on the tablet, then everyone would be interested in reading their story
(any story about slave women is bound to be interesting) but the scribe
doesn't want anyone to be interested in reading this tablet. The sign is written
the same way in the stories of The Princess Wife and The Great Fatted Jackass,
and for the same reason: to obscure the meaning of the texts. I call the sign gemeX.

I 5-pasture sell- make. Me-to grain heap (plural) give
The ePSD shows one instance (without citation) where gur11 (GA) is used as an
alternative sign for guru7 (grain heap). I didn't use ga for sheep's milk, or ga-ga
(garX) for cream, because the bull has not heretofore expressed any interest in milk.
He is, however, interested in grain, and the grain heaps will be added to the
"mountain of grain" mentioned in line r12.
i=5
The first sign on the left is i, likewise for the second sign. It is a commonly used sign,
but it's not a number, it's a word, one that has no meaning that fits into the context of
the three sentences where it appears. That's because the scribe uses it to represent
the number five. 5(aš), which is written horizontally (unlike the vertical diš format,
uses a 3-2 combination, as seen in the third sign. On Tablet #36, the scribe uses a
2-2-1 combination to represent the number 5. In a line of text, the sign would naturally
be interpeted as i, which is meaningless in the context of the sentence, causing
some confusion, which helps to obscure the context of the tablet. On the other hand,
the "five" interpretation of the sign fits in all three sentences where it appears: field 5,
pasture 5, and 5 big bowls.
o18. [x]-da-am3 su-ba (ES, sipad) šeš

su-ba = su8-ba. A pun like lu2-mahX, and also the name of the hero. One other
example attested, A Praise Poem for Shulgi X (ETCSL). Even if there was no other
example, it would still be su-ba, "shepherd". I believe that Lu-mah and Su-ba are
the names of the protagonists, even though they are not so-named anywhere else
in the text. It's more than a coincidence that these are the only places on the tablet
where the scribe puns at the sign level.
Sipad, the usual sign for "shepherd".

Su8-ba: This is the lesser known Emesal form of sipad, "shepherd". It is one of the
"stacked" Sumerian signs. The lines of a tablet usually had to be drawn wider than normal
in order to accommodate it. To try to write this sign within the narrow lines of Tablet #36
would make it illegible. The scribe, who uses every square millimeter of this tablet, wouldn't
draw an entire line wider just to fit a single word. Nor would he want to call attention to this
very distinctive sign.
Su-ba, as written. It is pronounced like the above su8-ba, but it's
unrecognizable as a "shepherd".
Su-ba shesh, the shepherd brother.
Su-ba is just a comman man, who is a shepherd in disguise, and the shepherd is the disguise
of a king. He is named for his role in the story, and yet his identity is concealed. It has to be
the second greatest name ever given to a fictional character.
Reverse:

Cylinder seal impression. Note the "bull/man" on the left. This character is often ascribed
to be Enkidu, the companion of Gilgamesh, the Sumerian warrior-king seen on the right. I
have my doubts, as Enkidu was a man who was raised by animals, but not a hybrid bull/man.
See another image of Gilgamesh and Enkidu with Enkidu portrayed as a regular man.

The first part of the sentence seems to be missing a negation (nu): "I will not bow. . . "
Perhaps it was on the damaged part of the tablet at the beginning of the line, or maybe
it was explained in the damaged portion of the previous line (o18).

teš2 = pride/all. I originally had this phrase translated as "seize pride, not wisdom",
but I now believe that "seize all (everything), not wisdom" better fits the context of
Lu-mah's overwhelming greed.
r2. ki-ma an zi-ir lu2-da [gu3#] ir-ir
Earth heaven feel troubled man-with [voice/cry out] plunder
The usual format of zi-ir is Zi ... ir, where the subject that "feels troubled" is written
between the two signs. Zi-ir by itself means affliction or grief. Given the similarites
of the definitions, I chose "feel troubled" because it is a verb.
Gu3 ="voice/cry out", interpreted as "bellow", which is the usual form of gu3 when it is
used in the context of a bull. The bull context of the story has already been established.
This line, "... man bellows for plunder", highlights Lu-mah's dual nature of man and bull,
just like line o8, "... to fill his great bull hands".
r3. ti- ze2-ed (ES, tud2) murgu2- ze2-ed (ES, tud2) ud-da-am3 {ba}-zig3 en gir10
Rib- beat back/shoulders- beat. Storm-like arose lord anger
Ti is interpreted as "rib", without the uzu "body" prefix. It occurs without this prefix
in all 16 examples on the ETCSL.
r4. šaḫ2 ka-a gu7 gu7 šaḫ2 zi2 utul2-5
Pig mouth-in food. Fodder pig cut tureen/large bowl-5
ka-a šu du3 eš2-la2-a
mouth-in hand to drive in, choke-in/on
Gu7 = food/fodder. When the signs for "mouth" and "food" are used together, it means
"to eat" (even though gu7 by itself can also mean "to eat, consume"). See also r5
and r10.
Eš2-la2 (verb) = constrict/throttle/suffocate = choke.
Eš2-la2 (noun) minus the ĝeš "wood" prefix = bucket. I didn't use this interpretation
because Lu-mah is using his hands to eat, not buckets.

r5. da-ĝu10 lu ka/gu3 aĝ2-(ES, niĝ2)-gu7-gu7 šu-da-ni? dab5-ba
Side (flank)-my to make abundant mouth/bellow food (plural) hand-with-his grasp
Niĝ2-gu7, "thing-to eat", is another Sumerian way of saying "food".
There are multiple interpretations for this line, all of which yield translations that are
essentially the same. Ka is translated as gu3 "to cry out" ("My flanks... ", he cries out)
which is interpreted as "bellow" in the bull context of the story, as explained in line r2.
If ka is used as "mouth", it applies to the food, meaning "to eat", like in sentences r4
and r10. Dab5-ba can be translated as "collected" ("that his hands collected") referring
back to o8: "to fill his great bull hands". Dab5-ba could also be dib2-ba "passing"
("with his hands passing the food to his mouth"). This confirms my own personal theory
that all Sumerian signs are "dibs and dabs". They can mean one thing, or another, or
their opposites:
dib2: To send.
dab5: To seize. In other words, the opposite of dib2.
Naturally, the sign is used both ways on this tablet. It's one of the "joys" of translating
ancient Sumerian; but I digress. . .
Lu, translated as "abundant", is like ĝa2 (ĝar) in line o7 and du8 (reduplicated)
in line r15, all of which mean "to accumulate" (to heap, amass, pile up, add, multiply,
to make abundant, etc.). The scribe uses these verbs as a way of saying "to grow fat"
to reinforce his theme that the Lu-mah's fatness is a symbol of his greed (see line o7
in the Annotations). It also makes the tablet more difficult to read because the signs
are being used in an unexpected manner.

r7. aĝ2-ba (ES, niĝ2-ba) gu4! eš gu3 [maḫX#]-sig3 gin6
Gift bull anoint bellow great-burning indigestion permanent
To get some idea of the difficulty in translating this tablet, notice how the scribe
writes GI and ZI the same way, except for a very minor difference.
GI
For GI, there is some separation between the two lower strokes and the upper cluster.
ZI
For ZI, the lower strokes and the upper cluster are merged together.
It's common for GI to be written this way, but never ZI, because it would be too easily
mistaken for GI. The cluster of reverse cunei for zi is essentially the ŠE (grain) sign.
Še (or niga, "fatted") is often used in a compressed form, including the one shown in zi.
As illustrated by a couple of administrative tablets from the CDLI, other scribes were
careful not to use the compressed še cluster for zi so that it wouldn't be confused for gi.
This scribe, however, does it just to mess with your head. He also uses every variation
for the še cluster form that he can think of. Click here for some examples. But he
gives a hint to his intentions by writing the še cluster for zi in the exact same way
that he writes the še cluster for niga in line r11 below.
r8. kiri3 kiri3 na-la-ba-ni-[ur#] la2-la2-{e} en#
Nose nose man-not-his-[servant] (enemy) throttle (plural) lord
The line is translated as ". . . throttle each other" because the sign for "throttle" is
written twice, indicating plural. As can be seen above, the two signs for "throttle"
are written between the signs for "enemy" and "lord". If it were only the enemy
who was doing the throttling, it would be written in a subject-object-verb sequence:
enemy lord throttle. The phrase "nose to nose" also suggests a reciprocal battle,
like "toe to toe" and "man to man".
When I first started translating this tablet, I saw the sign la2 and thought, "Wouldn't it

be funny if someone was actually being throttled?" It's such a cartoonish word, throttle.
But I thought it unlikely that the sign was being used this way. I was sure that one of
the many other definitions of la2 was the one being used because there aren't any
examples in Sumerian literature of someone being throttled. Until now.
Note: As it turns out, I found two other stories where someone is being throttled.
See The Princess Wife and The Great Fatted Jackass on this website.

Grain-fodder abandon (a claim) this great/all food-mouth (eating) to diminish
When I originally translated this line, I supplied the personal pronouns ("I will abandon/
I will not eat") which is standard procedure in translating Sumerian. But it seemed odd
that the scribe, who is usually pretty good about keeping up with his personal pronouns,
doesn't include a single one in this sentence. It must be remembered that Lu-mah is
being strangled when he says these words. In the above line, he manages to open
his mouth to speak. Although "to open the mouth" is a Sumerian convention meaning
"to say", nowhere else in the story does anyone deem it necessary to open their mouth
in order to speak, they just launch right into the spoken word. I therefore translated
this line to suggest the strangulated cries of the bull as he is being throttled.

Lines 12 and 13 are actually parts of the same line. The indentation of the second part

tuku/gur10: I call it gur10 (KIN) because of the horizontal line at the top, which tuku
does not have in line o9. The horizontal line is used on kiĝ2 (KIN) in line r16 (see below)
but that one also includes the reverse cunei used to distinguish the sign. In any case,
it doesn't appreciably change the meaning of the text because tuku = get, gur10 = reap,

I translated munus-ĝal2, woman-available, as ““unmarried woman” because the
grain fields seem to be some kind of dowry offering, even though this definition
doesn't occur in the ePSD, the ETCSL, or the Sumerian Lexicon. However, munus-ĝal2
also appears in line r9 of The Great Fatted Jackass. In the context of the sentence,
it likewise means an unmarried woman. I therefore suggest that munus-ĝal2 is the
Sumerian word for a single woman, a bachelorette, if you will.

written elsewhere in the drawing, but these lines can be seen on the original tablet.
I added the word "again" to the phrase "he grows fat again". In the above line,
"stomach know great tight/reduced" is interpreted to mean "hunger", in the same way
that "mouth" and "food" together means "to eat". But it also suggests a comical
reduction in the bull's waistline, to contrast with line r5 where he grows visibly fatter
during the feast. By adding the word "again", both bases are covered.
Left: 4 (diš), which represents the number 4. Center: The sign ninda, which means
"food". It starts out as a pictograph of a bowl. Over time, it becomes more abstract
and simplified until it eventually resembles the number four. Ninda is the same sign
as ĝar, meaning "to place", which is the way it is used at the end of r11 above.
Right: 4 (diš), as written on this line. The scribe has been working the "5" angle
throughout the story (Grain Field #5, Pasture #5, and five big bowls of mash. . . ).
It has all been leading up to this: "Grain Field #4!"
On a literary tablet which thus far has no numbers (the number 5 has previously been
disguised as i), it would be logical to read this sign as a word, as ĝar or niĝ2. It is
actually the number 4(diš). See a tablet that has niĝ2 and 4(diš) written side by side.
The scribe puns with numbers for the same reason that he puns with words,
to obscure the meaning of the text.
r16. lu2 kiĝ2 du ak [lug] mu ĝen du7-lum [x]

In Sumerian literature, you never get to hear about a woman who is not virtuous. The
ETCSL shows 47 entries for munus zid: woman right (and true). There are zero entries
for munus nu-zid, woman not-right (or true).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Appendix A: Summary of the different ways the meaning of the text is obscured:
1) The mahX encoding of the tablet hides the main context of the story (lugal, king).
Technical Note: Of 3,271 citations, the ePSD gives one instance where mah2 is used as
an alternative sign for mah; and the instance is archaic (500 - 1,000 years before this tablet
was written) so it hardly counts. It may even be a scribal error, ancient or modern. The fact
that mah2 is used as an alternative sign for mah only once in 2,000 years is somewhat
surprising. The Sumerian language was syllabic, based on syllables, rather than individual
sounds (letters), like English. If a scribe didn't know the sign for a particular word, he would
"spell it out" using signs for the syllables that he already knew. In this way, signs with the
same (or similar) pronunciations were often used interchangeably, so one would expect that
mah was used more often as an alternative sign for mah2, and vice versa (the PSD shows
1,000 citations for mah2 (cow) and none where mah is used as an alternative sign.) The
reason these two signs were not used interchangeably is because they were both well-known
signs with two very different definitions (mah=great, supreme, majestic; mah2=cow) that were
not easily confused for each other. The numbers, 3,270 to 1, indicate just how unlikely it is
that the sign mah2 would be given the meaning of mah, "great". To write mah2 for mah once
could be a scribal error (a typo), but the sign is used consistently eight different times on this
tablet. It was not done out of ignorance, by someone who didn't know any better, because the
Transliteration of The Great Fatted Bull about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/9801/index.html

scribe is clearly a master of the language and he would not make such a careless mistake.
Nor is it just wordplay like Su-ba (shepherd) because the scribe does not alter the meanings
of su and ba in the rest of the story as he does with mah(2), and he would not be so heavy
handed with one single pun. So, if it's not a scribal error and it's not wordplay, then it must be
"encoding", a deliberate attempt to obscure the meaning of the text. I would suggest that the
one sign (mahX) is the main reason why this tablet couldn't be translated by the experts,
even though a modern Sumerologist can translate anything written in the Sumerian language.
I would further suggest that this one sign would also make the tablet difficult to read even for
another Sumerian, and for the exact same reason. Even if the sign is initially given the
pronuniciation of mah, it would be assumed it's the usual mah2 (cow) and not mah (great).
Since "cow" doesn't make any sense in any of the sentences, the pronunciation would
be discarded, and along with it, the hint to the secret context of the tablet (i.e.; Lu-mah =
man great = lugal = king). It's a very clever bit of encoding that allows the scribe to obscure
the context of the story, making it difficult to read the other signs on the tablet, even though
they are written in "plain Sumerian".
2) Both Lu-mah and Su-ba, the two main protagonists of the story, are written as puns at the
sign level, concealing their identities.
3) The very simple sign for bull, one half of the context, is "miswritten" four times out of five.
4) The setting of the story, Field #5, is written three different ways: field 5, the usual form,
with the number following after the noun; 5 pasture, with the number written first; and field 4
(4 diš,), written as a different number form so that it looks like the word ĝar. The number five
is also distinctive, written to look like the word i, with a 2 2 1 combination, rather than the
usual 3 2 combination. This is because the scribe puns with numbers for the same reason
that he puns with words, to obscure the meaning of the text.
As can be seen from the above four notes: the two contexts, the two main protagonists,
and the setting of the story – all are disquised in some way. It's difficult to read a story when
you don't know what it's about, or who it's about, or where it's taking place.
5) In addition to the king being obscured, two other important words, "fate" and "shepherd",
are used in their in their lesser known Emesal forms, na-aĝ2 and su8-ba. The ePSD shows
532 instances for nam, the usual word for fate, and 20 for na-aĝ2. (The scribe only uses nam
in it's prefix form (i.e., as part of the word "fatherhood", nam-a-a)). There are 2,415 cases of
sipad for shepherd, and only 25 for su8-ba. Although the Emesal words are readable enough,
they are not immediately recognizable like the signs nam and sipad. So why doesn't the
scribe use the standard signs for nam, lugal, and sipad? Because once he uses the signs
for fate, kings, and shepherds on a tablet, then people would be interested in reading it and
they'd be able to figure out the true meaning of the story. The tablet would no longer be so
"inconspicuous". The same applies to modern times. I would suggest that had the scribe
used these three signs, this tablet never would have been classified as "Administrative",
rather than "Literature", and someone else would have translated it long before I ever saw it
(translating it would have been easy enough to do since the context would be known). This
tablet has been hiding in plain sight ever since it was written, all because the scribe did not use
those three signs.
6) Another important sign, geme2 slave woman, is disguised by using only two reverse cunei
instead of the usual three, so that it looks like gu "cord". People would be interested in reading
Transliteration of The Great Fatted Bull about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/9801/index.html
27 of 29 8/18/2020, 5:41 PM



about slave women, but not cord.
7) Other signs are disguised to make them difficult to read. For example, the sign for henbur
is written with the IN cluster of reverse cunei rather than the še (grain) cluster. The sign for GI
is written to look (almost) like ZI,
8) Verbs that mean "to accumulate", which the scribe uses as a way of saying "to grow fat",
symbolizing Lu-mah's greed, are very intrusive and they make the tablet difficult to read
because they are being used in an unexpected manner.
9) The double-line rulings do not separate major divisions in the story, They are merely used
to make the tablet look like a nondescript administration record. That is why it was originally
classified this way by the CDLI.
10) The frequent Emesal words are not necessary. They are thrown in simply to keep the
reader off balance.
11) The writing often has an unusual syntax. It is not always structured in the usual "Subject
Object Verb" sequence of formal writing. This wasn't done to obscure the meaning of the text;
it's the result of the scribe's effort to crowd as much information as possible into every line,
but it nonetheless makes the tablet difficult to read. Another unusual aspect of this tablet is
the fact that almost every sign is a word, not just part of a multi-sign word, or a syllable in a
longer word, but a whole word by itself.
12) The strings of three signs in-a-row, and the doubling of many of the others, makes the
writing look nonsensical. Some of this is inevitable in Sumerian, where a few signs represent
many words, but this tablet seems to have it in excess.
13) There are very few clarifying "grammar particles" on this tablet. If the scribe wanted to
make the tablet more readable, he could have easily done so by adding some identifying
prefixes and suffixes.
Any one of these factors, by itself, does not make the tablet unreadable; but all of them
together make the tablet difficult (if not impossible) to read, even for another Sumerian,
until mahX is decoded.
Note on the translation:
For the record, I did not use a lot of literary license when translating this tablet, even though
it would have been perfectly justified, considering that it is such a “literary” story. I did the
transliteration (the Sumerian sign converted to the Sumerian word) according to strict CDLI
standards. For the translation, however, (the translation is the Sumerian word converted to the
English word) I allowed myself a little bit of latitude. Most of the literary license that I used is
quite obvious, e.g., “fatso”, the use of contractions (“here’s” for “here is”) and the use of italics.
Any other minor examples of poetic license that I used are denoted on this page. My criterion
was to give the words of the scribe their fullest meaning without adding my own meanings
(early in the translation I realized that nothing I could add to this great story would be an
improvement). Simply put, my sole concern when translating this tablet was, “How would the
scribe say it?” If he was standing in front of a modern American audience, how would he tell
the story to them? This story was never meant to read, it was only meant to be spoken, so it
should be spoken in the vernacular, the everyday language of the listeners. That's why the use
of italics and contractions is warranted for this tablet. I hope the scholars will forgive me for

Tablet #36 sign list
10-13 minutes
The purpose of this page is to provide citations to support the
transliteration of Tablet #36. As such, it will be quite dull for the general
reader, who is advised to skip it. This page is intended for anyone
interested in cuneiform studies who wishes to verify that my translation
of Tablet #36 is correct.
For the simple and obvious signs used on this tablet, I provide a picture of
the ePSD font, followed by an example from the tablet. For the
compressed signs (see some of the compressed signs on Tablet #36) or the
signs written in an unusual manner, I also provide an example (or two)
from other tablets on the CDLI. Click on the given line number to see a
drawing of the tablet, or click on the CDLI number to view the tablet’s
transliteration page.
All Sumerian signs have multiple meanings, but on this page I show only
the definitions that are used on the tablet. Unless otherwise stated, all of
the sign definitions can be found in the ePSD. All of them are also in the
Sumerian Lexicon (SL) and most of them are in the ETCSL, but finding a
definition in the ETCSL requires some expertise, and of course most
people don't own a copy of the Sumerian Lexicon (although it is absolutely
essential to anyone translating Sumerian into English because it has a
much higher word-count than the ePSD).

geme2 = slave woman P112882 o1 P112430 o3 What's different about
the way the scribe writes this sign is that he uses only two reverse cunei

reverse cunei is in line r6, where the sign is not only
compressed but actually squashed in the crowded lettering of the line (see

the tablet. Geme2 fits in all five instances in the three sentences where it

one that has no meaning that fits into the context of the three sentences
where it appears. That's because the scribe uses it to represent the number
five. 5(aš), which is written horizontally (unlike the vertical diš format
shown above), always uses a 3-2 combination, as seen in the third sign. On
Tablet #36, the scribe uses a 2-2-1 combination to represent the number 5.
In a line of text, the sign would naturally be interpeted as i, which is
meaningless in the context of the sentence, causing some confusion, which
helps to obscure the context of the tablet. On the other hand, the "five"
interpretation of the sign fits in all three sentences where it appears: field
5, pasture 5, and 5 big bowls.
