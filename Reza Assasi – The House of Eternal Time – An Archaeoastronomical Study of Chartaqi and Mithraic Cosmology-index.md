1 Abstract
This thesis studies the relationship between architecture and cosmology based on recent research
in the interdisciplinary field of Archaeoastronomy. The main objective of this study is to
understand the symbolic morphology of ancient Iranian structures called chartaqi. These
structures characteristically incorporate a dome built on a cross and are intentionally and
accurately aligned with particular astronomical references of the horizon.
Taking the recent discoveries of the astronomical alignments of chartaqi as a starting point led to
the discovery of identical astronomical alignments in similar Roman structures. These parallels
are shown in detail in this thesis. Based on an analysis of these alignments and an investigation
of Mithraic artefacts, the author argues that the concepts incorporated in chartaqi are based on
Mithraic cosmology. In order to support this argument, this thesis develops an original
framework to understand Iranian Mithra and the Roman mystery cult of Mithraism.



2 Résumé
L'objectif principal de cette recherche est d'étudier la relation entre l'architecture et la cosmologie
fondée sur des recherches récentes dans le champ interdisciplinaire de archeoastronomy. Dans
cette étude, le principal problème est de comprendre la morphologie symbolique d'une structure
ancienne iranienne appelle chartaqi dans lequel un dôme construit sur une croix et est
volontairement et avec précision à alligned notamment des références astronomiques de
l'horizon.
Prendre les découvertes récentes des allignments astronomiques de chartaqi comme point de
départ a conduit à la découverte des allignments astronomiques identiques dans les structures
romaines semblables qui est représenté en détail dans cette thèse. L'auteur soutient que les
concepts incorporés dans chartaqi est basé sur la cosmologie de Mithra et propose un cadre
d'origine pour comprendre la relation entre iranien Mithra et Roman culte de Mithra.

10 Chapter 1 Overture
Geh unter, schöne Sonne, sie achteten Nur wenig dein, sie kannten dich, Heilge, nicht. Denn mühelos und stille bist du Über den Mühsamen aufgegangen.
Mir gehst du freundlich unter und auf, o Licht! Und wohl erkennt mein Auge dich, herrliches! Denn göttlich stille ehren lernt ich, Da Diotima den Sinn mir heilte.
O du, des Himmels Botin, wie lauscht ich dir, Dir, Diotima! Liebe! wie sah von dir Zum goldnen Tage dieses Auge Glänzend und dankend empor. Da rauschten
Lebendiger die Quellen, es atmeten Der dunkeln Erde Blüten mich liebend an, Und lächelnd über Silberwolken Neigte sich segnend herab der Äther.
Go down, lovely sun, they paid little heed to you; they knew you not, holy one. For effortlessly and silently you rose over those who must work hard.
To me you are friendly, rising or setting, o Light, and indeed my eye recognizes you, magnificent one! for I learned divine, quiet respect when Diotima healed my mind.
O you messenger of Heaven, how I listened to you, to you, Diotima, love! How my eye gazed from you to the golden day, upward, gleaming and full of thanks. Then murmured
the springs more vitally, breathed the dark earth's blossoms lovingly on me, and smiling over silver clouds, the sky bowed down in blessing.1

Friedrich HölderlinΝwroteΝtheΝpoemΝ“GoΝdown, lovely sun”ΝinΝ1799.ΝTheΝacuteΝnostalgiaΝinΝhisΝ
poem would have sounded poignant in its own era, but today it seems to tell a simpler story. We
no longer remember the lovely sun as it appears in this poem. When we talk about love and the
sun, we know how to write and pronounce their names, but they no longer exist as symbols of
greater meaning in our language. In school, our children are taught about the sun only as an
energy source, like a nuclear plant, made of chemical elementsΝwrittenΝonΝtopΝofΝεendeleev’s
periodic table. That is why relating love to the sun now is incomprehensible.
Hölderlin’s sun went down forever some eighty years after this poem was written, in New York
city when Thomas Edison switched on electric lamps in one of the streets of Manhattan in
DecemberΝ1880.ΝItΝwouldΝhaveΝbeenΝalmostΝChristmasΝDayΝorΝcloseΝtoΝσewΝYear’sΝEve,ΝwhichΝ
both recall an ancient ritual for the divine sun. Every winter solstice people used to stand a vigil
in order to see the first winter sunrise, bringing life back to the earth, extending the length of the
days. That day, which had been the birthday of the sun, changed to the birthday of the lightbulbs
of Manhattan, a city which filled up with man-made mountains covered with electric stars and
blue reflective glass.
In fact, it was not technology which wiped out our divine world; instead, a change in the basic
way we think about the natural world lies beneath the emergence of our demystified world. Since
the Renaissance, and in particular since the Enlightenment, we have mathematized and
objectivized the sun, the earth, the sky, and whatever divine legacy we had. We now find
ourselves disconnected from the heavens and detached from nature. Nature has gradually come
to be regarded as a world apart from human affairs.



12 The reality of what we call architecture today includes discourse about stock markets,
financing, and management, which can seem to be not only related to the profession, but the only
vital issues in the field. In such an environment, talking poetically about the sun is a digression.
Nowadays, in north America, we need a symbol for the sun to be shown in our calculative
designs as a fashionable clean energy source, to be used to name our luxurious buildings
“green,” while we cover the sky by competing to reach the maximum height for raising
skyscrapers. Perhaps some fake images of the sun in a blue sky or the starry firmament can be
found in architectural drawings as an inanimate background for digital perspective images
images on the basis of which people buy buildings even before construction.
Talking about architecture in relation to love or the sun and sky requires a paradigm shift. This
shift does not mean returning to the ancient world, but instead that some of the rich meanings of
tradition sould be reclaimed for a new understanding of the world.
Ancient civilizations have formed our world of today. Myths, rituals, ethics, art, literature, and
all the complex matters which distinguish us from other creatures are elements of an
evolutionary cultural trend of thousands of years. History is more than a story of the past or just a
way to find answers for those who are curious about knowing what happened to their ancestors.
It is an ineradicable part of our present and future. Human beings connect themselves to the
world by dwelling on the earth. The history of architecture in particular, beyond its simplified
modern definition as a history of shelter- and tomb-building, reflects many facts and secrets of
our being as humans, and helps us to understand our modern identity along with our
achievements and mistakes.



13 The sky and the earth have always been dominant factors in myths. Myths do not belong to the
rational mind. They are not invented; they are found by the collective unconscious through
poetic and symbolic realizations and insights. They open the mind of people living in a particular
society to the mysterious dimension of being that cannot be analyzed; they present an image of
the cosmos that connects the transcendent to the world of everyday experience, and they present
a social order by which people can be coordinated to the mystery of being. The poetic images
that mythologies are composed of are only a symbolic mask to reflect human perception and the
unconscious experience of life that cannot be contextualized in rational thinking.
The very fundamental function of myth is completely forgotten in the modern world. This
neglect, which has led to the rational and demystified approach towards knowing the universe, is
implicitly intrinsic to the western tradition, with roots that seem to be found in major cultural and
historical shifts in both Greek and Judeo-Christian origins even centuries before the modern era
or the enlightenment.
In the Old Testament the archetypal symbols became interpreted as facts. Since then, God seems
to be an individual fact, not a symbol; heaven is not a concept, but a place; and with the Fall in
the Garden of Eden the human being was exiled from that holy place to nature. The mythical
primordial events, which take place in infinite space-time, become understood as parts of a linear
historical timeline, creating a pseudo-history composed of both historical and mythical events.
Greek mythology was also transformed from its original ritual symbols to a new form in which
consciousness was awakened towards myth. We cannot find any Greek myth in its ritual context.
Although this new way of understanding myths inspired epic poetry, tragedy, comedy, and
plastic arts, rewriting the myths also gave grounds for the taking over of the common



14 consciousness from absolute collective unconscious. The modern understanding of the word
“myth” as a synonym for “fiction” has roots in the similar interpretation of the word “mythos” in
Greek culture.
No wonder religion in the western tradition is based on faith, not religious experience – a real
experience of the perception of truth through rituals and symbolism. Although the mythical
functions were preserved or spontaneously reappeared in some forms of mysticism in western
traditions, including Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, they were not justified or generally
accepted inside the structure of these religions, and were commonly condemned as heresy by the
orthodox.
Architecture inarguably preserved the history of early civilizations in its solid body better than
any other material. Words might have been forgotten, books might have been burnt, but palaces
and temples were the last to be destroyed and were rarely wiped out without leaving any
footprints. Despite transformations over time, the morphology of architectural traditions passed
from generation to generation and from civilization to civilization while preserving their core
concepts.
This thesis uses a comprehensive approach to the history of architecture to tackle one of the most
controversial and yet unsolved problems of the study of antiquity. The journey began in the year
2000, when I traveled to a mysterious land in southwest Iran, to the town of Kheyrabad, to visit
an ancient building which had preserved a great secret for two millennia. This structure is today
called a chartaqi, a modern name which literally means “four-arch.” The morphological and
cosmological questions about the concepts behind the solid geometry of this structure led to an
interdisciplinary study that I present in the following chapters.



15 The main objective of this research is to study the relationship between Architecture and
Cosmology based on recent research in the interdisciplinary field of Archaeoastronomy.2 In this
study the main problem is to understand the symbolic morphology of chartaqi, in which a dome
built on a cross is intentionally and accurately aligned to particular astronomical references of the
horizon. Taking the recent discoveries of the astronomical alignments of chartaqi as a starting
point and developing a hypothesis about the relationship between the symbolic geometry of
chartaqi and ancient Iranian Mithraic symbolism, I began to investigate ancient Iranian literature
and to search for archaeological counterparts for chartaqi in the west, where the concept of
Iranian Mithra flourished in a popular Roman mystery cult in the first to fourth centuries. This
attempt led to the discovery of astronomical alignments identical to those of chartaqi in similar
Roman structures. The details of this study are demonstrated in the second chapter of this thesis.
All these discoveries revitalized my initial hypothesis and led me to reinvestigate the concept of
Mithra in the east as well as in the Roman cult of Mithras. Roman Mithraism is one of the most
controversial and unsolved problems of Roman antiquity. I took a comprehensive approach to
this problem to build a rational and analytical framework that brings together the eastern and
western Mithra. The third and fourth chapters of this thesis give important background
information for this framework. In the third chapter I present an overview of Mithraism, and in
the fourth chapter I introduce some important modern theories and studies in the field of
Mithraic studies in order to demonstrate the depth of the problem and the origins of controversies
and misunderstandings among modern scholars in the field.
2 Archeoastronomy is an interdisciplinary field which investigates how people in the past understood and used the phenomena in the sky, and what role the sky played in their rituals, culture, and beliefs.



16 Chapters five and six use the framework that I propose to solve some important problems of
Mithraic studies. In applying this framework I have tried not to confuse any data from the second
chapter or to push interpretations about the connections between Roman structures and Iranian
chartaqi, in order to avoid any prejudgments in interpreting Mithraic symbols or in attempting to
reconcile the Roman and Iranian Mithra. In fact, I built a rational framework for understanding
Mithraism in order to solve the initial problems in understanding chartaqi, and not vice versa.
Thus my cosmological framework for Mithraism, which is introduced in these two chapters,
could be a stand-alone theory on Mithraism, but in the context of this thesis forms a part of my
investigation on the symbolic geometry of chartaqi.
In chapter six I concentrate on the cosmological concepts behind the core Roman Mithraic
symbols, and in chapter seven I use this information to interpret Iranian symbols incorporated in
chartaqi, such as the cross of eternity and the revolving cosmos upon which chartaqi seem to be
constructed. In this chapter I return to the initial problem of my thesis and indicate that this
problem goes beyond chartaqi, showing how the same symbols that are crystalized in chartaqi
are repeated in other architectural forms.
In bringing together information from architecture, religious scripts, astrology, poetics,
philosophy and mythology, this study blurs disciplinary boundaries in its attempt to uncover the
place and meanings of cosmological images in the architecture of the ancient world.



17 Chapter 2 Chartaqi
2.1 Introduction to Chartaqi
Chartaqi (châhâr-tâq-i) is a general name for structures with symmetrical form consisting of
four pillars and four arches supporting a dome. (In the Persian language, chahar means “four”
and taq means “arch.”) In plan chartaqi are a square surrounding a cross and a circle.
The term chartaqi in general refers to a basic typology of structure in Iranian architecture. In this
typology four arches holding a dome appear as a part of a bigger structure that commonly shapes
the core spaces. Most mosques, temples, palaces and churches of the Islamic era are considered
to embody this structural form.
More specifically, the term chartaqi refers to structures approximately two thousand years old,
the ruins of which remain to this day in central and southwest Iran. They were originally built
freestanding and open on four sides without any doors or windows. The original name and
function of these chartaqi is still unknown and this name seems to have been given relatively
recently because of the shape of the structure. In this study the term chartaqi will be used to refer
to the specific meaning. The term “four-arch” will be used to refer to the general meaning.
Because four-arch structures were first introduced in chartaqi in Iran, the chartaqi is considered
the prototype of four-arch structures in Iranian architecture. In addition, fundamental concepts of
Iranian architecture such as orientation to four directions, a square plan embracing a circle,
dome, and a cross, all flourished purely and simply in chartaqi (fig. 2.1). The chartaqi is usually
seen as the most simple, and yet perfect, prototype of Iranian architecture and as a basis for



18 describing the development of structural and morphological concepts from ancient times to the
Islamic era.
Fig. 2.1. Plan and section of a chartaqi and a morphological analysis of chartaqi. Modified by author from sketches by Nader Ardalan.
Chartaqi connect early Persian architecture and Islamic architecture by preserving and carrying
over important spatial and geometric patterns from one tradition to the other – patterns which
always immutably reappeared, from the Achaemenid garden-palaces of Persepolis to Safavid
Meydan and the Jami Mosques of Isfahan. Although it seems difficult to portray such a long
timeline in the history of architecture with reference to a simple structure, the chartaqi has a key
position as the clearest reference point for architecture in the middle of the ancient world and at
one of the most important transitional moments in architectural history.



19 The Iranian plateau has preserved lots of secrets about the history of the ancient world.
Orientalists have put in considerable effort to discover this land, yet because of the difficulty of
working on interwoven historical layers and the complicated and controversial history of ancient
Iran, as well as geopolitical issues, the trend of discovery has been slower than in the occident.
Furthermore, the classic approach of early Orientalists who worked on Iran decades ago resulted
in the production of classified archaeological survey reports rather than comprehensive analytic
data.
In the case of the chartaqi structures in particular the research is not any better. Since among
scholars there has been no reliable explanation for the purpose of these structures, the chartaqi
was mistakenly classified by many archaeologists as a Zoroastrian fire temple, despite the fact
that no evidence could be found to prove that this was the case. In fact, there is evidence to the
contrary. The sacred Zoroastrian fire had to be kept alive for years, and was required to be
maintained far from any pollution and direct contact with people, which must have been
impossible in a chartaqi because it is open on all sides. The real Zoroastrian fire temples are
located in cities or inside royal-religious complexes. None of the chartaqi structures are
comparable to any Sassanid fire temples, such as Azar-Goshasp in northwest Iran or Firoozabad
in Fars, despite the apparent similarities of the ruins of their core structures. As far as we know,
chartaqi structures are not adjacent to any major communities. In addition, chronologically they
should not belong to Sassanid traditions, because even if not all chartaqi were built during the
Parthian era they do not belong later than the very early Sassanid dynasty.3

20 2.2 Astronomical Alignments in Chartaqi
In the year 2000, an Iranian archeologist, R. M. Ghiasabadi, unveiled a part of the mysterious
function of the chartaqi of Niasar, demonstrating that it is accurately oriented according to the
solstice and equinox sunrise. Subsequently, he documented similar observations and surveys on
other chartaqi structures and claimed the same phenomenon happening in other cases.4 I took this
discovery as the starting point for my study. Here, I briefly introduce current discoveries on
Iranian chartaqi. The diagrams of Iranian chartaqi structures in this chapter are based on
Archaeological survey reports by Ghiasabadi.
The Chartaqi of Niasar
Latitude: 33° 58' 16.95" N
Longitude: 51° 8' 31.10" E
Elevation: 1,730m
The chartaqi of Niasar is located in central Iran and is the best-preserved chartaqi in the world
(figs. 2.2, 2.3). It is located 30km from the city of Kashan, on the heights to the west of the city,
and overlooks the fields 380m below on the northeast side and mountains of the same height on
the east and south. No direct reference is made in historical texts to this structure or any other
chartaqi as far as is known. At a proximity of 70m to the structure there is a natural spring and an
old tree. There are other archaeological sites nearby, including an ancient cave used for unknown

The first archaeological report on this structure is by Andre Hardy in 1937, later cited by Andre
Godard in his book Athar-i-Iran (The Monuments of Iran). Hardy and Godard proposed that this



22
structure was a navigation monument.5 Nowadays, this structure is often described as a
Sassanid Zoroastrian fire temple built by Ardeshir I (180–242 AD), a popular misinterpretation
of this ancient monument that is not based on any archaeological evidence.
More recent studies show the astronomical alignment of this structure to the solstitial and
equinoctial orientations: scientific evidence that shows the original intentions of the designers of
the structure but leaves us with no further explanation about its function (figs. 2.4–2.8).

25 Bot-Khaneh: The Chartaqi of Atashkuh
Latitude: 33° 52' 20.74" N
Longitude: 50° 38' 1.15" E
Elevation: 1,720m
Bot-Khaneh is a chartaqi in a village called Atashkuh. It is partly ruined but the surviving part
suggests that it was one of the largest of its type with a width of 12.5m on each side. What
remains from this chartaqi are the ruins of four pillars up to 10m in height; the four arches and
the dome of this structure have not survived. The middle part of its pillars gives a unique
characteristic to this chartaqi: it was built with a heart-shaped plan, while the solstitial and
equinoctial observation angles are made even more accurate than other chartaqis. The other
interesting characteristic of this chartaqi is the remnant of an altar in the center (figs. 2.9–2.12).

Ghiasabadi reports is a later addition to the chartaqi, but the physical characteristics of the main
structure are similar to those of other chartaqi and are categorized by Ghiasabadi as late Parthian
or, less likely, early Sassanid.6

chartaqi is about 9m by 9m and its axis has 18 degrees from the north. Like the chartaqi
described above, the chartaqi of Nevis is also oriented towards solstitial and equinoctial
alignments (figs. 2.13–2.17).

30 The Chartaqi of Kheyr-Abad
Latitude: 30° 31' 46.41" N
Longitude: 50° 30' 26.02" E
Elevation: 445m
Kheyr-Abad7 is the name of a village in southwest Iran. The chartaqi of Kheyr-Abad is unique
because of its location and landscape. It is built less than 100m from a river called Zohreh. There
is a contemporaneous bridge in the main axis of this chartaqi, which follows the winter solstice
sunrise orientation. This location is on the ancient Shahi road – a royal road dating back to the
Achaemenids which connected Persepolis and Pasargad to Susa, Babylonia, and other important
cities in the west. The bridge is probably a Parthian or Sassanid bridge reconstructed on the site
of a more ancient road. Interestingly, there is another bridge built by the Safavids 250m to the
north of this bridge,8 of which two parts survive, one on each side of the river, showing that this
road was still an important route until the eighteenth century (figs. 2.18–2.23).
7 The name Kheyr-Abad seems to be a derived from an ancient name. In my opinion, the word kheyr, which meansΝ“blessing”ΝinΝArabic,ΝisΝnotΝtheΝtrueΝoriginΝofΝthisΝname.ΝInstead,ΝIΝbelieve it may represent the Pahlavi
khowar,ΝwhichΝmeansΝ“sun.”ΝTheΝwordΝKhowar-Abad or Khowar-Abat was a name for the temples of the sun. This name later became Kharabat in Persian poetry, for example in the work of the fourteenth century Persian Poet Hafiz, to describe a Magian worship place or a pagan temple. The closest word used in the late Persian language is Mehr-Abad, which originally referred to a temple of Mehr or Mithra, an Iranian deiety about which I will elaborate below. In the late Persian language the name Mehr was also used to address the sun; while this deity was not originally really a solar deity it has a complicated affinity with the sun. The name Mehr-Abad is preserved in Islamic architectureΝinΝtheΝformΝofΝtheΝ“εehrab,”ΝwhichΝrefers to the most important part of a mosque: a small decorative arch showing the orientation of daily prayers in the mosque towards Mecca. Another chartaqi which will be discussed below is called Khowr-Abad. It is possible that that the people used to call both of these structures “Khowar-Abad.”
8 The Safavid bridge is built in another location, possibly because of the engineering considerations of the span of the bridge, and does not follow the winter solstice orientation. This suggests that the winter solstice orientation of the road passing along the axis of this chartaqi was more important than the engineering difficulties of constructing the first bridge.

34 Khaneh-i-Div
Latitude: 36° 20' 34.19" N
Longitude: 57° 20' 55.27" E

This structure is believed to be another chartaqi and is located in the northeast of Iran. The ruins
of this chartaqi are in a remote place in the mountains on top of a cliff. The name Khaneh-i-Div
wasΝprobablyΝgivenΝfairlyΝrecentlyΝbyΝtheΝlocalΝpeopleΝandΝmeansΝ“theΝhouseΝofΝtheΝmonster,”Ν
because of the unusual location of this huge structure. This peculiarity helps to understand the
architectural concept and the function of the chartaqi, which in this case is obviously not located
in an accessible place but in a better location for equinoctial and solstitial sunrise alignments in
the mountainous skyline (figs. 2.24–2.26).

What remains from this structure are the ruins of two pillars of a four-arch structure. The plan of
this structure can be reconstructed based on a symmetrical projection of the two pillars.
Ghiasabadi believes that these are the remains of a chartaqi and that its main axis follows the
equinoctial orientation9 (figs. 2.27, 2.28).

chartaqi and demonstrated the astronomical alignment of this structure (fig. 2.29).
10 The name Khowr-Abad, as discussed in fn 7, supports the idea that this name was assigned to this place after an ancient name for the function of this chartaqi.

2.3 Chartaqi in Iranian Cosmology: From Persia to Rome
Ghiasabadi introduces twenty-five chartaqi in his work on Iranian chartaqi,11 but the
archaeological work on all of these still needs further documentation. However, the important
discovery of the astronomical alignments in chartaqi opened a horizon for new investigations in
different disciplines, including Architecture.ΝGhiasabadi’sΝdiscoveryΝisΝofΝparticular interest to
Archaeoastronomy. His investigation, which is mainly based on observation and fieldwork,
creates a foundation for a theoretical study of chartaqi, aiming to discover the architectural
concepts inherent in this important prototype of Iranian architecture.
My dissertation investigates the architectural concepts implicit in the geometry of chartaqi, with
a connected approach encompassing the cosmology behind it. Architecture should not be

39 reduced in meaning to a technique to build shelters. In fact, it is a serious effort of human
beings over generations towards an attentive experiencing of the world, accomplished through
dwelling in a place and developing an awareness of their location on the earth. It is a way to
manifest and inscribe the human presence in space and time by building on the earth and under
the heavens. The geometry of architecture, as the alphabet of this inscription, should not have
been speculated otherΝthanΝtheΝman’s abstract perception of his surrounding landscape, including
the sky. Thus on the one hand architecture is in close relationship to human beings, their bodily
perceptions and their behavior, and on the other hand human beings are inspired by and limited
to their environment and landscape. If architecture is not just the absolute reflection of the human
abstract perception of nature, it is at least a mediator between human beings and nature, or in
broader sense a mediator between human beings and the cosmos.
Attempts to reflect the intrinsic connection between human beings and the cosmos can be traced
back to early human cultures, and appeared, either explicitly or symbolically, in ancient myths
and graphics. Nature and the perceivable world of human beings formed the essence of their
historical and cultural identity. As part of the cultural treasure of human history on the land,
ancient architecture cannot be studied independently from the beliefs, myths, and rituals of
human beings and their perception of the landscape and the cosmos.
Chartaqi reflect the cosmic order, aligning with astronomical references. The intelligible form of
the chartaqi has embedded in it the most fundamental and perpetual symbols and cosmic
patterns: square, circle, cross, symmetry, harmony, and verticality. Within its simple form, the
chartaqi conveys profound concepts of the mythical world. For example, there is a significant
meaning for squaring the circle, which among architecture historians is often explained as a



40 metaphorical reconstruction or reconciliation of the earth and the heavens, of quantity and
quality, of the four elements, the four seasons, and the four directions. The four pillars and the
anatomical proportions of the chartaqi show how concisely this form puts together traditional
symbols. Although this in itself is enough to make the chartaqi a powerful instance of the
integration of primordial divine forms by human beings, a further element of importance in the
study of the chartaqi is the incredible integrity of this form with its landscape: a landscape which
brings the solstice and equinox sunrise/sunset orientation between the edges of its four pillars
and into the center of the circle and the square. Apparently this quadrupedal structure connects
the earth to the sky by its meaningful orientation towards cosmic references.
The Iranian cross significantly appears in tombs of Achaemenid kings in Persepolis and Naghsh
e-Rostam. In these tombs a funeral chamber was built in the center of huge crosses carved on
rocks (fig. 2.30). In Naghsh-e-Rostam there is another building, commonly called Kabe-Zartosht,
in a site in which four of the cross-form tombs face the structure (fig. 2.31). In the design of the
façade there are four square stones on each side that proportionally form the negative geometry
of the crosses. The original name and function of this building is also unknown.

The cross, also represented in the quadrifrons geometry of the chartaqi, is commonly known as a
Mithraic pattern in Iranian architecture. Cosmology is an important part of ancient Iranian
mythology, but it is almost forgotten in the study of ancient Iranian texts. Mithra, or Mehr in
modern Persian, is an ancient deity in the Avesta whose seat is in the sky. He is the final savior



42 who will help people to overcome evil and enemies who are breaking treaties and disturbing
the peace. The word mehr also represents the sun, but the deity was originally differentiated from
the sun in the Avesta. The month after the fall equinox in the Persian calendar is named after this
deity.
It is possible that the chartaqi are built according to a more ancient cosmology that incorporates
the symbol of the cross in architecture, which appeared even before the Parthians, as in
Achaemenid structures. In the chartaqi a dome is also introduced as the building system in the
Parthian era, which experimented with dome structures for the first time. Yet the geometry of the
chartaqi reflects the same fundamental symbolic elements represented by the Achaemenids.
The civilization of the Indus valley, Iranian plateau, and Mesopotamia probably had cultural
encounters with the western civilizations at least by means of trade routes, but the cultural
encounters increased in the Hellenistic era and following this era the transmission of ideas
resulted in the emergence of new ideological concepts. This is the time when mystery cults such
as the cults of Isis and Mithras appear among the Romans. Mithra is also a divinity in Indic
culture in the Vedic texts, and was also known among other civilizations. Information on Mithra
in Iran is scanty, except in the Yashts of the Avesta, in a part that is believed to preserve pre
Zoroastrian myths. Mithra migrated to the west and Mithraism flourished in the first century in a
completely different form among the Romans as a secret cult. The Romans called the cult “the
Mysteries of the Persians.” Finding the origins of this Roman form of Mithra has been a
controversial subject among twentieth century scholars. If we accept that the Romans borrowed
mythological elements from Iranian cosmology, they could also have borrowed concepts and
symbols of Iranian cosmology. These speculations encouraged me to search for a possible



43 counterpart to the chartaqi in the Roman world, particularly in sites associated with Roman
Mithraism.
In my research I studied a structure contemporaneous to the chartaqi by the Danube River in
Austria in the archaeological city of Carnuntum: a Roman army camp and an important Mithraic
heritage site. The building is a four-arch structure called Heidentor or “Pagan Gate.” After
preliminary studies I traveled to Carnuntum to confirm my speculations about this structure as a
Roman counterpart to Iranian chartaqi. The results of my analysis of this structure show the
existence of similar astronomical alignments to the chartaqi. I essentially owe this discovery to
the help of Professor Ricardo Castro, who believed this structure may have many similarities to
Iranian chartaqi.

Latitude: 48° 6' 12.80" N
Longitude: 16° 51' 14.26" E
Elevation: 150m
Eastern horizon inclinationŚΝ~Ν0 ̊
The quadrifrons of the Heidentor stand on four massive square pillars, which were connected by
cross vaults. The area of the Heidentor was 16.2m by 16.2 m, and the 4.35m wide pillars stood at
a distance of 5.83m apart. They extended beyond the vault area and wore a horizontal entablature
above the parapet. The foundations, which have been fully excavated, can be seen to be in exact
alignment with a rectangular plan.



44 The historical context and function of the Heidentor has not been satisfactorily explained.
Earlier classifications hypothesized that it functioned as a city gate or a kind of street gate which
spanned an intersection, or as a grave monument or triumphal arch for a historically significant
gathering of Roman emperors in the year 308 AD. However, these suggestions have had to be
discarded. I think the best suggestion is from the Hungarian archaeologist Sándor Soproni, who
thoughtΝtheΝHeidentorΝwasΝaΝmonumentΝ“ofΝstrictlyΝculticΝandΝsymbolicΝnature.”12
Presumably, the monument stood on a busy road junction in the city of Carnuntum, but the
presence of the central figure suggests another function for this structure on the crossroad.13 The
monument is located on a slightly higher terrace at the intersection of two roads, one of which
linked the Limes Road to the Amber Road. The site was obviously chosen for topographical and
urban reasons. The intersection of the quadrifrons is precisely aligned to the cardinal directions.
The structure was built in the time of the Christian Emperor Constantine II (Constantine was
probably influenced by Arianism).14 TheΝcurrentΝname,ΝmeaningΝ“paganΝgate,” was probably
attributed in medieval times and it is possible that the early Christians identified this structure
with a pagan tradition. I do not intend to connect this building directly to the Mithraic cult, but
taking into consideration that Mithraism was well-known among the elite in Carnuntum and that
architectural concepts can preserve and reflect a tradition, it is not difficult to imagine that its
architects were aware of an architectural tradition that stemmed from a complex cosmology
related to a mystery cult with Persian origins.15 Later I will also argue that the Mithraic

13 Werner Jobst, ed., Das Heidentor von Carnuntum. Ein Führer (Vienna: Verlag der Österreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, 2002), 6–10, 53–54. 14 Arianism is an early form of Christianity based on the teachings of the Alexandrian priest Arius. 15 Another fact that I think might be also important is the distance of this structure from the city and its placement in a region of the Danube valley that has a constant wind (fig. 2.39). The existence of a modern wind



45 cosmology passed to Christian theology in many ways. But first let us see the
archaeoastronomical analysis of this structure.
The structure is built on the cardinal directions, which in its flat horizon makes the east and west
the precise equinoctial points. I calculated the observation angles through the pillars according to
archaeological measurements and discovered that the proportions of the pillars are built to
precisely follow the solstitial orientations (figs. 2.34, 2.35). The ancient Roman road passes next
to the Heidentor and apparently the current gravel road in the farmlands follows the footprints of
the ancient Roman road connecting to the city of Carnuntum (figs. 2.36, 2.37). This road also
follows the winter solstice sunrise orientation. While the Heidentor is built according to the
cardinal orientations, the solstitial orientations are considered in the observation angles through
pillars. This suggests that the Roman road was also planned according to the solstitial
orientation.16
farm in this region is obvious proof for this fact. On my first visit to the chartaqi of Kheyr-Abad in the year 2000, one of the first things I noticed when studying a four-arch structure open on four sides was the consideration of the wind as a factor in the planning of these structures. In Iranian Mithraic and Zurvanite cosmology a deity called Vad plays an important role and is represented by the wind. I will elaborate on this mythology below. 16 The concept of a road aligned with the solstitial orientation and connected to this type of four-arch structure is very close to what I mentioned above about the chartaqi of Kheyr-Abad in Iran. The proximity to a river is another similarity between these two sites.

In September 2012 I met Sepp Rothwangl, an archaeoastronomer from Austria, and discussed
this issue with him. He had noticed another phenomenon. He was studying a type of small chapel
or wayside shrine, significantly having a red cross (or often a white cross) as part of a typical
design called Red Crosses (Rotes Kreuz in German). While studying Teufelstein, another
archaeological site in Austria, Rothwangl had noticed that two of these shrines, kilometers away
from Carnuntum, are perfectly located on the solstitial orientation together with the Heidentor
(fig. 2.38). The coordinates of these crosses are: Red Cross (201, near Loretto): 016° 29' 40"
East; 47° 55' 02" North; and North White Cross (near Sarasdorf): 016° 41' 20" East; 48° 01' 13"
North.

51 Arch of Janus (Rome, Italy)
Latitude: 41° 53' 21.41" N
Longitude: 12° 28' 57.28" E
Elevation: 48m
After the discovery in Carnuntum I continued examining other similar contemporaneous
structures in the Roman world based on available archaeological surveys, GIS information, and
solar calculation. The closest example to the Heidentor is the Arch of Janus in Rome (fig. 2.40).
The Arch of Janus (Arco di Giano in Italian) is an ancient monument in Rome. It is a so-called
quadrifrons, a four-sided structure with a square base, built of brick and Roman concrete covered
with marble. In ancient Rome, the sixteen meter-high building stood in a prominent place in the
area at the northern end of the Velabrum Forum Boarium. This structure was built in the fourth
century. It is believed by historians that the name Janus dates from the Renaissance.17 A
comparison with the structurally similar Heidentor at Carnuntum showed that both quadrifrontes
were built according to the same planning scheme.18 The measurements show that the plan of the
Arch of Janus is slightly different from a square but perfectly follows the winter solstice sunrise
and the equinoctial orientations (figs. 2.41–2.44).
17 However, even if the name of the Roman god Janus was attributed in the Renaissance only coincidentally, because of the known quadrifrons form of this mysterious time-god, the similarity is important to take into consideration when interpreting the quadrifrons geometry of this typology of structure. This is especially the case now that the astronomical alignments in this structure have been discovered and its connection with Roman cosmology and concepts of time is very possible. 18 Erwin Reidinger, with Wilfried Greiner, Markus Jobst, andΝWernerΝJobst,Ν“Das Heidentor in Carnuntum und der Janus Quadrifrons in Rom – Bautechnische Analyse undΝVergleich,” in Carnuntum Jahrbuch 2007, ed.

Arch of Malborghetto (Italy)
Latitude: 42° 3' 8.33" N
Longitude: 12° 29' 13.50" E
Elevation: 110m
The Arch of Malborghetto, now a museum,19 is another Roman four-arch structure located in the
north of Rome. Over the centuries the structure was modified and reused for other functions, and
is a massive building that at first sight resembles a medieval structure; however the Roman
19 Ranuccio Bianchi Bandinelli and Mario Torelli, L'arte dell'antichità classica, Etruria-Roma (Utet: Torino 1976).



55 structure is distinguishable (fig. 2.45). The four-arch structure was originally built in the fourth
century AD. Its current name comes from the area in which it is located, Malborghetto. It was
located on the intersection of two major roads, the Via Flaminia and the Via Veientana, of which
some parts remain in the area surrounding (fig. 2.46).20 The architectural structure of the original
building was that of a four-sided rectangular arch with dimensions of 14.86m by 11.87m and is
assumed to be about 18m high. The masonry brick, still visible, suggests a cladding of marble
slabs anchored with metal clamps, because of the existence of square holes on the exterior walls.
Existence of the exterior columns on two of four sides is also suggested.

The analysis of the archaeological plans of the Roman part of the Arch of Malborghetto reveals
that this arch, like the Heidentor and the Arch of Janus, has astronomical alignments. It is
perfectly aligned with the two solstitial orientations (fig. 2.47). The equinoctial alignment in the
structure is considered to have 6 degrees deflection towards the north from actual cardinal east,
where the local equinoctial sunrise orientation would be. This amount of difference in
archaeoastronomical calculation is often ignored, and the ancient artificial skyline could have
been different and/or the archaeological survey might have lacked the necessary precision. Still,
considering the landscape, the most important natural landmark in the horizon is the peak of
Mont Gennaro (with a height of 1,274m at a proximity of 26km to this site), visible three degrees
towards the north of cardinal east from the Arch of Malborghetto, and this could be the reason
for this inaccurate equinoctial alignment (fig. 2.48). The other possibility is the consideration of
other important orientations such as the orientation of Via Flamina or another urban axis of the
site before the construction of the structure.

The presence of an arch on the Flaminian road in the fourth century has been ascribed to the fact
that the troops of Constantine descended from the north along this road in order to oppose the
troops of the Emperor Maxentius. According to Christian reports, Constantine, while camping in



58 this place, saw the sign of the cross in the sky at sunset and in his sleep was warned to mark
the heavenly sign of God on the shields of his army and to go into battle. The next day, October
28th 312 AD, at Saxa Rubra, Constantine routed the army of his rival, Maxentius, who perished
in the waters of the Tiber. Following this victory, in 315 the Roman Senate ordered the erection
of the bifrontal arch near the Colosseum in the city of Urbs and, perhaps, the erection of the four
fronted one at Malborghetto in the Suburbium.21 This story, whether true or not, relates this site
and the quadrifrons geometry of this structure with the heavenly cross sign of God in early
Christianity.
The Renaissance architect Giuliano da Sangallo made the first graphic reconstruction of the
original monument (fig. 2.49). Later the archaeologist Fritz Toebelmann also made a graphic
reconstruction of the building (fig. 2.50). In his graphic reconstruction of this monument,
Toebelmann hypothesizes a statue of a charioteer riding a quadriga on top of this structure. This
suggestion recalls an image from the Arch of Nero, an earlier, probably similar Roman structure
that has not survived. This arch, built in honor of the emperor Nero, was decreed by the Senate in
58 AD on the occasion of the Roman victory over the Parthians, but was actually only built in 62
AD. It was placed on the access road to the Capitol, but was probably destroyed shortly after.
Depictions of this arch on coins show it to have been a single arch, with Corinthian columns
above pedestals projecting from the facade and a statue of a charioteer riding a four-horse chariot
accompanied by two other figures on the sides (fig. 2.51).

The Romans and the two Iranian Empires, the Parthians and their Sassanid successors, were the
most serious rivals in antiquity. Battles started in 92 BC and occurred several times until 629
AD, when the Arab invasions ended the power of the Sassanid and Byzantine East Roman
empires, both of which were exhausted after the last catastrophic wars between them.
The wars were usually triggered by provocative and ambitious intentions on both sides to take
control of border regions of Armenia and Syria. When Nero became emperor of Rome, the
Iberian prince of the Roman vassal kingdom of Armenia was overthrown and replaced with
Tiridates, a Parthian prince. This created a challenge for Nero to satisfy the Romans, who
assumed this was a Parthian invasion of Armenia. Nero sent the military to the region and the
Parthians temporarily gave up control of Armenia.22 The peace treaty between Nero and the
Parthians, which was considered a victory for Nero, did not last long and Vologases I, the
Parthian king, refused the removal of his brother Tiridates from Armenia. Then the real war
broke out in 58 AD. Initially the Parthians fully invaded Armenia but in the same year Tiridates

retreatedΝinΝtheΝfaceΝofΝσero’sΝforcesΝandΝtheΝParthianΝarmyΝwasΝrepelledΝfromΝArmenia.23
Nero was acclaimed for this initial victory. However, in 62 an 63 the war between the Romans
and Parthians continued after the Roman invasion of the Parthian province of Adiabene, and the
Parthians intended to strike against the Roman province of Syria, which led to anxiety in both
Empires.24 Nero become popular by going for another peace treaty with the Parthians, according
to which Tiridates returned to Armenia but was crowned in Rome by Nero.25
Tiridates was crowned in Rome in 66 AD and Nero generously received him in order to increase
his popularity. One of the famous and rare historical references to early Roman Mithraism is
from the second and third century historian Cassius Dio, who describes the occasion of the
coronation of Tiridates I in Rome by Nero in 66 AD. According to Dio Cassius, Tiridates told
Nero that he revered him as Mithras.26 The concept of Mithraism was probably well known to
the Roman Emperor and the Parthian Prince, since they used the name of Mithras on the
occasion of the peace agreement, although Mithraism as a popular cult might only have been
established in its Roman form years later in Rome.
As a symbolic action Nero ordered the gates of the temple of Janus (not to be confused with the
arch of Janus) to be shut, declaring that the time of peace had returned to the Roman Empire.27
Janus or Ianus was the god of time, the god of gates, god of beginnings, passages, and ends.
January, the first month following the winter solstice, is also named after him. Janus was the
two-faced god who stood in passages and looked towards the east and west. The Gate of Janus

was reported to have doors which were opened in times of war and closed in times of peace.28
There is a coin of Nero, probably struck in celebration of this occasion, showing the temple of
Janus with closed gates (fig. 2.52). While the name “ArchΝofΝJanus”ΝhasΝbeenΝarguedΝtoΝbeΝaΝ
Renaissance attribution, the earlier architectural models suggest that the concept of quadrifrons
arches, often believed to be triumphal arches, also related in a way to the god Janus. Thus the
name, even if a Renaissance invention, is possibly not just a coincidence.

28 In my opinion the symbolic action of the closure of the gates of the temple of Janus was in order to trap the time of peace in the temple (since Janus represented the concept of eternal time.)



63 The Arch of Cáparra (Spain)
Latitude: 40° 9' 59.81" N
Longitude: 6° 6' 3.67" W
Elevation: 402m
The Roman city of Cáparra is located in the ancient Roman province of Lusitania, in the region
of the Alagon River valley in the north of Extremadura, in the Conventus Iuridicus Emeritensis.
It is crossed by the Roman road called Via de la Plata, whose remains are abandoned today.
During the High Middle Ages, the city began to lose population in the abandonment following
the Muslim invasion. It was repopulated after the territory was conquered by the Christian
kingdoms. The Arch of Cáparra is the most important surviving building in the city. It is a four
arch structure, the only one of its type in Spain. It has a square plan with measurements of 8.6m
by 7.35m, with an estimated height of 13.3m in its original state. It is situated in the center of the
city, bordered by the forum and public baths and other major monuments. It is very likely that it
was on the intersection of the two main Roman streets, the Cardo and the Decumanus.29
What is very important about this structure is the solstitial alignment of the Via de la Plata
Roman road, like the Roman road in Carnuntum. More than 6km of this road extends in a
straight line to pass through the arch. This arch is built on the Roman axes of city planning, the
Cardo and Decumanus, which are perpendicular in Cáparra with the Decumanus purposely
aligned with the solstitial orientation. The arch is designed to accommodate these city axes along
with the other solstitial orientation and the equinoctial orientation (figs. 2.53–2.56). The
proportion of the structure also accommodates the north-south cardinal directions in the

Roman architecture emphasizes urban design. The ideal city for Romans seems to have a square
plan through which two crossing straight streets define the positioning of other main structures in
the city and dictate the alignment of the urban grid. In cities like Timgad in modern Algeria,
designed by Romans from scratch, this concept is perfectly applied. These two axes are called



66 Cardo (usually north-south) and Decumanus (usually east-west). In the case of Cáparra, it
seems that the cosmic alignment of the city is not limited to the cardinal points but also addresses
the solstitial and equinoctial orientations, and the four-arch structure plays a significant role in
bringing together all these alignments to fully cosmicize the Roman city. Later, I will explain
why these orientations could be so important in this context.
Palmyra Tetrapylon (Syria)
Latitude: 34° 33' 5.44" N
Longitude: 38° 16' 4.94" E
Elevation: 410m
Eastern horizon inclination: 0°
Palmyra is a city located in central Syria and is known to have existed since at least the second
millennium BC, as it is mentioned in the archives of Mari. The city is called Tadmor in Hebrew
and Arabic and is mentioned in the Hebrew bible. The city became independent after the
Seleucids took control of Syria in 323 BC. It became a wealthy city because of its situation on
trade routes linking China, India, and Persia to the Mediterranean. In the mid-first century AD
the Romans took control of Syria and Phoenicia. Palmyra became one of the richest cities of the
near east and Palmyrans are believed to have owned ships in Italian waters and to have



67
controlledΝtheΝIndianΝsilkΝtradeŚΝtheyΝ“manage[d] to live alongside Rome without being
Romanized.”30
The city has a Decumanus Maximus or main Decumanus street that intersects with a Cardo
street. On the intersection is built a tetrapylon structure, that is, a structure with a square plan and
four sets of pillars, each set made of four pillars (figs. 2.57–2.59).

68
Fig. 2.59. Digital 3D reconstruction of the Palmyra tetrapylon. Diagram by author.
In Palmyra, both Cardo and Decumanus change orientation slightly after passing the intersection.
These orientations, which I will call Cardo II and Decumanus II, are built on the axes of a temple
in the northwest (the Temple of Bel) and another temple in the northeast. The orientation of
Cardo II towards the temple of Bel31 is perpendicular to Decumanus II, which is oriented towards
the winter solstice sunrise direction. But the orientations of Cardo and Decumanus on the other
side of the intersection, which I call here Cardo I and Decumanus I, are not perpendicular and are
situated exactly according to the solstitial alignments. The tetrapylon here is constructed
according to the axes of Decumanus II, which points towards one of the temples. But the
observation angles between the four sets of pillars also accommodate the cardinal directions and
the summer sunrise (winter sunset) solstitial orientation. Furthermore, if we take into
31 Bel was a semitic god worshiped in Palmyra in triad with the moon god Aglibo and the sun god Yarhibo. This stone temple was dedicated in the first century and was the center of religious activities in Palmyra. In the ceiling of the northern chamber of the temple there is a bas-relief of seven planets surrounded by the zodiac. See: Charles Gates, Ancient Cities: The Archaeology of Urban Life in the Ancient Near East and Egypt, Greece and Rome (Oxford and New York: Routledge, 2003); Ted Kaizer, The Religious Life of Palmyra: A Study of the Social Patterns of Worship in the Roman Period (Stuttgart: Franz Steiner Verlag, 2002); Aedeen Cremin, Archaeologica: The World's Most Significant Sites and Cultural Treasures (London: Frances Lincoln Ltd, 2007). The astrological iconography of the zodiac in the temple and the pantheon of Bel and is potentially comparable to Roman mithraic iconography.



69 consideration the four columns of each set we see that the other solstitial alignment (the winter
solstice sunrise, which is the same as the summer solstice sunset here) is also perfectly
considered in the design of this structure. The orientation of Cardo I, that is, the orientation of the
tetrapylon towards the temple of Bel, is also considered in this way. This shows that the form of
this sixteen-pillar structure was intentionally chosen and accurately designed in this way to
accommodate six different orientations.
There is another bifrons arch named after Septimius Severus on Decumanus I, located 320m
southeast of the tetrapylon. The winter solstice sunset could be perfectly enframed in this arch,
observing through the tetrapylon along Decumanus I, which is built as a colonnade. The theater
of Palmyra, which is one of the most magnificent surviving Roman theaters, is built accurately
on this orientation on the south side of Decumanus I, while the buildings of the Agora and
Senate, built right behind the theater, are not exactly oriented towards the solstitial direction but
aligned with Cardo I. This phenomenon shows other arches planned and designed according to
an astronomic order, creating a network defining the main axes of the Roman urban plan (figs.
2.60–2.65).

Romans invaded Mesopotamia, winning battles at Dura-Europos and Seleucia.32 The
concurrence of the Roman counter-attack on the Parthians with the year this structure was built
could be important, as I mentioned earlier in the case of the Arch of Nero. It is possible that the
structure represents the cross, as a cosmological symbol known by both the Romans and their
Parthian rivals, and is associated with the victory.

Latitude: 35° 24' 16.90" N
Longitude: 8° 7' 22.94" E

This structure is another Roman four-arch structure built around 214 AD in Tebessa, a city in
modern Algeria, years after this city became part of the Roman Empire in 146 CE. This elegant
structure seems to have originally been built on the Decumanus axis of the city, and later became
the gate for a Byzantine wall founded in 535 AD to protect the city from its enemies. I believe
that the wall, which survives to this date, is constructed on the orientation of Decumanus and can
reveal the main street crossing the four-arch structure. Interestingly, this axis, like the Palmyran
Decumanus, slightly changes orientation (by about 6 degrees) after passing the four-arch



76 structure. In one part (shown in figure 2.71 as Decumanus I) it is oriented towards the winter
solstice sunrise direction, while the main axis of the four-arch structure is oriented to the other
orientation of Decumanus (shown in figure 2.71 as Decumanus II).
This structure is also perfectly designed according to the cardinal axes, the orientation of Cardo
and Decumanus, and the equinoctial and solstitial directions. A dome was also built on top of
four pillars in this structure, which has not survived.

78 Chapter 3 Mithraism: An Overview
The modern term “Mithraism” replaced the terms “the Mysteries of Mithras” and “the Mysteries
of the Persians” that were used in antiquity. “Mithras” is the name of the Indo-Iranian god
Mithra adopted into Greek. Because of the secret nature of this cult in Roman antiquity, almost
no considerable written narratives or theology from the religion survive, but fortunately hundreds
of artifacts related to Mithraism have been preserved.
The majority of the research on Roman Mithraism focuses on interpreting the physical evidence,
while the definition of Roman Mithraism remains problematic and controversial. Despite the fact
that the Romans believed in an Iranian origin for this cult, finding its origins has been one of the
controversies among twentieth century scholars.
3.1 Early Record of the Name Mithra in Asia Minor
The first surviving record of the name “Mithra,” spelled Mi-it-ra, dates back to 1380 BC33 in the
inscribed peace treaty between the Hittites34 and the Hurrian35 kingdom of Mitanni in Asia
Minor.36 In this treaty the name is mentioned, from the Mittani side, together with four other
Indo-European divinities as a witness and keeper of the treaty. In the earlier Indic culture,
33 Robert Turcan, The Cults of the Roman Empire (Hoboken, NJ: Wiley-Blackwell, 1996), 196. 34 The Hittite empire was established in north-central Anatolia around the eighteenth century BC and reached its height during the mid-fourteenth century BC when it ruled most of Asia Minor as well as parts of the northern Levant and Upper Mesopotamia. The empire came to an end after 1180 BC. However, several independent NeoHittite cities survived until the eighth century BC. The Hittite language was a member of the Indo-European language family. 35 The Hurrians were a Bronze Age people living in Anatolia and Northern Mesopotamia, who spoke a HurroUrartian language of the Ancient Near East. The kingdom of Mitanni was the largest and most influential partly Hurrian nation. However, the Mitanni people spoke an Indo-European language and formed a ruling class over the Hurrians.
36 PaulΝThieme,Ν“TheΝ'Aryan'ΝGodsΝofΝtheΝεitanniΝTreaties,”ΝJournal of the American Oriental Society 80.4 (1960): 301–317.



79 Mithra, in its Sanskrit form mitra, is a divinity of the Rigveda, with a relationship to Varuna,
who is the principle of cosmic order and the regulator and coordinator of the universe. The peace
treaty, in which the name of Mithra is inscribed, clearly demonstrates that he was well known, at
least for both Mitannis and Hittites, in Anatolia in the twelfth century BC.
3.2 Mithra in Iran
In Iranian mythology the god Mithra appears in the Avesta, the sacred texts of Zoroastrianism.
The Avesta is a compilation of ancient texts mainly attributed to the Mazdean priesthood and the
Sassanid political power, of which only a fraction has been transmitted to the Zoroastrians of
Iran and India today. However, it is one of the sources which can help in reconstructing the pre
Mazdean Iranian mythology, as it mentions the ancient divinities in several hymns.
The second longest Yasht (collection of hymns) of the Avesta is named after Mithra and has 146
verses. In this part of the Avesta Mithra appears to have as a companion Varahran (Bahram in
modern Persian), a divinity associated with victory. Varahran here is described as a boar with
ironΝteethΝrunningΝinΝfrontΝofΝεithra’sΝfour-horse chariot, fighting for him. He has a thousand
eyes and a thousand ears and always stands in the high end of the north sky. Most of the
references here are assumed cosmological references which we rarely see later in Mazdean
mythology. In another part of the Avesta, the Gathas, which are associated with the words of
Zoroaster himself, Mithra means “oath.”



80 3.3 Mithra in India
Mitra (Mitrá in Sanskrit) is an important divinity of Indic culture and the patron divinity of
honesty, friendship, contracts and meetings. He is a figure of the Rigveda, distinguished by a
relationship to Varuna, the protector of ṛtá, which is the principle of natural order and the
regulator of the operation of the universe.
The Vedic Mitra is a prominent deity of the Rigveda distinguished by a relationship to Varuna.
Mitra and Varuna counted among a group of deities called Adityas (the seven celestial deities,
sons of Aditi in the Rigveda). They are the supreme keepers of order and gods of the law.
In the Vedic hymns, Mitra is often invoked together with Varuna as Mitra-Varuna. In some of
their aspects, Varuna is lord of the cosmic rhythm of the celestial spheres while Mitra brings
forth the light at dawn, which was covered by Varuna during the night.
InΝ1896ΝRalphΝT.ΝH.ΝGriffithΝtranslatedΝRigvedaΝ3.59.1ΝasΝ“εitra, when speaking, stirreth men to
labor: Mitra sustaineth both the earth and heaven. Mitra beholdeth men with eyes that close not.
ToΝεitraΝbring,ΝwithΝholyΝoil,Νoblation.”37 This part is close to the Avestan Yasht of Mithra,
which describes him as restlessly watching people between the heaven and the earth with a
thousand eyes, and as never sleeping.
37 Ralph T. H. Griffith, trans., The Rig Veda (Forgotten Books, 2008). Other Rigvedic hymns to Mitra-Varuna are RV 1.136, 137, 151–153, RV 5.62–72, RV 6.67, RV 7.60–66, RV 8.25 and RV 10.132.



81 3.4 Mithra in Commagene
Commagene was located in south-central modern Turkey in Asia Minor. It became an Assyrian
province in 708 BC under Sargon II and in the sixth century BC was part of the Persian Empire.
In the fourth century BC Alexander the Great conquered the area and it later became a part of the
Greco-Syrian Seleucid Empire. In the Hellenistic era, Commagene was known as an Armenian
kingdom between the Roman Empire and Parthia38 and played the role of a buffer state between
the Romans and Parthians.39 Subsequently, the power struggle over Armenia provoked several
wars between the Persians and the Romans which lasted for many years until the seventh century
AD.
I believe this area is very important to the study of Mithraism. This is not only because the first
inscribed record of Mithra is found in Asia Minor, but also because Asia Minor in general and
Armenia in particular have been most intense geopolitical and intercultural contact regions
between Persians and Greeks and later between Persians and Romans. The early form of Roman
Mithraism that flourished in the west after the first century AD was also found in Commagene as
early as the first century BC.
Mithras appears in the colossal statuary of Mount Nemrut, built in the time of Antiochus I who
was the king of Commagene from 69 to 34 BC.40 Mithras here appears, alongside other deities

3.5 Mithra in Rome
The Roman form of Mithraism, known as “the Mysteries of Mithras” or “the Mysteries of the
Persians,” was a highly secret cult with almost no first hand surviving narratives. However, it is
the broadest and richest in archaeological artifacts related to the god Mithras. The origins and
spread of Roman Mithraism are controversial among scholars.43 Some believe that the cult was
not practiced until the first century AD,44 while others suggest the middle of the first century BC
as the beginning of the mysteries in the west. According to the historian Plutarch, in 67 BC the
pirates of Cilicia (a province on the southeastern coast of Asia Minor) were practicing “secret

84
rites” of Mithras.45 Whatever its status in the Roman Empire prior to that time, what is
undeniable is that the underground cult of Mithras suddenly began to be distributed all over the
Roman Empire in the last quarter of the first century AD.46
3.5.1 Iconography
Most of the inscriptions and monuments related to Roman Mithraism have been collected in a
catalogue by Maarten J. Vermaseren called the Corpus Inscriptionum et Monumentorum
Religionis Mithriacae (CIMRM). The most important artifact is a repeated bull-slaying scene,
which leaves no doubt that this figure conveys the core divine message of the cult. In this scene a
man wearing a Phrygian cap, generally accepted as the figure of Mithras, kills a bull. The bull
always faces towards the right and the bull slayer turns his head while killing the bull. In the
elaborated form, a dog, a snake, a cup, and a raven usually appear in the scene. In this scene a
scorpion is attached to the bull’sΝgenitals.ΝTwoΝotherΝmenΝwearingΝPhrygianΝcapsΝstandΝoneΝonΝ
each side with crossed legs and bear torches in different positions. Usually a complete zodiac is
depicted on top of the scene (or encircling the scene), or often we see clouds in a bow shape
framing the scene on top. Rarely, a lion is also present sitting in the middle (figs. 3.3, 3.4).

Another important figure of Roman Mithraism, of which many instances are found in Mithraic
temples, is a lion-headed naked man, often called the “leontocephaline” or the “leontocephalicΝ
god”ΝbyΝscholars,ΝentwinedΝbyΝaΝsnakeΝ(fig.Ν3.5). He is represented as having four wings, a
thunderbolt, and a key (sometimes two keys) and a scepter in his hand. Occasionally, this figure
is found in human-headed form. In some instances he is shown as standing on the cosmic

sphere.47 Identification of this figure has been an even greater challenge for scholars than
finding the origins of the god Mithras. Some scholars, like Cumont, identify the lion-man as
Aion or Kronos and associate him with the Iranian deity Zurvan, while others assert that he is
Ahriman, the Iranian embodiment of evil.48 While some attributions of this figure show the
association of it with the concept of time, no convincing explanations exist so far. Yet
identifying this figure is one of the keys to deciphering the mysteries of Mithras.

3.5.2 History, Distribution Route, and Development of the Cult of Mithras in Rome
The beginning of the practice of the Mithraic cult in the Roman Empire is debated among
scholars, but is agreed to be no later than the second half of the first century AD. An altar from
near Santi Marcellino e Pietro in Rome was inscribed by an Imperial freedman named T. Flavius
Hyginus, probably between 80 and 100 AD. The inscription dedicates the altar to Mithras.49
The earliest military inscription is from the bank of the Danube at Carnuntum, probably before
114 AD.50 This inscription is also a dedication of an altar to Mithras set up by C. Sacidus
Barbarus, a centurion of XV Appolinaris51 who was stationed at Carnuntum, and was also
originally based at Carnuntum. The movements of this legion are particularly informative, as
according to C. M. Daniels, movement of troops was a major factor in the spread of the cult.
Daniels attributes the distribution of the Mithraic cult to the movement of the Roman Army in
the Danube region. Possibly as a result, Italy and the Danube were the two geographical regions
in which Mithraism first struck root.52

In 71–86 AD it moved back in Carnuntum, in 86–105 AD was intermittently in the Dacian wars, then in 105–114 AD back in Carnuntum, and finally it moved to Cappadocia in 114 AD.

3.5.3 Rituals
December 25th – that is, around the winter solstice – is suggested by Vermaseren to be the
birthday of Mithras and a Mithraic festival.53 Other scholars disagree, however, and argue that
there were no public festivals in Roman Mithraism and that the festival around the winter
solstice was Natalis Invicti, a general festival of the Sun.54
Other rituals such as swearing an oath by Mithraic initiates and rituals related to feasting and
eating sacrificial food are suggested to have been associated with Mithraism, based on
archaeological findings from the Mithraic temples55 where the rituals are believed to have been
practiced.56 Considerable numbers of Mithraic temples have been found in Rome, Ostia,
Numidia, Dalmatia, Britain and along the Rhine/Danube frontier, and also in smaller numbers in
Greece, Egypt, and Syria.57
There were several grades among the members of the cult. St. Jerome, a Latin Christian priest of
the fourth and fifth centuries, lists seven grades of initiation into Mithraism.58 Manfred Clauss
associates these grades with the planets and believes that the mosaic found in a Mithraeum in
Ostia depicts these grades along with the planetary symbols of the grades.59 The grades are
believed to be Corax, Corux or Corvex (raven or crow), Nymphus or Nymphobus (bridegroom),

According to Cumont and R. Gordon, the Mithraic cult was for men only.60 Mithraism was very
popular among the soldiers and members of the Roman army but was not limited to particular
members of society.61

91 3.5.4 Classical Literature
The earliest literary references to Roman Mithraism are believed to be by the Latin poet Statius
in about 80 AD and Plutarch in about 100 AD.62 Plutarch (46–127 AD), the Greek biographer,
mentions the practice of the “secret mysteries” of Mithras by Cilician pirates in the southeast of
Anatolia, who were active in the first century BC. In the epic poem Thebaid (80 AD), Statius
pictures Mithras in a cave, wrestling with something that has horns. The cave is described as
persei which is translated as “Persian.”63
The most interesting report is from the second and third century historian Dio Cassius, who tells
of the occasion of the coronation of Tiridates I in Rome by Nero in 66 AD. According to this
account, Tiridates told Nero that he revered him as Mithras.64 As mentioned above, this occasion
was after one of the wars between Parthia and the Roman Empire that was initiated by a power
struggle over Armenia. Tiridates was the Parthian prince, son of the Parthian king Vonones II
and brother of the Parthian king Vologases I, whose coronation in Rome by Nero confirmed the
peace treaty in which the Romans, despite their earlier intention of removing Tiridates from
Armenia, which provoked a war between Parthia and the Roman Empire, agreed to accept him as
the king of Armenia but crowned by the Roman Empire.65 Whether the Roman form of
Mithraism was already popular in Rome or not, recalling the name of Mithras by a Parthian
prince to a Roman Emperor in the event of a coronation as the confirmation of a peace treaty

The Arch of Nero, which did not survive to this date but is depicted on the coins as a four-arch structure having a statue of four horse chariot on top, was also constructed during these politically intense interactions between Parthia and Nero. I suspect this to be one of the first four-arch structures similar to the Iranian chartaqi.



92 between two great powers of the ancient world suggests that the concept of the Persian Mithra
was well known to the two parties. However, the Roman cult of Mithraism could have developed
later based on an independent Roman invention of rituals and iconography in the form of a
popularΝRomanΝcult.ΝRogerΝBeckΝevenΝsuggestsΝthatΝthisΝmomentΝ“could have been a spur to
εithraism’sΝemergenceΝonΝtoΝtheΝlargerΝstageΝofΝpopularΝappeal.”66
In The Cave of the Nymphs (De antro nympharum), Porphyry (third to fourth century AD)
reports on Mithraism and its Persian origins. While it is doubtful that Porphyry had complete
knowledge about Mithraism, his report is of high importance, particularly because he gives clear
references to the astrologicalΝelements.ΝHeΝstatesŚΝ“For, as Eubulus says, Zoroaster was the first
who consecrated in the neighboring mountains of Persia, a spontaneously produced cave, florid,
and having fountains, in honor of Mithra, the maker and father of all things; a cave, according to
Zoroaster, bearing a resemblance of the world, which was fabricated by Mithra. But the things
contained in the cavern being arranged according to commensurate intervals, were symbols of
theΝmundaneΝelementsΝandΝclimates.”67 HeΝalsoΝsaysŚΝ“Hence, a place near to the equinoctial
circle was assigned to Mithra as an appropriate seat. And on this account he bears the sword of
Aries, which is a martial sign. He is likewise carried in the Bull, which is the sign of Venus. For
Mithra, as well as the Bull,ΝisΝtheΝDemiurgusΝandΝlordΝofΝgeneration.”68
Another text in which the name of Mithras is present is a text from the Great Magical Papyrus of
Paris, the so-called Mithras Liturgy. It is part of papyri from Greco-Roman Egypt69 that date

93 from the second century BC to the fifth century AD. The origins of the Mithras Liturgy are
debated as dating between the early first century and the early fourth century.70 Some scholars,
such as Cumont, R. Reitzenstein, and others, have expressed skepticism concerning the Mithraic
origin of the Liturgy.71 The rarity of the Mithraic cult in the Roman province of Egypt also adds
to the doubt that this text is a reproduction of a genuine Mithraic text. However, it gives some
original information about the nature of Mithras and it is possible that some parts were derived
from a Roman Mithraic source.
3.6 Mithra in Kushanas
During the second century AD, the Kushan Empire was the fourth greatest power in the ancient
world, controlling a major part of the trade route from China to the west.72
We can see the Greco-Roman influence on the Kushan Empire. Many Kushan-type coins are
derived from Roman prototypes of the first and second centuries AD.73 During the reigns of
Kanishka and Huvishka, the sixty years during which the power of the Kushan Empire was at its
zenith, Mithra in the form of ΜΙΟΡΟ or ΜΙΙΡΟ was usually used as a figure on the Kushan
coinage.74 However, in concept and ideology, the Iranian influence was much stronger than the

95 Chapter 4 Modern Theories About Mithraism
Franz Cumont was the first scholar systematically to collect all the known archaeological records
and to write a critical history of Mithraism in the Roman Empire.78 He published the first major
scholarship on Roman Mithraism in 1894–1900.79 Cumont believed that Roman Mithraism was
theΝ“RomanΝformΝofΝεazdaism”80 and that the god Mithra came to Rome together with a large
representation of theΝεazdeanΝpantheon.ΝCumont’sΝtheories remained widely accepted by other
scholars for almost seventy years until the first International Congress of Mithraic studies in
1971. After this point the Mithraic Mysteries, which had been believed to be Persian in origin
with no serious question about the matter, were suddenly treated as a new cult that should be
studied almost from scratch. The first congress, along with the second congress in 1975 in
Tehran, was the divergence moment in Mithraic studies towards decades in which the existence
of possible Iranian Mithraic origins for Roman Mithraism was widely ignored. The two
conferences are also very important because many ideas about Mithraism were brought together
and challenged for the first time in these gatherings.
4.1 First Mithraic Conference in 1971
The First Mithraic Conference took place at the University of Manchester in 1971. The
proceedings of the conference, published in 1975, contain some thirty papers. In this congress,
John Hinnells and R. L. GordonΝposedΝsevereΝcriticismΝofΝCumont’sΝtheories.ΝThisΝconferenceΝisΝ
believed to have been aΝturningΝpointΝinΝεithraicΝstudiesΝbecauseΝofΝthisΝreappraisalΝofΝCumont’sΝ

theory.ΝHinnellsΝarguedΝthatΝCumont’sΝreconstructionΝofΝεithraicΝiconographyΝwas not
supported by Iranian texts and was in fact in conflict with known Mazdean theology.81 In his
paperΝ“ReflectionsΝonΝtheΝBull-SlayingΝScene,” Hinnells rejectedΝCumont’sΝinterpretationΝofΝtheΝ
tauroctony, according to which it represented a battle between good and evil or the dualistic
ingredients in the Iranian myth of creation. The serpent and scorpion were interpreted as evil by
Cumont, and Hinnells also rejected the thesis that these images had the same connotation in a
Greco-Roman context as in the Iranian myths.82 Hinnells noted that no Iranian text mentions
bull-slaying in connection with any Iranian god or ritual. He suggests instead that Mithraic art
“preservesΝancientΝIranianΝideasΝofΝsacrificeΝandΝsalvationΝbutΝnotΝexpressedΝthroughΝIranianΝ
motifs”śΝthe motifs and imagery are drawn, rather, from Greco-Roman symbolism.83
Gordon posed an even more fundamental criticism and claimed that Cumont forced the available
material and evidence to conform to his model of Zoroastrian origins for the cult of Mithra.
Gordon suggested instead that Roman Mithraism was an entirely new religion with no Persian
origins. He claimed that Cumont was wrong to choose Zoroastrianism, or a version of it, as his
model for western Mithraism.84 Based on the work of Stig Wikander, Gordon rejects the idea
that Mithras and Anahita formed a pair in Anatolia, and that Roman Mithraism is evidenced in
any epigraphic, archaeological or literary material relating to Persian cults in Anatolia until after
the first century. He also argues that the identification proposed by Cumont between Iranian
yazatas and Olympian gods occurring on Mithraic reliefs should be rejected. However, he does
notΝagreeΝwithΝWikander’sΝargumentΝthatΝRomanΝεithraismΝwasΝaΝBalkanΝcult.ΝTheΝintroductionΝ

97 of a leontocephaline god as the symbol for the Iranian god of eternal time by Cumont is also
rejected by Gordon.85 He saysŚΝ“weΝoughtΝtoΝstartΝwithΝtheΝhypothesisΝthatΝRomanΝorΝWesternΝ
Mithraism is an independent religion; our interest ought to be fixed first not on the question of
where it came from but rather on its own symbolic structure. We must try to discover what kind
ofΝsenseΝweΝcanΝmakeΝofΝ[it]ΝbyΝusingΝwesternΝevidence.”86 Gordon sees in Roman Mithraism a
selection and manipulation of elements of foreign culture for a particular intellectual and social
purpose.
None of these scholars proposed a new model to explain Roman Mithraism. However, after 1971
a few scholars continued to maintain that new theories about Zoroastrianism should allow for
some form of transfer from the east to the Roman Empire.87
The identity of the lion-headed figure of Mithraic iconography was also treated in several of the
papers of the conference. Cumont had identified this figure with the Iranian god Zurvan. This
view was maintained by Vermaseren,88 who, however, also identified an Egyptian influence

86 John R. Hinnells, ed., Mithraic Studies: Proceedings of the First International Congress of Mithraic Studies, 2 vols (Manchester: Manchester University Press ND, 1975), 2:352. 87 “[A]n indubitable residuum of things Persian in the Mysteries and a better knowledge of what constituted actual Mazdaism have allowed modern scholars to postulate for Roman Mithraism a continuing Iranian theology. This indeed is the main line of Mithraic scholarship, the Cumontian model which subsequent scholars accept, modify, or reject. For the transmission of Iranian doctrine from East to West, Cumont postulated a plausible, if hypothetical, intermediary: the Magusaeans of the Iranian diaspora in Anatolia. More problematic, and never properly addressed by Cumont or his successors, is how real-life Roman Mithraists subsequently maintained a quite complex and sophisticated Iranian theology behind an occidental facade. Other than the images at Dura of the two ‘magi’ with scrolls, there is no direct and explicit evidence for the carriers of such doctrines.... Up to a point,

J.ΝP.ΝKane,ΝinΝ“TheΝεithraicΝCultΝεealΝinΝItsΝGreekΝandΝRoman Environment,”91 argued that

drinking its blood as was formerly mentioned by Vermaseren.

claims that Vermaseren gave no exact references or documentation for this observation. Lenz
also mentions the work of Campbell96 inΝaΝchapterΝcalledΝ“The ZodiacΝandΝεithraicΝτrientation,”Ν
in which Campbell investigates the direction of the tauroctony in Mithraeum, the way light falls
on the image at certain times, and the order and position of zodiacal signs represented in certain
Mithraea. Lenz tries to explore along the same lines but in more depth, providing some
interesting hypotheses. He claims that CampbellΝ“tries to establish an ‘ideal’ type of Mithraeum.
It should be circular (two instances) or elliptical (one instance) and, as we have just seen,
oriented in the technical sense of the word, i.e. directed towards prominent (equinoctial or
solstitial)ΝpointsΝofΝtheΝhorizon.”97 While not reaching a general formula for the design of
Mithraea, Lenz provides examples of the possibility of an astronomical use of several openings
in certain Mithraea and the possibility of light reflection techniques or illumination of other
monuments in Mithraea. He also suggests a possible relationship between the order and position
of the elements of certain tauroctony scenes and the light beam. He does not say much about the
possibility of observations of stars in Mithraea because his main focus is on illumination by the
sunΝorΝtheΝmoon.ΝHowever,ΝheΝputsΝforwardΝaΝveryΝimportantΝproblemŚΝ“theΝsearchΝforΝtracesΝofΝ

4.2 The Second International Congress of Mithraic Studies in 1975
The second congress on Mithraic Studies took place in Tehran in 1975, sponsored by the
Imperial Pahlavi Library. This congress brought together different disciplines and was a unique
encounter between scholars in Greco-Roman and Oriental Archaeology, Linguistics, History of
Religion, Iranian Studies, and the Parsi tradition. Since the divergence among occidental and
oriental scholarship on Mithraism had become evident in the conference of 1971, this encounter
raised practical problems in finding a common basis for discussion. Most of the papers of the
1975 conference can be categorized as treating either the “eastern” Mithra/Mitra or the “western”

Mithras.100 The theories of Cumont about the continuity of Mazdean theology and Roman
Mithraism were also increasingly challenged.
Some papers approach the name Mithra(s) and the Mithraic literature with a philological and
linguistic analysis. The name Mithra itself, which was at least agreed to have an eastern origin,
was one of the core questions for a few scholars. H. P. Schmidt claimedΝthatΝ“theΝprimeΝaimΝofΝaΝ
mitra in Indo-Iranian times was the establishment of peace which guaranteed life and prosperity.
This accounts for quite a number of the functions of the deity personifyingΝtheΝconcept.”101 He
suggests that mithra means “alliance,” fitting with his search for a “concept” rather than a deity
as the meaning of this term. The Indo-European roots of the name also suggest “friendship,”
“contract,” and “loyalty.” Giulio Bonfante also addresses the question of the meaning of the
nameΝεithra.ΝHeΝsuggestsΝthatΝ“theΝcauseΝofΝtheΝetymologicalΝaffinity,ΝnayΝidentityΝofΝmithrah
(the god), mithrah (the friend), mithram (the contract) becomes now clear: mithram is the oldest
word,ΝwhichΝbyΝpersonificationΝandΝduplicationΝ(...)ΝbecameΝtheΝgodΝmithrah....”ΝHeΝclaimsΝthatΝ
inΝIranΝ“theΝpersonificationΝofΝtheΝgodΝwhoΝwasΝmuchΝmoreΝimportantΝthanΝinΝIndiaΝ(...)ΝwentΝsoΝ
far as to replace the ancient neuter mithram.”102
The etymological and philological approach to the problem is very important, but could be
reductionist, focusing too much on the meanings and concepts of terms, explaining the
mythological and religious functions merely as the personification or the divinization process of
the concept. Nonetheless, this approach contributes to finding the historical and geographical
distribution path of the myths and their original social functions. Jaan Pahvel also pursues this

“oath” and the reinforcement of the contract, while the Vedic Mitra carries the sense of “peace
giver.”103
Paul Thieme,ΝinΝ“εithraΝinΝtheΝAvesta,”ΝinvestigatesΝtheΝlinguisticΝandΝ“poetical” elaboration of
Mithra in the old Iranian scripts. He contrasts Mithra with Anahita (another Iranian deity) and
acknowledgesΝthatΝ“εithraΝisΝmadeΝresponsibleΝforΝfurtherΝblessings,ΝwhichΝareΝnotΝtheΝ
immediateΝeffectΝofΝtheΝsafetyΝofΝpeace.”104
DespiteΝitsΝtitle,Ν“TheΝRoutesΝofΝEarlyΝεithraism”ΝbyΝPer Beskow is not interested in the route of
distribution of Mithraism from Iran, but instead accepts the new trend in Mithraic studies based
onΝtheΝisolationΝofΝRomanΝεithraismΝasΝaΝnewΝreligion.ΝBeskowΝbelievesΝthatΝ“ifΝweΝwantΝtoΝ
establish the routes of Mithraist expansion, we have to start within the Roman Empire and
consider those regional varieties that appear in the monuments, and which seem to reflect
differentΝstagesΝinΝtheΝhistoryΝofΝtheΝcult.”105 He looks at minor differences among Mithraic
iconography from different regions and follows the distribution path of Roman Mithraism within
the Roman empire.
Another problem in the study of Mithraism is identifying the companion deities of Mithra. The
Indic Mithra is accompanied by Varuna in the Vedic texts and the Iranian Mithra is accompanied
byΝVarahran.ΝUgoΝBianchi,ΝinΝ“εithraΝandΝIranianΝεonotheism,”ΝlooksΝatΝεithraΝinΝtheΝIndo

103 and play a different role based on the deformation of concepts. One important question that
Bianchi addresses is the connection of the VedicΝdeitiesΝIndraΝandΝVrthragna.ΝHeΝsaysŚΝ“HereΝweΝ
must avoid two extremes, opposite positions: the one represented by Widengren, according to
whichΝtheΝIranianΝVərəΘraΥna is but a connection of Indra vrtrahan; and the other represented
by Thieme, on the path of Benveniste and Renou, according to which VərəΘraΥna, who
accompanies the fighting Mithra in the Mihr Yasht, in the shape of a wild boar, was replaced by
IndraΝinΝtheΝRigveda....ΝSoΝVrtraghnaΝwasΝamalgamatedΝwithΝIndraΝinΝtheΝRigveda.”106
Any minute findings are of precious value in this field, and John Andrew Boyle mentions an
Armenian folk story that seems to preserve a pre-Christian Mithraism on the one hand and is
connected to ancient Iran on the other hand. In this story the hero, called Mher, is asked to go
andΝfindΝtheΝraven’sΝrockΝinΝorderΝtoΝbeΝsavedΝfromΝevil.ΝInΝaΝpartΝofΝtheΝstory,Ν“heΝcameΝtoΝaΝgreatΝ
rock that was called the Carved Rock. The rock opened like a cave. He looked, the raven had
goneΝinside....ΝTheΝdoorΝclosedΝandΝheΝwithΝhisΝhorseΝwasΝleftΝinside....ΝToΝthisΝdayΝεherΝandΝhisΝ
horse are still hale and hearty. Night and day one candle burns on either side. To this day Mher

asΝlargeΝasΝaΝhipΝandΝaΝbarleycornΝisΝasΝbigΝasΝaΝplum.”ΝBoyleΝmentionsΝthat the poem ends with
Mher contemplating the Chaxri Felek, which is probably a corruption of the Persian expression
charx-i-falak, “the celestial sphere.” In this part:

εherΝisΝthere,ΝinsideΝtheΝcaveΝinΝtheΝVanΝRock.ΝItΝisΝalsoΝcalledΝεher’sΝDoor.Ν
Cuneiform writing is engraved deep on the door of the rock. The Chaxri-Felek is
turning inside this rock. It is a sign of the sun which soars and turns day and night,
which, like the fiery horse, flies up and up. This is the soaring wheel of the terrestrial
globe, and Mher is always watching it. When this wheel stops one day and turns no
more,Νεher’sΝDoorΝwillΝopen.ΝThenΝεherΝwillΝbeΝfreedΝandΝwillΝcomeΝoutΝandΝwillΝ
ravage the world. But when shall we see this? When the world comes to an end?108
This story, as a piece of folklore, might be mixed up with stereotypes of a folk story, but the
elements of the story and the way they are ordered strongly suggests a deep connection with an
ancient myth in which the rock, raven, cave, and the cosmos are related to a hiding/sleeping hero
who will appear at the end of the cosmic cycle.
AhmadΝH.ΝDani,ΝinΝ“εithraismΝandΝεaitreya,”ΝidentifiesΝεithraΝwithΝtheΝsun-god and suggests
that by the time of the Kushanas the new concept of the sun-god had crept into India. He
suggests different forms of Mithra, from one of which is derived the Maitreya while the original
Mithra was absorbed into growing Buddhism in Gandhara.
Interestingly, Dani cites Bivar and mentions the confusion between Zeus, Helios, and Mithra in
RomanΝiconographyŚΝ“There is a general confusion between the Iranian Mithra and Zeus. Bivar
calls Helios, appearing on the coin of Plato, Mithra. Lahiri notes four types of Helios shown on

SusanΝB.ΝDowneyΝfocusesΝonΝtheΝ“SyrianΝImagesΝofΝεithrasΝTauroctonos”ΝandΝmaintainsΝthatΝtheΝ
origins of Roman Mithraism are confusing and subject to speculation. She reports that despite
the relative proximity of Syria to Iran, all of the Mithraic evidence in Syria is late and could not
have arrived in Syria earlier than in Rome. She pays attention to characteristics of Syrian and
Mesopotamian Mithraic iconography and suggests that the differences of these from other
categories of Roman Mithraic iconography might be the result of local gods and symbols. Also
inΝaΝreportΝonΝtheΝDuraΝεithraeumΝ(locatedΝinΝSyria)ΝinΝherΝpaper,ΝDowneyΝcitesΝCampbellŚΝ“InΝ

sides; the decoration, both painted and sculptured, formed a coherent whole, In the soffit of the
arch of the late Mithraeum were painted the signs of the zodiac. Apparently arranged in the
‘eastern’ order.”110
Jacques Duchesne-Guillemin talks about the Iranian and Greek presence in Commagene, where
is found not only evidence of early Roman Mithraism, but also the first record of the name of
Mithra along with some other Vedic companions of Mithra such as Varuna and Indra. These
were written in a peace treaty between the Hittites and the Mittanis on the Mittani side. Among
several speculations the author also investigates the relationship between the Iranian Zurvan and
the Greek Aion and Chronos.111

106 Richard N. Frye looks at archaeological evidence of Mithra in Iran. He identifies some
Sassanid figures as personifications of Mithra. Mithra was well known to the Sassanids and they
swore oaths to Mithra, but anthropomorphic representation of Mithra is not a common tradition
inΝIran.ΝFryeΝclaimsΝ“thereΝisΝoneΝsymbol,ΝmostlyΝfoundΝonΝseals,ΝwhichΝmayΝrelateΝtoΝεithra,ΝandΝ
that is a chariot pulled by two or more winged horses. One such seal in Berlin shows a bust with
rays coming from the head above the chariot and flying horses, with an inscription giving the
name humitra.... In Mithra Yasht the deity is described in terms understandable as riding on a
chariotΝorΝquadriga,ΝandΝtheΝiconographyΝofΝtheΝsealsΝcouldΝthusΝreferΝtoΝtheΝYasht.”112 He also
identifies the quadriga pulled by winged horses in the cave of a small Buddha of thirty-five
meters in height in Bamian, and believes that despite the fact that this quadriga was declared by
several scholars, such as Y. Godard and J. Hackin, to represent the moon god, the iconography
fits Mithra very well. Frye suggests that ambiguities in understanding the symbol of the quadriga
would indicate that by the late Sassanid era, people probably thought little about any original
meaning of the quadriga. Frye also mentions some remains and influences of Mithraic
terminology in later periods and other languages. For example, the word mehrjan, which means
“festival” to Arabs and some Syrians, is the Arabic pronunciation of mehrgan (the festival of
mehr), or dar-i-mehr, the “door of Mithra,” which is used in the call to the fire temple by
Zoroastrians (this word is repeated in the Armenian folklore discussed by Boyle).113
Jalaladdin Imam-Jomeh searches for physical evidence of Mithraea in Iran and suggests a
building in Takht-e-Soleyman in northwest Iran as a possible Mithraeum. This site was an
important Sassanid royal and religious site, but was sacred even before the Sassanids. The
112 Richard N. Frye, “εithraΝinΝIranianΝArchaeology,”Νin Étude Mithriaque, 210. 113 Frye, “εithraΝinΝIranianΝArchaeology,”Ν205–212.



107 building that Imam-Jomeh suggests as potentially a Mithraeum is not the main hall of the
well-known fire temple of Azar-Goshasp, but the other adjacent building which resembles the
basilicas of the early Christians. In his view this may have housed Takht-e-Taqdis, a reported
planetarium or astronomical/astrological center in Iran that is extensively talked about by
medieval writers. Whether or not this particular building is the same famous Takht-e-Taqdis,
relating this issue to Mithraism and finding parallels for Mithraic temples in Iran is important.
Imam-Jomeh quotes several historical sources, including Tha’alebyΝofΝσeishaburΝ(960–1037
CE),ΝwhoΝclaimsŚΝ“TheΝvaultΝofΝtakht-e-taqdis was dark blue on which the constellations, stars,
ZodiacΝSigns,ΝasΝwellΝasΝtheΝsevenΝClimatesΝwereΝshown...śΝThereΝwasΝaΝgadgetΝtellingΝtheΝtimeΝ
in day and night. There were four hugeΝcarpetsΝreflectingΝtheΝsceneryΝofΝtheΝyear’sΝseasons.”114
As cited by Imam-Jomeh, Ali ben Husain Masudi (tenth centuryΝCE)ΝmaintainsΝthatŚΝ“InΝtheΝ
debris of the buildings at Shiz (Takht-e-Solaiman), the excavator may find remains of marvelous
colored pictures representing the celestial bodies, the stars, the earth with its continents and its
oceans...”115 In 1010 CE Ferdowsi claimed in ShahnamahŚΝ“ThereΝwereΝotherΝpaintingΝscenesΝofΝ
theΝpeopleΝfromΝallΝwalksΝofΝlifeΝ...ΝthereΝexistedΝhugeΝmovableΝcurtainsΝthrough which they
showed movements of the heavenly bodies. When the sun was shining from behind the throne,
gardens appeared in front, and plains from behind. When the sun shone in the sign of Leo, the
throneΝhadΝitsΝbackΝtowardsΝit.”ΝAndΝ“TheΝtwelveΝsignsΝand the seven movables were also
demonstrated. They showed the moon in the sign in which it set, some stars stayed on and some
passed by. You saw before your eyes the phenomena of the sky. You saw how much time had
already expired, also how much of the heavens revolved round the earth. Similarly, the

108
movementsΝofΝtheΝplanets,ΝtheΝsunΝandΝtheΝmoonΝwereΝvividlyΝshownΝacrossΝtheΝsky.”116
Imam-Jomeh dose not answer the problem of the connection of Takaht-e-Taqdis to Roman
Mithraea but at least encourages archaeologists to find parallels in Iran and to consider
astronomical evidence in Iranian studies.
Michael P. Speidel talks about a particular case in which contact between the Iranian Mehr and
the Roman Mithra is possible. This contact is reduced to the contact of two armies in Dura
Europos where the Romans took a Parthian fortress. Speidel suggests that this makes the transfer
of Mithra to Rome possible from their Parthian enemies, and points out that the Magi at Dura
Europos were members of the Roman army.117
Mithra, in the form of Mihr-Yazd, is also a Manichaean divinity. Because of the syncretic nature
of Manichaean theology, its divine elements were borrowed from existing religions in the east. In
the Manichean pantheon, Mihr (Mehr) may have had only a restricted connection with the
original divinity, as we can see in Zoroastrian sources. W. Sundermann, inΝ“SomeΝεoreΝRemarksΝ
onΝεithraΝinΝtheΝεanichaeanΝPantheon,”ΝsearchesΝforΝtheΝeschatologicalΝnatureΝofΝεithraΝthroughΝ
Manichaean sources and traces the reflections of the original Mithra in this worldview. The
interesting point that he brings up is the reference to the Zurvanite Mithra by Plutarch.
SundermannΝclaimsŚΝ“AccordingΝtoΝBenveniste,ΝPlutarchΝ(aboutΝ46–120ΝCE)ΝcalledΝȂίΘȡηȢΝtheΝ

Plutarch and reported by him on the authority of Theopompus.119 This led Benveniste to the
conclusionΝthatΝ“theΝwholeΝtext”ΝasΝit hasΝbeenΝhandedΝdownΝbyΝPlutarchΝ“mustΝhenceforthΝbeΝ
regarded as an authentic and ancient exposition of Zurvanism. By Theopompus who is quoted,
and by Eudemus who perhaps inspired it, it takes us back to the fourth century B.C.120 Even if
the Zurvanite purport of the myth is doubtful at least, its pre-Manichaean origin is well
established.”121 Sundermann also connects this Plutarch with the Znad I Wahuman Yasht. He
continuesŚΝ“IfΝBenveniste’sΝandΝZaehner’sΝinterpretationsΝofΝtheΝaboveΝquotedΝPlutarch-passage
are right, Mani might have known about a Zoroastrian myth according to which Mihr-Yazd
brings about a treaty between Ohrmazd and Ahriman. Although acting as an impartial mediator
he actually saves Ohrmazd from the onslaught of the dark powers and will finally contribute to
τhrmazd’sΝvictory.”122 Sundermann seeks the remains of the original Mithra in the Manichaean
form that appears later in the Sassanid era.
Paul Thieme looks at Mithra in the Avesta and seeks the exact meanings of Avestan words
related to Mithra. His approach is more descriptive than analytic and he is concerned with the
meanings and poetic manifestations more than the mythical concepts and the cosmological
origins of the terms.123
The Roman lion-headed Mithraic figure is a naked man with human body, entwined by a snake
with a lion head and an open mouth, giving a frightening impression. He usually has four wings,
one or two keys, and a scepter in each hand. In some cases he is standing on the cosmic sphere.

110 Rarely, he is also shown with a human head. This figure is restricted to Mithraic iconography
and, among Mithraic artefacts, is almost as important as the tauroctony. The details and attributes
of this mysterious figure are even more complicated to decode and interpret than the other
figures and therefore its identity remains highly controversial; however it is crucial to decoding
the mystery of Mithraism. Cumont identified this figure with the Iranian Zurvan because of
direct symbolic references to the concept of time in this figure. He suggests that it has an
Egyptian origin corresponding with the Greek Aion and or Greco-Phoenician Kronos.124 Like
other interpretations by Cumont this was generally rejected by the new trend of scholars.
Duchesne-Guillemin suggests that both Aion and Ahriman are represented by the lion-headed
figure.125 Bivar also suggests a connection with Nergal, the Mesopotamian underworld god.126
John Hansman follows Hinnells, who had suggested that this figure is a being who presides over
the ascent of the planetary ladder by the souls, and introduces the lion-headed god as a possible
“divineΝsoulΝinspiredΝinΝpartΝbyΝtheΝspeculativeΝwritingsΝofΝclassicalΝGreekΝphilosophy.”127
Hubertus Von Gall focuses on this figure. He believes that Cumont was influenced by Georg
Zoëga, who first introduced this figure as the parallel to the Greek god Aion.128 Gall also points
out that Cumont believes in the identity of Aion with theΝIranianΝgodΝZurvanΝandΝtheΝ“originΝofΝ
things.”129 While Cumont sees this figure as identical to Kronos and Aion and thus Zurvan
because of the aspects of the time god in this figure, Gall sees this argument as highly
improbable.ΝHeΝsaysŚΝ“noneΝofΝtheΝGreek inscribed monuments show Aion winged and entwined

111
byΝaΝsnake,ΝnorΝdoesΝaΝsnakeΝaccompanyΝthisΝgod.”130 He also rejects the idea that this god is
identical to the Iranian Zurvan, based on the great Greek formula for the abjuration of
Manichaeism in which the Manichaean Supreme God, the so-called Father of Greatness, is
described as tetraprosopos, which means in its exact translation “four-faced.” GallΝsaysŚΝ“σowΝ
the designation of the four-fold god Zurvan as tetraprosopos, the Latin equivalent of which
would be quadrifrons, points clearly towards a conception of a multiheaded god. If we accept
this it would be incomprehensible that the followers of Mithraism in looking for a figurative type
for Zurvan – if they really ventured that principle in their temples – would not have adopted the
typeΝofΝIanusΝquadrifronsΝsoΝreadilyΝatΝhandΝinΝImperialΝRomeΝandΝalsoΝaΝrealΝtimeΝgod.”131
Cumont may have jumped to conclusions in claiming that this figure with time god attributes
should be an exact parallel to an Iranian or Greek time god, but the relationship between this
figure and the concepts behind Iranian and Greek time gods is highly probable. Gall suggests a
similarity rather than a difference between these figures.
GallΝdisagreesΝwithΝZaehner’sΝviewΝofΝtheΝleontocephalicΝdemonΝasΝtheΝ“princeΝofΝthisΝworldΝ
Ahriman”ΝrulingΝoverΝtheΝelementsΝandΝbelievesΝthatΝtheΝfigureΝcannotΝhaveΝanΝevil character like
the Iranian Ahriman. He mentions a figure in CIMRM (monument 849): a relief in Vienna
standing between the Dioscuri (the Greco-Roman twin brothers) as the typical savior god of
Roman Mithraism.132 As he points out, we cannot demonize this figure just because of its snake
and terrifying face, for this figure has also occurred with a human face, has no other demonic
characteristics, and would be an important object in a Mithraeum. Terrifying figures in
mythological symbolism may also reflect the power of a savior god facing demons and enemies.

112 4.3 Mithraic Studies Today
In the past, the majority of scholars maintained that Mithras was nothing other than a typical sun
god, although the distinction between Sol, the Roman sun god (or Helios in its Greco-Roman
form) and Mithras is clear in Roman Mithraic iconography. Furthermore, the Persian Mithra is
not called a sun god according to the Mihr Yasht of the Avesta; instead he is described as a
young man who stands in the high end of the north sky, on the Alborz mountains, restlessly
watching and listening with his thousand eyes and thousand ears, and who appears before the
sunrise and after the sunset.
The modern astrological reconstructions for interpreting Mithraic iconography suffer from a self
referential hypothetical nature and do not draw an acceptable framework for describing the vital
symbolic meaning of the particular selection of astrological symbols in Mithraic theology. While
at the extreme end of the spectrum, scholars like Ulansey seek a solid astronomical model for
Mithraism, Roger Beck takes a moderate and equivocal position in using astrological models. At
the other end of the spectrum, some other scholars even see astrology and astronomy as outside
the context of Mithraism, despite the fact that the Mithraic iconography appears to be nothing
other than a collection of astrological symbols. In Mithraic studies, near-acceptance of one
argument about the origins of Mithraism often requires exclusion or disqualification of the
others.



113 4.4 Roger Beck
I must briefly introduce Roger Beck, a Canadian scholar who wrote extensively on Mithraism
among the post-Cumontian scholars. He published a collection of his works (titled Beck on
Mithraism) in 2004 in the introduction of which he drew conclusions from his approach to the
problem of Mithraism. He argues that Mithraism should no longer be considered as a single
doctrineΝandΝsaysŚΝ“ThatΝεithraismΝhadΝanythingΝlikeΝaΝsystematicΝandΝcoherentΝbodyΝofΝ
teaching, transmitted to the initiates as a necessary element of the mysteries or guarded by the
FathersΝasΝarcane,ΝIΝnoΝlongerΝconsiderΝtenable.”133 Instead of a single doctrine for Mithraism he
suggestsΝ“aΝlooseΝnetworkΝofΝcosmological,ΝtheologicalΝandΝstereologicalΝideasΝwhichΝwereΝ
expressed, transmitted and apprehended symbolically in the iconography of the monuments, the
designΝofΝεithraea,ΝtheΝperformanceΝofΝrituals.”134 He emphasizes on apprehension of symbols as
aΝmethodologyΝinΝtheΝformΝofΝsymbolistΝanthropology.ΝHeΝbelievesΝthatΝ“aΝcomplexΝofΝsymbols
cannotΝbeΝreadΝoffΝlikeΝanΝencodedΝmessageΝonceΝoneΝfindsΝtheΝkey.”135 Instead, he believes the
potential of the new “cognitive science of religion” for the exploration of ancient religions is
immense and should be considered as an approach to apprehend the Mithraic symbology.136
Beck, like most of the recent scholars of Mithraism, agrees with the importance of astronomy
and astrology but suggests astronomy and astrology as medium, not message. He says that these
disciplinesΝ“conveyΝesotericΝtruthsΝabout Mithras and Mithras-dominated universe, but those
esotericΝtruthsΝareΝnotΝthemselves,ΝatΝleastΝforΝtheΝmostΝpart,ΝastronomicalΝorΝastrological.”137

4.5 David Ulansey’s Astronomical Framework: A Controversial Theory
David Ulansey was inspired by Roger Beck and the linguist Stanley Insler and was the first, after
the conference of 1971, to suggest a new approach to decoding Mithraic iconography based on
astrology.138 Ulansey also insists that Roman Mithraism has no considerable reference to the
Persian Mithra, based on criticisms of Cumont’sΝεazdaean theory by Gordon and Hinnells, and
seeksΝtheΝoriginsΝofΝεithraismΝinΝAsiaΝεinorΝbasedΝonΝStoicΝknowledgeΝofΝastronomy.ΝPlutarch’sΝ
report on the pirates of Cilicia plays a significant role for Ulansey in justifying the western
origins of Roman Mithraism.
UlanseyΝthinksΝthatΝCumont’sΝtheoryΝledΝtoΝtheΝtruthΝofΝεithraismΝbeingΝveiledΝforΝseventyΝyearsΝ
under the guise of Iranian religion and Roman Mithraic iconography. Cumont was aware of the
astrological symbolism in Roman Mithraic artifacts but considered these symbols to represent a
Hellenized and artistic imaginative depiction of Mazdaean concepts rather than star maps. That
these symbols had already been suggested as a star map even before Cumont, by K. B. Stark in
1869, used to be commonly ignored until 1970s.139
Ulansey’sΝfirstΝobjectionΝtoΝCumontΝisΝtheΝlackΝofΝaΝtauroctonousΝcounterpartΝinΝRomanΝεithrasΝ
forΝtheΝIranianΝεithra.ΝUlanseyΝrepeatsΝεichaelΝSpeidel’sΝquestionΝaboutΝfindingΝaΝcorrespondingΝ
constellation for Mithras as the bull-slayer,ΝbutΝisΝnotΝconvincedΝbyΝSpeidel’sΝsuggestionΝthatΝ
εithrasΝisΝτrion.ΝHeΝarguesΝthat,ΝbasedΝonΝSpeidel’sΝmodel,ΝAriesΝandΝδibraΝshouldΝhaveΝbeenΝinΝ
the equatorial group instead of Taurus and Scorpio.140 He suggests Taurus and Scorpio as the
equinoctial constellations around the second millennium BC, and suggests that Mithras instead

115 corresponds to Perseus. He believes that this concept originated in Asia Minor and developed
in Rome as a new cult.141 Because the constellation Perseus is located above the constellation
Taurus in the sky and is often anthropomorphized as a young man with a Phrygian cap, Ulansey
takes this constellation as the bull-slayer of the tauroctony. He suggests that the Phrygian cap of
Perseus is the result of the belief in Greek mythology of the connection of Perseus with the
Persians, a belief that was a mere mythological construction. Ulansey also sees the lion-headed
god as a parallel to the Greek Gorgon, who is killed by Perseus. Despite the fact that Gorgon has
no lion head in Greek iconography and has a feminine character, Ulansey tries to find similarities
and connect Gorgon to the Mithraic figure.
Relying on a report of Plutarch about the distribution of Roman Mithraism from a Cilician
origin, Ulansey also seeks a secret cult in Cilicia in which Perseus plays a significant role to
justify his argument. He suggests the bull and scorpion as the equinoctial constellations of the
age of Taurus-Scorpio and the tauroctony as derived from a bull-scorpion symbol from two
millennia before the emergence of Roman Mithraism as equinoctial astrologic symbol. He puts
the lion and the cup in a separate group among the symbols of the tauroctony and suggests that
these symbols represent Leo and Aquarius, the solstitial constellations of the age of Taurus
Scorpio. Ulansey claims that the cup and lion generally appear together in the Danube and Rhine
areas only.
Ulansey prefers not to relate the cup to Crater despite the fact that the cup seems to be an
obvious representation of Crater in the tauroctony. From his argument it is obvious that Ulansey
struggles between assigning the symbol of the cup in the tauroctony to Aquarius (in order to
141 Ulansey, Origins of the Mithraic Mysteries, 93–94.



116 complete a solstitial pair corresponding to his Taurus-Scorpio equinoctial model) and losing
Crater from his equatorial club of constellations.142
Interestingly, the wheat ear that forms the tail of the bull or the blood of the bull in the
tauroctony is not considered by Ulansey as an astrological symbol, although it represents Spica,
the brightest star of the constellation Virgo, in Greco-Roman symbolism. Ulansey acts
selectively in the interpretation of the wheat ear and the cup to complete his own framework,
which considers Spica as the symbol of the spring and the revival of nature growing from the
bull as the sign of spring equinox in the tauroctony.143
In order to justify his claim that the bull and scorpion in the tauroctony are the equinoctial
constellations,ΝUlanseyΝtakesΝupΝPorphyry’sΝreportΝinΝCave of the Nymphs that Mithraists
dedicated the equinoctial points to the seat of Mithras. In the same passage Porphyry says that
Mithras rides the bull, which is Taurus, and bears the sword of Aries. Ulansey believes that
Porphyry was confused when he was talking about the equinoctial points, which were in Aries
and Libra in his own time, and that because of lack of knowledge of Mithraism. Porphyry tries to
bring Aries to his report by himself.144 This is another selective method used by Ulansey to
ignore constellations other than those that fit his own framework.
Ulansey interprets the Mithraic torch-bearers as the symbols of equinoxes, particularly when
equinoxes were at Taurus and Scorpio. His example for this proposal is a reconstruction of an
artifact (CIMRM 335) in which there are two trees in the background in the same place as Cautes
and Cautopates (the torch-bearers). In this image, on the tree on the right side there is a torch
142 Ulansey, Origins of the Mithraic Mysteries, 52–53. 143 Ulansey, Origins of the Mithraic Mysteries, 54–55. 144 Ulansey, Origins of the Mithraic Mysteries, 59–62.



117 facing upwards and the sign of a bull, and beside the other tree there is a torch facing
downwards and the sign of the scorpion. The tree on the right has leaves and the tree on the left
has fruit. Ulansey does not give any further explanation why the torch-bearers are also wearing
Phrygian caps.
By accepting the hypothesis that Roman Mithraism originated in Cilicia, Ulansey demonstrates
the importance of Stoic philosophy in Tarsus, and later relates Tarsus to the pirates of Cilicia and
the obsession of the Stoics with astronomy. Ulansey mentions how the Stoics believed in the
great year of the universe (a cycle of time that was believed to be the age of the universe from
beginning to end) and tries to give a number to this period. However, he admits that this notion
was not confined to the Stoics and was well known to Iranians, Indians, and Babylonians. He
argues that according to historians of science, the astronomic phenomenon of the precession of
equinoxes was first discovered by the Greek astronomer Hipparchus in 128 BC and that his ideas
reached the Stoics in Cilicia, who were already obsessed with astronomy. According to Ulansey
the Stoics constructed a secret cult inspired by this discovery and developed an iconography
based on the equinoxes at Taurus-Scorpio as a symbol of this cult using their advanced
knowledge of the precession of equinoxes. Then, because the constellation Perseus is located
above Taurus, Perseus became the killer of the bull. Ulansey suggests that the discovery of
Hipparchus remained a secret for the early Mithraists of Cilicia and, because of the complexity
of understanding the precession of equinoxes, the teachings of this phenomenon became
available only to those admitted to the higher ranks in the cult.
Hipparchus’Νdiscovery is known among historians of science because of a report about this
discovery by Ptolemy. Yet some historians even doubt that we can interpret what Hipparchus



118 says as a theory for the precession of equinoxes. Noel Swerdlow criticizes Ulansey for this
reason.145 Furthermore, knowledge of astrological ages, the great cycle of the universe, and
changes of equinoxes could have been accessible to some ancient civilizations long before
Hipparchus, as some other historians have argued.146
After all this, there remains another problem for which Ulansey must provide an answer. If
Perseus is the god who kills the bull to show the end of the age of Taurus, and if this was because
of the location of the constellation Perseus in relation to Taurus, which is visible to all, why did
Mithraists choose Mithras as a substitute for Perseus and why are there no names for Perseus in
Mithraic literature? Ulansey believes that the pronunciation of the name Perseus connects him to
Persia and that the relationship between Mithridates VI of Pontus, who had Iranian ancestors,
with the Cilician pirates makes Mithridates VI a hero for the Cilicians, who believed he was a
descendant of Perseus. As evidence for this claim, Ulansey refers to coinage in which both
Mithridates and Perseus appeared. According to Ulansey the Cilicians then took the name
Mithras from the first part of the name Mithridates, which means literally ‘the gift of Mithra.’
Ulansey also mentions a symbol in which a bull is being hunted by a lion as the symbol of the
city of Tarsus. He sees this as an old sign for the fight between winter and summer when Leo
was the solstitial constellation,ΝcitingΝWillyΝHartner.ΝAccordingΝtoΝHartner’sΝargument,ΝwhichΝisΝ
very loose, the two constellations are visible in winter, but after the winter solstice, when the sun
moves towards Taurus, and after the spring equinox, when it covers Taurus by its light, only the

Godine Publisher, 1977).



119
lion remains visible until the summer solstice.147 Ulansey puts this sign in the category of the
bull and scorpion, for which there was no astrological explanation in the time of the Stoics.
Hartner never admits that the hunted bull, which is an important symbol for the Persians and can
be seen everywhere in Persepolis, could carry the same meaning as the sacrificed Mithraic bull in
relation to the sign of a passed astrological age; instead he pushes the evidence to accord with his
own framework.
Ulansey identifies Mithras as a cosmic creator god who controls the cosmic order, because for
the new cult that he introduces there is a vacuum of a deity higher than Helios or Sol. He even
suggests that Sol Invictus, meaning “the unconquered sun,” is another name for Mithras
himself.148
WhileΝUlansey’sΝopinionΝaboutΝεithrasΝbeingΝtheΝgodΝofΝcosmicΝorder,ΝparticularlyΝtakingΝtheΝ
precession of equinoxes into account, is highly valuable and original, his ignorance of Persian
and other eastern cosmologies and his tendency to push the data to accord with his Cilician
originated model is questionable. As a comprehensive formula to interpret the Roman Mithraic
iconography, his theory is also not convincing.
Ulansey also tries to maintain that the lion-headed god is a time god affiliated with Chronos and
Aion because it possesses undeniable astrological attributes that are similar to what we see in
iconography related to Aion. However, Ulansey still confuses this concept with his Mithras
Perseus model and suggests that the relationship between the lion-headed god and Mithras is like
the relationship between Gorgon and Perseus in the story in which Gorgon, as a worthy rival to
147 Ulansey, Origins of the Mithraic Mysteries, 91–92. 148 Ulansey, Origins of the Mithraic Mysteries, 107.



120
Perseus, is killed by Perseus.149 Again this is another problematic argument by Ulansey
because there is no evidence in Mithraic iconography that Mithras fights with or kills the lion
headed god.

121 Chapter 5 Mithras: The Celestial Charioteer
According to M. J. Vermaseren, a counter-clockwise swastika has been well preserved on a
tauroctony scene found at Gigen, in modern Bulgaria, and is now in the national museum in
Sofia (fig. 5.1, left).150 In another Mithraic artefact from Italy (fig. 5.1, right), a clockwise
swastika is depicted on a bronze statue along with two six-rayed star signs.151 Despite the rarity
of this symbol in Roman Mithraic artefacts, this instance should not be ignored.
Fig. 5.1. Left: Tauroctony found at Gigen. CIMRM 2247. Right: Mithraic artefact with swastika. CIMRM 765.
The swastika is a symbol used by several ancient cultures. The swastika as a sacred symbol is
well-known in the east, found commonly in the Indus valley from around 2500 BC. It remains a
religious symbol in Hinduism and Jainism, and is widely in use. It has also been found in bronze
and iron age cultures around the Black Sea, Caspian Sea, and southwest Iran. In Buddhism it is
known as yung drung and is the graphic representation of eternity. In Chinese and Japanese the
word represented by the swastika in writing is a homonym of the number 10,000, and is
150 CIMRM, Mon. 2247. 151 CIMRM, Mon.765.



122 commonly used to represent the whole of creation. It is also present in Greek architectural
motifs, cloths, coins, and artefacts dating back to the eighth century BC.
What makes the swastika interesting in the context of Mithraism is the wide use of this symbol in
the east, particularly in ancient Iran and India, coinciding with the Mithraic tauroctony.
Interestingly, the swastika was known as “the chariot of Mithra” in Iran.152 In the Mihr Yasht of
the Avesta, Mithra is described as having a celestial quadriga pulled by four heavenly white
horses, who have front hoofs made of gold and back hoofs made of silver.153 His chariot is
decorated with the stars and his bright face is like the star Sirius.154 He hears with his thousand
ears and watches with his thousand eyes, always standing on the high end of the sky, restlessly,
in the north, arising above the Alborz mountains.155 He appears before the sunrise and after the
sunset and touches both ends of the ball-shaped earth, and he watches everything between the
earth and the sky.156
This leaves no doubt that the seat of Mithra and his quadriga is a celestial body in the sky close
to the celestial north pole.157 If we look out on a clear night sky in the northern hemisphere to the
constellation Draco, we can recognize a clockwise swastika (figs. 5.2, 5.3). Its center is Zeta
Draco (HIP83895), and it consists of four wings: 15 Draco-Pherkad-Zeta Ursa Minor, Eta Draco
Theta Draco-Edasich, 26 Draco-Gramium-Rustaban, and Omega Draco-Phi Draco-Upsilon

124
The counter-clockwise swastika in the tauroctony scene of Gigen is the mirror image of the
celestial clockwise swastika because the tauroctony is a symbolic projection of the celestial
bodies. Other symbolic figures such as Taurus, Canis Minor, and Scorpio, which appear together
in most tauroctony scenes, are also always projected as mirror images of the celestial
constellations.
Zeta Draco is the closest star to the north ecliptic pole and the center of the zodiac in the star
map. Because the axial precession of the earth takes place around an axis perpendicular to the
earth’sΝorbitΝaroundΝtheΝsun,ΝeclipticΝpolesΝserveΝasΝtheΝprecessionalΝpolesΝofΝtheΝearth,Νtoo.Ν
Therefore, Zeta Draco is not only the star of the north ecliptic pole, but also represents the north
precessional pole. It is the only star which never changes its path in the north sky; instead, the
north celestial pole and other celestial bodies rotate clockwise around this point (almost one
degree every seventy-two years). The ecliptic pole as the center of the zodiac would have been
known to ancient civilizations, even if one does not admit that the precession was known until
the Greek astronomer Hipparcus.
5.1 Symbolism in Tauroctony
As an observational consequence of precession, the constellations of the zodiac remain on the
ecliptic but shift backwards almost one sign every two millennia (30 degrees every 2,160 years),
which is known as an astrological age. Each astrological age is named after the zodiac sign(s)



125
rising or setting on the equinoctial points158 in that age, representing the sign(s) of the spring
or fall equinox. The precession forces all the constellations to change their position – except the
swastika, which spins slowly round in its clockwise direction around Zeta Draco. In this great
change the family of signs of the zodiac stays on the ecliptic while the family of the
constellations representing the east rising stars or the celestial equator changes its members in
each age. The latter family gains a new pair of zodiac constellations on its intersection with the
ecliptic (which become the symbol of the age), accompanied by one other constellation which
reaches the celestial equator at the same time. I suggest that this phenomenon provides a
framework for decoding the secret of the cosmic imagery of the Mithraic tauroctony.
Here is the explanation: Knowing that, in addition to the planets and the moon and the sun
having their cyclical movement, the cosmos appears to have its own great cycle rotating around
the ecliptic pole, one can make a simple astrolabe in which the background image showing the
constellations rotates around the center of the ecliptic circle (Zeta Draco), while the two circles
of the ecliptic and the equator of the astrolabe remain fixed. This is the secret to simulating the
cosmos during the great year: by rotating the astrolabe thirty degrees, or one sign of the zodiac,
for each astrological age, one reveals the star map of that age. By rewinding this cosmic clock
and tracking back the motions of the celestial bodies, one can see that the beginning of each age
corresponds to the arrival of a new pair of zodiac signs at the intersecting points of the two
circles of this astrolabe. Another constellation, which I call the “forerunner,” also intersects with
the equatorial circle and rises on the east just before the sign of the age. Surprisingly, the
158 The points on the horizon where the sun rises/sets during the equinoxes, or the intersection of the ecliptic and celestial equator.



126 forerunner constellations of successive ages correspond to the constellations depicted in the
tauroctony.159
The forerunner constellation of each age joins the new zodiac pair in the east, metaphorically
overthrowing the sign of the previous age. Corvus comes with Leo-Aquarius, Crater with
Cancer-Capricornus, Hydra with Gemini-Sagittarius, Canis Minor with Taurus-Scorpius, and
Orion with Aries-Libra. More precisely, the brightest star of Orion, Betelgeuse (Alpha Orion),
intersects with the celestial equator, overthrowing the brightest star of Taurus, Aldebaran (Alpha
Taurus), commencing the age of Aries. This hypothesis might explain the importance in Mithraic
iconography of particular constellations such as Canis Minor, Crater, Hydra, and Corvus.
The astrological concept behind this Roman imagery might even have been developed from a
basic astrological framework derived from the east by the Greeks and Romans. The message of
this image is the awareness of the coming of the new age, Pisces-Virgo (two fish and a virgin).
This age commenced around 1 AD, when the edge of Pisces (the segment between Omicron
Pisces and Eta Pisces) reached the equinoctial point (the intersection of the ecliptic circle and
celestial equator) and Spica, the brightest star of Virgo, reached the celestial equator and rose in
the east (fig. 5.4).
159 Speidel contemplated their relationship with the equator in the ancient sky, but this set of constellations (Corvus, Hydra, Crater, Canis Minor, and Orion) never appears fully as the equatorial constellations. For example, Canis Minor should not appear in the taurectony according to Speidel’sΝframework,ΝbutΝitΝdoes (Speidel, MithrasOrion, 4-28). Ulansey also rejects Speidel’sΝtheoryΝofΝεithras-Orion because of this fact (Ulansey, Origins of Mithraic Mysteries, 22).



127
Fig. 5.4. The proposed Mithraic astrolabe. The precessional rotation in the sky of the northern hemisphere from 10,500 BC to 1 AD. Diagram by author.
The tauroctony proposes the start of this cosmic clock in the age of Leo-Aquarius (10,500 BC
8,000 BC), represented by the constellation Corvus, and the only missing age in this imagery is
Pisces-Virgo, which was yet to come at the time the tauroctony was created. In this binary
system the great cycle of the world sums up to twelve millennia. The concept of the great year,
or twelve thousand years consisting of six ages, half evil and half peaceful, is a Zurvanite belief
in ancient Iran.
Zurvan is the concept of time, supreme god, and primordial creator deity in the Iranian cult of
Zurvanism. The name Zurvan may be discerned on tablets dating back to the twelfth century BC.



128 Zurvan is referred to in two forms: Zurvan Akarǎnak (the god of infinite time) and Dirang
Xutǎy (the god of finite time). Iranian Pahlavi sources tell that material creation evolved from the
infinite to four elements, then to a second form of mixing of these primary properties, and finally
to the fully developed cosmos. This form exists for twelve thousand years after which the whole
is taken up to the infinite again.160 According to another report (from Eznik of Kolb, an
Armenian writer of the fifth century), Zurvan wished to have a son, with the name Ohrmazd,
who would create heaven, earth, and all beings. After offering sacrifice for a thousand years
Zurvan began to ponder and doubt if he should wait. While doing so, Ohrmazd and Ahriman
were conceived: Ohrmazd (Ahura-Mazda, the good god of MazdeanΝtheology)ΝfromΝZurvan’sΝ
thousandΝyearsΝofΝsacrificeΝandΝAhrimanΝ(evil)ΝfromΝZurvan’sΝdoubt.ΝInΝfiniteΝtimeΝandΝspace,Ν
which exists for twelve thousand years, there is a battle between good and evil. There is also a
treaty between Ohrmazd and Ahriman to keep the balance and prevent Ahriman from ruling for
more than half of the ages.161 The mediator162 who keeps the treaty is Mithra.163
5.2 Chariot of Mithra
Now we can draw a scheme to understand the cosmic image of Mithra and its symbolism. Mithra
is the god of cosmic order, the divinity who keeps the treaties, the god of vast pastures, who rises
on the north sky, never sleeps, and watches everything with his thousand eyes. His chariot is the
swastika driven by four white horses running smoothly through the ages of time.
160 R. C. Zaehner, Zurvan: A Zoroastrian Dilemma (Oxford: Clarendon, 1955), 266. 161 Dark and light cycles are usually a thousand years long, for example the evil rule of Zahhak in Iranian myths. 162 After the third century, Mihr (Mithra) was often presented as identical to the sun, where as in the Avesta he is clearly distinguished from the sun. 163 Zaehner, Zurvan, 101.



129 If we look more carefully at the proposed celestial swastika, we can even draw the star map
of the four horses of this constellation pulling the swastika (or the “cross” of the swastika) in its
clockwise direction around the center, as shown in the figure below (fig. 5.5). The story of the
four horses of Mithra is copied in the so-called Song of Magians preserved by Dio Chrisostom
and cited by Cumont, Reitzenstein, Nyberg, and Zaehner.164 According to Cumont, the myth is
genuinely Magian in origin.165
Fig. 5.5. The celestial quadriga. Diagram by author.
164 Zaehner believes this song is evidence for the divinization of the four elements in Zurvanism and fits in a fourfold structure that repeats in this worldview. Zaehner, Zurvan, 226. 165 Cumont believes the charioteer Zeus in this myth is the supreme god Zurvan, and the four horses represent the four elements (Zaehner, Zurvan, 227).



130
InΝCumont’sΝaccountΝofΝtheΝstory,Ν“theΝsupremeΝgodΝdrivesΝaΝchariotΝdrawnΝbyΝfourΝsteedsΝ
whichΝturnΝceaselesslyΝroundΝinΝaΝfixedΝcircle.”166 ZaehnerΝstatesΝthatŚΝ“TheΝmythΝspeaksΝofΝZeusΝ
as the first and perfect charioteer of the perfect chariot. This chariot, which is the cosmos, is
guided by the one charioteer and proceeds on its course throughout ‘unceasing periods of
eternity.’ Men can only see the course of the sun and Moon, but ‘can not grasp the movement of
the whole.’ Each horse is sacred to one of four mythical figures: Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, and
Hestia.”167 Cumont goes on to describe the story in detail:
The first [of these horses], which bears on its shining coat168 the signs of the planets
and constellations, is sturdy and agile and traverses the circumference of the fixed
circle with extreme velocity; the second, less vigorous and less rapid in its
movement,169 wears a sombre robe, of which one side is illuminated by the rays of
the sun; the third proceeds more slowly still; and the fourth turns slowly in the same
spot, champing restlessly its steel bit,170 whilst its companions move round it as
round a stationary column in the center. The quadriga turns slowly and unimpeded,
regularly completing its eternal course. But at a certain moment the fiery breath of
the first horse falling upon the fourth ignites its mane, and its neighbor, exhausted by
166 Cumont, Mysteries of Mithra, 116–18. 167 Zaehner, Zurvan, 226. 168 “ShiningΝcoat”ΝmayΝreferΝtoΝtheΝstar Kokab – the brightest star among the four companion stars of the celestial swastika. 169 The details of the story about the first horse being agile and rapid and the second horse being less rapid are possibly because the angle of 15 Draco-Zeta Draco-Eta Draco is smaller that the angle of Eta Draco-Zeta Draco-26 Draco. Thus it seems that the first horse wearing the shiny coat (Kokab) runs faster than the second horse that wears a sombre robe (HIP78180, the least bright star among the four companion stars of the celestial swastika). 170 The suggested figure of the fourth horse turns in the same spot instead of continuing on the circular path of the celestial swastika.



131 its efforts, inundates it with torrents of perspiration. Finally, a still more remarkable
phenomenon takes place, the appearance of the quartet.171
The details of this story coincide with the graphic and geometric forms of the horses in the
proposed star map of the figure for the four horses of the swastika.
There is a bronze age statue of a charioteer found in Serbia with the symbol of the swastika, and
some Roman artefacts also show four horse-heads shaping a counter clockwise swastika while
the horses move the swastika in clockwise direction (fig. 5.6). Regardless of finding direct
connections between the latter instances and the Mithraic cult, they tell us about the symbol of
the swastika being accepted in the west as the four-horse chariot running clockwise around a
stationary column.

132
In Roman artefacts, Mithras is shown as the charioteer of the quadriga. In another image, Mithras
spins the cosmic sphere in his hand, and in another he holds the cosmic sphere in one hand and
turns the zodiac with the other (fig. 5.7). The latter image resembles a Greek mosaic of Aeon, the
god of time, turning the circle of the zodiac.172

CIMRM 506. Right: Mithras turning the zodiac and the cosmic sphere. CIMRM 985.
172 In early Christian imagery we often see the image of Jesus appearing in the middle of a zodiac with his twelve companions. The image of Christ also coincides with the cross and circle both usually represented in the depiction of the zodiac. Jesus could be the successor of Mithras, born when Pisces reaches the equinoctial point and when Spica, the brightest star of Virgo (the virgin) and the symbol of wheat or the house of bread (the literal translation of
“Bethlehem”),ΝreachesΝtheΝcelestialΝequatorΝandΝrisesΝinΝtheΝeast.ΝTheΝstoryΝofΝthreeΝεagiΝwearingΝPhrygian caps, like the three men in the tauroctony, sounds Mithraic: their following the star in the east towards Bethlehem to inaugurate the birth of Jesus could be a story about the astronomical observation of Spica in order to determine its arrival on the celestial equator to announce the beginning of the age of Pisces. This is the age in which mankind was saved and gifted a loaf of bread and two fish by their virgin-born savior. This fact might be a tenet of Roman Mithraism: the wonder of the new astrological age which is the last age of the universe. It represents the problem of finding a new mythical hero for the age of Pisces, in which the god Mithras is incarnated. It is the age of the final battle between good and evil.



133 Chapter 6 Mithras: The God of the Cosmic Cross
In Roman culture the four-horse chariot, as the possible astrological symbol of the ecliptic,
metaphorically serves the sun, which is the prime heavenly body traveling on the perimeter of
the ecliptic, as well as the other planets. However, in the Avesta the four-horse chariot serves
only Mithra and is not borrowed by the sun or the other planets in Iranian mythology.
Another important problem that has been surprisingly ignored in the study of the Mithraic
iconography is the fact that in the tauroctony and several other artifacts Mithras is usually shown
as partly or fully encompassed by the zodiac, which means he is seated in the ecliptic pole. A
perfect example is the tauroctony scene found in a Mithraeum in the city of London, now in the
Museum of London. In this artifact, the zodiac is depicted in a perfect circle encompassing the
bull-slayer and the two torch-bearers so that Taurus is aligned with the bull and Scorpio is
aligned with the scorpion in the scene (fig. 6.1). This setting suggests a celestial alignment and
some coordination references according to which the bull-slayer is possibly located among the
celestial bodies. I propose that the bull-slayer Mithras could be a Roman creation that elaborately
represents the star map of the ecliptic pole.



134
Fig. 6.1. Tauroctony of London: The alignment of Taurus and Scorpio on the encompassing zodiac corresponds to the position of the bull and scorpion in the scene. Photograph by author.
In the tauroctony, the bull-slayer always turns his head away from the bull, while holding a
dagger in his right hand and bending his right knee. His cape is always raised up, often having
the mark of the stars. The upper-body proportions of the bull-slayer are relatively similar in
tauroctony scenes. The relative stability of the figure of the bull-slayer in the tauroctony, despite
the wide geographical distribution of the iconography, suggests the possible existence of a
universally visible physical phenomenon, like a constellation, to which this figure refers.
The coincidence of the tauroctony of Gigen, in which the symbol of the broken cross is
associated with the bull-slayer, also adds to this assumption that the bull-slayer succeeds the



135 symbol of the broken cross and represents the ecliptic pole in Roman Mithraic iconography
(fig. 6.2).
Fig. 6.2. Tauroctony of Gigen with a broken cross in the middle and two crosses on either side. CIMRM 2247.
I analyzed the image of the bull-slayer in various Mithraic artifacts by juxtaposing the stars of
the ecliptic in the first century, in an orientation in which Taurus is on the upper right side and
Scorpio is on the lower left side, as the tauroctony suggests. The analysis shows that the bull
slayer figure of Mithras can match the star map of the north ecliptic pole as shown in figure 6.3.
Interestingly, in this alignment Corvus, Crater, Leo, Hydra, Canis Minor, Taurus, Scorpio, and
the proposed constellation of the bull-slayer are in the same order relative to their astrological
symbols in the tauroctony (fig. 6.13).



136

In theΝ“Mithras Liturgy,” a text in the Great Magical Papyrus of Paris, the god Mithras is
invoked several times. Although it is not a first-hand Mithraic text, the Liturgy is commonly
considered as material reworked for the syncretic tradition of magic in the Hellenistic and
Roman era, contemporaneous to Roman Mithraism.173 PartΝofΝthisΝtextΝreadsŚΝ“andΝtheΝearthΝ

bolts leaping from his eyes and stars from his body.”174 The bear, which turns heaven around
in accordance with the hour, is thus Ursa Minor, the celestial body that marks the north
equatorial pole (in the first century the north equatorial pole was slightly away from Polaris and
was situated on the back of Ursa Minor, between its tail and head).
This text, which has remained puzzling and confusing to this date, seems acceptable on the
interpretation proposed in this paper. The “golden shoulder” of a bull could be the star Kokab
and, based on my reconstruction, the celestial bull-slayer holds Ursa Minor in his right hand. The
bull-slayer then pushes the dagger in the opposite direction to the hourly turn of the celestial
bodies, and the force of the bull-slayer’sΝrightΝhandΝisΝaΝforce in the direction of axial precession

(fig. 6.3). The snake and two bears depicted in the center of the zodiac in the ceiling of the
Mithraeum at Ponza175 could also refer to Ursa Major, Ursa Minor, and Miras-Draco (fig. 6.4).

In some tauroctony scenes, a bow shape of clouds instead of the zodiac often encompasses the
bull-slayer at the top of the scene. The celestial dust or clouds are commonly representative of
the galactic plane or the Milky Way. In Greek mythology this is described as the bridge or road
to mythical Mount Olympus, the home of twelve Olympian gods, and the path of ruin made by
the chariot of Helios.176 In the reconstruction below of the celestial bull-slaying scene, the Milky
Way also bows over the head of the celestial bull-slayer (figs. 6.9, 6.13).

139 6.1 Leontocephalic Man
Among Mithraic artifacts there is another significant character that seems to be as important as
the bull-slayer. The details and attributes of this mysterious figure are even more complicated to
interpret than the other figures, and therefore its identity remains highly controversial; however it
is crucial to decoding the mystery of Mithraism. This figure is a naked man with a human body
and the head of a lion, opening his mouth to give a frightening impression, entwined by a snake.
He usually has four wings and holds one or two keys and a scepter in his hand. He often has a
thunderbolt, the sign of Thor, the thunder god, and in some instances he is standing on the
cosmic sphere (fig. 6.5). This figure is restricted to Mithraic iconography and has almost the
same importance as the tauroctony.

140 Cumont has identified this figure with the Iranian god Zurvan because of direct symbolic
references to the concept of time in this figure, and suggests it to be of Egyptian origin and to
correspond with the Greek Aion and/or Greco-Phoenician Kronos.177 Like other interpretations
by Cumont, this view was generally rejected by anti-Cumontian scholars. The identity of the
lion-headed figure of Mithraic iconography was treated in several of the papers of the first and
theΝsecondΝconferencesΝofΝεithraicΝstudiesΝinΝ1971ΝandΝ1975.ΝCumont’sΝviewΝisΝmaintainedΝbyΝ
Vermaseren, although Vermaseren also describes an Egyptian influence on the Hellenistic era.178
A. D. H. Bivar relates the lion-headed figure instead to the Babylonian gods of death and the
underworld, Nergal and Moloch.179
Despite the obvious astronomical symbolism in this figure and its attributes of a time god,
finding its meanings and true origins is one of the most controversial problems in Mithraic
studies. This figure also shares some elements with the Roman god Janus. Janus is also a time
god, holding keys and a scepter. He is the god of beginnings, transitions, and ends, usually
depicted with two heads and also known as quadrifrons or “four-headed.”
On the other hand, Iranian Mithra always has a companion named Varahran, or Bahram in
modern Persian, who is a boar-headed or possibly lion-headed warrior, fighting for Mithra in
front of his celestial four-horse chariot. His weapon is thunder, and thus he is also known as the
Iranian thunder god or the god of eternal fire (the sacred fire caused by the thunder, known as
âtaxş-i-varahrân).

141 In fact, this figure borrows symbolic elements from several cultures. As a unique Mithraic
icon, it is the most syncretic creation in Mithraic iconography. In some instances the figure
appears with a human head similar to Mithras (fig. 6.6) and often the zodiac symbols are
portrayed on his body. Despite the terrifying appearance of the lion-headed form, this figure
cannot be a demon; on the contrary, he could be another reincarnation of Mithras or another
mythological and astrologic reference to the celestial seat of the godhead.
Fig. 6.6. Mithraic human-headed figure entwined by a snake. CIMRM 777.
If the bull-slayer is positioned in the ecliptic pole he should at the same time represent Draco. I
suggest that the serpent around this figure, who entwines his body by six turns, is Draco. The
constellation of Draco is usually drawn as a snake with six turns since its astral geometry is a



142 continuous line with thirteen segments (six pairs of stars) (fig. 6.7). The figure might also
represent the celestial broken cross by having four wings on its back, and represent Janus and
Aion, the god of the astrological ages, by holding the keys and a scepter. The lion head with
exposedΝteethΝisΝpossiblyΝtheΝreproductionΝofΝtheΝPersianΝεithra’sΝwarriorΝcompanion, Varahram,
who is often mentioned as an iron-toothed beast. The broken cross is also associated with the
lion in Iranian artifacts dating back to the first millennia BC, for example in the golden cups of
Hasanlu and Kelardasht.

It is possible that the lion-headed figure plays the role of the gatekeeper of heaven standing on
the ecliptic pole, the point in the sky that seemed to be the center of the firmament around which
theΝcelestialΝbodiesΝprecessionallyΝrevolved.ΝτrigenΝquotesΝCelcusŚΝ“These things are obscurely
hinted at in the accounts of the Persians, and especially in the mysteries of Mithras, which are
celebrated among them. For in the latter there is a representation of the two heavenly



143 revolutions—of the movement, viz., of the fixed stars, and of that which take place among
the planets, and of the passage of the soul through these. The representation is of the following
natureŚΝThereΝisΝaΝladderΝwithΝloftyΝgates,ΝandΝonΝtheΝtopΝofΝitΝanΝeighthΝgate.”180 The description
of eight levels of ascension, instead of the seven known planetary levels, is of importance here. If
there was thought to be an eighth orbit in the cosmos and the fixed stars to also revolve on a pole
(i.e., the ecliptic-precessional pole), then that pole might have been regarded as the connection
point of the celestial globe to its beyond. The lion-headed god possibly holds the key to the
eighth gate by standing on top of the celestial globe.
6.2 The Question of Axial Precession
Mithraic symbols of the broken cross and bull-slayer can merely refer to the ecliptic pole without
taking into account the importance of this point as the center of axial precession. Earlier I
suggested that Iranian Zurvanite theology draws a plausible framework for understanding the
role of Iranian Mithra in keeping the order of the universe during the six ages of time, a period
that is believed to be twelve thousand years in duration. I also suggested a star map for the
celestial quadriga on the ecliptic pole that runs the cosmos in the direction of the axial precession
around Zeta Draco, or the star of the north ecliptic pole (i.e., the same as the north precessional
pole). Here the bull-slayer seems to play the same role (turning the cosmos in the precessional
direction) by landing the dagger on the bull with his right hand. This hand is one of the four arms
of the celestial broken cross that lies between the north ecliptic pole and the north equatorial
pole.

144 In the tauroctony scene of London, Cautes, the torch-bearer who holds the torch raised up,
points the torch to a place in the zodiac between Leo and Virgo; Cautopates, the torch-bearer
who holds the torch downward, points to a place between Aquarius and Capricorn. This might
support my suggestion about the Mithraic tauroctony symbolizing the concept of the great time
of six astrological ages beginning in the age of Leo and ending after Pisces. In this artifact the
two quadrigas at the top corners probably belong to Sol and Luna, as their seat is on the zodiac.
But what is important here is the direction in which Sol and Luna run the quadriga on the zodiac
or the ecliptic. The direction shown on this iconography is a precessional direction that is
opposite to the course of the planets on the zodiac (fig. 6.8).
Fig. 6.8. Tauroctony of London: The positioning of torches and the direction of quadrigas relative to the symbols of the zodiac. Photograph by author.



145 The path of the planets is not affected by the axial precession. In fact, ancient civilizations
could more easily find out about the axial precession (also known as the precession of
“equinoxes”) by noticing the displacement of the celestial bodies relative to the equinoctial and
solstitial points of the horizon, towards which many temples and landscape marks used to be
oriented in several ancient cultures. This replacement is one degree every seventy-two years,
which is a considerable change in the rising point of a star. According to this understanding, one
can imagine that the sun and the planets never change their paths on the celestial bodies and stay
on the ecliptic, and the axial precession only shifts the equinoctial and solstitial references on the
ecliptic in the reverse direction. This way one could assume that the precession takes place
around the ecliptic poles. That might be the reason Sol and Luna are running the chariot on the
precessional direction on the zodiac, since the apparent effect of precession is understood by the
course of planets relative to the fixed stars on the ecliptic. Understanding the affiliation of
Mithras with Sol or Helios is possible by understanding the interpretation of the axial precession
by the Romans.181
181 The birth of Christ coincides with the commencement of the age of Pisces or the two fish, when the seat of the sun on the ecliptic in equinoxes passes from Aries (the lamb) to Pisces and from Libra to Virgo (the virgin). According to the story of the last supper in Luke’sΝgospel, Jesus sent two disciples to the city to find a place to prepare for Passover. He tells them they will meet a man who carries a pitcher of water, and if they follow him he will show them a house in which there is a large furnished room on the upper floor. In astrological symbolism, the man carrying a pitcher of water is Aquarius. Following Aquarius to find a large room on an upper floor could be interpreted metaphorically as passing from Aries to Pisces towards Aquarius in precessional direction. The most noticeableΝobservationalΝreferenceΝtoΝtrackΝthisΝshiftΝwasΝtheΝprecessionalΝarrivalΝofΝSpicaΝ(calledΝ“theΝhouseΝofΝ wheat”ΝorΝ“theΝhouseΝofΝbread,”ΝliterallyΝtranslatedΝasΝ“Bethlehem”)ΝonΝtheΝequatorΝandΝitsΝriseΝonΝtheΝcardinalΝ“east.”Ν This is also portrayed by Christians as three magi wearing Phrygian caps, who made an astronomic observation. Other parallels include the following: Jesus has twelve disciples, like Mithras encompassed by the twelve signs of the zodiac, and one disciple betrays him on the night of Passover. The iconography of the crucifixion of Jesus in early Christian art is a relatively repetitive scene showing Jesus on a cross either accompanied by two other crucified men, or often two angels, on either side. The sun and moon are usually demonstrated on the upper left and right corners of the crucifixion scene, like Sol and Luna in the tauroctony. There are even examples of Christian art portraying Jesus in the center of the zodiac (fig. 6.10).



146 In the tauroctony of Gigen (fig. 6.2), where the broken cross is shown next to the bull-slayer,
there are two other cross signs, one on each side next to Cautes and Cautopates, the two torch
bearers who stand on two sides of the bull-slaying scene with “crossed” legs. These crosses
possibly represent the intersections of the ecliptic and the celestial equator as usually shown on
the celestial globe. These intersections are the equinoctial points of the ecliptic. According to the
third century neoplatonist Porphyry, the equinoxes are assigned as the seat of Mithras.182
Ulansey also suggests that the two torchbearers represent the vernal and autumnal equinoxes.
The two crosses and the cross-legged figures might otherwise represent the two intersections of
the Milky Way and the ecliptic. According to George Latura, two cross intersections are visible
in the form of a cross where zodiacal light on the ecliptic intersects with the Milky Way. He
suggests that these celestial references were well known among the Greeks and Romans and
were referred to as the “visible X in the sky” by Plato.183
6.3 The Mithraeum as a Symbolic Precessional Planetarium
The architecture of Mithraea is also of a unique and stable design. A Mithraeum is commonly a
basilica-type, vaulted, cave-like dark chamber portraying the tauroctony at one end. Porphyry
reports that the Mithraeum is designed like a cave because the cave conveys an image of the
cosmos.184 Regardless of the prior existence of the possible graphics of stars and cosmos on the
ceiling, the most dominant element of the Mithraeum is the bull-slayer at the center of the
182 Porphyry, Cave of the Nymphs, 6.

aligned with the vault of the Mithraeum. Most of the rituals practiced by Mithraists are unknown,
but what is important for our purposes in the practice of the cult in the Mithraeum is the three
dimensional space imitating the revolving cosmos, where the godhead on the ecliptic pole takes
the focal point encompassed by the ecliptic (fig. 6.11).

151 Chapter 7 Dome of Heaven
The cross of eternity appears in Persepolis and Naghsh-e-Rostam, in Iran, where four tombs of
the Achaemenid kings were built in the center of huge crosses carved in the rocks of a cliff (fig.
7.1). This site is a few kilometers northeast of Persepolis, where other identical cross tombs are
incurved on the cliff facing the royal complex. In Naghsh-e-Rostam in front of the four crosses
there is an enigmatic Achaemenid structure, the function of which remains a mystery. The
structure is commonly called Kaba-i-Zartosht, a fourteenth century name meaning “the cube of
Zoroaster,”185 but its original name is unknown. It dates back to the fifth century BC and seems
to be a copy of an earlier Achaemenid structure in Pasargad of which only one side has survived
and which is believed to have been constructed a few decades before Kaba-i-Zartosht.186 Both
structures are constructed with white limestone. Their form is a cube with square plan 7.25m
wide and 12.5m high. The door of the chamber was accessible by a thirty-step stone staircase.
On the other three facades of the building there are recessed objects of black limestone like false
windows. This configuration, taking into consideration the cross tombs of the Achaemenid kings,
shows the importance of the cross shape, which is repeated in negative form on the facades of
this building by the locations of the four square false windows.

This structure also contains important inscriptions from the eighth century and later written by
the Sassanid King Shapur I (241–272 AD) and the Sassanid priest Kartir in Middle Persian,
Parthian, and Greek. The inscription of Shapur I contains descriptions of his Roman wars in
which he claims to have defeated and killed Emperor Gordian III and captured Emperor Valerian
in a battle.187 Some Sassanid kings also carved seven bas-reliefs on in this site, portraying scenes
suchΝasΝShapurΝI’sΝvictoryΝoverΝRomanΝemperorsΝandΝBahramΝII’sΝfightΝwithΝtheΝRomanΝenemy.Ν
In two other Sassanid bas-reliefs Ardeshir I and Narseh are shown receiving the kingship ring,
which is a Mithraic symbol of oath-taking.188

153 The site remained highly important for the Persian Sassanid kings even eight centuries after
the construction of the tombs and the cubic building, regardless of whether the Sassanids were
aware of the original concepts behind the design of the Achaemenid structures. Finding answers
for the highly controversial questions about the purpose of Kaba-i-Zartosht is beyond the scope
of this research, but a comprehensive study of this structure must consider its architectural
symbolism in relation to ancient Iranian cosmology.
The symbol of the cross of eternity has flourished in the conception of the Persian royal gardens.
A Persian royal garden is called pardis. This Old Persian word appeared as pairi-daeza in the
Avestan language,189 was borrowed by the Greek language in the form of paradeisos
(παȡάįİιıοȢ), and later appeared in Latin in the form of paradisus as early as the fourth century
BC.190 This word is the root of French paradis or the English “paradise,” referring to heaven or
the Garden of Eden. In the Quran heaven was also called ferdows (from the Persian pardis
adopted into Arabic), described as a garden full of trees under which canals of water run and in
which those who inherit it will abide eternally.191 The plan of the Persian garden is in fact the
reflection of the concept of heaven on earth: a landscape cosmicized by the cross of eternity.
Interestingly, one of the uses of four-arch structures in Iranian architecture in the Islamic era is
the building in the center of the garden, incorporated on the intersection of the two perpendicular
axes.192 The Persian gardens in modern Persian are also called char-bagh, meaning “four

This form is called hasht-behesht, meaning “eight heavens” in Persian.

a cross of sidewalks, usually accompanied with flowing water (fig. 7.2).

wife, Mumtaz Mahal, a woman from the Persian nobility.

156 7.1 Chartaqi
Now we can get back to the chartaqi, which symbolically represents the dome of heaven. In the
chartaqi, a dome is constructed on top of four pillars on a square footprint and a cross plan,
oriented towards the equinoctial and solstitial points of the local horizon. I should elaborate on
the problem of the importance of the solstitial and equinoctial points in this cosmological
orientation.
Primitive cultures were aware of the path of the sun on the ecliptic and pinpointed the maximum
and minimum points of the travel of the sun on the horizon, along with the middle point, which
we call the equinoctial and solstitial point. These points remain true reference points, regardless
of the shape of the local horizon or the latitude of observation. The stars rising and setting on
these points were also tracked according to these points, as we call them the tropic of Cancer,
tropic of Capricorn, and the celestial equator. The early awareness of axial precession was
probably made possible by noticing the shift of stars marked on the celestial equator or the other
celestial tropical references. This shift, which is one degree every seventy-two years, is
noticeable even by one generation. The awareness of axial precession becomes even more
probable when a sedentary society build in a way that aligns landscape or architectural structures
with rising points of the stars and the sun. As a result the stars shift while the sun maintains its
solstitial and equinoctial references. Thus the most important observation reference in the sky for
tracking the axial precession in the firmament is the path of the sun, representing the ecliptic,
which is not affected by the precession. The best observation references to track the movement
of the stars relative to the ecliptic are the equinoctial and solstitial points on the horizon. This is
also the reason that the axial precession is also called the precession of equinoxes.



157 Interestingly, the Greek astronomer Hipparcus also tried to calculate the precessional cycle
by calculating the displacement of Spica relative to the equinoctial points. The third century
neoplatonistΝPorphyry’sΝreportΝaboutΝtheΝRomanΝεithraists,ΝwhichΝsaysΝ“TheΝequinoctialΝregionΝ
they assigned to Mithras as an appropriate seat,”194 addresses the importance of these
astronomical observation references.
In Mithraic cosmography the dome of the cosmos rotates on the cosmic cross. The chartaqi is
also designed incorporating this concept purely. This structure is a Mithraic/Zurvanite time
capsule, the house of eternal time which reckons the breath of the world during the six ages of
finite time. It represents the revolving dome of heaven centered on the ecliptic pole or the cosmic
cross.
The concept of infinite time/space as the superior form of finite time/space seems to be the core
of Zurvanite cosmology, based on an interpretation of the great astrological cycle of the universe.
According to Pahlavi sources, the cosmos (sipihr), which is the body of finite time, is born from
the infinite, and the evolution of material creation begins from this. The four elements derive
from sipihr, which is the primal matter, then a form of the mixing of the primary properties
appears, and finally human beings and animals (organic life) emerges. This form of the fully
developed cosmos exists for twelve thousand years and then will be taken up into the last form or
“final body” (tan-i-pasin), which is in turn absorbed to the infinite.195

158 7.2 Qasr Amrah
The earliest surviving image of the sky painted on a non-flat surface is a fresco on the
hemispheric dome of a caldarium (hot bath) in Qasr Amra in modern Jordan. The surviving
building is a part of a larger desert palace built in the early eighth century by Umayyad Prince
Wallid II or Yazid III, who spent a long time away from Damascus, the Umayyad administrative
center, before assuming the throne. In this fresco, thirty-five identifiable constellations are
depicted, including the zodiac shown in accurate angle. The twelve radii in the fresco do not
emerge from the center of the dome but from the ecliptic North Pole, with the constellation signs
arranged accordingly. The order of the stars in the fresco is reversed to counter-clockwise order,
suggesting that the dome was not meant to imitate the visible order of the sky but represented a
projected order, as used to be shown on a flat surface (figs. 7.6, 7.7). Other frescoes in Qasr
Amra include naked women and hunting scenes. The animals in these scenes are commonly
found in Persia rather than the area of Qasr Amra. One of the frescoes also shows six figures
includingΝtheΝPersianΝSassanidΝKing.ΝYazid’sΝmotherΝwasΝaΝPersianΝprincessΝandΝfamiliarΝwithΝ
Persian culture and probably influenced the Umayyad princes.196

7.3 From Chartaqi to Roman Mithraism
The architectural dome symbolically represented the cosmos in many traditions. The origins of
this synchronic symbolism may even have evolved from the human perception of space. There is
no doubt that sky-watching had a dominant influence on the development of abstracting the
orders of geometry and mathematics by our ancestors. But what is important and probably
unique about chartaqi is a particular interpretation of the dome of the sky centered on the ecliptic
pole, built on a cross, and oriented to the real world equinoctial and solstitial references. There is
no evidence for frescoes or inscriptions on chartaqi, but the later example of Qasr Amra suggests



161 that in the Iranian tradition the dome could be conceptualized as the dome of heaven
representing the sky based on the ecliptic pole.
As mentioned earlier, in Roman Mithraic symbolism the very concept of the revolving cosmos
centered on the ecliptic pole is represented in the architecture of Mithraea in a different way by
positioning the image of the tauroctony on the end of the vaulted space. The tauroctony is
probably a Roman invention as an astro-cryptographic reference to the ecliptic pole, but the
representation of the ecliptic pole on the dome is preserved at least in the Roman Mithraeum in
Ponza by depicting a snake, representing Draco (adjacent to Ursa Minor and Ursa Major) on the
dome-shaped ceiling of the Mithraeum, along with the zodiac constellations on the perimeter.

162 Afterword
There are many questions that remain unanswered about chartaqi. I took a long journey with a
departure from chartaqi to other realms in Architecture, Astronomy, and Mythology, and
discovered one door after another. I chose a broad and interdisciplinary approach to a such
complex problem, the phenomenological understanding of the nature of the historic problem of
the meaning and purpose of chartaqi, trying to familiarize myself with the way our ancestors
lived and perceived space, nature, and the landscape, which led me to a holistic approach to the
problem. Traveling to far historic locations, wandering around archaeological sites, gazing into
the night sky, and meditating on forgotten natural phenomena on our landscape was as important
as analytical and critical thinking on historic sources and modern literature in the field.
Parts of this research have been presented at several international conferences and have been
published.197 I hope this work opens new windows in the study of history of architecture and
ancient cosmologies to be continued by other scholars.
