Are there human races?
February 28, 2012 • 6:30 am
UPDATE: I’ve received an email from a researcher who points out that two of my statements
are either misleading or incorrect in view of more recent work. Here’s the email and links:
In your interesting blog article “Are there human races?”, you write:”As has been known for a
while, DNA and other genetic analyses have shown that most of the variation in the human
species occurs within a given human ethnic group, and only a small fraction between different
races. That means that on average, there is more genetic difference between individuals
within a race than there is between races themselves.”– But this is patently false. I Tal
(2012b) I show that pariwise genetic distances, from within- and between-populations, are
substantially divergent (in fact, for Fst=0.15, reflecting average intercontinental differentiation
from SNPs, the averages differ by almost 50%).
Also, you ask:”I’m not aware that anybody has tested the accuracy of diagnosing a single
indvidual’s geographic origin from her multilocus genotype; if such studies exist, please let me
know.”– Yes. In Tal (2012a) I develop models that show that classification accuracy
approaches 100% even for very close populations, given enough loci. I then analyze recent
empirical studies of human populations under this framework.

granted that the answer was not only “yes,” but that there was a ranking of races (invariably
done by white biologists), with Caucasians on top, Asians a bit lower, and blacks invariably on
the bottom. The sad history of biologically based racism has been documented in many
places, including Steve Gould’s book The Mismeasure of Man (yes, I know it’s flawed).
But from that sordid scientific past has come a backlash: the subject of human races, or even
the idea that they exist, has become taboo. And this despite the palpable morphological
differences between human groups—differences that must be based on genetic differences
and would, if seen in other species, lead to their classification as either races or subspecies
(the terms are pretty interchangeable in biology). Racial delimitation could, critics say, lead to
a resurgence of racism, racial profiling, or even eugenics.
So do races exist? The answer of Jan Sapp, a biology professor at York University in Toronto,
is a firm “no”, as given in his new American Scientist piece “Race finished,” a review of two
new books on human races (Race?: Debunking a Scientific Myth by Ian Tattersall and Rob
DeSalle and Race and the Genetic Revolution: Science, Myth, and Culture, edited by Sheldon
Krimsky and Kathleen Sloan). As Sapp notes, and supports his conclusion throughout the
review:
Although biologists and cultural anthropologists long supposed that human races
genetically distinct populations within the same species—have a true existence in nature,
many social scientists and geneticists maintain today that there simply is no valid
biological basis for the concept. The consensus among Western researchers today is that
human races are sociocultural constructs.
Well, if that’s the consensus, I am an outlier. I do think that human races exist in the sense
that biologists apply the term to animals, though I don’t think the genetic differences between
those races are profound, nor do I think there is a finite and easily delimitable number of
human races. Let me give my view as responses to a series of questions. I discuss much of
this in chapter 8 of WEIT.
What are races?
In my own field of evolutionary biology, races of animals (also called “subspecies” or
“ecotypes”) are morphologically distinguishable populations that live in allopatry (i.e. are
geographically separated). There is no firm criterion on how much morphological difference it
takes to delimit a race. Races of mice, for example, are described solely on the basis of
difference in coat color, which could involve only one or two genes.
Under that criterion, are there human races?
Yes. As we all know, there are morphologically different groups of people who live in different
areas, though those differences are blurring due to recent innovations in transportation that
have led to more admixture between human groups.
How many human races are there?

https://whyevolutionistrue.com/2012/02/28/are-there-human-races/ 3/71
That’s pretty much unanswerable, because human variation is nested in groups, for their
ancestry, which is based on evolutionary differences, is nested in groups. So, for example,
one could delimit “Caucasians” as a race, but within that group there are genetically different
and morphologically different subgroups, including Finns, southern Europeans, Bedouins, and
the like. The number of human races delimited by biologists has ranged from three to over
thirty.
How different are the races genetically?
Not very different. As has been known for a while, DNA and other genetic analyses have
shown that most of the variation in the human species occurs within a given human ethnic
group, and only a small fraction between different races. That means that on average, there is
more genetic difference between individuals within a race than there is between races
themselves. Nevertheless, there are some genes (including the genes for morphological
differences such as body shape, facial features, skin pigmentation, hair texture, and the like)
that have not yet been subject to DNA sequencing, and if one looked only at those genes, one
would obviously find more genetic differences. But since the delimitation of races has
historically depended not on the degree of underlying genetic differences but only on the
existence of some genetic difference that causes morphological difference, the genetic
similarity of races does not mean that they don’t exist.
Further, one wouldn’t expect human “races” or ethnic groups to show substantial genetic
differences—there hasn’t been enough time for those differences to accumulate given that
most human groups arose since our migration out of Africa between 60,000 and 100,000
years ago.
Nevertheless, even if most human variation occurs within rather than between races, there
are statistical differences between human groups that can, when combined, be used to delimit
them. Here’s a figure from the paper by Noah Rosenberg et al. (reference at the bottom) that
uses these “multilocus” genotypes to distinguish human populations. Their study involved
1056 individuals studied from 52 geographic populations. The genetic analysis was
comprehensive, involving 377 autosomal microsatellite loci (“autosomal loci” means “genes
not on the two sex chromosomes”).
Rosenberg et al. fed the genetic data into a clustering algorithm that sorts individuals into a
pre-specified number of groups, K (they used Ks between 2 and 6). I show below the data
from predetermined clusters numbering 4,5, and 6. That algorithm sorts out populations into
pretty distinctive genetic groups (remember, this involves combining data from many genes):
either 5 or 6. At a sorting algorithm involving 5 groups, the authors note that the genetic
clusters “corresponded largely to major geographic regions.” Those regions are roughly sub
Saharan Africa, Europe and the Middle East, Eastern Asia, Melanesia and Oceania, and the
America. At K = 6, we get another group, the Kailash of northern Pakistan.

Of course, each of these groups can be more finely subdivided in terms of population
structure: here are clustering algorithms used in determining substructure in America and the
Middle East:
This shows the difficulty of answering the question of “how many races are there?” One could
call Eurasians a race, or one could call Bedouins a race. It all depends on how finely you want
to divide things up, and this is precisely what is expected if populations have evolutionary
ancestry, which produces clusters of groups nested within each other. What is clear, though,
is that human populations are genetically different, and can be diagnosed as genetically
different using multiple pieces of DNA. Thus, although you may not be able to determine the
geographic origin of a single person simply by looking at her morphology, you may be able to
do that pretty accurately by combining information from lots of genes. I’m not aware that
anybody has tested the accuracy of diagnosing a single indvidual’s geographic origin from her
multilocus genotype; if such studies exist, please let me know.
Why do these differences exist?
The short answer is, of course, evolution. The groups exist because human populations have
an evolutionary history, and, like different species themselves, that ancestry leads to
clustering and branching, though humans have a lot of genetic interchange between the
branches!

https://whyevolutionistrue.com/2012/02/28/are-there-human-races/ 5/71
But what evolutionary forces caused the differentiation? It’s undoubtedly a combination of
natural selection (especially for the morphological traits) and genetic drift, which will both lead
to the accumulation of genetic differences between isolated populations. What I want to
emphasize is that even for the morphological differences between human “races,” we have
virtually no understanding of how evolution produced them. It’s pretty likely that skin
pigmentation resulted from natural selection operating differently in different places, but even
there we’re not sure why (the classic story involved selection for protection against
melanoma-inducing sunlight in lower latitudes, and selection for lighter pigmentation at higher
latitudes to allow production of vitamin D in the skin; but this has been called into question by
some workers).
As for things like differences in hair texture, eye shape, and nose shape, we have no idea.
Genetic drift is one explanation, but I suspect, given the profound differences between
regions, that some form of selection is involved. In WEIT I float the idea that sexual selection
may be responsible: mate preferences for certain appearances differed among regions,
leading to all those physical differences that distinguish groups. But we have no evidence for
this. The advantage of this hypothesis is that sexual selection operates quickly, and could
have differentiated populations in only 50,000 years or so, and it also operates largely on
external appearance, explaining why the genes for morphology show much more
differentiation among populations than random samples of microsatellite genes, whose
function we don’t know.
What are the implications of these differences?
Not much. There are some medical implications. As is well known to doctors, different
populations have different frequencies of ailments. Some of that could, of course, be due to
cultural rather than genetic differences, but some is undoubtedly genetic, and that should be
taken into account when diagnosing an individual. Sickle-cell anemia, for example, is much
more prevalent among sub-Saharan Africans and their descendants (e.g., American blacks
brought over as slaves) than among Eurasians. Ashkenazi Jews, too, have their own unique
spectrum of genetic diseases.
Everyone wants to know, of course, if different races differ genetically in their abilities,
especially intelligence. While I think there may be statistical differences among races in these
things, it’s not as obvious that sexual (or natural) selection would operate as strongly on
genes involving these traits as on superficial external characteristics. We just don’t know, and
in the complete absence of data it is invidious to speculate on these things. It’s just as
scientifically unsupported to say, for example, that there is no difference among populations in
mathematical ability as it is to say that there are differences. In the absence of data, we
must follow the apophatic theologians and remain silent. And, at any rate, any such
differences cannot be used to justify racism given the tremendous variation we see in other
genes between members of different populations.
One can argue whether it’s even justifiable to scientifically study things like differences in IQ
between populations given the political ramifications of finding differences. I go back and
forth on this, but tend to think that it’s more interesting scientifically to study the differences
that we know exist—in things like eye shape and skin pigmentation—and try to figure out why
evolution promoted those differences.

I haven’t talked much about Sapp’s review, as I find it tendentious; nor have I read the books
he’s reviewing. Perhaps I’ll change my mind about race after reading them, but based on
what I know about human population differentiation, for now I think that “races” are
biologically real (though we can’t delimit them precisely), and are certainly not “sociocultural
constructs.” The “sociological constructs” thing is simply political correctness imposed on
biological reality. In view of the morphological and genetic differences among human
populations, how can such differences be “constructs”?

I think there is a bigger problem, and I don’t think Jerry makes a good argument for the
utility of the race concept. Of course, there is genetic variation among indigenous peoples
around the world, and some of this variation involves obvious phenotypic traits, like
degree of melanism. Howver, for race to be meaningful, there should be DISCRETE
variation among a relatively small number of groups, and the defining characters can’t be
arbitrary. It has long been known that the number of subspecies or races in a particular
vertebrate depends on which characters are arbitrarily chosen. The fact that human global
genetic and phenotypic variation can be parsed into 3 to 30 races tells you that the
concept of race is biologically meaningless. I defy anyone to travel from Lappland to India
and tell me exactly where the “white” or “Caucasian” race ends. Medicine should continue
to probe genetic differences among different peoples, but terms like white, African, Asian
races are downright misleading.

No one claims that races, either in humans or other animals, must be clear divisions.
The best way to illustrate is by pointing out the problems with defining species– there
are tons of species concepts. However, the fact that there is no clear concept doesn’t
invalidate the idea of races and species.
Moreover, the idea of human races has utility in science as well as society. For the
former, genetic studies such as genome-wide association studies acquire data that
needs to be controlled for by race. For the latter, the simple fact that we still use racial
concepts means that it has utility. No one, for instance, talks about darker-pigmented
individuals-of-African-extraction-with-significant-admixture-with-ligher-pigmented
inviduals-of-European-extraction civil rights movement.

We often “use” categories that are artificial and arbitrary – that criterion does not
make those categories definable in a discrete objective way. I think Jerry would
argue with you that species are arbitrarily defined, or that all species concepts are
equally real. As for your last sentence, the fact that we call folks with a minority of
their genes from Africans African-Americans proves my point that the common use
is biologically meaningless and misleading. Many “African Americans” derive a
majority of their genes from non-Africans – the designation is cultural, not
biological.

You make my point for me. Breaking up the electromagnetic spectrum into discrete

can still use “red” and “orange” in a practical way, just as we can use “dark” and
“light” skin, but that does NOT make them objective, discrete categories. I never
said the phrase “dark” or “light” skin is meaningless, I said that discrete, objectively
defined races (based on continuous variation in skin color, say) are BIOLOGICALLY
meaningless. Same with the color palette.

The review by Jan Sapp is PC run wild and doesnt deserve further comment.
About red and orange, you are missing the point. They are NOT separated,
discrete entities and neither are races (and Jerry said so) but they are still useful
terms and we generally know what they mean. Race has been muddled by the
“social construction of race” but does have a useful meaning in biology (and
maybe in sociology, but previous errors will have to be dealt with). But given
that the social construction IS so muddled, and the politics around it
(particularly in the Eurocentric world we live in) so extreme (not just from teh
racists, but equally or even more muddled from the anti-racists) that one can
definitely argue in favor of dropping the term and using “population” or
“ethnicity” instead.
But to say it is “meaningless” in principle is rather ignorant.

Omar, you are right, but once we replace the word “race” with something
neutral, most of the motivation for trying to do differential analysis will also
disappear. The study of human subspecies is interesting mainly to the extent
it addresses the sociocultural construct of “race”. Without that, the debate
will mainly be of interest to evolutionary biologists and geneticists. That
doesn’t make it irrelevant, and arguably increases its rigor, but it won’t be
the subject of popular books like the ones Sapp reviews.

I’m with you here, Jerry. As I started reading this, I was thinking of the results of Rosenberg
et al. (or something similar that I’d seen).
I think it is important to acknowledge that there are significant differences in different human
populations, whether you call them races (which is clearly politically loaded), subspecies
(which could be taken as a slur, if “sub” is misunderstood!) or ecotypes (probably the best
term to use, then — it sounds, um, clinical), for at least medical reasons (as you note). One
instance of difference (by gender as well as ecotype) that I’ve come across professionally is
that Asian women tend to have poorly defined Galton ridge patterns which means that they
have (more!) difficulty using some kinds of biometric fingerprint sensors.

Further thoughts:
• The editors of the New Oxford American Dictionary seem clued in (under “race”):
“Scientifically it is accepted as obvious that there are subdivisions of the human species,
but it is also clear that genetic variation between individuals of the same race can be as
great as that between members of different races.”
• Isn’t the existence of “race” implicit in declarations of human rights and anti-racist
legislation? If expert witnesses can be called to testify “race” doesn’t exist, what would
lawyers make of statements like “discrimination on the basis of race”?
• It seems to be more widely accepted that “ethnic groups” actually exist. (Please rebut.)
Is there any recognised ethnic group that spans non-contiguous races? Or are all such
groups “social clades within biological clades”?

it is accepted as obvious that there are subdivisions, BUT....and then they
give a statement about variation, as if this should shed doubt on the

Jerry’s about variation do not imply that subdivisions are weak. Jerry’s

This only assumes that race has a sociological reality, not a biological one. There are
many examples of racism that don’t depend on genetics, like the English and English

“racism”-like behavior appears, such as with the baffling case of the Cagots in France:

There is a purely mathematical misconception (which is almost unversal among biologists)
embodied in your argument, Jerry. It’s one I have mentioned before here. You said races are
not very different because the variation between races is much smaller than the variation
within races. This was also Lewontin’s argument in his paper “The apportionment of human
diversity”, in which entropy was the measure of “variation” or “diversity”, and similar
arguments are usually made today using heterozygosity as the the measure of “variation” or
“diversity”. (The between-group variation is calculated by subtracting the within-group

As anyone can confirm by numerical examples, for both those measures of variation, when
within-group variation is high, the between-group variation is ALWAYS small compared to the
within-group variation, and the ratio of between-group variation to total variation approaches
zero, even if the groups share no genes whatsoever!!!
The whole science of population genetics (and a vast literature in ecology as well) is based on
this misconception that any high school student could disprove by example in five minutes.
Kind of embarassing...
Use Google Scholar to look up [Jost diversity] to learn more about this error and how to
correct it.
Of course, this is a criticism of the argument, not its conclusions. At most loci, diversity is not
high, and the races are very similar.

Well, yeah... dividing genetic variation into within-group and between-group portions just
gives you an estimate of the relative contribution of each. If one of them goes up, the
other one certainly ought to go down!

That is not right. Dividing the total variation into within- and between-group
components does depend on the absolute amount of variation, and the within-group
variation does not go down just because the between-group variation goes up. And
yes, the ratio of between-group to total variation is (wrongly) interpreted to tell us

But the within-group variation is not always high. And even then, it is always

For N demes or groups, if entropy is the measure of variation or diversity,
between-group variation cannot exceed log N, while within-group variation has
no upper bound. So when within-group variation is high (>> log N), between
group variation will always be much smaller than within-group variation.
If heterozygosity is used as the measure of variation or genetic diversity (as it is
in population genetics), then both the within-group heterozygosity and the

Why is that a bad thing?
For instance, suppose instead of data involving heterozygosity, we have a
very simple case: a single locus in a haploid organism and we’re looking at
the identify of the allele at that locus for each individual. At one extreme, a
single allele could be present in every individual. So we have no grouping
information. For any division of these individuals into two groups, both
within-group and between-group variation should be 0. At the other extreme,
every individual could have a different allele. That still means we have no
grouping information. If we divide such a population into two groups, our
measure of within-group variation should be 1 (it can’t get any more
variable) and our measure of between-group variation should be 0 (there is
no grouping information whatsoever). In between those extremes, suppose
half the individuals have allele “1” and half have allele “2”; if individuals are
binned by allele, our measure of within-group variation ought to be 0 and our
measure of between-group variation ought to be 1.
There are problems with using heterozygosity as a measure of genetic
variation, but the fact that our ability to infer between-group differentiation
diminishes as variation within groups increases is not one of them – that’s
precisely what should happen. At the upper limit of complete genetic
differentiation between all individuals, there is no grouping information;
between-group variation -should- approach zero as you approach this upper
limit.

Sure, but the magnitude of total variation is not represented in the resulting
compartmentalization of x% within-group & y% between-group.
“the within-group variation does not go down just because the between-group
variation goes up.”
Well, I suppose the total variation could just go up. Hold the total variation
constant... or just express it in terms of proportions of total variation, as Jerry does
in the original post... and, yes, if between-group variation goes up, within-group
variation must go down.
“And yes, the ratio of between-group to total variation is (wrongly) interpreted to

I think you have this backwards. Interpreting the ratio of between-group to total
variation as an absolute measure of differentiation between groups would be wrong.
However, there’s nothing wrong with interpreting it as a relative measure of
differentiation between groups.

AFAICT, those are properties that a relative measure of genetic differentiation ought
to have. They aren’t flaws unless you’re misusing the technique to address some

groups share alleles, for instance, this isn’t the way to do it. It’s not supposed to be.

Patrick, thanks for the detailed and interesting comments. You are using a
different sense of “differentiation” than I am, almost an opposite sense. To
identify which sense is the appropriate one for the argument about races, I took
an evolutionary view. If a panmictic population is split by a (possibly leaky)
barrier into two demes, the demes will eventually (if the barrier is not too leaky)
diverge genetically. If the barrier is complete, they will eventually share no
alleles (because of mutation+drift). What relative measure of differentiation
tracks that increasing divergence reliably? By a “relative” measure, we should
mean a measure that is zero for the first extreme (panmixia) and unity for the
end state (no shared alleles). The end state would, if it lasted long enough,
generally result in reproductive isolation and speciation, along the lines of
Gavrilet’s speciation models. So the question is, where are human races in this
continuum? And my point is that we cannot tell this by comparing within-group
variation to between-group variation as Jerry did, or by looking at the ratio of
additive between-group variation to total variation. I gather you agree with that,
you just think it is the wrong question.
Your argument is that if within-group diversity is very high, the groups are in a
sense artificial, because ANY arbitrary division of the population will result in
groups that show high differentiation between them. I agree with that, and it is
a good point. Nevertheless the answer to the question “Are there genetic
differences between a given set of groups?” is yes. This is a question about the
absolute differences, and is not answered by the ratio of between-group to total
variation.
Also, suppose we have more than two groups. Suppose there are lots of groups,
all but one of them fixed for the same allele. The odd one out is fixed for a
different allele (to ensure that we don’t divide by zero when dividing by total
variation). Now the measure of relative differentiation you support is equal to
unity, indicating maximum relative differentiation. What does that mean? The
population shows almost no differentiation between groups; most groups are
genetically identical. These groups would be more differentiated if each were
fixed for a unique allele. So I am puzzled , it seems your ratio is not a

Perhaps the two relevant questions are:
1) How different are genotypes in the groups in question?
2) To what extent do our data indicate that whatever differences exist are in
fact due to divergence between groups?
AFAICT, you’re interested in answering the first question. This does seem like
a useful thing to know, but in isolation I do not think it gets us very far.
Measures like Fst are designed (though perhaps not ideally) to address the
second question; which, to my mind, is more evolutionarily informative. It is
a relative measure in a different sense than that you’ve indicated – i.e., it
tells us how genetically distinct groups are relative to the observed variation
and its distribution among sampled individuals. What sense we make of
genetic divergence should depend to a large extent on the amount and
distribution of variation. For instance, in a simple haploid one-locus example,
if all individuals have different alleles the fact that groups pulled from that
sampling do not share alleles is not informative about divergence between
groups. None of that variation can be attributed to group-level dynamics,
since there is no grouping information present – all individuals are different.
If we look at differentiation among groups of humans, knowing the answer to
question “1” does not, of itself, tell us if races are real biological groupings.
High variation between individuals in the sample as a whole could lead us to
conclude that the groups are genetically distinct (and evolutionarily
divergent!) even if variation is distributed randomly. On the other hand,
methods like Fst that address question “2” are specifically designed to
identify non-random distributions in which genotypes are relatively
homogeneous within groups but heterogeneous between groups. That is the
kind of distribution that can allow us to identify group-level divergence.
Or, in other words, answering question “1” tells us about pattern only;
answering question “2” is more useful for linking that pattern to a process.
“Also, suppose we have more than two groups. Suppose there are lots of
groups, all but one of them fixed for the same allele. The odd one out is fixed
for a different allele (to ensure that we don’t divide by zero when dividing by

equal to unity, indicating maximum relative differentiation. What does that
mean? The population shows almost no differentiation between groups; most
groups are genetically identical. These groups would be more differentiated if
each were fixed for a unique allele.”
How much variation is observed in a sample plays a key role in our ability to
identify groups, and is something we must account for. At the extremes, if
we gather genotypes for a sample of individuals and find no variation, maybe
there are no genetically distinct groups within the sample, or maybe we just
happened to choose a locus (or loci) that shows very low variation regardless
of how genetically distinct individuals are in the genome as a whole.
Alternatively, if we gather genotypes for a sample of individuals and find that
all individuals are completely different, maybe each individual was pulled
from a genetically distinct group, or maybe we just happened to choose a
locus (or loci) that varies tremendously even if the rest of the genome is
pretty homogeneous among the sampled individuals. Asking only how much
variation exists between groups provides absolutely no ability to distinguish
these alternatives. What we (or at least, I) really want to know is: given that
we have observed some level of variation among individuals, to what extent
can we infer that there are groupings of individuals within the sample? I
don’t think any methods can answer this question perfectly, but some are at
least designed to do our best to disentangle grouping information from
various other factors (things like mutation rate and size of the available
character space for the loci sampled).
“So I am puzzled , it seems your ratio is not a reasonable measure of relative
differentiation, at least in the sense relevant to this discussion. Am I
misunderstanding something you said?”
If we have putative groups and some observed data, and all of the data can
be attributed to divergence between the putative groups, that’s what I would
call maximum group-level differentiation. It is maximal relative to how much
variation is observed; it is not maximal relative to how much variation might
have been observed in a different, hypothetical, data set (e.g., some other
locus that evolves more rapidly).

If you can answer your Question 1 quantitatively, and you can connect
the answer to the demographic and genetic variables describing the
groups (migration rate, mutation rate, group size, number of groups),
then you have the answer to your Question 2. It is as easy to connect
pure differentiation to those parameters as it is to connect Gst or Fst to
them.

Ayala did an interesting study many years ago (I am travelling so I do not
have the reference at hand) applying a measure of pure genetic
differentiation to populations, subspecies, and species of fruit flies. He
also did breeding tests to see if the groups being tested were interfertile.
He found that the measure of pure differentiation (the same one I
derived) described very well the degree of distinctness of these forms as
measured by inter-form fertility. True species (exhibiting complete
reproductive isolation) showed values of differentiation near unity, while
completely interfertile forms showed small differentiation. These results
would not have been the same using Gst or Fst; the results would have
depended on the within-group diversity of the locus.

I concluded that the Smith and Grassle expected species index was the best (your

related to the number of species.

Bird et al. 2011 compared the performance of both the recommended method of genetic
differentiation by Jost 2008 (D sub est) and the more tradition fixation indices in their
ability to detect genetic differentiation in simulated populations. In short, they found that
no one metric was consistently the most accurate in reflecting genetic differentiation, and
recommended using a combination of (D sub est) and the old F and G fixation indices.

Actually they found that it depended very much on the question being asked. When the
question is about genetic differentiation rather than nearness to fixation, they
recommend my D. “It is immediately apparent for all comparisons in Figure 7B–E,
regardless of haplotype diversity
and genetic distance between populations, that Dest is the most consistently accurate
measure of
genetic differentiation.”
This is one of the most conceptually clear articles comparing my approach to the
traditional one based on Jerry’s comparison of within- and between-group variance, but
the authors do make one mistake worth noting. They state that a high value of Fst
represents nearness to alternate fixation (each deme fixed for a different allele). If this
were true, then Fst could be considered a kind of differentiation measure when
diversity is low. However, Fst =1.00 even if nearly all demes are fixed for the same
allele. Thus it fails to work as a measure of differentiation at both the low-diversity
regime and the high-diversity regime (and everywhere in between).

it, is socially constructed. There might be biological races out there, but I don’t think anyone
would agree that Uighyurs and Italians are the same race.
Also, what does the K5 separation of middle eastern types show? Does it show races or does it
show populations that are extremely well mixed? And if we accept that you can have a set of
races, but that they’re very mixed together, then what do you even have? And what does it
say if one person IDs one array of races and another person IDs another array, etc etc? If we
were talking about species, we’d say ‘none of you are able to identify species, to answer the
species question’.
I suppose one of the things that makes analysis here especially difficult is that, on the one
hand you have lineages, and that implies that you’re going to have something like ‘races’. On
the other hand, different from species (at least the type most of us think about) you have
massive horizontal transfer between these lineages.
Considering that, apparently, anatomically modern humans were interbreeding successfully
with Neanderthals, Denisovans, and who knows what else, ‘race’ probably isn’t going to mean

I think you have exposed the problem with racial definition of humans. The term race is ill
defined in social context even if an ambiguous defintion is satisfactory in scientific study.
Is someone of a race if the are not geographically isolated anymore. That is race cannot be an
individual characteristic rather only a population characteristic.
If there is a group of humans with morphological distinction living in relative isolation, then
you might define that group as a race. If one member leaves and moves elsewhere, breeds
with other humans not from that group. They have now changed there race.
They may well have geneic ancestry that ties them to that group.
Otherwise, you are saying that any morphological distinction defines race regardless of the
population. So now tall people are a race distinct from short people. which perhaps we knew
from an old song....

Thank you for this: a perfectly straightforward presentation of a perfectly sensible approach.
I’ve lost friends over this argument. A lot of people seem to think that the empirical study of
human population genetics ended, or should have, with Lewontin 1972.
None of the genetic facts contradict the concept of socially constructed race concepts, of
course. It’s just an acknowledgment that some aspects of some socially constructed race
concepts do have a biological foundation.
In WEIT I float the idea that sexual selection may be responsible: mate preferences for
certain appearances differed among regions, leading to all those physical differences that
distinguish groups.
Credit where due, wasn’t this the original argument of C. Darwin 1871?

Why is it that the skin tone of a child is midway between that of racially different parents?
Barack Obama is a much lighter skin color than his father and much darker than his mother.

Same with every other “mixed race” (for lack of a better term) child.
Why should this be so? Most other physical features aren’t a “blend”. If they were, all of
Mendel’s peas would have ended up being a blended color. And Jerry’s beloved fruit flies would
have pink eyes, not either red or white.

Here’s a review that discusses pigmentation genes.

I also disagree that you are seeing a ‘blended’ phenotype for the simple reason that
the offspring of the next generation (i.e. a mixed (black-white) race individual
producing children with a white person) are usually not halfway between their
parents. They are either the same color as the mixed race parent or the same color
as the white parent. This is consistent with a model suggested (i.e. skin color
involves a combination of several different genes).

The medical applications of “racial genetics” are even broader than alluded to here.
Theoretically, EVERY SINGLE disease has a genetic component somewhere down the line. If
not the classic Mendelian-type diseases (which Jerry mentions, but which are usually rare),
then there will still be genetic differences in the host response to the exact same disease
process (whether infectious or non-infectious) or to the same treatment.
Just to choose two common conditions, it has been shown that there are genetic racial
differences in responses to anti-hypertensives, as well as cardiac failure medications. Putting
it more bluntly, doctors already know that the best way to treat a black patient with one of
these conditions is often different to the best way to treat a white patient with the same
condition. Knowing this sort of information saves lives.

What are the implications of these differences?
It shouldn’t be controversial to observe that an algorithm can look at a person’s genetic
makeup and with very good odds determine where their ancestors are from.
But beyond k-means clustering, it’s also important to measure the fraction of genetic variance
determined by race versus the variation observed in the entire population. The fixation index
FST does this, and when you measure the genetic difference between human races, racial
variance only accounts for 10–20% of human genetic variance at most (difference between
Africans and Australians from the rest), with significantly smaller differences between other
races.
FST measurements support JC’s views on the existence of race, but they also quantify just
how silly racial theories and prejudices are.

Steve, I guess you didn’t read my Comment 8. Fst and Gst are based on serious
misconceptions about the mathematics of diversity and differentiation, and do not
measure differentiation between groups. Fst can approach zero (supposedly indicating no
differentiation) even when the groups share no alleles. If we look at high-diversity loci, Fst
will always be near zero, even if the groups belong to entirely different species. You cannot
argue from Fst that racial differences are small.
By the way, Fst or Gst can equal unity even if almost all groups are fixed for the same
allele, which makes it even more useless.
See my article, “Gst and its relatives do not measure differentition”, (2008) Molecular
Ecology 17: 4015–4026, and the many articles that have built on it over the last few
years. Or check out the Nature Population Genetics Forum for much discussion of the
topic.

Whether they’re based on misconceptions or simplifying assumptions about the
diversity of the underlying populations, there certainly are several other mathematically
superior models, all of which to my knowledge lead us to the same conclusion about
human populations. Wikipedia, my italics:
Long and Kittles find that rather than 85% of human genetic diversity existing in all
human populations, about 100% of human diversity exists in a single African
population, whereas only about 70% of human genetic diversity exists in a
population derived from New Guinea. Long and Kittles argued that this still
produces a global human population that is genetically homogeneous compared to
other mammalian populations.

That’s fine, I am not really saying anything about the actual differentiation (which I
know nothing about). I am just trying to get us to stick to valid arguments.
Arguments based on Fst such as you made are not valid arguments about the
amount of genetic differentiation between races. (And this lack of validity doesn’t
depend on model assumptions. It is a basic mathematical problem of mistaking Fst
as a measure of genetic differentiation.) Your conclusions, though, could still be
valid by accident.

That genetic variation between human populations is measurably small is a valid
argument, whether you estimate this variation using the measures FST, GST, or
your own D (each having its own strengths and flaws). We should not expect,
and do not see, a big difference with these measures applied to different races
because total human genetic variation itself is small, having gone through the
out-of-Africa bottleneck. This example doesn’t match the valid high-diversity
counterexample. There’s a whole bunch of complicating factors to account for:
mutation rates, independence, number of genes, and so forth. GST is still a
useful measure of genetic differentiation—a comment on Jost’s D:
D is not a useful measure when interest is focused on demographic processes
such as genetic drift and migration
Nevertheless, I’d expect the same conclusions whether we measure racial
differences using D or the traditional ones.

Again, I was not criticizing your conclusions, just the method of reaching
them via Fst or Gst alone. One other comment on Fst or Gst: even when
diversity is very low (all demes fixed for a single allele), it still doesn’t
measure the actual differentiation between demes; if there are 100 demes,
with 99 of them fixed for the same allele, and the 100th deme fixed for a
different allele, this would be a very homogeneous set of demes (99% of
them are genetically identical), but Gst would equal 1.00, indicating
maximum differentiation.
As for the Ryman and Leimar article you mention, I hope you have read the
article of mine that rebuts it (mine follows the article you cited). Gst is not a
measure of the differences in gene frequencies between groups. And Ryman
and Leimar’s negative conclusions about a real measure of genetic
differentiation (like my D) are backward; real measures of differentiation
don’t connect to Ryman and Leimar’s favorite demographic factors because
those are not the factors that influence divergence. See my simulations in
the Comment section of the following post on the Molecular Ecologist blog for
graphic proof:

Intelligence is a very subjective trait. If I were compared to a New Guinea native (because
I just reread Guns, Germs, & Steel a few months ago), I probably beat said person on a
writing or mathematics test, but not because I’m Caucasian but because I was born into
an upper-middle class American family and therefore received a good quality education
that was focused on those subjects.
The New Guinean, conversely, would blow me out of the water on any test focused on
things like finding food or constructing a shelter in New Guinea. Again, not because of

I’ve always felt that dog breeds are a good analogy for human races. Different varieties of
dog “breed true”, i.e. cocker spaniel parents will always have cocker spaniel pups, never
great danes or chihuahuas, yet given the chance all types of dog will happily interbreed
with each other. As a result, there exists every shade of intermediate, and many dogs
can’t be assigned to any specific breed at all. This seems to parallel the human situation
quite closely, although dog breeds are far more divergent physically than human races.
Yet for some reason when I’ve made this argument in company I sometimes get
disapproving comments. It’s as if for some people even the idea of “race” is a kind of
taboo, and anyone who suggests there may be some validity to the concept is obviously a

Just wanted to point out that “socially constructed” vs. “biological” concepts of race is a false
dichotomy. In the OP, Jerry explains that there could be a biological basis for race. As other
commenters have observed, the distinctions (in particular which genetic loci you use for the
sorting) are actually arbitrary so this exercise is less discovering the genetic basis of race and
more defining the genetic basis of race.
But biological race is not what most people have in mind when they think about “race.” Just
because there may be some biological basis for talking about race does not mean there is not
at the same time a socially constructed concept of race, and the socially constructed concept
is what people react to. For white Americans, black is probably black whether we’re talking
about a 1/8th black American mixed-race person or a pure-blooded San villager from Africa.
Furthermore, the biological basis of race could not possibly inform the views of the “average
person” on race because the “average person” simply does not know enough about genetics
for this to be the case. To the extent that race matters in society — i.e. to the extent that it
engenders racism — it is the socially constructed concept of race that is in play, not the poorly
understood and obscure biological concept of race.

There are real biological variations in the human species. The problem is that our divisions are
inaccurate, or just plan wrong. The original source of error was the Bible. Remember the sons
of Noah? Shem, Ham and Japheth. Ham gave rise to Hamites (Africans), Shem to Semites
(Middle Easterners) and Japheth to white people (or Caucasians). The writers of Genesis
didn’t know much about Asians or Native Americans. Our modern classification scheme
(White, Black, Asian, Native American, etc.) is a slight modification of the biblical scheme with
a few races added here and there. The divisions are arbitrary because we were unaware of the
underlying genetics (and we still are, for the most part).
There has been, however, some recent developments in analyzing mitochondrial DNA and y
chromosome genetic markers that gives us much more reliable information on human
variation. One of the most startling finding is that we are less genetically diverse than we
think we are, and there is less genetic diversity in humans then in other primate species. And
this is primarily due to the fact that we had very little time to diversify. Humans have
experienced a ‘bottle-neck’ sometime around 70,000 years ago in which the world population
of the human species was reduced to a few thousand people and only diversified in the past
60,000 years.
Add to that, the habit of some humans to have sex with humans of other races. Try dividing
Brazilians or Mexicans into separate races. There was so much mixing going in Latin America
that you could never implement an affirmative action program there. That’s also why the U.S.
Census bureau has a separate question for Hispanic origins that now comes before the race

Though DeMille could not explicitly identify a black women as Moses’ wife in the

That DeMille cast Moses’ black wife almost makes up for his artistic license taken

Dear Professor Coyne:
I quite agree, but I also think there’s a second way to think about race. Instead of thinking of
races as smaller, vaguer species, it can be quite helpful to think of them as larger extended
families that are made more coherent and longer-lasting than the typical extended families we
are all familiar with due to some degree of inbreeding. In this view, a racial group is a partly
inbred extended family.

This is a comment on the various subthreads discussing diversity measurement between Lou

The main problem is that standard diversity measures don’t partition nicely in the way that
variance does. Hence when we read things like “only 5% of variation is between populations”
it is easy to think that this is like the R^2 in regression or the between group mean square in
ANOVA, but it isn’t.
Sums of squares, used for measuring variation in numerical data, behave beautifully like
kittens, you can divide up the various sources of variation nicely and meaningfully. However
standard diversity indices, used for measuring variation in categorical variables, don’t have
these nice properties, so if you interpret them as though they do then you can easily deceive
yourself.

The number of human races delimited by biologists has ranged from three to over thirty.
I’ve seen a classification with 66 human races. There were really pedantic splitters around in
the early 20th century.
An important issue that I haven’t seen addressed here is that, although many genes show
geographic variation in humans, different genes commonly have totally different geographic
variation. Skin color doesn’t covary with any blood type, and so on. So why privilege skin
color over blood type or anything else? Just because it happens to be visible at first glance?
Or why don’t we delimit races based on hair color – just because several colors can be found
in most places in Europe (and this state has been prevailing for millennia now), right?
The mentioned covariation of some medically relevant genotypes with skin color in the US
happens to work in the US because most of the slaves shipped to the US came from a rather
small area, the coast of northern Angola and a few other patches on the western coast of
Africa. I bet if you’d apply this medical knowledge to, say, Ethiopia, it would fail pretty
spectacularly.

Human intelligence has no doubt been under extremely heavy selective pressures in the last
100k years or so, almost certainly as much so as morphological features like skin color, nose
shape or hair texture. To believe that evolution can affect the latter traits but not the former is
a matter of ideology or religion, not science. There is no good reason to believe, a priori, that
the different geographical and social environments, into which human populations had been
relatively isolated for the past 50k years, would all have exerted the same exact pressures on
the development of cognitive ability, or that the geographically separated sub-species would
all have simultaneously developed the same intelligence-enhancing genetic adaptations
regardless of differences in the sizes of their populations or in the cognitive demands of their
environment. It is a reasonable hypothesis, for example, that the need of some human
populations, once they had migrated out of Africa’s warm climate, to survive long winters of
scarcity in northern Ice Age climes, would have brought about psychological changes–for
example, a greater capacity to defer immediate gratification, a greater tendency toward long
term monogyny, a disposition toward dispassionate abstract thought, etc. Likewise, it is
reasonable to investigate whether the rise of agriculture and state-based civilization would
have placed very different selective pressures on the affected human populations, resulting in
their differentiation, psychologically, from small hunter/gatherer band-based societies that did
not undergo these monumental social changes. It wouldn’t be unreasonable to hypothesize
that such pressures have resulted not only in the observed differences in mean IQ among
different populations, but in other non-cognitive psychological differences as well (self
restraint, tendency to aggression and criminality, etc). But these reasonable hypotheses can’t
even be explored in American academies. To do so is to invite opprobrium and ostracism.

FWIW, and in case no one else said it, yet, human races are like domestic cat or dog species.
Very different breeds can cross and too much inbreeding brings out recessive traits, some of
which are dangerous.
I once had a patient with ordinary caucasion appearance, sickle cell anemia and beta
thallasemia. He was of southern Italian descent. While SCA is more common in subsaharan
Africa, it’s not so uncommon around the Mediterranean.
Sometimes, I wonder if the antisemitism which accompanied the Disapora, pogroms and

The problem is that Prof. Coyne is using the terms “race” and “ecotype” interchangeably. But
when certain elements of society talk about “race” they do not mean ecotypes. Pigliucci and
Kaplan (2003) explains:
“We argue that human races, in the biological sense of local populations adapted to particular
environments, do in fact exist; such races are best understood through the common
ecological concept of ecotypes. However, human ecotypic races do not in general correspond
with “folk” racial categories, largely because many similar ecotypes have multiple independent
origins. Consequently, while human natural races exist [i.e. ecotypes – E. K.], they have little
or nothing in common with ‘folk’ races.”
So “races” are in this sense non-monophyletic form groups. No one is denying that you can
group humans according to morphology if you want, but it will not reflect evolutionary

You’ve got that backwards. “Races” emerged from a mostly continuous population of

Nick Matzke has a fine reply to Jerry at Panda’s Thumb, one that makes all the points I would
have made if I had been enterprising enough to do the work.
Summary: the mere existence of geographically structured variation isn’t enough to tell us
there are races or subspecies. The variation has to separate neatly into discrete bins. If the
variation is, on the other hand, clinal (i.e. if the differences between distant areas are the
result of isolation by distance, as Jerry in fact mentioned), then you don’t have discrete races.
That doesn’t mean people haven’t tried, in other animals as well as humans. But the
subspecies descriptions in such cases don’t hold up under examination. Sure, Chinese are
different from Europeans. But look in between China and Europe and you will find a fairly
smooth transitional series. As Jerry also mentioned, subspecies in other taxa are most often
geographically separated from each other, which allows for discrete variation, private alleles,
and such. Human populations, on the other hand, have seldom been isolated for very long,
with the possible exception of the now-extinct Tasmanians.

But their variation is not into distinct races but just a matter of nearby people

See Rosenberg’s 2005 paper on clines and clusters.
“For population pairs from the same cluster, as geographic distance increases, genetic
distance increases in a linear manner, consistent with a clinal population structure.
However, for pairs from different clusters, genetic distance is generally larger than that
between intracluster pairs that have the same geographic distance. For example, genetic
distances for population pairs with one population in Eurasia and the other in East Asia are
greater than those for pairs at equivalent geographic distance within Eurasia or within East
Asia. Loosely speaking, it is these small discontinuous jumps in genetic distance—across
oceans, the Himalayas, and the Sahara—that provide the basis for the ability of

My understanding is that there has been regular gene flow between Australia and

discontinuous jumps
That’s just a little more geographic structuring. And it would indeed result in
subspecies/races if there were no contact through or around the barriers (and if that
were continued for long enough). But in no case, other than perhaps Tasmania, is that
true. Wide oceans have been complete barriers for most of history, but mountains and
deserts have not. And in all cases there are corridors of contact — ways around the
barrier — even between Eurasia and the Americas. This is just a wrinkle on isolation by
distance — some distances are greater than their straight-line separation would
suggest. Still no distinct races.

John, the quantity that determines the equilibrium value of differentiation at a
neutral locus in a subdivided population is P/u, the pairwise migration rate divided
by the mutation rate. This shows that your absolutist view is wrong; the key
quantity is the proportion of the population which migrates, not the absolute
number of migrants. And in human populations separated by geographic barriers
like large deserts or mountains, the migrants surely make up a very small
proportion of the population. That means drift and mild selective pressures can
produce strong differentiation.

RACISM is the belief that there are innate differences between racial groups on traits other
than merely superficial traits such as skin color, facial features, and hair texture.
Cognitive ability differences:
East Asians (Han Chinese, Koreans, and Japanese) tend to have higher math ability and
higher IQs than Whites who tend to have higher math ability and higher IQs than Blacks. This
is an empirical fact that anyone can validate by accessing test score data from hundreds of
datasets (with any dataset that includes racial population group samples with reasonably large
numbers there are essentially no exceptions). Math ability and IQ type intelligence (g-factor)
are both highly heritable and are influenced by the same gene alleles (what Professor Robert
Plomin calls “generalist genes for g”), this has been shown by numerous studies by experts
such as Ian Deary, J.C. DeFries, and others. A RACIST is someone who thinks that East Asians

tend to be better at math and tend to have higher IQs than Blacks because of innate genetic
differences rather than cultural differences.
Sprinting speed differences:
Blacks (especially West African Blacks) tend to be the fastest sprinters, next come Whites and
then come East Asians. A RACIST is someone who thinks that East Asians tend to be slower
sprinters than Blacks because of innate genetic differences rather than cultural differences.
Sexual dimorphism differences:
Black males tend to be more muscular and have larger penises than Whites who in turn tend
to be more muscular and have larger penises than East Asians (if you doubt this then just
spend some time on some free porn sites such as pornhub.com, within less than an hour of
research of comparing Japanese male porn stars with Black and White male porn stars you
will certainly agree). A RACIST is someone who thinks that East Asians tend to be less
muscular and have smaller penises than Blacks because of innate genetic differences rather
than cultural differences.
Who now would ever believe that differences in human traits such as math ability, intelligence,
sprinting ability, and body build and penis size would have anything to do with innate genetic
differences rather than cultural differences??? A RACIST, THAT IS WHO WOULD BE STUPID
ENOUGH TO BELIEVE SUCH RIDICULOUS NOTIONS!!!

Since I am no biologist, and this is a nontrivial issue (since biologists comes down on different
sides), I will go with the consensus.

@ Torbjorn Larsson,
There is no consensus. In fact it even depends where you ask the scientists. For example,
China and Poland IIRC are more likely to use race compared to the US.

Also, see Sesardic* who mentions the wordplay used which actually means the same thing
as race (there is an interesting example of AWF Edwards & Cavalli-Sforza).

While walking the light spectrum, I did have difficulty determining where orange and yellow
differentiated, but there was no question of the difference between the red and blue ends of
the continuum.

There are noticeable stereotypical distinctions of phenotypic characteristics of human
populations related to different population regions of the world. There’s a general consistency
of human phenotypic characteristics distinguishing particular regions/region from other
regions/region.
General descriptive phenotypic characterizations is what we’re talking about.
The differences are clear enough to ‘non-scientists’.

[...]Sarich and Mield then address Gould’s race-does-not-exist mantra: “The basic reason
Gould gives for his no-race position is this: ‘Homo sapiens is a young species, its division into
races even more recent. This historical context has not supplied enough time for the evolution
of substantial differences.’ (This from the man famous for his theory [with Niles Eldridge] of
punctuated equilibria.)” They then go on to explain why Gould is wrong.
They looked at differences between human races, between males and females, and
differences between primates—particularly chimpanzees and gorillas.
** What is astounding is that there is greater morphological distance between human races
than there are between the two chimpanzee species or between gorilla species/subspecies. **
That is, the differences between human Races are Real, they are Substantial, and they did not
take millions of years to diverge. Humans, rapidly occupying every available niche after
leaving Africa 50,000 years ago, has been under enormous pressure to adapt. To do this
meant selection for morphological, pharmacogenetic, behavioral, and cognitive traits. Not only
are there many human races, but there are at least as many races as there are ecological

niches, and only humans can create their own niches with forethought. What this means is
not only Are there human Races, but humans have evolved uniquely to alter there own
cultures or ecologies, further increasing unique selection pressures....
Sarich and Miele explain: “Molecular data suggest that the two chimpanzee lineages separated
around 1.5 million years ago; the comparable human figure is on the order of 15,000 years.
In other words, the two chimp lineages are 100-fold older, yet show the same amount of
variation. That is a remarkable result, the implications of which take a while to sink in. The
implications follow this logic: Human races are very strongly marked morphologically; human
races are very young; so much variation developing in so short a period of time implies,
indeed almost certainly requires, functionality; there is no good reason to think that behavior
should somehow be exempt from this pattern of functional variability. [.......]

One easy to measure ability that is vastly different in humans is the West African sprinting
speed. This is found in that 81/84 of the sub 10 second 100m have been by men of west
African origin.

Why Kenyans Make Such Great Runners: A Story of Genes and Cultures – Max Fisher – The
Atlantic
“...It turns out that Kenyans’ success may be Innate. Two separate, European-led studies in a
small region in western Kenya, which produces most of the race-winners, found that young
men there could, with only a few months training, reliably outperform some of the West’s best
professional runners.
In other words, they appeared to have a Physical advantage that is common to their
community, making it probably genetic.
The studies found significant differences in body mass index and bone structure between the
Western pros and the Kenyan amateurs who had bested them. The studied Kenyans had Less
mass for their height, Longer legs, Shorter torsos, and more Slender limbs. One of the
researchers described the Kenyan physical differences as “bird-like,” noting that these traits
would make them more efficient runners, especially over long distances.
Racial politics can make the genetics of African athleticism difficult to talk about in the West.
Surprisingly, Western popular writing about Kenyans’ running success seems to focus less on
these genetic distinctions and more on cultural differences. For years, the cultural argument
has been that Kenyans become great runners because they often run several miles to and
from school every day. But, about a decade ago, someone started asking actual Kenyans if
this was true, and it turned out to be a merely a product of Western imaginations:...”

There are human races in human perception, no doubt, just as there are dog breeds in human
perception. So I wonder if not really the concept of applying the new panacea, the genetic
yardstick, to each and every human question today is the folly? In the olden days it was
divination over bird’s entrails, now it’s genes. By now we know that epigenetics play an equal
if not greater role and we still have to figure out what about 98% of “non-expressive” gene
material is all about. The more I study this I wonder if this route of enquiry will not soon be
discredited as phrenology once became, and almost over night.
