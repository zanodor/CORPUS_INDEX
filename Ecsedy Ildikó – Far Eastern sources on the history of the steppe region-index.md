FAR EASTERN SOURCES ON THE HISTORY OF THE STEPPE REGION1
BY
Ildikó EGSEDY2
In 1973, when I participated in the XXIXth International Congress of Orientalists, Professor Demiéville afforded me a unique opportunity to meet him in a friendly and scholarly symposium - in the littéral sense, at the dinner table—, given by him with royal kindness and cordial informality. The introductory dialogue touched upon my double and connected interest both in the history of the steppe and in Chinese history, but he carefully avoided the usual jokes as to how a devotee of China's past civilization could be a friend of her enemies, namely those on and from the steppe. He listened but with an indulgent smile to the reverse of this joke about the obligation of a Hungarian relative of steppe peoples and cultures to see but their mirror in the Chinese sources, dealing writh their records of foreigners first and foremost, if not exclusively. He raised, however, the instructive question as to what extent my national background, that is, the Hungarian interest in steppe history, had motivated my sinological studies. After a preliminary answer on the spot and a reconsideration of the problem, I formulated the question for myself like this: which conclusions, methods and aspects of Chinese historiography, social or cultural history, etc., can be fruitful and could or should be exploited as a source or background of steppe history, even if the said conclusions do service to steppe history rather than to sinology proper? This attempt to answer, whereby I also confess some kind of a traditional Hungarian interest in the Orient as well, should symbolize my hommage and gratefulness to Professor Demiéville, the kind mentor of Hungarian Sinologists.

Modern historical studies cannot be devoid of complex approaches to past ages and their problems, if only because historical processes themselves transgress deliberately - according to objective necessities - the limits of traditional disciplines and their historical or cultural scope. So long, however, as disciplinary preconditions like education or organization of sciences in a country have delayed forming the due over-all view of an age, territory and so on, it seems useful to keep on putting those traditional questions which compel research to develop an up-to-date complexity of methods, sources, etc. Such a question is put for instance by the research of ethnogenesis, searching for the "roots" of nations, from the beginning of the formation of modern nations, at least in Eastern Europe. Naturally the question "from where?" (completed by questions like "how?",
"in what ways?" etc.) can be as complex or complicated as the examining approach or view develop it in space and time, but the answer is clearly interdisciplinary or at least pre-disciplinary, irrelevant of the partial competency of the separate actual disciplines relating to the distance to be covered. Fortunately enough, the route of an ethnic, or better to say, the historical process forming ethnic communities, cannot be stopped at the border of old or new political units, at their written sources as treated by traditional philology - if the people in question happened to be literate or was described by literate contemporaries-, at the material found under the earth by archaeology, at artistic representations analyzed by art history, or ar recent data collected from the offsprings and inheritors by anthropologists. An ethnic process -with its cultural or political motives and concomitants - ending in the Carpathian Basin, usually can and must be traced via the Eurasian steppe region, sometimes as far as its Far-Eastern background sphere, and through many types of their source legacy, as far as from China and Chinese source material for instance.
I. A Sinologist examines the Eurasian steppe-belt by necessity from a distance, because of China's Far-Eastern geographic situation as well as her historical distance: relative isolation and specific historical way. The related consequences in Chinese history and historiography can be explored from different angles and for different purposes.
I. 1 . Long-range geographic perspectives can open up new vistas of continent-wide or even intercontinental movement of peoples, cultural achievements, economic goods, etc., even if it is this far-and-wide, general aspect of events and processes that can best be studied from such a distance : e.g. the upper limits of historical times of the steppe region in question. Certain geographic preconditions of human history, if taken in this widest sense and scope, can play a determinative role in history and, in fortunate cases, in our historical view as well, through their own historical changes - through their own history -, although sometimes only in an indirect form. Here we can only regret that no manual of historical geography or archaeology marks the actual area of the steppe-belt at a particular time, say, at the time of the domestication of the horse, at the beginning of widespread use of iron weapons, etc. The structural framework of the Asian continent, however, considered

constant with good reason, can be reconsidered, for instance, in view of the history of languages traditionally called Altaic, especially with respect to the linguistic relationship of the Japanese islands. Indeed, East Asia ends in the East not necessarily on the shores of the inland seas of the Pacific Ocean. A few Altaists, especially in Japan, felt the continental territory to be so closely connected with Japan that they made this uncontrolled historical precondition responsible for the assumption of a genetic relation of the Japanese language with the so-called Altaic group of languages, although this genetic affinity itself has become problematic in the course of recent researches.3 The comparative studies of Altaic and Japanese imply by necessity - even if sometimes tacitly - a geographic unity of the Asian continent with its island neighbours, or at least such close proximity that the distance can be easily covered by ship. In this case mostly modern high-seas navigation is meant, and its implied possibilities to cover the distance concerned is transposed to an undefined past. From the shores of the East-Asian continent, however, the safest route followed the shore northwards to the north-eastern passage-way of islets to the Japanese islands, at least in prehistoric times, as attested by quite recent (and as yet unpublished) Soviet-American archaeological excavation as well as according to common opinion about the early peopling of the American continent. Japan's continental connections developed, however, via shorter sea routes, too, even at the dawn of the historical period; one of them is the Korean Peninsula - the Altaic relation of the territory and its language being another matter of dispute. Buddhist monks of the last centuries of the first millennium A.D.

"The relevance of historical linguistics for Japanese studies", Journal of Japanese Studies, II, 2

Question of the Genetic Relationship of Japanese] by Kamei Takeshi (Tokyo, 1973), and
Nihongo no gogen [The Etymology ofJapanese] by Murayama Shichiro (Tokyo, 1974) respectively,
the latter favouring a "mixed" Altaic and Malayo-Polynesian origin of Japanese: Journal of
Japanese Studies, I, 1 (1974), pp. 190-216. Or see R.A. Miller's opinion on the need of studying the Altaic elements and grammatical structures in the Japanese language, affirming that - in
spite of its Malayo-Polynesian heritage -"... there now appears to be little question that the
language is Altaic, in much the same way that English, Persian or Russian arc all Indo-European, and that it is also Tungusic, in the way that English, Dutch or Swedish are all Germanic";
recently, after a fellowship (1977) devoted to the related research appeared an article called
"The origin of the Japanese language" in the Japan Foundation Newsletter, VI, 6 (Feb.-Mar. 1979), pp. 6-12; it admits, on p. 9, that the oldest written records ofAltaic languages, Old Turkic, can
be dated as late as the beginning of the 8th century A.D., "the period of the bulk of the written
records for OldJapanese". See, however, at least another recent concept of the relationship of the so-called Altaic languages, attributing the very cause of their existence to their areal coexistence
in the course of history in A. Róna-Tas, "Historical linguistics, linguistic typology, linguistic relationship", Theoretical Problems of Typology and the Northern Eurasian Languages, ed. by L. Dezsó
and P. Hajdu, Akadémia Publishing House, Budapest, 1970, pp. 145-149; and the same author,
adapting the theory of isoglosses to the old Turkic languages in "Some problems of Ancient Turkic", Ada Orientalia, Havniae XXXII (1970), pp. 209-228. Our considerations concern the
possibility of this areal coexistence, as early as possible in history, of the Altaic speakers with the inhabitants of the Japanese islands, this being a precondition of any kind of linguistic affinities
between the languages in question, of genetic or areal, typological, etc. character as well.

were also compelled to use the sea currents, their ships being exposed to the streams and winds.4 These shores and inland seas seem -in contrast to the Mediterranean sphere for example - to have been too difficult for a regular and significant human communication, or at least the vehicles and knowledge of navigation could not connect safely the continental shores with the Eastern islands. Prior to international traffic to and from China in imperial times, from the Han period and the beginning of our era at least, mere coastal travel could have been rendered possible by the small ships or boats excavated so far.5 The earliest related written evidence of the Far East, the Chinese pictographs originating from the Shang-Yin age at least, represent only a small, canoetype rowboat chou6 il}- or a boat with one small, kerchief-like sail fan7 Щ,, attesting to no more than riverine navigation at the end of the second millennium B.C.
and prior to this time. Thus in prehistorical times -in East Asia ending with China's written records, that is, in the 17th century B.C.- Japan could have been approached from the continental shores on foot only, if the sea of those times made it possible at all. Indeed, the sea must have been much lower at one time, namely, before the end of the last glacial period.8 We may suppose a regular contact or even migrations of peoples before that period at best -a dozen thousand years ago-,

navigation in the Indian and Pacific Oceans", in The Countries and Peoples of the East, selected
articles ed. by D.A. Olderogge and Yu.V. Maretin, B.A. Valksaya, Moscow, 1974, pp. 45-91.
(5) Needham who - in his thorough and imposing history of the implements of Chinese
civilisation - even overestimates sometimes the sphere and significance of old Chinese achievements, does not seem to believe that the boat could be an autochtonous Chinese invention at all. He
supposes that its knowledge or the object itself arrived in China from another cultural sphere. Cf.
J. Needham, Science and Civilisation in China, Vol. 4, Part III "Civil Engineering and Nautics" (with the collaboration of Wang Ling), Cambridge, 1971, pp. 379-380 sq. The primitive
implements like the early Chinese boat, however, were discovered in different places of the world quite independently, and we have no reason to attribute its origin to borrowing, especially since a
drawing of it has been preserved in a datable form; see our next note. (6) In the forms of the Yin age ^ , JJ > $ > ax : B. Karlgren, Grammata Serica Recensa, BMFEA,

and afterwards the thaw of ice must have raised the level of the seas so much that this could have brought about a caesura, i.e. a shorter or longer gap in ethnic and cultural connections and processes. Therefore, research of historical times in Asia, of those times attested by datable and written sources, too, ought to consider the population of the Altai region but only from the post-glacial period, the approach to an earlier period being beyond the sphere and authority of the philological sources. The next problem to be raised is the beginning of this post-glacial period in the territory concerned, the proper scope, extent and significance of the last glacial period, the time and extent of the disappearance of ice in Inner and Eastern Asia. The answers are dependent on the development and actual results of different earth sciences, history of meteorology, paleo-archaeology and other sciences, some ofwhich should be induced to challenge theories formulated by disciplines of human history. The above considerations, beside trying to outline the lower limits of historical times in Asia, aim to contribute to research by formulating the appropriate questions from a joint Sinological and Altaistic view, inseparable in prehistoric times.
1.2. The geographical unity ofAsian territories may be represented in a still less divisible form by the picture of the sky above it, by the astronomical tradition of the peoples in a related belt. The "celestial archaeology", that is to say, the history of visible celestial phenomena can be compared with the early strata and archaic types of written or oral tradition. In this way, we can use the old astronomical knowledge, even in its mythological or folkloric forms, as a source of large dimensions of time and space, which may in fortunate cases extend beyond the limits of historical times as well. According to ancient Chinese tradition - from the I-ching, the Book of Changes, on -, the figures (phenomena) of the earth and those of the sky correspond to one another, at least in times of order in the society, and in cases of harmony in nature ; that may induce the reader of the old Chinese sources to search also for an old world view in the vulgar, even astrological tradition of the astronomical legacy. 9 In the sky of ancient China, it is the Polar region - that of the Northern celestial hemisphere - that was considered the most honourable celestial place, as seen in ancient Chinese records, because it could symbolize the stabilizing and well-balanced "Middle" - similar to the immobile central sphere of the
centralized celestial "empire" -, dominated by the (Northern) Polar Star. This "Middle"-minded aspect of the Chinese sky and, consequently, the Northern orientation seems so strong in the astronomic and astrologie tradition of historical China, that the well-known ritual direction of the South and its wide
(9) This method of the author of this paper, encouraged by Professor Demiéville in 1973, was
first outlined in a lecture at the XXIXth International Congress of Orientalists (Paris, 1973):

p. 61, and a shortened form of the paper in Actes du XXIXe Congrès international des Orientalistes, Paris, 1977, pp. 123-128. The possible correspondence between folkloric and written tradition
and a few related consequences were described in my paper "On a few traces of ancient Sino
Tibetan contacts in the early Chinese mythic tradition" in Bibliotheca Orientalis Hungarica, vol. XXIII (1978), pp. 89-99.

ranging cult can be but earlier than the honour of the Polar Star and its Northcentered "empire", with the "celestial officials" concerned (T'ien-kuan ;?ťif, according to the title of the astronomic chapter of Ssu-ma Ch'ien's Shih-chi), but this is another question. The reason why this central astronomic tradition can be used as a source - that of a chronological marker-point - in the history of East Asia, is the history of celestial figures and configurations of their own, offering an Archimedean point outside the written and philological tradition
of China and Sinology as well. Namely, the star Polaris has ruled over "celestial civilization" ofthe Northern hemisphere since a determinable time, not much earlier than the middle of the 2nd millennium B.C.10 Probably a certain time, perhaps a few centuries, must have been needed for the notice and observation of the new phenomenon, until it was accepted and used in an actual and symbolical sense. The mythic records also show that the "discovery" of the Polar Star could not be earlier than the end of the Shang-Yin age, toward the end of the 2nd millenium B.C. Incidentally, this type of strengthening of the related text of the Tso-chuan or other chronicles and commentaries may be useful or even surprising in view of the wellknown textual vicissitudes of ancient Chinese records, and with respect to modern textual criticism and hypercriticism as well.11

pp_ 42-53, esp. p. 46. See the Shang age usage of Ch'en Ш in the story of the two brothers hostile to each other, the stars of whom are those of Chin Ц and Shang РЙ respectively, while their
offspring are the people oiHsia Щ. and Shang respectively; the Star of Shang was Ch'en M, while that
oiChin (Hsia) was Shen g:, in the first year of Lu Chao-kung ШЩэ& (540 B.C.), in The Ch'un Ts'ew with the Tso Chuen by J. Legge, Hong Kong University Press reed., pp. 573, 580. Reference to the
same ancient story can be read in the 9th year of Lu Hsiang-kung Щ-Ш-& (563 B.C.), when, instead of Ch'en й or Shang-hsing ЙЖ, we find that the star honoured by Shang is Ta-huo yz'X,
"Great Fire"; cf. ibid., pp. 436-437, 439; p. 580, the star Ch'en is interpreted as Ta-huo; see also
the Star of Fire and Shang (identified generally with the Antares) and that oiChin (Shen, identified with a part of the Orion with a question-mark by J. Legge, p. 580) in S. Couvreur, Tch'ouen
Ts'ieou et Tso Tchouan, Paris, 1951, vol. HI, pp. 31-32 (Chao-kung's 1st year: "Antarès du
Scorpion" and "... partie d'Orion") and vol. II, pp. 236-237 (Hsiang-kung's 9th year). The star Ch'en is used in this ancient sense in the above mythic reference, while the similar text of the
Tso-chuan shows its other, so to speak modern usage, in the expressionjihyiieh hsing ch'en chih shen Д Я MEtZ-fl1, mentioning "the spirits of the sun, moon and stars" (interpreted in this way by
J. Legge, p. 580, and S. Couvreur, vol. Ill, p. 33), where the composition hsing-ch'en MS
represents different types of moving and immobile stars, i.e. all kinds ofstars. The two related stories of the Tso-chuan are referred to as memories of local stellar cults by B. Karlgren, Legends and cults
in ancient China, BMFEA, 18 (1946), pp. 243-244. There he mentions "constellations" only, but
we find in his Grammata Serica Recensa, No 647a-b: "Shen: name of a constellation, part of Orion,
the 'triad star'"; and No 455a-g, where Ch'en means, among other things, "heavenly body",
while in No 455h Ch'en is "part of the constellation Scorpio" and "morning", with the key of "sun", showing, in my opinion, the hours of the day when its appearance was observed at the
time of sunrise. This type of rising star could be a sign of the beginning of a season, e.g. that of

The actual date, however, of the appearance of our Polar Star in the Pole of the sky may serve as an objective demarcation line between astronomical traditions with and without Polar Star. In this way, we can separate Far Eastern historical tradition about the heaven with an Immobile Middle as preserved in the Chinese scholarly world - and in its cultural or political area, like in Japan - from a mythic and/or ritual South-oriented tradition in China, with an obscure and obsolete cult of the Southern celestial region, with a Star of Fire Huo-hsing 'ХШ. in its center, called the Star of Shang Shang-hsing ЙЖ as well. This latter star, the Antares and its neighbourhood in the constellation Scorpio., can be traced in a mythic, archaic strata of the Chinese literature as well as in the folklore tradition of East and South-East Asia; a part of them survives in records or even in folk tradition.12 Thus we may suppose a possibility of survival of a stellar cult or primitive astronomic tradition prior to the age of Polaris, too, originating even as early as from the time when the Antares could have been the most significant date in a year of cultivators, as shown for instance by the Chinese pictographic sign of "agriculture", nung Л, marked with the Scorpio cWevP" Ш or by its most brilliant, red star ("Great Fire"), named Antares in the West. The latter according to the related Chinese characters - seems to have been connected with morning,14 the whole constellation referring to springtime or to the beginning of the year (the agricultural year) in the folkloric and ritual tradition.15 The reason why one should hesitate to call the period concerned more than "pre-Polaris" is that the time when the Antares marked the vernal equinox
springtime, as it used to be in other ancient agricultural civilizations as well. See also note (13) below. A detailed analysis of the mentioned textual and astronomic tradition of ancient China
and the Far Eastwill be realized in my work On the Beginnings ofthe Ancient Chinese State (in
preparation).
(12) Which also preserve old Shang and Chou geographic consciousness: cf. my paper "On a
few traces of ancient Sino-Tibetan contacts..."
(13) The Yin variants of the character nung ft, "agriculture, farmer"(Grammata Serica Recensa No 1005a-f) show a kind of vegetation (ibid. No 1005c-d) and field (ibid. No 1005e-f) respectively,
while their lower part is ch'en Ш; no comment by B. Karlgren or other authority gives any
explanation. The part ch'en could have some relation with "vegetation" or "field" -due to the
meaning of the character, even if standing for a phonetic marker, but here it has no function like that. As
to the cult of Antares (Scorpio), "conquered" - adopted - by Shang, it can be supposed with reason that Antares represents an important date for agriculture, say, the beginning of field work
and vegetation in springtime, as this would not be unparalleled in the case of a stellar cult in ancient societies. The supposition that nung §k could mean the beginning of a cultivator's
obligations can be strengthened by another Chinese character from the time of the Star of Shang: ju Щ,
"disgrace", "(disgrace oneself = ) condescend" (B. Karlgren, op. cit. No 1223a, without
comment), containing ch'en Щ without a phonetic function again. "Infringing (the time and/or
obligation marked by the) ch'en", implied by the graphic composition of the character, used to be a
denotation of ritual "shame" - crime, revolt, etc. - in ancient Chinese texts, naturally without a
direct stellar reference in the time ofthe "royal calendar" ofastronomical character ofthe
historical times. Nine stars of the Scorpio have some kind of rule in the Na-khi cult of New Year, too; cf. my paper "On a few traces ..."; a few other traces of primitive time-markers like that of nung
and ju have also been found, however, by the author of these lines, to be treated in the above work in preparation.

must have been about 16000 B.C., according to the same precession calculations as in the case of the appearance of the Polaris as a Polar Star. This far prehistoric past, although not at all unreal for a primitive cultivator's tradition, as shown by new archaeological results in East Asia and elsewhere, requires still further studies - peaceful times, subsidies and energies for archaeological excavations before becoming a subject of historical research in a proper sense, harmonizing revelations of archaeology with mythic records and folklore tradition of the territory concerned, or with the testimony of the Chinese pictographs as sources of cultural history. This wide range of considerations has also been intended to serve as a negative witness, as an argument of ante quern non or post quern non character, for the chronology of Asian history beyond the Great Wall, namely for the astronomical tradition of Uralic and Altaic groups of people — whether or not rightly so called - whose prehistoric connection with China's past culture is often supposed without any possibility, or even any intent, of verification. As regards the
above-mentioned stellar tradition in East Asia, from this point of view Inner Asia and Siberia - with their East European sphere of influence - can be
characterized first by a lack of the tradition concerning the Antares (and Scorpio), as far as seen from their linguistic, artistic and archaeological legacy. The problem of the position, I mean the visibility of the Antares, does not need to be raised at this point, since it is not a suitable celestial point of orientation in the Northern territories of early historical China either, but rather to the South of it ; we might therefore consider it an autochtonous stellar tradition of East Asia, far from the northern routes of Western Asian, say, Mesopotamian cultural elements. The related tradition still survived, and it could have been borrowed - if so - in case of an early Chinese influence.
The so-called Altaic languages, as their Turkic group, however, reflect an astronomic tradition with the Polar Star in the centre of the celestial system, and the tradition itself- whether or not influenced by China - cannot be earlier than the appearance of the Polaris in the pivot of the sky:16 it may be about three thousand years old, or a few centuries older, at most. On the other hand, the vocabulary of the Uralic languages, as far as can be judged under present research conditions, seems more conservative, or at least does not show an automatic development corresponding either to the change of nature in their sphere or to the phenomena appearing in the language and culture of their neighbours, the Turkic peoples. Certain Uralic languages, for instance, like several FinnoUgric languages, have no means at all to designate the Polar Star, although
they have names for several stars and separate constellations in the Polar
region.17
(16) On the old Turkic star names (with bibliographical references), see J.Németh, "Ùber altturkische Sternnamen" in Ada Linguistica Ac. Sc. Hung., 18, 1-2 (1968), pp. 1-6; Sir G. Clauson, An Etymological Dictionary of Pre-Thirteenth-Century Turkish, Oxford, 1972, pp. 922-923:

On the History of the Steppe Region 271
Consequently, in the Asian steppe region and the neighbouring territories of which the historical period is post-glacial, as explained above - the astronomic tradition of Uralic (Finno-Ugric) peoples is prior to the celestial rule of the Polar Star, originating probably from a period prior to that of Turkic stellar tradition. The whole territory seems to have been untouched by the Chinese (East-Asian) astronomical tradition of Antares, and the tradition preceding that of Chinese influence - if at all - can be supposed at most in the time of the present Polar Star and in the Altaic region at best ; but it is to be pointed out and proved in any case and in every actual context of historical or pre-historical times. This long argumentation cannot be avoided, if only for the reason that mankind always tried to reach every place where a road could be found, e.g. to draw it on the map. However, it is reasonable to mark those by-ways which proved or may prove to be blind alleys. Indeed, recently, new archaeological expeditions obtained sensational results in Siberia and the neighbouring Central Asian regions, among others drawing on stones, considered several thousand or even more than ten thousand years old. Not less than twenty five thousand years are also mentioned in their preliminary descriptions, by this period prolonging historical times in the territory concerned. The old pictographs are treated as a source of numerical or celestial sings, by this tacitly supposing the usage of numerical calculations of the calendar or of the movements of celestial phenomena in such an early age. Even a few laws of movements of the sun and moon are recognized in primitive signs or obscure artistic representations of pictographs, at the same time referring to a Chinese tradition for their explanation, without respect for the history of Chinese tradition itself, and without considering the history of the natural phenomena reflected by them.18 That is why perhaps it is not useless to repeat that the oldest historical times are but post-glacial (and prior to the Polar Star) in the sphere concerned, and the period preceding them ought to be considered prehistoric as regards their languages, notions, knowledge and forms of consciousness as well, their continuity and connection with historical times being necessary to examine and prove (a primitive knowledge of the movements of the sun and moon could even be forgotten and discovered again, until it became stabilized in a civilized or even

drov and A. P. Okladnikov, pp. 236-237). Chinese pottery of neolithic times was studied, with
astronomic interpretations as concerns the graphic decoration on certain pieces, by T.I. Kashina,

Primitive Art], Novosibirsk, 1978, pp. 183-202, where every line is explained as a celestial symbol

in a written form) . Finally, prehistorical pictographs, from a period prior to the Polar Star, even if they happen to represent the sun and moon and their celestial ways, cannot be automatically connected with Chinese written sources, originating at best from the first millennium B.C. For the sake of accuracy, it is to be noted, although it may be of significance in the history of Chinese tradition only, that Polar Star always means here Stella Polaris. Indeed, among the celestial signs of ancient China, another Polar Star of the Northern hemisphere also held a special position and a related cult, namely the Vega (in the constellation of Lyra), "ruling" about 12000 B.C. (for at least two thousand years long), that became the star (and constellation) of the Celestial Weaving Maiden. The polar position of the Vega, however, in prehistoric times as concerns Asian history, could not be easily connected with the Chinese stellar cult of the Vega in imperial times around the beginning of our era, at least not without due considerations and arguments.
I. 3. Due to the same wide geographical connections and prospects, the historical sources of East Asia may be explored with respect to the Eurasian steppe region also when a gap occurs in a wide range of events or concatenation of tradition, at least within the direct sources at hand. The difficulty of a survey of prehistoric distance is due, first of all, to the scarcity of the sources proper, and complex approaches should also use history of nature and results of other disciplines as new sources; in historical times, however, a new difficulty is provided by the appearance of direct sources, by their growing number as well as by their divergent and multi-layer or mixed character. The complexity of approaches is required by the complexity of source material, too, both in its written and pictographic or other forms, and by the different languages and divergent cultures serving as bases for separate and separable disciplines.
II. 1. The disciplinary division of historical studies also means a scholarly discipline, manifested in an intentional and scrupulous limitation of the research, remaining within the traditional scope and competence of Sinology or Altaic studies etc., even in cases of intercontinental or otherwise interdisciplinary character. In Hungary it was the Marxian concept of history, the claim to a world-wide historical view - with its concept of the future centred on human progress in the past and present as well - that required and brought about a
reunity of different and separate disciplines, or at least led to a conscious effort of that kind. That is how - in my view - Sinological studies and Chinese sources could give new prospects not only to Altaic or other studies of nomadic peoples, but contributions to the historical background of East European cultural or
ethnic history as well, including certain problems of Hungarian prehistory and
ethnogenesis.19
(19) See my efforts in this connection in the papers "The Asian background of Chinese
civilisation" and "On the economic and social structure of nomadic societies" in the volume Primitive Society and the Asiatic Mode ofProduction, Budapest, 1976 (in Hungarian; an English edition is
in preparation).



On the History of the Steppe Region 273
II. 2. As an illustration, let me refer to the traditional research in Hungary on the so-called Hun legends of the early Hungarian chronicles as a topic urgently needing new views of interdisciplinary studies to advance from its present negative standpoint. For example, after long centuries of legendary tradition in Hungary about Attila and his Huns as ancestors of the Hungarians and their early rulers, modern historical research did its best to discredit this tradition of the Hungarian chronicles, attributing it to scholars of the royal courts, therefore considering it a borrowing from Western European chronicles, and consequently considering its variations in Hungarian folklore a mere derived or even manipulated circle of tales. Disregarding now the nationalist "Hunnist" trends in the last century and especially between the two world wars, the well-intentioned efforts of the scholars, no matter how respectable the results, were unable to explain certain facts and aspects concerned. First, the barbarian monster named Attila, with his bloodthirsty warriors of Western European sagas, were unknown in Hungary where the ruler of the Huns was represented as a heroic ancestor, his army described as saving poor people, etc. ; and secondly, a multitude of folkloric pieces, hardly derivable from high literary sources, contain similar stories.20
A solution could be offered by another view of the problem, namely in developing experiences in a much more complex sphere of sources, like in the Oriental and Orientalist field. Historical sources preserve there only a part of social memory, and their folkloric completion should be considered as valuable as the written records themselves, especially in places, and ages or peoples, etc., without script; and written sources contain scholarly historical texts as well as memories of oral tradition, sometimes without a possibility of separating them. First and foremost, mythic tradition can hide there—and in my view, not only there—elements of real history, often in a poetically condensed form. Therefore, the age of written history cannot exclude a folkloric tradition of myths either, parallel to official records (even if they may influence one another), in Hungary, too ; and that mythic tradition can preserve memories born outside the sphere of letters. That is how one can trace the tradition about Attila's burial with luxury and blood (three coffins of iron, silver and gold respectively, with many subjects "servants" -put to death and buried in the same tomb, etc.), suspecting it to be part of a wider sphere of death rituals of royal personnages in the past from the Scythian rulers onwards - buried with their serfs and treasures - up to the Great Wall built by the First Emperor of China Ch'in Shih Huang-ti, whose famous tomb with his warrior-servants (their sculptures) is being excavated nowadays. This search and research was oriented by the conviction that there existed a continent-wide connection in the steppic sphere, at least among its nomadic
(20) On this subject, a longer paper will be published by me in the Ada Orient. Hung. ; a few of
its methodological conclusions are summarized below. It is based on a lecture given at the
symposium "Myth and history" (Budapest, 1978) ; see its summary: "The eastern background of the
Hungarian tradition about Attila's tomb" in the volume Myth and History, appendix to Elômun

3, Budapest, 1979, pp. 16-17.

inhabitants and conquerors, mediating different cultures, borrowing and exchanging goods and beliefs, etc. Within a Eurasian cultural historical view like this, the burial traditions connected with Attila in Western (and Hungarian) chronicles and in Hungarian folklore cannot be considered a mere fiction separately developing under literary influences among illiterate people, etc. Upon research it turns out that the kingly burials in question belonged to a widespread tradition on the steppe from prehistoric times, its folkloric details being attached to a famous rulers' person, to Ch'in Shih Huang-ti in the East or to Attila in the West; and the records in the chronicles -in Hungary and elsewhere could have included or reflected this only partially or in a distorted form; naturally this interdisciplinary topic, too, should be cleared up according to the rules and requirements of the related disciplines . . .
III. 1 . Besides intercontinental or global and thus common factors of nature, or common geographical perspectives mentioned above (I), and cultural or folkloric connections with manifold source tradition (II), the Far Eastern sources can render a third service to historical studies outside East Asia. Namely, in historical times, they may describe or reflect specific historical processes, connected with other peoples and cultures or independently, offering a model of their own for comparison, analogies or contrasts. The retardation of O riental technical and social history — even in the midst of brilliant civilizing achievements, limited however to a monopolistic strata or social group - may facilitate perception of archaistic phenomena and their tradition in the relatively conservative written or folkloric sources in the East. The continuity of the above-mentioned royal burials, for instance, is easier to detect from Eastern territories - up to the pre-historic times of the Shang or pre-Shang era in Chinese source references, or as far down as the 20th century folk beliefs in South China - , because human sacrifices (or their tradition at least) survived there through the old practice of killing the enemy and prisoner, as done in the Shang China or even later, for the reason that they could not be used and fed within the too small and closed communities of the conquerors (while the prisoners of wars could be used in work as slaves, or could be simply sold as such at any time in the Mediterranean sphere, until the development of more humanistic values of human work and life). It may be considered characteristic in any case that recently only Far-Eastern archaeological excavations, in China, Korea and Japan, should have drawn attention to royal tombs and the archaic tradition in question, including the attention of the author of this paper.
1 1 1 . 2 . A better known historical lesson is offered to the research of the steppe by the Far-Eastern and, in particuliar, the Chinese sources, after the beginning of historical times both in China and in the steppe region: after regular scholarly historiography, beginning in the imperial courts of China, and in the time of the great steppe empires of stock-breeder nomads with mounted armies. The two related preconditions appearing almost simultaneoulsy, the information of Chinese historical sources proper is especially valuable concerning the steppe region from the time of the Hiung-nu on.



On the History of the Steppe Region 275
III. 3. The Chinese records can be explored with regard to changes of political framework, tribal disorders or ethnic processes, both as regards their direct information and indirect records to be noted e.g. by related chronological considerations. Taking the problem of the appearance and rule of Avarsin the Carpathian Basin, we should pay attention to their starting point or sphere in the East Asian steppes, although China and Chinese records show direct contacts in the time concerned (the middle of the 6th century) with the conquering Turks rather than with the escaping Avars (their Eastern tribes, relatives and allies in the Juan-juan empire). The standard Chinese historical sources deal first and foremost with the victorious Turks (551 A.D.), and those Juan-juan who still occur in Chinese records — last time in 554 - are but surrendering, weak groups,
disappearing (being assimilated) soon. Such indirect information, however, may be of cardinal importance in chronological matters, in comparative social history, contrasted with other groups oftheir own, with other Barbarians, etc.21
III. 4. The Chinese records could and should be used, among other things, in linguistic or ethnic identification (comparison or distinction), for clearing up exact dates of certain events, etc. For example, a high rank and title of the Avar tribes - when conquering the Carpathian Basin at the beginning of the second half of the 6th century - is tudun, often considered to be of Chinese origin.22 Before trying, however, to sum up the related consequences - about Chinese-Avar contacts and so on -, it is useful to know that the Chinese title which tudun is thought derived from, tu-ťung Щ>Ш, is not earlier than the middle of the 8th century A.D.,23 and thus it is out of the question as an ancestor of such an early Avar title.
III. 5. Discrepancies in China and elsewhere, as reflected in the records, may also serve as information. Not only differences in social history, mentioned above, but also discrepancies of time occur within the Oriental sphere, e.g. between calendrical calculations and records of two Asian cultures, reflecting other divergencies, too. For example, in an epitaph, preserved in parallel Middle-Persian and Chinese text respectively, on the same stone of a Persian lady's tomb from 874 in the vicinity of Ch'ang-an, the date of the lady's death is given in such an exact way that even the double-hour of the day concerned is indicated, and still we find three days of discrepancy between the dates given by the Chinese and Persian texts respectively, due - as we know — to their different system of measuring and calculating time and its units.24 r

(23) Tu-t'ung, being the second part of a title in the 3rd century A.D., was re-introduced in
759, and it was a military rank in China only from this time on; consequently, the earlier title of similar phonetic form on the steppe could not be of Chinese origin. The earliest borrowing by
steppe peoples of the Chinese title tu-t'ung is perhaps that by the Uigurs in the 10th century. Cf.

III. 6. Besides discrepancies of both actual and historical times in China and other Asian countries or in the steppe, differences of phases of development in the society of the historiographers from the described territory or people may also explain important peculiarities for the readers of Chinese sources. For example, when we read in Chinese records that the Turks have no script, we cannot exclude some kind of writing among them, such as a script of "runic" and some foreign script used in their empire - both being mentionned in the same Chinese standard histories — , and the negative statement signifies a mere negation of a systematically elaborated script among the Turks, i.e. that known by the Chinese historian as a script proper, his own Chinese writing. A Chinese record to the effect that the Turks do not know how to reckon time, means only that the
Chinese scholars did not find among them a centrally elaborated and officially diffused calendar based on astronomic calculations - as in China - , although
they duly record the actual dating method and data that show a certain type of time-reckoning (according to springs, months, etc.) in the "country" of the Turks. Finally, when finding the sentence in a Chinese source saying that the Turks do not know law and order, morals and ceremonies, then we should understand that the Chinese clerks must have missed the ceremonial hierarchy and patriarchal morals of the Chinese empire on the steppe, since the summary Chinese chapters on the Turks contain lists of Turkish official titles as well as the criminal offenses with their corresponding punishments. When interpreting these records, the reader must know the world of the Chinese historian as well as that of the steppe recorded by them ; and this type of analysis may result in contributions to historical research on both sides, in a view reaching from the Chinese borderlands as far as the other end of the steppe region, where nomadic horsemen organized their new homes as states, for instance, in Hungary.25 This is apart, however, from the starting point of our discussion, that is how unified efforts of separate disciplines or complex approaches to the coherent historical processes of the steppe region may find the proper information in the Far Eastern sources, for answering not only the question "from where?", but also the timely questions ("to where?" and "how?"), according to the hope of the author of these lines, and in the spirit of Professor Demiéville to whom they are dedicated.
