The Influence of Tuning and
In terval on Condcioudnedd
Music, above all other arts, has always been
esteemed for its power to speak directly to our
higher consciousness. Based on unchanging laws
o f num ber and proportion, music also embodies
the fundamental metaphysical principles under
lying everyday reality. How do these two aspects
o f musics power, it’s twin roots in consciousness
and mathematics, relate to one another? And
why does each o f the worlds music systems seem
to have its own unique effects on consciousness?
Music and the Power o fSound is a new and
thoroughly revised edition o f Alain Danielou’s
pioneering Introduction to the Study o fMusical
Scales, an im portant book that for many years
has been virtually unobtainable in the West. In
these pages, Danielou traces the development
o f musical scales from their origins in both
China and India, through the merging in an
cient Greece o f those two systems, and on to
the development of the Western musical tradi
tions o f modal and polyphonic music.
Because musical pitches have specific frequen
cies, their relationships can be expressed numeri
cally as ratios o f greater or lesser complexity:
the simpler the ratio, the more euphonious the
harmony. The musicians o f antiquity understood
scales to be either cycles o f simple intervals
(China), arrays o f varying intervals around a
central pitch (India), or a combination of the
two (Greece). Any one of these methods of
construction resulted in a multitude ofcontrasting



scales, each capable of expressing distinct emo tional and spiritual states. Those scales, Danielou argues, not only reflected but also influenced the spiritual values of their parent civilizations. In the purity ofsimple harmonic ratios can be found the secrets of music’s affective power. These potent harmonic relationships offer a way for today’s musicians to transcend the limitations of our overly rationalistic musical system and fashion a synthesis with the metaphysical roots of the most eternal of arts.
A la in D a n ie lo u (1907-1994), the founderof the International Institute of Comparative Musicology in Berlin, elucidated for tens of thousands of readers the meanings of the arts and religious traditions of both East and West. He was an accomplished player of the vina and taught in the music department at the Univer sity of Benares. His numerous books, the prod uct of a career spanning six decades, include:
The Myths and Gods ofIndia; Gods ofLove and

The musicological work of Alain Danielou must be seen in a particular light since he happens to be by nature a musician. This is by no means common. How many musicologists, even the most famous, are not musicians! How many, indeed, are antimusical to the point of embodying the very negation of what constitutes a musician! This is why I was wondering how Danielou could be a musicologist, since he is a philosopher, a gifted linguist, a writer, a delightful painter, a composer, and an artist. This last quality is so obvious in him that it includes all the others. The sum of so many distinguished achievements reflects nothing more nor less than an equal sum of hard work. Though it might seem irrelevant, I should like to compare the construc tion of an inner being, worked out with patience, method, and application during a long and generous life, to the cross-seption of an architectural design, which perhaps reveals a difficulty solved through an ingenious device. Even if such a solution appears an inspiration or a gift of grace, it remains linked to a constant life of study. All this being said, there is nothing surprising in the fact that Danielou’s approach should be completely his own, following completely unconventional lines—lines that are new and unexplored, and that may appear inaccessible or even hostile. There is no question of shortcuts nor of the rediscovery of ancient roads long abandoned. Danielou’s inquiry is typically scientific. It cannot be seen as a continuation of previous work. It is strictly current and completely modern, and in many cases its conclusions appear definitive. They are presented here in one short work of a moral value worthy of Leopardi, covering a field that would normally require several inflated volumes from Doctors of Music, in which they would develop the most boring theories.



Danielou attacks the immobility of the West from the perspective of the Far East. From there, it is paradoxically the West that appears to be a static and contemplative world, one that has been asleep for millenia. The substance of his theories rests on an experience, deeper than one might imagine, of the essence of music as it is found in the East. He confronts us with an irrefutable critique of the many artificial deformations of music’s original language, showing how the fact of consonance as understood in the ancient world, and as it has been kept alive in Indian music, reveals unexplored possibilities. Composers of our time would do well to explore the intricate but transpar ent routes of the labyrinth of sounds, and study attentively the inner implica tions of this important book. In the second chapter, Danielou’s reflections on timbre and the choice of particular instruments are especially valuable; he seems to be the only one to underline the fundamental distinction between musical sounds and sounds that in fact are not musical. This crucial parameter has obvious implications in most aspects of present-day music. We read how harmonics are usually but not al ways multiples of the fundamental frequency. Instruments such as the violin or accordion produce, together with each note, a large number of harmonics, often louder than the note itself; other instruments such as the flute or the isolated string of a piano possess relatively few audible harmonics. Each sound forms with its own harmonics a complex chord possessing in itself a precise meaning. One often hears stupidities from people incapable of observation; it is with relief that one reads these considerations of luminous clarity about facts we tend to ignore but which represent a sacred and attractive threshold. This is the first marble step of an ascent toward the revelation of a higher world; a magic carpet near which we take off our shoes, ready to enter the sidereal space of liberated sound. Sylvano Bussotti Rome, January 1989



{D IT O M NOTE
M usic and the P ow er o f Sound was first published under the title Introduction to the Study o f M usical Scales in London in 1943. T he author’s own French translation was published in France in 1959 under the title Traite de m usicologie com paree and has recently been reprinted. Despite the publication in India in 1969 of an unauthorized facsimile of the original edition, however, the book has been vir tually unobtainable in English in the West since the 1943 edition went out of print. On a trip to India in 1987,1discovered the Indian edition of the book and devoured it at one sitting on a train journey from Delhi to Bombay. Here, it seemed to me, was someone who was answering with clarity and precision many of the questions that had been preoccupying me concerning the nature of music and its power to evoke in us feelings and images. It was an approach both universal and specific, one that made sense of the cultural differences between musical forms as well as the underlying threads that link them all. Through the International Institute for Comparative Musicology in Ber lin, of which Alain Danielou was the founder, I contacted him at his home in Italy. He was delighted when I proposed republishing this valuable work and making it once again readily available in English. This edition has been fully revised and rendered into more modern En glish, with the approval and cooperation of the author. It was perhaps part of the charm of the original edition that it was written in English by a Frenchman living in India, but I felt that the language could be modernized without loss and that the resultant improvement in clarity would be worth the effort. M y under standing of musical structures and my ability to sing in tune have both improved in the process. Daniel Rivers-Moore August 1994

All music is based on the relations between sounds, and a careful study of the numbers by which these relations are ruled brings us immediately into the almost forgotten science of numerical symbolism. Numbers correspond to ab stract principles, and their application to physical reality follows absolute and inescapable laws. In musical experience we are brought into direct contact with these principles; the connection between physical reality and metaphysical prin ciples can be felt in music as nowhere else. Music was therefore justly consid ered by the ancients as the key to all sciences and arts—the link between metaphysics and physics through which the universal laws and their multiple applications could be understood. Modern civilization has tended to reject the ways of thinking and scientific conceptions that formed its foundations. Western people have largely broken away from the social and intellectual regulations that restricted their freedom, and in doing so they have abandoned the age-old order and traditional knowl edge that had been the basis of their development. This is why sciences and arts originally understood as diverse applications of common principles have been reduced to a condition of fragmentary experiments isolated from one another. Thus, to take the domain with which we are here particularly concerned, there remain no data in the West on the nature of music except for a few technical and mostly arbitrary rules about the relations of sounds and the struc tures of chords. The strange phenomenon by which coordinated sounds have the power to evoke feelings or images is accepted simply as a fact. Attempts are made to define the effects of certain combinations of sounds, but these effects are discovered almost fortuitously and no search is made for their underlying cause. Just as one day Newton discovered the law of gravitation, it is only through the genius of some musician that we may be able to rediscover the significance of a particular relation of sounds; it is Gluck or Chopin who may



suddenly reveal to us the deep, absolute, and inevitable meaning of a chord or of a melodic interval. Unfortunately, such fragmentary experiments do not allow us to recon struct the general laws that would give us the key to all foreseen and unforeseen combinations, and these experimental discoveries remain without any logical connection. The idea that all sciences are ultimately experimental is so dear to West erners that they do not even notice that all the elements of their musical system are symbolic—as are almost all their ways of measuring time and space as welland that if those elements appear to us as natural, it is only because of the correspondence between the symbols and the perceptible world. W e find in supposedly scientific writings the poetic story of the primitive human who, having cut a bamboo stalk and blown through it, discovers the diatonic scale as defined by Zarlino, which is supposed to be the “natural scale.” Such myths simply show their authors’ complete'ignorance of the thousands of scales that are possible, expressive, pleasant to the ear, and perfectly natural and legitimate. Besides, the real problem is not to know how human beings may have acquired the knowledge of musical intervals, which always brings us back to a question of myth, ancient or modern, but to find out the real nature of the phenomenon by which some sounds can be combined to represent ideas, im ages, or feelings. This we obviously cannot discover by experiment nor decide by vote. So we shall have to draw upon the data of traditional metaphysics; though it may take many forms at different times and in different places, meta physics always presents the same logical and coherent structure, of which we shall presently try to give an outline. “All things,” Dante once wrote, “are arranged in a certain order, and this order constitutes the form by which the universe resembles God.”1 If sounds can evoke in us emotions, beings, or landscapes, it is because there are corre spondences between different aspects of the manifested world that the laws of music allow us to bring out. In the Li j i (Book of Rites), edited by Confucius, we read that “music is intimately connected with the essential relations between beings”; and, accord ing to Dong Zhongzu (second century b.c.e.):
The vital spirits of humankind, tuned to the tone of heaven and earth, express all the tremors of heaven and earth, just as several cithars, all tuned on gong [tonic], all vibrate when the note gong sounds. The fact of har mony between heaven and earth and humankind does not come from a physical union, from a direct action; it comes from a tuning on the same note producing vibrations in unison. . . . In the universe nothing happens by chance, there is no spontaneity; all is influence and harmony, accord answering accord.2



To be able to realize the nature of this accord between the different aspects of the universe, we must know the principles that are common to all these aspects. This is why theorists of Indian music assert that although subtle corre spondences can be experimentally discovered between the laws of nature and the laws of harmony, between the modes of music and the modes of our feel ings, they can be completely and logically explained only by traditional meta physics, whose source is in the Vedas. As Rene Guenon explains:
The affirmation of the perpetuity of the Vedas is directly connected with the cosmological theory of the primordial nature of sound among sensible qualities (sound being the particular quality of ether, akasa, which is the first element). And this theory is in reality nothing other than that which is expressed in other traditions when ‘creation by the Word’ is spoken of. The primordial sound is the divine Word, through which, according to the first chapter of the Hebrew Genesis, all things were made. This is why it is said that the Risbis or sages of the first ages ‘heard’ the Vedas. Revela tion, being a work of the Word like creation itself, is actually a hearing for those who receive it.J
According to Ksemaraja:
The b'tndu, wanting to manifest the thought it has of all things, vibrates, and is transformed into a [primordial] sound with the nature of a cry [:ndda]. It shouts out the universe, which is not distinct from itself; that is to say, it thinks it—hence the word sabda [word]. Meditation is the su preme ‘word’: it sounds, that is, it vibrates, submitting all things to the fragmentation of life; this is why it is ndda [vibration]. . . . Sound [sabda], which is of the nature of ndda, resides in all living beings.4
Swami Hariharanand Saraswati explained the fundamental interdependence of sounds and forms as follows:
The things named and their names are parallel manifestations resulting from the union of Brahman [undifferentiated principle] and Maya [appear ances] just as waves appear in the sea. From Brahman united with Sakti [Energy =Maya] issue, in the order of manifestation of the world, on the one hand- the principle o f naming, from it the monosyllable Om, and from Om all words [or sounds], and on the other hand, the principle o fforms and out of it all the world, living beings, etc. But between those two aspects of manifestation, the relation remains close; there is fundamental identity between the principle of names and the principle of forms, as well as between words and objects.5
The universe is called in Sanskrit/aga* (that which moves) because nothing exists but by the combination of forces and movements. But every movement



generates a vibration and therefore a sound that is peculiar to it. Such a sound, of course, may not be audible to our rudimentary ears, but it does exist as pure sound. Since each element of matter produces a sound, the relation of elements can be expressed by a relation of sounds. W e can therefore understand why astrology, alchemy, geometry, and so forth express themselves in terms of har monic relations. Although those pure, absolute sounds that Kabir calls “inaudible music” cannot be perceived by our ears (they may be perceptible for more delicate instruments, and the perception of such sounds is one of the stages in the prac tice of yoga), we may nonetheless be able to produce corresponding sounds within the range of vibrations we can perceive. We can establish relations be tween these partial sounds similar to the subtle relations of nature. They will be only gross relations, but they may approach the subtle relations of nature suf ficiently to evoke images in our mind. Sir John Woodroffe, the learned com mentator on tantric metaphysics, explains it thus: “There are, it is said, closely approximate natural names, combined according to natural laws of harmony [cbandabs], forming m antras which are irresistibly connected with their esoteric arthas [forms].”'1 If we were able to reproduce the exact relations that constitute the natural names, we should recreate beings, things, and phenomena, because this is the very process of creation, explained by the Vedas and also indicated in Genesis, or in the Gospel of John when the “creative Word” is spoken of. If, however, exact relations cannot be produced, approximate relations have a power, if not of creation, at least of evocation; sound “works now in man’s small magic, just as it first worked in the grand magical display of the World Creator.”7 “The natural name of anything is the sound which is produced by the action of the moving forces which constitute it. He therefore, it is said, who mentally or vocally utters with creative force the natural name of anything brings into being the thing which bears that name.”8By the artificial construction of harmony we can go beyond the phenomenon of sound vibrations and perceive not sounds but immaterial relations through which can be expressed realities of a spiritual nature. W e can thus lift the veil by which matter hides from us all true realities. By “the mutual aiding and inhibiting of the sounds in the Chhantlas'’ col location . . . the cumulative effect of the repetition of sounds and strings of sounds also may produce the aforesaid result.”10The effect produced by a group of sounds is practically the same whether their collocation is simultaneous (chords) or successive (modes), the numerical relation being identical in the two cases. Evocation through sound, like creation itself, takes place not because of the material fact of physical vibration but on account of the existence of meta physical correspondences. Therefore all psychological explanation of musical experience has to be discarded. In reality, the personality of the hearer counts



for nothing in the phenomenon of musical evocation because evocation takes place even if there is no hearer, and if the existence of this evocation is ephem eral it is only because of the imperfection of the relation of sounds. Hearers can be differentiated negatively only by the relative acuteness of their perceptions, their greater or lesser deafness. “Several centuries before Plato, Pythagoras, imbued with Egyptian doc trine, requested his disciples to reject the judgment of their ears as susceptible to error and variation where harmonic principles are concerned. He wanted them to regulate those immovable principles only according to the proportional and analogical harmony of numbers.”11The work of the musician consists therefore only in knowing, as accurately as possible, the symbolic relations of all things so as to reproduce in us, through the magic of sounds, the feelings, the passions, the visions of an almost real world. And the history of Indian music, as that of Chinese music, is full of the legends of marvelous musicians whose voice could make night fall or spring appear, or who, like the celebrated musician Naik Gopal, compelled by the Emperor Akbar to sing in the mode of fire iraga Dipak), made the water of the river Jumna boil and died burned by the flames that issued from every part of his body. The ancient Greeks, too, knew the science of connections between sounds and other aspects of manifestation, a science that for modem Westerners goes under the name of magic. “Everything obeys a secret music ofwhich the Tetractys is the numerical symbol, and the man who, like the initiated Pythagorean, has understood its true laws can achieve apparent miracles. It is, for example, with the sounds of the lyre that Amphion built the walls of Thebes.”12 T he math ematical laws of music are part of the laws by which the world’s harmony is regulated. This is why we shall find in music the same characteristics, the same geometry, the same particular numbers that are found in other aspects of the universe. Michael Maier, the seventeenth-century hermeticist and physician, attempted to determine these relations:
Like all visible things that are in nature, celestial bodies as well as terres trial ones have been created in terms of number, weight, and measure. There is thus between them an admirable and marvelous proportion in the parts, the forces, the qualities, the quantities, and their effects, from which results a very harmonious music. There is also a kind of accord and musical concert between spiritual beings, among which the soul and the human intellect are included. In the great system of this universe there is a ditone [third] from the earth, which is the base, to the sphere of the moon; from there up to the sun, which is the heart, a diapente [fifth]; and from the sun to the supreme heaven a diapason [octave]; so that the first distance is composed of eigh

teen commas or intervals, the second of thirty-six, and the third of sixtyone.13 In the microcosm or little world, that is to say in man, one can see a similar proportion between the main parts, which are the liver, the heart, and the brain, counting from the soles of the feet, not as mathematicians or geometers do, but as physicists do.14
To be able to establish the correspondence between sounds and the differ ent aspects of the universe, we must divide the indefinite progression of sound according to certain proportions, which are determined by the cyclic character of certain intervals and the properties of fundamental numbers. According to the formula of the Tao-te ching , “One has given birth to two, two has given birth to three, three has given birth to all numbers.”15 In musical terms this principle manifests itself as the original sound first producing its octave (a frequency ratio of 2/1) giving duality, then a third sound, the fifth (3/2), from which all other sounds are born. Among these sounds, in indefinite number, we must select a few whose respective ratios are adequate for the rep resentation of the world in which we are living. In this way the scale of sounds has been formed, corresponding to the material world, to the five directions of space (four cardinal directions and the center), the five elements, and so on. This is the basis on which develops the whole system of the harmony of fifths, which through their cycles form first a series of twelve sounds, then a series of fifty-two sounds, and finally a series of sixty sounds within the octave. As ex plained in an extremely ancient Chinese treatise, “the five degrees, born from the principles y in and ya n g, divide themselves into the twelve lit which, by their revolutions, produce the sixty lii.”u’ To these five principal sounds are added two auxiliary ones to form the scale of seven notes, the image of the celestial world, which corresponds with the seven visible planets in the world of spheres. Plato, in his Timacus, noted that the soul of the world is divided into seven parts. And this is why it was the seven-stringed lyre that symbolized the beauty or the harmony of the spheres. Each string of the lyre was related to a planet. The musical sounds themselves were given the names of planets, and “because the mathematical laws observed in musical art and in cosmic spheres are related to the natural rhythms of the soul,”17 music forms a logical and direct tie between the movements of the world and the movements of our soul. The steps by which Dante rose up to the supreme light also numbered seven: “the imprinted steps of the eternal power, which is the end for which the order of things is made.”18 “But what are these steps? They are precisely the different aspects assumed by this eternal power on which the order of the uni verse rests; they are the seven differentiations of the one light, the seven colors of the prism and of the rainbow, the seven sounds contained in the primordial sound, the seven luminaries by which is reflected onto our Earth the light of the



eternal great luminary that shines in the center of this vastness.”19T hey are the seven horses that drag the chariot of Surya, the Hindu sun god. T he union of the ternary and the quaternary, the sevenfold (4 + 3) symbol of the soul of the world, was represented by the seven pipes of the flute of Pan, the god of the universe. Assimilated to the seven planets, the seven notes move across the twelve regions of the octave, corresponding to the signs of the zodiac, in which, as we shall see later, these seven notes will occupy twenty-two main positions (a num ber that is in certain cases reduced to seventeen). W e shall also see why the twelve regions of the octave cannot be assimilated to twelve fixed sounds, as has been attempted in the tempered scale. They determine the space in which the notes move but can in no way be taken for the notes themselves:
The number twelve, formed by the combination of the ternary and the quaternary ( 3 x 4 = 1 2 ),20 is the symbol of the universe and the measure of sounds. . . . Pythagoras, Timaeus of Locres, and Plato, when they gave the dodecahedron as the symbol of the universe, only restated the ideas of the Egyptians, the Chaldeans, the Greeks. . . . The institution of the zodiac is the result of the application of the number twelve to the supreme sphere. . . . The number twelve, so applied to the universe and all its representations, was always the harmonic manifestation of the principles One and Two and of the way in which their elements were coordinated. It was therefore also the symbol of the coordination of sounds and, as such, applied to the lyre of Hermes.21
Built on such bases, music becomes a difficult science capable of a pro found action. “In ancient times, music was something other than mere pleasure of the ear: it was like an algebra of metaphysical abstractions, knowledge of which was given only to initiates, but by whose principles the masses were instinctively and unconsciously influenced. This is what made music one of the most powerful instruments of moral education, as Confucious had said before Plato.”22 But there is an imperfection at the very basis of the world’s existence, because if the world were perfect it would immediately be reabsorbed into the infinite perfection. The heart is not in the center of the chest, the axis of the earth is oblique, and the solar year does not coincide with the lunar year (thus creating the cycles by which all existence is conditioned and human destinies measured). In the same way the development of twelve fifths, instead of bring ing us back precisely to the octave, leaves a difference—the comma—with which we shall have to negotiate. This will complicate every calculation and prevent us from formulating those rigid and simple laws, attractive but inaccurate, in which our vain reason delights. This comma, which the modern world tries so hard to ignore, represents, for those who can understand it, the essential differ



ence between what is finite and what is infinite. The fifths form a spiral whose sounds, coiled around themselves, can never meet. For us, this limitless spiral can be the joint in the structure of the world, the narrow gate that will allow us to escape from the appearance of a closed universe, to travel in other worlds and explore their secrets. Only by respecting such subtle differences can the edifice of sounds be come the image of reality and one of the ways of spiritual realization. “It is literally by way of ‘assonance,’ of ‘accord,’ that he who ‘understands’ [evamvit] is assimilated to the source of light or (in Christian terminology) assumes a glorified body. . . . And this is possible precisely because, as Plotinus expresses it, this music is ‘a terrestrial representation of the music that exists in the king dom of the ideal world.’”23 Even if we leave aside the role of music as a means of spiritual realization, the effect of musical chords and modes (rdgas) is much more far-reaching than our ears are at first able to allow us to perceive. Our ears can apparently be satisfied by a very approximate accuracy. Yet a perfectly accurate interval not only acts on our ears but also produces a transformation in all the cells of our body—a slowing down or an acceleration in the movements of every molecule in ourselves and in the surrounding matter. This effect was used to cure certain diseases, not only in India but also in ancient Greece and later in Persia and Arabia. Muhammad Hafid describes at length these musical therapies, indicat ing the scale to employ for each disease. But if we habitually use inaccurate intervals on the grounds that our ear does not clearly perceive the difference, the effect that those sounds will produce on our organism can well be the opposite of that which our complacent ears persist in accepting. It is with our mind alone that we accept this inaccurate music, which leaves us tired and tense through an unconscious effort of adaptation, instead of agreeably transformed by the beneficial influence of the harmony. This is why disregarding small differences in intervals has very grave con sequences with regard to the deeper effect of music, consequences that can only be neglected when the real purpose of art is totally misunderstood. Unfortu nately the materialistic and highly utilitarian tendencies of our times rarely allow people to bother about anything that is not immediately tangible. We daily use all sorts of forces, recently domesticated, in total ignorance of their effect on the structure of our organism and on the balance of external events. This is why we find it quite normal to change the course of sounds if to do so brings some immediate simplification; and this leads us to try to change the endless spiral of fifths into a closed circle, to tear up the comma and divide it between the other notes and so bring the cycle of sounds within the narrow limits of human logic. Whatever advantages may be obtained by such an action (and there is no doubt that such advantages do exist), we nevertheless expel the heavenly element from music when we obliterate the possibilities of contacts



with spiritual forces by disfiguring the intervals. W hen music is thus reformed it loses its true purpose, and its magical effects, henceforth uncontrolled, can become dangerous. It is not without reason that Plato has Damo, the last of the great Pythagorean teachers, declare that “one cannot touch the musical modes without disrupting the constitution of the state.” 24 H e could as w ell have said “without disregarding universal order.” As Rene Guenon says,
In ancient times, as can be seen particularly clearly in the Far East, modifi cations could be brought into music only in accordance with changes that had occurred in the very conditions of the world, according to cyclic peri ods. This is because musical rhythms were intimately related both to the human and social order and to the cosmic order, and even in some way ex pressed the relation between the two. The Pythagorean theory of the ‘har mony of the spheres’ is connected with exactly die same sort of consideration.25
For the world to be in a state of equilibrium, its different elements need to be harmonized. Since music expresses the relations between human and cosmic orders, it must respect the exact intervals on which these relations are based, as determined by the traditional data that define those relations. Disregard for such an obvious law necessarily leads to a breakdown of equilibrium and social disorder, as the Yue j i declares:
If the gong [tonic: C (Sa)2lt] is disturbed, then there is disorganization: the prince is arrogant. If the sbang [tonic: D (Re)] is disturbed, then there is deviation: the officials are corrupted. If the.jim [tonic: E (Ga)] is disturbed, then there is anxiety: the people are unhappy. If the zhi [tonic: G (Pa)] is disturbed, then there is complaint: public services are too heavy. If the yu [tonic: A+ (Dha+)] is disturbed, then there is danger: re sources are lacking. If the five degrees are all disturbed, then there is danger: ranks encroach upon each other (this is what is called impudence) and, if such is the condition, the destruction of the kingdom may come in less than a day. . . . In periods of disorder, rites are altered and music is licentious. Then sad sounds are lacking in dignity, joyful sounds lacking in calmness. . . . When the spirit of opposition manifests itself, indecent music comes into being.. . . when the spirit of conformity manifests itself, harmonious music appears. . . . So, under the effect of music, the five social duties are without admixture, the eyes and the ears are clear, the blood and the vital spirits are balanced, habits are reformed, customs are improved, the empire is in complete peace.27

The D ifferent M udical S ystem s
Western musicians have a tendency to believe that their musical theory and notation are sufficient to express everything. W hen they hear of other intervals, they think of quarter tones, commas, and other small units, which in their opinion may have curiosity value but no serious importance so far as the general structure of music is concerned. Yet we can observe the total inability of the Western system and notation to render the melodies and chords of Asian music without completely disfiguring them. We might be tempted to conclude, as has often been suggested, that East ern peoples have a different theory and are using different intervals from those of Westerners. But a more serious study shows us that these apparently different intervals all have as their basis the same definitions and refer to the same acous tic principles. Hence the difference can only come either from a musical prac tice in contradiction to theory, or from the use of only some of the possibilities opened up by those common principles. We shall see that both these causes must be considered. As noted by Raouf Yekta Bey, “Music, like the other mathematical sci ences, is a science whose laws are fixed and invariable. Just as two and two make four in the East as well as in the West, the fundamental laws of music apply at all times and for all peoples. The differences in view which can be noted among theorists in each century and in each country can originate only from their greater or lesser lack of insight into the many questions whose study requires a theoretical and practical knowledge of music.”1 The musical system actually employed in the West is far from being a logical and absolute system based on irrefutable acoustic realities. It is the result of a mixture of traditions that has been arbitrarily simplified without taking into account, or without the knowledge of, the principles on which the component



systems were based. Because so simplified a musical system was insufficient, musicians have attempted to develop a kind of “dictionary of harmonic rela tions” according to their observations or their instinct, accumulating many dis coveries and observations, but without any explanation of their cause or the reason for their significance. These different musical systems do not oppose one another. On the con trary, they complete each other, as they all spring necessarily from the same fundamental laws of which they exploit different aspects. Like the forms of language, musical modes are permanent marks of the tradition to which a people belongs. W herever artificial systems have not destroyed or disfigured tradi tional musical modes, it is as easy by the study of music as by that of linguistics to observe the migrations of races and their influences upon each other. Striking examples are the importation of Mongolian scales into China by Genghis Khan or that of Persian modes into Northern India. In the West, in spite of the havoc created by the tempered scale, it is quite easy to find the continuity of Celtic modes from Scotland to North Africa, while the modes of Spanish gypsies are actually Indian modes, even in minute details of execution. But before we can study musical systems, it is necessary to define the exact nature of sounds and their relations.
The Structure o fM usical Sounds
Any object made to vibrate produces a combination of sound waves that, de pending on its composition, is more or less pleasant to the ear and more or less “musical.” This sound is formed of one or more fundamental notes and other notes called harmonics. The sounds used in music generally have only one fundamental note. The harmonics of this fundamental, according to their rela tive intensity, give the sound its characteristic timbre or color, making it appear more or less pure or more or less nasal (the harmonics of a flute, for example, are weak, while those of a violin are much stronger). W hen with the help of different instruments some of these harmonics are reinforced, the quality of the basic sound is enhanced, and its expressive value, which differs according to the specific harmonics reinforced, is improved. Thus is born harmony, which is the art of superimposing sounds. If the sounds are successive rather than simulta neous, the notion of time intervenes and we have to call upon memory to establish the harmonic relations, which alone give melody its meaning. The group of two or three fundamental chords that contain all the notes of a melody is called a mode. The relations between the notes that constitute a mode can be represented numerically. The mode is then, with its complete significance, represented by a group of numerical relations. Chords can be rep resented in the same way. In the musical systems in which the tonic is permanent and constantly



present to the mind of the listener, each note has a significance determined by its relation to the tonic. The melody is thus composed of a succession of sounds with a perfectly definite meaning, and therefore its significance is absolutely clear. But if the tonic is not absolutely permanent, no note can have a signifi cance unless the ratio that measures its expression is also given. This is why, in every musical system where modulation (or change of tonic) is admitted, it can be asserted that no note and no melody can have a significance without the harmonic context, which alone establishes the ratios necessary to define the meaning of each note and consequently of the entire melody. The mode, being a series of sounds that have definite relations to a perma nent tonic, can truly be said to represent the fixed harmonic basis of all melodic music, modulation being almost unknown in modal music, as the harmonic uncertainty it would create would last too long. The melodic figures, turning within a fixed circle and coming back frequently to certain notes, create a har monic complex that gives its significance to the melody. Gounod once wrote, “Sounds alone can no more constitute music than words alone can constitute a language. Words can only form a proposition, an intelligible sentence, when they are associated in a logical sequence according to the laws of intellect. This is also true of sounds, whose production, successive or simultaneous, must obey certain laws of attraction and mutual response be fore they can become a musical reality, a musical thought.”2
R elationd between. Sounds
The number of possible musical intervals is obviously unlimited in theory. But because of the limits of discrimination of our ears and the consonant properties of some ratios, the number of intervals used in musical practice is limited. Things are different in magic, where the absolute precision of a mathematical interval is necessary to produce the desired phenomenon, but for a musical evocation, the simpler acoustic intervals are sufficient. Besides, they appear so natural that without external help it is vocally almost impossible to get away from them, “the sounds that form consonances being the only ones that the human ear can accurately detect and the human vocal organ spontaneously utter.”3 If in musical practice only a small number of intervals can be used that have definite ratios between them, it must be possible to devise a scale that allows all possible combinations of such ratios. To determine such a scale we must attempt to discover the laws of numbers on which such a division must necessarily be based, and we must study the methods used in the application of these laws to musical practice by different peoples at different periods. Then, comparing the structures of the most important systems, we shall see whether it is possible to bring all the intervals that they use within a single framework without distorting them as equal temperament does.



For our investigation, musical intervals appear under two aspects: one mathematical, involving numbers and logical ratios; the other symbolic and psychological, in which the relations of sounds (their harmony) awaken in us feelings, ideas, and precise visions. These two aspects obviously have their ori gin in the same principles, but this unity is beyond the scope of experiment and consequently beyond the understanding of modem Westerners. This deficiency naturally brings them to the illogical situation of leaving aside one aspect of experience whenever they study the other, as if the laws of acoustics and those of musical expression did not refer to the same sounds.
Fifth and Octave
According to circumstances, time, and the role attributed to music, theorists have compiled musical theories from the point of view of either expression or numbers. We shall see that in the first case, the basis is generally the interval of the octave and the relations of the notes to a fixed sound—the tonic. This gives birth to modal music. In the second case, emphasis is given to the properties of the interval of the fifth, and the successions of fifths, which leads to modulation and therefore to harmony. “The conflict of the fifth and the octave, the impossibility of going from one to the other, could not escape the notice of musicians and theorists.. . . This difficulty, known to Jiao Yanshou and Jing Fang, led them to the [division of the octave into] sixty Hi, which they explained by comparisons with natural philo sophy.”4 Obviously, in the beginning such an opposition did not exist because, as all the traditions assert, people still looked at things from the metaphysical point of view, which explains this apparent dualism. Unfortunately, even in Indian tradition, the definitions that have reached us on such fundamental points are often fragmentary and intentionally obscure. But such definitions are implied by the very text of certain sacred books, and a deeper study of such books can always provide a key to those who are able to understand and interpret them.
Octave and M ode
In modal music, intervals are measured by the relation of the different notes to the tonic (Sa). The numbers that symbolize those relations form ratios that are generally simple and allow comparisons to be made, for instance, between musical harmony and the proportions of sacred architecture, the proportions of the human body, the relations of colors, the divisions of time, and so forth. Further more, aesthetic emotion being the mark of the correspondence of our subtle self with certain ratios, we can with the help of those ratios determine the funda mental numbers on which the human organism is based. These common pro



portions constitute the key whereby we can understand the real structure of music and unlock its power. They determine the significance of chords taken individually, as well as that of the systems of modal music, whether Indian, Turkish, or Arabic. They also determine the modes used by ancient Greek musicians, though these must be distinguished from the modes defined by the Greek physicists, which are based on a different principle. The relations to the tonic are brought out in modal music by the almost continuous sounding of the tonic. This constant tonic is called ison in Byzantine music (Shadja, or Sa, in modern Indian music). It seems that modem Western ers are completely unable to perceive these relations with the tonic. The re marks of Bourgault-Ducoudray comparing the ison to a spit piercing through the melody, or of Amedee Gastoue saying, “It is not, as far as we know, because of a need for harmony that the ison was introduced [r/'c] into Byzantine chant, but because of the need to keep the singers in tune,”5imply that they have not the slightest idea of those relations that are, properly speaking, the harmony of so-called monodic music and outside of which melody has little effect or mean ing. It would be just as ridiculous to speak of adding a fundamental to a chord, since a chord exists only in relation to its fundamental note. The ison or “equal” of Byzantine music was called cbandovati sruti (the measuring sound) in ancient Indian music. It is, properly speaking, the standard by which all intervals are measured. No interval, no note, no melody has a meaning unless the won (Sa) is present. It seems that Westerners are just as unable to “hear” these relations as Easterners are to perceive chords, but this is not a sufficient reason to consider either system unpleasant and useless. The icon defines the meaning of each note, which can be expressed by a numerical ratio, exactly as harmony does. And melody without ison is just as flavorless as is, for the modern Westerner, melody without harmony. W hen they disregard the importance of the ison, learned and respectable Westerners only show that they understand nothing of the Eastern music they pretend to study and explain, and that they perceive nothing of its marvelous power. The mesa was, to ancient Greek music, what the ison is to modern Byzan tine music. “For the ancient [Greeks], the A (mesa) is a directional string whose perm an en t use constitutes a guiding mark for the ear and a reduction to unity for the mind.”'1The mesa is “the connecting element of successive sounds . . . the connecting agent of all the melodic forms of the octave.”7 Eastern listeners often make such remarks as “The Beethoven symphonies are very interesting, but why have all those chords been introduced, spoiling the charm of the melodies?” From such responses we can know for certain that they do not perceive the essential elements of the music. Their failure to understand is similar to that of the Westerner who refuses to admit that modal music has a full musical significance without the addition of harmony.



Such misunderstandings are not without serious consequences. To realize this, it is sufficient to hear so-called Oriental melodies arran ged by Western composers, or, still better, to hear the so-called Westernized orchestras that graced the courts of many Indian rajas during the first half of this century, where “harmony” was understood to be the art of playing together as many discon nected sounds as possible. In modal music, the pedal point of the tonic is indispensable for the melody to have its expressions because other notes, when they are accentuated, would have a tendency to substitute themselves for the tonic and so render the expres sion of the mode completely indeterminate. Suppose, for example, using the diatonic scale (the white keys of the pi ano), we choose the mode of A (Dha) (rdga Yavanpuri Todi), whose third, sixth, and seventh degrees are minor. If we do not maintain the pedal point of the tonic A (Dha), then C (Sa) will have a tendency to become the tonic instead of the minor third. The meaning of every note will be changed and, since the modes will destroy each other, melodies will be without expression, as is the case with Western melody if it is not harmonized. It is the loss of this tonic pedal somewhere in the course of history that renders the modes of plainchant so vague and so weak. They lack a basis, and so their classification becomes a rather abstract game, like the system of the Greek Doristi in the unreal form generally attributed to it. It is only by an artificial conception that a mode can be assimilated to the plagal8 form of an other mode. It is not sufficient to state that D (Re), E (Ga), or G (Pa) has been chosen as a tonic to obtain the corresponding mode in any melody. The melody remains unaffected and in the key of C (Sa) because a permanent element is required to determine a key and habit can up to a point create this permanence in favor of C (Sa)—that is, in favor of the Western major mode, supposing that we are still using only the white notes of the piano keyboard. Another mode can be created only by constantly imposing its tonic. Percussion instruments, such as drums or cymbals, can be sufficient to determine this tonic. This is why the problem did not arise in ancient music, as such instruments were always present in a musical performance. The accurate tuning of the different notes of the scale should, of course, be sufficient to define the tonic, but as the differences be tween the intervals are very small, rare indeed are the musicians who can main tain this accuracy without referring constantly to the tonic.
Fifth and M odulation.
In modal music, as soon as the tonic moves, the modal structure crumbles and every note loses its former significance. But in connection with the changing cycle of fifths, some new permanent relations can be established, and those relations will evoke other aspects of the universal structure. In the cycle of fifths we can perceive the



reflection of the world of spheres in which we dwell. We shall find in it the laws that regulate the movements of planets, those of seasons and of days, and all those cycles that, within this universe, measure our destinies.9 Starting from a given point—the general tonic—the fifths will form ratios at first simple but becoming more and more complicated. If we take as a basis the note adapted to the cosmic period, the year, the month, and the day, these ratios will allow us to find out auspicious days for events both past and future. This is the traditional system of the Chinese, and its use in official ceremonies, as we noted already in the Yueji, helped to maintain order, political harmony, and security within the empire. But it can also contribute to their overthrow because it is the inescapable instrument of magical achievements. Still, every system exclusively based on the properties of fifths remains incomplete from certain points of view. Fabre d’Olivet says that such a system “will always lack the descending chromatic and enharmonic. Rameau, who, more than eight thousand years after Ling Lun, wanted to make it the basis of his musical system, starting from the same experiment, was forced to resort to an insipid temperament that mutilates every sound and that, proposed twenty times in China, was twenty times rejected because the scholars of the nation, although they had known for a long time the hollowness of their system, pre ferred to keep it pure, if incomplete, rather than spoil it in one of its parts in order to make up for what was missing.”1"
H arm ony and Temperament
Following the mistake of the ancient Greeks, the European classical system is divided between the two antagonistic tendencies of mode and modulation. Al though built without any “scientific” method, using aspects of each system, it has given rise to some remarkable developments by taking advantage of this lack of a rational theory. The importance of these developments in the general history of music should not be overestimated, however. By allowing such aber rations as equal temperament, the lack of a proper theoretical foundation will in all probability quickly drive the European classical system to complete deca dence. The success of African American music, with its “blue” notes so alien to equal temperament and therefore so expressive, is not due merely to fashion. It shows the need for an understandable musical system, for logical and true in tervals that can remove the veil of inexpressive insipidity which temperament spreads over even the most impassioned movements of the greatest symphonies.
M elodic E xpression or H arm onic E xpression
T he development of harmony corresponds in modern Western music to a par allel destruction of modes. From the strict point of view of musical expression, that is, from the amount of feeling and wealth of imagery that the music is able



to convey, it is thus very difficult to assert that the harmonic system gives greater possibilities of expression than any modal system. T he means of expression differ but the possibilities seem equal. Many imagine that it would be best to combine both systems, as has often been attempted. But this is not possible because of the almost complete oppo sition between them. Except for a few fundamental chords, which are also used in modal music as ornaments, all chord changes and modulations are made possible only by violating the fine distinctions in the structure of the intervals that are at the very root of modal expression. “It is therefore the introduction of harmony in musical art that has caused the disappearance of the distinction between the ancient modes. It is because of this . . . that our musical system is limited to the only two modes that possess a distinctive harmony and completely different chords: the major and minor modes, which are . . . those in which the greatest simplicity is united with the greatest number of differences.”11 All those who have been in contact with ancient Western modal music, or with the music of the Middle and Far East, have deplored the ruin of melody and rhythm that accompanies the development of harmony, a phenomenon that could be observed throughout the nineteenth century and that is still observable in such northern countries as Russia, Scotland, and Ireland. N. A. W illard has even said (not without foundation) that “modem melody has not the merit of the ancient and . . . [thus] harmony is used with the view of compensating for its poorness and diverting the attention of the audience from perceiving the barrenness of genius.”12 No better description could be given of a great number of modern works. Jean-Jacques Rousseau once remarked,
If we bear in mind that of all the people of the earth, who all possess music and songs, Europeans are the only ones who use harmony and chords and find this mixture pleasant; if we bear in mind that, of all the nations who cul tivated fine arts, not one used this harmony;13 that no animal, no bird, no being in nature produces any other sound than unison, any other music than melody; that Oriental languages, so sonorous and so musical, that Greek ears, so delicate, so sensitive, trained with so much art, have never guided those vo luptuous and passionate peoples toward our harmony; that their music had such extraordinary effects; that ours has such feeble ones; that, finally, it was to be the privilege of northern races, whose hard and rough organs are more impressed by the shrillness and the noise of voices than by the softness of accents and the melody of inflections, to make this great discovery and to put it forward as the principle of all the rules of art; if, I say, we bear all this in mind, it is very difficult not to suspect that all our harmony is only a gothic and barbarous invention, to which we would never have taken had we been more sensitive to the real beauty of art and of truly natural music.14



Of course, modem people, who accept so seriously many another of Rousseau’s theories, which are much more difficult to demonstrate, smile at such rhetoric, but they would have great difficulty in contradicting it. As Fabre d’Olivet has very justly remarked, “It is true that our modem symphonists, who can under stand nothing of the marvels described by the ancients, prefer to deny them. But a denial is not an answer, and it is not sufficient to say that something is untrue for it to be so.”15 Famous Western scholars have spoken with irony of such irrational con ceptions. Sir W illiam Jones once wrote, “The astonishing effects ascribed to music by the old Greeks and, in our days, by the Chinese, Persians and Indians, have probably been exaggerated and embellished; nor, if such effects had been really produced, could they be imputed, I think, to the mere influence of sounds, however combined and modified.”16 Happily, Jones lets us know what sort of effects he attributes to music in terms that show quite clearly the understanding he has of the subject: “After food, when the operations of digestion and absorp tion give so much employment to the vessels that a temporary state of mental repose must be found, especially in hot climates, essential to health, it seems reasonable to believe that a few agreeable airs, either heard or played without effort, must have all the good effect of sleep and none of its disadvantages; p u ttin g the soul in tune, as Milton, says.”17 It is only natural that the followers of a particular musical system, as those of a particular religion, should consider the followers of another school with contempt. This only proves that they have that absolute faith in the path they follow without which no realization is possible. But if we want to rise above mere practice and search for the principles that allow such realizations, we have to give up the outlook of faith and accept only the logic of reason. We shall then observe that, although we are at first utterly unable to discern in a strange form of music anything comparable to what we experience directly and without effort in a form familiar to us, an impartial scrutiny will show that all the essential elements or relations that are found in the one are also present in the other. There is, consequently, no theoretical reason why the same expressions, the same realizations, should not be equally possible through these different forms. Therefore, in judging the possibilities and the value of musical systems, we should not trust the prejudiced judgment of our ears, but consider in their most abstract form their theoretical possibilities. We may then discover the equiva lence of systems that at first seem to have nothing in common. We may also discover a profound difference between systems whose forms are outwardly very similar. By so doing we shall, in any case, judge the musical systems soundly and on safe grounds. To be able to realize their beauty or directly perceive their meaning is another matter and generally requires very long practice.

M easurem ent o f Intervals
To be in a position to study different musical systems, we must first look at the methods of measuring musical intervals and decide which method we shall use. On any stringed instrument, to obtain equal intervals at different pitches, we have to use smaller differences in string length the higher we go in the scale. This is because the frequency of the note produced is inversely proportional to the length of the string, and equal intervals correspond to a geometrical pro gression of frequencies. To define a musical interval, the simplest system is of course either to note the ratio of the string lengths or pipe lengths that produce the notes, which is the ancient system, or to note the ratio of the frequencies of the notes (which is the inverse of the string length ratio), as is the general practice today. For example, suppose that the open string gives the note C4 (Sa) = 512 cycles per second. To obtain D4 (Re), which is one major tone above it (a frequency ratio of 9/8), we shall have to shorten the string by one ninth of its length. T he eight ninths remaining give the note D4 (Re). To calculate the frequency, we have D4 (Re) =9/8 of C4(Sa) (that is to say, the inverse of the string-length proportion). Thus, D4 (Re) = 512 x 9/8 = 576 cycles per second. This simple and accurate system has one defect, which comes from the difficulty of knowing the relative sizes of intervals without making calculations. For example, the major half tone corresponds to 16/15 and the minor half tone to 25/24. We can easily see that the minor half tone is the smaller of the two



intervals. But is the difference between two whole tones and a fourth, the Greek limma (256/243), bigger or smaller, and in what proportion? W e cannot, with out calculation, know that it is in fact halfway between the two. If we represent the notes by their frequencies, it will not make things any easier, because the frequencies, being inversely proportional to the string lengths, do not allow a direct comparison of intervals either. For easier reading and comparison of intervals, it is necessary to replace lengths and frequencies by numbers that are related to intervals on a linear scale—that is to say, by the logarithms of string-length or frequency ratios. If we take the logarithm (base 10) of the frequency ratio and, for conve nience, multiply it by one thousand, we shall have the interval expressed in terms of the unit known as the savart.1 The Chinese use a similar but less convenient system based on decreasing powers of three. The interval of the octave (Sa to upper Sa) is equal to two when expressed as a ratio of frequencies, since a rise'in pitch of one octave corresponds to a doubling of the frequency of vibration of the sound (or to a halving of the string length). T he logarithm of two being 0.30103, the interval of the octave is equal to 301.03 savarts or, with an accuracy sufficient for most purposes, 301 savarts. This system makes the comparison of intervals very easy. For example:
the minor half tone (25/24) is approximately equal to 18 savarts, the major half tone (16/15) to 28 savarts, the Greek limma (256/243) to 23 savarts.
We can immediately see that the limma is situated between the minor and major half tones, at one comma (81/80 = 5 savarts) from each. The American system, which is more and more widely used, divides the tempered half tone into 100 parts to give a unit known as the cent; the octave is thus divided into 1,200 cents. This system has certain defects. If we wish to use logarithms to ascertain the frequency ratio of an interval, it is tempting simply to divide the number of cents in the interval by four. Unfortunately this gives an inaccurate answer, since the octave is thereby divided into 300 parts instead of 301. The main defect of the cent, however, is that its definition is based on the tempered scale, which always brings errors and does not allow the true nature of intervals to be understood.
The Scale o f Sounds
If we collect all the intervals that in ordinary practice are used in modes (rdgas), as well as in chords in relation to a note considered as the tonic, we shall obtain a certain number of points within the octave, each corresponding to a perfect relation to the tonic, though they may not have harmonious relations between themselves. If the same process is applied to each of the notes of the diatonic



scale (Sa or M a gram a), in relation to each note we shall obtain another set of points, some of which will coincide with those of the first set, and some of which will not. We shall thus obtain a number of distinct points within the octave, and we can then see whether they bring out a simple division of the octave and whether the points that form a harmonic interval with one note are also in a harmonic relation with other notes. By trying all the possible combinations of the minor tone (10/9), the major tone (9/8), and the major halftone (16/15) and all the intervals resulting from their sums or differences, we find that the minor half tone (25/24) is the differ ence between the minor tone (10/9) and the major half tone (16/15), the limma. (256/243) is approximately equal to the difference between the major tone (9/8) and the major half tone (16/15), the maximum tone (8/7) is approximately equal to the difference between the ditone (two major tones) and the minor tone, and so forth. We thereby obtain a division of the major tone into nine intervals, the minor tone into eight and the diatonic (major) half tone into five. These inter vals are each of one comma (81/80 = 5 savarts) except for a discontinuity of eight savarts between the notes of different names (for example, C and CH [Sa and komal-Re], E and F [Ga and Ma], and so on). If we relate this scale to the keyboard of the piano or organ, we shall have several notes separated from each other by one comma (5 savarts) for each key, black or white, but between the highest note corresponding to a certain key and the lowest one corresponding to the next key there remains an interval of eight savarts. If we divide that interval of eight savarts into two, we obtain, according to Western interpretation, the enharmonic sharp (or quarter tone) and the major enharmonic sharp (three-quarter tone) distant from the neighboring sounds in the scale by four savarts, or slightly less than a comma.
N otation
The system of notation we shall adopt is as follows: The sign +indicates that the note is raised by a comma (81/80 = 5 savarts).
Thus D+ (Re+)
The sign ++ indicates that the note is raised by two commas (10 savarts).
Thus D++ (Re++)
The superscript It (sharp) indicates that the note is raised by a minor half tone (25/24 = 18 savarts). We have thus moved across the discontinuity of eight savarts, and in the example given, the note is no longer called D, but Di or El,.
II
Thus DU = Et (Gat) (ati-komal)
The sign L- indicates that the lower note is raised by a limma (256/243 = 23 savarts), or the upper note lowered by a major half tone (16/15 = 28 savarts).



Thus C i = D|, (ReL-) (komal)
The sign L+ indicates that the lower note is raised by a major half tone (16/15 =28 savarts) or the upper note lowered by a limma (256/243 =23 savarts).
Thus C l = D[, (ReL+) (komal)
In the minor tone (which is equal to two limmas, that is, 46 savarts), L+ and L- are the same and are indicated simply by L.
Thus DI = E], (GaL) (komal)
The superscript |, indicates that the upper note is lowered by a minor half tone (25/24 = 18 savarts) or that the lower note is raised by a major half tone in the minor tone or by a large half tone (27/25 = 33 savarts) in the major tone.
I !.
Thus DI = E), (GaL) (komal)
The sign — indicates that the note is lowered by two commas (10 savarts).
Thus D— (Re—)
The sign - indicates that the note is lowered by one comma (81/80 = 5 savarts).
Thus D - (Re-)
To these signs are added, as previously explained, between ++ and I, the quarter tone, indicated by the sign ‘A and, between 1, and —, the three-quarter tone, indicated by the sign SA. The major tone, the minor tone, and the diatonic half tone thus may be represented as in figures 1-3.

In this way we obtain a division of the octave into fifty-three intervals, allowing us to play accurately—that is, without beats—all the usual harmonic intervals. And we can, with the help of this scale, notate accurately all the modes (ragas) of all the musical systems. By m usical systems we mean such systems as are used by musicians everywhere, afid not such constructions of pure arith metic as the tempered quarter tone. We can note here that the fifty-three intervals of the scale of fifths (see chapter 4), if we want to use them musically—that is, sing them or play them by ear on a nonkeyed instrument—are automatically transformed into the sim pler harmonic intervals, which are much easier to appreciate and much more natural. W e might add that to sing without accompaniment the tempered scale is an undertaking beyond human capacities, because we cannot, without strong external help, escape from harmonic intervals, which alone are in accordance with the physical nature of sounds and consequently with the shapes and pos sibilities of the organs by which we can emit and perceive them. “T he tone or musical interval,” the Arab theorist al-Farabi once said, “can be agreeable, composed, or imagined,”2which may mean that there are intervals that are in conformity with harmonic laws (agreeable), intervals resulting from the relations between other intervals (composed), and intervals that may appear possible in theory but that cannot be used in practice. Such intervals can be conceived but cannot be executed by ear, and for this reason do not belong to the musical field proper, which is what interests us here. Being limited to simple ratios, the acoustic intervals in use among the different human or animal races are, by the very nature of things, limited in number. But the modern “scientific” outlook, opposed to all hierarchy, consid ers the “agreeable” interval conforming to physical laws as being on an equal footing with any other interval, imagined or calculated. Such an outlook is quite astonishing to one who is not used to such egalitarian conceptions. Raouf Yekta Bey remarks, “T he views and ideas of Western musicians about the scale appear to Easterners highly surprising and impossible to understand. For example, we hear of several scales under the names of Pythagoras, of Ptolemy, of Aristoxenes,



of Zarlino, of the physicists. This may be all right. But is it the right of everyone to constitute a scale according to his own wishes and to ask people to sing according to the proportions of that scale? If nobody can do it, where do all these different scales come from ?. . . The work of a theorist is to m easure human song to find out its laws, and not to write, on a p riori grounds alone, an artificial scale composed of any ratios he may care to adopt.”3 This was also what Aristides Quintilianus thought: “The work of the musician consists not so much in comparing sounds as in assembling and bringing in tune all that Nature contains in her bosom.”4
H armonica
We are taught in primary school that we can subtract or add only things of like nature. In the same way, in the field of sounds we can establish logical relations only between sounds of like nature. Before we can study the relations between sounds, it is essential for us to know their nature. And for this, we must first examine the accessory sounds that form the natural superstructure of every individual sound, for their properties will necessarily be the basis for the prac tical construction of musical relations. It is very difficult to produce a pure sound, because along with any sound we always hear a group of harmonics whose frequencies are exact multiples of the fundamental sound. The first harmonics form a triad, which is the logical basis of all music, and their intervals are the easiest and most natural to sing. Certain wind instruments, horns in particular, can play only the harmonics of their fundamental sound. Generally, the further these harmonics are from the fundamental sound, the fainter they are. But according to the material used and the means employed to cause the vibration, certain harmonics may resound more strongly than others. All possible frequency ratios are included in the unlimited series of har monics. There is thus no harmonic or melodic combination that is not implied in the very structure of a single sound. This is, of course, a logical necessity, because there cannot be an effect whose potentiality is not contained in the cause, nor therefore an effect of sounds whose principle is not implied in every element of sound. Incidentally, this observation allows us to note the compara tive unimportance of art forms whose development is necessary only because of our inability to perceive these inherent principles. All possible ratios of sounds, being included in the series of harmonics, can be represented quite naturally by a relation of harmonics. W e thus find that the major tone C-D (Sa-Re) =9/8 is the interval from the 8th to the 9th harmonic; the minor tone D-E (Re-Ga) = 10/9 is the interval from the 9th to the 10th



harmonic; the minor half tone, 25/24, is the interval from the 24th to the 25th harmonic, and so on. T he tempered half tone can be seen as the interval from the 1,000,000,000th to the 1,059,463,094th harmonic. T he harmonics that are very near to the fundamental sound are the only ones that the human ear readily perceives and appreciates. Their relations ap pear more pleasing to us and normally form the elements of musical systems, because their correspondence with cosmic laws (the macrocosm) and with the physiological data peculiar to humankind (the microcosm) enables them to evoke ideas and images for us, which these ratios represent in simplified form. The further the harmonics are from the fundamental sound, the more they appear complicated and dissonant to us. This is because the numbers that form the first harmonics conform to the universe as our senses can perceive it. They form the legitimate human field in the magic world of sounds—the field that is open to us through the physical laws we depend on and the organs we possess, which are themselves in conformity with these laws. To those ideas, those images that we can evoke through sounds, we cannot give a tangible existence; without the knowledge of the transcendental laws of numbers, of which the perceptible laws of our illusory world give only an imperfect and approximate image, we cannot materialize them. But this knowledge is not normally accessible to us. The totality of these laws constitutes the tree of science, which it may be illegitimate and dangerous to approach.
The S cale o f H armonica
Although the harmonic series implicitly contains all the possible intervals used in music, the order in which those intervals appear does not properly constitute a musical scale. This is theoretically obvious, because the harmonic series as such has only one dimension; it is therefore unfit for even a simplified represen tation of the world of forms. The harmonic series has often been proposed by physicists and acousti cians as a basic scale, but its practical inadequacy quickly becomes clear. The main difficulty is that all its intervals differ from one another and become smaller as the scale rises. The harmonic series in its basic form is thus contrary to any form of modulation, and the fixed structure of tetrachords, the Aristotelian “body of harmony” indispensable for the establishment of musical scales, can not be established. Nevertheless, the series of the first sixteen harmonics can be considered to form a peculiar mode. W hen we deal with the meaning of musical modes we shall explain its remarkable significance. This mode can be generated by taking in turn the notes of the harmonic series and lowering each one by a whole number of octaves in order to bring it within a distance of one octave from the starting note.



If we take as a basis C (Sa), we first notice the appearance of the octave, C (upper Sa) 2/1, then the fifth, G (Pa) 3/2, then the third, E (Ga) 5/4, then the harmonic B|, (komal Ni) 7/4— lower than the usual Bt (komal N i) and forming with upper C (Sa) the maximum tone 8/7. After this appears the major second, D (Re) 9/8, which forms with E (Ga) a minor second 10/9. Then come the harmonic Ft (M a’A) 11/8, A— (Dha—) 13/8, and finally, the seventh, B (Ni) 15/8. The remaining eight of the first sixteen harmonics add no new notes, as they are at exact octave intervals from earlier harmonics in the series. Considering only the first sixteen harmonics, we thus obtain a scale of eight tones formed of the following intervals:
C D E F I G A— Bi, B C
(Sa) (Re) (Ga) (M a1At) (Pa) (Dha—) (NiL-) (N i) (Sa)
Ratios: 9/8 5/4 11/8 3/2 13/8 7/4 15/8 2/1
Savarts: 51 46 41 38 35 32 30 28
The ratios are given in relation to C (Sa), and the intervals in savarts are those between one note and the next. The harmonic series is not limited to the first cycle. It proceeds indefi nitely, though theoretically, beyond the limits of perception. Figure 4, starting from C0 (which equals thirty-two cycles per second), shows the first thirty-two harmonics in the order in which they appear.

Chinese M tuic
Chinese musical tradition certainly shares a common origin with the Indian tradi tion. The two systems are different applications of universal principles that are not only necessarily common to them but whose first enunciation seems also to have been the same. Traces of this common origin can be found in their respective essential theories, as well as in many technical expressions. Further, since the dawn of its history, China has had constant cultural exchanges with India; there are many “historical” proofs of this, even if one does not accept as historical the conquest of China by the hero Rama, or the marriage of Nakula (the brother ofYudishthira) with the daughter of the king of China. But it seems that in the periods more accessible to modem means of investigation, contacts between the two countries became rare and the two cultures took very different directions. W hile India’s music theorists were restricting themselves to the system of relations to a tonic, almost completely ignoring polyphony, the Chinese, on the contrary, were pursuing only the cyclic system, which necessarily leads to transposition. Thus the two countries became musically isolated and unintelligible to each other. This was certainly not the case fifteen or twenty centuries ago, when exchanges of orchestras between the two were quite common, as many documents, mostly Chinese, attest.
The N ature and Purpose o fM iuic
Like the Indians and the Greeks, the Chinese recognize that music is a percep tible representation of the relations that connect the different elements of



manifestation. This representation, when sufficiently accurate, can in turn act upon these relations and modify the course of events. “Music acts on the uni verse, heaven, and earth, and on all the beings contained therein.”1“Being the expression of natural harmonies, music is a translation of the moral forces that are also a part of the universe; it arises from it but regulates it in turn. This aspect of the world’s system has been profoundly analyzed and minutely ex posed first by the classical books, then, later, by philosophers and historians. T he Y ueji studies these questions from every point of view. It points out, on the one hand, similarities and essential relations between psychological, social, or political facts, and on the other, notes, instruments, melodies, songs, etc.”2“The ancient kings . . . have established in the lii the proportions of what is small and what is big and classified the beginning and the end so as to represent the duties to be performed.”3 In spite of its far-reaching possibilities, the knowledge of these subtle relations does not generally have as its aim the transgression of cosmic limits or the escape from the ehdless cycle of life and death. The Chi nese do not have that passionate desire for union with the Absolute that haunts the Indians. To them it seems essential to maintain order and harmony in our material world, and to achieve the perfect proportions in individual and social life that only the knowledge of the subtle correspondences between things can allow, harmonizing them with the help of appropriate sounds. “Music expresses the accord of heaven and earth . . . [and] produces harmony between men and spirits.”4 “T he physical laws of sound represent the social laws of hierarchy and union; they symbolize, prepare, and support good government. We might be tempted to see in these formulas a series of metaphors; the Chinese have seen in them, from the very beginning. . . the expression of real, tangible relations.”5 “He who sings becomes straight and displays his moral influence, and when he himself comes into motion, heaven and earth respond, the four seasons are in harmony, stars and planets are orderly, life is sustained in all beings.’v' This is why the mastery and ordinance of music are the first duties of politicians, be cause “if it is given to the dukes and ministers to hear the hi of each month in the court’s assemblies, they will become able to move heaven and to accord themselves to the earth’s influx.”7
Yin a n d Yang
Since the Chinese musical system has as its only aim the establishment of con tacts and mutual reactions between apparently unconnected aspects of manifes tation, it is essential, if we are to understand its applications, to get an idea of the knowledge that the Chinese had of metaphysical reality and an idea of the book that sums up that knowledge, the I ching. Though it may seem to be a digression, it is necessary to give here a very short account of it.



Composed by the mythical emperor Fu Xi in the fourth millenium B.C.E., the I cbin g has been and still remains the inexhaustible source whose form con ditions all Chinese metaphysical thinking.8 All manifestation issues from two supplementary and concordant prin ciples, one positive, spiritual, active, male, and warm—xhayang-, the other nega tive, material, passive, female, and cold—the yin . These two terms correspond to the Sanskrit linga and yoni, which symbolize Siva and Sakti, that is, purusba and prakriti, being and matter. These two principles are the basis of all exist ence. Any science must therefore begin with the definition of their respective position and proportion in the object of its study. It is with the study of this proportion that the scientist or artist should begin any enterprise, and this is particularly true of music, which is the most direct representation of the process of the world’s creation.
Jing Fang [about 45 B.C.E.] . . . had studied the 1 ching, the book of cosmogony and predictions, deeply with Jiao Yanshou. He was also learned in astrology and acoustics, since natural sciences are connected with the study of this canonical book. Following the steps of his teacher, he ex plained the theory of the progression of the lii [the cycle of fifths], not stopping after the twelfth tube as is customary, but proceeding up to the sixtieth. He based his system on the analogy of the eight glia or mystical trigrams of the / ching, which, united two by two, form sixty-four distinct combinations. Similarly the twelve original lii, multiplied by five, the num ber of elements, form in all sixty lii?
The I cbin g represents the y a n g and the y in symbolically by a full line --------- and a broken lin e ---------. These two lines can be combined in four different ways, forming the four xiang or digrams, as follows:
Z = Z extreme positivity (light, heat, etc.)
small positivity (planets)
small negativity (stars)
extreme negativity (moon, cold, etc.)
These four digrams, applied to manifested forms, can be compared to the three fundamental qualities or gunas of Indian philosophy, which condition the whole of existence. Thus:
sattva: ascending tendency, conformity to the pure essence of being
____ or rajas: expanding tendency, development
tamas-. descending tendency, obscurity, degradation



From these four digrams issue the eight trigrams, which are:
~ qian (heaven) — — zhen (thunder)
--------kun (earth) -------- sun (wind)
dui (marsh) kan (water)
/;' (fire) --------gen (mountain)
The principles represented by these eight trigrams find their application in the diverse aspects of manifestation. In the sixth chapter of The Ten Strokes o f the Wings, Confucius gives the following correspondences for the eight trigrams:
Qian (heaven): activity, horse, head, father, all that is round, sun, prince, gold, cold, ice, red, swift horse, white horse, dry tree, what is straight, dress, speech Kun (earth): passivity, mare, womb, mother, cloth, axe, economy, equality, the mother of the bull, cart, appearance, crowd, handle, black, what is square, bag, pipe, fly Dui (marsh): he-goat, mouth, girl, child, diviner, tongue, rupture, hardness, concubine, duration Li (fire): vibration, pheasant, eye, wife, sun, thunderbolt, woman, posterity, weapon, tortoise, stomach, reptile, fruit, stem, cow Zhen (thunder): movement, the feet, the male principle, dragon, thun der, yellow, causal influence, highway, the elder son, haste, bamboo, har monious song, mane, rebirth, repetition, crow Sun (wind): entrance, hen, thigh, the female principle, wood, the elder daughter, thread, white, work, length, height, branch, the sense of smell, broad forehead, profile, tree, search Kan (water): fall, pig, ear, husband, hidden secret, roof, bowstring, indisposition, blood circulation, pale red, ardor, light foot, cover, calamity, mood, thief, hardness of heart, den, music, thorny bush, weasel Gen (mountain): stop, fox, hand, boy, path, stone, door, monk, finger, mouse, solidity, nose, tiger, wolf10
These trigrams, combined two by two, form sixty-four hexagrams, which allow the representation of all aspects of existence. It is through them that we can study and bring into practice the laws of correspondence between the different aspects of the world and, in the field of music, understand the modalities accord ing to which the hierarchical succession of fifths will allow us to reach all the planes of the visible and invisible world, influence spirits, celestial emperors, elements, and seasons, and regulate the destinies of the empire. This is possible because “rites and music rise up to heaven and surround the earth, act upon the



principles ofyin and yang, and communicate with the m anes [spirits of the ances tors] and heavenly spirits.”11“M usic. . . shakes heaven and earth, moves the spirits, brings into accord the two cosmogonic principles, penetrates men and m a n es”n The correspondence of the trigrams to musical notes will vary depending on the method used to determine this correspondence, each method being valid in its own field. The comparison can, for example, be based on their symbolism, individually or in combination, or it can be based on an analysis of the trigrams’ structure and the relative positions of broken and unbroken lines as compared with the structure of tetrachords and chords. T he peculiarity of the trigrams is that, in whatever way they are manipulated, the endlessly various results will always be in conformity with some aspect of reality.
The Seven D egreed o f the P entatonic Scale
Chinese people have always been realists. They willingly conceive of abstract principles, but only to find immediate applications for them. The I ch in g itself, with its metaphysical trigrams, may have survived the persecution of scholars only because of its magical applications. The ancient Chinese were certainly not ignorant of the transcendency of the heptatonic scale, which was assimilated by them to the “seven beginnings” (q ish i). However, since they conceived of music only as a means of harmonizing the elements of terrestrial existence and establishing a balance between spirit (heaven) and matter (earth), they did not pay much attention to the seven de grees, which form the scale of transcendental worlds; on the contrary, they cultivated to its utmost potentiality the science of the pentatonic scale, which symbolizes the opposing forces of heaven and earth, of y a n g and yin , held in equilibrium in the dualism of existence. Many modern authors, carried away by the theory of evolution, want to make the heptatonic scale into a late development of a more “primitive” pentatonic form. As there is no concrete basis on which such a theory can be built, I do not propose to discuss it. We need only note that in the Chinese system (the only important pentatonic system of our times), although priority is evidently given to the first five notes in the cycle of fifths, which correspond to the five elements and which alone can be expressed by whole numbers according to the tradi tional definitions, this priority in no way implies that the two auxiliary degrees are not known or used. In Indian theory, music issues from seven sounds uttered by the seven rishis or sages, and connects in turn with the seven dvlpa or con tinents, which symbolize the seven successive aspects of the world’s manifesta tion characterized by the seven colors of the spectrum. Unless we are ready to accept the idea that the “primitive” spectrum had only five colors, which is obviously absurd, it is difficult to see why things should be different for sounds. In reality, the laws that regulate the division of sounds, like those of light, are



physical laws and not mere attributions, and it is only through ignorance that we may believe them to be arbitrary. Furthermore, the S b u jin g and the Han shu admit of the seven notes from the earliest times:
At the date 522 b .c .e . the Zuo zhuan relates a conversation between the prince of Shi and Yan Zi, who enumerates the five degrees, the six lii, and the seven sounds, and commentators see in the seven sounds the five principal degrees and the two supplementary ones. The Guoyu, in a quo tation from the musician Zhou Jiu, [a contemporary of K ingjing (544-20 b .c .e .)], explains by the seven degrees, which it calls the seven lii, the date of the battle that King Wu won against the Yin. Whatever might be the value of such astrological considerations, they clearly indicate that four or five centuries before the Christian era, the existence of the seven-note scale was acknowledged as having existed since the beginning of the Zhou,”
which by no means precludes an earlier existence. Again, “the crown prince Sheng . . . declares that the seven-note scale has been known since the time of the emperor Shun (twenty-third or twenty-first century b .c .e .). The seven notes were then called the seven beginnings or qi shi. This expression is found in a passage of the Shu jin g , quoted by the Han sbu: “The S h u jin g says, ‘I wish to hear the harmony of the six lii, the five degrees, the eight sorts of instruments, the seven beginnings.’”14 These seven qi shi might well correspond to the seven rishis of Indian tradition, the deformation of the word followed by the attribution of a some what different meaning being not unusual for the passage of Vedic or Sanskrit words into Chinese.15
Sym bolic R epresentation o f the P entatonic Scale
The earth, or visible world, is symbolized by the number four, which can be visually represented by the square. The earth is made of four perceptible ele ments, and all its characteristics are regulated by the number four (four seasons, four directions of space, four castes, etc.). But these four elements issue from one unique and celestial element, ether (akdsa), of which they are only the modalities. Similarly, all matter exists only in relation to a single principle of manifestation. This projection of the single into the multiple is symbolically represented in Egypt, as well as in America and China, by the pyramid, whose square base seems to issue from the summit (the summit can also be represented by its projection at the center of the square). Music, being the representation of the relationship between heaven and earth, must quite naturally have this configuration of a center or tonic (gong) surrounded by four notes assimilated to the four directions of space, the four perceptible elements, the four seasons, and so on.

The pentatonic scale thus presents a structure that allows it to be an ad equate representation of the static influence of heaven on earth. But a static representation of a world in motion could not be an instrument of action upon that world. It is necessary, if we want to act upon die represented elements, to evolve from the motionless to the moving, from the angular to the circular, from the square to the circle. To express the movements of the universe, the sounds will have to submit to the cyclic laws that, in their own field, are repre sented by the cycle o f fifths.
The S piral o f Fifths
As we have already seen, the fifth is the third sound of the series of harmonics, the first being the fundamental and the second its octave. According to the formula of the Tao-te ch in g (“One has produced two, two has produced three, three has produced all the numbers”),16we can understand why the third sound, the fifth, must necessarily produce all the other sounds by its cyclic repetitions. The first to be produced will be the four principal sounds, which form compara tively simple ratios with the tonic (ex. 1). They are:
II G (Pa) = 3/2
III D (Re) = 9/8
IV A+(Dha+) = 27/16
V E+ (Ga+) = 81/64
Exam ple 1
I III V II IV I
S a Re Ga+ ' Pa Dha+ Sa
To these five primary sounds, whose disposition represents the elementary structure of the perceptible world, can be added the two auxiliary sounds:
VI B+ (Ni+) = 243/128
VII FI (MaL+) = 729/512
Thus is formed the seven-note scale in example 2.
Example 2 I III V VII II IV VI I
°°
S a Re Ga+ MaL+ Pa Dha+ Ni+ S a
But the two auxiliary sounds should not be used as fundamentals, because they belong to the scale of invisible worlds, and so we can neither perceive their accuracy nor build systems upon them without going out of tune:



At the date 541 B.C.E. Z uo relates a consultation given by He, physician of the land of Xin, to the marquis of Jin, then ruling: . . . “Beginning from the central sound, if we diminish [the length], after five diminutions, play ing [on the instruments] is no longer allowed.” Cai Yuangding sees in this text the law, imperative in ancient times, that allows the building of sys tems only on the five principal degrees. . . . The diminution of length indicates the passage to the fifth above, and in the series of fifths, the sixth degree obtained is a complementary degree and therefore inadequate for the foundation of a system.17
As we shall see later, the fifth successive fifth, whether in an ascending or a descending series, represents the limit of consonance in modal music also. Beyond this limit, no interval can appear harmonious, nor can it be accurately recognized. A rule originating from the same principle was also known in medieval Europe, where the tritone was prohibited as diabolical, that is, as connected with forces that are supernatural and (therefore uncontrollable. After these seven notes, the next five notes generated by the series of fifths
are:
I
VIII D[, (Re komal) !.
IX A I, (Dha komal) I
X Ej, (Ga komal)
XI BK N i komal)
XII F+ (Ma+)
We now have twelve sounds, which divide the octave chromatically into twelve half tones. The twelfth fifth (note 13) brings us back to the fundamental, but with a slight difference. It is higher than the fundamental by one comma, the Pythagorean comma (3,2/219= 531,441/524,288 or 5.88 savarts). It is, therefore, in our nota tion, C+ (Sa+). If we proceed further, the twelve following fifths will place themselves one comma above the former ones, and the 24th fifth (note 25) will be one comma above C+ (Sa+), that is, C++ (Sa++). In this way, successive series of twelve fifths will be placed one above the other at one-comma intervals, up to the 52nd fifth (note 53).18 However, after the 52nd fifth, the octave is filled up and the 53rd fifth (note 54) comes out of the octave and inserts itself between the octave C (Sa) and the twelfth fifth C+ (Sa+), thus forming, above C (Sa), a small interval of 0.84 savarts. Thus begins a new cycle, which in its turn, with a period of 53 fifths, will divide the octave into small intervals of 0.84 savarts. The next cycle will appear during the seventh series of 53, when the 359th fifth (note 360) comes out of the octave and forms, with C (Sa), an interval of 0.47 savarts. The



next cycle is of 666 notes, with a basic interval of 0.035 savarts. Then comes a cycle of 25,524 notes with a basic interval of 0.0021174 savarts. This cycle is very near to that of the precession of the equinoxes, or the Pythagorean great year, which is of 25,920 solar years. The small difference between the twelfth fifth and octave, similar to that of the lunar and the solar year, leaves the door open for further cycles.19 In practice, for reasons that are symbolic as well as musical, after the 52nd fifth (53rd note) the Chinese follow the series only for the next seven degrees, which place themselves above those of the initial seven-note scale, and they stop the series at the 60th note. The reason given is that 12 (the number of each cycle) x 5 (the number of the elements) = 60. This scale of fifths, perfect for transposition because of its extreme accu racy, also allows the study of astrological correspondences and of terrestrial influx, provided one possesses knowledge of the hierarchy of its intervals. “In the same melody, the prime, the third, the fifth, the sixth, are chosen indepen dently because of their connection with diverse constellations and, consequently, with heavenly spirits, earthly spirits, and m anes.”10 Taking as the tonic any one of the notes of the first cycle, a scale of five notes can be obtained that form simple ratios (harmonic relations) with the tonic. The two auxiliary degrees already form somewhat troublesome ratios, and the others can be used only if the tonic is changed. The scale of fifths is therefore invariable and does not allow the study of harmonic proportions and chords.
Equalized o r Tem pered D ivisions
Considering the first series of fifths, we can obtain the six perfect tones (five fifths and the tonic):
I C (Sa) 11 G (Pa) HI D (Re)
IV A+ (Dha+) V E+ (Ga+) ^ B+ (Ni+)
and the six imperfect tones (sharps and flats and the imperfect fourth): i+ L+ ^
VII Fit (Ma tivra) VIII D|, (Re komal) IX At (Dha komal)
X El, (Ga komal) XI B |,(Ni komal) XII F+(Ma+)
These can be considered as alternately masculine and feminine, as shown in Figure 5. If we neglect the small difference between the thirteenth fifth and the octave, we obtain the equalized chromatic division into twelve half tones on which all temperaments, or equalized divisions of sound, space, and time, are based. The spiral is thus transformed into a circle, and the six perfect tones can

be represented by the sides of an inscribed hexagon. If we divide the side of the hexagon (which is equal to the radius) first into two, then into ten parts, this will lead us to the division of the circle first into twelve then into sixty parts, divi sions that are always employed for the representation of the world’s movement within a closed circle. Westerners use this division for the measurement of circles and angles (60 x 6 = 360 degrees) and, consequently, for astrology and astronomy (the twelve signs of the zodiac, for example; see fig. 6). W e use a similar division for time, dividing the day into twice twelve hours, the hour into sixty minutes, the minute into sixty seconds, and so on—divisions that are said to have been borrowed from the Chaldeo-Assyrians. Westerners also divide the octave into twelve, but do not proceed with the logical implications of this division as the Chinese do. In reality, the physical laws that apply to sounds are not peculiar to them but are those which regulate all the normal rhythms of the universe. Those “rational” minds that smile at such notions might nevertheless be very embarrassed if Saturday did not come every seventh day, if the days no longer had twenty-four hours or the hours sixty minutes, and if the relation of the sun to the moon no longer formed a cycle of twelve months with a slight difference comparable to that between twelve fifths and seven octaves.
The Lii
The ancient Chinese did not make use of any scale other than that formed by the first five notes of the series of fifths, but they observed that if they wished to form a similar scale for transposition, starting from any note other than the fundamental, four additional notes were necessary. These notes form a continu ation of the cycle of fifths, and this is what led the Chinese to take as the basis of their music the series of the first sixty fifths, which divide the whole structure of the octave into what Westerners call Pythagorean commas. “T he scholar Chen Zhongru . . . demonstrates the impossibility of transposition if one is limited to the original twelve lii."2' As standards for the sixty notes in the octave, tubes of metal of extremely precise dimensions had been made since the remotest antiquity, giving sounds of fixed pitch, which are called Hi and are the indispensable basis of Chinese music. Any of the lii can be taken as a tonic provided that there are other lii accurately tuned to form the pentatonic scale. “The five degrees, born from the principles y in and ya n g, divide themselves between the twelve lii, which by their revolutions produce the sixty lii. It is by those diverse agents that the influx of the ‘Bear’ can be regulated and the rela tions between beings manifested. Heaven manifests itself in the seasons, earth manifests itself in sounds, that is to say, in the lii. If the y in and the y a n g agree, then when the seasons come, the influx of the lii responds.”22

In this figure the order of succession of the fifths is given by the sides of the central star dodecagon. Each angle is connected by a dotted line to its upper fifth and its lower fifth. The notes that correspond to the angles of the hexagon are masculine; the notes that correspond to the middle of the sides are feminine.



The accurate measurement of the lii is obviously of fundamental impor tance, since not only the perfect relations of sounds depend on it but also the standard pitch taken as a basis for the whole system. “If, to measure the five degrees of the scale, the foot corresponding to the fiery element is used, fire becomes important; . . . with the metal foot, weapons are important; with the water foot the lii are in perfect tune, the empire is at peace.”25
The D egreed o f the Scale
Arising from the principles of yin and y a n g , the fifths thus engendered are alternately of feminine and masculine character. Each note has a double char acter, one permanent as a lii, that is to say, as a particular frequency, the other variable, according to its rank as degree in the scale (tonic, fifth, fourth, etc.). A rise in the standard pitch, such as that which has occurred in Europe during the last two centuries, must therefore, according to the Chinese, consid erably change the influence, if not the expression, of music. It is always to such variations that the fortune or the fall of dynasties can be attributed. The notes in the series obtained by an ascending fifth (lower generation) are of feminine character, and those obtained by a downward fourth (upper generation) are masculine. According to the Lii sbi cbun qiu, the most ancient text on the lii: “To the three parts of the generator, one part should be added to form the upper generation [an increase in length in the ration of 4/3, giving a drop in pitch of a fourth]; from three parts of the generator one part should be taken off to form the lower generation [a decrease in length in the ratio 2/3, giving a rise in pitch of a fifth].”24 This is also in conformity with the Indian theory on the active character of the fifth and passive character of the fourth. Let us note here that the most striking difference between the system of fifths and that of harmonic relations to a tonic resides in the perfect fourth, which is an essential interval in the scale of proportions. The scale of fifths has an augmented fourth as its sixth fifth, the interval of a fourth appearing only, in a slightly augmented form F+ (Ma+), as the eleventh fifth, or, almost perfect, as the fifty-second fifth. But if, instead of starting from C (Sa), we had begun one fifth below, that is to say, from F (Ma), we would have obtained this essential note without changing anything in our scale, except that, since we begin with a masculine interval instead of a feminine interval, the character of the whole system is modified. This is not merely an arbitrary attribution, but corresponds to a fundamental difference in musical expression that the Indians express by the difference between the Sa and the Ma gram as (the tonic on the fundamental or on the fourth) and the Greeks by the difference between the modes in which the mesa (middle note) is the tonic and those in which the fundamental is the tonic. Herein lies the inner difference of significance between the two Dorian modes, between the Lydian and the Hypolydian, and so on.



“T he five notes, according to Sima Qian, correspond to the five lii [known as] bu an g zhong, tai cu, g u xian, lin zhong, and nan lii—the only ones whose measurements can be expressed by whole numbers, starting from the base 8 1.”25 “The numbers given by the Chinese to correspond with the relative length of the tubes in the pentatonic or five-tone scale are 81, 54, 72, 48 and 64 . . . these numbers hold great cosmological significance in Chinese culture, as do the numbers 3 and 2, which symbolize heaven and earth respectively.”2<i T he first four fifths, which form “simple” ratios with the tonic, are, from the most ancient origins, the five degrees of the Chinese scale:
I g o n g C (Sa) 1/1 = 81/81
II zhi G (Pa) 3/2 =81/54
ffl sbang D (Re) 9/8 =81/72
IV y u A+ (Dha+) 27/16 =81/48
V jim E * (Ga+) ' 81/64 = 81/64
We see that the Chinese numbers are the denominators of these ratios and therefore correspond to acoustic reality as well as to the necessities of symbolism. To those degrees are added, by two new fifths, the two auxiliary degrees, which no longer correspond to whole numbers on the basis of 81. They are:
VI bian g o n g (modified go n g) or he (auxiliary)
= 81/64 x 3/2 = 243/128 = B+ (Ni+)
VII bian zhi (modified zhi) or m iu (different)
= 243/128 x 4/3 = 729/512 = FL+» (MaL+)
The S cale o f the Lii
Since the lii huang zhong is the fundamental (gong), we shall consider it as corresponding to C (Sa), because of its traditional use as the general tonic, although according to Father Amiot its frequency is of 708.76 cycles per second, which makes it an FI (M ai) on the scale of the physicists, or an F natural in modern Western pitch. “Gong, source of light, the center to which everything is attracted, corresponds to the sound we call F.”27 To be able to represent the intervals of the first twelve notes of the cycle of fifths by whole numbers, the Chinese take the length of an open string (or pipe) sounding the huang zhong as equal to 177,147 = 3“ units. The first fifth (lii II) will be 2/3 of that number, that is, 310 x 2 = 118,098. The next fifth, brought back within the octave (lii III), will be 4/3 of this new number, that is, 39 x 23 = 157,464. The following fifth (IV) will be 2/3 of the preceding number, that is, 38 x 24 = 104,976. The following fifth (V) will be 4/3 of the preceding number, and so on.



The fifths whose numbers in the series are even (II, IV, etc.) are feminine, and the fifths whose numbers are odd (I, III, V, etc.) are masculine. “Six of the lii bear especially the name of lii (rules), or zhong (middle, medium): they are those whose rank in the series is odd; they depend on the male principle, yan g. The six others, whose rank is even, depend on the female principle, yin , and are called lii2* (helpers), or, in a more ancient form, tong (companions), or jia n (intermediaries).”29 The representative numbers of the fifths go on in this way until the twelfth lit, F+ (Ma+) =217= 131,072. Thereafter, the numbers are no longer integers, as this number is not divisible by three, but can be represented by whole numbers with a degree of approximation similar to that of ordinary logarithms (savarts). If we follow the endless development of the series of fifths, it will lead us, octave after octave, into vibratory regions that no longer belong to the realm of perceptible sounds and where the various successions and groupings of vibra tions will take ever new and unexpected forms. These particular properties of the vibratory scale constitute the key that reveals the difference in the nature of the vibrations at different stages, perceived as sound, light, touch, taste, or smell, and finally the structure of matter and of the atom itself, as envisaged by the Indian grammarians. The graphic representations of the cycle of fifths at its different stages will give us successively all the important symbolic and geometrical constructions. Within the range of sound we already obtain, as primary graphic representa tions, the square, the pentagon, the dodecagon, the circle, the spiral, the laby rinth, the zig-zag, and so forth. We cannot enter here into a lengthy study of the properties of the powers of the ratio 3/2 and its graphic representations. Figure 7 presents the succession of the sixty Hi according to the system of Jing Fang (c. 45 b .c .e .).
S ym bolism a n d C orrespondences o f the Lii
Western readers should be warned against making any hasty judgments about the practical value of the correspondences attributed to musical notes by the Chinese or the Indians. These attributions are by no means arbitrary and are perfectly in accordance with the inevitable significance of musical intervals, although they often refer to certain kinds of correspondences that we are not accustomed to consider. Their application can be found in every music—and in particular in Western music—in a way that may appear almost systematic, as in Wagner, or instinctive, as in Beethoven, Liszt, or Chopin. And it is necessary that it should be so, because the descriptive value or the emotional significance of all music depends on these correspondences. The Chinese system of correspondences is logical and coherent. W e can unfortunately only glance at it here.

The first twelve notes of the series of fifths, or lii, divide the octave into twelve half tones corresponding to the different moons or months (see Figure 8):

The da lii (VIII), D|, (ReL+), corresponds to the twelfth moon,
The tai cu (III), D (Re), corresponds to the first moon,
T he j i a zhong (X), E|, (Ga|>), corresponds to the second moon, and so on.
“The h u a n gz h on g [I, fundamental =C, Sa], is the lii of the eleventh moon, that of the winter solstice. Of yellow color,30it corresponds to the element earth because in that season tht y a n g influx, male and hot, is hidden in the earth.”31 “The h u an gz h on g [I] is used as the fundamental in the sacrifices to heaven because it is the lii of the eleventh moon and because, in that season, the vivi fying influence of heaven begins to make itself felt. The tai cu [III, D, Re], is adequate for the sun because it is the male form of th e jia zhong, which corre sponds to the spring equinox; it is indeed at the time of the equinox that the sun is worshiped. The huang zhong [I, C, Sa], is assigned to the emperor, prince among men and image of heaven, the nan lii [IV, A, Dha], to the empress.”32 The Chinese scale, being invariable, constitutes in effect a single mode. Every change in expression or significance will therefore depend upon modu lation, that is, a change of tonic. This is also true to a certain extent in Western music. According to Jing Fang:
Each separate lii being the perfection of a day, the others are to be trans posed according to their order, because the lit corresponding to the days are, in succession, the fundamental note. . . . Because there are twelve Hi and twelve scales similar to the standard scale [of seven notes], there are eighty-four systems, of which sixty are for the principal modes and twenty-four for the complementary modes.”
“Among the twelve lii, seven sounds [degrees] are taken successively, which make a scale. . . . For each scale there are seven systems: in total eighty-four systems on which are based the melodies, sung or played.”34 “For sacrifices at the altar of heaven, the huang zhong [I] should be taken as a fundamental [Sa]; for the altar of the earth the lin zhong [II]; for the temple of ancestors the tai cu [III]; for the ceremonies in the five suburbs, for the assemblies of congratulations, and for the court banquets, the lii of the month.”35 According to the Da king hui dian (eighteenth century):
The huang zhong [I] is fundamental for sacrifices to heaven and to the shang ti. The lin zhong [II] is fundamental for the sacrifices to the earth. The tai at is fundamental for sacrificing to the emperors or empresses of the ruling dynasty, and also to the sun and to the tai mat [the spirit of the

In spring the jia zhong [X] is fundamental, and in autumn the nan lii [TV] is fundamental, for the sacrifices to the tai she, the tai zi [spirit protectors of the state territories], to the rulers of former dynasties and to Confucius. . . . When the emperor appears in the great hall of the throne for the three great yearly festivals, the fundamental is the huang zhong [I]; when the empress comes into the central palace on the occasion of the three great yearly festivals, the fundamental is the nan lii [TV]. For ordinary assemblies at the court, the lii of the month should be taken as fundamental.. . . Generally, there are melodies of nine repetitions (for sacrifices offered to the shang ti), of eight repetitions (for sacrifices performed at the altar of agriculture, the altar of the sun, the altar of the first agriculturists), of six repetitions (for sacrifices performed in the temple of ancestors, at the altar of the moon, etc.).36
“From the winter solstice to the summer solstice are the months born from the y a n g principle; in these months only half lii [high pitch] are used and no double lii [low pitch]. From the summer solstice to the winter solstice are the months of the y in principle; then are used double lii and no half lii, because the ya n g corresponds to one and the yin to two.”37 “To the emperor and the prince corresponds the huang zhong [I, C, Sa], that is, the element earth.

C orrespondences o f the D egreed o f the Scale
“Notes begin to have a musical value when a certain number of them, chosen for reasons of perceived affinities, form a scale or melodic progression. The chromatic series . . . is therefore not, properly speaking, musical, as each sound is put into a neutral state in relation to the others. . . . The lii, the material of music, acquire meaning when some of them are chosen as degrees of a scale.” Only then does their significance become clear and can their symbolism be definitely perceived and understood.” The Yue lin g bring out the connection between months and elements, the lii on one side and the five degrees on the other, and, finally, the numbers from five to nine.”40 We shall give below some of the correspondences of the notes consid ered as degrees of the scale. These correspondences will be maintained in transposition whatever may be the lii corresponding to the fundamental degree (gong). “T he element earth, which has no corresponding season, is nevertheless connected with a degree, a lii, a number.”41 “T he five degrees of the scale are assimilated to the prince, the ministers, the people, the works, the material resources; but the prince being superior to the minister, it is necessary that the corresponding note be lower than that of the minister.”42
The gon g degree (tonic) represents the prince.
The shang degree (second) represents the ministers.
The jia o degree (third) represents the people.
The zhi degree (fifth) represents public works.
The y u degree (sixth) represents the products.
“If the five degrees are not disturbed, there will be no discordant sounds.”43 The five notes correspond to the five natural agents:
Gong (tonic) = center of the earth
S hang (second) = metal and autumn Jia o (major third) = wood and spring
Yu (sixth) = water and winter Zhi (fifth) = fire and summer44
“T he shang degree is firm and rigid; . . . it has the sound of metal.”45 According to the Zhou li:
One and six are the numbers of water (shelled species).
Two and seven are the numbers of fire (feathered species).
Three is the number of wood and also that of the dragon of the eastern sea (scaly species).



Four is the number of metal and of the west (hairy species; the white tiger of the western hills).
Five is the number of the earth (naked species and spirits of the Earth).
Six is the number of celestial spirits.46
The colors of the five degrees are:
Fundamental, C (Sa)—yellow
Major second, D (Re)—white
Ditone, E+ (Ga+)—blue
Fifth, G (Pa)—red
Sixth, A+ (Dha+)—black.
The dominant color in spring E+ (Ga+) is blue, the dominant color in summer G (Pa) is red, the dominant color in autumn D (Re) is white, and the dominant color in winter A+ (Dha+) is black.
Western. C om m entaries
W ith the prejudice of Westerners, who so often deny a p riori all the scientific conceptions of other races until they are “rediscovered” by themselves and ceremoniously re-named in Latin or German, the Chinese division of the oc tave, however rational it may be, is ridiculed by most Western writers. Even Maurice Courant allows himself to write: “Needless to say, the sixty degrees in the octave are scarcely perceptible and are difficult to realize, a slight difference of temperature bringing a significant variation in the sound compared with the interval of two successive degrees. Such a scale can never be accurate.”47 I do not know on what grounds Courant makes such a sweeping statement, which experiments could easily have proved unfounded. If he were to tune two strings corresponding to the same note of his piano with one comma of differ ence, he would then see whether this interval is perceptible, and I cannot believe that his piano plays such dreadful tricks with every change of temperature. We should not forget that the problem is not to play intervals of one comma in succession but to play intervals with an accuracy of one comma. A difference of one comma in a fifth or an octave is not only perceptible but extremely dis agreeable even to an untrained ear. T he same difference in a third or in a major second (it is then the difference between the major and the minor tone) com pletely changes the color of the note and its expression. One can even say, as a rule, that such differences are the very basis of vocal and melodic expression, whether one is conscious of it or not, as can easily be verified with accurate instruments for the measurement of frequencies. Western scholars have two obsessions, into whose framework they wish to



force all the facts. One is the theory of evolution applied to the short period of recorded history. The other, sometimes called the “prejudice for classicism,” pretends that everything whatsoever comes from the Greeks. To give an in stance of the former, they remain undisturbed by the fact that their musical theory is extremely nebulous and often in contradiction to elementary acoustic laws, and find it quite natural to believe that it is by mere chance that the Chinese have for thousands of years been using a perfectly scientific theory. As an example of the prejudice for classicism let me quote Maurice Courant again: “It seems that an entirely new musical system has been substituted for the rudimentary carillons in which China had hitherto taken delight. As this system is exactly that of the Pythagoreans, and it makes its appearance in the Far East after the expedition of Alexander, one would be inclined to believe that it was a result of the influence of Greek civilization in China.”4'1 Courant is here simply repeating the words of other orientalists who claim that Chinese music developed as a result of a Greek military expedition to the Indus. It is impossible to treat seriously such poetic flights of fancy, which show only a very weak knowledge of geography. There is no doubt that the Chinese system is similar to that of Pythagoras. But if an influence is to be considered, it was certainly in the opposite direction. The immediate sources of Greek music were undoubtedly in the Near East, and the Phrygian and Lydian modes were so called not because Alexander taught them respectively to the Phrygians and the Lydians but because the Greeks borrowed them from those peoples. Besides, the travels of Alexander to the banks of the Indus can in no way affect Chinese culture, because to come from Macedonia to Bactria is a very simple journey compared with the enor mous distance and the formidable obstacles that separate the Indus from Beijing. A few scholars, however, take a diametrically opposite view. According to David and Lussy, “The musical system of the Greeks had certainly not origi nated in their country. . . . One is bound to suppose that Pythagoras brought from the East the musical system that was adopted by his countrymen of Hellas. . . . It was foreigners coming from India, Persia, and Asia Minor; the Phrygians Hyagnis, his son Marsyas, and Olympus; the Thracians Linos, Thamyris, and Orpheus, who imparted music to Greece. We therefore believe, until better information is obtained, that the Hellenic tonal system had its origin in India or perhaps in China; the Greek instruments were all of Asian origin, and we admit, with Fetis, that in music nothing belongs to the Greeks that cannot be found in the Orient in conditions of superiority that leaves them far behind. . . . Let us examine their instruments. . . . compare them with the abundant variety of instruments that the Orientals once possessed, and we shall be bound to recognize that the Greeks, so remarkable in other artistic fields, have been,



of all the ancient peoples, the least proficient in those resources that are the essentials of a musical culture.”49 These simple observations, which every available fact corroborates, should create at least some doubt in an unprejudiced mind with regard to the Greek origin of Eastern musical systems. But as we have already seen, this does not apparently disturb later scholars when they want to impose their prejudices. This ability to juggle facts and ignore all those views or proofs that contradict their opinion has made almost all the theories of Western scholars concerning the relations of Eastern and Western civilizations of ancient times absolutely untrustworthy. Indeed, in certain fields, accepted theories that are believed by most Westerners to be irrefutable truths amount to nothing less than a delib erate falsification of history.

Indian M usical T heory
From the remotest antiquity, besides a general theory of sounds, a theory of musical modes has existed in India, which seems to have been the source from which all systems of modal music originated. Unlike other systems, the Indian theory is not limited to experimental data, nor does it arbitrarily consider cer tain modes or certain chords as “natural”; rather, it takes as its starting point the general laws common to all aspects of the world’s creation. Starting from metaphysical principles, the Indians have recreated the theory of sounds. T hey have analyzed and classified all possible ratios and relations between sounds. The result is obviously an astronomical number of theoreti cally possible chords, modes, and combinations, of which only a few are used in practice. The others, however, remain accessible for the day when new condi tions or the inspiration of musicians may require new modes or new musical forms. T he Indian classification deals once and for all with the subject of musical relations. It is the necessary basis of any serious study. All other classifications are child’s play beside it. Unfortunately its approach is difficult; no systematic study of it has been made in any modern language, and we cannot begin this enormous undertaking here. But without going beyond the limits of the classi



fications used today in Indian music, we can find therein easily understandable elements, which are sufficient for the comparative study of all the existing modal systems.
The Laws o fM usic and their A pplications
The theory of sounds can be approached in two ways: either as the systematic application of the universal laws of creation common to sound and other aspects of manifestation, or as the empirical use of physical peculiarities in the develop ment of sounds. The first approach is called by the Indians m arga (directional) and, being based on absolute laws, is universal and unchangeable, while the other, which is called d esi (regional), varies endlessly according to place and time. The power of a music constructed according to m arga rules is extraordi nary, its influence over animate and inanimate things unlimited. In the words of the grammarian Bhartrihari, “This science of sounds is the chemistry of the universe.” There is no sort of transformation in the structure or appearance of things that cannot be achieved through the influence of organized sounds. Ritual music must necessarily follow the rules imposed by m arga theory. This is why most of the m arga definitions are kept in the ritual that regulates the singing of Samaveda. On the other hand, the object of desi music is usually only pleasure or the expression of human feelings and passions, so desi systems vary greatly from country to country and from time to time. T heir influence may be good or bad. All modern musical systems are of this empirical and unstable kind, and their relative value can be measured only by comparing them with the permanent definitions of the m arga theory, which alone is based on absolute laws. “The music that is called gandharva (m arga) is that which has been from time immemorial practiced by the gandharvas (celestial singers) and which leads surely to moksba (liberation), while the gana (desi) music is that which has been invented by composers (vaggeyakaras), in conformity with recognized rules, and which pleases people. Gandharva music always follows the rules of theory.”1 “Music is of two kinds, m arga and desi. The kind that was sought by Brahma and other gods, and practiced by Bharata and other sages in the presence of Sambhu (Siva), is called m arga; it brings everlasting prosperity, while the songs, play, and dances that please the hearts of people in different countries are called desi (regional).”2
M odal S ystem and H arm onic S ystem
Before starting the study of Indian music, and in order to be able to understand its meaning, we should fully realize the difference between modal and harmonic music. We should also give up the prejudice that sees in the harmonic form a



development or “progression” from the modal form, with the accompanying notion that “progression” implies “progress.” There is only a difference in the form of expression, which does not imply any superiority either in conception or in scope. In the words of Raja S. M . Tagore, “There is nothing to make us regret that the principles of acoustics, as they exhibit themselves in our music, differ from the European system.”3 W e must remember that, just as Indian musicians may see in harmony only a meaningless noise, Europeans are perhaps similarly incapable of appreciating the significance of an isolated modal degree. T hey cannot realize how an isolated note can convey the full meaning of a chord, because of its position in regard to the memorized tonic and sometimes to another axial note. Still, by the work of memory, a single note really does form a chord or relation of sounds. According to Vedantists, “a single sound is not capable of manifesting a meaning (sphota), otherwise to utter another sound would be useless . . . but, each sound leaving an impression (samskara) in the mind, it is by the cumulative operation' of the previous sounds (dhvani) that the last sound reveals the idea.”4 Westerners, although they are bound to acknowledge this process in spo ken language, are not trained to perceive it in musical language, and they rec ognize the meaning only if the few sounds that represent the idea are heard simultaneously. An exception can be made for the arpeggio, which can theoreti cally be understood in both systems. There is no essential difference between successive and simultaneous sounds, provided the ratios that bind them are the same. The image appears suddenly to our mind as soon as the different ele ments that constitute it have been perceived. It is the relation of sounds that represents the idea, and as long as this relation remains incomplete, the idea cannot appear, “the partial manifestation of a concept being impossible because a concept has no parts. ”s The harmonic system, in which the group of related sounds is given at once, is in a way more direct, but it is also less clear, because an accurate dis crimination of the different elements that constitute a chord is not usually pos sible. Modal development, on the other hand, allows the exact perception and immediate classification of every one of the sound elements. T he modal system therefore permits a much more accurate, powerful, and detailed outlining of what the music expresses. This is why the modal system is always to be given preference when music is envisaged not merely as a stimulant for sensations but also as a means of education capable of creating profound and durable impressions in the mind. This is easily explainable: an external perception can produce a permanent impression in our mind (n hayi bbava) only if we concentrate on it for a suffi ciently long time. Only modal music can create such permanent impressions, because all its variations only tend toward the expression of one accurately



determined feeling or image. This cannot fail, after a sufficient time, to imprint that feeling or that image in the mind of all those who hear the mode, whether they are attentive or not. In Western music, all the notes have an approximately equivalent value because each note can be the root, fifth, or third of a chord. T he significance of the notes as modal degrees is consequently virtually nil, and in any case extremely weak. In modal music, however, where modulation is virtually un known, the idea of a third will always be represented by the third degree, the idea of a fifth by the fifth degree, and so on. The result of this difference is that in modal music the modal degree will have the significance that is attached to the corresponding interval in harmonic music, degree and interval being the elements that in each case represent a permanent numerical relation. And we shall see that the Indians attribute to the modal degree almost exactly the same emotional and suggestive characteristics that Westerners attribute to the corresponding harmonic interval. T he ancient Indians were aware of the equivalence of the two systems, and treatises insist that the same thing can be expressed by the succession of notes in a wellestablished mode or by the harmony of simultaneous sounds, the cosmic and emotional correspondences being the same in both cases.
T he P rob Lem. o f th e D ivision o f S ou n d
W hile the divisions of light (blue, red, yellow, etc.) or the divisions of taste (sweet, bitter, salty, etc.) seem to us obvious, the divisions of sound are the subject of constant controversy. Yet sounds, like the other phenomena by which we perceive the elements, are related by fixed laws, and their relations evoke in our mind precise images. W hy then do we experience more difficulty in fixing the divisions of sound than we do the divisions of light? Westerners generally deny that there is a division of sounds in perfect accord with the rules of musical expression, as well as with the laws of acoustics, and they hide their ignorance behind the impressive word psychology. But this leads nowhere and flagrantly contradicts experience. A minor chord will never have for anybody the mood of a major one. If musical mood changes, it is only because the ratios between sounds change, and it is only the extraordinary ignorance of Western musicians as to the intervals that they are actually using which allows them to believe that they can give to a certain note a more or less expressive value by some myste rious transfusion of their “personality” without changing its pitch. T he situation is further complicated by the use of instruments tuned to a tempered scale in which all the intervals are wrong in relation to the logical scale of sounds. This fact leaves room for doubts in interpretation, which performers and listeners may to a certain extent exploit according to their own tendencies—doubts that are impossible if the intervals are accurate. On tempered instruments such as



the piano, to be able to give to any note a definite feeling or mood, it is neces sary for the structure of the chords to compel us to interpret that note in a particular way, and this necessitates a mass of chords whose only role is to color the otherwise insipid notes of the tempered scale. Modem music is overcrowded by such chords, among which those chords that have a truly harmonic expres sion, meaning, or message seem lost.
The T heory o f E lem ents
Indian metaphysics explains why it is difficult for us to perceive the natural divisions of sound and indicates the method by which we can realize them. The world is composed of five elements,6which we perceive separately by five distinct senses. The sense corresponding to each of these elements can also perceive the lower elements but not the higher ones. Thus earth, whose corre sponding sense is smell, can be perceived by all senses; water, which corresponds to the sense of taste, is perceived by all the senses except smell; fire (identified with light) corresponds to sight and cannot be tasted or smelled; air, which corresponds to touch, is no longer visible; and finally, ether can be perceived only through sound. Being unable to verify our hearing perceptions with the help of any other sense, it is impossible for us to justify the divisions of sound as we perceive them, because we can have no direct element of comparison. Sound being a quality of ether, we can visualize it only through its reaction upon other elements, such as air, for example, of which the sensible quality is touch. W e therefore easily represent sound as a vibration of air that, touching our ear, forces it to vibrate—a fact that is actually only a secondary phenomenon.7 The grammarians (Panini, Patanjali) consider that air is the covering that prevents sounds, the vibration of ether, from being perceptible. Motionless air is opaque to sounds, and only when the air is made to vibrate does it allow the sound to pass, or temporarily become the vehicle of sounds. M odem physicists observe that the speed of the sound wave, already lower in air than in most liquids and solids, becomes slower and slower as the tem perature of the air drops, that is to say, when the speed of the molecules de creases. This may well bring us to the conclusion that at absolute zero, the interstellar absolute cold, the speed of the sound wave in still air would be nil.
The ear cannot perceive air [which is perceived by the sense of touch], therefore the Mrnmmsakas (the exponents of mtrmmsa, the philosophical system ofJaimini) consider that air waves [literally, alternations of pressure and decompression], and consequently sounds, are not perceived by the ear as an air vibration. . . . Sound alone [devoid of all intellectual bearing] cannot be perceived. It is only the materialized idea (spbota) in the shape of sound (dhvani) that is perceived... . Words have a meaning and a sound,



the sound being only the external characteristic through which the mean ing is grasped. Still air is opaque to the perception of ideas (pphota).* When that opacity is removed [that is, when the air, being made to vibrate, becomes the vehicle of ideas], then it is said that sound (dhvani), which is the vehicle of the idea (sphota), should be considered only as a quality of the idea, that is, as an accessory phenomenon.9
Sound an d Vibration
Hearing, as the sense corresponding to ether, is at the limit of our perceptions. Thus the natural and real divisions of sound are only experimentally demon strable for us with the greatest of difficulty, unlike those of visible light, for example. This is why “rational” minds, who admit only that which is physically evident, have a tendency to suppose that the divisions of sound are arbitrary, while they would never say this about the colors of the spectrum. But such an attitude, which modern people believe to be rational, leads them to a conception that is materially inaccurate, since all peoples of all times will always fall back into the same divisions of the scale of sounds because those divisions are in accordance with reality. Differences exist only on paper and are due in the main to the ignorance of most musicians about the exact nature of the intervals they actually use. The much greater knowledge that the Indians had of the continu ity of perceptible and nonperceptible planes has allowed them, by analogy, to define the divisions of sound with the most rational and scientific precision, while modern science proposes only arbitrary and illogical divisions because it does not go beyond the accessory phenomenon of gross vibration. This phe nomenon, being itself only an effect, can neither prove nor show anything. The modem approach renders every observation confusing and will never allow the establishment of a logical theory of sounds in accordance with musical reality. This will be easily understood by musicians who have reached the dead end that is formed by the representation of sounds by their frequencies, a rep resentation that, although theoretically simple and accurate, places an insur mountable barrier of complication and inaccuracy in the way of any analysis of musical relations and “mystifies the subject by enveloping it in a cloud of mathematicism.”10 The ratio of two sounds is of a different nature and only incidentally refers to their frequencies. The same ratio expresses the relative rank of the sounds in the scale of harmonics; 25/24, for example, is the interval between the twentyfourth and the twenty-fifth harmonics. Inverted, it also represents the length ratio of pipes or strings used to produce the notes. These ratios are therefore the expression of general laws of sound that are applicable to the frequency of vibrations, but not exclusively so.



The N ine Svaras
T he Indians consider the scale as made of seven principal notes, or svaras, connected with the seven main planets, and two secondary notes, corresponding to the nodes of the moon. This brings the total number of moving notes of the scale to nine, which are related to the nine groups of consonants of the Sanskrit alphabet.11These sounds place themselves, according to modes, into the twelve regions of the octave, just as the nine groups of consonants associate themselves with the twelve vowels, or the planets with the twelve signs of the zodiac. The seven principal notes, or svaras, are called: Shadja (bom of six), Rishabha (bull), Gandhara (pleasing to celestial beings), Madhyama (middle sound), Panchama (fifth note), Dhaivata (deceitful), and Nishada (seated). In practice they are called more briefly: Sa, Re, Ga, M a, Pa, Dha, N i.12 The two accessory svaras are named antara-Ga (intermediate Ga), and kakall-Ni (pleasing Ni). In the nomenclature of the Yajurveda the notes are called udatta (raised), anudatta (not raised), and svarita (accented). Svarita notes correspond to what Aristotle later called the “body of harmony”; they are the fixed notes that de termine the upper and lower limits of the groups of four notes known as tetrachords. Of the two remaining notes within each tetrachord, the higher note is called udatta (raised), and the lower one anudatta (not raised). According to the Narada-siksba, one of the most ancient texts on music, “Nishada and Gandhara are bom of udatta-, Rishabha and Dhaivata are bom of anudatta-, and Shadja, Madhyama, and Panchama are bom of svarita." The scale is thus divided into two tetrachords as follows:
Purvanga (lower tetrachord) Uttardnga (upper tetrachord)
Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni Sa svarita anudatta udatta svarita svarita anudatta udatta svarita CDEF G A B C
In the classification of the Samaveda the notes are simply numbered, start ing from Madhyama, which is called Prathama (first). The seven notes are thus:
Prathama (first) Ma F Dvitlya (second ) Ga E Tritlya (third) Re D Chaturtha (fourth) Sa C Panchama (fifth) Dha A Atisvara (extreme note) Ni B Krishta (pulled, dragged) Pa G



According to the Ndrada-sikshd, “The svara (note) that is Prathama (first) in the singing of Sdma(veda) is the Madhyama of the flute, Dvitfya is Gandhara, Tritlya is Rishabha, Chaturtha is Shadja, Panchama is Dhaivata, Atisvara is Nishada, Krishta is Panchama.” We can see, therefore, that the scale of Sdm aveda is a descending scale with five principal notes and two secondary ones, while the later scale of profane music, given here as that of the flute, is a full seven-note ascending scale. W e shall again meet the peculiar inversion of the Atisvara and Panchama of the Vedic scale when we study the Pythagorean theory.
The Tonic a n d the Gramas
The lowest note of the scale, which should be considered only as the auxiliary tonic, is the only tonic used in modern times. But in ancient books, the general tonic is always given as the fourth note, Madhyama (middle sound), which corresponds to the mesa of the Greeks. The tonic is the only note that cannot be modified or suppressed. There fore “the destruction of Madhyama should never be performed; Madhyama is the best of all svaras and everlasting in the opinion ofthe sages who sing Sdmaveda.”n Madhyama is an appropriate name for the general tonic because, accord ing to the definitions of Vedanta, this name is given to “the fundamental per ceptible sound from which all the differentiations of sound arise.”14 In reality, the note taken as the starting point in the sequence of svaras varies according to our approach. If we deal only with terrestrial (adhibhautika) music, the scale should begin from Sa (C), the first note. This is called Shadja gram a (scale of C). In the words of Ramamatya, “All the d e si rdgas are those of Shadja gram a ”'5 But if we deal with celestial (ddhidaivika) music, the scale be gins from Ga. This is called Gandhara grd m a (scale of E). From the metaphysi cal (adhyatmika) point of view, the scale begins from Ma. This is the M adhyam a gram a (scale of F). To understand this differentiation, we may remember that in a similar way the sequences of seasons, according to A. K. Coomaraswamy, “correspond to spring, summer, autumn, winter inpratyaksha, adhyatma sequence, or autumn, winter, spring, and summer in paroksha, ddhidaivata [angelic] se quence: similarly, to infancy, youth, maturity, and age in our corporeal parlance, that is, to maturity, age, youth, and infancy, spiritually.”1'’ The difference between the Sa and M a gram as is similar to the difference in Greek music between the two forms of the Dorian mode. In the first Dorian (Sa grdm a) the fundamental is at the same time tonic and final, but in the second Dorian (Ma grdm a), the modal fifth has for its fundamental the m esa (Ma), which thus becomes pseudo-tonic and fundamental, but without completely ousting the Sa, which remains final and becomes pseudo-dominant.



T he D iaton ic S eries a n d the C om m a Diesis
T he shifting of the tonic from M a (F) to Sa (C) is not an arbitrary operation, but corresponds to a peculiarity in the structure of the harmonic scale of sounds, similar to the Pythagorean comma in the cycle of fifths. The diatonic scale is composed of three different kinds of interval—major tone, minor tone, and major half tone—which can be considered as forming an indefinite cyclic series of seven joint tetrachords of varying composition, as shown in figure 10. Apart from tetrachord II, which contains three full tones (tritone), all the other tetrachords form a perfect fourth (major tone + minor tone +major half tone = 4/3), except for tetrachord V, which is too big by one comma (2 major tones + major half tone = 27/20 = 4/3 x 81/80). If we raise the A (Dha) by one comma to give A+ (Dha+), in order to make tetrachord V into a perfect fourth from A+ (Dha+) to D (Re), then tetrachord IV, from E (Ga) to A+ (Dha+), becomes too big. It is this particularity that is used by the Natya-sdstra to define the sru ti as equal to one comma diesis (81/80—the difference between the major and the minor tone) from A (Dha) to A+ (Dha+) (ancient P a- to Pa).17 No greater accuracy in definition could be found because the perfect fourth (or its inversion, the perfect fifth) is an interval that cannot stand inaccuracy. If we tune two instruments according to the detailed instructions of Bharata, we obtain an interval of one comma extremely accurately and without any difficult measur ing. Later on, we shall see this method in detail. This shows, incidentally, that modern authors who pretend that the microtonal intervals (snitis) are not clearly defined in Sanskrit treatises, and who interpret them according to the fancies of their own imagination, either have not read or have not understood the Natyasdstra, or are not aware of the most elementary particularities of the diatonic scale. Thus we read remarks such as those of N. A. W illard to the effect that “several Sanskrit treatises are in existence, but they are so obscure that little benefit is to be expected from them to the science.”18W illard, however, did not know Sanskrit.
The Tonic an d the C osm ic C ycles
Quite independently of the differentiation of the gram as—that is, of whether the first or the fourth note is taken as the tonic of each scale—the first note of the diatonic series itself varies through history. Thus all the notes of the diatonic scale are successively considered as the first note, that is, as Sa (C). The scale given by the Natya-sastra is, according to modern terminology, the scale of D (Re) in the diatonic series; it therefore necessarily belongs to a later period than the Greek scale, because the note that appears to be the logical tonic goes lower and lower as the cycle develops.

W hen we speak here of the tonic becoming progressively lower, we are not speaking of its absolute frequency, or of the phenomenon of changing standard pitch (although this too is far from being unimportant), but of the note chosen as general tonic in the unlimited diatonic scale. This note has been successively called, in modern terminology, E, D, and C (Ga, Re, and Sa; see ex. 3). The scale considered today as having no altered notes (.rnddha) is the scale of C (Sa), which is the tonic of this particular time. In this modem scale, the Greeks would have called E (Ga) the fundamental. The ancient Egyptians would have given this name to F (Ma), while future generations will give it to B (Ni). But this does not in any way affect the modes, as every note of the scale can be taken as a modal tonic; it only indicates the predominance of certain modes at certain times, in particular the major mode (which corresponds to rdga Bilaval) today, the mode of Re (rd ga K d fi; see ex. 4) in the Middle Ages, and the Dorian mode or mode of Ga (rdga Bhairavt; see ex. 5), in Greco-Roman times.

If we consider the diatonic scale, given by the white keys of the piano or organ, the note that medieval authors would have called the tonic is the note that we today call D (Re), because they considered as unaltered (hiddhd) the scale that has a minor third and a minor seventh (K dft that), while today we recognize only the major mode (Bildval that) as the unaltered scale.
The Two D iatonic Scaled
As we have seen, it is the adjustment of A (Dha) that differentiates the two forms of the diatonic scale. In the first form, the second tetrachord has intervals as follows:



Uttaranga (upper tetrachord)
Ma Pa Dha+ Ni Sa F G A+ B C major tone major tone minor tone half tone srutis19 4 4 3 2
This is called Sa gram a, the scale of the tonic. It is, in modem notation, the mode of D (Re) because the fifth D A+ (Re Dha+) is pure, which is indispensable if Re is tonic. The other scale presents the following succession:
Uttaranga (upper tetrachord)
Ma Pa Dha Ni Sa F G A BC major tone minor tone major tone half tone srutis 4 3 4 2
This is the (theoretical) modem Western major scale. It is called the scale of the fourth (Ma grdm a) because its real tonic is G (Pa), which is the fourth of the scale of D (Re), the fundamental scale of Bharata. The D (Re) could not be fundamental in this scale because its fifth would not be pure; the interval D to A (Re to Dha) equals 40/27. “There are two gram as, that of Sa [Re (D)] and that of M a [Pa (G)], con taining 22 srutis. In the Sa grdm a they appear in the order 3, 2, 4, 4, 3, 2, 4.”20 That is:
srutv: | 3 | 2 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 4 |
DEFGA+BCD I I I i I ill Re Ga Ma Pa Dha+ Ni Sa Re
“In the M a grd'ma, the Panchama [Dha+ (A+)] must be lowered by one m iti. The difference of Panchama is the very measure of srutis [which can be described as a difference of] softness or accentuation, of expression or of length.”21 Thus the srutis of M a gram a, starting from Sa (ancient Sa = Re [D]) are:
srutis | 3 | 2 4 | 3 | 4 | 2 | 4 |
D E F G A BCD
I I i i i ill
Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni Sa Re



The Ga Grama
In ancient times there was another, nondiatonic scale, based on a different principle, in which all the intervals except one were equal to three srutis. But this scale, the Ga gram a (scale of the third), whose tonic was the modern note F (Ma), being the representation of celestial spheres, is in our corrupted times hidden from the eyes of ordinary mortals. There are some grounds to believe that it corresponds to a division of the scale of sounds according to numerical properties that in geometry are peculiar to the pentagon. The third, as we shall see later, is particularly connected with the number five. This division would also have been known to Pythagoreans, as is shown by the term apotome used for its characteristic interval, a term that for the Pythagoreans had a very particular significance in relation to the golden section and the pentagon. Euclid uses the same term to represent the irrational segment separating a regular and a pro portional division of a straight line.22,

If we take successively as the practical tonic the seven principal notes23 of this scale, we shall obtain seven different plagal scales, or murchanas, which by eliminating some of their notes will be used for the establishment of expressive modes, or ragas, of nine, eight, seven, six, or five notes. Most of the musical modes come within this classification. The m urchanas that contain only the seven principal notes are called suddha, or pure murchanas. Those that make use of antara-G a (Ma tivra [Fi]), and thus have eight notes, are called suddha-antara murchanas. The murchanas of eight notes that use only kakali-Ni (Re komal [D|,]) are called suddha-kdkali murchanas. If antara-G a and kakalt-Ni are both used, we have the hiddha-kakaliantara m urchanas of nine notes.24
In this way we obtain, in bothgramas-.



14 suddba m urchanas of seven notes
16 suddha-kakall m urchanas of eight notes
16 suddha-antara m urchanas of eight notes
18 suddha-kakalt-antara m urchanas of nine notes
totaling sixty-four m urchanas on which most of the modes (ragas) are based. Not all these m urchanas are usable, nor are they all used in practice in modern music. Those most used are numbers 1, 2, 5, 6, 10, 12, and 14 of example 7—that is, generally, those in which the fifth and the fourth are perfect, though some have a large fourth (Ma+ [F+]). W hen comparing this classifica tion with that of the Greeks, we shall see that if only the seven principal notes are used, the modes or ragas can be called diatonic, while the introduction of the two accessory sounds allows the construction of chromatic scales.

Among these scales we can note that the modem Western major mode corresponds to the M a rgi m urchana of M a gram a and not to the Rajarii murchana of Sa gram a, which contains A+ (Dha+).



When Sivendranatha, in his Raga-vibodha, says for example that the P auravi and Uttardyata m urchanas begin from Dha (A), he takes as a general tonic the medieval one, Re (D). This means that the pure (unaltered) scale is considered to be that of K dfi, which contains, in relation to the tonic C (Sa), a flat E (Ga) and a flat B (Ni). We have chosen here to keep the modem unaltered scale, Bildval, the major mode, as the pure scale. Therefore, the same P auravi and Uttardyata begin for us with a B (Ni). This does not in any way alter the order of the notes in these murchanas. T he difference is merely one of conventional notation. The scales made on the basis of tetrachords, which are directly obtained on the vlna and other stringed instruments, can be added to the m urchana scales. Such scales generally have two identical tetrachords. Other scales are obtained by changing the sruti of the tonic; a certain number of them are described in the SangJta-ratnakara.2S
Chrom atic and E nharm onic
If, leaving aside the details of tuning, we assemble the notes of the different murchanas, we get a chromatic scale that corresponds to the Western form of the scale (see example 8).

But if we are careful about precise tuning, we find that to transpose all the murchanas to the same pitch we require two distinct positions for each note, separated by an interval of one comma,1giving the enharmonic scale:
L- L+ L I
C Dj, Dl, D— D Ej, El, E E+ F F+

This series can be represented in Western notation as in example 9.
Example 9.
If we exclude from this series G+ (Pa+, A[,[,), because the fifth is invariable, we obtain a scale of twenty-two sounds, the srutis, grouped in pairs, each pair forming an interval of one comma. According to Bharata,26 the method em



ployed to obtain this scale consists in tuning two identical instruments (vinos) in the Sa gram a. Then, by adapting one of them to the M a gram a with the help of the difference between the perfect fourths E A (Ga Dha) and A+ D (Dha+ Re), as previously explained, the A+ (Dha+) is lowered by one comma to A (Dha). If we then keep this new A (Dha) as a fixed sound and retune the instru ment in the Sa gram a, all the notes of this instrument will be one comma lower than those of the first instrument. The combined notes of the two instruments then give the scale of twenty-two srutis. This scale is identical to the one described by Arab mathematicians as that of the ancient Greeks, and it still remains the division used by the Arabs them selves. The major tone is thus divided into minor tone, apotome (or major half tone), and limma:
C D|, Dt D - D (Sa) (ReL-) (ReL+) (Re-) (Re)
------lim m a -------- 1 ---------------------------- apotome------------------------------------------------------ minor tone ----------------------------------------------------------------------major tone
These twenty-two positions of the notes, or srutis, are said to correspond to definite and distinct feelings. According to certain authors they can be further divided into sixty-six positions, so as to allow perfect consonance in every in stance. But this is only a question of more or less perfect tuning, and the number of possible distinct feelings remains limited to twenty-two. This division of the octave into twenty-two intervals has been considered arbitrary by modern Sanskritists and musicologists, who have written the most amusing abuses against it. Yet such a division is not only logical but essential. It is in reality used in every country and is valid for all music, from the point of view of acoustics as well as that of mathematics or metaphysics, and even from the point of view of musical expression, as we shall shortly see.

A cou stic D efin ition o f th e D ivision tf/*Srutis
After the elementary division of the octave into twelve half tones, which can be called the division of the first order, all acoustically acceptable divisions of the octave must necessarily take into account the difference between twelve fifths and seven octaves. This is called the Pythagorean comma, and is approximately equal to a fifty-third of an octave. Its harmonic equivalent, the comma diesis, is the difference between the major and minor tones. The simplest divisions are those that take the comma as a unit and can be called the divisions of the second order. The first division of the second order is obviously the complete division into fifty-three intervals. But in this division, if we keep only the most important



values for each of the twelve notes, removing, twelve by twelve, those values that are less employed in practice, the fifty-three original notes are successively reduced to forty-one, then twenty-nine, and finally seventeen, which is the minimum division of the second order and is the basic division used by the Arabs. But the fifty-third fifth, as we already saw in connection with Chinese music, again goes beyond the octave by a fraction smaller than the comma. If we take as a unit this fraction of a comma, we obtain the divisions of the third order. This complete system divides the octave into 358 intervals, which through elimination of the less important fifths, twelve by twelve, can be reduced to the minimum division of the third order, which is of twenty-two intervals. This is the division adopted by the Indians, for metaphysical as well as musical reasons. As we have seen, the Chinese division stands in between, as it uses the division of the second order up to its maximum (fifty-three fifths) and then, up to the sixtieth fifth, uses intervals of the third order. These divisions can be pursued indefinitely into divisions of the fourth, fifth, 72th order. But the Indians, although they showed by this division the extent of their knowledge of acoustics and mathematics, have been able to avoid abstract speculation and to stop at the intermediate division of twenty-two srutis-, this division alone is in perfect agreement with musical practice, since any fur ther division would go beyond that which, in terms of sounds, is equivalent to the third dimension, and being therefore beyond the limits of this universe, could be of no interest as regards musical practice.

From the point of view of numbers, the division of the modal octave must necessarily be of twenty-two intervals. This division is not peculiar to music, but represents a universal law. Indeed, the relation of those twenty-two intervals with the seven notes of the scale is the only one that can give to music a complete and logical substructure. Rene Guenon explains:
The number twenty-two is related to seven by the ratio 22/7, which is the approximate expression of the relation between the circle and its diameter, so these two numbers together represent the circle, which is considered as the most perfect shape by Dante as well as by the Pythagoreans (each division of each of the three worlds has this circular form). Besides, in twenty-two are united the symbols of two of the “elementary movements” of Aristotelian physics: the heal movement, represented by two, and that of alteration, represented by twenty, as Dante himself explains in his Cornvito.11



The symbolic correspondences of the number seven and the number twentytwo are so numerous that it is not possible to attempt to study them here. We shall simply note that, in accordance with this symbolism, the vm a, the sacred instrument of Indian music, is made of two spheres joined together by a straight axis on which seven strings are played over twenty-two frets; the Hebrew alpha bet, whose role is so important in the Qabalah, has twenty-two letters and seven double letters; seven planets determine, by their orbits around the sun, the limits of the visible world, while twenty-two cosmic circles separate us from the metaphysical sun, the central eye that sees everything—circles that we shall have to cross before we can reach the final absorption into absolute knowledge. The Arabic division of the octave into seventeen intervals is also based on considerations of symbolism connected with Muslim esotericism. This by no means excludes their physical reality. That the Arabs divide the octave into sev enteen intervals does not imply that those intervals are bigger than the srutis, as many Westerners have lightly considered. Those divisions refer necessarily to identical notes, in conformity with the needs of musical expression, because they are the representation of metaphysical realities corresponding to the very nature of sounds as well as of all other aspects of the three worlds. The seven teen notes of the Arabic octave can be identified with seventeen of the srutis. The srutis left out are those which are least employed, since, following the de terioration of the cycle, the scale of C (Sa gram a) is the only one employed in modal music. In the ancient law, Hebraic or Hindu, the numbers and srutis of the lost gram as (scales) are piously kept, but in the new law (Islam), they are left out of the general theory because they are so rarely used. This is what al-Farabl explained: “the two cycles that we have established each contain twenty-two degrees; these are the totality of the notes that are used on the lute, some fre quently, others more rarely. We shall deal only with the notes that are ordinarily used and that consequently are the more natural.”2" Elsewhere, speaking of the tuning of the Hurasan’s tunbur, he says: “the scale of this instrument contains, in this tuning, thirty-two degrees, the doubled notes being ten in number.”29 The number seventeen, which was considered inauspicious in ancient times in both the West and the East, has on the contrary sometimes been taken as representative of the new gospel, Christian or Islamic. “T he number seventeen can be divided in two ways: into ten and seven to represent the fusion of the ancient law and the new law (the law of fear is represented by the number ten, and the law of love by the number seven, says Saint Augustine); it can also be divided into eight and nine, and therefore sig nifies the union of angels and men.”30 “One finds in the number seventeen . . . a wonderful mystery. It is not without reason that Psalm 17 is the only one to be found in the book of Kings, because it has for its subject the glory of the eternal kingdom in which we shall have no more enemies.”31



On the other hand, Plutarch says: “the Pythagoreans . . . have for the number seventeen an absolute and sacred repulsion. This is in relation to the
teen, which are the only plane numbers whose perimeters happen to be equal to their areas, comes the number seventeen, which interferes between these two numbers, separates them from each other, and divides their ratio, 1'/», into two unequal parts [9/8 = 18/17 x 17/16].”32 According to Hindu Sankhya philosophy, the number seventeen represents the subde body (sukshma sarira), which is composed of the five principles of the elements (tanmatras), the five senses of perception (jndnendriyas), the five organs of action (karmendriyas), intellect (bnddbi, in which ahamkara, the notion of individual “ego,” is included), and mind (imanas): 5 + 5 + 5 + 2 = 17. This subtle body remains in existence through all the forms of posthumous life, and is destroyed only at the time of final liberation (moksha), which means complete reabsorption into the First Principle (Brahman). The metaphysical doctrine (Pythagorean and Vedantic) considers the subtle body as mortal and even takes it as the fearful symbol of ultimate death, whereas the religious doctrines, to which Christianity and Islam belong, and which do not envisage the final stage of liberation (moksha) but take heaven (svarga) to be the ultimate end, consider the subtle body, which is then called the soul, as immortal. The number seven teen therefore becomes the glorious symbol of immortality. The seventeen divisions of the octave are given by the Arab writers as shown in example 10.33
Example 10.
But in the tuning of instruments, particularly the tim bur of Harasan, the second string, using the same frets and tuned either on the second, D (Re); the minor third, Ej, (Ga[,); the fourth, F (Ma); the fifth, G (Pa); or the sixth, A+ (Dha+), according to mode required, gives all the missing notes to form the complete scale (ex. 11).
Example 11.
If we leave aside the modified fifth and octave, which are never used, this brings us back exactly to the Indian division. We see therefore that, although the Arabs use only limmas and commas to establish their scale, they supplement the lack of the second form of certain flats

a somewhat different classification, it does not in practice create any difference from the Indian division.

M udical D efinition o f the Srutis
Musical intervals can be accurately defined in two ways, either by numbers (string lengths, frequencies, etc.) or, with no less accuracy, by their psychologi cal correspondences, such as the feelings and images they necessarily evoke in our minds. There is no sound without a meaning, assert the Vedantists. In the guise of sounds, it is only the manifested idea that we perceive, and it is there fore logical to conceive a theory of sounds based on the ideas represented by the sounds rather than on their numerical values. “We hold that it is quite possible to build a rational theory of music without the help of numbers,” says Raja S. M. Tagore.34 In spite of the extreme confusion resulting from the use of equal tempera ment, Westerners still appreciate, in singing, the difference between a brilliant timbre and a somber timbre given to what is apparently the same note. This difference corresponds in reality to a difference of pitch generally equal to one comma, a difference similar to that between the major and the minor tones. This means that, although our spoiled ears can no longer appreciate the differ ence in the pitch of the sound, we remain able to define a difference of interval by a difference of color or feeling, or by emotional correspondences. Although the srutis are defined in terms of lengths of strings in the Natyasdstra and particularly in the Sanglta-parijdta of Ahobala, Indian theorists gen erally prefer to define intervals by their feeling rather than by numbers. They consider this system to be quite as accurate and more practical because, without any mechanical verification, it allows the gifted musician, who alone is expected to take interest in music theory, to know immediately the accurate interval from the feelings it evokes. For example, if, hearing continuously the tonic C (Sa), we try to sing or play the major third E (Ga) with a peaceful and loving feeling, we shall obtain the harmonic third, E (Ga) = 5/4, corresponding to the sruti Ratikd. But if our feelings had been of energy, wonder or heroism, we would inevitably have sung the third of the scale of fifths, the ditone E+ (Ga+) = 81/64, corresponding to the sruti R audn.is
Similarly, the minor third Et (Ga komal) or the minor seventh B i,(Ni komal), when corresponding to a sentiment of pity, koruna rasa, will be respectively E|, (GaL) = 32/27 and B|, (NiL+) = 16/9 (D ayavati and M adantl srutis), while the same two intervals, when corresponding to the sentiment of \ovt (sringdra rasa) or of amu sement (hasya rasa) are respectively Et (Gat) = 6/5 and Bj, (Ni) =9/5 (Ranjani and RohinI srutis).
The natural A (Dha) of the harmonic scale, A (Dha) = 5/3 = 222 savarts,



is peaceful and happy (Sandtpant sruti), but the A+ (Dha+) of the scale of fifths, A+ (Dha+) = 16/27 = 227 savarts, is immodest and irritating (Alapint sruti), and so on. The feeling of the srutis depends exclusively on their position in relation to the tonic. An augmented sixth (Dha dvra) or a diminished seventh (Ni komal), for example, have, if they belong to the same sruti, the same feeling. T he ancient Sanskrit names of the srutis allow one easily to remember their meaning, and consequendy to sing or to play them accurately. Figure 11 gives a list of the srutis according to the system of Sarngadeva.36
*
F urther Subdivisions o f the Srutis
The srutis are represented in practice by their characteristic notes, but they are, theoretically, regions of the octave. W ithin the limits of each sruti several po sitions may be possible, allowing an adjustment of the tuning of the notes according to the mode or rdga being played or sung. As long as the notes do not trespass beyond the limits of the sruti, their mood keeps the same characteris tics. This mood will be clearer and stronger if, within those limits, that note is used which forms the most rational and simple ratio with the tonic. This leads to the use, within the twenty-two srutis, of the fifty-three (and sometimes sixtysix) divisions of the octave, which allow the necessary adjustments of tuning according to the mode or the rdga. The limits of the srutis are stricdy determinate, a fact that has induced the Indian physicists to differentiate carefully between the limma (256/243 = 22.63 savarts) and its complement within the minor tone (135/128 = 23.12 savarts; 256/243 x 135/128 = 10/9). Those two intervals, although almost equal, repre sent respectively one sruti and two srutis according to a rule stated in Sanskrit treatises.37 For example, the four srutis <of the major tone can be divided as follows:
A A+ B|, B|, B (Dha) (Dha+) (NiL-) (NiL+) (Ni)
81/80 x 25/24 81/80 256/243 135/128
2 srutis 1 sruti 1 sruti
M isinterpretations o f the Srutis
The “enharmonic” division of the octave into twenty-four quarter tones by the ancient Greeks as well as by Southern Indians seems to be the result either of the addition of two theoretical intervals, the modified fifth and octave (which are never employed and would not bring out a distinct feeling), or of a confu

sion in traditional data. The double octave was the range that was necessary in ancient Indian and Greek music, as it still is in Arab and Turkish music today, to define the mode. This double octave was divided into twenty-four (twice twelve) regions assimilated to the signs of the zodiac, among which the seven notes move like the seven planets. The sruti is not a tem pered interval. Not all srutis are equal, but their division suffices to allow the classification of all the notes that have a distinct significance and that are used in the definition of ragas—in fact, of all possible musical modes. In reality, the division into twenty-two is the minimum division that allows a clear definition of the expressive characteristics of intervals. The division of the tone into several intervals is necessary for accurate playing, and although it is easy for a well-trained ear to discern whether an interval is accurate, it is extremely difficult if not impossible to find out, without special instruments, in what proportion an interval is bigger or smaller than another. This difficulty is why Greek musicians, appreciating intervals by ear and noticing that they were using two or three intermediate positions in the tone, may have considered them, as the Indians did, to be approximately equal in practice.’8 Such an attitude is quite understandable, but to take this approxi mation for a mathematical reality and make complicated calculations and lengthy theories on this basis, and then to come to the conclusion that the ancient Greeks and Indians were enjoying peculiar intervals that have no appeal for other ears, is an absurdity. Like every practical division of the octave, the divi sion of the srutis is theoretically insufficient, but to believe it to be a tempered division is to lower the scientific knowledge of the Indians to the level of mod ern musical practice; it is also in absolute contradiction to the Sanskrit treatises. Therefore when J. Grosset, like many others, takes the sruti'! to be equal divi sions in his article in the Encyclopedic de la musique et dictionnaire du C onservatoire, and compares them with the Western tempered scale, enlisting for this purpose the help of a “professor of mathematics” and of endless logarithms, he may be performing prodigious mathematical exercises, but they have no connection whatsoever with the theory or the practice of the srutis. The term sruti, like the Greek quarter tone, refers to the displacement of a note by an interval smaller than a half tone in order to obtain a harmonically accurate interval. This has nothing to do with an equal temperament either by half tones or quarter tones, and such calculations as I have used above bear no relation to this. The school of Aristoxenes in the fourth century divided the tone into four “rigorously equal” quarter tones, but in reality this division was not considered as exact because Aristoxenes did admit in practice a certain “freedom of variation of the intervals,” a certain “latitude” for each note.39 This clearly annihilates the rigor of the definition and shows that this is in reality a simplified and approximate division, which replaces an accurate division as far as it can but



in no way allows any precise calculations or observations to be made on its basis. The importance of the comma, equal to 81/80 or 5 savarts, which is the difference between the major and minor tones, is such that it can easily seem to be equivalent to the minor half tone, 25/24 or 18 savarts. This has been noted by E. Clements in his Introduction to the Study o f Indian M usic: “The ancients held the erroneous opinion that these intervals (srutis) were equal. T heir system was, however, a convenient one for distinguishing between the major tone (four srutis), the minor tone (three srutis) and the semitone (two srutis). By an interval of ‘one s r u tf they understood the comma 81/80.”40Though oversimplified and patently biased, this view is not inaccurate. Raouf Yekta Bey, in his study on Turkish music, writes:
Oriental instrumentalists, who care only for the practice of their music, having noted that the interval of a major tone contains three notes and that the major tone is thus divided into four parts, have given the name of quarto- tone to each one of these four parts. Europeans, who have heard this expression, have understood that Orientals divide the tone into four equal parts. But no Arab, Turkish, or Persian theorist has ever spoken of the division of the major tone into four equal parts. . . . In the interval G A+ [Pa Dha+], starting from G [Pa], we have:
1) 243/256 (limma) [G (Pa) Aj, (DhaL-)]
2) 2048/2187 (apotome) [G (Pa) Aj, (DhaL+)]
3) 59049/65536 (minor tone) [G (Pa) A (Dha)].
The intervals obtained by this method certainly do not divide the tone into four equal parts.41
Nine centuries earlier, Avicenna (Abu ‘All al-Husayn ibn ‘Abd Allah ibn SIna) was already laughing at the theorists who believed that the limma was a mathematical halftone and that the irka was a quarter tone, and he explains the exact value of their ratios.42
W estern D ivision o f the Octave into Twenty-two Intervald
Westerners, always ready to criticize the so-called quarter tones of Eastern music, nevertheless themselves acknowledge within the octave twenty-one dif ferent tones, which they represent by distinct signs. Their notation is in fact based on the triple septenary of seven naturals, seven sharps, and seven flats. If the octave is added, this gives 3 x 7 + 1 = 22. The fact that in tempered tuning systems two notes may be represented by one in no way implies that they are really identical. Indeed, they are so far from being identical that, to indicate the



same tempered note, two signs are maintained, which would be illogical if there were really only one sound. This division differs only by one note from the Indian division. But not even noticing that their own notation implies twenty-one distinct sounds in the octave, no doubt too “civilized” to care for the elementary laws of physics and mathematics that necessitate such a division, Westerners often speak in con temptuous terms of musical systems other than their own, and describe Asian musicians as “like the Greeks, more intent in splitting tones into quarters and eighth parts, of which they compute the ratios to show their arithmetic, than on displaying the principles of modulation as it may affect the passions.”43 Such regrettable views only show that these otherwise learned scholars are as unaware of the realities of musical practice in their own country as they are of the strong acoustic and mathematical grounds of the Eastern musical theory that they so lightly venture to ridicule. They do not seem to realize that the intervals used by Eastern musicians and by the great Western violinists are, for the impartial ear of sound-measuring instruments, generally identical, although the simplifications necessitated by their practical notation may sometimes hide this identity because it dissimulates the true nature of the component sounds. It is unfortunate that this deficiency regarding the knowledge of the elements of acoustic reality has not prevented many a Western scholar from writing books about scales. Such an approach to purely scientific questions may be culturally most destructive because the musical systems concerned often belong to peoples who have passed through a period of political dependence when their culture was at the mercy of education officials who could open or close educational institu tions at will, and who were, for music at least, obviously not qualified to form an independent opinion. Even after political independence, the cultural impe rialism of the West continues to be extremely powerful. W hen an apparently unbiased scholar such as J. Grosset, who is generally considered in Western countries to be an authority, spoke of “this musical past . . . whose asserted splendor, if it ever existed, has for long been forgotten,”44 and described the classification of notes as “those childish speculations, which do not deserve any attention except as a characteristic indication of Indian mentality,”45 he may have inspired with all the weight of his authority the actions of officials who, in the name of civilization, did their best to destroy some of the most precious monuments and greatest treasures of human culture. Unfortunately, such utter ances as these can do incalculable harm, for to the layman they are the opinions of experts, and the layman cannot be expected to know that these same experts are as ignorant as he is himself of the intricacies and significance of the things they speak of in such contemptuous and authoritative terms.



Influence o f Indian T heory in Europe
It seems that some of the conceptions that are the basis of Indian theory were known in Europe at the end of the Middle Ages, indirectly by way of Egyptian and Pythagorean tradition transmitted to the Arabs and Byzantines. This indi rect transmission can explain the numerous mistakes in the application of these principles to musical practice. The three scales, or gram as, have become the three hexacorda:
Hexacordum naturale C D E F G A (Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha)
Hexacordum durum G A B C D E (Pa Dha Ni Sa Re Ga)
Hexacordum m olle F G A B C D (Ma Pa Dha Ni Sa Re).
To the symbols of the Greek alphabetic notation of the scale, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, aa, are added five upper sounds and one lower sound, gam m a, to give a scale of twenty-two sounds. The word ga m u t (French gam m e, Latin gam m a) singularly resembles the Sanskrit gram a (village) or Prakrit gam a, though I am not qualified to decide whether this word comes from Greek or Sanskrit; the mere fact that in two different places the same word is used to represent the same thing is not a proof in itself.4'1
The Jatis
The twenty-two srutis are divided into five families, or jatis, according to their mood. The different relations that can be established between these five families allow the classification of the notes in the different modes (ragas) according to their mood. Figure 12 shows the fiv e ja tis as they are defined in the Sanglta-ratndkara and the Sangtta-parijdta.
T h e ja tis correspond not to scales but to similarities of expression. It is impossible to build a scale in which all the notes have a similar mood, that is, in which all the notes belong to the samejd ti. Only when the scale has been built according to the general rules of proportion can one see whether its different notes incline toward a certain feeling—enter into a certain jd ti—or not. Figure 13 shows the twenty-two srutis in sequence, with theja tis to which they belong. The classification of individual notes into ja tis in this manner is known as sruti-jdti. The classification of scales according to the number of notes used in ascending and descending is known as rdga-jati.

therefore natural and irresistible correspondences between the different aspects of manifestation, and starting from one particular aspect one can easily reach or evoke the corresponding stages in the other aspects. According to this principle, the notes and chords of music have exact equiva lents in every category of existence. Only the knowledge of such correspon dences can allow us to understand the real meaning of sounds and to use them rationally as a means of evocation. We shall give here some of the principal correspondences indicated in the Sanskrit treatises. Such correspondences are always envisioned from the point of view of the geometry of sounds, and they are therefore equally valid for the modal degree and the polyphonic interval, which are simply two different ap plications of one relation. W hat is said here of the fifth degree G (Pa), for example, also applies to the fifth as a polyphonic interval. In his Sangita-parijata, Ahobala says:
Sa [C], Ga [E [,], and Ma [F] are born from the family of devas [angels]. Pa [G] is born of ancestors, Re [D] and Dha [A] are born of the family of munis [sages], Ni [B|,] is bom of the family of demons.47 This is the distinction of families. Sa [C], Ma [F], and Pa [G] are brahmins [priests]; Re [D] and Dha [A] are kshatriyas [warriors]; Ga [E] and Ni [B] are vaisyas [traders]; the altered notes [sharps or flats (tlvras or konuils)} are siidras [laborers]. Thus the learned scholars have described the distinction of castes. The note Sa [C] is like a lotus, Re [D] is of a reddish yellow, Ga [E] is like gold, Ma [F] is like jasmine. Pa [G] is black, Dha [A] is yellow, and Ni [B[,] is variegated. Such are the colors of the notes. There are seven continents: Jambu, Saka, Kusa, Krauficha, Salmall, Sveta, and Pushkara. The seven notes art born respectively from the seven continents. Agni [the fire deity], Brahma, Mriganka [the moon], Vishnu, the sage Narada [the celestial singer], Tumburu, and Kuvera [the god of wealth] are respectively the seers of the seven notes, flo “see the notes” means to have direct knowledge of their absolute pitch.] Vahni [fire], Brahma, Sarasvati [goddess of learning], Sarva [Siva], Sri [Lakshml], Ganesa, and the sun are the respective gods of the seven notes. . . . Sa [C] and Ma [F] are in comic mood; Dha [A] and Ni [B|J in erotic mood; Pa [G] in odious, pathetic, and terrible mood; Re [D] in erotic mood; Ga [E (,] in comic mood. Tivra [sharp] is in heroic, marvelous, and horrible mood, tivretara [sharpened by two srutis] is in comic mood, and even tivrctama-Ma [Ma sharpened by three srutis, i.e., Pa- (G-)] is in erotic mood; . . . mridu-Ma [Ma- (F-)] is in comic mood. Thus is truly the distinction of the moods [rasas] of the seven notes. Here ends the description of notes.4*



There are several systems of correspondences between notes and planets, angels, gods, colors, castes, seasons, emotions (rasas), and so on; at first sight these can appear contradictory, but in reality they refer to different fundamental (suddha) scales. These systems are studied in detail in my book The Ragas o f N orthern Indian M usic. W e should only note here that the names of animals attributed to the notes in the tradition of the Sam aveda are in the same order as those used by medieval and modem authors, but transposed. Thus the cry of the peacock, which represents Pa (G) in the Samaveda, now corresponds to Sa (C). If, as is asserted by Indian musicians, the cry of these animals is always at the same pitch, this would indicate that standard pitch has risen by one fourth since Vedic times. The Chinese, who attach great importance to the exactitude of their stan dard pitch, have to this day kept this primitive pitch, which is also that of the yekah, or tonic, in Arabic music. T he mesa of ancient Greek music had, accord ing to the calculations of Gevaert, the same pitch as the modern Western FI, which, if we take into account the difference of one half tone existing between the usual Indian pitch and modern Western standard pitch, brings us again to the same note.
T he M oded o r Ragas
The term raga is much more accurate than the term m ode as usually understood in the West. Raga (“passion”) denotes a group of sounds used for the represen tation of a definite emotional state. Another element of Western music that has something in common with the raga is the figured bass, which leaves every possibility open for variation but defines the expressive outline in advance. Insisting upon only one form of emotion, the mood slowly penetrates even the most inattentive hearers and establishes itself in their minds. That is why the power of suggestion of modes and ragas is so much stronger than that of other musical forms, in which the mood is always changing. This influence can be strong enough to bring about physical and psychological transformations that seem unbelievable to those who are accustomed only to the powerful but rela tively superficial effects of harmonic music. Like all ancient peoples, the Greeks attached great importance to the power of modes as a means of imposing upon the mind certain conceptions and points of view. Their value as instruments of education, or means of influencing the masses, was therefore recognized, and their use regulated. According to Aristotle:
Some modes, such as the Mixolydian, incline people toward melancholy, toward more concentrated feelings. Others, such as the relaxed modes, inspire carelessness and laziness. Another intermediary harmony brings calm and peace to the soul; only the Dorian mode can produce this effect,



while the Phrygian mode stimulates enthusiasm. . . . All hymns conse crated to Bacchus, and all such movements, take their particular character from their adaptation to the Phrygian mode; such is also the case for the dithyramb, which is considered by all as a Phrygian invention. . . . As for the Dorian harmony, all are unanimous in recognizing its character of constant gravity and male firmness. . . . To it can be added other similar modes that are adequate for the education of children because they are, at the same time, able to instruct them and to raise in them the notion of decency.49
D efin ition o f Ragas
A mode, or rdga, is defined by four indispensable factors:
1) A tonic, constantly played, upon which the whole modal structure depends.
2) A scale, containing between five and nine notes. Melodies that make use of more than nine notes are mixtures of modes, and compositions of less than five notes are only “melodic figures” (tana). There is generally a difference between the ascending (drohd) and descending (avdroha) forms of the scale.
3) Certain m elodic figu res, and ways of attacking the notes, which are called the form (riipa) of the mode. They constitute the “theme.”
4) A dominant. In each mode, a note—not necessarily the tonic, though in some cases it may be—is played more often than the others, is always accentuated, and is dwelt on for a longer time. This note is called vddi (that which speaks). It is said to be the raja (king) of the melody. A second note, of almost equal importance, is called sam vddl (consonant); it is either a fourth or a fifth above the vddi. The other notes of the mode are called anuvddi (assonant). The notes that, do not belong to the mode are called vivddt (dissonant).
These four elements—the tonic, the scale, the shape imposed by the rupa, and the dominant note—are sufficient to determine a mode and its feeling. W ithin these limits all combinations of rhythms and melodies are allowed, but the slightest use of a vivd di note, or of melodic figures belonging to the rupa of another mode, spoils the atmosphere and mood of a rdga. If the four elements of a rdga are known, the rdga is perfectly determined, but if one of those elements is missing, the rdga remains indeterminate and it is impossible to define its meaning or expression. This is also the case, for example, with Gregorian plainchant, where the tonic is always uncertain. The classical treatises generally describe seventy-two principal ragas, to which are added derived ragas reaching a total of several hundred. This is only the number of ragas actually in use, because the number of theoretically possible ragas is much greater. Ahobala speaks of 13,726,560 different combinations of



notes and of 18,678 ragas of seven notes, 31,050 ragas of six notes, and 17,505 ragas of five notes in the M a gram a alone.
The Periods o f the D ay
Much importance is attached in Indian music to the connection between ragas and the periods of the day. Westerners recognize that certain musical works can represent morning, midday, or night, but they have never tried to define the intervals by which they are characterized, and they find it quite natural to play them at any hour. Indians do not approve of such a lack of sensitivity; ragas of the night should be played at night, and those of the dawn at dawn. Only then can we fully understand and enjoy them without effort, because we ourselves change according to the hour, and the day in its brief cycle is the image of life. Played at times other than those which they represent, ragas can for a mo ment change the course of nature; musicians playing the ragas of night during the day, for example, have been seen to appear gradually surrounded by intense dark ness. This connection of ragas with the hours of the day is also known to the Per sians and Arabs, but their calculation is not as precise as that of the Indians. There are three main divisions of the day:
1. The day, of which the sun is the luminary
2. The night, of which the moon is the luminary
3. The twilight, of which fire is the luminary
The sun is said to have 116 rays, the moon 136, and fire 108. Their sum is equal to 116+ 136 + 108 = 360. To this corresponds the division of the day into 360 units of four minutes each. Six of these units form one ghatikd of twenty-four minutes, of which there are sixty in twenty-four hours. These have been con nected with the division of the octave into commas. Twelve of these small units form one m uhurt, of forty-eight minutes, of which there are thirty in a day, each of them being dedicated to a particular deity. The day is further divided into eight watches (praharas) of three hours each and, further, into twenty-four hours (twice twelve), assimilated to the twelve regions of the octave, the signs of the zodiac, and so on. The day and the night comprise an ascending part, of masculine char acter, and a descending part, of feminine character, because “manifestation or growth is masculine, disappearance or decline is feminine, and neuter is the intermediate condition.”50All these elements have their importance in determining the proper time to play the different ragas, principally regulated by the respective value of the notes in regard to sun, moon, and fire. The main divisions are therefore:
1) Sandbiprakasa ragas, for the conjunction of the day and night (sunset and sunrise), whose general characteristics are Re komal (D(,) and Ga tivra (E natural)
2) After Sandbiprakasa (first part of the day or night), usually characterized by Re (D), Ga (E) and Dha suddha (A natural)



3) Before Sandhiprdkdsa (second part of day and night), characterized by Ga komal (Ej,) and Ni komal (Bt)
These periods are further defined by the following particularities:
1. Between midday and midnight the vd d i (dominant note) is in the lower tetrachord (purvdnga), i.e., between Sa (C) and M a (F).
2. Between midnight and midday the vddi is in the upper tetrachord (uttaranga), from Pa (G) to Sa (C).
3. The augmented fourth, Ma tlvra (FI), belongs to the critical times of midday and midnight, sunrise and sunset, solstices and equinoxes. It may also exist in the morning, but then it is dominated by Ga komal (E|,). There are some exceptions to this rule, when M a dvra (F I) corresponds to an expression of fear and pain.51
4. In the defective modes of six or five notes, the evening modes never leave out Ga (E) and Ni (B) (udatta notes), and the morning modes never leave out Re (D) and Dha (A) (anuddtta notes).
The M odal or H arm onic D ivision o f the Octave
Indian d esl music is essentially modal, which means that the intervals on which the musical structure is built are calculated in relation to a permanent tonic. This does not mean that the relations between sounds other than the tonic are not considered, but that each note will be established first according to its relation to the fixed tonic and not, as in the case of the cycle of fifths, by any permutation of the basic note. The modal structure can thus be compared to the proportional division of a straight line rather than to the periodic movement of a spiral. According to the symbolism of numbers, these proportional divisions are connected with certain ideas, forms,'and emotions. The object of harmonic science is to classify these proportions according to their symbolism and the feelings, images, or symbols they express. Only on this basis can modes be logically constructed and their expression precisely defined. All the notes obtained in the harmonic system are distinct from those of the cyclic system, which is based on different data. Yet though the notes are theoretically distinct and their sequence follows completely different rules, in practice they lead to a similar division of the octave into fifty-three intervals. Figure 14 shows the scale of proportions, which is the basis of all modal music.52 This scale is made of a succession of commas (81/80 = 5 savarts), with disjunctions of eight savarts. The disjunctions can be divided into two equal parts by an intermediate sound, which corresponds to the quarter tone. In the same table, we show the place of the twenty-two srutis, according to the defi nitions of the ancient treatises, corroborated by the practice of present-day traditional musicians.

A ncient Greek. M u.iic
If we try to study ancient Greek music from the point of view of Western scholarship, it is extremely puzzling. A great number of ill-assorted intervals seem to be assembled in genera and modes that appear strange and poorly adapted to the necessities of both acoustics and art. In addition, the genera, modes, or intervals are represented by ratios that, although mathematically very precise, differ from one theorist to another. W hen such laxity in definition is possible, so much precision in the measurement of the intervals seems rather arbitrary. If, however, we consider the peculiar position of ancient Greek civilization, it is easy to find the key to this enigma. But first we shall have to repudiate the legend that the Greeks invented everything. Far from having invented anything in music, the Greeks received all the elements of their musical system from Egypt and the Near East, a fact that they never attempted to conceal. Where they really showed their originality was in their physicists’ attempts to explain the laws of that music with the help of a theory that they had received from another source, and that in reality was applicable to another system. Since the physicists’ theory could never coincide with the system as used by the musicians, many compromises had to be invented. This explains the multiplicity of com binations and ratios proposed for each mode according to the inventiveness of the physicists.



Greek music as it was actually played, being modal, is necessarily included in the definitions of ancient Indian music, because those definitions cover all the possibilities of modal music. Greek music, like Egyptian music, most probably had its roots in Indian music, or at least in that universal system of modal music of which the tradition has been fully kept only by the Indians. In opposition to this modal system, the cyclic system of the Greek physicists, based on the prop erties of numbers according to the doctrines of Pythagoras, is represented in its most complete form by Chinese musical theory. As usual, the Greek physicists, the “scientists” unable to realize the limits of their own knowledge, accused the musicians of being ignorant and obstinate. Like all reformers, they considered as normal the stage of development reached in their time by the art they pretended to explain and improve, and they would have been most astonished had they been able to realize that any music built according to the logic of their theories would have been of quite a different nature and would have had little resemblance to the art that they loved. Such a music—Chinese music, for example—would have hurt their ears, and they certainly would have rejected it as “barbarous.” This is what was observed by the Arabs. “W hen, under the rule of the Abbasid caliphs, the Arabs came into direct contact with the Persian and Byz antine populations, their artists soon realized the very great differences that existed between the teachings of Greek theorists and the art practiced by those populations—that living and real art which, more than scholarly works could do, has imprinted upon Arab music a mark of which there still remain deep traces today.”1 This conflict of theories gives rise to so much confusion that ancient Greek music would not be a subject of particular interest for the study of scales (since we can study, in their complete form in China and India, the very systems from which it originated) if Western music had not inherited from Greece its am biguous position between two systems and its inadequate theory, in addition to certain classifications. Because of the extravagant fanaticism with which the most arbitrary theories are so often imposed upon the whole world in the name of civilization, simply because they came from Europe, such theoretical confu sions cannot be too strongly opposed, since under the guise of reforms and progress they undermine the basis of non-European musical systems that are most logically and solidly established. W e can get only a very faint idea of what ancient Greek music really was from the prejudiced explanations of theorists. Often we can get better data about technique and musical expression from the criticisms made of musicians than from the explanations of theorists, for these criticisms allow comparisons to be made with modal systems still in existence today. For example, the muchcriticized habit of “pulling the strings” indicates the use of the glissando between the notes, just as in Indian music. Through this technique, a good musician can



96 music dud m powti ot sound
draw the most wonderful arabesques but in the hands of a lesser artist, they can become merely a kind of formless twittering in which the poorer musicians of India or of ancient Greece endlessly delight. To study old Greek music we must be somewhat cautious about Greek theorists, but we must above all fear the works of modem Westerners because, as Raouf Yekta Bey has remarked humorously, “the writings of Europeans on ancient Greek music are so filled with errors and baseless hypotheses that, if we had to refute all of them, five volumes of encyclopedic size would not suffice.”2 Besides, Europeans have no right to the title of sole heirs to and authorized commentators on ancient Greek music. In reality, the Arabs and the Turks happened to receive directly the inheritance of Greece. In many cases the works of Greek philosophers and mathematicians reached Europe through the Arabs. The most serious studies on Greek music were written by Arab scholars such as al-Farabl in the tenth century and Avicenna a little later, while WesternersBoethius in particular—had already made the most terrible mistakes. It is the Arabs who maintained a musical practice in conformity with this theory, a prac tice and theory that are still those of Arab music today. It would therefore seem elementary for Western scholars to take into account the interpretation of an cient Greek theory given by the Arabs before starting the fantastic reconstruc tions that have so prolifically flourished in Europe in recent years. Such a comparison is all the more necessary because the differences of interpretation concern the most fundamental definitions. We are not in a position as yet to start the kind of detailed comparative study that would be necessary for any practical description of ancient Greek modes and the technical details necessary for their execution. Therefore, in stead of presenting them, as is commonly done, as vague atonal scales absolutely insufficient for musical expression, we shall have to limit ourselves in this brief study to an attempt to outline in broad terms what is generally known ofPythagorean theory, its approximate application to modes, and the musical classifications of the Greeks. As we have seen in connection with Indian ragas, three elements at least are necessary for the definition of a mode, just as three notes are needed to define a chord. In the case of modes, these elements are the scale, the tonic (which is constantly present), and the dominant notes, which can be one or two in num ber (the vd d i and sam vadi of Indian music). The position of the mobile notes between the fixed tonic and dominant produces exactly the same numerical relationship, as do chords. But whereas in modulating systems, where every sound is mobile, it is necessary to repeat with each note the “body of harmony” (tonic, fifth or fourth, and octave) in order to establish the meaning or mood of the note, in the modal system one note alone, by changing its place, can produce the effect of a major or minor chord, in any inversion, a seventh chord, and so on. T he modal frame, being fixed and firmly established in the memory of the



hearer through the prelude, no longer needs to be constantly repeated, as do the chords of harmonic music, and it can sometimes even be left entirely implicit and understood. Probably because of the commentators’ ignorance of modal music, the three elements without which a mode cannot be defined do not appear clearly in any transcription of Greek modes. These studies should probably be redone, bearing in mind the particularities of modal systems, instead of trying to find the principles of harmony in the Greek modes at any cost.
The Theory o f the Scale
The Pythagorean theory can be very briefly expressed as follows: “T he demiurge has divided the composition [of the soul of the world] into seven parts, which relate to one another like the terms of two geometrical progressions, one of ratio 2 (1, 2, 4, 8) and the second of ratio 3 (1, 3, 9, 27). W ith the help of these two progressions, the demiurge has formed a single progression [of] 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 8, 27.”3 This Pythagorean progression, with its characteristic inversion of the fifth and sixth numbers, is to be found in every traditional system and is, for example, the basis of the scale on which the Samaveda is sung, a scale that in much more ancient times showed the same inversion. The Ndrada-sikshd gives the Vedic scale (descending) as corresponding in classical Sanskrit notation to:
Ma Ga Re Sa Dha Ni Pa (F) (E t) (D) (C) (A) (Bt) (G)
or, in modern notation, to:
Pa Ma Ga Re Ni Sa Dha (G) (F) (E) (D) (B) (C) (A)
The numbers representing these notes would correspond to those of the Pythagorean progression. If we compare the numbers of these progressions two by two, we find six intervals and twelve relations:
1/2—2/1, 2/3—3/2, 3/4-4/3, 4/9-9/4, 9/8-8/9, 8/27-27/8
The harmonic problem, according to the last passage of the Republic, con sists in “unifying” the intervals, in filling the spaces between them with other terms that will form definite ratios with the first ones. This opera tion is called “harmonizing” (harvionein). . .. The result is the consonance (s'timpbonia) of intervals or their accord. . . . Plato will thus fill the intervals of the primitive series 1 : 2 : 3 : 4 : 9 : 8 : 27 so as to find the musical intervals and their divisions.4
To fill the first interval, 1-2, he chooses, among the ratios formed by the



terms of the series, the harmonic medium division (3/2) and the arithmetic medium division (4/3), whose relation (9/8) is divided into two unequal parts: the limma (256/243) and the apotome (2187/2048). The limma is the difference between two tones (81/64) and one fourth (4/3), and the apotome the difference between the limma and the tone (256/243 x 2187/2048 = 9/8). In this way one obtains the following series:
1 9/8 81/64 4/3 3/2 27/16 243/128 2
In ancient Greece, the sounds that we call high were called low, so the numerical ratios were used in the opposite order. Interpreted according to modem ideas, that is, in ascending order, this numerical scale would give:
C D E+ F G A+ B+ C (Sa) (Re) (Ga+) (Ma) (Pa) (Dha+) (Ni+) (Sa) 1 9/8 81/64 4/3 3/2 27/16 243/128 2
intervals: 9/8 9/8 256/243 9/8 9/8 9/8 256/243
major major limma major major major limma
tone tone tone tone tone savarts: 51 51 23 51 51 51 23
In this way we obtain two equal tetrachords, each containing two major tones and one limma, separated by a major tone (ex. 12). This scale is identical to the scale of fifths, if we take as tonic the F (Ma), but if the tonic is kept as C (Sa), we find in it the arithmetic mean, 4/3 =F (Ma), instead of the seventh fifth, F i (Ma tivra) = 512/729.

This is, in the Pythagorean system, the equivalent of the Western major scale or the Indian B ildval that. According to Indian theory, this interpretation of the Pythagorean scale should be correct for our times, as it corresponds to the current cosmic data. But in other periods, another interpretation must be given to it. This leads to somewhat different basic scales. The fact that the numerical Pythagorean scale can adapt itself to these different interpretations in accordance with the pecu liarities of cosmic periods speaks in favor of the accuracy of the data on which it is based. Starting from the higher C (Sa), that is, using the half-string as a unit, we must divide by two the numbers of the Pythagorean series to obtain the propor tions on the full string. The string lengths therefore become:

This scale is exactly the opposite of the former one. It is also exclusively composed of major tones and limmas, but being a descending scale it has its half tone at the lower end of each tetrachord. Examples 13 and 14 show two ways of notating this scale, which is called the Dorian mode, “the diatonic of the physicists,” and which corresponds to the Indian B hairavi that.

According to modem conceptions, a scale or mode is defined by the respective place occupied by the notes within the interval of one octave. For the ancient Greeks, however, it was otherwise, as it still is today for the Arabs: the relative place of the mobile notes within the fixed frame of the tetrachords defines genus and mode. “Genus estcerta qmedarn tetrachordi divisio," wrote Aristides Quintilianus in his De musica. For the modal definition to be complete, four tetrachords are required, which have a different function though they are generally similar. This is why, in ancient Greek music, transposing a melody one octave higher changes its character, while a transposition of two octaves will bring back the same feeling. The frame of the tetrachords is fixed and is formed by the tonic, the fourth, the fifth, and the octave. These are invariable and are called by Aristotle the “body of harmony.” But within the tetrachords, the two other notes are mobile and, according to their position, form the enharmonic, chromatic, and diatonic genera. This classification is somewhat artificial and has given rise to the most amusing mistakes in interpretation and to the most violent invectives, which are certainly not justified.



The four tetrachords are the lower (I), the middle (II), the disjunct (III), and the upper (TV). To these four tetrachords must be added a lower note, the proslambanvmenos, and a fifth tetrachord similar to the others but ending down ward on the mesa, and called the conjunct tetrachord (V). In the diatonic genus, all these tetrachords formed the scale of the Pythagorean great perfect system, within whose frame the two groups of national (Dorian) and barbarian (Phrygian) harmonies developed. These five tetrachords gravitate around the mesa, the highest note of the middle tetrachord, which was dedicated to the sun because it was the center of the whole musical system—the permanent note, constantly heard and in rela tion to which all other notes had significance. Western scholars interpret this scale as shown in example IS. But Safiyu-d-DIn, as interpreted by d’Erlanger, gives the definition of the scale shown in figure 15 (to which we have added the corresponding Indian notations).

The different genera and modes found in ancient Greek music are still in use in Indian music today, although under an apparently different classification. But this classification, more convenient in practice for musicians, requires some experience of music and is therefore less easily handled by scholars. There are two classifications of sounds because sounds have two aspects, a physical aspect and an intellectual one. The physical aspect, the “form,” is a material vibration that can be known by measurements or numbers, while the intellectual aspect, the “meaning” or expression, is directly perceived. Indians prefer to study musical sounds under this latter aspect only. They consider this system to be more practical because it can always be accurately established without the help of any measuring instrument. According to Western scholars, the diatonic division of the scale was not the most ancient in Greece. It would be more accurate to say that it was not the basic definition. In spite of all the efforts of philosophers and mathematicians, it could never, in musical practice, replace the ancient enharmonic conception of the scale. An enharmonic notation always remained in use even for the dia tonic scale. In reality, as we have already seen in Indian music, there can be no opposition or anteriority between the enharmonic scale (srutis) and the diatonic scale (gramas) since they necessarily coexist as two forms of the same thing. Because Western scholars have not meditated upon acoustics, and because of their un doubted tendency to assume that ancient theories are as arbitrary as their own, contradictions are seen where there is only a difference of approach.

According to Maurice Emmanuel,
The graphic system used by the Greeks to represent musical sounds is in formal contradiction with the Pythagorean division of the octave, which is based on tuning by means of fifths: it is called the vulgar or vocal diatonic. It is true that professional musicians and dilettanti partly accepted the Pythagorean construction. The fixed sounds, the “body of harmony,” were placed in their true place with the help of the consonance of fifths accord ing to the process already seen. Starting from the mesa the three other fixed sounds were obtained:
I " ° ° 1" ° “ ° 8
[Dha G a Ni G a Ni Dha Ga]
But within this rigid frame they attempted to insert mobile sounds not arising from the fifths; these were therefore placed according to inter vals smaller than half tones or bigger than tones.5
W hat were these contemptible intervals, which, without regard for twen tieth-century decency, the Greeks inserted into the tetrachords, and against which Maurice Emmanuel felt all the more indignant because, according to him, they had “so regrettably succeeded”? The Greeks divided musical modes into three genera:
1) T he diatonic, in which each tetrachord is divided into two tones and one half tone
2) The chromatic, characterized in each tetrachord by a trihemitone, or minor third, the remaining tone usually being divided into two half tones
3) The enharm onic, whose characteristic interval is, in each tetrachord, a major third, or ditone, the remaining half tone usually being divided into two dieses, or quarter tones
Western scholars claim that the chromatic genus is characterized by a succession of two half tones, and the enharmonic by a succession of two quarter tones, but the Arabs assert that, although this may accidentally happen, it is not at all a necessary feature of these genera. According to al-Farabl, a chromatic genus is one in which each tetrachord contains a minor third, whatever may be the disposition of the other intervals; an enharmonic genus is one in which each tetrachord contains a major third; and a diatonic genus is one in which each tetrachord contains two full tones. “Greek authors, in fact, use the denomination enharm onic, which Avicen na translates very well by the term ta'lifiyyah, to designate the genus that contains the natural third of ratio 5/4, and the denomination chromatic, which is exactly translated by the Arab term m ulawwanab, to designate the genus



in which one of the three intervals is a minor third of ratio 6/5 or 7/6.”6 On the question of quarter tones and their use in the enharmonic genus, the most astonishing theories have been constructed by Western scholars, in which, needless to say, the poor Greeks are always proved to have been wrong. The intemperance of language and imagination shown by scholars can only be attributed to the certainty that the users of equal temperament have lost all notion of the variety of intervals that are harmonically and melodically accurate. To understand the genera of Greek music, we must first study the funda mental genus, the enharmonic, because in conformity with definitions imported into Greece from Egypt and Asia it was the basic genus of Greek music, from which the others were born. It was by no means a degeneracy or a later refine ment of Greek music, as we are sometimes made to believe. Maurice Emmanuel himself had to acknowledge that “it is the enharmonic genus, graphical standard of all the scales, that is the primordial genus,”7and he adds, “The professionals stated this strange principle that the most regular, the ‘most exact’ melodic succession was the enharmonic.”8 Let us see what this genus actually was.
The E nharm onic Genus
According to Western interpretation, the enharmonic genus divides each tetrachord into eight, one, and one dieses, that is to say, into a ditone (two major tones) and two quarter tones (ex. 16). This division gives what Maurice Emmanuel calls “ugly little fragments,” impossible to sing accurately, if at all:

It is difficult to believe that the human voice can commonly permit such an artificial mechanism. The vocal cords, which every singer possesses, do not allow unlimited freedom. A singer is always liable to sing out of tune and to produce unknowingly intervals smaller than the half tone; it is his undeniable right, which he often overuses. But can he at will and with accuracy produce intervals (a third of a tone, a quarter of a tone) without the help of the fundamental consonances (fifth, fourth, natural thirds) to build or measure them accurately?9
W hat the “natural thirds” are, Emmanuel is careful not to say, because there are many different ones and they prove the exact opposite of his thesis. In particular, the third produced by the fundamental consonances of the fifths is the ditone (81/64) and not the natural major third (5/4), which is smaller by one comma. It is the ditone that singers without accompaniment will in many cases sing most easily, and not what is commonly called the natural third (5/4).

T he enharmonic genus, says the legend, originated from the pentatonic voca l enharm onic, invented by the aulete Olympos (ex. 17). According to Gevaert, the enharmonic was obtained by dividing the half tones to obtain a modal scale of seven tones. This conception somewhat disfigures reality because it brings onto the same level sounds whose function is different.

In Indian music, the vocal enharm onic of Olympos, as it is given here, would correspond to the mode Gunakali (ex. 18). But good musicians, whenever they play or sing a melody in this mode, use two distinct notes for the D|, (Re komal) as well as for the Aj, (Dha komal). One, generally used in ascending, forms a large half tone with the starting note

in the lower tetrachord, and a major half tone I
G A l, (Pa Dhat) = 16/15
in the upper one. The large half tone 27/25, which is bigger by one comma than the major half tone, is an unstable interval, but one often used in the ascending scale, to which it gives strength and movement. On the other hand, the A {,(Dha komal) and D \,(Re komal) in the descending scale are expressive notes attracted by the fifth and the tonic. Their pitch is therefore necessarily only a minor half
tone or a limma above them: » i
A t G (Dha » Pa) = 25/24 and D|, C (ReL- Sa) = 135/128
This forms an interval full of pathos, which requires resolution to the fifth and the tonic respectively. There is nothing illogical in this, and all the subtlety of expression of the mode comes from that dash toward joy, which falls back into melancholy. The claim made by Emmanuel and many others that these intervals cannot be clearly differentiated by the ear is unfounded. I have often measured these intervals with very accurate instruments and have always found a perfect accuracy in their differentiation by singers as well as by instrumentalists. In reality, the feeling of these two intervals is so widely different that once they have been heard and



understood it is impossible to confuse them. One could have agreed with Emmanuel if he had been satisfied by saying what he knew: that Western singers have become unable to sing accurate intervals because Western vocal as well as in strumental technique always tends to create hazy sounds with strong vibrato, whose purpose is to hide the constant discord of voices and instruments in orchestral music. Unfortunately such a vocal technique diminishes the intensity of expression in equal proportion, and for this reason it is prohibited in Asian music. There is no reason to believe that things were different with the ancient Greeks. When voices and instruments are used without vibrato, the differentia tion of intervals becomes clear and musical education quickly permits them to be recognized and reproduced. The scale of the mode Gunakali can thus be written as in example 19.

When we come to consider Indian scales in detail we shall explain the small difference between the two tetrachords, due to the functional difference between the tonic and the fifth. In this Indian mode, we thus find an enharmonic division in accordance with Greek and Arabic definitions, which assert that this division is merely the division of the tone into four unequal parts according to harmonic intervals.



This is much more probable and brings us back within the laws of acoustics, from which there is no reason to suppose that Greek music ever went astray. As for the idea of cutting tempered tones into four equal parts, it could only have occurred to the minds of Greek physicists without musical practice or accurate instruments, or to modern Westerners who add to these two handicaps that of being accustomed to the simplified tempered scale, which leads them to forget that several kinds of half tone are used in all the nontempered systems, includ ing Western music. Violinists and singers are usually most surprised if one measures the intervals they are actually using. These often differ widely from those they firmly believe themselves to be reproducing. Furthermore, it should be remembered that to divide the tone into several intervals does not necessarily mean that one uses intervals smaller than a half tone, because those divisions are never played in succession but only in relation with other notes. In Indian music the interval of one sruti is prohibited. Gen erally one of these so-called quarter tones is used in the ascending scale and the other in the descending scale, as in the case of Gunakalt. Even if these two notes are as near as one comma to each other, it does not mean that the comma is used as a musical interval, but simply that the major and minor tone are both used and the difference between these intervals is a comma. T he same mistake appears in the conception that Europeans have of modal music in general. Raouf Yekta Bey remarks that “when speaking of Asian music, people always say that it is composed of small intervals. I do not see any reason for that legend, because the smallest interval used is the limma, whose ratio is 243/256; no interval smaller than the limma is ever used melodically.”10 No doubt the ancient Greek physicists, already showing a modern spirit, found it amusing to invent numerous ways of dividing the tetrachords. But as their calculations were based on the arithmetical properties of numbers and not on their expressive correspondences, they did not bear the test of experience and were never used in music because they were impractical. Victims today of the same mistake, we cannot understand ancient Greek music because we stop at these amusing calculations instead of looking for the real modes, which nec essarily come within the range of acoustically possible intervals. T he enharmonic is not a mode but a genus. The example we gave above shows only one of the numerous modes based on the enharmonic principle that are used by Indian musicians. Many other modes, which apparently belong to other genera, are susceptible to enharmonic interpretation for some of their notes. This interpretation allows an intensification of expression and an increase in the beauty and accuracy of the form. In reality, a careful study will show that in practice every mode has an enharmonic structure. Thus the enharmonic scale is truly, as the Greeks claimed, the fundamental scale of all music and corre sponds to the Indian division of the srutis, which is the only rational and indis



putable basis of music. If the Greeks maintained a division of twenty-four inter vals instead of twenty-two, it was only because they kept (probably for reasons of symmetry) the modifications of the tonic and the fifth, which are never ac tually used in modal music and are therefore nonexistent. In any event, the accurate division by quarter tones was applicable only to one octave, the other octaves being played by ear and by pulling the strings, as is the case today on the Indian vina and sitar. Aristides Quintilianus, in the first century C.E., also said: “The first octave develops in twenty-four dieses (quarter tones), and the second rises by half tones.”11This division is still employed in our day by Turk ish and Persian musicians in the tuning of the tunbur, and the alleged quarter tones become merely the differences between major and minor tones, major half tones and limmas. The enharmonic division that we have indicated for the Indian mode GunakaK is not the only possible enharmonic division. In Gunakall the predominant notes (vddi and samvddt) are first the A|, (Dha komal), then the D[, (Re komal), the tonic being C (Sa). From the different data it follows that Gunakali is a morning mode expressing melancholy. If, however, these characteristics change, we can obtain other modes, the scale remaining apparently the same but the tuning of the different notes being adjusted to their new function. The tuning can there fore present slight differences. W ithout knowing the data that would allow the differentiation of the distinct modes belonging to the enharmonic genus, it is difficult to criticize the measurements given by the Greek physicists, which, though they do not tally, are not necessarily irreconcilable. Each tetrachord of the enharmonic genus, containing eight, one, and one dieses, is divided by different authors as in example 21. If we analyze these ratios

in the light of the Indian theory of the srutis, we see that 36/35 (12.23 savarts) and 46/45 (9.55 savarts) belong to the same sruti and are therefore approximate expressions of the interval of two commas (81/80 x 81/80 = 10.8 savarts). Fur ther, 28/27 (15.8 savarts) and 24/23 (18.48 savarts) belong to the same sruti, the minor half tone (25/24 = 17.73 savarts). The scale given by Archytas and that noted here are thus musically, if not arithmetically, identical. Ptolemy’s formu lation inverts the places of the minor half tone and the double comma. It refers to a different scale, which we also meet in Indian music. The divisions of Didymus and of Boethius form, approximately, tempered quarter tones and are therefore purely theoretical. Divisions like that of the major half tone into 31/30 x 32/31 = 16/15, or
Sa Dha-k Dha-k Pa Ma Re-k Re-k Sa



that of the limma into 499/486 x 512/243, are purely conventional and indicate only an approximation to the tempered division represented by comparatively simple ratios, while the tempered division itself is incommensurable. It is there fore useless to attempt to see in them definite intervals or ratios, because their differentiation exists only on paper. This does not mean that if they were actu ally realized, such differences of intervals could not produce any effect, particu larly as a means of action on the inanimate world (in both cases one is an ascending interval and the other a descending one), but such an effect is beyond the range of music proper and can only be produced by the aid of such mechani cal means as the Chinese lii, for example. As such means do not appear to have been used by the Greeks, these intervals must be considered as approximations. Ignorance of these small artifices of calculation leads to endless classifications of intervals lacking all basis in reality. The division indicated by the Arabs to find the approximate half of an interval is of this type. The method given by al-Farabi12 is as follows: establish the ratio between the numbers representing the two notes forming the interval; multiply each of these numbers by two and, taking half the excess of the greater number over the smaller one, add this half to the smaller and subtract it from the greater. The two ratios obtained divide the interval into approximate halves. For example, to find half of the interval of a fourth (4/3), we shall have:
4x2=8 3x2=6 8-6=2 2:2=1 6+1=7 8-1=7
The fourth is thus divided into halves as 8/7 +7/6 = 4/3. In the same way, the major half tone (16/15) divides into halves as 32/31 x 31/30 = 16/15, the minor tone (10/9) as 20/19 x 19/18 = 10/9, the large tone (8/7) as 16/15 x 15/14 = 8/7, and so forth. This method has not, so far as we are aware, been explained in those Greek texts still available, although it was obviously used by them. Whenever we meet with a division of this form, we should remember that it stands for an approxi mation to an equal division, and by no means for two different intervals.
The C hrom atic G eniu
In the chromatic genus, each tetrachord contains a minor third, and the remain ing tone is usually divided into two half tones. This division was, according to the musicians, of six, three, and one dieses in each tetrachord, but was simplified by the physicists into six, two, and two dieses. To understand these divisions we have to be familiar with the conception of srutis (dieses), which can in no way be considered as equal mathematical intervals. An interval of one sruti in this case simply means the smallest interval melodically possible above the lowest note of the tetrachord. This interval is generally of one limma (256/243 = 23 savarts)



from the tonic, and of a minor half tone (25/24 = 18 savarts) from the fifth. The interval of two srutis, indicated by the physicists for reasons of symmetry, sup posing that it were to correspond to a musical reality, could only indicate an interval bigger than the limma by one or two commas, such as the major half tone (16/15 = 28 savarts), for example. It can never represent a double interval, such as the minor tone (two limmas), which is equal to three srutis or dieses. W hile the enharmonic division of the octave is based on a scale of five notes, the chromatic division normally contains seven notes, and if some of these are subject to the refinements of the enharmonic, these will give a number of addi tional notes. Just as the enharmonic was taken as the basis for the division into twenty-four dieses (or twenty-two srutis), the chromatic will quite naturally be representative of the division of the octave into twelve half tones, and the diatonic will represent the division into seven intervals. But we should be careful not to take literally such classifications, which are more theoretical than practical. There is in reality no discontinuity between the different genera, and almost every mode or scale could be taken as a basis for the establishment of the three fundamental divisions of the octave into twenty-two, twelve, and seven intervals. Each tetrachord of the chromatic genus is thus divided into a minor third and a tone, as in example 22, the Indian raga D urga. If the tone is divided into two halftones, the scale shown in example 23 results.

In the vu lga r cbrmnatic, the interval C A+ (Sa Dha+) is a trihemitone (major tone + limma = 32/27). In the softened chromatic, C A (Sa Dha) is a minor third (major tone +major half tone = 6/5), one comma larger than in the vulgar chro matic. The interval G A+ (Pa Dha+) is a major tone (9/8) in the vu lgar chrm tatic and becomes G A (Pa Dha), a minor tone (10/9), in the softened chrmtatic. This minor tone is divided, according to Didymus, into a major half tone and a minor half tone (16/15 x 25/24 = 10/9), but according to Eratosthenes it is 19/18 x 20/ 19 = 10/9, which stands for an equal division and is called by the Arabs the weak chromatic. According to Ptolemy, the minor tone is divided as 5/14 x 28/27 = 10/9. This produces yet another scale, called by the Arabs the strong cbrmnatic. The v u lga r cbrm natic being given as in example 24, the softened chrom atic will be (1) according to Didymus, 6/5, 25/24, 16/15 (ex. 26);

We can easily see that in the division of Didymus (minor third, minor half tone, and major half tone), and in that of Ptolemy (minor third, major half tone,



and minor half tone), the order of half tones is inverted. The division of Ptolemy is more logical for a descending scale. As for the scale of Eratosthenes, it stands only for a tempered division. According to the rules of existing modal systems, there can be no mode corresponding to the chromatic scale as it is here represented following the interpretation of Western scholars. But many modes contain the same intervals in a different order, or starting from another note taken as tonic. It is therefore probable that the application of Greek data has been slightly misrepresented. For example, the Indian rdga S ri is only a plagal form of this scale (ex. 29).

The tonic is C (Sa), but starting from B (Ni) we can easily discover the chro matic tetrachord described by Didymus. The unification of almost equivalent ratios (such as 28/27 and 25/24, 243/224 and 27/25,15/14 and 16/15, etc.) on the basis of the Indian theory of the srutif may be contested, but this would in no way affect the comparisons we are making. The unification does not affect the relative proportion of the intervals in each mode, and it is easier to deal only with minor or major half tones or their very near approximation than to handle ratios that are difficult to estimate.
The D iatonic G emu
The diatonic genus has the greatest place in the surviving texts on ancient Greek music, because the whole Pythagorean theory of the national harmonies, or Dorian mode, was based on it. W e have already seen that in the diatonic genus each tetrachord was di vided into two full tones and one half tone. W hat those tones and the half tone really were remains somewhat unclear, because the whole modal theory of the Greeks is made obscure by the confusion between the cyclic system of the Pythagoreans, based on the consonance of fifths, and the modal system of the musicians. Unfortunately, it seems that the Greeks themselves felt quite at home in this confusion and never tried to search for its cause. The physicists were so proud of their ideas and so busy imposing them on others that it never occurred to them that both the musicians’ system and the enharmonic theory, which the Greeks had also received from Egypt and Asia, were based on a metaphysical system, and that their music illustrated this system and not the Pythagorean, which was always bound to be a poor fit. But the disparity did not disturb the Greek physicists at all. If practice were not in accordance with their theory, it was practice that was wrong, and they went on forcing their theory upon it

a habit followed also by later Europeans—until nobody could understand any thing and the failure was best hidden behind the absurd compromise of tem perament. This concession was presented as a great discovery, whereas in reality tempered systems had been known and rejected long before. But in spite of the efforts of the physicists, musicians went on tuning their instruments, even in the Dorian mode, with the second and the sixth notes one diesis lower than the physicists wished them to be; this gives in each tetrachord four, five, and one dieses, which according to Archytas are equivalent to the ratios 9/8 (major tone), 8/7 (large major tone), and 28/27 (small minor halftone; see ex. 30).

In Greek music, the general tonic was in the middle of the scale, a fact rather troublesome to modern minds and difficult to understand. But the lowest note was also in many cases taken as tonic, just as the general practice is today. This



led to the division of the Dorian mode—which corresponds in the great perfect system (the white keys of the piano or organ) to the octave E to E (Ga to upper Ga)—into two distinct modes. The first Dorian has for its tonic, fundamental, and final the lowest note, E (Ga), as in example 34. It corresponds to what the Indians call Sa gram a, having the Madhyama (mesa), the modern tonic, as its fourth note. If we trans pose it into the Hypodorian tone (mesa F[Ma]), whose tonic is C (Sa), the first Dorian is written like the Indian scale Shat, as in example 35.

The Greeks considered the M a gram a (tonic on the fourth) to be the basic system. T hey expressed the relation of the Sa to the M a grama by the prefix hypo, which indicates the relation of two modes having the same modal fifth but complementing the octave either downward (normal mode) or upward (subsid iary mode = hypo). This conception may be the origin of the classification of authentic and plagal modes in Gregorian music. Thus the Ionian mode was also called Hypophrygian and the Aeolian mode Hypodorian. Only the first Dorian, probably because of its national character, remained free from this nominal servitude in regard to the Mixolydian, which also kept its ancient name. Transposed into the Hypodorian tone, the Ionian mode becomes the scale shown in example 45. W ithout the conjunct tetrachord this would be

It is very interesting to note that those essential modes of modern mu sic, the major mode of C (Sa) and the minor mode of D (Re), were consid ered as unpleasant and were forbidden by the Greeks and probably all peoples of ancient times, and although they were classified by the Indians, they were not given any prominence by them until recent times. Maurice Emmanuel remarks, “T he modes of D [Re] and C [Sa] had been banished from the Greek musical language. . . . There was among the Greeks and their successors, the primitive cantores of the Christian Church, a sort of repulsion for the modes D A D [Re Dha Re] and C G C [Sa Pa Sa]. We shall note that our major mode is among the two proscribed ones; it was later to take its revenge. As for the modern pseudo-minor . . . it emerged from the D A D [Re Dha Re] scale.”13 W e can find here a remarkable confirmation of the theory which states that, since the fundamental modes are connected with the cosmic developments of the cycle, only those modes that are related to the cosmic condition of a certain period appear natural during that period. In India as in Europe the ancient Dorian mode (Bhairavt), the mode of E (Ga), has slowly given way to the mode of D (Re), Kafi, as basic scale, only to be replaced in turn by the mode of C (Sa) Bilaval. W hen we study the significance of the notes according to Indian theory in greater detail, we come to understand why the major mode was formerly re jected. W e see that its intervals express materialism, sensual egotism, hardness,



and other qualities that could not be given a dominant place in art so long as it was subordinate to considerations of an intellectual and spiritual order. When we want to pass from the abstract theory of the great perfect system to musical practice, we immediately notice the discrepancy. All these modes were in use before their classification was made, and this way of bringing dif ferent modes within the frame of one scale, however clever it may be, does not, nor can it ever, fully correspond to the reality of modal systems. Therefore, the tuning of the notes in the general scale corresponds only approximately to the actual tuning for each mode. The tuning of all the notes in a mode is done in relation to the tonic of that mode, and one may not arbitrarily choose any note as fundamental. If this is done, the modes so obtained can only be pseudo modes, plagal forms of the original scale, though they may outwardly appear to be independent modes. For any of these pseudo-modes to become a real mode, the tuning of each note would have to be adjusted so as to establish, with the new tonic, the ratios that would justify this function. At first sight the notes might appear the same, but in reality they present differences of one or two commas. This changes their expression and allows for the establishment of logical ratios. We shall meet with similar adjustments of tuning in Western music every time we pass from the cyclic system, upon which all modulations and transpo sition depend, to the modal system, which rules chords and modes, since it is the modal system that allows the establishment of harmonic ratios in relation to a basic sound. Disregard of these differences leads inevitably to the dead end of temperament, as Aristoxenes had foreseen, because in tempered systems, both chord and modulation are equally wrong, and at least neither can be said to have been sacrificed to the other. The classification of modes, as welj as the interesting divisions used by Greek physicists, seem bound to remain mere abstractions and amusing mental gymnastics as presented by western scholars. These divisions do not correspond to any acoustic or metaphysical system, but rather seem a play upon the arith metical properties of numbers—a game to which modern scientists are also prone. It by no means follows that ancient Greek music was not as marvelous as has been described; the calculations of physicists are simply not the place to look for such marvels. All the intervals used in musical practice are necessarily based upon those simple acoustic intervals that can be sung easily, can be recognized by the ear, and represent definite and distinct expressions—expressions that can be deter mined with the help of the Indian division of the srutis. Therefore when the Arab Hellenists assert that the intervals used by the Greeks were the minor tone, the limma, and the apotome, which together divide the major tone into four unequal intervals, it is highly probable that they are right.

The F ifteen Toned o f T ransposition
In Greek music it is important not to mistake modal scales (m urchanas) for tones (pitches of tonic), as Boethius himself so awkwardly did. The tones are only a system of transposition, similar to the modern West ern system, by which any mode can be brought to a pitch easily practicable for singers or instruments. They are classified according to the respective pitches of the mesa. T he fundamental tone being the Hypolydian, whose mesa is the A (Dha) of the Greek unaltered scale, its exact pitch would be, in the modem Western standard of pitch, F I (Ma tivra), approximately the Ga of the usual Indian pitch. Here is the list of the different tones:
Tone M esa
Hyperlydian i upper G (Pa)
Hyperaeolian upper Fit (Ma tivra)
Hyperphrygian upper F (Ma)
Hyperiastian upper E (Ga)
Hyperdorian upper E), (Ga komal)

The Western musical system has emerged from a mixture of various traditions that, because of complete confusion in the theoretical definitions, were brought together in a rather haphazard way. The resulting system is cyclic, with constant changes of tonic (modulations), but on each tonic, and on each note of the scales based on these tonics, the establishment of chords (harmony) depends upon the modal system, since the different notes of a chord take their meaning from their relation to the fundamental note of the chord. This system would have had every advantage had it not been based upon a fundamental confusion: the notes that form consonant chords are not the same as the notes required for modulation.1 As long as music was kept within certain limits of simplicity, musicians could, even in an orchestra, adjust each note to the successive necessities of harmony and modulation by instinct. But such adaptations, if they are not ac curately done, render the expression hazy and confused, and this imprecision compelled composers to complicate the structure of chords in an attempt to render their meaning more definite. But these complications finally resulted only in more confusion. It would have been sufficient to play the simpler chords accurately for their meaning to become clear and attractive. Added to this, the generalized use ofequal temperament, which vastly oversimplifies musical structures, has led people to forget completely the most elementary acoustic realities and, by distorting all the intervals, has rendered the meaning of chords vague and unclear. It is generally said that the ear can recognize the true interval repre



sented by the tempered interval. This is a fact; but each ear makes a different adaptation according to individual tendencies, and the same chord may have a different significance for different people according to their mood. The mean ing of an accurate chord, on the other hand, is determined absolutely and per ceived by all. The result is that Westerners have more and more lost all conception of a music able to express clearly the highest ideas and feelings. They now expect from music mostly a confused noise, more or less agreeable, but able to arouse in the audience only the most ordinary sensations and simplified images. This is a complete misconception of the true role of music. As Plato said, “Music, whose movements are of the same kind as the regular revolutions of our soul, does not appear, to the man who has intelligent intercourse with the Muses, to be good merely for giving physical pleasure, as seems to be the case in our day. On the contrary, the Muses have given us music as an ally of our soul in its attempt to bring back order and harmbny into those periodic movements that had become disorderly in us.”2But who in modern times tries to have intelligent intercourse with the Muses? People strive only for technical progress that al lows virtuosity, and for extravagant theories that make their authors famous!
Zarlino, to whom we owe the theoretical principles on which our modern theory rests . . . though he well knew the legitimate proportions that should be those of diatonic, chromatic, and enharmonic tones, and al though he recognized that it is these proportions that are given by nature and science, by Pythagoras and Plato, nevertheless created a series of artificial and wrong intonations following Ptolemy, to conform himself, he said, to the march of counterpoint, which makes them necessary. Thus, according to him, harmony is only vw dc possible Iry the violation o f the principles o f harmony, and one cannot form chords without making voices and instru ments discordant. . . . Salinas . . . who otherwise fights Zarlino . . . agrees with him on this point and sincerely believes, like him, that one must abandon the accuracy of sounds in order to build a simultaneous harmony. . . . The Italian authors . . . adopted the artificial proportions of this theorist although they all recognized them to be wrong. The famous Rameau in France and Martini in Italy had only one aim . . . that is, to find a basis for those proportions which they believed to be necessary for harmony.3
It is often proudly asserted that the modern Western musical system is sufficient to express everything, but the slightest true contact with other musical systems immediately proves the opposite. The power of evocation of the har monic system as it is conceived today is weak and confused if compared with any modal system. It oscillates between abstractions and extremely conventional imitative harmonies, because what is called an imitation of a bird, the wind, the rain, a fountain, a factory, or any other much-used subject is in reality so far from the model that a deep knowledge of musical conventions is required to be



T h e W estern S ca le a n d E qual T em p e r a m e n t *—-> 123
able to see the connection. Such conventions can become so familiar that one believes them to be realities and derives from them real pleasure, but anyone unfamiliar with them could never guess what it is all about. T he idea of repre senting natural phenomena, or the movements of things and beings, by imitat ing the noises they make appears childish to the Eastern way of thinking; it is really a primitive conception, in the sense nowadays given to this word. The relations of sounds should be able to express, not the noise or the external appearance of things, but their essence. The knowledge of these subtle relations has always been considered the basis and the true object of art in the East. It is because of these relations that the effect of music can be so deep and directly perceptible without requiring any conventions or taxing the imagination of hearers. For example, when the Indian mode of the rains, M egh-M allar, is played, no sound will attempt to imitate the noise of raindrops or of thunder, but the relations between the sounds will be so similar to those between the elements when a storm is approaching that not only trained musicians but even animals will inevitably feel the rain in the air. Modern Western music was able to develop its polyphonic system only by deliberately sacrificing the greater part of its possibilities and breaking the ties that connected it with other musical systems. Formerly, all musical systems were close to each other and, in spite of differences, could generally be understood from one country to another. Hence the success that the musicians who came with the Turkish empress had in China, or that some African musicians had in the Muslim world during the first centuries of Islam, or that gypsies have had in Europe. But since the Middle Ages there has been a tendency in the West to accept those simplifications of the theory that had already been rejected every where else as being incompatible with a refined form of art. Therefore, when Guido d’Arezzo (990-1040), “having reduced everything to the diatonic and given the last blow to the quarter tones inherited from Greek melody, directs our scale toward temperament and facilitates the progress of polyphony,” he really only gives a blow to folk music, whose very complex modal and rhythmic forms will give way to a heavy and simplified official art. Fabre d’Olivet explains that voices are
compelled by certain instruments—particularly those used in musical edu cation such as the piano, the harpsichord, the harp, or the guitar—to follow artificial intonations, and in turn compel all the other instruments that accompany them to take those intervals in the same way, so as not to be out of tune. Consequently, our diatonic genus is sometimes correct and sometimes incorrect, our chromatic is always incorrect, and we have no enharmonic genus. We must admit that if, as has been suggested by Zarlino, Salinas, and Martini, and as Rameau believed, we adopted such a system in order to have some sort of harmony, our harmony surely does not deserve the name, and it would have been better to keep it Gothic name



of counterpoint; we must also realize that our symphonists have no reason to be astonished if their modem music does not produce the effects of ancient music, since they do not hesitate to infringe the true laws of nature in this way and to corrupt the sensitivity of the ear to the point of habitu ating this organ to receive three wrong sounds out of the diatonic seven, never to hear a correct chromatic sound, and to be completely ignorant of the charms of the enharmonic genus. Had the Greeks had a musical sys tem similar to ours, I would find it difficult to believe in the marvels of which they were proud, because I should see a definite contradiction be tween the weakness of the cause and the strength of the effect.5
Following such deformations, the Western musical language finds itself artificially aloof from acoustic realities and from the laws on which the meta physical correspondences of sounds are based, a fact that renders it incompre hensible to other people. Therefore when circumstances compel peoples like the Malayans or African Americans to>adopt the Western musical system, they quickly transform it back into logical modal forms. This is why their songs, though usually very simple, have such an emotional appeal.
The M odes o f P lainchant
Very little is known today about the modal forms used in Europe during the M iddle Ages. There remain very few documents and no means of comparison with existing modal systems. In the Middle Ages, musical systems were not isolated from each other as they later became. It seems for example that in Spain, when Alfonso the W ise introduced the teaching of music into the Uni versity of Salamanca, there were numerous points of comparison between Christian art as codified by Saint Ambrose and Saint Gregory, ancient art as explained by Boethius, and Arab art as defined by Avicenna in conformity with Greek tradi tion. The reforms of Guido d’Arezzo had not yet ruined either popular art or the rich musical heritage that the troubadours were spreading from one end of Europe to the other. In our times it is mostly in the Nordic countries that some remnant of this “preharmonic” art of the West has survived, and the transcrip tions attempted by Grieg, imperfect as they are, can give us at least an idea of this powerful and vigorous art now almost lost. The only trace of medieval music that has kept some vitality in the West is the religious music called plainchant, codified by Saint Gregory. Although ex tremely simplified, it has to this day kept a system similar to that of the Greek Doristi (the Dorian modes and their plagal forms). The main difference is that the medieval modes develop upward instead of downward and that the funda mental of the first tone is the seventh of the Dorian mode, the D (Re). The conjunct tetrachord, which contains an augmented fourth, became an integral part of some of these modes, and so we may often get an idea of what the practice of Greek modes was more easily from the simplified Gregorian modes than from



the theory of the Doristi, which was made too abstract by a desire for symmetry. The eight modes of plainchant were imported from the East by Gregory the Great (540-604 c.E.), who, on return from his post of ambassador in Constantinople, codified them in his famous Antiphonary. T hey are a transcrip tion of Byzantine modes similar to the eight modes that the patriarch Severus of Antioch had used for tropes in the fourth century. Unfortunately, during their journey to Rome these modes had lost the essential element of their dif ferentiation; namely, the measuring element, the pedal of the tonic, the Byzan tine ism , the essential element of all modal music that defines each tone and the expression of each note. These melodies are thus devoid of a basis and have a rather peculiar lack of definition and absence of expression. Furthermore, their classification is as arbitrary as it is incomplete, because it has as its principle the permutation of the tonic, inspired by the Greek Doristi, a system that is based on the peculiar concordance of certain modes; it can be used as a means of classification but can in no way be taken as the basis of modal structure. This is why the modes of plainchant do not represent the system of metaphysical correspondences that Saint Gregory thought he had discovered. Gregory had not at all understood the basis of the system he pretended to adopt. He was a violent enemy of pre-Christian culture and whenever he could get hold of an cient books he had them burned. This was obviously not the best way to under stand them! The modifications he brought to the modes and the substitution of hexachords for tetrachords are not justifiable and serve no purpose. Although they are deprived of their true expression because of these defor mations and the lack of certain elements, the Gregorian modes are nevertheless by their structure real modes and therefore keep a certain appearance that rules their use. Formerly this use was strictly regulated and the mixture of modes was considered a sin. This is why, “in spite of the permission given by King Louis IX to form an academy of music, the Parliament of Paris had it closed on the grounds that musicians did not observe the ecclesiastical rules and were passing too frequently from one mode or genus to another.”'1At the time of the Refor mation, Luther was still keeping to custom and saying that the Gospel should be set to the sixth tone because Christ is a gentle Lord whose words are lovely, whereas, Saint Paul being a grave Apostle, the Epistle should be set to the eighth tone. Unlike the Greek modes, the Gregorian modes are still in use, so it is easy to verify their definitions and compare them with Indian ragas, as shown in example 49. W here the definitions of Greek modes seem sufficiently clear, the same example indicates their correspondences with the modes of plainchant, disregarding the erroneous medieval correspondences due to Boethius’s confu sion of modes and tones. Four of the Gregorian modes are authentic; four are plagal. In example 49 the final of each mode is marked with an F, and the dominant (vddi) with a D.

The Scale ofZ arlino
After numerous changes, mostly due to the attempts of theorists to adapt an incomplete and poorly understood Greek theory to an altogether different musical practice, the scale that was to be the basis of Western modern music was finally established by the Italian theorist Gioseffo Zarlino (1540-94) on the ruins of popular music. “W hat are the elements of our modern system, according to the generally accepted theory of Zarlino?” asks Fabre.d’Olivet. And he answers:
Of seven diatonic sounds, C, D, E, F, G, A, B, [Sa, Re, Ga, Ma, Pa, Dha, Ni], three, C [Sa], F [Ma], and G [Pa], are correct; one, D [Re], is correct or incorrect according to whether it is considered as the fifth of G [Pa] or as the sixth of F [Ma]; and three, E [Ga], A [Dha], and B [Ni], are completely wrong. These seven diatonic sounds give fourteen chromatic sounds, since they can all be altered into sharps [fivra] and flats \kovmt\. But these fourteen chromatic sounds are all, without exception, wrong. As for the enharmonic sounds, they simply do not exist.7
Zarlino takes the first five notes of the scale of fifths and reduces them to the nearest equivalent notes in the series of relations to the tonic:
S eries of fifths Z arlin o ’s notes
C (Sa) 1 C (Sa) 1
D (Re) 9/8 D (Re) 9/8



S eries o f fifths Z arlin o ’:s notes (continued)
E+ (Ga+) 81/64 E (Ga) 5/4
G (Pa) 3/2 G (Pa) 3/2
A+ (Dha+) 27/16 A (Dha)
C (Sa)
5/3
2
To these are added the two accessory degrees:
a fifth down from C (Sa) F (Ma) 4/3
a fourth down from E (Ga) B (Ni) 15/8
In the very elaboration of this scale, we are already changing from an ascending cyclic structure to a descending modal one. This gives us the scale known by the name of Zarlino:
C D E F G A BC (Sa) (Re) (Ga) (Ma) (Pa) (Dha) (Ni) (Sa) ratio s: 1 9/8 5/4 4/3 3/2 5/3 15/8 2 in te rv a ls : 9/8 10/9 16/15 9/8 10/9 9/8 16/15 s a v a rts : 51 46 28 51 46 51 28
The intervals are of three different types: major tone 9/8, minor tone 10/9, and major half tone 16/15. Therefore, when the tonic is changed, we shall obtain sharps and flats of different natures, and the very notes of the original scale will in some cases have to be raised or lowered by one comma (the differ ence between the major and minor tone). This difficulty comes from the fact that certain notes of the scale of fifths, which alone allows transposition, have been replaced by the ratios that allow correct harmonic intervals. In reality, for modulation, one is compelled to come back to the scale of fifths. In practice, therefore, two scales are used conjointly in Western music, and not, as is gen erally believed, only the Zarlino scale. This ambiguous position, never fully clarified, has led to the general adoption of temperament, which by splitting the difficulty between the various intervals apparently suppresses the problem but does not solve it. In order to obtain exactly the same scale when modulating from one major key to the neighboring major key, the fourth of the first key has to be raised by one limma and the sixth by one comma, the new tonic being the fifth of the former key. Thus from the very first modulation we obtain two notes that do not belong to the scale of Zarlino. In the sharp keys all the notes are raised in this way, one after the other, by one comma; for each additional sharp, another note is so raised. Conversely, if the modulation moves downward by fifths, notes are successively lowered by one comma. The keys with sharps have their original notes raised one after the other



T h e W estern S ca le a n d E qual T e m p e r a m e n t *------ 129
by a comma (to which a sharp is later added), while the keys with flats have their original notes lowered one after the other by a comma (to which a flat is later added). The result can be that the flats are lower than the corresponding sharps, as musicians often notice, despite the objection of the physicists that the reverse should be true since the sum of the theoretical intervals represented by the sharp and the flat is less than one tone. This is simply because the natural notes (suddha) to which these sharps and flats have been added are no longer the notes of the original C (Sa) scale, but notes that are lower in the case of the flat and higher in the case of the sharp. For example, when we modulate from C major into G major, the A is raised by one comma to become A+. W hen we later modulate into B major (which is really B+ major), the sharp will be added to the A+, giving AH L+. Likewise, the Bt, of B|, minor, being itself Bt L+, happens to be the same note as the Alt of B+ major. But the Bt L- ofD t major is one comma lower, or B t , and is therefore lower than the At of A+ major. We can see from this example that all the respective positions of sharps and flats are possible and that to say in a general way that sharps are higher than flats or the reverse is completely meaningless. The problem is really not very com plicated, and it would be better to consider it as it is rather than to discuss it endlessly on insufficient data. Besides, we are speaking here only of the flats and sharps necessary to obtain the same scale again after modulation. In addition to these there are other flats and sharps necessary for expression, which are used by good musicians and are different again. From this it is easy to understand how inadequate is the scale of Zarlino. If we follow the progression of scales with sharps and the progression of scales with flats, the keys of apparently similar tonics (FI and G t , or Blj and Ct, for example) can never coincide because their tonics are different from one another by one or two commas. It is therefore always incorrect to pass from one to the other, or rather, if this be done it produces relations of a new kind, which it would be necessary to define if their effect were to be correctly used. How ever, a sharp and a flat may in some instances happen to coincide. Being based on the cycle of fifths, the chain of modulations can never come back to its original pitch. It can, like the cycle of fifths itself, by symbolized by an infinite spiral.
The M ajor M ode
It was only in Basel in 1547 that Glareanus, in his Dodecachordon, introduced the major mode, which he calls the Ionian mode, as the fundamental scale. In India, the major mode was to be accepted as a basic scale, under the name of raga Bilaval, only in 1813 in the N agmat e asaphi of Muhammad Rezza. Among the combinations of successive or simultaneous sounds that have simple ratios between them, the major mode is only one particular case. Its



melodic characteristics are not particularly expressive, but it allows the forma tion of chords on its various degrees that by their structure are somewhat similar to the harmonics of a single sound. It therefore allows transposition from one degree to another with only a small adjustment of tuning, and in order to hide its monotony, Western musicians constantly use these changes of tonic, which to the Easterner appear artificial, of little significance, and therefore scarcely justified. In order to achieve those perfect chords that a refined ear perceives in the single yet complex sound of a well-tuned instrument, Westerners have sacri ficed all the possibilities of modes, which are as different from each other in their structure and possibilities as a square from a circle, a triangle, or a star shaped polygon. Modes open unlimited possibilities of chords, which we can sometimes catch glimpses of through the temperament, because temperament, by disfiguring the major mode, has brought it onto an equal footing with many other modes equally disfigured by it. This explains why so many harmonic “discoveries” followed the widespread use of the modern piano. Until then, the major mode ruled because, as Maurice Emmanuel explained, the Western mi nor mode is only a variation of the major mode, that tyrant of Western music. In addition to the peculiarity of harmonic transposition, the major mode is, by its structure, no more natural than many others, and even less pleasant for the ear than modes presenting a more complete series of harmonics. We prefer it mostly out of habit, and we see when we study the symbolism and the emotional correspondences of notes according to Indian theory that the intervals of the major mode are those that indicate egotism, vanity, materialism, and the search for pleasure, thus forming a frame in which the mentality of our times finds itself completely at home. But Westerners, who appear to ignore the fact that all the elements of their music were originally borrowed from Egypt and Chaldea, have no idea of the significance of the notes they use, and they wonder at their own genius when they discover that some chords can express precise emotions, whereas these same expressions have been defined for thousands of years in those very sastras which gave the first definitions of these intervals and chords. Let us now see how one Western musicologist explains the major mode. Ernest Britt writes:
It is in vain that the explanation of the modem scale has been sought in the physical phenomenon of the vibration of sonorous bodies. . . . This disposition of elements presents itself, in our diatonic scale, in a concrete and rigorously logical form, otherwise it could never have produced either its own synthesis, or the symphony, or the musical drama, or any of the harmonic forms that are the originality of modern music. And if the ra tionalism of the Western genius has been able to triumph over traditional mistakes, if it has been able to create a melodic and harmonic organ so complete and so perfectly adapted to the expression of human feelings, it



is no doubt because the constitution of the modem scale corresponds to some law of inner organization of psychic essence, whose imperious neces sity could only be felt at the time when the mental development of human ity was sufficiently advanced to receive its revelation and conceive of its reality.*
One could not find expressed in a more blatant form the perverted reason ing that deprives so many otherwise well-documented works of Westerners of all serious scientific value, and we wonder whether Britt would really be ready to defend the logical implications of his words. He would apparently have us believe that harmonic forms exist only in modern music, that modem Western music alone is capable of expressing human feelings, that others than Western ers are consequently either not humans or are deprived of feelings, or, if they have feelings, have no means of expressing them, that Aristotle and Sankaracharya were mentally deficient since human beings had not attained mental develop ment before modern times, that the secrets of harmony have been “revealed” to some modern Moses by a benevolentJehovah delighted at the good behavior of our contemporaries, and so on. In general the reasoning of Western scholars in relation to music could be summarized as follows: The Western scale is not correct according to the laws of physics or mathematics, but, being used by Westerners, it is superior to all others. Since it is in contradiction with physical laws, it must therefore be the expression of some superior psychic law, still unknown to us, but which is the measure of genius and progress. That such methods of reasoning could be printed and accepted certainly does not indicate that the mental development of humanity has yet attained the elements of logic, and if nobody objects to it, it is probably because the superiority of everything European is an article of faith that should not be discussed. . I hope I will be excused for criticizing so harshly these unfortunate re marks of Ernest Britt, whose works are otherwise well documented and show a real spirit of research. I do so only in the hope that we may understand how high is the wall of prejudice behind which so many Westerners are imprisoned, a prejudice that makes their reasoning absurd and out of place whenever a ques tion relating to other civilizations is involved. Unfortunately, their mistake is difficult to cure because they are not even conscious of being unfair, since they know nothing of the logical methods of discussion taught, for example, by the Indians, of which the Greeks had some idea, and which allow the criticism of arguments and the establishment of logical relations between cause and effect.
Equal Temperament
W hen a musical scale is established starting from a fundamental sound, that scale easily remains within the limits of harmonic sounds and simple propor



tions. But when, starting from another note of that scale, we try to constitute a scale or chords similar to the first one, some of the notes obtained do not coincide with those of the first scale. In order to simplify the musical problem and the construction of fixed-scale instruments, Western musicians neglect these differences and, choosing an intermediate sound, declare that the ear adapts itself to it and does not perceive the difference. All modes and chords are thus reduced to a series of twelve sounds, among which none has a correct relation to the others. But this system is not really sufficient for melody or successive harmony, nor for simultaneous harmony. Small differences of pitch may, in the case of an isolated note, appear negligible to an untrained ear. But when notes are brought together in a mode, these slight differences of pitch will bring about considerable differences in the expressive significance of the mode. Similarly, when the notes are grouped in the shape of chords, these same small differences of pitch will create beats (variations of intensity) between the sounds, which besides being unpleasant greatly diminish the significance of the chords. We cannot see exactly if one brick is slightly bigger than another, yet when we come to build we see immediately a great difference between a straight and regular wall and one where nothing is level; in the same way, even if we cannot perceive the difference between individual notes, the difference is extremely apparent between a pure chord and a chord that beats—and in the tempered scale every chord beats. If we carefully examine the structure of the modern Western musical sys tem, however vague its theory may be as described in treatises on harmony, it is not impossible to find in it the elements of a logical and coherent system. But this system is very different from the artificial tempered scale actually in use, which, while it gives some facilities of execution, has twisted the development of modem musical thought in a strange direction. The tempered scale to a considerable extent hides from us the thoughts of the great masters of the past, whose most deep and noble works can appear monotonous and childish when they are so disfigured. But this is difficult to realize, because modern people have so lost their sensitivity to simple chords and modal degrees considered in relation to a tonic that they can never believe that a single note can perfectly well create an effect that not even a massive chord can produce upon their calloused minds. Helmholtz has said, “The music based on the tempered scale must be considered as an imperfect m usic.. . . If we suppose it or even find it beautiful, it means that our ear has been systematically spoiled since childhood.”9 In the words of A. Langel, “The ear became accustomed to the continual approxima tions of temperament only at the cost of a part of its natural sensitivity.”10 Equal temperament is in no way a new thing. It has been invented many times by those half scholars who always come in to explain and improve that which they do not fully understand. In China, for example, “He Chengtian



T h e W estern S ca le a n d E qual T em p e r a m e n t ------- 133
[370-447 c.E.] and Lii Zhuo [d. 610 c.E.] opposed the system o fjin g Fang, that is, the indefinite progression of perfect fifths. They wanted to force the num bers corresponding to the lin zhong [G (Pa)], and to all the lii, so that the zhong lii [F+ (Ma+), the eleventh fifth] would again give birth to the h u ang zhong [C (Sa)], and the complete cycle be limited to twelve lii."'1 We must again repeat that it is not possible to create music with sounds that have no relation between themselves, and that the simpler the ratios be tween sounds are, the more their relation is harmonious, while the more com plicated the ratios are, the more dissonant are the sounds. This is why equal temperament is musically absurd, because it replaces the simple ratios of the notes (4/3, 5/4, 9/8, 10/9, etc.) with ratios that are near to them but are never theless extremely complicated. The ratio of the tempered half tone is something like 1,059,463,094/1,000,000,000, while the major half tone is 16/15 and the minor half tone 25/24. T he tempered intervals are therefore exceedingly disso nant and create in every chord such beats that only people whose ears are hardened by the habit of noise, or musicians who follow the musical thought so intensely that they do not hear the false notes of the instruments, can bear them. Equal temperament has had a strange effect on some of the musicians of the present generation. As they have never heard a consonant chord, they know the chords only as more or less acute dissonances, and the rules of composition of the old masters, who base everything around consonant chords, seem to them the effect of timidity and ignorance. Furthermore, as modal memory can hardly work when notes have harmonically false relations, melodies can have a signifi cance only when overcrowded with chords and accents, until they completely disappear under a heap of modulations. Still, it cannot be doubted that temperament has, along certain lines, brought out considerable developments in Western music. The newly invented modem piano was the means by which Chopin and Liszt could create an extraordinary number of new chords and modulations, and W agner could not work without his Erard. This is because this instrument allowed composers to experiment, to search for chords that they could not imagine until they had heard them. And temperament, while disfiguring all the intervals of the major mode, also opened the door to a number of other modes. These, as we have already seen, were similarly disfigured, but no more so than the major mode. Each note of the tempered scale and each tempered chord is open to numerous interpretations. The ear, of course, makes some sort of adaptation to find in it those correct intervals it can appreciate, but these adaptations can be widely different. Through this strange back door numerous modes and intervals that classical music had totally ignored have unknowingly appeared again in modem Western music. It goes without saying that if these modes and intervals were played correctly instead of being tempered, their beauty and expressive ness would be considerably intensified.



W hen this music, conceived on the piano, is to be played by an orchestra, however, a new difficulty appears: that of notation. The chords of the piano have introduced into music new intervals that accommodate themselves in some way or other to temperament. But if those chords are to be played on untempered instruments just as they are written, the result may be completely discordant. This is the case with Wagner, for example, whose music, conceived on the piano, was much more dissonant in his time, when the musicians of the orches tra made some distinction between sharps and flats, than it is nowadays when practically all musicians play in the tempered scale. The reason is that here the correct notes are no longer expressed by the written notation, and to play cor rectly would be to play what would have been written had a more complete system of notation permitted a better analysis. This brings us to the observation that Western musical notation is of such imprecision that all sorts of misunderstandings are possible. Thus musicians speak of a sharp a little higher, of a third a little larger, of a brilliant-toned or a dull-toned note, in order to be able to achieve by instinct intervals whose significance is clearly distinct, whose definitions could be found, and that are even often implied in the principles of music as described in treatises on har mony, but that Western musical notation has no way of indicating. Such impre cision in notation also explains the misrepresentation of ancient modes and Asian melodies when they are written in Western notation, not to mention Western folk music, which is also completely disfigured. The failure of modern musicians to produce any effect when they play their transcriptions of Greek or Asian modes comes from the fact that they always approach them through temperament, which disfigures their intervals and flattens their coloring, reducing practically everything to the tempered chromatic mode. W e should not forget that although it is comparatively easy to recognize a mode or melody we already know when it is played in its tempered approxi mation, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to imagine its color and ex pression if one has never heard its real intervals. Unfortunately, instead of realizing the deficiencies of their own musical notation by contact with Greek or Asian modes, many Western musicians, aided by their convenient evolutionist prejudice, prefer comfortably to consider that these modes, which they are unable to play, are “primitive,” are of little interest, and could add nothing to the achievements of modern Western music.

The N eedfo r a Scale o f Sounds
For the comparative study of different musical systems, as well as for the correct execution of each one, it is necessary to establish a scale of sounds that will allow both a clear and accurate notation of all the usual intervals and an immediate appreciation of their nature and relative value. W ith the help of an accurate notation, the reproduction of the different scales on an appropriate instrument becomes easy. , If we collect the intervals used in the different systems, we can see that their number and their combinations are not unlimited in practice. W e have seen, while studying the theory of Indian music, that the number of acoustic ratios having a distinct significance in relation to one tonic is only twenty-two. But by the permutation of that tonic, or simply by the permutation of the ratios between the different notes, the number of different sounds within one octave is raised to fifty-three principal sounds, to which are added in certain systems either six secondary ones, bringing the total division to sixty sounds, or twelve quarter tones, giving a total division of sixty-six distinct sounds. This scale can be identified with the scale of fifths if the Pythagorean comma (5.88 savarts) is assimilated to the comma diesis (81/80 = 5.4 savarts), which means an approxi mation of one hundredth of a tone. This division is by no means arbitrary. It corresponds to the ideal structure of the octave. This is why it can be established



on the basis of any one of the systems, either by the progressive raising of the notes in a series of modulations within the scale of Zarlino, or by the combina tions and permutations of the intervals necessary for melodic expression in the Indian, Arab, or ancient Greek musicians’ systems, or again, by the develop ment of the Chinese scale of fifths. In each case we get the same number of divisions. M any intervals that are musically identical can be expressed by slightly different ratios in the scale of fifths and in the scale of proportions. Such is the case for the major half tone and the apotome, which are two expressions of the same interval: one is the harmonic relation to the tonic 16/15 (major half tone), the other is the cyclic ratio 2187/2048 (apotome). Their significance—their sruti—is identical. Their measure in savarts is, for the major half tone, 28.03, and, for the apotome, 28.52, which means that their difference is scarcely one hundredth of a tone. The Pythagoreans, and later the Arab and Turkish theo rists, for mathematical reasons always1considered the cyclic interval as the cor rect one and the harmonic interval as an approximation. But musically it is the harmonic interval that is really used and that must therefore be considered as the correct one. There are, however, some intervals whose difference is so slight that the ear cannot easily detect it but whose functional difference is important; such is the case for the limma (256/243 = 22.63 savarts) and its complement to the minor tone (135/128 = 28.12 savarts: 256/243 x 135/128 = 10/9). In practice, these two intervals are identical, but their function, as we saw in connection with Indian music, is different. According to the Indian theory, one of them, 135/128, is a melodic interval (i.e., the two notes that constitute it can be played one after the other) and contains two srutis, while the other, the limma proper, 256/243, contains only one sruti and should therefore be considered only as a difference between intervals.
Three, the C yclic Number, and Five, the M odal N umber
To render the classification of intervals easier, we have represented certain in tervals with the simpler ratios in which the numerical element seven appears. From the point of view of the symbolic significance of numbers and, conse quently, from the point of view of physics, this is an error. In this world of five elements in which we live, no prime number higher than five can enter into the composition of the substance from which a melodic or harmonic relation is made. The Chinese system, the abstract scale of fifths, even refuses to go be yond the number three; all its intervals are expressed in terms of powers of two and three. The introduction of the factor of five gives us the harmonic scale, of



which the characteristic intervals are the harmonic major sixth (5/3), the har monic major third (5/4), the minor third (6/5), the major half tone (16/15 = 24/ [3 x 5]), the minor half tone (25/24 = 52/[3 x 23]), the comma diesis (81/80 = 34/ [24 x 5]), and so forth. The number five “humanizes” music. It makes music the instrument of expression no longer of abstract prototypes but of a tangible reality. T he intro duction of any higher prime number would take us beyond this reality into dangerous regions that are not within the scope of our normal perceptions and understanding. Seven is the number of the heavenly worlds as well as that of the infernal regions, and we usually have no means of knowing to which side it may lead us. The intervals that contain the element seven cannot be physically pleasant, being by definition beyond the limits of physical harmony; their magical effect too is normally beyond our control. Consequently, their use in music and its theory serves no useful purpose. We shall indicate some of them here merely as a reference and because they have been spoken of by many theorists past and present. There is a fundamental difference between the numerical substance from which the intervals are made and their subsequent grouping according to cer tain numbers for symbolic representation. The substance from which an image is made is necessarily material and cannot be anything else. Even if this image is a mere gesture, it comes necessarily within the limitation of space—that is, of ether, the fifth element. But although it is material in its substance, this image can be used to represent things that are not within the limits of the elements. In the case of sounds, therefore, the substance—that is, the numerical ratios from which the sounds take their existence—must be limited to the num bers that are those of nature, of physical reality. On the other hand, once the notes have been built on the basis of their natural ratios, they can be grouped according to nonphysical numbers and thus become the symbols or the images of supernatural reality. The seven-note scale is thus taken to symbolize the transcendental role of music. The number five is the highest prime number used in harmonic intervals. Similarly, in the scale of fifths, we cannot go melodically beyond the fourth ascending or descending fifth, which is in either case the fifth sound. This leads naturally to the scale of nine sounds, which is the most extensive simple melodic scale possible in any music, scales of more than nine sounds being necessarily mixtures of scales. In reality, the completely manifested scale has only seven sounds, because in the scale of fifths only three successive fifths remain within the limits of the third power, beyond which we go out of this world’s extension. But because the fourth and the fifth can function as subsidiary tonics, this limit is pushed back



by one more step. Thus appears the scale of nine sounds, the absolute basis of the structure of all music. W hen we build a series of four ascending and four descending fifths on the tonic, we obtain a series of nine sounds, which consti tutes the first element of the universal harmonic scale. The four ascending fifths are:
1) G (Pa) = 3/2
3) A+ (Dha+) = 27/16
T he next fifth would be:
5) B+ (Ni+) = 243/128 = 278.14 savarts,
T his last fifth forms with C (Sa) a Pythagorean limma (256/243), which con flicts with the slightly larger and softer harmonic limma formed by the B+ (Ni+) whose ratio is 256/135 = 277.91 savarts, the origin of which is explained below. In the series of fifths, intervals beyond the fourth fifth (81/64) are, in theory as well as in practice, not acceptable harmonically. T he four descending fifths are:
1) F (Ma) = 4/3 2) B |, (NiL+) = 16/9
3) E(, (GaL) = 32/27 4) A\, (DhaL) = 128/81.
T he next fifth would be:
5) Dl, (ReL-) = 256/243 = 22.63 savarts.
Preferable to this last fifth is the slightly larger harmonic limma 135/128 = 23.12 savarts, which is the fourth fifth of the harmonic A (Dha) = 5/3. In both the ascending and the descending series, the next fifth (the sixth fifth) would give the prohibited augmented fourth, FII (M a tivra). The augmented fourth in the ascending series is
FI (MaL+) = 729/512,
while the augmented fourth in the descending series is
FI (MaL-) = 1024/729.
The interval between these two augmented fourths constitutes the Pythagorean comma (312/219), the extreme limit of physical harmonies. If we now consider the simplest ratio in which the number five appears in the numerator, we find it to be the A natural (Dha) = 5/3. The four ascending fifths built on this A natural (mddha Dha) are:
1) E (Ga) = 5/4 2) B (Ni) = 15/8
3) FI (MaL-) = 45/32 4) D[, (ReL-) = 135/128.
2) D (Re) = 9/8
4) E+ (Ga+) = 81/64.



The next fifth would be B t (NiL-) = 1280/729. T he four descending fifths are:
1) D - (Re-) = 10/9 2) ^ (pa_} = m m
3) C - (Sa-) = 160/81 4) p_ (M a-) = 320/243.
The simplest ratio in which the number five enters as denominator is the harmonic minor third: E t (Ga t ) =6/5. The four ascending fifths built upon it
are:
I
1) Bt (N il,) = 9/5 3) C+ (Sa+) = 81/80
The four descending fifths are:
1) At (Dhal,) = 8/5
3) FI (MaL+) = 64/45
2) F+ (Ma+) = 27/20
4) G+ (Pa+) = 243/160.
I
2) Dt (Re),) = 16/15
4) B+ (Ni+) = 256/135. If to these two series we add the two series that contain the square of five,
we have, on the basis respectively of II
FI (M at) = 36/25 and FI (Mai) = 25/18, !.
two further complementary series. Ascending from F I (M at) we have: I
1) Di, (Ret) = 27/25
3) E— (Ga—) = 243/200 I
Descending from FI (Mat) we have:
1) B++ (Ni++) = 48/25
3) A++ (Dha++) = 128/75
Ascending from FI (Mai) we have:
1) Dt (ReI) = 25/24 I
3) Et (Gal) = 75/64 »
Descending from FI (Ma I) we have
2) A— (Dha—) = 81/50
4) B— (Ni—) = 729/400.
2) E++ (Ga++) = 32/25
4) D+ (Re+) = 256/225.
2) At (Dhal)
4) B t (NiL-) =
=25/16
225/128.
1) B - (N i-) = 50/27
3) A - (Dha-) = 400/243 2) E - (Ga-) = 100/81
4) D— (Re—) = 800/729. This completes the universal harmonic scale that we had already been using, and whose intervals are shown in figure 16. We should note here that the cyclic scale is called the scale of fifths because its basic interval happens to be the fifth successive note of the modern diatonic scale. But this unimportant peculiarity, in a scale arbitrarily chosen as basic scale, does not imply that this interval in any way connected with the number five. This confusion has led to the complete failure of many recent attempts to

explain the symbolism of scales and chords by considering the interval of the fifth as representative of the number five. In reality, the interval of the fifth corresponds to the number three, its ratio being 3/2, and nowhere in the scale of fifths does the numerical element five appear. T he numerical element five is essentially represented by the minor and major thirds, whose respective ratios are 6/5 and 5/4.
S im ilarities between the S cale o f Fifths and the Scale o f Proportions
By the system of harmonic proportions, as well as by that of the scale of fifths, we obtain a division of the octave into fifty-three intervals. But those intervals do not coincide exacdy, because the notes of the scale of fifths divide the octave regularly into Pythagorean commas, while the notes of the scale of proportions divide it into commas diesis, with a slight discontinuity at every half tone. The intervals of these two similar scales are expressed by different ratios, one using the exact cyclic ratios and the other the simpler harmonic ratios. In musical practice it is the harmonic ratios that are correct, but the question of differen tiation can scarcely arise because these two ratios are so near to each other that it is almost impossible to differentiate them directly. It is nevertheless easy to recognize them by the implications of the system to which they belong. This means that although it is difficult to find out to which system each individual sound belongs, a succession of a few sounds will at once show whether the system is modal or cyclic. But this unity in the structure of the scales of sounds, though it is inherent in the very nature of sounds (the different systems being only more or less approximate means to express in terms of gross reality the metaphysical prin ciples of sound), does not mean by implication that the laws regulating the different systems can be identical, nor that we can go from one to the other without difficulty. The same note can play a completely different role in the different systems, as is the case of the fourth F (Ma), for example, which forms with the tonic an essential interval (4/3) in the modal system, but which in the cyclic system is only the fifty-second fifth and thus forms a very distinct relation. Even then the cyclic fourth is never absolutely correct. In a similar way, the sixth fifth, Fit (M a tivra), is the tritone, which is an essential interval in the scale of fifths but has to be cautiously handled in modal music. Furthermore, if the intervals are used melodically, small differences that appear insignificant in the scale of sounds may, added to one another, result in a difference of m iti. In other words, we can say that although the scales of the two systems have the same number of steps, the melodies will not use those steps in the same order.

Rem arks on the Scale o f Sounds
T he division of the octave into fifty-three intervals, in the harmonic and the cyclic systems, is given in figure 17. The frequencies are given according to the scale of the physicists: C (Sa) = powers of two, A 3(Dha) = 426.6 Hz. To obtain the French pitch (A =435), the scale must be raised by more than one comma; for the American high pitch (A =453), the scale should be raised by a little over one limma. If we want to experiment with all the theoretical intervals indicated by the ancient Greek physicists, these intervals can, with a sufficiently close approxi mation, be replaced by the neighboring intervals of the scale presented here without having their expression perceptibly disfigured. This scale plays a role opposite to that of temperament in regard to the scale of the Greek physicists; that is to say, it brings the intervals back to their harmonic prototype, while temperament disharmonizes the harmonic sounds. Furthermore, most of the intervals invented by the physicists are interesting only as attempts to represent the true intervals, their ratios often being meaningless by themselves. According to Indian theory, all the sounds contained in the twenty-second part of an octave have the same general expressive quality, and are differentiated only by more or less fullness and intensity. In musical practice, the following assimilations are acceptable:
1) The comma diesis, 81/80 (5.4 savarts), can be assimilated to the Pythagorean comma, V2/2,v (5.88 savarts).
2) The double comma, 128/125 (10.3 savarts), can be assimilated to 46/45 (9.55 savarts), 6561/6400 (10.79 savarts), 512/499 (11.17 savarts), 499/486 (11.46 savarts), and 250/243 (12.33 savarts).
3) T he quarter tone (14 savarts) can be assimilated to 31/30 (14.84 savarts) and 32/31 (13.79 savarts).
4) The minor half tone, 25/24 (17.73 savarts), can be assimilated to ratios between 28/27 (51.8 savarts) and 24/23 (18.48 savarts).
5) T he limma, 256/243 (22.63 savarts), can be assimilated to 20/19 (22.30 savarts) and to 135/128 (23.12 savarts).
6) The major half tone, 16/15 (28.03 savarts), can be assimilated to the apotome, 2187/2048 (28.52 savarts).
7) T he large half tone, 27/25 (33.32 savarts), can be assimilated to 14/13 (32.19 savarts).
As we have seen, the limma (256/243) is properly speaking merely the complement of the apotome (2187/2048) within the major tone (9/8). It is therefore a complementary interval in the ascending scale, but a direct interval in the descending (ancient) one. An interval of one limma separates C (Sa) from



B+ (Ni+), which is the fifth fifth of the cyclic series; the same interval separates the second fifth D (Re) from the seventh fifth C l (ReL+). This is because a difference of five fifths always produces a limma. In the ascending scale is found the limma 135/128 (23.12 savarts), which is equivalent to the forty-eighth fifth (23.48 savarts). To study and produce all these different intervals, and to accustom the ear to them, it is necessary to have an instrument allowing their accurate execution.1 The simplest is, of course, a stringed instrument of sufficient dimensions, such as the Indian sitar, with easily movable frets and with the exact place of the srutis marked along the slide on which the frets move. To mark these places we should remember that the string length ratios refer to the string shortened without pulling or pressing. If the finger presses the string on the fret, the tension is increased and therefore the place of the fret must be accordingly corrected. This rectification is easy to do by tuning two strings in unison at the correct pitch. One of the strings is then lightly pinched with light wood or metal tongs, without pulling or pressing it, leaving free the portion of string corresponding to the desired note. The fret is then adjusted until the second string, pressed upon the fret, comes into perfect unison with the first string. A mark is then made on the wood so that the fret may be easily and exactly replaced whenever the same note is desired. This must be done for each note of the scale, so that the whole length of the instrument becomes marked and by changing the place of the frets the correct tuning for each mode can be obtained.
C on clu sion s
We have found that according to traditional data as well as experimental facts:
1) The division of the octave into fifty-three intervals is in conformity with the nature of sounds.
2) The intervals used in all music and at all times are only the major tone, the minor tone, the major half tone (apotome), and the limma, together with the intervals resulting from their sum or difference (the minor half tone, for example, is the difference of the minor tone and the major half tone). These, by their different combinations, produce the scale of fifty-three sounds.
3) Any other intervals would not bring out a distinct expressive quality, and would in any case be less consonant. Their use is therefore without interest.
4) Within one octave we cannot discern more than twenty-two groups of sounds having distinct expressive qualities. The division of the octave into fifty-three intervals is only necessary to make these twenty-two different expressions coincide with perfect harmonic relations in the different modes.



5) All twenty-two divisions cannot be used simultaneously in a mode, or in any melodic or harmonic combination. At the most twelve, and at the least three notes are used, the normal number being seven.
In all the traditional modal systems, the intervals used musically are the same. T he various divisions of the octave differ only because some methods take into account a greater number of intervals. Thus the notes of the pentatonic scale are five of the notes of the heptatonic scale, which can in turn be identified with seven of the degrees of the twelve-note scale, which are themselves twelve of the notes of the Arabic division into seventeen notes, which are identical to seventeen of the twenty-two srutis, all of which which belong to the scale of fifty-three sounds. This scale can further be extended up to sixty sounds, be yond which we are no longer within the field of music.

The purpose of the repetition of such formulas is to produce a harmonization of diverse elements of being and to establish vibrations able, by their repercussion across the series of stages in indefi nite hierarchy, to open some communication with superior stages, which is, as a rule, the essential and primordial purpose of every rite” (Guenon, “La Langue des oiseaux,” p. 670).

8. If in a given mode, without changing any of the notes, we start the scale from a note other than the original tonic, the scale thus obtained is called a plagal form of the original mode.
9. A striking difference between the structure of the cyclic system and that of the modal system is that the one normally forms an ascending scale and the other normally a descending one. This allows us to distinguish at first sight to which family a system originally belonged. Since by its very struc ture the cycle of fifths forms an ascending series, the intermediary notes between the tones of each tetrachord will be sharpened (tivra). On the other hand, modes normally form descending scales, and so the interme



diate notes will be flattened (komal). This can be seen in Indian and Chi nese music, respectively.

Among the musical terms that met with some change of meaning in their passage from Sanskrit to Chinese can be noted the Sanskritpancham a (fifth note), which becomes in Chinese banzhan but is used for the sixth note, and the Sanskrit rishabha, meaning “a bull” and representing the second (ascending) degree, which becomes in Chinese xulizha, meaning “sound of the bull” and representing the seventh degree, or second descending degree. Instruments were also imported into China from India and Per sia, such as the Indian tam bura, which the Chinese call tabula, or the Per sian sitar, which becomes satuoer.
16. “W hich implies that four, immediately produced by three, is in a certain way equivalent to the entire set of numbers; and this is so because, as soon as we have the quaternary, we also have, by the addition of the four first numbers, the denary, which represents the complete numerical cycle: 1 + 2 + 3+ 4 = 1 0 .

6. These elemental principles must not be imagined, like the elements of modern Western science, to be definite chemical substances or states of such substances (liquid, solid, etc.). All chemical substances are a combi nation of the five elements, though their relative proportion may vary. Rene Guenon explains that “the cause of sound abides in the ether, but it must be understood that this cause is to be differentiated from the various media that can be used secondarily for the propagation of so und.. . . The sound quality is also perceptible in the four other elements insofar as they



all proceed from ether” (Guenon, “La Theorie hindoue,” p. 327).
7. “[That sound is produced] by vibratory movem ent. . . is far from being a recent discovery, as some might believe; Kanada expressly declares that ‘sound is propagated by undulations, wave after wave, radiating in all di rections from a definite center.’ Sound . . . is the least differentiated of all movements because of its ‘isotropism.’ And this is why it can give birth to all the other movements, which will be differentiated from it in that they will no longer be uniform nor spread in all directions.. . . Thus ether . . . has for its origin an elementary movement produced from an initial point in this limitless cosmic medium . . . this is nothing other than the proto type of the sound wave. T he sense of hearing, moreover, is the only one that allows us to perceive directly a vibratory movement, even if we admit, with most modern physicists, that the other sensations originate from a transformation of similar movements” (ibid., p. 327).

35. On tempered instruments these different feelings will become clear only when the structure of the underlying chord imposes the interpretation of the particular third either as a harmonic third or as a ditone. Tempered instruments can therefore be used only for harmonic music, provided the structure of the chords is specially built to make up for their deficiencies, but their use in modal music is impossible because the feeling of the notes remains indeterminate and therefore without appeal.
36. More ancient works such as the Sangita makaranda use different names and start from another tonic. Many questions have been raised concern ing the interpretation of the srutis as given by Sarngadeva, because of the change of tonic that has since taken place. As we are attempting to give only a general idea of the method through which the study of scales should be approached, we cannot enter here into a discussion of such difficult questions, which are dealt with at length in my Sem antique musicale.

51. T he use in Indian music of the augmented fourth, or tritone, at the criti cal times of midnight and midday reminds us of the magical importance attached to those hours, and of the use of the tritone (diabolus in musica) by Western musicians for the representation of magic, which is nothing other than the possible intersection, at certain critical hours, of worlds that can not norm ally communicate. It is used conspicuously in this way by Schumann for the character of Manfred, by W agner every time a magi cian appears, by Berlioz in the Symphonie fantastique, by Weber in D er Freischutz, and so on. In Chinese music the lii m i bin, corresponding to the augmented fourth, represents the summer solstice, the critical mo ment in the annual cycle when the masculine influx, hot and creative, gives place to the feminine influx, cold and destructive.

1. Only scales and modes come within the scope of this book. As these are greatly simplified today in the West, modern Western music will have only a small place in this work. T he modal division of the scale as applied to the study of the significance of chords will not be dealt with here, but is covered in more detail in my Sem antique musicale.

Chapter 8
1. In accordance with the scale of sounds described herein, Stephan Kudelski, the designer of the Nagra tape recorder, constructed a prototypical in strument, the S 52, capable of playing fifty-two divisions of the octave with absolute precision. Another instrument, the Semantic, also based on Danielou’s scale of sounds, is currently being developed by two French technicians, Michel Geiss and Christian Braut. W hereas the S 52 was con ceived mainly for the study and measurement of intervals, the Semantic is designed for the performance of musical compositions exploiting the re sources of the scale of sounds. —Editor
