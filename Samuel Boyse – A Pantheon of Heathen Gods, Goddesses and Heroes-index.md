PREFACE.
WiE have here no defign to raife the repu
tation of this work, by depreciannsr the many others that have already been pubhihed on this fubjed ; it is fufficient for us to fay, that we have followed a plan entirely new, and, at ihe fame time, fuch an one as appeared to us much more ufeful, more rational, and lefs dry thau any that has gone before it.
As all works of this kind muft necelTarily confift of materials colleded from other authors, no ex pence, no labour has been fpared; the mod celebrated works on this fubject have been confulted and compared with each other, and it has frequently happened, that fcattered hints, widely difperfed, have ferved to clear up the moll difficult and intricate meanings, to a degiee of demonftration; but amongft all the authors to which we have had recourfe, we mufl here parr ticularly acknowledge the great advantage we have received from that ingenious gentleman, the Abbe Pluche, in his biftory of the heavens. But



viii PREFACE.
But ns that learned anJ valuable writer feem: now and then to have carried nnatters a little too far» the reader will find lefs ufe made of him
than in the firfl: edition. We have been careful to allow all things ;o evidence and reafon ; but
as little as mi^^ht be to conje6ture. We have aifo r-^ceived fome ufeful hints from the Abbe B.uiicr's mythologv. But it behoves us efpecially, to ack.no wledt^e the great fervice which we have received from the writings of the learned Bochart, Pignorius, Cafalius, Kircher, I '-^(ius, Montfau9on, and others, who have profe. " to treat of the Phoenician, Fgyptian, Greek, a Roman antiquliics.
Some acquaintance with the heathen gods and the ancient fables, is a necelTary branch of polite learning, as without this it is impoiTible to obtain a competent knowledge of the Claillcs ; impoffible to form a judgment of antique medals, ftatues, or paintings; or even to underftand the performances of the moderns in thefe polite arts.
Hence thefe ftudies have been generally efteemed neceOTary for the improvement of youth; but in works of this kind, fufficient care has not been taken to unfold the origin of the heathen gods, which has generally been rciftaken. Some imagining that they had been kings and princes ; others, that they were the various parts of nature; and others, that they were the patriarchs and heroes of th.e Jewil"h nation. But each of ihefe b-ive been found equally contrary to truth, when applied to the pagan theology, though fome of the r fables have been embclliflied with rr.any circum^ar.^e: relaced iu the Mofaic biftory. In worlLS



PREFACE. )X
works of this kind, no care has hitherto been taken to give the leaft intimation of abundance of circumllanccs neceflary to be known; and a perfon reads the hiftory of the gods without finding any thing added, that can help him to unravel the myfleries he meets v/ith in every page, or to entertain the leaft idea of the religion of their worOiippers.
The Greeks were entiiely ignorant as to the origin of their god-, and incapable of . tranfmitting their hiflory to pofterity. Herodotus informs us, that the gods of llie Greeks were originally brought from Kgypt and Phoenicia, where they had been the objeBs of religious worfhip before any colonies from thefe countries fettled
in Greece. We ought then to fearch in Egypt and Phoenicia for the origin of the gods ; for the gods whofe worfhip was chiefly promoted by the Egyptians, and carried by the Phoenicians over all the coafts of the world then known. The firft Egyptians, unacquainted with letters, gave all the informations to the people, all the rules of their cordu<Sl, by erecting figures, eafily uiiderAood, and which fervid as rules and orders neceffary to regulate their behaviour, and as advertifements to provide for their own fafety. A very few figures diverlified by what they held in their hands, or carried on their heads, were fufficient for this purpofe. Thefe were ingenious contrivances, and, fuch as were abfolutely neceffary in a country, were the leaft miftake in point ©f time was fufBcient to ruin all their affairs.
But

Hut thefe Egyptian fymbots, giving way to the eafy method of reaping inftruftion from the ufe of letters, which were afterwards introduced, foon became obfolete, and the memory of foiie particular virtues ftill remaining, they were revered as the images or reprefentations of fuperior and friendly beings, who had frequently delivered ihein from impending dangers, and foon were vvor{hipped as the gods of iheir fathers. Their hirtorits were wrote in verfe, and embellifhed with fictions founded on ancient traditions. The p;ie(is of oifFerent cour.tries increafed the delufion ; they had read the Mofaic hi (lory, or at least, h ' d heard that the fons of God had converfation with ihe daughters of men, and from hence, nHuenced by lufl or avarice, cloaked ihfcir own debaucheries, and fometimes thofe of princes and great men, under tho'e of a god; and (he poer^ whenever a princefs failed m point of modcfty, h;ad recou'fe to the fame method, in order to (holier her reputation frojn vulgar cenfure. By this mean:, the deities in after times were faid to live in various countries, and even in far diftant ages. Thus there became three htmdied Jupirers, an opinion derived from there being a number of places in which, in dilferent a^^es, Jupiter was faid to have lived, reigned, and perfor;ned fomeextraordinai y a<^ions, which ancient fable*-, the fiQ:ions of the poets, and the artifices of the piiefis had rendered famous. But r.oiwiiliiland ni^ all liiefe fahle?, Jupiter was always acknowledged by the wi'efl: heathens to be impeccable, immortal, the aurhor of life, the uni~ vcifal creator, and ihe fountain of goodnefs.

This fcheme is here carried on and explained with refpeft to each heathen deity, and added to the common hiftories and fables of the gods and goddefles.
In the (hort Differtation on the Theology of the Ancients, w^ have (hewn the rife of idolatrv, and its conne6lion with the ancient fymbcls. We have there exhibited the fentiments of the Pagans with regard to the unity of the deity, and the perfe^lions they afcribe to him, from the concurrent teftimony of the philofophers in various ages, amongd the Egyptians, Greeks and Romans. And the whole is concluded with a fhort account of the progrefs of idolatry.
In the Diflertation on the Mythology of the Ancients, we have endeavoured to account for the rife of a variety of fables from the licence of poetry, embellifhing the common incidents of life, by perfonating inanimate beings, introducing fic
titious charaSers, and fupernaiural agents. Wc have given the hiftory of the creation of the world, the ftate of innocence, the fali of man, the univerfal deluge, &c. according to the traditions of difirerent nations, and the opinions of the poets and moft eminent philofophers, and compared them with the account given by A-lofe?. In (hort, we have here given a view of their religious, as well as moral fentiments.
To the whole is added, by way of Appendix, a rational account of the various fuperftitious obfervancesof aftrology, and the manner by which influences and powers became afcribed to the figns

OF CHAOS,
H
E S I O D, the firft author of the fabulous fyftem of the creation, begins his genealogy of the gods with chaos. Incapable of conceiving how fomething could be produced from nothing, he aflerted the eternity of matter, and imagined to himfeJf a
confufed mafs lying in the womb of nature, which contained the principles of all beings, and which afterwards rifing by degrees into order and harmony, at length produced the univerfe. Thus the Heathen poets endeavoured to account for the origin of the
world ; of which they knew fo little, that it is no wonder they difguiftd rather than iiluftrated the fub
je(5l in their writings. We find Virgil reprefenting Chaos as one of the infernal deities, and Ovid, at his firft fetting out in the Metamorphofis, or transformation of the Gods, giving a very poetical pidure of
that diforderly ftate in which all the elements lay blended without order or diftindion. It is eafy to fee, wnder all this confufion and perplexity, the remaini

of truth ; the ancient tradition of the creation being obIcLired with a multiplicity of images and allegories, became an inexhaiiftible fund for fidion to improve upon, an fv/elled the heathen theology into an unmeafurable compafs : fo that, in this fenfe. Chaos may indeed be properly fliled the father of the Gods. Thcugh it does not feem eafy to give a pidure, or •-vaih cal reprefentation of Chaos, a modern painter (i) has been fo bold to attempt it. Beyond the clouds, which compofe the body of his piece, he has reprefcnted an immenfe abyfs of darknefs, and in the clouds an odd medly of water, earth, fire, fmoke, winds, &c. But he has unluckily thrown the figns of the Zodiac into his work, and thereby fpoiled his whole defign. Our great Milton in a noble and mafterly manner has painted the ftate in v/hich matter lay before the creation.

was born at Bois le Due, and for fome time ftudied under
Peter Paul Rubens. M. Meyferts, in his book entitled Des
Images des Pe'mtres, gives him the charadcr of a great artift,
cfpecially in painting on glafs. The piece above mentioned has been confidered by moft people as a very ingenious jumblr,

had by him a numerous offspring, among whom were Oceanus, Casus, Creus, Hyperion, Japhet, Theia, Rhea, Themis, Mnemofyne, Phcebe, Tethys, Saturn, the three cyclops, viz. Brontes, Steropes, and Arges ; and the giants Cottes, Gyges, and Briareus. Terra, however, was not fo ftridly bound by her conjugal vow, for by Tartarus flie had Typhaeus, or Typhon, the great enemy of Jupiter. Caelus having, for fome offence, imprifoned the cyclops, his wife, to revenge herfelf, incited her fon Saturn, who by her afliflance took the opportunity to caflrate his father with an inftrument ihe furnifhed him with. The blood of the wound produced the three furies, the giants
and the wood nymphs. The genital parts, which fell into the fea, impregnating the waters, formed Venu?;, the moft potent and charming of the goddefles. According to Lactantius, C^lus was an ambitious and mighty prince, who, affecfting grandeur, called himfelf the/o« ofthejky ; which title his fon Saturn alfo afiumed in his turn. But Diodorus makes Uranus the firit monarch of the Atlantides, a nation Inhabiting the the weftern coafl of Africa, and famous for commerce and hofpitality. From his fkill in aflronoirr/, the Jlarry hea'vens were called by his name, and for his equity and beneficence he was denominated king of the uni'verfe. Nor was his queen Titea lefj cfieemed
for her wifdom and goodnefs, which after her death procured her the honour of being deified by the nrane of Terrfl. She is reprefented in the fame manner a.,

flie married Hyperion her brother, to whom flie bore Helios and Selene (the fun and moon), as alfo a fecond daughter, called Aurora (or the morning) ; but the brothers of Theia confpiring againfl her hufband, caufed him to be aflafiTmated, and drowned her fon Helios in the river Eridanus (2). Selene, who was extremely fond of her brother, on hearing his fate, precipitated herfelf from a high tower. They were both raifed to the fkies, and Theia, after wandering diftracled, at laft difappeared in a ftorm of thunder and lightning. After her death the confpirators di\ided the kingdom. Hiflorians fay, that Hyperion was a famous aftronomer, who, on account of his difcovering the motions of the celeftial bodies, and particularly the two 5;rcat luminaries of heaven, was called the father of thofe planets.

OF* OCEANUS AND TETHY3,
1 H I S deity was one of the eldeft fons of Caslus and Terra, and married his filter Tethys, befides
whom he had feveral other wives. Each of them pof
fefled an hundred woods and as many rivers. By Te
thys he had Ephyre, who was matched to Epime
theus, and Pleione the wife of Atlas. He had feveral other daughters and fons, whofe names it would be endlefs to enumerate, and indeed they are only thofe of the principal rivers of the world.
Two of the wives of Oceanus were Pamphyloge
and Parthenope. By the firft he had two dsughters*
Afia and Lybia ; and by the laft, two more called
Europa and Thracia, who gave their names to the
countries fo denominated. He had alfo a daughter,
called Cephyra, who educated Neptune, and three fons, viz. Triptolemus, the favourite of Ceres, Ne
reus, who prefided over fait waters, and Achelous, the deity of fountains and rivers.
The

T li E H E A T li E N G O D S. 3
The ancients, regarded Cceanus as the father o
'
j;ods and men, on account of the ocean's encompafiing the earth with its waves, and becaufe he was the principle of that radical moiitiire ditTufed through iinivtrial matter, \^ilhout which, according to Thalct:, nothing could either be produced or fubiifc. Homer makes Juno vilit him at the rtmotefl limits of the eartli , and acknowledge him and Tethys as the parents of the gods, adding that Hie herfelf had been brought up under their tuition, Oceanus was depided with a bull's head, to reprefent the rage and bellowing of the ocean when agi?lated by ftorms.
CHAP. V.
OF AURORA AND TITHONUS.
We have already obferved, that this goddefs wa»
the youngeft daughter of Hyperion and Theia.--By the Greeks Ihe was ftyled ni? ; and by the Latins Aurora, on account of her bright or golden colour, and the dew which attends her. Orpheus calls her the harbinger of Titan, becaufe the dawn befpeaks the approach of the Sun ; others make her the daughter of Titan and the earth. She fell in love with a beautiful youth named Cephalus, (whom fome fup
pofe to be the fame with the fun) by whom flie had
Phaeton. She had alfo an amour with Orion, whom file firft faw a hunting in the woods, and carried him with her to Dclos. By Aftreas her hufband one of the Titans, {lie had the fuars, and the four winds, Argeflus, Zephyrus, Boreas, and Notus. But
her greateft favourite was Tithonus, to whom flie
bore ^mathion and Memnon. This young Prince' iiie tranfported to Delos, thence to JEthiopia, and laft into Heaven, where flie obtained for him, from the deltinies, the gift of immortality ; but at the fame time forgot to add youth, which alone could render the prefent valuable. Tithonus grew old, andfodecrepid as to be rocked to fleep like an infant. His Huftrefs, not being able to procure death, to end his mifery



6 FABULOUS HISTORY OF
mifery changed him into a grafs hoppfr ; an infcdl which by caftingits Ikin renews its youth, and in its chirping Hill retains the loquacity of old age. The hiftorians fay, that Tithonus was a great improver of aftronomy, and iifcd to ride before morning to make his obfervations. They add, that his vigilance and temperance were rewarded with a long life ; but when the infirmities of old age came on at laft, Aurora, by the help of oriental drugs, reftored him to health and vigour. Thus have they done juftice to the falubrity of the morning. This prince i« laid to have reigned in Media, where he founded the city of Sufa on the river Choafpes, which became afterwards the feat of the Perfian Empire. The ftory of Cephalus is related differently. He was the nephew of -fl^olus, and had married Procris, daughter of Erichtheus, king of Athens. Aurora feeing him often early in the woods, intent on his fport, conceived a violent paflion for him, and carried him with her to Heaven, where fhe in vain ufed all her arts to engage him to violate his conjugil vow. The prince, as fond of his wife as the goddefs was of him, remained inexorably faithful. Aurora therefore, to undeceive him, fent him to Procris in the difguife of a merchant, to tempt her conftancy by large prefents : this artifice fucceeded, and juft when his fpoufe was on the point of yielding, the unhappy hufband difcovcred himfelf, and Procris fled to the woods to hide her fhame. But being afterwards reconciled, fhe made Cephalus a prefent
of an unerring dart. A prefent like this increafed his inclination to hunting, and proved doubly fatal to the donor. It happened the .young prince, one day, v>'earied with his toil, fat down in the v^'oods, and called for Aurora, or the gentle breeze, to cool him (3):
this being overheard, was carried to Procris, who, though inconftant, was woman enough to be jealous
:
influenced by this paflion, flie followed her hufband, and concealed herfelf in a thicket, where flie could obferve his motions. Unluckily the noife flie made alarmed her huflt>and, who thinking fome wild btaft lay

There U no goddefs of whom we have fo many beautiful defcriptions in the poets as Aurora. Indeed it is no wonder they are luxuriant on this fubied, as there is perhaps no theme in nature which affords fuch an extenfive field for poetry or painting as the varied beauties of the morning, whofe approach feems to cxhilirate and enliven the whole animal creation.
CHAP. VI.
OF ATLAS.
x\.TLAS was the fon of Japetus and Clymenc, and the brother of Prometheus. In the divifion of his father's dominions, Mauritania fell to his Ihare, where he gave his own name to that mountain, which ftill bears it. As he was greatly fkrlled in Aftronom.y,, he became the firft inventor of the fpliere, which gave rife to the fable, of his fupporting the heavens on his ihoulders. He had many children. Of his fons the rnoft famous was Hefperus, (Tooke calls him his brother,



« FABULOUS HISTORY OF
ther, p. 325) who reigned fome time in Italy, which
from him v/as called Hefperia. It is faid, this prince ijeing on mount Atlas to obferve the motion of the ftars, was carried away by a tempeft, and, in honour to his memory, the morning ftar was afterwards called by his name. He left three daughters, iEgle, Arethui;4, and Hefperithufa, who went by the general appellation of Hcfperides, and were poflefled of thofe famous gardens which bore golden fruit, and were guarded by the vigilance of a formidable dragon. Atlas had feven daughters, called after his own name Atlaotides, viz. Maia, Eledra, Taygete, Afterope, Merope, Alcyone, and Celteno. All thefe were matched
cither to gods or heroes, by whom they left a numerous pofterity. Thefe from their mother Pleione, were alfo ftiled Pleiades (4). Bufiris, king of Egypt, carried them off by violence ; but Herculer, travelling through Africa, conquered him, and delivering the
Princelfes, reftored them to their father, who to requite his kindnefs taught him aftronomy, v.'hence arofe the fable, of that hero's fupporting the heavena for a day to cafe Atlas of his toil. The Pleladcf , how
ever, endured a ncv/ perfecution from Orion who purfued them five years, till Jove, prevailed on by their prayers, took them up into the heavens, where they form the conftellation, which bears their name. By iEthra, Atlas v/as the father of feven daughters, called Ambrofia, Endora, Pafithce, Coronir, Plexa
ris, Pytho, and Tyche, who bore one common appellation of the Hyades (5). Thefe virgin? grieved fo immoderately for the death of their brother Hya?, devoured by a lion, that Jupiter, out cf ccmpaflion, -changed them into liars, and placed them in the head of Taurus, wliere they (till retain their grief, their riung and fetting being attended with extraordinary rain- Others rnake thefe laft the daughters of Lycurges, born in the ille of Naxos, and tranllated to the fities, for their care in the education of Bacchus, probably becaufe thefe fliowers are of great benefit in forwarding the vintage.
(4) So call'd from a Greek word, -which fignifies failing
;
beeaufe they were reckoned favourable to navigation. (5) From the Greek verb to rain, the Latins called them
lucuix, from the Greek rr.s, or fwine, becaufe they feemed te delight in wet and dirty wer.ther^



T H E HEATHEN GOD S. 9
According to. Hyginus, Atlas having affifted the giants in their war againft Jupiter, was by the vicftorious god doomed, as a punilhment, to fuftain the weight of the heavens. Ovid gives a very different account of A.tlas, who,
as he fays, was the fon of Japetus and Afia. He reprefents him as a powerful and wealthy monarch, proprietor of the gardens vv'^hich bore golden fiuit ; but tells us, that being v/arned by the oracle of Themis, that he fhould fuffer fome great injury from a fon of Jupiter, he ftridly forbad all foreigners accefs to his court or prefence. Perfeus, however, had the courage to appear before him, but was ordered to retire, with ftrong menaces in cafe of difobedience. But the hero prefenting his fliield with the dreadful head of Medufo to him, turned him into the mountain which ftills bears his name. The Abbe La Pluche has given a very clear and ingenious explication of thii! fable. Of all nations the Egyptians had, with the greateft afliduity, cultivated
aftronomy. To point out the difficulties which attend the ftudy of this fcience, they reprefented it by an image, bearing a globe or fphere on its back, and which they called Atlas, a word Hgm^ylng (6) great
toil or labour. But the word alfo fignif/ing fupport (7), the Phsnicians, led by the reprefentation, took it in this laft fenfe ; and in their voyages lo Mauritania, feeing the high mountains of that country covered with fnow, and lohng their tops in the cloud^, gave them the name of Atlas, and "io produced the fable, by which the fymbol of aftronomy ufed araon^ the Egyptians, became a Mauritanian-king, transformed into a mountain, whofe head fupports the hejvens. The reft of the fable is equally eafy to account for.
The annual inundations of the Nile obliged that people to be very exa(5l in obferving the motions of the heavenly bodies. The Hyades or Huades,
took their name £ om the fi8:ure V which they form in
B 5 tht
(6) From Talaah, to ftrive, comes Atlii'i, toil ; whence ch.e Greeks derived their aurAj.: or labour, and the Romans txa.itlo, to furm:)unt great difficulties. (7) From Telah, to fufpend, is derived Atlah, fupport, whence the Greek woi^d Et)5X, for column or piliar.



lo FA^RULOUS HISTORY OF
the head of Taurus. The Pleiades were a remarkable conftellation, and of great ufe to the Egyptians in regulating the feafons. Hence they became the daugh

He was a powerful and haughty prince, who lived fo long that his age became a proverb. Before the war
he had a daughter, called Anchiale, who founded a

the chief of whom were Atlas, (mentioned in the preceding chapter) Buphagus, Prometheus (9), and
Epimetheus. Of thefe, Prometheus became remarkable, by being the object of Jupiter's refentment. The occafion is related thus : having facrificed two bulls to that deity, he put all the flefli of both in one Ikin, and the bones in the other, and gave the god his choice, whofe wifdom for once failed him fo, that he pitched upon the worft lot. Jupiter, incenfed at the trick put upon him, took away fire from the earth, 'till Prometheus, by the afliftance of Minerva, ftole into heaven, andlighting a ftickatthe chariot of thefun,

Pallas, charmed with his ingenuity, offered him whatever in heaven could contribute to finifh his defign : for this end flie took him up with her to the celeflial manfions, where, in a ferula, he hid fome of the fire of the fun's chariot wheel, and ufed it to animate his image (i). Jupiter, either to revenge his theft, or the
former affront, commanded Vulcan to make a woman, which, when he had done, (he was introduced into the
aflembly of the gods, each of whom bellowed on he^r fome additional charm of perfedion. Venus gave her beauty, Pallas wifdom, Juno riches, Mercury taught her eloquence and Apollo mufic : from all thefe accomplifhments, fhe was ftiled Pandora (2) and was the firftof her fex. Jupiter, to complete hisdefigns, prefented her a box, in which he had enclofed age, difeafesy ^var, famine, pejiilence, dlfcord, enij, calumny, and in fhort, all the evils and vices which he intended to afBid the world with. Thus equipped, Ihe was fent down to Prometheus, w^ho wifely was on his guard againft the mifchief defigned him. Epimetheus his brother, though forwarned of the danger, had lefs refolution ; for enamoured wdth the beauty of Pandora (3), he married her, and opened the fatal box, the contents of which foon overfpread the world. Hope alone refted at the bottom. But Jupiter, not yet fatisfied, difpatched Mercury and Vul
can to ieize Prometheus, whom they carried to mount Caucafus, where they chained him to a rock, and an eagle or vulture was commiliioned to prey on his liver, which every night was renewed in proportion as it was confumed by day. But Hercules foon after killed the vulture and delivered him. Others fiy, Jupiter reftored him his freedom for difcovering his father Saturn's confpiracy (4), and difluading his intended marriage

marriage with Thetis. Nicander, to this fable of Prometheus, lends an additional circumftance. He
tells us fome ungrateful men difcovercd the theft
of Prometheus firft to Jupiter, who rewarded them with perpetual youth. This prefent they loaded on
the back of an afs, who flopping at. a fountain to quench his thirft, v/as hindered by a water fnake, who would not let him drink till he gave him the burthen he carried. Hence the Serpent renews his youth upon changing his Ikin. ri'omt;Lheu>s had an altar in the academy at Athens,
in common with Vulcan and Pallas. His ftatues *re reprcfented with a fcepter in the hand. There is a very ingenious explanation of this fable ; it is faid Prometheus was a wile Prince, who reclaiming his fubje»5ls from a favage to a focial
life, was faid to have animated men out of clay : he firft iuitituted facrifices (according to (5) Pliny)
which gave rife to the ftory of the two oxen. Being cxpciled his dominions, by Jupiter, he fled to Scythia, where he retired to mount Caucafus, either to make aftronomical obfervations, or to indulge his melancholy for the lofs of his dominions. This occafioned the fable of the vulture feeding upon his liver. As he was alfo the firft inventor of forging metals by fire, he was faid to have ftole the element from heaven. In fliort, as the firft knowledge of agriculture, and even navigation, is afcribed to him, it is no wonder if he was cdebrated for forming a living man from an inanimalcd I'ubftance. Some authors imagine Prometheus to be the fame
with Noah. The learned Bochart imagines him to be Magog. Each opinion is fupported by arguments, which do not want a fhew of probability. The ftory of Pandora affords very diftindt traces
of the tradition of the fall of our firft parents, and
the fedudion of Adam by his wife Eve*

OF DEUCALION AND PYRRHA.
Deucalion was the fon of Prometheus, and had married his coufin-^crman Pyrrha, the daughter
of Epimetheus, who bore him a fon, called Hclenec, who gave his name to Greece. Deucalion reigned in Theflaly (6), which he governed with equity and juftice ; but his country, for the wickednefs of the inhabitants, being deftroyed by a flood, be and his queen only efcaped by faving themfelves on mount Parnaflus. After the de<:reafe of the waters, this illullrious pair confulted the oracle of Themis in their diftrefs. The anfwer was in thefe terms, Depart the teinpky veil your heads cr.d faces, unlcofe your g'rdleSf and thronv behind your backs the bones of your grandmother, Pyrrha was ftocked at an advice, which her piety made her rcgr:rd with horror : but Deucalion penetrated the myfiical fenfe, revived her, by telling her the earth was their grandmother, and that the bones were only fhones. They immediately obey the oracle, and behold its eiFed : the ftones which Deucalion threw, became living men ; thofe call by Pyrrha rofe into wom.en. With thefe, returning into TheiTaly, that prince repeopled his kingdom, and was honoured as the teftorer of mankind. To explain this fable it is neceflary to obferve, there were five deluges, of which the one in queftion was the fourth, in order of time, and laded, ac-. cording to Ariftotle*s account, the whole winter. It is therefore needlefs to wafte time in drawing a parallel between this Itory and the Mofaic flood. The circumftance of the ftones (7) feems occafioned
by the fame word bearing two fignifications ; fo that thefe myfterious ftones are only the children of fuck as efcaped che general inundation. CHAP.

OF SATURN.
oOAT URN was the yonngeft fon of Caelus and
Terra, and married his fifter Vefta. Under the arti
cle of Caelus, we have taken notice how he treated
his father. We find a new proof of his ambition in his endeavouring by the affiftance of his mother, to exclude his elder brother Titan from the throne, in which he fo far fucceeded, that this prince was obliged to refign his birthright, on thefe terms, that Saturn Ihould not bring up any male children, fo that the fucceflion might devolve to the right male line again. Saturn, it is faid, obferved thefe conditions fo faithfully, that he devoured all the fons he had by his wife, as foon as born. But his exadnefs in this point was at laft fruftrated by the artifice of Vefta. Having brought forth the twins, Jupiter and Juno, Ihe prefented the latter to her hulband, and concealing the boy, fent him to be nurfed on mount Ida in Crete, committing the care of him to the Curetes and Corybantes. Saturn, however, getting fome intelligence of the affair, demanded the child, in •whofe ftead his wife gave him a ftone iwaddled up, which he fwallowed. This ftone had the name of Ab-addir, (or the potent father) and received divine honours. This fidion, of Saturn's devouring his fons, according to Mr. Le Clerc (8), was founded upon a cuftom which he had of banifhing or confining his children for fear they fhould one day rebel againft him. As to the ftone which Saturn is faid to fwallow, this is another fiction, founded on the double meaning of the word Eben, which fignifies both a ftone and a child, and means no more than that Saturn was deceived by Rhea's fubftituting another child in the room of Jupiter. Titan finding the mutual compatft made between him and his brother thus violated, took arms to revenge the injury, and not only defeated Saturn, but
made him and his wife Vefta prifoners, whom he confined (8) Remarks upon Hefiod.

fined in Tartarus, a place fo dark and difmal, tl?at it afterwards became one of the appellations of the infernal regions. In the mean time Jupiter being grown up, raifed an army in Crete for his father's deliverance. He alfo hired the Cecrops to aid him in his expedition ; but on their refufal to join him after taking the money, he turned them into Apes. After this he marched againft the Titans, and obtained a complete vidory. The Eagle which appeared before the engagement, as an aufpicious omen, was ever after chofen to carry his thunder. From the blood of the Titans, flain in the battle, proceeded ferpents, fcorpions, and all venomous reptiles. Having by this fuccefs freed his parents, the young prince caufed all the gods aflembled, to renew their oath of fidelity to Saturn, on an altar, which on that account has been raifed to a conftellation in the heavens. Jupiter, after this, married Metis, daughter of Oceanus, who, it is reported, gave Saturn a potion, which caufed him to bring up Neptune and Pluto, with the reft of the children he had formerly devoured (9).
The merit of the fon (as it often happens) only ferved to increafe the father's jt aloufy, which received new ftrength from an ancient oracle or tradition, that he fhould be dethroned by one of his fons. Jupiter therefore fecretly informed of the meafures taken to deftroy him, fuffered his ambition to get the afcendant over his duty, and taking up arms,
depofed his father, whom, by the advice of Prometheus, he bound in woollen fetters, and threw into Tartarus with Japetus his uncle. Here Saturn fuffered the fame barbarous punifhment of caftration he had inflided on his father Caelus.
Macrobius fearches into the reafon why this god was bound with fetters of wool, and adds, from the teftimony of Apolidorus, that he broke thefe cords once a year at the celebration of the Saturnalia (i). This he explains by faying, that this fable alluded to the corn, which being fliut up in the earth, and detained by chains foft and eafily broken, fprung forth and annually arrived at maturity.

fays (a), that the Greeks looked upon the places fituated to the eaft as higher than thofe that lay weftward, and from hence concludes, that by Tartarus, or Hell, they only meant Spain. As to the caftration vof Saturn, Mr. Le Clerc conjedtures (3), that it only means that Jupiter had corrupted his father's council, and prevailed upon the moft confiderable perfons of his court to defert him. The manner in which- Saturn efcaped from his prifon is not related. He fled to Italy, where he was kindly received by Janus, then king of that country, who aflbciated him in the government. From hence that pail of the world obtained the name of Saturnia Tellus, as alfo that of Latium, from latcc, to lie hid, becaufe he found a refuge here in his diftrefs. On
this account money was coined with a ihip on one fide, to fignify his arrival, and a Janus with a double head on the other, to denote his fharing the regal authority. The reign of Saturn was fo mild and happy, that the poets have given it the name of the golden
AGE, and celebrated it with all the pomp and luxuriancy of imagination (4). According to Varro, thisdeity, from his inftruding the people in agriculture and tillage, obtained his name (5) of Saturn. The fickle which he ufed in reaping being caft into Sicily, gave that ifland its ancient name of Drepanon, which in Greek fignifies that inftrument. The hiftorians give us a very different picture of Saturn. Diodorus reprefents him as a tyrannical, covetous, and cruel prince, who reigned over Italy and Sicily, and enlarged his dominions by conqueft : he adds, that he opprefTed his fubjeds by fevere taxes, and kept them in awe by ftrong garrifons. This account agrees very well with thofe who make
Saturn the firft who inftituted human facrifices, which probably gave rife to the fable of his devouring his own children. Certain it is, that the Carthaginians

»lans (6) offered young children to this deity ; and ' amongft the Romans, his pricfts were clothed in red, and at his feftivals gladiators were employed to kill each other. The feafts of this deity were celebrated with great folemnity amongft the ilomans about the middle of December. They were firft inftituted by Tullus Hoftilius, though Livy dates them from the confulfnip of Manilius and Sempronius. They lafled but
one day till the time of Julius Casfar, who ordered them to be protraded to three days ; and in procefs of time they were extended to five. During thefe, all public bufinefs was flopped, the fenate never affembled, no war could be proclaimed, or offender executed. Mutual prefents of all kind?, (particularly wax lights) were fent and received, fervants wore the p'lleus or cap of liberty, and were waited on by their maflers at table. All which was defigned to fhew the equality and happinefs of mankind under the Golden Age. The Romans kept in the temple of Saturn, the libri elephantmi, or rolls, containing the names of the
Roman citizens, as alfo the public treafure. This
cuftom they borrowed from the Egyptians, who in the temple of Sudec, or Chrone, depofited their genealogies of families and the public'money. Saturn, like the other heathen deities, had his amours. He fell in love with the nymph Phyllyra, the daughter of Oceanus, and was by his wife Rhea fo near being furprifed in her company, that he was forced to affiime the form of a horfe. This fudden transformation had fuch an effe<51: on his miftrefs, that Ihe bore a creature whofe upper part was like a man, and the reft like a horfe. This fon of Saturn became famous for his fkill in mulic and furgery.
A modern author, M. La Pluche, has very juftly accounted for this fabulous hiftory of Saturn, which certainly derived its ciigin from Egypt. The annual meeting (6) Mr. Selden, in his treatife of the Syrian gods, fpeaking of Moloch, imagines, from d\e cruelty of his facrifices, he was the fume iis Saturn. In the reign of Tiberius, that prince crucified the priefts of Saturn for offering young infants at his altars. This idea of Saturn's malignity is, perhaps, the reafon why the planet, which bears this name, was ihought fo inau^icious acd unfriendly to mankind.

OF THE GOLDEN AGE.
I ^'IFFICULT as it is, to reconcile the inconfiftencies between the poets and hiftorians in the preceding account of Saturn, yet the concurrent teftimony of the former in placing the Golden Age in his time, feems to determine the point in his favour ; and to prove that he was a benefador and friend to mankind, fince they enjoyed fuch felicity under his admi
niftration. We can never fufficiently admire the mafterlydefcrip^iou given by Virgil of thefe halcyon days, when peace and innocence adorned the world, and fweetened all the blefTings of untroubled life. Ovid has yet heightened the defcription with thofe touches of imagination peculiar to him. Amongft the Greek poets, Hefiod has touched this fubjed: with that agreeable fimplicity which diftinguiflies all his writings. By the Golden Age might be figured out the happinefs of the primteval ftate before the firft and univerfal deluge, when the earth, remaining in the feme pofition in which it was firft created, flouriflied with perpetual fpring, and the air always temperate and ferene, was neither difcompofed by ftorms, nor darkened by clouds. The reafon of affixing this time to the reign of Saturn, was probably this : the Egyptians held the firft annual aflfembly of their judges in the month of February, and as the decifions of thefe fages were always attended with the higheft equity, fo the people regarded that ftafon as a time of general joy and happinefs, rather as all nature with them was then in bloom, and the whole country looked like one enamelled garden or carpet. But after all it appears, that thefe halcyon times were but of a fhort dura::ion, fince tlie charader Plato, Pythagoras, and others, give of this age, can only relate to that ftate of perfed innocence which ended with the fall.

OF THE GIANTS.
J HE giants were produced (as has been already
observed) of the blood which flowed from the wound of Saturn, when caftratedby his fon Jupiter. Proud of their own ftrength, and fired with a daring ambition, they entered into an afTociation to dethrone Jupiter; for which purpofe they piled rocks on rocks, in order to fcale the ikies. This engagement is differently related by authors, both as to the place where it happened, and the circumftances which attended it ; fome writers laying the fcenc in Italy (4), others in Greece (5). It feems the father
of the gods was apprized of the danger, as there was a prophetical rumour amongft the deities, that the giants fhould not be overcome, unlefs a mortal aflifted in the war. For this reafon Jove, by the advice of Pallas, called up Hercules, and being aflifted by the reft of the gods gained a complete vidory over
the rebels, moft of whom perifhed in the confiicfl-. Hercules firft flew Alcyon with an aiTow, but he itill furvived and grev/ ftronger, till Minerva drew him out of the moon's orb, when he expired. This goddefs alfo cut off the heads of Enceladus and Pallantes, and afterwards encountering Alc/oneus at the Corinthian ifthmus, killed him in fpite of his monflrous bulk. Porphyris, about to raviih Juno, fell by the hands of Jupiter and Hercules. Apollo and Hercules difpatched Ephialtei, and Hercules flew Eurytus, by darting an oak at him. Clytius was r.ain by Hecate, and Polybotes flying through the fea, came to the iOe of Coos, where Neptune tearing off part of the land, hurled it at him, and formed the ifie of Nifyros. Mercury flev/ Hyppolitus, Gratian was vanquifhed by Diana, and the Parc-e claimed their fhare in the vidory, by the deflrudion of Agryus and Thoan. Even Silenus's afs,

afs, by his opportune braying, contributed to put the giants in confufion, and complete their ruin. During this war, of which Ovid has left us a fliort defciiption, Pallas diftinguiflied herfelf by her wifdom, Hercules by his ftrength, Pan by his trumpet, which ftruck a terror in the enemy, and Bacchus by his aftivity and courage. Indeed their afliftance was no more than feafonabie ; for when the giants lirll made their audacious attempt, the gods were fo aftonifhed, that they fled into Egypt, where they concealed themfelves in various fhapes. But the moft dreadful of thefe monfters, and the moft difficult to fubdue, was Typhon or Typhseus ; whom, when he had almoft difcomfited all the gods,
Jupiter purfued to mount Caucafus, where he wounded him with his thunder ; but Typhon turning upon him, took him, prifoner; and after cytting with his own fickle the nerves of his hands and feet, threw him on his back, carried him into Cilicia, and imprifoned him in a cave, whence he was delivered by Mercury, who reftored him to his former vigour. After this, Jove had ?. fecond engagement with Ty
phon, who flying into Sicily, was overwhelmed by mount JEtna. The giants are reprefented by the poets as men of huge ftature and horrible afped, their lower parts being of a ferpentine form. But above all, Typhon, or Typhasus, is defcribed in the moft fliocking manner ; Hefiod has giving him an hundred heads of dragons, uttering dreadful founds, and having eyes that darted fire. He makes him, by Echidna, the father of the dog Orthus, or Cerberus, Hydra, Chimsera, Sphinx, the Nemaean lyon, the Hefperian dragon, and of ftorms and tempefls. Hiftorians fay, Typhasus v^^as the brother of Ofiris, king of Egypt, who, in the abfence of this monarch, formed a confpiracy to dethrone him at his return ;
for which end he invited him to a feaft, at the conclufion of which, a theft of exquifite workmanfliip was brought in, and offered to him who lying down in it ftiould be found to fit it beft. Ofiris, not diftrufting the contrivance, had no fooner got in but the lid was clofed upon him, and the unhappy king thrown into the Nile. Ifis, his queen, to revenge the death ©f her beloved hufband, raifed an army, the command of

of which fhe gave to her fon Orus, who, after vanquidiing the ufurper, put him to death. Hence the Egyptions, who detefted his memory, painted him in their
hieroglyphic characters in fo frightful a manner. The length and multiplicity of his arms denoted his power ; the ferpents which formed his heads, fignified his addrefs and cunning ; the crocodile fcales which coTcred his body, exprefled his cruelty and diflimulation
;
and the flight of the gods into Egypt, (hewed the precautions taken by the great men to ihelter themfelves from his fury and refentment. It is eafy in this ftory of the giants to trace the Mo
faic hiftory which, informs us how the earth was a^i(5ted v.ith men of uncommon ftature and great wickednefs. The tradition of the tower of Babel, and the defeat of that impious defign, might naturally give rife to the attempt of thcfe monfters, to infult the fkies and make war on the gods. But there is another explication of this fable, which feems both more rational and curious. Amongft the names of the giants we find thofe of Briareus (6), Rcechus (7), Othus (8), Ephialtes (9), Prophyrion (i),
Enceladus (2), and Mimas (3). Now the literal fignication of thefe, leads us to the fenfe of the allegory, which was defigned to point out the fatal confequenccs of the flood, and the confiderable changes it introduced with regard to the face of nature. This is further confirmed by their tradition, that their Ofiris vanquiflied the giants, and that Orus, his fon, in particular, flopped the purfuit of Rcechus, by appearing before him in the form of a lion. By which they meant,
(6) From Bcri, ferenity; and Karcus, loft, to ftew the temperature of the air deftroyed. (7) From Reuach, the winds. (8) From Ouitta, or Othus, the times, to typify the viciflitude of the feafons. (9) From Evi, or Ephi, clouds; and Altah, darknefs, i.e. dark gloomy clouds. (1) From Phau, to break, comes Pharphcr, to feparatc minutely ; to denote tlie general difTolution of the Primaeval fyftcm. (2) From Erceled, violent fprings or torrents.

It may i^ot be improper to add, that from the blood of the giants defeated by Jupiter, were produced I'erpents and all kinds of venomous creatures.

OF JANUS.
1 HE connexion between Saturn and Janus, renders the account of the latter a proper fupplement to the hiftoryof the former. Writers vary as to the birth of this deity, fome making him the fon of C«lus and Hecate, others the offspring of Apollo, by Creufa, daughter of Eridheus, king of Athens. Hefiod is nient about him in his Theogony, and indeed Janus was a god little known to the Greeks. According to Cato, he v^'as a Scythian prince, who, at the head of a vidorious army, fubdued and depopulated Italy. But the mofl probable opinion is, that he was an Etrurian king, and one of the earlieft monarchs of that country, which he governed with great wifdom, according to the teflimony of Plutarch, who fays. Whatever he rojaSf nvhether a king or a god, he --^as a great politician^ <who tempered the tnanners of his fuhje^s, and taught them civility, on ivhich account he ii'aj regarded as the god of peace, a^id tie'ver wvoLd duriyig the time of
*ivar. The Romans held him in peculiar veneration. From Fabius Pid:or, one of the oldeft Roman hif
torians, we learn, that the ancient Tufcans were firft taught by this good king to improve the vine, to fow corn, and make bread, and that he firfl raifcd temples and altars to the gods, v>'ho were before worfliipped
in groves. We have already mentioned Saturn as the introducer of thefe arts into Italy, where Janus alTociated him into a fhare of his power. Some fay he was married to the youngeft Vefta, the goddefs of/r<?

It is certain that he early obtained divine honours
at Rome, where Nnma Pompiiiiis inftituted an annual ftfiival to hinn in January, which was celebrated with manly exerciles. Romulus and Tatius had before ered:cd him a templ.i', upon occafion of the union of
the Romans with the Sabines. Numa ordained it fliould be opened in time of war, and fhut in time of peace (5"), which happened but thrice for feveral centuries. I. In the reign of Numa. 2. In theconfulatc of Attilus Balbus, and Manlius Torquatus ; and, 3.

Hence in all the facrifices the firft libations of Avine and wheat were offered to him, as likewife all prayers were prefaced with a fhort addrefs to him. The peculiar offerings at his feftival were cakes of new meal and fait, with new wine and frankincenfc (6) . Then all artificers and tradefmen began their

Janus was reprefented with two faces, and called RitVons, Byceps, and Didymasus, as forming another image of himfelf on the difk of the moon, and looking to the pafl and approaching year ; with keys, as opening and fhutting up the day (7). He is faid to have regulated the months, the firft of which is diflinguiflied by his name, as the firft day of every month
was alfo facred to him. He was therefore feated in the center of twelve altars ; and had on his hands figures to the amount of days in the year. Sometimes hir image had four faces, to exprefs the four feafons of the year over which he prefided. Though Janus be properly a Roman deity, yet it is amongft the Egyptians we mufl feek for the true explanation

That nation reprefented tJxc opening of their folar year by an image, with a key in its hand, and two faces, one old, and the other young, to typify or mark the old or new year. King Picus with a hawk's head, who is ufually drawn near Janus, leaves no doubt but that the fymbol of this deity was borrowed from that people. The reader, after putting all this together, will reafonably conclude, that by this figure could only be intended the fun, the great ruler of the year.

Ofthe Elder Vesta, or Cybele, the Wife of Saturn.
It is highly neceffary, in clafling the Heathen divinities, to diftinguiih between this goddefs, who is alfo called Rhea, and Ops, from another Vtfta, their daughter, becaufe the poets have been faulty in confounding them, and afcribing the attributes and adions of the one to the other. The elder Vefta, commonly called Eflia by the
Greeks, was the daughter' of Cselus and Terra, and
1 arried to her brother Saturn, to whom flie bore a numerous offspring. She had a multiplicity of names befides, of which the principal were Cybele/Magna Ma
ter, or the great mother of the Gods ; and Bona Dea,
or the good goddefs, &c. under different facrifices. Vefta is generally reprefented upon ancient coins fitling, though fometimes Handing, with a lighted torch in one hand, and a fphere in the other. Under the charaifter of Cybele ilie makes a more magnificent appearance, being feated on a lofty cha
riot drawn by lions, crowned with towers, and having a key extended in her hand. Some indeed make the Phrygian Cybele a different perfon from Vefta : they fay (he was the daughter of Moeones, an an^^ient king of Phrygia and Dyndima,
and that her mother, for fome reafons, expofed her on
mount Cybelus, where flie was noiirifhed by lions.
Her parents afterwards owned her, and llie fell in love

Soon after a pla^jue and famine laying wafte the country, the oracle was confulted, who advifed them to bury Atys with great pomp, and to worftiip Cybele as a Goddefs. ^Accordingly they eredted a temple to her honour at Peflinus, and placed lions at her feet to denote her being educated by thefe animals. Ovid relates the ftory a little more in the marvellcus
way : Atys was a boy fo called by Cybele, whom (he appointed to prefide in her rites, enjoining him inviolate chaftity ; but the youth happening to forget his vow, in refentment the goddefs deprived him of his fenfes ; but at laft pitying his mifery fhe turned him Into Sipine tree, v/hich as well as the boxy v/as held facred to her. The animal commonly facrificed to Cy•bele was the fow, on account of its fecundity. The priefts of this deity were the Corybantes, Cu
retes, Idasi, Da6tyli, and Telchines, who in their myftical rites made great ufe of Cymbals and other inllruments of brafs, attended with extravagant cries and Jiowlings. They facrificed fitting on the earth, and offered only the hearts of the vidims. The goddefs Cybele was unknown to the Romans till the time of Hannibal, when, confulting the Sybilline oracles, they found that formidable enemy could not be expelled till they fent for the Idccan mother to Rome. Attains, then king of Phrygia, at the requeft -o1f their embaffadors, fent her ftatue, which was of ftone. But the veflel which carried it arriving in the Tyber, was miraculoufly ftopped, till Claudia, one of the Veftal-Virgins, drew it alhore with her girdle.
This Vefta, to whom the living flame was facred, is the fame with the iEgyptian Ifis, and reprefented the pure atberj inclofing, containing and pervading all things. Their expreffings and attributes are alike. She was confidered as the caufr of generation and motion, the parent of all the luminaries, and is confounded with nature and the ivorld. She obtained the name of Eftia, as being the life or eflence of all things (8). As to the priefts of Cybele, the Corybantes, Curetes, <3cc^ they are of the fame original. Crete was a colony i%) Pkto in Cratylo.

Cybele was honoured a^ Rome by the title of Bona Dea, or good goddefs. But this devotion was only paid her by the matrons, and the rites were celebrated in fo fecret a manner, that it was no lefs than death for any man to be prefent at the affembly (3). Whence they were called Opertoria. The Roman farmers andlhepherds worftiipped Cybele or Vefta, by the title of Magna Pales, or the goddefs of cattle and pafture. Her feftival was in April, at which time they purified their flocks and herds with the fum^es of rofemary, laurel, and fulphur, offered facrifices of milk and millet cakes, and concluded the ceremony by dancing round ftraw fires. Thefe annual feafts were called Palilia, and were the fame with the e>jj-|Uo <f)cpja of the Greeks, and probably of Phaenician or Egyptian original. The great feftival of Cybele, called Megalefia, was always celebrated in April, and lafted eight days at Rome.

According to Ladantius, the chaflity of Vefla is meant to exprefs the nature of fire, which is incapable of mixture, producing nothing, but converting all things into itfelf.
Numa Pompilius, the great founder of religion aRiong the Romans, is faid firft to have reftoredthe an
cient rites and worfhip of this goddefs, to whom he created a circular temple, which, in fucceeding ages, vas much embelliflied. He alfo appointed four priefl-cfTes to be chofen out of the nobleft families in Rome, and of fpotlefs chara<5ler, whofe ofiice was to attend the facred frre kept continually burning near her altar. Thefe Veflal-Virgins continued in their charge forthirty years, and had very great privileges annexed to their dignity. This fire was annually renewed, with great ceremony, from the rays of the fun, on the kalend* of March. It was preferved in earthen pets fufpended in the air, and efleemed fo facred, that if ay any miffortune it became extinguiflied (as happened once) a ceflTation enfued from all bufinefs, till they had expiated the prodigy. If this accident appeared to be owing to the negled of the Yeftals, they were feverely punifhed ; and if they violated their vow of chaflity, they were interred alive. As Vefla was the goddefs of fire, the Romans had no images in her temple to reprefcnt her, the reafon of which we learn in Ovid (5). Yet, as ihe was the guardian of coufes or hearth, her image was ufually placed in the porch or entry, and daily facri.'ce offered her(6). It is certain nothing could be a flronger or more lively fymbol of the fupreme Being, than fire. Accordingly we find this emblem in early ufe throughout all the cafl. The Perfians held it in venei-ation long,before

OF JUPITER,
W
E come now to tlis great king, or mafler of the gods. This deity was the fon of Saturn, and Rhea, or Veita, at kaft this is that Jupiter, to whom*' the actions of all the others were chiefly afcribcd. For there were fo many princes called by his name, that
it feems.to have been a common appellation in early times for a powcri\il or victorious prince (7). The moft confiderable of thefe was certainly the Cretan Jove above-mentioned, of whofe education we have \ery various accounts, as well as the place of his birth. The Mefiersi.ms pretended to fhew in the neighbourhood of their city a fountain called Ciepfydra, where Jupiter was educated by the nymphs
Ithome ar.d Keda, othera fay he was bom at Thebes in BtEotia ; but the moit general and received opinion iti, that he was brought up re;ir mount Ida in Crete. Virgil tellvs us he was fed by the bees, out of gratitude for which he changed them from an iron to a golden eolour. Some fay his nurfcs were Amalthoea and
Melifla, daugiiters of Meiiiytras king of Crete, who gave him goats milk and honey ; others, that Amalthaea was the name of the goat that nurfed him, whofe horn he prcfented to thofe pnncefies with this privilege annexed, that whoever pofTefTed it fhould immediately have whatever they delired ; whence it came to be called the horn of Plenty. After this the goat dying, Jupiter placed her amongft the ftars, and by
the advice of Themis covered his Ihield with her Jkin to ftrike terior in the giants, v/hence it obtained the
name

name of j^gis. According to others, he and his fifler Juno fiickeJ the breafts of Fortune. Some al. ledge his mother Vefta fuckkd him ; fome, that he v.'as fed by wild pigeons, who brought him ambrofia
from Oceanus, and by an eagle, who carried nc<5lar in his beak from a fteep rock ; in r^compence of which fervices, he made the former the foretellers of xvinter and fummer, and gave the latter the reward of immortality, and the office of bearing his thunder. In fhort, the nymphs and the bears claiir. 2 fhaie in the honour of his education, nor is it yet decided which has the beft title to it. Let us now come to the actions of Jupiter. The firft, and indeed the moft memorable of his exploits, was his expedition againft the Titans, for his father's deliverance and reftoration, of which we have already fpoken under the article of Saturn. After this he dethroned his father, and having pciTelfed himfelf of his throne, was acknowledged by all the gods in quality of their fupreme. Apollo, himfelf, crowned with laurel, and robed with purple, condcfcended to fing his praifes to his lyre. Kercules, in order to perpetuate the memory of his triumphs, infcituted the Olympic games, where it is laid that Pecebus carried off the firft prize, by overcoming Mercury at the race. After this, Jupiter being fully fettled, divided his dominions with his brothers Neptune and Pluto, as will be Ihev/n in the fequel. Jupiter, however, is thought to ufe his power in a little too tyrannical a manner, for which we find Juno, Neptune, and Pallas, confpired againft, and adually feized his pcrfon. But the giants Cottus, Gyges, and Briareus, who were then his guards, and
whom Thetis called to his affiftance, fet him at li
terty. How thefe giants, with others of their race, afterwards rev©lted againft him, and were overthrown, has been already mentioned in its place. The ftory of Lycaon is not the leaft diftinguifhing of his actions. Hearing of the prevailing wickednefs of mankind, Jove defcended to the earth, and arriving at the palace of this monarch, king of Arcadia, declared who he was, on which the people prepared facrifices, and the other honours due to him. But Lycaon, both im.pious and incredulous, tilled one of his domeftics, and ferved up the flelh drelTed at the entertainmeJit



THE HEATHEN GODS. 31
tntei-tainment he gave the god, who detefting fuch horrid inhumanity, immediately confumed the palace with lightening, and turned the barbarian into a wv\?. Ovid has related this ftory with his ufual art. But as ambition, when arrived at the height 0/ its v/ifhes, feldoni ftriitly adheres to the rules of modelation, fo the air of a court is always in a peculiar manner fatal to virtj.e. If any monarch deferved the chara^^ter of encourag**:^" gallantry by his example, it was certainly Jupiter, whole amours are as number* lefs as the metamorphof^'s he affiimed <o accomplifh them, and h-r.e afforded an extenlive field of defcription to the poets and painters, t)oth ancient and niodern. Jupiter had feveral wives: Metis, or Prudence, hts firft, he is faid to have devoured, when big with child, by which himfelt"' becoming pregnant, Minerva ilTued out of his head adult and completely armed.
Itis fecond was Themi6,*or Judice, by whom he had the Hours, meaning reinitiation of time', Eunomia, or' good order', Diche, or lavj ; Eirene, or peace, and the
Deftinies. He alfo married Juno, his fifter, whom it is reported he deceived under the form of a cuckoo, who, to f]-iun the violence of a ftorm, fkd for fhelter to her lap (8). She bcre him Hebe, Mars, Lucina, and Vulcan. By Eurynome, he bad the three Graces ; by Ceres, Proferpine ; Mnemofyne, the nine Mufes ; by Latona, Apollo and Diana j by Maia, Mercury. Of his intrigues we have a pretty curious detail. One of his firft miftrefies v/as Califlo, the daughter
of Lycaon, one of the nymphs of Diana. To deceive her, he afiumed the folpm of the goddefs of chaftity, and facceeded fo far as to make the virgin violate her vow. But her difgrace being revealed, as fhe was bathing with her patronefs, the incenfed deity net only difgraced her, but (9) turned her into a bear. Jove, in compaflicn to her punifhment and fufferings, raifed her to a conftellation in the heavens (i). Cahfto, however, left a fon called Areas,
who having inllru<5led the Pclafgians in tillage and the focial (8) At a mountain near Corinth, Icncc called Coceyy. (9) Some fay it was Jnno turned her into that animal. (l) Called Utfa Major by the L:.i rs» and Hclice by the Greeks.

fecial arts, they from him took the name of Arcadians, and after his death he was, by his divine father, allotted alio (a) a feat in the Ikies. There is fcarce any form which Jupiter did not at fome time or other aflume to gratify his defires. Under the figure of a fatyr he violated Antiope, the
wife of Lycus, kang of Thebes, by whom he had two fons, Zethus axid Amphion. In the rtfemblance of a fwan he corrupted Lc»la, the fpouie of Tyndaris, king of Laconia. Under the appearance of a white bull he earned off Europa, the daughter of Agenor, king of Phsenicia, into Crete, where he enjoyed her. In the fliape of an eagle he furprifed Afteria, the daughter of C-jeus, and bore her away in his talons in fpite of her modefty. Aided by the feme difguife iie feizeJ the beauteous Ganymede, fon of Tros, as he was hunting on mount Ida, and raifed him to the joint funcftions of his cup-bearer and catamite. It was indeed difficult to efcape the purfuits of a god, who by his unlimited power made all nature
fublervient to his purpcfcs. Of this we have a remarkable inAance in Danae, whole fether, Acrifius, jealoug of her eonduirt, had fecurcd her in a brazen tower ; but Jupiter defcending in a golden fhower, found means to elude all the vigilance of her keepers. He inllamed iEgina, the daughter of iEfopus, kang of Bceotia, in the fimilitude of a lambent fire, and then carried her from Epidaums to a defert iile called Oenope, to which fiie gave her own name (.^). Clytoris, a fair virgin of Theffhly, he debauched in the fhape of an ant ; but to corrupt Alcmena, the wife of Amphytrion, he was obliged to alTume the form of her hufband, under vrhlch the fair one, deceived, innocently yielded to his defires. By ^^ha]ia lie had two fons called the Pallaci ; and two by Protogenia, viz. JEthlius, the father of Endymion, and Epaphus, the founder of Memphis in Egypt, and father of
Lybia, who gave her name to the continent of Afiick. Eledra bore him Dardanus, Laodamia, Sarpedon, and Argus, Jodamus, Deucalion, with

many others too tedious to enumerate, though mentioned by the poets. It is very evident that moft, if not all the ftories relating to the amours of the gods, were invented by their refpedive priefts, to cover their corruption or debauchery. Of which this of Danae fecms at leaft
a palpable inftance, and may ferve to give fome idea of the reft : Acriiius was informed by an oracle, that his grandfon would one day deprive him of his crown and life ; on which he fliut up his daughter Danae in a brazen tower, of the temple of Apollo at Delphos, the priefts of which oracle probably gave him this information, with no other view than to for\^ard their fchem.e, which tended to gratify the luft of Prseteus, the king's brother, who being let through the the roof, pretending to be Jupiter, and throwing large quantities of gold amongft her domeftics, obtained his wifhes.
Two particular adventures of his are too remarka
able to be paffed in filence. He had deluded by his arts Semele, daughter of Cadmus, king of Thebes, who proved with child. Juno hearing of it, and intent on revenge, under the difguife of Beroe, nurfe to the princefs, was admitted to her prefence, and artfidly infinuated to her that fhe might net be deceived in her lover, frie advifed her, the next time he vilited her, to requelt, as a proof of his love, that fhe might fee him in the fame majefty with which he embraced Juno. Jupiter granted, not without reluctance, a favour he knew would be fo fatal to his miftrefs. The unhappy fair-one, unable to bear the dazzling effulgence, periflied in the flames, and with her, her offspring muft have done fo too, if the god had not taken it out, and inclofed it in his thigh, where it lay the full time, when it came into the world, and was named Bacchus. Jupiter next fell enamoured with lo, the daughter of Inachus, and, as fome fay, the prieftefs of Juno ;
having one day met this virgin returning from her father's grotto, he endeavoured to feduce her to an
adjacent foreft ; but the. nymph flying his embraces, he involved her in fo thick a mift, that fhe loft her way, fo that he eafily overtook and enjoyed her. Juno, v/hofe jealoufy always kept her watchftil, mifling her hufband, and perceiving a thick darknefs on C 5 ti>e

the earth, defcended, difpelled the cloud, and had Certainly difcovered the intrigue, had hot Jupiter fuddenly transformed lo into a white heifer. Juno, pleafed with the beauty of the animal, begged her, and to allay her jealoufy, he was obliged to yield her
up. The goddefs immediately gave her in charge to
Argus, who had an hundred eyes, two of which only
flept at a time. Her lover, pitying the mifery of lo in fo ftrid a confinement, fent Mercury down dif
guifed like a fiiepherd, who with his flute charmed Argus to fleep, fealed his eyes v\dth his caduceus, or rod, and then cut off his head. Juno, in regard to his memory, placed his eyes in the tail of the peacock, a bird facred to her, and then turning her rage againft lo, fent the furies to purfiie her wherever ihe went (6) ; fo that the wretched fugitive, weary of life, implored Jove to end her mifery. Accordingly the god intreats his fpoufe to fhew her companion, fwearing by Styx never to give her further caufe of jealoufy. Juno on this becom.es appeafed, and lo ijeing reftored to her former Ihape, is worfhipped in
Egypt by the name of Ifis. The fable of lo and Argus is certainly of Egyptian birth, and the true mythology is this : the art of weaving, firft invented in Egypt, was by the colonies of that nation carried to Greece and Colchis, where it was praftifed with this difference, that the feafons for working were varied in each country according to
to the nature of the climate. The months of February, March, April, and May, they employed in Egypt, in cultivating Heir lands ; Avhcreas thefc being winter months with the Grecians, they kept
the looms bufy. Now the Ifis, which pointed out the neomenia, or monthly feftivals in Egypt, was always attended with an hcrus, or figure exprcflive of the labour peculiar to the feafon. Thus the horus of the weaving months was a little figure ftuck over with
eyea, to denote the many lights necefiary for working by
(6) Dr. King relates this ftory a little differently, lo, purfued by Tifiphone (one of the furies fell into the fea, and was carried firft to Thracian Bofphorus, and thence into Egypt, where the monfter ftill purfuino^ her, -was repelled by the Nile. After this flie was deified by Jupiter, and appointcxl to prefide ovif winds and navigation. Jt is eafy to ice tifts agrees better with the Egyptian raytbology.

Argos, from whom fhe was next feafon delivered by the bonis, reprefenting Anubis (or Mercury), that is, the rifrng of the dog-ftar. The taking thefe fymbolical reprefentations in a literal fenie, gave rife to the fable. It is no wonder if the number of Jupiter's gallantries made him the fubjed of deteftation among the primitive Chriftians, as well as the ridicule of the wifer among the Heathens. Teiluliian obferves with judgment.

Jupiter had a multiplicity of names, either from the places where he was worlliippcd, or the attributes afcribed to him : He had the epithets of Xenius, or the hofpitable ; Elicious, on account of his goodnefs and clemency ; and Dodonasus. on account of the oracular grove at Dodona, confecrated to him, and femous through all Greece. Amongft the Romans he had the appellations of Optimus Maximus, on account of his beneficence and power ; Almus, from his cherifhing all things ; Stabilitor, from his fupporting the world ; Opitulator, from his helping the diftrelFed ; Stator, fiom his fufpending

The reign of Jupiter not having been fo agreeable to his fubjefts as that of Saturn, gave occalion to the notion of the silver age; by which is meant an age inferior in happinefs to that which preceded, though fuperior to thofe which followed. This Father of Gods and Men is commonly figured
as a majeftic man with a beard, enthroned. In his left hand he holds a vidory, and in his right hand grafps the thunder. At his feet an eagle with his wings difplayed.

JUNO, the fifter and confort of Jtipiter, was on
that account ftiltd tlie queen of heaven, and indeed we find her in the rmets fuppoiling that dignity with an ambition and pride fuitable to the rank fhe bore. Though the poetical hiftcrians agree (lie came into the world at a birth with her hufband, yet they differ as to the place, fome placing her nativity at Argcs, others at Samos near the river Imbrafus. Some fay fne was nurfed by Eubsea.. Porfyinna, and Arzea, daughters of the river Aiterion ; others by the Nymphs of the ocean. Otes, an ancient poet^ tells us fhe was educated by the Horre or Hours : and Homer afTigns this poft to Oceanus and Tethys themfelves. It is faid that this goddefs, by bathing annually in the fountain of Canatho near Argos, renewed her virginity. The places where flie was principally ho • roured were Sparta, Jlycene, and Argos. At this place the facrifice offered to her con filled of 100 oxen.

Amongft the Romans, who held her in high venera

By this the mytholoeifls fay is meant the harmony and connedion of the air with the earth, and the inability of the gods to relieve her, Rgnifies that no force, human fa divine, can diilolve the frame or texture of the univerfe. According to Taufanias, the temple of Juno at Athens had neither iioors nor roof, to denote that Juno, being the air in v.hich we breathe, can be incloftd in no certain bounds. The implacable arrogant temper of Juno once mac^e her abandon her throne in heaven, and Ry into Eubssa.

whom he defigned to make his queen. Juno upon
this refuming her ancient iealoufy, attacked the mock bride, and by tearing off its ornaments ibund the deceit, quieted her ill humour, and was glad to make up the m<atter with her hufoand.

Neptune is faid to be the firft inventor of horfe"manfliip and chariot-racing. Hence Mithric'ates, king of Pontus, threw chariots drawn by four horfes into the fca in honour of him, and the Romans inftituted horfe-races in tht Circus during his feftival, at which time all horfes left working, and the mules were adorned with wreaths of flowers. Probably this idea of Neptune arofe from the famous controverfy between him and Minerva, when they difputed who fliouid give name to Gecropia. The god, by f.rii'Jng the earih with his trident, produced a horfe. Pallas raifed an olive-tree, by which flie gained the victory, and the new city was from her called Athens. Piut the true meaning of this ftible is a ihip, not a horfe ; for the queflion really was, whether the Athenians fliould apply thernielves to navigation or agriculture, and as they naturally inclined to the firft, it was neceflary to fl-ew them their miftake, by convincing them that huibandry was preferable to failing. However, it is certain Neptune had fome fKill ill the management of horfes : tor we find in Pamphus, the mofi: ancJent ^^Titer of divine hymns, this encomium of hiin, T.iat hs<<vai the bciiefatJor of man kind in bejloxving on ibem horfes-, andJfAps <iv}tb decks refembl'ing tCKvers. "When Neptune was expelled heaven for his confpiracy againft Jupiter, he Red with Apollo to Laomedon, king of Troy, but he trcnicd them diltcrenlly, for having employed them in raifing v alls round this city, in which the lyre of Apollo was highly ferviceable, he paid that deity divine honours, whereas he difinified Neptune unrewarded ; w ho, in revenge, fent a vaft fea mcniler to lay vvafte the country, to appeafe which Laomicdon was forced to expofe his daughter Kefione.
On another occafion this deity had a contefl with Vulcan and Minerva in regard to their ficiil. The goddefs, as a proof of hers, made a houfe ; Vulcan crei^led a man, and Neptune a bull ; whence that animal was ui'ed in the facrifices paid him. But it is probable, that as the vidim was to be black, the delign was to point out the mgi-ig quality and iiiry of tl\e f;;a, over which he prefidtcl. Neptune fell little ihort of his brother Jupiter in point of gallantry. Ovid in his epiftks, has given a catalogue

Ceres Red him in the form of a mare ; he purfued in thtU of a horfe ; but it is uncertain v/htlher this union produced the Centaur ,. called Orion, or a daughter. Under the refemblancc of the river liinipeus, he debauched Tyro, the daughter of Salmoneus, Avho bore him Pelcu^ and Ne]eus. In the fame dif«:uife he begot Cthus and Ephialtes, by Ephimedia, wife of the giant Alcecs. Melantho, daughter of Piiuteusj often diverting herfelf by ri dingon a dolphin, Nepture in that figure furprifed and enjoyed her. Ke changed Theopbane, a beautifui' virgin, into an ewe, and aiTuming the form of a ram, begot the golfkn fleeced ram, which carried Fhryxus to Colchis. In the liken«fs of a bird he had Pegafus by Medufa. He was not only fond cf liis power of transfbrmirg himfelf, but he took a pleafure in beftowing it on his favourites : Proteus his fon pofTefled it in a high de gree. He conferred it on Periclimenus, the brother
of Neftor, who was at lafliiiiled by Hercules, as he watched him in the form of a fly. He even obliged
his miftrefTss with it. We find an inftance of this in,
Metra, the daughter of Erificthon. Her father, for cutting down an oak-grove, confecrated to Ceres, was puniHied with fuch an infatiable hunger, that to fupply it he was forced to fell all he had. His daughter upon this intreated of her lover the power of changing her forth at pleafure ; fo that becoming fometimes a mai"e, a cow, or a Iheep, her father fold her to relieve his wants, while the buyers were ftill cheated in their purchafe. Having raviflied Ccenis, to appeafe her he promifed her any fatisfadion, on which {lie deiired to be turned into a man, that flie might no more fuffer the like injury. Her requeft was granted, and by the name of Caeneus flie became a famous warrior. Neptune was a confiderable deity amongft the Greeks. He had a temple in Arcadia by the name of Proclyftius, or the o-ver-Zlo-jjer ; becaule at Juno's requeft, he delivered the country fi'om an inundation. He was called Hippius, Hippocourius, and Taraxippus, from his regulation of horfemanfliip. The places moft celebrated for his woriliip were Taenarus, Corinth,

Corinth, and Calabria, which laft country was peculiarly dedicated to him. He had alfo a celebrated
temple at Rome, enriched with many naval trophies ; but he received a fignal afiront from Augufnis Csefar, who pulled down his ftatue, in refentment for a tempeft, which had difperfed his fleet and endangered his life. Some think Neptune the fame with the ancient god Cenfus, w^orfliipped at Rome, and fo called from his advifing Romulus to the rape of the
Let us now examine the mythological fenfe of the fable. The Egyptians, to denote navigation, and the annual return of the Phsenician fleet which vifited their coaft, ufed the tigui-e of an Ofiris carried on a winged horfe, or holding a three-forked fpear or liar
poon in his hand. To this im.p.ge they gave the names of Pofeidon (4)5 or Neptune (5), which the
Greeks and Romans afterwards adopted ; bat which fufficiently prove this deity had his birth here. Thns the maritime Ofiris of the Egyptians became a new
deity with thofe who knew not the meaning of the fymbol. But Herodotus, lib. ri. is pofitive that the Greeks received not their knowledge of Neptune from the Egyptians, but from the Lybians. The former received him not till afterwards, and even then, however they might apply the figure to civil purpofes, paid him no divine honours. However, according to Plutarch, they called the maritime coaft Nepthen. Bochart thinks he has found the origin oi this ^od in the perfon of Japhet ; and has given reafons which render the opinioD very probable. Neptune, reprefented as god of the fea, makes a confiderabie figure. He is defcribed with black or dark hair, his garment of an azure or fea-green colour, feated in a large flieil drawn by whales or fea horfes, with his trident in, his hand (6), attended by the

Others fay he was a king of the Moloflians in Epirus, called Aidoneus Orcus, that he dole Proferpine his

Urged by his paflion he forced her into his chariot, and drove her to the river Chemarus, through which he opened himfclf a palTage back to the realms of night. Ceres, difconfolate for the lofs of her beloved daughter, lighted two torches at the flames of Mount Etna, and wandered through the world in fearch of h^r.-; till hearing at laft where flie vvas,flie carried her complaint to Jupiter, who, en her repeated folicitations, promifed that Proferpine fiiould be refton d to her, provided fte had not yet tafl:ed any thing in hell. Ceres joyfully bore this commifiion, and her daughter was preparing to return, when Afcalaphus, the fon of Acheron and Gorgyra, gave information, that he faAv Proferpine eat fome grains of a pomegranate file had gathered in Pluto's orchard, fo that her return vx^as irr.m^ediately countermanded. Afcalaphus was for this mialicious intelligence transformed into a toad. But Jupiter, in order to mitigate the grief of Ceres, for her difappointment, granted that her daughter Ihould half the year rcflde with her, and the other half cnitiijue in hell with her huflDand. It is eafy to fee, that this part of the fable alludes to the corn, which muft remain ail the winter hid in the ground, in order to fprout forth in the fpring, and produce the harveft. Pluto vras extremely revered both amongft the Greeks and Romans. He had a m.agniflcent temple at Pylos, near which was a rnountaii., that derived
its name from the nymph Menthe, whom Proferpine, outof jealoufy at Pluto's familiarity v.-irh her, changed into the herb called mint. Near the river Corclhis, in Eocotia, this deity had aifo an altar in com
mon with Pallas, for fom.e myilical reafon. l"he Greeks called him Agekims, becaufe all mirth and laughter werebanifhed his dominions ; as 2A{o Hades, on account of the glocminefs of his dominions.
Among the Romans he had the name of Februus, from tlie luftrations ufed at funerals, and Summ^anus, becaufe he was the chief of ghofts, or rather the prince of the infernal deities. He was alfo called the terreftrial or infernal Jupiter. His (8) In ilic Valley of j^tna, near mount /Stna*

Black bulls were the vidtims offered up, and the ceremonies were performed in the night, it not being lawful to facrifice to him in the daytime (9). Pluto is generally reprefented in an ebony chair, drawn by four black horfes, whofe names the poets have been careful to fubmit (i) to us. Sometimes he holds a fceptre to denote his power, at others a wandy with which he commands and drives the ghofts. Homer fpeaks of his helmet, as having the quality of rendering the wearer inrilTible ; and tells us, that Minerva borrowed it when fhe fought againft the Trojans, to be concealed from Mars. Let us now feek the mythology of the fable in that

Pluto was indeed the funeral Ofiridof the Egyptians. Thefe people (2) every year, at an appointed feafon, aflembled to mourn over and ofi'er facrifices for their dead. The image that was expofed, to denote the approach of this folemnity, had the name of Peloutah (3) or the Deliverance, becaufe they regarded the death of the good, as a deliverance from evil.

OF THE INFERNAL REGIONS.
I T is evident that the Heathens had a notion of future punifhments and rewtirds, from the defcription their poets have given of Tartarus and Elyhum, though the Vv'hole is overloaded with fiction. According to Plato, Apollo and Ops brought certain brazen tablets from the H) perb'.)reans to Deios, defcribing the court of Pluto as little inferior to that of Jove ; but that the approach to it was exceeding difficult on account of the rivers Acheron, Cocytus, Styx, and Phlegcthon, which it Avas ntcefiary to pafs in order to reach thefe infernal regions. Acheron was, according to feme, the fon of Titan and Terra, or, as others fa}-, born of Ceres in a cave, withou':' a leather.

Cocytus and Phlegethon are faid to flow out of Styx by contrary ways, and re-unite to increafe the vaft channel of Acheron.

OF NOX, AND HER PROGENY, DEATH, SLEEP, &:C.
In O X was the moft ancient of the deities, and Orpheus afcribes to her the generation of gods and men. She was even reckoned older than Chao?. She had a numerous offspring qf imaginary' children, as Lyfia, or Marlnefs, Erys, or Contention, Death, Sleep, and Dreams ; all which llie bore without a father. From her maniage with Erebus, proceeded Old Age, Labour, Love, Fear, Deceit, Emulation, Mifery, Darknefs, Complaint, Obftinacy, Partiality, Want, Care, Difappointmcnt, Difeafe, War, pi.d Hunger. In iliort, all the evils wliicb attend life, and v/hich wait round the palace of Pluto, to receive his commands. Death brings down all mortals to the infernal ferry.
It is faid that her mother Nox be (lowed a peculiar cire in her education, and that Death had a great afe^fiion for her brother Somnus, or Sleep, of whofe palace Virgil has given us a fine defcription, JEneid,
VI. 894. Somnus had feveral children, of whom Morpheus was the moft remarkable for his fatyrjcal humour, and excellent talent in myuicking the actions of mankind. Amongft

After entering the infernal regions, jufc at the
feparation of the two roads whicli le;-.d to Tartarus and Ely hum, is placed the tribiiiial of the tiiree in
exorable judges, who examine the dead, and pafs a
final fcntence on departed fou'r.. The chief of thefo was Minos, the fon of Jfupiter by Europa, and brother of Ivhadamanthus ard Sarpedon. After his father's death the Cretins would not admit him to facceed in the kingdom, till praying to Neptune to give him a fign, that god caufed a horle to rife (>'it of the f-ia, en which he obtained the kingdom. Some think this alludes to Lis reducing thefe illanders to fubjection, by means or a powerful fleet. It is added, that Jove kept him nine years concealed in a cave, to teach himlav/s and the arc of government. Rhadamanthus, his brother, was alfo a great legiHator. It is faid that having killed his brother, he fled to Oecbalia in Bceo'da, where he married Alcmena, the widow of Amphytrion. His province was to judge fuch as died im.penitent.
JEacus was the fon of Jupiter by iSgina. When the iile of iSgina (fo called from his mother) was depopulated by a plague, his father, in compaflion to his grief, changed all the ants there into men and women. The meaning of which fable is, that when the pirates depopulated the country, and forced the people to fiy to caves, ^2acu3 encouraged them to come out, and by commerce and iiidullry recover what they had loft.

or TARTARUS, AND THE EUMENIDES, OR FURIES.
i N the recefies of the infernal regions lay the feat
or abode of the wicked fouls, called Tartarus, reprefented by the poets as a vaft deep pit, furrounded with walls and gates of brafs, and totally deprived of light. This dreadful prifon is furrounded by the waters of Phlegethon, which emit continual flames. The cuftody of the unfortunate wretches doomed to this place of punilhment, is given to the Eumenide^, cr Furies, who are at once their goakrs and executioners.^ ^
The names of thefe avengeful fillers were Titlphone, Aledo, and Megaera : but they v/cnt by the general appellation of the Furix, on account of the rage and diftradlion attending a guilty confcience ; of Erynniae, or Erynnis, becaufe of the feverity of their puniflimcnt ; and Eumenides, becaufe though cruel, they were capable of fupplication, as Oreftes found by following the advice of Pallas. Their birth is fo differently related, that it is impoffible to lix their genealogy or parentage. Indeed the theogany of the Greeks and Romans requires an uncom
mon clue to get out of the labyrinth which fidion has contrived. Though the Furies were implacable, they were fuf

Thele goddelFes were fo terrible, that it Avas in fome degree iacrilegious to invoke their narne.. Yet however the objedts of terror, they had their temples, as at Athens near the Areopagus, at Caiina in Arcadia, and at Carnia in the Peleponnefur. But their higheft folemnities were at Tclphufiain Arcadia, where their prieftefres went by the name of Hefycl idce, and the facrifices were performed at midnight, amidft a profound iilence, a black ewe burnt whole
being the vivflim. No wine Vv^as ufcd in the libati'jns,
but only limpid water, or a liquor made of honey ; and the wreaths ufed were of the flowers of the Narciflus and Crocus intermixed. The mythologifts have affigned each of thefe tormentrefles their particular department. Tifiphone is faid to punifh the (ins arifing from hatred and anger; Jvlegxra, thofe occafioned by envy ; and Aled:o, the crimes owing to ambition and luft. Some make but one fury, called Adraftia, the daughter of Jupiter and Neceffity, and the avenger of all vice. The furies are depidted with hair compofed of fnakes, and eyes inflamed with madnefs, carrying in one hand whips and iron chains, and in the other flaming torches, yielding a difmal light. Their robes are black, and their feet of brafs, to fhew their purfuit, though flow, is fteady and certain. Is it poffible to conceive, that after this folemn and horrid reprefentation, the Eumenides, or Furies, fhould be quite harmlefs beings ? and the very deformities afcribed to them the fymbols of national joy and repofe ? The Egyptians ufed thefe figures to

OF THE FABULOUS PERSONS PUNISHED JM TARTARUS.
'"i V II E poetS; in order to people this d^fnial region, have placed here the Giants or Titans, who rebelled
?gainlt Jupiicr, and who are bound in cverlafting chains. They alfo mention feveral other notorious
criminals condemned to fufFer here, the chief of whom fo'luv/ : Titius was the fon of Jupiter and Elara, daughter of the river Crchomenius in ThefTaly. His father, apprehenfive of Juno's jealoufy, it is faid, concealed him in the earth, where he grew to a monftrous bulk.
He refided in Panopcsa, v/here he became formidable for rapine and cruelty, till Apollo killed him for endeavouring to ravirn Latona ; though others fay, he was flain by Diana, for an attempt on her chafiity. He was next fent to Tartarus, and chained down on his back, his body taking up fach a compafs as to cover nine acres. In this poiUire a vulture conUnually -preyed on his liver, which ftill grew again asfafl: as it was con fumed. Phiegyas was the fon of Mars, and king of the I-apithce, a people of Theffaly. Apollo having debauched his daughter Coronis, to revenge the injury he fet fire to the t'!mple of Delphos ; fur which facrilege that god killed him with his arrows, and thruft him into Tartarus, where he is fentenced to fit under a huge rock, which hanging oyer his head, threatens him with perpetual deflrudtion.

fiderable preftnts to her father for his consent ; but to elude the performance, he invited him to a feaft, and murdered him. Stung with remorfe for the crime, he run mad, fo that Jupiter in coppaflion not onl/ forgave him, but took him up into' heaven, where he had the impiety to endeavour to coiTupt Juno. Jupiter, to be the better aflured of his wickednefs, formed a cloud in the fliape of his wife, upon which Ixion begot the Centaurs. But boafling of his happinefs, Jove hurled him down to Tartarus, where he lies fixed en a wheel encompafled with ferpents, and which turns vsithout ceafing. Sifiphus was a defcendant of iEolus, and married
Merope, one of the Pleiades, who bore him Glaucus. His refidence was at Epyra in Peleponnefus, and he was a crafty man. The reafons given for his puniihment are various, though all the poets agree as to its nature, which was to roll a great ftone to the top of a hill, from whence it conftantly fell down again, fo that his labour was inceflantly rei:fcwed(6). Tantalus, a Phrygian monarch, the fon of Jupiter and the nymph Plota, had the impiety, in an entertainment he gave the gods, to kill his fon Pel ops, and ferve him up as one of the difiies. All the deities I)erceived the fraud but Ceres, who eat one of his fhoulders ; but in cornpa/Iion to his fate, ihe reftored him to life, by boiling him in a cauldron, and gave liim an ivory arm to fupply the defe<ft. The crime
of the father did not pafa unpuniilied. He was placed in Tartarus, where he was alflidltd with eternal third and hunger, having water and the moft delicious fruits frill within his reach ; but not being able to tafie either, becaufe they vanifhed before his touch. Ovid IV. 445. Salmoneus, kin^' of Elis, (Virgil, iEn. VI. 585)

OF THE ELYSIAN FIELDS, AND LETHE.
Lj Y way of contraft to Tartarus, or the prifon of the wicked, let us place the Elyfian Fields, or the happy abodes of the juft: and good : of which Virgil, of all the ancient poets, has given us the molt agreeable pidure. Virgil's iEneid, VI. 6.^5. Itwereend1-fs to give all the variety of defcriptions, which a
fabjed of this nature affords room for. An eternal fpring of flowers and verdure, a ficy always ferene, a id fanned by ambrofial breezes, an univerfal harmony and uninterrupted joy embalmed thefe delightful regions. But at the end of a certain period the fouls placed here returned to the world to re-animate new bodies, before which they were obHged to drink
at the river Lethe (8), whofe waters had the virtue to create an oblivion of all that had pafied in the former part of their lives.
To illuftrate all this com.plexed chaos of fable, let
us once more have recourfe to the Egyptian mythology, where we fhall find the whole fecret of Tartarus, and the Elyfian Fields unravelled. There was near each of the Egyptian towns a certain ground appointed (7) He afterwards dethroned Danaus. (8; Atto t>j; AhQk?, or oblivion.

That at Memphis, as dcfcribed by Diodorus, lay on the other lide of the lake Acheriiria(9), to the fhore of which the deceafed perfon was brought and fct before a tribunal of judges appointed to examine into his conduft. If he had not paid his debts, his body was delivered to his creditors, till his relations releafed it, by colleding the fums due. If he had not faithfully obferved the laws, his body was left unburied, or pro
bably thrown into a kind of comman fhore called Tartarus (i). The fame hiftorian informs u", tliat near Memphis, there was a leaking veflel into which they inceifantly poured Nile water, which circumftance gives ground to imagine, that the place where imburied bodies were caft out, Vv^as furrounded with emblems expreffive of torture or remorfe, fuch as a man tied on a wheel always in motion ; another whofe heart was the prey of a vulture, and a third roliing a ftone up a hill with fruitlefs toil. Hence the fables of Ixion, Prometheus, and Syfiphus.
When no accufer appeared again/l the deccafv.d, or the accufer was convicted of falihood, they ceafed to lament him, and his panegyric was made ; after which he was delivered to a certain fevere ferryman,. who by order of the judge?, and never without it, received the body into his l3oat('z)and tranfported it acrofs the lake, to a plain embellilhed with groves, brooks, and other rural ornaments.

But Latona's troubles did not end here, for flying into Lycia with her children, fhe was denied "the water of the fountain Mela, by the (hepherd Niocles and his clowns, upon which flie turned them into frogs. After fettling her fon Apollo in Lycia, ihe returned to Delos, and Diana went to refide in Crete. The adventures of Apollo are pretty numerous. The moft remarkable are his quarrels with Jupiter, on account of the death of his fon Eiculapiits, killed by that deity on the complaint of Piuto, that he decreafed the number of the dead by the cures lie performed. Apollo, to revenge this injury, killed the Cyclops, who forged Jove's tlmndei-bolts, for which he wasbaniihed heaven, and endured great fufferings on earth, being forced to hire himftlf as a Ihepherd to (2) Admetue, king of Thefialy, during his excercifiug which oftice, he is faid to have invented the lyre or lute, to footh his trouble. In this retirement an odd incident happened to him ; Mercury was born in the morningj by noon he bad learned muiic, and compofed the teftudo ; and in the evening coming to Apcilo, he fo amufed him with this new inftrun\ent, that he found an opportunity to fteal his cattle. Apollo difcovcring the theft, and infifting on reftitution, the fiy deity ftole his bow and arrows ; fo that he was forced to change his revenge into laughter (3).
From Theflaly, Apollo removed to Sparta, and fettled near the river Eurotas, where he fell in love
with a fair boy called Hyacinthus, with whom being at play, Zephyrue-, through envy, blew Apollo's
quoit at his head, and killed him on the fpot. To
preferve his memory, the god from his blood raifed the flower which bears his name (4). Though according (i) Some affcrt that Diana affifled him in his fight. {2} Some give this hiftory another turn, and tell us that Apollo being king of the Arcadians, and dcpofed for his tyranny, fled to Adnicius, who gave him the command of t2>e country lying near the river Amphryfas, inhabited by ihcpherds.

cording to others he only tinged with it the violet (which was white before) into a purple. CyparilTus, a beautiful boy, a favourite of Apollo, being exceffively grieved for the death of a fawn or deer he loved, was changed by hi n into a cyprefs tree, which is fince facred to funeral rites. Apollo next vifited Laomedon, king of Troy, where finding Neptune in the fame condition with himfelf, and exiled from heaven, they agreed with that king to furniih bricks to build the wall of his capital ; he alfo afiifted Alcathous in building a labyrinth, in which was a ftor.e whereon he ufed to dopofit his lyre, and which emitted an harmonious found on the flighteit ftroke.
Though Apollo w as diftinguiflied for his excellency in mufic, yet he was extremely jealous of rivaifhip
on this head. The Mufes were under his immediate
protedion, and the grafhopper was confecrated tohim by the Athenians on account of its harmony (5),
We find Midas, king of Phrygia, being conftituted
judge between him and Pan, who pretended to vie with him in harmony, and giving judgment for the latter, was rewarded with a pair of afs's ears, topoint out his bad tafte(6). Ovid has defcribed this
ftory in an agreeable manner. Linus, who excelled all mortals in mufic, prefuming to fing with Apollo,, was puiiiflied with death ; nor did Marfyas the fatyr
efcape much better, for having found a flute or pipe
which Minerva threw away (7), he had the vanity to
difpute the prize with Apollo, who being decreed victor, hung up his antagonift on the next pine tree, and flayed him alive ; but afterwards changed him
into a river, which falls into the Meander.
This deity was fo ikilled in the bow, that his ar
rows were always fatal. Python and the Cyclops
experienced their force. When the giant Tityas endeavoured to ravifh Diana, he transfixed and threw
him into hell, where the vultures preyed on his liver.

Niobe, the daughter of Tantalus, and wife of Am
phion, being happy in feven fons and as many daughters, was fo foolifh as to prefer herfelf to Latona. This fo enraged Apollo and Diana, that the former flew her fons with his darts, and the latter killed her
daughters in the embraces of their mother, whom Jupiter, in compaflion to her inceflant grief, turned into a (tone, which ftill emits moiftuie inftead of tears (8). The true meaning of the fable of Niobe is this, it
fignified the annual inundation of Egypt. The affront (he offered to Latona was a fymbol, to denote the neceflity fhe laid that people under of retreating to the higher grouiKls. The fourteen children of Niobe are the fourteen cubits, that marked the increafe of the Nile (9). Apollo and Diana killing them with their arrows, reprefents labour and induflry, with the afliftance of the fun's warm influence, overcoming thefe difficulties, after the retreat of the flood. Niobe's being turned to a ftone, was owing to an equivocation. The continuance of Niobe was the prcfervation of Egypt. But the word Selau, which fignitied fafety, by a fmall alteration (Selaw) exprefltd a ftone. Thus Niobe became a real perfon metamorphofed to a rock. Apollo refembled his father Jupiter, in his great propenfity to love. He fpent fome time with Venus in the ifle of Rhodes, and during their interview it is faid the fky rained gold, and the earth was covered with lillies and rofes. His moft (selcbrated amour was with Daphne, (the daughter of the river Peneus)
a virgin of Thefialy, who was herfelf prepoflefTed in favour of Lucippus, a youth of her own age. Apollo, to be revenged upon his rival, put it into his head to difguife himfelf amongft the virgins who went
bathing, who difcovering the deceit, ftabbed him. After this the god purfued Daphne, who flying to preferve her chaftity, v^'as, on her intreaties to the gods, changed into a laurel ( I ), whofe leaves Apollo immediately confecrated to bind his temples, and made that tree the reward of poetry.

Of the children of Apollo we fiiall Ipeak more at large in the following fedion. Apollo had a great variety of names, either taken from lis principal attributes, or the chief places where he was worfhipped. He was called the Healer, fi-om his enlivening v/armth and cheering influence, and Pcean (4), from the peftilential heats ; to fignify the former, the ancients placed the graces in his right hand, and for the latter a bow and arrows in his left
;
Nomius, or the fliepherd, from his fertilizing the earth, and thence fuftaining the animal creation
;
Delius (5), from his rendering all things manifeft ; Pythias, from his victory over Python ; Lycius, Phoebus, and Phaneta, from his purity and fplendor. The principal places vvhere he was v/orfnipped were Chryfua, Tenedos, Srnyntha, Cylla, Cyrrlia, Patrcea, Claros, Cynthius, Absea, a city in Lycia, at Meletus, and amongft the JVIseonians, from all which places he was denominated. He had an oracle and temple at Tegyra, near which v/ere two remarkable fountains, called the Palm and the Olive, on account of the fweetnefs and trlnfparency of the v/ater.

from approacl.ing the oratle he Rcw him, and fo took poli'ciiion of it. His temple here, in procefs
of time, became fo frequented, that it was called
tUe oracle of the earth, and all the nations and princes in the world vied with each other in their munificence to it. Crcefus, king of Lydia, gave at one time a thoufand talents of gold to make an altar there, befides prefents of immenfe value at other times. Phalaris', the tyrant of Agrigentiun, prefented
it a brazen bull, a maiter-picce of art. The refponfes here were delivered by a virgin prieflefs (6) called Pythia, or Phoebus, placed on a tripos (7) or (tool with three feet, called alfo Cortina, from the fldn of the Python with which it was covered. It is uncertain after what manner thefe oracles were de

The ufual facrifices to Apollo were lambs, bulls, and oxen. The animals facred to him were the wolf, from his acutencfs of fight ; the crow, from her augury, or foretelling the weather ; the fwan from its divining its own death ; the hawk, from its boldncfs in flight , and the cock, from its foretelling his rife. The grafhopper was alfo reckoned agreeable to him on account of its mufic. Of trees, the laurel, palm, olive, and juniper, were moft in efteem with him. All young men, when their beards grew, confecrated their locks in his temple, as the virgins did theirs in the temple of Diana. The four great attributes of Apollo were di-vination, healingy mujic, and archery ; all which manifeftly refer to the fun. Light difpelling darknefs is a ftrong em.blem of truth diffipating ignorance ; vv'hat conduces more to life and health than the folar warmth, or can there be a jufter fymbol of the planetary harmony than Apollo's (7) lyre ?

The Ifis which pointed out the neomenia., or monthly feftival, before their annual inundation, was the fymbolical figure of a creature with the upper part of a woman, and the hiiider of a lizard, placed in a reclining pofture. This they called ],eto(8), and ufed it to fignify to the people the ncceffity of laying in the provifions of olives, parched corn, and fuch other kinds of dry food, for their fubfiftence,

This conquell: of the Nile was reprefented by an Orus, or image, armed with arrows, and fubduing the monfter Python. This they called Ores (9), or Apollo (i). The figure of Ifis
above-mentioned they alfo ftiled Deione, or Diana (2), and they put in her hand the quail, a bird which with them was the emblem of fccurity (3). Thefe emblems, carr:ed by the Phasnicians into Greece, gave rife to all the fable of Latona perfecuted by the Python, and flying to Delos in the form of a quail, where fhe bore Orus and Dione, or Apollo and Diana. Thus (as on former gccafions) the hieroglyphics, only defigned to point out the regular feftivals, and to inftrudt the people in what they were to do, became in the end the objects of a fenfelefs and grofs idolatry.
When Tyre was befieged by Alexander, the citizens bound the ftatue of Apollo with chains of gold; but when that conqueror took the place, he releafed the deity, who thence obtained the name of Philalexandrus, or the friend of Alexander. At Rhodes, where he was worfhipped in a peculiar manner there was a cololTal image of him at the mouth of the harbour fcventy cubits high (4). Phoebus (5) was very ditferently reprefented in different countries and times, according to the

The Hicropolitans fhewed him with a pointed beard, thereby exprefiing the ftrong emifiion of his rays dovvnv/ard ; over Ivis head was a bafket of gold, leprefenting the etherial light : he had a brealt-plate on, and in his right hand held a fpear, on the fummit of wliich ftood the image of vidory {i'o that Mars is but one of his att/ibutes) ; this l>;fpoke him irrefiftible and ruling all things : in his left hand wps a flower, intimating the vegetable creation nourifned, matured, and coiitinued by his beams : around his fiioulders he wore a veft, depided v/ith gorgons ami fnakes ; ^liis takes in Minerva, and by it is cxpreHed the virtue and vigour of the folar warmth, enlivening the apprehenlion and promoting wifdom; whence alfo he is with great propriety the preiident of the mufes : clofe by were the expanded wings of the eagle, reprefenting the aether, ftretched out from him a; from its proper center : at his feet were three female figures Encircled by a feraph, that in the midil: being the emblem of the eaith riiing in beauty from the midft of nature and confujicn (the other two) by the emanation of his li^hty fignified by the feraph or dragon.

poetical hiftory. The firft and moft noted of his fons
was iEfculapius, whom he had by the nymph Co
ronis. Some fay that Apollo Ihot his mother, when big with child of him, on account of her infidelity ; but repenting the fad, faved the infant, and gave him to Chiron to be inftruded (8) in phyfic. Others report, that as king Phlegyas, her father, was carrying her with him into Pelopennefus, her pains furprifed her on the confines of Epidauria, where, to conceal her fiiame, Ihe expofed the infant on a mountain. However this be, under the care of this new mailer he made fuch a progrefs in the medical art, as gained )um a high reputation ; fo that be was even reported to have railed the dead. His firil cures were wro\ight upon Afcles, king of Epidauriis, and Aunes, king of Daunia, which laft was troubled with fore eyes.
In fhort, his fuccefs was fo great, that Pluto, who faw the number of his ghofts daily decreafe, com
plained to Jupiter, who killed him with his thunderbolts. Cicero reckons up three of his name. The firft the

Others make it^fculapius an Egyptian, king of Memphis, antecedent by a thoufand years to the iEfcnlapius of the Greeks. The Romans numbered him amongft the Dii Adfcititii, of fuch as were raifed to heaven by their merit, as Hercules, Caftor, and Pollux, Sec. The Greeks received their knowledge of iEfculapius from the Phsenicians and Egyptians. His chief temples were at Pergamus, Smyrna, at Trica, a city of Ionia, and the ifle of Coos ; in all which, votive tablets were hung up (9), Ihewing the difeafes cured by his afiiftance ; but his moft famous fhrine was at Epidaurus, where every five years in the fpring, folemn games were inftituted to him nine days after the Ifthmian games at Corinth. The Romans grew acquainted with him by an accident ; a plague happened in Italy, the oracle was confulted, and the reply was, that they fliould fetch
the god ^fculapius from Epidaurus. An embafly was appointed of ten fenators, at the head of v»'hom was Q^Ogulnius. Thefe deputies, on their arrival, vifiting the temple of the god, a huge ferpent came: from under the altar, and crofling the city, went di

Let us now leek for the origin of this fable. The public iign or iVmbol expofed by the Egyptians in their aliemblies, to warn the people to mark the depth of the inundation, in order to regulate their ploughing accordingly, was the figure of a ma.n with a deg's head carrying a pole with ferpents twilled itjund it, to which they gave the names of Anubis (i), Thaaut (2), and ^fculapius (3). In procefs of time they made ufe of this reprefcntation for a real king, who, by the ftudy of phytic, fought the prefervation of his fubjedts. Thus the dog and the ferpents became the charaderiftics of JEfculapius amongft the
Rom.ans and Greeks, who were entirely ftrangers to the original meaning of thefe hieroglyphics. ^fculapius had, by his wife Epione, two fons, Machaon and Podalirius, both (killed in furgery, and who are mentioned by Homer as prefent at the fiege of Troy, and were very ferviceable to the Greeks. He had alfo two daughters, called Hygicea and Jafo. This deity is reprefented in different attitudes. At Epidaurus his ftatue was of gold and ivory (4}, feated on a throne of the fame materials, his head crowned with rays, and a long beard, having a knotty ftick in one hand, the other entwined with a ferpent, and a dog lying at his feet. The Phliafians depicted him as beardlefs ; and the Romans crowned him witli laurel, to denote his defcent from Apollo. The knots in his ftafF fignify the difficulties that occur in the ftudy of medicine. Phaeton was the fon of Apollo and the nymph Clymene. Having a difpute with Epaphus, the fon of Jupiter and lo, the latter upbraided him, that he was not really the fjn of his father, and that his mother only made ufe of that pretence to cover her
infamy. The youth, fired at this reproach, by his mother's advice carried his complaint to his father
Phoebus, who received him with great tendernefs, and, to allay his difquietude, fwore by Styx to grant him

The father, at once grieved and fui*prifed at the demand, ufed all arguments in vain to diiTuade him from the attempt ; but being by his oath reduced to fubmit to his obflinacy, he gave him the reins, with the beft diredlions he could how to ufe them. The ambition of our young adventurer was too fatal to himfelf. He loft his judgment and way together ; and Jupiter, to prevent his fetting the world on fire, was obliged with his thunderbolts to hurl him from his feat into the river Eridanus or the Po. His lifters Phaethufa, Lampetia, and Phcjebe, lauiented his lofs fo inceffantly upon the banks, that the gods changed them into black poplar trees, vrhofe juice produces the eledrum or amber. Cycnus, king of Liguria, no lefs grieved for his lofs, was changed into a fwan, a bird which became after facred to Apollo. This ftory makes a very confiderable figure in. Ovid (5), v.'ho has out-done himfelf on this fubjeA.
A late author offers an ingenious conjedure, with
regard to this fable (6). Linen-cloth was the great manufacture of Egypt, and the bleaching of it confcquently of great importance. The image expofed for directing this, was a youth with rays round his head, and a whip in his hand, feated on ^n orb, to which thev gave the name of Phaeton (7), and BenClimmah v8). Probably the months of JNIay, June, and July, were the three fifters of Phaeton, becaufe diiribg thefe months they wafhed their linen white ; jof which Cygnus, or the fwan, the friend of Phaeton,
is a further fymbol. Now as the v/ord Aibanoth, applied to thcfc months (9), fignifics alfo poplar trees, it gave rife to this mctamorphofes. Orpheus

Orpheus was the fon of Phoebus, by the mufe Calliope (i). He was born in Thrace, and refided near mount Rhodope, where he married Eurydice, a princcfs of that country. Arifteus, a neighbouring prince, who fell in love with her, attempted to furprife her, and in her flight, to efcape his violence, fhe was killed by the bite of a ferpent. Her difconfolate hufband was fo affeded at his lofs, that he defcended by the way of Taenariis to hell, in order to recover her. As mufic and poetry were to him hereditary talents, he exerted them in fo powerful a manner, that Pluto and Froferpine were fo far touched, as to reftore him liis beloved confort on or/e condition, that he Ihould not look back on her, till they came to the light of the world. His impatient fondnefs made him break this article, and he loft her for ever. Grieved at her lois, he retired to the woods and forefts, which it is faid were feniible of his harmony (2). But the Masnades or Bacchae, either incenfed at his vowing a widowed life, or, as others fay, inftigated by Bacchus, whofe worfhip he negleded (3), tore him in pieces, and fcattered his limbs about the fields^ which were collected and buried by the Mufes. His ?-ead and harp, v/hich were caft into the Hebrup, were carried to Lefbos, and the former interred there. His harp v/as tranfported to the flcies, where it forms one of the conftelfations. He himfelf Avas changed into a fwan, and left a fon called Methoi:, who
founded in Thrace a city of his own name. Ovid has given us this whole ftory (4) ; but contrary to hi,^ ufuai method, has brake the thread of it, by interfper'ing it in different parts of h'v\ work.

Let us feek the origin of this fable once more in Egypt, the mother-country of fidion. In July, when the fun entered Leo, the Nile overflowed all
the plains. To denote the public joy at feeing the inundation rife to its due height, they exhibited a youth playing on the lyre or fiftrum, and fitting by a
tame lion. When the waters did not increafe as they fnould, this Horus was reprefented ftretched on the back of a lion as dead. This fymbol they called Oreph or Orpheus (7), to fignify that agriculture was
then quite unfeafonable and dormant. The fongs they amufed themfelves with at this dull feafon, for want of exercife, were called the hymns of Orpheus ; and as hufbandry revived immediately after, it gave rife to the fable of Orpheus returning from hell. The Ids placed near this Horus, they called Eurydice (8), and as the Greeks took all thefe figures in the
literal, and not in the emblematical fenfe, they made 1 Xurydicc the wife of Orpheus. Idmon was the fon of Apollo by Afteria, and attended the Argonauts in their expedition to Colchis, being famed for his fkill in augury ; but wandering from his companions, as they occafionally landed, he was killed by a wild boar. Another of the children of Apollo was Linus,
whom he had by the nymph Terplichore. He was born at Thebes, and eminent for learning, if it be true that Thamyris, Orpheus, and Hercnle.^:, were sll his fcholars. Some fay he was flain by the latter for ridicuHng him ; but if Orpheus (as others affirm) lived a" hundred years before Hercules, it is rather probable that Linus was the difciple of Orpheus. However this be, Linus wrote on the origin of the world, the courfe of the fun and moon, and the produdion of animals. After (6) This probably gave rife to the fable of his making rocks and forefts move to his lyre. (7) From Oreph, occiput, or the back part of the hciicl.

After all, Linus was only a fymbol of the Egyp
tians, which the Greeks, according to cuftom, perfonated. At the end of autumn or harveft, the Egyptians fell to their night-work, of making linenelo'th (9), and the figure then expofed was called
Linus (i), and denoted the fitting up or watching during the night. Ariftxus was the fon of Apollo, by Cyrene, a virgin nymph, who ufed to accompany him in hunting,
and whom he firft fell in love with on feeing her
encounter a lion. He was born in Lybia. He re
ceived his education from the nymphs, who taught him to extract oil from olives, and to make honey, cheefe, and butter ; all which arts he communicated
to mankind. On this account he was regarded as a rural deity. From Afiica he pafled into Sardinia and Sicily, from whence he travelled into Thrace, where
Bacchus initiated him in his myfteries. We have
already mentioned how his paffion occafioned the death of Eurydice, to revenge which the woodnymphs deftroyed his bee-hives. Concerned at this lofs, he advifed with his mother, and was told by the oracle to facrifice bulls to appeafe her fhade ; V. hich counfel following, the bees wbich iffued from tlie carcafes fully fupplied the damages he had fuflaiaed (z). He died near mount Hsemus, and was deified on account of the fervices he had done to mankind by his ufcful inventions.

'J'hey were depided rs young, and the bird facred to thtm was the fwan (6).
To trace the origin of thefe fabulous deities, it is necelfary to obfcvve, that the nine emblematical figures, which M^ere exhibited amongft the Egyptians to denote the nine months, during which that country was freed from the inundation, had each fome infVrumcnt, or fymbol, peculiar to the bulinefs of the raonths, as a pair of compaiTes, a flute, a malk, a trumpet, &c. Al] thefe images v\'^ere purely hieroglyphical, to point out to the people what they were to do, and to afcertnin their ufe, they were called
the nine Mufts (7). The Greek?, who adopted this
froap of <ejxibiem$ as Jo many real divinities, took care to give each a particular name, fuited to the ioftrumentsthey boit, and which threw a new difguife upon the truth.

knew but two, to whom they gave different appellations (i). Eteocles, king of the Orchomenians, was
the firft who erected a temple to them. Pegafus was a winged horie produced by the blood which fell fi-om Medufa's head, when flie was killed by Perfeus. He flew to mount Helicon, the feat of the Mufes, where, with a ftroke of his hoof, he opened a fountain called Hippocrene, or the horfe's fpring (2). The unravelling thefe figures will convince us how juftly they belong to this article, as they complete its iUuftration. Near the nine female figures which bctokene:;^- the dry feafon, were placed three others, reprefeiiting the three months of inundation, and were drawn fometimes fwathed, as incapable of ufing their hands and feet. Thefe were called Charitout (3), or the divorce. The refemblance of this word to the Greek Charities, which fignifies thankfgivings or favours, gnve rife to the fable of the Graces, or three goddefles prefiding over benefits and outward charms. Yet, as during the inundation, all parts could not be fb fully fupplied, but that fome commerce was neceffary, they had recourfe to fmall barks, to fail
from r>-,ic city to the other. Now the emblematical jigure of a iliip or veflel, in Egypt and Phoenicia, was a winged horfe (4), by which name the inhabitants of Cadiz, a Phoenician colony, called their velfels. Now, if the Mufes and Graces are the goddefles which prefide over arts and gratitude, this emblem becomes unintelligible ; but if v/e take the nine Mufes from the months of adtion and induftry, and the three Graces for the three months of inundation and reft, the winged horfe, or boat with fails, is a true pidure of the end of navigation, and the re
turn of rural toils. To this figure the Egyptians gave the
fenfe of kindnefe ought never to die ; Euphrofyne, or chearfulnefi, to fignify that favours fliouid be conferred and received with mutual pleafure.

the name of Pcgafus (5), expi'eflive of its true meaning. All thefe images tranfplanted to Greece, became the fource of endlefs confufion and fable. By the Latin and Greek poets, the Graces are reprefented as beautiful voung virgins, naked, or but very flightly cloathed (6), and having wings on their feet. They are alfo joined hand in hand, to denote their unity. The Syrens were the daughters of Achelous. Their lower parts were hke fifhes, and their upper like women ; but they were fo (killed in muiic, that they
infnared all who heard them to deftrudion. Prefuraing to contend with the Mufes, they were vanquiihed, and (tripped at once of their feathers and voices, as a punifhment for their folly.
The Egyptians fometimes reprefented the three months of inundation by figures half female and half filh, to denote to the inhabitants their living in the midfl of the waters. One of thefe images bore in her hand the fifirum, or Egyptian lyre, to fhew the general joy at the flood's arriving to its due height, wliich was the afTurance of a fucceeding year of
plenty. To thefe fymbols they gave the name of Syrens (7), expreflive of their real mea,ning. The
PhcEnicians, who carried them into Greece, reprefented them as real perfons, and the Greeks and.
Romans had too ftrong a lalte for the fabulous, not to embelliih the fiory (i).

daughter of Jupiter and Latona. Her father, at her requeft, granted her perpetual virginity, beftowed en
her a bow and arrows, appointed her queen of the woods and forefts (2), and affigned her a guard of nymphs to attend her (3). She became the patronefs of hunting thus : Britomartis, a huntrefs-nymph, being one day entangled in her own nets, while the wild boar was approaching her, vowed a temple to Diana, and fo was preferved. Hence Diana had the name of Didtynna. Others relate the ftory different
ly, and fay that Britomartis, whom Diana favoured on account of her paffion for the chace, flying from Minos her lover, fell into the fea, and was by her made a goddefs. The adventures oiF Diana made a pretty confiderable figure in poetical hiftory, and ferve to fliew that the virtue of this goddefs, if inviolable, v/as alfo very fevere. Adaeon experienced this truth to his coft. He w^as a young prince, the fon of Ariftasus and Au
tonoe, the daughter of Cadmus, king of Thebes. As he was paflionately fond of the fpoit. he had the miffortune one day to difcover Diana bathing with her nymphs. The goddefs, incenfed at the intrufion,
changed him into a ftag ; fo that his own dogs miftaking him for their game, purfued and tore him in pieces. Ovid has wrought up this fcene with great art and imagination (4). The truth of this fable is faid to be as follows :
Aftaeon was a man of Arcadia, a great lover of dogs
and hunting, and by keeping many dogs, and fpending his time in hunting on the mountains, he entirely negle<5led his domeftic affairs, and being brought to ruin, was generally called the wretched A<5taeon, who
was devoured by his own dogs. Meleager was another unhappy vidim of her refentment, and the more fo as his punifhment was owing to no crime of bis own. Oentus, his father, king of iEtolia, in offering facrifices to the rural
deities, had forgot Diana. The goddefs was not of a charader to put up with fuch a negledl. She fent a huge wildboarinto the licldscfCalcedon,vvhoiaideTfry thing

thing wafte before him. Mcleager, with Thefeu>, and the virgin Atalanta, undertook to encounter it. The virgin gave the monfter the firft wound, and
Meleager, who killed it, prefented her the Ikin, which his uncles tookfrom her, for which' he ficw them. Althaea, his mother, hearing her two brothers had perifhed in this quarrel, took an uncommon revenge. She remembered at the birth of her fon the Fates had thrown a billet into the chamber, with an afiurrance the boy would live, as that remained uncon
fumed. The mother had till now carefully faved a pledge on which fo much depended ; but infpired by her prefent fury, fhe threw it into the flames, and Meleager inftantly feized with a confuming difeafe, expired as foon as it was burnt. His lifters, v/ho esceflively mourned his death, were turned into henturkies. Ovid has not forgot to embellilh his collection with this ftory (5). Others relate the flory of Meleager thus : Diana had, to avenge hcrielf of Oeneus, raifed a war between the Curetes and ^to
lians. Meleager, who fought at the head of his father's troops, had always the advantage, till killing two of his mother's brothers, his mother Althea loaded him with fuch imprecations, that he retired from the field. The Curetes upon this advanced, and attacked the capital of iEtolia. In vain Oeneus prefifes his fon to arm and repel the foe ; in vain his mother forgives and intreats him. He is inflexible, till Cleopatra, his wife, falls at his feet, and reprefents their mutual danger. Touched at this, he calls for his armour, iflues to the fight, and repels the enemy. Nor was Diana lefs rigorous to her own fex. Chionc, the daughter of Dsedalion, being carefied both by Apollo and Mercury, bore twins, Philamon, the fon of Apollo, a famous mufician, and Autolycus, the fon of Mercury, a Ikilfal Juggler or cheat. The mother was fo imprudent to boaft of her fliame, and prefer the honour of being miftrefs to two deities^ to fhe modefty of Diana, v.-hich flie afcribed to her want of beauty ; for this the goddefs pierced her tongue with an arrow, and deprived her of the power of future boafting or calumny. The river Alphcus fell violently enamoured of Diana, and having no hopes of fuccefs, had recourfe to

to force. The goddefs fled to the Letrini, where {he amufed herfelf with dancing, and v/ith fome art fo difguifed herfelf and her nymphs, that Alpheus no
longer knew them. For this, thefe people ere(5ted a temple to her. During the chafe one day, Diana accidentajly fhot Chenchrius, fon of the nymph Pryene, who bewailed him fo much, that Ihe was turned hito a fountain. Diana had a great variety of names ; fhe was called Cynthia and Delia, from the place of her birth ; Artemis, on account of her honour and modefty. By the Arcadians flie was named Ortholia ; and by the Spartans, Orthia. Her temples were many, both in Greece and Italy ; but the moft confiderable was at Ephefus, where fne was held in the bighefb veneration. The plan of this magnificent edifice was laid by Ctefiphon, and the ftructure of it employed for 320 years the ableft architeds and ftatuaries in the world. It was fet on fire by Eroftratus, on the day that Alexander the Great came into the world ; but was foon rebuilt with equal fplendor under Dinocrates, who alfo built the city of Alexandria.
The facrifices offered to Diana, were the firft fruits
of the earth, oxen, rams, and white hinds ; human vidims were fometimes devoted to her in Greece, as we find in the cafe of Iphigenia, Ker feflival was on the ides of Aueuft, after which time all hunting whs prohibited. Diana was reprefented of an uncommon high fta
ture, her hair difhevelled, a bow in her hand, and a quiver at her back, a deer-fkin faftened to herbreaft, and her purple robe tucked up at her knees, with gold buckles or clafps, and attended by nymphs in a hunting-drefs, with nets and hounds. Diana was alfo called Dcr. Triformis or Tergemina, on account of her triple charader, of Lr.na in heaven, Diana on earth, and Hecate in the infernal regions ; though the anions of the iirfi and laft are afcribed to her under the fecond name (6). Luna was thought to be the daughter of Hyperion
and Theia. The Egyptians worfhipped this deity
both as male and female, the men facrificing to it as Luna, the woa^.en as Lunus, and each fex on thefe occafions

occanons afiuming the drefs of the other. Indeed this goddefs was no other than the Venus Urania, or Gaglcflis of the AfTyrians, whofe v.-orlhip and rites the Phoenicians introduced into Greece. Under this charader Diana was alfo called Lucina, (a name fhe
held in common with Juno) and had the proteclion
of women in h!boiir (7), though fome make Lucira
a diftind goddefs from either (8), By this name fhc was adorntd by the JEginenfes and Eleans. If Diana was ib rigid in point of chaftity on earth, her virtue grew a little more relaxed when fhe got to the (kies. She bore Jupiter a daughter there, called
Erfa, or the Dew ; and Pan, who was not the moft pleafmg of the gods, deceived her in the fhape Of a white ram. But her moft celebrated amour was with Endymion (i), the fon of iEthlius, and grandfon of Jupiter, who took him up in to heaven, where he liad the infolence to folicit Juno, for wiiich he was caft into a profound fleep. Luna had the kindnefs to conceal him in a cave of mount Latmcs in Caria, where fhe had fifty daughters by him, and a fon called ^tolus, after which he was again exalted to the fkies. The faWe of Endymion had its origin in Egypt. Thefe people in the neomenia, orfeafl, in which they celebrated the ancient Rate of mankind, chofe a grove or fome retired fl:!ady grotto, where they placed an ifis, with her crefcent or moon, and by her fide an Horus alleep, to denote the ftcuiity and repofe which mankind then enjoyed. This figure they called Endymion (z), and thefe fymbolical figures, like the refl:, degenerated into idolatry, and became the materials for fabulous hiltbry. As the moon, Diana was rcprefented with a crefcent on her head, in a filver chariot drawn by white hinds,

on account of the lunar horns, Hecate was the daughter of Jupiter and Ceres. As to the origin of the name there is forne variation (5). She was the goddv.fs of the infernal regions, and on that account is often confounded with Profcrpine. She prefided over ftrcets and highways ; for which caufe fhe was called Trivia, as alfo Propyla, becaufe the doors of houfes were under her protection (6). The appellation of Brimo was given her on account of her dreadful fhrieks, when Mars, ApoHo, and Mercury meeting her in the woods, attempted to ravifh her. She was alfo famous for bota-ny, efpecially in difcovering baneful and poifonous herbs and roots ; as alfo for her fkill in enchantments and magical arts, in the pradice of which her name was conftantly invoked (7). Hefiod has given a very
pompous defcription of the extent of her power (8). She was f:;lcd in Egypt, Bubaftis. As Hecate, Diana was reprefcnted of an exceflive height, her head covered with frightful fnakes, and her feet of a ferpentine form, and furrounded with dogs, an animal facred to her, and under vvhofe form (lie was fometimes reprefented. She was alfo efteemed the goddefs of inevitable fate. If we have recourfe to the Egyptian key, we fhall find this threefold goddefs the fame fymbol with the Juno and Cybele we have already treated of. The Greek fculptors had too good a tafte to endure the head of the bull or goat on their deities, which they borrov/ed fiom that country. They therefore altered

He was the meflfenger of the gods, and the tutelar god of roads and crofs-ways (4), the inventor of weights and rneafures, and the guardian of ail merchandize and commerce, though this office feems but ill to agree with the adions afcribed to him. He was in a peculiar manner the protedlor of learning, being the firft difcoverer of ktterr-5 and the god of rhetoric and oratory.

of making all thofe Hermaphrodites who ufed its waters (6).
A late author gives this flory another turn.

The moft remarfcable adventure of Venus, was her famous conteft with Juno and Minerva for beauty. At the marriage of Peleus and Thetis, the goddefs Difcord refcnting her not being invited, threw a golden apple amongfl the company with tiiis infcription, Let it be ghrn to the fairejl (6). The competitors for this prize were the three deities above

mentioFjed. Jupiter referred them to Paris, youngeft fon of Priamus, king of Troy, who then kept his father's flocks on mount Ida. Before him the gcddefles appeared, as moft fay, naked. Juno ojffered him empire or power; Minerva, wifdom ; and Vtnus endeavoured to bribe him with the promife of \.\\t fatreji <u:oman in the ciuorld. Fatally for himfelf and family, the fliepherd was m.ore fufceptible of love than of ambition or virtue, and decided the point in favour of Venus. The goddefs rewarded him with Helen (7),
whom he carried olf from her hufoand Menelaus, king of Sparta, and the rape gave rife to that forraidable alibciation of the Greek princes, which ended in the deftrudlion of his family, and the ruin of Troy. Venus, however propitious flie was to lovers, was very levere to fuch as oiVended her. She changed the wom^en of Amathus, in Cyprus, into oxen for their cruelty. The Propa^tides, who denied her dignity, grew lb fliamplefsly impudent, that they v/ere faid to be hardened into ftones (8). Plippomenes and Atalanta were another inftance S3i her rcfentment

folicited Venus, by prayers and facrifices, to animate his beloved ftatue. His wifnes were granted, and by this enlivened beauty he had a fon called Paphoo, who gave his name to the city of Paphos in Cyprus (i).
A goddefs fo univerfally known and adored could not fail of temples. That of Paphos in Cyprus was the principal. In that of Rome, dedicated to her by the title of Venus Libitina, were fold all thin3:s necefiary for funerals. She had alfo a magnificent (hrine, built for her by her fon iEneas, on mount Eryx in Sicily. The facrifices ufually offered to her were white goats and fwine, with libations of wine, milk, and honey. The vidims were crowned with flowers or wreaths of myrtle. The birds facred to her were the fwan, the dove, and the fparrow. So far for the Venus Pandemos, or Popularis, the goddefs of wanton and effeminate love ; but the an
cients had another Venus, whom they ftiled Urania and Celeftis, (who was indeed no other than the
Syrian Aftart.) and to whom they afcribed no attributes bui fuch as were ftrittly chaile and virtuous. Of this deity they admitted no corporeal refemblance ; but flie was repreicr.ted by the form of a globe ending conically (a), and only pure fire was burnt on htr altars. Her facrifices were called Nephalia, on account of her fobiiety, only honey and wine being offered ; but no animal victims except the heifer, nor was the wood of fign, vines, or mulberries, fuffered to be ufed in them. This diltinction of two Venufes, the ckajie and the impure one, leads us to the true explication of the fable. In the different attributes of the Egyptian Ifis, we fee thefe contradidtory chara(5ters explained. The Ifis crowned with the crefcent ftar of fome of
zodiacal figns, is the celeftial Venus. The Ifis with the terreftrial fymbols, fuch as the heads of anin^ais, a multitude of breafts, or a child in her lap, became the goddefs of fruitfulnefs and generation, and confequently the Venus Pandemos. As the latter was regarded as a divinity propitious to luxury and pleafure,

%re, it is no wonder if (he foon gained the afcendant over her rival. In Phoenicia and Egypt, the young girls (3) conl'ecrated to the fervice of the terreftrial Ifis, ufually rehded in a tent or grove near the temple, and were common proftitutes ; whereas thofe devoted to the celeftial Ifis, or Venus Urania, were ftri(5tly chaile. Thcfe tabernacles were called the painlllon of the girls (4), and gave rife to the name of Venue,
afcribcd to the goddefs of love. The Syrians alio called the terreftrial Ifis Mylitta, or lUitlie (5), and
the Greeks and Romans adopted the fame name. Thus the fymbolical Ifis of Egypt, after producing the different deities of Cybele, Rhea, Vefra, Juno, Diana, Luna, Hecate, and Proferpine, formed alfo the dif
ferent charaders of the common and celeftial Venus
;
fo eafily dees fuperftition and invention multiply the objeds of idolatry. As Venus was the goddefs of love and pleafure, it is no wonder if the poets have been lavilh in the defcription of her beauties. Homer and Virgil have (6) given us fine pictures of this kind. Nor were the ancient fculptors and painters negligent on fo interefting a fubjed. Phidias formed her ftatue of ivory and gold, with one foot on a tortoife (7).

Before we dofe the article of Venus, it is ne
cefiary to give fome account of the deities who were ufuaily reprefented in her train, and formed a part of that ftate in which fhe ufuaily appeartd. The firil of thefe is Cupid. Some make him one of the moft ancient of the deities, and fay he had no parents, but fucceeded immediately after Chaos. Others report, that Nox, or Night, produced an egg, which having liatched under her fable wings, brought forth Cupi'i, or I^ovc, who, with golden pinions, immediately flew throug-h the v»'hole world
(9). But the common opinion is, that Cupid w;?-?
the fon of Mars and Venus, and the favourite child of his mother, who, v»'ithout his aid, as fhe confelTes in

who being drunk begot him on Penia, the goddefs 0: poverty.

in Virgil, could do little execution. Indeed the poets, when they invoke the mother, feldom fail to make their joint addrefles to the fon (i). Perhaps this
confcioufnefs of his own importance, rendered this
little divinity fo arrogant, that, on many occafions, he forgets his filial duty. This Cupid belonged to the Venus Pandemos, or Fopularis, and was called Anteros, or Luft. But the ancients mention another Cupid, fon of Jupiter and Venus, of a nobler charad:er, whofe delight it was to raifc refined fentiments of love and virtue, whereas the other infpired bafe and impure defires. His name was Eros, or true Love. Eros bore a golden dart, which caufed real joy and affection ; Anteros a leaden arrow, which raifed a fleeting paflion, ending in fatiety anddifguft. Cupid was reprefented ufually naked, to fliew that
love has nothing of its own. He is armed with a bow and quiver full of darts, to fhew his power of the mind ; and crovv^ned with rofes, to fhew the delightful but tranfitory pleafures he bellows. Sometimes he is depicted blind, to denote that love fees no faults in the objed: beloved ; at others he appears with a rofe in one hand, and a dolphin in the other ; fometimes he is feen itanding between Hercules and Mercury, to fignify the prevalence of eloquence and valour in love ; at others he is placed near Fortune, to
exprefs how much the fuccefs of lovers depends on
that inconflant goddefs. He is always drawn with wings, to typify, that nothing is more fleeting than the paflion he excites. The Egyptian Horus, which attended the terreftrial Ifis, or the V«.nus Popularis, orPandemos, was, according to the cuflom of the neomenia, reprefented with different attn'butes ; fcmctimes v»'ith the wings of the Etefian wind, at others with the club of Hercules (2), the arrows of Apollo, fitting en a lion, driving a bull, tying a ram, or having a large filli in his nets.

Hymen, the fecond attendant of Venus, was the god of marriage, and the fon of Bacchus and that

robbers, and to reftore them to their parents. On this account all maids newly married offered facii--. fices to him ; as alfo to the goddefs of concord. He was invoked in the nuptial ceremony (4) in a particular manner. This god was reprefented of a fair complexion, crowned v/ith amaricus, or the herb fvveet marjoram, and robed in a veil of faffron colour (reprefentative of the bridal blufhes) with a torch lighted in his hand, becaufe the bride was carried always home by torchlight. Every one knows it was a conftant cuflom of the oriental nations, on the wedding-day, to attend the bride-groom and bride with torches and lamps. The chorus on thefe occafions was, Hii! Humeneh!
Here he comes ! This is the fejii'val } (5) The figure exhibited on this cccafion in Egypt, was a young man bearing a lamp or torch, placed near the female
figure, which denoted the day of the month fixed for the ceremony.
The Graces, who always attended Venus, have
been already defcribed with the Mufes under the article of Apollo. The Horse, or Hours, were the daughters of Jupi

I HOUGH the hufband fhould ufually precede the
wife, yet Vulcan was too unhappy in wedlock to obtain this diftindtion. There were feveral of the
name (6) ; the principal, who arrived at the honour
of being deified, was the fon of Jupiter and Juno, or, as others fay, of Juno alone ; however this be, he was fo remarkably deformed, that his father
threw him down from heaven to the ifle of Lemnos, and in the fall he broke his leg (7). Others report,
that Juno herfelf, difgufted at his fight, hurled him into the fea, where he was nurfed by Thetis (8). The firft rcfidence of Vulcan on earth was the ifle 'of Lemnos (9), where he fet up his forge, and taught
men how to foften and polifh brafs and iron. From thence he removed to the Liparean ifles, near Sicily, where, with the affiftance of the Cyclops, he made Jupiter frefa thunderbolts, as the old grew decayed. He alfo wrought an helmet for Pluto, which rendered him invifible ; a trident for Neptune, that Ibook both land and fea ; and a dog of brafs for Jupiter, which he animated, fo as to perform (i) all the natural functions of the animal. Nor is this a wonder, when we conlider, that, at the defire of the fame god,
he formed Pandora, who was fent with the fatal box to Prometheus, as has been related in its place. In fhort, Vulcan was the general armourer of the gods, lie made Bacchus a golden crown, to prefent F 2 Ariadne;

divine armour of Achilles, whofe fhield is fo beauti
fully defcribed by Homer (2); as alfo the invincible
armour of iEneas, at the entreaty of Venus. To
conclude, with an inftance of his fkill this way, in revenge for his mjt?ier Juno's unkindnefs, he prefented her a golden chair, managed by fuch unfeen
fprings, that when fhe fat down in it fhe was not able to move, till fhe was forced to beg her deliverance from him. Vulcan, like the reft of the gods, had feveral names or appellations : he was called Lemnius, from the ifle of Lemnos, confecrated to him ; Mulciber, or Mulcifer, from his art of foftening ftcel and iron. By the Greeks, Hephaiftos, from his delighting in flamesj cr fire ; and JEtneus and Lipareus, from the places fuppofed to be his forges (3). As to his
\vorfliip, he had an altar in common with Prometheus
(4), and was one of the gods who prefided over marriage, becaufe he firft introduced the ufe of torches . at the nuptial rites. It was cuftomary with many nations after vidory, to gather the enemy's arms in an heap, and offer them to Vulcan. His principal temple was in a confecrated grove at the foot of Mount JEtna, guarded by dogs, who had the difcernment to diftinguifli his votaries, to tear the vicious, lind fawn upon the virtuous. The proper facrifice to this deity was a lion, to •denote the refiftlefs fury of fire. His feftivsls were diflerent : at thofe called Proter\'ia (amongft the Romans) they ran about with lighted torches. The Vulcania were celebrated by throwing living animals into the fire. The Lampadophoria were races performed to his honour, where the contention was to carry ligfhted torches to the goal ; but whoever overtook the perfon before him, had the privilege of delivering him his torch to carry, and to retire with honour. Vulcan, hovv-ever difagreeable his perfon, was ienfible of love : his firfl pafTion was for Minerva, and he

he had Jupiter's confent to make his addreffes to her ;, but his courtfliip was too ill placed to be i'uccefsful. He was more fortunate in his fuit to Venus, though
he had no great reafon to boaft his lot. The goddefs was too great a beauty to be conftant, and Vulcan too difagrceable to be happy. She chofe Mars for her gallant, and the intrigue for fome time went on fwimmingly. As Apollo, or the Sun, had a fricndIhip for the hulband. Mars was particularly fearful of his difcovering the affair, and therefore fet a boy called Aledryon, or Galium, to warn him and his fair mifirefs of the Sun's approach. The fentinel unluckily fell a Deep, and fo the Sun faw them together, and let Vulcan prefently into the fecrct. The blackimith god, to rtveiige the injury, againft their next meeting, contrived fo fine and imperceptible a net- work, that they were taken in their guilt, and expofed to the ridicule of the gods, till reJeafed at the intercelfion of Neptune. Mars, to punifh Aie<fiiyon fur his negled, changed him into a cock, who, to atone for his fault, by his crowing, gives conilant notice of the fun-rife (5). This cieity, as the- god of fire, was reprefented rarioufly in difierent nations. The Egyptians depidted him proceeding out of an egg, placed in the mouth of Jupiter, to denote the radical or natural heat diffused through all ccated beings. Some hiftorians
make him one of the firft Egyptian kings, who for his goodnefs was deified ; and add, that king Menes eredcd a noble temple to him at Thebes with a colofTal ftatue feventy-five feet high. The Phoenicians adored him by the name of Chryfor, and thought him the author and caufe of lightning and all fieryexhalations. Some writers confound him with the Tubal Cain of fcripture. In ancient gems and medals of the Greeks and Romans, he is figured as a lame, deformed, and fqualid man, working at the anvil, and ufually attended by hig men the Cyclops,
or by fome god or goddefs who come to alk his affiftancc. To examine into the ground of this fable, we muft

Now as this Horus was removed from the fide of the beautiful Ifis (or the Venus Pandemos) to make room for the martial Horus, expofed in time of Avar, it occafioned the jeft of the afiiftants, and gave rife to the fable of Vulcan's being fupplanted in his wife's affedlions by the god of war.

We have already had occafion to obferve how this
goddefs vowed a perpetual virginity, and in what
manner flie rejected the addrefles of Vulcan. She was indeed very delicate on this point, for fhe deprived Tirefias of his fight, becaufe he accidentally faw her bathing in the fountain of Helicon ; but at the interceflion of his mother Charicle, fhe relented fo far, that, to compenfate his lofs, fhe endued him
with the gift of prophecy (3). Nor was fhe lefs
fevere to Medufa, who being ravifhed by Neptune in her temple, fhe revenged the facrilege, by turning her locks into fnakes, and caufing all who beheld her after to be changed into ftones. She was equally jealous of her fuperiority in the arts fhe invented. Arachne, a Libyan princefs, the daughter of Idmon, had the prefumption to chal
lenge her at fpinning. The folly coft her dear ; for Minerva ftruck her with the fpindle on the forehead, for which attempting to hang herfelf, through dtfpair, the goddefs turned her into a fpider, in which fiiape fhe ftill exercifes the profeliion ihe fo much boaflcd

The meaning of this fable was to point out, that agriculture was to a riling^ colony of more importance than navigation. Minerva was highly honoured, and had feveral temples both in Greece and Italy. The Athenians,
who always had a particular devotion to her, as the patronefs of their city, in the flourifliing ftate of their republic, erefted a magnificent temple to her by the name of Parthenis, or the virgin goddefs, in which they placed her ftatue of gold and ivory thirty-nine feet high, wrought by the hand of Phidias. She had a (lately temple at Rome, on mount Avcntine, where her feftival, called Minervalia, or Quinquatria, was celebrated for five days fucceffively in the month of
March. She had fometimes her altars in common with Vulcan, fometimes with Mercury. The ufual vidtim offered her was a while heifer never yoked. The animals facred to her were the cock, the owl,, and the bafilifk.
We mufl not here omit the Palladium (6) or that
facred ftatue of her which fell down from heaven,, and was preferved in Troy, as a treafure on whofe fafcty that of the. city depended. Diomedes and
Ulylfes found means to fleal it, and the city was foon after taken and deftroyed(7). However, it is certain that ^^neas brought either this or another of
the fame kind with him into Italy, and depofited it at Lavinium, from whence it was removed to Rome,
and placed in the temple of Vcfta. When this edi

Come we next to enquire into the mythological
birth and origin of this fabled goddefs, who is no other than the Egyptian Ifis under a new drefs or form, and the fame with the Pales, or rural goddefs of the Sabines (8). The Athenians, who were an JEgyptian colony from Sais, foilowed the cuftoms of their anceftors, by particularly applying themfelves to railing flax for linen cloth, and the cultivation of
the olive (9). Now the figure worfhipped at Sais,. prefiding over thefe arts, was a female in complete armour. This, as Diodorus tells us, was becaufe the inhabitants of this dynafty, were both the befi: hufbandmen and foldiers in Egypt. In the hand of this image they placed a fhield with a full moon depided on it, furrounded by ferpcnts, the emblems of
life and happinefs. And at the feet of this fymbol they placed an owl, to (hew it was a no<5turnal facri
fice. To this they gave the name of Medufa (i), exprefiive of what ihe was deligned to reprefent.
The Greeks who Vv'ere ignorant of the true meaning of all this, did not think fit to put fuch a favourable fenfe on the head of Medufa, which feemed to them an objedl of horror, and opened a fine field for poetical imagination. The prefling of the olives did indeed turn fruit into Hones in a literal fenfe ; hence they made the aegis or ihield of Minerva petrify all who beheld it.
To remind the people of the importance of their linen manufactory, the Egyptians expofed in their feftivals anotherimage, bearing in her right hand the beam or inftrument round wliich the weavers rolled the warp of their cloth. This image they called
Minerva (2). Now there are ancient figures of Pallas extant,

extant, which correfpond with this idea (3). What ftill heightens the probability of this is, that the name of Athene, given to this ^oddefs, is the very word in Egypt for the flaxen thread (4) ufcd in their looms. Near this figure, which was to warn the inhabitants of the approach of the weaving, or winter feafon, they placed another of an infedl, whofc induftry feems to have given rife to this art, and to which they gave the name of Arachne (5), to denote its application. All thefe emblems, tranfplanted to Greece by the genius of that people, fond of the marvellous, were converted into real obje(5ts, and indeed afibrded room enough for the imagination of their poets to invent the fable of the transformation of Arachne into a fpider. Minerva, by the poets and fculptors, is ufually rcprefented in a ftanding attitude completely armed, with a compofetl but fmiling countenance, bearing a golden breaft-plale, a fpear in her right hand, and her terrible aegis in her left, having on it the head of Mcdufa entwined with fnakes. Ker helmet was ufually entwined with olives, to denote peace is the end of war, or rather becaufe that tree v/as facred to her. See her pidure in Cambray's Telemaque. At her feet is generally placed the owl or the cock ; the former being the emblem of wifdom, the latter of war.

port; of Quirinus, when on the defenfive, or at reft. By the ancient Latins he was ftiled Salifubfulus, or the dancer, from the uncertainty that attends all martial enterprifes. Mars was the god of war, and in high veneraticn with the Romans, both on account of his being the fa*her of Romulus, their founder, and becaufe of their own genius, always inclined to conqueft. Numa, though otherwife a pacific prince, having implored the gods, during a great peftilence, received a fmall brafs buckler, called ancik', from heaven,
which the nymph Egeria advifed him to keep with the

The hiftory of Mars furnifhes few adventures. We
have already related his amour with Venus, by whom he had Hermione, contraded to Oreftes, and afterwards married to IPyrrhus, king of Epirus. By the nymph Biftonis, Mars had Tereus, who reigned in Thi-ace, and married Progne, the daughter of Pandion, king of Athens. This princefs had a fifter called Philomela, a great beauty ; and being defirous to fee her, fhe requefted her hufband to go to Athesjs, and bring her fifter, wi:th her father's permiflion to her. Tereus, by the way, fell in love with his charge, and on her rejeding his folici^ations, ravilhed her, cut out her tongue, and endofed her in a ftrong tower, pretending to his vrife (he died in the journey. In this condition the unhappy princefs found means to embroider her ftory, and fent it to her fifter, who, tranfported with rage, contrived how to revenge the injury. Firft fhe brought her fifter home privately ; next fhe killed her fon Ilys, and ferved up his fielh to his father, for fupper
:
after he had cat it, fhe expofed the head, and told
him what fhe had done; Tereus, mad with fury,
purfued the fifters, who in their flight became tranfformed, Progne to a fwallow, and Philomela to a nightingale. Itys was by the gods changed into a pheafant, and Tereus himfelf into a lapwing. Ovid has (9) given us this ftory with his ufual embelhihments. Mars married a wife called Nerio, or Ntrione (i), which in the Saliine tongue fignifies valour or flrength.
He hadfcveral children, the principal of whom were

Some Cay this trial was in the famous Areopagus, or hill of Mars, at Athens, a court which, in fucceciiing time, gained the hightft reputation, for the juftice and impartiality of its proceedings (z). Mars was neither invulnerable nor invincible, for we find him in Homer both wounded and purfued by Diomedes ; but then it muft be confidcred, that Homer was fo good a patriot, that he always affects
to difgrace the gods who took the Trojan's part. Mars, whatever his appearance be, was of Egyp' tian original. This nation was divided into three clafles, the priefts, the hufbandmen, and the artificers ; of thefe, the firft were by their profefTion exempt from war, and the latter reckoned too mean to be employed in defence of the ftate ; fo that their militia was wholly taken from the fecond body. ,We have aLeady obferved, that in the facrifices which preceded their military expeditions, their Ifis appeared in a warlike drefs, and gave rife to the Greek Pallas, or Minerva. The Horus which accompanied this figure, was alfo equipped with this hdmet and buckler, iind called by the name of Harits (3), or the formidable. Tl e Syrians foftened this word to Hazis (4) ; the Greeks changed it to Ares ; the
Gauls pronounced it Hefus ; and the Romans and Sabines, Warets or Mars. Thus the military Horus of the Egyptians became perfonified, and made the god of combats or war. Mars is ufually defcribed in a chariot drawn by furious horfes, completely armed, and extending his fpear with one hand, while with the other hand he grafps a fword embrued in blood. His afpedt is fierce and fovage. Sometimes Difcord is repreftrnted as preceding his car, while Clamour, Fear, and Terror, appear in his train.

At laft Pan difcovered her retreat, and informed Jupiter, who, by the interceffion of the ParciE, or Fates, appeafed her, and prevailed on her to return to the world. For fome time fne took up her abode in Corcyra, from whence (he removed to Sicily, where the mif-fortune befell her of the rape of Proferpine her daughter by Pluto. The difconfolate mother immediately canitd her complaints to Jupiter, upbraiding him with in.^ permitting fuch an injuftice to be committed efpecially on the perfon of his own daughter. But obtaining little fatisfaiftion, ftie lig-htcd her torches^ at mount -^tna, and mounting; her car drawn by winged dragons, fet out in fearch of her beloved daughter. As her adventures in this journey were pretty remarkable, we fhall mentiontheminthei*- order. Her firft ftop v/as at Athens, where being hofpitably received by Celeus, fhe in return taught him to fow corn, and nourifhed his fon TriptoUmus with celeftial milk by day, at night covering him with fire, to render him immortal. Celeus, out of curiofity, difcovering this laft particular, was fo affrighted, that he cried out and revealed it bimfelf, on which the goddtfs killed him.

From thence Ceres pafled into Lycia, where being thirRy, and defiring to drink at a fpring, the clowns not only hindered her, but fullied and difturbed the water, reviling her for her mit.fortunes ; upon which (he turned thern into frogs. Thefe ftogs, though already punifiied for aftronting his fifter, had the folly to adc Jupiter to grant them a king. He fent them a

upon which the god lent them a water ferpent, who devoured them, and eftedually convinced them of their weaknefs. It is difputed, who fnft informed Ceres where her daughter was ; fomc afcribe t'lC inleUigem:e to Triptolemus, and his brother Eubuleus ; but the moft
part agree in giving the honour of it to the nymph Arethufa (a fountain in Sicily) (i) who flying the purfuit of the river Alpheus, faw this goddefs in the infernal regions.
We have but one amour of Ceres recorded. Finding Jafon, the fon of Jupiter and Eleftra, afleep in a Held newly ploughed up, fhe acquainted him with her paflion, and bore him Plutus the god of riches ; but Jove, incenftd to fee his fon become his rival, killed him with a thiinderbolt. Ceres had feveral names ; fhe was called Magna Dea, or the great goddefs, from her boimty in fupporting mankind ; Melaina, from her back cloathing ; Euchlasa, from her verdure ; Alma, Altrix, and Mammofa, from her nourifning and impregnating all feeds and vegetables, and being as it were the common mother of the world. The Arcadians, by way of excellence, fdled her Defpoina, or the Lady. She "syas alfo honoured with the peculiar epithet of Thefmophoris, or the Legiflatrefs, becaufe hufbandry hrft taught the ufe of landmarks, and the value of ground, the fource of all property and law. It muft be owned this goddefs was not undeferving the higheft titles given her, confidered as the deity who firft taught men to plough and fow, to reap and houfe their corn, to yoke oxen, to make bread, to cultivate all forts of pulfe and garden-ftufif (except beans), though fome make Bacchus the firft inventor of (i) The daughter of Nereus and Doris, and a companioa of Diana.

of agriculture. She alfo inftruded mankind to fix limits or boundaries, to afcertaih their polTeflions.
There was none of the celeftial aflembly to whom more folcmn facrifices were inftituted than to Ceres.
The place where fhe was principally woHhipped was at Eleufis, where her rites were performed in the moft folemn and myfterious manner. They were celebrated only once in five years ; all the matrons initiated, were to vow a perpetual chaftity. At the commencement of the feftival, a feafl: \yas kept for ^^ feveral days, during which wine was banifhed the altars. After this the proceffion began, which confifted in the carriage of thefacredbaflcets or canifters, in one cf which was inclofed a child with a golden feraph, a van, grains, cakes, &c. The, rcprefentation of the myfteries, during which a profound filence (a) was to be obferved, concluded thus : after a horrid darknefs, thunder, lightning, and v/hatever is moft awful in nature, Succeeded a calm and bright illumination, which difcovered four perfons fplendidiy habited. The firft was called the Hierophant, or the expounder of /acred things f and reprefented the Demiurgus, or fupreme being ; the fecond bore a torch, and fignified Ofiris ; the third ftood near the altar, and fignified liis ; the foiirth, \*hom they call the Holy Mefienger, perfonared
Mercury (3). To thefe rites none were admitTed^but perfons of the firft character, for probity or eminence. Only the priefts were fuffered to fee the ftatue of the goddefs. All the Aflembly ufed lighted torches, and the folemnity concluded with games, in which the victors were crowned with ears of barley. According to Herodotus, thefe rites were brought from Egypt to Greece, by the daughters of Danaus. Others fay, that Eumolpus, the fon of Triptolemus and Driope, transferred them, from Eleufis to Athens. The Thefmophoria, or lefler feftivals of Ceres,
were celebrated annually at Argos, and in many points refembled the Eleufinian myfteries, though they fell fhort of them very much in the dignity and grandeur of the celebration. Q^Memmius
(j) It was death to fpcak, or to reveal what palTcd in thefe religious rites. (3) The whole purport of this reprefentation, was defigned to allegorize the defolate ftate of mankind after the flood, and (hew tlic benefits of agriculture and induflrjr.



THE HEATHEN GODS. 117
Q^Memmius the sedilc firft introduced thefe rites
into Rome by the title of Cerealia (4). None were admitted to the facrifices guilty of any crime ; fo
that when Nero attempted it, the Roman matrons exprelFed their refentment, by going into mourning. Tliis ftllival was clofed by a banquet and pubUc horfe- races. I'he Ambarvalia were fcads celebrated by the
Roman hufbandmen in I'pring, to render Ceres propitious, by luftrating their fields. Each mafler of a family furniihed a vidim with an oaken wreath round its neck, which he led thrice round his tround, followed by his family finging hymns, and dancing in
honour of the goddefs. The offerings ufed in the
luftration were milk and new wine. At the ciofe of the harveft there was a fecond feftival, in which the goddefs v/as prefented with the firft fruits of the feafon, and an entertainment provided for the relations and neighbours. The beginning of April the gardeners facrificed to Ceres, to obtain a plentiful produce of their grounds, which were under her protection. Cicero mentions an ancient temple of hers at Catanea, in Sicily, in which the offices were performed by matrons and virgins only, no man being admitted. The ufual facrifices to this goddefs were a fow with pig, or a ram.. The garlands ufed by her in her facrifices were of myrtle or rape-wt^ed ; but flowers were prohibited,,^ becaufe Profcrpine was loft as (lie gathered them?'^ The poppy alone was facred to her, not only becaufe it grows amongft corn, but becaufe in her diftrefs Jupiter gave it her to eat, that fhe might fleep and forget her troubles. Let us now endeavour to find fome explanation of this hiftory of Ceres. If we have recourfe to our former key, we fi^all find the Ceres of Sicily and Eleufis, or'cf Rom.e and Greece, is no o ::her than the Egyptian Ifis, brought by the Phoenicians into thoie countries.

As corn and wine are the nobleft gifts of nature, fo it is no wonder, in the progrefs of idolatry, if they became deified, and had their altars. It is there
fore no unnatural tranfition, if from Ceres we pafs to Bacchus. This deity was the fon of Jupiter and Semele, (as has been obferved in the article of Jimiter) and was born at Thebes. Cicero mentions five (3) of the name. It is faid the nymphs took care of his education, though fome afcribe this office to the Horas or Hours ; others to the Naides. Mercury after this carried him into Eubas to Macris, the daughter of Arift€us (4), who anointed his lips with honey ; but Juno, incenfed at his finding a protection in a place facred to her, banifhed him thence ; fo that Macris fled with him into the country of the Phoenicians, and nourilhed him in a cave. Others fay, that Cadmus, father to Semele, difcovering her crime, put her and the child into a wooden ark, which by the tides was carried to Oreatae, a town of Laconia, where Semele being found dead, was buried with great pomp, and the infant nurfed by luo in a cave. During this perfecution, being tired in his flight, he fell afleep, and an Amphifbena, or two-htaded ferpent, of the moft poifonous kind, bit his leg ; but awaking, he ftruck it with a vine twig, and that
killed it.
_
In his infancy fome Tyrrhenian merchants found him afleep on the fhore, and attempted to carry him away ; but fuddenly he transformed himfclf into monftrous fliapes ; at the fame time their mafts were encompafled with vines, and their oars with ivy, and, ftruck with madnef^i, they jumped into the fea, where the god changed them into dolphins.

Bacchus, during the giants war, diftinguifhed himfelf greatly by his valour in the form of a lion, while Jupiter, to encourage his fon, ufed the word Euhoe, which became afterwards frequently ufed in his facrificcs. Others fay, that in this rebellion the Titans cut our deity to pieces ; but that Pallas took bis heart, while yet panting, and carried it to her father, who collected the limbs, and re-animated the body, after it had flept three nights with Proferpine(5). The moft memorable exploit of Bacchus was his expedition to India, which employed him three years. He fet out from Egypt, where he left Mercurius Trifmegiftus to aflift his wife in quality of co-regent, and appointed Hercules his viceroy. Bufiris he conftjtuted prefident of Phoenicia, and Antasua of Libya ;
after which he marched with a prodigious army, carrying with him Triptctemus and Maro, to teacK mankind the arts of tillage and planting the vine. His firft progrefs was weft ward (6), and during his
courfe he was joined by Pan and Lufus, who gave their names to different parts of Iberia. Altering his views he returned through Ethiopia, where the Satyrs and Mufes increafed his army, and from thence croffing the red fea, he penetrated through Afia to the remoteft parts of India, in the mountains of which country, near the fource of the Ganges, he eretled two pillars, to flicw that he had vifited the utmoft limits of the habitable world (7). After this returning home with glory, he made a triumphant entry iiito Thebes, offered part of his fpoils to Jupiter, and facrificed to him the richeft fpices of the eaft. He then applied himfelf folely to affairs of government, to reform abufes, enadt good laws, and confult the happinefs of his people, for which he not only obtained

teus, king of Egypt, was the firft who received him kindly. He next went to Cybella in Phrygia, where being expiated by Rhea, he- was initiated in the myfteries of Cybele. Lycurgus, king of the Edoni, near the river Strymon, affronted him in this journey, for which Bacchus deprived him of his reafon ; Jfo that when he thought to prune his vines, he cut off the legs of his fon Dryas and his own. 13y command of the oracle, his fubjecfts jmprifoned him, and he was torn in pieces by wild horfes. It is eafy to fee how inconfillent thefe accounts of the fame perfon are, and that the adions of different Bacchufes are afcribed to one.
We have two other inftances recorded of the refentment of this deity. Alcithoe, a Theban lady, derided his prieftefles, and was transformed into a bat ; Pentheus, the fon of Echion and Agave, for ridiculing his foleninities, called Orgia, was torn in pieces by his OAvn mother and lifters (8), who in their madncfb took him for a wild boar. The favourite wife of Bacchus was Ariadne, whom
he found in the iHe of Naxoo, abandoned by Thefeus ;
he loved her fo paffionately, that he placed the crown
(lie wore as a conftellation in the Ikies. By her he
had Staphilus, Thyoneus, Hymenjcus, &c.
CifTus, a youth whom he greatly efteemed, fporting with the Satyrs, was accidentally killed. Bac
chus changed him into the plant ivy, which became in a peculiar mann.^r confecrated to his worfhip. Silenus, another of his favourites, wandering from
his matter, came to Midas, king of Phrygia, at whofe
court he was well received. To requite tins favour,
Bacchus promifed to grant whatever he requefted.
The monarch, whofe ruling pallion was avarice, delired all he touched might be turned to gold; but
he foon felt the incon\eniency of having his wifh
granted, when he found his meat and drink convert

(i) Bacchus had a great variety of names ; he was called Dionyfius (2), from. his father's lamenefs while he carried him in his thigh : the appellation of Biformis -was given him, becaufe he fometimes was reprefented as old, fometimes as young ; that of Brifaens, from his inventing the wine prefs(3); that of Bromius, fi-om the crackling of fire heard when Semele perilhed by the lightning of Jupiter ; that of Bimater, from his having tv/o mothers, or being twice bom.
The Greeks ftiled him Eugenes, or born of an ox, becaufe he was drawn with horns ; and for the fame reafon the Latins called him Tauriformis. He was named Dsemon Bonus, becaufe in all feafts the laft glafs was drank to his honour. Evius, Evous, and Evan, were names ufed by the Bacchanals in their wild proceffions, as were thofe of Eleus and Eleleus. He was ftiled lacchus, from the noife (4) made by his votaries in their drunken ft-olics ; Lenasus, becaufe wine affuages the forrows and troubles of life (5);
Liber, and Liber Pater, becaufe he fets men free from conftraint, and puts them on an equality ; and on the fame account he was furnamed Lyccus, and Lycaeus (6) ; Nydtilius was an appellation given him, becaufe his facrifices were often celebrated in the night ; from his education on mount Nyfa, he gained the epithet of Nifaeus, as alfo that of Thyoneus, fi-orw rhyo his nurfe ; and that of Triumphus, from

fung hymns to the deity. The Athenians obferved a certain feaft called Apaturia ; as alfo others called
Afcolia and Ambrolia. The latter were celebrated in January, the mouth facred to Bacchus ; the R.omans
called them Brum alia, and kept them in February and Auguft (8) ; but the moft confiderable of the Romans, with regard to this god, were the Bacchanali, Dionyfia or Orgia, folemnized at mid-day in February, by women only at firft, but afterwards by both fexes. Thefe rites were attended with fuch abominable excefles and wickednefs, that the fenatc abolifhed them by a public decree (9).
The vidlms agreeable to Bacchus, were the goat and fwine, becaufe thefe animals are deftrudive to the vines ; the dragon and the pye on account of its chattering. The trees and plants ufed in his garlands w^re the ivy, the fir, the oak, and the herb rapeweed ; as alfo the flower Daffodil or Narcillus. Bacchus was the god of mirth, wine, and good cheer, and as fuch the poets have not been fparinjj
in his praifes. On all occafions of pleafure and focial joy they never failed to invoke his prefence, and to
thank him for the bleffmgs he beftowed. To him they afcribed the forgetfulnefs of their cares, and the foft tranfports of mutual friendfliip and chearful con
verfation. It would be endlefs to repeat the compliments paid him by the Greek and Latin poets, who, for the moft part, were hearty devotees to hi« worfliip.

But on the great farcophagus of his Grace the Duke of Beaufort, at Badminton, he is exprefled as

To arrive at the true original of this fabled deity,
,
-we mufl once more revifit Egypt, the mother-ceuntry of the gods, where he was indeed no other than the Ofiris of that people. Whence fprung another Bacchus, diftinguilhed from him, will preftntly ap

mark how their Horus changed his name and attributes, according to the feafons, and the circura
llances or operations he was intended to dired. To commemorate the ancient fcate of mankind, he appeared tinder Lhe fymbol of a child, with a feraph by his fide, ffnd aiTumed the name of Ben-Semele (3}. This was an image of the weaknefs and imperfedion of
hulbandry after the deluge. The Greeks, who knew nothing of the true meaning of the figure, called it the fon of Semele, and to heighten its honour made Jupiter his father, or, according to the eailern flile (4), produced him out of his thigh. They even ^mbelliihed the ftory with all the marvellous circumftances cf his mother's death, and fo effectually cornpi eat ed the fable.

thefe, preferred the name of Baccoth, out of which
they ccmpofed Bacchus. The more dehcate ear of the' Greeks chofe t^^e word lo Nifli, out of wliich
they formed Dionyfius. Hence it is plain, that no Bacchus ever exifted, but that he was only a mafque or figure of fome concealed truth. In ihort, whoever attentively reads Horace's inimitable ode to Bacchus (1), will fee that Bacchus meant no more than the improvement of the world, by the cultivation of agriculture, and the planting of the vine.

he was born at Malea, a city of Sparta ; others, at

kis cups, as we find in Virgil, who has given us a beautiful oration of his on the nobleft fubjeds (4},
in the fine eclogue which bears his name. Silenus is depided as a fhort corpulent old man, bald-headed, with a flat nofe, prominent forehead, and big ears.

The life-guards or tramed bands of Bacchus were
the Satyrs. It is uncertain whence thtfe half creatures fprung ; but their ufual refidence was in the woods and forefts, and they were of a verv- wanton and luflful difpofition ; fo that it wss very dangerous far a ftray nymph to fell into their hands. Indeed it was natural for them to ufe compulfion, for their fonn was none of the moft inciting, having deformed heads, armed with fiiort honvs, crooked hands, rough and hairy bodies, goats feet and legs, and tails as long as horfes.
We are now to feek feme explanation of this
groupe of ftgures, and to do this we muft have recourfe to the Egyptian key. As idolatry improved, the feafts or reprefeni.ations of thofe p>eople grew more pompous and fbVemn, fiiow degenerated into maf
qut^rade, and religion into farce or frenzy. The Ben-Semele, or child or reprtfcnt.ition, mentioned ir? the explanation of Bacchus, became a jolly rofy youth, who, to adorn the pomp, wis placed in a chariot, dra'ATi by a<flors in tigers or leopards (kJn*, while others, dreffed in thofc of bucks or goats, furrounded him ; and, to fhew the dangers they had gone through in hunting, they fmeared their faces with dregs of wine, or iiuce of miiXbernes, to imitate the blood of the bcafts they killed. Tbefe affiftants were called Satyrs (5), Fauns (.6), and Thyades (7),
and Msenades (8\ aiid BrtfTaridas (9). To clofe the
proceffion, appeared an old man on an afs, offering
wine to the tired youth, who had returned from a profperous chace, and inviting them to take fomcreft. This perfon they called Sylen (1), or Sylvan, and his drefs was detigned to fhew, that old men were exempt from thofe toils of youth, which, by extirpating beafts of prey, fecured the approaching harveft.

OF HERCULES AND HIS LABOURS.
J~l A VI NG gone through the Dii Majores, or celef
tial deities of the firft rank ; we Ihall proceed to the
deini gods, who were either thofe heroes whofe eminent adions and fuperior virtues raifed them to the fkies, or thofe terreftrial divinities, who for their bounty and goodnefs to mankind, were claiTed with the gods.
To begin with the former, Hercules undoubtedly claims the foremofk place. There were feveral of this name (2) ; but he to whom, amongft the Greeks, the greateft glory is attributed, was the fon of Jupiter and Alcmena, wife of Amphitryon king of Thebes. This monarch being gone on an expedition againft the JEtolians, Jove aiTumed his form, and under that fafe difguife eafily enjoyed his defires. It is faid he was fo enamoured, that he prolonged the darknefs for three days and three nights fucceflively. Herculeswas the fruit of this extraordinary amour, and at the fame time Alcmena bore twins to her hufband, Lao
<iamia,^and Iphiclus, who was remarkable fur hie extraordinary fwiftnefs. This intrigue of Jupiter, as ufual, foon came to the ears of his jealous wife, who from that moment
meditated the deftrudion of Hercules. A favourable occafioned offered to her refentment. Archippe, the wife of Sthenelus, king of Mycene, being pregnant at the fame time with Alcmena, Jupiter had ordained, that the child firft born fhould have the fuperiority, or command over the other. Juno caufed Archippe to be delivered, at the end of feven months, of a fon, called Euryftheus, and to retard the labour of Alc
mena, in the form of an old woman fhe fat at the gate of Amphitryon's palace with her legs acrofs, and her fingers interwoven. By this fecrct enchantment, that princefs was feven days and nights in extreme pains, till Galanthis, one of her attendants, feeing Juno in this fufpicious poflure, and conjedur

leg the caufe, ran haflily out with the news that her
miftrcrs was dehvered. The goddefs ftarting up at
the news, Akmena was that moment freed of her burthen ; but Juno was fo incenfed at Galanthis, that fne changed her into a weefel. During his infancy, Juno fent two ferpents to deftroy him in his cradle, but the undaunted child ftrangled them with both his hands. After this, as
he grew up, he difcovered an uncommon ftature and ftrength of body (3), as well as heroic ardour of mind^ Thefe great qualities of nature were improved by fuitable care, his education being intrufted to the greateft maRers (4) ; fo that it is no wonder if,
with fuch confiderable advantages, he made fuch a ftiining figure in the world. His extraordinary virtues were early put to the trial, and the tafks impofed on him by Euryftheus, on account of the danger and difficulty which attend
ed their execution, received the name of the Labours
of Hercules, and are commonly reckoned to be twelve in number. 1. The firft labour, or triumph of Hercules, was the death of the Nemaean lion. It is faid this furious animal, by Juno's diredion, fell from the orb of the Maon, and was invulnerable. It infcfted the Nemasan woods, betv/een Philus and Cleone, and
did infinite mifchief. The hero attacked it both with his arrows and club, but in vain, till perceiving his error, he firft ftrangled, and then tore it in pieces with his hands.

fed this creature is various (5) ; but all ?.uthors agree,
that when one was cat off, another fucceedtd in its place, unlefs the wound was immediately cauterifed. Hercules, not difcouraged, attacked this dragon, and having caufed lolaus to cut down wood fufficient for flaming brands, as he cut off the heads, applied them to the wounds, and by that means obtained the concjueft, and deftroyed the Hydra. Some explain this fal3le, by fuppofmg Lerna k marlh, much troubled with fnakes, and other poifonous animals, which Hercules and his companions deftroyed, by fetting fire to the reeds. Others imagine he only drained this fen, which was before unpaffable. Others make Lerna, a fort or caftle of robbers, under a leader
called Hydra, whom Hercules extirpated. However this be, in confideration of the fervice of lolaus on this occafion, when he grew decrcpid with eld age, his mafter, by his prayers, obtained a renewal of his youth. 3. The next talk impofed on him by Eiir^r^heus, was to bring him alive a huge wild-boar, which ravaged the foreft of Erymanthus, and had been fent to Phocis by Diana, to punifh Oneus for negleAing htrf facrifices (6). In his way he defeated the Centaurs,
who had provoked him by infuiting Pholus his hoft. After this he feized the fierce animal in a thicket, furrounded with fnow, and, purfuant to his injunction, carried him bound to Euryftheus, who had like to have fainted at the light. 4. This monarch, after fuch experience of the force and valour of Hercules, v.-as refolve to try his agility : for this end he was commanded to take a hind which frequented mount -Maenalus, and had brazen feet and golden horns.

Diomede, king of Thrace, the fon of Mara and Gyrene, was a tyrant pofTeired of a ftud of horfes, fo wild and fierce, that they breathed fire, and were con

ftrangers he could meet with for provender for his cattle. Hercules having vanquiflied him, gave him as a prey to them, and killing fome, brought the reft to Euryftheus. 8. The next employment of Hercujes feems a little
toe mean for a hero, but he was obliged to obey a
fevere tafk-mafter, who was fo fenlible of his own inj^iftice in thefe injuncflions, that he did not care to

promifed him, if he performed it, to give him a tenth part of the cattle. Hercules, by turning the coiirfe of the river Alpheus through it, executed his defign ;
which Augeas feeing, refufed to ftand by his engage
ment. The hero, to reward his perfidy, flew him
with his arrows, and gave his kingdom to Phyleus,
his fon, who had Ihewed his abhorrence of his father's treachery. Some add, that, from the fpoil* taken at Elis, Hercules inftituted the Olympic games of Jupiter, celebrated every fifth yearj and which afterwards gave rife to the Grecian sera. 9. Euryftheus, dcfirous to prefent his daughtcf Admeta with the belt or girdle worn by Hippolyta, queen of the Amazons, Hercules was fent on this expedition ; he was buf flenderly provided, having but one fhip ; but valour like his was never deftitute of refources in diftrefs. In his way he defeated and
killed Mygdon and Amj-cus, two brothers, who oppofed his paflage, and fubduing Bebrycia, gave it to
Lycus, one of his companions, who changed its name to Heraclea, in memory of his benefaiftor. On
his approach to Themifcyra, he learnt that the Ama
zons had colleded all their forces to meet him. The
firft engagement was warm on both fides, feveral of the braveft of thefe viragoes were kilied, and others made prifoners. The vidory was followed by the total txtermination of that female nation, and Hippolyta, their queen, was by the conqueror given to Thefeus, as a reward for his valour. Her belt he brought to Euryftheus. 10. His fucceeding exploit was againft Geryon, king of Spain, who had three bodies, and was the fon of Chryfaoris and Calirrhoe. This monarch had
a breed of oxen, of a purple colour, who devoured all ft rangers caft to them, and were guarded by a dog v/ith two heads, a dragon with feven, belides a very watchfid and fevere keeper. Hercules killed both the monarch and his guards, and carried the oxen to Gadira, or Cadiz, from v. hence he brought them to Euryftheus. It was during this expedition,,
that our hero, as eternal monuments of his glory, ere(5ted two pillars at Caipe and Abyle, upon the "Utmoft limits of Africa and Europe. Some give a more fimple turn to the whole, by faying Geryon
was a king of Spain, who governed by means of thrte ioiii famous for valour and prudence^ and that Hercules

cules having raifed an army of mercenary troops in Crete, firft overcame them, and fubdued that coun
try. 11. The next talk enjoined him by Euryflheus, was to fetch him tlie golden apples of the Hefperides (9)^ which were guarded by a dragon with a hundred
heads. The injunction was not eafy, fincc Hercules was even ignorant of the place where -they grew.
The nymphs of Eridanus, whom he confulted, ad
vifed him to go to Prometheus (i), who gave him the information and diredion he wanted, after which he vanquifhed the dragon, and brought the precious fruit to his mafter.
12. The laft command of Euryftheus was for him
to go down to hell, and bring away Cerberus, Pluto's maftiff. Hercules, having facrificed to the gcds, entered the infernal regions, by a cavity of mount Tjenarus, and on the banks of Acheron found a white poplar-tree, of which he made him a wreath, and the tree was ever after confecrated to him ; pafiing that river he difcovered Thefeus and Piriihous chained to a ftone. The former he re leafed, but left the latter confined. Masnetius, Pluto's cowherd, endeavouring to fave his mailer's dog, was ciuilied to death. Cerberus, for refuge, fled beneath Pkito's throne, from whence the hero dragged him out, and
brought him upon earth by way of Traezcne. At fight of the day, the monlter vomited a poilbnous matter, from whence fprurg the herb aconite, or wolf's-bane ; but being prefented to Euryftheus, he ordered him to be diimilfed, and fuffered him to return to hell. It would be almofl endlefs to enumerate all the adions of this celebrated hero of antiquity, and
tnerefore we (ball only. touch on the principril. He deUvered Creon, king of Thebcs, from an rr.'ufl tribute impofed on him by Erginus anrl the Mv..i£e, for which ier. ice that prince gave him his da-vhter Megara, by wiicm he had fcveral fons ; bui. junof Itriiving'

ftriking him with frenzy, he flew thefe children, and on recovering his fenles, became fo fhocked at his cruelty, that he abltained from all human fociety for fame time. In his return from the expedition againft the Amazons, Laomedon, king of Troy, by the promife of fome fine horfes, engaged him to deliver his daughter Hefione, cxpofed to a vaft fea monfter fent by Neptune ; but when he had freed the princefs, the deceitful monarch retraced his word. Upon this Hercules took the city, killed Laomedon, and gave Hefione to Telamon, who firft fcaled the Avails (a). After this he flew Timolus and Telegonos, the fons of Proccus, two celebrated wreftlers, who put
to death all whom they overcame. He alfo killed Serpedon, fon of Neptune, a notorious pirate. During his African expedition, he vanquifhed Cycnus, king of ThefTaly, the fon of Mars and Cleobu
lina, a favage pince, who had vowed to ered hi's father a temple with the heads or Ikulls of the ftrangers he deftroyed. Li Libya, he encountered the famous Antaeus, the fon of Earth, a giant of immcnfe fta
ture, who forced all whom he met to wreftle with
him, and fo ftrangled them. He challenged Hercules, who flung hiiA thrice, and thought each time he had killed him ; hut oa his touching the ground he renewed his flrcngth. Hercules being apprifed of this, held him up in the air, and fqiieezed him in fuch a Hianner, that iie foon expnred (3). In his progrefs from Libya to Egypt, Bufiris, a cruel prince, laid an ambufcade to furprize him, but was himfelf, and his ibn Araphiadamus, facriiiced by the vidor on the altars he had profaned. In Arabia, he beheaded Ematiiion, the fon of Tithonus, for his want of hofpkality ; after which, croflin^ mount Caucafus, he cleiivered Prometheus. In Calydon, he wreftled with Achelous, for no Icfs a prize than Deianira, daugh

and to redeem it, by giving the conqueror the horn of Amalthaea, the daughter of Harmo<lius ; which Hercules filled with a variety of fruits, and confccrated to Jupiter. Some explain the fable thus ; Achelous is a winding river of Greece, whofe ftream was fo rapid, that it overflowed the banks, roaring l^ce a bull. Hercules forced it into two channels ; that is, he broke off one of the horns, Said fo reftored plenty to the country This hero reduced the ille of Co06, and put to death Eurylus, king of it, with his fons, on account of their injuftice and cruelty ; but the princefs Chal
chiope, the daughter, he married, by whom he had
a fon named Thellalus, who gave his nanie toThefialy.
He fubdued Pyracmos, king of Euboea, who had,
without a caufe, made war on tht Boeotians. In his way to the Hefperidcs, he was oppofed by Albion,
and Brigio, two giants, who put him in great hazard, his arrows being fpent. Jupiter, on his pi^a^i^er, overwhelmed them with a ftiower of ftones, whence the place was called the ftony ficki. It lies in the Gallia Narbonenfis. Hercules did great fervice in Gaul, by deftroying robbers, fuppreflmg tyrants and opp^eflbrf:, and other adtions truly worthy the character of a hero ; after which, it is faid, he built the city Akfia, and made it the capital of the Celtas, or Gauls. He
alfo opened Itis way through the Alps into Italy, and by the coafls of Ligiiria and Tufcany, amvtd on the banks of the Tyber, and flew the furious robber Cacus, who from his den on mou!)t Aventine, infefled that country. Being denied the rites of hofpitality, he killed Theodania , the father of Hylas, but took the letter with him, and treated him kindly. Hercules, however inte-nt on fame and glory, v/as,

The monfter, feeing the opportunity favourable, offered violence o Deiahira, upon which her hufband, from the opp>ofite bank, pierced him with one of thofe dreadful arrows, which, being dipped in the blood of the Lernaean Hydra, gave a wound incurable by art. NelFus expiring, gave the pr ncefs his garment all bloody, as a fure remedy to recover her hufband, if ever he fhould prove unfaithful. Some years after, Hercules having fubdued
Oechjlia, fell in love with lole, a fair captive, whom he brought to Euboea, where, having erected an altar to facriiice to Jove for his viAory, he difpatched Lycus to Deianira, to carry her the news, and inform her of his approach. This princefs, from the report of the raeflenger, fufpedting her hufband's fidelity, fent him as a prefent the coat of NeiTus, which he no fooner put on, but he fell into a delirious fever, attended vv'iih themofk excruciating torments. Unable to (upport his pains, he retired to mount Oeta, and ereding a pile of wood, to which he fet fire, threw himfclf into the flames, and was confumed (4). Lycus, his unhappy friend and companion, in his agony, he firft hurled into the river Thermopolis, whert: he became a roc^ ; his arrows he bequeathed to Fhiioctetes, who buried his remains in the river Dyra. So perifhed tliis great hero of antiquity, the terror of oppreflbrs, the friend of liberty and mankind, for whofe happinefs (as Tul^y obferves) he braved the greateft dangers, and furmounted the moft arduous toils, going through the whole earth with no other view than the eftablifhing peace, juftice, concord, and freedom. Nothing can be added to heighten a charader fo glorious as this, Hercules left feveral children ; by Deianira he had
an only daughte/, called Macaria ; by Melita, who gave her name to the ifle of Malta, he had Hylus :
Afar, Lydus, and Scythes, were his fons, who are faid to have left their appellation to Africa, Lydia, and Scythia ; befidcs which, he is faid to have had fifty fons by the fifty daughters of Theftius. Kow*ever,

<fvcr, his ofFspring vv-ere fo numerous, that above thirty of his defcendants bore his name, whofe actions being all attributed to him, produced the confufion we find in his hiftory. Euryitheus, after his death, was fo afraid of thefe Heraclidae, that by his ill ufage he forced them to fly to Athens, and then It-nt an embaffy to that city to deliver them up, with menaces of a war in cafe of
refufal. lolaus, the friend of Hercules, who \vas then in the fhades, was fo concerned for his mailer's pofterity, that he got leave from Pluto to return to earth, and kill the tyrant, after which he willingly returned to hell. Hercules, who was alfo called Alcides, was, after his death, by his father Jupiter deified, and with great folemnity married to Hebe his half fifter, the goddefs of youth. At firil facrifices were only offered to him as a hero ; but Phasftius coming into Sycionia altered that method. Both the Greeks and Romans honoured him as a god, and eredted temples to him in that quality. His viiftims were bulls or lambs, on account of his prcfcrving the flocks from wolves, i. e. delivering men from tyrants and robbers.
He was called alfo Melius, from his taking the Hef^erian fruit, for which reafoa apples were ufed (5) in his facrifices. Mehercule, or by Hercules, was, ainongft the Romans, an oath oiiiy ufed by the men.
Many p^rfons were fond of afluming this celebrated name. Hence Diodorus reckons up three ; Cicero fix ; others to the number of forty-three. But the Greeks afcribed to the Theban Hercules the actions of all the reft. But the foundation of all v/as laid in the PhcEnician or Egyptian Hercules ; for the Egyptians did not borrow the name from the Grecians, but rather the Grecians, efpecially thofc
who give it to the fon of Amphitryon from the Egyptians ; principally, becaufe Amphitryon and Alcmena, the parents of the Grecian Hercules, were both of Egyptian defcent (6). The name too is of Phcenician extrasftion (7), a name given to the dif

was the fource of ancient heroifm and war (8). And however the Phoenician and Egyptian hero of this name may have been diilinguifhed by a multitude of
authors ; I am fully perfuaded, after the moft diligent enquiry, that they were indeed one and the fame perfon : of uhofe hiftory let U3 take a Ihurt review. About the year of the world 213 1, the perfon diilinguifhed by the name of Hercules Aflis (9), fuc
ceedcd Janias as king of Lower Egypt, being the laft
of the Hycfos, or ihepherd-kings from Canaan ; who had held the country 259 years. He continued the
war with the kings of Upper Egypt 49 years, and
then by agrecmtvit withdrew, with his fubjeds, to t^e number of 240,000. In his retreat he is faid to have founded firA the city of Jerufalcm(i), and afterwards that of Tyre, Avhere he was called Melcarthus (2). From Egypt he brought the computation of 365 days to the year, and fettled it in his OAvn kingdom, where it continued many ages. In his voyages be vifited Africa, v^'here he conquered Antaeus, Italy, France, Spain as far as Cadiz, where he flew Geryon; ifiia proceeded thence even to the Britilb ifles ; fettling colonies, and raifing pillars wherever he came, as the Handing monuments of himfelf, and of the patriarchal religion which he planted ; for pillars placed on eminences in circular order, were the tem
ples of tbofe early times, and as yet we find no foot
fteps of idolatry, either in Egypt or Phoenicia. To his arrival in thcfe iflands (and not in Liguria) muft be applied whatever is related of his encounter with.
Albion and Bergion, and of his being alhiled, when
his weapons were fpent, by a fliower of ftones from heaven. Albion is the name given afterwards to this
country ; and by the miraculous iliower of ftones no
more is intended, than that the inhabitants were at laft reconciled to him on account of the divine religion

purple dye, and feems to have been the nrft who applied the loadftone to the purpcfes of navigation, thence called Lapis Heraclius. He is fuppofed to have been drowned at laft ; and became afterwards one of the tirft objeds of idolatry amongft his countrymen. The folem.nities were performed to him in
the night, as to one, who after all his great fatigues and labours, had at length gained a time and place of reft. Manetho calls him Arcles. Hercules is ufaally dtpided in a ftanding attitude, having the Ikin of the Nemasan lion thrown over his flioulders, and leaning on his club, which is his infeparable attribute. The judgment of this hero, or his
preference of Virtue to Vice, who both folicit him to embrace their party, makes one of the frneft pidures of antiquity. The choice he made did no diihonour to his memory.

Caftor and Pollux were efteemed as deities propi tious to navigation : the reafon was this : when the Argonauts weighed from Sigseum (2), they v.-erc overtaken with a tempeft, during which Orpheus offered vows for the fafety of the ihip ; immediately two lambent flames were difcovered over the heads of Caftor and Pollux, whidi appearance was fucceeded with fo great a calm, as gave the crew a notion of their divinity.

the Argonautic enpedition. The word Gaza, in th<: Colchian language (the fame, according to Herodotue, with the Egyptian) fignifies a fleece as well as a treafure. This gave occaiion to the circumftance of ih^ Golden Fleece. The word Sor is alfo wall and a bull; Nachafli, brafs and a ferpent.

With thefe two great men, we Ihall clofe the lift of demi-gods and heroes. Thefeus was fon to JEgeus, king of Athens and iEthra. In his youth he had an early paffion for glory, and propofed Hercules for his model. Sciron, a notorious robber, who infefted the roads between Megara and Corinth, was by him thrown down a precipice, as he was accuftomed to treat fuch as fell into his hands. Procruftes, a famous tyrant of Attica, he fattened to a bended pine, which being loofed, tore him afunder (i). His firft diftinguifhing adventure was the deftrudion of the Cretan minotaur. Mines, king of that ifland, had made war on JEgeus, becaufe the Athe^ nians had bafely killed his fon, for carrying away the prize from them. Being vi»5torious, he impofed this fevere condition on the vanquifhed, that they fiiould annually fend feven of their nobleft youths, chofen by lot, into Crete, to be devoured by the minotaur (2). The fourth year of this tribute, the choice fell on Thef(?us, fon to JEgeus, or, as others fiy, he entreated to be fent himfclf. However this be, on the arrival of Thefeus at the court of Minos, Ariadne, his daughter, fell deeply in love with him, and gave him a clue, by which he got out of the labyrinth.- This done, he failed with his fair deliverer for the ifle of Naxos, where he ungratefully left her 1 ,0> and where Bacchus found her, and took her for

To gratify her, Dicdalus contrived an artificial

The return of Thefeiis, through his own negle^, be
came fatal to his father. The good king, at his departure, had charged him, as he f^iilcd out with black lails, to return with the fame in calc he mifcarried, otherwife to change them to white. Impatiently he every day went to the top of a rock that overlooked
the ocean, to fee what iliips appeared in view. At laft his fon's veflel is difcovered, but with the fable omens he dreaded ; fo that through defpair he threw himfelf into the fea, which ftill retains his name (4). The Athenians decreed ^geus divine honours, and Ijicrificed to him as a marine deity, the adopted fon of Neptune. Thefeus performed after this feveral confiderable adions : he killed the minotaur, he overcame the Centaurs, fubclued the Thebans, and defeated the Amazons. He aflifted his friend Pirithous, in his enterprize to the infernal w^orld, to carry off Proferpine ; bat in this expedition he failed, being imprifoned or fettered by Pluto, till releafed by Hercules.
No doubt, was the fiory of Thefeus divefted of the marvellous, it would make a confiderable figure (5;. Thefeus had feveral wives ; his tirffc was Helena, daughter of Tyndarus, w'hom he carried off; the fecond Hippolyta, queen of the Amazons, given him by Hercules ; the laft was Phsedra, filler to Ariadne, v/hofe lewdnefs fuificiently puniflied him for his infidelity to her lifter. This princefs felt an inceftuDus flame for her fon-in-lavv, Hippolitus (6),
a youth of uncommon virtue and chaftity. On his repulfing 'her folicitations, her love turned to hatred, and flie accufed him to his father, for an attempt to ravifh her. Thefeus, now grown old and uxorious, too eafily gave ear to the accufation. The prince, informed of his danger, fled in his chariot

with remorfc, laid violent bands on heifcif; arid foQTX after Theiem, being exiled from Athens, ^.-nded an illufirious life in obfcurity.
To explain the ilory of the minotaur : it is faid, that PaliphcC fell in love with a young nobleman of the court, named Taurus ; that Dsedalus lent his houle for the better candying on of their intrigue, during a long illnefs of Minos ; and that the queen in due time was delivered of two children, one of which refembled Mino?, the other Taurus, whence the minotaur : and the Athenians have aggravated the ftory, from their extreme prejudice to Minos. But what became of the Athenian youth, the tax
of whom w^as three times paid ? The Cretan king had inftituted funeral games in honour of Androgeos, v/Iierein thofe unhappy flaves were affigned as the prize of the conqueror. The firft who bore away all the prizes was Taures, of an infolent and tyrannical difpoiiticn, and particularly fcvere to the Athenians delivered up to him ; which contributed not a little to the fable. Thefe wretches grew old in fervitude, and were obliged to earn their living by the moft painful drudgery under Taurus, the fubjed of Minos ; and may therefore with fome propriety be faid to have been devoured bj^ him. But it is certain rliat they neither fought at thofe games, nor v/ere defcroyed by the cruelty of a monfter which never exifted (8).
Of the flime ftamp is the tale of the Centaurs. The 7'helTr'Jiaps pretty early diftinguifhed themfelves from the rcil of Greece, v,'ho fought only on fcnat or in chariots, by their application to hovfem.anfhi^. 'J'o acquire the more agility in this exercife, theV
were wont to fight with bulls, whom thtT^ pierced 'vvith darts or javelins ; whence they obtained the name of Centrnrs (9} and Hippocentaui-s (i). As ihefe horfemen became formidable by their depredations, the equivocation, which appeared in the name, made them to be r.ccoiiiited monflers, compounded of two natures.

No wonder then if we fee a god or cl'.lef of Ihe winds too, controiiiing all the reft. This province was naturally aifigned to that which was the nioft violent and uncontronlrible itfelf. For this imarjnary deity they borrowed a name from the Phoenicians, and called him vEolus (7), the fon of Jupiter, by Acafia
or Sigefia, the daughter of Hippotus. He reigned in the Lipai-iean ifles, near Sicily, from whence perhaps the fable took its onginal ( 8) ; but his refidence
was at Strongyle, now called Strombolo (9). Here he held thefe unruly powers enchained in a vaft cave, to prevent their committing the like devaftation they had been guilty of before they were put under hJs dii-ecT:ion (i). According to feme authons, the iEolian or Liparean illcb were uninhr.bited, till i ipavu=, the fon of Aufonis, fettled a colony here, and gave one of them his name. JEolus, the fen of Hippotus, who married his daughter, peopled the rcif , and fucceeded him in the throne. He ruled his fubje<fts v/ith equity and mildnefs, was a hofpitabJe good prince, and being ficilled in Aftronomy, by means of the reflux of the tides which is remarkable near thofe iflands, as well as by obferving fie nature of the volcanos with which they a bound, he was able to foretell the winds that fhould blow fi-om fnch a cjuarter (2}.

WheYi Xerxes, king of Perfia, crofled the Hellefpont with his numerous armada, to invade Greece, the Athenians invoked his afliilance, and he fcattered and deftroyed the greateft part of their fleet. This deity, notwithflanding his rage, was not inflexible to love. He de
bauched Chloiis, the daughter of Arcturus, by whom he had Hyrpace, and carried her to mount Niphates, (called the bed of Boreas) but lince known by the name of Caucalus : but his favourite miftrefs was Oi ithya, the daughter of Eridheu:;, king of Athens. By this princefs he had two fons, Zetes and Calais,
who attended Jafon in the Colchic expedition, delivered Phineus from the Harpies (4), and were afterwards killed by Hercules : as alfo four daughters, Upis, Laxo, Hecaerge, and Cleopatra. Perhaps the north wind, or Boreas alone, was deified, becaufe, of the regular winds, it is the moft tempeftuous and raging that blows.

Jupiter fhould have his fool. We have an inftance

i HE origin, or birth of Orion, borders a little on the marvellous. Hyricus, a citizen of Tanagra, in Boeotia, was fo hofpitable to ftrangers, that Ju
piter, Neptune, and Mercury, were refolved, under the charader of benighted travellers, to know the tvuth. Their entertainment was fo agreeable, that, difcovering their quality, they offered the old man whatever he fhould alk ; his requtft was a fon (7}.
The gods, to gratify his wifh, called for an ox hide, in which having depofited their urine, they bid him keep it under ground for ten months ; at the expiratii*n of which time, he found it produced a boy,
who was at firft called Urion, to exprefs his origin ;
but after, for decency's fake, his name was changed to Orion. He was a remarkable hunter, and kept a fleet pack
of hounds. Ntptune gave him the power of walkmg on the furface of the waters, with the fame fpeed that Iphiclus did (8) over the ears of corn. This faculty fcemed needlefs, if it be true that Orion was fo tail, that the deepeft fea could net cover his fhoulders,

From Chios he proceeded and foimd his way to
Lelbos, where Vulcan received him kindly, and gave
him a guide to the palace of the lim, who reltored
him to light. He then made war on Oenopion, wha concerned himfelf under ground to efcape his vengeance ; fo that fruftrated of his defii-n he went to Crete, where he purfued his favourite exercife of huntiiig. But having by fom.e means offended Diana (i), that goddefs put him to death (2); but afterwards relenting, prevailed on Jupiter to raifc him to the fkies, where he forms a conftellaticn (3)* remarlcible for prediding rain and tempeftuous weather.

tendect realms of water without protedion and guardianfliip. Neptune, though monarch of the deep?,, could not be prefcnt every where, and it was proper
to affign him deputies, who might relieve him of fome part of the weight of government. Nereus fon of Oceajius, fettled himfelf in the

He fometimes delighted in mifchief, for he carried otF the cattle from the Tanagrian fields, and dcftroyed the fmall coafting veflTels ; fo that to appeafe his refentment, thofe people oflered him libations of new wine. Of this he drank fo freely tl-.it he fell yfloep, and tumbling from an eminence, one of the natives cut off his head.
He left a daughter called Triftia, by whom Mars had a fon named Menalippus. This god is represented of a human form, from the waill upwards, with blue eyes, a large mouth, and hair matted like wild parlley. His fhoulders were covered with a purple fkin, variegated with fmall fcales, his feet refembling the fore feet of a horfe, and his lower parts turned like a dolphin with a forked tail. Sometimes he is drawn in a car with horfes of a fky colour. His trumpet is a large conch, or fea fhell. Ovid (6) has given two very beautiful
dcfcriptions of him. There were indeed many Tri
tons, who compofed the numerous equipage of Neptune, and ,were reckoned as deities propitious to navigation. Ino was the daughter of Cadmus and Harmonia, and married to Athamas king cf Thebes. This prince having the misfortune to lofe his fenfes, killed his fon Learchus in one of his mad fits, upon which his queen, to fave Melicertcs, her remaining boy, leaped with him from the rock Molyris into the fea. Neptune received them with open arms, and gave them a place amonefl the marine gods, only changing their names, Ino being called LeUcothea, and Melicertcs, Palemon (7) ; for this we are indebted to the fertile

Having one day taken a large draught in his nets, he obferved with furprize, that the fifties on tailing a certain herb jumped into the fea ag?in. Upon trying the experiment upon himfelf, he followed them, and became a fea god. Some afcribe to Glaucus the gift of prophecy. Ovid has not forgot his transformation amongft his metamorphofes (9).

OF PROTEUS AND PHORCYS, WITH THE CRJEM AND GORGONS, SCVLLA AND CHARYBDIS.
Proteus, the fon of Neptune, by the nymph Phzenice, was by his father appointed keeper of the Phocie, or fea-calves. His rcfidence was at Alexandria, in Egypt, from whence in a journey he made
to Phlegra (i), he married the nymph Torone, who bore him Tmolous and Telegonus, both killed by Hercules for their cruelty to ftrangers. Their father Proteus, who left them on account of their inhofpi
table temper, it is fa;d, was not much concerned at their death. By Torone he had alfo three daughters, Cabera, Ratia, and Idothea. Proteus ha-l the art of alfuming all forms (3); as alfo the gift of prophecy or divination ; (8) Some make him the fon of Mercury, others of Neptune, others of Anthadon ; on account of his IkUl in fwimming he was called Pontius.

Hiflorians make Proteus king of Carpathus (4) who on account of his great character for vvifdom and equity, was chofen king of Egypt, and deified after his death. According to Herodotus, Paris and Helena in their flight from Sparta, were received at his court, where Helen continued all the time of the Tioian fiege, after which he reftored her honourably to Menelaus. Proteus is ufually reprefented in a chariot drawn by horfes, in the form of Tritons. His half brother Phorcys, or Phorcus, was the fon of Neptune, by the nymph Thefea (5). He married
his fifter Ceto, by whom he had the Phorcydes and
Gorgons, Thoofa(6)and Scylla. He was vanquifhed
by Atlas, who threw him into the fea, where his father raifed him to the ra^k of a fea god.
The Gorgons were in all four fiftcrs, of whom Medufa was the chief. They had hair like fnakes, tulks like wild boars, brazen hands and golden
wings. On the death of their fifter, they purfued
Perfeus, who faved himfelf by putting on the helmet lent him by Pluto, and which rendered him invifible. The Groese were their fifters, and are reprefented
as three old women, who lived in Scythia, and had
but one eye and tooth in common amongft them, which they ufed as they had occafion, and afterwards laid up in a coffer. For the prefervation of this valuable legend we are indebted to Palasphatus.

Minos had befiegcd this monarch in his capital, but the oracle had pronounced Nyfus invincible, while he prefen'cd a purple lock of hair which grew on his head. Scylla, who was fecretly in love with Minos, betrayed both her father and country into his hands, by cutting off the lock ; but the conqueror detefting her treachery, banifhed her^Hs fight. Unable to bear the treatment Ihe fo juftly merited, flie caft herftlf into the fea, and was changed into a lark (2).

As foon as born, his father carried him in a goat fkin to heaven, where he charmed all the gods with his pipe ; fo that they aflbciated him with Mercury in the poil of their meflTenger. After this he was educated on mount Msenalus, in Arcadia, by Sinoe and the other nymphs, who, attraded by his mufic, followed him as their conducftor. Pan, though devoted to the pleafures of a rural life, diftinguiflied himfelf by his valour, in the
giants war he entangled Typhon in his nets as we have already obferved : he attended Bacchus in his Indian expedition with a body of Satyrs, who did
good fervice. When the Gauls invaded Greece, and \\'ere about to pillage the temple of Dtlphos, he ftruck them v/ith fuch a fudden conllernation by night, that they fled without any one to purfue
them (6). He alfo aided the Athenians in a fea fight, gained by Miltiades over the Perfian fleet, for which they dedicated a grotto to his honour under the citadel. This deity was of a very amorous conftitution. In a conteft with Cupid, being overcome, that little god puniihed him with a paffion for the nymph Sy
rinx, who treated him with difdain. But being clofely purfued by him, and flopped in her flight by the river Ladan, ilie invoked the Naiades, who changed her into a tuft of reeds, which the diiappointed lover grafped in his arms. Contemplating a transformation fo unfavourable to his defires, he obferved the reeds tremble with the Avind, and emit a murmuring found. Improving this hint, he cut
forae of them, and formed the pipe for which he be
came fo famous. Kis other amours were the more

Pan was properly the god of fhepherds and hunters, and, as he was a mountain deity, the flocks and herds were under his immediate protection and care. He was likewife honoured by the fifhermen, efpe
cially thofe who inhabited the promontories walhed by the fea. He was chiefly efteemed in Arcadia, his native country, where the fhepherds offered him milk and honey in wooden bowls. If fuccefsful in hunting, they allotted him part of the fpoil ; but, if otherwife, they whipped his image heartily. At Molpeus, a town near the city Licofura, he had a temple by the title of Nomius, bccaufe he perfedled the harmony of his pipe on the Nomian mountains. The Romans adopted him amongil their deities by the names of Lupercus and Lycaeus. His feftivals, called Lupercalia, and celebrated in February, were inflituted by Evander, who being exiled Arcadia, fled for refuge to Faunus, king of the Latins, and was by him allowed to fettle near mount Palatine (i), Romulus made fome addition to thefe ceremonies, in which the Luperci, or priefts of Pan, ran naked through the city, ftriking thofe they met with things made of goat fhins, particularly the women, who fancied that it helped their eafy conception, or Ipeedy delivery.

Pan is reprefented with a fmiling ruddy face, and
thick beard covering his breaft, two horns on his head, a ftar on his breaft, with the nofe, feet, and tail of a goat. He is cloathed in a fpottcd fKin, having a fhepherd's crook in one hand, and his pipe of unequal reeds in the other, and is crowned with pine, that tree being confecrated to his ff rvice. Pan, however, faid to be the offspring of Penelope, was indeed one of the moft ancient, being of the firft eight of the Egyptian gods, and was looked upon as the fymbol of nature. His horns, fay the mythologifts, reprefent the rays of the fun ; and the vivacity and ruddinefs of his complexion, the brightnefs «f the heavens ; the ftar on his breaft, the firmament
;
and his feet and legs overgrown with hair, denote the inferior part of the world, the earth, the trees and plants (2). Faunus was the fon of Picus, king of the Latins, who was cotemporary with Orpheus. He reigned in , Italy at the time that Pandion ruled Athens, and introduced both religion and hufbandry into Latium. He deified his father, and his wife Fauna or Fatua (3).
He had the gift of prophecy. His fon Stercutius was
alfo honoured on account of his fhewing how to improve land, by dunging or manuring it. The Faunalia were kept in December with feafting and much mirth, and the vi<5tims offered were goats. The Fauni, or children of Faunus, were vifionary
beings much like the Satyrs, and were ufually crowned with pine. Both Faunus and Ihey were deities only regarded in Italy, and wholly unknown to the Greeks. The Fauni were the hufbandmen, the Satyrs the vine-dreffers, and the Sylvan' 'hofe who cut wood in the forefts ; who, as was ufual in thofe early times, being dreffed in the fkins of beafts, gave rife to thofe fabulous deities. The terreftrial nymphs were divided into feveral clafTes. The heathen theology took care that no part of nature fhould remain uninformed or unproteded. The

claimed men fi om eating or devouring each other, and taught the ufe of vegetable food. Melifla, one of thefe, was the inventrefs of honey (5). The Napeae were the tutelar guardians of vallies and flowery^
meads. The Dryades inhabited the forefts and woods, refiding in their particular trees, with which they were thought to be coeval, as feveral inllances prove (6). The oak was generally their choice, either from
its ftrength or duration. Some were called Hama,dryades, whofe cxiftence was infeparably united to that of the tree they animated. The Naiades were the nymphs of brooks and rivers ; the Limniades frequented the lakes, and the Ephydriades delighted in fprings and fountains. Thus all the face of nature became enlivened by the force of imagination, and the poets did not fail to improve fo ample a field for
defcription. The mythologifts deftroy all this fine landfcape, by making the nymphs only tignify the univerfal moifture which is diffufed through all nature. There were alfo celeftial nymphs of a higher rank, who attended the Dii Majores. Jupiter boafts of his
in Ovid (7). The Mufes were the nymphs or attendants of Apollo, as the BaiTorides, or Msenades^ be
longed to Bacchus. Juno had fourteen who waited on her (8) perfon ; and Neptune had no lefs than fifty Nereides at his beck, on which account he was called Nymphagater, or the captain of the nymphs (9).
The ufual facrifices to thefe deities were goats
;
but more commionly milk, oil, honey, and wine. The nymphs were always reprefented as young and beautiful virgins, and dreiTed in fuch a m.anner as was fuitable to the cliarader afcribed to them. To the train of Pan we may join two rural god

This edifice being let on fire, and extinguifhed, the neighbours refolved to remove her ftatue, when the grove became green again of a fudden(z). Strabo tells us, that her priefts or votaries could walk barefoot over burning coals unhurt. Slaves received the cap of liberty in her temple, on which account they regarded her as their patronefs. Pales was the proteding deity of fhepherds and pafturage. Her fcftival was obferved by the country people in May, in the open fields, and the offerings were milk, and cakes of millet, in order to engage her to defend their flocks fi*om wild beafts and infectious difeafes. Thefe feafls were called Palilia. Some
make Pales the fame with Vefta or Cybele. This goddefs is reprefented as an old woman. Both thefe deities were peculiar to the Romans,
and wholly unknown in Greece.

born at Lampfacus (4), but fo deformed, that his

the oracle of Dodona, he was recalled (6). And
temples were ereded to him as the tutelar deity of vineyards and gardens, to defend them from thieves and birds deftrudtive to the fruit. Priapus had feveral names. He was called Aviftupor, for the reafon juft mentioned. The title of
Heilefpcntiacus was given him, becaufe Lampfacus . was feated on that ftreight or arm of the fea. It is
uncertain how he came by the epithet of Bonus Deu«, afcribed to him by Phurnutius. Thofe of Phallus and Fafcinum were afligned him on a very obfcene account, and indeed his whole figure conveyed fuch an idea of uglinefs and lewdnefs, that the poets generally treat him with great contempt (7). The facrifice offered him was the afs, either becaufe of the natural uncomelinefs of that anima], and its ftrong propenfity to venery, or becaufe, asfomefay, Priapus attempting the chaftity of Vefta when afieep, Ihe was awakened by the braying of old Silenus's afs, and fo efcaped the injury defigned htr. This deity is ufually reprefented naked and obfcene, with a ftern countenance, matted hair, and carrying a wooden fword (8) or fickle in his hand. His body ended in a (hapelefs trunk or block of timber.
Some of the mythologifts make his birth allude to that radical moifture, which fupports all vegetable productions, and which is produced by Bacchus and Venus, that is, the folar heat, and the water, or liquid
matter, whence Venus is faid to fpring. The worIhip of this infamous deity was taken from the Syrians of Lampfacus. ''
With Priapus we may afibciate Terminus, a very
ancient deity amongft the Romans, whofc worftiip
was firft inftituteJ by Numa Pompilius, who ereded
him a temple on the Tarpeian Hill (9). This deity
was thought to prefide over the ftoncs or landmarks,

OF FLORA.
1 HE poets make this goddefs the fame with Chlo

Roman courtezan, who having amafled a confiderable
fortune by her profelfion, made the Roman people her heirs, on condition that certain games, calleci Floralia, might be annually celebrated on her birthday. The fenate, to give a glofs to fo infamous a proftitution of religion, pretended this feftival was deiigncd in honour of Flora, a certain Sabine goddefs who prefided over flowers. Thefe fports were held
in the Campus Martins, and proclaimed by found of
trumpet. No women appeared at them, but the moft immodeft of the fex (4). Yet when Cato, during his cenfoilhip, came to behold them, they fufpended Xhe ceremonies through ftiame, till he thought fit to withdraw ; fuch an influence had the virtue of one man over a corrupt and difl'olute multitude. Flora's image, in the temple of Caftor and Pollux, was drefled in a clofe habit, holding in her hands the flowers of peas and beans ; for, at the celebration of her rites, the aediles fcattered thefe and other pulfc amongft the people (5).

CHAP. LIX.
OF POMONA AND VERTUMNUS.
.1 HE goddefs Pomona was a Latian nymph, whom that nation honoured as a tutelar deity of orchards and fruit-trees. Vcrtumnus (the Proteus of the Ro
man ritual) (6) was the god of tradefmen, and, from the power he had of affuming any fhape, was believed to prefide over the thoughts of nianldnd. His feftivals, called Vertumnalia, were celebrated in Odlober. Vertumnus*s courtfliip makes one of the mofl elegant and entertaining ftories in Ovid (7). Under
the difguife of an old womaa he vifited the gardens of Pomona, v/hom he found employed in looking after her plantations. He artfully praifes the beauty of her fruit, and commends the care which produced it. Thence, from the view of the vine, fupported by the elm, he infinuates to her the neceHity and pleafure of a married life. The goddefs heard all ihis eloquence with an indifferent ear. Her heart remained untouched, till, throwing off his difguife, the god affumed his youthful beauty, and by his form foon gained the goddefs's confent. ^ome imagine Vertumnus an emblem of the year, wTiich though it aflumes different dreffes, according to the different feafons, is at no time fo agreeable as in autumn, when the harveft is crowned, and the richeft fruits appear in their full perfedlion and luftre. The hiftorians fay, that this god was an ancient Tufcan prince, Avho firft taught his fubjeds to plant orchards, and to graft and prune fruit-trees j whence he is faid to have married Pomona. Both thefe deities were unknown to the Greeks, and only honoured by the Romans. CHAP.

OF THE LARES AND PENATES, AND GENU.
The Lares were the offspring of Mercury. The
nymph Lara having offended Jupiter, by difclofing feme of his intrigues to JunOj that deity ordered her tongue to be cut out, and banifhed her to the infernaf
manfions. Mercury, who wavS appointed to conduct her into exile, ravilhed her by the way, and fhe brought forth the Lares (8). Thefe dt- ities not only preftded over the highways,. and the confervalion of the public fafety, but alfo
over private houfes, in mofl of which the Romans had a particular place called Lararium, where were depofited the images of their domeftic gods, the Itatucs of their anceliors, unci the Lares. Their fcftival, cailt d Compilalia, was celebrated in January, in the open flreets and roads. At firft boys were facriftced to them, but that favage cuftom was foon difufed, and images of v/col and ftraw (<)">, with the firft fruits of the earth, v/inc, incenfe, and gar
lands of flowers, v/ere the oiferings. When the
Roman youth laid afide the bulla, an ornament they conftantly wore (i) till fourteen years of age, they confecratcd or hung it up to the Lares, who were regarded as infernal as well as domeftic deities. The ancients fuppofed, according to fome authors,
that the fouls of men after death became a kind of dem.ons, called Lemures(z). Thefe they fubdivided into two claffes, the one benevolent and friendly to mankind, which they termed Lares ; the other, who being wicked during life, letained a malicious difpbfition in their difembodied ftate, they ftiled Larva?. The Lares were reprefented as young boys with dogs Ikins about their bodies (3), and with their heads
(8) Ovid Fall. lib. 11/ (9) They hung up as many images as there were perfons of all fexes and ages in the fiimily, and a v/ooilen ball for every fervant.

They had always the image of a dog near them, to denote their fidelity in preferving the places allotted to their charge, on which account this animal was peculiarly confccrated to them. Some confound thefe with the Penates and Genii.
CHAP. LXI.
OF THE PENATES.
1 HE Penates (4) were the deities who prefided
over new born infants. The ancient Hetru/^i called them Confentes, or Complices, though others make of them four of the Dii Majores (5). But there were
three clafles or ranks of .them : thofe who preiided
over empires and ftates (6) ; who had the protedion
of cities ; who took the care or giiardianfhip of private families, and were called the lelTer Penates ( 7 ). Thefe domeftic gods were placed in the utmoft recefs of the houfe, thence called Penetrale (8). Dardanus brought them from Samothracia to Troy, whence, on the deftrucTiion of that city, iEneas tranfported them to Italy. They were reckoned fo
facred, that the expreffion. of driving a man from his Penates (9), was ufed to fignify his being profcribed, or expelled his country. Dionyfius, of HalicarnafTus, lib. i, fays, that he had feen them at Rome, under the figure of two young men fitting, with fpears in their hands.

CHAP. LXII.
OF THE GENII.
Some do not dlflinguidi between thefe and the
Penates, or Lares ; but they were very different. The ancients affigned to every thing its guardian or
peculiar genius ; cities, groves, fountains, hills, were all provided with keepers of t1iis kind, and to each man they allotted no iefs than two, one good, the
other bad (i), who iittended him from the cradle to
the grave. The Greeks called them Dsemons. They were named Prseftltes, from their fuperintending human affairs. The lacrifices offered thefe divinities were wine (a) and Howers, to which they joined incenfe, parched Wiieat, and fait. Sometinits the vidim was a fwine (3), though animal offerings were not uuial to them.
The Genii were reprefc;;ted under various figures, fuch as 'thofe of boys, girls, olil men, and even ferpents. Thefe images were crowned with plane-tree leaves, a tree confecrated to the Genii. By Genius, is meant the a'.5tive power or force of nature, from whence the nuptial bed is ftiled genial, and the fame epithet given to all occafions wherein focial joys and pleafures are felt. Hence alfo the expreflions of indulging our Genius, that is, living happily, or according to our inclinations ; confulting our Genius, for examining how far our capacity extends ; and the term of a great Genius, for an exalted or comprehenlive mind. The later Romans, in the degenerate days of the ftate, introduced the fervile flattery of fwearing by the Genii of their Emperors, and the tyrant Caligula put feveral to death for refufing to take the oath.

176 FABULOUS HISTORY OF
of Greece and Rome. Ifis is faid to have been the fifter of Ofiris (4), the daughter of Saturn, and a native of Egypt. She married her brother, and fhared his throne. They governed with great equity and wifdom, civilizing their fiibje<5ls, and inilru(^ing them in hufbandry and other iifeful arts. Thefe inllrudions were delivered in verfe, and were called the poems of Ifis (5). Ofiris, having conferred the greateft benefits on his
own fubjeds, made the necefiary difpolition of his affairs, committing the regency to Ins, and fet out with a body of forces in order to civilize the reft of mankind. This he performed more by the power of perfuafion, and the foothing arts of mufic and poetry, than by the terror of his arms. He marched firft into Ethiopia ; thence to Arabia and India. Having traverfed Afia, he croHcd the Hellefpont, and fpent ibme time in Europe. Returning to Egypt, he was
flain by his brother Typhon ; of whom we have fpoken fufficiently in the chapter of the giants.
When the news of this reached Copt us, where Ifis then was, fne cut her hair, and in deep mourning went every where in fearch of the dead body ; which fhe found at length, and concealed at Butus. But Typhon hunting by moonlight, found it there, and tore it into many pieces, which he fcattered abroad. Ifis then traverfed the lakes and watry places in a boat made of the papyrus, feeking the mangled limbs of Ofiris : where fhe found one, there fhe buried it. Hence the many tom.bs afcribed to Ofiris. Thus Plutarch. But Diodorus fays, that
fhe joined the fragments, embalmed and buried them at Memphis; prevailing on the Egyptian priefts to promote his deification, in confideration of a third part of the kingdom given to them. Ifis afterwards, with the alfiftance of her fon Orus, vanquiflied Typhon, reigned happily over
Egypt to her death, and was alfo buried at Memphis. At Bufiris, a moft fuperb temple was raifed
to her. She was fucceeded by her fon Orus, who completed the reign of the gads and demi-gods in Egypt.
To do the greater honour to thefe their favourites, the Egyptians made them to reprefent the obje<^s (4) Diodor. Sic. 1, I. is) Plato dc Leg, dialog.

©bjeds of their idolatrous worfhip. The attributes of Ifis, indeed, when expofed as the public fign of their feafts, differed according to the different purpoles to which they applied the figure. But at other times this goddefs was reprefented with a flowing veil, having the earth under her feet, her head crowned with towers (like the Phrygian mother) the emblem of height and ftability ; and fomelimes with upright horns, equally exprefTive of dvominion and power ; next to thefe the crefcent, then the fun, and above all expanded wings. She has alfo wings and a quiver on her fhoulders ; her left-hand holds a cornucopia, her right a throne charged with the cap and fcepter of Ofiris, and fometimes a flaming torch ; and her right arm is entwined by a ferpent. The imagination of the reader will prefently conceive this to be the fymbol of the aether, the natural parent and fpirit of the univerfe, comprehend-ing and pervading the whole creation. As fuch, fhe is eafily confounded wuth nature, which is defined by Balbus in Cicero (4) to be Thai ra.jhich contains and Jujlains the 'whole ^juorld. In Herodotus, (he is the fame with Ceres ; in Diodorus, with Luna, Ceres and Juno ; in Plutarch, with Minerva, Proferpine, Luna, Thetys. By Apuleius, flie is called the Mother of the Gods, and is the fame with Minerva, Venus, Diana, Proferpine, Ceres, Juno, Bellona, Hecate, Rhamnufia ; hence termed fometimes 'Av^mvoy,oq^ or The Goddefs of a thoifajul names. Being a female figure, and thus principally honoured, flie was denominated Ifis (7 . So likewife in Herodotus, Ofiris and Bacchus are the fame ; in Diodorus, Sol, Ofiris, Serapis, Diony
fius, Pluto, Ammon, Jupiter, Pan ; in Plutarch, Sol, Ofiris, Pluto, Bacchus, Serapis, Apis, Oceanus, Sirius. Kence we fee him in gemx with a radiated crown and a bafket on his head, having the
horns of Ammon ; and in his hand a trident entwined by a ferpent. He is the great emblem of the folar body. Orus is the fymbol of light, as the name imports (8},
and is generally figured as a winged boy, flanding 1 5 between

architraves are fupported by two columnr>, with alternate fquare divifions of black and white, crowned with the head of Ifis. At fome diftance, on the outfides, are two pilafters, decorated with flowero, from which rife two afpics, fymbols of warmth and moif ture conjoined, the fecondary caufe of life. In the midft of this magnificent throne, is the goddefs feated, to denote ftabiiity and power. From the navel to the foot her habit is compofed of wings, reprefenting the velocity and fublimity of the jether, diflrufing" itfelf univerfally. Thence upwards to the breaft, fhc is fuli of paps, fhewing the body of the world, or the univtrfa] machir.e, to be thence nourifhed and fuppoiled. The collars round her neck are the celef
tial orbs. The great variety of created beirgs, is aptly fignified by the party-coloured feathers of the African hen, which cover her head in a flying attitude. The balket on the back of this bird is the emblem of plenty, from which, on each fide, fprings a leaf of the Egyptian peach ; and two horns, which point out the crefcent moon, inclofing a circle marked with the figure of the fcarabaeus or beetle, reprefenting the fun. The gefture of her left hand is com.manding and monitory : her right holds a fceptre of the flowering lotus. Her feat is adorned with the figure of a dog fitting; to intimate her dominion, according to Bio lorus, refulgent in the dog ftar.
.
Within the table, beneath the throne, is the body of a lion with the head of an hawk, at his fore-feet a . canopus, fupporting upright wings ; emblems of caith, fire, water, and air. Over the back of the lion-hawk is the ferpent tianfmitted through a circle with expanded wings, explained in the chapter of Mercury, page 87, of whofe caduceus thefe are the attributes, and on his head a crefcent, with the fun
over that. By the fmall hieroglypic characters near the Ifis, fhe is faid to be The fpirit of the <^vorld, penetrating all things ^ujitb the eye of Divine Pro'vidence
;
and the bond of the fuperior and inferior nvorlds.

He has the head of an hawk, a bird, fi-om his ftrength of vifioe, by which he is faid to look fteady on the meridian liin, frequently depided for the fymbol of the folar orb. He is crowned with a mitre, full of fmall orbs, to intimate his fuperiority over all the globes. The gourd upon the mitre implies his aiftion and influence upon moifture, which, and the Nile particularly, was termed by the Egyptians the efflux of Ofiris. The
lower part of his habit is made up of defcending rays, and his body is furrounded with orbr>. His right hand is extended in a commanding attitude, and his left holds a thyrfus or ftafl" of the papyrus pointing out the principle of humidity, and the fertility thence flowing, under his dired;ion.
EXPLANATION OF THE FIGURE OF ORU3.
•* HE figure of Orus, which is the emblem of the folar efflux, is juvenile, as perpetually renewed and renewing youth and vigour. He ftandsto denote the unabated acftivity of light, and is habited in a fort of network, compofed of globules of light pulhing and interfering each other every way. He holds a ftafF crofled, expreffing his power in the four elements ; and on it the head of the hoop, a tranfient bird, to reprefent the continual change of things which he produces by thofe elements. This ftaff, the fymbol of his rule, is further adorned with a gnomon and trumpet, indicating feafon and fymmetry, harmony and order. At his back is a triangle with a globe fixed to it ; fhewing the regular being of the world
to depend upon him. The lides of the portal, which he ftands in, are decorated with the celeflial bodies, and on the top of it is the circle with expanded wings. The hieroglyphics, engraven on the bafe, call him, The Parent of 'vegetable Nature ; the Guardian of Moifiure ; ProteEior of the Nile ; Avertcr of E-vi/s

BoCHART fays, that the Cibiri were the Gods oF
the Phcenicians, and obferves jiiftly that Cabir fignines, both in the Hebrew and Arabic tongue, Great
or Mighty ; fo that Cabiri, in the plural, are The
Great or Mighty Ones. He that miniftered in holy things went by the appellation of Cohes, a nnanifeft corruption of the Hebrew Cohen, prieft or interceffor. They are fpoken of by the names of Axieros, Axiocherfos and Axiocherfa ; as three diilind pei-fons": and in them our author thinks that he has found Ceres, Proferpine and Pluto ; the Abbe Pluche, Ofiris, Orus, and Ifis ; others, Jupiter, Ceres, and Bac
chus. To thefe, the Scholiaft upon Apollonius, has added a fourth, Cafmiius or Cadmilus ; the fame,
fays he, is Hermes, or Mercury, whom Varro declares to be only a minifter attendant on the Cabiri. Several authors have confined the appellation of Cabiri to Jupiter, Minerva, and Juno. Nor is it at all improbable that thcfe Ihould have been fo called in after ages, when the world in general had forfaken the worfhip of the Creator for that of the creature, and underftood by thefe teims thcfe things which muft indeed be allowed the moit proper and figniticant emblems of the divine p.^ -fonalities (a) ; the ^olar fire being meant by Jupiter (,); by Minerva, -darting from the head of him, the light thence fpringing ; and by Juno, the se'bcr (^including the air), the natural rcpreft^ntalive of the Sacred Spirit, Thefe a- e indeed the fame wilh the E^-yptian Ofiris, Orus, and Ifis. But in earli-r times it was judged rm ad of irreverence to pronounce their names ; which was the cafe of the tetnigrarr.maton Vvith the Jews.

As to what is faid of a man's being facrificed in thefe myfteries upon fome extraordinary occafion, I cannot find the aflertion to be well grounded. Julius Firmicus intimates, that the Cabiri were three bro
thers, one of whom was flain by the other two, and then deified ; and fpeaks of his M^orlhippers, as holding up their bloody hands to the once-bleeding

which may refer either to their hands being imbrued in the blood of the ordinary vidlims, or to the warlike difpofition of that conquering people (Macedonians). But, if the thing be fad, it muft have pro-' ceeded from an afiurance that fuch a facrifice was one day or other to promote the happinefs of mankind (4).

OF THE INFERIOR RURAL DEITIES.
1 H E Romans were not content with the great
variety of gods, which filled their ritual. They were daily inventing new deities of an inferior order, to anfwer the demands of fuperflition, and increafe the kakndar. Rufina thus became the name of a god
defs, who prefided over the country in general. Collina had the charge of the hills, and Yallona the infpedion of the vallies ; Hippona was the guardian rf ftabies and horfes ; and Bubona took care of oxen; Sell, or Segetia, watched the feed till it fprouted ; and Runcina weeded the young corn ; Sarritor was the god of fowing, and Occator of harrowing ; Robigus kept the blights or Mildew away (8) ; Slcrcutius manured or dunged the ground } Nodotus, or Nodofus, took care to ftrengthen or knit the ftalks of the corn ; Volufia watched the blade ; Patelina unfolded the ear ; La(5tucina filled it ; and Matura brought it to due ripenefs ; Heftilina produced a plentiful crop ; and Tutelina took care to reap and get it fafe in ; Pilumnus kneaded the bread ; and Fornax baked it (9) ; Mellon a was the goddefs of honey ; but the truth is, thefe fanciful deities are fo little m.entioned in authors, that we may call them the refufe or fcum of the gods.

her temple at the Efquilia was confecrated by al^

bdta and Pan were given her by Servius Tulliws, who dedicated a /brine to her (5) ; fhe was alfo termed Cceca, not unjullly, on account of the injudicious diflribution of her favours. She was honoured at
Rome by the title of Fortuna Equeftris (6). In a temple fhe had near that of Venus, fhe bore the appellations of Mafcula and Vii-ilis. At other times fhe was named MammofaC;), Primogenia (8), and Privata, or Propria (9). In the quality of Fortuna Virgo, coats of yx>ung children were offered to her before they put them on ; and fhe was fliled Vifcata, or Vifcofa (i), on account of her alluring or attracting people by h«ri deceitful kindnefs. The principal temple of this goddefs was at Prsenefce, whence fhe was called Prasneftina. She is ufually reprcfented blind, ftanding on a wheel in a moving attitude, and holding a cornucopia, from whence flie powers wealth, and all the emblems of profperity. Horace has given a very maflerly pidure of her in an ode to Maecenas (2), She is fometim-es figured in a flying attitude, with broad wings, founding a trumpet, and her flying robe wrought all over with eyes, ears and tongues, to denote the furprize, attention and difcourfe fhe excites

is no wonder if ihe was deified. The Athenians (according to Plutarch) ere«5ted her an altar with her ftatue, attended by that of Plutus, the god of riches, to ihow that Ihe was the fource of plenty. At Rome Ihe had a magnificent temple in the Forum (5), which was confumed by fire in the reign of
Commodus.
On medals, this goddefs is reprefented before an altar, fetting fire with a torch in her left hand to a pile of arms, and with the other holding an olive branch . Behind her, on a column, appears the im.age of a naked body or man extending his arms in
a rejoicing pofture (6). The poets generally introduce her in company with the moft Ihining virtues
(7). And Virgil repreients her as the common wifh of mankind (8). Claudian has compofed her panegyric in a very diftinguifhed manner. Sometimes fhe appears like a matron holding a bunch or ears of corn, and crowned with olive or rofes. The goddefs Concordia, or Concord, was another divinity of the Romans. At the requeft of his mother Livia, widow of Auguftus, a temple was dedicated to her by Tiberius at Rome. She had feveral other magnificent temples ; in one of thefe were depofited the rich fpoils of the temple of Jerufalem. Virtue and Honour had their temples at Rome. That to Virtue was eretfted by M. Marcellus (9), and was the only paflage to the temple of Honour, to fliew that worthy adions were the true foundation of lafting fame.

No animals were offered, or blood fpilt in the facrifices ; during the performance of her rites, her priefts were cloathed in white veftments, and their heads and hands covered with linen cloth ; to fliew that fidelity ought to be fecret. Her fymbol was a white dog, and a figure
where two women are joining hands reprefents the goddefs. Hope is another of the palTions deified by the Romans. She had a temple in the herb-market, which
was confumed by lightning. On medals Ihe appears in a Handing attitude, with her left hand holding up lightly her loofe robes, and leaning on her elbow ; in her right flie has a plate, in which is placed a ciborium, or cup, fafiiioned like a flower, with this infcription, Spes, P. R. the hope of the Roman people (i). In the modern ftatues and paintings, her charaderiftic is a golden anchor. Piety, or filial Aftedtion, had a chapel at Rome, confecrated by the Duumvir Attilius and Glabrio on
a remarkable occafion : " A man being fentenced to

Virginia, the daughter of Aulus, having married a Plebeian, fo offended thefe, that they excluded her their alitmblies : upon which Virginia called a meeting of the plebeian matrons, dedicated a chapel to this goddefs by the name of Pudicitia Plebeia(0.

In medals this deity is reprcfented under the figure of a woman veiled, pointing with the forefinger of her right-hand to her face, to fignify that fhe had no reafon to blufh. Mercy, or Clemency, had an altar at Athens,
erected by the kindred of Hercules. At Rome was a temple dedicated to the Clemency of Ccefar (4). Both the Romans and Greeks gaive the name of Afyium to the temples each had erected to this goddefs. Truth, according to Plutarch, was the daughter of Saturn and Time, and the mother of Virtue, and w'as reprefented as a beautiful young virgin of a proper ftature, modeftly clad in a robe, whcfc whitencfs refembled that of fnow. Democritus, to give an idea of the difficulty of her being found, fays that ihe is concealed in the bottom of a well. Liberty was fo much the delight of the Romans, that it was but natural for them to imagine her a goddefs, and to confecrate to her temples and altars. She was reprefented in the form of a virgin cloathed in white, holding a fceptre in her right hand, and a cap in her left. Good Senfe, or Underftanding [mens]* vv-as honoured with an altar in the Capitol, by M. iEmilius; and Attilias the praetor erected her chapel. Fauftitas, or the public Felicity and Welfare, had

Romans : the former honoured this goddefs under the names of Endaimonia and Macaria. The Athenians confulting an oracle on the fuccefs of a battle, were informed, that they fhould V\in the vliftory if one of ttie children of Hercules vni^ouM fubmit to a voluntary death : on this Macaria, one of his daughters, killed herfelf, and the Athenians becoming victorious, paid her adoration under the name of Felicity.

The goddefs Salus, or Health, had a temple at
Rome near the gate, from thence called Porto Salu

She was reprefented by a woman fitting on a throne, and holding a globe in her hand. Near her flood an altar, with a fnake entwined round it. In this temple was performed the Augurium Salutis, a ceremony which Auguflus revived from defuetude. It was a day fet apart annually, for enquiring of the gods by
divination, whether they would allow the people to
pray for peace ? On this day the Roman armies were forbid to march or engage. It is worthy of remark, that the pricfts of this temple had arrogated to themfelves the fole privilege of offering fupplications for the health of every individual, as well as for the flate.
The Good Genius was adored by the Greeks, and,
according to Paufanius, had a temple in the road
leading to mount Maenalus. At the clofe of fupper a cup was always offered him of wine and water, and
called the grace-cup. Wealth has fuch an influence on the affairs of life, that it has in all ages been the objed of public wor
fhip, or of fecret idolatry. Thus the Romans deified
both Plutus and Pecunia, or Money. JMenander
wittily cbferves on this fubjed, " That if you can
" poffefs this deity, you may afk and have what you ** pleafe ; even the gods themfelves fliall be at your

once been mortal. The Greeks and Romans appropriated to themfelves this fymbol of Silence, but in general were ignorant of its original intention. Nor were thefe the only vifionary deities ere(5ted by the heathens. Fear, Hope, Difeafes, Calamities, and even Vices, were honoured with a view of averting their vifitation, or allaying their noxious influences. Thus Febris, or the Fever, had her altars at Rome.
Hoftilius Tullus vowed a temple to the goddefles Terror and Palenefd. M. Marcellinus, after efcaping
a ftorm near Sicily, built a chapel to the god Tem
peftas, without the gate of Capena. And Poverty and Art were both deified by the people of Gadara, becaufe Neceffity is the mother of invention. Envy was a goddefs, whofe perfon and abode are inimitably defcribed by Ovid (5). Calumny had an altar ereifted to her by the Athe
nians. We have a very remarkable pi(5ture of this
mifchievous goddefs, as drawn by the hand of the great Apelles. Credulity, reprefented by a man with large open ears, invites this deity to him, extending his hand to receive her. Ignorance and Sufpicion ftand jtift behind him. Calumny, the principal figure of the piece,. appears advancing, her countenance ruffled with pafiion, holding in her left hand a lighted torch, and with her right dragging along a youth, who lifts up his hands as fupplicating the gods.

DISSERTATION
ON T H 2
THEOLOGY of the HEATHENS.
The religion of mankind was at firft one, like the
objed of it. But when the latter was changed, the mode and ceremonial of worfhip continued ftill the
fame; for idolatry, that worst of things, was but in its origin, the corruption of true religon, which is
the BEST ! We are not therefore to wonder, if we fee the fame ufage of temples, altars, priefts, facrifices, firft fruits, &c. common to the patriarchs and
unbelievers. We even behold, in thefe, and many other inftances, the fam.e religious cuftams amongil the heathens, which it pleafed the Divine Being to enforce the continuance of by the Mofaic difpenfation ; a convincing argument that they muft have been uncorrupt and innocent in their original. Nor did mankind in general lofe fight of the original objed fo foon, or fo totally, as is commonly ap
prehended. Since we find amongft the eaftern nations, and indeed amongft feveral of the Greeks and Romans, the moft exalted notions of the Supreme Being, the Creator of heaven and earth. According to the Egyptians (i), Eidon, or the firft God, exifted in his folatcr/ unity before all behigs.
He is the fountain and original of every thing, that
cither has underftanding, or is to be underftocd. He is the firft principle of all things, felf-fufiicient, incomprehenfible/ and the father of all eflences. Her
mes fays, likewife, that this Supreme God has con
ftituted another God, called Emeph, to be head over all fpirits, whether etherial, empyrean, or celeftial
;
and that this fecond God-, whom he ftiles the Guide^ is a wifdom that transforms and converts into itfelf
all fpiritual beings. He makes nothing fuperior to this god-guide, except the firft intelligent, and firft intelligible, who ought to be adortd in filence. He adds,

adds, that the fpirit which produceth all things has different names, according to his different properties and operations ; that he is called in the Egyptian language Amoun, as he is wife ; Ptha, as he is the life of all things ; and Ofiris, as he is the author of all good (a).
Let us proceed to the Greeks, amongft whom Orpheus claims the firft place in right of his antiquity, and to whofe theological fentiments the preference is always given by the early writers in favour of Chriftianity. ** There is one unknown Being, exalted above, and ** prior to all beings (3), the author of all things, even *' of the aether, and of every thing that is below the *' aether: this exalted being is life, light, and
" wisdom; which three names exprefs only one and *' the fame power, which drew all beings, vifible and
" invilible, out of nothing." Thus alfothe divine Plato : ** That which (4) gives
*' truth and reality to things unknown, and endues *' the knower with the power of underftanding ; this
** call thou the idea of the Good One, the fource of
*' v.dfdom and truth." But God is everywhere dlftinguiflied throughout the works of this illuftrious philofopher, as the beautiful, the go^d, the just ONE. Would you fee the being and the providence of God depionftrated from the order and adminiftration of the world ? You will no where find it more convincingly than in the reafoning of Balbus in Cicero ; and from which obfervations you muft of neceffity draw
the fame conclufion which he does, that (5) " All
" things in the world are wonderfully direAed by a
" divine mind and counfel, to the fafety and corifervation of the whole." K 1 Thefe

Thefe fentiments are -alfo the refult of Seneca's en
<ju»ries : " By Jove, fays he (6), the wife men amongft
" the ancients did not mean fuch an one as we fee in '' th€ Capitol and other temples, but the Guardian *' and Ruler of the univerfe, a mind and spirit, the
" mafter and artificer of this mundane fabric, whom
" every title fuits. Would you call him Fate ? you
** will not err; for he it is on whom all things de
" pend ; the Cause of Causes. Would you call ** him Providence ? you are in the right ? for by his ** wifdom is the world directed ; hence it move.^ *' unfhaken, and performs its every ofnce. Would ** you call him Nature ? 'tis not amifs ; fmce from ** him all things proceed, and by his fpirit we live ; ** or the World ? tis well ; for he is All in all, and
*' exifting by his own power." Innumerable are the inftances which might be brought from the ancients to this purpofe. But thtfe
may fuffice. And from an attentive confideration of tbefe it will appear, that the philofophers endeavoured to eflablifh a particular fyftem with relation to the
origin of idolatry, which tends very much to leffcn the fuppofed abfurdity of it. They maintained (7)
that the idea which the wife men of antiquity had formed to themfelves of God, was that of a Being fuperior to whatever exifts ; of a Spip.it prefent in all the bounds of the univerfe, who animates all, who is the principal of generation, and communi
cates fertility to every being>; of a Flame, lively^, pure, and always zG.iwG -, of an iNTELLiGENCEy infinitely wife, whofe providence continually watches and extends over all ; in a word, an idea of a Being,
to whom they had given different names anfwering to his fuperior excellence ; yet fuch as always bore theftamp of that fupreme right of poflellion, which js only inherent in the abfolute Lord, and in him
from whom all things flow. It is, however, too fatally to be denied, that as the' corruption of the heart of man dilated and enlarged itfeif, a difrelifh of fpiritual things gradually came on, and the mind grew mo-c devoted to fcnfiblc
objeds. Of all created things within his profpect, the. Sun was the moft glorious and the moft likely to engage

engage his attention firft, and next his Wonder and his worfhip^. Accordingly it had been confidered from the beginning as the great or primary emblem of the divinity, being not only the moft beautiful of all bodies in its appearance, but the moft beneficent in its efFecfts ; the regulator of the feafons, and the natural parent of light and fertility. Hence Plato (8)
calls it ** The offspring of the good one, which the ** good one produced analogous to himfelf." It is
termed by others (9) " The eye of Jove," and thie
'* mind of Jove, of heaven, of the world." In fine, whoever will be at the pains to confult Macrobius, may fee that the figures of all the heathen deities were but fo many different expreffions of the qualities and attributes of the Sun, or of the feafons which depended on and were governed by him ; to
whom his votaries afcribed omnipotence, and whom
m their invocations they faluted as ** The power, *' the light, and the fpirit of tiie world (i)." The Solar Bo^ly, before writing, could not more property be reprefcnted than by the figure of a circle ; a (Vmbie fo plain and inoffenfive, that one would think,- it fhould not carMy be perverted to the ufes of idolatry. It was accordingly fubftiluted in hieroglyphics as the artificial (its principal the Sun being the great natural) emblem of the divinity, and became the figure of all the open temples ; the earliefl places of religious woi-fliip. Thefe circles, or difcs, are the fun-images mentioned in fcripture (1), and are at this day the fymbols of royalty, glory, and divi
liity ; and it may be worth while perhaps to remark that the word from which this is fapplied (3), is ufed to fignify idolatry in general, from the near relation which it bears to the original objed of it (4), whofc derivative it is.

moft ancient writers, as " An holy day, becaufe it *' was the birth-day of Apollo, or the fun (5).*' Which indeed was fo far true, that it was the commemoration of that day, on which the human eye was bleffcd with the profpedl of that glorious objed. For it requires no extraordinary fagacity, but only 2. little attention, however generally and unaccountably this point has been over-looked, to fee and be convinced that the firft Holy Seventh Day was the particular ftated day of the Chriftian fabbath. It appears from the original account of it, that the work of the creation took up fix days, and that the
laft created being was man ; who was therefore in all probability formed on the evening of the fixth day. That which immediately fucceeded was the firft of Adam's life as well as the firft fabbath. It was the firft day of his firft week, and month and year, i. e,
the firft in man's account of time. On the expiration of this firft fabbath, he began to number his fecular days, as they advanced in order, till he had told fix. The next was again his Holy Seventh ; yet the firft day of his fecond week, for his weeks were afcer
tained by the return of fabbath. Th»s obtained it duly in all ordinary and civil computations to be the firft day of the week, at the fame time that it was diftinguifhed, with a retrofped to the work of crea
tion, as an Holy Seventh Day. And remarkable it is> that the moft ancient of the heathen writers, while they fpeak of it as fuch, have rendered the very fame reafon for it (6), which the Jewifti legiflator had before

This then being of ancient or patriarchial ufage, was not confined to anyparticular nation or fet of men, like the Jewifli fabbath, but extended to all mankind, and was univerfaily obferved as the birth-day of the world ; but being at length abufed and defecrated to the purpofes of idolatry, it pleafed the divine Being, when he delivered hi« people from the bondage of the ^Egyptians, to confecrate another day to his peculiar vvorfhip,.. This \vas the fclf fame day in which he brought them forth with their armies from the land of -Slgypt. Which was therefore to be a memorial of their deliverance (7), as long as their ftate and polity fhould.

But to refume our fubjexft ; from which, we hopr, the reader will excufe this little digrelfion, if fuch it be. Another emblem of the divinity, in a manner univerfaily received, was the Seraph, or fiery-fiying Serpent, "the Salutis Draco (9), the great fymbol of
Light and Wifdom, of Life and Health. Why the figure of this animal w.^s thus honoured, feveral reafons may be affigned ; as, the annual renovation of " its youth and beauty ; its finuofity, which enabled it to put on various forms ; the acutenefs of vifion, and extraordinary fagacity afcribed to it ; and its colour, which is that of vivid flame, or burnifhed brafs. Its name of Seraph particularly is fo expreffive (i) of that blaze of brightnefs, which it feems to furnifh when reflecting the fplendor of the funbeams, that it has been transferred to a fuperior order of angels ; and is once made ufe of to denote even the glorious appearance of the cherubim (a). This is the fame fymbol which was ered:ed by Mofes in the wildernefs. But this alfo was at length proftituted to abominable purpofes, and made the attribute of all the JEgyptian deities (3)* .

Expanded Wings made a third emblem of the diMnity. This was the hieroglyphic fubftituted for the aether, which was confidered as the natural fymbol of the divine fpirit, and, as fuch, fucceeded to a Ihare of idolatrous worfhip (4). In fome of the original open temples, particularly in that wonderful one of Abiry in Wiltfhire, the complex figure of the Circle, and Seraph, with expanded wings, was reprefented entire. Such were the natural emblems of the divine Being, and fo plain and fimple their hieroglyphical reprefentations ; the original intent of which is explained to us by Kircher (5), from a piece of antiquity in the
Phoenician language : " Jove,'* fays this fragment,
" is a figured Circle ; from it is produced a Serpent
:
" the Circle fhcws the divine nature to be without ** beginning or end ; the Serpent his word, which •* animates the world and makes it prolific ; his ** Wings the fpirit of God, which gives motion to
" the whole fyftem." The commencement of idolatry, avowed and aiming at fome eftablifliment, muft bear date from the extraordinary projed: fet on foot at Babel. The defign, as appears from the original account of it (6), was to build a city and a tower, the citadel or commanding part of which was to be eredted to thefe powers, which are there diftinguifhed as the Shemim, or Heavens. The fuppofition of its being to reach unto the heavens is an addition of the tranflators. The confufion there fpoken of, was the confufion of the

tfee lip, or religious confeflion. The true believers
on this occafion feparated from the idolaters, whom
they left behind in Aflyria to proceed in their mad enterprize, and difperled themfelves in the adjoining, countries, carrying with them the lame language and the fame patriarchal religion, where we find both for a conliderable time after. The confufion of tongue?, as it is called, was but the natural, and by no means the immediate confequence of this difperfion. Next we find the folar body, and its natural fymboi the fire, worfhipped at Ur of the' Chaldees, thence
denominated. The fame fymboi was held in efpecial reverence afterwards by the Perfians, but never worfhipped, in the proper fenfe of the expreflion. The fpecies of idolatry relating to the worfhip of the huv man figure was not introduced till long after; no^ was the temple, which Ninus is faid to have built; ered:ed to his father Belus, as many have aflerted^ but to Bel or Baal-Shemim, the Lord of the Heavens, meaning the Sun. Thus idolatry in Aflyria was prior, to the time of*
Abraham (7), but it was confined to that country ; for neithei in his time, nor for fome time after, do we find
any trac-es of it in Arabia, Phoenicia, or Egypt. We
may reft affured that Ifhmael, the father of the Ara
bians, and his brethren by Keturah, adored the God
of their father, and eftablifhed his worfhip in the eaftcountry, whither they were fent (Gen. xviii. 19). In
Phoenicia, we find Abimelech, the king of the Philiftines, believing in God, favoured wdth a divine intercourfe, and pleading to the heavenly vifion the righte oufnefs of his nation. Their behaviour with Ifaac afterwards leaves no room to doubt that they con
tinued then in the fame faith (8). God himfelf declares to Abraham, that his children Ihall not pofTefs that land till the fourth generation after him y bccaufe the iniquity of itj inhabitants ivaj not yet full Whence it is but rational to conclude, that till the fourth generaticn after, or till about the time of Exodus, they had not, at leaft generally, fwerved into idolatry.

afterwards they began to embrace idolatry fprcadine thitherward from Chaldaea. They could not, however, in any Ihort time after, have amongft them more than the beginnings of idolatry ; though I prefume, they funk into it apace after the departure of Jofeph's
brethren with their families into Egypt. When the patriarch came into this laft-mentioned country alfo,
God is faid to have fent judgments upon Pharoah's family, becaufe of Abraham's wife ; and the king of Egypt feems to have been no ftranger to the true God, but to have had the fear of him befoi-e his eyes, and to have been influenced by it in all his a(5tions(i), Abraham was entertained by him without the appearance of any indifpofition towards him, or any the leaft fign of their having a different religion. Even the heathen writers give hints, that the Egyptians were at firft worlhippers of the true God. Plutarch teftifies, that in Upper Egypt, the inhabitants paid no part of the taxes raifed for the idolatrous worfliip ;
aflerting themfelves to own no mortal being for God
(a), but profefling to worfhip their God Cneph only. Porphyry calls this Egyptian Cncph, tov A»),o«tffj/ov, the Creator of the univerfe. I cannot perfuade myfelf that Jofeph, when long after this he flourifhed at the head of the Egyptian miniftry, had that people deferted the worfhip of the true God, would have married into the family he did, or that the zealous patriarch would have held fo facred and inviolable the lands and endowments of an idolatrous priefthood. With juftice therefore has the great Grotius remarked ( ,) that in the age of Jofeph no certain footfteps of idolatry are to be difcerned in Egypt. I would give it to the reader as a conjf^cture highly probable, that idolatry was not eftablifhed by law in any part of that country, till the difgrace of Mofes at the court of Egypt, when he firft retired to his brethren in Gofhen ; about forty years before the
Exodus. Tph is countenanced by a pafTage of fcripture, where it is faid of the children of Ifrael, that
ti^ey facrificed unto de'vihy not to GoD ; to gods nvhom they kneq.u noty to new gods that^ came newly up, ivh^m their fathers feared not (4}. / So (l) See Shuckford's Connexion, vol. I. p. a8l, and 3ii.

So that Eufebius, La<5tantius, CafTiin, Lucian, with many of the Jewifh Rabbles, as well as Voflius ; the
Abbe Banier, and the moderns in general, appear to
have been grofsly miftaken, in making either Phoenicia or Egypt the birth-place of idolatry. But this fymbolical and hieroglyphical divinity, proceeded from Aflyria through Phoenicia to Egypt. But it was the Phoenician commerce which fpread it in the remoteft quarters of the world ; and it is obferved,
that in all the religions we know, even in the Eaft and Weft Indies, there is not one of them, whofe theology is not full of the like emblems. It muft be confefled that the multiplication of fymbols became at length an inexhauftible fund of idolatry. Thofe characters which, before the knowledge of letters, were innocent and even necelTary, being by that rendered in a fhort time ufelefs, generally negle<fted, underftood by few, and at laft grievoully perverted,
were the occafion of infinite errors. This may be well exemplified by a Ihort account of the ZodiacC?). The crab, an animal walking backwards or oblique
ly, feemed a proper emblem of the fun, who arriving at this fign begins his retrogradation (6). The wild goat on the contrary, whole cuftom is to feed as he
climbs, was chofen to denote the Sun, who on coming to this point of the heavens, quits the loweft part of his courfe to regain the higheft. The ram, the bull, and the two kids gave name to the three celeftial houfes, through which the Sun pafles in fpring. This diftinguifhed the different kinds of young cattle, produced in this feafon, as they naturally fuccee(ied each other : the lambs appearing firft, the calves next, and
the kids laft. Two of thefe latter w^re chofen, on account of the peculiar fruitfulnefs of the goat, which generally bears twins. But thefe the Greeks difplaced, fubftituting the twin-brothers, Caftor and Pollux. The; fury of the Lion juftly exprelfed the heat of the' Sun, on his leaving Cancer. The virgin crowned with ears of corn, was an emblem of the harveft, ufually ending about that time. Nothing could better denote the equality of days and nights under the autumnal equinox, than the balance Libra. The difcafes,

cafes, confequent upon the fall of the leaf, were charaderifed by the Scorpion. The chafe of wild beafts, annually obferved at that time, was not improperly diftinguilhed by Sagittarius, a man on horfe*
back, armed with a bow and arrow. Aquarius reprefented the rains of winter ; and the two Filhes bound together, or inclofed in a net, indicated the feafon for fifhing, ever beft at the approach of fpring. What could be more limple and ufeful than this divifion of the Sun's annual courfe into twelve equal portions, exprefled by fo many vifible figns, which ferved to regulate and defcribe the fc^fons and the bufinefs proper to each. Thefe rude delineations of the celeftial houfes probably gave birth to painting. But then thefe images prefented to the mind a meaning very different from the idea conveyed to the eye.
And when this meaning was loft, the imagination was quickly at work to fupply another more agreeable to its own corruption.
The kingdom of Egypt, on account of its peculiar fituation, became the great fchool of this fymbolical learning ; and thence, in procefs of time, the grand mart of idolatry. It is not improbable that the priefts might endeavour to ftem the torrent of fuperftition that enfued from it, till finding all their ftrength ineffedtual, they fubmitted to the times, and from views of avarice and ambition became public defenders of thofe errors, which fecretly they condemned. For, it is certain, that while thus they complied \vith the popular language, they yet ftudied all they could colled of the ancient and real fignification of the fymbolical figures, taking care to require
a profound fecrcfy of all perfuns whom they inftrudted
in this kind of knowledge. And for this reafon fphin^es were placed at the entrances of their temples, inlimating to thofe who approached, that they were to look for a further meaning in what they Ihould fee ; for that all was myfterious there.
Such was the origin of thofe initiations ^o much fought after in Egypt, Afia, and afterwards in Greece. Indeed thefe myfteries themfelves were in the end moft grofly abufed : yet there is no qucftion, but that in their primary inftitution they were intended to explain the natural and divine things couched under thofe reprefentaticns. For they did not only unfold the nature

Thus the ancient Eaftern nations had a referved:^ meaning in- ail their emblematical figures ; which it is frequently in our power, even at this diftance of time,
to make out. Much of the language fpoken by them is ftill exifting : by the means of whith, matters of fo remote antiquity may in a great meafure be difcngaged from that myfterious darkntfs, in which the ignorance of fome ages, and the follies of others, have involved them.

The names of animals, fo intimately expreflive of their properties, befperdc it to have been given by the great author of nature ; and thofe of the firft men (9^, fo nicely applied to their refpe<5live conditions and circumflances, leave no room to doubt that they were coseval with the.perfons themfelves.

The reader will coniider this as an apology for the freeufe which is made of thistwngue in the preceding fheets; where he will find a great -number of ftrange and oiU^rrjuifi unaccountable ftories, having their foundations folely in the different meanings of the fame Aword : So that an account, in itfelf innocent and eafy, by beiiig perverfely rendered, became fi-equencly the fource of idle wonder, and at length of idolatrous venera'.ion. It is not from the fabulous Greeks them
felves that we are to expect full faiisfadion in thefe matters. Very few of them gave themfelves the trouble to enquire inio the meaning of their own ceremonies. Every thing that was but Egyptian was readily adopted, and the very names of the gods they worfhipped were originally taken upon truft. For the PelalgisnR, as Herodotus informs us (i), had formerly facriiiced and prayed to gods in general, without attributing cither name or iirname to any deity, which in thofe times they had never heard of; but they called them gods, becaufe they difpofed and governed all .a6"ions and countries. After a long time the name? of the other gods were brought among them fi-om Egypt, and lafl of all that of Bacchus ;
upon which they confulted the ©racle of Dodona, ftill ?xcourted the moft ancient, and then the only or::cle in Greece, and having enquired whether they ihould receive thefe names from the barbarians, the oracle anfwered, they Oiould. So from that time they invoked the gods in their facrifices under diftinft names ; and the fame were afterwards received by the
Greeks from thefe Pelafgians. This, fays my author, I had from the prieftefles of Dcdcna. It is faid to the honour of Mofts, that he w^as learned in d.V> the v.ifdorn of the Egyptians. Whence is it then that greater abfurdities in religion have been afcribed to this wife people, than have been

m^t with amongft the moft barbarous and uncivilized nations ? This could only proceed from the taveliing Greeks, who underftood little of what they faw, and
made the worft ufe of what they carried home ; which, by their poets, was afterwards enlarged and diverlified with all the wantonnefs of a licentious imagination Thus that idolatry, which had its foundation
in the vanity and corruption of the human heart, was chiefly indebted for its f?bulous bulk amongft the
Greeks, to the warm and plaftic imagination of the poets ; was ftill further improved by the boldnefs of the pencil, the fine expreflion of the chlflel, and the licence of the ftage.
When the hum.an figure was firft made the object of idolatrous veneration, vci?.y perhaps be difficult
to determine. We read of graven images in the
land of Canaan, in the time of Mofes and JofJiua. But thefe in all probability were extremely rough and inartificial, and perhaps nothing more than upright ftones or ftanding pillars. Such as they were, however, Cadmus is faid to have carried the ufe of them into Greece. I iliouid imagine, that they were not worlhipped in Egypt till long after ; efpecialiy if that be true, which Clemens of Alexandria quotes Leo as affirming (2), in his treatife of the Egv'ptian gods, that their celebrated Ifis lived not till the time of Lynceus, in the eicventii generation after Moles. It has been generally allowed, that the perfons whofe memory was thus religioufly preferved, v/ere fuch as had been greatly diftinguifhed for the invention of ufeful arts, and their beneficence to mankind
(3). But to make this fpecies of idolatry go down
with the people, fomcthing more than a pretended deification feems to have been necefiary ; became, in order to ftcure this extravagant honour to their favourites, we find the Egyptians arraying their images V ith various enfigns and attribute^ ; thus makucg them the repreientatives of fuch ratural things as were adored already by tiie fuperf:itiaus herd. Thus
we find Ofiris adorned with the tmbltm.s of the fun, Ifis decked with thofe of ihc aether, and the golden Seraph

2«g' THEOLOGY OF
Seraph infeparablc from Orus (4). Granting tftert^ f(xre that there were fuch pcrfons in the world, as Jupiter, Apollo, Bacchus, Ifis, &c. yet we muft allow the attributes given, and the ceremonies paid to them, to be fokly applicable to the luminaries, or to the natural caufes and eft'eds, which, it is manifeft, were reprefented by them. Or it may be that mankind were not altogether fo eager and fo hafty in their corniptions ; that the confecration of eminent and virtuous men was no more in the firfl place than a fort of canonization ; and that the worlhip paid to them was only confidered as a public teftimony of their belief, that fuch perfons were received into the abodes of the blefled, and
numbered among the fons of God. This at leaft was the opinion of Cicero (5). For that the law com
mands thofe who v/ere confecrated from amongft men, to be worfhipped ; it fhews indeed, fays he,
that the fouls of all men are immortal ; but that thofe of the brave and the good are divine.
May we not therefore conclude, with regard to the ancient Egyptians particularly, that they were not
ignorant of he One Supreme Being, who by his knowledge conceived the world, before he formed it by his will ; but to comply with the growing corruptions of mankind, in which compliance they were extremely guilty, allowed them to adore (and in this no doubt they found their account) the different attributes of his eflence, and the different effeds of his goGdncfs under the fymbols of the heavenly powers, of renowned perfonages, and" at laft even of terreftrial bodies, as plants and animals ; thus wilfully laying the foundation of the groifeft fuperftition and idolatry.
How little the befotted Greeks had to fay for them
felves on this head, and how ignorant indeed they were of their own religious rites, has been remarked already. As thefe took their gods fo fondly from the
Egyptians, fo did the Romans theirs chiefly from them. This appears at large in the preceding fheets. It

It muft be confeffed at the fame time, that as fome of thefe laft refer the whole multitude of their divinities to the fun, the original objed: of idolatry, thence
called the univerfal one (6). So did others of them
to the Great Author of Nature, affirming,
** Jupiter to be the foul of the world (7), who fonned *' the univerfe of the four elements, and fills and *' moves it thus compacted." In the xther he is Jupiter -f in the air, Juno ; in the fea, Neptune ; in the lower parts of the fea, Salacia ; in the earth, Pluto ; in hell, Proferpine ; in domeftic fires, Vefta ; in the working-furnace, Vulcan; in the heavenlybodies, the Sun, Moon, and Stars ; amongft diviners, Apollo ; in trade, Mercury ; in Janus, the Beginner ; in boundaries, the Terminator ; in time, Saturn ; in war. Mars and Bellona ; Bacchus in the vintage; Ceres in the harveft ; in the woods, Diana ; in the fciences, Minerva ; and is himfelf, in fine, the whole multitude of vulgar gods and goddefles. Thefe are all the one Jupiter, whether they be confidered, according to fome, as parts of himfelf, or, according to others, as his virtues and attributes. This is exadly of a piece with the reafoning of Seneca ; who
aflerts that God may have names in number equal to his gifts (8). Notwithftanding this, we find on fome occaficns,
even among thefe, the monftrous abfurdity of making new gods arrived to fuch a pitch, that temples have
been every now and then vowed and eie<!Sed by magiftrates and commanders, even to creatures of' their own fudden imagination ; fuch as the chance of war,
or their own wifhes or fears had raifed. So that Pliny's obfervations (9), with fome allowance for the

^^' E fhall now enter into tlie nature of the Pagan fables, their religious fentiments, and the manner of their worfhip. Here we Ihall find truth blended with error, and obfcnred with Rclion, which has wrapt in clouds the moft important dodrines, fuch as the creation of the world, the fall of man, the dcftruc'^ion of the human race by an univerfal deluge, the change produced in nature by that great event, the origin of nature and moral evil, and the final rtftitution of all things to their primitive glory and fplendor. Notwithftanding the great corruption which had crept into the worftip of all nations, we have feen
that the men of learning and refledion generally maintained honpurable notions of the deity, and the obligations of moral virtue. As the Greeks and Romans had received their divinities from Phoenicia and Egypt, and by miftaking the manners, the cuftoms and language of thofe nations, had made gods ©f the
common fymbols which they employed to teach the people to honour one God, the author of all good, to live in peace, to exprefs the times and feafons for the performance of the common occurrences of life, and to expedt a better ftate to come ; fo their religion became obfcured by fables, and a variety of fi<5tions, which, while the vulgar underftood in a literal fenfe, their fages endeavoured to explain and reduce to ingenious allegories, and thereby to render the heathen worfhip confident with ^11 the natural notions of a fupreme Deity, the wife governor of the world, and by accounting for the introdudion of moral evil, t» vindicate the rules of his providence, and to juftiff the ways of God to man. Fables are indeed a very ancient method of conveying truth, and veils of fo fine a texture as not wholly to conceal the beauties that lie beneath them.

" Thus," fays, Origen (i), " the Egyptian philofo** phers have fublime notions with regard to the
" Divine Nature, which they keep fecret, and never ** diicover to the people, but under the veil of fa•* bles and allegories. All the Eaftern nations, the ** Perfiar.s, the Indians, the Syrians, conceal fecret *' myiteries under their religious fables. The wife ** men of all nations (a) fee into the true fenfe and ** meaning of them, whilft the vulgar go no further ** than the exterior fymbol, and fee only the bark ** that covers them." This was frequently the cafe when foreign and diftant nations adopted what they but imperfe<5lly uuderftood. Allegories became objeds of faith. Thus eould any thing give a more lively idea of the ftate of retribution, than the ceremonies with which the Egyptians buried their dead. The Greeks and Romans, (truck with the ideas that were lo ftrongly conveyed, took the type for the reality; the boat which was to convey the body to the place of burial, which was v.-ith the Egyptians an emblem of death, and was en -led Tranquillity, becaufe it carried over none but the juft, was reprefented by the Greeks and Romans a^ a boat to carry fouls. Cerberus, an hieroglyphic, c^ved out of wood or ftone, to exprefs the lamentations beftowed on the virtuous, became an animated monfter. The lake of Acherulia became a vifionary river of Tartarus, and was called Acheron. The judges that decided the merit of the deceafed, were reprefented as configning the fpirit to final happmefs or mifery, and the flowery field where the righteous alone were buried, into that p)ace of joy which the elizout of the Egyptians was only defigned as a faint reprefgntation of. Yet, notvvithftanding the fables into which thefe myfteries were turned, this very important truth was flill conveyed, that there would be a ftate of judgment, in which
(i) Origen contra Celfum, lib. i. p. ii. (2 "Thofe who are acquainted with thefe myfteries," fays Ifocrates, " infure to themfelves very pleafing hopes " againft the hour of death, and which extend to a whole " eternity." " Thefe myfteries 'fays Epidletus) were efta*' bliftied by the ancients, to regulate the lives of men, and. " to haaifti difuidcrs from- d\e. world,"

which the virtuous would be rewarded, and the vicious punifhed. The very prayer, or form of abfolution, which was gjveii by the Egyptian priefts to the relations of the deceafed, contained a ufeful leffon to the living, as it exhibited a concife fyftem of thofe morals which were to entitle them to the Divine Favour, and to a decent burial in the plains, on the confines of the lake Acherufia. This prayer was prefcrved by Porphyry, who copied it from Euphantes, whofe works are now Icil:, and is as follows :
" O Sun, thou firft divinity ! and ye celcitial Gods
** who gave life to man ! vouchfafe to receive me
" this day unto your holy tabernacles. I have tn
" deavoured, to the beft of my power, to render my
" life agreeable to you ; I have behaved with tlie
" higheft veneration towards the Gods, v.'ith whom
" I was acquainted in my infancy; 1 have never
*' failed in my duty to thofe who brought me into
^* being, nor in natural afteclion to the womb that
*' bore me. My hands are pure from my neigh
" hour's blood ; I have maintained an inviolable ** regard to truth and fidelity ; and may I not appeal *' to the iilence of mankind, who have nothing to
*' lay to my charge, as a fure and certain teftimony
** of my integrity ? If however, any ptrfonal and ** fecret fault has efcaped me, and I have offended in
" eating or in drinking, let theie entrails bear all the ** blame." Here the entrails of the deceafed were produced by the relations, and immediately thrown into the lake. But however ufeful thefe ceremonies might be, as pradifed amongft the Egyptians, yet being confidered as realities by the Greeks, and rendered more ridiculous by the abfurdity of their fables^ it is no wonder that they loft their efficacy, and became, as Juvenal informs us, dilbelieved even by their children. But it is not at ail ftrange, that this fnould be the cafe with the Greek?, when the Egyptians themfelves were fallen into idolatry, and thofe funple emblems, once fo well known to this people, were become the
medium of their prayers and adorations. Every thing had an air of myrcery, and thefe myfleries were
underltood by none but the priefts, or thofe <"o whom
they were pleafcd to explain them, which was always done under the ital of fecrecy. The vulgar were futiered to continue in their errors, fmcc it might have

have been dangerous even for their priefts to attempt to open their eyes, and to reduce their worfhip to the (implicity of the ancient practice. Nothing has ever contributed more to difguife the truth, and to corrupt the worftiip of the Greeks and Romans, than the multitude of fidions introduced by their poets. It is this that has principally occafioned that jumble of images, that indecorum in characters, and that abfurdity in their fidions, which are fo juftly condemned by their wifeft philofophers. It is the province of poetry to change the face of nature, to give life and adivity to inanimate beings, fubftance and form to thought ; to deify the pafTions, and to create a world of its own. The poet is not bound by the fame laws as other men ; he has a power that enables him to create and deftroy at pleafure, and with the fame eafe he forms gods (3), he
roes, men, and monfters. He makes quick tranfitions from reality to fidion ; from fidion to reality, and fi-om thofe gods which he believes to thofe of his ovrn creating ; and from hence arifes a principal fource of that confufion which has given fuch different interpretations to, and which renders it fo difficult to explain the ancient mythology. The
Greek and Roman poets have almolt always preferred the marvellous and the fparkling to the fimplicity of naked truth. If a princefs died of grief for the lofs of her hufband or her child, ihe was changed into a rock or fountain ; inftead of faying that Cephalus rofe with the fun, Aurora muft be in love with the
youth, and force him abroad. To reprefent the long life of loalus, the goddefs of health muft renew his age. Inftead of feying that Endymion ftudied in the mountains of Caria the courfe of the moon, they tell us, that he had there an interview with Diana, and that her ftaying with her gallant was the caufe of eclipfes ; but as thefe amours could not laft for ever, they were obliged to invent a new fable, to account for them another way^ and therefore they feigned that fome forcerefs of Theflaly, by her en
chantments, drew down the moon to the earth. To account for the perpetual verdure of the laurel, they talked

talked of the amours of Apollo and (4) Daphne. To exprefs the agility and fwiftnefs of Periclymnus, they affirmed that he was able to aflume all ihapes, and at laft turned himfelf into an eagle. Amphion, by his oratory, prevailed on a barbarous people to build a city, and to dwell in fociety : he is therefore faid to raife up the walls of Thebes by the found of his lyre ; and Orpheus to charm the lions and tigers, and to move the rocks and trees by his harmony, becaufe nothing could withftand his perfualion, or relift the force of his eloquence.
Who would imagine that by the wings of Dedalus and Icarus, were lignified a Ihip uuder fail ? That all the changes of Achelous, were only frequent inundations ? That by the combat of Hercules with the god of that river, was only meant a bank that was raifed to prevent its overflowing ? That Hercules encountering the hydra of Lerna, fignified no more than a man's draining a marfhy country ? or that Hercules feparating with his hands the two mountains Calpe and Abyla, when the ocean ruHied in with violence, and found a paflage into the Mediterranean, meant no more, perhaps, than that, in the time of one Hercules, the ocean, by the afliftance of an earthquake, broke a neck of land, and formed the llraits of Gibraltar ? Or that the fable of Pafiphas contains nothing but an intrigue of the queen of <I!rete with a captain named Taurus ?
Who could believe that Scylla and Charybdis were only two dangerous rocks near the ifland of Sicil)-, frequently fatal to mariners ? That the frightful monfter which ravaged the plains of Troy, was the inundations of the fea ; or that Hefione's being expofed to this monfter, meant no more than that fhe v>'as to be
given to him who put a ftop to thefe inundations ?
Thus what Homer and Virgil afcribe to Minerva, is to be attributed to prudence and good condud. It is no longer the exhalations that produce thunder, but Jupiter armed to affright mortals. If a mariner perceives a riling ftorm, it is angry Neptune fwelling the waves. Echo ceafes to be a mere found, and becomes a nymph bewailing the lofs of her Narciflus. Thus
(4.) The laurel was called by the Greeks Daphne.

Thus by the cloud with which Minerva concealed UlyfTes, is meant the darknefs of the night, which fuffered him to enter the town of the Phcenicians without being difcovered ; and when Priam is con^ du6led by Mercury into the tent of Achilles, we are only tounderftand, that he fet out to obtain He«5tor's body in the dark, with a prefent to appeafe his anger. Jf the delights of the country of the Lotophagi detain the companions of Ulyfles, we are told by Homer, that the fruits of that ifland made thofe
who tafted them lolc all remembrance of their families, or their native country. This is an ingenious fiftion intended to convey this important truth, that the love of pleafure debauches the mind, and banifhes from the heart every laudable affeflion. If they loiter at the court of Circe, and abandon themfelves to riot and debauchery, this pretended forcerefs, with great elegance and ftrength of expreHion, is laid to turn them into fwine. If the poet, fays Ladtantius, found it for his intereft to flatter or confole a prince for the lofs of his fon, it was but giving him a place amongft the ftars. Shepherds were all fatyrs or fauns ; fhepherdrefles, nymphs or naiades ; Ihips, flying horfes ; men on
horfebeck, centaurs ; every lewd woman v:as a fyren or a h-arpy ; oranges Avere apples of gold ; and arrows and darts, ligiitning and bolts of thunder. Rivers and fountains had their tutelary deities, and fometimes were reprtfented as deities themfelves ; the uniting their ftreams was called marriage, and brooks and canals were their children. If they would fpeak of the rainbow, that too muft be a goddcfs drefied in the richeft colours ; and as they were at a lofs to account for the production of this phsenomenon, it was called the daughter of Thaumas, a poetical perfonage, whofe name figniftes wonderful. Sometimes a concern for the honour of the ladies became the fource of fables. If a princefs proved too frail to withftand the attempts of her lover ; her flatterer, to fcreen her reputation, immediately called in the afliflance of fome enamoured god : this was eafily believed by the ignorant vulgar, for they could fuppofe none but a divine perfon could prefume to attempt one of her rank. Thus her reputation was unfullied, and, inftead of becoming inf:;mous, ihe was honoured, and th<; hulband partook of her glory

glory. Nor are the ftories of Rhea Sylvia (5), the mother of Rhcmus and Romulus, and of Paulina (6), the only inftances to be found in hiftory of the
credulity of hufbands and parents. From this fource
and corruption of the priefts, were derived many of the fables relating to the amours of the gods. At other times, the ftrangeft transformations fprung only from a fimilitude of names, and confifted in a play of words : the Cygnus was transformed into a fwan ; Picus, into a woodpecker ; IJicrafe, into a fpar-hawk ; the Gecrops, into monkies -; and Alopis, into a fox. The ancient opinion, that the world was formed from Chaos, or a confufed concourfe of matter, which Heliod calls the father of the gods, probably had its rile from a literal interpretation of the beginning of that lublime defcription, which Mofes gives us of the creation (7); where j before the formation of any part of the univerfc, it is faid. The earth njjas <ivhhout. -form, and 'voidy and darknefs <^vas upon the face of the deep ; as the latter part of the verfe, where the Spirit
of God is reprefented as moinng or hcvering ouer the Qvaterjf might give the Egyptians, the Phoenicians, the Chaldeans, the Perfians, and the Indians, the idea which they mean to exprefs when they talk of the egg of the world. L But

But it was not fufficient for Hefiod to make a god of Chaos, to defcribe the order that fprang from this confufion ; Chaos muft have an offspring, and therefore, inftead of faying like Mofes, that darknefs was upon the face of the deep, he fays Chaos brought •forth Gloon^inefs and Night ; and, to continue the genealogy, inftead of faying with the infpired writer, God dh'ided the light from the darknefs^ he expreffes fomething like the fame idea, by adding, that from Night fprang Air and Day. Mofes fays, that God ordered the dry land to appear., aud tnafed theJirmament ivhich he called heaven : Hefiod fays, that the Earth begat Heaven, the high Mountains, and the Caves. He then informs us of the origin of the Ocean, who was the father of Springs and Rivers, of the birth of the Sun and Moon, and fcveral other gods of the like kind. It is very evident, that this whole account is nothing more than an allegorical hiftory of the formation of all things, in which the various parts of nature are perfonated ; but the hand of the gn at architetft is wanting. Ovid treats this fubjecft in a more intelligible manner, and with great beauty introduces
the creator, whom he calls God, or Nature, forming thfe various parts with the utmoft regularity and order. But in nothing does he come fo near to Mofes, as in the account he gives of the formation of man, ^'hich, as well as Mofes, he makes the laft work of the creation, and introduces Prometheus, or Council, forming him of clay, in the image of the gods.

" extraordinary ftrength, that they refolved to make
" war upon the gods : Jupiter, incenfed at this en
" ttrprize, would have deftroyed them as he had
" done the giants ; but feeing that by this means he
" mult have deftroyed the whole human race, he
" contented himfelf with dividing them afunder; and, *' at the fame time, ordered Apollo to ftretch over ** the breaft, and other parts of the body, the (kin, *' as it is at prefcnt. Thefe two parts of the body
" thus disjoined, want lo be re-united ; and this is *' the origin of love." Ovid mentions only the formation of man, without taking the leaft notice of Eve, in which he evidently
copies the account given- us by Mofes, who omits me^ltion^ng this in his general hiftory of the creation. And the hint of this fable was probably taken fr^a this circumftance, where the fci*ipture fays (i), God created man^ and then adtls, male and femals created he them ; and the jcircumftance of their being cut afunder, the doling up the flefh, and the reafon given for conjugal love, from Eve's being made of a rib taken out of Adam's fide, and his faying upon this. She is bone of my bove,, ar.djiejh of rnyfujh; there'
fore fhall a man leanjs his father and mother^ andclea-ve unto his <v.nfe (2). Hence it feems at lealt probable, that the writings of Mofes were not unknown to the Greeks, wbich makes it the more likely, that thefe writings, or a more ancient tradition, gave riie to the different reprefentations the Pagans have given us of an original ftate of innocence, which was an obje^ of faith amongft all civilized nations. This has been painted in the moft beautiful colours, by the heathen poets, under the diilin(Jtion of the golden age, or the reign of Saturn. In feveral things, indeed, both Mofes and the heathen philofophers agree : they equally aflert, that
man was created in a Jl:ate of innocence, and confcquently in a Hate of happinefs, but that debafmg his

to be omitted. " The world, at its birth, fays he, '' (5)received'from its Creator all that is good ; what** ever it has at prefer t, that can be called wicked or ** unhappy^ is an indifpofition foreign to its nature,

gciicrally believed. Hence, according to Plutarch^ came their fables of the Titans and Giants, and the
engagements of Python againft Apollo ; which have
fo near a refcmblance to the fidions of Ofiris and
Typhon. Thefe were beings fuperior to men, and yet compofed of a fpiritual and corporeal nature ;
and confoquently capable of animal pleafures and pains. Vii'e fidions relating to the giants, in Mr. Banier's opinion (6), took their rife from a palFage in
Genefis, Tvhere it is fcAd, that the (7) fons of God, whopi the ancients fiippofcd to be guardian angels, became enamoured vvith the cbughtcrs of men, and that their children were mighty men, or giants, the
v/ord in the original fignifying either giants, or men become monitrous by their crimes ; their heads in-fiead of their guilt, Wv're faid to reach to the clouds, while the wickcdnefb of their lives might not improperly be termed fightin;^ againll God, and daring the thunder of heaven. But however this be» it will hardly be doubted but that this paflage might give rife to the amours of the gods and goddelTes, and their various intrigues with ntortale . A'j the frequent appearance of real angels to the patriarchs, and the hofpitable reception they met v.ith under the difFuife of travellers, might give room for the poets to form, upon the fame plm, the tales of Baucis and Philemon, and to conir.Ul that beautiful picture of humble content, and ou the peace that bleflas the homely cottages of the innocent and good, with the
ftory of Lycaon ; who waniing humanity, and being of a favage inholpitable ter^per, is, v.'ith great propriety, faid to change his form into one more fuitable to the difpoiition of his mind. The moral of this
fable is, that humanity is the charaderiftic of man ; and that a cruel foul in a hun.jn bcdy is only a wolf in difguife. It is certain, that the traditions relating to the univerfal deluge, have been found in almofc all nations ; and though the deluge of Deucalion Ihould not appear to be the lame as that of Noah, it cannot be doubted, but that fome circumftances have been borrowed

borrowed from Noah's hiftory, and that thefe are the moft ftriking parts of the defcription. Lucian, fpeaking of the ancient people of Syria, the country where the deluge of Deucalion is fappofed to have happened, fays (8) that '' The Greeks alTert in their
" fables, that the firfl: men, being of an infolent and
" o-uel difpolition, inhuman, inhofpitable, and re
" gardlefs of their faith, were all deftroyed by a de
" luge; the earth (9) pouring forth vaft ftreams of '' water, fwelled the rivers, which, together with
" the rains, made the fea rife above its banks, and
" overflow the land, fothat all was laid under water;
" that Deucalion alone faved himfelf and family in ** an ark, and two of each kind of wild and tame '* animak, who, lofing their animofity, entered into '* it of their own accord ; that thus Deucalion floated *' on the waters till they became alTuaged, and then '* repaired the human race."
We are alfo informed, that this veffc-l relied on a high mountain ; and Plutarch even mentions the dove, and Abydenus fpeaks of a certain fowl being let out of the ark, which, finding no place of relt,
returned tvv^ce into the veflel. We are told too, that Deucalion, a perfon of ftriet piety and virtue, offered facrifice to Jupiter, the f^iviour. Thus the facred writings inform us, that Noah offered facrinces of clean beafts, in token of gratitude to God. for havirig gracioufiy preferved both liim and his family. Thus it appears, that idolatry and fables being once fet on foot, the people, who ftill retained confufed ideas of fome ancient truths, or the moft remarkable particulars of fome paft tranfactions, adapted them to the prefent mode of thinking, or applied them to fuch fables as f:;emed to have any relation thereto. By this m^eans truth and fallhood were
blended together ; and thus it happens, that we frequently find fome traces of hiitory intermingled with the moft ridiculous fidions, and remarkable tranfactions fometimes pretty exadtly related, though at the fame time confounded with the grolTeft abfurdities.

fcrved, and handed down from the mofl early ages. This appears to be the moft ancient method of reckoning time, fincc it was very early obfcrved by the Egyptians. Bat of this we have faid enough in the jVrcctding diflertation, to which it properly belongs. it appears from the account we have given of the theology of the ancients, that the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans worfhipped only one Almighty, independent Being, the Father of gods and men, with a lupreme adoration ; and that the feveral fuperior deities publickly worfhipped, were only different names or attributes of the fame Gods. This is aff-rted not only by feveral of the Pagans, but even by M, Auftin. Whether this diftinvftion was maintained by the bulk of the people amongft the Greeks and Romans, is not fo ealy to determine ; it is probable,., that they might imagine them diftin(5t beings, fubordi nate to the fupreme. However, there were others univerfaliy allowed to be of an inferior clafs, and ihtfe were ihv national and tutelary deities ; among v/hich lait number \\*e may reckon tjie good daemons, or houfhold gods, which the Romans, upon conquering any-ndtitm or city, invited to take up their' rtfidence amongft them. Thefe were undoubtedly vvQiiliipped wilh an inferior kind of adoration. Since, the Stoic and Epicurean philoibphers, who allowed their exil^cncc, bciitved them to be mortal, and that they weie to periJh in the general conflagration, in V. hich they imagined the world was to be deftrcyed
by fire. To this Piiny alludes, when defcribing the darknefs and horror that attended the eruption of Vefuvius, he fays, that fome were lifting up theirhands to the gods ; but t hat the great er part imagined, that the lalt and eternal night was come, which was to deftroy both the gods and the world together. This diftin«5tion may be juflified by the united tcf-timony of the ancients ; and indeed it in a great meafure removes the abfurdity of the continually introducing what were called new gods ; that is ncwmediators, and new methods or ceremonials to be added, on particular occafions, to the ancient vvorfhip. The idolatry of the Pagans, did not cohfift in paying a dhxS. adoration to.ihc ftatues, but in making them

them the (i) medium of worlhip ; and therefore, whether the feveral deities were reckoned to be inferior beings, or only different names or attributes of ope fupreme ; yet their fymbols, the fun, moon, and ftars, or the ftatues erected to the honour of their gods, were never (except amongft the loweft and moft ignorant of people) acknowledged as the ultimate objedts of worfhip. In thefe ftatues, however, the deity was fuppofcd to refide in a peculiar manner. But even this was not always the cafe ; it is very evident, that the ftatues eredted to the pafiions, the virtues, and the vices, were not of this clafs. The
Romans had particular places for offering up particular petitions ; they offered up their prayers for health in the temple of Sallus ; they prayed for the prefervation of their liberties before the ftatue of Liberty, and offered their facrifices to the Supreme before a figure expreffive of their v;ants. Fever, in the opinion of the moft ftupid of the vulgar, could never be coniidered as a god, yet at the altar of Fever they befcught the Supreme to preferve them from being infc(5ted with this diforder, or to cure their friends who v.'cre already infed-ed by it : and at the altar of Fear,
(l) The folly of repreienting the inilnite and omnlprcfcnt fpirit, by a fcufible image, is obvious from a very fmall degree of rcficcflion ; and from hence arifcs the crime of idolatry, or reprefcDtiug him by the works of nature, or thofc of jrien's hands, as it is a degradation uf the deity, and an affront to the Being, whofc glorious effcnce is unlimited and. i^nconfmcd ; from hence proceeds that exclamation of the prophet, IVhereunto Jhall you 'Llim'^i me, fititli the Lord, &.C. When the IfraeUtes made the golden calf, and cried out, '2'l>is is the God that brought us out cf the land of J'gypt, they muft'be fuppcfed to mean, T/»/j reprefmts the God tkat Irottght ; s out cf the land of Egypt. Tliey had lately left a country fond of fymbols, where they had been ufed to fee one thing reprefented by another; and the fun, the mofl glorious image T)f the deity, when he enters into Taurus, reprefented by a hull. Had they been fo ftupid as to imagine tMs calf, which ilicy had juft made, to be the god of their fathers ; the god that had wrought fo many miracles for them, even before they had given him exiftence ; their folly would be entirely inconfiftent with the rational nature of man, and they muft have been abfolutely incapable both of moral and civil go•/erraent. and could only be accounted idiot; or madmen.



THE HEATHENS. 'J.1S
Fear, they put up their fupplications, that they might be preferved from the influence of a ftiamtful pannic in the day of battle.
As this appears evidently to be the cafe, it is no
wonder that the number of thefe kind of gods became
very great. Some of thefe, by the parade of cere
monies that attended this method of devotion, were found to have a mighty effed on the minds of the vulgar : So that when any virtue began to lofe ground, a temple, or, at leaft, an altar erefted to its honour, was fure to raife it from its declining ftate, and to reinftate its influence on the heart of m.an. This appears to be a true reprefentation of the cafe, from the account which Dionyfms of Halicar
naffus gives (2) of the reafons which induced Numa Pompilius to introduce Faith into the number cf the Roman divinities,, and which, doubtlefs, gave rife to all the other deities of the fame kind, that were af
terwards introduced. ** To engage his people to
** mutual faith and fidelity, fays he, Numa had re
" courfe to a method hitherto unknown to the moft ** celebrated legiflators ; public c^ntrafts^ he obferv
" ed, were feldom violated, from the regard paid to
" thofe who were witnefTes to any engagement, v%'hilc
" thofe made in private, though in their ov/n nature ** no lefs indifpenfible than the other, were, not fo *' ftridly obferved ; whence he concluded, that by
" deifying Faith, thefe contracts would be ftill more ** binding: befidcSy he thought it unreafonable, that
" while divine honours were paid to Juftice, Nemehs
" and Themis, Faith, the moft facred and venerable ** thing in the world, Ihould receive neither public ** nor private honour ; he therefore built a temple to ** public Faith, and inilituted facrifices, the charge ** of which was defrayed by the public. This he did ** with the hope, that a veneration for this virtue
" being propagated through the city, would infenfi** bly be communicated to each individual. His conjectures proved true, and Faith became fo revered, that fhe had more force than even wlt
" neffes and oaths ; fo that it was the common me
" thod, in cafes of intricacy, for magiftrates to re*' fer the decilion to the faith of the contending *' parties,"

Thus it appears evident, that thefe kind of gods, and the temples ereded to their honour, were founded not only on political, but on virtuous principles. This was undoubtedly the cafe, with refpe<^ to the Greeks as well as the Romans ; for a propofal being, made at Athens, to introduce the combats of the gladiators ; firft throw down, cried out an Athenian philofopher from the midil of the r-iTemlly, throw down the altar, erecfted by our anceftors above a
thoufand years ago to Mercy. Was not this to fay, that they had no need of an altar to infpire a regard to mercy and compaflion, when they v^-anted public fpedlacles to teach a favage cruelty and hardntfs of heart.

I. OF ASTROLOGY.
Astrology was doubtlefs the flrft method of
divination, and probably prepared the mind of man for the other, no lefs abfurd, ways of fearching into futurity ; and therefore a fhort view of the rife of this pretended fcience cannot be improper in this place, efpecially as the hiftory of thefe abfurdities is
the bed method of confuting them. And indeed, as this treatife is chiefly defigned for the improvement of youth, nothing can be of greater fervice to them than to render them able to trace the origin of tho-fe pretended fciences, fome of which have even ftill an influence on many weak and ignorant minds. But to proceed. The Egyptians becoming ignorant of the aftronomical hieroglyphics, by degrees, looked upon the names of the figns, as exprefling certain powers with which they were invefted, and as indications of their feveral oflSces. The Sun, on account of its fplendt)r and enlivening influence, was imagined to be the
great mover of nature ; the Moon had the fecond rank of powers, and each fign and conftellation a certain fhare in the governm.ent of the world ; the
Ram had a ftrong influence over the young of the flocks and herds ; the Ballance could infpire nothing but inclinations to good order and jufticc ; and the Scorpion excite only evil difpofitions ; and, in fliort, that each fign produced the good or evil intimated by its name. Thus, if the child happened to be
born at the inftant when the firft ftar of the Ram rofe above the Horizon, (when, in order to give this nonfenfe the air of a fcience, the ftar was fuppofed to have

have its greatcft influence) he would be rich in cattle;
and that he who fhould enter the world under the Crab, ihould meet with nothing but difappointment, and all his affairs fhould go backwards and down
wards. The people were to be happy whofe king
entered the worM under the fign of Libra ; but completely wretched if he fliould light under the horrid lign Scorpion : the perfons born under Capricorn, efpecially if the Sun at the fame time afcended the Horizon, were fure to meet with faccefs, and to rife upwards like the Wild Goat, and the Sun which then afcends for fix months together ; the Lion v/as to produce heroes ; and the Virgin with her ear of corn to infpire chaftity, and to unite virtue and abundance. Could any thing be more extravagant and ridiculous ! ** This way of arguing," fays an ingenious modern
author, " is nearly like that of a man, who fliould *• imagine, that, in order to have good wine in his *' cellar, he need do no more than hang a good cork «* at the door." The cafe was exadly the fame with refped to the planets, whofe influence is only founded on the wild fuppofition of their being the habitation of the pretended deities, whofe names they beai', and the fabulous characters the poets have given them. Thus to Saturn they gave languid and even deftruftive influences, for no other reafon, but becaufe they had been pleafed to make this planet the refi
dence of Saturn, who was painted with grey hairs and a fcythe.
To Jupiter they gave the power of bellowing crowns, and diftributing long life, wealth and grandeur, merely becaufe it bears the name of the father of life. Mars was fuppofed to infpire a ftrong inclination for war, becaufe it was believed to be the reiidence
of the God of war.
Venus had the power of rendering men voluptuous and fond of pleafure, becaufe, they had been pleafed to give it the name of one, who, by fome, was thought to be the mother of pleafure. Mercury, though almoft always invifible, would never have been thought to fuperintend the profperity of ftates, and the affairs of wit and commerce, had not men, without the leaft reafon, given it the name of one who was fuppofed to be the inventor of civil polity. According



APPENDIX. 2^9
According to the aflrologers, the power of the afcending planet is greatly increaled by that of an afcending fign ; then the benign influences are all united, and fall together on the heads of all the happy infants which at that moment enter the world (i) ; yet can any thing be more contrary to experience, which fliews us, that the charaders and events, produced by perfons born under the fame afped of the ftars, are fo far from being alike, that they are dire<5tly oppofite. Thus it is evident, that aftrology is built upon no principles, that it is founded on fables, and on influences void of reality. Yet abfurd as it is, and ever was, it obtained credit, and the more it fpread, the greater injury was done to the caufe of virtue. Inftead of the exercife of prudence and wife precaution, it fubftituted fuperftitious forms and childiih prac^tices, it enervated the courage of the brave by apprehenfions grounded on puns and quibbles, and encouraged the wicked by making them lay to the charge of a planet thofe evils which only proceeded from their own depravity. But not content with thefe abfurdities, v^-hich deftroyed the very idea of liberty, they aflerted that thefe (i) " What completes the ridicule, fays the Abbe, la
" Pluche, to whom we are obliged for thefe judicious ob*' fervations, is, that what uftronomers call the firfl degree " of the Ram, of the Balance, or of Sagitarius, is no longer *' the firft fign, which give fruitfulnefs to the fiocks, inlpires " men with a love of juftice, or forms the hero. It has " been found that all the celeflial fignshave, by little receded " from the vernal Equinox, and drawn back to the eaft : " notwithftanding this, the point of the zodiac that cuts the " equator is ftill called the firft degree of the Ram, though
"• the firft ftar of the Ram be thirty degrees beyond it, and " all the other figns in the fame proportion. When there' fore any one is faid to be born under the firft degree of " the Ram, it was iu reality one of the degrees of Pifces " that then came above the horizon ; and when an©ther is " faid to be born with a royal foul, and heroic dlfpofition, " becaufe at his birth the planet Jupiter afcendcd the horizon, *' in conjun6lion with the firft ftar of Sagit^ary ; Jupiter was " indeed at that time in conjundion Avith a Itar thirty decrees " eaftward of Sagittary, and in good truth it was the periii*' cious Scorpion that prtfided at the biith of this happy, this *' incomparable child." Abbe Pluchc's Hiftory of the Heavens, Vol. 1. p. ijj.

thefc ftars, which had not the leaft connexion with mankind, governed all the parts of the human body
(z), and ridicuioudy affirmed, that the Ram prefided over the head ; the *3uil over the gullet ; the Twins over the breafl: ; the Scorpion over the entrails ; the Filhes over the feet, <Scc. By this means they pretended to account for the various diforders of the body ; which was fuppofed to be in a good or bad difpofition, according to the different afpeds of the
(igns. To mention only one inftance ; they pretended that great caution ought to be ufed in taking a medicine under Taurus, or the bull, becaufe as this animal chews his cud, the perfon would not be ableto keep it in his ftomach. Nay, the influences of the planets were extended to the bowels of the earth, where they were fuppofed to produce metals. From hence it appears, that when luperftition and folly are once on foot, there is no fettiug bounds to their progrefs. Gold, to be fure, muft be the production of the Sun, and the conformity in point of colour, brightnefs, and value, was a fenfible proof of it. By the fame way of reafoning,
the Moon produced all the lilver to which it was related by colour j Mars all the iron, v/hich ought to be
the fa^ ourite metal of the God of War ; Venus prefided over copper, which fhe might well be fuppofed to produce, fmce it was found in plenty in the ifle of Cyprus, which was fuppofed to be the favourite refidence of this goddefs. By the fame fine way of reafoning, the other planets prefided over the other metals. The languid Saturn was fet over mines of lead J
(2) Each hour of the day had alfo one ; the number feven, as beiiig that of the planets, became of mighty confequence. The feven days in the week, a peiiod of time handed down by tradition, happened to correfpond with the number of the planets ; and therefore they gave the name of a planet to each day ; and from thence feme days in the week were confidered as more fortunate or unlucky than the reft : and hence feven times feven, called the clima<5ierical period of hours, days or years, were thought extremely dangerous, and to have a furprizing effecl on private perfons, the fortune of princes, and the government of ftutes. Thus the mind of man became diftrefild by imaginary evils, and the approach of thefe moments, in themfelves as harmlefs as the reft of their Hves, has, by the ftrength of invagination, brought on the moft fatal cffe<5ls.

lead ; and Mercury, on account of his a<5lJvity, had the fuperintendancy of quickfilver ; w hile it was the province of Jupiter to prefide over tin, as this was the only metal that was left him. From hence the metals obtained the names of the planets ; and from this opinion, that each planet engendered its own peculiar metal, they at length conceived an opinion, that as one planet was more powerful than another, the metal produced by the weakefl was converted into another by the influence of a ftronger planet. Lead, though a real metal, and as perfed in its kind as any of the reft, was confidered as only a half metal, which, through the languid influences of old Saturn, was left imperfed ; and therefore, under the afped: of Jupiter, it was converted into tin ; under that of Venus, into copper ; and at laft into gold, under fome particular afpeds of the Sun. And from hence, at laft arofe the extravagant opinions of the alchymifts, who, with wonderful fagacity, endeavoured to fmd out means for haftening thefc changes or tranfmutations, which, as they conceived, the planets performed too flowly ; but, at laft, the world was convinced that the art of the iilchymift was as Lneffedual as the influences of the planets, which, in a long fucceffion of age«, had never been known to change a mine of kad to that of tin, or any other metal.
II. OF PRODIGIES,
VVhOEVER reads the Roman hiftorians(3), muft he furprifed at the number of prodigies which are conftantly recorded, and v/hich frequently filled the people with the moft dreadful apprehenfions. It muft be confefTed, that fome of tliefe fcem altogether fupernatural ; while much the greater part only confift
of fome of the uncommon produdions of nature, which fuperftition always attributed to a fuperior caufe, and reprefented as the prognoftication of fome
impending misfortunes. Of this clafs may be reckoned the appearance of
two funs, the nights illuminated by rays of light, the views (3) Particularly lavy, Dionyflus of Halicarnaffus, Pliny, rind Valerius Maximus.

\ic\vs of fighting armies, fwords and fpears darting through the air ; ihowers of milk, of blood, of ftones, of aflies, or of fire ; and the birth of monfters, of children, or of beafts who had two heads, or of in
fants who had feme feature refembling thofe of the brute creation. Thefe were all dreadful prodigies, which filled the people with inexprefiible aftonifhment, and the whole Roman empire with an extreme perplexity ; and whatever unhappy event followed upon thefe, was fure to be either caufed or predided by them. Yet nothing is more eafy than to account for thefe produ(ftions ; which have no relation to any events that may happen to follow them. The appearance of two fans has frequently happened in England, as well as in other places, and is only caufed by the clouds being placed in fuch a fituation, as to reflect the image of that luminary ; nodturnal fires, inflamed fpears, fighting armies, were no more than what we call the aurora borealis, northern lights, or inflamed vapours floating in the air : fhowers of ftones, of allies, or of fire, were no other than the effedls of the eruptions of fome volcano at a confiderable diftance ; fhowcr:: cf milk were only caufed by fome quality in the air condenfing, and giving a whitifh colour to the water ; and thofe of blood are now well known to be only the red fpots left upon the earth, on ftones and the leaves of trees, by the butterflies which hatch in hot or ftormy weather (4).
III. OF MAGIC.
JViAGIC, or the pretended art of producing, by
the aiTiftance of words and ceremonies, fuch events
as are above he natural power of man, was of feveral kinds, and chiefly coniifted in invoking the good and benevolent, or the wicked and mifchievous fpirits. The firft, which wa*^ called Theurgia, was adopted
by the wifeft of the Pagan world, who efteemed this
ij much as they defpifed the latter, which they called iioetia. Theurgia was, by the philofophers, accounted

counted a divine art, Avhich only ferved to raife the mind to higher perfection, and to exalt the foul to a
greater degree of purity ; and they, who by means of this kind of magic, were imagined to arrive at what was called intuition, v\'herein they enjoyed an intimate intercourfe with the deity, were believed to be inverted with their powers ; fo that it was imagined, that nothing was impoflible for them to perform. All who made profeflion of this kind of magic
afpired to this ftate of perfection. The prieft, who
was of this order, was to be a man of unblemifhed morals, and all who joined with him were bound to a ftridt purity of life ; they were to abftain from women, and from animal food ; and were forbid to
defile themfelves by the touch of a dead body. Nothing was to be forgot in their rites and ceremonies ; the leaft omifiion or miftake, rendered all their art inefFe(f^ual ; fo that this was a conftant excufe for their not performing all that was required of them, though as their fole employment (after having arrived to a certain degree of perfedion, by falling, prayer, hnd the other methods of purification) was the ftudy of univerfal nature ; they might gain fiich an infight into phyfical caufes, as might enable them to perform avStions, that might fill the ignoi-ant vulgar with amazement. And it is hardly to be doubted, but
that this was all the knowledge that many of them ever afpifcd after. In this fort of magic, Hermes, Trifmegiftus and Zoroafter excelled ; and indeed it gained great reputation amongil the Egyptians, Chaldeans, Perlians, and Indians. In times of ignorance, a piece of clock-work, or fom.e curious machine, was lufficient to entitle the inventor to the works of magic ; and fome have even aflerted, that the Egyptian magic, that has been rendered fo famous by the writings of the ancients, confifted only in difcoveries dr2.wn from the mathematics and natural philofophy, fince thofe Greek philofophers who travelled into Egypt in order to obtain a knowledge of their fciences, returned with only a knoAvledge of nature and religion, and fome rational ideas of then* ancient fymbols. But it can hardly be doubted, but that magic in its grolTeft and moft ridiculous fenfc was pradtifed in Egypt, at leaft amongft fome of the vulgar, long before Pythagoras or Empedoclee travelled into that country.
Tbe



J234 APPENDIX.
The Egyptians had been very early aecuftomed to vary the fignification of their fymbols^ by adding to them feveral plants, ears of corn, or blades of grafs, to exprefs the different employments of hufbandry ; but underftanding no longer their meaning, nor the words that had been made ufe of on thefe occafions, which were equally unintelligible, the vulgar might miftake thefe for fo many myfterious pradices obferved by their fathers ; and hence they might conceive the notion, that a conjunction of plants, even without being made ufe of as a remedy, might be of efficacy to preferve or procuie health. *' Of thefe, fays the ** Abbe Pluche, they made a colledtion, as an art by
" which they pretended to procure the bleflings, and ** provide againft the evils of life." By the afliftance of thete, m.en even attempted to hurt their enemies^ and indeed the knowledge of poifonous or ufeful fimples might, on particular occafions, give fuflicient weight to their empty curfes or invocations. But thefe magic incantadons, fo contrary to humanity^ were detefted and punifnedby almoft ail nations, nor could they be tolerated in any. Pliny, after mentioning an herb, the throwing of v.'hich into an army, it was laid, was fuflicient to put it to the rout, afki, where was this herb when Rome Avas i^o diftfeffcd by tJie Cimbri and Teutones ? VVliy did not the Perfians make u^^ of it when Lucullufe cut their troops in pieces ? But amongft all the incantations o^ magic, the mofl folemn, as \vt\\ as the moft frequent, v/as that of calling up the fpirits of the dead ; this indeed was the quintefTence of their art ; and the reader canaot be difpleafed to find this myf^ery unravelled.
An afTecftion for the body of a perfon, who in his life-time was beloved, induced the firft nations to inter the dead in a decent manner ; and to add to this melancholy infbance of their efreem, thofe wiflies which had a particular regard to their new ftate of exiftence, the place of burial, conformable to the cuftom of characfterizing all beloved places, or thofe diftinguifhed by a memorable event, was pointed out
by a large ftone or pillar raifed upon it. To this place families, and when the concern was general, multitudes repaired every year, where, upon this ftone, were made libations of wine, oil, honey, and
flour ; and here they facrificed and eat in common, ha\ing



A P P E N D r X. 2:^3
having firft made a trench, in which they burnt the entrails of the vidim, and into which the libation and the blood was made to flow. They began with thanking God for having given them life, and providing
their neceflary food ; and then praifed him for the good examples they had been favoured with. From ihefe melancholy rites were baniflied all licentioufnefs and levity ; and while other cuftoms changed, thefe continued the fame. They roafted the flefli of the vicT:im they had offered, and eat it in common, difcoiirfing on the virtues of him they came to lament. All other feafts were diftinguilhed by names fuitable to the ceremonies that attended them. Thefe funeral meetings were fimply called the Manes, that is, the aflcmbly. Thus the manes and the dead were words that became fynonymous. In thefe meetings, they imagined tJiat they renewed their alliance wiih the deceafed, who, they fuppofed, had flill a regard for the concerns of their country and family, and who, cis affedionate fpirits, could do no iefs than inform them of whatever v.-as nectfiary for them to know. Thus the funerals of the dead were at laft converted into methods of divination, and an innocent inftitution into one of the grolTeft pieces of folly and fuperllition. But they did not ftop here ; they grew fo extravagantly credulous, as to believe that the phantom drank t'le libations tliat had been poured fortb, wl-ile the relations vvere feailing on the reft of the facrifice round the pit ; and from hence became apprehenfive left the reft of the dead iliould promifcuoufly throng about
this fpot to g<.t a ihare in the repaft' they wc c fuppofed to be fo fond of, and leave nothing for the dear
fi^int for whom the fcaft was intended. I'hey then
made two pits or ditches, into one of which they put wine, honey, u*ater, and flour, to employ the generality of the dead ; and in the other they poured the blood of the vidlim ; when fitting down on the brink, they kept off, by the light of their fv/orcls, the crowd
of dead who had no concern in their affairs, v/hile
they called him by name, whom they had a mind to chear and confult, and defircd him to draw near((;).
The
(5) Homer gives the fame account of thefe ceremonies, when Ulyfles raifes the foul of Tirefias ; and the fame ufages are found in the poem of Silius Italicus. And to thefe ceremonies tiie fcriptures /vequently allude, when the Ifraelitcs are forbid to aflemble upon high places.



136 APPENDIX.
TIk- qiieftions made by the living were very intelligible ; but the anfwers of the dead were not fo ealily undcrftood, and therefore the priefts and magicians made it their bufincfs to explain them. They retired into deep caves, where the darknefs and filence refembled the ftate of death, and there fafted and lay upon the Ikins of the beafts they had facrificed, and then gave for anfwer the dream which moft affeded them ; or opened certain books appointed for that purpofe, and gave the firft lentence that offered. At other times the prieft, or any pcrfon who came to confalt, took care, at his going out of the cave, tohften to the firft words he fnouid hear, and thcfe were to be his anfwer. And though they had no relation to the bufinefs in hand, they were turned fo many ways, and their fj ifc fo violently wrefted, that they made them ngnify almoft any thing they pleafed. At other times they had recourfe to a nuiriber of tickets, on v/hich v/ere fgrne words or vcrfes, and thcfe being thrown into an urn, the firft that v\-as taken out was delivered to the familv.
IV. OF AUGURV.
A HE fupcrftitiousfondriefsof mankind, for feirching into futurity, has given rife to a vaft variety of follies, all equally weak and extravagant. The Romans, in particular, found out almoft innumerable ways of divination, all nature had a voice, and the moft fenfelefs beings, and moft triiling accidents,, became prefages of future events. This introduced ceremonies, founded on a miftaken knowledge of antiquity, that were the moft childifli and ridiculous, and which yet were performed with an air of folemnity. Birds, on account of their fwiftnefj in flying, were fometimes conlidered by the Egyptians as the fymbols of the winds ; and figures of particular fpecies of fowl, were fet up to denote the time when the near approach of a periodical wind was expected. From hence, before they undertook any thing of confequence, as fowing, planting, or putting out to fea, it was ufiial for them to fay (6), Let us ccnjnh the b'lrdsy meaning

APPENDIX. in
meaning the figns fixed up to give them the neceffary
informations they then flood in need of. By doing
this, they knew how to regulate their conduA ;
and it frequently happened, that when this precaution was omitted, they had reafon to reproach
themfelves for their neglect. From hence, mankind miftaking their meaning, and retaining the phrafe, Ltt us confidt the b'ndsy and perhaps hearing old fiories repeated of the advantages fuch and fuch perfons had received, by confulting them in a critical m.oment, when the periodical wind would have ruined their affairs, they began to conceive an opinion, that the fowls which {kim through the air were fomanymeffengers fent from the gods, to inforrn them of future events, and to M-arn them againft any difaftt rous un* dertaking. From hence they took notice of their flight, and from their different manner of flying prognofti
cated good or bad omens. The birds were inftantly
grown wonderous wife, and an owl, who hates the
light, could not pafs by the window of a fick perfon in the nighty where he was offended by the light of a lamp or a candle, but his hooting mufl be confidered
as prophefying, that the life of the poor man was nearly at an end. The place where thefe auguries were taken, amongft the Romans, was commonly upon an eminence ; they were prohibited after the month of Augufl, Ifecaule that was the time for the moulting of birds ; nor were they permitted on the wane of the moon, nor at any time in the afternoon, or when the air was the leafl difturbed by winds or clouds.
When all the previous ceremonies vrere performed, the augur, cloathed in his robe, and holding his augural ilaff in his right-hand, fat down at the door of his tent, looked round him, then marked out the divifions of the heavens with his ftaff, drev/ a line from eaft to VN'cfl, and anothev from north to fouth, and
then oHered up his facrifice. A fhort prayer, the form
of which may be fufSciently feen, in that offered to Jupiter, at the eledion of ISTuma Pompilius, which
was as follows : " O father Jupiter, if it by they will,
*' that this Numa Pcmpilins, on v,hofe head I have
** laid my hand, fliovlci be king of Rome, grant that
" there be clear .ir.d unerring figns, within the bounds ** I have defcribed." The prayer being thus ended, the priefc turned to the right and left, and to v.-hatever

ever point the birds direded their flight, in order to determine from thence, whether the god approved or rejected the choice. The veneration which the Romans entertained for this ceremonial of their religion, made them attend the refult of the augury with the moft profound filence, and the affair was no fooner determined, than the augur reported his decifion, by faying. The birds approve, or the birds difappro've it. However, notwitliftanding the augury might be favourable, the enterprife was fometimes deferred, till they fancied it confirmed by a new lign. But of all the figns which happened in the air, the mofb infallible was that of thunder and lightning, efpecially if it happened to be fair weather. If it came on the right-hand it was a bad omen, but if on the left a good one ; becaufe, according to Donatus, all appearances on that fide were fuppofed to proceed from the right hand of the gods. Let us now take a view of the facred chickens ; for an examination into the manner of their taking the corn that Avas offered them, was the moft
common method of taking the augury. And indeed the Romans had fuch faith in the myfteries contained in their manner of feeding, that they hardly ever undertook any important affair without firft advifing with them. Generals fent for them to the field, and confulted them before they ventured to engage the enemy; and if the omen was unfavourable, they immediately defifted from their enterprize. The facred chickens were kept in a coop or pen, and entrufted to the care of a perfon, who, on account of his office, v/as called PuUarius. I'he augur, after having commanded filence, ordered the pen to be opened, and threw upon the ground a handful of corn. If the chickens inftantly leaped out of the pen, a-nd pecked up the corn with fuch eagernefs as to let fome of it fall from their beaks, the augury was called Tripudium, or Tiipudium Soliftimum, from its itriking the •earth, and was efleemed a molt aufpicious omen ; =but if they did not immediately run to the corn, if i;hey flew away, if they walked by it without minding it, or if they fcattered it abroad with their wings, it portended danger and ill fuccefs. Thus the fate of the gre.iteit undertaking, and even the fall of cities ^nd kingdoms, was thought to depend on the appetite of a few chickens. Obfervations

Cbfervations were alfo taken from the chattering, (tnging, or hooting ot crows, pies, owls, &c. and from the running of beafts, as he'.feis, alles, rams, hares, wolves, foxes, weefels, and mice, when they appeared in uncommon places, crofied the way, or run to the right or left, ccc. They alfo pretended to
draw a good or bad omen from the moft common and trifling adions or occurrences of life, as fneezing, Humbling, ftarting, the numbnefs of the little finger, the tingling of the ear, the fpilling of fait upon the table, or wine upon one's cloaths, the accidental meeting of a bitch with whelp, &c. It was alio the bufmefs of the augur to interpret dreams, oracles, and prodigies.
The college of augurs, at firft inftitutcd at Rome by Romulus, was only compofed of three perfons, taken fiom the three tribes, into which all the inhabitants of the city were divided ; but leveral others were afterwards added, and at laft, according to a regulation of Scylla, this college confifted of fifteen

The greateft precautions were indeed taken in this eledion ; for as they were inycfted with fuch extraordinary privikges, none were quaUfied but perfons of a blamelefs life, and free from all perfonal defeds. The fenate could affemble in no place but what they had confecrated. They frequently occafioned the difplacing of magiftrates, and the deferring of public aflemblies. ** But the fenate, ** at laft, ccnfidering that fuch an unlimited power *' was capable of authorifing a number of abufes,

and the other arts of divination ; but when the gg' nerals mifcarried in any enterprize, the people laid the whole blame on the heedleflnefs with which they had been confulted ; and if he had entirely negleded confulting them, all the blame was thrown upon him
who had preferred his own forecaft to that of the
fowls ; while thofe who made thefe kinds of predictions a fubjecft of raillery, were accounted impious and piophane. Thus they conftrued, as a punifhment from the gods, the defeat of Claudius Pulcher, who, when the facred chickens refufed to eat what was fet before them, ordered them to be thrown into the fea : If tkey cwon't eat, faid he, they Jhall drink.
V. OF THE AUSPICES*
.1 N the moft early ages of the world, a fenfe of
piety, and a regard to decency, had introduced a cuftom of never facrificing to him, who gave them all their blelfings, any but the foundcft, the moft fat and beautiful victims. They were examined with the clofeft and moft exaft attention. This ceremonial, w^hich doubtlefs fprang at firft from gratitude, and fome natural ideas of fitnefs and propriety, at laft degenerated into trifling niceties and fuperftitious ce
remonies. And it having been once imagined, that nothing was to be expected from the gods, v/hen the victim was imperfedt, the idea of perfe<5lion was united with abundance of trivial circumftances. The entrails were examined with peculiar care, and if the whole was without blemiih, their duties were fulfilled ; and under an afTurance that they had engaged the gods to be on their fide, they engaged in war, and in the nroft hazardous undertakings, with fuch a confidence of fuccefs, as had the greateft tendency to procure it. All the motions of the vi(5lim that was led to the altar became fo many prophecies. If he advanced with an eafy air in a ftraight line, and without offering refiftance ; if he made no extraordinary bellowing when he received the blow ; if he did not get loofe from the perfon that led him to the flaughter, it was
a prognoftic of an eafy and Howing fuccefs.
Th^

The vidim was knocked down, but before its belly was ripped open, one of the I6bes of the liver
was allotted to thofe who offered the facrifice, and
the other to the enemies of the ftate. That which was neither blcmifhed nor withered, of a bright red, and neither larger nor fmaller than it ought to be,
prognofticated great profperity to thofe for whom it was fet apart ; that which was livid, fmall, or corrupted, prefaged the moft. fatal mifchiefa. The next thing to be confulered was the heart, which was alfo examined With the iitmoft care, as was the fpleen, the gall, and the lungs ; and if any of thefe were let fall, if they fmelt rank, or were bloated, livid or withered, it prefaged nothing but misfortunes. After they had finiflied their examination of the entrails, the fire was kindled, and from this alfo they drew feveral prefages. If the flame was clear, if it mounted up without dividing, and went not out till the victim was entirely confumed, this was a proof that the faci-ifice was accepted ; but if they found it difficult to kindle the fire, if the flame divided, if it played around, inftead of taking hold of the vidim, If it burnt ill, or went out, it was a bad omen. At Rome, the aufpices were always chofen from the beft families, and as their employment was of the fame nature as the augurs, they were as much ho
noured. It was a very common thing indeed to fee their predi(5lions verified by the event, efpecially in their wars ; nor is this at all wonderful, the prediction never lulled them into fecurity, or prevented their taking every neceffary precaution ; but, on the contrary, the affurance of victory infpired that intrepidity and high courage, which in the common foldiers was the principal thing neceffary to the attainment of it. But, if, after the appearance of a com
plete favour from the gods, whom they had addreffed, their affairs happened to mifc?.rry, the blame was laid on fome other deity. Juno or Minerva had been
negleded. They facrificcd to them, recovered their fpirits, and behaved with greater precaution. However, the bufinefs of the aufpices was not reftrained to the altars and facrifices, they had an equal right to explain all other portents. The fenate frequently confulted them on the melt CKtraordinary prodigies. M " The

VI. OF ORACLES.
Of all the nations upon earth, Greece was the
moft famous for oracles, and fome of their wifeft
men have endeavoured to vindicate them upon folid principles, and refined reafonings. Xenophon expatiates on the neceffity of confulting the gods by au
gurs and oracles. He reprefents man as naturally ignorant of what is advantageous or deftructive to himfelf ; that he is fo far from being able to penetrate into the future, that the prefent itfelf efcapes him ;
that his defigns may be fruftrated by the flighteft ob
jects ; that the deity alone, to whom all ages are prefent, can impart to him the infallible knowledge of futurity ; that no other being can give fucce/s to his enterprizes, and that it is highly reafonable to believe that he will guide and protedt thofe who adore
him with a pure afiedion, who call upon him, and confult him with a fincere and humble reflgnation.
How furprifing it is that fuch refined and nobleprinciples ihould be brought to defend the moft puerile and abfurd opinions ! For what arguments can vindicate
(9) Kennet's Roman Antiq. lib. II. c. 4.
(l) Romulus, who founded the inftitution of the aufpices,
borrowed it from the Tufcans, to whom the fenate afterward* fent twelve of the fons of the principal nobility to be inftruAcd in thcfe myfteries, and the other ceremonies of their religion. The origin of this art amongft tlie people of Tufcany, is re
lated by Cicero, in the following Tnanner : " A peafant (fays *' he) ploughing in the field, his ploughihare running pretty ** deep in the earth, turned up a clod, from whence fprung a « child, who taught him and the other Tufcans the art of di** vination." See Cicero de Div, 1. 2. This fable undoubtedly means no more, than that this child, faid to fpring from a clod of earth, was a youth of a very mean and obfcure birth, and that from him theTafcans learnt tliis method of divination. But it is not known whether he was the author of it, or whether he leiunt it of th- Greeks or other nations.

vindicate their prefuming to interrogate the moftHigh, and oblige him to give anfwers concerning etery idle imagination and unjuft enterprize ? Oracles were thought by the Greeks to proceed in
a more immediate manner from God than the other arts of divination ; and on this account fcarce any peace w^as conclutled, any war engaged in, any new laws ena(^ted, or any new form of government infti
tutecl without confuting oracles. And therefore Minos, to give his laws a proper weight with the people, afcribed to them a divine fan<5cion, and pre
tended to receive from Jupiter inftrudlions how to
new model his government. And Lycurgus made frequent vifits to the Delphian oracle, that the people might entertain a belief, that he received from Apollo the platform which he afterwards communicated to the Spartans. Thefe pious frauds were an effedlual means of eftablifhing the authority of laws, and engaging the people to a compliance with the will of the law-giver. Perfons thus infpired were frequently thought worthy of the higheft truft ; fo that tht were fometimes advanced to regal power, from
perfualion, " that as they were admitted to the coun
*' wh of the gods, they were beft able to provide for
" the fafety and welfare of man (l)." This high veneration for the priefts of the oracles, being the ftrongeft confirmation, that their credit
was thoroughly eftabliflied, they fuffered none to
confult the gods but thofe who brought facrifices and
rich prefents to them ; whence few, befides the
great, were admitted. This proceeding fcrved at once to enrich the priefts, and to raife the chara(fter
of the oracles amongit the populace, who are always
apt to defpife what they are too familiarly acquainted
with ; nor were the rich, cr even the greateft prince admitted, except at thofe particular times when the
god was in a difpofition to be confulted. One of the moft ancient oracles, of which we have
received any particular account, was that of Jupiter
at Dodona, a city faid to be built by Deucalion,
after that famous deluge which bears his name, and
which deftroyed the greateft part of Greece. It was
fituated in Epirus, and here was the firft temple that
ever v/as feen in Greece. According to Herodotus,
both this and the oracle of Jupiter Hammon had the

fame original, and both owed their inftitution to the
Egyptians. The rife of this oracle is indeed wrapped
lip in fable. Tvo black pigeons, fay they, flying from Thebes, in Egypt, one of them fettled in Lybia, and the other flew as far as the foreft of Dodona, a province in Epirus, where fitting in an oak, flie informed the inhabitants of the country, that it was the will of Jupiter that an oracle fliould be founded in that place. Herodotus gives two accounts of the rife of this oracle, ont of which clears up the myftery of this fable. He tells us, thai he was informed by the priefts of Jupiter, at Thebes, in Egypt, that fome Phoenician merchants carried otf two prieftefles of Thebes, that one was carried into Greece, and
the other into Lybia. She who was carried into Greece, took up her refidence in the foreft of Dodona, and tiiere at the foot of an oak, erected a fraall chapel in honour of Jupiter, whofe prieftefs ihc had been at Thebes (.0.
We learn from Servius (4), that the will of heaven
m.s here explained by an old woman, who pretended
to find out a meaning to explain the murmurs of a brook that flowed from the foot of the oak. After
this, another method was taken, attended with more formalities ; brazen kettles were fufpended in the air, with a ftatue of the fame metal, with a whip in
his hand (5): this figure, when moved by the wind^
ftruck againft the kettle that was next it, which alfo caufing all the other kettles to ftrike againft each other, raifed a clat<-ering din, which continued for fome time, and from thefe founds fhe formed her predidlions. Both thefe ways were equally abfurd, for as in each the anfwer depended folely on the invention of
the prieftefs, flie alone was the oracle. Suidas in

Forms us, that the anfwer was given by an oak in this
grove, as Homer alfo ha« delivered (6) ; and as it was generally believed to proceed from the trunk, it is eafy to conceive how this was performed : for the prieflefs had nothing more to do than to hide herfelf in the hollov^ of an old oak, and from thence to give the pretended fenfe of the oracle, which fhe might
the more eafily do, as the diftance the fuppliant was obliged to keep, v/as an effedual means to prevent the cheat from being difcovered. There is one remarkable circumftance relating to this oracle yet remaining, and that is, that while all
the other nations received their anfwer from a woman,, the Boeotians alone received it from a man, and th-<: reaibn given for it is as follows : During the war between the Thracians and Boeotians, the latter
fcnt deputies to confult this oracle of Dodona, when the pricftefs gave them this anfwer, of which fhe doublkfs did not forefee the confequence : If you ivculd meet '^lit.b fuccfsy you ynujl be guilty offame impious aBi:n.

The two remaining prieflefTes, (for, according to Strabo, the oracle at that time had ufually three)' highly exafperated at this cruelty, caufedthem to be feized, and as they v/ere to be their judges, the deputies pleaded the illegality of their being tried by women. The juflice of this plea was ad
mitted by the people, who allowed two priefts to
try them in conjundtion with the prieftelTes ; on which, being acquitted by the former, and condemned by the latter, the votes being equal, they were releafed. For this reafon the Bceotians, for the future, received their anfwers from the priefts.

24^ APPENDIX.
The oracle of Jupiter Hammon, in Lybia, we
have already faid, was derived from Egypt, and is of the fame antiquity as the former of Dodona, and,
though furrounded by a large tra<5t of burning lands,
was extremely famous. This oracle gave his anfwers
not by words, but by a fign. What was called the
image of the god, was carried about in a gilded barge on the fhoulders of his priefts, who moved whitherfocver they pretended the divine impulfe diredted them. This appears to have been nothing
more than the mariners compafs (7), the ufe of which
was not entirely unknown to that age, though fo long kept a fecret from the Europeans. It was adorned with precious ftones, and the barge with
many filver goblets hanging on either fide : and thefe proceflions were accompanied with a troop of matrons and virgins finging hymns in honour of Jupiter. Thefe priefts refufed the bribes offered them by Ly
fander, who wanted their affiftance to help him to change the fucceifion to the throne of Sparta. However, they vvtie not fo fciupulous when Alexander, eltner to gratify his vanity, or to icreen the reputation of his mother, took that painful march through the deferts of Lybia, in order to obtain the honour of being calied the fon of Jupiter ; a prieft ftood ready to receive bim, and faluted him with the title of fon of the king of gods.
The Oracle of Apollo at Dejphos, was one of the moft famous in all antiquity. This city ftood upon a declivity about the middle of mount Parnaffus : it was built on a fmall extent of even ground, and furrounded with precipices, that fortified it without the help of art (8). Diodoius Sicuiiis relates (9) a tradition of a very whimfical nature, which was faid to give rife to this oracle. There was a hole in one of the vallies, at the foot of Parnaffus, the mouth of which was very ftrait : the goats that were feeding at no great diftance, coming near it, began to ikip and frilk about in fuch a manner, that the goat-herd, being ftruck with furprize, came up to the place, and leaning over it, was feized with fuch an enthuiiaftic

aftic impulfe, or temporary madneft, as prompted
him to utter fome extravagant expreflions, which
pafled for prophecies. The report of this extraordinary event drev^' thither the neighbouring people, who, on approaching the hole, were fcized with the
fame tranfports. Surprifed at fo aftoniihing a pro*
digy, the cavity was no longer approached without
reverence. The exhalation was concluded to have
fomething divine in it ; they imagined it proceeded from fome friendly deity, and from that time beftowcd a particular worfh?p on the divinity of the place, and regarded what was delivered in" thofe fits of madntfs as predidions ; and here they afterwards built the city and temple of Delphos. This oracle, it w-as pretended, had been poffefTed by feverai fuccelfive deities, and at laft by Apollo, who raifed its reputation to the greatcft height. It
rvas reforted to by ]>erfons of all Nations, by which it obtained immenfe riches, which expofed it to be frequently plundered. At hrft it is faid the god in
fpired nil indifl'erently who approached the cavern ; but fome having in this fit of iiiadnefs thrown themfelves into the gulf, they thought fit to choofe a prieffefa, and to^fct ov<:'r the hole a tripos, or threelegged Itool, Avhence Die might without danger catch the exh,llatio^^ : and this prieitefs was called Pythia, from the fe/pent Python, flain by Apollo. For a long time none but virgins pofleHed this honour, till a young Thefialian, called F.checrates, falling in love with the prieftefs, v ho was at that time very beautiful, raviflied her ; when, to prevent any abufes of the like kind for the future, the citizens made a law to
prohibit any woman being ciiofen under fifty years old. At firft they had only one prieftefs, but afterwards they had two or three. The oracles were not delivered every day, but the facrifices were repeated till the god was pleafed to deliver them, which frequently happened only one day in the year. Alexander coming here in one of thefe intervals, after many intreaties to engage the prieftefs to mount the tripod, which were all to no. purpofe, the prince growing impatient at herrefufal, drew her by force from her cell, and was leading her
to the fanduary, when faying. My fort tbou art inviTi' cibU, he cried out, that he was fatisfied, and needed no other anfwer. Nothing



248 APPENDIX.
Nothing was wanting to keep up the air of myftc" ry, in order to prefcrve its reputation, and to procure
it veneration. The neglecfting the fmalleft pundilio was fufficient to make them renev/ the facrifices that Vere to precede the refponfe of Apollo. The prieftefs herfelf was obliged to prepare for the difcharge of her duty, by falling three days, bathing in the fountain of Caftalia, drinking a certain quantity of the water, and chewing fome leaves of laurel gathered near the fountain. After thefc preparations the temple was made to fhake, which paflcd for the fignal given by x\pollo, to inform them of his arrival, and then the priefts led her into the fan<fuiary and placed her on the tripod, when beginning to be agitated by the divine vapour, her hair ftood an end, her looks became wild, her mouth began to foam, and a fit of trembling felzed her whole body. In this condition file feemed to ftruggle to get loofe from the
priefts, who pretended to hold her by force, while her Ihrieks and howiings, which refounded through the temfile, filled the deluded by-ftanders with a kind of facred horror. At lull, being no longer able to refift the impu'fes of the god, Ihc fubmitted, and at certain intei v?d3 uttered fome unconnected words,
which were carefully picked up by the priefls, who put them in connection, and gave them to the poets,
who were alfo prefcnt to put them into a kind of verfe, which was frequently ftiii, unharmonious, and always obfcure ; this occafioned that piece of raillery, that Apollo, the prince of the mufes, was the worft
of the poets. One of the pricftefies, who was called Phcmonbe, is faid to have pronounced her oracles in verfe : in latter times they were contented with delivering them in profe, and this, in the opinion of Plutarch, was one of the reafons of the decienfion of this oracle. Croefus intending to make trial of the feveral oracles of Greece, as well as that of Lybia, commanded the refpedtive ambafladors to confult them ail on a ftated day, and to bring the refponfes in writing.
The queftion propofed was, " What is Croefus, the
" fon of Alyattes, king of Lydia, now doing ?'* The reft of the oracles failed ; but the Delphian an
fwered truly, that " He was boiling a lamb and a ** tortoife together in a brazen pot. This gained his confidence and a profufion of the richeft offerings. In



APPENDIX. 249
In return, the oracle, on the next enquiry, informed
him, that " By making war upon the Perfians, he
fliould deftroy a great empire.'* The event is well
known. This vain confidence loft him both his crown and liberty ( I ).
Trophonius, who, according to fome authors, was no more than a robber, or at moft a hero, had an oracle in Boeotia, which acquired great reputation. Paufanias, who had confulted it, and gone through all its formalities, has given a very particular defcription of it,, and from him we fliall extrad a Ihort hiftory of this oracle. The facred grove of Trophonius, fays this author,
(z), is at a fmall diftance from Lebadea, one of the fineft cities in Greece ; and in this grove is the temple of Trophonius, with his ftatue, th« workmanfhip of
Praxiteles. Thofe who apply to this oracle muft perform certain ceremonies before they are permitted to go down into the cave where the refponfe is given. Some days muft be fpent in a chapel dedicated to
Fortune and the Good Genii, where the purification confifts in abftinence from all things unlawful, and in making ufe of the cold bath. He mufc facrifice to Trophonius and all his family, to Jupiter, to Saturn,
and to- Ceres, firhamed Europa, who was believed to
have been the nurfe of Trophonius. The diviners confulted the entrails of every victim, to difcover if it was agreeable to Trophonius that the perfon fhould defcend into the cave. If the omens were favourable, he was led that night to the river Hercyna, where two boys anointed his body with oil Then he was €onduded as far as the fource of the river, where he was obliged to drink two forts of water, that of Lethe, to efface from his mind all profane thoughts, and that of Mnemofyne, to enable him to retain whatever he was to fee in the facred cave ; he was then prcfented to the ftatue of Trophonius, to which he was to addrefs a fhort prayer ; be then was cloathed in a linen tunic adorned with facred fillets ; and at laft was condudled in a folemn manner to the oracle, which was inclofed within a ftone wall on the top of a mountain.

In this inclofure was a cave formed like an oven, the mouth of which was narrow, and the defcent to it not by fleps, but by a fhort ladder : on going down there appeared another cave, the entrance to which was very ftrait. The fuppliant, who was obliged to take a certain compofition of honey in each hand, without which he could not be admitted, proftrated himfelf on the ground, and then putting his feet into the mouth of the cave, his whole body was forcibly drawn in. Here fome had the knowledge of futurity by vifion ;
and others by an audible voice. They then got out of the cave in the fame manner as they went in, with their feet foremoft, and proftrate on the earth. The fuppliant going up the ladder was conducted to the chair of Mnemofyne, the goddefs of memory, in which being feated, he was queftioncd on what he had heard and feen ; and from thence he was brought into the chapel of the Good Genii, where having ftaid till he had recovered from his affright and terror, he was obliged to write in a book all that he had feen or heard, which the priefts took upon them to interpret. There never was but one man, fays Paufanias, who loft
his life in this cave, and that was a fpy who had been fent by Demetrius, to fee whether in that holy place
there was anything worth plundering. The body of this man was afterwards found at a great diftance ; and indeed it is not unlikely, that this defign being
difcovered, he was aflaflinated by the priefts, who might carry out his body by fome ftcret pafiage, at which they went in and out without being perceived. The oracle of the Branchidae, in the neighbourhood of Miletus, was very ancient, and in great efteem. Xerxes returning from Greece, prevailed on its priefts to deliver up its treafures to him, and then burnt the temple, when to fecure them againft the vengeance of the Greeks, he granted them an eftablifliment in the moft diftant part of Alia. After the defeat of Darius
by Alexander, this conqueror deftroyed the city where thcfe priefts had fettled, of which their defcendants were then in adual poffeflion ; and thus punilhed the children for the perfidy of their fathers.
The oracle of Apollo at Claros, a town of Ionia,
in Afia Minor, was very famous, and frequently confulted.

fulted. Claros was faid to be founded by (3) Manto, the daughter of Tirofias, fome years before the taking of Troy. The anfwers of this oracle, fays Tacitus (4),
were not given by a woman, but by a man, chofe out of certain families, and generally from Miletus. It
was fufficient to let him know the number and names
of thofe who came to confult him ; after which he retired into a cave, and having drank of the waters of a fpring that ran within it, delivered anfwers in verfe upon what the people had in their thoughts, tho* he was frequently ignorant, and unacquainted with the
nature and rules of poetry. " It is faid (our author
" adds) that he foretold the fudden death of Ger** manicus, but in dark and ambiguous terms." Paufanias mentions an oracle of Mercury, in Achaia, of a very fingular kind. After a variety of ceremonies, which it is needlefs here to repeat, they whifpered in the ear of the god, and told him, what they were defirous of knowing ; then ftopping their cars with their hands, they left the temple, and the firft words they heard after they were out of it, was the anfwer of the god. But it would be an endlefs tafk to pretend to enumerate all the oracles, which were fo numerous, that Van Dale gives a lift of near three hundred, moft of which weve in Greece. But no part of Greece had fo many oracles as Boeotia, which were there numerous, from its abounding in mountains and caverns ; for, as Mr. Fonteneile obferves, nothing was more convenient for the priefts than thefe caves, which not only infpired the people with a fort of religious horror, but afforded the priefts an opportunity of forming fecret paflages, of concealing themfelves in hollow ftatues, and of making ufc of all the machines and all the arts neceflary to keep up the delulion of the people, and to increafe the reputation of the oracles. Nothing
(3) Manto has been greatly extolled for her prophetic fpirit ; and fabulous hiftory informs us, that lamenting the rtiiferies of her country, Ihe diflolved away in tears, and that thefe formed a fountain, the water of which communicated the gift of prophecy to thofe who drank it, but being at the fame time unwholcfome, it brought on diftafcs, and fhortened life.

Nothing is more remarkable than the different manners by which the fenfe of the oracles w^s conveyed ; befides the methods already mentioned, in fome the oracle was given from the bottom of the ftatue, to which one of the priefts might convey himfelf by a fubterranean paflage ; in others by dreams ; in others again by lots, in the manner of dice, containing certain charaders or words, which were to be explained by tables made for that purpofe. In fome temples the enquirer threw them himfelf, and in others they were dropped from a box ; and from hence arofe the
proverbial phrafe, The >jt is fallen. Childilli as this method of deciding the fuccefs of events by a throw
of dice may appear, yet it was always preceded by facrifices and other ceremonies. In others the queftion was propofed by a letter, fealed up, and given to the prieft, or left upon the altar, while the perfon fent with it was obliged to lie all night in the temple, and thefe letters were to be fent back unopened with the anfwer. Here this wonderful art confifted in the priefts knowing how to open a letter without injuring the feal, an art Hill pradlifed, on particular occaiions, in all the general
poft-offices in Europe. A governor of Cilicia, whom the Epicureans endeavoured to infpire with a contempt for the oracles, fent a fpy to that of Mopfus at Mallos, with a letter well fealed up ; as this man was lying in the temple, a perfon appeared to him and uttered the word Black, This anfwer he carried to the governor, which filled him with aftonifiiment, though it appeared ridiculous to the Epicureans, to
whom he communicated it, when to convince them of the injuftice of the raillery on the oracle, he broke open the letter, and fhewed them that he had wrote thefe words, Shall I facrifice to thee a <wbtte ox or a black? The emperor Trajan m.ade a like experiment on the gcd at Heliopolis, by fending him a letter
fealed up, to v/hich he requefted an anfwer. The oracle commanded a blank paper, well folded and fealed, to be given to the emperor, who, upon his receiving it, was ftruck with admirarion at feeing an
anfwer fo correfpondent to his own letter, in v/hich he had v/rcte nothing. The general chara<Seriftic of oracles, fayr, the juftly admired lloilin (3}, were ambiguity, or)fcurity, and convtrtability ; (5) Ancient Hill. vol. j. p. aj.

•convertability ; fo that one anfwcr would zigree with feveral different and even oppofite events ; and this was generally the cafe when the event was in the leaft dubious. Trajan, convinced of the divinity of the oracle, by the blank letter above mentioned, fent a fecond note, wherein he defired to know, whether
he fliould return to Rome after the conclufion of the war which he had then in view ; the oracle anfwered this letter by fending to him a vine broke in pieces. The predi<5tion of the oracle was certainly fulfilled} for the emperor dying in the v^^ar, his body, or, if you pleafe, his bones, reprefented by the broken vine* were carried to Rome. But it would have been equally accomplif])ed had the Romans conquered the Parthians, or the Parthians the Romans : and whatever had been the event, it might have been conftruded into the meaning of the oracle. Under fuch ambiguities they eluded all difficulties, and were hardly ever in the wrong. In this all their art, and all their luperior knowledge confifted ; for when the queftion
was plain, the anfwer was commonly fo too. A man
requefting a cure for the gout, was anfwered by the oracle, that he fhould drink nothing but cold water.
Another defiring to know by what means he might become rich, was anfwered by the god, that he had
no more to do but to make himftlf mafter of all between Sicyon and Corinth (6).
VII. OF ALTARS, OPEN TEMPLES, SACKED GROVES,
AND SACRIFICES.
Altars and facrifices mutually imply each other,
and were immediately confequent to the fall of man : though the original altars were fimple, being compofed of earth or turf, or unhewn ftones. There is great probability that the cloathing of our firft parents
conlifted of the Ikins of beafts facrificed by Adam in the interval between his ofitnce and expulfion from
paradife. Cain and Abel, Noah and the patriarchs, purfued the pradice. Even thofe who forfock the living God, yet continued this early method of worfhip. Thefe idolaters at firft imitated the fimple #fianner in which they had bciii raifed by Noah. But the

the form and materials infenlibly changed ; there were fome fquare, others long, round, or triangular. Each feaft obtained a peculiar ceremonial, and an altar of a particular form. Sometimes they were of common flone, fometimes of marble, wood, or brafs. The altar was fun^ounded with carvings in bas relief, and the corners ornamented with heads of various animals. Some reached no higher than to the knee, others were reared as high as the waift, whilft others were much higher. Some again were folid, others hollow, to receive the libations and the blood of the vidims. Others were portable, refembling a trevet, of a magniticent form, to hold the offering from the .fire, into which they threw frankincenfe, to overpower the difagreeable fmell of the blood and burning fat. In fhort, what had been approved on fome important occalion, pafled into a cuftom, and became a law. Where the altars were placed, there was faid to be in the early ages of the world an houfe or temple of Jehovah, which wasmoftly upon eminences, and
always uncovered. Where they could be had, upright ftones were ereded near them. This in fcripture is called Jetting up a pillar ; nor was it done without a particular form of confecration. The be
haviour of the patriarch Jacob, to which wc refer the reader (7), will explain the whole. It is faid of Mofes likewife That he rofe up early in the morning, and budded an altar under the hill, and twelve pillars, iffc. (8). The entire work of thefc facred eminencles was furrounded at a convenient diftance, by a mound or trench thrown up, in'ord^r to prevent the profane intrulioh of the people (9). At other times the walls were inclofed by groves of oak (i) ; whence this tree is faid to be facred to Jove. The heathens, when they left the objedl, yet continued this ufage alfo of the original worfhip ; which indeed was fo linked to idolatry, that it became neceflary for Mofes to forbid the Hebrews planting groves about their altars, to prevent their falling into the

ihe pra^iccs of the nations round about thenl. TJ^efc groves were hung with garlands and chaplets of flowers, and with a variety of offerings in fo lavifli a manner, as almofc entirely to e^ccludc the light of the fun. They were confidered as the pecuhar refidence of the
deity. No wonder therefore, that it was deemed the
moft inexpiable facrilege to cut them down (2). The high antiquity and univerfility of facrificing, befpeak it a divine inftitution. The utter impoflibility that there (hould be any virtue or efficacy in the thing itfelf, (hews plainly that it muft have been looked upon as vicarious, and having refpecil to fomewhat truly meritorious, and which thofe that brought the facrifice were at firft fufficiently acquainted with the nature of. For it is not to be prefumed upon what grounds men could be induced to think of expiating their fins, or procuring the divine favour by facrificial oblations. It is much more reafonable to conclude it a divine appointment. All nations have ufed it. They who were fo happy as to walk with God, were
inftruded in it from age to age. And they who rejeded him, ftill facriticed. But they invented nevr rites ; and at length, miftaking and perverting the original intent and meaning, offered even human vidtims
!
It is indeed moft furprjlmg to obferve, that almoft all nations, from the ufe of beaiftial, have advanced to human facrifices ; and many of them, from the fame miftake and perverfion, even to the facritice of their own children ! This moft cruel cuftom, amongft the Carthagenijns, of offering children to Saturn (3), dccaftonedan cmbaffy being fent to thehi from the Romans, in or

Struck with a religious reverence for the fandlity of the grove, they imagined that if diey prefumptuoully attempted to cut down any of its trees, the axe would have recoiled upon themfelves. I'hey however believed it lawful to prune and clear them, and to fell thofe trees v.'hich they imagined attracl<id the thunder. , (3) Thefe facrifices were praetifed aiinually by the Cartha

prefuming to facrifice children to him ; and Amafis* king of Egypt, made a law, that oaly the figures of men fltould be facrificed inftead of themfelves. Plutarch informs us, that at the time of a plague, the Spartans were ordered by an oracle to facrifice a virgin ; but the lot having fallen upon a young maid whofe name was Helene, an eagle carried away the facrificing knife, and laying it on the head of an heifer, it was facrificed in her ftead. The fame author informs us, that Pelopidus the Athenian general dreaming the night before an engagement, that he fliould facrifice a virgin to the manes of the daughters of Scedafus, who had been raviflied' and murdered, he was filled with horror at the inhumanity of fuch a facrifice, which he could not help thinking odious to the gods ; but feeing a mare, by the advice of Theocritus the foothfayer, he facrificed it, and gained the vidory. The ceremonies ufed at facrifices were extremely different, and to every deity a diftin<5t vidim was allotted (4) ; but whatever victims were offered, the greateft care was to be taken in the choice of them ;
for the very fame blemifnes that excluded them being otitred by the Jews, rendered them alfo imperfect a
mong the Pagans.
The prieft having prepared himfelf by continence, during the preceding night, and by ablution, before the procellion went a herald crying hoc age, to give the people notice that they were to give their folt attention to what they were about; then followed the playtrs on feveral inftruments, who betv/een the intervals of playing, exhorted the people in the fame manner. The prieft, and fometimes the facrificers, went before cloathed in white, and the prieft, befides being drefled in the veftments belonging to his office, was fure to be crowned with a chaplct of the leaves of
the tree facred to the god for whom the facrifice was appointed ; the vidim haci his horns gilt, and was alfo crowned with a chaplet of the fame leaves, and adorncd with ribbands and fillets. In Greece when the (4) Lucian informs, that " The vldims were alio different •' according to the ouality and circumftance of the perfons who *' offered them.

The vidim arriving at the altar, the prieft laid one hand upon the altar, and began with a prayer to all the gods, beginning with Janus, and ending with Veft.i, during which the ftridteft filence was obferved. Then the facrifice began, by throwing upon the head of the vidim corn, frankincenfe, flour, and fait, laying wpon it cakes and fruit (6), and this they called
immolitio, or the immolition. Then the prieft took the wine, which having hrft tafted, he gave it to the by-ftanders to do fo too (7), and then poured it out, or fprinkled the beaft with it between the horns. After this the prieft plucked off fome of the rough hairs from the forehead of the vidim, threw them into the fire, and then turning to the eaft, drew a ci-ooked line with his knife along the back, from the forehead to the tail, and then ordered the fervants (8) to flay the vidim, which they had no fooner done than he was opened, and the duty of the anifpex began, which was; i.o fooner over, than the carcafe was cut in quarters, and then into fmalier piece-;, and, according to Paufanias (9), and Apolionius Rodius (i), the thighs were covered with fat, and focrificed as the part allotted to the god (a); after which they regaled themfelves upon the reft, and celebrated this religious feaft with dancing, mulic, and hymns fung in honour of the gods. Upon fignal vidories, or in the midft of fome public calamity, they fometimes offered in one facritice a hundred bulls, which was called an hecatomb : but fometimes the fame name was given to the facrifice of an hundred iheep, hogs, or other animals.

Till. OF THE PRIESTS, PRIESTESSES, &C. OfTHl
GREEKS AND ROMANS.
1 N the early ages of the world the chiefs of families
compofed the priefthood ; and afterwards, when public priefts were appointed, kings, as fathers and mafters of that large family which compofed the body politic, frequently offered facrifices ; and not only kings, Sut princes and captains of armies, Inftances of this kind are frequently to be met with in Homer.
When the ancients chofe a prieft, the ftrii^left enquiry was made into the life, the manners, and even the bodily extern^^l perfe(5tions of the perfon to be chofen.
They were generally allowed to marry once, but were not always forbid fecond marriages.
The Greeks and Romans had feveral orders of
priefts J but as Greece was divided into many inde-pendent ftatetj, there naturally arofe different hierarchies. In feveral cities c»f Greece the Government of religon was intrufted to women, in others it was conferred on the men ; while again, in others, both in
concert had a fhare in the management of it. The prieftelFes of Argos were very famous. At Athens a prieftefs prefided over the worfhip of Minerva ; there was alfo a prieftefs for Pallas, at Clazomenae ; for Ceres, at Catanea, &c. The Hierophantae were very fa
mous priefts of Athens, and both they and their wives,
who were called Hierophantidae, were fet apart for the worlhip of Ceres and Hecate ; as were the Orgio
phantae, and the women ftiled Orgiaftae, appointed to prefide over the orgies of Bacchus, Sec. Befides the prieftefs of Apollo, at Delphos, who was by way of eminence called Pythia (3), there belonged to this oracle
(3) Thus the prieftefs of Palks, at Clazomenae, was called Hefychia, and that of Bacclius, Thyas ; and ia Crete, that of Cybe'e, Meliffa. Among the Athenians, the inferior minjfters were ftiled Parafiti, a word that did not at that time carry -y^nth it any mark of reproach ; for it is mention«d in an infcription at Athens, that of two bull* offered in facrifices.

oracle five princes of the priefts, and feveral prophets, who pronounced the fenfe of the oracle. There were
alfo chief priefts one of whom prefidcd over a city, and fometimes over a whole province ; fometimes he was invefted with this dignity for life, and, at other times, only for five years. Befides thefe, there were chief prieftefles, who were the fuperintendants of the prieftefies, and were chofen from the nobleft families; but the moft celebrated of thefe was the Pythia.
The priefts of Rome enjoyed feveral very confiderable privileges ; they were exempted from going to war, and excufed from all burthenfome ofllices in the ftate. They had commonly a branch of laurel and a torch carried before them, and were allowed to ride in a chariot to the capitol. Romulus inftituted fixty priefts, who were to be at leaft fifty years of age, free from all perfonal defeds, and diftinguilhed both by their birth and the reditude of their morals. The Pontifex Maximus, or the high-prieft, was efteem.ed the<-judge and arbitrator of all divine and human affairs, and his authority was fo great, and his
ofiice fo much revered, " that all the emperors, af
" ter the example of Julius Csefar and Auguftus, ei** ther adually took upon them the office, or at leaft
" ufed the name (4)." He was not aiiowed to go out of Italy, though this was dii'penfed with in favour of Julius Caefar ; whenever he attended a funeral, a veil was put between him and the funeral bed ; for it was thought a kind of profanation for him to fee a dead body. The Rex Sacrorum (5), according to Dyonyfi^us of Halicarnafiiis (6), was inftituted after the expulfion of
the Roman kings, to perpetuate the memory of the
great fervices fome of them had done the ftate. On this account, the augurs and Pontifices were direded to choofe out a fit perfon, who fhould devote himfelf to the care of religious worfliip, and the ceremonies
fices, the one ftiould be referved for the games, and the other ciflributtd among the priefts and parafites. Thefe parafites had a place among the chiaf magiftratcs, and the pi-incipal part of their employment was to choofe the wheat appointed fjr their facrifices. Banier's Mydiology, Vol. I. p. 283.

monies of religion, without ever interfering in civil arfairs ; but left the name of king, which was become odious to the people, fhould raife their jealoufy, it was at the fame time appointed, that he fTiould be fubjeft to the high priefts. His wife had the title of Regina Sacrorum. The Flamines, according to Livy (7), were ap
pointed by Numa Pompilius, to difcharge thofe religious offices, which he imagined properly belonged to the kings. At firft there were but three (8), which were chofen by the people, and their eledion confirmed by the high prieft. They were afterwards
increafed to fifteen, three of whom were chofen from
among the fcnators, and were called Flamines Majores ; and the other twelve, chofen from the Plebeans, v/ere fliled Flamines Minores. The Feciales were alfo inflituted by Numa, and conliftcd of twenty perfons, chofen out of the moft diftinguiJlied families. Thefe were properly the heralds of the republic, who, whenever it was injured, were^fcntto demand fatisfaction, which, if they could not obtiiin, they called the gods to witnefs between them and the enemy, and denounced war. They had the power of ratifying and cunfi.-ming alliances, and were the arbitrators of all the differences between the rcpuhjic and other nations ; fo that the Romans could not lawfully take up arms, till the Feciales had declared that war was moft expedient. The Pater Patratus derived his name from a cjrcumf.ance necefiary to his enjoying the title ; and in order that he might be more ftrongly interefied in the fate of his country, he was to have both a father and a fon living at the fame time. lie was chofen by the college of F^-ciales out of their own body, to treat with the enemy on the fubjed of war and peace. The Epulones were minifters appointed to prepare the facred banquets at the folemn games, and had the privilege (7) Llv. lib.

privilege of wearing a robe like the pontiffs, bordered with purple. Thefe minifters were originally thrte in number, to which two were afterwards added, and then two more, till in the pontificate of Julius Ccefar
they were increafed to ten. The moft confidcrable t)f the privileges granted to the Epulones, was one which they enjoyed in common with the other minifters, their not being obliged to make their daughters veltals (9).
Belides thefe were the Salii, or priefts of Mars ; the Phaebades of Apollo ; the Baflarides of Bacchus ;
the Luperci of Pan, and feveral others who prefided over the worlhip of particular deities, each of which had a particular college, and conftituted a diftind community.
OF THE TEMPLES OF THE PAGANS.
V-/AKEN groves, with a circular opening in the midft, or upright ftones placed in the Aime order, inclofing an altar, were the original temples. The firft covered one was that of Babel, and in all probability it was the only one of the kind, till Mofes, by ereding the tabernacle, might give the Egyptians the firft thought of building alfo a houfe for their gods. Had temples been built in Egypt at the time when Mofes refided there, it can hardly be conceived but that he would have mentioned them ; and that this moving temple might ferve as a model for the reft, is the more probable, as there is a near refemblance between the Sancflum Sandtorum and the holy places in the Pagan
temple- In that of Mofes, God was confulted, and jione fuffered to enter but the priefts : this exadly agrees with the holy places in the Heathen temples, where the oracle was delivered. It was the opinion of Lucian, that the firft temples were built by the Egyptians, and that from them the cuftom was conveyed to the people of the neighbouring countries ; and from Egypt and Phcenicia it palfed into Greece, and from Greece to Rome. They all began with little chapels, v.hich were generally ereded by private perfons, and thefe were foon fucceeded by regular buildings, and the moft magnifeccnt (9) Aulus Cellius, lib. I. c. 12.

ficent ftrudlures, when even the grandeur and beauty of the buildings heightened the veneration that was
entertained for them. They had often porticos, and always an afcent of fteps, while fome of them were furrounded by galleries fupported by rows of pillars. The fiHt part in entering thefe temples was the porch, in which was placed the holy water for the expiation of thofe that entered into the temple. The next was the nave(i^, or body of the temple, and then the holy place (»), into which none but the priefts were allowed to enter. Sometimes there was behind the buildings another part, called the back temple. The infide was frequently adorned with paintings, gildings, and the richeft offerings, among which were the trophies and fpoils of war. But the principal ornaments were the ftatues of the gods, and thofe of perfons diftinguiihed by great and noble adlions, which were fometimes of gold, filver, ivory, ebony, and other precious materials. The veneration for thefe buildings was carried by
the Romans and other nations to the moft fuperftitious excefs. Before the ereding one of thefe noble edifices, the Arufpices chofe the place, and fixed the time for beginning the work ; for here every thing was of importance. They began when the air was ferene, and the fky clear and unclouded ; on the limits of the building were placed fillets and garlands, and the foldiers whofe names were thought aufpicious, entered the enclofure with bows in their hands ; then followed the veftal virgins, attended by fuch boys and
girls who had the happinefs to have their fathers and mothers living, and thefe affifted the veftals in fprink,ling all the ground with clear water ; then followed a Solemn facrifice, and prayers to the gods, to profper the building they were going to erect for their habitation ; and this being over, the prieft touched the ftone that was to be firft laid, and bound it with a fillet, after which the magiftrates, and perfons of the greateft diftincflion, affifted the people, with the utmoft joy and alacrity, in removing the ftone, which was extremely large, fixed it for a foundation, throwing in with it feveral fmall gold coins, and other pieces of money.

When thefe buildings were finiftied, they were confecrated with abundance of ceremony, and fo great was the veneration felt by the people for the temples, that they frequently, as a mark of humiliation, clambered up to them on their knees ; and fo holy was the
^lace, that it was thought criminal for a man to fpit or blow his nofe in it. The women proftrated themfelres in them, and fwept the pavements with their hair. They became fanduaries for debtors and criminals ; and on all holidays were conftantly decked with branches of laurel, olive, and ivy. One of the firft temples built in Egypt, was that of Vulcan, at Memphis, ereded by Menes : At firft it had the primitive fimplicity of all other ancient buildings, and without ftatues (3); but the fucceffors of this prince ftrove to excel each other in embellifhing this w^ork with ftately porches and ftatues of a monftrous fize. There were indeed a great number of temples in Egypt, but the moft extraordinary thing of this kind was a chapel hewn out of a fingle fione, which by order of Araafis was cut out of the quarries in upper Egypt, and with incredible difficulty carried as far as Sais, where it was defigned to have been fet up in the temple of Minei-va, but was left at the gate. Herodotus mentions this work with marks of aftoniih
mcnt : " What I admire more, fays he, than at the
" other works of Amufis, is his caufing a houfe to
" be brought from Eliphantina, a houfe hewn out of ** a fingle ftone ; which two thoufand men were
" unable to remove thither in lefs than three years.
" This houfe was thirty-one feet in front, twenty** one feet in breadth, and twelve in height ; and on
" the infide twenty-feven feet in length, and feven
" feet and a half high.'' The temple of Diana at Ephefus (4), has been always admired as one of the nobleft pieces of architecture that the world has ever produced. It was four hundred

But this is not at all ftrange, ftnee Plutarch, who has his authority from Varro, fays, " That the Romans were a hundred and fcventy years " without ftatues ; Numa prohibited them hy a law ; and " TertuUum lets us know, that even in his time there were *' fevcral temples that had no ftatues." (4) This temple was accounted one of the wonders of the world.

hundred and twenty- five feet long, two hundred feet broad, and fupported by a hundred and twenty-feven columns of marble (ixty feet high, twenty-feven of which \^'ere beautifully carved. This temple, which was 200 years in building, was burnt by Eroftratus, with no other view than to perpetuate his memory ; however, it was rebuilt, and the laft temple was not inferior, either in riches or beauty, to the former, being adorned with the works of the moft famous flatuaries of Greece. The temple of Ceres and Proferpine w\is built in the Doric order, and w^is of fo wide an extent as to be able to contain thirty-thoufand men ; for there were frequently that number at the celebration of the myfteries of the two goddefles. At firft this temple had no columns on the outlide ; but Philo afterwards added to it a magnificent portico. The temple of Jupiter (Dlympius, as well as the admirable ftatue of Jupiter placed in it, were raifed from the fpoils which the Elians took at the facking of Pifa (5). This temple was of the Doric order, the moft ancient, as well as the moft fuitable to grand undertakings ; and on the outfide was furrounded with columns, which formed a noble peryftile. The length of the temple was two hundred and thirty feet, its breadth ninety- five, and its height, from the area to the roof, two hundred and thirty. From the middle of the roof hung a gilded victory, under which was a golden fliield, on which was reprefcnted Medufa's head ; and round the temple, above the columns,
hung twenty-one gilt bucklers, which Mummius con
fecrated to Jupiter after the facking of Corinth. Upon the pediment in the front was reprefcnted, with exquifite art, the chariot race between Pelops and Oenomaus ; and, on the back pediment, the battle of the Centaurs with the Lapithas at the marriage of Pirithous ; and the brafs gates were adorned with the labours of Hercules. In the in fide, two ranges of tall and ftately columns fupported two galleries, under which was the way that led to the throne of Jupiter. The ftatue of the god and his throne were the mafter-pieces of the great Phidias, and the moft magnificent and higheft finifhed in all antiquity. The ftatue, which was of a prodigious fize, was of gold and ivory, fo artfully blended as to fill all beholders with

with aflonifliment. The god wore upon his head an olive crown, in which the leaf of the olive was imitated in the niceft perfection. In his right-band he held the figure of vidory, formed likewife of gold and ivory ; and in his left a golden fccptre, on the top of which was an eagle. The f!ioes and mantle of the god were of gold, and on the m.Tnde were eugraven a variety of flowers and aniiiials. The throriC fparkled with gold and precious ftones, vvhiic thi! different materials, and the aflemblage of animals and other ornaments, formed a delightful varitrty. At the four corners of the throne, were four Victorie?
,
that feemed joining hands for a dance ; and at the
feet of Jupiter were two others. On the forelide, the feet of the throne were adorned with fphinxes pluck ing the tender infants from the bofoms of the Theban mothers, and underneath were Apollo and Diana flaying the children of Niobe with their arrows, &c. At the top of the throne, above the head of Jupiter,
were the graces and hours. The pedeftal which fupported the pile, was "equally adorned with the reit : it was covered with gold ; on the one fide, Phidias had engraven Phoebus guiding his chariot ; on the other, Jupiter and Juno, Mercury, Vefta, and the graces : here Venus appeared as riiing from the fea, and Cupid receiving her, while Pitho, or the goddefs of perfuafion, feemed prefenting her with a crown : there appeared Apollo andDiraia, Minerva and Hercules. At the foot of the pedtftal v.*ere Neptune and Amphitrite, with Diana, wiio appeared mounted on horfeback. In (hort, a woollen veil dyed in purple, and curioufly embroidered, hung down from the top
to the bottom. A large balluftrade painted and adorned with figures encompalfed the whole work j there, with inimitable art, was painted the Atlas bearing the heavens upon his (houlders, and Hercules {looping to eafe him of his load ; the com.bat of Her

This temple was paved with the fine/t marble, adorned with a prodigious number of ftatues, and with the prefents which fevecal princes had confecrated to the God. Though the temple of Apollo at Delphos, was greatly inftrior in point of magnificence to the former,

yet the fmmenfe preTents fent to it from every quarter, rendered it infinitely more rich. The principal value of the former arofe from its containing the works of Phidias, and his mafter-piece was really invaluable ; but what this temple wanted, in not containing the produdions of fo curious an artift, was amply made up by a profufum of treafure, which arofe from the
offerings of thofe who went to confult the oracle. The firft temple which was built being burnt, the -Ampbictyones, or general council of Greece, took tipcn themielves the care of rebuilding it ; and for tliat purpofe agreed viith an archite<5t for three hunrdred talents, which amounts to forty-five thoufand pounds, and this fum was to be raifed by the cities of Greece ; colledlions were alfo made in foreign countries. Amafis, king of Egypt, and the Grecian inhabitants of that country, contributed confiderable fums for that fervice. The Alomoeonedes, one of the moft powerful families in Athens, had the charge of conducing the building, which they rendered more
magnificent, by making, at their own expence, confiderable additions that had not been propofed in the model. After the temple of Delphos was finifhed, Gyges, king of Lydia, and Crcefus, one of his fuccelTors, enriched it with an incredible number of the moft valuable prefents ; and, after their example, many other princes, cities, and private perfons beftowed r.u.n it a vaft number of tripods, tables, veflels, fjiiclds, crowns, and ftatues of gold and filver of inconceivable value. Herodotus informs (6), that the prefents of gold made by Croefus alone to this temple, amounted to more than two hundred and fifty talents, or 33,500!. Iterling ; and it is probable that thofe of filver were
not of lefs value. And Diodorus Siculus (7) adding thcfe to thofe of the other princes, computes them at ten thoufand talents, or about 1,300,0001.(8). Plutarch informs us (9), that amongft the Itatucs of gofd, whi<;h ^roefus placed in the temple of Delphos, was

married a fecond wife, by whom he had children ; Ihc
formed the defign of fecuring the crown to her own iffue, by putting a period to the life of her fon-in-Iaw ; and with this view engaged a female baker to put
poifon into a loaf, that was to be ferved up at the
table of the young prince. The woman, ftruck with korror at the thought of her bearing fo great a fhare in the guilt of the queen, let Croefus into Mie fscret ; en which the loaf was ferved to the queen**.:' o'-v;^ .-.:hi]'' dren, and their death fecured his fucceflion to tlie throne, which when he afcended, from a fcnfe of gratitude to his benefadrefs, he eredled thic ftiitue ie her memory in the temple of Delphos ; an honour that, our author fays, flie had a better title to, than
many of the boafted conquerors or heroes, who rokto fame only by murders and devaftation. Italy was no lefs famous for a multiplicity of temples than Greece ; but none of them were more noble, or more remarkable for the Angularity of their form,
than the Pantheon, commonly called the Rotunda,
originally confecrated to all the gods, as it is now to all the faints. It is generally believed to have been built at the expence of Agrippa, fon- in-law to Auguftus. This ncble fabric is entirely round, and without v/indows, receiving a fufficient degree of light from an opening admirably contrived in the center of the dome. It was richly adorned with the ftatues of all the gods and goddeffes fet in niches. But the portico, compofed of fixteen columns of granate marble, each of one fingle ftone, is more beautiful and more furprifing than the temple i^fjlf, fince thefe columns are five feet in diameter, and thirty-feven feet high, without mentioning the baf;;s and chapiters. The emperor Conftantius the Third ftripped it of the plates of gilt brafs that covered the loof, and of the beams, which were cf the fame metal. Of the copperplates of the portico. Pope Urban the Eighth afterwards formed the canopy of St. Peter ; and even of the nails, which faftened them, caft the great piece of artillery, which is ftill to be feen in the caftle of St. AHgelo.

The Volfcian fpoils
were dedicated to this fer\'ice. An incredible fum was expended upon the foundations only, which were quadrilateral, and near upon two hundred feet every way : the length exceeding the breadth not quite fif
teen feet. When the foundations were clearing, a hum.an head was found, with the lineaments of the face entire, and the blood yet frefh and flowing, which was interpreted as an omen of future empire. This head was faid to have belonged to one Ollus, or Tolus, whence the ftru(5lure received '1 c( mpound name. Though poffibly it might be as \-. cil to deduce the name from Caput only ; and that too upon another account, becaufe it was the commanding part, the head and citadel of Rome, and the chief place of its religious worlhip. The edifice was not finilhed till after the expulfion of the kings ; the completion of it being a work, fays Livy, referved for the days of liberty. It flood the Ipace of 425 years, to the confu
late of Scipio and Norbanus, when it was confumed by fire ; but it was rebuilt by Sylla, whofe name was infcribed in letters of gold upon the faftigium or pediment of it. In the midft were formed three ctlls or temples feparated by thin partiiiv :. , in which
flood the golden images of the deities to whom it had been devoted. Thofe of Juno and Minerva were on each fide of Jupiter ; for it was not ufual for him to be worfhipped Avithout the company of his wife and daughter. The three temples were covered by one eagle with his Avings expanded. This wonderful Ilrudure feems to have been of the Doric order, in imitation-of thofe raifed to the fame deity in Greece, and abounded with curious engravings and eveiy
plaiftic ornament, particularly the Faftigium. The fpacious entrances, or threfliolds, were compofed of brafs. The lofty folding-doors, which were of the fame

And Ihed around its trembling rays of light. Without, the covering was of plates of brafs, fafhioncd like tiles; which being gilt with gold, reflected the fun-beams with excefiive luftre. The front to the Ibuth was encompalTed with a triple row of lofty marble columns beautifully poliflied, brought from the temple of Olympian Jove at Athens, by order of Sylla : all the other fides by a double row. The afcent was by an hundre^lleps that gently rofe, which made the paflage to it extremely grand and flriking. But this C.ipitol was likewife burnt in. the civil v/ar, between Vitellius and Velpafian, and reftored by the latter, with fome additio-i of height : it quickly after underwent the fame fate, and was raifed again by Domitian with rr)ore itreiiglh and magnificence than
before ; who arrogated the whole honour of the ftructure to himfelf. The poets were miitaken, when they promifed to this laft f ibric an eternal duration, for not many years inter\entd before it was fired by lightening, and a great part of it confumed. The left-hand of the golden image of Jupiter was mejted. Afterwards, under Arcadius andHonorius, the plunder of it was begun by Stilicho ; who ftripped the valves or folding-doors of the thick plated gold which covered them : in one part of which was found a grating infcription, declaring them referred for an k«Ja rtimate Prince. Genferic, king of the Vandals, carried

a7o APPENDIX.
Of THE USEFULNESS of FABLE.
By Mr. Rollin, Profefibr of Eloquence in the Royal College at Paris, and Member of the Royal Academy of Infcriptions and Belles Lettres.
W HAT I have already obferved (fays this learned
author) concerning the origin of fables, which owe their birth to fiction, error, and fallhood, to the alteration of hiftorical fadts, and the corruption of man^s heart, may give reafon to alk, whether it is proper to inftrua: Chriftian children in all the fooliih inventions, abfurd and idle dreams, with which Paganifm has filled the books of antiquity. This ftudy, when applied to with all the precautions and wifdom, which religion demands and in
fpires, may be very ufeful to youth. Firfi, it teaches them what they owe to Jefus Chrift,
their Redeemer, who has delivered thtni iVom the power of darknefs, to bring them into the admirable light of the Gcfpel. Before him what were even the wifeft and beft of men, thofe celebrated philolbpherr, thofe great politicians, thofe famous Icgiliators of Greece, thofe grave fenators of Rome ; in a word, all the belt governed and wifeft nations of the world ? Fable informs us, they were blind worfnippers of the devil, v»'ho bent their knees before gold, lilver, and marble ; who offered incenfe to ftatues, that were
deaf and dumb ; w-ho acknovvledged, as Gods, animals, reptiles, and plants ; who were not aOiamed to adore an adulterous Mars, a proftituted Venus, and an inceftuous Juuo, a Jupiter polluted with all manner of crimes, and for that reafon moft worthy of the firft place among the Gods.
What great impurities, what monftrous abomina tions were admitted into their ceremonies, their foleranities, and myfteries i The temples of their gods were fchools of licentiouihefs, their pidlures inviUtions to fin, their groves places of profcitution, their facrifices a frightful mixture of fapei-ftition and cruelty. In this condition were all mankind, except the people of the Jews, for near four thoufand years. In this ftate were car fatlsers, and we fliould have likewife been, if the light of the Gofpel had notdifpcrfcd ©ur darknefs. Every icory in fabulous hiftory, ever\circumitanco

5;ircumllance of the lives of the God?, fiiould till us af once with confufion, admirktion and gratitude, and Ictm to cry out to us aloud in the words of St. Paul to the Ephefians : Remember, and torget not, thnt bein^ fprung from Gcntiltif ye rattre ftran^i^ers from //..•'
•co've7ia7its of proniift^ halving no bote, coid r^ilLout God in the qvorld.
A fecond advantage of fabk is that in dlfcovering
to us the abfurd ceremonies and impious maxims of Paganifm, it ought to infpire us with new refpect for the auguft majefty of the Chriftian religion, and the
fandity of its mcrals. We karn from ecclefiauicai biltory, that an holy bijhop, in order to eradicate entirely all difiDontions to idolatry out cf the minds of the faithful, brought to light and publickly expofcd all that was found in the inlide of a temple he cauled to be demoiiih^d, the bones of men, the members of children lacrificed. to devils, and feveral ether footfteps of the facrilegious worfliip. which the Pagans paid to their deities. The fcudy of fable fhould produce a like cZj.-ti in the mind of every lenfible perfon, and it is this lUe the holy fathers and all the iipologifts of Chriftianity have made of it. It is impoffible to underftand the books which have been vvritten upon this fubjed, without having fome knowledge of fabulous hiftory. St. Auguftin's great work, entitled, Be Ci'vitate Dei, which has done fo
much honour to the church, is at the fame time both a proof of what I lay down, and a perfed: model of
the manner how we ought to flmdify profane fcudies.
The fame may be (iiid of the other fathers, who have gone upon the fame plan from the beginniHg of Chriftianity. Theophilus of Antioch, Tatian, Arnobius, Ladantius, Theodorct, Eufebius of Caefarea, and efpecially St. Clement of Alexandria, w^hofe Stromata are not to be underftood by any one that is not verfed in this part of ancient learning. Whereas the knowledge (*f v.iolc makes the knowledge of them extremely eafy, vn-'ucIi we ought to look upon as no fmali
It is aiia very ufeful (and particularly to youth, for
whom I write) for the understanding both of Greek, J^atin, French, and Englifh authors ; in reading ot which they muit be often at a ftaad, without fome acquiiintance with fable. I don't fpeak only of the
poets, to whom we know it is a kind of natural language j it IS alfo frequently made uie of by orators, anvi

and fometimes, by an h^^^^y application, lappi.es them with very lively and^loquent turns : Such, for inftance, araofigft a great many others, is the following paffage in Tully's oration concerning Mithridates, king of Pontus. The orator takes notice, that this prince flying before the Romans, after the Icfs of a battle, f(3Qnd means to efcape out of the hands of fais covetous conquerors, by fcattering upon the road, from time to time, a p)art of his treasures and fpoils. In like manner, fays he, as it is told of Medea, that when (lie was purfued by her father, in the fame country, fhe fcattered the members of her brother Abiyitus, v/hom fhe had cut to pieces, along the Vay, that his care in gathering up the difperfed members, and his grief at the fight of fo fad a fpeftacle, might retard his purfuit. The refemblance is exa<5t, except that, as Tully remark?, ^eta, the father of Medea, v/as flopped in his courfe by forrow, and the Romans by joy. There are different fpecies of books expofed to the viev/ of the whole world, fuch as pictures, prints, tapeflry, and ftatues. Thefe are fo many riddles to thofe who are ignorant of fabulous hiftory, fi'om v/hence their explication is frequently to be taken. Thefe matters are likewife frequently brought into
difcourfe, and it is not, in my opinion, over agree
able to fit mute, and feem flupid in company, for want of being inflruded, whilft young, in a matter fo eafy to be learnt

Notwithstanding the monfirous multipli

as abfolute, and iafiiiitely fuperior to all the other
Gods in po'.v:^r and authority, as able by a v/ord to
caft them all out of heaven, and plunge them into the
depths of Tartaru3, as having executed his vengeance

A FURTHER ILLUSTRATION
OF THE
Dil MAJORES OF THE ROMANS;
PARTICULARLY ADAPTED TO THE CLASSICS.
iN the works of the poets, painters, and ftatuaries, the greateft characreriftic of Jupiter is majefty. The pbleft of the laft was Phidias of Athens, and the
Jupiter Oh mpius was his mafter-piece. Being aiked from what pattern he framed Co divine a figure, he anfwcred, from the archetype which he found in Homer (A. 1. 528, 29, 30), which Mr. Pope has thus tranflated,
He fpoI';e, and awful bends his fable brows ; Shakes his ambrofial curls and gives the nod, The ilamp of Fate and fanction cf the God: liigh heav'n with trembling the dread fignal took. And all Olympus to the center fhook.
It is obferved, that all the perforal ftro'ces in this defcription relate to the hair, the eye-brow i, and the beard (before fpoken of). And tothefe the beft heads of Jupiter owe moft of their dignity. However mean
our opinion may be of thefe appurtenances, and of the laft particularly, yet all over the eaft a full beard ftill conveys the idea of majefty, as it did then amongft the Greeks ; as their bufts»of Jupiter and the medals of their kings teftify. But Rome, long before fhe loft her liberty, had parted with this natural ornament ; infomuch that a beard was only worn by perfons under difgrace or misfortune. Virgil therefore, in his imitation of this pafTage {JEn. 9. 1. 104, s, 6), has preferved only the nod, with 4ts ftupendous efft£i ; but neglected the hair, the eyebrows, and the beard, thofe chief pieces of imagery, whence the artift took the idea cf a countenance proper for the Jting -of gods and men. His



A FUKTHEa ILLUSTRATION, &c. 2:j
His ftatue in the Verofpi palace at Rome, though
one of the beft extant, docs by no means come up to the idea which the ancient poets have impreffed of him. Yet the dignity of his look, the fullnefsof the hair about his face, the venerable beard, tJie fceptre in his left hand, and the fulmen in his right, eafily bcfpeak th-e deity reprefented. But the ancient fceptres v/ere not fliort and adorn•ed, like the modern ; but as long, at leart, as the bearer. Originally they were no other than walkingIt icks. That of Latinus was a young tree ftript of its branches. 7En. xii. The fulmtn h;id three different meanings, as differently reprefented. One v/ay it is a conical wreath
of flames, like the bolt. This was held down in the hand, and Ihewcvl Jupiter to be mild and calm. Another way it is the fam.e figure, with two tranfverfe darts of lightning, and fomctim.es with wings on each lide, to denote rapidity. This reprefented him as executing vengeance. The tkundcring legion bore this upon their IhieMs, which fpread over all the field ; as is feen in the Antonine pillar. The epithets of trlfidum and tr'ifculum (three-forked) are given to this, 'I'he third way is a handful of flames, which Jupiter holds up, when exacting punifliment in a more extraordinary manner. B it it was neither the fceptre nor the fulmen of Jupiter, but that air of majefty which the artifts endeavoured to exprefs in his countenance, which chiefly indicated the fuperiority of Jupiter on all occafions. The lail kind are the iratunda fulmina of Horace.
On a gem at Plorence, the mild Jupiter appears with a mixture of dignity and eafe ; that ferene majefty which Virgil gives him, when receiving Venus with fuch paternal tendernefs in the firft iEneid. But the (latues of the terrible Jupiter, differ in every particular from thofe of the mild. The laft were generally of wliite marble, the other of blacko Tlie mild fat with an air of .tranquillity.. The terntie ftood, and was more or icfs diftuibed, with an angry or clouded countenance, and the hair fo difcompofed as lo fall half v/ay down the forehead* Yet he is never repreunte^ fo angry but that he ftiit retains his majelb/. On medals and gems the thundering Jupiter holds up the three-forked fulmen, ftauding in a chaiiot &urri;:d;

hurried on by four horfcs. And the poets deforibc the n«ife of his thunder, as caufed by the rattfing of his chariot and hcrfes over the arch of heav^en. Thus Horace, (Od. 1. i. 34.) according to Mr. Francis,
For Ic ! that awful heavenly fire, Wflo frequent cleaves the clouds with fire, P.irtnt of day, immortal Jove, ' Late through the floating fields of air, 'i he face iA hcnv'n fv^rene and fair, His thundering l>eeds and winged chariot drove
!
Juno had various charaders among the Romanp.
The Juno Matrona is covered like a Roman matron, with a long robe from head t-o foot. By this name Horace fpeaks of her in- the battle of the giants i
^cugh at other times fhe is indifferently called by this, or that of the Juno Romana. So gem togata
fignified the Roman people. • But the Juno Regina, and the Juno Morels, are always in a more fpiendid-and magnificent habit. In the fii-ft JEneid, Virgil fpeaks of the Carthagiaian Ju
no ; in the fecond of the Juno Argiva, who was v/or
fnipped under that name even in Italy. I'he Mild Juno appears on a Greek m.edal, with a gentle and good-natured countenance. Handing in a chariot drawn by peacocks. Here fhe appears almoft
naked. -So Homer gives her the epithet of MvKahivcg^ with white elbows or arms. But he is never imitated
JB'this by the Roman poets. She is reprefented by ".all of them as an imperious and jealous wife, oftener fcolding than carefling. It is wonderful that fhe fhculd be thus generally expofed in a difagrceable .Irght, v>rhen confidered on all hands as the patronefa of marriage. Pallas or Minerva is a beauty, but of a feverer kind, having none oi the graces or foftnefles of A'^eBus. Dignity, firmnefs, and compofure, with a kind of mafculine fternnefs, form the diftinguifhing charader of her face ; which has therefore been often miftaken for that of Alexander the Great. Her drefs and attributes arc well adapted to her characfter. Her head is armed, with an helmet, and the plume nods dreadfully in the air. Her right hand holds a fpear, and her left a fhield, with the head of the dying Medufa thereon. The fame figure is feen upon her



•DII MAJORES OF THE ROMANS. 277
her breaft-plate, and is fometimes raofl beautiful, and
fometimes quite the reverfe. The Strczzi-Medufa
at Rome has indeed a dead look, but with it a beauty
which death itfelf cannot extinguifh. The poets defcribe both the beauties and horrors of Medufa's face, and her ferpents, particularly two, whofe tails are entwined under her chin, and their heads reared over her forehead. (Ovid Met. iv. 793.) Minerva tierfelf has fometimes ferpents about her bofom ajid fhouldcrs. The poets and artifts agree. They give to the afpedl of Minen^a much beauty, but more terror. /With all her grace, fhe is entitled the virago, and the flern goddefs. They fpeak of a threatening turn in her eyes. Virgil afcribes a fiery motion t.) thofe of the Palladium (the tutelary Miuerva). As making her appearance firft in Africa, fhe has much of the Moor in her complexion ; and her light-coioured eye
ftiews it more ftrongly. From this colour of her eyes Ihe is called by Komer yTyavy-xTrii^ or grey-eyed; though it is ftrange that no poet of tlic Augiiftan age has copied this epithet. Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva, are frequently joined together by the Roman authors, as well as in ancient infcriptions and in the works of the artifts. They were confidered as the guardians of the empire, and invoked by name, v;hile the reft were referred to in
general. Hence Cicero addreffes-^" Thee, O greateft
** Jupiter!— and thee,. O royal Juno! —and thee,
*' Minerva ! —and ye, the other immortal gods and
** goddefles !" The lame diftinclion is in Livy.
They are frequently feen together on gems and medals ; and fometimes (as in a medal of Antoninus) they are- reprefented by their attributes only ; as Minerva, by the owl ; Jupiter, by the eagle ; and Juno, by the peacock. Neptune is generally reprefented ftanding with a long trident in liis right hand, (Ovid Met. vi.l. 77.)
The god of ocean, figur'd ftanding, here
With his long trident ftrikes the ragged rock.
This was his peculiar fceptre.; and the fame pott

But in whatfoever circumftances flie is reprefented, all about her is graceful and charming.
And this is no where more confpicuous than in the Venus of Medici. If in this figure fhe is not really inodeft, fhe at leafl: counterfeits modefty extremely well, accor<^ing to Ovid, (De Art. Amand. 1. a. %< 613, 14.) Where Venus 'felf, with half-averted face. With her left hand o*erfhades the fecret place.
With regard to fhape and proportion, this ftatue will ever be the ftandard of female beauty and foftnefs. Some few have fufpefted the head, but without fuffi-eitnt reafon, to have been the work of another artift
;
while others have difcovered beauties, which feem
only to have been the work of their own fancies.

They fay that three different pafliors are exprefTed in it ; that at your firft approach, avcrfion appears in her look. Move a ftep or two, and you perceive
compliance in it. One ftep more (fay they) to the right, turns it into a little infulting fmile, as if ihc had made fure of you. Befides the infulting fmile with which Ihe appears in fome figures, Ihe is reprefented fmiling in others, and in a mofi: perfuative attitude. Such was the Erycina ridens of Horace, and the Venus Appias in the forum ; and luch was the defign on the medal of Aurelius, in which Venus is entreating Mars. This laft was infcribtd to the Veneri Vidrici, as fure of carrying her point. In a ftatue at Florence, fhe holds one of her hands round the neck of Mars, and the other on his breaft enforcing her rcqueft. Virgil defcribes her in thefe circumftances urging her petition to the demurring Vulcan, U^'^. viih 1. 387, 8.)
She fpoke, and threw Her arms around him with reliftlefs grace, And footh'd him, doubting, with a foft embrace.
She is alfo frequently reprefented as the genius of ir.doience, reclined on a bed in a larguifliingpofture, and generally attended by Cupids, the minifters of her commands. She thus appearti in one of the fineft-coloured pictures in the Barnardini Palace at Rome. The air of the head rivals Guido, as the colouring does Titian. Yet in the poets of the third age, as Flaccus and Statius, Ihe appears in a quite contrary charader, as the furious Venus, or the goddefs of jealoufy. The taft of thefe poets has a Venus improba. If this be not fhe fame v.i' h the furious, it can only fuit the vicious or abandoned Venus. Mars is never reprefented without his attributes,
the helmet and fpear. He dots not even quit thefe when going on his amours. His molt celebrated one, next to that with Venus, v. as vvrith Rhea Sylvia, the mother of Romulus and Remus. In a relievo belonging to the Bellini Family at Rome, having de
fcended, he moves towards Rhea, who lies afleep.
On the reverfe of the medal of Antoninus, he is fufpended in the air, juft over the Veftal Virgil^. Th<»re is a pafTage in Juvenal, on this occafion, which (hews the ufefulnefb of antiques for the explanation of the
poets (Jur. Sat, J I.)

Or elfe a helmet for himfelf he made,
Where various warlike figures were inlaid :
The Roman wolf fuckling the twins was there,
And Mars himfelf armed with his (hield and fpear, . Hov'ring above his creft, did dreadful ftiow, As threat'ning death to each refifting foe,
Dryden,
Juvenal here defcribes the fimplicity of the old Roman foldiers, and the figures that v/ere generally engraven on their helmets. The firft was the wolf giving fuck to Romulus and Remus. The fecond, which is comprehended in the two laft verfes, is not fo intelligible. 'The commentators are extremely at a lofs to know what is meant by the Pci7J<^^tifq;e JDeiy as it is in the original. Some fancy it to cxprcfs'only the great emboflment of the figure ; others, that it hung off the helmet in alto relievo^ as in the foregoing tranilation. Lubin thinks him faid to be hanging,, becaufe the fhield which bore him, hung on the left fhoulder. One old interpreter thinks, that by hanging, is only meant a pofture of bending forward to ftrike the enemy. Several learned men imagine a fault in the tranfcribcr, and that it fhould be pendentis ; but upon no authority. Mr. Addifon has certainly hit upon tht true meaning. The Roman foldiers (fays
he), who v/ere not a little proud of their founder and the military genius of the republic, ufed to bear on their helmets the full hifiory of Romulus, who was begot by Mars and fuckled by a wolf. The figure of the god was made, as if defcending on. the prieftcfs. The occaiion required that his body iliould be naked, (Ovid, de Faft. 1.3.) Then too, our mighty Sire, thon v/afl difarmed,
When thy rapt foul the lovely prieftefs charm'd That Rotne*s high founder bore

though on other occafions he is drawn as Horace defcribes him, Begirt with adamantine coat of mail.
The fculptor, however to diftinguifh him, has given him his attributes, a fpear in one hand, and a ihield
in the other. As be was reprefented defcending, h,U iigure appeared fiifptr,ded in the air over the Veflral Virgin, in which fenfe the word pendentis is extremely
proper and- poetical. The fame figures are alfo en another

another medal of Antoninus Pius, ftamped in compliment to that emperor for his excellent government,
whom the fenate regarded as a fecond founder. The ftory alluded to, is thus related by Ovid (de Faft. lib. 3. cleg. I.)
As tht'fair Veftal to the fountain came,, (Let none be ftartred at a Veftal's name) ' Tir'd with the v/aik, fhe Inid her down to reft,
And Lo the winds 'exp>os'd iier glowing brealt
To take thefrefhnefs of Lhc morning air,
And gathered in a knot her fowing hair ; While thus fhe refttjd on her arm reclin'd.
The hoary willows waving with the wind.
And feather'd quires that warbled in the fhade, ")
And purling ftreams that through the meadow (
ftray'd, C
In drowfy murmurs lull'd the gentle maid. J
The god of war beheld the virgin lie,
The god beheld her with a lever's eve ;
And by fo tempting an occafion pre/t-V.,
The beauteous maid, whomhe beheld, poficfsM :
Conceiving as fiie fiept, her fruitful womb Sweird with the founder of iiriinortal Rome. Addison. Vulcan, the god of fire, is never otherwife deIcribed than as a mere immortal blackfmith. But the poets have given him the additional difgrace of Lameriefs, (Horat. Od. i. 4. )
While Vulcan's glov^dng breath infpires The toilfome forge, and blows up all its fires.
He is black, and hardened from his cuflomary labour, with a fiery red face ; thence called ardens \iilcanus. He is ever the iiibjed of pity or ridicule ; the grand cuckold of heaven ; and his lamenefs ferved only to divert the gods. (Ovid, de Art. Amand. lib. a. v. 567, 8, 9, 10.
How oft woul'd Vulcan's too lafcivious bride His large fplay-feet ai d callous hands deride.
And hobbling, while his abfence this allows, Ape, before Mars, the limping of her fpoufe ! 'Twas pretty all ; whate'er flie did became ; Such vvinujng grace adorn'd the lovely dame. Vefta had no fcatue. Ovid indeed iV.caka of hp: images in one place (Fall. lib. 3. v. 45, 6) ; buti*rfhe courfe



ziz A FURTHEH 5LLUSrRATlON or the
courfe of the fame work corrects himfelf (Faft. lib. 6. V. 295 and feq.)
Long thought i, Vefta had her ftatucs too, But in her temple no fuch form I view ; Fire unextinguilh'd there indeed is known, But Vefta and the fire no image own.
The figures which are fuppofed to be hers, having nothing which would not be as j)roper for a Veftal Virgin. Even thofe on medals, which have her name,
may only mean one of the Veftals her reprefentatives.
And indeed there is one infcribed with the name of Vefta, wherein the figure is in the ad of facrificang, which is applicable to the prieftefs, but by no means to the goddefs. Apollo is always to be diftlnguifhed in his ftatues and heads by the beauty of the face, in which there is an air of divinity not to be conceived without the help of the artift. He is more comely than Mercury, but not
fo effeminate as Bacchus, who rivals him in beauty. His features are quite regular, his limbs exadly proportioned, and there is as much foftnefs as is coniiftent with ftrength. He is ever young and beardlefs.
His long and beautiful hair falls in eafy waves down
his fhoiilders, and fom«times over his breaft. A grace refults from the whole, which it were a vain talk to defcribe to any perfon who has not feen the Apollo Behndera. (TibuU. lib. 2. eleg. 3. v. 11. 12.)
Admetus' herds the fair Apollo fed ;
Nor hai-p, nor unfhorn locks avail'd him then.
In the ftatuejuft mentioned, the noblell: in the world, he is nrprefented as the Apollo Fenator. His hair is gathered a little above his forehead. His robe, faft
ened with a gem over his breaft, falls loofely down his back, and is thrown over his arm. His feet are covered w:th fine bulkins : the reft of his body is naked ; and he has a bow in his hand, as if he had juft diicharg'id an arrow. The Mutical Apollo is fometimes naked, with the hair gathered over the forehead, his lyre in one hand, and his pi rclrum in the other. Sometimes he is dreiTed in a long robe, with his- hair flowing at full length, and crowned with laurel. Diana, the goddefs of the chace, is commonly reprefented as runrung, with her veit flying back, though girt



D» MAJORKS OF THE ROMANS. a8 '
girt around her. Htr ftature is tall and her face, thaiigh very haiidfome, is Ibmewhat manly. Her legs are naked, well-fhaped and ftrong. Her feet are
Ibmetimes clad in buficin^j, and foinetim«s bare. A quiver adorns her fhoiildcr, and Ihc has in her righthand a fpear or bov/. Thefe Itatiies were frequent in woods. The ftory of Adaeon is to be feen on a gem in Maffei's Collection. Ceres has her head crowned either with corn or poppies, and her robes fall down to her feet. Her beauty feems to have been of the brunette kind j and her drefs was adapted to her complec^ion. But her brcafts are in moft figures reprefented very large. Virgil defcribes her as regarding the hufbandman from heaven, and blefling his work. (Georg. lib.i. v. 95. 6.)
Nor from high heav'n amid theXarry train
The yellow Ceres him behcids in vain. In this charader flie appears in a picfture in the Vatican manufcript. Mercury, as the meffenger of Jupiter, is young, airy, and light ; ail proper for fwiftnefs. His limbs are finely turned, and he is inferior in beauty to none of the gods, except Apollo and Bacchus. (Horat. Carm. lib. i. ode 2. v. 41 and feq. )
Or thou, fair Maia's winged fon, appear,
And mortal fliape, in prime of manhood, bear; Declar'd the guardian of th' in^.perial ftate. Divine avenger of great Csefar's fate.
The attributes by which he is diilinguifhed, are the petafus, or winged cap ; the talaria, or wings for his feet ; and the caduceus, or wand, entwined by two ferpents, His harp, or long fword, is added to thefe. with a particular hook to the latter. He is thus reprefented in the Vatican manufcript, with his veft floating behind him in the air, to denote his fwiftnefs.
We have already given a full account of this deity,
in the chapter of Mercury ; fo that nothing material
can be here added. We ihall ther.fore take leave of
the reader by preicnting him with the tranflation of an ode, probably written for the cekbKation of his feaft, in which his' ingenuity and office are fully defcribed. (Horat. Carm. lib. i. ode 10)
Thou God of Wit, from Atlas fprung,
Who by perfualive pow'r of tanajue,
