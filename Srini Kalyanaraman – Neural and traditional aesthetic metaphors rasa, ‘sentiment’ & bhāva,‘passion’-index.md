Eight Sentiments
15. The eight Sentiments recognized in drama are as follows: Erotic (śṛṅgāra), Comic
(hāsya), Pathetic (karuṇa), Furious (raudra), Heroic (vīra), Terrible (bhayānaka), Odious
(bībhatsa) and Marvellous (adbhuta).
16. These eight are the Sentiments named by Druhiṇa (Brahmā). I shall now speak of the
Durable and the Complementary Psychological States and the Sāttvika ones.
Durable Psychological States
17. The Durable Psychological States (sthāyibhāva) are known to be the following: love,
mirth, sorrow, anger, energy, terror, disgust and astonishment.

18-21. The thirty-three Complementary Psychological States (vyabhicāribhāva) are
known to be the following: discouragement, weakness, apprehension, envy,
intoxication, weariness, indolence, depression, anxiety, distraction, recollection,
contentment, shame, inconstancy, joy, agitation, stupor, arrogance, despair,
impatience, sleep, epilepsy, dreaming, awakening, indignation, dissimulation, cruelty,
assurance, sickness, insanity, death, fright and deliberation. These are defined by their
names.
Eight Sāttvika States

Sentiments explained
In that connexion I shall first of all explain the Sentiments (rasa). No [poetic] meaning
proceeds [from speech] without [any kind of] Sentiment. Now the Sentiment is produced
(rasa-niṣpattiḥ) from a combination (saṃyoga) of Determinants (vibhāva), Consequents
(anubhāva) and Complementary Psychological States (vyabhicāri-bhāva). Is there any
instance [parallel to it], [Yes], it is said that, as taste (rasa) results from a combination of
various spices, vegetables and other articles, and as six tastes are produced by articles such
as, raw sugar or spices or vegetables, so the Durable Psychological States (sthāyibhāva),
when they come together with various other Psychological States, attain the quality of a
Sentiment (i.e. become Sentiment). Now one enquires, “What is the meaning of the
word rasa”? It is said in reply [that, rasa is so called] because it is capable of being tasted
(āsvādyate).

How is rasa tasted? [In reply] it is said that just as well-disposed persons while eating
food cooked with many kinds of spice, enjoy (āsvādayanti) its tastes, and attain pleasure
and satisfaction, so the cultured people taste the Durable Psychological States while they
see them represented by an expression of the various Psychological States with Words,
Gestures and the Sattva, and derive pleasure and satisfaction. Thus is explained [the
Memorial Verse ending with] tasmān nāṭyarasā iti. For in this connexion there are two
traditional couplets:
32-33. Just as connoisseur of cooked food (bhakta) while eating food which has been
prepared from various spices and other articles taste it, so the learned people taste in their
heart (manas) the Durable Psychological States (such as love, sorrow etc.) when they are
represented by an expression of the Psychological States with Gestures. Hence these
Durable Psychological States in a drama are called Sentiments.

The definition given at Vism. 447 is as follows:
“jivhā-paṭihanana-lakkhaṇo raso, jivhā-viññāṇassa visaya-bhāvo raso, tass’eva gocara
paccupaṭṭhāno, mūla-raso khandha-raso ti ādinā nayena anekavidho, ” i.e. rasa is
physiologically & psychologically peculiar to the tongue (sense-object & sense-perception),
and also consists as a manifold object in extractions from roots, trunk etc...The conventional
encyclopædic definition of rasa at Nd1 240; Nd2 540, Dhs. 629 gives taste according to: (a)
the 6—fold objective source as mūla-rasa, khandha°, taca°, patta°, puppha°, phala°, or taste
(i.e. juice, liquid) of root, trunk, bark, leaf, flower & fruit; and — (b) the 12—fold subjective
(physiological) sense-perception as ambila, madhura, tittika, kaṭuka
loṇika, khārika, lambila (Miln. 56: ambila), kasāva; sādu, asādu, sīta, uṇha, or sour, sweet,
bitter, pungent, salt, alkaline, sour, astringent; pleasant, unpleasant, cold & hot.

Dorsomedial Prefrontal and Left Insular Cortex Co-Localize in Adolescents with Aggressive Behaviour: An ALE Meta
Analysis. PLoS One. 2015 Sep 4;10(9):e0136553. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0136553. PMID: 26339798; PMCID:
PMC4560426.
Abstract.
Recent neuroimaging work has suggested that aggressive behaviour (AB) is associated with structural and functional brain
abnormalities in processes subserving emotion processing and regulation. However, most neuroimaging studies on AB to date
only contain relatively small sample sizes. To objectively investigate the consistency of previous structural and functional
research in adolescent AB, we performed a systematic literature review and two coordinate-based activation likelihood estimation
meta-analyses on eight VBM and nine functional neuroimaging studies in a total of 783 participants (408 [224AB/184 controls]
and 375 [215 AB/160 controls] for structural and functional analysis respectively). We found 19 structural and eight functional
foci of significant alterations in adolescents with AB, mainly located within the emotion processing and regulation network
(including orbitofrontal, dorsomedial prefrontal and limbic cortex). A subsequent conjunction analysis revealed that functional
and structural alterations co-localize in right dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and left insula. Our results are in line with meta
analytic work as well as structural, functional and connectivity findings to date, all of which make a strong point for the
involvement of a network of brain areas responsible for emotion processing and regulation, which is disrupted in AB. Increased
knowledge about the behavioural and neuronal underpinnings of AB is crucial for the development of novel and implementation
of existing treatment strategies. Longitudinal research studies will have to show whether the observed alterations are a result or
primary cause of the phenotypic characteristics in AB.

Abstract. Neural correlates of the sentiment of fear.
The specific neural systems underlying the subjective feeling of fear are debated in affective
neuroscience. Here, we combine functional MRI with machine learning to identify and
evaluate a sensitive and generalizable neural signature predictive of the momentary selfreported subjective fear experience across discovery (n = 67), validation (n = 20) and
generalization (n = 31) cohorts. We systematically demonstrate that accurate fear prediction
crucially requires distributed brain systems, with important contributions from cortical (e.g.,
prefrontal, midcingulate and insular cortices) and subcortical (e.g., thalamus, periaqueductal
gray, basal forebrain and amygdala) regions. We further demonstrate that the neural
representation of subjective fear is distinguishable from the representation of conditioned
threat and general negative affect. Overall, our findings suggest that subjective fear, which
exhibits distinct neural representation with some other aversive states, is encoded in
distributed systems rather than isolated ‘fear centers’.

Discovery (a) and validation (b) cohorts underwent two similar but not identical fear induction and rating paradigms during fMRI acquisition. Of note, examples of the fear-evoking photos are pictures only for display purposes and not included in the original stimulus set. The pictures have been obtained from pixabay.com under the Pixabay License, and are free for commercial and noncommercial use across print and digital. c depicts the analytic stages and datasets used in the present study. Specifically, a wholebrain multivariate pattern predictive of the level of subjective experience of fear was trained on the discovery sample (n = 67) using support vector regression and further evaluated in discovery (cross-validated), validation (n = 20), and generalization (n = 31) cohorts. We next systematically applied univariate and multivariate analyses to determine the spatial scale and local contributions of specific regions to the momentary subjective fear representation. Finally, we tested whether subjective fear was encoded with a neural signature that was distinct from the representation of conditioned threat (CS+ versus CS− cues) and general negative affect. GLM general linear model, SVR support vector regression, VIFS visually induced fear signature developed in the current study, AFSS animal fear schema signature developed by Vincent Taschereau-Dumouchel and colleagues, TPS threatpredictive signature developed by Reddan and colleagues, PINES pictureinduced negative emotion signature developed by Luke Chang and colleagues.

Bhujangancita Karaṇa
The Siras is in Ancita bent to the left. The Parsva is in Nata on left
and Samunnata on right. Urah [uras] seems to be in Sama. Kati is
in Udvahita on the right with the leg raised. Right Uru is thrown up on
left side in Nivartana, right Janu is in Unnata,
right Jangha is in Ksipta, right Pada is in Kuncitam [Kuncita]. Left leg
is in Ardhakuncita and left Pada is in Sama turned to the side. The
right hand is in front of the chest ready to make a Recita movement
and the left hand is stretched out in Lata Hasta. This belongs to
the Bhujangatrasita family with a variation.
This can be classified as Bhujangancita - Karana no. 40 according to
whose description “The feet are in Bhujangatrasita Cari with right hand in Recita and the left in Lata.” The name suggests that it can be
performed with serpentine bends. We can also use Aviddhavaktra
Hasta for performing this as it brings out serpent like movement of the
hands. We can call this as a variation of Bhujangatrasita and use
the Cari for the leg movement in the same way. Figure 79

kalyan97@gmail.com 24
Unmatta Karaṇa; unmatta ‘haughty’
Siras is in Udvahita (looking up to left as if in pride), Parsva is in Nata on
right and Samunnata on left side. Urah [uras] is in Udvahita, Kati is
in Udhavahita on the right side. The whole torso is bent to the left as if he is
moving forward left side. Right leg is straight without a bend at the knee.
Right Uru is in Stambhana, right Janu is in Sama, right Jangha is unbent and
right Pada is also in Sama. The left foot is raised. The left Pada is in Ancita,
left Jangha is in Udvahita, left Janu is in Unnata, left Uru is in Nivartana.
Hands are in front of the chest as if being moved out–we can say
performing Recita.
This movement fits into the description of Unmata - Karana no. 14 according
to whose description “The feet are to be in Ancita and the hands
perform Recita.” According to Abhinavagupta, Ancita is explained
as Avidha Cari. The foot lands in Ancita. This seems to be a slight variation of
the typical Avidha. Figure 76

Siras is in Nihancita.Urah [uras] is
in Nirbhugna. Parsva and Kati are straight, Uru is
in Stambhana, Janu is in Sama, Jangha is unbent and
straight, Pada are Sama.
This can be identified as Lina according to whose
description, “After making
the Urdhvamandala movement, the hands take
the Anjali pose on the chest. The humps of the
shoulders are raised in Nihancita in which the neck is
bent down.”

Ancita Karaṇa
The Siras is in Nihancita, Urah [uras] is in Sama. Shoulders are slightly
raised, Kati is not raised or bent, both Janu are bent in Ardhakuncita, The
right Jangha is in Avartita, Pada are in Svastika.Right hand is
in Pataka and left hand seems to be in Musti. Seem to be
having Vyavartita and Parivartita wrist movements. Both the Pada are
in Sama.
This can be identified as Karana 23 of the Natya Sastra which is Ancita.
The Natya Sastra does not mention the usage of any specific Cari.
According to Abhinavagupta in this Karana, “Karihasta which is used
in Ardhasvastika Karana, is put near the nose
in Alapallava Hasta with Vyavartita Hasta Karana We can use the stance in
coordination with Ancita Pada. Then this is Ancita Karana.It is used to
express sentence indicating excitement or introspection.” Usage of Ancita
Pada and moving the other leg appropriately gives rise to Svastika of the
feet. Figure 34

Urdhvajanu Karaṇa In this dancing sculpture the Siras is in Ancita (bent to
left), Parsva is in Nata on left side and Samunnata (raised
slightly on right), Urah [uras] is in Sama, Kati is Udvahita on the
right side, right Janu is in Unnata, right Jangha is in Udvahita,
right Pada is in Kuncita. Left Janu is in Ardhakuncita,
left Jangha is in Nata, left Pada is in Sama. Right hand is
hanging loose in Lata. Left hand is in Katakamukha near the
chest. The Cari can be identified as Urdhvajanu and
the Karana also as Urdhvajanu Karana (no. 25). While
this Karana is performed the hand which is on the side of the
raised leg is stretched out in Lata and the other hand is kept at the
chest in Katakamukha.As the legs are lifted alternately the hands
also change the positions.
According to the Natya Sastra, “When the foot is raised to the
chest level in Kuncita along with suitable actions of the hand,
then it is called Urdhvajanu.” The Urdhvajanu Cari is performed
by throwing up a Kuncita foot and its knee to the level of the
breast keeping the other foot motionless and then the second foot
is thrown up and the first is kept motionless. Figure 35



16-02-2022 https://dcpune.academia.edu/SrinivasanKalyanaraman/Papers
kalyan97@gmail.com 28
The Siras is in Udvahita (lifted up as if in pride), right side Parsva is
raised in Sannata and left side in in Nata, the hands are
performing Nrtta Hasta - Dandapaksa with a slight variation of the
left hand which is pointing to the head. Kati is Udvahita on left side.
Right Uru is raised, right Janu is in Unnata, right Jangha is
in Ksipta–the leg is thrown like a stick. Left Janu is in Ardhakuncita,
left Jangha is in Nata, left Pada is in Sama and is in Parsva.
The above dancing figure is performing the Dandapada Cari in
which, “The foot in Nupurapadika Cari is to be stretched and then
quickly to turn.” This can be identified
as Dandapada Karana (no.82). According to the Natya Sastra,
“After performing Nupura Cari, Dandapada Cari should be done
and Avidha hand should be shown quickly.” Avidha meaning the
hand should be moved inwards immediately.
This Karana when performed continuously gives a very majestic
appearance. The hands which are thrown out have the appearance of
a stick or Danda. The hands move in the opposite side of the legs as
seen in the photograph. Figure 36 Variant Figure 89

Garudapluta Karaṇa In the above sculpture the Siras is in Ancita, bent to right. Urah
[uras] is raised in Udvahita, Parsva is in Nata on right side
and Samunnata on left, Kati is in Udvahita on right side. Right hand is
in Lata and left hand is in Recita, right Uru is in Udvartana,
right Janu is in Unnata, right Jangha is in Parivrtta, right Pada is
in Kuncita. Left Janu is in Ardhakuncita, left Jangha is in Nata,
left Pada is in Sama and Parsva. The extent of the bend of the leg
backwards which is shown in the sculpture is difficult to do unless one
is trained in such movements like acrobatics. Such deep bends can be
seen in ballet and circus acrobatics.
According to the Natya Sastra, “If the leg is backwards and the hands
are in Lata and Recita respectively it can be identified
as Garudapluta Karana.”
This is Karana no.70. According to Abhinavagupta also, “The foot is
in Vrscika, one hand should be in Lata and the other hand in Recita and
should be used accordingly as the name indicates.”
This Karana indicates the flying of Garuda in the sky. Garuda means
the mighty eagle which is also the Vahana of Visnu. Figure 37

Krantaka Karaṇa
Siras is in Ancita. Urah [uras] is in Nirbhugna. Parsva is
in Nata on right and Samunnata on left. Kati is in Udvahita on
right. The right foot is in Agratalasancara and is slightly behind
the left. The left Pada is in Sama and Parsva. Both the Janu are
in Ardhakuncita.The right hand is lifted up and could be
doing Recita. The left hand is already brought down and is in
front of the chest in Lata. The right foot seems ready for a
movement. The dancer seems to be performing Atikranta Cari.
The bend to the left side suggests this. From the figure we can
say that the movement is being executed from Mandala Sthana.
This can be identified as Karana no.51 which is Krantaka in
which, “Atikranta Cari is performed with a Kuncita foot. The
hand is stretched out from the body with Vyavartita and thrown
down with Parivartita and rests in Katakamukha at the chest .”
Figure 38

Vidyudbhranta ‘reeling’ Karaṇa
In this dancing sculpture Siras is lifted to one side
in Udvahita. Urah [uras] is in Udvahita, Parsva is
in Samunnata on left and Nata on right. Kati is in Udvahita on
right. Right Pada is in Kuncita, right Uru is in Udvartana,
right Janu is in Unnata, right Jangha is in Parivrtta. Left Pada is
in Sama, left Jangha is in Nata, left Janu is in Ardhakuncita,
left Uru is turned out.
This dancer seems to be performing
the Vidyudbhranta Cari which is an “Akasa Cari where one foot
is circled back and stretched so as to touch its top part and then
the head is moved in a circle.” This can be classified
as Vidyudbhranta Karana which is the 65th Karana of
the Natya Sastra according to which, “The foot is turned
backwards and the hands in Mandalavidha (circling inwardly)
gesture is stretched close to the head.” “Bhrantam
[Bhranta] means turning around quickly which gives momentum
to perform the next action which involves quick lifting of the leg
near the head.” Figure 39

kalyan97@gmail.com 32
Mandala Sthana Karaṇa
This is an interesting posture where
identification of a Cari or a Karana could prove
to be difficult. The Siras is in Sama, Urah
[uras], Parsva and Kati are in Sama, the dancer
is in deep Mandala Sthana, Pada are
in Parsva, Janu are in Ardhakuncita, Jangha are
in Nata. The hands are held in the chest region
but the Hasta is not clear—seems Pataka with
the palms facing up (Uttana). This figure could
be a transition stage for the next movement or
the starting point of a movement. Figure 40

Aksiptarecita Karaṇa
The left hand is near the chest, the right hand is thrown out
in Recita, Siras is in Udvahita -turned to side and lifted up
looking at the raised hand, the Parsva is in Nata on left
and Samunnata on right, Urah [uras] is in Udvahita, Kati is
in Udvahita on right, right leg is thrown out and raised to the
level of the shoulder, right Pada is in Kuncita,
right Jangha is in Ksipta, right Janu is in Unnata, right Uru is
raised. Left leg is straight and unbent. Left Uru is in Stambhana,
left Janu is in Sama, left Jangha is unbent.
This fits into the description of Karana Aksiptarecita -which
is Karana no. 20 in which “One leg is thrown out in the side
with the hand doing Recita. Then Apavidha is performed and
this hand is brought near the chest again.” “Apavidha is the
movement of the arm where it proceeds out from the region of
the chest with a circular movement.” Figure 41

Talasamsphotita Karaṇa
Siras in in Ancita, slightly bent towards right, Urah
[uras], Kati and Parsva are in Sama. The dancing
figure is in Mandala Sthana. Feet are in Parsva. The
hands are holding Puspaputa Hasta at the chest but
bent down. The hands seem to be ready to clap.
This can be described as Talasamsphotita which
is Karana 69 according to which, “The leg is swiftly
lifted and dropped and the two hands clap
simultaneously.” According to Abhinavagupta, “The
leg that is lifted in Atikranta or Dandapada Cari is
made Aksipta and dropped ahead, while striking
the Pataka Hasta with both hands against each other,
to produce a sound.” After the destruction of
the Tripurantakas, Lord Siva is known to have
danced clapping his hands. Hence this movement can
be used to depict this in dance. Figure 42

Ardharecita Karaṇa In this sculpture Siras is in Ancita, Urah
[uras] in Sama, Kati is in Udvahita on right, the body is
bent to left side. Both the hands are near the chest, the right
hand palm is facing up perhaps in Sucimukha and the left
hand seems to be holding Katakamukha Hasta. The right
foot is in Agratalasancara and the left foot is in Sama and
in Parsva. The dancer is executing the movement
from Mandalasthana and the right foot seems to be
performing Nikuttita movement. The right hand seems
ready for a movement like Recita.
This can be classified as Karana 12 which
is Ardharecita where, “The hand in Sucimukha gesture to
move freely, feet to move alternately up and down and side
in Sannata (i.e. Nata) pose.” The bend of the body to left
and upturned right palm further suggest a movement
like Recita. The Agratalasancara foot indicates
an Udghattita movement of the foot. The right hand is also
ready to move out in Apaviddha. Figure 43

Nikuttaka Karaṇa The Siras is very slightly bent towards the right in Ancita,
the Parsva is slightly lifted on right in Samunnata, Nata on left
very slightly, Urah [uras] is in Udvahita, Kati is in Udvahita on
right, right hand is raised up on the side near the head
in Alapallava, left hand is near chest very clearly in Caturasra.
The figure is executing the movement from Mandala Sthana,
right Pada is in Agratala–performing a movement
like Udghattita, left Pada is in Parsva.
This fits into the description of Karana 9 - Nikuttaka. According
to Abhinavaguptacharya, “Having stood in Mandala Sthana, the
hands are put in Caturasra.Then having put the hand
in Udvestita Hasta Karana, shoulder and head is tapped. The
same foot (left or right) is made Udghattita. The left hand then
again is made Caturasra with the Avidhavakravartana. At the
same tim e the other side should be raised and brought down as
told above. This is the application.” Here we can see the
right Pada making an Udghattita movement and the right hand
is near the head ready for the up and down movement. The other
hand is held at the chest in Caturasra.Once the other hand
comes back to the chest the left hand will perform the
movement on its side. Figure 44

Parsvanikuttaka Karaṇa
In this figure the Siras is bent to right in Ancita. Body is
leaning to the left, right side Kati is
in Udvahita, Parsva seems to be in Nata on right
and Samunnata on left. The dancer is performing the
movement from Mandala Sthana. The right foot is
in Agratalasancara and is slightly behind the left foot. The
bend of the body suggests a movement like Udghattita.
The hands are crossed near the chest in Pataka to the right.
This kind of a bend of the body and leg position suggests
a Nikuttita movement of the legs i.e. alternately
doing Udghattita. The hands suggest a movement
like Pallava wherein the hands are moved up and on the
sides in Pataka, till the head and then turned back and
crossed at the chest. This
involves Vyavarta and Parivarta movement of the hands.
Can be identified as Karana 49
Parsvanikuttaka according to whose description,
“Svastika hands held close to the sides and the legs to be
in Nikuttaka.” Figure 45

Katicchinna Karaṇa
Siras is in Ancitas lightly bent to the left. Parsva is in Nata on
left and Samunnata on right. Kati is raised on right and is
showing a movement like Chinna. The hands are in front of the
chest–the right one in Caturasra and the left one seems to be
in Pallava. The posture is Mandala Sthana though not deep
seated, feet are in Tryasra. The bend of the body to left and raise
of the hips on the right side indicate the turn.
This can be identified as Karana 11 i.e. Katicchinna. The bend of
the Kati shows that the body is ready for a turn. Abhinavagupta
explains, “The movement begins with
an Atikranta Cari followed with a Brahmari through Chinna of
waist.” Since the Natya Sastra doesn”t mention Atikranta, this
can be performed in both ways with or without Atikranta Cari.

Avahitthaka Karaṇa
The dancer is in Avahittha Sthana. The left foot is
in Sama and the right foot is in Tryasra. The right leg is
also kept at ease with a slight bend of the Janu.
Left Kati is in Udvahita. The body is slightly bent to the
right side. Urah [uras] and Siras seem to be in Sama. The
hands are in front of the chest in Alapallava.
Can be grouped as Karana no 95–Avahitthaka in which,
“The Janita Cari is performed with the fingers of the
hand first facing each other and then gradually lowered.”
In Janita Cari the foot is to be moved in Agratala, the
other foot is in Samapada and one hand is in Musti near
the chest whereas the other is in Lata. But here the hands
are facing each other in Alapallava. The hands can move
from the region above the head or forehead to chest level.
Only the legs seem to correspond to Janita Cari. Figure

Lalatatilakam Karaṇa This sculpture looks more like a Yogic posture. The figure is on
the ground with legs stretched in either direction. Right leg is
straight without a bend in the knee. The right Pada is in Kuncita.
The body is bent on the left leg and touches it. The left leg is
placed above the head. The right hand is holding the left leg. The
left hand is placed near the chest and seems to be
in Suci or Katakamukha. It is difficult to identify the Karana.This
can be a variation of the Lalatatilakam [Lalatatilaka] which
is Karana no.50.
“In the Lalatatilakam Karana after
assuming Vrscika Karana a Tilaka or a mark is put on the
forehead with the great toe.” But here the dancer has gone
horizontal on the ground, her left leg is lifted back up but her
right hand is holding it instead of putting a mark on the forehead.
Since it cannot be identified as any other Karana we can call it as
a variation of Lalatatilakam [Lalatatilaka]. If the same figure is
made vertical then it gives the impression Lalatatilakam
[Lalatatilaka] but the leg is absolutely straight up and is being
held by the right hand. Such a movement can only be performed
by those who practise regular Yoga. Many of
the Karanas described by Bharata require deep flexibility of the
body and muscles. Figure 50

Viksipta Karaṇa
An amazing posture. The dancer is performing
the Dandapada Cari. The left foot is straight and unbent,
the Pada is in Sama, left Uru is in Stambhana, left Janu is
in Sama, left Kati is in Udvahita, the Urah [uras] seems to
be also in Sama considering the lift of the hand above the
head, Parsva is in Samunnata on left (raised), the whole
body is bent slightly to the right. Siras seems to be
in Sama. On the right the leg is lifted straight up to the
level of the head, right Janu is in Nata, right Jangha is
in Ksiptam [Ksipta]. Left hand is above the head touching
it and the right hand is in Musti near the chest. This is a
slight variation of the Dandapada Cari in which the throw
of the foot is correlated with Recita Nrtta Hasta.
This can be classified as Viksipta Karana which is no. 58
according to whose description, “The hands and feet are to
be thrown backward or sideways in the same direction.”

Apakranta Karaṇa
The Siras and Urah [uras] are in Sama, Kati is in Udvahita on the right. The right foot is
in Agratalasancara, Janu in Unnata, Jangha is Udvahita, the Uru seems ready to perform an Udvartana (hence the foot is a little forward), right hand is on the right Uru in Alapallava, left hand is near the chest in Musti or Katakamukha, left foot is in Sama, left Jangha is in Nata, left Janu is in Ardhakuncita, the body seems slightly bent to the left. The dancer seems to be performing the “Apakranta Cari in which the leg is moved inward in Valana, lifted and then turned out and dropped.” If so, this can be identified as Apakranta Karana which is no.79 of
the Natya Sastra in which, “Apakranta Cari is to be performed and the hands are to be moved in harmony.” Figure 52

Uromandala Karaṇa
In this sculpture the left foot crosses in the front and both
the feet are in Agratala. The hands are in front of the chest
and seem to be
doing Udvestita and Apavestita movements. Siras is
slightly bent to one side in Ancita.The hands seem to be
doing Uromandala Nritta Hasta. The movement is being
executed from Mandala Sthana.
This can be identified as Uromandala Karana which
is Karana no.54.
According to Abhinavagupta, “The feet are to be crossed
and released by Sthitavarta and Baddha Cari.” According
to the description of Sthitavarta,
“One Agratalasancara foot is drawn up to cross the other
and this movement must be repeated with the other foot
also.” According to description of Baddha Cari, “The
sideways movement of the thighs when two shanks are
crossed.” The Uromandala Hasta Karana has to be
synchronized with these leg movements to give rise to
the Karana Figure 53

Grdhravalinaka Karaṇa A beautiful sculpture. Left leg is bent backwards and seems above the ground. The right leg is folded balanced on the toes. It seems to be an intermediary position before the knees come down in Samasuci which is described in the text Abhinayadarpana. The back leg is lifted up like an eagle. The hands are stretched out in Lata but could be performing Garudapaksa. The Jangha of left leg is in Nata (bent) and that of right leg is in Parivrtta (lifted behind). Siras and Urah [uras] are in Sama.
This fits into the description of Grdhravalinaka - Karana no. 74
according to which, “One foot is stretched backwards and one knee is slightly bent and the two arms are stretched out.” This Karana is used to indicate fighting of great birds according to Sarngadeva. This posture can be assumed after making a bird like movement with Recita hands and the right leg lifted back in Vrscika. What we see here seems to be the final stage of the Karana.This Karana can depict the gliding movement and landing of the eagle. The above figure where the leg is close to the ground symbolically represents the landing. The spread out hands in Recita depict the wings. Once again a majestic pose which needs to be performed with great control. Figure 54

Sucividha Karaṇa
Siras, Urah [uras] and Kati are all in Sama. The right
hand is on Uru in Ardhacandra. Left hand is in front of the
chest in Musti or Katakamukha. The right foot is crossed
in front of left foot and is in Kuncita Pada. The left foot is
in Sama.
This can be identified as Sucividha - Karana no. 78
according to which, “One foot of Suci Cari is be put on
the heel of the other foot and the two hands–one
in Ardhacandra and the other in Katakamukha are put
respectively on the waist and chest.” This is indicative of
deliberation. Here in the above figure the right foot is
crossed in the front in Kuncita but the hands correspond to
the description. This seems to be the position where the
cross is being released after assuming Suci Pada. Figure

Bhramaraka Karaṇa
The Siras and Urah [uras] are in Sama. The right hand is in front of the
chest and left hand extended to the side. Both seem to be in Pataka but
obviously doing a rotatary movement doing Avestita/Udvestita. Parsva is
in Samunnata on left and Nata on right. The Kati is lifted on right. The
right Janu is slightly lifted (Unnata), right Jangha is in Avartita,
right Pada is in Agratala. Left Janu is in slight Ardhakuncita, left Jangha is
in Nata, left Pada is in Sama turned to the side. The figure of Siva is shown
performing a movement which is involving a front Svastika of the right leg.
The right foot is placed in Svastika in front of the left but is kept much ahead
than a normal Svastika and the body position is only slightly bent and not a
deep seated position. So obviously there is some kind of a turning movement
being performed. Also, the head is straight where as the torso seems turned.
This movement fits into the description of Bhramaraka Karana (no. 38) of
the Natya Sastra according to which, “The feet are
in Svastika through Aksipta Cari, hands are performing Udvestita movement
and the Trika is turned (referring to the lower torso or sacrum).” According
to Samgitaratnakara, “This Karana is performed to move around haughtily
and it can be repeated on both sides.” Figure 57

Catura Karaṇa
The figure of Siva is performing the movement from Mandala Sthana,
the right foot is in Agratala, the left Pada is in Sama and Parsva,
right Janu is in Unnata and right Jangha is raised slightly in Udvahita,
right Kati is also in Udvahita showing an Udghattita movement of the
right foot. The body is bent to the left due to the lift of the
right Kati. Siras is slightly bent to the left in Ancita. The left foot is
in Sama and turned to the side. Left Janu is Ardhakuncita, left Jangha is
in Nata. Left hand is in Catura and held down, right hand seems to be
in Alapallava near the head.
This fits into the description of Catura Karana (no.39) according to
which, “The left hand is in Ancita (Alapallava) and the right hand is
in Catura Hasta and the right foot is in Kuttita (Udghattita).” In this
figure the right leg is in Kuttita but the hands are opposite–right hand is
in Alapallava and left hand is in Catura. Could be a variation or suggests
the Kuttita movement can be done on both sides. Figure 58

Vrscikarecita Karaṇa
In this sculpture the right leg is beautifully bent backwards and
lifted up. The right Pada is in Kuncita. The right Uru is
in Udvartana, the right Janu is in Unnata, right Jangha is
in Parivrtta. Left Janu is in Ardhakuncita, left Jangha is in Nata,
left Pada is in Sama facing the side. The Parsva and Urah
[uras] are in Sama, Kati is lifted on the right side
(Udvahita). Siras seems to be in Ancita (bent to right side). The
hands are in Svastika in front of the chest in Pataka Hasta.
This posture fits into the description of Vrscikarecita which
is Karana no. 46 according to whose description in
the Natya Sastra, “The feet are in the position
of Vrscika meaning the feet are bent back like the tail of a
scorpion, the hands are initially in Svastika and then they
perform Recita after separation through Viprakirna. This Karana
Vrscikarecita is performed to show aerial movement like flying.”

Vartita Karaṇa
This dancing figure is in Ayata Sthana–the right foot is
in Sama and the Janu is unbent and is in Sama, right Uru is
in Stambhana. Left leg is at ease, left Janu is slightly bent,
right Jangha is in Nata, right Pada is kept in Tryasra. Siras is
in Ancita,
Urah [uras] is in Sama, right Kati is in Udvahita. The hands are in
front of the chest and seem to be doing a Vyavartita/
Parivartita movement.
This can be identified as Karana no.2–Vartita according to which,
“The hands are made to fall on the thigh after performing the Vyavartita and Parivartita.” This is the position before the
hands are moved to fall on the thighs. Figure 61

Cakramandala Karaṇa Seems like a Yogic exercise where the body is bent backwards and
the Siras is touching the floor. The feet are lifted up on the toes to
support the backward bend. The hands seem to be in motion ready to
land on floor to support. The abdomen is facing the sky. This seems to
be a somersault like movement.
This fits into the description of the Karana 53 which
is Cakramandala according to whose description, “After doing
the Addita Cari the hands are let down fully and the body is curved
inwards.” “This is used in vigorous movements and in worship of
gods,” says Sarngadeva. This is a very difficult Karana to perform and
should be done under proper guidance or it can lead to injury of the
back.
If we consider the Karana to be a dynamic movement and not a
posture then this movement of wheel like somersaults has to be
repeatedly performed like an acrobatic feat. The body of the dancer
seems to be making the somersault movements backwards. Such
movements are more seen in martial arts or circus feats rather than
graceful dancing. Such movement can be performed with forceful
dancing and can be done with a lot of practise under a trained teacher.
