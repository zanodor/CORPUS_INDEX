The Tower Of Babel And The Indus Script
Abstract
The Indus script is a form of logographic writing used by the vedic people.
Studies in comparative religion has opened up many of its secrets.We have
already seen how it was used to develop stories in religious literature across
the ancient world.The Tower of Babel(Bab-el;bhav-el;bhavana-house,savana
sunrise;vaasa-house,vaaca-bhaasha-speech,bhaasa-light,bha-sun,star,aasa
seat,house,face , ) is one such incident from the Bible. Bhasha(languge)
denote bhasa(light,shine; bhata-pratar-dawn). The Tower of Babel , was a
structure built in the land of Shinar (Sumer/Babylonia) some time after
the Deluge. The Tower of Babel (Hebrew: מִ גְ דַּ ל בָּ בֶ ל , Mīgdal Bāḇel) narrative
in Genesis 11:1–9 is an origin myth and parable meant to explain why the world's
peoples speak different languages.

According to the story, a united human race speaking a single language and
migrating eastward, comes to the land of Shinar ( שִ נְ עָּר ). There they agree to



build a city and a tower with its top in the sky. Yahweh, observing their city and
tower, confounds their speech so that they can no longer understand each
other, and scatters them around the world.
Some modern scholars have associated the Tower of Babel with known
structures, notably the Etemenanki, a ziggurat dedicated to
the Mesopotamian god Marduk in Babylon. A Sumerian story with some
similar elements is told in Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta.
Biblical story
Now the whole earth had one language and the same words. And as they
migrated from the east, they came upon a plain in the land of Shinar and
settled there. And they said to one another, "Come, let us make bricks and
fire them thoroughly." And they had brick for stone and bitumen for
mortar. Then they said, "Come, let us build ourselves a city and a tower with
its top in the heavens, and let us make a name for ourselves; otherwise we
shall be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth." The LORD came
down to see the city and the tower, which mortals had built. And the LORD said,
"Look, they are one people, and they have all one language, and this is only the
beginning of what they will do; nothing that they propose to do will now be
impossible for them. Come, let us go down and confuse their language there,
so that they will not understand one another’s speech." So the LORD scattered
them abroad from there over the face of all the earth, and they left off building
the city. Therefore it was called Babel, because there the LORD confused
(balal) the language of all the earth, and from there the LORD scattered them
abroad over the face of all the earth.
— Genesis 11:1–9 NRSVUE[7]

In the Mahabharata ,Lord Srii KRshNa helped the Pandavas establish the city
of Indraprastha (indra-netra-parthiva-Pandava-king,prastha



city,prasada-tower,pradesa-place) in the east.Archeological evidence
shows that the Harappans were experts in brick-making and building
cities.They were united in speech by the vedic deva bhasha-Bharata.They
migrated from the East to Shinar , (Sumer/
