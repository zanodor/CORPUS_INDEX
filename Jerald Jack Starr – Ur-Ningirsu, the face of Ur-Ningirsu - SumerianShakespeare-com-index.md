Ur-Ningirsu
7-9 minutes
Ur-Ningirsu, ensi of Lagash, circa 2120 - 2113 B.C. See the complete
statue.
Ur-Ningirsu was the son of Gudea, the ensi (ruler, governor) of Lagash.

Gudea reigned during difficult and dangerous times. The Akkadian
Empire, which had ruled Sumer for 200 years, had been overrun by the
Gutians, nomadic tribesman from the north. The Gutians also
conquered parts of Sumer. Despite the political instability of the region,
Gudea managed to give his citizens twenty years of peace and prosperity.
The people of Lagash also enjoyed an artistic renaissance during his reign.
Gudea, the father of Ur-Ningirsu.
Judging by the realistic statue of Ur-Ningirsu (shown at the end of the
page) which was created near the end of Gudea's reign, Ur-Ningirsu was
just 21 years old when he ascended to the throne.
The "years names" of Ur-Ningirsu's reign:
The Sumerians did not have a single comprehensive calendar for the
entire nation. Instead, each city-state had its own individual calendar
based on the reign of its monarch. The years were not numbered (e.g.,
2013). Rather, each year was named for an important event that
occurred within it.
The year Ur-Ningirsu became governor

Year in which the high priestess of Iškur was chosen by means of the
omens
Year the throne bearer of the god Ningirsu was chosen
Year in which the city of Uruk was destroyed
The first thing noticeable about this list is the second year of Ur
Ningirsu’s reign, “the year after Ur-Ningirsu became governor”. Although
it wasn't unusual for a Sumerian year name to be titled “the year after” an
important event, this suggests there were no accomplishments in Ur
Ningirsu’s second year that were worthy of mention. By contrast, Gudea’s
second year was named “the year when the canal Ningirsu-ushumgal
(‘Ningirsu is a dragon’) was dug.”
Ur-Namma’s second year was "the year in which Ur-Namma the king
put in order the ways (of the people in the country) from below to above.”
The lack of any major accomplishments in Ur-Ningirsu’s second year may
be due to his youth and inexperience. He was quite young when he became
a king.
The other thing noticeable about the year names is the preponderance of
religious themes. Although Sumerian year names frequently mention
religion, in Ur-Ningirsu’s reign there is little mention of anything else.
There is no political agenda, such as “the year Ur-Namma made justice in
the land” or the year that he built a defensive wall around the city of Ur.
Notably absent from the year names of Ur-Ningirsu is a reference to major
building projects, like the digging of a canal, the construction of a new
temple, or the completion of a city wall. Also missing is any reference to
war. He was named for the god of war (Ningirsu), and his statue shows
humble emissaries at his feet offering him tribute, but there is no record of
him being involved in wars of foreign conquest or civil wars against other
Sumerian city-states. Although the year names indicate that Ur-Ningirsu
was deeply religious like his father, it seems likely that Ur-Ningirsu would
have added other non-religious year names (that dealt with war, politics,
and justice) had he lived longer.
This leads to the third thing noticeable about the list. It is a very short list.
Ur-Ningirsu reigned for only seven years. He was quite young when he
died.
There is some debate about the final year name, “the year in which the city
Ur-Ningirsu about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/70701/304301.html

of Uruk was destroyed” by the Gutians. Some scholars think it occurred
during the reign of Gudea rather than Ur-Ningirsu. In either case, it is a
significant event. Uruk was the city of Utu-hengal. His seven year reign is
roughly contemporaneous with that of Ur-Ningirsu. Along with his young
military governor, Ur-Namma, Utu-hengal won a major victory over the
Gutians, capturing
their king Tirigan and two of his generals. It was the beginning of
Sumerian independence
after two centuries of foreign domination. Even so, the Gutians continued
to be a threat.
Ur-Namma fought them again after he became the king of Ur; one of his
year names was
called, “the year Gutium was destroyed”. He would later die in combat in
yet another battle
with the Gutians.
Ur-Namma, the king of Ur.
If Uruk was defeated during the reigns of Gudea or Ur-Ningirsu it means
that Utu-hengal’s city was destroyed just before, or just after, his victory
over the Gutians. This raises a couple of interesting questions. If Utu
hengal’s city was destroyed beforehand, how did he manage to later defeat
the Gutians if he did not have a home base? If his city was destroyed after
his victory over the Gutians (and after his death), is this why Ur-Namma
Ur-Ningirsu about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/70701/304301.html

had to fight them again a second time? If so, this would mean that Uruk
was destroyed during the kingship of Ur-Namma, and not during the
reigns of Gudea or Ur-Ningirsu.
Ur-Namma and Ur-Ningirsu were about the same age. Growing up, they
were young
noblemen from neighboring city-states (although Ur-Namma was of a
lesser rank).
They lived only 40 miles apart, so it's reasonable to assume that they knew
each other.
They may have even been friends.
Lagash had always been one of the most important Sumerian city-states.
Evidence seems to suggest that it was preeminent during the reign of
Gudea as the Sumerians began to emerge from centuries of foreign
domination. Gudea himself was a very shrewd and successful king,
and Ur-Ningirsu was tutored during his entire life on the subtleties of
kingship and diplomacy. Ur-Ningirsu was poised to become one of the
great kings of Sumerian history, but his life was tragically cut short.
How did he die? Was it an accident or a disease? An accident seems a
likely explanation for the death of such a young man, although an early
Ur-Ningirsu about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/70701/304301.html

death by disease was always a possibility in the ancient world. Another
possibility is that he died in battle, in one of the many
unrecorded wars of the region, in an attempt to establish his credentials as
a strong and effective king. Although Ur-Ningirsu seems to have been a
pacifist like his father, even Gudea was known to have fought at least one
battle, “the year in which the city of Anšan was smitten by weapons”.
One more possibility remains: a coup d’état. At first, this would seem
unlikely. A coup d’état against the son of Gudea? Nonetheless, in
the seven years after his death there were five different ensis of Lagash.
This would suggest a mad scramble for power by numerous pretenders to
the throne, a sure sign of political upheaval, or possibly a bloody civil war.
However, it cannot be known with certainty if this was the result of a coup
d’état.
Ur-Namma, the king of Ur, soon became the the king of all of Sumer,
including Lagash.
Ur-Namma thus became the king of the Neo-Sumerian Revival, instead of
Ur-Ningirsu.
Unfortunately, given the vagaries of the ancient past, we may never know
why Ur-Ningirsu died so young. He was destined for greatness.
He was only 28 years old.

A realistic portrait of Ur-Ningirsu (Louvre, AO 4351). See The Face of
Ur-Ningirsu.
Here is a handsome, intelligent, and confident young man. He has a
quizzical, bemused expression. His character is not yet written on his
face, showing years of diligence and
strain, like the faces of Gudea and Ur-Namma. This is the face of a young
man at the
beginning of his life and career. This is how Ur-Ningirsu looked when he
became a king,
full of promise, his life a promise unfulfilled.

The face of Ur-Ningirsu
11-14 minutes
This is a statue in the Louvre Museum (AO 4351). It's described simply
as a "man with a shaven head”. It was found in the Sumerian city of Girsu
(modern Telloh). Girsu was the holy city of the kingdom of Lagash, home
of the E-ninnu, the temple of the war god Ningirsu. The statue is dated "in
the period of Gudea”, circa 2100 B.C. I believe the statue is not just

“some guy” with a shaven head. I would suggest that it is actually a
portrait of Ur-Ningirsu, the son of Gudea.
A statue of Ur-Ningirsu. See the complete statue.
Notice the similarity of the eyes and the shape of the nose. The shape of
the mouth on the statues is the same, with one side of the upper lip being
higher than the other side. Although the asymmetry of the mouth is
accentuated by the different colors of the stone on this statue,
it seems to be the same type of asymmetry that is shown on AO 4351.
The profile view is what first led me to believe that AO 4351 is a portrait of
the son of Gudea:

Notice how the tip of the nose, which appears to be rounded when viewed
from the front, is slightly squared off when viewed from the side. The
statues of Gudea have the same feature:

Gudea's nose likewise appears to be rounded when it is viewed from
the front and slightly squared off when viewed from the side. AO 4351 also
has the same flat cheek bones as Gudea. The similarity of the
profiles suggests that AO 4351 is Gudea's direct descendent.

AO 4351, when viewed in profile, has the same kind of nose as Gudea.
Notice how the profile also matches the statue of Ur-Ningirsu:
Believe it or not, this is also Ur-Ningirsu, as attested by the inscriptions on

the back. It is described as being done in the "Akkadian style" because a
ruler of Lagash is not usually shown with a beard and a full head of hair. I
would suggest that it is not an Akkadian style because the same figure,
probably Ur-Ningirsu himself, also shows up on Gudea's stele. It is
seen on the Rimush stele, which mentions Lagash, and is worn by the
soldiers being killed by the Akkadians. So it is Sumerian, not Akkadian. I
would further suggest that his "hair" is actually a helmet. It is quite thick,
covering the ears, back of the neck, and most of the forehead. It would be
impossible to duplicate this hairstyle in a modern beauty salon, and
it's doubtful that soldiers would go into combat with such a perfectly
coiffed hairdo. Since it looks like a helmet when viewed from the side and
it's worn by a soldier escorting a prisoner on Gudea's stele, it is most likely
a helmet rather than a hairstyle.
I believe this heavily damaged figure is also Ur-Ningirsu, even though it
was found in the city
of Nippur, and not in Ur-Ningirsu's home town of Lagash. The eyes and
nose match, and the shepherd's crown, with the stylized curls of lamb's
wool, is the kind worn by Gudea and
Ur-Ningirsu. Many Sumerian statues were vandalized or destroyed in the

many wars that occurred in the region.
There are a couple of differences between AO 4351 and the statue of Ur
Ningirsu:
Ur-Ningiru's nose is slightly sharper than AO 4351. Another difference
between the statues becomes apparent when they are placed side by side:
It seems that Ur-Ningirsu has a rounder face than AO 4351. That's because
the shape of the chin is different. On AO 4351 there is a lot more distance
The face of Ur-Ningirsu about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/259401.html
7 of 15 8/18/2020, 3:22 PM



between the bottom of the lower lip and the top of the chin, which makes
the face look longer (bear in mind that the two pictures are not shown at
the same scale.) Note, however, the over-all resemblance of the statues
except for a minor difference in the shape of the chin. Just for the fun of it,
I photographically altered the two pictures, shortening the chin on AO
4351 while slightly increasing the chin on the statue of Ur-Ningirsu,
in order to emphasize the similarities between the two statues.
Of the two, AO 4351 and the statue of Ur-Ningirsu, I would suggest that
AO 4351 is the more accurate and realistic portrait. This leads to an
additional reason to support the idea that AO 4351 is Ur-Ningirsu: It is
done in the same realistic style as another statue of Gudea.
There was an artistic renaissance in the kingdom of Lagash during the
reign of Gudea. This artistic development is most evident in the portraits
of the human face. Until then, Sumerian portraits had been very simple,
even crude, compared to modern standards. At the time of Gudea, human
portraits became more artistic, more stylized, and more realistic. The full
range of this artistic renaissance can be found in the statues of Gudea:

This statue is a generic depiction of
Gudea's facial features, typical of ancient royal portraiture. Even so, it is
more realistic than most other royal statues.

This statue of Gudea is highly
stylized, very abstract and artistic.
This statue is a "photo-realistic"
portrait of the face of Gudea. More images of the statue can be found in
The Barakat Gallery.
As explained in The Face of Gudea, this alabaster statue is the first
realistic, recognizable portrait of any man or king in all of history. This

10 of 15 8/18/2020, 3:22 PM



kind of realism was unprecedented in royal statuary. Part of this realism is
based on the slight asymmetry of the facial features. It seems
that the artisans of Lagash were the first to realize that people's facial
features are seldom completely symmetrical. The left and right eyes are
not exactly the same size. The nose has an irregular shape.
Notice the slight asymmetry of the eyes, nose, and mouth, making this
portrait more realistic and therefore more recognizable as a distinct
individual. It is done in the same realistic style as the statue of Gudea
shown above. The other statue of Ur-Ningirsu is a generic portrait
of "The King". AO 4351 is a realistic portrait of Ur-Ningirsu, the man. It
appears to be a younger version of Ur-Ningirsu, so perhaps it was
commissioned when Gudea was still alive, as a portrait of the
heir apparent. Then again, it might have been created when Ur-Ningirsu
became a king in his own right, making a realistic statue of himself like his
father had done.
If AO 4351 and the statue of Ur-Ningirsu do not exactly match in all their
details, it's because one statue is generic and the other is realistic.
I would suggest that AO 4351 is the true face of Ur-Ningirsu, as opposed to
the generic representation of him as "The King", in the same way that the
realistic Barakat Gudea is the true face of Gudea behind the other more
generalized portraits of him.

There is only one other Sumerian statue that was done in this same
realistic style. It is the statue of Ur-Namma in the Met Museum. Ur
Namma's facial features were very asymmetric.
See The Face of Ur-Namma.
Ur-Namma.
The reign of Ur-Ningirsu (circa 2120 - 2113 B.C.) is bracketed squarely in
the middle between the reign of Gudea (2140 - 2120 BC) and the reign of
Ur-Namma (2112 - 2094 BC). Although it is reasonable to assume that
other realistic statues were created by other Sumerian kings
before the end of Sumerian civilization in 2004 B.C., none have yet been
found. These three realistic statues are the only Sumerian examples
known to exist. This realistic style began during the reign of Gudea and it
ended soon afterwards. This realism wouldn't be seen again
until more than fifteen centuries later, at the time of the Greeks and the
Romans.
Additional proof that AO 4351 is the son of Gudea is the fact that it is
craved in diorite stone. Diorite was very expensive because it had to be
imported from a great distance and because the hard stone was difficult
and time-consuming to carve. It was therefore most often used for
portraits of royalty.

12 of 15 8/18/2020, 3:22 PM



A colleague recently sent me an email pointing out the fact that Gudea had
another son
besides Ur-Ningirsu. There is a ceremonial mace head with the
inscription: "(For) Gudea, the ruler of Lagash, (from) Lugal-agrig-zi, the
scribe, his son." This is the only reference to
Lugal-agrigzi, but it raises the possibility that AO 4351 is the younger
brother of Ur-Ningirsu. This could account for the slight difference in the
shape of the nose and chin. AO 4351 does seem to have the "sensitive and
artistic" demeanor of a scribe rather than the kingly visage of Ur-Ningirsu.
However, this could be due to the different purposes of the statues – one
to show The King, the other to show the man, the way he would appear in
person, in real life. As previously stated, the differences in the nose and
chin can be accounted for by the fact that one statue is generic and the
other is realistic.
Gudean statues.
It's possible that Gudea had several other sons that we don't know
about. For instance, there is a chlorite statue (which the Louvre has
mistakenly labeled as a "man", though it is actually a boy) that may be
Gudea's son or grandson. There are many statues from Girsu
that are probably Gudea's sons or members of his extended family,
The face of Ur-Ningirsu about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/259401.html
13 of 15 8/18/2020, 3:22 PM



but none of these statues are done in the same realistic style as AO 4351.
A realistic, life-size diorite statue indicates that it's a king or an heir
apparent rather than a younger son of lesser importance. Another
indication that it's a portrait of a king or heir apparent is the high quality
of the workmanship. Only the best artists available were used for this
statue and for the realistic portrait of Gudea (perhaps it was the same
sculptor). The other statues lack this high level of artistry. I would
suggest that Lugal-agrigzi is one of the other statues. AO 4351 is Ur
Ningirsu because it is clearly more important than the others.
There can be no doubt about the identification of Gudea in the Barakat
Gallery or Ur-Namma in the Met Museum. That's because there
are many known statues of Ur-Namma and Gudea so we can make
multiple comparisons of their facial features. The identification of
AO 4351 is problematic because there is only one known image of Ur
Ningirsu. It remains to be seen if another statue of Ur-Ningirsu will
eventually be found that confirms the identity of AO 4351. Perhaps a
statue of Lugal-agrig-zi will also be found. AO 4351 is definitely a son of
Gudea, and most of the evidence points to Ur-Ningirsu, but the readers
should decide for themselves if the statue is Ur-Ningirsu, Lugal-agrigzi, or
another son of Gudea.

Note: 12/20/2015. I found another statue. See The Face of Lugal-agrig-zi.
In the meantime, here is a summary of the reasons indicating
that AO 4351 is the portrait of Ur-Ningirsu:
1) It was found in the city of Girsu.
2) It is in the right time period, "the period of Gudea". This is a very
narrow window of time.
3) The nose matches that of Gudea, which is rounded when viewed from
the front but slightly squared off when view from the side. The flat cheek
bones also match. This would suggest a direct descendant of Gudea.
4) The eyes, nose, and mouth are similar to the statue of Ur
Ningirsu. They match in both the front and profile views. The only
exception is a minor difference in the shape of the chin.
5) It is done in the same realistic style as the statue of Gudea in the
Barakat Gallery.
6) It is carved in diorite stone, usually reserved only for royalty.
7) The high artistic quality of AO 4351 means it is a portrait of the king
or the heir apparent.
For the identity of a royal portrait in the period of Gudea, done in the
realistic style of Gudea, the best available choice is:
Ur-Ningirsu, the son of Gudea.
