A short introduction into the Miracle Stag motif of the Hungarian history
The deer is probably the most common motif in the animalstyle art of the steppe nomads and was important in other cultures as well. The Greeks told of a hind or deer with golden antlers, and Hungarian Mediaeval chronicles and folklore included tales of a stag with golden antlers. One of the main concerns of Hungarian historic research has been the interpretation of the famous story of the Miracle Stag, which, in its many details, relates the conquest of the Carpathian Basin by the tribal organization of Prince Arpad around the end of the ninth century AD. The pursuit of the fleeing stag or hind, as a part of a mythical scene, was the late descendant of an originally Proto-Iranian/lndo-Iranian and, in its later variant a ScythianGreek, motif. A great Hungarian scholar, Andras Alfoldi, once in terpreted it as a saga c>f the tribal ancestry, symbolicly represen ting the origin of the Arpadian tribal organization and its conquest of the Carpathian Basin, in 896 AD.*1This military event, according to the orthodox theory, would signify an extraordinary period in Hungarian protohistory: the introduction of the Hungarian language into the Carpathian Basin. It is well known that there are two alternative accounts or theories o f Hungarian origins represented in Academic circles of this country: a. one which says, that the 894-896 conquest of the Car pathian Basin by the Turkic folk of Arpad (the 'Honfoglalas’ i.e. 'Landtaking’) occurred simultaneously with the coming of the Hungarian language (of Finno-Ugric origin). According to this

view, the seven or eight Turkic tribes of Arpad had spoken 'magyar’ from time immemorial or from their assimilation/admixture by Hungarian speaking groups, somewhere in the steppe, between the 3-4. and 9. centuries AD. In the second case, Arpad’s folk originally had a Turkic ethnic, speaking a Turkic tongue, and having Turkic ethnic traits exclusively.2 Foreign scholars have shown themselves increasingly tolerant of the first variant i.e. that the Turkic people of Arpad had spoken Finno-Ugric 'magyar’ from time immemorial, even if they have not been particularly active in formulating similar theories for themselves.3 b. There is emerging another view, which was first co ceived on archaeological facts, being a more realistic interpre tation of extant historic or very rare protohistoric sources. This says that the shift of the Hungarian language into the Carpathian Basin was a result of populous folk movements well before 896 and can be connected to the Avarian conquests of the Carpathian Basin in the last quarter of the 6th (i.e. 567-568), and again, of the 7th century AD (in the latter case around and following 670). Both (i.e. Early and Late) Avarian conquering warrior groups partly consisted of surviving Hunnic tribes or their dispersed remains, as their tribal names indicate: var-chunni (varkony in Hungarian place-names) of the Early Avarians, and the Seven Tribes (the TLiaa ysveai in Byzantine sources) o f the Onogurs/Unnugurs, i.e. the ruling clans of the Late Avarian society. There were also Iranian, i.e. Alanian warriors in their ranks.4
2 For a detailed discussion of this Turkic theory see J. Makkay 2005a, passim, with a list of 90 ethnic traits which exlusively show a Turkic origin and tongue of Arpad and his folk. For a short summary in English see my somewhat outdated paper: J. Makkay: Dating Hungarian.An overview. In: J. Makkay: A magyarsag keltezese. 2nded., Szolnok, 1994, 199-228. 3Renfrew 1987, 70, 163 and 204. - Renfrew 2002, 470. - Comrie 2002, 412 and 416-417. —van Driem 2002, 240. - For the Turkic ethnic character of the people of Arpad see Makkay 2005a. 4 The presence of Iranian (Alanian) folk groups within the ranks of the Avarians is amply demonstrated by the occurrence of typical Iranian dragon representations applied on Avarian belt fittings: P. Grof: Uber eine awarenzeitliche Drachendarstellung. A Mora Ferenc Muzeum Evkonyve, Szeged, 1984-185 (published 1991), 321-334, Figs. 1-2. See Fig. on p. 50. For its Iranian and other, Turkic-Mongolic, parallels, see ibid. 8



The broad outlines of this second concept were given by Gyula Laszlo, unfortunately without a detailed demonstration, in order to bring historic evidence and archaeological data together. This lack of demonstration is probably the reason that his outstanding, but not well elaborated, theory has not fully opened our historians’ and archaeologists’ eyes as yet.
***
In its presently known form, the oldest version of the mythic story of the Huns about the Miracle Stag was recorded by Jordanes and Procopius,5 but much of it was taken over from the works of Eunapius and Priscus,6 written around, and after, the middle of the 5th century AD (433/434, and 474). Jordanes wrote to the effect, that
“According to the historian Priscus, this savage tribe [i.e. the Huns] lived on the further shore o f the Maeotie marsh, practising only hunting and no other form o f labour except that when they increased in numbers, they harassed the neighbouring peoples with treachery and rapine. Hunters from this tribe, who, as was their custom, were seeking game along their shore o f Maeotis, noticed a hind Icerva} which suddenly appeared to them, entered the marsh and, now moving ahead and now waitingfor them, led them along a path. This the hunters followed and crossed on foot the Maeotie marsh which they thought to be as impassable as a sea. Soon the land o f Scythia, which was unknown to them, came into view, and the hind disappeared. I believe that those spirits, o f whom the Huns were engendered, did this out o f hatredfor the Scythians. The hunters, who were completely unaware that there was another world beyond Maeotis, were seized with wonder at the land o f Scythia and, concluding that the way, which was utterly
5Jordanes: Getica 24,123-126. - Procopius: Bella 8,5,4, and 7-12. 6According to Blockley, “the Priscan digression on the Hunnic crossing of Lake Maeotis, which Jordanes preserves, could have been part of a preliminary survey which was prepared for the accession of Attila in or around 434”: Blockley 1981, 50. —Zosimus, Sozomen and Philostorgius made considerable use of Eunapius for the period 270-404: Ibid. 97-99. Very probably, Eunapius’ sixth book contained the description of the digression of the Huns (Blockley 1981, 104, and note 51). According to Moravcsik (Moravcsik 1914, 281-293 and 333-334), the story was first recorded by Eunapius in the first decades of the 5th Century, and was later also (independently) written down by Priscus. 9



unknown to any age before theirs, had been revealed to them by a divine-power (since they were knowledgeable o f such things), returned to their own people. They related what they had done, praised Scythia and, having won over their tribe, led them to Scythia by the route which the hind had revealed to them."1
Around 1280 AD, the Hungarian chronicler Simon de Keza’s narrative of the same story, with some minor differences, was probably based on this text of Jordanes, even if he added details to it from other sources particularly from folk poetry, songs of rhapsodes, etc. Other sources clearly show, that the story was an important part of the folk beliefs of the Arpadian tribes of Turkic origin. Two Hungarian scholars, J. Berze-Nagy and Gy. Moravcsik minutely studied the relations of Priscus’s story with the corre sponding details of the early Hungarian chronicles. Here I follow the summary made by Gy. Laszlo with minor additions and cor rections:*8 Simon de Keza (in Hungarian Kezai Simon), the chronicler of Ladislas IV, King of Hungary between 1272 and 1290, went as far back as the Bible, and made Menroth the Giant, Japheth’s progeny, the forefather of the Hungarians. Then, turning to the question of origin, he wrote:9
“Hunor [the Hun?] and Mogor [the Magyar?] were the first born children [of Menroth by Eneth\. They lived their life in tents separated from that o f their father. It happened that one day they had gone out hunting, and in a deserted place there appeared before them a hind [cerva], which they followed into the Maeotie marshes as it fled before them. It disappeared again, and though they sought itfor a long time, they couldfind it nowhere. Having at last searched the marshes thoroughly, they found that the place was suited for breeding herds. Therefore they returned to their father and having been granted his permission they went with all their goods to the Maeotie marshes, there to dwell and raise their herds. ... Issuing forth in the sixth year [of their stay in the Maeotis], they happened in a deserted place to come upon the

wives and sons o f the sons o f Belar, without any o f their menfolk. ... Quickly they fell upon them and carried them off with all their belongings to the Maeotie marshes. ... It happened also in that skirmish that besides the boys there were seized two daughters o f Dula, ruler o f the Alans, o f whom one was taken to wife by Hunor and the other by Mogor; and from these women have sprung all the Huns.''’
According to this source, all the Huns (probably speaking a Turkic tongue) sprung from Alanic (i.e. Iranian) women and later became Hungarians with their language of Finno-Ugric origin. Mo re realistically, the story can be seen as a speculative theory, reflecting racial and linguistic conditions of the Steppe, the mixing bowl or crossroad of Eurasia. The writer of the Illuminated (Vienna) Chronicle, during the reign of Louis the Great (king of Hungary from 1342 to 1482) added to the story by saying that the women were just celebrating the Feast of the Horn or Tuba, when the two brothers (Hunor and Mogor/Magor) abducted them.1012 These, and other, details belong to the so-called 'Traditional Hunnic lineage and Hunnic tradition’ of the Arpadian tribal confederacy, and especially of the Arpadian ruling family. The long survival of such traditions, the so-called Attila-belie/2 generally and equivocally denied by most Hungarian historians and archaeologists - can be proven by several historic sources and archaeological finds which have been neglected, or ignored, by Hungarian experts up to the present. In fact, an important part of the events, descriptions, places, battles, comments, etc., described
10Laszlo 1974, 96. - SRH 1:251: Anno vero Vl-omexeuntes, in deserto loco sine maribus in tabernaculis permanentes uxores ac pueros [filios] filiorum Berela, cum festum tube colerent et coreas ducerent ad sonitum simphonie, casu repererunt. —For the drinking horns of sacral use of dux Arpad and the first Hungarian kings (Saint Stephen and Saint Ladislas), see Makkay 2004, 22-26 and again Makkay 2005a, 12-1A. 11 It says in its extreme form that both the Hungarian (i.e. Arpadian) folk and its language is of Hunnic (i.e. Old Turkic) origin. 12 It simply states that Attila the Hun was one of the forefathers of Arpad. Arpad himself says in the Anonym Chronicle that he is a descendant of Attila: Dux autem Arpad ... legatione Salani respondit: Licet preavus meus, potentissimus rex Athila habuerit terram, que iacet in Danubium et Thysciam ... Anonymus cap. 14. SRH 1:53.

by our Mediaeval sources as parts of the Attila-belief, relates corresponding events of the Carolingian - Late Avarian period, i.e the time of the wars of Charlemagne against the Late Avarian chiefdom organization around the turn of the 8th and 9th Centuries AD.13 Here there should only be mentioned two archaeological data: the case of the famous Sword of Attila or Arpad, a characteristic sabre of Iranian (North Caucasian) type from the 9th Century AD, and the miraculous golden (Sassanian) bowl of the Arpad family. According to Hungarian royal sources (first of all an agreement between the Bohemian and the Hungarian king from 1270-1271), this golden (Sassanian) bowl originated from the time of Attila14 and had been kept in the Arpadian treasury since immemorial times.15 From the relevant sources, I mention the relations of the cult of St. Ladislas and his magic Silver Bowl with the Legend of the Gral,16 and the battle places between the Carolingian and Late Avarian army in 791, which appear as battle places of Attila and/or the Huns in the text of Simon de Keza.17 The literary treatment of the Hunnic Heritage and the Attila Belief by Simon de Keza was by no means a new idea, since extant sources from the 8th-12th centuries sufficiently prove that both ideas deeply rooted in the scholarly opinions of Late Carolingian, and later, historians and writers.18 Pragmatic writers, of course, interlinked or intermingled their correct data (on Charlemagne’s Avar wars) with the historically kept, but somehow faded, memory of the true Attila the Hun of the fifth Century AD. As a matter of fact, the Hunnic Heritage and the Attila Belief served as the basis for the national identity of the Mediaeval Hungarians, led by the ruling class of Arpadian (Turkic, or if somebody wants, Hunnic) origin. This Hunnic tradition originally was the tribal memory of the Arpadians as a people of Turkic origin but during the four centuries of their rule (i.e. between 896

See Makkay 1999, and also Makkay 2005, 9-20, with further literature. 15Makkay 1997, 42-48. 16Makkay 1998, 22-50, with further literature. 17Makkay 2005, 17-18. See also my Az Avar Attila.

and 1301) it became the common belief of the Hungarians. Similarly, nobody wants to dispute or deny that fully Gallicized Norman Conquerors had become English kings. It is also quite sure that the cultic role of the drinking horn or tuba (a metal, glass or horn tube) also belongs to similar, traditional, ’Hunnic-Avarian’ _lines. This belief was in general currency during the whole Arpadian Age, and enjoyed special popularity. The sacral role of the horn (some times as a drinking horn) was mentioned by the Illuminated Chronicle, telling the famous story about Arpad, the founder of the Arpadian dynasty19 and, at the same time, historic sources testily to the emblematic use of drinking horns (as a power symbol) by both Saint Stephen and Saint Ladislas, kings of Hungary in the 11th Century.20 Curiously enough, their silver drinking horns have their exact parallels only in finds found in Early and Late Avarian princely tombs, dating from the one and a half centuries between the burial of Khagan Kuvrat (around 660 AD) and the Late Avarian Period.21 The Avarian periods between 567 and 803 represent the rule of Hunnic ([a\varchunny = Early Avarians) and Onogur-Hunnic leading tribes in the Carpathian Basin, as mentioned above. The same can be said - I am quite sure - about the organic survival of the belief in, and the story of, the Miracle Stag during the 9th - 14th Centuries. Both St. Stephen and St. Ladislas were connected with mythic stories when they were led to several places by a miracle stag (or hind?; fig. on p. 23), and Ladislas decided to erect Christian churches on such places. Some written sources, discovered relatively late (and published in the fifties of the last century), disclosed new information on such foundations of both St. Stephen and St. Ladislas.22 St. Stephen founded an archipresbitery in the southern part of modem Budapest (insula Chuth = insula Haros). It was dedicated to St. Eustach, patron saint of hunters. The logical conclusion of L. Mezey was that King Stephen decided to dedicate this church to St. Eustach because he had been influenced by the myth of origin of his own - Arpadian - family.

It is easy to understand why Hungarian historians, linguists and archaeologists, particularly J. Berze Nagy and Gy. Moravcsik,23 and also C. Pschmadt, studied every possible question of the Miracle Stag, going into the smallest details of Greek, Byzan tine and Latin sources, especially of Pindar2325and Apollodoros26.27 The original version of the story was probably kept by Pindar: a hero pursues a hind (the Goddess Artemis) across rivers and the sea, and finally they fall in love on the Island of the Blessed. These scholars thoroughly studied every detail, with one single and curious exception. This exception shall be the main topic of this paper. Pschmadt also investigated the description of a hind wearing golden antlers, which, of course, is against nature. The hind is described by Apollodoros as ij jcspvvmg ehcupoq. The word Kspvvhig would go back to an original Kepv'ixig which, according to Pschmadt, would reflect a Grecisized variant of a Semitic root with a meaning 'the antlered [animal], the shiny’. Since the hind can be identified with Artemis the Moon Goddess, and the golden antler originally related to beliefs of the Heavenly Light (of the Sun, Moon and the Stars), it can be assumed that Ancient Greeks (as a result of their connections with peoples of the Orient) identified Artemis with a Star Goddess in the shape of a hind. Pschmadt, however, did not give apparent explanation of the fact, that the statue of Artemis, now in the collections of the Louvre, represents a hind wearing antlers.28 - Is it, therefore, right, proper and valid if

Budapest, 1986, Fig. on p. 127. - Berze Nagy 1927,1:67. - The dichotomy between the stag and the hind is best represented by the 15. century chronicle of Johannes Thuroczy, 14



we pose again the old question: why hinds were once represented wearing antlers? According to the interpretations of Berze Nagy and Moravcsik, the two mythical stories of the Ancient Greeks (i.e. Artemis, the stag, and Io, the cow) were intermingled in the first half of the fifth century AD, when Sozomenos probably applied this story to the Huns.29 They concluded that hinds did not have a similar 'guiding-a-tribe’ role in Ancient Greek stories, and such a function was first attributed to them in the legendary Hunnic stories, based on early traditions, according to which Io, in the shape of a cow, went across the Kimmerian Bosphorus. ... The intermingling, however, of these two stories (about the escaping Io with that of the hind) - was only possible under the condition that the image of the pursued Io-the-cow (wearing a horn, similar to the New Moon) was bound to the similarly pursued hind of goddess Artemis. The psychological conditions of this intermingling were given by the fact that both mythical animals had astral characters. Therefore hinds were to be imagined having antlers (representing the sunlight). To make them similar to the glittering moonlight, however, the story, in its developed form, visualized the antler as if it were of gold. This is the reason why the Herakles story speaks about a hind having golden antlers. This story has many later variants, surviving till present times.30 I would emphasize the dating of the process suggested by Berze Nagy and Moravcsik. Such a development of symbols of both Artemis and Io should have happened well before the final intermingling of their symbols, as can be seen in descriptions (and figural representations) of the hind of Artemis, wearing antlers. This terminus ante quern simply means a terminus ad quern, to be dated into a very early, presently indefinable, period, when legen dary mythical stories first began to speak about antlered hinds of reindeer suckling their calves, without connecting them to individual goddesses. Such an early dating, as we will see later,

correlates well with thoughts and chronology of Gyula Laszlo concerning the origin of the mythical image of antlered hinds. The interpretation of Berze Nagy and Moravcsik has considerable merit, first of all because they collected and discussed the greatest part of relevant ancient sources. As a result, their works are very complicated and, at the same time, one important point escaped their attention. In the following, I would concentrate on this point, first focusing on Ancient Greek antecedents of the Hun story. It is fairly easy to put together the core of this legend, using, in English, the essential aid of K. Kerenyi, citing his exceptionally well informed summary:31 “High mountain ranges separate the land of Argos from Arkadia to the west, the Parthenion and the Artemision. Their names (respectively 'Virgin Mountain’ and 'Artemis’ Mountain’) remind us of the great virgin goddess who bore sway there. Artemis had her temple on a peak of the massif of Artemision and there had the title Oinatis, 'she of Oinoe’ ('the wine village’), from the last little town and furthest outlying region which still belonged to Argos. Thither Herakles was now to journey, for Eurystheus set him as his third task32 to bring the golden-antlered hind alive to Mycenae. It belonged to the goddess of Oinoe, but tried to hide even from Artemis on the rocky hill of Keryneia in Arkadia.33 It ranged the whole wild region of Arkadia and also the goddess’ mountains in the neighbourhood of Argos. From there it is said to have visited and laid waste the peasants’ fields,34 but assuredly it was not merely for that reason that it became the third monster in the series of those hunted by Herakles, after the Nemean lion and the hydra of Lema. Hinds had no antlers even in those days, and if one of them actually had golden antlers it was no ordinary beast, but a divine being. It is also told35 that a companion of Artemis, the Titaness Taygete, after whom Mount Taygetos was named, was obliged to

take the form of this hind, because she had accepted the love of Zeus. That was how Artemis punished her. According to others,36 she meant thus to save her. But when Taygete had later on enjoyed the attentions of Zeus, by way of atonement she dedicated the hind into which she was to have been turned to Artemis Orthosia.37389It is not easy to differentiate between the divine beast, the heroine, and the goddess. When Artemis was pursued by the outrageous giant twins, the Aloadai,1381 she was herself the hunted hind. 9 A divine creature with golden antlers, the hind of Keryneia, let itself be hunted by Herakles — that if the right expression here. The dif ficult, dangerous and uncanny thing about the hind was not its unusual wildness,40 which would enable it to offer resistance to the hunter, as many believed, but that it fled and the pursuer could not stop trying to make this strange game his prey. The danger lay in the pursuit, which took him beyond the known region of hunters into another country, from which no one ever came back. There fore, Herakles was to catch the hind, not shoot it down, which would have been easy for so great an archer, and which he actually did in one much too novel variant.41 It was again no common hunt that he had to engage in.

They sought to pull down heaven itself with their bare hands, and to unseat Zeus from his throne above. When they wished to assault Artemis, she could not resist their strength, and Apollo sent a deer between them. Driven mad by anger in trying to kill it with javelins, they killed each other. For the sources see Od. 11:305-320. Apollodorus I.vii.4. (Frazer 1954: I. 59-61.): Ephialtes wooed Hera, and Otus wooed Artemis: moreover they put Ares in bonds. However, Hermes rescued Ares by stealth, and Artemis killed the Aloads in Naxos by ruse. For she changed herself into a deer and leaped between them, and in their eagerness to hit the quarry they threw their darts to each other. Compare Hyginus: Fab. 28. 39Here immediately comes to mind the Hun story about the twin (or only two) brothers Hunor and Magor pursuing the hind trying to escape. This is another element of the Hun story which goes back to very ancient - Old Greek prototypes. 4° Hyginus 30.

The hind began by running away from him out of Oinoe into Mount Artemision, then further through the whole of Arkadia to the river Ladon. As the hero was neither to kill nor hurt it, he followed it for an entire year.42 Where the creature he pursued led him in all that time we are told in Pindar’s ode about the branch of wild olive which Herakles brought to Olympia to be the garland of the victors, and we learn of it from an ancient vase-painting. In Istria, the poem states,43 Artemis met the pursuer; there, at the most northerly extremity of the Adriatic Sea, by the mouth of the Timavus, the goddess had a sacred grove of which it was told that deer lived peaceably with wolves in it.44 She was called Reitia by the inhabitants of that country, the Veneti, and that can be a translation of Orthia or Orthosia. Pursuer and pursued arrived there through the country of the Hyperboreans,45 Apollo’s holy people, whom the name Istria designated for the Greeks, as well as the peninsula at the Timavus. From that other-world region Herakles brought the slip of the wild olive to Olympia, which till then was treeless. An old vase-painting, however, shows us that he penet rated still further in his pursuit beyond the world’s end, even to the Garden of Hesperides. The hind stands beneath the tree of the golden apples, guarded by two women, the Hesperides. According to this picture the hero took the homeward path, escaping from the dangers of remaining in the other world; according to another, his booty was the golden antlers.”
42Apollodorus ’ story (II.v.3) is contradictory from this respect, since according to his first variant, the hero shot the deer: the Cerynitian hind was alive “at Oenoe; it had golden horns and was sacred to Artemis; so wishing neither to kill nor wound it, Hercules hunted it a whole year. But when, weary with the chase, the beast took refuge on the mountain called Artemisius, and thence passed to the river Ladon, Hercules shot it just as it was about to cross the stream and catching it put it on his shoulders and hastened through Arcadia”. The further part of this story changes this beginning, because Hercules, by the end, did not kill the shooted hind but carries the beast alive to Mycenae.

The further part of my study will mostly be focusing on tracing the hitherto unresolved origin of the belief about the golden-antlered hind, and trying to find an answer to, and an interpretation of, the question, why and how it got its golden antlers. Gyula Laszlo, when studying the famous Scythian object from Gartsinovo (one large press mould made of bronze, a stray find from Bulgaria46, dating to the 5th century BC), noticed in 1942, that its middle part depicts the body of a typically Scythian deer in the folded pose (bending when tormented by a lion-shaped griffon and a predatory bird). Its body is decorated with ornaments representing heads of several animals: the head of an eagle can be seen on the foreleg, a lion’s head decorates the foot of the antlers, while its antlers are topped with birds’ and rams’ heads. These were common motifs in the so-called animal-style art of the early steppe nomads (as once was thought by Nandor Fettich), or otherwise, according to A. Alfoldi, they had a specific conception of a world-view, which is still existing to the present day. Preserved, for example, in Flungarian folk-tales, such motifs show that fighting heroes - one pursuer, and one, who is pursued, taking on the shape of different animals - wage their mythical fight, (sometimes as a combat between the Good White and the Evil Black, or between Justice and Injustice).”47
According to Laszlo, the outer appearance of the harnessed horse was greatly determined by such shiny gold, gilded bronze or bronze metal ornaments, representing other animals. Outstanding examples of such ornamentation, suggestive also of its reason, are reindeer masks covering horse heads in Central Asia from the times around the birth of Christ.48

AH 15, and also Laszlo 1967, Fig. on pp. 44-45. 47 Alfoldi 1931, 394-418. - Laszlo 1942, 45-46, with reference to the opinion of Nandor Fettich. For comments on Alfoldi 1931, see Kerenyi 1930/1984, 27. 48 The Pazyryk horse heads were published by Gryaznov, and after him also by Tallgren: Inner Asiatic and Siberian rock pictures. ESA VIII, Fig. 38. - Laszlo went into details in his footnote concerning similarities between reconstructed Scythian horse harnesses and some aspects of present day Hungarian folk beliefs. His conception shows much connection with the astral interpretation of Berze Nagy, discussed above. According to Laszlo, “in specific folk songs of 19



One year later, in his next article, Gy. Laszlo first refused the interpretation of such Scythian horse hamessings and metal frontstalls as proposed by A. Alfoldi, M. Rostovceff, H. Schmidt and others, amongst them the assumed role of the frontstalls as 7i6xvva Gspdiv-representations.49 Instead of this, he suggested a different solution: “the gold reindeer masks, found on the head of some horses in the the Pazyryk kurgans give important advice on how to explain the former meaning of such representations. The notion of a horse transformed into a deer deeply rooted in the intellectual world of ancient steppic peoples, since its survivals can be found till present times. I do not think that the reindeer mask could have been connected with the funerary cult of those days. I did not have possibility to study personally the Pazyryk masks, but I was able to investigate metal frontstalls and bridle ornaments of identical meaning in the Museum of History in Kiev.50 I observed weathered surfaces and signs of wear on them, and all this observations exclude, that these metal pieces were only made for a short time use in the funeral cult. On the contrary! They surely were continuously used in the daily life, or during ceremonies, as parts of horse hamessings. The most important point of this question is, that some ancient peoples wanted to change the outer appearance of the horse, to be different from its natural shape, similarly to that that shamans used to have claws on their feet, and feathers and other animal symbols on their foreheads. All this is needed in order to do up to their tasks and duties. ...
’regos type’ from Transdanubia, and also from the easternmost part of Transylvania (the Szekely Land), the original central motif (if cleaned from influences of Christian Symbolic) vividly describes such deer representations of the Scythians, and in any case relates the young miracle stag myth, which was brought here, into the Carpathian Basin, by the landtaking Hungarians. The forehead of the stag wears the shiny sun, on his side is the beautiful moon, while its right kidney is marked by some heavenly stars, and his antlers’ tines have thousands of links of tow and pitch, and also golden rings. With the help of these heavenly symbols, the young miracle stag visualizes a man, who is a messenger of the Heaven.” Laszlo 1943,41-43. 50 For the curious visit of both Gyula Laszlo and Nandor Fettich (two young archaeologists of the time) in the Kiev National Museum during the German occupation of the city from 3 December of 1941 till 19 of January, 1942, see H. <J>enix: KniBCfaKHil moacHHHK. Kiev, 2004. 20



It is highly probable that, in addition to the transformation of a horse into a deer, many others of such animal properties were assigned to the horse, which were needed in hunting for animals. Horse rider will never catch a panther but a panther can do it, only eagle can fly a race with another eagle, a lion can be defeated by a lion, and finally a deer or a bird can only be overtaken by deer or birds.51 Something similar might have been at the background of the above mentioned harnessing of a horse with reindeer mask. The power of the idea was probably enhanced by the way that, pursuing given animals, the Scythians applied symbols of quicker and wilder animals to give help to horse, and also rider. Scythian horse hamessings, and the cumulative application of stylized animals or animal parts, were not apotropaic symbols intended to ward off evil spirits, but had a dynamic role to reinforce power. Many other things might have contributed to this basic idea, as for example the frequent application of wings of bird, the presence of which in the Scythian animal style surely had had common roots with the image of the ancient Greek Pegasos.”5253 Amongst the animal attributes, which would give a different appearance to a horse or assign it new properties, there are first and foremost deer or reindeer antlers, furthermore eagle claws and eagle wings (also seen as body parts of the mythical griffon). I will discuss the winged Pegasus-figure later. Later Gyula Laszlo enriched his interpretations with some new, very important, details and comparisons. In 1967, he wrote to the effect that on “one miniature of the Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle from around the middle of the XIV Century one can see an antlerless hind,'531, which perfectly corresponds to the fact that European female deer are antlerless. Later will be shown why this, seemingly unimportant, question is of so great importance. We will
51The Secret History of the Mongols from the 13th century describes three young Merkid warriors, Qudu, Qal and Cilia ’un, who had fled from battle “like a lassoed wild horse, like a stag with an arrow in its body. If they grow wings and fly up into the sky, you, Siibe’etei, will you not fly up like a falcon and catch them?” (8.199. - Anderson 1999, 381). 52Laszlo 1943,44-45. 53 A miniature representing the mythical hunt of Hunor and Magor in the marshes of the Maeotis.

then realize, that all other deer representations seen in this volume [Laszlo 1967] have antlers, but, at the same time, we know well that all are not males (stags), but females: hinds." After a long introduction to the next part of his book, which begins with the interpretation of the Sorcerer’s figure of the Lascaux cave,54 bearing a deer’s mask on its head, Laszlo continues his interpre tations as follows: 'It seems, that the cult of the hind first developed amongst the hunting tribes, which slowly followed the retreat of the ice-cap to the northernmost part of our hemisphere [in Epipaleolithic times], and later it was reflected back to the South, as far as prehistoric Greece, since the companion of the goddess Artemis also was an antlered hind. ... The ancient and later artistic world of the enormously great tayga-forest and grassland belts of Eastern Europe are full of deer representations. ... All, or nearly all, of them show antlered animals, according to our present knowledge male animals: stags. ... On the other hand, however, one large Scythian breastplate, found in the Seven Brothers kurgan north of the Caucasus can solve the riddle: this stag, having large antlers, is suckling its calf [Fig. 1]. The Scythian master hammered a piece surely representing an antlered hind. As a matter of fact, amongst the Eurasian Cervus-species only the female reindeer have antlers. While reindeer now only live on the northern tundra, they had survived on more southern grasslands till the last millennia B.C., and it nevertheless follows from this fact, that the veneration o f the hind, as a female ancestor, had first developed on the huge northern belt o f the sparsely forested areas, on territories occupied by reindeer hunters and breeders. ... Finds from Scythian burials in the Altaj Mountains show the transformation of horses, deposited into graves of high-ranking persons, into deer, using masks, as if they were Psychopompoi, guiding souls of the deceased into the Lower World.’55 Here Gy. Laszlo seems to have changed his former opinion in the case of the funeral-cult. At the same time, he, again, led back the origin of the custom of representing a hind having antlers (i.e.

the pictorial transformation of antlerless deer to antlered ones by the Scythians), to very early periods of human history, i.e. Upper Palaeolithic times. He considered the southern appearance of this custom, in the Ancient Greek mythology as a result of strong northern influences, coming into Ancient Greece from steppic, or even from more northern, areas of the European tayga belt: on a few sacral representations, the antlered stag is, in fact, a hind wearing an antlered mask. Since then, the number of Scythian representation of horses bearing deer or reindeer masks, and also of antlered hinds, has risen. Here follows a short list of such representations:

The origin of the belief in antlered hinds and masked horses: Indo-Iranian (Scythian and other) finds and sources
a. A gilded silver breastplate excavated in the Seven Brothers kurgan cemetery (the Kuban area, Krasnodar territory), dating to the 5th century BC, showing an antlered stag suckling its calf. In the lower part of the plate there can be seen the figure of an eagle with expanded wings (Fig. 1). The barrow yielded a whole series of remarkable vessels made of precious metals. Amongst them there were silver and gold rhytons imported from Achaemenid Persia, and also very rare silver-gilt Attic bowls. Another interesting artefact is a silver kylix of the third quarter of the fifth century B.C., from tumulus 6. The multifigured composition in the central part of it probably depicts a scene from the story of Odysseus and Penelope. b. Tumulus 4 of the same kurgan-cemetery (the Seven Brothers kurgans) yielded a horse bridle frontlet made of bronze, and representing the head of a fantastic bird (eagle) wearing stag antlers on the top of its head (Fig. 2), and also a number of smaller bronze frontlets of similar construction, representing stags’ heads (Figs. 3-4).37 c. Several composite masks, made from metal, leather and fur, and applied on horse heads, were found in Pazyryk burials. One of them came from kurgan 1, and shows an animal combat motif, the fight of a deer and a winged lion-griffin with a tiger (Fig. 5).5 The same kurgan grave yielded other horse masks or headdresses, made mostly of leather and fur, with an applied deer antler, partly5678

covered with the representation of a tiger made of fur (Figs. 6-9).5960 Further similar masks were also found in kurgan graves 2 and 5. One complete piece was excavated in kurgan grave 5: an antlered stag’s head of leather was put to the frontal part of a mask, made of thin leather (Figs. 10-11), while another, found in kurgan grave 2, represents an essentially similar construction: the frontal part of the horse mask is topped by a sheep’s figure, having a cock’s statuette on its head (Figs. 12a-h).61 d. Chamfron ornament (headpiece of a horse’s harness), found in the 2nd kurgan of Pazyryk in 1947 and made in the form of a stag’s head. The curious piece made from leather and wood represents an animal combat motif, where an attacking griffon holds the antlered head of a stag in its beak. The tips of the leather antler are topped with figures of long-necked cocks.62 This object, holding the head of a stag in its beak, was a headdress decoration for a horse (Fig. 13).63 The skin on the left arm of a male body, found in kurgan 2 of Pazyryk, conserved traces of tattooing, one detail of which shows a horse figure wearing an antlered mask (Fig. 14).64 e. The barrow 401 of the Zhurovka Scythian cemetery (Kiev Province, Cherkassy Region), which dates to the 5th century B.C. contained a gold chamfron, with relief images of a recumbant stag in its upper part, and other repousse-figures representing a bird, and also other bird’s heads (Fig. 15).65

f. Excavations of a grave in kurgan 1 of Pazyryk yielded a horse bridle consisting of wooden, leather, bronze and gold parts. It dates to the fifth century B.C. Reconstruction shows that an antlered deer head occupied the place of a frontstall on the forehead of the horse, together with heads of eagle and also of mountain goats (Figs. 16).66 A similar bridle ornament was also found in kurgan 5 of Pazyryk: a horse harness with cheekpieces, and the antlered head of a deer applied to the browband (Figs. 17-18).67 Similar harnesses were also found in the burials of Al-Alaxa68 and in the burial chamber of the kurgan at Kuturguntas (Figs. 19-20).69 g. Bronze bridle from Luristan, dating to the ninth-eighht centuries BC., showing a pair of antlered hinds suckling calves (Fig. 21).70 This piece shows that these beliefs were part of Early Iranian groups inhabiting some parts of Elam already in the first quarter of the first mill. BC. The same suggestion can be made on the presence of the symbolic deer hunting motif south of the Caucasus in the 8-7. centuries BC, as shown by the incisedembossed decoration seen on a bronze strip, found in grave 74d (I) of the Tlij cemetery, Eastern Georgia.71 The piece belongs to the Koban culture, which is marked by such cast bronze stripes with incised designs that depict hunting and war scenes peopled by trousered figures using composite bows, carrying gorytoi, and mounted on horses from whose necks swing human heads (Fig. 22).72 This scene, on the one hand, can easily be compared to the

figure of Herakles pursuing, and shooting at, the antlered deer,73 and also to much later representations of Middle Iranian (Sarmatian and Alanian) horse-mounted warriors, with human heads swinging on their horse harnessing.7475Strong connections between Caucasian art motifs and the narrative about the fetching of Kerberos by Herakles can be found in details of the Shiravakan bronze figurine (Northwestern Armenia), discovered inside the pit-grave of a small burial mound no. 17 dated to 1400-1100 BC (Fig. 29).73 The upper part of a standard depicts a hero-archer dragging a captured monstrous dog by some kind of a leash attached to a massive collar. The hero’ body is naked, wearing only boots and bearing arms: a bow with a quiver, a crested helmet, a wide battle-belt and a baldric. He holds a shield in his left hand. The engraved representation of a bronze dish from Kastamonu (Turkey), dating to the Hittite Imperial Period (13th Century BC) can be considered the prototype of this hunting scene (Fig. 23). The curious find shows a man with a bow performing a ritual hunt with the help o f a domesticated deer.76 Instead of bridles the scene was represented using a noseband which was characteristic for the Vedic India before Greek influence.77 h., Excavations in the Tuva area in 1961 found a 13 cm long carved horn belt plaque, which shows the representation of a horse in folded position. It dates to the 5th century Scythian material of the Altai-Sayan mountains, coming from a grave, which was
73As seen above, a divine creature with golden antlers, the hind of Keryneia, let itself be hunted by Herakles. Herakles was to catch the hind, not shoot it down, which would have been easy for so great an archer, and which he actually did in one much too novel variant, i.e. Apollodorus II.v.3. See also below, note 124. 74 See Makkay 2002, 13-14, with further literature, especially Istvanovits - Kulcsar 1997, 158-160, with convincing argumentation about the Iranian origin of this custom.

discovered in the village of Sagly, at a place Sagly-Bazhi II, in kurgan 13. The horse wears the schematic representation of antlers on the front of its head.78 The spiraloid motif can also be treated as the representation of an artistically arranged mane, indicated by rows of curving, leaflike shapes.79 Such plaques were possibly employed as belt buckles (Fig. 24). i. The figure of a fantastic animal ('cavallo fantastico’) w recently found in the Northwestern part of China, in the province of Shanxi/Shansi, and dates to the 4th century BC. The golden plaque probably is of Chinese manufacture, made for Nomadic peoples living north of Chinese territories. The piece represents a charac teristic horse figurine wearing a large antler on its head, topped with predatory bird’s heads, and is called 'horse monster’ (Fig. 28).80 k. The Berel burial ground is located in the Khazakh Altai mountains at the border junction of four countries: Khazakstan, Russia, China and Mongolia. Barrow no. 11 is the largest burial mound of the kurgan cemetery, and dates to the fourth century B.C. The partly robbed burial chamber contained a barrel-shaped treetrunk coffin containing the remains of a man and a woman. Thirteen horses were buried near the northern wall. The horses were bridled and saddled, the heads of some were decorated with masks (Fig. 26). One of them has imitated horns of the mountain goat, made of wood, and crowning the horsemask made of different materials. The length of the horns was 725 and 735 mm (Fig. 27). In another case, a big wooden sculpture of a griffin belonged to the upper part of the head decoration of the horse. It was, presumably, fastened to the head betwen the ears and the wooden horns of the burial mask, in front of the mane decoration.81

1. Finally, there is a large belt mount made of pure gold, cast and hammered, which once belonged to the famous Siberian Collection of tsar Peter the Great, and was brought there as a stray find before 1844. It was found in the Baikal area (in the vicinity of Verkhneudinsk, on the territory of Ulan-Ude, or in Mongolia), and dates to the 5th - 4th centuries BC. On the reverse, an imprint of cloth and two loops for attachment can be seen. The plaque shows a fantastic horse locked in combat with a feline predator (Fig. 25). The horse has a beak-shaped snout and antlers with seven tines, each of which terminates in a beaked bird’s head (very probably of an eagle), as do the mane and long, curling tail. Empty space on the body is filled with relief images: on the shoulder, a bird; on the body and hind legs, the enlarged head of a bird grasping a ram’s head in its beak (for comparison, see piece'd’ above). The horse on the plaque has been described as wearing a mask, as did some of the real horses buried at Pazyryk.82

Gy. Laszlo later repeatedly suggested that the whole system of belief in such transformed and miraculous stags was originally part of very early (Late Palaeolithic) reindeer- and wild horsehunters, who had followed the retreat of the ice cap (and the resulted wandering of the reindeer to the north), and they spread to the north in Mesolithic times between the 12. and 6/5. Millennia.83 It is quite easy to interpret his suggestion in the framework of present terms of prehistoric archaeology: hunting groups wandering to the North can surely be identified with Late Palaeolithic and Epipalaeolithic groups of the East Gravettian culture, or technocomplex, of the European steppic and forest steppic zones, and its Mesolithic descendants.

cultural complex (between the Carpathian Range and VolgaCaspian area) can, at the same time, be considered the genetic antecedents of the speakers of the oldest Indo-Iranian dialectal group. It is my strong belief, that Proto-Indo-Iranian languages emerged in the western steppes after the end of the Ice Age, when periglacial groups (perhaps early antecedents of Finno-Ugrians) moving North divided from their neighbours (or cognates), which had remained back on their former territories and the dialectal differentiation of the Indo-European parent language also had its beginnings. Following this, the continuous and apparently unbroken archaeological and ethnic development east of the Dnieper from the earliest Pit grave (Kurgan) period to the appearance of the Iranian speaking Sarmatians help us to understand why such very old - Late Palaeolithic - religious beliefs had survived so long a millennia until Middle Iranian periods, i.e. Scythian and Sarmatian times. It is a well known fact, that the Scythians were a member of this long and unbroken developing chain of Indo-Iranian - Proto-Iranian - Early Iranian - Old Iranian speaking tribes, which archaeologically can be described as the long sequence of the Pit grave - Catacomb grave - Timber grave Kimmerian or Proto-Scythian - Scythian - Protosarmatian Sarmatian/Alanian cultures i.e. periods.84 When the long and unbroken continuity of this sequence is taken into consideration, it is no wonder why, and how, elements of the belief in miraculous stags and hinds were inherited from ancestral groups into later cultural phases of genetically and culturally related population groups of Iranian and Indo-Aryan tongues. Narratives of Finno-Ugric origin might have also contributed to the wide distribution of such beliefs as for instance notions of the fabulous elk Sharabha. The Sanskrit word Astapada (i.e. having eight feet, later Sharabha in the mythical stories of the Djatakas) according to the theory of the accomplished Flungarian linguist B. Munkacsi - would correspond to Protougric sarp or sharp denoting 'reindeer’ or 'elk’.85 There is the possibility that this notion was

adopted to the Indoiranian mythology from an early phase of the Finno-Ugric mythology.86 In full accordance with these, and other, archaeological facts and linguistic premises, Gy. Laszlo added important details to his suggestions concerning Iranian beliefs and thoughts about pursued stags, and the image of the antlered hind. For example, he made reference to a Persian tale (a variant of one of tales in the Arabian Nights), in which one variant of the Hungarian saga (of the two brothers, i.e. Hunor and Magor pursuing the deer) can also be detected. According to this tale, 'Prince Rusvanshad, son of the Chinese Emperor, while hunting in the forest, espied a wondrous stag whose hair was blue, whose eyes were like ruby, and whose hoofs shone like pure gold. This stag sped on before him, and chase as he would, could never bring it down. At last, the stag jumped into a small lake and vanished. Rusvanshad, who fell asleep, was awakened later by gay music and rippling laughter. Following the voices, he soon found himself in a gorgeous marble palace where, surrounded by a dozen maidens, he caught sight of a maid of wondrous beauty seated upon a throne. To his question who she was she answered, “I am only a gentle doe, my name is Shehristani. I am the Queen of Fairyland.” After several trials they got married, and went through many other adventures...’87 It is obvious, that here a maiden was transformed into a stag, i.e. became an antlered hind.

For the Djatakas see below, note 85. 86 Kuzmina 2004, 103. — To the question of Indoiranian and Finno-Ugric relations (and especially for the contribution of K. Kerenyi) see my paper: Makkay 2004, passim, and also 2006. 87 Laszlo 1974, 97. - Laszlo 1970/1974, 93-94. - Laszlo did not give a reference to his source. It probably was the 1930/1984 paper of Kerenyi (38-31), who had made a long comment on the importance of this story when discussing the questions of the Miracle Stag. Originally, as Kerenyi wrote, the story had been part of an Indian literary variant of the Arabian Nights, the Persian translation of which later was translated into French. This literary form of the legend was the connecting link between the oriental (and the totemistic Hun) variant and the European-Greek version. In this intermingled version the hind changes to a beautiful girl and becomes the wife of his pursuer. Cf. Kerenyi 1930/1984,27. 31



Not only this tale, but a similar story of the Indo-Aryan Djataka (the collections of stories telling of Buddha’s former rebirths) contains related motifs, in this case, about a stag. 'Once upon a time, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisattva lived in the forest, having been bom as a stag. Now the king much delighted in hunting. ... One day as he went a hunting he said to his courtiers, “Whoever lets a deer go by him, such and such shall be his punishment. ... When a deer is put up, by hook or by crook we must drive him to the place where the king is.” They made a pact among them to this effect, and posted the king at the end of the path. Then they surrounded a great covert and began to beat the ground with cudgels and the like. The first to be put was our stag. Thrice he went round the thicket, looking for a chance to escape: on all other sides he saw men standing without a break, arm jostling arm and bow; only where the king was could he see a chance. With eyes glaring, he rushed at the king, dazzling him as though he cast sand in his eyes. Quickly the king saw him, shot an arrow, and missed. You must know these deer are clever to keep clear o f a r r o w s ^ ... Up rose the stag, swift as the wind he was off, breaking the circle of men. ... [Then the king] girding up his loins, on foot, and sword in hand, set off at speed crying: “I will catch the stag!” He kept him in sight and chased him for three leagues. The stag plunged into the forest, in plunged to king also. Now in the stag’s way was a pit, a great hole where a tree had rotted away, sixty cubits deep, and full of water to a depth of thirty8
88 My emphasis. Here a comparison can be made with the mythic duel of St. Ladislas (king of Hungary) and the Cuman when both sides seem to be invulnerable and cannot be hurted either by arrows or spears. See Laszlo 1993, 184. For further references to this belief, see Makkay 1998, 11, and note 19. According to the Avesta (Yast, stanzas 20-21) ’The spear that the foe of Mithra (Antimithra) flings, darts ... backwards. And even though the spear be flung well, even though it reach the body, it makes no wound. ... The wind drives away the spear that the foe of Mithra flings,’. Darmesteter - Mills 1882/1992:11, 124-125. Here, in the Hungarian Mediaeval legend, the Avestan mythical story appears without its original concept which was lost, and what remained from the original symbolism was the invulnerability of the heroic warriors. One more Iranian correspondence! - See also a similar event in the Mahabharata: proud Bhishma relates how Jamadagni loosed at him feathered shafts (i.e. a shower of arrows), those celestial weapons, but he warded them off: A. Cotterell: Chariot. London, 2004, 156. 32



cubits, yet covered over with weeds. The stag sniffed the smell of the water, and perceiving that it was a pit, swerved aside somewhat from his course. But the king went straight on, and fell in. ... Then the stag drew up the king from out of the pit, and comforted him, and set him upon his own back, and led him forth from the forest, and set him down not far from his army.’ After a short discussion, refusing the offer of the king, the stag returned into the forest.89 These two tales, of Rusvanshad and Shehristani and that of king Brahmadatta, together with the representation on the Luristan bronze cheekpiece (see point 'g ’ above, and Fig. 21), clearly show that the mythical belief of the wondrous deer did not only belong to the Steppic Iranians, but was also an important part of the religion of Indo-Aryans and Early Iranians who occupied their historic homelands around the middle of the 2nd Mill. BC, both in India, and also the Middle East. Similarly, the statuette of an antlered horse figurine from Province Shansi (see point 'i’ above) refers to Early and Old Iranian influences on the development of West Chinese territories in ancient times.90 All this convincingly supports the theory of Gyula Laszlo about the origin and later development of mythical beliefs in wondrous stags and hinds amongst very early population groups of the western part of the Eurasian steppic belt. Similar beliefs are known from the Iranian mythology concerning other animals too, in good accord with archaeological finds, listed above. There is an Avestan story (Yast 6), according to which the astral god Tistriya is described in mythic tales as a boar with golden horns, sometimes as a horse with yellow ears, or as a

beautiful youth.91 Tistriya appears as the bright and glorious (Si rius) star, who goes down to the sea in the shape o f a white, beautiful horse, with golden ears and a golden caparison?2 Ac cording to the Bundahisn, he was converted into three forms; a man, a horse, and a bull. 3 The expression of the white beautiful horse, with a golden caparison perfectly corresponds to the abovementioned Scythian chamfrons or frontstalls, for example, point 'e ’ of the list above (Fig. 15.) and also to the reconstructions of Gyula Laszlo. There are also good Vedic parallels. One hymn writes on the heavenly sacrificial horse to the effect that it is provided with the characteristic body parts of a deer - and also with eagle’s wings and claws - (a new appearance was given to the horse). Very simply, this detail speaks about a sacrificial horse, extremely similar in its appearance to Scythian representations (see the list points 'a’ and ' f above). Moreover, the horse has a gilded or pure gold antler:
“Limbs o f the deer hadst thou, and eagle pinions.... Horns made o fgold hath he : hisfeet are iron :... Thy horns are spread abroad in all directions : ...”94
Corresponding to this morphological admixture of charac teristic body parts of horses and red deer, the hymns of the RigVeda also contain details about chariots of deities, drawn by harnessed or yoked deer instead of horses.95 Another piece of

evidence, coming from the Southern Caucasus (perhaps an IndoIranian territory?), independently confirms the existence of wagons or chariots drawn by deer. In kurgan grave 150 near Khanlar (Armenia), two stag skeletons were found, one on each side of the pole of a wooden wagon. The assemblage can be dated to ca. 15001300 BC. The remains of calcinated human bones of the deceased were found on the vehicle, accompanied by the skeleton of a sacrificed driver (Fig. 30).96978 Vedic and other Indo-Aryan sources used to emphasize, not fully accidentally, that if an animal is hornless and furnished with a mane, it is in the form of the horse, for the horse is hornless and furnished with a mane. Dappled sacrificial horses fly with pinions, since the great bird, doubtless, was the horse. Ac cording to the commentary to this line, the horse can be identified with the sacrificed horse, which, in the shape of a bird, carries the Sacrificer up to Heaven. The shape of the altar is that of some large birds - probably an eagle or a falcon100- and this is why Agni (’the altar’) takes the form of a bird in order to carry the Sacrificer to Heaven. The Ancient Greek parallel presents itself: according to some Greek sources Ganymedes, son of Tros, a Trojan prince, the cup-bearer of Zeus, was snatched up to the Sky by an eagle.101 Concerning the curious horse mask found in the Berel burials (see point rk’ above), where one of the buried horses (Fig. 26.) has

imitated horns of the mountain goat, the Vedic ritual comes to mind, where the horse bears the characteristics of the god Agni. Besides the horse, texts also mention another animal, obviously of equal importance, a goat with black spots: 'goat is like Agni’, it is remarked; the ritual fire is set up by some on the footprints of this goat.102 According to the Rig-Veda, at the horse sacrifice, in addition to the horse, a he-goat is given in sacrifice as 'Pusan’s share to announce the sacrifice to the gods’. The goat thus, acts as a guide on the way to the divine world.103 The Brahamana also associates the two animals.104105 These two motifs and their admixture - animals converted into new forms, and the Heavenly journey - cannot be separated from the meaning of one depiction, discussed above (point 'a’; and Fig. 1), seen on the gilded silver breastplate found in the burial of the largest of the Seven brothers kurgans, on which, below the feet of the antlered stag suckling a calf, there can be observed an eagle with expanded wings. According to Gyula Laszlo, this represen tation had a mythological meaning which is very deeply rooted in old traditions/05 Now we can add to his suggestion that this meaning, to be communicated to the given society, goes back to very old times, to the time of the still undivided original speech community of the Indo-Iranians, if one considers its inherent, Vedic and Old-Iranian, correspondences. Well before the Scythi ans, this period can be identified with pre-Pit grave (pre-Kurgan) times, before the 3rd Millennia BC at least. This chronology, based on archaeological facts as well as linguistic considerations, confirms not only the dating given by Moravcsik (the earliest development of the Herakles-story with the Keryneian deer must be dated much before Artemis began to be imagined, and also represented, in the shape of an antlered hind). But also the assumed interpretation of Gyula Laszlo gains support,

according to which the formation of such and similar mythical stories can be sought in the Upper Palaeolithic and following times, amongst religious beliefs of Ice Age hunters, living on territories, which later became the original homeland of Indo-Iranian tribes. This was the period, when antlered hinds (i.e. female reindeer) did live on territories which later became the steppe. Under the given circumstances, antlered reindeer hinds were suckling their calves and, as such, they got a role in mythical stories. Later, after the Ice Age, reindeer herds, including, of course, their females, migrated to the north, and only red deer (Cervus elaphus) lived on the whole steppic and forest steppic belt. Surviving population groups, however, which continued to live on the same huge territory after the Ice Age, had kept their original mythological beliefs and stories and, according to the prototypes, represented suckling deer as having antlers. Slowly wild horses, and also red deer occupied the place of the reindeer (and mammoths) as the most preferred game.106 This was probably the time when stags’s masks were applied to burial, sacrificial and mythical horses and suckling hinds were represented as wearing antlers. This is only conceivable, however, if population groups of the steppe and forest steppe belt after the end of the Ice Age were genetic descendants of the Upper Palaeolithic inhabitants of the same territory. This can be expressed in modem archaeological terminology: if the peoples of the Pit grave culture can be considered the descendants of the Gravettien culture. Anthropo logical data, I think, would support such an idea: skeletons of both cultural groups can belong to the same Proto-Europid or ProtoNordoid type.107 In the end, can Gy. Laszlo’s suggestion that such and similar Nordic elements became parts of the Ancient Greek mythology be accepted? Further details can support his theory.

The gold antlered hind in the Greek Mythology
Interestingly enough, the absolutely well-informed Karl Kerenyi did not refer to a very special detail concerning horns and antlers of mythic animals and, as a result, neither Hungarian, nor international research took this important detail into consideration. The point in question is the curious legend of Sisyphus, the son of Aiolos and Enarete, the grandfather of Bellerophontes. Sisyphus seems to have embodied most of those mythical elements which are the topic of this study. According to the summary of Kerenyi, it is fitting to begin this story with Sisyphus, who will then quickly lead us to the history of Bellerophontes, the greatest hero and slayer of monsters before the days of Herakles. He belonged to those primeval inhabitants of the earth who could still look on at the first deeds of the gods and he attained the kingship over Ephyra in the Argolid - later Corinth - from Medea. He lived at Ephyra, in that comer of the Isthmus where Corinth was to arise, this being the city which he was supposed to have founded.108910 He was a man of cunning rather than violence, the subtlest of all mankind.111
108II. 6.154-155. 109 Pausanias 2.III. 10-IV.3: Afterwards, when Corinthus, the son of Marathon, died childless, the Corinthians sent for Medea from Iolcus and bestowed upon her the kingdom. Through her Jason was king in Corinth, and Medea, as her children were bom, carried each to the sanctuary of Hera and concealed them, doing so in the belief that so they would be immortal. At least she learned that her hopes were vain, and at the same time she was detected by Jason. When she begged for pardon he refused it, and sailed away to Iolcus. For these reasons Medea too departed, and handed over the kingdom to Sisyphus. (2.IV.1-3). This is the account that I read, and not far from the tomb [the tomb of Medea’s children] is the temple of Athena Chalinitis (Bridler). For Athena, they say, was the divinity who gave most help to Bellerophontes, and she delivered to him Pegasus, having herself broken in and bridled him (khalinos ’bridle’). ... Sisyphus had other sons besides Glaucus, the father of Bellerophontes, ...”. Jones 1959, 1:265 and 267. For the golden bridle see below! - West 2003,243, note 24. 110 Apollodorus I. ix. 3.: „And Sisyphus, son of Aeolus, founded Ephyra, which is now called Corinth, and married Merope, daughter of Atlas. They had a son Glaucus, who had by Eurymede a son Bellerophon, who slew the fire-breathing Chimera [see also Apollodorus II. iii. 1.: Frazer 1954:1. 151, note 2.]. But 38



If anyone wanted to make his way from Phlius, a spot further inland, hidden behind great hills, to the Saronic Gulf, he could easily be spied upon from the towering rocks which bore the name Akrokorinthos. That was what happened to Zeus. In Phlius he carried off Aigina,112 daughter of the river-god Asopos and the future mother of Aiakos. Asopos looked for his daughter and arrived at Sisyphus’ rocky eyrie. Sisyphus betrayed the abductor and drew the wrath of the gods upon himself.113 Zeus sent Thanatos, Death, against him. He too was espied in good time, outwitted Death and threw Death into strong chains. From that moment, no one died on earth until Ares the war-god set Death free and handed over Sisyphos to him. The cunning man contrived to befool Persephone, queen of the nether world,114 and he has escaped Death for the second time. Now that he has escaped Death again, we may insert here the famous tale of how the arch-rascal and the master-thief, Sisyphus and Autolycus, dealt with each other. Autolycus was a son of Hermes. The god of thieves begot him on one of Apollo’s loves. Thus the 'Wolf itself (for that is the meaning of Autolycus) was bom and he honoured his father Hermes above all gods. From him he got his talent for theft and clever perjury.115 He could make
Sisyphus is punished in Hades by rolling a stone with his hands and head in the effort to heave it over the top; but push it as he will, it rebounds backward. This punishment he endures for the sake of Aegina, daughter of Asopus; for when Zeus had secretly carried her off, Sisyphus is said to betrayed the secret to Asopus, who was looking for her.” Frazer 1954:1. 79. 111 II. 6:153. —Pauly’s Realencyclopadie, 2. Reihe, 5. Halbband, Silacenis bis Sparsus. Miinchen, 1927, sp. 371-376. 1,2Lycophron 174.
" J II. 6.153. - Kerenyi 1959/1974, 75-76. - Pausanias 2.5.1.: „On the summit of the Acrocorinthus is a temple of Aphrodite. ... The spring, wich is behind the temple, they say was the gift of Asopus to Sisyphus. The latter knew, so runs the legend, that Zeus had ravished Aegina, the daughter of Asopus, but refused to give information to the seeker before he had a spring given him on the Acrocorinthus. When Asopus granted this request Sisyphus turned informer, and on this account he receives - if anyone believes the story - punishment in Hades.” Jones 1959:1. 271. 114 Theognis 703. 115Od. 19.396.

anything invisible that he touched with his hand.116 He knew how to make white beasts black and black beasts white; he would take the horns off horned beasts and put them on the heads of those that had none.117 He (an his sons) were magicians who were able to staunch the dark blood with an incantation when Odysseus was wounded on boar-hunt.11819
- Apparently, Autolycus was a person having magic powers, a sorcerer who knew how to put antlers on the heads o f suckling hinds, and also on heads o f horses. He also knew how to make black beasts white. We know that white horses had a significant cultic role in Assyria around the middle o f the 2nd Mill. B.C., and this custom can very probably led back to the influence o f IndoAryan Mitanni rulers. In the Indo-Aryan mythology and ritual, the white horse represents the sun, and the black obviously had a special connection with the setting of the sun.120
The magic power o fAutolycus has, as a rule, very early IndoIranian connections.
Kerenyi continues: At that time, the herds of both rascals pastured on the wide region between Pamassos and the Isthmus. Autolycus could never be caught when he went thieving; Sisyphus saw only that his herds kept growing smaller and the other’s larger. Then he thought of a ruse. He was one of the first who mastered the art of letters, so he engraved the initial letters of his name on the

Three centuries before, around 1800 BC Zimri-Lim, the ruler of the city of Mari tried in vain to obtain white horses from fellow rulers. Later, he sent a letter to a foreign king acknowledging the receipt of the red horses, which came from the rugged north, 'the mountain of horses’, most likely Armenia. See N. P.

hooves of the cattle. But Autolycus found a way to alter this too,121 because he could alter every thing belonging to the beasts. Then Sisyphus poured lead into the hollow of the hooves in the shape of letters which produced the sentence 'Autolycus has stolen me’ in the footsteps of the cattle.122
Autolycus was a magician, who had magic powers and could alter everything belonging to the beasts. He could probably alter a horse in a deer.
It was only after this piece of evidence that the master-thief found himself defeated. It was a contest in cleverness, and Autolycus thought so highly of the winner that he immediately concluded an agreement of friendship and hospitality with him. It is not quite clear who was responsible for what took place in his hospitable house. A so-called 'Homeric’ drinking-cup shows pretty undisguisedly Sisyphos in the bed-chamber of his host’s daughter, the arch-rogue sitting on the bed and the girl with a spindle. Did he secretly have relations with the beautiful Anticleia? It would have been quite worthy of him. But it would also be a thought worthy of Autolycus to offer his own daughter to the man who had outdone him in cleverness so that they might produce the cleverest of all.123 Thus Anticleia became the mother of Odysseus. It was not by Laertes, whom we know as the father from the 'Odyssey’, but from Sisyphos that she conceived the man of many wiles. If we believe this story, Laertes took her when she was already with child.124 A vase-painter of Magna Graecia has preserved for us the scene in which the young man displays his bride, in an interesting condition, to his astonished followers. For he was not even deceived; Autolykos, in this picture, shows him the name of Sisyphos on a leaf. It was the evidence which their guest, who loved letters and was responsible for the pregnancy, had left behind. The final victory in the matter was won by Aphrodite, who is also in the

picture and is entrusting Odysseus to the care of his foster-father, the still young Laertes.1 5 When writing on the magic ability of Autolycus - could alter everything belonging to the beasts, knowing how to put horns or antlers on the heads o f other animals - Kerenyi gave only reference to fable CCI of Hyginus: Mercurius Autolyco ... muneri dedit, ... ut quicquid surripuisset, in quamcunque effigiem vellet, transmutaretur, ex albo in nigrum, vel ex nigro in album, in cornutum ex motilo, in mutilum ex cornuto.125126
There is known, however, one other - fragmentary - source: an ancient Greek legend. According to a scholiast on Pindar, 01. 3.50b, he, Pindar “made it [the Cerynian Hind] female and gold horned on the basis of legend; for the author of the Theseis describes it like that, as do Pisander of Camirus and Pherekydes”.127 Some ancient sources dated Pisander earlier than Hesiod, while others put him in the mid seventh century.128 Pherekydes of Athens, the 'genealogist’ and the writer of mythical Histories, probably lived before the mid-fifth century and an epic Theseis was in circulation probably around 525 BC.129A11 this makes quite sure that the Greek motif of a hind having golden antlers was not the result of any sort of influence originating in, and coming from, the Pontic area of Iranian art and beliefs of Scythian tribes. It can have its origins in much older material and non-material culture of Proto-Iranian - or even Indo-Iranian - tribes that once lived north of the Black Sea. Such details taken into consideration, sources and archaeolo gical finds can be brought into good correlation. A very old mythological heritage not only contained the magic power of magicians to alter antlerless or hornless animals into animals having antlers (and the opposite), but also the transformation of stags into hinds i.e. hinds having golden antlers. Giving full satisfaction to the question of why antlered hinds are suckling

calves. On the other hand, horses wearing deer masks or attributes can be related to the other ability of Autolykos: he had magic power and could alter everything belonging to the beasts: in quamcunque effigiem vellet. All this, together with his power to make white beasts black and black beasts white, relates to very old mythical elements, which had been present in the religious system of Indo-Iranian peoples of the Eurasian steppe since times immemorial. This is testified by some Vedic and Avestan sources. Their comparatively late - and rare - material expressions are among others - the Scythian representations, listed above. The Maeotie story of the Huns, as told by Jordanes and Procopius,130 based on works of Sozomenos, Eunapius es Priscus (written around 433/434, 439-450 and 474), 31 simply was a later variant of much older, ancient Greek, mythical stories, especially about the adventure of the fleeing cow. An important point is that the Maeotie (a Scythian or Cimmerian land on the steppe) adventure was already part of the Ancient Greek narrative, when Io, in the shape of a cow, flees: “Io was a daughter of Inachus. Zeus seduced her while she held the priesthood of Hera, but being detected by Hera he by a touch turned Io into a white cow. But Hera requested the cow from Zeus for herself. ... Hera next sent a gadfly to infest the cow, and the animal came first to what is called after her the Ionian gulf. Then she journeyed through Illyria and having traversed Mount Haemus she crossed what was then called the Thracian Straits but is now called after her the Bosphorus. And having gone away to Scythia and the Cimmerian land she wandered over great tracks of land and swam wide stretches of sea both in Europa and Asia until at last she came to Egypt, where she130

Zosimus, Sozomenos and Philostorgius made considerable use of Eunapius for the period 270-404 [Ibid. 97-99]. Very probably Eunapius’ sixth book contained the description of the digression of the Huns (Blockley 1981, 104, and note 51). According to Moravcsik 1914, the story was first recorded by Sozomenos and Eunapius in the first decades of the 5th Century, and was later also (independently?) written down by Priscus. 43

recovered her original form, The most detailed account of the fleeing of Io in the shape of a cow, and her crossing of the Maeotis, was given by Aeschylus.*133 I cannot go into further details of this part of the mythical story, but supposedly, one very old steppe variant of it contained the fleeing of a hind. This hind sometimes has golden antlers. As was noticed by Kerenyi, hinds had no antlers even in those days and if one of them actually had golden antlers it was not an ordinary beast, but a divine being. It was also told,134 that a companion of Artemis, the Titaness Taygete, was obliged to take the form of a hind having golden antlers because she had accepted the love of Zeus.135 Was it a reasonable explanation of Gyula Laszlo when he suggested that these and other elements of the Ancient Greek mythology originated in the North and, later, distributed to the South as far as the Mediterranean? It was argued by M. L. West that some cosmological details of the Delphic tradition (i.e. the Delphic 'Navel of the Earth’ motif), and other shamanistic motifs in Greek myth came from the North, from Thrace and Scythia.136137 Details connected with the golden antlered hind did not contradict this. Moreover, the assumed prehistory of the Scythian parallels, listed above, will date Northern connections (i.e. Northern antece dents) of these mythical elements to a much earlier time than generally suspected: to the first centuries of the 2nd Mill. BC at least. This harmonizes well with the opinion that since the appearance in 1932 of M. P. Nilsson’s famous book, it has been generally accepted that a substantial kernel of Greek myth goes back to the Bronze Age.138 The poetic traditions about the Myce naean heroes had always been the most powerful core in the classical heritage, although their exact physical civilization and place of origin had been forgotten.139Now, we can locate this place

of origin in the steppe belt north of the Black Sea with its material civilization, i.e. the Pit grave and Catacomb cultures. Concerning material representations of such mythical stories, we must remember that things may be older than their earliest literary attestations. Here an attempt was made to identify mythical themes current in Ancient Greece which appear to have antecedents (and cognates) in the North, among archaeological and literary material of Indo-Iranian and Iranian peoples. At the same time, however, it would be very rash to infer from a number of coincidences between Greek mythical stories and their Indo-Iranian and Iranian counter parts that some ancient Indo-European tradition lay behind both circles. The Greek mythic stories and their Indo-Iranian parallels share elements which might derive from at least two contexts of cultural contact at different time depths: a. myths of great or very great antiquity, widely diffused in Eurasia in early (or even proto-) Indoeuropean times, dating to Late Palaeolithic-Epipalaeolithic periods,140and b. elements which most likely reflect contact between the Greeks and the Western steppe belt between the Carpathian Range and the Volga river. The question, however, emerges, how and when Indo-Iranian or Early Iranian elements or steppe motifs had become part of Ancient Greek mythological narratives?
140 W. Burkert in his comprehensive book sees in the Thetis-Peleus-Achilles story the distant echoes of the possibly Palaeolithic motif of „a Master or a Mistress of the Animals [an Artemis-like being] who must be won over to the side of the hunters .... [although] in the official religion of the Greeks this survives at little more than the level of folklore”: Burkert 1984, 172. 45



Black Sea motifs
The Maeotis-story calls attention to the role the Northern Pontic played in some important parts of the Greek mythology. Ancient Greek recollections remembered curious connections of gods and heroi to the Northern Pontic area. A part of them can probably be the result of the Greek colonization of the Pontic coasts from 750 onward. Others, pephaps, cannot. Amongst them are: 1. The poet Alkaios mentions that Achilles once ruled on the land of the Scythians.141 2. According to fragments of the Trojan Cycle (the Aethiopis of Arctinus of Miletus142), when the Achaeans buried Antilochus, and laid out the body of Achilles, Thetis came with the Muses and her sisters, and lamented her son. And presently Thetis snatched her son from the pyre and conveyed him to the White Island. This Island is in the Black Sea opposite the mouth of the Danube, the modem Ostrov Zmeinyy.14314 3. Greek tradition also kept memory of Achilles, who was united to Helen (or Medea) in the island Leuce, the same White Island, near to the mouth of the Lower Danube. Pausanias wrote as follows: “A story too I will tell which I know the people of Crotona tell about Helen. The people of Himera too agree with this account. In the Euxine at the mouths of the Ister is an island sacred to Achilles. It is called White Island, and its circumference is twenty stades. ... The first to sail thither legend says was Leonymus of Crotona. ... The Pythian priestess sent Leonymus to White Island, telling him that there Ajax would appear to him and cure his wound. In time he was healed and returned from White Island, where, he used to declare, he saw Achilles, as well as Ajax the son of Oileus and Ajax the son of

A sanctuary of Achilles was erected on the Island of Borysthenitis, in one of the estuaries of the river Dniepr, where his grave was venerated as a tomb of a heros.14145 5. Fragmented sources of the Trojan Cycle (the Cypria) told the story of Artemis and Iphigeneia at Aulis: when the expedition of the Achaeans was assembled at Aulis for the second time, Agamemnon killed a deer while hunting and claimed to surpass Artemis herself. The goddess in her wrath stopped them from sailing by sending wild weather. When they set about to sacrifice Iphigeneia to Artemis, the goddess snatched her away and conveyed her to the Tauroi and made her immortal, setting a deer by the altar in place of the girl.146 According to one account of Herodotus, the Tauri near Scythia sacrifice castaways to a maiden who they say is Iphigenia, the daughter of Agamemnon,147148identified with the goddess Artemis. 6. According to Herodoros of Herakleia, Heracles had a Scythian-type bow for shooting arrows and a Scythian archer, called Teutaros, taught him how to use such a bow.14 This tradition goes back to the first third of the 2nd Mill. BC at least and also to the steppe. We must remember at this point, the invention of a new bow type in the Don-Volga steppe area around the end of the local Early Bronze Age. The invention was the use of flat bone/hom brackets or long bone tubes onto the arms of the bow for extra stiffness. It has been suggested that this new type of composite bow had emerged there in the Volga-Don area in the Bronze Age, in the first third of the 2nd Mill. BC, for fighting from chariots. I correlated this case with the curious prelude of the killing of the Suitors in the Odyssey: why they could not bend and string the extremely strong arch of Odysseus. This was probably a superb composite bow strengthened with additional bone or horn plates on its ends. It can be suggested that this bow type was newly

introduced into Mainland Greece around the beginning of the Mycenaean period, while the average composite bows of the Middle Helladic period were made without such reinforcing bone/hom brackets.149 7. Sinope was a Pontic town, named after Asopus’ daughte Sinope, whom Apollo carried off from Hyria and took to the Black S e a /50 8. The distribution of a small group of Attic red-figured fi plates is limited to the Black Sea area. These plates are unusual in that they appear to be the only fish plates to bear a mythological theme, the abduction of Europe by the bull. They were nearly all found in funerary contexts within a small region, and their painted scenes include Nereids among the sea creatures that accompany Europe on her journey to Crete.151152Europa’s transition, across the sea and, even more, across the threshold of maidenhood, is analogous to the transition from life to death. Here, then, is the explanation for the funerary context of the fish plates found in Russia. This transition, in the company of the Nereids, may be viewed as a “voyage” from life to death to rebirth. The findspot of the plates, the Black Sea region, is also significant for its association with Achilles with whom the Nereids had a special relationship: they played an important role during his passage from life to afterlife: they served as his attendants. Achilles’ afterlife was associated with the Black Sea area, as was the cult dedicated to him. According to Apollonius Rhodius, the Black Sea was considered the Underworld,153 but I think that much earlier connections between the Pontic steppe belt and Greece played an important role here: bodies of heroes were symbolically brought back to the area, from where their ancestors - according to fading remembrance of things past - had once departed.

9. According to a scholiast to Pindar 01. Ill: 45, Herakles followed the Kerynian hind, crossing the Istros, into Scythia.154 This motif can be considered the direct antecedent to the Hun story recorded by Byzantine writers of the 5-6. Centuries AD. 10. Finally, in search for explanation of the death of Elpenor, there has been suggested a hypothesis of the existence of his shrine-tumulus somewhere in Pontus.135
Extremely cruel treatment of human beings,
of enemies or prisoners, were, I think, not part of human behaviour of Mediterranean societies in the Neolithic and Bronze Ages, but might have been characteristic of barbarian and violent Nordic (steppic) peoples, who had overrun the civilized South so many times. Here are just a few examples of the ancient Greek mythology: Tydeus the son of Oineus in the Theban war was wounded by Melanippus the son of Astacus. Amphiaraus killed Melanippus and brought back his head, which Tydeus split open and gobbled the brain in passion. When Athena, who was bringing Tydeus immortality, saw the horror, she turned away from him.15 Danaus had fifty daughters, the Danaides, and Aegyptus had fifty sons. Aegyptus commanded that his sons marry the Danaides and Danaus fled to Argos, ruled by king Pelasgus. He instructed his daughters to kill their husbands on their wedding night. Forty-nine followed through, but one, Hypermnestra, refused because her husband, Lynceus, honored her wish to remain a virgin. The 49 girls buried the heads of their husbands in Lema, separate from their bodies which were deposited outside of the city-walls.157 Eurystheus: after Heracles died, Eurystheus attempted to destroy his many children, the Heracleidae, led by Hyllus, who fled to Athens.

Miracle horses, horse burials and horse sacrifices
Horse skeletons are extremely rare in the Mycenaean period. The horse skeleton uncovered in Vrana near Marathon, and two of the four horse skeletons from Dendra in the Argolid, cannot be dated earlier than the beginning of MH (1900 BC.), but they are, very probably, somewhat later. The first pair of horses, found in the Middle Helladic B tumulus at Dendra, were secondary burials dating from the Late Helladic I period (1600-1500 BC), in other words, they are later than the first burials of Grave Circle B at Mycenae from around 1650 BC. The other two horse skeletons, uncovered near tumulus C, predate the LH. Three of the four horses were 13-17 years old stallions or geldings. No chariot remains were found beside them, although it must be noted, in all fairness, that the position of the first pair in the grave suggested that they had been fitted with horse yoke, or horse collar.161 Hielte-Stavropoulo has discussed in detail all the early horse finds that have been found in Mycenaean Greece. Most of these came from burials, usually from graves in the Argolid: Nauplion, Dreiras, Lema, Aidonia near Nemea (the fourteen horse remains from this site included ten skulls and a complete skeleton), Argos (Kokla162) and grave IV of Grave Circle A at Mycenae. Most of these date from the LH period, the earliest being the horse remains
161 Hielte-Stavropoulou 1994, passim. I would here like to thank her again for kindly allowing me to read the manuscript of her dissertation. Although the dates are not given in radiocarbon years, they were nonetheless affected by radiocarbon dating and are early, i.e. high dates. - See Dickinson 1994, 19. This is again a tell-tale sign that there are attempts to reconcile the traditional view with the Kurgan theory since a date before 1900 is not as far from the date of 2200, around which the latest genuine Pit graves (kurgan or ochregrave burials) in Hungary, the Voivodina and Bulgaria can be dated in the traditional chronological framework. This date of 2200, however, can be adjusted to 3000 using radiocarbon dating and in this case the arrival of the Proto-Greeks is not chronologically closer to the Kurgan period. 162 Four skeletons of horse and one dog were found here in a Mycenaean shaft grave. See J. Boessneck - A. von den Driesch: Die zoologische Dokumentation von vier Pferden und einem Hund in einem mykenischen Schachtgrab in Kokla bei Argos.

from Mycenae, Vrana and Dendra. The archaeozoological analysis of these horse remains has proven that, in contrast to Bokonyi’s rash and mistaken opinion, 3 these large horses were steppic, Przewalski type animals}M The legs of the horse from grave 3 of tumulus I Vrana had been cut off (the forelegs together with the scapulae) in order to fit the skeleton into the small cist grave, rather than out of ritual considerations. The two horses in the tholos had been sacrificed as part of the funerary ritual and they were intact. The horse from grave 3 can be dated to the early Middle Helladic period (perhaps to around 2000), since this burial is one of the earliest ones of the burial ground containing at least seven tumuli. The tholos, with its two horses, can be assigned to the LH II period, around 1500-1450. All these horse remains belong to phases long after the end o f the Pit Grave culture.
Horse sacrifice is rarely observed in the second mill. BC archaeological material of Greece, and also rarely mentioned in Greek sources. Such remains - with only one exception - are related to simple horse burials. Achilles sacrificed a pair of horses over the funerary pyre of his dead friend Patroclus. This custom is unique in the Iliad. 65 The great part of the relevant finds can be considered horse burials in graves of nobility and warriors. Most of such burials - often called sacrifices - comes from the Argolid and are well attested in the Late Helladic period.1634566 In most cases, they escorted the deceased to his resting place. The paucity of attested horse sacrifices in the Mycenaean period suggests that such a ceremony was not used very often. It is assumed that horses intended for sacrifice were yoked to the chariot which carried their deceased master. They were slaughtered after the body was interred and were subsequently deposited in the grave along with the funerary vehicle. One funerary horse sacrifice was observed in Tholos tomb A at Archanes, Crete and dates to the Late Minoan III period.167 The

horse was sacrificed in honour of a woman who was buried in the side room of the tomb. The six year old animal had been slaughtered and dismembered. The head was severed from the neck, the legs from the belly, and the sides from the backbone. The lower jaw had become detached from the skull and had been divided in two. Part of the thigh had also been divided. The shoulder bones of the animal also clearly retained marks of cutting, made by a sharp instrument, probably a knife. It is interesting that after it had been dismembered, all the pieces of the slaughtered horse were gathered together and carefully placed in position, as is clear from the legs, which are bent at the knee. The custom is known from both Mycenaean Greece and Cyprus.168169Both in the asvamedha-ntaaX of the Vedas (Rig-Veda I. 162) and in horse sacrifices of the Celts, the horse was cut into pieces, then parts of it were cooked and eaten in a ritual meal. Other parts were used for further blood sacrifice. According to the famous Asvamedhahymn of the Rig-Veda, “small particles of the horse flesh which the flies have eaten, those which remain sticking to the sacrificial post and to the hatchet, and those which remain adhering to the hands and finger-nails of the immolator” (Rig-Veda I. 162.9). There is an interesting, however late, parallel of cutting the horse to pieces at sacrifices, this time at a ceremony of taking an oath, when the suitors of Helen swore an oath promising to defend the interests of the successful winner. The curious, and rarely mentioned, ceremony was described by Pausanias: On the road from Sparta to Arcadia there stands “the Tomb of Horse. For Tyndareus, having sacrificed a horse here, administered an oath to the suitors of Helen, making them stand upon the pieces of the horse. The oath was to defend Helen and him who might be chosen to marry her if ever they should be wronged. When he had sworn the suitors he buried the horse here.”170 Horse sacrifice at a ceremony of taking an oath was also customarily in the society of the Mongol khans in the 13th -14th Centuries AD.171 The presently known oldest source, however, in relation to oath-taking and equid

sacrifice comes from the eighteenth century Mari where 'to kill a donkey foal’ was a technical term for making a covenant. These facts can be summarized as follows: the horses of classical antiquity were derived from animals domesticated upon the northern steppes and brought into the Mediterranean region from the early second millennium BC onwards. Representations of horses can be seen on stelai found in the Shaft Graves of Mycenae. Bones of domesticated horses, coming from sure contexts, how ever, have not been reported from EBA sites and cemeteries as yet. The dismembering sacrifice of horses (as seen in Archanes and recorded by Pausanias) has its excellent parallels in the Sintashta culture of the Volga-Ural area, esp. in the Bolshekaragansky ceme tery17273 i.e. in the same culture and area where disc-shaped lugged bit-ends (as parallels of similar finds from the shaft graves at Mycenae) and bone 'shovels’ have been found. Among the earliest evidence for the horse as a significant religious symbol in Greece and Crete is the dismembering sacrifice structurally related to those known from the area of Indo-Iranian tribes of the Bronze Age. Connecting rituals and beliefs can be traced back to the same area, and influences derived from this northern common stock of myths were shared among the various Indo-Iranian cultures to which the horse became an indispensable property.
Winged, immortal and man-eating horses are an important part of the Ancient Greek mythological narrative. The person, or the family, of Sisyphos connect several threads of such stories together. These mythical events might be considered results of independent developments taking place in Mainland Greece after the introduction of the first domesticated horses from the North around and after 1900 BC. Such Greek narratives, however, can also be interpreted as elements in Greek myth which came from the

North, from the steppe lying north and northeast of the Pontus Euxinus, i.e. from Scythia. I support this last possibility.
Bellerophontes and the Pegasus. The elder Glaukus was the son of Sisyphus (son of Aiolos) and Merope, and the father of Bellerophontes who, according to another tradition, was a son of Poseidon and Eurynome.174 He asked his father for a winged horse, which Poseidon granted him. But it was not easy to catch and hold the beast as he drank, for the bridle had not then been invented. So the hero endured much in his desire until, in a dream, the virgin Pallas brought him the bridle of gold. The dream was, straightway, waking truth. And she said: 'Sleepest thou, prince of the house of Aiolos? Come, take this charm for the steed and show it to the Tamer thy father as thou makest sacrifice to him of a white bull. ... Bellerophontes, having made sacrifice to Poseidon, raised an altar to Athene Hippia. Thus Pegasus became his property, sent him by Poseidon, but led to him and bridled by Athene. The hero mounted the divine steed and danced the war-dance with it, in full armour, to the goddess’ honour.’175 After attaching the bridle to Pegasus and mounting him, Bellerophon became a formidable airborne warrior. He overcame the Amazon archers by picking them off 'from the empty air’s cool bosom’.176 We know the story of the birth of Pegasus: when Perseus cut off Medusa’s head, Medusa was with child by Poseidon of a hero and a winged stallion, Chrysaor (the 'golden-sworded’; also a son of elder Glaukos) and Pegasus. They leapt out through the neck from the body of their beheaded mother. Pegasus, the stallion drank from the spring Peirene, a double fontain in Corinth. The name Pegasus itself displays a connection with a spring, pege. Hippukrene, the 'fountain of the horse’ on Helikon, was supposed to have sprung up from under his hooves. He was the immortal4

horse by his mortal brother Bellerophontes (who too was a son of Poseidon).177178 Bellerophontes, 'the slayer of Belleros’ or the 'Belleroskiller’ is said to have had some other name. For instance Hipponoos, a name which connects him with the noble steed, hippos. Or in his young manhood was still called Chrysaor: the 'golden-sworded’.1 8 After the slaying of Belleros he had to do penance and must have himself purified. Proitos of Argos, the great king of Tiryns and sovereign of the whole land of Argos, cleansed Bellerophon from homicide. After his adventurous journey to Lykia, the hero came flying on his winged horse back to Tiryns, to take vengeance on Proitos’ wife. The hero took her on Pegasus’ back and let her fall into the sea by the island of Melos. A fall from Pegasus, whether or not he was guilty of that loving woman’s fall, was soon to be his lot too. According to the story,179 he wished to ride up to heaven on his steed and intrude upon the counsel of the gods. He was seen on his flight to heaven above the stage in one of the tragedies of Euripides, the Bellerophon. Unfortunately, the divine stallion threw his rider, who fell on the plain of Aleion, far off in Asia Minor. The undying Pegasus, however, carries the thunderbolt for the King of the Gods, or serves the Goddess Eos. He was taken up to Olympos, to the ancient mangers of the divine steeds.180 The invention of the bridle by the Virgin Pallas can be related to the invention of a new type of bridle in the Volga-Don area around the end of the Early Bronze Age. The occurrence of this steppe type of horse gear (i.e. the already mentioned disc-shaped cheek-pieces) for instance at Mycenae in the Shaft Grave period is well known.181

sent Heracles for longer and longer journeys to distant lands. The object of the journey to Thrace was to bring the dangerous horses of king Diomedes to Mycenae. These four horses ate human flesh, and they were winged. It was later alleged182 that they were the same which had tom Glaucus, son of Sisyphus, to pieces at the funeral games of Pelias. They were at home in Thrace, the land of Boreas the North Wind, who mated with mares.183 It was said of the cruel Diomedes, son of Ares, that he kept his savage horses fastened with iron chains to their bronze manger and fed them on the flesh of unfortunate strangers.184 To tame them, Herakles threw their master himself to the steeds to devour and brought the beasts with him to Mycenae.185 Boreas had two sons, two daughters, and twelve mares which were said to be able to run across a field of grain without trampling the plants.186 He mated with his mares. Pliny thought that these mares might stand with their hindquarters to the North Wind and bear foals without a stallion.187 Arion. According to the Thebaid (dating from after 573) Adrastus was one of the three kings at Argos. When his sons-in-law were chased out of Thebes, Adrastus helped organize the attack of the Seven against Thebes. Adrastus was the only survivor of the battle, thanks to the marvellous horse Arion: Poseidon fell in love with Erinys, and changing his form into a horse he had intercourse with her. She conceived and gave birth to a horse, which was called Arion because of its supremacy. Copreus, who was king at Haliartis, a town in Boeotia, received him from Poseidon as a gift. He gave him to Heracles when the latter stayed with him. Heracles used him to compete against Ares’ son Cycnus in a horse race, and won. In turn, Heracles gave the

the Theban war when all the others perished. According to Pausanias, Demeter bore the sable-haired horse Arion by Poseidon. Later poets hint at Arion uttering a prophetic speech at the Games for Archemoros at Nemea1889or when Adrastus fled from the war at Thebes.190 Achilles had horses, Xanthus (’yellow’) and Balius, of supernatural pedigree who are capable of speaking to him. We find the name Xanthus in the Iliad (19. 399-417) as one of these divine horses, who had a conversation with the hero: Achilles in a clarion voice ... shouted to the horses of his father: 'Xanthus and Balius! Known to the world as foals of great Podarge! In this charge care for your driver in another way! Pull him back, I mean, to the Danaans, back to the main body of the army, once we are through with battle; this time, no leaving him there dead, like Lord Patroclus!’ To this, from under the yoke, the nimble Xanthus answered, and hung his head, so that his mane dropped forward from the yoke-pad to the ground ... 'Yes, we shall save you, this time, too, Achilles in your strength!’191
The horses o f Hippolytus. In Greek mythology, Hippolytus was a son of Theseus and Hippolyta. When he was riding in his chariot and driving beside the sea, Poseidon sent up a bull from the surf. The horses were frightened, the chariot dashed to pieces, and Hippolytus, entangled in the reins, was dragged to his death.192 Bukephalos, meaning ox-head, was Alexander the Great’s horse. Bucephalus was supposedly a terror, unable to be ridden and

devouring the flesh of all who tried. Alexander, however, managed to tame him. Plutarch tells the story of how in 344 BC, a 12-year old Ale xander won the horse. Philonicus the Thessalian, a horse dealer, offered the horse to King Philip II for the sum of 13 or 16 talents. Since no one could tame the animal, Philip wasn’t interested, but his son Alexander was and promised to pay for the horse should he fail to tame it. Alexander was allowed to try and surprised everyone by subduing it. Alexander spoke soothingly and turned the horse away so that the horse didn’t see its own shadow, which seemed to distress it, and so tamed the horse. Pseudo-Callisthenes presents a mythic variant of Bucephalus’ origin. In this tale, Philip is presented with a colt bred on his own estates. The heroic attributes of the animal surpassed Pegasus. The mythic attributes of the animal are further reinforced by the Delphic Oracle, which tells Philip that the destined king of the world will be the one who rides Bucephalus, a horse with the mark of the ox's head on his haunch. Like his hero and ancestor Achilleus, Alexander viewed his horses as “known to excel all others - for they are immortal. Poseidon gave them to my father Peleus, who in his turn gave them to myself’.

Short summary of Indo-Iranian and Greek details
Ancient Greek beliefs and sacrificial customs connected to horses could have been introduced to Greece parallel, and contemporaneously, with the introduction of domesticated horses from the Lower Danubian area and the Volga-Don-Dnieper steppe belt from the beginning of the 2nd Mill. BC onwards, especially when, as suggested elsewhere, Early-Iranian (or Indo-Aryan?) warriors invaded Middle Mycenaean Greece around 1700 BC. Such, and other, correlations suggested to me, already in 2000, that a number of customs, features and find typs had become implanted into Greece in connection with the arrival of the first Mycenaean rulers. Direct male antecedents of the Mycenaean warrior aristocracy did not speak an early Greek (Achaean or other) tongue but they where speakers of an Indo-Iranian dialectal group, like their Indo-Aryan, Mitannian and Proto-Iranian peers who were also successful charioteers, and invaded their later historic homelands contemporary to the foundation of Mycenaean power around the middle of the 17. Century BC (when the first tombs of Grave Circle B at Mycenae were buried). 93 The use of the horse has generally been postulated as one of the main reasons why peoples speaking Indo-Iranian languages were able to dominate the huge parts of Eurasia into which they expanded during the first half of the 2nd Mill. BC. The appearance both of new types of objects and new customs and mythical stories (also related to gold antlered hinds and gold harnessed horses) can be best explained by postulating the intrusion of foreign groups. The geographical origins of these mythical stories and customs definitely point to somewhere in the north, from the Lower Danube and further to the east on the steppe and forest steppe belts. There are reasons to regard the arrival of northern objects and mythical stories as an invasion of aggressive groups rather than as a process of diffusion or wave of advance: first of all the appearance of chariotry, the introduction of the domesticated horse and related customs (horse harnessing, horse sacrifice, stone tomb stelae with

representations of chariot, hunting scene with a stag on a gold ring from grave IV in Myceanae194). Mythical narratives and magic gifts, characteristic only for more northern territories, surely belonged to the list of such elements of steppic origin, together with new type of horse harness (disc-shaped cheek-pieces) and weapons (new type of the composite bow). The Indo-Aryan name of Meriones, the charioteer of Idomeneus, 95 and the magic power of Autolykos (a sorcerer who knew how to put antlers on the heads o f suckling hinds, and also on heads o f horses) were parts of such early steppic elements, the prehistory of which can be traced back, on their original steppe territories, to very early, Early Bronze Age and even Upper Palaeolithic, times. The veneration in which horses were held by early Indo-Iranians of the steppe, and the horse sacrifice accompanying its earliest domestication in the Early Bronze Age followed the horse wherever it was brought.196 In Early Mycenaean Greece, too. As I also wanted to prove,197 the legendary story about the inland wandering of Odysseus also reflects dim memory of the original home of those Early Iranian aristocracy who came to take a firm stand in Argos and lay the foundation of the Mycenaean royal power. The long oar, or 'winnowing-fan’ of Odysseus198 can, in my opinion, be only interpreted by the help of one of the specific symbolic finds of Early Bronze Age inhabitants of the steppe and 1 forest steppe belts of the Ural-Volga-Don area. These symbolic finds, the so-called cult shovels or spades, were power symbols of the Andronovo culture and its territorial group, the Sintashta culture in the first quarter of the 2nd Mill. BC.199 Odysseus, on the other hand, is linked by many traits to Sisyphus and stories around him, even he was his son. Sisyphus’ grandson, Bellerophontes further connects this chain to the circle of narratives about the miracle horses, and as such, to the origin of domesticated horses

from the steppe area in the Early Bronze Age.200 Curiously enough, there are mythological details according to which Odyssesus had become a horse.201 An important part of these mythical stories, the invention of the golden bridle and giving of it by the Goddess Athena to Bellerophontes is in full accord with one important archaeological discovery, that of the disc-shaped cheek-pieces by people of the same Andronovo-Sintashta groups around the end of the first quarter of the 2nd Mill. BC.202 As a matter of fact, this type of horse bridle has its very good parallels in similar pieces discovered in Shaft Grave IV at Mycenae, Athens, Dendra and Kakovatos, dating to the beginning of the LH or shortly before.203 As I have already mentioned, the late A. Heubeck, writing a general introduction to the modem commentaries on Homer’s Odyssey, remarked as follows: “There are many indications that Odysseus is a very ancient figure in Greek myth. Not only is there his name, which, like that of Achilles, cannot be explained from Greek and points back to older strata. There are also many adventures and situations which seem to be closely connected with our hero from the very begimiing of literate tradition: encounters with witches and giants, monsters and cannibals, his journey to the underworld, his contacts with daemonic beings. All this suggests that Odysseus’ roots lie in the world of fairy-tale, perhaps even in the realm of magic and shamanism”.204 All this is in full harmony with the abovementioned details. Three decades before, the late Emily Vermeule wrote in her excellent lecture to the effect that “the agricultural and nomadic world of Europe, South Russia, and the Balkans may impinge closely, ... there is certainly a link in habits, profusion of gold ad ceremony of rite, love of horses, stags, and lions in odd decorative poses, intricacy of ornament and crescendo of rhythm, though few

direct archaeological links.”205 Since then, the number of suggested archaeological links has considerably increased.206 Bronze Age cultures with domesticated horses, chariots and a bronze metallurgy appeared in a wide and long zone from the Carpathians to the Pontic ^steppes, with related groups as far as the Urals and beyond207 (Sintashta and Arkaim). The importance of chariotry and well-trained domesticated horses is reflected in the occurrence of steppe types of horse gear for instance at Mycenae in the shaft grave period.208 Other northeastern (steppic) parallels include the similarities between the ‘barbaric style’ of Mycenaean gold metallurgy and Scythian gold (whose finest pieces were made by Greek craftsmen of the Classical period).209 As Vermeule wrote, “many sensible archaeologists realized from the start that some finds of the Mycenaean Shaft Graves were barbarous in one sense, not yet the predictable creations of a settled civilization, but to some degree consistent with itself’. The question can even be raised as to whether the people buried in the Shaft Graves were newcomers to Greece.21021 As seen from the point of view of archaeology, only one piece of the A-graves points to Anatolia, the silver stag drinking cup or rhyton from Grave IV. On the other hand, the stag was very much favoured in northern nomad art. Together with the hunting scenes of the Shaft Graves, the famous Alaca stag-hunting frieze2” is a strong link between the stag-hunting world of Mycenae and the North. This suggestion can be strongly supported by the represen tation of the bronze bowl from Kastamonu, dating to the Hittite

Imperial Period, and depicting a ritual hunt for deer with the help of a domesticated (!?) stag.212 E. Vermeule concluded by saying that “whether we regard the people buried in the Shaft Graves as newcomers, IndoEuropeans from the north or Northeast, or as a special elite group among those who had already entered Greece at the beginning of the second Mill. B.C., it is clear that they are non-Mediterranean people, ...”.213214I consider them Indo-Iranian newcomers coming from the north as a special elite group entering Greece indepen dently from Proto-Greek invaders, on their own, contemporary with Indo-Aryan and Proto-Iranian invasions of Central Asia, Western India and a part of the Middle East, before and around the middle of 2nd Mill. B.C. I think that evidence listed above can support the preliminary suggestions made by E. Vermeule three decades be
To sum up, there appears to be a possible connection between early steppe groups of the 2nd Mill. BC., and the peoples of Mainland Greece of the early 2nd Mill. BC. These early steppe groups probably were a Proto-Iranian- or Early Indo-Aryan speaking people who moved southward to overrun emerging townships of Hellas around the end of the Middle Helladic

See Roheim 1917/1984, 224. 213Vermeule 1975,22. 214 J. Muhly later refined this theory by claiming that although a direct contact can hardly be assumed since a thousand years separate the two gold metallurgies, a common nomadic background can be supposed. This nomadic world, as envisioned by Muhly, is rather odd, seeing that only its burials are known and that its royal burials are distributed from Maikop to Alaca Hoyiik and Pazyryk (although for anyone thus inclined, the distribution of the steppic nomads could be extended to include also the burials from Bab edh-Dhra and Avaris, the Egyptian capital of the Hyksos). Not only are the graves of these alleged nomadic invaders known from Mycenae, but also their palace, and they apparently also built palaces for the Achaean princes at Thebes, Orkhomenos, Tiryns, Argos, Athens, Pylos and elsewhere. The comparison with the nomadic world and the Scythians is thus virtually useless for solving the origins of the Proto-Greeks.

T
period.215 Their successful campaigns supposedly had a role in founding the Mycenaean society; the rule over which was based on fortified centres, organized in accordance with blood relations of Early Iranian/lndo-Aryan invaders in early Mycenaean times. As a result, legendary Greek heroes were closely related in blood or by marriage. Traces of these beginnings with offshoots of Early Iranian/lndo-Aryan influences persisted in Greece throughout the second millennium BC, including belief in, and narratives on, miracle hinds with golden antlers. In the first millennium BC., mythical stories appear to be a continuation of these Bronze Age steppic influences, marked by curious recollections of the distant past, as Pontic relations of Achilles, Herakles and other Achaean heroes, including the adventures of Odysseus clearly show. Very probably, most of the legendary heroes were descendants of the early second-millennium BC. Iranian/Aryan noble leaders that seem to have been intruders from the steppes. In any case, Greek mythology may have somehow received/inherited the notion of the gold-antlered hind through them. This motif of the Scythian art was first associated by Gy. Laszlo with the reindeer, which was native to the forest steppes of Eurasia till the beginnings of the Bronze Age. This circumstance made possible the emergence of the belief in a mythical hind, wearing golden antlers, amongst Early Iranian, and also Early IndoAryan tribes. I think that the Artemis-Heracles variant of the motif of the Miracle Stag is not a preserved Indo-European myth, but that it is an example of a type of mythical story found in Indo-Iranian literatures and archaeological material showing a peculiar, characteristically Indo-Iranian influence in the Early Greek mytho logy. K. Kerenyi, in his important paper, published only in Hungarian, was the first who refused the independent Greek origin of symbolic narratives about the Miracle Stag.216 On the other hand, the origin of it may reflect one root of the earliest IndoEuropean mythology, going back to Upper Palaeolithic times. Dividing the world into three broad climatic categories - the northern nomadic, the temperate farmers and city-dwellers, and the tropical - one can focus on common solutions that Man the Artist

has devised for the problems posed by his environment, a factor that also determined the nature of his society, its religion and arts. The solutions are shown to have been very similar worldwide within each broad environmental zone, and the pattern can be demonstrated in the arts no less than in social organization and religion. The Miracle Stag motif serves to illustrate the most ancient art of the northern zone and the many similarities to be observed in the Mycenaean and Early Greek art of the temperate farmers. In other cases of suggested Indo-Aryan - Early Greek com mon heritage, N. J. Allen came to the conclusion that “the respective narratives grew up in the geographical areas where the deeds of the heroes are set and where the epics were being orally related before they were written down. The two languages [protodialectal groups] go back to a proto-language [probably a Late Indoeuropean dialectal group], and it is increasingly recognised that the proto-language included a poetic language as well as a mythology.”217 Early sources about the miracle stag are evidence for a proto-narrative lying behind Greek and Sanskrit mythical and epic stories. Theoretically, the proto-narrative might have origin ated at a period considerably later than that of proto-IE unity, but there is a real possibility of its more earlier origin from the time of the Indo-European speech community during the Upper Palaeo lithic. In any case, the geographical area - where the deeds of the heroes are set and where the epics were being orally related before they were written down - was the steppe belt between the Car pathian Range, the Black Sea and the Volga-Ural area. Concerning its dating only a terminus ante quem can be suggested: before the Middle Bronze Age of the Pontic area i.e. before the 18-17. Centuries BC. The derivation of both Greek and Hindu myths from a common Indo-Iranian tradition in Late Neolithic - Bronze Age times (before the Middle Bronze Age) helps to explain some of the striking similarities of symbolic patterns in the two traditions. However, the lapse of more than two millennia between the Late Neolithic period and the early Iron Age, when the first written
217 Allen 1995, 3. - For essentially similar comparisons between Old Greek and Sanskrit narratives, see Louden 1999. - Ostmo 1997, 313. - Braarvig 1997. 66



versions of these myths appeared in both India and Greece, makes it hard to trace either the descent of separate traditions or connections between different traditions. New archaeological discoveries (representations, burials, etc.) can give further evidence to support my theory. The 'Hun story’ of 4th - 5th Century Byzantine writers pre served very old religious beliefs and, at the same time, the parti cipants symbolically returned back to the original place of the scene: the Maeotie marshes and the steppe belt. Presently known archaeological and written sources, however, do not contain any memory of similar narratives about miracle stags and hinds in mythologies of Uralic-Finno-Ugric peoples. Or only in concealed form behind other legends. Similarly to the case mentioned by Ta citus about a Northeastern Germanic tribe, the Nahanarvalv.
Apud Nahanarvalos antiquae religionis lucus ostenditur. Praesidet sacerdos muliebri ornatu, sed deos interpretatione Ro mana Castorem Pollucemque memorant. Ea vis numini, nomen Alcis.218219According to some commentary, the Divine Twins [Nasatyas or Asvins in Ancient India, and Dioscurs in Greek mythology] were also hippomorphic in the German mythology, called Alces by the Nahanarvali. The meaning of alcis, as recorded by Iulius Cae sar, was 'elk’. The reason of this identification was, very probably, because these hippomorphic Twin Brothers originally were elk.2
