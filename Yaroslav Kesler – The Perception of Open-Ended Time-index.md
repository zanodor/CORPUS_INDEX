The perception of open-ended time
THE PERCEPTION OF OPEN-ENDED TIME.
by Dr. Yaroslav Kesler discuss the article in our forum
"One of the main achievements of 12th century scholarship proved to be that it
made use of oral testimony and oral tradition.
Another great undertaking of 12th century historians, perhaps the most
difficult, was the mastery of time. As a result of a hundred years of evolution, the
entire West, finally, agreed to position every year in a continuous series from the
birth of Christ, and everything, without exception, began finally to relate that very
Christmas to one and the very same year - regardless of the doubts and hesitations
they had. Then, after universal agreement had been established relative to the
Christian Era, the historians had to resolve another complex problem: to indicate the
year from the birth of Christ for various dates where the texts reported to them and
to assign on one and the same chronological scale facts relative to which neither
written sources nor human memory reported a precise time. Experts on church
calendars, virtuosos in the area of chronology, and 12th century monks coped
with this problem so successfully that even today it arouses amazement in us."
(Bernard Guenee. "Histoire et culture historique dans l'occident medieval."
Moscow, Yazyki Slavyanskoy Kul'tury (Languages of Slavic Culture), 2002, page
411).
"In half a century of vigorous activity, Benedictine scholars salvaged,
considering their capabilities, everything from the past that could be salvaged. It so
happened that their successors did not find an incentive for new investigations in
this area. They simply continued to talk about their own time. The 12th century
historians were above all researchers. The 13th century historians were, first of all,
witnesses" (ibid. page 412).
Much more profound information about the perception by mankind of such
a notion, it is possible, as TIME is hiding behind these lines of the prominent
modern French historian, Bernard Guenee. And about the essence of a chronology.
Two completely different things are understood by the term "chronology." (1) A
chronology as a succession of events in time and (2) a chronology as a science
about the measurement of time. At the same time, by "historical chronology" they
understand a subordinate historic discipline which studies the systems of a
method of numbering the years and the calendars of various peoples and states,
and also helps to establish dates of historic events and the beginnings of historic
sources.
A chronology (1) is a retrospective reconstruction, inasmuch as the only,
sliding, point of counting time backwards -- present time, as a result, is
conventional. This in full measure relates to historical chronology.

A chronology (2) is a natural science discipline, inasmuch as it is based
on recurring measurements of oscillating and rotating natural cycles. This in full
measure relates to astronomical chronology.
Observation of the surrounding environment does not give man an absolute
"point for the start of time." The counting of time from the "Big Bang" is just as
conventional as, let us say, from the "Creation." But an observation of the
environment renders the ability of a comparison of ensuing events with natural
cycles. And these observations also underlay the numerous variants of calendars
long before the appearance of a chronology (1).
Which natural cycles has mankind been observing? The shortest - the daily cycle
of the rising and the setting of the sun. But this cycle, from the point of view of an
observer from Earth, is uneven in the course of a day itself within the limits of one
cycle (up to the Arctic Circle), and beyond the Arctic Circle the solar year generally
degenerates into one day which consists of one day and one night.
Second in increase of relative duration is the "tidal" cycle (connected, as we
now know, with the moon, but they didn't know this earlier.) The English word tide
"flood" is the same as the German Zeit, the Swedish and Norwegian tid "time" (also
compare the Dutch tij = flood and tijd = time), inasmuch as the coastal, and indeed,
even more so, the island inhabitants, naturally, measured their activity with the high
and low tides.
The somewhat prolonged lunar (monthly) cycle is most convenient because
of the ability of counting two-week (English fortnight) intervals between the first
and third quarters (the "growing" and "aging" moons) - phases of the moon, and
also, considering the full moon and new moon - the determination of a weekly cycle
and the establishment of a connection between daily and monthly cycles.
Still longer is the yearly cycle, subdivided into the "time of the year," it is
settled only later - with the aid of devices which allow the determination of the
equinox, and then also the solstice. This then relates also to the seasonal flooding of
rivers (for example, of the Nile), and to the onset of a season of monsoons in the
tropics.
The "Metonic Cycle" (19 years) and the "Solar Cycle" (28 years) are the
next stage in the mastery of the natural cycles for a local, but more wide-scale, tie-in
for time against the background of a starry sky. Observation of the planets is a
qualifying factor of the second order relative to these fundamental cycles. (Weather
conditions are a complicating factor, but which do not exclude observations of the
heavenly bodies.)
All the cycles mentioned are observed over the course of a human life. But
not one of them assumes the need of man in some kind of open-ended chronology
(1), inasmuch as from an everyday point of view the tie-in to some kind of them
simultaneously is both essential and sufficient.
The only irreversible process which may induce man to an open-ended
chronology is life itself. Only two dates are struck on grave stones: birth and death.
All the remaining biography is secondary. Yes, a definite continuity of generations
exists, which is realized in descendants, but not one of them (not with the cyclical
gene of protozoa) is a precise replica of an ancestor. And over the course of a
lifetime, people confront situations when the everyday counting of time is difficult
("a prisoner in solitary confinement without windows.") But sunset even beyond the
Arctic Circle is not so fatal for man as for a one-day butterfly. The most ancient
words, which reflect the notion of some kind of a final segment of time, characterize
the relativity of the notion "open-ended time" for a man absolutely.

I think hardly anyone will not see a clear connection between, let us say, the
English year, the German Jahr and the Russian Yar(a) = spring (compare also with
the Greco-Roman ora = "hour, time," and finally, era!) And so even the word,
denoting a year in the Russian language ("god") began to designate the notion
"year" only in the 16th century, and before that this word was connected with the
notion "holiday," a "good (= suitable) time" (as the Serbs have now). The Ukrainian
"godina" means "hour" (in Russian - "chas") but the Czech "chas" means simply
"time." English week, German Woche mean "week," whereas the Russian derivative
word - "vek" - initially meant "some elapsing period" (compare, for example, "40
years is a woman's lifespan"), but now it also is "100 years." That is, initially some
period is implied, and therefore, in Ukrainian we have rik (plural roki, derived from
"srok") which, again, now means "year," and so on. The Greek "chronos" still also
means "time," and "year," and "duration" (compare also the Russian "krug.", and
even English "ring" - from ancient "hring" ) The variety itself of the tie-in of words
which reflect the notion of some defined time interval, for a CONCRETE period
says in so many words that these notions have been fixed, according to historic
measurements, quite recently.
In this connection, we turn attention to the fact that the Greek word ENH meant the
"last day of the MONTH" (ENIAYTOC which has existed up to now means "year, a
large time interval, a cycle, a period." But the Latin word ANN(US) = year and the
Greek ENH - are twin brothers! Therefore, in OLDEN times, most likely, they
counted by months (naturally, lunar.)
Here, for example, is what the Central Asian historian al-Biruni
(traditionally dated to the 11th century) writes: "They say that when a warning of a
flood came to Tahmuras, and this happened 231 years before the flood, he gave an
order to select in his kingdom a place with wholesome air and earth. The people did
not find a place more worthy of such a name than Isfahan. Then Tahmuras ordered
the preservation of all knowledge and the placing of it in the safest place. This is
confirmed by the fact that in our time in Jay, [near] the city of Isfahan, they have
discovered hills in which they, when they excavated them, found facilities, full of
stacks of wood bast called "tuz" with which they cover the swords and shields. The
bast was covered with some kind of characters, and no one knew anything about
these characters and what in particular was inscribed."
It is obvious that it is possible to warn someone about a catastrophe
approaching in 231 years, but to expect practical actions in the near future in order
to avoid grave consequences is senseless even in our time: if he who both listens
seriously and begins to engage in this problem - of a future far away from the
closest descendants, then there will be an insignificant minority of them - even if it
is to create excitement artificially. But, let us say, a warning 231 months before, that
is, approximately 19 years - that is a fully realistic period for a predicted
determination of fate both at the given moment of the living and of the generation
immediately following. And this does not require bringing in such a religious notion
as "prophecy."
Those OLDEN times ended when annual counting replaced monthly.
When, then, was this able to happen?
For designation of the calendar year, besides ENIATOC, the Greeks also
have other words: ???NOC which already has been mentioned, and ETOC, the same
as in the Russian "summer" for the designation of years in the plural. The presence
itself of several words for the designation of one and the same notion (according to
Emile Benveniste) says that in the past they had a somewhat different meaning.
(But, as it is thought, in the works of Homer the words ENIATOC and ETOC were



2022. 03. 17. 16:28 Open Ended Time. By Kesler
web.archive.org/web/20200221120031/http://www.revisedhistory.org/oet.htm 4/21
used as synonyms. At the same time, it is difficult to judge whether ENIAUTOC is
connected with ENH-AUTOC - "this period, that same period," compare also he =
that, or, let us say, directly with ENH-ETOC, that is period = year.)
Both that and the other respond to the notion "end of the counting." But it is
important that the word ENH has one more, at first glance, meaning not connected
with the first: "the day after tomorrow." We shall add that for the designation of a
month there is the all-European MHN(AC). On consideration of the Russian
"month" in the meaning of the "crescent of the moon," MHN takes on the meaning
"rise of the moon after the new moon," in contrast to ENH - "the day before the
death of the moon," that is, "the end of counting," "the end of the period" besides.
Therefore, the meaning "the day after tomorrow," most likely, arose as "the night
after the new moon."
We note that up to now not one religious basis for the motivation of the
aforesaid has been brought in - there just had been no need.
Now we shall examine the evolution of such "historic" notions as "century"
and "millennium," which have no direct relationship to the life or the natural cycles.
(It is obvious that these notions were able to evolve only after the adoption of a
universal decimal counting system.)
They translate the Latin word saeculum as "sort, generation, a human
lifetime" and as "century." However, this word initially was in no way connected
with the notion of a "hundred" (the number.) But a human lifetime and the change
of generations, as we see, is connected directly with the notion "life cycle," in which
connection the word "cycle" is considered everywhere as adopted from the Greek
kyklos "circle."
In this connection it is somewhat logical to examine this "Greek" circle in
comparison with the Slavic "kolo" = circle (cf. also with Eng. "coil"). (Compare "se
kolo" with the Rumanian secol "century," Italian secolo, Portuguese seculo, French
siecle, Spanish siglo, and also with the Spanish sequelo = consequence.) In other
words - it is a GENERATION, a rotation of life in changing generations. A
generation according to "Constantine's Indiction" is 15 years, the recurrent taxation
on inheritance in an indicated order. The "Chinese," it is but the "Aztec" (!) period
for a generation - 20 years (3 generations for a 60-year calendar cycle. We note that
if the Chinese calendar is connected with the conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn, then
it could not have been created earlier than 1323.)
For comparison: right now a change of regular generations in the military
occurs approximately over 12 - 15 years (and even, for example, in the Osman
military 500 years earlier from a beginning recruit to a veteran it was 2 generations:
25 - 30 years.) The elite bureaucratic civil system of a "progression to
administrative bosses" is also approximately once in 15 years. Not only does life
span play a role in the determination of an average statistical term of a generation,
but also simply the onset of fertility (14 - 18 years). Then follows a period of
personality formation, the mastering of professions and the acquisition of families
(up to 30), the most productive, the "adult," period is approximately from 30 to 45
years, the "mature" period is 45-60, the "pension" is 60-75, and further there is only
the gerontological. He who has advanced so far. But on average, the number which
characterizes the change of generations clearly is close to that same 15-year
"indiction" - that is, to some average conventional term, but defined by experience.
"Constantine's Decree" is, per se, a consolidation of some statistical data
which had been collected by the time of its appearance. And what is more, this is
not religious, but fully "civil," that is a "worldly" rotation, that is a "secular age": a
notion, which, probably, was being well preserved even under the circumstances of



2022. 03. 17. 16:28 Open Ended Time. By Kesler

a religious demarcation and attempts at the establishment of a universal CHURCH
calendar all the way up to the Gregorian of 1583. In other words: approximately to
the end of the traditional 15th century, it is possible, there WAS NO accounting for
centuries at all.
The word "seculaire" (the spelling since 1611) in the French language
assumed the meaning of "centuries" for the first time in the form "seculare" in 1549.
Before this, the word "centenaire" (from 1370) was used in the meaning of
"centuries." The latter is derived from "hundred" (cent) and "a hundred" (centain).
And "seculaire," as too "siecle" (century, epoch, the present) is not! And this is
direct evidence that the introduction of the notion "century" as a chronological cycle
is connected not only with religiously-based calendar reform, but also directly with
"secularization" (secularisation, from 1567), that is, with the establishment also of
new "worldly" (in French, seculier, from 1260) rules.
Here is what the historian Apollon Grigor'evich Kuz'min writes ("The
Beginning of Rus." Moscow, Veche Publishers, 2003, page 201): "We note that the
literal meaning of the word "vek" in ancient times is the age of an object, a
phenomenon, a man. This is well known and confirmed by a large quantity of
sources (Sreznevskiy, etc.). This word was most used for the designation of the life
of one generation. The MAIN meaning of the Latin conformity to the Slavic vek is
saeculum - exactly a "GENERATION," "a HUMAN age," (Anan'ev et al.) The
Complete Latin Dictionary. 1862, page 761)." Further, Kuz'min talks about Russian
sources in which it follows from context that "vechi" = generations and not
centuries. (The same thing regards, for example, also the "ancient Icelandic" old
"generation, time, century" (compare with Russian leto = summer.)
Even more amusing is the English century, which is borrowed from the
French, but centurie never meant "century" in French, but only a military element
"a hundred"! It is then the "Roman century" (noted for the first time in 1284). And
the time of the appearance of English "century" which stands by itself as the
designation of a hundred years is direct evidence to the time of the introduction of
counting by centuries - simultaneously with the French seculaire, and with the
appearance of the notions of Trecento and Quatrocento and the like. The likely time
of the origin of the idea itself of counting by centuries is no earlier than the end of
the 15th century and most likely - the first half of the 16th century.
It is important that the definition "century" (saeculum) = 100 years is
axiomatic, that is, not requiring (and even not having) proof. The meaning of the
word saeculum = "100 years" was not able to disappear from use after its legendary
establishment for more than 1,000 years. There really are no natural reasons for
maintenance of this axiom. And there couldn't be.
What is more, the maintenance of the meaning saeculum = "century" simply is
inconceivable without the PRECEEDING notion "decade" in a denary system. The
numeral 100 in a denary system occupies a wholly definite place in the hierarchy of
this system relative to the base 10. The very word dekada "decade," which
designates "decade," was noted for the first time only in 1385.
(And the legendary "decennalia," supposedly introduced by Augustus and
which came to light in 1540, has no relationship to the continuous counting of time.)
If one looks at the traditional dates enumerated above, then the oldest of
them is 1260. This hardly is an accidental coincidence, as will be shown below.
Even the Greek notion of "chilieterida" as "millennium" is traced back no
further than that time. Etymologists are trying to connect the Greek "chilia" = 1,000
with the word "chera, cheri" - hand, having in mind that one can look at both it and
the other as a certain "end of counting." We note that the word "chilia" is in no way



2022. 03. 17. 16:28 Open Ended Time. By Kesler
web.archive.org/web/20200221120031/http://www.revisedhistory.org/oet.htm 6/21
connected with the common Indo-European word "hundred" (Greek hekato.) Just as
even the Greek "miriada" = 10,000 designates simply "many," and the Old Russian
designation 10,000 = "t'ma." And the Latin mille - this is originally also simply
"many," and only later is "thousand." In the Balto-Slav-German linguistic habitat
the situation is completely different, inasmuch as the compound word "tysyacha"
(English thousand, German tausend and the like) initially designates "a rich
hundred," that is a "great hundred." Here, in contrast to the Greek and Romance
languages, the reflection of a denary system of counting to a thousand is completely
clear.
Chilia - the origin of this Greek word is just as vague in Greek itself as it is
transparent in the Arabic: "The broad notion of guile (CHILIA) was used, in
particular, for the name of techniques which we at the present time would relate to
the category of applied mathematics and mechanics. Ilm al-khial - the "science of
skillful techniques" (literally "the science of guile," author's note) is discovered in
the medieval classifications of the sciences. To outwit God - and some medieval
Moslems posed such a problem to themselves." ("A Comparative Study of
Civilizations." A reader. Moscow, Aspect Press, 2001, pages 289-290. Aristotle,
Omar Khayyam, Iskhak as-Sabani, Ibn Ketiba ad-Dinuri and Ibn al-Irabi developed
"ilm al-khial." "Al-Mundji," Beirut, 2000). And the Jewish cabalists posed exactly
the same problem to themselves, in which connection everyone developed their
ideas in that same 13th century ("The Zohar"), and in the 16th century they were
picked up even by the Protestant mystics (Jakob Boehme).
At the same time, the word "chilia" is fully comparable with the Baltic
Slavic-German words which reflect besides a certain interval, a cycle: Ukrainian
khvilina "minute," Czech chvile, Polish chwila; Lithuanian valanda "a time
interval," English while, Dutch wijl, German Weile; Swedish vila "a rest, repose, to
lie, to rest", Norse hvil (rest), hvile "to rest;" English while, whilst "for the time
being, meanwhile," Dutch wijl, German weil, and also wave: Ukrainian khvilya,
Byelorussian khvalya, Bulgarian v"lna, Czech vlna, Latvian vilnis, Dutch zwalp,
German Welle, Swedish svall, Norwegian svalk, English swell "choppiness, surge"
and so on. We note again that in the Book of Psalms literally side-by-side is the
referenced "millennium" as derived from "chilia" (90:5), and "flood" (90:6). We
again draw attention to the fact that the word "wave" is now also used as a certain
indication of time.
But what did "millennium" mean until the appearance of an open-ended
chronology? From where in general was the interpretation by the Biblicists of the
duration of the "day of creation" as a millennium? Or, if one follows the ilm al
chial, NOW could one just as successfully interpret "day of creation" as a billion
years, while bringing into it, besides, the physicists, too? (This arbitrariness is the
same type as "render unto God what is God's, unto Caesar what is Caesar's"... well,
and unto the locksmith what is the locksmith's.)
What really happened in 1259/1260, actually, is known today to the one
Lord God, but there is real physical and chemical evidence of the extraordinary
NATURAL events of the time. The historians write that in expectation of the end of
the world, people who had gone mad ran into the woods and committed suicide.
The traces of a catastrophic event are observed everywhere in the Arctic
glacial core samples in the form of exceptionally powerful and keen (in the
assessment of time) acidic and sulfate spikes in the investigation of samples of
native ice which relate to this year. Over the course of 5,000 years before this, and
also after this, up to now nothing of the kind has been noted.

As vulcanologists think, it was the hugest eruptive event, the discharge of
which was transported from the source throughout the whole world. (Langway
C.C.Jr., Clausen H.B., Hammer C.U. An inter-hemispheric time-marker in ice cores
from Greenland and Antarctica /Ann. Glaciol., 10, 1988, p. 102-108.) In which
connection, a sign of this eruption is noted in the ice cores both of the northern and
of the southern hemisphere, which can are evidence not only of the great power of
the eruption, but also of the fact that it happened more likely in the lower latitudes
than in the middle or especially in the upper.
Nonetheless, there has been no success in tying the sulfate and acid spikes
of "1259" to a concrete volcano. There also is the opinion that this catastrophic
event was able to act as a trigger for the start of the Little Ice Age owing to the
pollution of the atmosphere with the solid and flying products of the eruption.
One can evaluate the catastrophic effect of the 1259 event in the power of
the spewing of sulphuric acid into the atmosphere in comparison with the eruption
of the Tambora volcano (1815), the total aerosol discharge of which into the
stratosphere was then in the estimates of Rampino and others on the order of 200
megatons. [Rampino M.R., Self S., Stothers R.B. Volcanic winters.- Annual Review
of Earth and Planetary Sciences. Lett., 16, 1988, p.73-99.]. The works [Raynaud D.
The total gas content in polar ice core. - The climatic record in polar ice.
Cambridge, 1983, p.79-82.; and Gerlach T.M., Graeber E.J. Volatile budget of
Kilauea volcano. - Nature, v. 313, N6000, 1985, p.273-277] estimate the discharge
into the stratosphere of aerosol sulphuric acid as a result of an eruption of the Toba
volcano (nearly 75,000 years ago) to be from 9?10^14 to 5x10^15 grams, at that
time as a total aerosol discharge, and according to Rampino for this eruption - from
1,000 megatons and higher. From this it follows (with an assumption of an
equivalent proportion of the components of the discharge for Toba and the event of
1259), that in 1259 from 3.6?10^14 to 2x10^15 grams were discharged, that is, on
the order of 1,000 megatons of aerosol, which contained not less than 100 million
tons of sulphuric acid. Plainly speaking, so much sulphuric acid came out in 1260
that a little would show up even now.
Such an abrupt impact on the environment was not able to occur without
very serious damage for the flora and fauna.
The fact that nowhere are there any records about a specific, gigantic
eruption of a volcano (and it clearly should have taken place in the inhabited part of
the Ecumene), speaks of the fact that this had to be NOT a volcanic, but an
extraterrial event, that is, a catastrophe caused by an extraterrestrial source.
From the end of the 14th century a natural climatic fall of temperature
actually began in Europe - as an undulating attenuation of a cataclysm, which was
expressed in two minima - the Maunder, and afterwards also the Sporer. In the 14th
century, seafaring in the Atlantic practically ceased due to constant storms. From
that same time, people began to build levees and dams - as in Moscow, so it was in
Holland. The tides in the enclosed Adriatic Sea were an order stronger than now.
Traces of the so-called "Dunkirk Transgressions" are well preserved to this time in
northern Germany - covered with the sand and silt of the woods and countryside.
There is no Aral Sea on the maps of the 14th-17th centuries - it is simply an arm of
the Caspian, which because of this is oriented length-wise not from the south to the
north, but from the west to the east. (According to the information of the geographer
A.V. Shnitnikov, the Caspian Transgression fits exactly at the 13-15th centuries.)
And what is more, a huge lake existed at the location of the Baraba Steppe, and the
present Karakum and Kyzylkum deserts were densely populated.

All of this may be explained by the consequences of the Earth's relaxation
after an impulse excitation from the outside. The migration of rats and the spreading
of the plague in the 14th century may be looked at as a direct
consequence of the cataclysm. And not only one disease - the common
plague, but also the bubonic plague, and tuberculosis, and scurvy and
so on. The "Time of the Plague" - as a generalized description - ended in the
middle of the 15th century.
In this connection, the designation itself of the Middle Ages is typical too in
15-16th century sources.
The Latin expression "media tempestas" (1469) is recorded for the first
time, where the word "tempestas" means not simply time, but "a time of tempest, a
time of cataclysms," (compare, for example, the English tempest - "storm"), that is,
it communicates a clearly negative characterization of the events of this temporary
interval. Later the formulation "media antiquitas" (1494) appears, that is, "middle
antiquity, that is, an interval approximately from the middle 13th century through
the middle 15th century is considered as the time of the "middle antiquity." Later the
expressions "media tempus" and "medium aetas" (1531), that is, simply, "a middle
time, a middle epoch," were noted. And in 1596 alone - "saeculum medium,"
simultaneously with "medium aevum" - as early as after the fact that the word
saeculum "vek" was associated with the notion "century." However, the expression
"middle ages" finally took on the modern meaning only at the end of the 17th
century.
It also relates to the notion of antiquity. The word antique was noted in the
French language in the 13th century. It is thought that it was made from the Latin
antiquus. But in Latin, "antequos" means "until some kind of events." Until just
which events? The Italian word antico came into use in the second half of the 15th
century. And here is what Vasari (1511-1574), the greatest art historian and critic of
the 16th century, who introduced in turn the term "Gothic" writes: "This style was
invented by the Goths, because after that, as the ancient buildings were
DESTROYED and wars ruined the architects, the SURVIVORS began to build in
this style, raising vaultings on lancet arches and filling all Italy with the Devil
knows what kind of structures."
A catastrophe caused by an observed extraterrestrial source, was unable not
to leave traces too in the mentality of mankind. An earthquake or flood does not
give directly grounds for connecting such natural cataclysms with "divine
punishment" - for this a visual observation of cosmic and atmospheric phenomena is
needed - that is, a sign. In which connection, the sign is perfectly unordinary: It is
not lightning, the northern lights, solar and lunar eclipses which are observed not
infrequently and do not bear perceptible harm. Comets and huge meteors come
much closer to this role if their debris reaches Earth.
In particular, danger which occurs from the sky is the strongest religious
motivation. In this connection a phenomenal occurrence of a prophecy is typical. If,
let us say, the catastrophe was connected with the disintegration of a comet passing
close by, then it was supposed to occur in not fewer than two phases, and this
explains a lot: those who have survived a catastrophe and connected the appearance
of a comet with it have told their children and grandchildren about it. One need not
be a genius to grasp that a comet that is going behind the sun, which unfurls a tail
sideways, opposite the start, has promised in so many words to return. But when it
returned, there were no such catastrophic events as there had been the first time,

although the sky grew red and once again a torrent of stone fell and so on.
Therefore, the descendants decided that the fears of the ancestors were too
exaggerated, and at the same time they simply put some prophets to death ("witch
hunts" and the like.)
When the witnesses to the catastrophe died out, the opinions of the
descendants were divided: some considered that the coming of the Messiah had
taken place, and they became Christians, others decided that the scale of the
catastrophe was not that and they still had to await the Messiah - as the Orthodox
Jews were educated. A third, the least literate, decided in general to do away with
prophecy: they declared that the last of the prophets - Mohammed - will remain the
last forever. But even subsequent generations continued to break off relations:
Moslems split into Sunni and Shiite exactly on the grounds of prophecy, and part of
the Christians preferred to have a permanently acting prophet in the person of the
Roman Pope.
The most paradoxical is that the "ancient Jews" were split last - in the 18th
century the Hasidic movement arose, again on the grounds of the recognition of
Saddic prophets! Such a model of development of present monotheism seems by no
means groundless.
Purgatory is another religious notion, whose origin one may connect
directly with catastrophe. The origin of the notions of "paradise" and "hell," as
interconnected alternatives in the idea of what happens at the end of life, is fully
natural. And here "Purgatory" is the idea of a procedure, with the aid of which the
Supreme Being divides the "pure" and the "impure": he who has endured trial - they
are the pure, those who have been lost were the impure, and for that they are
punished. The traditional historiography says that the idea of "Purgatory" was born
in the 3rd century: (Jacques Le Goff. The birth of Purgatory. The University of
Chicago Press. Chicago, USA. 1984) in the works of Clement, Origen and Cyrprian.
Saint Augustine (4th century) in the treatise "The City of God" uses the term
"poenae purgatoriae" for the first time, from which also arose Purgatory.
However, after this - all the way up to the 12th (!) century - the topic of
Purgatory disappears from the sources. in order to reappear for violent discussion by
the "fathers of the church," a list of whom is extremely impressive and includes
Albert the Great, Bonaventure and Thomas Aquinas. It is thought that the
canonization of Purgatory occurred in 1274 at the Council of Lyons. (At the same
time the Pope supposedly in fact recognized Purgatory as a canon as early as 1254
in his own correspondence.) The apogee of the development of the purgatory topic
is Dante's "Divine Comedy." However, the doctrine of Purgatory was introduced
only in 1439 (!) and was confirmed in 1562, inasmuch as Martin Luther resumed
the polemics about Purgatory at the start of the 16th century. (At the same time, the
Russian Orthodox Church never recognized the existence of Purgatory!)
It also is significant that at the turn of the 12th - 13th centuries, in a sense a
"French Jesus" appears on the historical scene - Francis of Assisi (Latin Franciscus
Assisiensis, traditionally 1181/1182 - 1226), the founder of an order of "destitute"
monks - the Franciscans, an advocate of the ideals of the "early faith." The most
zealous guardians of the teaching of Francis of Assisi are the so-called "Spirituals,"
that is, "non-money grubbers," who are called upon to feed on only the "Holy
Spirit."
The "Joachimites" - the followers of another teacher - Joachim of Floris
(1132-1202) - also spread the "heresy" of the French Jesus. He advanced
the following ideas:

1) The TRINITY as the triune of freedom, love and peace;
2) CHILIASM (from the Greek "chilia" = thousand, and not from the Latin
mille!), that is the future coming of the "thousand-year" era of the "Holy Spirit."
(Where a certain MILLENIUM appears for the first time as a measurement which
extended traditional history, "chiliasm" itself later was ascribed to those 1,000 years
backwards and was condemned as heresy!)
The economic "foundation of freedoms," in French Franchise Assise, fully
was able afterwards to be transformed into the "father of the Roman Catholic
Church," Francis of Assisi, whom they called an Umbrian monk from the town of
Assisi (or this town was named after him later on), canonized and raised in honor of
him a memorial complex (traditionally in 1228), however, the biography of Saint
Francis was composed by the general of the Franciscan Order, Fra Bonaventure
only in 1290, when the social movement of the "destitute monks" already had been
placed under firm control!
The movement for the purity of the "early faith" reached its apogee in 1251
with the publication of a book by Gerard of Borgo-San-Donino with the title
"Evangelium Aeternum." According to the calculations of the Joachimites,
Franciscans and Spiritualists, the fateful 1260 was supposed to arrive soon.
Somewhat later the works of Peter John Olivi (1248-1298) appeared, who
understood the history of Christianity thus: on the 13th day, the child Jesus was
shown to the three wise men, in the 13th year he left his mother and appeared in the
temple, and in the 13th saeculum (cycle, generation, epoch) after the death of
Christ, Francis, who established an "Evangelical order" was sanctified.
In parallel with this, repressive structures arise which are created by the
advocates of a strict hierarchical church authority. The fathers of the Roman
Catholic Church, Albert the Great (1206-1280) and Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274)
become the ideologues of this trend, which prevailed in the second half of the 13th
century.
Let us enumerate some other events which are ascribed to the 13th century
according to the traditional historiography. In Western Europe they smash the
Cathars, who were damned in 1215: in 1216, the order of militant "God's Dogs"
the Dominicans - is created for the struggle with the "heretics" (the aforementioned
Albert and Thomas have left the bosom of this order.) The church's hirelings cruelly
punish free peasants who do not wish to pay tribute to the clergy (for example, the
Steding slaughter of 1234.) In response, in 1260 the militant "Apostolic
Brethren" headed by Gherardo Segarelli appears which speaks out against the
church's authority. In Paris, Siger of Brabant preaches the teachings of Ibn-Rushd
(Averroes), generally denying God as Creator (he was killed as a heretic in 1284.)
In 1261, the "Latin Empire" fell, and in the same year Prince Daniel is born,
starting from whom Moscow started to rise in Rus. In that same interval, the "first
parliament" (1258-1264) appeared in England.
Before the middle of the century, the Jews who had appeared on the islands
in approximately 1210, enjoyed the patronage of the king, which is why practically
all England was in hock to them by the middle of the century, but in 1290, they
banish them completely from the islands. for 350 years!
In Northwestern Europe the "new" Hanseatic League of self-governing
cities is formed (finally formed in 1370.)
In the south in Egypt, the Mamelukes came to power, the "Reconquista"
were victorious in the Pyrenees, and the Arabs left Europe (except Granada).

In the East, with the death of the "heathen Khans" Batu and Mongke, a
struggle begins in the Horde for church influence on the
military leadership, which ends with the introduction by
Uzbek of Islam in 1317, after which the Horde began to fall
apart and underwent other fundamental changes.
It is obvious that everywhere a change of ideologies is occurring. Religious
monotheistic structures assume real power. For example, Pope Boniface VII (1235
1303, ruled from 1294) at first used to the maximum the Franciscan movement, and
afterwards destroyed their ideologists: in particular, Segarelli was burned at the
stake in 1300 - exactly, as the Roman Catholic Church historians write, in the first
"jubilee" year declared in history by this same Boniface. (Let us note that "1300
A.D." is an elapsed 13 hundred years, that is, their number is not too precisely
equal, and especially, is not "apostolic." Further below, dates from the "birth of
Christ" are cited inside quotation marks," except for dates in references.)
All these events have some central temporal point, a turning point - all that
same year "1260." Despite the fact that traditional dating of these events was
established much later than the 1260 catastrophe, the coming into being of dating
was vastly drawn out in time, and the change of the nature of the events described
BEFORE and AFTER the catastrophe cannot fully conceal the fact itself of the
catastrophe.
"1260" is a key year which, per se, can be the start of counting the modern
chronology. According to Joachim of Floris, exactly 12 saeculi = indicta =
generations, that is 15x12 = 180 years from the ascension of Christ were supposed
to pass and the 13th started, that is, the first in the coming thousand-year reign (era)
of the Holy Spirit, universal freedom, peace and love. (At the same time, the
"Passion" relates to the end of the "11th" century.) Moreover, in "1260" the third
era-wave-"chilia" was supposed to set in, inasmuch as the first two were
characterized according to Joachim of Floris as the "Era of the Father" and the "Era
of the Son." In other words, before "1260," conceivable history had been continuing
only 24 (= 2x12) generations, that is, 360 years from the start of the "first wave"
approximately from "900."
As an illustration of the defined chronological gap of
100-150 years after the catastrophe of the 13th century in
the geographic and demographic plan (in the "Time of the
Plague"), we shall examine the appearance in the sources in
the French language of references about people who lived up
to the present (according to "Le Petit Robert.") It is extremely
noteworthy. For example, at the 1080 level, when the French traditionally had
become aware of themselves as French (Franais, see that Gallic they became much
later: Gallican - 1355, Gaulois - since the 15th c.), are referenced: Allemand,
Flamand, Normand, Danois (the Danes), Saisne (Saxons), Romain (Romans),
Arabe, Judeu, Sarassin, Pers(ien), Espan (now - Espagnol, and at that Hispanique
is only since 1525). The "Easterners" are Levant (but Levantine is only from
1575, and Arameen is only since 1765!) Further: Hebreu - 1119. Anglais, Maure
(Mor), Dalmatique - 12th century. Grec - 1165, Latin - 1160. Bourguignon is the
end of the 12th century. Roman(s) = a common language - 1135. Mamelukes:
mamelos - 1192 (but mameluk is 1611, the modern mamelouk is 1808.)
The Bolgars also are mentioned in the 12th century. - as the Bogre (1172,
Bougre is 1450, Bulgare is from 1732!) And the inhabitants of Crete are the
Cretoise (1165). At the beginning of the 13th century - Egyptien (in which

connection, this word is also used in the designation of Gypsies) and the Venetien
are the Venetians. In the 13th century, the Druide (they will call them Celts much
later), Brabanon, Macedonien and Tartarin appear. And right here the word
"antique" - "ancient" also appears. Then there is Italien (1265), Assyrien and Indien
(1284). The Albigensians-Albigeois and the Dutch-Hollandais are
known from the 13th century (but at the same time, the word Hollande is
only from 1598, and the "ancient" Batavi are from 1740!) In 1300, the Turks are
mentioned for the first time - Turc. And here for the first time the Phoenicians also
are noted: as Punicians (Punique, as Phenicien is only in 1557!) The Scots
(Ecossaise) are in the 14th century. (1350).
Further, after a large gap: the Goths are Gothique - 1440, the Serbs in the
form Serve - 1441 (in the 16th century - Servien, now - Serbe.) The Catalans
(Catalan) - 1452. The Hungarians: Hongre - 15th century, Hongrois - 1470.
Inhabitants of the modern Czech Republic, earlier Bohemia are Bohemien and
Morocco (Maroquin) - in 1490. Here too is Suisse (the Swiss, in which
connection the "ancient Helvets" - Helvetique - is only in 1636!) The
main mass of medieval peoples are in the 16th century: Basque, Portuguese (the
Portugese) - in 1500 (in which connection, the more "ancient" Lusitanians
Lusitanien are only in 1584!) The Austrians (Autriche) in 1515. The Castillians
(Castillan) in 1517, the Frisians (Frise) in 1520, the ancient Belgie-Belgians - in
1528. Etruscans in 1534(!) "The Lithuanians are Lithuanien" (that is the Russians
of that time) together with the Prussians (Prussien) and the Georgians (Georgien)
in 1540. Napolitain is 1549, Sicilien is 1550. Ib'ere is in 1552, at first in reference
only to the aboriginals of the Caucuses and North Africa. At the same time, the
Armenians are Armenien (one of the peoples who are considered the most ancient!)
only in 1575. The Genoese (Genois) are in 1567. The inhabitants of Slavonia are
Slavon - 1575, and the Savoy are Savoyard - in 1580. (It is interesting that in
particular at this time the word which designates both the notion "Slavs" and the
notion "slave" - Slave - 1575 is noted in the form Sclave - 1573. That is, slavery as
a concept, from the point of view of the French - this is in the 16th century!)
In the second half of the 16th century the rest of the northern and eastern
community also appear: Czechs-Bohemien (1558), Irish - Irlandaise (1567),
Norwegians-Norvegien, Chinese- Chinoise (1575), Japanese-Japonaise, Swedes
Suedois, Muscovites-Moscovite (Russian - Russe only in 1715! At the same time
the Scyths-Scyhien - 1580, in the form scytic - somewhat earlier in the same
century), Poles-Polonais - 1588. At the same time Hellenes and Chaldeans came to
light (1580).
Somewhat later the Sardinians-Sarde - 1606, the Albanians-Albanais - 1612
and the Uzbeks in the form Usbeke - 1613, Uzbec is from 1765, and now Ouzbek.
In the middle of the 17th century - Croatians-Croate. Algerien - 1677, inhabitants of
Siam (Thailand) - Saimois - 1686. Ethiopians - Abyssin - 1704 (although the word
abysse "chasm" is from 1080). The Congolese-Congolais in the form Congois
1721, the Ukrainians-Ukrainien - 1731, the Czechs in the form Czekhes - 1762
(Tcheque - 1842), Finns- Finnois - 1772, Koreans-Coreen - 1797. Estonians
Estonien - in 1819, Slovenes-Slovene - 1825, Rumanians- Roumain - 1836,
Slovaks-Slovaque - 1841, Latvians-Letton - 1845.
It is typical that the affiliation of peoples with parts of the world in the
modern meaning (besides Australia) is noted in the 16th century: Asiatique, African,
Americain - 1556, Europeen - 1563.

The vanished 100 years from the point of view of the appearance of new
references is clearly striking: from the middle of the 14th through the middle of the
15th century. If the reference itself of the Scots is considered an isolated point
(having in mind a possible delay with their reference relative to the English), then
two groups are formed: those mentioned through the 13th century inclusive (ending
with the Turks) and the rest, mention of whom appears from the middle of the 15th
century. And it is significant that the mention of some "predecessors" of today's
peoples appears later than the mention of them themselves - the Batavi, the Frisians,
Helvets, Etruscans, Phoenicians, Aramites and so on.
Now about the religious and monotheistic component. The word
"catholique" is noted for the first time in the 13th century in the form "chatoliche"!
It really had to be used in order to reflect the Greek "katholikos." And the word
"orthodoxe" - in 1431. And this is similar to the truth - it is the time of the Ferrara
Council. It is funny, however, that "chatoliche" has something suspiciously in
common too with chteau (castle), 1175 (from castels 1080), that is "one sitting in a
castle".or in a tent, that is chtelain, 1190 - "castellan" - a stock keeper who
controls property. The Polish name of a Catholic temple also is typical - kosciol,
that is, the same as "castle-castel."
And with which "non-believers", infidels, did the French crusaders fight?
They did not know the word "mosque" (musquette, from the Arabic Masdjid, that is,
a place for prayer) before 1351 (today's mosque'e generally is from 1553). It is
typical that in the Rumanian language "mecet" not only is in essence a mosque, but
even a Turkish cemetery and a spiritual consistory (!) in general, that is, an
administrative and housekeeping service in the institution of any Christian Church.
They did not note minarets (minaret) until 1606, muezzins - in the form maizin
until 1568 (today's muezzin is from 1823). Imam (in the form iman) is
from 1559. And even the notion itself of a "Musulman" appeared with
the French only in the 16th century (from the Arabic "muslim" =
true believer, fidel)
It already has been said that the word "Saracen" (sarrasin) was noted in the
French language simultaneously with the word "synagogue" (1080), although,
according to traditional history, these same Saracen-Moslems (!) intruded on the
territory of France as early as the 8th century. At the same time, this word from the
Arabic is "charqiyin," that is, literally: "eastern". that is, Saracens are EASTERN
people with regard to the Arabs themselves!
Now we turn to how the presently adopted dating was formed. Here is a
fragment of history of the papacy (S. Lozinskiy): "Owing to internal dissensions,
Rome from the end of the 9th century went through a time of severe crisis, during
which the papal crown went from one pope to another, depending on who was the
stronger. In "877," Pope John (VIII, traditionally pontiff in "872-882") was even in
the prison of one of the feudal rulers, and after his freedom he left Rome and tried to
convoke a council in France for the punishment of his "oppressors." It did not
happen: The pope wrote "we expected. the light, but received the darkness." This
John, according to a chronicler from Fulda, became a victim of his own personal
policy: they gave him poison, and since he didn't die right away, the blow of a
hammer on the skull put an end to his mortal existence. That was the first in a long
line of murderous events in the middle ages of "God's deputy on earth."
We note that during this time, there is not in a single source any mention
about the start of a new "Great Indiction," according to which the Roman Catholic



2022. 03. 17. 16:28 Open Ended Time. By Kesler

Church now lives and which was supposed to begin exactly in "877" - if they had
known by that time that the preceding, "Constantinian," had begun in "345." But
they clearly still didn't know this then. But you see, this is the basis of the
calculation of the Easters!
The further history of the papacy with its depravity and murders by no
means reflects neither the earnest piety ahead of the future, it would seem, great
holiday - the "millennium" (that is, the 1,000 years from the birth of Christ), nor the
awe of the coming of a new "thousand years of Christ" - all the way to the selfless
devotion of the hermit Pietro Damiani ("1007-1072") and the Pope-Reformer
Gregory (VII, Hildebrand, traditionally pontiff in "1073-1095). But the distain for
the "millennium" is typical not only for the Roman Catholic Church: the "newly
converted" Kievan Rus (traditionally, Christian from "988") also in no way
celebrates this event.
Here is a characteristic example. A Papal Bull dated by historians and
archivists from 1002 after the birth of Christ is considered the oldest original
document of the richest archive of the city of Dubrovnik (Croatia). However, the
year after the birth of Christ in the text of the Bull is not entered - there is only
"indictum." In that way, the direct dating of the Bull is absent, inasmuch as the
indicta are repeated every 15 years, and the Bulls, which traditionally relate to the
11-13th centuries, are dated in accordance with the Popes of Rome. And, for
example, the referenced Bull is date according to Pope Benedict VIII. But the point
is, that there is no number "VIII" in any form in the text of the Bull - there is just
some kind of pontiff Benedict, and the circumstantial dating "according to the
Popes" was done much later than the writing of the Bull itself. If one is to date the
Bull according to material in comparison, let us say, with materials on which are
written papal documents of the start of the 15th century which are found in that
same archive, then the Bull can relate successfully not to the time of Benedict
"VIII," but to the time of Benedict "XIII." (True, in 1409 this Benedict was deposed
at the council in Pisa, but the deposed "antipope" resisted for yet a long time, until
they finally dismissed him in 1417 - at the council in Constance.)
And the English churchmen already are using the "Dionysius tables" and the
first date after the birth of Christ in England appears right at "675"! And the
chronicler, the Venerable Bede, in "731" already is using dating from the birth of
Christ, and the fist document of the papal chancellery with dating from the
birth of Christ appears only in "1431"! Thus it turns out that the English are
more pious than all the Roman popes in 700 years combined.
It is thought that the first official document in France with dating from the
birth of Christ appeared in "742." But from the end of the 9th century until the
second half of the 11th, there were no such documents anywhere! And no kind of
millennium is noted besides. They begin to compile lists of the kings and registers
of popes only in the 14th century. The numbering which appeared at the same time
of those of the same name often is confusing - look at one story alone of "Pope
Joan" (supposedly a former pontiff either in the middle of the 9th or at the start of
the 11th century), who emerged, as is thought, in the middle of the 13th century: this
pope herself was still happily counted among the popes in the lists of the 16th
century too, until in the 17th century the humanists forced the Roman Catholic
Church to remove this shameful page from their and in any case sham history.
At the same time, no one had yet mentioned this female pope in the 10th
12th centuries. However, according to the traditional history, in the first half of the



2022. 03. 17. 16:28 Open Ended Time. By Kesler

10th century a certain "Marusia" ran the affairs of the Roman Catholic Church
Morozia Theophylact, who lived with Pope Sergius and gave
birth not only to the future Pope John (XI) from him, but
also Alberic, the son of whom, that is, Marozia's grandson,
was named. Octavian, and he afterwards is also a pope, John (XII). This isn't just a
joke - it is simply an adventurous romance: that is, literally, "Roman history."
The hijra era of the Moslems, as is thought, was introduced
during the time of the Caliph Omar near the middle of the 6th century.
In the 20th century they suddenly discovered an Egyptian papyrus with dating of the
22nd year of hijra ("644/645" A.D.) and an epitaph with the date of the 31st year of
hijra ("652/653" A.D.) That is, the datings preserved according to the hijra are
earlier than the datings according to the birth of Christ! At the same time, the
written fixation of the first suras of the Koran is the start of the 14th century
(according to N. Morozov - in "1318." According to an assumption of V.
Polyakovskiy - in "1321," during the coordination of the calendars, inasmuch as the
start of the lunar and solar calendars practically coincided in this year in particular.)
Leonard da Vinci directly writes in his diary at the start of the 16th century
that Mohammed prayed. to Jupiter, that is, at first he was a heathen. Then, according
to the chronicle of Giovanni Villani, published in that same 16th century,
Mohammed sides with one of the Christian sects and only later with the aid of a
certain apostate monk, Sergius Georgius, organized his own spiritual
pursuit. The historian Mikhalon Litvin writes approximately the same thing in the
16th century.
And in the Koran there is a direct reference to the Gospel (Sura 57:27):
"Then We sent other messengers to follow in their footsteps;
and We sent Jesus, son of Mary, and GAVE HIM The GOSPEL; and
We filled the hearts of his adherents with kindness and
compassion. But MONASTICIM THEY PRACTISED." In other words, the
apostles (= those who followed Him) are noted in the Koran, but their "Acts" are
not. There are fragments of the Protogospels and the Apocrypha, but not of the
canonical Gospels.
According to traditional history, the monastic orders arose not earlier than
the turn of the 11-12th centuries. (the St. John, Cistercians, Templar, etc.)
All the history of the Benedictines, the order of which is considered in
existence since the 5th century, is imaginary, the order's structure was defined only
in "1128.") Per se, until the 12th century there was not even a notion of "order" as a
structure. (The word "order" itself designates "sequence," just as does the word
"horde." It is not an unorganized crowd.)
Further, in that same Sura of the Koran: "We ordained it not for
them - We ordained only seeking Allah's accord, though they
did not foster it as they should have." What does it mean here? The
quoted sura of the Koran is called the "iron." The only monastic order which was
destroyed officially before the middle of the 14th century is the order of
the Knights Templar (that is, the keepers of the Temple) in "1312" (in fact - in
"1307"): for refusing to submit both to the kings and to the Pope of Rome. Namely,
all metallurgical and weapons production was under the control of the richest order
of the Knights Templar (according to the official version founded in "1118"), which
had a branch ("brotherhood") around all of the Ecumene. The Temple of Solomon,
alongside of which was situated the headquarters of the Knights Templar - is today

the Mosque of Omar. The very same during the time of which, as is thought
traditionally, the hijra was introduced.
We see that immediately after the destruction of the Knights Templar in the
"14th" century in the traditional historiography there follows also the appearance of
the Islamic Vulgate (the prototype of the Koran) in the time of Sultan Osman, and
the acceptance of Islam in the Horde in the time of Khan Uzbek ("1317".) And
immediately after this follows the "Avignon Captivity of the Popes" ("1309-1377")
with all the popes and antipopes, a multi-papacy muddle - all the way until the real
appearance of the papal chair in Rome in "1377," not at the Vatican, as it still didn't
exist, but at Lateran! (By the way, Petrarch openly called this captivity not
"Avignonian," but Babylonian.) Pope Pius (the Second) called
himself Roman Pope N 9 - and he was right...
A universal struggle for power with strong religious overtones breaks out
also at the same time - here too is the destruction of the Capetians, and the coming
to power of the Osmans in Turkey, and the insurrection of the Zealots in Greece,
and the Hundred Years War, and the insurrection of Wat Tyler in England and the
"Ciompi" in Italy, and battles at Kulikovo and Kosovo Fields and so on. And all this
occurs against a background of that very universal plague. Naturally, in such
conditions the acceptance of a single open-ended chronological scale and the
coordination of calendars in the 14th century was difficult.
In this connection, the legendary story is curious of "Cola di Reinzo"
Nicola di Lorenzo, who at first opposed one of the popes and led an uprising of the
"popoplano" - in "1347," that is, at the height of the Plague (!), and then on behalf
of another pope, in "1354," they welcomed him to Rome as a victor and there and
then. they put him to death. We note that "Nikolai" is Greek, and is a "victor of the
peoples," so it is possible the legendary "Nicolaites," who are denounced in the
Gospel, are in actual fact followers of "the popular tribune Nicola". And we shall
add that Petrarch in his own sonnets numbers 3 and 78 speaks about 6 April "1327"
as the date of the Crucifixion.
It is significant, one and the same interval of time - 430 years - is indicated
in the Old Testament as a time of the "Egyptian captivity" before the Exodus of
Moses (Exodus 12.36) and in the New Testament (Galatians 2.12) - as the time from
the Exodus of Moses to Christ. It is not inconceivable that between Moses and the
Christ-Messiah there was no particular difference, and the figure cited simply
reflects the continuance of history, which really is known by the middle of the
"14th" century. In the Koran it speaks about the fact that Jesus on his mother's side
was the nephew of her brothers Moses and Aaron, that is, one generation separated
them. And they called Moses' father-in-law, a priest of the "Midianites," that is of
the "inlanders," Jethro (Exodus 3.2), that is in Greek "God bearer." Approximately
at this time the demarcation of the recognized and unrecognized "coming of the
Messiah" begins.
And only approximately by "1430" does a series of events occur which
consolidate society. Firstly, the rights of the popes were limited by the council after
the stormy administration of John XXIII ("1410-1415"), true, since "1958," the
Roman Catholic Church no longer considers him a pope.
Secondly, the Roman Catholic Church made short work of the "Hussite
Heresy" (we note that now the Russian Orthodox Church no longer finds any
ideological differences between the Protestant teachings of Huss and Orthodoxy.)
Thirdly, Sultan Mehmet (I, Mohammed), finally was through with his rival
brother Musa (Moses, "1413"), by which in fact the construction of the Osman
empire was begun.

In China the great and powerful emperor Zhu Di, who had destroyed the authority
of the "Mongols" and who gathered for his coronation, according to the Chinese
chronicles, all who had earned his attention (from the Persian shah to the Eskimos).
besides the remote kings of England, France Spain and Portugal, the Roman pope
and the Byzantine emperor, was crowned.
Subsequently, no less impressive meetings of the world's strong took place:
On the one hand, in the East of Europe - in Trakai, on the jubilee of Vytautas
Alexander, on the other hand, in the West - at the wedding of
Philippe Le Bon and Isabella de Portugal, where the founding
of the Order of the Golden Fleece was announced (on the
pluvial of the order were embroidered the portraits of all of
its cavaliers - sovereigns from Japan to Gibraltar.)
The apogee of the temporal consolidation is the Ferraro-Florentine
ecumenical negotiations (from "1431") and the creation of the union ("1439.")
In the West, this became the real basis for the production of a single open
ended method of counting the years and the beginning of the expression of a
traditional history. Only at this time did the Latin notion of Anno Domini finally
absorb into itself the idea of chiliasm. And instead of "from the coming of the
Lord's thousand-year era" there appeared "the year from the incarnation of the Lord
a thousand. such-and-such." Thus the idea of chiliasm gave birth to more than a
thousand year space for the writing of history.
Here is what Bernard Guenee writes, referring to the works
of Jean Mielot (Jean Mielot, ibid., pages 369-370): "In 1409 at
the end of the 'Golden Legend,' which he had completed several years earlier,
Nicola de Custura, a canon in Senlis, outlined in Latin on the reverse side of a sheet
3 decades of chronological inscriptions, to which, very likely, for him all world
history had been reduced. At that same moment, Thomas Marest, a former student
of a Paris university. cites the continuance of some time segments which mark the
history of the world from its creation to the birth of Christ. This somewhat
chronological data show how the knowledge of the clerics who were somewhat
interested in history, was restricted.
In the Orient, the lunar calendar remained popular, in which Mohammed's
flight from Mecca to Medina was adopted for the counting point - the same as the
Old Testament exodus of the "true believers."
There simply was no term "Julian calendar" before the 16th century. The
"Byzantine" accounting, as also other attempts at a method of counting the
years "from the Creation" continued to compete with the "new
eras" (from the birth of Christ and hijra): the "Byzantine"
accounting lasted in Russia until "1700"), the "Usher" Judaic calendar existed in
England along with the Christian until the middle of the 18th century. The
concordance of the "Byzantine" accounting with the Christian calendar (which
Kepler in "1601" still called the "era of Dionysius"!) happened even later than the
Gregorian reform - approximately by "1620," inasmuch as only then was the present
difference of the years from the Creation until the birth of Christ adopted - 5,508
years, and not 5,500 as it was before this.
The unified "Julian cycle", proposed by Joseph Scaliger and named by him
in honor of his own father (Julius Caesar Bordoni, the founder of classicism)
represents the product of the duration of the lunar cycle (19 years), times the
duration of the solar cycle (28 years) and times the length of the indictum (15 years)
7,980 = 19?28?15 years. This cycle begins 706 years before the Creation, and even
now has not ended. But this artificial technique has allowed the expression of the

traditional chronology's framework by means of a compromise between the interests
of the church and secular authority which were struggling for supremacy as early as
the whole 17th century.
The restoration of real events earlier than the "17th" century and the
extension of a continuous chronology represents deep down an extremely not
simple problem. But a partial reconstruction, nevertheless, seems possible if the
catastrophic year of "1260" is taken as a reference point.
The 12 cycles-generations-indicta, counting backwards from it, give the
"time of the Lord's Passion" "1260" is 12x15 = 1,260 - 180 = "1080." However one
counts the "birth of Christ" from here, it would not fit either at "0," or at the year
"1000," because there still is neither a "first millennium" nor documents with dates
"from the birth of Christ" around this point UNTIL the assumed birth of the
prototype of the Savior near the real year "1050," and the imaginary documents with
the earlier datings "from the birth of Christ" are absent more than 100 years before
this.
Now is the very time to recall "Zhabinskiy's sine curve." Aleksandr M.
Zhabinskiy ("Another History of Art, Moscow, Veche, 2001) has shown
convincingly that graphic art was developed continuously from the "9th" through the
"17th" centuries, with a single glitch - right in the "13th" century, and "ancient" art is
the result of an imaginary chronological reflection of the middle ages in the past.
The "starting" level of this "sine curve" is exactly the traditional "9th" century. The
extent of the fundamental ascending half period of the "sine curve" is from the "9th"
through the "17th" centuries. According to the "Byzantine" sharp curve, the "sine
waves" of the "9th-11th" centuries duplicate exactly the real "13th-15th" centuries
(the remaining offshoots - the "Egyptian," "Roman," Indochinese," "Ancient
Babylonian" - are derived from these two key positions.) In other words, all
"ancient" history of our civilization, which is reflected in graphic art, numbers only
300-400 years to the middle of the traditional "13th" century.
The history of the written language also is confined to this same period:
according to the equation of civilization's pace: hieroglyphic writing is the turn of
the "9th-10th" centuries (according to the interval of a civilized event - the year
"900" 100 years), writing in letters - the end of the "11th" century (according to the
interval of a civilized event - the year "1080" 80 years.) In other words, there simply
were no written sources of OUR civilization earlier than the "9th" century.
In the real history of our man-caused civilization (the Technogenesis epoch)
two stages, in the first approach, can be examined: The "pre-catastrophic"
approximately from the traditional "9th" century through the middle of the
traditional "12th" century, and the "post-catastrophic" - from the second half of the
traditional "12th" century and up to the present time.
Thus, below the "12th" century it simply is not suitable to talk about a
Technogenesis epoch. Any civilization before this could only be "naturally
economic." Essentially, we even see this in the example of the aboriginals of
South America, Africa, Australia, Oceania and the Far North.
One may conceivably connect the turn of the "9th" century with the
"Dardanelles flood," that is the bursting of the Dardanelles strait and the
flooding of the Sea of Marmora and the Black Sea. This correlates with the
conclusions of the work of the hydrobiologist, V.V. Polishchuk, regarding the
changes of the flora and fauna and the deposits of the Black Sea. On the basis



2022. 03. 17. 16:28 Open Ended Time. By Kesler
web.archive.org/web/20200221120031/http://www.revisedhistory.org/oet.htm 19/21
of the analysis of a sharp change of the nature of the
sedimentary deposits, Polishchuk concluded that the level of
the Black Sea before this catastrophic wave was approximately
12 meters lower than now, then the water rose by 80 - 100
meters and stayed thus for approximately 20 years, after
which the level of the water began to do down to the modern
level. In accordance with the traditional chronology, this
event was dated as the 8-7th centuries B.C. (V.V. Polishchuk.
On the Significant Late Holocene Rise of the Level of the
Black Sea and the Origin of Northern Elements in its Fauna.
Hydrobiologic Magazine. Volume XX, No. 4, 1984; V. V.
Polishchuk. On the Boreal Elements of the Fauna of the Black
Sea Basin. Hydrobiologic Magazine. Volume 14, No. 4, 1978).
Some archaeological data also support this hypothesis (M.I.
Artamonov. The Role of Climatic Changes of the 8th-7th
Centuries B.C. in the Transmigration of Cimmerites and Scyths
to Asia and their Return to the Steppe of Eastern Europe in
the 6th Century B.C., in the book: "Ethnography of the
Peoples of the USSR. Leningrad, Science, 1971, pages 45-60).)
Datings in these works are naturally traditional and not
absolute. Taking into consideration "Zhabinskiy's sine curve,"
according to which the "8th" century = the "11th" century,
and the "7th" century = the "10th" century, the Dardanelles
Flood can be ascribed to the "9th" century.
The proposed concept allows a somewhat different interpretation also of the
results of the mathematical and statistical work of Anatoliy T. Fomenko, leading to
the construction by him of the "Global Chronological Chart." Tradition history
according to Fomenko up to the "13th" century is composed of a combination of six
main elements, which are duplicated with shifts of 330 - 360, 1,000 - 1,050 and
1,750 - 1,800 years. One of the main elements of the Global Chronological Map (T)
in principle is distinguished from the rest by the fact that it marks the "splicing" of
the others. In light of the concept being examined, this is not a wave, but a
catastrophe - "1260."
All three chronological shifts discovered by Fomenko are not astrological,
which confirms the conclusion made by A.B. Verevkin about the fact that
"astrological" shifts do not have a real prototype. A shift by (330)-360 years reflects
a real continuance of "pre-catastrophic Technogenesis"): the years "900" - "1260."
A shift by 1,000-(1,050) years is a creation of a "chiliastic" concept, finally adopted
in the "15th" century (the "1439 Union"). A shift by 1,750-1,800 years is the total
of the chiliastic shift and the fundamental ascending half period of
Zhabinskiy's "sine curve" (the "Scaliger-Petavius" scale.)
Arabic numerals and the ability for complex calculations appeared at the
turn of the "12th-13th" centuries. (Fibonacci, "1180-1240".) Those very
calculations of open-ended time began only after the
catastrophe: not earlier than the "14th" century. There could not be any dating
"from the Creation," "from the birth of Christ," or "from the hijra" before this. To go
beyond the limits of the continuance of a real "pre-catastrophic" stage of the
development of our civilization (approximately 360 years) with the comparison of
the various undated chronicles without additional contrivances (the "chilia") was



2022. 03. 17. 16:28 Open Ended Time. By Kesler
web.archive.org/web/20200221120031/http://www.revisedhistory.org/oet.htm 20/21
simply impossible. And this forced the chroniclers of that time to the acceptance of
the chiliastic concept.
Apparently, the "Diocletian Era," fortified by the change of ideology from
pagan to monotheistic, became the first attempt for the creation of an open-ended
design taking into consideration the added "millennium" (in the traditional history,
the Diocletian/Constantine change, the real prototype of this change - is at the turn
of the traditional "11-12th" centuries.) And the letter "i," which stands before the
subsequent figures with the designation of the year fully could designate from the
beginning the abbreviation from "initio" (that is, start), later it is an abbreviation for
Jesus, and from the "16th" century - simply "1," that is, the chiliastic "thousand
years."
The "third chilia is the era of the Holy Ghost," that is 12 generations from the
catastrophe of "1260," terminated exactly at "1440." And the transition of Western
Europe to dating from the birth of Christ with the inclusion of a millennium
occurred in "1400-1440," in which connection it was caused exclusively for
political reasons. This marked a new stage in the creation of a traditional
chronology, which received the strongest means of asserting the ideology: its
circulation in the form of printed works. The introduction of the Moslem "hijra era"
occurred even later, most likely during the time of Suleiman (I, "Kanuni.")
This stage ended approximately in "1520," with the formation of the new western
"catholic" empire of Charles V and with the coming to power of Suleiman (I), who
united, per se, the whole eastern part of the former empire. After this, an intensive
process of the formation of national states and the writing of their own history
begins. This also required the creation of an open-ended universal chronological
scale, which was put together by the middle of the "17th" century.
Further, the historiography has redacted all sources in accordance with the already
established chronological framework. Naturally, at the same time, the
historiographers both were besmirching that which did not conform, and
they fabricated that which was lacking, and they repeatedly re-wrote
anew that which was fabricated by the predecessors. At the same time, real
events both of the "pre-catastrophic" and of the "post-catastrophic" stages either
were expunged or were dispatched to the distant past. The main thing that the
traditional historiography did by the "18th" century in the creation of a universal
open-ended chronological scale:
1) it tried to erase the catastrophe of "1260" fully from the
memory of mankind, isolating it as the "Great Plague," seeing
that epidemics broke out repeatedly;
2) it concealed the lack of any kind of chronological
information about our civilization until the traditional "9th"
century. At the same time, the Great Flood was ascribed to very
remote times and became completely legendary.
The fear of God was placed above the fear of natural phenomena. And the open
ended chronology assured both the legitimization of the powers that be as "anointed
by God" and the "historical antiquity" of this very authority.
The very real consequence of the religious events of the Technogenesis epoch can
look approximately thus:
1) the "pagan times" the turn of the "9th-10th centuries- the
middle of the "12th century. It includes the conventional "pagan
period of the Ecumenical Empire" - that is, the assimilation of
the Ecumene and the establishment of relations between groups



2022. 03. 17. 16:28 Open Ended Time. By Kesler

of people, who were assimilated both the same way as the
adjacent territories, and the origin of the idea of "God" as the
supreme judge - approximately from the middle of the "11th"
century;
2) "monotheism": after the catastrophe of "1260." This is the
appearance of the "Mosesites," the "Apostolic Brethren," the
"Melchites-true-believers-Orthodox" - that is, of the early
Christian sects, the origin of the Moslems is the start of the
"14th" century, the Roman Catholic Church is the end of the
"14th" century, the struggle for the predominant religion in the
Empire is conditionally to "1453," the religious demarcation and
split of the Empire and the formation of "nationally religious"
states is the end of the "15th" - start of the "17th" century.
At the same time, "Protestantism" is a movement against the appropriation by the
clericals of the supreme authority. From this point of view, the seizure by Mehmet
(II) of Tsargrad is a victory namely of "Protestantism," the
Moslems at that time were an ordinary sect. Religious tolerance in
the eastern part of the Empire was maintained fully until the middle of the "18th"
century, despite the introduction of Shariat in "1630," but in Siberia and the Far East
it is maintained to this time. It is typical that the notion of "Jew" in the New World
appeared for the first time only after the purges of the Inquisition with the second
wave of emigration at the end of the "16th" - start of the "17th" centuries (inasmuch
as "non-Christians" did not have the right to emigrate to America as free people),
and, for example, beyond the Volga - only in "1634" with the first settlers from
Poland and Lithuania, that is, after the formation of the "Philaret Russian Orthodox
Church" in "1627."
The catastrophe of "1260" initiated the rapid
scientific and technical progress of our civilization. The
maximum to which this catastrophe, having disrupted the
continuous chain of civilized events, could extend in general
our history is nearly 250 years in addition to the interval
of approximately 7,500 years, which was cited in the previous
article ("Civilizing Events"). This, by the way, coincides
with the glacial data about an even earlier powerful global
"acidic" catastrophe nearly 7,800 years ago.
And it is no accident that the civilized development of
America, which was separated from contact with the Old World
approximately for 200-250 years and "once more was opened up"
to Europeans in the "15th-16th" centuries, remained, per se,
agrarian. And it is no accident that Western European
medieval giants of thought - the fathers of civilization of
the type of Albert the Great, Bonaventure, Roger Bacon and
Thomas Aquinas appear immediately after the catastrophe in
the traditional history. A "New Time" in the history of
civilization is coming according to the classical concepts of
H. Weiss.
At the same time, a chronology (1) also is starting, according to which up
to now mankind has been living.
