Indus Script hieroglyph خول ḵẖol 'hooded cloak, cap' rebus kol 'ironsmith' signifies a Gandharva
Thanks to Shri Vipin Kumar ji for the insights of a Gandharva bronze statue, wearing a cap of wild animals' skin. It is a hooded cloak, cap with a number of other hieroglyphs of Indus Script, consistent with Gandharva traditions from Rgveda times.

I submit that the following sculpture in bronze of a Gandharva has a set of hieroglyphs of Meluhha Indus Script rebus readings which signify him as a smelter of iron and copper in a metals manufactory.

The guardian king belongs to one of the eight catagories of Buddhist beings: that of the heavenly musicians (gandharva). One can identify this statue as such because of its wild beast headdress. Technically perfect, this bronze Korean statue is unique today. The inscription on the base dates it to the "Rooster Year," without specifying the reference era. Comparing it to paintings featuring the same style and theme found in the Turfan Oasis of China's Xinjiang

A variant orthography of the cap of Gandharva comes from the same location in Korea:
• Title: Facade Stones with Eight Divine Beings of Stone Stupa (Gandharva) • Creator: unknown • Date Created: Unified Silla, 8th century • Location: Tapjeong-dong, Gyeongju, Gyeongsangbuk-do Province, Korea • Type: Buddhist sculpture • Rights: Gyeongju National Museum • Medium: H 95.0cm
• Facade Stones with Eight Divine Beings of Stone Stupa (Gandharva)
unknownUnified Silla, 8th century
• The Eight Divine Beings, originally native gods in India, were appropriated as the eight guardians of Buddhist sutras when Buddhism was founded. In Korea, they frequently appeared as engravings on stone stupas, monuments, and lamps from the 8th century onwards. Asura (right) and Gandharva (above), engraved onto the upper-level base stone of a stone stupa, were discovered at the Damamsa Temple site. Gandharva is sheathed in armor, wearing a lion crown, and also sits on a cloud. Both images, carved in great detail with the utmost dexterity and elaborate technique, are estimated to be from the Unified Silla Period in the 8th century. • https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/facade-stones-with-eight-divine-beings-of-stonestupa-gandharva-unknown/IgELgOFP_PkqcA

It is shown that the skin of the wild beast which makes the cap of the Gandharva is that of a feline. panja 'feline paw' rebus: panja 'kiln, furnace'; the feline paw projects forward on to the chest of the Gandharva. The Indus Script hieroglyph kola 'tiger' rebus: kol 'working in iron' kolhe 'smelter' is consistent with the other hieroglyph rebus readings in Meluhha. Gandharva is an iron smelter,metalworker.
One date in the Itihāsa of Bhāratam Janam (RV 3.53.12) is emphatic: it is 18 February 3102 BCE, the start date of Kaliyuga, the Kali era. All the events of the Great Epic Mahābhāratam occur on the yuga-sandhi, the fusion and transition into Kaliyuga (the present
epoch). The traditions of the Great Epic related to Gandharva, people of Gāndhāra, date back to over 10 rca-s in Rgveda.

Miraj style tanbura: The Mirajkar family of Miraj is regarded as the finest producers of tanpuras in the world. The family has been making tanpuras for over seven generations.[5] the favourite form of tanpura for Hindustani performers. It is usually between three and five feet in length, with a carved, rounded resonator plate (tabli) and a long, hollow straight neck, in section resembling a rounded capital D. The round lower chamber to which the tabli, the connecting



7
heel-piece and the neck (dandh) are fixed is cut from a selected and dried gourd (tumba). Wood used is either tun or teak; bridges are usually cut from one piece of bone.

I submit that the word tambura is derived from the tradition of Mirajkars who use tumba 'gourd' shell to make the soundbox of the instrument. This tradition continuesin Kandahar, Gandhara a word which signifies both people of Kandahar and a gourd-based musical instrument from Ancient India, tambura; the old Meluhha form of pronunciation could be tumbra which is signified by the Indus Script hieroglyph 'felly of wheel to hold the spokes-- tumba'.

The Indus Script hieroglyph corpora include a spoked wheel Sign 391 and string musical instrument Sign 311. Sign 391 has been deciphered as څرخ ṯs

Gandharva is a name used for distinct heavenly beings in Hindu, Bauddham and Jaina traditions. It is also a term for skilled singers in Indian classical music.
In Hindu traditions, the Gandharvas (Sanskrit and Hindi: गन्धवव ; Assamese: গন্ধৰ্ব্ ব , gandharbba;
Bengali: গন্ধর্ ব , "gandharba", Kannada: ಗಂಧರ್ವ ; Odia: ଗନ୍ଧ ବମ "gandharva" ; Telugu:
గంధర్వ ; Tamil: கந்தர்வன் , "kantharvan"; Malayalam: ഗന്ധർവ്വൻ , "gandharvan") are male nature spirits and husbands of the Apsaras. Some are part animal, usually a bird or horse. They have superb musical skills. They guard the Soma and play beautiful music for the gods in their palaces. Gandharvas are frequently depicted as singers in the court of the gods.

Gandharva (tiếng Hindi: गन्धवव , Hán-Việt: 乾闼婆 / Càn Thát Bà / Càn-thát-bà, tiếng Hàn:
간다르바, tiếng Nhật: ガンダルヴァ, tiếng Thái: คนธรรพ,์ tiếng Indonesia: Gandarwa)
Gandharva and related traditions are related to Sarasvati-Sindhu Civilization traditions and many narratives in Rgveda. In all the traditions, one common denominator is that Gandharva are people of what is now called the region Kandahar, Afghanistan.
In the Epic Itihāsa Mahabharata, the mother of 100 Kauravas is गाांधारी, lit. A girl
from गाांधार. She was a princess of Gandhara and the wife of Dhritrashtra, the blind king of Hastinapura. Her narratives are central to the history of Ancient India. Popular narration is that the act of blindfolding herself was a sign of dedication and love. On the contrary, Irawati Karve and many modern scholars debated that the act of blindfolding was an act of protest against Bhishma, as he intimidated her father into giving away her hand in marriage to the blind prince of Hastinapur. The Mahabharata attributes high moral standards to Gandhari, although her sons are portrayed as villains. She repeatedly exhorted her sons to follow dharma and make peace with the Pandavas. Gandhari fostered a big-little sister relationship with Kunti. Famously, when Duryodhana would ask for her blessing of victory during the Kurukshetra war, Gandhari would only say "may victory find the side of righteousness". Gandhari's major flaw was her love for her sons, especially her first born, Duryodhana, which often blinded her to his flaws. Most retellings of the story praise Gandhari for her act of blindfolding herself, whereas some criticize her for taking this extreme step without considering the result it would have on the future...All of Gandhari's sons were killed in the war against their cousins, the Pandavas, at Kurukshetra, specifically at the hands of Bhima. Upon hearing the news, it is said that through a small gap in the blindfold, her gaze fell on Yudhishthira's toe. His clean toe was charred black due to her wrath and power. When she heard the news of the death of all the sons of Pandavas (Upapandavas), she embraced the Pandavas and consoled them for their losses. Later her wrath turned to Krishna for allowing all this destruction to happen.In one stunning episode, a defining episode which crystallises the essence of dharma in Indian Itihāsa 'so-ithappened' tradition, Gandhari curses Krishna with the destruction Yadavas in a manner similar to the death of her sons. [Stri ParvaThe Mahabharata, Translated by Kisari Mohan Ganguli,



16
Published by P.C. Roy (1889)] She cursed that he, his city and all his subjects would be destroyed. Krishna accept the curse. Her curse took its course 36 years after the great war when Yadu dynasty perished after a fight broke out between Yadavas at a festival. Lord Krishna ascended to his heavenly abode after living for 126 years. The golden city of Dwarka drowned exactly seven days after his disappearance. Gandhari along with her husband Dhritarashtra, brother-in-law Vidura and sister-in-law Kunti, left Hastinapur about 15 years after the war to seek penance. She is said to have died in the Himalayas in a forest fire along with Dhritarastra, Vidura and Kunti and attained moksha. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gandhari_(character) Thus, Gandhari symbolises a testimony of womanhood in Indian tradition and results in the end of an epoch and the start of Kaliyuga on the midnight on 18 February 3102 BCE (Surya Siddhānta).

Various parentage is given for the gandharvas. They are called the creatures of Prajapati, of Brahma, of Kasyapa, of the Munis, of Arishta, or of Vāc. (See definitions cited from Monier
Williams) In Bauddham, a Gandharva (Sanskrit; Pali: Gandhabba; Chinese: 乾闼婆
; pinyin: Gān tà pó; Japanese: 乾闥婆
; rōmaji: Kendatsuba; Korean: 간다르바; romaja: Gandareuba; Vietnamese: Càn Thát Bà) is
one of the lowest-ranking Devas in Buddhist cosmology. They are classed among the Cāturmahārājakāyika
Devas, and are subject to the Great King Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Guardian of the East. Beings are reborn among the Gandharvas as a consequence of having practiced the most basic form of ethics (Janavasabha Sutta, DN.18). Gandharvas can fly through the air, and are known for their skill as musicians. They are connected with trees and flowers, and are described as dwelling in the scents of bark, sap, and blossoms.

the गन्धवव s are regarded as a class , yet in RV. rarely more than one is mentioned ; he is
designated as the heavenly गन्धवव (शद्व्य /अ ग्° RV. ix , 86 , 36 and x , 139 , 5), and is also
called शवश्वा -वस ( RV. x , 85 , 21 and 22 ; 139 , 4 and 5) and वाय-के ि (in pl. RV. iii , 38 , 6); his habitation is the sky , or the region of the air and the heavenly waters ( RV. i , 22 , 14 ; viii , 77 , 5 ; ix , 85 , 12 ; 86 , 36 ; x , 10 , 4 AV. ii , 2 , 3) ; his especial duty is to guard the heavenly सोम ( RV. ix , 83 , 4 and 85 , 12) , which the gods obtain through his intervention
( RV. AV. vii , 73 , 3 ; cf. RV. i , 22 , 14) ; it is obtained for the human race by इन्द्र , who
conquers the गन्धवव and takes it by force ( RV. viii , 1 , 11 and 77 , 5) ; the heavenly गन्धवव is
supposed to be a good physician , because the सोम is considered as the best medicine ; possibly ,
however , the word सोम originally denoted not the beverage so called , but the moon , and the
heavenly गन्धवव may have been the genius or tutelary deity of the moon ; in one passage ( RV. ix ,
86 , 36) the heavenly गन्धवव and the सोम are identified ; he is also regarded as one of the genii who regulate the course of the Sun's horses (i , 163 , 2 ; x , 177 , 2 ; cf. 135 , 5) ; he knows and makes known the secrets of heaven and divine truths generally (x , 139 , 5 and 6 AV. ii , 1 , 2 ; xx , 128 , 3 VS. xi , 1 ; xxxii , 9) ; he is the parent of the first pair of human beings , यम and यमी ( RV. x , 10 , 4) , and has a peculiar mystical power over women and a right to possess them ( RV. x , 85 , 21 and 22 ; 40 and 41) ; for this reason he is invoked in marriage ceremonies ( AV. xiv , 2 , 35 and 36) ; ecstatic states of mind and possession by evil spirits are supposed to be derived from the heavenly गन्धवव (cf. -गृहीत , -ग्रह ) ; the गन्धवव s as a class have the
same characteristic features as the one गन्धवव ; they live in the sky ( RV. AV. S3Br. xiv) , guard
the सोम ( RV. ix , 113 , 3 S3Br. iii AitBr. i , 27), are governed by वरुण (just as the अप्सरस s are
governed by सोम) S3Br. xiii A1s3vS3r. x , 7 , 3, know the best medicines ( AV. viii , 7 ,

23 VS. xii , 98), regulate the course of the asterisms ( AV. xiii , 1 , 23 BhP. iv , 29 , 21 ; hence twenty-seven are mentioned VS. ix , 7), follow after women and are desirous of intercourse with them ( AV. S3Br. iii) ; as soon as a girl becomes marriageable , she belongs to सोम , the गन्धवव s ,
and अशग्न ( Gr2ihya1s. ii , 19 f. Pan5cat. Sus3r. ) ; the wives of the गन्धवव s are the अप्सरस s
(cf. गन्धवाव *प्सर् /अस्) , and like them the गन्धवव s are invoked in gambling with dice ( AV. vii , 109
, 5) ; they are also feared as evil beings together with the राक्षस s , शकमीशदन्s , शपिाचs , &c , amulets being worn as a protection against them ( AV. Sus3r. ) ; they are said to have revealed the वेदs to वाच् ( S3Br. iii ; cf. Pa1rGr2. ii , 12 , 2), and are called the preceptors of the ऋशषs
( S3Br. xi) ; परूरवस् is called among them (ib.) ; in epic poetry the गन्धवव s are the celestial musicians or heavenly singers (cf. RV. x , 177 , 2) who form the orchestra at the banquets of the gods , and they belong together with the अप्स रसs to इन्द्र 's heaven , sharing also in his battles
( Ya1jn5. i , 71 MBh. Hariv. &c ; cf. RTL. p.238) ; in the more systematic mythology the गन्धवव s constitute one of the classes into which the higher creation is divided (i.e. gods , manes , गन्धवव s AV. xi , 5 , 2 ; or gods , असरs , गन्ध ववs , men TS. vii , 8 , 25 , 2 ; cf. S3Br. x ; or gods ,

distinguished ( TUp. ii , 8 ; the divine or देव-गन्धवव s are enumerated MBh. i , 2550 ff. and 4810
ff.) ; another passage names 11 classes of गन्धवव s ( TA1r. i , 9 , 3) ; the chief or leader of
the गन्धवव s is named शचत्र -रर्थ ( Bhag. x , 26) ; they are called the creatures of प्रजापशत ( Mn. i , 37)
or of ह्मब्रा ( Hariv. 11793) or of कश्यप (11850) or of the मशनs ( MBh. i , 2550 Hariv. 11553) or

Gandharvas in the historic sense acted as messengers between the gods and humans. In Hindu law, a gandharva marriage is one contracted by mutual consent and without formal rituals.
Gandharvas are mentioned extensively in the epic Mahabharata as associated with the Devas (as dancers and singers) and with the Yakshas, as formidable warriors. They are mentioned as spread across various territories.
