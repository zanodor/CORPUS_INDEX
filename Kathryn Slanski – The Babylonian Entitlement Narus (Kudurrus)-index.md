Acknowledgments
This book is the revised version of a doctoral dissertation submitted in November 1997 to the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations (NELC) at Harvard University. Co-directors were Professors Peter Machinist and Piotr Steinkeller, both of NELC, and the dissertation additionally was overseen by Professor John Huehnergard (NELC) and Professor Irene J. Winter (History of Art and Architecture). These four teachers set the bar high by their own examples of scholarly excellence; they are also unstintingly generous with intellectual and professional advice. In an unofficial capacity, Professor Jo Ann Hackett (NELC) provided immeasurable guidance and support, not to mention the use of a laser printer. Sincere thanks are also due the Hackett-Huehnergard and Hunt-Winter households for seemingly endless reservoirs of hospitality and kitchen-table wisdom. Professor William L. Moran, my original advisor at Harvard, was only peripherally involved in the dissertation due to retirement and illness. Nonetheless, any insights presented here are due in large part to careful and sensitive readings of Akkadian poetry and prose texts, and what skill I possess in this regard lowe principally to his teaching. I deeply regret that this book was not finished in time for him to see it. It is my pleasure to acknowledge the contributions of several institutions and individuals. The Harvard University Graduate Society provided a grant to complete the writing of the original dissertation. The American Schools of Oriental Research Mesopotamian Fellowship enabled me to travel to the British Museum and the Louvre in the spring of 1996, an experience that profoundly shaped my view of the Entitlement narus as monuments with a coordinated program of text and image. Mr. Christopher Walker and the staff in the Department of Western Asiatic Antiquities at the British Museum, and Drs. Annie Caubet and Beatrice Andre-Salvini and their staff at the Departement des Antiquites Orientales of the Musee du Louvre, gave graciously of their knowledge and assistance. The dissertation was completed at Tel Aviv University, where revisions were begun with support of a Vatat

Fellowship, 1997-1998. I gratefully acknowledge the Bibliotheque Nationale de France, the Musee du Louvre, and the Trustees of the British Museum for their respective permission to reproduce illustrations appearing in this book. Finally, I thank Professor Victor Matthews (Southwest Missouri State) for accepting my dissertation for publication in the ASOR Book Series. Professor Matthews and Dr. Billie Jean Collins (Emory) of ASOR Publications have been encouraging, helpful, and flexible throughout the process of transforming a Ph.D thesis into a book. I was able to revise the dissertation extensively after its acceptance by ASOR, and I believe the improvements are worth the delay in publication. Dr. Niek Veldhuis (formerly of Gronigen, now UC Berkeley) read and commented extensively on the dissertation, and it is to his comments that many improvements appearing in this volume can be traced. Professor Itamar Singer (Tel Aviv University) first suggested that I consider publishing with ASOR, and he also mediated the initial contact. I thank him as well for his steady encouragement and his generosity in extending to me use of his computer equipment to prepare the manuscript. Professor Shlomo Izre>el (TAU), his wife, Ruti, and son, Akkad, supported me with great kindness through the final phases of dissertation writing. Professors Ed Greenstein, Nadav Na'aman and the late Pirhiya Beck (TAU), and Dr. Khaled Nashef (Bir Zeit University) read and commented on aspects of the thesis, and I have benefited as well from several conversations with Professor Avigdor Horowitz (Ben Gurion University of the Negev) and Dr. Talley Ornan (Israel Museum) about the monuments formerly known as kudurrus. Fr. Marcel Sigrist provided a peaceful research haven at the Ecole Biblique in Jerusalem. Irene Winter read several versions of the final chapter, and it is in response to her comments that I was able to articulate ideas about the Entitlement narus within a greater historical and cultural context. John Huehnergard invested hours in helping me translate obdurate Middle Babylonian passages into sensible English. Professors Machinist and Steinkeller made valuable editorial comments and suggestions for publication. Professors Winter, Hackett, and Huehnergard also allowed me access to Harvard's Widener Library after I had graduated. Dr. Joseph Greene (Harvard Semitic Museum) and the staff of the Harvard NELC Department aided in the final preparation of the manuscript.

Others who have good-naturedly come to know more about Entitlement narus than they ever imagined include Dr. James Armstrong, Dr. David Brown, Mr. Yoram Cohen, Dr. Steven Cole, Dr. Sylvie Honigman, Prof. Robert Hunt, Mr. Glenn Magid, Dr. Barbara N. Porter, Dr. Eleanor Robson, Prof. David Schloen, Dr. Deborah Sweeney, Prof. Sarolta Takas;s, Dr. IritZiffer, and the faculty, students, and staff of the Department of Archaeology and Near Eastern Cultures at Tel Aviv University. Thanks are due Mr. Jaacov Goddard, for his aid in bringing the references to order, and and Dr. Alice Slotsky (Brown) for her editorial assistance. Professors Benjamin Foster, William Hallo and especially Ms. Ulla Kasten made me welcome at the Yale Babylonian Collection while the last loose ends of the manuscript were tied. Errors, oversights, and omissions that remain despite the efforts of these fine people are entirely my own responsibility.

The Cuneiform Languages of Mesopotamia
SUMERIAN: not known to be a member of any language family. Written Sumerian is agglutinative; syntax is indicated by attaching strings of particles to verbal and nominal roots. Cuneiform writing was developed for Sumerian, which is written left-to-right. Sumerian is thought to have been spoken in Mesopotamia from prehistoric times to the end of the 3rd millennium, and possibly continued as a living language in localized "pockets" well into the 2nd. After Sumerian ceased to be spoken, it continued to be studied in the scribal schools and used for composing literary, commemorative, and liturgical works down to the I st millennium CEo
AKKADIAN: a member of the Semitic language family, i.e., related to Hebrew, Arabic, Ethiopic, among others. Cuneiform was adapted to write Akkadian, but because Sumerian and Akkadian featured different sounds the fit is imperfect. Akkadian, Eblaite, and Ugaritic, all written in cuneiform, are the only Semitic languages written from left-to-right. Akkadian is the only Semitic language to have the verb in sentence final position, one of several significant influences of Sumerian. Although Akkadian personal names, and presumably Akkadian speakers, are evidenced in Mesopotamia from the very earliest written records, Akkadian is not attested as a written language until the Sargonic Dynasty.
Akkadian is divided into the following dialects; dates are approximate and merely rough guidelines. The names below are have been coined by modern scholars and not by the Akkadian speakers themselves.

THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS xix
Standard Babylonian (SB) was reserved for writing literary and poetic compositions from -1500 until the end of cuneiform culture. Many wellknown mythological and poetic works, e.g., Enuma elis and the most complete version of the Epic ofGilgamd, have been preserved in Standard Babylonian. (Chronology after Huehnergard 1995.)



Area Measures in Field Descriptionsl
Field descriptions are a regular feature of the inscriptions investigated in this volume. In these texts, the size of a field is expressed according to the amount of grain required to seed it. Units of measure are written with Sumerian terms, and this study follows the conventions set by Powell 1987-90 in rendering these terms in Sumerian in transliterated and translated texts.
The basic unit of area in measuring agricultural land is the Sumerian BUR. During the era of the artifacts under investigation, the bur is divided into 8 IKU. In this period, the iku is reckoned as a square measuring 120 KUS GAL ('big cubit') by 120 KUS GAL.
In absolute terms, I kus gal is approx .75m. Hence, 1 iku is approx. 90m x 90m, or 8,100 sq m (8.1 ha).
The basic capacity measure for grain is the SILA3 (approx. 1 liter). The standard seeding rate is fixed and understood to be 240 sila to the bur. Hence, to seed 1 iku (one-eighth of a bur) requires 240/8, that is, 30 sila.
In the texts, the number of sila required to seed the field is usually expressed in a larger unit, the BAN. The number of sila to the ban varied in this period, but in measuring land, a 10 sila ban was the standard. Thus, the 30 sila required to seed 1 iku is expressed as 3 ban, written BANES in Sumerian.
Very large amounts of grain are measured in a unit called GUR. 1 gur is 300 sila.
To take an example:2
50 SE.NUMUN 1 IKU BANES 1 KUS GAL-tu4
A 50 (gur) seed grain (field), (measured at the rate of) 3 ban to the iku, (with the iku reckoned according to) the 'big cubit'.
Calculate: 50 gur =15,000 sila. 15,000 sila would seed 500 iku.
And, in absolute terms, 500 iku is approx. 4,050,000 sq m, or 4,050 ha.

Chapter One
Introduction
DISCOVERY, DECIPHERMENT, AND DESIGNATION
In the final quarter of the 18th century, in the ruins of a palace a day's ride south of Baghdad, a well-known French botanist and explorer, Anton Michaux, happened upon a polished black stone covered with incomprehensible carvings (fig. I). M. Michaux brought the stone back to Paris and sold it in 180 I to the Bibliotheque Nationale de France where the object, which became known as the Caillou Michaux, can still be viewed today. Drawings of its inscription and relief carvings were published just a year later (figs. 2-3).1 Though little about it was understood, the celebrated boulder received considerable public and scholarly notice-most likely due to the appeal of its sculpted reliefs and overall visual impact.2 At that time, the ruins of ancient Mesopotamia, a long dead civilization known primarily through the Bible, had been attracting increasing attention from the west. European travelers of the preceding century had identified and even surveyed the ruins of Nineveh and Persepolis. By 1700, the mysterious wedge-shaped writing encountered there had already been termed "cuneiform," and although some scholars continued to believe it was purely decorative, others persevered in efforts to interpret it (Kramer 1963: 10-11). The year 1778 saw publication of Carsten Niebuhr's copies of trilingual inscriptions from Persepolis

CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION 3
copies that led to the first steps in the decipherment of cuneiform. In the 1850s, the independent efforts of Edward Hincks, Jules Oppert, and Henry Rawlinson were acknowledged as having truly unlocked the cuneiform writing system and the language it conveyed? After two millennia, Akkadian, the Semitic language of ancient Mesopotamia, in its Assyrian, Babylonian, Old Akkadian and literary dialects, emerged from obscurity to be read and understood once again. Around the same time that cuneiform was deciphered, systematic archaeological exploration in Mesopotamia had begun. The first excavations took place in the north, in the great royal capitals of ancient Assyria known from the Bible: Kalbu (Biblical Calah) and Nineveh. These early digs yielded architecture and artifacts, fueling the growing field of research in Mesopotamian civilization and giving rise to the term 'Assyriology' for the new discipline. Excavation in southern Mesopotamia followed shortly thereafter, where the long hidden remains of Babylonia as well as the forgotten remnants of Sumerian civilization were revealed. It was in the northern part of Babylonia, by means of archaeological undertakings and the antiquities market, that additional boulders bearing physical and visual similarities to the Caillou Michaux were encountered by British and American researchers in the 19th century. Unable to read the inscriptions or identify elements of the sculptured imagery, observers recognized nonetheless that these other artifacts were part of the same artifactual genre. The resemblance had been noted as early as an 1858 commentary on the Caillou Michaux (Chabouillet 1858: 109-10): "Le fragment d'un autre monument du meme genre conserve au Musee Britannique, prouve au moins qu'on a profite plusieurs fois de semblables accidents." Late 19th century French expeditions to the Iranian plateau at the ruins of Susa, capital city of ancient Elamite civilization, uncovered a great number of similarly fashioned stones and stone fragments. Immediately apparent to researchers was the circumstance that these artifacts-along with larger and more spectacular monuments, such as the Law Stele of ljammurapi (Code of ljammurapi) and the Victory Stele of Naram-Sfn-had been removed from Babylonia to Susa already in antiquity. Along with the other objects unearthed by the

French excavations, the Caillou Michaux-like stones recovered in Susa made their way to the Louvre in Paris. Those acquired by the British teams, meanwhile, were transported to London's British Museum. In the interim, a translation of the inscription of the Caillou Michaux, "the first really valuable (cuneiform) inscription to come to Europe" (Kramer 1963: 7), had been published in 1803. The translation, in Latin verse, was less than satisfactory (Hinke 1907: 1 and n. 2):
Its inscription was at once studied and translated by the German professor, A. A. H. Lichtenstein, of HelmsHidt. His attempt was, however, a failure, for he made out the inscription to be Aramaic, read it from right to left, and declared it to be a dirge addressed by a certain Archimagus to wailing women at an annual mourning festival.
Significant advances in the decipherment of Akkadian had been made over the course of the 19th century, and the similar boulders newly recovered from Babylonia and Susa at the turn of the 20th were studied forthwith. Photographs of the artifacts, as well as transliterations and translations of their inscriptions, were made known in Europe and the United States. Jacques de Morgan and Vincent Scheil published the objects recovered at Susa in the series Memoires de la delegation en Perse (MDP) volumes I, II, III, IV, VI, VII, X, in the years spanning 1900 to 1908. Subsequent volumes XIV (1913) and XXIX (1943) also contained fragments of the same type of artifact. Leonard W. King offered treatment of another 37, with photographs, editions and commentary, in Babylonian Boundary Stones and Memorial Tablets in the British Museum (BBSt) in 1912. In addition to these two major collections, several more of the stones were discovered and published, including five recovered by German researchers and brought to Berlin. Treatments of these appeared in the first volume of Vorderasiatische Schriftdenkmiiler (VAS) in 1907. That same year saw the published edition of another of the objects discovered by an American team in the ruins of Nippur in A New Boundary Stone of Nebuchadrezzar I from Nippur (1907) by William J. Hinke. Hinke's book in addition includes treatment



CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION 7
of a like artifact housed in Istanbul, and represents the first attempt to present a study of the corpus as a whole. Thus, most of the corpus of these inscribed and sculpted stones, including the Caillou Michaux, was made widely available for study just after the tum of the 20th century. In these publications, produced early on in the history of Assyriology, the artifacts were labeled with the Akkadian term kudurru, traditionally rendered in English as 'boundary stone' or in German as 'Grenzstein'. The term "Babylonian kudurru" is used to distinguish these artifacts from the so-called "ancient kudurrus," a corpus of older, third millennium stone artifacts from Mesopotamia
that deal with land tenure.4 Typically, the inscriptions on the majority of the artifacts commemorate land grants made by Babylonian kings to individuals. In consequence, the texts frequently open with a description of the land granted, including its area measure and the characteristics of its four borders. These land descriptions, striking in their uniformity and prominence at the very beginning of many of the inscriptions, may have been what led early Assyriologists to interpret the artifacts as boundary markers. In any event, the designation kudurru 'boundary stone' was affixed to the artifacts from the time of their publication in the early 1900s. Although this study challenges the aptness of the designation kudurru 'boundary stone' for these artifacts, the term kudurru is employed for the remainder of this Introduction.
OVERVIEW OF THE CORPUS
Some 160 so-called Babylonian kudurrus and kudurru fragments are known today. An approximation rather than an exact number is given here because of scholarly disagreement concerning precisely which objects should be considered belonging to the corpus. This lack of consensus stems largely from want of a formal definition for the artifacts; both these topics will be addressed later in this study. Today, the kudurrus are housed in collections as far-flung as Baghdad, Jerusalem, Istanbul, Berlin, Heidelberg, Cannes, Paris,



8 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
London, Oxford, Boston, New Haven, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Los Angeles, and Seattle. Almost half the known kudurrus were excavated in the ancient city of Susa, where they had been brought in antiquity-spoils of successful Elamite raids into Babylonia, the name given to southern land of Mesopotamia from the 2nd millennium BeE onward. Twenty were unearthed from documented architectural contexts in northern as well as southern Babylonian cities, and these discoveries are summarized in Appendix 1. The remainder of the collection is archaeologically unprovenienced. The kudurrus are characterized by their physical form, the subject of their inscriptions, and the imagery of their reliefs. The most familiar shape is an irregular, upright, free-standing stele, such as the Caillou Michaux; others occur in the shape of tablets or plaques. In height they range from 36 cm to almost one meter. Their inscriptions record donations of land, gifts of temple prebends, renewals of land tenure, purchases of land and other property, and exemptions from obligatory donations of goods and labor. Some inscriptions set down a combination of these subjects. Along with a cuneiform inscription, almost every example bears divine symbols carved in relief. A few are also sculpted with scenes, and these have been variously interpreted as reflecting either religious activity or the conferring of land privileges (Seidl 1980-83: 276). The earliest Babylonian kudurrus are dated to the 14th century BeE, thus during the reign of the Kassite Dynasty, which ruled Babylonia from the 15th to the 10th century (all subsequent dates are BeE). They continue to appear throughout the hegemony of succeeding Babylonian Dynasties, with the latest known example dating to the reign of Samas-suma-ukln, the Neo-Assyrian king who ruled Babylonia 667-648. (Regnal dates in this study follow the chronology of Brinkman 1977a.) Thus, kudurrus were produced in Babylonia under successive native and foreign rulers for a period of a least seven centuries.



CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION 9
KUDURRUS AND KASSITE BABYLONIA
In 1595, the remnants of the Old Babylonian (ijammurapi) Kingdom fell to the Hittites, who, after sacking the capital city of Babylon, withdrew from Mesopotamia and returned to Anatolia. The power vacuum left in their wake was eventually filled by a non-Mesopotamian people living in Babylonia known as the Kassites (Brinkman 1976-80, Sommerfeld 1995). The ensuing Kassite Dynasty ruled until the middle of the 12th century, and is distinguished in Babylonian history as an unusually long period of dynastic stability. Because the kudurrus first appeared in Babylonia during the rule of the Kassite Dynasty, much kudurru scholarship has tacitly assumed that the distinctive-looking artifacts, as well as the privileges they commemorate, were foreign innovations brought into Babylonia by the Kassite people (e.g., Hinke 1907: 7). Babylonia under the Kassite kings is one of the least known periods of Mesopotamian history. Persons with Kassite names are first recorded in Babylonia during the 18th century, chiefly around the northern city of Sippar, and by the end of the Old Babylonian Dynasty, Kassites can be found in the middle Euphrates area (Brinkman 1976-80: 465). Their origins are obscure: scholars have suggested the Zagros mountain region as a likely locus for the Kassite homeland, but their geographic roots and their method of entry into Babylonia remains unknown (Roaf 1990: 140). Religious evidence was once thought to point to possible Indo-European influence, but such connections, if they existed, must be pushed back to a time long before their appearance in Mesopotamia (Brinkman 1976-80: 472). Kemal Balkan's 1954 study, Kassiten Studien 1: Die Sprache der Kassiten, remains the most comprehensive study of the Kassite language, and the very little evidence we have does not indicate the existance of a written Kassite language or membership in any recognized language family (Balkan 1954). It is not known how-or even precisely when-the Kassite dynasty came to occupy the Babylonian throne sometime during the 15th century. Although approximately 12,000 texts dating from this period have been recovered, more than 90 percent of these are unpub

lished (Brinkman 1974: 395). Moreover, of these published texts, more than 95 percent document the economic life of a single city, Nippur (Brinkman 1974: 395 and n. 2. These figures are based on detailed estimates made by Brinkman of the Nippur tablets in Philadelphia and Istanbul, but exclude tablets excavated in Babylon, which remain inaccessible.) The scarcity of extant documentation useful for research, in contrast to the abundance of such records from the preceding Old Babylonian and succeeding Neo-Babylonian periods, combined with the lack of systematic study devoted to Babylonia under this dynasty (Brinkman 1976-80: 466), gives the impression that the Kassite period was somewhat of a "dark age" in southern Mesopotamia. Although this inscrutability is a product of our unsatisfactory access to written sources rather than a cessation of record keeping, at this point the kudurrus provide a valuable source for the social, political, economic, literary and artistic history for an era that can be been termed Kassite and post-Kassite Babylonia, from the 14th to mid-7th centuries. (For the sources available for study of Kassite history, see Brinkman 1976b, and for an unsurpassed study of Post-Kassite Babylonia, see Brinkman 1968b.)
PREVIOUS SCHOLARSHIP
In a classic and seminal work of modern Assyriology, A. Leo Oppenheim (1977: 366 and n. 29) lamented the lack of study devoted to analysis and interpretation of the kudurrus:
No adequate and systematic up to date study of these interesting documents, their importance for the history of law and institutions in Mesopotamia, or investigation of their contribution to religion, art, and language is available. F. X. Steinmetzer's book, Die babylonischen Kudurru aIs Urkundenform (Paderborn, 1922), will have to fill the gap for quite some time.
Only five important works are devoted to analysis of the genre. The earliest, William J. Hinke, A New Boundary Stone of Nebuchadrezzar I from Nippur in 1907, was followed by Franz X. Steinmetzer, Die babylonischen Kudurru (Grenzsteine) als Urkundenform in 1922. The visual images carved in relief on the



CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION 11
kudurrus were studied more recently by Ursula Seidl in Die babylonischen Kudurru-Reliefs: Symbole Mesopotamischer Gottheiten (1989). The Reallexikon der Assyriologie und vorderasiatischen Archaologie (RLA), volume 6 (1980-83), offers two articles under the heading kudurru: an essay by John A. Brinkman based on the inscriptions, and another on their visual imagery by Seidl. Rinke's book, primarily the publication and textual edition of a kudurru excavated at Nippur and subsequently known as the Hinke kudurru, is based on his University of Pennsylvania doctoral dissertation. Rinke's study also included a brief descriptive catalogue of kudurrus known to that time, a survey of the gods appearing in the inscriptions and the curses with which they were associated, an edition of the text of a kudurru housed in Istanbul (first published in copy as BE II2 149), discussion of the divine symbols found in the kudurru reliefs, and some conclusions about legal aspects of the inscriptions. The aim of Steinmetzer's study, more ambitious than Rinke's, was to consider all the kudurrus and put forth conclusions about their role as legal documents. To that end, he considered various aspects of the artifacts, including physical form, inscriptions, visual imagery, development over time, ancient setting, and how the kudurrus were regarded in their own times. Steinmetzer's book, as noted by Oppenheim, above, remains the most comprehensive work on the kudurrus currently available. Brinkman's RLA article, "kudurru-Philologisch," provides a number of significant insights on the kudurru corpus, although the scope of its analysis is necessarily limited by its format as an encyclopedia article. In addition to the RLA entry, Brinkman has written extensively about individual kudurru inscriptions in A Political History of Post-Kassite Babylonia and in a number of articles (see References, below). Between Political History (Brinkman 1968b) and a second major study, Materials and Studies for a Kassite History (Brinkman 1976b), Brinkman has catalogued all known primary sources, including kudurrus, from the Kassite and Post-Kassite periods in Babylonia.
Seidl's book, Die babylonischen Kudurru-Reliefs: Symbole Mesopotamischer Gottheiten, is an investigation of the relief im

agery of all the kudurrus known up to 1968. Her study features a descriptive catalogue of the kudurrus, discussion of representational elements and their evolution, as well as photographs and drawings of significant and unpublished reliefs. Seidl's research, originally her doctoral dissertation, was first published as Baghdader Mitteilungen 4 in 1968. The revised edition, appearing in the series Orbis Biblicus et Orientalis, contains no changes to the main text, but includes a valuable addendum of new kudurrus and kudurru bibliography published between 1968 and 1989. Catalogue entries include a brief discussion of individual sculpted reliefs, the name of the reigning Babylonian king if identified in the inscription, and bibliographies for publications on each kudurru. Seidl's book provides a thoroughgoing inventory of the elements found in the reliefs and their history in Mesopotamian iconographic tradition. Her work is an invaluable tool for kudurru research; following Steinmetzer's Grenzsteine by sixty-two years, Seidl's Relief'.; contains the most up-to-date references for publications of the entire corpus, and, for a number of artifacts, is the only source for illustrations. Previous studies of the kudurrus have been limited either by their scope or by their one-dimensional approach to the artifacts, e.g., as legal documents, such as considered by the work of Steinmetzer, or as an iconographic medium, such as treated by Seidl. But these distinctions are the result of our modern scholarly analytic apparatus; to the ancient Babylonians, the artifacts must have represented more than simply the sum of their various parts.
PROBLEMS AND AIMS
The problems raised by the kudurrus are as numerous, interdependent, and compelling as they were when the Caillou Michaux first came to modern light. While it has long been recognized that the artifacts share a number of similarities, no attempt has been made to assess formally their physical, textual, and visual features and the relationships existing among these features. Studying the kudurrus without a formal definition is comparable to building a house without a plan: it is impossible to evaluate debatable or



CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION 13
newly discovered objects for inclusion in the corpus, to assess developments within the collection, and to consider inter-relationships among elements of the artifacts, such as the relationship between imagery and text. Moreover, without a formal definition, it is difficult to relate the kudurrus to their greater historical and cultural contexts. This study takes into account the diverse yet integrated textual, visual, and artifactual features of the kudurrus with the aim of generating a holistic interpretation of their indigenous function within their original ancient setting. The primary goal of the present study is to improve our understanding of the kudurrus in the context of the Babylonian culture that produced them and that served as their audience. To that end, this investigation addresses a set of inter-related questions about the form and function of the kudurrus as a genre. Because Seidl has made available a recent study of the imagery of the kudurrus, the present work concentrates principally upon the kudurru inscriptions as well as the inter-relationships among text, imagery, and artifact. Of the some 160 kudurrus and kudurru fragments known to us, 112 bear a readable inscription. More than half of these inscriptions (59) are available only in editions that are now more than 80 years old. Another 29 remain either unpublished or only partially edited, accounting for a total of 88, or 78 percent, of the inscriptional corpus that requires a first or renewed study. The present investigation is based on new text editions, incorporating recent collations of the inscriptions housed in London, Paris, and the United States, as well as first-hand observations of the artifacts and their relief sculptures. (These new editions are to be published in a separate volume currently in preparation by the author. ) Chapter Two, Designation and Setting, evaluates textual and archaeological evidence for ancient Babylonian designation and placement of the objects. Their modern label of 'boundary stones' has led to the widespread assumption that the kudurrus stood upon actual field boundaries. Yet there is no firm consensus as to whether the artifacts were set upon a piece of land to mark a boundary or whether they instead stood in temples. (See, for example, the recent publications of Brinkman 1976-80, Seidl 1989:



14 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
72-73, and most recently Buccellati 1994.) The present inquiry addresses the question of placement of the kudurrus using evidence from the inscriptions of the artifacts themselves as well as archaeological evidence not available to earlier researchers. After addressing the terminological difficulties posed by pertinent textual passages, the discussion proceeds to examination of the written evidence for the objects' ancient setting. The question of setting is, of course, integral to assessing the function of the artifacts, their intended purpose, and how they were received by their audience.
Chapter Three, The Inscriptions: Subject and Structure, furthers the discussion of function through in-depth investigation of the inscriptions. A typology is derived based upon the subject of the inscriptions. First, events effected by the king are separated from events brought about by non-royal persons. The subjects of the inscriptions are then further distinguished according to whether the texts record a grant of land, a grant of temple sinecure, a grant of exemptions from tax and labor obligations, an adjudication of a legal dispute, or a land purchase. Each type of inscriptions is then analyzed for structure. By evaluating the subject of the kudurru inscriptions systematically, the present study aims to determine how the artifacts did function within the culture of ancient Babylonia. In Chapter Four, Form and Function, subsequent discoveries about the inscriptions, together with consideration of their relationship to the relief sculptures, generate additional conclusions about the artifacts' ancient function. These chapters lead to presentation of a formal and functional definition for the artifacts in Chapter Five, Formal Definition. Chapter Six, Debatable Members of the Corpus, examines three artifacts whose inclusion in the genre has been debated as well as a fourth artifact whose status vis-a-vis the corpus has not yet been considered.
Chapter Seven, The Place of the Babylonian Entitlement narus in Mesopotamian Culture, is a re-appraisal of the artifacts in light of the foregoing discussions. Having rejected the designation 'boundary stone', in this chapter I propose that the artifacts typologically were 'monuments' according to Babylonian



CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION 15
cultural criteria, and examine them in light of the monumental tradition of southern Mesopotamia. This chapter also proposes sources available to the composers of the kudurrus in antiquity, and suggests furthermore that placing the kudurrus within the Mesopotamian monumental tradition reveals the motivations and goals of their innovators as well as the impact of the artifacts upon their native Babylonian audience. This chapter closes with an attempt to correlate the 14th century innovation of the genre with developments in the socio-political history of late-second and early-first millennium Babylonia and the ancient Near East. Previous scholarship has left behind a legacy of different schemes for identifying individual kudurrus. The present study designates a member of the corpus according to the king to whose reign it is attributed plus, in abbreviated form, the artifact's primary publication. Thus, Kurigalzu BBSt 2 refers to a kudurru dated to king Kurigalzu published in L.W. King, Babylonian Boundary Stones and Memorial Tablets in the British Museum (1912), object number 2. For publications that do not assign numbers to iundividual objects, page numbers are used; for example, Meli-Sipak MDP X 87 refers to a kudurru dated to king Meli-Sipak, published in Memoires de la delegation en Perse, volume X, beginning at page 87. A few artifacts have acquired some sort of nickname in Assyriological parlance, such as the Cail/ou Michaux or the Hinke "kudurru," and these names are also used in this study. Appendix 1 provides cross-references among the designations employed in this investigation and those assigned in previous inquiries. A number of questions evoked by consideration of the kudurrus lie beyond the scope of the present study. This investigation will not attempt to determine if the origin of the form of the kudurru, textual and/or iconographic, can be traced to the Kassites; in the absence of all but sketchy information about the Kassites, addressing such a question must remain in the realm of speculation. Against a hypothetical Kassite origin for the kudurru, however, this study does conclude that the various features of the artifacts can be firmly traced to native Babylonian traditions. Identification of yet unidentified relief symbols lies outside the goals of this inquiry and is left to others researchers. Other topics,



16 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
such as use of the corpus for reconstructing the ancient geography of Babylonia, or for examination of the political hierarchy, especially the provincial administration of Babylonia in the late second and early first millennia, have been handled ably elsewhere and will not be repeated here. (For geography, see Nashef 1982; for political hierarchy and provincial administration, see several of the works of Brinkman, particularly Brinkman 1963: 233-42, especially 237-8 and p. 237, n. 2; and Brinkman 1968: 296-311.) Finally, there are questions raised by this investigation that are as yet too complex to be fully answered. These include identification of the factors stimulating and/or enabling the innovation of this new artifact type in the mid-second millennium, and the reasons for its discontinuation after seven centuries of use. These questions are raised and preliminary answers are proposed in Chapter Seven. When the Caillou Michaux made its European debut in 1801, it appeared in an information vacuum, one in which very little was known and understood about the dead civilization whose recovery it heralded. Today, Assyriology stands in an incomparably better position to assess the textual, visual, and artifactual features of the kudurrus, and thereby to relate the objects to the culture that engendered them and served as their audience for some seven hundred years. The Babylonian kudurrus are an unparalleled source of information for political, social and cultural history of a long period in human civilization, centuries of which are not well understood. This investigation aims to categorize and evaluate these artifacts with the advantage of more than two century's worth of Assyriological progress, intending to answer some fundamental questions and lay the groundwork for future study.
IThe Caillou Michaux was first published in a collection of seven essays, Monuments antiques, inedits ou nouvellement expliques I (Millin 1802: pIs. VIII-IX). At the time of the publication, Millin held the post of Conservateur des antiquites, medailles et pierres gravees at the Bibliotheque Nationale. According to the frontispiece of the book, Millin was an accomplished scholar in a number of fields including history, antiquities, natural history, and medicine-although not Assyriology: see pages 66-68 for his observations about the inscription compared to other known "Persepolitan" inscriptions. In fact, the decipherment of cuneiform was at such an early



CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION 17
stage, the most authoritative work to which Millin could refer the interested reader was an 1801 doctoral dissertation. Nonetheless, Millin's copy of the inscription is quite good, and occasionally reflects the signs more accurately than the copy later published by Rawlinson (IR 70). Other early publications include Georges Contenau, Manuel d/Archeologie Orientale 11 (1931), 898, fig. 621; Quatrieme Centenaire du College de France, PI. LXI (photos of one side); and Felix E. Peiser, Texte luristischen und Geschaftlichen lnhalts, KB 4, (Berlin: Ruethner, 1896),78-85 (transcription and translation). 2Chabouillet 1858: 109-110: "Ce monument dont les immenses accroissements de l'archeologie asiatique ont plutot accru que diminue l'importance, a ete rapporte des bords du Tigre par M. Michaux, botaniste et voyageur celebre, et c'est pourquoi on Ie connalt generalement sous Ie nom de caillou Michaux. A l'endroit auquel il a ete trouve sont les ruines d'un palais que l'on nomme les lardins de Semiramis, et qui, selon Silvestre de Sacy, est Ie Tak Kesra, ou Voute de Chosroes. II est entre en 1801 au cabinet des medailles. On avait d'abord conclu de l'irregularite de sa forme que ceUe forme etait naturelle et que ce devait etre un caillou roule dans les eaux du fleuve." 3For a recent treatment of the roles these men played at the birth of Assyriology, see Cathcart 1994: 1-29, and Larsen 1995: esp. 293-305. 4For publication and analysis of the "ancient kudurrus," see Gelb, Steinkeller, and Whiting 1991. The question of a relationship between the 'ancient kudurrus' and the Babylonian kudurrus is taken up below, Chapter Seven, The Place of the Babylonian Entitlement narfis in Mesopotamian Culture.






Chapter Two
Designation and Setting
Multiple features of the so-called kudurrus are inconsistent with their assumed function as 'boundary stones'. Foremost among these are evidence for their original placement and for their ancient native Babylonian designation. A boundary stone stands upon territory to distinguish physically a given boundary-an intangible abstraction that must be marked if it is to be perceptible, measurable, or defensible. Yet textual and archaeological evidence indicates that the kudurrus were not set upon land boundaries but rather were placed in temples. Close study of their inscriptions, moreover, reveals a problem of terminology. Rather than having been referred to in antiquity with the Akkadian word kudurru 'boundary', or, by extension 'boundary marker', the artifacts are designated in ancient Babylonian inscriptions as naru '(stone) stele' or '(stone) monument'. Accurate understanding of their ancient designation is crucial to the interpretation of texts pertaining to the objects and thus to reconstructing their ancient function. This chapter approaches the problem of terminology through close reading of textual passages making reference to the artifacts. Once the issue of designation can be clarified, the inquiry then turns to textual and archaeological information for ancient placement of the artifacts.

20 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
WHAT'S IN A NAME? THE PROBLEM OF TERMINOLOGY
Several expressions are employed in the inscriptions of the kudurrus to refer to the artifacts themselves. According to Brinkman (1980-83: 270):
By far the most common designation in antiquity for this type of inscribed object was naru, "stele" or "stone monument" ... (early clay examples were termed simply naru ,~a ba~'1bi, "clay monument".) Rarely were they called kudurru, the name which has won acceptance as their modem designation; there are less than a half dozen clear attestations of this term applied in the precise sense of "(boundary) stele", Other words used include the generic abnu ("stone"), and asumittu ("stele"), and the enigmatic NIO.NA (MDP 10, 90 II 31, 91 III 18; BE III, 83 rev. 21: Babylonian equivalent undetermined).
Brinkman's survey demonstrates that the label kudurru-adopted by modern Assyriologists for the artifacts under investigation yet applied only rarely by the ancient Babylonians-is not an apt designation. The following discussion is devoted to explication of textual passages that make reference to the artifacts. Passages are cited at length to show that nanl 'stele' or 'monument', and kudurru 'boundary' or 'boundary marker', occur throughout the corpus in regular and predictable contexts, and that, with very few exceptions, one term does not cross the semantic boundary into the regular context of the other. Occurrences of abnu 'stone', asumittu 'stele', naru Ja ba,~bi 'clay monument', and NIG.NA are taken up in turn. To facilitate observation of diachronic developments in the corpus, discussion is limited to datable inscriptions. This study designates an artifact as 'datable' if its inscription can be dated to
the reign of a specific king. 1 As noted above, regnal dates follow those of Brinkman's 1997 "Mesopotamian Chronology of the Historical Period." Philological notes in this and following chapters are kept to a minimum and included only when the translation might be in question. (Full editions of the inscriptions, with philological commentary, are to be published by the author in a separate volume currently in preparation. ) In keeping with standard Assyriological practice, royal names are rendered in the transla



CHAPTER 2: DESIGNATION AND SETTING 21
tions according to modern usage if a conventional spelling exists, i.e., the Biblicized form 'Nebuchadnezzar' is used instead of the more authentically Babylonian 'Nabfi-kudurrl-u~ur'. In the transliterated Akkadian passages, only the determinatives d(DN), i.e., preceding divine names; m(PN) and f(PN), i.e., preceding personal names, male and female; (GN)ki, i.e., following place names, are written above the line; all other determinatives are written on the line. Words under discussion have been highlighted in boldface type in the transliteration and the translation; such highlighting is, of course, not a feature of the original texts. The translations depart from line-by-line correspondence with the Akkadian text where not doing so would render awkward, poor, or incomprehensible English.
Passages containing the word nan)
In the inscriptions under investigation, Akkadian naru, '(stone) stele' or '(stone) monument', occurs prominently in curses and imprecations, in the names given to the artifact, and in one colophon. (The compositional elements and structure of the inscriptions are investigated below in Chapter Three.) The word naru is written syllabically or with the Sumerogram NAJNA.RU.A. With few exceptions, naru is inscribed with the cuneiform element or determinative NA4, signifying an artifact fashioned out of stone. The word naru occurs most frequently in the curses that close each text, where it is invoked as the locus of inscribed divine names. Of the datable inscriptions, 20 include some variation of the expression: ilani mala ina mubbi nare annf sumsunu zakru 'However many gods whose name( s) are invoked upon this naru'. For example, the text of an artifact from the early 12th century reads:
DINGIR.MES ma-la i-na UGU NA4.NA.RU.A an-ni-i [MU.NE].NE zakru ar-rat 1a nap-§u-ri li-ru-ru-§u-m[a]
However many gods whose [name]s are invoked upon this (s ton e) naru
May they curse him with a curse of no release, and... (Meli-Sipak BBSt 4, Face D 5-6)



22 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
The phrase is echoed, with vanatIOns, throughout later Inscnptions, including this excerpt from the late 12th century:
DINGIR.MES GAL.MES ma-la ina NA4.NA.RU.A an-ni-i MU-,M-nu MU ar-rat ijUL U-ru-ru-Ui
However many great gods whose names are inscribed upon thi s (stone) naru-May they curse him with an evil curse! (Nebuchadnezzar I, the Hinke "kudurru," v 5-7)
and this warning from the 8th century:
DINGIR.ME GAL.ME ma-la ina NA4.RU.A an-ni-i MU-Ju-nu zak-ru
However many great gods whose names are invoked upon thi s (stone) naru ... (Merodach-baladan II VAS I 37, v 45-46)
In addition to indicating the locus of inscribed divine names, the curses also make reference to divine symbols depicted upon the naru, as in this text dated to Nazi-Maruttas (1307-1282):
DINGIR.IvlES GAL.IvlES ma-la i-na UGU na-re-e an-ni-i Jum-Ju-nu za-ak-ru
GIS.TUKUL-Ju-nu kul-lu-mu if Ju-ha-tu4-Ju-nu ud-da-a
However many great gods, whose names are invoked, whose symbols are revealed, and whose socles are made known upon this naru ...
(Nazi-Maruttas MDP II 86, iii 16-22)
Akkadian kakku (written with the Sumerogram, GIS.TUKUL), literally, 'weapon', has in this context the meaning 'sign' or 'symbol', referring to the divine symbols sculpted upon the artifact (for other examples of this usage, see CAD K, s.v. kakku 3a-b). The Akkadian word §ubtu, pI. subatu 'seat', that is, the square altar/pedestal/socle upon which the divine symbol



CHAPTER 2: DESIGNATION AND SETTING 23
stands, is employed in this context to signify, by a figure of speech, the emblem of the god that rests upon it (see CAD S/3, s.v. §ubtu 2b2', where this and other passages from the corpus are cited; the recent discussion of George 1992: 9-10 and notes, and see figs. 1-3 and 5 herein). The semantic range of Akkadian terms used for sign or symbol in the corpus is discussed below, Chapter Four. A 12th century example also makes reference to emblems of the gods appearing on the naru, employing Akkadian ale§irtu, pI. ale§rtiletu 'sanctuary', as another term signifying the socle or pedestal, i.e., the locus of the divine symbol (see CAD A/2, s.v. a§irtu 3):
AN dEn-lfl if dNin-urta if dGu-la he-lu-u KI
if DINGIR.MES maJla1 i-na NA.RU.A §u-aJ tu4 ' d-re-tu-Ju-nu ud-da-a ez-zi-i,~ lik-kel-mu-,~u
(Divine) Anu, Enlil, and Ea, Ninurta and Gula, lords of the aforementioned territory, and however many gods whose socles are made known upon the aforementioned naruMay they look furiously upon him! (Merodach-baladan I BBSt 5, iii 26-32)
An 8th century passage, dated to Nabu-suma-iskun (760-ca. 748), is unique for making reference to the symbols but not to any inscribed divine names or curses. Here Akkadian nanztizu is used to signify the representation of the divine emblems, for which see the recent discussion of George 1992: 9 and 368-70, on mlnanztizu as the 'standing place' of a divine statue, and CAD Mil, s.v. manztizu 1. "'emplacement, stand, socle (of a stela), perching place, socket (of a door)."

24 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
However many gods whose socles are set firm upon this (s ton e ) naru-May (t)he(y) annihilate his seed! (Nabu-suma-iskun VAS I 36, vi 2-3)
Upon closer examination of the text and imagery of this particular object, however, the variation from the expected pattern makes perfect sense: while the inscription does not include a series of divine curses, the artifact does exhibit 25 divine symbols carved in relief (VAS I Beiheft, pI. 2). Divine names and emblems were not the only kinds of information inscribed and carved upon the naru. One inscription, documenting a grant of King Meli-Sipak (1186-1172) to his daughter, ijunnubat-Nanayya, records the act of inscribing the naru and reflects the contents of its inscription. Note also that according to the text, the king placed the naru in the presence of a goddess:
!up-pa za-kut URU.MES ik-nu-uk-ma id-din-si it ma-la id-di-nu-si
in NA4.NA.RU.A i,~-!ur-ma

A tablet of settlement exemptions, he (Meli-Sipak) sealed and gave to her (ijunnubat-Nanayya). Moreover, all that he gave to her he inscribed on a (stone) naru and placed in the presence of (divine) Nanayya, [x?] this? the sanctuary(?); he stood (it) there for the duration. (Meli-Sipak MDP X 87, ii 9-15)
The naru could also be inscribed with the name of the recipient of the grant, as seen in another passage from the NabO-sumaiskun inscription cited just above:
sa NA4.RU.A
an-na-a ina N~ GUL ina IZI i-qam-mu-u ina SUijUS i-tam-mir ana A.ME SUB-u

(Nabu-suma-iskun VAS I 36, iv 19-v 3)
25
This excerpt also provides additional information about the physical form of the naru: it was considered vulnerable to burning, burial, being thrown into water or otherwise hidden where it could not be seen or read. (For the expression puzru x subuzu 'to hide (trans.)', see CAD All , s.v. abiizu 6.) Moreover, the texts evince concern that the artifact's inscription could be effaced. Other inscriptions, such as this one dated to Nazi-Maruttas, elaborate on such dangers to the naru, and list persons considered to pose a threat:

Similar hazards are outlined In an inscription of Merodachbaladan I (1171-1159):

That man, (who), because of these curses, would engage another, (who) would order a simple, half-witted, convictionless, ignorant (person), and cause (him) to raise up the aforementioned (stone) naru and cast it into water or fire, (who) would bury (it) in the ground, (who) would set (it) in a place where it cannot be seen/read, (who) would smash (it) with a rock, (who) would efface my inscribed name... (Merodach-baladan I MDP VI 31, iv 21-v 4)
Thus, according to the inscriptions, the object known as naru was made of stone and was inscribed with the terms of a gift or contract including the name of the beneficiary, as well as with divine names and curses. It bore pictorial symbols or emblems of the gods. The naru was vulnerable to certain kinds of damage: it was liable to being removed from its place, smashed with a rock, burned in a fire, thrown into a canal or river or down a well, concealed, buried in dust or dirt, or otherwise hidden away. More



CHAPTER 2: DESIGNATION AND SETTING 27
over, the inscription of the naru was subject to erasure or effacement-and it should be noted that some members of the corpus do show evidence of their inscriptions having been rubbed down, with at least one having been re-inscribed.3 Quite clearly, according to their own inscriptions, the term naru is used to designate the artifacts under investigation.
Passages containing the word kudurru
The majority of attestations for the Akkadian word kudurru are found in the very inscriptions under study, where it occurs in curses, imprecations, and in names given to the artifacts. Written syllabically or with the Sumerogram NIG.DU, kudurru is never inscribed with a determinative indicating its material. The term kudurru occurs most frequently in curses calling divine wrath upon a would-be malefactor. The earliest such attestation may be one found in BBSt 1, a clay cone-shaped object commemorating Kadasman-Enlil's affirmation of a land grant made by an earlier king, Kurigalzu.4 The artifact and its inscription are treated in detail, below, Chapter Six; the context of the word kudurru in this inscription provides no clue as to its referent. The oldest occurrence of kudurru in an informative context is in a passage dated to the reign of Nazi-Maruttas, inscribed on a member of the corpus excavated in the temple of Samas in the city of Larsa:
[d]Nin-urta EN mi-<i$->ri u ku-dur-ri mi-$i-ir-su Ii -is-muk [ku-dur- ]ra-su li-su-!Ji
May (divine) Ninurta, lord ofborder(s) and kudurru(s), obliterate (lit., fill in) his border! May he uproot his [kudur]ru! (Nazi-Maruttas RA 66, 38-39)
This curse is confidently restored on the basis the inscription of another of the artifacts excavated in the same room at Larsa. This one is dated to Kudur-Enlil (1254-1246), who reigned half a century later:
dNin-urta EN mi-i$-ri u ku-dur-ri mi-$i-ir-su li-is-muk ku-durra-[su lissu!J]



28 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
May Ninurta, lord of border(s) and kudurru(s), obliterate (lit., fill in) his border! May he [uproot his] kudurru! (Kudur-Enlil RA 66, 69)
The basic meaning of the verb samiiku is 'to dam or fill in a canal'; see CAD S, s.v. samiiku 2b, where this passage is cited with the tentative definition 'to remove(?)'. Canals were often served to mark land boundaries, and the use of the verb in this context is perfectly apt: 'to fill in' would obliterate an excavated canal, neutralizing its efficacy as a border/border marker. The pairing of kudurru and mi~ljru, with Ninurta as their lord, is not limited to inscriptions dated to the Kassite dynasty. The same phrase occurs on a member of the corpus dated to the reign of the Isin II king Nebuchadnezzar I (1125-1104) and found at Nippur:
dNin-urta EN mi-i$-ri u NIG.DU NIG.DU-su ZI-ub
May Ninurta, lord of border and kudurru, uproot his kudurru! (Nebuchadnezzar I , the Hinke "kudurru," iv 19)
The curse is amplified in another passage from the 11 th century with the addition of ussu, a term that can be translated 'boundary line' (see AHw 3, s.v. usu I, ussu Ib):
dNin-urta IBILA E-sar-ra DUMU dEn-lfl us-su mi-$ir-s u u ku-dur-ra-su /i-is-su-uk
Ninurta, heir of Esarra, august child of Enlil, may he scatter his boundary line, border, and kudurru!
(Marduk-nadin-alJlJe, the Caillou Michaux, iv 1-4)
From a curse in an inscription attributed to the reign of Marduk-nadin-alJlJe (1099-1082), kudurru occurs alongside the terms pulukku 'boundary stake', 'boundary' (see AHw 2, s.v. pulukku 4), and kisurru 'boundary' or 'territory' (see AHw 1, s. v. kisurru 1 and 3; CAD K, s.v. kisurru 1 and 2):
dNin-urta su-pu-u DUMU dEn-hi qar-du



CHAPTER 2: DESIGNATION AND SETTING

Famous Ninurta, heroic son of Enlil, lord of border( s) and this kudurru, may he uproot his kudurru! May he remove his border stake! May he obliterate his boundary! (Marduk-nadin-alJlJe Sumer 38, v 11-18)
29
These passages illustrate the regular invocation of the god Ninurta as the lord of mi~ru 'border( s)' and kudurru( s). Consequently it is he who is called upon to exact punishment for harming a kudurru-typically by uprooting the kudurru( s) of the offender. The close association of kudurru with mi.yru can be found as well in imprecations of the inscriptions, passages in which potential damage to the kudurru is interdicted. The earliest such occurrence of kudurru is found in an inscription from the time of MeliSipak, in which lku 'dike, boundary ditch', mi~ru, and kudurru occur together:
la ta-bal A.sA-,~u za-ku-us-su ki-a-am i,~-kun
i-na A.SA-,~u ni-,~i-ir-ta it ki-iz-za-ta la sa-ka-ni

are not imposed;
(so that) boundary ditch, border and kudurru are not disturbed; (so that) lawsuits, vindication, and claim, are not incurred... (Meli-Sipak MDP II 99 ii 6-17)
This passage is cited at length to show the deliberate ordering of logically related items, and its difficult grammar requires comment. Aro (1955) regarded this genitive infinitive construction as "merkwtirdig und locker," pointing out that the construction only occurs in this corpus and always in the negative. He offered a partial translation of this passage (Aro 1955: 123): "an seinem Felde keine Verminderung oder Abschneidung zu tun usw., bestimmte er das Nicht-Fortgenommenwerden seines Feldes." According to Aro's interpretation, the series of infinitives are governed by the finite form iskun-ma that follows long after in line 46. In a subsequent study on the Akkadian infinitive, Aro ( 1961 : 70) included this passage under the heading Genitive Infinitive Absolute, and translated: "damit an seinem Felde nicht Verminderung und Abzug veranstaltet werde, damit der Graben, die Grenze und der Grenzstein nicht zerstort werden, damit (das Feld) weder Anspruch, Vindizierung noch Anklage treffe... er bestimmte (damit) die Freiheit seiner Stadt, seines Umkreises und alles, was er ihm gegeben hatte." Aro noted as well that the genitive forms could also be dependent upon zakutu. However the grammar is precisely understood, Line 6, la tahal eqllsu 'not to take away his field', corresponds to lines 9-17, a passage which, in turn, lends itself to the following subdivisions:
9-11 12-14 15-17
ways in which the land granted may not be reduced ways in which the borders may not be altered ways in which legalistic routes for taking the land are not to be pursued.
As components of this well-wrought text, the elements fku, mi$ru, and kudurru are subject to the logic behind composition of the



CHAPTER 2: DESIGNATION AND SETTING 31
entire inscription, and their grouping together must be recognized as deliberate. The terms fku, mi.yru, and kudurru occur similarly in an inscription from the time of Meli-Sipak's son and successor, Merodach-baladan I (MDP VI 31, iii 24-iv 21). Likewise, in a much later excerpt from the corpus, dated to his eighth century namesake, Merodach-baladan II, the word kudurru occurs together with kisurru and pulukku:
A.sA.ME DUMU.ME TIN.TIRki la-bi-rat
.M ERIN2 KUR ina ,~i-gil!-ti it-ba-lu-ma ina fa SIPA-ut par-ga-nis ik-kal a-bu-ti ki-sur-ri-si-na im-ma-su-ma pu-lu-uk-ki fa ,~it-ku-nu qar-ba-ti NIG.DU-si-na
nu-uk-fku '-ru-ma fa mu-ub-bu-~a
the fields of the sons of Babylon of old -which foreign troops had confiscated through unlawful seizure, and (now) un-shepherded foreign (sheep) consume the green pasture landtheir borders were forgotten and boundary stakes were not put in place, in the fields their kudurrus were removed and (so) were not driven in.
(Merodach-baladan n,vAS I 37 iii 15-22)
Thus, throughout the period for which these stone objects are attested, evidence from their inscriptions shows that the term kudurru was employed alongside mi$ru, ussu, kisurru, fku, and pulukku-terms denoting borders or the markers of borders located in the fields. Accordingly, the harm to which a kudurru was chiefly vulnerable was that of being uprooted, disturbed, made unrecognizable, or removed. The connection of the god Ninurta with field borders and boundaries is a logical one in keeping with Ninurta's role as a farmer god, an association well established in Mesopotamian literary and religious tradition (see Black, Green, and Rickards 1992: 142-43). That such a conception of Ninurta was productive in Kassite and Post-Kassite Babylonia is demonstrated by use of the plow to symbolize Ninurta visually on the very artifacts under investigation. In fact, his dual nature as a war



32 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
god and as a farmer god uniquely qualify Ninurta for the job of protecting the ownership of fields and the sanctity of their boundaries. The consistent pairing of mi.yru and kudurru in Ninurta's divine epithet is an additional piece of evidence bolstering the notion that the entity designated kudurru belongs to the genus 'boundary' or 'boundary marker', and that its location should be sought in the fields. According to the inscription of Merodachbaladan II cited just above, the kudurru was an object that could be 'pounded in' (mubbu~u D, for which see CAD Mil, s.v. maba~su 7 h 'to drive a peg in (with reference to this passage) to mark a territorial boundary. There are no indications that the kudurru was inscribed, sculpted, or was made of stone.
Passages containing both kudurru and naru
Some passages from the corpus contain both the naru and kudurru, and these would seem to preclude the possibility that both terms were used to signify the same entity. Ten of the extant datable artifacts bear names, or titles, and five of these include both kudurru and naru. The following names are presented in chronological order.
From the reign of Nazi-Maruttas:
MU -mi na-re-e
dAG SES ku-dur
A.SA.MES
The name of the naru (i s ): "NabG. (is) Protector of the kudurru(s) of the Fields." (Nazi-Maruttas MDP II 86, iv 34-36)

The name of this naru (is): "Ninurta (is) Maintainer of the Enduring kudurrus of



CHAPTER 2: DESIGNATION AND SETTING
Uzbi-Enlil," (is) its name. (Merodach-baladan I Sumer 23, 10'-14')
From the reign of Nebuchadnezzar I:
MU NA4.NA.RU.A an-ni-i dNin-urta u dNUSKU mu-kin ku-dur-ri MU .NE
The name of this (stone) naru (is): "Ninurta and Nuska (are) Protectors of kudurru(s)," (is) its name." (Nebuchadnezzar I, the Hinke "kudurru," above the field plan preceding column i)
From the reign of Marduk-nadin-atJtJe:
sa NA4.NA.RU.A an-ni-i mu-ki-in ku-dur-ri da-ra-ti MU-,~u
Of this (stone) naru, "Protector of Enduring kudurrus," (is) its name. (Marduk-nadin-aIJlJe BBSt 7, preceding column i)
From the reign of Marduk-sapik-zeri (1081-1069):
MU NA4.NA.RU.A an-ni-i
dNin-urta mu-kin ku-dur (sic!) da-ra-ti MU.NE
The name of this (stone) n aru (i s: ) "Ninurta, Maintainer of Enduring kudurrus," (is) its name. (Marduk-sapik-zeri Sumer 36, v 13-14)
33
Four of these names contain both kudurru and naru III some variation of the formula: "The name of this nara (is): DN (is) Protector of the kudurru". According to the inscription dating to Marduk-nadin-atJtJe, the name of the nara itself is: "Protector of Enduring kudurrus." These passages preclude the possibility that the two terms were used to refer to the same entity. The word kudurru is best understood in these passages as signifying 'boundary', and the artifact names should be translated: "The name of this (stone) nara (is): "The god (DN) (is) Protector of the Enduring Boundary."



34 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
Of the remaining five names, two relate the name of the naru without reference to kudurru.
From the reign of Nazi-Maruttas:
na-ru-u ,M AsA.MES GIS.SUB.E GIS.KIRI6 ,~a mpu-uz-ri LO.nar-gal-li
,M E.BABBAR.RA PAP MU.NE
naru of fields, prebend, (and) orchard of Puzru, cantor of the Ebabbar; "Protector" is its name. (Nazi-Maruttas RA 66, 1-2)
From the reign of Marduk-sapik-zeri:
MU NA4.NA.RU.A an-ni-i
dNin-urta ,~a pa-qf-ri se-ker ,~ap-ti-,~u! (SU)
The name of this naru (is): "Ninurta Shuts the Lips of One who Raises Claims!" (Of, "Ninurta, Shut the Lips of One who Raises Claims!") (Marduk-sapik-zeri ZA 65, 87-88)
Thus, seven out of the ten preserved names identify the artifact as a naru, and five of those preclude identification of the entity kudurru with the entity naru. In addition to the names, the terms kudurru and naru are occasionally found together in the main portion of the inscribed text. This is illustrated by a passage from the Caillou Michaux (Marduk-nadin-abbe) :

(Marduk-nadin-alJlJe Caillou Michaux, i 20-iii 8)
35
In this single passage, the terms kudurru and nara are clearly used to signify two distinct objects. From another 11th century Isin II inscription:

(Marduk-sapik-zeri ZA 65, 39-45)
Note also the location of the nara in the presence of the gods Samas and Sin. In the following excerpt from an inscription of the same king, the translation 'progeny' for kudurru is demanded by the context in which the gods are called upon in a series of four parallel curses to destroy the potential transgressor's memory and descendants. (Meanings of kudurru are discussed below in this chapter, p. 53; for discussion of curses that aim to wipe out a man's descendants and memory, see Chapter Seven, pp. 265-6.)

37
These passages constitute clear and unambiguous textual evidence in support of the hypothesis that kudurru signifies one thing-boundary, or boundary marker of unspecified material, without inscription or imagery, existing in spatial association with the limits of the territory they marked-and that nara signifies another, that is, the inscribed and sculpted stone artifacts that are the subject of this study. Nonetheless, there are two inscriptions in the corpus in which kudurru is used to refer to the stone artifacts under investigation. In this pair of inscriptions, both attributed to Meli-Sipak, the term kudurru occurs in the name of the object, a sequence of prohibitions, and in the final clause of a series of curses.
From Meli-Sipak BBSt 4:
MU ku-dur-r[i] an-ni-i dIM UMUN UR.SAG pa-at-ti nu-ub-.vi .vur-ka
The name of this kudurru (is): "Adad, Heroic Lord-Bestow Here Abundant Streams!" (Meli-Sipak BBSt 4, on the relief field of face A, below the figure of the winged centaur)
From evidence of other names reviewed above, we would expect to find nara rather than kudurru in this position. Curiously, however, in the body of this same inscription, the term nara is en



38 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
countered in an expected context, as the locus of inscribed divine names:
DINOIR.MES ma-la i-na UOU NA4.NA.RU.A an-ni-i [MU].NE.NE zak-ru

However many gods whose [name] s are invoked upon this (s ton e ) naru
May they curse him a curse of no release, and may they decree not even a single day for his life! (Meli-Sipak BBSt 4, face D 5-7)
The body of this text also provides an unparalleled use of NA4 abnu 'stone' in a context where we would expect to find nara:

CHAPTER 2: DESIGNATION AND SETTING
May Anu, father of the gods, curse him as an enemy! (Meli-Sipak BBSt 4, Face B 12-C 9)
39
In other inscriptions, like those reviewed earlier in this chapter, interdictions against harming the nara regularly come at the end of the list of sanctions and immediately before the first of the series of curses. In other words, prohibitions aimed specifically against harming the nara occupy a place of positional prominence within the structure of the inscription (for the concept of positional prominence, see Silk 1974, esp. 63-71). In this passage, however, the prohibition against damaging the abnu 'stone' occupies the prominent, final position that in other inscriptions is occupied by the nara '( stone) monument'. This circumstance, in combination with the unusual use of kudurru where we expect to find nara in the artifact name, indicates that the author of this text used three different terms, kudurru 'boundary/boundary marker', nara '(stone) monument' and abnu 'stone' to designate the object. It is in another inscription of Meli-Sipak that kudurru is used in a context in which nara is expected:

in the dustMay Anu, Enlil, and Ea, the great gods, look upon him with the anger of their hearts! (Meli-Sipak BBSt 3, v 27-vi 2)
In this passage, it is the kudurru that is subject to the kinds of damage that in other inscriptions is typically inflicted upon the nara: sending an afflicted person to remove it, burning it with fire, throwing it into water, burying it in the dust, and generally causing its destruction. No less significantly, the kudurru is not subjected according to this passage to typical kudurru-type threats-being disturbed or uprooted along with mi~ru or other expressions for boundary or boundary marker. Moreover, the imprecation against harming the kudurru in this passage comes immediately before the curse section of the inscription-the position of compositional prominence reserved in other inscriptions for prohibitions against harming the nara. The same text continues with a summation of the divine curses:
DINGIR.MES ma-la i-na mu-ub ku-dur-ri an-ni-i MU-su-nu zak-ru MU-su li-bal-li-qu
However many gods whose names are invoked upon this kudurruMay they obliterate his name! (Meli-Sipak BBSt 3, vi 21-23)
Here again the term kudurru occurs in a context otherwise occupied by nara, that is, as the locus of inscribed divine names. In this inscription, the term kudurru is used to signify the artifact at hand and not a boundary or boundary marker in the field. The colophon of this same inscription contains the only extant use of asumittu 'stele' in the corpus:

41
The word nanl does not occur once in this inscription. Rather, in this text, the terms kudurru and asumittu have been employed in the way the term nara is used In other inscriptions-to designate the stone artifact at hand.
Passage containing naru sa ba~bi
A colophon of one member of the corpus reports that at the time a land parcel was granted, during the reign of Nazi-Maruttas, the recipient inscribed a nara sa ba~bi, a 'stele (or monument) of clay', and stood it before his god. In the reign of Merodachbaladan I, according to the text, a wall collapsed upon this clay nara, and it was destroyed. Another man, presumably heir to the property, inscribed a new nara in stone-"a copy of the old one"-and set it up in its place:

At that time Kasakti-SU.GAB, son of Nusku-na )id inscribed a naru of clay, and



42 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
stood (it) before his god. In the reign of Marduk-apla-iddina, king of the world, son of Meli-Sipak, king of Babylon, a wall collapsed upon the aforementioned naru and it was destroyed. Suhuli-SU.GAB,
so~ of Nibi-Sipak, inscribed a new naru of stone -a copy of the old oneand set (it) up. (Nazi-Maruttas MDP II 86, Face III I-Face IV 12)
An item that may, in fact, be a nara sa lJa.Jbi, is KadasmanEnlil BBSt 1, a clay cone-shaped, perhaps stele-shaped object documenting Kadasman-Enlil's affirmation of a land grant given by a previous king, Kurigalzu (see also Brinkman 1980-83: 268). Discussion of the artifact and an edition of its inscription are presented below, in Chapter Six (Artifact A).
Passages containing NIG.NA
NIG.NA occurs three times in the corpus as an apparent designation for the artifacts: twice in an inscription of Meli-Sipak and once in an inscription of Enlil-nadin-apli. Meli-Sipak MDP X 87, on display in the galleries of the Louvre, is a roughly quadriform stele with a relief on one side and a long, partially preserved inscription on the other three sides (fig. 4). Nine columns of the original inscription survive. Columns i-iv are almost complete, only a few lines are left of columns v, vii, much of column viii survives, and of column ix, only about six lines remain. The fully preserved columns range from 26 to 36 lines in length; all told, just over 150 lines of text are preserved. As Seidl (1989: 26, No. 23) observed, the relief is positioned between two rubbed-down panels, above and below, that were at one time inscribed (fig. 4 and Seidl pI. lla). Collation in 1996 confirmed Seidl's observations: the face with the relief still shows traces of cuneiform signs on the surfaces where the inscription had deliberately been effaced. Portions of the

44 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
inscription on the other sides exhibit similar treatment. Given the presence of secondary Elamite dedicatory inscriptions on other statues and monuments removed from Babylonia to Susa, it seems likely that the Babylonian text was effaced in preparation for an Elamite votive text that was never inscribed (as was apparently also the case with the Law Stele of fJammurapi).
Despite the loss of a substantial portion of the text through this deliberate effacement, the subject, set out in the beginning of the inscription, is clear: King Meli-Sipak made a gift of several parcels of land-one large enough to encompass a number of settlements-to his daughter, ijunnubat-Nanayya. When the stele was first published, it was assumed that the relief depicted King Meli-Sipak, his daughter, ijunnubat-Nanayya, and the goddess Nanayya, and it was suggested that ijunnubat-Nanayya was herself a priestess of Nanayya (Scheil 1900: 87). The first instance of NIG.NA in the inscription occurs In a series of positive injunctions:

45
On the basis of the pattern established by other inscriptions, according to which the artifact is set up (kunnu) before the divinity (mabar Nanayya), it seems logical to interpret NIG.NA as another designation for the object under study. The text continues, however, and goes on to refer to the NIG.NA and to the naru as distinct entities:

However, if that man hates truth, has no need for justice, and loves litigation, (if) he sets his mind to taking away those settlements, to altering the borders of their fields, and to the dissolution of this firm prebend, (if) he removes this NIG.NA which is set up before Nanayya and enters (it) into a forbidden place where (it) cannot be seen, or removes this (stone) naru from its station and places (it) where (it) cannot be seen, casts (it) into water or fire, covers it over with dust, or erases what is inscribed thereon, alters the aforementioned acts and changes that information ... (Meli-Sipak MDP X 87: iii 9-31)
It is not possible to interpret NIG.NA in this second passage as another term for the artifact at hand, that is, as a synonym for nara; NIG.NA and nara clearly signify two different and distinct entities. Moreover, nara is employed precisely as expected: a would-be malefactor is enjoined against doing harm by removing it from its place, concealing it where it cannot be seen, casting it into water or fire, covering it over with dust, or erasing and altering its inscription. In this passage, nara is clearly used to designate the inscribed and sculpted stone artifact under discussion. The problem remains to determine what is meant by the cuneiform writing NIG.NA. NIG.NA may signify precisely what it customarily designates in cuneiform inscriptions: Sumerian NIG.NA, Akkadian nignakku, 'censer'. Support for this interpretation is found in the relief sculpted on the stele (fig. 4). The relief depicts, from left to right, a female figure seated on a throne, facing right, with her



CHAPTER 2: DESIGNATION AND SETTING 47
hands raised in a pose that might suggest a gesture of acceptance; a censer on a stand (as identified already by Seidl 1989: 208); a human male, facing left, wearing a crown and leading by the hand a smaller female, bearing a harp, into the presence of the enthroned female figure. The seated female is larger than either of the persons standing. In the field above all three humanoid figures are sculpted, again from left to right, an eight-pointed star, a moon-crescent, and a four-pointed star with rays-well-established emblems of the gods Btar, Sin, and Samas. The relief composition is one known to students of Mesopotamian art as a 'presentation scene'. In a presentation scene, one person is led into the presence of a seated superior by a third figure whose status-and posItion in the composition-mediates between the seated, supreme figure, typically a god or king, and the person he leads. We have seen already one instance in which the composition of the reliefs and the composition of the inscription reflect an integrated design. In NabQ-suma-iskun VAS I 36, discussed earlier in this chapter, the inscription makes reference to the gods' symbols but not to their names, and, in fact, the stone does bear a number of sculpted divine emblems while the inscription lacks multiple curses, i.e., divine names. The stele Meli-Sipak MDP X 87 presents another example of integrated text and imagery. Scheil (1908: 87), in his publication of the inscription, had already assumed identification of the persons in the relief with the individuals who "figure" in the inscription:
Meli-Sipak leads by the hand his daughter, Hunnubat-Nanayya, beneficiary of royal largesse and probably priestess of the temple. She carries a harp that resembles a heptacord. 11
On the basis of the inscription and the relief, it is not possible to prove Scheil's supposition that ijunnubat-Nanayya was probably a priestess of Nanayya. However, the goddess clearly does playa role in the text and in the royal grant: it is in her presence that the NIO.NA and the naru bearing the terms of the grant were placed, as seen in the passages cited above and in a third passage from the inscription (cited earlier in this chapter and repeated here in translation only):



48 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
A tablet of settlement exemptions, he (Meli-Sipak) sealed and gave to her (ijunnubat-Nanayya). Moreover, all that he gave to her he inscribed on a (stone) naru and placed in the presence of (divine) Nanayya, [x?] this? the sanctuary(?); he stood (it) there for the duration. (Meli-Sipak MDP X 87: ii 9-15)
There is thus a demonstrable positive correlation between the information conveyed by the inscription and the information communicated by the relief: the relief represents Meli-Sipak, the king, leading ijunnubat-Nanayya, his daughter, into the presence of the seated goddess, Nanayya. This correlation enables us to enlist information from the relief to aid interpretation of the inscription. The mysterious writing NIG.NA, denoting, according to the inscription, an object set up in the presence of the goddess, signifies the Akkadian word nignakku 'censer', and corresponds to the visual representation of the censer sculpted in the center of the relief field. The writing NIG.NA in the inscription of Enlil-nadin-apli (1103-1100) is less deftly explained. The artifact is a tabletshaped stone, inscribed with a short text of 46 lines. The stone bears no relief sculptures. The text is given here in full, and the writing NIG.NA occurs in line 21 of the reverse, in the name of the artifact.

50 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
came with prayer and supplication before the king, his lord, Enlil-nadin-apli, and spoke to him as follows: 20-21 "Our heroic youth, pious prince, wise §akkanakku, one who reveres his gods: 22 Regarding mistress Nanse, eldest daughter of Ea, rev. 1-2 her border is not disturbed; her kudurru is not removed. 3-5 Now, Ekarra-iqissa, §iikin miiti of BH-Sin-magir, has disturbed her border, has removed her kudurru. 6-10 The king instructed Ekarra-iqissa, §iikin miiti of BH-Sinmagir, and Eanna-suma-iddina, ,Mkin mati of the Sealand, and when they made inquiries of the descendants of the 'experts' familiar with the neighboring (lands), the aforementioned field was restored to its boundary line. 11-14 Whensoever in the future, whether aklu, or laputtu, or §akkanakku, or anyone (else) whom BH-Sin-magir might send and (who) would revere the name of Namma and Nanse, 15-20 may Namma and Nanse, mistresses, goddesses, look upon him truly and with Ea, creator of all things, destine for him a destiny of life! Days of old age and years of justice may they give him as a gift! 21-24 The name of this NIG.NA (is): May you not transgress the borders! May you not disturb the boundary! Despise evil and love truth!
It is extremely unlikely that NIG.NA in rev. 21 of BE 1/1 is a writing for nara. Ungnad (1944: 97 and n. 6) proposed that it was a writing for abnu 'stone', reading rev. 21 as sum sa abni (NA) an-ni-i 'Der Name dieses Steines (ist):'. Brinkman (1968: 118, n. 672) initially followed Ungnad, rendering rev. 21-23 "sumu sa abni annf: e tetiq ita e tusaJ;J;i mi,~[ra] The name of this stone: may you not transgress the borders, may you not disturb the boun[dary]." But, by the time of his RLA article, "kudurru," (cited at the beginning of this chapter), he had abandoned this interpretation in favor of reading NIG.NA. BE III 83 has no relief imagery, and aside from the writing NIG.NA, there are no clues, visual or verbal, indicating the presence of a censer. Nonetheless, parallels can be drawn between Enlil-nadin-apli BE III 83 and Meli-Sipak MDP X 87 that may



CHAPTER 2: DESIGNATION AND SETTING 51
suggest the presence of cultic equipment. According to the MeliSipak text:

In the corpus under study, the expression ana pilkill ipluk occurs only in these two inscriptions, and this philological parallel may reinforce situational parallels as well. According to other inscriptions of the artifacts, a gift of land to a cleric was regarded as a gift to the god served by the cleric. This is demonstrated, for example, by Nebuchadnezzar BBSt 24, according to which the king granted land and exemptions to a Jangu-priest of the god dURU-ia and his son (lines 19-30). Later in the text, the same gift of lands and exemptions is said to have been bestowed upon the god dURU-ia (lines 38-41). In other words, a gift of land to a priest was a gift to the temple and reserved for the use of the priest. This is supported by Oelsner's (1982: 407 and n. 31) observation about gifts to the temple:
Vergabe von Land an Tempel bzw Tempel und Proester haben auch mehrere andere der alteren Kudurrus zum Inhalt... Priester, moglicherweise im Unterschied zu Beamten und Militars, die Verwalstun und Nutzung ihres Landes nicht selbstandig ausiibten,



52 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
dies vielmehr von den zusHindigen Tempelbehorden wahrgenommen wurde.
The Enlil-nadin-apli text, BE III 83, commemorates the restoration of previously granted land to a temple. Meli-Sipak MDP X 87 commemorates a large gift of land and settlements to the king's daughter, a person likely affiliated with the temple of Nanayya as indicated both by the text, i.e., that the nara was set up explicitly in the presence of that goddess, and by the relief, i.e., depicting the presentation of the princess to the goddess by her father, the king. The sculptural detail of the harp carried by the female figure may also be a visual allusion to her status as a member of the temple's personnel. The depiction of a musical instrument brings to mind not only the general role of music and musicians in Mesopotamian cult practice, but also specifically the celebrated princess En-tJeduanna, daughter of the 3rd millennium Akkadian king, Sargon, and priestess of the moon god Nanna/Sin. In addition to her status as daughter of the king as well as cultic priestess, En-tJeduanna was traditionally held to be the composer of several cycles of highly accomplished temple hymns. Thus, because a grant to an office holder of a temple was tantamount to a grant to the temple itself, the unique formulary ana pilkill ipluk 'he delimited as the boundary/territory' found in both the inscriptions of Meli-Sipak MDP X 87 and Enlil-nadinapli BE III 83 may have to do with the delineation of temple lands (for pilku as 'boundary' as well as 'territory (circumscribed by the boundary)' see AHw 2, s.v. palaku and pilku I). In that regard, it would not be unreasonable to find a cultic appurtenance, such as a censer, set up as part and parcel of a royal allocation to a temple and its officers. The inscription of Meli-Sipak MDP X 87 records that a nignakku 'censer' was set up as an aspect of Meli-Sipak's gift and that others were called upon to protect and maintain it before Nanayya in the future. There are no known parallels for a named censer, which would be the case if we read nignakku 'censer' for NfG.NA in Enlil-nadin-apli BE 83 1/1. Nonetheless, on the basis of the parallels to Meli-Sipak MDP X 87, this study favors reading NfG.NA in Enlil-nadin-apli BE 83 1/1 as nignakku, referring to a censer set up when Enlil-nadin-apli



CHAPTER 2: DESIGNATION AND SETTING 53
assented to the petItIOn of the §anga-priest and restored mIsappropriated lands to Nanse and her temple.
Modern dictionaries and native terminology
The foregoing discussion demonstrates that rather than kudurru, the Akkadian word nara '(stone) stele' or '(stone) monument' was the regular native Babylonian designation for the artifacts under investigation. In one documented case, a nara §a ba.ybi, a 'stele/monument of clay', originally fashioned to document a royal grant, was subsequently replaced by a nara of stone after the inadvertent destruction of the clay original. The Akkadian terms abnu 'stone' and asumittu 'stele' each occurs once in the corpus under investigation to designate the artifacts, and the term NIG.NA is most likely the Sumerian logogram for Akkadian nignakku 'censer', possibly referring to a censer set up at the same time as the nara. The principal unresolved terminological issue of the inscriptions then is the meaning and use of the word kudurru. The Akkadisches Handworterbuch (AHw) and the Chicago Assyrian Dictionary (CAD) each offer three separate meanings for Akkadian kudurru: 'boundary', 'boundary-stone', and '(firstborn son); heir'. Although the inscriptions under investigation make use of the homophony shared by kudurru 'boundary/boundary stone' and kudurru 'heir', this discussion is concerned with the meanings 'boundary' and 'boundary stone', that is, AHw 1, s.v. kudurru II, and CAD K, s.v. kudurru A. Under kudurru II, the AHw lists 'boundary' before 'boundary stone', implying that 'boundary' is the primary meaning and 'boundary stone' the secondary. According to kudurru A in the CAD, however, 'boundary stone, boundary marker' takes primacy to 'boundary (line)', and, in addition, kudurru can also designate 'region, territory'. Recourse to the verbal root kdr does not clarify the meaning of the noun: according to the AHw, the verb kadiiru is derived from the noun kudurru. Each dictionary defines the verb kadiiru (D~G) 'to establish a border', a meaning that is elaborated by the CAD K, s.v. kadiiru B: "(by means of a boundary stone), to set up a boundary stone."



54 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
In sum, for the noun kudurru, both dictionaries imply a transference of meaning between the notion of a 'boundary' and the concrete idea of a 'boundary marker'. Such a carry-over would not be unparalleled; for the Classical world, Moses Finley (1951: 3-4) posited precisely such a transference in regard to ancient Greek boundary markers, horoi:
The basic meaning of the word horos in Greek is "limit," "boundary," "definition." By an easy figure of speech the same word was applied to the object that marked a boundary. These markers are known to us from all periods and all regions of the ancient Greek world: slabs of marble, limestone, volcanic rock, or other available stone driven into the ground at appropriate spots.
Used to denote a simple boundary marker placed upon a property line, the term horos eventually came to designate inscribed stones deposited in a building in order to publicize a land dealing, typically a debt incurred against the value of the land. Gelb, Steinkeller, and Whiting (1991) argued for a parallel between the evolution of the Greek horos and the Babylonian kudurru. According to these authors, "both the Akkadian term kudurru and the Greek term horos lost their original meaning "boundary," "boundary stone" when they were no longer set up in the field, but were deposited in a building" (Gelb, Steinkeller, and Whiting 1991: 24). But is a parallel between the evolution of Greek horos and Akkadian kudurru supported by the Babylonian evidence? As demonstrated in the foregoing discussion, the artifacts under consideration were primarily known as naru '(stone) stele' or '( stone) monument'. Only in two inscriptions, both dated to the reign of Meli-Sipak and both originating in the same city, were the artifacts in question clearly referred to with the word kudurru. If the inscriptions of Meli-Sipak attest to a time when the artifacts were known by the term kudurru, then their place in the chronological record would speak against the evolution proposed by Gelb, Steinkeller, and Whiting. The inscriptions of Meli-Sipak were written toward the beginning, though not the very beginning, of the life span of the artifacts. If there were an evolution in the meaning of the word kudurru from 'boundary marker' to 'public monument recording transaction having to do with land',



CHAPTER 2: DESIGNATION AND SETTING 55
then instances of the word kudurru used to designate 'inscribed and sculpted public stone monument' should occur toward the end of the sequence, not the beginning. A different interpretation for the Babylonian application of the word kudurru emerges from the foregoing discussion. The word naru '(stone) stele' or 'monument' was the regular native designation for the inscribed and sculpted stone artifacts under investigation. The Akkadian term kudurru never lost its original meaning 'boundary' or by extension 'boundary marker', and was used to signify the boundaries of land described in the inscriptions, or the markers of unspecified form and material used to mark those boundaries. The term kudurru may also be understood, by extension, to refer to the territory enclosed by a boundary, as catalogued by the CAD K, s. v. kudurru A. The understanding of kudurru as 'territory enclosed by a boundary' is particularly appealing when considered against the background of Babylonian mathematics, in which surface area was conceived and calculated as "that which is circumscribed (by a geometric shape)," (Robson 2000, and personal communication). There was, in the mind of the author( s) of these two anomalous Meli-Sipak inscriptions, an identification made between the naru and the boundary or region it documented and protected. This identification is compelling, particularly in light of passages that equate survival of the naru with survival of the right to lay claim to the land, a point taken up below, in the discussion of function, Chapter Four. The conceptual relationship shared by 'boundary/territory enclosed by boundary', that is, kudurru, and 'the object that documents and ensures integrity of the boundary/territory enclosed by boundary' that is, naru, may have enabled the author( s) of these two inscriptions to refer to the artifacts with the term kudurru as well as with the term naru.
ANCIENT SETTING
Textual evidence
With the terminological difficulties clarified, textual evidence for the placement of the artifacts can be considered. As already mentioned, inscriptions that record the placement of the naru



56 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
consistently describe it as having been set up before the gods. For example, a passage from Meli-Sipak MDP X 87, cited above, Indicates that king set the nara before the goddess Nanayya:
Moreover, all that he gave to her he inscribed on a (stone) naru and placed in the presence of (divine) Nanayya, [x?] this? the sanctuary(?); he stood (it) there for the duration. (Meli-Sipak MDP X 87, ii 9-15)
Additional textual evidence includes the passage cited above according to which a clay nara had been set up before a god and in close proximity to a wall, pointing to a location within a temple:
At that time Kasagti-SU.GAB, son of Nusku-na'id inscribed a naru of clay, and stood (it) before his god. In the reign of Marduk-apla-iddina, king of the world, son of Meli-Sipak, king of Babylon, a wall collapsed upon the aforementioned naru and it was destroyed. (Nazi-Maruttas MDP II 86, Face IV (2.Medaillon) 1-6)
An object dated to the Isin II dynasty similarly reports that the recipient of a non-royal grant had set up a stone nara before "the great gods:"
NA4.NA.RU.A an-na-a .~a mdGu-la-URU4-d nO-ma i-na IGI-§u DINGIR.MES GAL.MES u-kin-nu
this (stone) naru, which Gula-eres fashioned and set up before the great gods... (Enlil-nadin-apli BBSt 11: ii 14-16)
An inscription from the reign of Nazi-Maruttas closes with a narration of the king manufacturing and setting up an object.



CHAPTER 2: DESIGNATION AND SETTING 57
Although the object is not named, the passage is included here because it provides evidence for placement of the artifact:
[Na]-zi-muru-taJ LUGAL KALAG.GA LUGAL URU KADINGIR.RAki [ib-]rim-ma ina BARA dGu-la [xC?)] fXl £fXl iJJkun 1

Archaeological evidence
In addition to the textual evidence, provenance of the artifacts recovered through controlled archaeological excavation also suggests the temple as their original setting. Information about the recovery of individual artifacts can be found conveniently in the catalogue of Seidl (1989: 19-66, and Nachtdige, 221-29), and is summarized in this study's Appendix 2. Of all known complete and fragmentary members of the corpus, including those whose inclusion is defended below in Chapter Six, 21 were found in the course of controlled archaeological excavation in Babylonia. Of these, 15 were found in temples, two were found in what were probably workshops, three were found built into later architectural constructions, and one was found in the ruins of a Neo-Babylonian residence. Not included in this reckoning are five artifacts and fragments in the British Museum that were probably, but not definitely, excavated from temples (see Appendix 2). But we should be aware of the possibility that the artifacts excavated in temples may, in fact, have been found in secondary contexts. Archaeological recovery of the stones found in Susa, however, also points toward Babylonian temples as their original setting. Toward the end of the Kassite Dynasty, the Elamite king Sutruk-NalJlJunte (1185-1155) launched a series of raids into northern Babylonia. According to his inscriptions, he struck a number of major cities, including Dfir-Kurigalzu, Sippar, Opis, and possibly also Akkad and Eshnunna (Carter and Stolper 1984: 40, with reference to Konig 1965: 82-83 (text 28 C I». The Elamite raiders removed from those cities temple furnishings,



58 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
statues, and monuments, including grand royal monuments such as the Law Stele of ijammurapi and the Victory Stele of NaramSfn, as well as a number of the artifacts studied here. Sutruk-Nabhunte went so far as to add his own inscriptions to several of these Babylonian treasures, and these secondary Elamite engravings tell of the fate of the objects after they were taken from Babylonia. In the lines inscribed on the Victory Stele of Naram-Sfn, for example, the Elamite king explained that "when Insusinak gave me the order, I struck down (the city) Sippar, took into possession the Stele of Naram-Sin, and removed it and brought it to Elam, (where) I set it up as an offering to Insusinak, my god." (MDP II 24, Elamite text, as transliterated and translated by Konig 1965: 76 (text 22».16 According to one reading of the Susa excavation records, many of the Mesopotamian trophies were found on an extensive pavement south of the temple of Insusinak (P. O. Harper 1992: 161). This area was excavated by de Morgan (MDP I), who dug a series of trenches south of the temple. The trenches came down upon foundation deposits and vaulted tombs as well as fallen columns and other architectural elements. Pavements and walls of this area were constructed using old building materials, some of which bore inscriptions of earlier, Middle Elamite kings, including Sutruk-Naggunte. The greatest number of the so-called kudurrus were found in the debris uncovered by Morgans's trenches in this area (Heim 1992: 124 and fig. 41, and personal communication). Although it can no longer be determined precisely where in Susa the Babylonian spoils were set up, the dedication to Insusinak is unambiguous. The secondary Elamite votive inscriptions, combined with the available archaeological evidence, point to a display location associated with the temple of Insusinak. Regardless of precisely where they were set up in their new Elamite home, these artifacts originally had most likely been standing in Babylonian temples or temple courtyards. Certainly one copy of the Law Stele of ijammurapi had stood in the Esagila Temple in Babylon (see Lij xlvii 59-78, after the edition of Roth 1997: 133-4). The critical point for this discussion is that the artifacts under investigation were found together with the larger



CHAPTER 2: DESIGNATION AND SETTING 59
monuments and royal sculptures taken from Babylonia to Susa. This suggests that they, too, had been removed from Babylonian temples. Oelb, Steinkeller, and Whiting (1991: 22-3) went so far as to propose that all the Babylonian trophies recovered in Susa had been removed specifically from the Ebabbar temple of Samas in Sippar. Moreover, as Seidl (1989: 73) argued in her iconographic study, it is inconceivable that Sutruk-Nauuunte's soldiers were out gathering boundary markers scattered throughout the fields of rural Babylonia. 17 Hence, we should posit central and public locations for the artifacts taken from Babylonia to Susa, and temples and associated temple courtyards and spaces are likely candidates. Additional points about the objects as artifacts can be raised in the context of archaeological provenance. Seidl (1989: 73) observed that only two members of the corpus could have been set into soil without obscuring the lower part of their text and/or their imagery. Many of the stones, at least those that did not experience a second career as grinding stones or door-sockets, are in remarkably fine condition. Their highly polished surfaces speak against the supposition that they could have been standing out of doors and subject to wind, sand, sun, and rain.
CONCLUSIONS
I. In the textual corpus under investigation, the Akkadian terms kudurru and naru are used consistently to designate two different and distinct entities. Akkadian kudurru, written NIO.DU or syllabically, signifies 'boundary', 'boundary marker', or 'territory enclosed by a boundary'. Akkadian naru, written (NA4.)NA(4).RU.A or syllabically, signifies '( stone) stele, (stone) monument'.
II. The artifacts under investigation were known to the ancient Babylonians as naru, '(stone) stele' or '(stone) monument', not as kudurru, 'boundary', 'boundary marker', or 'territory enclosed by a boundary'.



60 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
III. The artifacts under investigation were placed in temples, not outside marking field boundaries.
Whereas naru was used to designate the artifacts studied here, kudurru was used to signify a 'boundary' or 'boundary marker' located in the field. The two terms are consistently employed in mutually exclusive semantic environments, and only in two inscriptions, both attributed to the same king and recovered from the same site, is the term kudurru applied unambiguously to the artifact at hand. The exceptional use of kudurru 'boundary' or 'boundary marker' in place of naru '( stone) stele' in these inscriptions is undoubtedly connected to the function of the naru as that which protects the boundary and the territory it enclosed. The word naru is regularly written with the determinative NA4, indicating that unless otherwise indicated, as in the phrase naru Ja ba.ybi 'naru of clay', objects designated naru were made of stone. In contrast, there is no information in the texts about the material from which the kudurrus were fabricated. On the contrary, the word kudurru is never written with NA4, the determinative for objects made of stone, nor with any other determinative that might indicate the substance from which it was fashioned. Moreover, kudurru consistently occurs together with other words for 'boundary marker', 'border', 'boundary line' or "peg'. In one text, Merodach-baladan II VAS I 37, the kudurru is characterized as something that was subject to being 'driven' or 'pounded in'. In the inscriptions, individuals claim to have inscribed the narus, and the narus are reported to have been carved with divine names, curses, and royal and personal names. This is consistent with the inscriptions borne by the extant artifacts. In contrast, there is only one reference to an entity designated kudurru bearing any inscription, and this is found in one of the two exceptional occurrences in which the term kudurru was used to designate the artifact. In addition to divine names and curses, the inscriptions record that the narus were embellished with divine symbols. This characterization is consistent with the relief sculptures borne by the extant artifacts. In contrast, no kudurru is reported as bearing any Imagery.



CHAPTER 2: DESIGNATION AND SETTING 61
Imprecations occurring in almost every inscription detail the types of damage that if inflicted upon the kudurru and upon the nara will be met with divine wrath. According to the inscriptions, the perils that may befall kudurrus and the hazards that may endanger naras are, with the exception of one inscription, distinct from one another. Entities designated kudurru were subject to being uprooted, removed, or disturbed; in contrast, to harm a nara, one would smash it with a rock, throw it down a well, burn it in a fire, bury it in the dirt, erase its inscription, or remove it from its place before a god. The catalogue of potential damage to the nara is consistent with the artifacts under investigation; that is, they are the kind of injuries that could damage an inscribed and sculpted stone stele or monument. Moreover, imprecations against harming the nara hold a position of compositional prominence-they are consistently placed last in any series of imprecations, immediately before the divine curses. This positional prominence underscores the self-referential character of statements referring to the nara. According to many of the inscriptions, the artifacts were placed 'before the gods'; that is, within temples. Several of the inscriptions make specific note of the objects having been placed in the presence of the divine. Most of the artifacts that have been recovered through archaeological excavation in Babylonia have been found in ruins thought to have been houses of the gods. It is argued here that the artifacts recovered in Susa had likely been removed in antiquity from Babylonian temples. The foregoing discussion has attempted to reconstruct the ancient setting of the artifacts, first by determining their ancient designation and then by evaluating textual and archaeological evidence for their original placement. This is the first step toward determining the ancient function of the artifacts within the culture that created them and that constituted their audience. With the exception of two inscriptions, both dated to the same king and recovered from the same city, the artifacts under investigation were known to the Babylonians not as kudurrus 'boundary markers' but as naras '( stone) stelae' or '( stone) monuments'. Exceptions to this distinction may be accounted for by a perceived conceptual identity shared on the one hand between the borders and the



62 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
land they circumscribed and on the other with the inscribed and sculpted stone artifacts chronicling those borders. Textual and archaeological evidence points to the temple as the ancient setting of the artifacts. Such a provenance is consistent with the central role played by the Mesopotamian temple as a locus for economic activity from time immemorial, and therefore an appropriate location in which to have commemorated records dealing with land tenure and the other subjects documented by the inscriptions. It is to the subjects of the inscriptions that this study next turns.
lIt should be made clear that inscriptions are not the only criterion for dating the artifacts. Seidl (1989) has assigned all the monuments and fragments with reliefs known to 1989 to chronologically determined periods based on iconographic style. In fact, dating the artifact according to the ruler identified in the text may be less accurate than dating according to the style of the images. A case in point is Kudur-Enlil RA 66. Although Kudur-Enlil ruled from 1254-1246, the style of the relief of this artifact finds its closest affinities with members of the corpus dating to the first half of the eleventh century. It seems likely that the object was actually manufactured in the eleventh century, with its inscription hearkening back to a grant made two centuries previously. Seidl (1989: 225-6) draws an apt parallel between this artifact and the so-called Cruel/arm Monument, which bears an inscription purporting to commemorate a grant of privileges made to the Ebabbar by the Sargonic king Manistusu (ca. 2269-2255), although the monument itself was not fashioned until the sixth century. 2Collated; the expression is not otherwise attested in the corpus. 3Members of the cogms bearing inscriptions that have been deliberately effaced include Meli-Sipak MDP X 87 (see this study fig. 4 and Seidl 1989: 26 (no. 23) and pI. 11a); the surface of Marduk-nadin-alJlJe BBSt 7 with the relief of the figure of the king (King 1912: pI. LIV: note the traces of cuneiform signs on the ridge just below the three 'socles'; and LXIV: note the perspective of the ridge from the side and the difference in the surface depth that has been carved away); and an undated fragment on display in the Louvre, Sb 3226 (Hinke 1907: figs. 17-18). Kurigalzu II (1332-1308) BBSt 2 clearly has been re-inscribed. 4There are no compelling factors to support dating the object to one Kadasman-Enlil to the exclusion of the other; Kadasman-Enlil I reigned ca. 1374-1360, and Kadasman-Enlil II from 1263-1255 (see Brinkman 1976a: 136). 5ZLGA teba 'to rise' or tfbu 'uprising'; neither seems to make much sense in this context.

See CAD M/2, s.v. mulugu, and see also Westbrook 1994: 274-75. 7Expect -bat- instead of -bit-. Cf. Aro 1955: 40, where this form is cited as a D-preterite, although it occurs here as part of a sequence of Durative forms. 8King confirmed this reading, King 1912: 17, n. 5.

Cf. CAD A/2's proposed reading, s.v. aqaru 3c: ",~a ...

16Note that P. O. Harper's assertion (1992: 161), that Sutruk-Nabbunte "expressly states that he 'protected the monument' ," is not supported by the text. 17Gelb, Steinkeller, and Whiting put forth the same argument in their study (1991: 21-2). Similarly, a fragment from the corpus under investigation found at Assur (Adad-apla-iddina AoF l3; see Seidl 1989: 54, Nr. 92) probably had been taken there by Assyrians as a Babylonian trophy.



Chapter Three
The Inscriptions: Subject and Structure
The artifacts under investigation exhibit a strong formal unity in appearance. Shared physical features-a smooth polished surface, irregular stele shape, prominent divine symbols carved in relief, archaizing cuneiform inscription-have long been the primary criteria employed uncritically in treating the artifacts as a single artifactual genre. Uniformity is likewise the immediately striking feature of the artifacts' inscriptions. This uniformity has led to the labeling of the texts as formulaic, and has resulted in the incomplete publication of several inscriptions on the grounds that they added nothing new to our knowledge; see, for example, Scheil's edition
of only a few lines from the 60-plus line inscription of Meli
v1
Sipak MDP II 112. But although commonly understood as records of royal or "feudal" land grants, the inscriptions of the artifacts do, in fact, document a variety of subjects. While the majority of the inscriptions record the granting of land by the king, in some the king plays no role whatsoever. A few texts document a grant or gift of land made by persons other than the king, and still others record the purchase of land by nonroyal persons. A handful of inscriptions are not at all concerned with land and its acquisition, but with the allocation of temple sinecures, and a few more chronicle the granting of exemptions on taxes and labor. Still others have nothing to do with landed property, temple prebends, or exemptions, but with the settlement of a legal dispute-in some cases a dispute originating over rival
65



66 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
land claims, but in one case an altercation arising over the killing of another man's slave. Nonetheless, all these different events were commemorated using the same type of artifact inscribed with the same kind of text. Rather than dismissing their apparent similarity as uninformative, this study interprets their visual and textual formal uniformity as a manifestation of the functional unity shared by all members of the corpus. The commonplace understanding of the artifacts as comemmorating "feudal land grants" was expanded by Brinkman (1980-83: 269) in the RLA, where he summarized them as "relating principally to land ownership or associated tax exemptions." It is desirable, however, at this point, to refine our understanding of the so-called "Babylonian kudurrus" even further. This chapter investigates their inscriptions, determines that their apparent formal likeness is real, and then uses this uniformity as the basis for comparing the various subjects documented. By demonstrating that the different subjects were perceived as analogous by the Babylonians, this analysis will lead to a functional interpretation of the artifacts that is valid for the every member of the collection. Beginning with the most common subject, royal land grants, each type of inscription first will be broken down into its component parts or compositional units. This enables comparison of long and short inscriptions: regardless of the actual number of lines, each of the inscriptions can be tested to see whether it exhibits the same structure. These structures can then be compared to determine the extent to which the different subjects commemorated by these artifacts were perceived by the Babylonians as functionally alike.
Overview of the inscriptions
Two circumstances encumber analyzing the whole corpus of inscriptions. The first is sheer size. Just over 100 of the 160 surviving artifacts and fragments that traditionally are considered part of the corpus bear some kind of inscription. To enable evaluation of chronological developments, the following analysis will consider only datable inscriptions. Included in this reckoning are



CHAPTER 3: INSCRIPTIONS: SUBJECT AND STRUCTURE 67
three artifacts whose membership in the corpus has been contested, Kadasman-Enlil BBSt 1, Meli-Sipak MDP IV 163, and Nabu-apla-iddina BBSt 36, also known as the Sippar Samas Tablet. These artifacts are investigated and their status vis-a.-vis the corpus is defended below in Chapter Six, along with a fourth artifact, Samas-suma-ukln AIO 16, which has not yet been considered in the context of the so-called kudurrus. Thus, 63 extant datable artifacts are investigated here, and these are listed below in Appendix 1. Additionally, two datable artifacts that have been only partially published, Meli-Sipak MDP II 112 and N abfi-aplaiddina Louvre AO 21422, currently in preparation for separate publication, are included in that tabulation. Also listed is one unpublished artifact dated to Adad-apla-iddina and currently held in a private collection.2 The following four terms are used to describe the states of preservation exhibited by the inscriptions:
'complete'-missing nothing, or only parts of few lines that can be restored confidently;
'confidently restorable'-missing whole lines or parts of lines, but inscriptional components are clearly recognizable and the restoration is reliable;
'conjecturally restorable'-although mIssIng substantial sections of the text, the surviving inscription and parallels from other inscriptions enable a likely restoration;
'fragmentary'-enough of the artifact and inscription is preserved to include it in the corpus, but the inscription is too damaged for serious argument about what could be restored.
Of the 63 datable inscriptions listed in Appendix 1, 55 are complete or can be restored with confidence. All told, the resultant "working corpus" of datable inscriptions totals close to 5,000 lines of Akkadian text. The second difficulty is the range of inscription length. Complete or confidently restorable inscriptions run from 23 to



68 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
390 lines. This raises the question of how to compare meaningfully an inscription of fewer than 30 lines with another reaching close to 400. The approach taken here is to first divide the inscriptions into a typology according to subject. Thereafter, each type of inscription is broken down into its constituent parts and analyzed for structure. The structure of the inscriptions can be compared regardless of individual inscription length.
SUBJECT TYPOLOGY OF THE INSCRIPTIONS
Appendix 3 lists a total of 55 artifacts according to the subject of their inscriptions. This reckoning includes 48 complete and confidently restorable plus seven conjecturally restorable inscriptions. The inscriptions can be said to record certain events, i.e., a royal grant of land, prebend, or tax and labor exemptions, a royal adjudication, a non-royal gift of land or prebend, or purchase of land. The 55 inscriptions can be broken down by subject, that is, event, as follows:
30 Royal grants of land (and associated exemptions and prebends) 24 complete/confidently restorable 6 conjecturally restorable
6 Non-royal purchases of land
5 Royal adjudications 4 complete/confidently restorable 1 conjecturally restorable
4 Royal affirmations of previously held land
3 Royal grants of prebend only
3 Royal grants of exemptions only
3 Non-royal gifts of land
Non-royal gift of prebend
MUltiple royal and non-royal events (Nabfi-mukln-apli BBSt 9)



CHAPTER 3: INSCRIPTIONS: SUBJECT AND STRUCTURE 69
An inscription is assigned to a category according to its primary event, e.g., a grant of land plus exemptions is listed under the heading of a land grant, as the granting of the land itself must be considered primary to the granting of exemptions on that land. Similarly, a text that documents affirmation of previously granted land is listed under affirmations, as the affirmation is the critical final event leading to the execution of the naru. The king is most often responsible for effecting the event recorded in the inscriptions. Such 'royal events' date throughout the chronological span of the corpus, that is, from the 14th through 7th centuries. Of the 55 datable inscriptions in which the event commemorated is preserved, the king is the major player in 45, that is, four-fifths or 80 percent of the events. Within this group, the most common transaction is the granting by the king of eqiu, a 'field' or multiple fields. This type of event is followed in frequency by the king granting a combination of field (s) and temple prebend( s), or field and tax and/or labor exemptions, or field, temple prebend, and exemptions. Next in frequency are six royal adjudications in which the king hears and resolves a dispute. Three inscriptions document that the king granted exemptions only, and three record only the granting of a temple sinecure as the single event commemorated. Ten inscriptions, that is, approximately one-fifth or 20 percent of the corpus, chronicle an event effected by an agent other than the king. These date from the reign of Enlil-nadin-apli to Sargon II, thus not earlier than 1103 and not later than 705. Six inscriptions report land and house purchases by non-royal persons, three document grants of land by non-royal persons. One inscription, that of Marduk-zakir-sumi VAS I 35, records two apparently unrelated events, a non-royal gift and a non-royal purchase of land; it is included here under both headings. One text commemorates the grant by two divinities of a prebend to their temple. A final inscription, that of Nabfi-mukln-apli BBSt 9, chronicles many different types of events and is listed in its own category.



70 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
Royal grants of land (eqlu)
Royal land grants date from the reign of Kurigalzu I (first quarter of the 14th c.) or II (1332-1308) to the reign of Samassuma-ukln (667-648). Thus, royal land grants, 30 in number, are the subject of more than half the corpus, and are attested throughout the entire life span of these artifacts. Two inscriptions are presented here for structural analysis. These are the two earliest complete or confidently restorable inscriptions that commemorate a royal land grant. To be sure, the earliest inscription identifiable as a royal grant, Kurigalzu BBSt 2, dates to the reign of a Kurigalzu (Kurigalzu I reigned in the fifteenth century and Kurigalzu II from 1332-1308), but the inscription appears to be unfinished, compromising its usefulness for structural analysis. The first text presented here dates from the reign of Nazi-Maruttas (1307-1282), and the second to MeliSipak (1186-1172). Both are inscribed on narus that were recovered in the course of controlled archaeological excavation. The two inscriptions are presented here in transliteration and translation with philological notes kept to a minimum? Lineation follows the original published editions, and the English translation keeps to a line-to-line correspondence as much as possible.
Nazi-Maruttas RA 66
The naru was excavated in 1970 in Larsa, in a side room of a chapel of the Ebabbar, temple dedicated to the sun-god Samas, together with a naru dating to the reign of Kudur-Enlil (KudurEnlil RA 66) and an undatable fragment from one other. For photographs of the artifact and account of its excavation, see Margueron 1972; for a cuneiform copy and edition of the inscription, see Arnaud 1972.

Name (of the naru)
Full description of the first bestowal: dimensions and location of a field and details of a prebend of the Ebabbar temple in Larsa
Account of the first event: King Burnaburias granted the aforementioned field and prebend to Puzru, and "brought him near the Ebabbar," presumably conferring upon him the status of an erih hW, literally, 'one who enters the temple'
Full description of the second bestowal: dimensions and locations of four fields (presumably including the orchard mentioned in line 1) and details of a prebend in the temple of BeletiII
Account of the second event: Nazi-Maruttas granted the aforementioned fields and prebend to Puzru, and exempted him from work obligations and tax on livestock (relating presumably to the granted land)
Prohibitions against violation of the grant
Divine curses that will afflict a person who would transgress the prohibitions set out in 29-35

Meli-Sipak BBSt 4
The second inscription dates to the reign of a later king of the Kassite Dynasty and was recovered from a different city. MeliSipak BBSt 4 was excavated in Sippar, room 50 of the temple of Samas, together with two other members of the corpus, Nebuchadnezzar I BBSt 6, the Sitti-Marduk "kudurru," and Nabumukln-apll BBSt 9 (Walker and Collon 1980: plan 3). Meli-Sipak BBSt 4 was on display and could not be removed in the spring of 1996 when I made collations in the British Museum. For signs that are not clear on the published photos (King 1912: pIs. XXIII-XXX), I have followed King's readings, which, in the case of inscriptions I was able to collate, have proven to be almost unerringly correct.

Commentary
Title 1 For discussion of the exceptional use of the word kudurru in this inscription, see above, Chapter Two, pp. 37-9.
B 1 i-n[a] DIS-u u IM.DUB. The expression DIS-u occurs three times in the datable corpus: once in this text and twice in in a passage from Merodach-baladan I MDP VI 31, iii 11-16:
DIs-a if !up-pi A.sA ka-nik di-ni ik-nu-uk-ma a-na mMu-un-na-hit-tu id-di-in i-na ka-na-ak DIs-a if !up-pi A.sA

The CAD reads DIS-u as lix (DIS )-u for 'writing board' and translates
"document (reading uncertain)" (CAD L, s.v. le 'u bl '). Note, however, that the AHw includes none of these passages under the entry Ie )u. The reading !ix-a for



CHAPTER 3: INSCRIPTIONS: SUBJECT AND STRUCTURE 79
DIS-u has been challenged by Borger; see AbZ n. 480, and Borger 1956: 31, where he argues against a value fix for DIS.
Piotr Steinkeller has suggested that this is a writing for Akkadian gistu 'wooden writing tablet', a loan word from Sumerian GISDA (see CAD G, s.·v. gi#u and AHw 1, S.v. gisru), thus to be read GESTA-u (personal communication). For a phonetic value /ge'Stal for DIS, see Steinkeller 1979. Steinkeller' s value Igdtal for DIS was accepted by Borger, AbZ, 433 (Supplement 1980). However, the occurrences of DIS-it in the inscriptions under investigation, as in the passage cited just above, require it to be in the oblique case, and it is unlikely that the oblique case would be indicated with the writing -it. (For examples of geJru written syllabically ge,~-ru-u (SB only), see the CAD and AHw entries cited above.) Although its precise reading at present remains uncertain, DIS-u clearly signifies something written upon and sealed, and a wooden writing board seems the most likely object. B 6 King: the photo indicates LV.SAG for ,~a reH B 9 King 1912: 21, n. 9, and pI. XXV. The context calls for a title. C 8 Expect ittablu. D 14 See CAD K, s.v. kala 5 "May he have a bad end."
The text can be summarized as follows:
Name
Description of the bestowal: dimensions and location of a field
Account of the event: that which Meli-Sipak granted to ijasardu (subordinate clause),
Four officials measured and affirmed to ijusardu (main clause)
Eight persons, some of them high-ranking officials, are listed as witnesses to the sealing. (For a discussion of sealing, see the section Sealing and the Durability of Entitlement, below, in Chapter Four.)

Comparison of these two inscriptions with others recording a royal land grant yields the following list of compositional elements: name of the nara description of a bestowal (e.g., size and location of fields)



80 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
narrative of the background of the bestowal paean to god or king who grants the bestowal statement of grant event (e.g., RN granted to PN) account of surveying the land account of sealing and list of witnesses prohibitions and/or positive injunctions curses and/or blessings date colophon (e.g., PN fashioned and set up the naru)
This list accounts for all of the compositional elements found in inscriptions documenting a royal grant of land. Not every component is present in every inscription; for example, no narrative occurs in either of the inscriptions reviewed above. For the most part, elements occur in the order in which they are listed. Variations are minor; for example, in a few inscriptions, the name of the naru occurs at the end rather than the beginning, or at the beginning and then repeated at the end. There is also flexibility in the placement of the list of witnesses, account of the sealing, and the date. Although the vast majority of inscriptions contain only prohibitions and curses, one, Meli-Sipak MDP II 99, includes both positive and negative injunctions and, correspondingly, blessings as well as curses, while another, Marduk-sapik-zeri Sumer 36, includes both blessings and curses. In addition to the uniformity displayed by the overall structure of inscriptions, the articulation of individual compositional elements shows remarkable conformity from inscription to inscription. The sequence and language of individual units are sufficiently regular that in cases of fragmentary texts, even if there are only a few signs with which to work, the structure of broken passages often can be confidently restored. There is a marked difference in language and tone between the "business" elements of the inscription, in which information about the bestowal and its granting is communicated, and the "protective" elements, the prohibitions and curses that seek to ensure its inviolability. In considering the structure of the inscriptions, Brinkman (1980-83: 268) discerned two "principal parts": "the narrative (description of the legally binding act and its back



CHAPTER 3: INSCRIPTIONS: SUBJECT AND STRUCTURE 81
ground) and the imprecation (invocation of divine curses and transgressors-persons contravening the legal act or defiling the kudurru itself)." In the first text presented above, Nazi-Maruttas RA 66, Brinkman's first principal part corresponds to lines 2-28 and the second to lines 29-47'. Meli-Sipak BBSt 4 also exhibits the two principal divisions: the "narrative" corresponding to A I-B 11, and the "imprecation" corresponding to B 12-C 14. The two-part structure, however, fails to provide a means to account for two elements of the Nazi-Maruttas inscription, the name of the artifact-a feature also present in Meli-Sipak BBSt 4-and the concluding passage that relates its creation and installation. Similarly, the bipartite division fails to provide adequate terminology to include compositional elements present in the Meli-Sipak text but not included in the Nazi-Maruttas inscription, namely, a list of officials who survey and affirm the land granted by the king and a list of witnesses present when the clay tablet first recording the grant event was sealed. While not part of every inscription, these components do occur in a significant number, and their presence or absence is critical for making comparisons within the corpus. Hence, this study modifies the bipartite scheme proposed by Brinkman with the addition of a "Heading" and "Closing" division and by breaking down the resultant four divisions into their constituent elements. Because some inscriptions do contain an actual "narrative," that is, a narrated account or story, this study employs the label "operative division" in place of Brinkman's designation "narrative." The term "operative" is taken from its use in categorizing the analogous section of Mesopotamian sale documents (for which see the discussion of Steinkeller 1989: 8-29, and n. 21). This study follows Brinkman (1980-83: 269) in reasoning that this part of the text was most likely "based on a sealed legal document written on clay" (see also the discussion in Chapter Four: Sealing and Durability of Entitlement). The second principal part, termed in this study the "imprecative division," consists of two clearly defined sections: prohibitions and curses. The date is most often found toward the end of the inscription, as an element of the closing, although is some texts it closes the operative division, following the account of sealing and witnesses.



82 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
These elaborations yield the following structure for the land grant inscriptions:
Heading name (of the naru) Operative division description of the land narrative and/or paean statement of the bestowal of the land account of surveying the land account of sealing and witnesses Imprecative division prohibitions/positive injunctions curses/negative injunctions Closing date colophon
Royal grants of temple prebend (isqu)
Six of the naru inscriptions record that the king granted isqu, a 'share', in the regular income of a temple, that is, an on-going sinecure or prebend. Nazi-Maruttas RA 66, cited in full above, documents the simultaneous granting of land and sinecures; Marduk-zakir-sumi RA 16 chronicles the granting of houses in addition to fields and a temple sinecure. Three inscriptions, N abOapla-iddina BBSt 36, the Sippar Sama§ Tablet (whose inclusion in the corpus is defended below in Chapter Six), Merodachbaladan II BBSt 35, and Samas-suma-ukln AnOr 12, commemorate the granting of prebends alone. Grants of sinecure are thus documented throughout the era of the artifacts, with the bestowal of prebends alone attested from the early 9th c. until the discontinuation of the genre. Of the three inscriptions that recount the granting of a sinecure alone, the best preserved, Nabfi-aplaiddina BBSt 36, is treated in depth in Chapter Six (Artifact C). Samas-suma-ukln AnOr12, can be summarized as follows:

With exception of the account of land surveying, an element that would not apply to a temple prebend, the texts of the royal prebend grants exhibit a structure virtually identical to that of the royal land grants. Note that in the inscription summarized above, the imprecative division is much shorter than in two royal land grant texts cited in full earlier in this chapter, and that the imprecative division, inserted after the account of the sealing and before the account of witnesses, in effect interrupts the operative division. This de-emphasizing of the imprecative division may be a function of its late date (see Conclusions to this chapter, below). The structure of the royal prebend grant texts can be sketched as follows:
Heading name (of the naru) Operative division narrative and/or paean description of the prebend statement of the bestowal of the prebend account of sealing and witnesses Imprecative division prohibitions curses Closing date colophon



84 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
Royal exemptions (zakfitu)
Five inscriptions record the granting of zaktltu 'exemptions'. Two inscriptions of Meli-Sipak record very large land grants to his children, one to his son and eventual successor, Merodachbaladan I, and one to his daughter, ijunnubat-Nanayya, a princess likely associated with the temple of Nanayya (see Chapter Two, above, for discussion). These inscriptions record the simultaneous granting of land along with settlements and exemptions. Kudur-Enlil RA 66 records that King Kudur-Enlil affirmed a land grant previously made by Kadasman-Enlil and furthermore granted exemptions (uzakki) on the land. In the case of multiple consecutive events recorded in a single inscription, the inscription should be categorized according to the final event, as that is the event leading to the execution and erection of the nartl. This reasoning is supported by the imprecation division of Kudur-Enlil RA 66, for example, in which the prohibitions are all aimed specifically against violating the exemptions rather than against taking away the land. The account of Kadasman-Enlil's granting land must therefore be considered a narrative leading up to the main event recorded, the conferring of exemptions. Nebuchadnezzar I BBSt 6, the Sitti-Marduk "kudurru," and Marduk-nadin-agge BBSt 25 commemorate only the bestowal of exemptions without mention of a land grant. The inscriptions that commemorate the granting of exemptions exhibit the following compositional features:
Heading name (of the nartl) Operative division narrative description of the exemptions statement of the granting of exemptions (zaktltu) account of sealing and witnesses Imprecative division prohibitions curses Closing date



CHAPTER 3: INSCRIPTIONS: SUBJECT AND STRUCTURE 85
colophon
Insofar as it is represented by these three examples, the structure of the zakutu inscriptions shares most of the same features and in the same order as the royal grants of land and prebend. Yet, as outlined above, the structure of the zakutu inscriptions does diverge from that of the royal land grant in three significant ways. The first deviation is the absence of a statement about surveying officials. It may seem obvious that we would not find mention of surveyors in a text not concerned with the transference of land. The absence of this compositional element does, however, underscore that the right of the zakutu beneficiary to use or control the land being exempted was an established and accepted fact requiring no additional affirmation. The second structural difference is the lack in one text, Marduk-nadin-abJ}c BBSt 25, of prohibitions and divine curses-the absence, that is, of the entire imprecative division. Want of the imprecative division may not be related to the subject of the inscription, however, but rather to the shape of the artifact, which is a tablet-shaped stone without relief sculptures. This phenomenon will be explored below in this chapter in the discussion of the Non-royal land purchase texts and in Chapter Six, in the discussion following Artifact D. The third alteration from the structure of the royal grants is the absence from one of the zakutu-texts, Kudur-Enlil RA 66, of a description of the exemptions, a feature that is structurally analogous to the description of land in the royal grants of eqlu and description of the prebend in the royal grants of isqu. In his conclusion to a detailed study of zakutu based on these inscriptions, Kraus raised the question of whether specific exemptions mentioned in the course of the inscription were those to which the beneficiary was limited, or whether they were metonymically illustrative of a standard body of exemptions that need not be individually enumerated. Although Kraus (1968: 33) left the question unanswered,s the use of uzakki without enumeration of specific exemptions in Kudur-Enlil RA 66-published in 1972 and so not available to Kraus at the time of his study-can



86 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
be cited in support of the latter alternative, that when zakatuprivileges were commemorated by a nara, a given set of exemptions could be understood without their being individually detailed. Similarly, in Nebuchadnezzar I, the Hinke "kudurru," exemptions are alluded to in the prohibition section without their
having been mentioned in the operative division at all.6 If zakatuprerogatives constituted a known and standard set of privileges, description of specific exemptions could be considered redundant, and thus their absence from the text of Kudur-Enlil RA 66 would not constitute a major divergence from the structure of the inscriptions thus far reviewed.
Royal adjudications
Five inscriptions fall under the category of royal adjudications, and these date from the reign of Meli-Sipak (1186-1172) to the reign of Adad-apla-iddina (1068-1047), the latest text being badly damaged. These inscriptions record different kinds of disputes, some of which include multiple generations of participants and most extend over the reigns of several kings. The texts do not lend themselves readily to being reduced to a single structure. Two of the inscriptions are too broken to contribute to a structural analysis, although they do preserve sufficient textual
characteristics to merit their inclusion in this category.7 A sixth text, NabO-mukln-apli BBSt 9, begins with a royal adjudication, but goes on to record a non-royal grant of land and other transactions that cannot be interpreted with certainty. The earliest adjudication text is dated to the reign of MeliSipak. In this inscription, Meli-Sipak BBSt 3, the dispute centers on the estate of a man who died without a recognized heir. The inscription can be summarized as follows:
King Adad-suma-iddina gave a property left intestate to Ur-Belet-muballi{at-mHi, bora-priest
When Ur-Belet-muballitat-mHi's claim was challenged, he appealed to the king

Note that a full description of the land that changes hands-a compositional element we have come to expect at the beginning of an inscription-is not provided until far into the text, at lines iii 40-iv 4. I believe that the field description occurs late in the text because it is not until that point in the narrative, with the restoration of a field previously alienated from the estate, that the land under dispute can be described according to its full territorial extent. The placement of the field description can be seen as signaling the critical final event of the narrative: the latest challenge to Ur-Belet-muballitat-mlti's title to the estate and Meli-Sipak's decision in favor of his claim as represented by his son. All of lines i I-v 26 therefore constitute a long and complicated single narrative providing background to the crucial ultimate event leading up to the execution and erection of the naru. It should also be noted that the passages relating different episodes of the



88 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
narrative are joined by enclitic -rna, indicating their connected and consecutive relationship. Thus, the operative division of the text consists of an extremely long narrative tracing the legal decisions of three consecutive kings, leading to a description of the whole parcel of land, and a statement that it was sealed by the king and bestowed upon the recipient. The next adjudication text chronologically is the shortest complete text of this type. The inscription of Enlil-nadin-apli BE III 83, cited in full above in Chapter Two, pp. 48-50, can be summarized as follows:
Narrative:
Gulkisar, king of the Sealand (reckoned at some 696 years before the reign Nebuchadnezzar I) delimited (field) borders for the goddess Nanse (i.e., for the temple of Nanse)
In the reign of Enlil-nadin-apli, son and successor of Nebuchadnezzar I, the Jakin mati of BIt-Sin-magir, of the province of the Sealand, appropriated part of the land and he "returned it to the province"
The ,~anga-priest of the temple of Narnma and Nanse appealed to king Enlil-nadin-apli
Enlil-nadin-apli investigated and restored the land to its former boundaries, i.e., to the temple holdings

The other three adjudication texts fall somewhere between these two in terms of length and complexity. One adjudication inscription, Marduk-nadin-alJlJe Sumer 38, includes a list of witnesses to the sealing of the king's decision, followed by the date, which in turn is followed by prohibitions marking the beginning
of the imprecative division. Enlil-nadin-apli BE III 83, summarized just above, is the only text of the corpus in which the anticipated (negative) prohibitions and curses of the imprecative division have been replaced by (positive) injunctions and blessings.8



CHAPTER 3: INSCRIPTIONS: SUBJECT AND STRUCTURE 89
When the adjudication texts are compared to the other inscriptions, we see that they maintain the overall structure already outlined, but that the operative division is less easily compartmentalized into its now familiar compositional units. Nevertheless, the elements of the operative division do appear to be consonant within the adjudication texts: a narrative providing background to the dispute, a description of (contested) land, an appeal to the king, a royal investigation, and the resulting royal judgment. The structure of the adjudication texts can be sketched as follows:
Heading name (of the naru) Operative division narrative appeal to the king royal investigation and judgment account of witnesses and sealing date Imprecative division prohibitions and/or positive injunctions curses and/or blessings Closing colophon
In place of a narrative about why the grant was made, the adjudication inscription supplies an account of the circumstances leading to the dispute. Although different in content, the function of the narrative is the same: to explain how the event commemorated by the naru came to take place. Likewise, the positive injunctions and the divine blessings fill the same position in the structure of the text as do imprecations and divine curses. Moreover, they perform the same function: to ensure that the particulars specified by the naru inscription are honored and not violated in the future.
Royal affirmations or restorations of previously held land
Three members of the corpus, including Kadasman-Enlil BBSt 1, whose inclusion here is defended below, in Chapter Six



90 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
(Artifact A), record the restoration of land to an individual outside the context of resolving a dispute. Although all three inscriptions are damaged, surviving passages exhibit features recognizable from both the royal land grants and the royal adjudications, and the nature of the damaged compositional features can be surmised with some confidence. Including Kadasman-Enlil BBSt 1, this type of event is recorded throughout the whole life span of the artifacts. The inscriptions attributed to this category, however, are not easily commingled to achieve a single structure. Kadasman-Enlil BBSt 1, the only member of the corpus made of clay and existing in duplicate, is perhaps only 12 lines long, On the other hand, NabQ-apla-iddina BBSt 28 is 27 lines long, and Samas-suma-ukin BBSt 10, allowing for its broken beginning, probably reached close to 90 lines. Moreover, each inscriptions exhibits different individual compositional features. Putting BBSt 1 aside for the moment, the discrepancies between the two remaining texts may be connected to differences in the physical configuration of the two narus. The two artifacts present quite different appearances: NabQ-apla-iddina BBSt 28 is a small, tablet-shaped stone (17.5 x 1l.5 cm) and Samas-sumaukln BBSt 10 (36 x 23 cm) is a considerably larger, upright, flattened stele. As will be discussed below, there may be a correlation between the physical form of the naru and the structure of its inscription. For the sake of comparison with the other types of inscriptions, the majority of which occur on stele-shaped narus, a summary of the text of Samas-suma-ukln BBSt 10 is presented here as representative of inscriptions commemorating a royal restoration of land. The text chronicles an event whereby Esarhaddon (680-669) restored land to an individual; subsequently Samassuma-ukln (667-648) affirmed that restoration of land to the son of that (presumably deceased) individual:
Paean to King [Samas-suma-uklnf obv.1-30



CHAPTER 3: INSCRIPTIONS: SUBJECT AND STRUCTURE

While featuring a number of compositional elements common to both royal land grants and adjudications, the ordering of the individual elements in this text requires some comment. As in the adjudication text Meli-Sipak BBSt 3, summarized above, the full description of the land does not occur until relatively late in the inscription, and its placement is significant. Similar to BBSt 3, the description of the land follows immediately the critical final event of the narrative: here, the procurement of a tablet impressed with a royal seal validating the petitioner's claim. In the other inscriptions reviewed thus far, the account of the sealing occurs in the operative division, i.e., before the prohibitions and curses of the imprecative division. Note that the length of the imprecative division in this text is quite short compared to the other naru texts-the divine curses occupy only three lines. The witnesses and the date come at the very end of the text, following the imprecative division, and close the inscription. This order more closely parallels that of legal documents inscribed on clay tablets rather than other inscriptions of the naru corpus.



92 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
Non-royal land purchases
Inscriptions commemorating the purchase of land date from the reign of Itti-Marduk-baHitu (1139-1132) to Samas-sumauk"in (667-648), including Samas-suma-ukln AID 16, an artifact whose inclusion in the corpus is defended below in Chapter Six (Artifact D). Four of the six land purchase texts are inscribed on tabletshaped members of the corpus and two are on stelae. The structure of the inscriptions on the former differs from the structure of the inscriptions on the latter. Two of the tablet-shaped naru inscriptions are badly damaged. Marduk-nadin-alJlJe YDS I 37 is included here as a sale text because the preserved part of the inscription records a list of commodities, which most likely represents a purchase price, and a partial list of witnesses. No description of land and none of the expressions associated with purchases are preserved. The beginning of Simbar-Sipak BBSt 27 has to do with three sons, perhaps being apprenticed, but thereafter is badly broken. Although no field description is preserved, the text is categorized here as a land purchase based on rev. 11-12:
,~a ii-lam-ma i-na UGU A.sA ,~u-aJtu' [u,~adbubu]
in-nu-u i-paq-qa-ru A.sA ul na-din-ma KUG.BABBAR ul rmaUbi'r [i]rqab'Jbu'-u
who should rise up and [should litigate] on behalf of the aforementioned field, should deny (the sale), should have a claim, should say, "the field was not sold; silver was not received."
It is difficult to discern if there is a relationship between the first part of the inscription and the land purchase that follows. The best preserved land purchase text inscribed on a tabletshaped stone is Marduk-zakir-sumi VAS I 35.10 The object bears accounts of two independent events, one a non-royal grant and the other a purchase of a field. Each account begins with the expression: !uppi sa "Tablet of," but this is more likely copied from the clay tablets upon which the transactions were originally recorded rather than a reference to the shape of the stone artifact. No other inscription begins with this expression, although Kudur

Enlil RA 66 opens with the phrase NA4.KISIB A.sA.MES u za
ku-ti sa PN "Sealed document of fields and exemptions of PN." (Problems raised by the notion of sealing a stone artifact are addressed below, Chapter Four, in the section Sealing (stone) " ?)
narus. The field purchase portion of the inscription of Mardukzakir-sumi VAS I 35 (rev. 6-29, or lines 32-55 in the original VAS I publication) can be summarized as follows:

Itti-Marduk-balaw BBSt 30 includes a statement that PN1 purchased a field from PN2 after the description of the field. Observation of the two damaged inscriptions reveals the same structure with a few variations. None of the four land purchase inscriptions on tablet-shaped stones includes divine curses. Samas-suma-ukln AIO 16 records a house purchase that also included seven date palms. It is exceptional as the only purchase text inscribed on a tablet-shaped stone that includes divine curses (see treatment of this artifact, below, Chapter 6, Artifact D). In sum, the structure of the land purchase inscriptions on tablet-shaped stones is as follows:
Heading summary of the purchase Operative division description of the field purchase price statement of the purchase



94 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
statement of satisfaction sealing and witnesses Imprecative division monetary/legal penalties for challenging the sale divine curses (rare) Closing date seal of the seller
The two stelae, Marduk-nadin-alJlJe BBSt 7 and Sargon II VAS I 70, are well preserved. Their inscriptions exhibit markedly different structures. The earlier of the two, Marduk-nadin-alJlJe BBSt 7, can be summarized as follows:

When compared to the royal land grants, the only feature lacking is a narrative (to explain the reason for the grant) or paean (to a god or to the king who made the bestowal). On reflection, this variation is to be expected: no narrative explanation is necessary when land is bought and sold, and no divine or royal paean would be appropriate in commemorating a transaction involving neither god nor king. Discounting the absence of the narrative and paean, the structure of the land purchase text inscribed on stelae is similar to those already reviewed. The character of the prohibitions and curses of the imprecative division is indistinguishable from those found in the land grants and other types of events. The prohibitions list a variety of imaginable injuries to the



CHAPTER 3: INSCRIPTIONS: SUBJECT AND STRUCTURE 95
land purchased or to the naru recording the transaction, and the curses call upon the gods to inflict a transgressor with all kinds of misfortune. One remarkable prohibition of Marduk-nadin-alJlJe BBSt 7 seeks to forestall '( someone) who would say, "the fields are not a gift of the king'" A.sA.MES ul niditti LUGAL-ma iqabbu (ii 7). This statement is aimed at preventing someone from denying the validity of the sale by denying that the land was a gift of the king. Because the event recorded is unambiguously a purchase of land, however, such a statement is unexpected, and its occurrence in this text may refer to the way the field came under the control of the seller prior to the sale commemorated by the naru. This may in turn infer that land given by the king was alienable, and, accordingly, that land not given by the king was not. This hypothesis, stemming from an observation of Piotr Steinkeller (personal communication), has significant implications and cannot be proven without additional corroborating data. If land given by the king (and perhaps only land given by the king), was eligible to be bought and sold, then consequently the recipient of a royal grant would be uniquely privileged in his ability to dispose of the land according to his will and without royal interference. This notion is consonant with an idea promoted below, that a grant commemorated by a naru was intended to be a permanent transfer, and as such, the property could be held, passed down through heirs, exchanged, gifted, or sold according exclusively to the will of the individual who had received it. The structure then, of the text of Marduk-nadin-alJlJe BBSt 7, a record of purchase on a stele-shaped naru, is as follows:
Heading name (of the naru) Operative division description of the land purchase price surveying of the field statement of purchase statement of satisfaction



96 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
Imprecative division prohibitions curses Closing name (of the nara)
The structure of the second land purchase text inscribed upon a stele-shaped nara, Sargon II VAS I 70, is not paralleled elsewhere in the corpus. This nara commemorates one man's accumulation of six different pieces of property over a 17-year period (reckoned from the second year of Salmaneser to the eleventh year of Sargon II i.e., 726-710). The properties accumulated by Nabu-da in the six events are diverse-fields, orchards, decrepit houses and houses presumably in good condition-and were acquired variously through exchange, purchase, and debt settlement. The five-column inscription is relatively long, 164 lines, and its structure is unique:
First event: in year three of Salmaneser, king of Assyria, Nabuda exchanged houses with Ina-eSI-e!ir. Nabu-da also gave a compensatory payment of silver to Ina-eSI-etir

In this inscription, conclusion of each of the six events is signaled by reference either to sealing or to a clause of no contest. The text shares characteristics of land purchase texts inscribed on both tablet-shaped stones and on stelae. Like the purchase inscriptions on tablet-shaped stones, the prohibitions are restricted to threats against the validity of the sale. In the first event, a monetary fine is stipulated as the penalty for posing such a challenge (ii 5), a feature that appears also in the tablet-shaped sale inscriptions, where it functions analogously to divine curses in other types of inscription: to dissuade a challenger from trying to



98 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
violate that which has been recorded in the inscription. In the present text, however, the first event is closed by divine curses as well as by a monetary penalty, and curses are again invoked after the sixth and final event. This occurrence of curses in the accounts of the first and last events finds a parallel in the stele inscription Marduk-nadin-alJlJe BBSt 7, in which curses are employed to prevent would-be violators from contesting the transactions or altering the naru. Although the relationship between the Babylonian narus and the so-called "ancient kudurrus" is discussed in detail below in Chapter Seven, a few observations about the two corpora should be made here in the context of narus commemorating purchase of land. As previously noted, the so-called "ancient kudurrus" are third millennium inscribed stone artifacts dealing with land tenure. All "ancient kudurrus" commemorate purchases of land (Gelb, Steinkeller, and Whiting 1991: 2). The purchases are made by a single buyer from multiple sellers, and the persons involved in the sale, as buyers or sellers, are usually persons of high status; one "ancient kudurru," in fact, commemorates a purchase of land by the king (Gelb, Steinkeller, and Whiting 1991: 17). In contrast, land purchases form a small portion, less than 12 percent, of the corpus under investigation. A single instance of a king purchasing land is recorded. Meli-Sipak MDP X 87, commemorates the granting of multiple tracts of land along with settlements and exemptions to ljunnubat-Nanayya, daughter of the king. Included among the pieces of land given to the princess is an orchard that Meli-Sipak had purchased. (For a discussion of this naru, see the explication of NIG.NA, above in Chapter Two, pp. 42-53.) No Babylonian naru commemorates in the main a purchase made by the king.
Non-royal land grants
The structure of non-royal land grant inscriptions closely resembles that of the royal land grants. The texts of Enlil-nadin-apli BBSt 11 and Marduk-nadin-alJlJe, the Caillou Michaux, are both inscribed on stelae and exhibit the following structure:



CHAPTER 3: INSCRIPTIONS: SUBJECT AND STRUCTURE
Heading name Operative division description of the land statement of the transaction surveying of the land Imprecative division prohibitions curses Closing name
99
Marduk-zakir-sumi VAS I 35, a tablet-shaped stone, documents a grant from a father to son (i 1-31) followed by an apparently unrelated land purchase The grant portion of the text lacks both prohibitions and curses. Absent from the non-royal land grant inscriptions are any elements having to do with the king, i.e., a narrative involving service to the king or a paean in his praise, or any statement about the administering of the royal seal or witnesses to the sealing.
Non-royal grant of a temple prebend
The final type of inscription to be examined in this discussion commemorates the gift of a temple prebend made by the gods of that temple. NabO-suma-iskun VAS I 36 commemorates that the gods Nanayya and Mar-bHi of the Ezida temple granted a sinecure to a priest. The text can be summarized as follows:
Hymnic paean to the gods Nanayya and Mar-hili
Nanayya and Mar-bIti allow Nabfi-mutakkil to enter the cella of Nabfi in Borsippa (meaning that they accorded him the status of an erib b'fti, 'one who enters the sanctuary')

With the addition of postive Injunctions and blessing of the two beneficent gods, the structure of this inscription corresponds to the structure derived for the royal grants of land, prebends, and exemptions, with the substitution of the two gods, Nanayya and Mar-bi:ti, for the king.
CONCLUSIONS
The foregoing review demonstrates that the corpus is not limited to royal land grants. Yet despite the diverse types of event commemorated' inscriptions of the corpus follow a regular and predictable structure. These observations rely on an underlying chronological ordering of the extant datable corpus. It goes without saying that conclusions indicated by the trends and developments presented here are necessarily provisional as they are based on an ever increasing body of evidence and as such are subject to revision according to the recovery and publication of additional material. Detailed examination of the naru inscriptions reveals that the inscriptions, with the exception of the purchase inscriptions inscribed on tablet-shaped stones, share the same basic structure. Their pattern is essentially the same from type to type, regardless of whether the subject of the inscription was royal or non-royal, a gift either of land, prebend, or exemptions, an affirmation of

previously granted land, a purchase of land, or the settlement of a dispute.
Heading name (of the naru) Operative division: narrative paean description of land/prebend/exemptions statement of surveying statement of the event list of witnesses statement of royal sealing Imprecative division prohibitions curses and/or blessings Closing date colophon name (of the naru)
Again, the only significant departure from this structure is provided by the five records of purchase inscribed on tablet-shaped stones; with one exception, these do not contain divine curses. For the most part, variations in this pattern can be accounted for by three considerations. The first is the specific circumstances of the individual transaction and the resulting logic of the inscription. For example, the narrative, which serves to explain the background of land granted by the king or the legal history of a royal judgment, has no place in a text commemorating the purchase of land by one individual from another. Similarly, transactions made without any participation of the king would have neither opportunity nor need for a record of the royal seal. The second variation from the basic pattern may have to do with the physical configuration of the artifact upon which the text is inscribed. Although most members of the corpus occur in the shape of freestanding, upright irregular stelae, some occur as flattened plaques, and still others have been fashioned in the form



102 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
of tablets. These shapes are discussed in depth in the section on Physical Features, below in Chapter Five. In the context of the structure of the inscriptions, the foregoing review reveals a correlation between the tablet-shaped stones and a less fantastic, more mundane type of inscription. Such inscriptions lack the divine curses characteristic of the rest of the corpus and contain prohibitions only of a legal rather than otherworldly or divine nature. Finally, remaining variations may be attributable to diachronic developments within the corpus. Accounts of sealing and of witnesses appear for the first time in the inscriptions 0 f Meli-Sipak. In the inscription of Samas-suma-ukln BBSt 10, discussed above, one of the latest members of the corpus, the customary ordering of elements has been manipulated and lines devoted to the imprecative division are markedly fewer than in other inscriptions of this overall length. The prominent final position of the witnesses and date at the end of the inscription, combined with the relatively scanty imprecative division, may reflect a diminished role of the characteristically divine imprecative division in favor of a more mundane legalistically driven security against transgressors. Royal land grants are commemorated throughout the seven centuries for which the artifacts are attested, as are royal affirmations of land, adjudications, and the royal granting of land together with prebends and exemptions. Developments significant for political and social history also emerge from a chronological survey of the inscriptions: as was observed already by Brinkman (1980-83: 273), the amount of land granted according to the earlier inscriptions is greater than that granted in the later inscriptions, the significance of which is taken up below in Chapter Seven. Grant of a sinecure or prebend alone is first attested during the reign of Nabfi-apla-iddina, in the early 9th century, and grant of exemptions alone is first attested during the reign 0 f Nebuchadnezzar I (1125-1104). The earliest example of the artifacts being used to commemorate a non-royal event dates from the reign of Enlil-nadin-apli (1103-1100), successor to Nebuchadnezzar I. The commemoration of non-royal events IS attested thereafter through the latest members of the corpus.



CHAPTER 3: INSCRIPTIONS: SUBJECT AND STRUCTURE 103
This chapter sought to lay the groundwork for a formal analysis of the large corpus of the so-called Babylonian kudurru inscriptions. To that end, a typology of the inscriptions was derived based upon the subject of each artifact. The typology supports the long-standing impression of 'sameness' held to characterize the inscriptions in that the structure of the inscriptions does conform to a consistent, overriding pattern. On the other hand, this typology reveals that the subjects commemorated by the inscriptions are not limited to royal conferral of land tenure, but instead cover a range of different types of concerns. The following chapter considers the common denominator underlying these different concerns, and proposes a new interpretation for the ancient function of these artifacts.
I A full edition of this inscription is currently in preparation by the author. 2At least five other objects in private hands are known to the author: I have seen one severely effaced stele-shaped member of the corpus from the 10th-8th centuries, and photographs of four others currently held in private hands, three of which bear readable inscriptions. 3pull editions of the inscriptions with philological commentary are in preparation by the author for publication in a separate volume. 4Balkan (1986: 13) mentions documents from Kassite Nippur, which he dated to approximately 1375-1235, that refer to a debt of "deliveries from estates belonging to the king's daughters." Could lands held by the daughters of the king have been an institutionalized feature of Kassite Babylonian economy? Note also, the text of Meli-Sipak MDP X 87, discussed in the previous chapter, commemorating a grant of lands and exemptions by king Meli-Sipak to his daughter, ijunnubat-Nanayya, and who likely was affiliated with the temple of Nanayya. 5Kraus 1968: 33: "Ob die Aufzahlung einzelner Sicherstellungen nur zur konkreten Illustration des abstrakten Begriffs zakutu dient, das Wort zakutu also den Inbegriff aller gennanten und vielleicht noch anderer nicht gennanter Sicherstellungen bezeichnet, oder ob die aufgezahlten Sicherstellungen jeweils den Umfang der betreffenden zakutu genau umschreiben sollen, das Wort also Sammelname vieler verschiedener, wenn auch wesensverwandter Erscheinungen ist, Hisst sich nicht ausmachen." 6See lines iii 25-27. 7Although the operative division of Adad-apla-iddina UET I 165 is badly broken, the text contains rus'-id-ma "he made known, and" a phrase appearing regularly in the other adjudication texts narrating that a claim has been brought to the attention of the king. The preserved fragment of Marduksapik-zeri BBSt 12 also contains us-id-ma and a (restored) passage according to which the king returned a field to a petitioner.



104 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
8Meli-Sipak MDP II 99 includes positive and negative injunctions and, correspondingly, blessings and curses, and Marduk-sapik-zeri Sumer 36, includes blessings in addition to curses. 9Although the name of the king is not preserved, he is identified in obv. 11 as alJu tallmu sa Assur-bani-apli "twin brother of Assurbanipal." Moreover, Samas-suma-ukln is the obvious king to restore as the object of the writer's praise-it was his granting of the royal seal impression and affirming of the land that was the critical final event leading to the execution and erection of the naru. IOThis artifact was catalogued by Steinmetzer (1922: 76) as "Grenzstein in Phallusform," his standard designation for a stele, and by Brinkman (1968: 350) as a "stone stele." However, the drawing published in VAS I Beiheft, Tafel 2, and reprinted by Seidl (1989: Abb. 21, Nr. 100) depicts a tabletshaped stone with divine symbols in relief on the edge. Seidl (1989: 58-59, Nr. 100) described the artifact as a "Steintafel in Form und Aufbau einer Tontafel."



Chapter Four
Form and Function
Investigation of the narCt inscriptions reveals a variety of subjects. Nonetheless, the compelling uniformity of the inscriptions, and of the physical and visual features of the artifacts, imply that these different subjects were perceived by the Babylonians as all sharing in an underlying sameness. This chapter aims to identify the denominator common to the different subjects recorded in the narCt inscriptions, leading the way to determining the function of the narCts within their original cultural context. Clearly, the artifacts were not 'boundary stones'. Passages taken from their inscriptions demonstrate that the ancient Babylonians did not designate these artifacts as kudurrus 'boundaries' or 'boundary markers'; they knew them rather as narCts '(stone) stelae' or '(stone) monuments'. Moreover, archaeological and textual evidence, reviewed above in Chapter Two, illustrates that the artifacts known to modern scholarship as kudurrus were installed in temples, not in fields, and could not have functioned as boundary markers. Some years ago, I. J. Gelb (1951) dubbed a group of 3rd millennium artifacts relating to land tenure the "ancient kudurrus." Gelb, Steinkeller, and Whiting, in a recent study of these so-called "ancient kudurrus" (1991), proposed that the "Babylonian kudurrus," the subject of the present inquiry, had been deposited in temples in order to place them under divine protection and to publicize title to land holdings. According to Gelb, Steinkeller, and Whiting (1991: 23-24):
105



106 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
The purpose of depositing kudurrus, ancient and later, in a temple was not to register them in a sort of record office, but to afford them the protection of the gods, and, at the same time, to make them accessible to public scrutiny, and therefore, to publicize the deed of purchase or donation of land by or to an individual.
Buccellati, wntIng in a 1994 article, "The Kudurrus as Monuments," and in part responding to Gelb, Steinkeller, and Whiting, raised the question of function anew. In regards to the so-called "Babylonian kudurrus," Buccellati's (1994: 284) stated objective was to determine the "physical and functional setting or social space (the "Sitz im Leben"... ) of this particular class of artifacts," an inquiry that he phrased in terms of understanding "their physical emplacement in some "real time" built environment," and "their structural function within Mesopotamian institutional life." To that end, he took up previous research bearing on the physical setting of the artifacts, that is, scholarship that had argued for their placement either in fields or in temples. These arguments are largely philological and hinge on the interpretation and distribution of the attributive use of the pronoun su and its declined forms suatul i.
In early Assyriological publications considering the placement of the artifacts under investigation, a passage containing the phrase naru su or naru suatu was translated "that naru," and was understood as referring to an object located at some distance from the speaker in contradistinction to one located nearby. Earlier scholars, such as Hinke, King, and Steinmetzer, read naru suatu as "that naru" and concluded that the phrase must refer to an object separate from the artifact at hand-which object they understood to be the kudurru (see Steinmetzer 1922: 101-12, and the discussion of Seidl 1989: 72). Advances in modern knowledge of the Akkadian language, however, have enabled us to refine our understanding of the pronoun suisuatu. It is not a demonstrative pronoun and does not correspond to English 'that' in the sense of indicating an object distant from the speaker, i.e., 'that one over there'. Rather, su!Suatu is an anaphoric pronoun, signifying something like 'that one we have been talking about', or 'the aforementioned'. It conveys a notion of specificity rather than of



CHAPTER 4: FORM AND FUNCTION 107
location, and is more accurately rendered in English by 'the very', or 'that particular', and even in some cases 'this' (see GAG §41 2 b. 2; Huehnergard 1997: 41-42; and CAD S/3, S.v. JWiti). Thus, nara Ja or nara Juatu is best understood as 'the aforementioned nara', or, depending on the context, 'this nara', without any implication of 'distance' or 'nearness' to the speaker. Seidl (1989: 72) took up this debate and dismissed the philological argument as having no bearing on the question of the original placement of the artifacts. Abandoning this particular philological approach as a dead end, Buccellati (1994: 283) proposed that at all times there stood uninscribed and unsculpted stone kudurrus in the fields, and that stone kudurrus of similar size and shape-i.e., the artifacts investigated in this study-were inscribed and sculpted and set up for public display. His proposal (Buccellati 1994: 284) is grounded in what he calls a "morphological" analysis of the physical form of the artifacts: "the vaguely cylindrical nature of their shape; the relative unevenness of their form, especially their sides; the presence of a pointed top (sometimes highlighted by a pillow-like disk), the fact that they often have an inset base, characterized by a much rougher surface than the upper part; and their relatively small size." Continuing in this vein, Buccellati (1994: 285) observed that "the kudurrus are not stelas, columns, or obelisks, where the shape of the stone is in and of itself decorative; rather the aesthetic aspect is limited almost exclusively to the surface decoration." Buccellati concluded that the inscribed and sculpted artifacts investigated in this study are thus a by-form of similarly shaped, uninscribed and unsculpted stone artifacts placed in the fields, probably at strategic points such as the place where a boundary takes a tum. He suggested that the hypothetical unadorned stones may even have served as "bench marks for surveying purposes," drawing a comparison between the shape of one member of the corpus under investigation and the shape of an object held by a deity in a sculpture known as the Votive Boulder of Puzur-In§u§inak, a composition interpreted by Buccellati as a god sighting a surveying line across the top of an object held in his hands (Buccellati 1994: 285-86, n. 17, and especially figs. 1 and 2).



108 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
In further support of his argument that the artifacts fundamentally are field markers, Buccellati (1994: 286) discussed the verbal root kdr, proposing that it is best understood with a generic meaning 'to be crest-like' and specific meanings 'to raise the head in an overbearing manner' and 'to raise the head like a point', evoking again the image of these stones in the field functioning as surveyors' marks. Buccellati (1994: 286) also proposed that NIO.DU, the logographic writing for kudurru, means in Sumerian literally 'thing of walking' or 'pacing'. He astutely pointed out that the writing NIO.DU did not develop from an early Sumerian word, and suggested rather that it may describe the function of the kudurru, bringing again to mind the notion of pacing off distances in a field. Finally, Buccellati (1984: 286) took up the question of the inscribed and sculpted kudurrus as "display monuments," proposing that it was a natural development that "kudurrus as field markers (whether as boundary stones or as bench marks) should come to serve as symbols for the field as a legal entity." Thus, when erected in a public space, the stones "would have served as a public and permanent record of the deed." Buccellati (1994: 286-87; and also p. 285, fig. 1) proposed as well that because of their rounded bases, the inscribed and sculpted "kudurrus" must have been set into some kind of mud brick platform. Buccellati (1994: 287) concluded that the inscribed and sculpted by-forms of the "field kudurrus" served to make public to the community changes in property rights:
(T)he public and permanent display of the kudurrus would have served the specific purpose of providing true public access to the information. The "public" archives were such only in the sense that different interested parties could consult the records; but the "public" display of the monuments meant that everybody in the community was made aware (and, to the extent that the monuments were permanent, kept aware) of the shifts in property rights. If so, the social space of the kudurrus was such that it would not only cater to individual vanity, but also to the safeguard of communal relationships.
Buccellati (1994: 287-90) also drew a functional parallel between the inscribed and sculpted 'display kudurrus' and the



CHAPTER 4: FORM AND FUNCTION 109
third millennium Mesopotamian practice of using clay plaques and pegs to publicize property rights. In sum, the interpretations of Buccellati and of Oelb, Steinkeller, and Whiting are in agreement that the primary function of the artifacts under investigation was to publicize land tenure. Buccellati's effort to present a functional interpretation of the artifacts is welcome. Nonetheless, from the perspective of the present study, his analysis is encumbered from the start by its acceptance of the modern Assyriological designation of the artifacts as kudurrus, i.e., 'boundary markers'. This study has demonstrated instead that the artifacts were known to their ancient public as narus '(stone) monuments'. While I agree with Buccellati's philological analysis that the terms kudurru and NIO.DU signify designations for 'boundary, boundary marker', and his hypothesis that such markers were neither sculpted nor inscribed, there is but a single textual context that requires translating kudurru as 'boundary marker' rather than as 'boundary':
ki-sur-ri-,~i-na im-ma-Ui-ma pu-lu-uk-ki fa ,~it-ku-nu
/1/1I"_n,'1_fI NtG.DU-,~i-na
nu-uk-fku '-ru-ma fa mu-ub-bu-~'W
Their borders were forgotten and boundary stakes were not put in place, in the fields their kudurrus were removed and (so) were not driven in. (Merodach-baladan II, VAS 137 iii 15-22)
Moreover, even granting that kudurru could signify by 'boundary marker' in the inscriptions, there is no evidence that such markers were fashioned out of stone. Deprived of the designation kudurru 'boundary/boundary marker', Buccellati's proposition for two by-forms of the artifacts-one unadorned and standing in the fields and one sculpted and inscribed for display-is rendered insupportable. Considering the scarcity and value of hard stone in Mesopotamia (a topic taken up in more detail in Chapter Seven, below), I am not persuaded that kudurrus 'boundary markers' of the same size and shape as the inscribed and sculpted artifacts under investigation would have been placed in fields. Finally, as has been noted al



110 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
ready and is discussed further in this and the following chapters, artifacts belonging to the corpus occur in shapes other than the irregular stele-shape interpreted by Buccellati as a field marker and potential surveyors' bench mark. In addressing function, this study proceeds from the premise that the artifacts under investigation communicate information by two different media-verbally, by means of their inscriptions, and visually, by means of their relief sculptures. Moreover, as demonstrated by the discussion of Meli-Sipak MDP X 87, (above, Chapter Two, pp. 42-53) and in this chapter (below, p. 142) the relief sculptures and inscriptions of individual artifacts were composed in consideration of one another. Buccellati's (1994: 283) critique that previous scholarship on the artifacts, recent and remote, has focused solely on the textual and iconographic characteristics without considering their existence as (public) monuments, is well taken. Nonetheless, accurate understanding of those textual and iconographic features is a prerequisite for understanding, in so far as possible, the intent of those responsible for the verbal and visual composition of the artifacts as well as the impact of those compositions upon their intended audience. Analyses of philological and iconographic features-and their inter-relationship-are thus fundamental to understanding the artifacts as they functioned within their ancient cultural context. As this study is grounded primarily in investigation of the textual corpus, the question of function picks up where the previous chapter left off-with the aim of determining the common denominator shared by the subjects of the inscriptions. The structural analysis of the inscriptions offered in the previous chapter provides a vocabulary for addressing more profoundly the question of function. The operative division of the inscriptions records the event commemorated by the naru. In addition to describing the land, prebend, or exemptions that were acquired, affirmed, or adjudicated, the operative division of the inscriptions also makes known the relationships among the parties involved. The imprecative division, consisting of prohibitions against violating the event commemorated and a series of divine curses to take effect if the prohibitions were transgressed, communicates



CHAPTER 4: FORM AND FUNCTION 111
how and to what end the narus were intended to commemorate the event recorded in the operative division. Once the intended function of the narus according to their inscriptions has been delineated, this chapter then turns to how their texts and imagery work together to achieve that function.
FUNCTION EXPRESSED THROUGH TEXT
Grants of land (eqlu and kiru)
The inscriptions most commonly commemorate that the king has granted a field or fields (Akkadian eqlu, written A.sA; pI. eqletu written A.sA.MES). In these inscriptions, descriptions of the field invariably include: (a) the area as measured volumetrically in terms of zeru 'seed-grain' needed to plant the field (see also p. xx, above); (b) location of the field according to its borders in each of the four cardinal directions; and (c) identification of its water source, a canal or river adjoining the piece of land and serving as one of its borders. In addition to relating how much seed was required to plant the field, identification of the water source also indicates that the land granted had agricultural potential. In fact, the narrative of one inscription relates that prior to its being granted, the land was transformed by the king from undeveloped ground into an irrigable-that is, agriculturally viable-field:
A.sA a-pi-ti sa PAs nam-ka-ra it ka-la-a la i-su-u-um l

formed meadow-land, made good its irrigation canal for a layout for cultivation, and for tIunnubat-Nanayya a total (area) of 40 gur... he delimited as the boundary/territory. (Meli-Sipak MDP X 87, i 4-16)
Another inscription similarly depicts the uncultivable state of a field prior to its being granted:
A.Sk..

la su-lu-ku-u-ma a-na me-te-eq A.MES GAR-nu
a field ... (in) which, from early days, no dike had been heaped up, no furrow had been prepared, and which was not fit for cultivation but was situated for the passage of water, ... ( ... PN measured and Nebuchadnezzar granted) (Nebuchadnezzar I, the Hinke "kudurru," ii 29-31)
Thus, grants of eqlu 'field' should be understood explicitly as grants of agriculturally viable land. As such, they constituted grants of significant potential income to the beneficiary. Occasionally, land specifically identified as kiru 'orchard' IS granted in addition to or instead of eqlu. Descriptions of orchards, occupying areas smaller than the eqlu, also include identification of their water source. Because kiru are distinguished from eqlu in the inscriptions, they must have been conceived by the Babylonians as distinctive from eqlu, perhaps because of the extensive long-term investment of time and care required to establish and maintain fruit and olive bearing trees. These small plots of orchard land represented sizable inherent income as well. That land grants constitute potential income may seem an obvious point, for what would be the desirability in ancient Mesopotamia of acquiring land if not for cultivation? Land as an ongoing source of income in perpetuity, however, is a specific perspective on land that may hold the key to the underlying unspoken connection linking together the different subjects commemorated by the artifacts under study.



CHAPTER 4: FORM AND FUNCTION 113
Grants of prebends (isqu)
As demonstrated in the previous chapter, the structure of inscriptions detailing prebend grants corresponds closely to the structure of the land grant texts. Prebends, or sinecures, consist of shares in consumable goods-fish, bread, beer, clothing, etc.-disbursed from the temple on a regular and ongoing basis. Grants of prebends thus parallel grants of agricultural lands both formally and functionally. Formally, prebends play an identical role in the structure of the inscriptions, filling the slot occupied by fields in the land grant inscriptions. Functionally, like a field, a sinecure is a source of unceasing income for as long as the recipient lays claim to it.
Grants of exemptions (zakOtu)
Like the inscriptions recording prebend grants, the structure of the inscriptions documenting grants of zakutu, 'exemptions' or 'exemption-status', closely parallels that of the land grants. In the inscriptions, the verbal description and account of granting of the exemptions occupies the same position as the description and granting of the field. Formally, then, the exemption fills a role identical to that of a field in a land grant inscription or the prebend in the prebend grant inscription. Functionally, the parallel of exemption grants to land or prebend grants is not as clear. It is easily grasped how the naru, used largely to commemorate the acquisition of land and its commensurate potential income, could also be employed to commemorate the acquisition of a temple prebend, another form of perpetual income. In the same regard, exemption of a significant territory and its residents from seizure of animals and goods and the conscription of laborers would represent a form of income. By keeping those resources for his own use instead of providing them to the king, the recipient of zakutu would experience a substantial decrease in his expenditures, and, moreover, he could presumably redirect those newly unencumbered resources to his own holdings. By not being called upon to provide those resources ever again, the zakutu-grant represented an ongoing enhancement of resources for the recipient. Thus, acquisition of exemptions, commemorated by narus in the same fashion as



114 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
grants of land and grants of prebend, resulted in the same net effect: an increase in real income for the beneficiary.
Land purchases
Agricultural land acquired through purchase-and, as noted above, land commemorated by narus is identified as eqlu or kiru-would have represented the same kind of potential income as land acquired by a royal grant. Although houses and agricultural outbuildings do not generate income in the same way, purchases of such structures are documented typically as part of a field purchase, and, in any event, constitute an acquisition of assets. As long as the purchaser could lay claim to the property, he was ensured of receiving whatever income it might accrue.
THE CONCEPT OF ENTITLEMENT
In their publication of a fragmentary member of the corpus inscribed with a record of a prebend grant, Brinkman and Dalley (1988: 76) introduced the term 'entitlement' as the equivalent of isqu 'prebend'. To 'entitle', a term derived from 'title', a concept traditionally associated with land rights, is:
to furnish (a person) with a 'title' to an estate. Hence, gen. to give (a person or thing) a rightful claim to a possession, privilege, designation, mode of treatment, etc. (The Compact Edition of the Oxford English Dictionary (1988), s.v. 'entitle').
The idea conveyed by the concept of entitlement is appropriate for all the subjects documented by the naru inscriptions-not only the grants of temple prebends, but land grants royal and non-royal, purchases of land, grants of temple prebends, whether made by king or another party, legal settlements resulting in title, and the granting of exemptions. All types of entitlement documented in the corpus signified a source of potential income for the recipient: income from the agricultural promise of a field, from a share in temple disbursements, or from release from an anticipated customary expenditure of goods, services, or manpower. Acquisition or affirmation of an entitlement to an ongoing



CHAPTER 4: FORM AND FUNCTION 115
source of income, or a permanent reduction in expenditures, is at the heart of every nara inscription in the corpus. The term 'Entitlement nara' is adopted here as an appropriate and accurate designation denoting both the form and the function of the artifacts as well as incorporating their ancient designation. It can be applied consistently to every member of the corpus.
SEALING AND THE DURABILITY OF ENTITLEMENT
Hereditary entitlements
The Entitlement nara inscnptIons do not simply report the acquisition or affirmation of entitlement through grant or purchase. They document that the acquired or affirmed entitlement was to have been everlasting. To have been permanent and enduring requires that the entitlement had to have been hereditary, that is, that the holder must have had the ability to pass the entitlement down to his heirs from generation to succeeding generation. The nara texts inform us about the hereditary nature of the entitlements, and durability of entitlements is expressed in a general fashion with stock phrases in both divisions of the inscriptions. For example, royal grants regularly are expressed in the operative division with the formula: RN PN arassu ana um $ati irim "(RN) granted to (PN), his servant, for the distant future." Likewise, the enduring quality of the entitlement is invariably expressed in the imprecative division, where the expression miitima ina um $ati "Whensoever in the distant future," occurs throughout the corpus. The phrase signals, in fact, the beginning of the imprecative division in almost every inscription. In Mesopotamia, the route of inheritance customarily proceeded from father to son. It is by no means to be assumed that land or other entitlement granted by the king was automatically eligible to be passed from father to son in perpetuity. This point was also made by Lambert (1971: 180, n. 2): "It is clear that irim "he donated" and ana um .yati "in perpetuity" are not always to be taken at face value." On the contrary, as a passage from one Entitlement nara inscription, Samas-suma ukIn BBSt 10, rev.



116 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
6-9, cited below, explicitly illustrates, farmland assigned by the king was not eligible to be inherited unless the recipient had received a record of the entitlement impressed with the king's seal. In the absence of other evidence, such phrases as "for the distant future" might be regarded as semantic niceties, hyperbolic wishful thinking on the part of the entitlement recipient. But variations in the expected formulary of the inscriptions, as well as circumstances occasionally detailed in the narratives, illustrate that obtaining and preserving the ability to pass on the entitlement was of paramount concern to the Babylonians who commissioned and erected the Entitlement narus.
Sealing (stone) narus?
"Sealing" in Assyriology denotes impressing a clay tablet (!uppu) with a personal or official seal. In Mesopotamia, the seal was generally a cylinder or a stamp, usually bearing the name of its owner and/or the title of his office, and often some visual image. Seals could also bear only an iconographic design without any text. In lieu of a cylinder or stamp seal, an individual could impress a clay tablet with his fingernail or garment hem to serve as his 'seal'. The Akkadian verb kanaku means 'to seal a document (by impressing it with a seal)', and kanfku signifies a 'sealed document'. The noun kunukku, designating both 'seal' (the stamp or cylinder used to make the impression) and 'sealing' (the impression left by the seal), came by a figure of speech also to signify 'sealed clay tablet' (see CAD K, s.v. kunukku 1,2, and 3). On a clay tablet inscribed with a legal text, a seal impression certified an individual's participation in and acknowledgment of the transaction recorded on the tablet. While sealings of witnesses also may appear on a legal document, as could the seal of any participant in the transaction, the critical seal impression was made by the party who gave up something in the transaction documented by the inscription. Scholars grappling with the legal significance of sealing have introduced to the discussion the concepts of rights and obligations. According to Renger (1977: 76), "(a) legal document in



CHAPTER 4: FORM AND FUNCTION 117
Mesopotamia was generally sealed either by the witnesses or by the party to an agreement who relinquished a right (for instance, the seller in a sale) or assumed an obligation (the debtor in a loan)." Steinkeller (1977: 45-46), reviewing the practice of sealing in Ur III legal documents, expanded on the same idea:
legal texts are sealed by the party who undertakes a specific obligation in a given transaction: in sales, the seller who abandons any claim to the sold property; in loans, the borrower promises to return the loan (and interest) on a given date; in gifts, the donor who renounces his rights to the gift; in hiring, the owner or relative of the hired person who assures that the hireling will work in accordance with the agreement.
In the Entitlement naru inscriptions, reference to sealing is made in royal grants, in land purchase texts, and in a unique case, a grant by two gods of a prebend of their temple. Of course, it was not possible to seal a stone monument by impressing it with a seal, indicating that the Entitlement naru inscriptions must have been copied from clay tablet originals (see e.g., Brinkman 1980-83: 269). This conclusion is supported by additional statements from the corpus. For instance, a colophon from an Entitlement naru dated to Nebuchadnezzar I (BBSt 24), asserts unambiguously that the text was written "according to a
record on clay" a-na pi-i ni-is-bi sa !i-i-!i. Similarly, there is the following colophon of an adjudication text finally settled during the reign of Meli-Sipak:
a-su-mi-it-tu an-ni-i-tu ga-ba-re-e ,~a-Ial-ti ka-nik di-ni
sa dIM-MU-SUM-na dIM-MU-URU,

This stele (is) a copy of three sealed judgments of Adad-suma-iddina, Adad-suma-u~ur, and Meli-Sipakthree kings. (Meli-Sipak BBSt 3, colophon)



118 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
The impressing of a clay tablet (original) is mentioned in the colophon of an Entitlement nara dated to the reign of Merodachbaladan II:
ina NA4.KISIB LUGAL ,M SlD'-re-p-[/ sa la tam-sil u la pa-qa-ri !up-pi bar-mu
With the royal seal of allocations, that precludes reproduction and claim, the tablets are impressed. (Merodach-baladan II VAS 137, v 48-50)
Other evidence for clay tablet originals includes the frequent mention in the Entitlement nara inscriptions of witnesses present "at the sealing of the field," or "at the sealing of the tablet." These phrases may be understood as shorthand references to the preparation and/or the witnessing of a legal document recording on clay the event subsequently commemorated by the stone nara.
Sealing and inheritance
Sealing a record of entitlement with the royal seal, or as it is often expressed metonymically in the inscriptions, simply 'sealing', i.e., 'sealing (the entitlement)" is first attested in Entitlement naras dating to the reign of Meli-Sipak (BBSt 3, BBSt 4, MDP X 87). The text of Meli-Sipak BBSt 3, the colophon of which is cited just above, concerns the disposition of an estate left without named heir. The narrative of the inscription recalls various challenges made against the estate over the course of three consecutive reigns. The final passage before the beginning of the imprecative division states:

The king, Meli-Sipak, sealed (a document about) the estate of Takil-ana-ilIsu, diviner, and gave (it) for distant days



CHAPTER 4: FORM AND FUNCTION

son of Ur-Belet-muballitat-mIti. (Meli-Sipak BBSt 3, v 21-26)
119
Though not made explicit in this text, other inscriptions of the corpus illustrate that receipt of a sealed document about the entitlement was necessary if the entitlement were to be hereditary. According to the inscription dated to Samas-suma-ukln mentioned above, the son of a man to whom land has been restored petitioned the king to make the land eligible to be inherited. The son presented his case by narrating how his own father had been received by King Esarhaddon, the father of Samas-suma-ukln:
dDIN-SES-MU LUGAL EN-su im-gur-su-ma A.SA.ME sa-si-na u-ter-amma u-sad-gil paJ nil-[su] ku-nu-uk LUGAL sa fa pa-qa-ru la id-di-nu-nis-sum-ma la i-zi-hu ar[ki-i]

"Esarhaddon, the king, his lord, received him, and again entrusted to him the aforementioned fields, but he was not given (a document impressed with) the royal seal precluding claims, and so he could not leave (the fields) after (him). Now, may Samas-suma-ukln, the king, my lord, give to me (a document impressed with) the royal seal that precludes duplication and claim, so that there be no claims and I may leave (the fields) after (me)." (Samas-suma-ukln BBSt 10, rev. 6-9)
The text makes clear that the entitlement in question, land restored by Esarhaddon to the petitioner's father, could not be inherited because the petitioner's father had not received a written record impressed with the seal of the king. Without a document so sealed, the entitlement was subject to rival claims after the death of the recipient and was not necessarily eligible to be passed on as inheritance. An inscription of Merodach-baladan I confirms that also in earlier centuries, lack of a document impressed with the royal seal left an entitlement open to challenge by rival claims:

they measured the aforementioned field, and affirmed it to Munnabittu, King Meli-Sipak did not seal (the field), and so in the first year Marduk-apla-iddina (was) king, AlJunea, son of Dayyan-Marduk, claimed a 3 (gur), 2 ban (area), orchard (of the aforementioned field), and said, "It is the' gate' of my field." (Merodach-baladan MDP VI 31-39, ii 4-18)
Here, it seems that the failure of Meli-Sipak to "seal the field," i.e., to have presented to the land holder a document impressed with the royal seal, left the door open for a third party to claim part of the granted land. In response to Munnabittu' s petition, King Merodach-baladan I, heir to Meli-Sipak, investigated the claims, restored the misappropriated area to Munnabittu, and then:
dAMAR.UTU-IBILA-SUM-na ... DIS-u if (up-pi A.sA ka-nik di-ni ik-nu-uk-ma a-na ffiMu-un-na-bit-tu4 id-di-in
Merodach-bal adan... sealed the wooden writing board(?)6 and the tablet of the field, the sealed document of the decision, and gave (it) to Munnabittu. (Merodach-baladan MDP VI 31-39, iii 11-14)



CHAPTER 4: FORM AND FUNCTION 121
Possession of written records bearing the royal seal would henceforth protect Munnabittu from rival claims and would enable him to bequeath the land to his heirs. Finally, in the prohibitions of a royal land grant inscription dated to Marduk-nadin-abbe, preparation of the sealed document is equated with the granting of the field.

This passage implies that without a sealed tablet, the entitlement might as well never have been given.
'royal seal of allocations'
Beginning with the inscriptions of Marduk-nadin-abbe, a new phrase appears in the Entitlement nara inscriptions commemorating an event effected by the king: gabare kunuk §arri Ja Jipreti 'copy of the royal seal Ja Jipreti'. The term also occurs simply as kunuk Jarri .fa Jipreti, and once as kunuk Jarri Ja Jipreti Ja Zii tam.HZ u Iii paqiiri. Brinkman (1967: 72-3), writing on kunuk Jarri Ja .fipreti in 1967, translated it as 'royal seal of administration'. Twenty years later, Kienast (1987) collected attestations of the phrase and concluded that it should be translated as 'Konigliches Siegel fur Zuweisung', i.e., 'royal seal of allocation'. This study follows Kienast's interpretation. As observed by both Brinkman and Kienast, the complete expression is attested only in this corpus of inscriptions and on one cylinder seal. In the 23 sufficiently preserved Entitlement naras dating from Marduk-nadin-abbe and later kings, the phrase is present in 11 of the 16 inscriptions recording an event effected by the king. In accounts of the remaining five royal events, the seal is identified as seal of the king in two, and the other three do not record being sealed. In other words, from the reign of Marduk



122 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
nadin-abbe on, in texts that include any reference to sealing, the expressIon kunuk .sarri .sa Jipreti 'royal seal of allocations', appears in some variation in all land grants, prebend grants, exemptions, adjudications and land restorations effected by the king. The cylinder seal, published by Frankfort (1939: XXXVI/k and p. 20) is carved in lapis lazuli. Brinkman (1967: 72) suggested it should be regarded as a dynastic seal-that is, belonging to the office of kingship and not to any individual king. It should be noted that the text is not carved on the cylinder seal in mirror perspective; it is carved instead as if to be read from the cylinder seal itself rather than from an impression made by the seal.
Documents sealed by agents other than the king
Sealings by agents other than the king are attested in seven Entitlement nara inscriptions. Of these, six preserve the type of event recorded. Five of these six record non-royal land purchases, and in each of these, the seal is identified as that of the seller. According to the sixth text, Nabfi-suma-iskun VAS I 36, two gods, Nanayya and Mar-bHi, granted a prebend from their temple to an individual, simultaneously according him the status of erib biti 'one who enters the sanctuary'. Following the list of witnesses to the sealing, introduced by the phrase ina kanak !uppi Juati "at the sealing of the aforementioned tablet," the seal is identified as kunuk Nanayya u Mar-bUi .sa fa paqaru "seal of (divine) Nanayya and (divine) Mar-bHi that precludes challenge. " The non-royal sealings attested in the Entitlement nara corpus are executed by the party who gave up the entitlement, either as a gift or in exchange for payment. By sealing the record of the entitlement, the fonner holder gave up all future claim to the entitlement. This interpretation is supported by prohibition clauses featured by some of the land purchase inscriptions. Whereas in the prohibitions characteristic of royal grants, "any man, be he king, officer, or any man whatsoever," is enjoined against violating the entitlement, in texts recording land purchase, prohibitions identify the seller by name and members of his family and forbid them to challenge the sale. For example, in an Entitlement nara



CHAPTER 4: FORM AND FUNCTION 123
dating to Sargon II summarized above, pp. 96-7, in the first of seven transactions recorded, the text states that Ina-esi-itlr gave a field to Nabfi-dfl in exchange for another field and six mina of silver. The text of the transaction concludes with the statement ,~upur Ina-eJi-itir klma kunukklJu 'Fingernail (impression) of Inaisi-itlr, in place of his seal'. In keeping with his having sealed the document of sale, the imprecation section is aimed specifically at Ina-isi-itlr and his relations:
ma-ti-ma ina EGIR UD.MES
ina SES.MES DUMUMES ina IM.RLA rIM1.RLA u IM.RLA
[sa] Emlna-SUij-KAR-ir
Whensoever in future days, (from) among the brothers, sons, among family, relations, and kin by marriage, of the household of Ina-esi-itIr... (Sargon II VAS 170, i 31-34)
This text also illustrates the two sides of the role of sealing vis-avis the hereditary nature of an entitlement secured by a narCt. Just as the sealing of a grant secured the claim of the recipient and his descendants, a sealed record of land purchase ensured that the seller's descendants could not contest the entitlement in the future. In sum, texts concerned with the presence or absence of the royal seal tell us that a tablet bearing the king's seal established title to the property, and possession of a document so sealed ensured that the entitlement could be passed down from the original recipient to his heir, and subsequently to his heir, theoretically indefinitely. Once impressed by the royal seal, not even the king could claim or reclaim the entitlement. This hypothesis is supported by statements occurring regularly in the prohibitions of the imprecative division according to which not even the king could claim the entitlement. Of course, the stone narCt itself could not be sealed by the conventional means of pressing a seal into clay. But by preserving an immutable record of the preparation and sealing of the written record and the witnesses to the sealing, the stone Entitlement narCt ensured the durability of the entitlement itself.



124 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
This feature of the Entitlement nara inscription provided the legal foundation for the recipient's claim to the entitlement commemorated by the nara, and functioned to ensure its durability.
FUNCTION EXPRESSED THROUGH TEXT AND IMAGE
Previous investigations of the relationship between the inscriptions and the relief sculptures have centered on an anticipated correlation between the divinities named in the curses and the divinities represented by the symbols. Yet such a relationship cannot be demonstrated for a single member of the corpus (see most recently Seidl 1980-83: 276; Black, Green, and Rickards 1992: 16). The relationship between the inscriptions and the relief sculptures therefore must be sought at a more subtle level of interpretation. Because most members of the corpus do exhibit both text and relief, the artifacts offer an opportunity to consider the two media separately and complementarily. The following discussion turns to the function of the imagery and to the interrelation of the inscriptions and the relief sculptures.
Relief imagery of the Entitlement narfis
The relief imagery of the Entitlement naras consists of (a) divine symbols that appear on almost every member of the corpus, and (b) a much smaller number of relief scenes. Ursula Seidl's book, Die babylonischen Kudurru-Reliefs (Seidl 1968), investigates in detail the iconographic elements of the Babylonian Entitlement naras. Her study, reviewed by Kraus (1970), consists of five main sections: a catalogue of the 160 Entitlement naras and nara fragments known up to 1966; a summary of the physical disposition of the artifacts, including their material, dimensions, and provenance; a description of the repertoire of the divine symbols exhibited in the reliefs ("Kudurrusymbolik"); and a detailed discussion of Mesopotamian iconography organized according to the divine symbols and other images attested in the corpus. The book concludes with an essay on iconographic style and observations about Babylonian iconography in general and



CHAPTER 4: FORM AND FUNCTION 125
the Entitlement narus in particular. Seidl's study, originally her doctoral dissertation, was republished in 1988 with "Nachtrage," pp. 221-32, an annotated bibliography of pertinent publications that appeared up to 1988. A second, much shorter treatment by Seidl (1980-83) on the imagery of the Entitlement narus appears in the Reallexikon der Assyriologie.
Before Seidl's study, scholarship on the imagery of the Babylonian Entitlement narus was devoted largely to identification of the divine symbols. Thanks to her efforts, we have an upto-date and comprehensive catalogue of Entitlement naru relief imagery, and moreover, identification of most of the gods represented as well as histories of the origins of the symbols. In addition, Seidl's explication of individual symbols (1989: 97-194) begins with a bibliography for each of the representations. Seidl's work has brought a much needed order to this subject, and has contributed to our knowledge of Mesopotamian divine iconography above and beyond the corpus of Entitlement narus.
Inter-relationship of image and text
In regards to the relationship between the relief imagery and the inscriptions, Seidl observed two circumstances that prevail throughout the entire corpus. First, on none of the extant Entitlement narus is the array of divinities represented visually by the symbols the same as the array of divinities represented verbally by the curses. The same conclusion were reached by Black, Green, and Rickards (1992: 16), who also compared the narus under investigation here with other monuments bearing divine symbols:
Furthermore, on stelae and rock reliefs erected by Assyrian kings (or exceptionally governors) to commemorate special events, there is sometimes a one-to-one correlation in both number and order between the gods invoked in the inscription and the symbols depicted. Yet more usually this is not so. For the kudurrus, moreover, the gods invoked in the curses of the main text are never those symbolized on the stone.
Seidl (1980-83: 276) attributed this lack of concord to origins of the visual and the verbal repertoire in separate, apparently independent, traditions.



126 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
Second, Seidl concluded from her observations of the extant artifacts that the reliefs were sculpted upon the naru before the text was inscribed. My own observations support Seidl's contention that the texts were inscribed after the imagery had been carved. Moreover, some Entitlement narus show evidence of having been re-inscribed while their earlier relief carvings were preserved.7 A number of scholars have grappled with the lack of concord evinced between the gods represented visually by the sculpted symbols and verbally by the inscribed curses. I submit that there is a relationship between the textual and visual aspects of the narus, and that it is far more complex than a direct one-to-one, divine-name-to-divine-symbol correspondence. As has been demonstrated for other Mesopotamian artifacts comprising both image and text, the two media function as more than simple reflections of one another. Winter (1985: 22), for example, articulated this relationship in regard to the third millennium Stele of Eannatum (Stele of the Vultures):
It is immediately apparent ... that the correspondence between text and imagery is not exact. Significant elements within the verbal narrative are not depicted on the stele, while certain details so carefully depicted in the relief are not fully described in the text. Read in conjunction with the imagery, the text does help to identify the specific conflict and interpret certain details of the pictorial narative. But the verbal imagery has its own agenda, not identical to that of the text.
The following discussion takes up the inter-relationship between text and image. Seidl's conclusions give the impression that the inscriptions and the reliefs existed rather separately from one another. This study disputes that assessment with an argument based upon (a) textual references to the imagery occurring in passages from the Entitlement naru inscriptions, and (b) positive correlations evinced by the texts and imagery of individual Entitlement narus. As noted above, Entitlement narus are inscribed with a main text, divided in this study into four divisions and within those divisions into constituent elements. A minority of Entitlement narus are inscribed additionally with captions located within the



CHAPTER 4: FORM AND FUNCTION 127
sculpted relief field. Both main inscriptions and captions contain evidence that speaks to a relationship between the verbal text and the visual imagery. The captions, associated spatially with specific images, make explicit reference either to divine symbols or to aspects of a relief scene. References made in the main text to the visual imagery are both explicit and implicit. Explicit textual references to the imagery are found in the curses belonging to the imprecative division, and implicit textual references occur where there exists a demonstrable correspondence between the elements pictured in the relief composition and the elements of the inscribed text. Both explicit and implicit textual references can be discerned for divine symbols as well as for relief scenes.
TEXTUAL REFERENCES TO DIVINE SYMBOLS
Captions
Divine names are inscribed in the relief fields of ten Entitlement narus. 8 None of these ten are datable, and seven are small fragments. Individual divine names are placed in close proximity, that is, inscribed above, below, or alongside individual divine symbols, and presumably signify verbally through incised cuneiform the same god represented visually by means of sculpted symbol. All of the Entitlement naru fragments that have captions associated with symbols were recovered in Susa, giving rise to the hypothesis that the captions were added by the Elamites after the stones had been removed from Babylonia (see Seidl 1980-83: 275; also Black, Green, and Rickards 1992: 114). With the aim of comparing sign forms in the captions to sign forms in the main inscriptions, I examined in the Louvre the paleography of all the Entitlement narus bearing captions associated with symbols. Unfortunately, everyone of the fragments with these captions preserves only a few signs or none of the main text, rendering comparison of the sign forms impossible. The only sign from the captions that could be compared in this fashion, DINGIR (signifying 'divinity'), showed no divergence from the sign forms of



128 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
the main text, but admittedly, one sign, and a very common sign at that, cannot provide for rigorous comparison. However, scrutiny of other monuments from Susa that bore self-proclaimed secondary Elamite inscriptions as well as original Babylonian inscriptions revealed that the secondary Elamite inscriptions exhibit unmistakably Elamite, that is, non-Babylonian sign-forms. I studied three such monuments: the Stele of NaramSfn, i.e., MDP III 24 (see also MDP I, pI. II); MDP III 25; MDP IV 164-165 and pI. 17 (which is discussed in Chapter Six, below, artifact B). Particularly prominent are the different forms for the
signs E, NA, ijA, and QA. I also compared the sign forms with those published in Steve's SyUabaire Elamite (1992). Turning back to the Entitlement narus, none of the captions that includes these signs exhibits the Elamite sign-forms; they evince instead the Babylonian forms characteristic of the main inscriptions found on other Entitlement narus.9 The Entitlement narus from Susa have a terminus ad quem determined by the date of Sutruk-Nabbunte's raids into Mesopotamia, ca. 1156, and a geographical range limited by the extent of those raids, i.e., cities in northern Babylonia (see Chapter Two, above, in the section Ancient Setting: Archaeological Evidence). Given the available paleographic evidence, it is likely that the presence of captions on these ten Entitlement narus is a function of chronological and geographical variation within Babylonia rather than secondary Elamite emendation. All the naru fragments with symbol captions were reviewed by Conteneau (1943) in an essay, "Monuments divers: Fragments de kudurru." Taken all together, and assuming that they are correct, captions provide identifications for the symbols of 14 gods and goddesses: Adad, Anu, Ba)u, Ea, Gula, ISbara, Marduk, Nergal, Ningirsu, Nusku, Papsukkal, Sala, Suqamuna, and Zababa.
References in the main text
Four passages in the datable corpus, inscribed on narus dating from the 13th to the 8th centuries, make reference to the complementary roles of the curses and of the symbols. In these passages, the divine symbols carved upon the stone are invoked in parallel to the divine names inscribed in the curses that close the



CHAPTER 4: FORM AND FUNCTION 129
inscription. The earliest passage is found in an inscription of Nazi-Maruttas, that, in addition, details descriptions of 17 divine symbols.

A number of attempts to identify the symbols of the Entitlement naru relief repertoire are based upon this passage; major



130 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
works include Zimmern 1906 (whose analysis was largely rejected by Hinke 1907: 92-6), Steinmetzer 1915 (62-71), and Thureau-Dangin 1919 (135-56). Seidl (1989: 33-35) provides in her study a summary of these efforts and her own conclusions. Even in this passage just cited, where the verbal text seems explicitly to describe the divine symbols and the number of symbols (17) corresponds to the number of descriptions, the repertoire of deities named in the passage does not match the array of symbols carved upon the stele (see also Seidl 1980-83: 276, and Black Green and Rickards 1992: 18-19). Other references to the relief imagery found in the main inscription tell us more about the function of the symbols. Another passage from the Nazi-Maruttas inscription cited above draws a parallel between gods invoked in the curses and gods represented in the imagery:

132 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
An inscription dating to the reign of Marduk-sapik-zeri ( 1081-1069) similarly contains explicit reference to the divine symbols carved upon the stone:
DINGIR.MES! GAL.MES ma-la i-na NA4.NA.RU.A an-ni-i MU.NE.NE za-ak-ru ,~u-un-ni-ir-,~u-nu ud-du-u u-~u-ra-tu-su-nu u~-~u-ra it su-ba-tu-su-nu ba-as-ma i-na bu-ni-su-nu ez-zi-is lik-j erasure }-kel-mu-su-u-ma
However many great gods whose names are invoked, whose emblems are made known, whose designs are drawn, and whose socles are formed upon this (stone) naruMay they look upon him with their countenances furious, and... (Marduk-sapik-zeri ZA 65,76-81)
The latest passage to make explicit reference to the symbols is dated to the reign of Nabu-suma-iskun (ca. 760-748). This nara commemorates a gift of a temple prebend given by two gods of the temple. As observed above in Chapter Two, this inscription is exceptional in that it does not contain the expected series of curses caning upon an array of gods to punish a would-be malefactor. Instead, only the two gods who have awarded the prebend are caned upon by name to assail the potential violator of the nara. Nevertheless, 25 divine symbols are sculpted upon the stone. The particular textual and visual composition of this artifact is reflected in the concluding passage of the curse section:
DINGIR.ME ma-la ina UGU NA4.RU.A an-ni-i ,~ur-,~u-du na-an-za-zu li-bal-liq NUNUZ-,M
However many gods whose socles are set firm upon this (stone) naru-May (t )he(y) annihilate his seed! (NabCi-suma-iskun VAS I 36, vi 2-3)
Rather than recapping the verbal text of the curse section with the standard statement "however many gods whose names are invoked upon this nara," this inscription calls rather upon "however many gods whose socles (i.e., symbols) are set firm upon



CHAPTER 4: FORM AND FUNCTION 133
this nara." Far from being formulaic and empty, the customary phraseology has been manipulated in order to reflect the visual reality of the sculpted stone nara. Nabu-suma-iskun VAS I 36, considered just above, is an example of a nara with divine symbols and no (or restricted) curses, as is also Nabu-apla-iddina BBSt 28. Marduk-nadin-abbe Syria 58, the Warwick "kudurru," is an example of a nara with a relief of the king, but neither visual nor verbal representations of the divine. In the publication of this nara, Lambert (1981: 177) attempted to account for this variation from the norm with recourse to the artifact's small size, suggesting that the lack of symbols was a function of restricted surface area:
Though the top of the Warwick kudurru is missing, sufficient of the height remains to make it very doubtful whether there was room for carved symbols. No doubt one or two could have been squeezed in, but the lack of written curses suggest that in this case no symbols were used.
But this is a non-explanation: even if imposed by limited space, the absence from the same nara of both sculpted symbols and inscribed curses reflects deliberate and coordinated compositional choice. In sum, according to the testimony of the inscriptions, the divine symbols upon the Entitlement naras functioned together with the divine curses was to protect the nara and the entitlement it commemorated.
TEXTUAL REFERENCES TO RELIEF SCENES
Seidl (1980-83: 276) characterized the scenes found in the Entitlement nara reliefs as divine, for example, a procession of divinities; cultic, i.e., humans engaged in ritual activity in the presence of a divinity; or mundane, i.e., humans depicted without any divinity. Entitlement naras sculpted with scenes usually also feature carvings of divine symbols.
Captions associated with relief scenes
Four members of the corpus bear captions associated with a



134 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
relief scene. One dates to the reign of Nabfi-mukln-apli (979944), and three, including BBSt 36, the Sippar Samas Tablet, whose membership in the corpus is defended below in Chapter Six, date to the reign of Nabfi-apla-iddina (mid- to late-9th century). The text of Nabfi-apla-iddina BBSt 28 (fig. 5), a tabletshaped member of the corpus, records a restoration of land by the king. The relief scene, below a band of divine symbols, depicts two figures facing one another. On the right stands a man wearing a crown, royal robes, and holding before him a tall staff which extends the whole height of the relief field. On the left stands a man smaller in stature and without the royal appurtenances of the right-hand figure. Inscribed at the back of the left-hand figure, perpendicular to the main text, is:
~a-lam mdAG-IBILA-SUM-na IBILA mAt-na-a-a Image of Nabfi-apla-iddina, son of Atnayya. (NabCi-apla-iddina BBSt 28, BBSt pI. ClII)
Positioned between the two figures, running along the length of the king's staff, is the caption:
~'IQ-lam mdAG-IBILA-SUM-na LUGAL Image of Nabfi-apla-iddina, king. (NabCi-apla-iddina BBSt 28, BBSt pI. ClII)
The main inscription commemorates that King Nabfi-apla-iddina restored land to Nabfi-apla-iddina, son of Atnayya. According to Seidl (1989: 199), this and other scenes from Neo-Babylonian members of the corpus depict the king facing a subject and a subject facing his king. Whatever precise act is to be understood, the scene clearly depicts the king who granted the entitlement and the party who received it. Another Entitlement naru from this reign, Nabfi-apla-iddina BBSt 29, depicts a similar scene. Two men face one another, one clearly the king and the other not. Although only part of one
caption, "Image of [...J," behind the representation of the king is preserved, it is unlikely that the two figures depicted in the relief represent anyone other than benefactor and beneficiary.

136 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
The relief scene with captions sculpted upon BBSt 36, the Sippar SamaJ Tablet, is explicated in Chapter Six, Debatable Members of the Corpus (Artifact C).
A fourth relief scene with captions is found on Nabu-mukinapli BBSt 9, a roughly quadriform stele with a relief scene in addition to divine symbols (fig. 6). The scene is carved on the uppermost part of two adjoining sides of the stele, and the symbols are sculpted upon the flat top surface of the stele. This Entitlement nara is considered last because its interpretation presents a number of challenges. The left-hand face of the relief scene depicts two persons, a man and a woman, facing right (fig. 7). Both the male and the female figure are shown carrying objects: the woman a bowl and the man a strung bow. On the adjoining right-hand relief surface, facing left toward the images of the man and woman, is a sculpted representation of the king (fig. 8). When the two adjoining faces are viewed simultaneously, the figures of the man and women appear to be approaching the figure of the king (fig. 6). The main text of this Entitlement nara is quite complicated, tracing legal disputes between two families spanning 31 years and the reigns of three different kings, from year two of Ninurtakudurri-u~ur (987-985) to year 25 of Nabfi-mukln-apli (979944; see also Appendix 3 for a summary). The narrative of the inscription relates that the dealings began when Arad-Sebetti, son of Atrattas, killed a slave belonging to Burusa. Arad-Sebetti could not pay Burusa the penalty subsequently imposed upon him by King Ninurta-kudurri-u~ur. Eventually, when a daughter of Arad-Sebetti married a son of Burusa, Arad-Sebetti gave this daughter a field. Narrated consecutively, the passage implies to the reader that Burusa accepted the gift of the field to his new daughter-in-law in compensation for the original injury, i.e., the wrongful death of his slave. After Arad-Sebetti died, his son affirmed the gift of the field to his sister, and abjured male members of the house of Atrattas, that is, the men of his own family, from challenging the gift in the future. This is followed by a difficult passage in which an exchange of goods between the two families is detailed, and both families are enjoined from challenging the terms of what is lastly

138 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
described as a purchase of land. Although details of the final passage remain obscure, the main import of the inscription can be understood. According to the closing of the narrative, Burusa has paid the price and acquired the land. Identifications of the figures in the relief are provided by captions inscribed in close spatial association with the three sculpted humans (figs. 7 and 8). The caption on the left-hand face of the relief (fig. 7), above the sculptures of the man and woman, reads:
~m-Iam mARADJdl[Sehetti mar Atrattacq E N E B A S A L A [ ...]
na-din fdl 15[...]

The caption on the right-hand face (fig. 8), above the relief of the king reads:
~m-lam(!) dAG-GIN-A LUGALSAR

Arad-Sebetti is the man, who by killing his slave, had injured Burusa and owed him a debt, and who gave a field to his own daughter when she married into the family of Burusa. The woman identified as marat Atrattas 'daughter of Atrattas' in the caption need not be interpreted as a literal daughter of Atrattas. The name Atrattas, as it appears in this text in the phrase mar

CHAPTER 4: FORM AND FUNCTION 141
Atratta§ 'son of Atrattas', which is applied equally to both AradSebetti and his son, is a patronymic for the founder of the house, i.e., the line of Bft-Atratta§. Thus, the woman should be identified as a "daughter of the house (or line) of Atrattas.,,16 How are we to understand the relief scene on the N abumukln-apli BBSt 9? Arad-Sebetti, deceased at the time the stele was commissioned, is pictured on the naru, along with a woman of his family line not named in the main inscription; the two stand together facing the king. The two relief scenes with captions reviewed above (Nabu-apla-iddina BBSt 28 and Nabu-apla-iddina BBSt 29) indicate that such scenes depict the king who granted entitlement and the individual who received it. Thus, in other relief scenes from the corpus, it is the party who receives the entitlement that is pictured in the Entitlement naru relief. This conclusion is bolstered by Meli-Sipak MDP X 87, discussed above in Chapter Two and below in the following section, the text of which describes King Meli-Sipak granting an entitlement to his daughter and the relief of which depicts a king leading a woman into the presence of a goddess . Yet in the case of BBSt 9, the text of the main inscription asserts that it is Burusa who, in the end, obtained land from the family of Atrattas. Nonetheless, it is the house of Atrattas that is commemorated in the relief sculpted 0 n this Entitlement naru. Consideration of who stood to gain from the existence of this naru may provide direction for interpreting the overall message of its image and text. It does not seem likely that Burusa, the party that acquired the entitlement, would have set up a naru on behalf of Arad-Sebetti, the party that gave up the entitlement. Rather, because the relief honors the House of Atrattas, prominently depicting the image of (the deceased) Arad-Sebetti, it seems more likely that the naru was in fact set up by the family Atrattas. These two apparently incompatible interpretations may be reconciled with reference to an episode from the narrative. The two families were eventually joined by marriage, and according to the text, the family of Arad-Sebetti gave up to the family of Burusa all future claim to the land given at the time of the marriage. It is possible that the children of the union of the daughter



142 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
of Arad-Sebetti and the son of Burusa could have set up the stele. Because it is they who would have stood eventually to inherit the land, it was in their interest to commemorate the transfer of the property from the House of Atrattas to Burusa, while at the same time showing their grandfather who gave up the entitlement, Arad-Sebetti, in a position of good standing with the king (see also Slanski 2000).
Implicit textual references to relief scenes
Reflections of a common program of compositIon emerge through implicit textual references to the imagery as well. For example, the text of Meli-Sipak MDP X 87, discussed just above and in Chapter Two, records King Meli-Sipak's grant to his daughter, ljunnubat-Nanayya, and includes reference to a nignakku 'censer' set up and maintained before Nanayya. The relief scene depicts a king leading a woman into the presence of a seated goddess, before whom stands a censer. The relief belongs to the category of cultic scenes: the nignakku 'censer' standing between the seated goddess on the one side and the king and princess on the other, signals their entry to the goddess' sacred space (see Seidl 1989: 208). Although there is no caption within the relief field to identify explicitly the scene or its players, the conformity between textual and visual elements encourages us to interpret them complementarily, as did Scheil in the original publication (see MDP X: 87-88; and see also Seidl 1989: 198, and the present study, Chapter Two, pp. 42-53, above). Even without explicit textual reference to the relief images carved upon the nara, we are compelled to interpret the relief scene as depicting Meli-Sipak leading his daughter, ljunnubat-Nanayya, into the presence of the goddess Nanayya. Another example of implicit correspondence between text and relief occurs in a nara from the reign of Nazi-Maruttas, NaziMaruttas RA 66 (see above, pp. 70-4). In this inscription, Gula, a goddess associated with affliction and healing, is invoked in the prominent final position in the series of curses (for the concept of positional prominence, see Silk 1974, esp. pp. 67-71, and this study pp. 39-40, 61). The colophon of the inscription explains that the nara itself was set up in the presence of Gula. The relief



CHAPTER 4: FORM AND FUNCTION 143
carved upon the nara depicts a dog, Gula's symbol, sculpted very large relative to the usual size of divine symbols found upon the Entitlement naras. The image of the dog is set, moreover, in the center of the relief field. Although the stele is broken and missing its uppermost part, given the extant monument, no projected restoration could negate the validity of these observations (see Margueron 1972: 148-51 for photographs of the nara and discussion of its relief carvings). Although the inscription of the nara makes no explicit reference to its imagery, it is clear that the text and the relief were both composed with an eye to signaling the pre-eminence of the goddess Gula.
CONCLUSIONS
The verbal and visual expressions of the Babylonian Entitlement naras combine to achieve a specific and uniform function: to commemorate acquisition of entitlement and to ensure that the entitlement is permanent, i.e., hereditary. Clearly, the text and the imagery of individual Entitlement naras were composed and executed with consideration of one another. Examination of the inter-relationship between the inscriptions and the reliefs reveals a number of points of contact between the two media. The inscriptions make explicit and implicit reference to the imagery carved upon the Entitlement naras. Captions inscribed in spatial association with specific symbols and figures, textual references to the imagery occurring within the main inscriptions, and implicit dialogue between image and text, argue for interpreting the two different media as complementary components of a deliberately integrated design. Yet, it is also clear that the verbal text and the pictorial imagery were not simply reflections of one another. It is through a harmonized analysis of the verbal and visual features, as well as consideration of their setting and material, that a full understanding of the function of the Entitlement nara can be achieved. The operative division of the inscriptions validates the recipient's claim to the entitlement by providing background narratives as well as an account of the entitlement event, i.e., grant, affirma



144 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
tion, purchase, adjudication, or a combination of these processes. A critical aspect of the entitlement event is the acquisition of a legal document bearing the royal seal. As illustrated by passages from the inscriptions, failure to secure such a sealed document left the entitlement vulnerable to claims from other parties, and could preclude the entitlement from being inherited. By preserving in an immutable stone inscription an account of the sealing and a record of the witnesses to the sealing, the Entitlement naru offered an indestructible version of the sealed clay tablet, and was vital to ensuring that the entitlement event marked a permanent acquisition and that the entitlement could be inherited. The imprecative division seeks to protect the entitlement through a series of prohibitions and curses. Prohibitions enumerate ways in which the entitlement was not to be transgressed; prominent among these is interdiction against harming the very naru upon which account of the entitlement was inscribed. Durability of the Entitlement naru was thus believed to ensure durability of the entitlement. This belief is illustrated as well by the names given to individual Entitlement narus, reviewed above in Chapter Two, that allude to the protective role of the naru, such as, "the name of the monument is 'DN protect the enduring boundary' ," or simply, "Protector (is) its name." Divine curses, which make up the remainder of the imprecative division, call upon the gods to punish the would-be evildoer who would transgress the prohibitions. According to phrases summarizing the curses, the divine symbols sculpted upon the Entitlement narus functioned in tandem with the curses to ensure that the entitlement event commemorated by the naru was both legally and cosmically binding. Terms used to refer to the divine symbols, alesirtu 'sanctuary', kakku 'weapon', mlnanziizu '(cosmic- )station,, subtu 'socle', surlnu/Sunnirru 'emblem', u.Jurtu 'design', are attested outside of the Entitlement naru inscriptions as well. Taken all together, as deployed in various contexts within and without the corpus, these expressions circumscribe a set of abstractions invoking notions of cultic space and fixtures, divinatory portents, divine emblems, and astrological/astronomical stations. The Mesopotamians left



CHAPTER 4: FORM AND FUNCTION 145
behind no treatises about abstract thought, and investigation of these terms for 'symbol', while desirable, lies beyond the scope of the present investigation. For our purposes, it is important to recognize that the verbal terms applied to the visual representations of the gods upon the Entitlement narus are imbued with meanings for sign, portent, and the sacred. Selection and deployment of the visual symbols were not bound to the verbal curses, as demonstrated by the fact that on no Entitlement naru does the array of gods invoked verbally in the curses correspond fully to the panoply of gods represented visually by the images. As observed in the previous chapter, there are six Entitlement narus without divine symbols, and the inscription
of only one of these includes divine curses. 17 Thus, with one exception, Entitlement narus lacking divine symbols also lack divine curses, a circumstance that supports the correlation proposed here between the function of the symbols and the function of the curses. Moreover, the typical Entitlement naru inscription, which does include a sequence of divine curses, also features a litany of fantastic prohibitions against violating the entitlement and harming the naru. In contrast, the prohibitions found in the Entitlement narus with neither divine symbols nor divine curses are limited to pragmatic dangers of legalistic action brought by members of the families involved in the transaction. These legal penalties, enumerating a series of negative consequences for a would-be transgressor, may be seen as functionally analogous to the divine curses. In general, it appears that Entitlement narus featuring divine symbols will have a correspondingly divine orientation to their text, and Entitlement narus without divine symbols will be consistently less extravagant in their concern with fantastic transgressions and other-worldly retribution. There is an additional correlation between what we may call the 'worldly' and the 'other-worldly' characteristics of the Entitlement narus and the physical form of the artifact. Each of the five texts without divine curses is inscribed upon a tabletshaped stone rather than a stele. The stones are shaped with a flat obverse and a convex reverse, and they are inscribed so as to be turned end-to-end. In other words, they mimic closely the physical configuration of inscribed clay tablets. However, these are not



146 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
the only tablet-shaped members of the corpus. Other tabletshaped Entitlement naras do feature both divine symbols and divine curses. Rather than being inscribed so as to be turned end-toend like a tablet, however, these artifacts are inscribed to be turned side-to-side. This may represent a compromise in form, conceived to enable the reader to maintain the divine imagery always in an upright orientation. Relief scenes function similarly to the verbal narrative present in the operative division of some inscriptions. The scenes depict the entitlement recipient in a position of good standing with a king or god, reinforcing the royal and divine sanction of the entitlement, and thereby validating visually the entitlement recipient's claim. In the same way that cultic relief scenes on royal stelae reenact in perpetuity a moment representative of the relationship between king and god, these scenes on the Entitlement naras can be seen as re-creating a moment emblematic of the relationship between the parties participating in the entitlement event. These conclusions differ in scope and emphasis from those of Buccellati (1994) and of Gelb, Steinkeller, and Whiting (1991), who see the function of the artifacts to be the publication of changes in property rights and to play consequently a role in maintaining relationships among members of the community. Such an interpretation is based on the content of the operative division of the inscriptions, reflecting an understanding of the artifacts as legal records that have been, by analogy with widespread contemporary and ancient social practice, publicly posted. While such a role certainly was performed by the Entitlement naras, it accounts only for one aspect of their overall function. The unique form of the Entitlement nara communicates content information through its verbal text, its visual imagery, and the inter-relationship between the two media. The overall impact of these coordinated communications, as well as the Entitlement nara's physical manifestation in stone and its setting in a temple, combined to generate a meta-message that was weighted more toward the long-term durability of the entitlement rather than to its one-time acquisition. In this way, the form of the Entitlement nara aligns itself more closely with the genre of royal monuments



CHAPTER 4: FORM AND FUNCTION 147
than with legal records of title. Further comparison of the Entitlement narus with royal monuments is taken up below, in Chapter Seven, where socio-political implications of the form's innovation in the 14th century are also considered. When taken all together, the inter-related messages of text, imagery, physical form and setting functioned not only to record acquisition of an entitlement, but more significantly sought to ensure that the entitlement remain inviolable, inheritable, and permanent.
li-su-u-um? We expect i-su-u for the MB form isu. I cannot explain this writing with -UM; perhaps an archaism, i.e., the OB form isum? (see note 5, below). 2Recall that pilku can designate both 'border' and 'territory'; see discussion above in Chapter Two, p. 52. 3See discussion of this phrase below, pp. 121-2. 4Entitlement naru inscriptions tend to be somewhat archaizing, both in their language and in their paleography, see Hyatt 1941: 59, n. 22. Most of the texts cited thus far in the present study have presented regular case distinctions and other vocalic endings conforming to rules of Old Babylonian Akkadian. In this text, however, dated to the seventh century, vocalic endings conform to expected Neo-Babylonian orthographic conventions, Le., failing to distinguish orthographically among cases; for which see GAG §63e; Hyatt 1941: esp. pp. 22-23; and Woodington 1982: 63-65. Thus, in this passage, the prepositions sa and aHu are followed by Infinitive forms in the Genitive case written pa-qa-ru and ra-ga-mu. 5The Preterite form i-zi-hu and the Precative form lu-zi-hu present a slightly different situation than the case vowels of the Infinitives pa-qa-ru and raga-mu described in the previous note, although they are similarly subject to Neo-Babylonian orthography regarding final short vowels. Hence, fa i-zi-hu is an acceptable writing for Ita lzihl 'he could not leave' and tu-zi-hu is an acceptable writing for IlUzihl 'that I may leave'. See Hyatt 1941: esp. 23. 60n the reading of DIS-u as gi#u 'wooden writing board', see pp. 78-9 in Chapter Three, above. 7See, for example, two pieces in the Louvre: the fragmentary Sb 3226 (Hinke 1907: figs. 17-18), and Sb 25, a stele-shaped naru with relief carvings and a surface prepared with lines but no inscription (see Seidl 1989: 30-31, Nr. 40, Abb. 4, and Taf. 18a). 8They are, in the order of first publication, Sb 3224 (MDP I 167-170 [fig.

Chapter Five
A Formal Definition for the Babylonian Entitlement narus
Since their discovery and decipherment, the artifacts investigated in this study have been considered members of a single artifactual genre. Yet a formal definition for the objects has been wanting-perhaps because their immediately observable physical and inscriptional features lent them so easily to impressionistic rather than criteria-based grouping. Absence of a formal definition has posed an obstacle to scholars studying the corpus as a whole; without such a definition discussion of genre is limited, and classification of debatable artifacts is unrealizable. In the article "kudurru," appearing in the Reallexikon der Assyriologie, Brinkman (1980-83: 269) wrote that
over the years scholars working with the genre as a whole, either from a philological or archeological point of view (e.g., Hinke, King, Steinmetzer, Seidl) have not generally agreed on precisely which objects should be formally classified as kudurrus.
The entry also noted that "the differences are minor (affecting, for the most part, less than a half dozen exemplars) and of little significance here." But whereas Brinkman had only a few pages in which to evaluate the objects and their place in Mesopotamian civilization, the present study is in a position to formulate in detail a descriptive and functional definition of the genre. Moreover, this investigation has the opportunity to consider artifacts for
149



150 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
which membership in the corpus is disputable, a task undertaken in the following chapter. The previous chapters demonstrate concrete ways in which the artifacts do constitute a cohesive genre, one in which individual features can be isolated and investigated. This chapter presents a formal definition of the BabyIonian Entitlement naras, based upon their physical, inscriptional, and iconographic features and incorporating an interpretation of their ancient function. It may seem odd to present a definition at this late point in the study rather than at the beginning. In light of the classificatory problems caused by the artifacts having been designated kudurrus 'boundary stones' and the resultant confusion hampering assessment of their ancient function, before presenting a formal definition it was necessary to begin with analysis of their inscriptions and imagery as well as observations about their archeological provenance. To minimize repetition, the reader is referred to preceding chapters for detailed discussions of the material summarized here. The following formal definition incorporates the ancient designation of the artifacts, their function, the chronological and geographic parameters of the known corpus, and systematic description of their physical, textual, and iconographic features. Chapter Six, which follows, analyzes against the background of this definition three artifacts whose status vis-a-vis the corpus has been debated, along with a fourth that has yet to be evaluated in regard to the genre.
NATIVE DESIGNATION
According to their inscriptions, the stone artifacts known to modern Assyriologists as kudurru were known to the ancient Babylonians as nara, '(stone) stele' or '(stone) monument'. The inscriptions of the artifacts clearly distinguish between the entity kudurru, 'boundary', by extension 'boundary marker' or 'territory circumscribed by a border', and the entity nara, '(stone) stele' or '(stone) monument'. Moreover, the inscriptions inform us that these particular naras were sculpted and inscribed and were placed in temples-information that corresponds to



CHAPTER 5: FORMAL DEFINITION 151
features of the extant monuments and evidence for their original indigenous setting. In three instances, twice in the inscription of Meli-Sipak BBSt 3 and once in Meli-Sipak BBSt 4, the artifacts are referred to as kudurru. All three instances are found in two inscriptions of a single king, both of which are inscribed on naras recovered from the city of Sippar. Use of the word kudurru in this way thus seems to have been restricted to a specific point in both time and space, and can be considered exceptional. The unexpected occurrence of the term kudurru in contexts otherwise reserved for the term nara may reflect a conceptual identification of the kudurru 'border' as wen as 'territory enclosed by a border', with the physical nara, 'monument' that served to maintain or protect the border and the territory it defined. Chapter Two of the present study investigated Babylonian designations for the artifacts. Explicit and implicit textual references to the artifacts were analyzed and evaluated against their physical, textual, and visual characteristics.
FUNCTION
Analysis of their inscriptions reveals that the naras under investigation commemorate the acquisition or affirmation of an entitlement to an on-going source of income. By means of verbal and visual representations of the gods, the nara was intended to protect and preserve the right to that entitlement for an time. The expression 'Entitlement nara' was coined by this study-a term incorporating their ancient designation and describing their unique function within the larger category of Mesopotamian artifacts known as naras. The designation Entitlement nara can be applied consistently and accurately to every member of the corpus. Chapters Three and Four investigated the texts and the reliefs of the artifacts to determine their ancient function. A typology based upon subject of their inscriptions was derived in Chapter Three, followed by an analysis of the structure of the inscriptions. Chapter Four furthered the inquiry into function by comparing



152 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
the different types of subjects commemorated and by investigating the relationship between the verbal texts and the visual Imagery.
PHYSICAL FEATURES
Material
The artifacts are fashioned out of stone, a fact reflected in their native Akkadian designation, naru, a word borrowed from the Sumerian (NA4.)NA.RU(.A), meaning something like 'erected stone'; see Chapter Seven, below, for a discussion of the etymology and cultural resonance of the term naru in Mesopotamia. Moreover, Akkadian naru is regularly written both within and without this corpus with the cuneiform determinative element NA4, signifying 'stone'. At the time of Seidl's 1989 pub
lication, the type of stone had been determined for 100 Entitlement narus and fragments. Of those 100, 95 are limestone, 53 of which were described as dark (grey-to-black) and bituminous, 25 that were described as light (white-to-yellow), with the color of the remaining 17 not known. Four of the artifacts are fashioned from diorite, and one is red granite. 1 Evidence for Entitlement narus manufactured from clay is slight but significant. The inscription of an Entitlement naru dating to the reign of the Kassite dynasty, Nazi-Maruttas MDP II 86, closes by explaining that it is a replacement for a naru §a ba$bi, a "naru of clay," that was broken when a wall collapsed upon it; later, an individual, presumably the heir to the entitlement, inscribed nara §a abni e§§a gabare labiri, a "new naru of stone-a copy of the old one," and erected it in the sanctuary. There are two extant objects that might well be identified as naru §a ba$bi. Fashioned out of rough clay in the shape of inverted cones, the two artifacts are duplicates, virtually identical in shape and size. The better preserved was published by King (1912) in Babylonian Boundary Stones and is familiarly known as BBSt 1. Each of these clay objects bears the same inscription, the text of which enables dating them to the reign of KadasmanEnlil, most likely Kadasman-Enlil I (1374(7)-1360) rather than



CHAPTER 5: FORMAL DEFINITION 153
Kadasman-Enlil II (1263-1255; see Brinkman 1980-83: 269). If the stone Entitlement nara Kurigalzu BBSt 2 is eventually to be dated to Kurigalzu II (1332-1308) rather than Kurigalzu I (c. 1390), then these two terra-cottas, provisionally identified as 'naras of clay', potentially are older than any of the datable stone examples. Kadasman-Enlil BBSt 1 was included in the corpus by Steinmetzer (1922: 3-4) as No. 1 (L. 1) and by Brinkman (1980-83: 269) as a clay example of the genre. Nonetheless, the objects were not included by Seidl in her archaeologically and art-historically driven study. A treatment of the text of Kadasman-Enlil BBSt 1, along with an edition of its previously unpublished duplicate, is presented below in Chapter Six (Artifacts A).
Shape
Steinmetzer, In his 1922 study of the corpus, differentiated between "Phallussteine," 'Phallus-stones' and "Steintafeln," 'Stone-tablets' (Steinmetzer 1922: 92-93).2 Seidl (1989: 67-68) rejected Steinmetzer' s "Phallussteine" designation, objecting that this characterization originated with Steinmetzer, not the Babylonians, and that Mesopotamians of the second millennium could clearly depict phalloi when they so chose. Seidl proposed instead a chronologically driven two-phase scheme for analyzing the shapes of the artifacts:
i) Those from the 14th to 11th centuries (Seidl's first through eighth style groups-for which see below in this chapter under Development of the relief imagery). Stelae occur in a variety of shapes: quadriform, shaped into pyramids or cones at the top, or with diagonal cut, or in an irregular "GeroHstein," i.e., 'boulder' -shape. By-forms occur in between with no evidence of evolution.
ii) Those from the 11 th through 7th centuries ( eighth through tenth groups). This phase sees the introduction of the tablet-shaped stone in the 11th century, as well as the stele with flattened sides and frequently rounded-top in the 9th



154 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
century. The 'boulder' -shape returns in a few examples toward the end of the life span of the genre.
In her entries for individual monuments, Seidl designated the stelae with flattened sides as "Plattenformig," and included them in the category of stelae as opposed to the category of stone tablets. This study places the "Plattenformig" stelae into a third category for shape, that is, 'plaques', alongside the categories of stelae and tablets. Entitlement narus of the uncontested corpus thus present three different physical shapes: stelae, tablets, and plaques. Stele-shaped stones are 36 in number, or 59 percent of the datable corpus. They are attested throughout the entire life time of the genre, from Kurigalzu I (early 14th century) or II (1332-1308) to Sargon II (king of Babylonia 709-705). The stele-shape was used to commemorate every type of entitlement event attested: royal grant of land, temple prebend, exemptions, non-royal grant of land or prebend, and non-royal land purchase. Stele-shaped Entitlement narus stand upright and are taller than they are wide or deep. Complete stelae range in height from 36 cm (Meli-Sipak BBSt 4) to 91.5 cm (Merodach-baladan I BBSt 5). The stelae have been characterized as boulders or 'Gerollsteine', terminology giving, perhaps, a misleading impression that they had been left in a naturally occurring state. A stele-shaped Entitlement naru is inscribed and sculpted over its entire surface. Typically, the inscription runs from top to bottom in parallel vertical columns. Individual lines of text are separated by single horizontal lines, and the signs are oriented in lines parallel to the ground. In one partially published member of the corpus, Meli-Sipak MDP II 112 (for which see also Slanski 1997: 210-21 and fig. 6),3 the inscription runs around the circumference of the stele at a right angle to the ground, as in, for example, the text inscribed on the Law Stele of !Jammurapi. All complete and most fragmentary stele-shaped Entitlement narus bear imagery, and it seems likely that stele fragments preserving only text probably originally had relief sculptures that have been lost. Divine symbols occupy a field located either at the top of the stele, above the text, or on one side. Beginning with



CHAPTER 5: FORMAL DEFINITION 155
the reign of Meli-Sipak, divine symbols are deployed on one face of the stele and are arranged in ranks. Relief scenes depicting human or human and divine figures typically occur on a single face. On one quadriform stele, Nabfi-mukln-apli BBSt 9, human figures face one another across the edge joining two sides (see figs. 6-8 and discussion above, Chapter Four, pp. 136-42). Tablet-shaped Entitlement narus date from the reign of IttiMarduk-balatu (1139-1132) to Marduk-zakir-sumi (mid-ninth century). They were used to commemorate the full range of entitlements exhibited by the artifacts. Tablet-shaped Entitlement narus are much smaller than stelae, small enough to be held comfortably in the hand, and range in height (length) from 7 to 17.5 cm. They have been carved to resemble the shape of clay tablets-flat on the obverse and slightly convex on the reverse. Their text is inscribed in a single column. Tablet-shaped Entitlement narus are 12 in number, constituting just less than twenty percent of the datable corpus. Some tablet-shaped Entitlement narus exhibit relief sculptures and some do not. Of those without carved imagery most do not have divine curses in their inscriptions. The exception is Samassuma-ukln AID 16, treated below in Chapter Six. The text of another artifact in this category, Enlil-nadin-apli BE lI83, has a short series of blessings instead of curses. Tablet-shaped Entitlement narus with relief imagery exhibit either a scene and symbols on the obverse or a scene on the obverse and a band occupied by divine symbols running around the top of the tablet on both the obverse and reverse sides, as does N abfi-apla-iddina BBSt 28 (see fig. 5 in the previous chapter). Most tablet-shaped Entitlement narus are inscribed in the fashion of clay tablets; reaching the end of the inscription on the obverse, the reader must tum the tablet end-to-end to continue reading on the reverse. A few are inscribed so as to be turned side-to-side, and this variation may be a function of their relief sculptures. Tabletshaped stones on which a continual band of relief imagery runs around the obverse and reverse are inscribed so as to be turned side-to-side rather than end-to-end; turning the stone side-to-side keeps the stone oriented with the divine symbols always at the top.



156 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
Plaque-shaped Entitlement narus present a hybrid form, exhibiting features of both the stele and the tablet shapes. As is the case with the stele-shaped Entitlement narus, plaque-shaped members of the corpus are too large to be held in the hand, yet have been shaped in the manner of a tablet with flattened obverse and reverse sides. Moreover, some of the plaque-shaped Entitlement narus have been sculpted so as to mimic the flat obverse and convex reverse sides characteristic of clay tablets e.g., Marduk-zakir-sumi RA 16, on display in the Louvre (fig. 9a, b). They have reliefs either on the obverse, or on the upper part with a band of divine symbols running around the top, or along the top edge. They are not inscribed so as to be turned end-to-end like tablets; rather, like stelae, they are inscribed from top-to-bottom. Some exhibit a rounded top, indicating that they were, in fact, intended to stand upright like stelae and to be viewed from all sides. There are five plaque-shaped Entitlement narus in the datable corpus, including Nabfi-apla-iddina BBSt 36, the Sippar Samas Tablet, which is carved with a ribbed edge all the way around (see Artifact C in Chapter Six, below).4 This shape accounts for only eight percent of the datable corpus. The earliest example dates to Marduk-zakir-sumi (mid-ninth century) and the latest to Samas-suma-ukln, the Neo-Assyrian king who ruled Babylonia from 667-648, and the latest reign attested in the genre.
Size
As Seidl (1989) observed in her study, size of the artifacts is also a function of their shape, that is, stele-shaped examples are larger than their tablet-shaped counterparts. Although generating statistics for size is hampered by the fragmentary condition of many of the artifacts, Seidl nonetheless did perceive a general decrease in size over time. Having assigned the artifacts to ten different style groups based on their relief imagery (summarized below, under Development of the relief imagery), Seidl then assigned the style groups to three diachronic stages according to SIze:

158 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
I) 46.5 cm to 91.5 cm: artifacts assigned to Seidl's First through the Fifth style groups (approximately 15th century to 1155);
II) 36 cm to 65 cm: artifacts assigned to the Sixth through the Seventh style groups (approximately 1125 to 1046);
III) 15 cm to 45.8 cm: artifacts assigned to the Eighth through the Tenth style groups (approximately 1068 to 648).
Tablet-shaped stones, much smaller than artifacts in the steleshape, first appear in the corpus in the late 12th century. Tabletshaped stones with reliefs were all assigned by Seidl to her eighth through tenth style groups. It should be noted that tablet-shaped stones without reliefs were not assigned to style groups by Seidl, and presumably are not incorporated into her three-stage scheme for overall size. Members of the corpus discovered or published since 1968 support Seidl's observations that, in general, the size of the artifacts, as gauged by height, tends to decrease over time.
Other physical feature: field plans.
Three stelae (Nebuchadnezzar I, the Hinke "kudurru," Adadapla-iddina BBSt 25, and the undated stele fragment BBSt 15), and two tablet-shaped Entitlement narus (Adad-apla-iddina BBSt 26 and an unpublished piece dating to Adad-apla-iddina in a private collection), exhibit field plans or maps of granted land. The topographical features of the unpublished plan are accompanied by labels, including field measurements. Maps are thus first attested under Nebuchadnezzar I, with three of the five examples appearing on Entitlement narus dated to the reign of Adad-apla-iddina.



CHAPTER 5: FORMAL DEFINITION 159
CHRONOLOGICAL AND GEOGRAPHIC LIMITS
Time ...
The earliest datable Entitlement narus originate in the time of the Kassite Dynasty. BBSt 2 is attributed to a king Kurigalzu; if it is Kurigalzu I, then this could be as early as the late 1400s, and if it is Kurigalzu II, then it can be assigned to the years 1332-1308. BBSt 1, a clay example of the genre (see Physical features, above in this chapter and Artifacts A in the following chapter), is dated to the reign of Kadasman-Enlil I (1374 (?)-1360) or KadasmanEnlil II (1263-1255), and so may be earlier than BBSt 2. The latest Entitlement narus are dated to the reign of Samas-suma-ukln, Neo-Assyrian king who ruled Babylonia from 667 to 648. Thus, Entitlement narus are attested from at least the mid-14th to mid7th century. In the intervening years, some reigns are represented by multiple Entitlement narus and others by none. According to Brinkman (1980-83: 269):
(T)he majority of the datable kudurrus (come) from a span of about 140 years (c. 1186-1047) from the time of Meli-Sipak (1186-1172), toward the close of the Kassite dynasty, down through the reign of Adad-apla-iddina (1068-1047) just as the decline of the Second Dynasty of Isin begins.
The "majority" in this reckoning corresponds to 37 out of 65 known datable examples (Appendix 1). The rest include nine Entitlement narus preceding Meli-Sipak, from the mid-14th century to 1186, and 19 Entitlement narus dating to a 400-year period from the last king of the Isin II Dynasty, Marduk-abbeeriba (mid-11th century) down to Samas-suma-ukln (667-648). Within the post-Isin II period, there are two gaps of approximately 100 years from which we have no Entitlement narus, the first from the mid-tenth to the mid-ninth centuries (between and exclusive of the reigns of Nabfi-mukln-apli and NabCt-apla-iddina), and the second from the mid-ninth to mideighth centuries (between and exclusive of the reigns of Mardukzakir-sumi and Nabfi-suma-iskun).



160 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
...and Space
The geographic range of the Entitlement narus, as reconstructed from findspots of the artifacts and from the regions named in their inscriptions, includes all of Babylonia (Seidl 1989: 69-71). The majority of the early members of the corpus, those dated to the reigns of the 12th-IIth century Kassite kings, are concerned with lands in the northern and eastern parts of Babylonia. Brinkman (1980-83: 269) noted a change over time in the locus of lands commemorated by the narus:
By the 12th cent. many of the place names mentioned in the kudurrus seem to be in tribal areas, especially east of the Tigris. Beginning with the Second Dynasty of the Sealand, the geographical focus shifts-with almost all documents coming from the south and the west, and the north and the east practically unrepresented.
Thus, regarding the distribution of the Entitlement narus, Brinkman (1980-83: 269), with the inevitable caution that, "(i)f some day other areas and eras are better attested, the resultant picture may be different," emphasized:
the restricted nature of the present corpus-approximately 150 examples known to date and clustered principally in confined time-space coordinates, i.e., the northern and eastern sections of Babylonia between 1186 and 1047 B.C.
Nonetheless, Entitlement narus and naru fragments have been found in the southern cities of Larsa, Uruk, and Ur (see Appendix 2). It may be that the raids of Sutruk-Nabbunte, which struck the northern parts of Babylonia in the mid-12th century, have skewed the distribution pattern in favor of Kassite Dynasty period Entitlement narus originating in northern Babylonia.
RELIEF IMAGERY
The distinct imagery of the Entitlement naru reliefs are probably their most characteristic and recognizable feature. Carved imagery appears on all complete stele- and plaque-shaped Entitlement narus, and is probably to be expected on fragmentary



CHAPTER 5: FORMAL DEFINITION 161
examples that no longer evince any such traces. Sculpted reliefs appear as well on six of the 12 tablet-shaped Entitlement narus. This study is indebted to Ursula Seidl's 1989 book-length treatment of the relief imagery, a publication that is the most comprehensive source for information about the Entitlement naru reliefs. With a few additional observations, the following remarks are based upon Seidl's work.
Divine Symbols
Seidl (1980-83: 275) divided the relief compositions into a simple, two-part typology: divinities (i.e., divine symbols) and scenes. As the divine symbols constitute the majority of naru relief imagery, the major part of Seidl's study is devoted to their investigation.
Origin of the symbols. According to Seidl (1989: 210-11), the imagery exhibited by the reliefs is rooted firmly in traditional Mesopotamian iconography:
The first great creative period for artistic forms that remained viable for later Mesopotamian iconography, was the Akkadian Period.... Because the first Babylonian kudurrus emerged in the second half of the Kassite Dynasty in Mesopotamia, the question is raised regarding possible specific "Kassite forms." Only three symbols represent Kassite gods ... all the other repeatedly represented relief elements of the kudurrus ...derive from the general Mesopotamian pictorial repertoire. The kudurru-stone masons created no new symbols, their contribution consisted rather in the selection, combination, and ordering of the traditional forms.
Seidl concluded that with the few exceptions in which new symbols were developed to accommodate the Kassite dynastic gods, the symbols found on the Entitlement narus are indigenously Mesopotamian, with some extending back as early as the third millennium.
Development of the relief imagery. Seidl (1989: 75-93) assigned individual Entitlement narus to ten groups based on the style of the relief imagery. Note that the dates used here follow Brinkman 1977a and so differ slightly from those in Seidl. Also, this study follows Brinkman (1976b) rather than Seidl in not

Nabfi-suma-iskun to Samas-suma-ukln ca. 760-648
As indicated by the designations given to these ten groups, Seidl proposed that a binding program, or canon, developed toward the end of the Kassite period. This canon dictated subsequent composition, selection, and deployment of divine symbols upon the Entitlement narus. The divine representations and symbols appearing in the reliefs thus fall into two main divisions. Imagery of the earlier reliefs i.e., the First Type (erste Art), consisting of what Seidl termed the "pre-," "proto-," and "paracanonic" styles, is evidenced in reliefs dating from the period prior to the reign of Kurigalzu (I ca. 1390; II 1332-1308) to the



CHAPTER 5: FORMAL DEFINITION 163
reign of Enlil-nadin-a1}1}e (1157-1155). Imagery characteristic of the later reliefs, i.e., the Second Type (zweite Art), or the "canonic" style, is attested in Entitlement narus beginning with the reign of Meli-Sipak (1168-1172). (For a critique of Seidl's canonical scheme, see Borker-Klahn 1982: 51-52.) In the relief sculptures of the First Group, preceding the reign of Meli-Sipak, representations of heavenly bodies, anthropomorphic deities, walking man-beasts, gesturing lion-men, animals, tools, and staves with animal heads appear to be employed freely amongst one another. During the reign of Meli-Sipak, the striding hybrid man-beasts and gesturing lion-men disappear, and only images of pure divinities remain. Various symbols and attributes of the gods were combined so that each divinity was represented by only a single-sometimes complex-image. A few symbols were mounted upon socles. Although the creators of this canon were able to take over many representations from traditional Mesopotamian iconography, a few symbols were created anew, such as the horned crowns-regular headgear of Mesopotamian deities-that were now placed upon socles to represent the high gods of the pantheon, Anu and Enlil. According to Seidl, some of the innovated representations required explanation, leading to the advent of inscribed captions found on a few of the naru relief fields. 6 (The phenomenon of these captions is discussed above in Chapter Four.) The canon for representing divinities on Entitlement narus, established, according to Seidl, in north or east Babylonia at the end of the Kassite dynasty, was, with few changes, adhered to by the later members of the genre. Almost always represented were the gods Sin, Samas, IStar, Anu, Enlil, Ea, Nin1}ursag, Marduk, Nabfi, Gula, Ninurta, Nergal, Zababa, Adad, Nuska, IS1}ara, and IStaran. In addition, a symbol for the Kassite god ijarbe/a appears in Entitlement narus dating to the Kassite Dynasty. The Kassite dynastic gods Suqamfina and Sumaliyya are represented on Entitlement narus dating to the Kassite and Isin II Dynasties.7
Hierarchical deployment of the divine symbols. Seidl observed that, to a certain extent, the divine symbols were deployed upon



164 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
the Entitlement narus according to the deities' relative posItIons in the pantheon. The symbols for the higher gods of the pantheon, i.e., Anu, Enlil, Ea, Samas, Sin, and IStar, are generally found upon or toward the top and most prominent part of the monument. Deities lower in the pantheon are deployed toward the bottom of the relief field. Consequently, changes in the relative positioning of the symbols may reflect changes in the pantheon. One illustration of this phenomenon is the apparent displacement of the symbols for Anu and Enlil by the symbols for Marduk and Nabfi at the end of the eighth century. Other scholars, while cautious in applying this theory absolutely, see potential in Seidl's observation for illuminating developments in
late second- and early first-millennia Babylonian religion.s I think there is good potential for discerning correlations between the relative ranking of symbols on the stones and the relative ranking of the gods. But the relationship is complex, and numerous considerations having to do with the nature of individual gods, with the nature of individual symbols, and with the setting and message of individual Entitlement narus must be kept in mind. For example, the symbols for the gods Samas, Sin, and IStar, the sun, moon, and Venus star, respectively, are all "sky" symbols, and are almost without exception deployed at the uppermost surface of the naru-in keeping possibly with their celestial character rather than with supreme position in the pantheon. It is useful in this context to consider patterns in which the gods are ordered in the curses of the inscriptions. Variations in the typical ordering of the gods featured in the curses may be linked with particular concerns of the patron of the naru. For example, the gods Anu and Enlil are usually the first gods invoked in the curses, followed, with some variation, by Ea, Ninurta, Marduk, IStar, Adad, Gula, etc. However, in the curse section of Nazi-Maruttas MDP II 86, Marduk is the first god invoked by name, followed thereafter by Anu, Enlil, Ea, etc. (The curse section of this inscription is cited in the previous chapter.) Placing Marduk before Anu and Enlil in exception to the expected pattern may be explained by reference to the operative division of the inscription. There, a gift of land to the god



CHAPTER 5: FORMAL DEFINITION 165
Marduk is prominently recorded. In the case of this naru, Marduk plays a principal role as the recipient of the entitlement, and this may be the reason for his being the first god invoked in the curses closing this particular naru. Similar factors may be at work behind the arrangement of symbols on other individual narus.
Finally, I think we have to take the artistry of the sculptor into account. The god IStaran is not known as an important god in the period of the Entitlement narus. Yet his symbol, the snake, appears pre-eminently on almost every member of the corpus-across the top of the relief field, down the side, or curled up at the very apex of a stele. It seems that the artistic potential of the long and flexible serpent body provided the sculptor with an opportunity to exhibit his creativity-even playfulness-in design as well as his skill in execution.
Relief scenes. Relatively little work has been done with the relief scenes. Seidl (1989: 206-8) characterized the scenes as (I) battle against hybrid men-beasts; (2) procession of gods to a divine symbol; (3) cult scene; and (4) investment scene. Only categories (3) and (4) are attested on datable monuments and are discussed in this study. Cultic scenes depict the king and the beneficiary of the entitlement engaged in cultic activity; investment scenes depict the king and the entitlement beneficiary outside of a cultic setting, perhaps reflecting the king and his subject at the moment the entitlement was conferred. Seidl (1989: 209) rightfully noted that "Belehnung" 'investment', borrowed from the vocabulary of Medieval European feudalism, is an anachronistic term and concept to apply to second- and first-millennia Babylonia. (The question of Babylonian 'feudalism' in the context of the Entitlement narus is taken up in Chapter Seven.) Because the scenes shed important light on the relationship between the images and the inscriptions and on the function of the Entitlement narus, part of the preceding chapter is devoted to their explication.
Function of the divine symbols and the relief scenes. According to passages from the inscriptions, the symbols served



166 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
to protect and preserve the naru and the entitlement it commemorated, operating in tandem with the divine curses of the inscription. This is further supported by the observation that, with one exception, Samas-suma-ukln AIO 16, discussed below in Chapter Six (Artifact D), tablet-shaped stones without relief imagery do not have curses in their inscriptions. It should be emphasized that the symbols do not serve as divine witnesses to the transaction; witnessing is a specific legal act performed by named individuals who were present at the entitlement event. Record of witnesses present at the sealing of a tablet documenting the entitlement event is permanently preserved by the Entitlement naru inscription. The cultic and mundane scenes of the naru reliefs represent visually the parties who participated in the entitlement event, usually the king granting the entitlement and the recipient. (An apparent exception to this pattern is Nabu-mukln-apli BBSt 9, for which see the discussion in the previous chapter, under Textual references to relief scenes, and also Slanski 2000.) By depicting these two parties, the relief scene validates the recipient's claim to the entitlement, visually signaling that conferment of entitlement stemmed directly from or under the aegis of royal and/or divine authority. In this way, the scene also serves to protect the entitlement by validating the recipient's claim: through illustration of the entitlement recipient together with his or her king, the relief calls upon the audience to 'view' their relationship within the specific context of the entitlement event. This visual representation is simultaneously supported legalistically by the concrete and indelible record of actual witnesses whose participation is recorded in the inscription.
INSCRIPTIONS
The Babylonian Entitlement narus are inscribed with cuneiform text. All the Entitlement narus bear a main inscription which conveys information about the entitlement. Some members of the corpus also exhibit captions, short texts associated specifically



CHAPTER 5: FORMAL DEFINITION 167
with elements of the relief imagery (see Textual references to relief scenes in Chapter Four, above). The main text inscriptions exhibit a common structure regardless of the particular type of entitlement commemorated. The shared structure remains constant throughout the life span of the genre. Every Entitlement nara inscription exhibits two major divisions: an operative division, in which the entitlement and the entitlement event, ie., acquisition or affirmation of that entitlement, is recorded, and an imprecative division, in which a series of imprecations and curses are inscribed with the intent of protecting the entitlement and the stone nara that commemorates the entitlement and ensures its perpetuity. A number of inscriptions also have a Heading, usually the name of the artifact, and a Closing, which may include a colophon, a restatement of the name, or the date. The two major divisions of the Entitlement nara inscription can further be broken down into discrete compositional elements. None of the features is attested fewer than five times, and no inscription exhibits components that could not be classified according to these headings. The structure of the inscriptions can be outlined as follows:
Heading name (of the nara) Operative division: narrative and/or paean description of the entitlement statement of surveying statement of entitlement event statement of sealing witnesses date Imprecative division prohibitions curses and/or blessings Closing colophon



168 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
For the most part, the features occur in the order given above. Not every inscription exhibits all the elements. Name, narrative, paean, date, and colophon are attested in a minority of the inscriptions. The name can appear in the heading or the closing, and in one case, both. The date can appear in the operative division or in the closing. In later inscriptions, the list of witnesses may follow the imprecative division, together with the date. Five of the six tablet-shaped members of the corpus recording land purchases lack divine curses, and the prohibitions of these texts reflect comparatively mundane, i.e., legalistic concern with transgressions. The distribution pattern of some elements may be chronologically linked. Regular recording of the date appears relatively late in the corpus. The only occurrence of a date formula dating to the Kassite Dynasty is found on a partially published Entitlement naru dating to the reign of Nazi-Maruttas Iraq Supp. (1944).9 Statements about sealing and witnesses to the sealing are first attested in the reign of Meli-Sipak. The phrase gabare kunuk (NA4.KISIB) §ipreti §a §arri 'Copy of the royal seal of allocations' appears as a regular feature of Entitlement naru inscriptions commemorating royal events beginning with the reign of Marduk-nadin-agge (1099-1082) and continuing through to the latest members of the corpus. For a discussion of sealing and this phrase in particular, see the section Entitlement narus and the durability of entitlement, above, in Chapter Four.
Descriptions of individual compositional components and their roles in the inscriptions are summarized on the following pages.
Heading
Name of the nan1. Ten of the inscriptions provide a name, or title, for the naru. The name exists as an independent compositional unit belonging neither to the operative nor to the imprecative divisions. It appears most often at the very beginning of a text but in a few cases at the very end. In one inscription, Marduk-nadin-agge BBSt 7, the name is provided at the beginning and then repeated at the end of the inscription. On another,



CHAPTER 5: FORMAL DEFINITION 169
Meli-Sipak BBSt 4, the name is inscribed within the relief register, spatially set apart from the main inscription. The majority of the names are of the pattern: "The name of this (stone) nara (is): 'DN protects the kudurru'." Bearing a name may be a feature of Mesopotamian monumental tradition, as illustrated, for example, by the monuments of Gudea. The question of the monumental character of the Entitlement narus is discussed below, in Chapter Seven.
Operative division
The operative division of the inscription is the "business" portion of the text, in which information about the entitlement, the parties involved, and the entitlement event (i.e., the transfer or affirmation of entitlement) is recorded. The operative division has been compared to Mesopotamian legal documents because it regularly includes features characteristic of legal texts, such as a list of witnesses, a record of sealing, and the date.
Description of entitlement. All Entitlement narus were inscribed with an account of the acquisition/affirmation of entitlement to a perpetual source of income. The type of entitlement most commonly commemorated was a grant of land by the king. In addition to royal land grants, royal grants of temple prebend and exemptions from tax and labor obligations, as well as nonroyal grants of land and prebends and land purchases, were also commemorated by the Entitlement narus. Entitlements documented consist of eqlu 'field', always written with the logogram A.sA, isqu 'prebend' usually written GIS.SUB.BA, occasionally syllabically, and zakutu 'exemptions' or 'exemption status', written syllabically or signaled with the verb uzakkf(§u) 'RN exempted (him)', i.e., from obligations due in goods and/or labor. Description of eqlu, the entitlement most commonly commemorated by the Entitlement narus, is strikingly uniform throughout the corpus. In addition to its size, a full description of a field states its ugiiru 'district', its niiru 'watercourse', and its pf!Jiitu 'province', the greater administrative territory in which it was located.



170 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
Descriptions of eqlu further detail the four sides of the field, its two long sides and its two short sides, according to the cardinal directions, and identifies each side by the geographical features of its borders. One of the four borders of the field is, in almost all cases, a water source, usually a canal. The other three sides are described according to neighboring fields. Whereas those three sides are preceded by the prepositional expression ita (written lrS.SA.DU, or DA) meaning 'adjacent to' or 'bordering', the canal is presented without any such prepositional expression, indicating that the 'side' or 'border' of the field was conceived as the canal itself. It is a distinction preserved throughout the corpus, and provides some insight into how the abstract notion of border/boundary was conceptualized. The use of canals as borders in Mesopotamia is attested as early as the third millennium inscriptions documenting the border conflict between the city-states of Lagas and Umma. The relationship of the Entitlement narus to the Eannatum Victory Stele (Stele of the Vultures), a monument commemorating through both text and image events from this historical conflict, is explored below in Chapter Seven. Descriptions of isqu 'prebend' and zakutu 'exemptions' or 'exemption-status', while less standardized than eqlu 'field' descriptions, perform the same function: they detail the specifics of the entitlement. Descriptions of isqu include a list of commodities that were to be received and catalog duties and obligations from which the recipient was exempted, although zakutu could be granted without individual exemptions having been enumerated in the inscription. Examples of entitlement descriptions can be found in the texts cited in full in Chapter Three.
Narrative and/or paean. Narratives fall into two main categories. In grants, this element describes why the king or other granting individual made the grant to the named recipient. Generally, the narrative relates meritorious service performed by the entitlement beneficiary. The narrative of Nebuchadnezzar BBSt 6, the Sitti-Marduk "kudurru," is a wen known example: SittiMarduk, bi!! pf!Jati 'governor' of the province BIt-Piri )-Amurru, was granted ancient exemptions in recognition of his valiant ser



CHAPTER 5: FORMAL DEFINITION 171
vice to the king during the Babylonian military victory over Elam. Another kind of narrative occurs in royal adjudications and recounts the legal history of an entitlement; see, for example, Meli-Sipak BBSt 3 and Marduk-nadin-alJlJe BBSt 9. Narratives can be terse prose statements from two to four lines, or, as in the case of BBSt 6, extend to over 50 lines and exhibit a sophisticated poetic style (see, for example, Hurowitz 1992 for a study of the poetics of this text). Narratives are found in Entitlement narus dating from the reign of Kastiliasu IV (1232-1225) to the reign of Merodach-baladan II (last quarter of the eighth century). Paeans are praise compositions in poetic style, dedicated to a king or a god. Invariably, the subject of the paean plays a preeminent role in the entitlement event. For example, the inscription of Nabu-suma-iskun VAS I 36 opens with a paean to the two divinities Nanayya and Mar-bHi. The Entitlement naru commemorates that these same two gods granted a prebend from their temple to an individual. The earliest example of a paean is found in a naru dating to the reign of Nebuchadnezzar I, the Hinke "kudurru." Excavated in Nippur, this artifact commemorates a land grant to an individual identified both as a nesakku-priest of Enlil as well as the mayor of Nippur. The inscription opens with a long composition in praise of Enlil, whose cult center was located in the city of Nippur. (For an analysis of the poetics of this piece, see Hurowitz 1997, reviewed by Veldhuis 1999.) Narratives are more common than paeans, and in only one case, Merodach-baladan II VAS I 37, are both a narrative and a paean found in a single inscription. Their near mutual exclusivity supports this study's contention that both narrative and paean perform the same function within the Entitlement naru inscription: to provide an historical, moral or legalistic validation for the entitlement event.
Statement of the entitlement event. All Entitlement naru inscriptions contain an explicit statement denoting the transfer or affirmation of entitlement. The phraseology employed is specific to the type of event commemorated, that is, separate terminology is reserved for royal land grants, for royal adjudications, for royal



172 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
grants of exemptions, and for the non-royal grants and purchases. The most common, occurring in almost all royal land grants in which such statements are preserved, is RN...PN arassu irfm 'RN granted PN, his servant'. Other expressions used to denote the entitlement event include iddin 'he gave', piini PN Judgulu 'he entrusted to PN', uter 'he returned (transitive)', uzakkf(su) 'he exempted (it)', ana kaspi iddin 'he sold (for silver)', and ana pilkilf ipluk 'he delimited as the border( s )/territory'. Because these phrases occur in predictable contexts, their use has implications for reconstructing relationships among participants in the entitlement event. The phrase arassu irfm, literally, 'he granted his servant', is used when the king granted land to an individual. Outside the Entitlement narus, the verb riiimu is not widely attested. Within the corpus, however, the phrase is employed in 24 out of the 38 inscriptions in which the event clause is preserved, and in three additional cases, the finite form irfm is used without arassu. The phrase RN...PN arassu irfm may reflect, even in inscriptions lacking a narrative detailing this relationship, that the king has rewarded the recipient-'his servant'-with an entitlement in recognition of 'service' rendered. A variation of arassu irfm is kiiribJu irfm, literally, 'he granted his one who prays', i.e., 'the one who prays for him'. The phrase occurs in Kadasman-Enlil BBSt 1, as wen as in an unpublished naru of Adad-apla-iddina referred to previously in this chapter in the section, Other physical features: field plans. A variant, arda kiiribJu irfm 'he granted the servant who prays for him', is found in Enlil-nadin-apli BBSt 11, a naru that commemorates a grant of land by the sakin miiti of the Sealand. The verb riiimu is thus attested in almost every Entitlement naru that commemorates a royal land grant, from the reign of Nazi-Maruttas to Merodach-baladan II, as well as BBSt 11, in which a grant is made not by the king but by the provincial governor. In one case, Nabfi-apla-iddina BBSt 28, the phrase is used to connote that the king restored lands to the son of the earlier land holder. Entitlement grant inscriptions in which arassu irfm does not occur thus merit a closer look.



CHAPTER 5: FORMAL DEFINITION 173
Exceptions to the use of this expression in royal land grants include the only two occasions in which the king is said to have granted land to a god or to a temple. According to the earlier of these two, Nazi-Maruttas MDP II 86, Nazi-Maruttas gave land to the god Marduk. In this instance, the verb iddin 'he gave' is used. However, later in the same text, a grant to a human recipient is denoted as usual by arassu irfm. Similarly, in Nebuchadnezzar I BBSt 24, the king granted land and associated exemptions to an Elamite priest and his son, and the verb riamu is employed. Later in the text, when the exemptions, settlements, and fields are said to have been given to the god that the two men served, different terminology is used: ana DN i§ruk§unuti u eqleti §uatu (sic) panf§u u§adgil 'he (the king) bestowed them (the exempted settlements) on DN and entrusted the aforementioned fields to him' (lines 40-41). It appears that the verb riamu was deliberately not used to denote gifts of entitlement made to a divinity, and/or to his temple. The distribution pattern of the verb riamu in the inscriptions, together with its usual pairing with the designation arassu, 'his servant', suggests that riamu implied socio-political inferiority of the entitlement recipient vis-a-vis the entitlement giver. Noteworthy, too, in this context, is the case of Merodachbaladan I AIO 23, in which iddin is used to denote that a group of men, after appealing to the king, gave a parcel of land to an individual. The verb iddin is also found in the non-royal land grant chronicled in the text of Marduk-nadin-abbe, the Caillou Michaux, according to which a man gave land to his daughter. Forms of nadanu also are used when the king apportioned land in resolution of a dispute, as in Meli-Sipak BBSt 3. The one case in which the king granted land to an individual and the phrase arassu irfm is not used is Meli-Sipak MDP X 87. Here the phrase 'he delimited as the boundary/territory' ana pilkilf ipluk denotes a grant of land that the king developed for agriculture and then gave to his daughter, ijunnubat-Nanayya. This is the only inscription in the corpus in which a king has granted land to a woman, a circumstance which may account for the unusual terminology. It is also noteworthy that the king is granting land to his daughter, i.e., a princess, but note that in



174 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
Meli-Sipak MDP II 99, according to which that king granted land to his son, Merodach-baladan I, the regular phrase arassu irfm 'he granted his servant' is used. The same expression ana pilkilf ipluk also occurs, however, in Enlil-nadin-apli BE 1/1 83. In the Enlilnadin-apli text, the phrase is used to express that Gulkisar, ancient king of the Sealand, had determined the borders for the lands of the goddess Nanse almost seven centuries previously. This study has suggested above, in Chapter Two, that ijunnubat-Nanayya, the daughter of the king, was associated with the temple of Nanayya. Recalling that in the text of Nebuchadnezzar BBSt 24, in which the king grants land to a priest and his son (lines 15-18 and 27-30), we see the same lands are also said to have been given to the god (38-41). Restatement of the grant event in this way, that land given to the two clerics was, in other words, given to the god they served, implies that grants given to temple officers were tantamount to grants given to the temple. Thus, grants to temple personnel were actually grants to the temple office for the use of the office holder, and as such were effectively grants to the temple holdings. The statement that Nebuchadnezzar gave the settlements and the fields to the god reflects that he gave the grant to the holdings of the temple, and that it was to be reserved for the use of the temple priest and his successors. If the expression ana pilkilf ipluk was reserved for the allocation of lands to the temple, then its occurrence in MDP X 87 must mean that Meli-Sipak's grant to his daughter was, in fact, a grant to the holdings of temple of Nanayya. Phrases used in the royal settling of disputes are ukinnu 'he affirmed' (Merodach-baladan I MDP VI 31), ana pi/kilf uterru 'he returned to the boundary' (Enlil-nadin-apli BE III 83), and pani PN usadgil 'he entrusted to PN' (Marduk-nadin-alJlJe Sumer 38). The last is also a productive phrase for the transfer of entitlement outside the context of a royal land grant. The expression (pani PN) usadgil occurs in a non-royal land grant from a father to son (Marduk-zakir-sumi VAS I 35) as well as a royal restoration of land (Samas-suma-ukln BBSt 10). The term uzakkf(su) 'he exempted (him/it)' is employed in the royal exemptions. In Marduk-nadin-alJlJe BBSt 25, the phrase



CHAPTER 5: FORMAL DEFINITION 175
is embellished with arassu 'his servant', giving rise to the expression arassu...ana amI ,~ati uzakki 'he exempted his servant for all time'.
Sealing and witnesses. Nazi-Maruttas Iraq Supp. (1944) seems to include a list of personal names, and if so, the best explanation for these names would be that they constitute the earliest attested witness list. (This artifact has been published only in excavation photographs, precluding a full treatment of its inscription here). Beginning with the Entitlement narus dated to the reign of Meli-Sipak, a regular feature of the naru inscriptions is a list of individuals who witnessed the sealing of a grant. The role of sealing is discussed in the previous chapter. The sealing itself is occasionally narrated, as in Meli-Sipak BBSt 3 iv 5-10: Jarru Adad-Juma-u,yur iknuk-ma ana PN mar PN2 iddin-ma 'King Adad-suma-u~ur sealed and gave (a record) to PN son of PN2 '. More often, however, a list of witnesses is simply introduced with the phrase ina kanak !uppi Juati PN mar PNb PN3 mar PN4, etc. "At the sealing of that record (were present): PN son of PNb PN3 son of PN4, etc." Most witnesses are identified by their patrimony and office. Witnesses named in the Entitlement narus, listed in descending order of their rank, often held high status in the royal court or in the provincial administration. These witness lists provide a wealth of information about the political organization of southern Mesopotamia during the time of the Entitlement narus, and have been used to reconstruct the provincial administration in Babylonia during the Isin II dynasty, with considerations for the preceding and succeeding dynasties (see Brinkman 1963: 237-38, esp. p. 237, n. 2, and Brinkman 1968a: 296-311). Although these topics lie outside the present inquiry, the remarkably high socio-political status of the witnesses, does, however, bear on the function of the artifacts and their role in the events they commemorated. The fact that high officials, representing the upper ranks of governmental authority, served as witnesses to the entitlement event demonstrates the profound depth of legitimacy to which the naru beneficiary could lay claim. Through the memorialization of sealing and witnessing



176 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
recorded on an inviolable stone naru, the beneficiary and his heirs could lay perpetual claim to royal legitimization through record of the royal sealing as well as through its witnessing by high-ranking members of the government.
Imprecative division
The imprecative division is concerned with the protection and preservation of the entitlement through a series of prohibitions against violating the entitlement and a string of divine curses that would befall a would-be transgressor. The prohibitions and the divine curses are both hallmarks of the Entitlement naru inscription. Structurally, the imprecative division is composed as one long extended conditional sentence in which the prohibitions function as the protasis and the curses as the apodosis, i.e., "(If) so-and-so does such-and-such, (then) may the following gods curse him in the following ways." For the most part, the prohibition and curse sections follow set patterns.
Prohibitions. The prohibitions are set off from the preceding operative division by an indeterminate adverb or an adverbial phrase serving as the 'If' of the conditional sentence. These expressions include matI-rna (ina urn .yati) 'whensoever (in the future)', the particle lu 'whether', an indeterminate pronoun §a '(he) who', or mannu 'whosoever'. The introductory word or phrase is followed by a list of persons-the 'so-and-so's' thereby enjoined from violating the entitlement. In the case of royal grants, the list includes officers of the administration, up to and occasionally including the king himself. Like the officials identified in the witness lists, these titles have been used to reconstruct the political hierarchy, for which see the references to the works of Brinkman cited above. In the case of non-royal grants and land sales among non-royal individuals, the prohibitions list by name persons identified as family members of the parties involved in the transaction. Thus, the parties enumerated in the prohibition section, designated either by office or by kinship affiliation, must have been the individuals considered to



CHAPTER 5: FORMAL DEFINITION 177
pose the likeliest threat to the entitlement and consequently the persons most likely to violate the terms set out by the nara. This list of potential malefactors serves as the subject of a series of prohibitions against ways in which the entitlement could be violated. In the case of royal land grants, the prohibitions detail means by which the putative transgressor is enjoined from taking away or diminishing land granted to the beneficiary, or from raising unfounded claims against the beneficiary's right to the entitlement. In the case of grants of prebends or exemptions, the would-be malefactor is enjoined from appropriating the entitlement. In the case of non-royal grants or sales, the prohibitions are less numerous and more mundane than the prohibitions found in the royal grants; they are aimed against family members of the party who gave up the entitlement, just as, for example, in the texts of ordinary Old Babylonian sales contracts. The list of prohibitions typically closes with interdictions against harming nare suiitu 'the aforementioned nara'. These specific interdictions thus forbade would-be malefactors to destroy, obscure, or efface the self-same nara with which the entitlement is commemorated. In this way, violating the nara is equated with violating the entitlement. Identification of the Entitlement nara with the very entitlement it commemorates reflects an ideology according to which durability of the nara guaranteed survival of the entitlement holder's title. Furthermore, this underlying identification may explain the exceptional use of the term kudurru 'boundary' or 'territory defined by the boundary' in place of the term nara in two inscriptions dated to the reign 0 f Meli-Sipak (see Chapter Two, pp. 37-41 and earlier in this chapter under Native designation). The significance of durability of the nara, its inscription and its imagery, is expanded upon In Chapter Seven's discussion of monumentality.
Divine curses. A series of divine curses to strike down any person who would harm or cause harm to the nara or the entitlement is, along with the prohibitions, another hallmark of the Entitlement nara inscription and one of its most recognizable features. In the earlier examples, the curse section flowed directly



178 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
out of the imprecation section-often not even marked off from the preceding section by the start of a new line, as in the N aziMaruttas inscription reproduced in Chapter Three, pp. 70-4, line 35. Beginning with the inscriptions of Meli-Sipak, however, the curse section is set off from the prohibition section with the phrase amelu suatu, 'the aforementioned man', referring the reader back to the putative malefactors listed in the prohibition section. The curse section functions as the apodosis or 'thenclause' of the extended conditional sentence begun by the prohibition section. The selection of gods and the specific curses associated with them exhibit some standardization throughout the corpus. For example, Anu, Enlil, and Ea are almost always invoked together at the beginning of the curse section, and often with the general curse, arrat la napsuri lemutta llrurusu 'May they curse him with a malevolent curse of no release!' The moon god, Sin, is often called upon to afflict the transgressor with leprosy, a role consistent with the belief prominent in ancient Near Eastern as well as Classical sources that leprosy was connected with the moon (Stol 1993: 127-30). Ninurta, identified in a number of inscriptions as the "lord of borders and boundaries," is frequently invoked to uproot a transgressor's own boundaries, while Gula, goddess of healing and disease, is asked to afflict him with injury and ailment. Because the repertoire is, to some extent, standardized, departures from expected patterns call for attention. For example, in Nebuchadnezzar I BBSt 6, the Sitti-Marduk "kudurru," none of the three traditional heads of the pantheon, Anu, Enlil, or Ea, is named in the curse section. But when we consider their omission in the context of the entire inscription, we find that the god Marduk is credited in the narrative with enabling Nebuchadnezzar to rout the Elamites in battle. We may infer that the absence of Anu, Enlil, and Ea is part of a deliberate effort to preclude the majesty of these great gods from eclipsing that of Marduk. In this context, consider also a possible connection with the theophoric element of the name of the nara beneficiary, SittiMarduk, literally, 'The-one-Ieft-to-Marduk' (see CAD S/3, s.v. sittu A g for this element in personal names). Similar examples in



CHAPTER 5: FORMAL DEFINITION 179
which the otherwise formulaic repertoire of curses has been manipulated in light of the overall naru composition can be seen in Nazi-Maruttas MDP II 86, Nebuchadnezzar I, the Hinke "kudurru," which opens with a paean to Enlil, and in Nabu-sumaiskun VAS I 36, commemorating two gods granting a prebend from their temple and invoking only those two gods in the curses. In addition to subtle signals reflecting personal, institutional or local religious ideology, the curses reveal literary creativity and style on the part of the composers of the naru inscriptions, and constitute a body of writings meriting in-depth study. See Watanabe 1984 for a study on curses associated with a single god that makes extensive use of evidence from the Entitlement narus.
Paleography
The script of the Entitlement narus is predominately Middle Babylonian lapidary. Some of the artifacts, particularly early Entitlement narus of the Kassite Dynasty, exhibit archaizing features in their paleography. This is especially evident in the signforms of common logograms, such as LUGAL for sarru 'king' and SUijUS for isdu 'foundation'. Sign shapes in the later Entitlement naru inscriptions, i.e., those dating to kings of the first millennium, reflect some contemporary paleographic developments. Unfortunately, fewer than half of the inscriptions have been published adequately to illustrate developments in sign fonns. A sign list is provided in Hinke's 1911 study, Selected Babylonian kudurru Inscriptions (SBKI). It is a useful list for the eight inscriptions in that volume, but a more comprehensive list is a desideratum for future research.
Orthography
In the eighth and seventh centuries, toward the end of the era of the Entitlement narus, the orthography of the inscriptions exhibits progressively more Neo-Babylonian writing conventions, such as Slr instead of SU for the third-person accusative pronominal suffix, and use of the U-sign for the conjunction u 'and'. This is another area that would benefit from improved publication of the artifacts and their inscriptions.



180 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
CONCLUSIONS
In sum, the Babylonian Entitlement narus are stone artifacts in the shape of stelae, tablets, or plaques. Some 160 examples are known, attested from at least as early as the reign of Kurigalzu II (1332-1308) of the Kassite Dynasty down through the reign of Samas-suma-ukln, Neo-Assyrian king of Babylonia from 667 to 648. So far, provenience of the monuments is concentrated in a fairly small geographic area, in the northern and eastern parts of Bablyonia, although some examples have originated from southern cities, such as Larsa. It may be that data about the geographic extent of the genre is skewed by accidents of preservation and discovery. The artifacts are designated in their inscriptions as narus, that is, '(stone) stelae' or '(stone) monuments'. Their inscriptions, in Middle-Babylonian or Neo-Babylonian lapidary script, describe the acquisition or affirmation of an entitlement to an ongoing source of income, and take pains to ensure that the entitlement be permanent, that is, hereditary. The artifacts are sculpted with symbols of the gods and occasionally also with cultic or mundane scenes. Divine symbols carved in relief serve to protect the naru and the entitlement it commemorates. Sculpted relief scenes, depicting parties involved in the entitlement event, preserve an enduring visual record of the relationships among these parties. The relief sculptures enhance the authority of the naru through visual invocation of divine and royal potentates. The text of the Entitlement naru follows a uniform structure and is made up of discrete, recognizable, compositional units. A heading, consisting of the name of the naru, is followed by the operative division of the naru inscription, which commemorates the transfer or affirmation of entitlement to a source of income. This in turn is followed by the imprecative division, which endeavors to guarantee that entitlement in perpetuity through a series of prohibitions and curses. The imprecative division is followed by the closing, which may contain a colophon, providing some information about the genesis of the artifact, or its name or date.

Die Kudurru-Steinmetzen schufen keine neuen Symbole; ihre Leistung bestand vielmehr im Auswahlen, zusammenstellen und Ordnen von uberlieferten Formen." 6Seid11989: 275: "Ihre Ergebnisse waren anscheinend dem Betrachter nicht unmittelbar einsichtig, sondern mussten durch beigeschriebene Gotternamen erklart werden (BagM 4 Nr 29,34, 35, 36, 38,50,59)." 7In addition to Seidl's chart (1989: 233-34), summarizing the primary symbols and attributes of 23 deities, a convenient and up-to-date reference for Mesopotamian divine symbols and their identifications, many of which are based on the entitlement naru reliefs, can be found throughout Black, Green, and Rickards 1992, and in Green 1995. 8Black, Green, and Rickards 1992: 114: "It has been thought by some that the positions of the symbols on the stones were related to the relative ranking of the deities shown, and even if not a deliberate and conscious procedure, a rough correlation is likely because the more important deities would come to mind first, the less important being added lower down on the stone if space permitted. If true, the suggestion has implications for the detailed reconstruction of Babylonian theological changes and shifts of power of different interest groups attached to the various temples." 9Photos of the stele, excavated at Diir-Kurigalzu, and a transcription of the date are published in Taha Baqir, Iraq, Supp. (1944): pI. XVIII, fig. 21 (photo), and pp. 5, 11, and 13 (no. 8). Seidl also published a photo of the

stele; see Seidl 1989: pI. 1. An edition of the text based on the published photos is currently in preparation by the author.



Chapter Six
Debatable Members of the Corpus
Four artifacts are presented here against the backdrop of the functional and descriptive definition of Babylonian Entitlement narus presented in Chapter Five. Artifacts A-C are objects for which scholarly consensus about their status vis-a-vis the corpus has yet to be achieved. A fourth, Artifact D, has not yet been considered a potential member of the genre. This chapter takes the opportunity to offer full treatments of these artifacts, and to measure them against the foregoing formal definition for the Babylonian Entitlement narus set out in the preceding chapter.
ARTIFACTS A: KADASMAN-ENLIL BBST 1 AND BM 135743
Artifacts A exist in duplicate. BM 91036 and BM 135743 are terra-cotta cones housed in the British Museum. Both are fashioned out of a rough clay and virtually identical in size and shape. Each bears a copy of the same inscription, according to which land granted by Kurigalzu, son of Kadasman-ijarbe, (i.e., Kurigalzu I), was affirmed by Kadasman-Enlil. Brinkman (1976a: 136) noted that there are "no compelling reasons" to attribute the inscription to one Kadasman-Enlil, either I (1374(?)-1360) or II (1263-1255), to the exclusion of the other.

CHAPTER 6: DEBATABLE MEMBERS OF THE CORPUS 185
BM 91036 was published by King in Babylonian Boundary Stones as BBSt 1, pp. 3-4, lithographic pI. I. The unpublished duplicate, BM 135743, was included by Brinkman in Materials and Studies for a Kassite History 1 (Brinkman 1976a), where BM 91036 and BM 135743 are catalogued as J.2.1.9.1 and J.2.1.9.2, respectively. The first few lines of BM 135743 were transliterated and translated in Walker and Collon 1980, where they proposed that both fragments most likely came from Sippar. 1 Other than these few lines, the inscription of BM 135743 heretofore has not been published. A copy of the cuneiform inscription of BM 135743 is offered in fig. 10. I compared the two artifacts in March of 1996, and there can be no doubt that the texts are replicas. The unpublished text provides clearer readings for a few lines, specifically i 1-3, and ii 1-5. A composite edition of the duplicate inscriptions is provided below. Improvements on King's edition of BBSt 1 (BM 92036) are noted in the commentary.

Commentary
187
i 1 The field description is unique among the inscriptions of the corpus. Typically GUR is not written out; compare, e.g., the passages cited above in
this study, pp. 51,70-4,75-8, and 120 Also, KUS GAL, the 'big cubit' is
not specified, and use of the Sumerian distributive suffix TA.AM is unparalleled in the corpus.
i 3 The sign before TU is clearly MAR and not GAL (contrary to the copy and transcription of King). The difference between the two signs is clear on the duplicate BM 135743 (text B, fig. 10) where line 3 is better preserved.
Comparison with GAL just below in col. i, line 4, shows that the bottom horizontal wedge of the sign in question angles downward to meet the vertical wedge rather than being perpendicular to the vertical wedge, as it is in the sign GAL in i 4.
i 9 In Old Akkadian, Ur III, and Old Babylonian attestations, neJakku (ni,vakku) is a title associated with the temple of Enlil at Nippur. In Middle Babylonian texts, persons with this title are also identified as holding other offices as well; see Brinkman 1968: 300, n. 1970, and CAD N/2, s.v. ne,vakku and other references cited there.
11 i,vtu in line 1 would seem to govern the subordinated form ukinnu, requiring that it be translated as a temporal conjunction 'since' or 'when' (see Aro 1955: 98-99) or as 'because' (see Aro 1955: 153). Hence, the proposed interpretation: "Since (the time when)/Because... Kadasman-Enlil affirmed the border." However, the rest of the column does not follow logically as a main clause, and it is not clear how ii 2, "lord of this (7) field(7) [x]," would fit in with such a reading.
ii 2 For a possible reading anmf 'this', see AHw 1, s.v. anmu, and possibly also Artifact D, below in this chapter, obv. 24. Against this reading, note that attestations are limited to peripheral Akkadian, and, moreover, the writing an-na-a in ii 6.
ii 3-5 King copied traces only for lines 3-4, and transliterated:

Kad[ash]ma[nJ-Enlil, the king, has [present]ed; (and) he has set up a boundary stone.
The signs miJsa1-ri in line 3 are clear on the duplicate text BM 135743 (fig. lO, i.e., text B above). The new reading for lines ii 3-5 yields better sense. King's translation, "Kad[ash]ma[n]-[E]nl[i]l, the king, has [present]ed; (and) he has set up a boundary stone" is not very satisfactory, especially as, according to i 4-11, it was Kurigalzu who presented the grant to "Enlil-bani, the one who prays for him." The formulation RN... PN arassu/karihsu irlm( u), discussed in the previous chapter (under Operative division: Statement of entitlement event), consistently occurs to denote the primary or original conferral of entitlement, and we would not expect to find it used in a context such as this in which a king affirmed the grant of an earlier king. Additionally, riamu is not attested in the Entitlement nara inscriptions without an indirect object in the accusative case, and, moreover, King's reading does not account for the subordinate marker -u on the finite form irlm. Finally, sar miJari 'just king' (literally, 'king of justice') in this context is an apt epithet for a ruler who has affirmed the land grant of an earlier king. The expression ,~ar mL~ari is found elsewhere in the corpus in similar contexts; see Nebuchadnezzar I, the Hinke "kudurru," ii 22; Merodachbaladan II BBSt 35 16; and Samas-suma-ukln AnOr 12 1.
ii 8 i-tah-ha-[lu] "(he who) would take away this field" is preferred here to King's restoration i-tah-ha-[ku]. For parallels in the corpus, see, for example, Meli-Sipak MDP II 99, iv 55-56: eqla ... Iii ittahal "the field is not to be taken away, or Meli-Sipak MDP X87, iii 17: ana tahal alanf sunuti "to take away those fields."
Discussion
According to Brinkman (1980-83: 268), "among the earliest attested kudurrus are baked clay objects shaped like steles and called specifically naru §a ba$bi, 'clay stele' or 'clay monument', without reliefs." This observation is based on these two British Museum artifacts and the colophon of Nazi-Maruttas MDP II 86, that states it is a copy of a naru sa ba$bi, 'a naru of clay'. It seems logical to connect the expression "a naru of clay" from Nazi-Maruttas MDP II 86 with the two duplicate artifacts treated here. Nonetheless, in addition to being manufactured of clay rather than stone, Artifacts A evince a number of features that set them apart from the rest of the Entitlement naru corpus. The clay objects exhibit no evidence of sculpted imagery. Their duplicate text consists of two columns totaling twenty-three short lines, making



CHAPTER 6: DEBATABLE MEMBERS OF THE CORPUS 189
them the shortest of all the completely preserved inscriptions. Artifacts A are the only (potential) member of the corpus to exist in duplicate. Comparison of the stele-shaped nara Nazi-Maruttas MDP II 86, which according to its inscription was a 'copy of the old (clay) one', with Artifacts A reveals a great difference in size. Nazi-Maruttas MDP II 86 stands 50 cm by 20 cm; of the two terra-cotta duplicates, the better preserved stands only 25.4 cm high, 17.1 cm wide, and, moreover, is much smaller than contemporary stone Entitlement naras. If Nazi-Maruttas MDP II 86 was in fact a "copy of the old (clay) one," then the original clay nara must have been as much as twice the height of Artifacts A to support the entire 164 line (less the 12 line colophon) inscription. More significantly, the inscription of Artifacts A speaks only of the king establishing a kudurru 'boundary'/,boundary marker' and its prohibition warns a malefactor against removing the kudurru and taking away the field. It makes no reference to an object caned nara, either of stone or of clay. The specific characteristics of Artifacts A which set them apart from the rest of the corpus-their fashioning out of clay, small size, short inscription, lack of reliefs, duplication-suggest the possibility that these two baked clay objects, in contrast to the Entitlement naras, may have been set outside on the field to mark a boundary. If so, they may be examples of the objects that properly could be termed kudurrus, i.e., boundary markers. Such a suggestion only raises more questions. Were the objects baked in antiquity? If they were placed out of doors in fields in antiquity, how did they survive in this condition, and how were they discovered? Nonetheless, the inscription of Artifacts A, short as it is, does follow the pattern of Entitlement nara inscriptions. The colophon of Nazi-Maruttas MDP II 86 leads us to expect the existence of nara sa ba~bi 'naras of clay'. Unfortunately, there are no clear and unambiguous examples of clay Entitlement naras with which to compare Artifacts A for the presence of reliefs, length of inscription, etc. It is also possible that the characteristics that set Artifacts A apart from the rest of the corpus stem from their being fashioned from clay rather than from stone. These considerations render evaluation of Artifacts A vis-a-vis the corpus quite diffi



190 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
cult. Without evidence to exclude it, Kadasman-Enlil BBSt l/BM 135743 should be retained as the sole extant examples of clay members of the corpus.
ARTIFACT B: MELI-SIPAKMDP IV 163
Found at Susa, Artifact B is the lower part of a badly broken stele. This surviving fragment, with its base measuring 40 x 43 cm, indicates an original of considerable mass. The fashioning of the stele features a decoration of sculpted towers topped by a crenellated wall, above which ran at least one horizontal band of divine representations in relief (see MDP IV pIs. 16 and 17 and the description of Seidl 1989: 31-32). Between the two towers pictured on MDP IV pI. 16 appears to be an archway or gate. The fragmentary stele preserves parts of two inscriptions: two partially preserved columns of a Middle Babylonian text (MDP IV 163-164 "A" and pI. 16) and a fragmentary Elamite text of Sutruk-Nauuunte (MDP IV 164-165 "B" and pI. 17). The stele thus belongs to the select group of Babylonian trophies from among those transported to Susa to which the Elamite king added his own inscription.2 The Middle Babylonian text is inscribed in vertical columns above the crenellated wall design, and the final line of text rests between the capitols of two towers. The upper portions of both columns are missing.

Commentary
191
ii' 2'-5' The context requires that do-a be interpreted as a writing for Akkadian dama 'blood'. This is the standard curse associated with Gula throughout the Entitlement nara corpus. The form in line 3' is attested only in the Entitlement nara corpus, where it occurs only in this and in three other comparable curses of
Gula. CAD S, s.v. ~'IOrriJu, defines it as "spreading, proliferating, of rank growth," an adjective derived from the verb ~"urruJu, "to grow shoots;
branches" (CAD S, s.v. ~'1urruJu), and notes its "unusual position, preceding the substantive which is followed by another adjective." I propose that the form is not an adjective $arriJu from $urruJu, a verb that seems to be used only in the context of vegetal growth, but rather a plural substantivized adjective ,'IOrrii, from the verb ,'IOraru A 'to flow, drip',
a verb used to describe bodily ailments (see CAD S, s.v. ~'IOraru). Such an
analysis yields the fonn ~'IOrrL~a 'her oozing (ailments)'. Lines ii' 2-5' may then be translated, 'May Gula afflict him with her oozing (sores), a persistent carbuncle, so that he may bathe in blood and pus like water!' This interpretation also mitigates the need to explain the consistently "unusual" syntactical position of the word.
Discussion
This fragmentary Middle Babylonian text is clearly the final part of a section of curses concluding a longer inscription. Scheil



192 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
(1902: 163-4), in publishing the artifact and its inscriptions, based his restorations of the Babylonian inscription on an Entitlement naru of Meli-Sipak (MDP II 99). He did not, however, designate Artifact B as a so-called kudurru. Steinmetzer included the fragment in his study, but designated it a "fragment of a stone tablet" ("Bruchsttick einer Steintafel") rather than a "boundary stone" ("Grenzstein"), adding that the fragmentary curses were "der allerdings nicht durchschlagende Grund, warum die Urkunde hierher gerechnet wurde" (Steinmetzer 1922: 73-4 and n. 1). In Materials for Kassite History 1, Brinkman (1976a: 258 {S.5.1}) listed the piece as a "fragmentary stele" without designating it as a kudurru; moreover, he challenged Scheil's restoration of the name Meli-Sipak in the Elamite text. Seidl (1989: 32) questioned counting the artifact as part of the corpus because of its large size and because of the presence of the Elamite inscription? Nonetheless, she did include it in her catalogue, in brackets, noting that certain of its characterstics did not eliminate the possiblity that it should be considered as a member of the corpus (Seidl 1989: 32).4 Based on the style of the relief sculptures, Seidl placed Artifact B into her Third Group (=Kanonisch A), along with two other stelae featuring similarly sculpted architectural decoration: Meli-Sipak BBSt 4 and an uninscribed stele, first published as MDP VII 146, figs. 458-62 and pIs. 27-8. While Meli-Sipak BBSt 4 was excavated in Sippar, the uninscribed stele was-like this fragmentary naru under discussion-found in Susa. The problematic Elamite text is written in a single column, at a right angle from the orientation of the Middle Babylonian inscription, alongside and upon the surface of one of the sculpted towers. In contrast to the Middle Babylonian inscription, the beginning rather than the end of the text has been preserved. It appears to be identical to the Elamite text that Sutruk-Naggunte had inscribed upon the Victory Stele of Nariim-Sfn (MDP III 24), a circumstance that has enabled its restoration. The following translation of the Elamite text inscribed on Artifact B is after Konig 1965, no. 23:
I (am) Sutruk-Nal].[l].unte, the son] of [t£alludus-Insusin]ak, the beloved servant [of (the god) Insusinak], the king of Anzan



CHAPTER 6: DEBATABLE MEMBERS OF THE CORPUS 193
[(and) Susa, the enlarg]er of [my realm, the caretaker of Elam, [the prince of Elam].
II As Insusinak, [my god, instr]uct[ed me, I smote] (the land) Karintas.
III [I] acquired the stele of Meli-[Sipak] in Kari[ntasr
IV [(and brought it to Elam)].
When he published the artifact, Scheil restored this text on the basis of the Elamite text inscribed upon the Victory Stele of Nariim-Sfn Elamite (MDP III 24) and a similar Elamite inscription added by Sutruk-NalJlJunte to yet another Babylonian monument also discovered at Susa (MDP III 25). Scheil's, and subsequently Konig's, restoration of the name Meli-Sipak are based on very slight traces, and, as noted above, the reading was refuted by Brinkman (1976a: 258): "Line 7 of the Elamite text (B) was alleged by Scheil to contain the beginning of the name Meli-Sipak; but all that is visible is mrMe-x' [ ] (collation), which provides little support for such an interpretation." Brinkman's point is well taken; there is very little left of the signs to support a conclusive restoration of the name Meli-Sipak. However, the traces, reproduced faithfully on pI. 17 of MDP IV and collated by me in June, 1996, do not preclude a reading mrMe'Jli'-[Sipak]. In fact, the faint traces following rMe' conform rather well to the sign -li- as seen in line 2 of the Elamite inscription (ak gi-ik li-ba-ak rdl), also visible in the photographic plate. There are additional grounds on which to support restoring the name Meli-Sipak in this inscription. Chronological feasibility. Scheil supported his reading on the grounds that the style of the "Semitic" text placed it among the Kassite members of the corpus, and that there was only one Kassite king whose name began with Me-, a reasoning that reflects the state of our knowledge today as well. Moreover, there is a terminus ad quem for the Babylonian artifacts found in Susa from the raids of Sutruk-NalJlJunte during the reign of king Zababa-suma-iddina (1158) (Brinkman 1968a: 88), successor to Merodach-baladan I, 35th and penultimate king of the Kassite



194 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
Dynasty. No Entitlement narus or other Babylonian monuments dating to after the reign of Merodach-baladan I have been found at Susa. In other words, Meli-Sipak fits the chronological parameters to have authored a Babylonian monument that was removed to Elam, re-inscribed by Sutruk-Nabbunte, and subsequently installed at Susa. Size. Insofar as can be inferred from the dimensions of its base (40 cm x 43 cm), the artifact is joined in its large size by two undisputed members of the Entitlement naru corpus. These date to the reign of Meli-Sipak and his successor: Meli-Sipak MDP X 87 (base: 43 cm x 28 cm; height: 90 cm) and Merodachbaladan I BBSt 5 (base: 51 cm x 30.5 cm; height: 91 cm). Textual affinity. Scheil used the text of Entitlement naru MeliSipak MDP II 99 to restore the Middle Babylonian text. That inscription shares unique features with the fragmentary Middle Babylonian text of Artifact B. For ease of comparison, the relevant portions of both texts are provided here:

Note that in both inscriptions, the curse of the goddess Gula, dama u sarka kfma me lirmuk 'May he bathe in blood and pus like water' is positionally prominent, immediately preceding the summation of visual divine representations. Most striking is the unique elaboration of the expression 'However many gods, whose names are invoked upon this naru', which suffices in the majority of the inscriptions. Although the fragmentary text of Artifact B does not include the expression, kakkfsunu kullumu '(whose) symbols are revealed', it does share with Meli-Sipak MDP II 99 the distinction of being the only other inscription in the corpus to refer to both to the divine subatu 'socles' and u,yratu 'designs' represented on the stele. Iconographic similarity. Of the three stelae to exhibit the tower and crenellated wall carving, one, the uninscribed stele found at Susa and noted above, cannot be dated to a particular reign. Both that naru and Artifact B must, however, be counted among the trophy objects removed from Babylonia in the raids of Sutruk-Nal}l}unte, and have a terminus ante quem of ca. 1156. The third stele to exhibit these sculptural features, BBSt 4, is dated securely to the reign of Meli-Sipak (1186-1172).
The closing curses of MDP IV 163 speak strongly for including this artifact in the Entitlement naru corpus. There is no extant parallel for a royal stele with such a closing formula; this kind of formula however, a hallmark of the Entitlement naru inscription. I submit that the Elamite king's decision to add his own in



196 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
scription to MDP IV 163 may, in fact, be attributed to the massive size and remarkable sculpting of the stele. The surviving textual traces, the similarity of the precise wording of the curses to those that close an undisputed Entitlement nara of Meli-Sipak, MDP II 99, plus its iconographic relationship to another undisputed Entitlement nara of that same king, BBSt 4, speak persuasively for restoring rM elJlil-[Sipak] in the Elamite inscription. Taken altogether, the evidence makes a strong case for dating Artifact B, the fragmentary stele MDP IV 163, to the reign of Meli-Sipak and including it among the corpus of Entitlement naras.

The cuneiform inscription of the Nabu-apla-iddina BBSt 36, the Sippar Samas Tablet, a tablet-shaped stone with text and relief (fig. 11), was first published by Rawlinson in the fifth volume of Cuneiform Inscriptions/rom Western Asia (V R). Full publication of the artifact with photographs and an edition of its inscription can be found in King's 1912 publication, Babylonian Boundary Stones and Memorial Tablets in the British Museum (BBSt). The artifact was discovered at Sippar in the remains of the Ebabbar, temple of the sun-god Samas. The most accessible edition of the inscription, King's in BBSt, is now 80 years old. 8 I collated the inscription in 1996, and found that, as is the case with all the inscriptions published in BBSt, very few improvements can be made to King's cuneiform readings. Nonetheless, modern understanding of Akkadian has advanced since 1912, and a new edition of the text is offered here.

Samas, great Lord, one (who) since many days had been angry with Akkad, had turned away his neck, during the reign of Nabu-apla-iddina, king of Babylon, he became merciful, and he turned back his face. A design of his image, a fired (mold) of clay (illustrating) his features and his appurtenances, was found on the opposite side of the river Euphrates, on the west (bank), and N abu-nadin-sumi, sangu-priest of Sippar, diviner, descendent of Ekur-suma-usabsi, ,~angu-priest of Sippar, diviner, showed the aforementioned design of the image to Nabi1-apla-iddina, the king, his lord, and N abi1-apla-iddina, king of Babylon, to whom was commanded and entrusted the fashioning of that image, (when) he saw the aforementioned image, his face became exultant! His heart rejoiced! To the fashioning of that image he (Nabi1-nadin-sumi) directed his attention, and with the craft of Ea, with the skill of Ninildu, ijura~u-banda,
Ninkurra, Nin-uqni, with red gold, pure lapis lazuli, he faithfully treated the image of Samas, great lord. Through the purification of Ea and Asarluhhi, in the presence of Sarnas, in the Ekarzagina

May his seed be plucked up! Through hunger and want may his life come to an end! May his body fall yet may he have no one to bury him!
Note that these three lines echo the first three lines of the main inscription, and are the first lines encountered by the reader. Mesopotamian literary compositions were known in antiquity by their first lines. Thus, the first line of caption A: "Image of Samas, great lord, resident of the Ebabbar" and the first line of the main text: "Samas, great lord, resident of the Ebabbar" is a fitting "title" to this composition that narrates the re-discovery, re-creation, re-consecration, and re-installment of the cult image of the god



CHAPTER 6: DEBATABLE MEMBERS OF THE CORPUS 209
Samas in the Ebabbar temple. Note also the distinction between ~alam SamJi "Image of Samas" in the caption and simply SamaJ in the main text.
Epigraph B. See already CAD B, s.v. birit Id, and Jacobsen's improvement on King's reading: "Sin, Shamash, and Ishtar. They lie between the divine Mus (i.e., Mus h - i g i - min) of the posts (i.e., of the canopy) opposite the Apsu." (Jacobsen 1987: 31-32, n. 24.) 'Nirah' is read here for dMUS, the name of
the snake god; dMUS can also be read ~~alJan (see McEwan 1983).
Epigraph C. Poebel (1936: 112) was the first to grasp the sense of the caption, and translated, "the steward of Samas, a serpent with two upper bodies." Jacobsen (1987: 31, n. 23) followed Poebel, but read the signs m u s i g i - min as a Sumerian name, Mush-igimin, meaning 'two-faced serpent'. This translation follows Poebel, reading MUS IGI.II as an epithet for NiraIJ, the snake god. "Serpent with two upper bodies" echoes verbally the visual representation with doubled torso (fig. 11).
Main text. i 8 GIS.ijUR.MES u~'1riitu literally, 'drawings', generally '(architectural) plan' or 'design', and by extension also divine plan or design. i 13 King had read here Jar Biibili for LUGAL.E. Without the postposition marker 'ki', the reading ,~arru, simply 'king', is preferred. i 15 Jacobsen (1987: 31, n. 18) preferred here a more idiomatic, less literal translation: "he paid no attention to him." The more literal translation is preferred here, with its image of the face of the sun, a nuanced reference to the idea of sun-light signalling the leitmotif of light and seeing that runs through the narrative. By evoking the idea of the sun-god showing his face, the passage sets the stage for the discovery of the design for the lost divine image in iii 25, innamir-ma literally, "(it) was seen, and for the allegorical passage of the divine image from obscurity into view (lines iii 19-25). The indivisible relationship between light and vision and the 'face' of the sun is echoed throughout the text, most notably in the passage describing the king's response to the newly fashioned image. When the priest displays the new image to the king, we read in lines iv 35-46 that, "his countenance grew bright," and with "his face glowing, his expression radiant," the king "looked upon him joyfully with the goodness of his eyes." i 22 :E..MAS for Jangu; see ABL 324 and note that other examples of this writing come from the corpus under investigation. See ii 16 in this inscription for the title of this same individual written SANGA. III 13 The determinative ki is lacking from King's transliteration. III 20 For ~irpu Ja ba~bi 'fired (mold) of clay', Walker and Dick (2001: 22) translate "an impression of baked clay." iv 12-28 Although Walker and Dick (2001: 22-24) take the king to be the subject of iv 12-28, I understand the Jangu priest, Nabu-nadin-sumi, not the king, to have been responsible for the execution and consecration of the new divine image. The biJru 'diviner' is identified as one of the types of priest known to have performed the mfs pI and like rituals; see the discussion "The Priest



210 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
of the Ritual," of Walker and Dick (2001: 15-16). There are no parallels for the performance of the ritual by a Babylonian king. Moreover, as noted by Walker and Dick (2001: IS), it was the gods Ea and Asaluhhi who were ultimately, i.e., theologically, responsible for the rituals, and the priest is a better candidate than the king to serve as their worldly agent. My analysis of these lines conforms to the overall interpretation offered here and in the following discussion, which incorporates the text, relief, and typology of BBSt 36 and understands the artifact to commemorate the granting of an entitlement by the king to the priest in recognition of his role in the re-creation of the old/new cult image. IV 14 'Craft' instead of 'wisdom' for nemequ after Walker and Dick (2001: 23,
iv 27
iv 24 iv 28 iv 34
iv 42 iv 44 iv 47
v7 v 25
and n. 6S, citing Landsberger 1965: 22, n. 29). pL~u imsf-ma "He (the priest) washed its (the image's) mouth." This is a metonymic allusion to the performance of the mfs pI-ritual, literally "Washing of the Mouth," by which a cult image was animated prior to taking up residence in its sanctuary; see most recently the studies of Walker and Dick (1999, 2001) which incorporate evidence from this artifact (see esp. Walker and Dick 200 1: 21-24). mabar Samas "before Samas, here probably means "in the daylight. "He" i.e., the newly consecrated image of the sun-god.
For di,~pu (LA.L) perhaps 'syrup' instead of the traditional 'honey', see Walker and Dick (2001: 14, and n. 3S, after Maul 1991: SI and n.61). itru$a literally, 'he extended'. ruHuti literally, 'red' or 'ruddy'. The long list of commodities in lines iv 47-vi S constitutes the direct object of the finite verb irfm 'he bestowed' in vi 12. abu is the bound form of aba usually meaning 'wages'. UJ.OIR.LA-u-ti nils patruti, should be something like an abstract noun from 'butcher', apparently referring to the various cuts of meat detailed above in v la-IS. v 26 For unat libbi, see AHw 3, s.v. unutu la, references all from omens. vi 41 ana ramnfsu uterru (OUR-ru) literally, '(re)tum (trans.) (it) to himself'. vi 55 qebira ayy-idi literally, 'may he acquire no burier'.
Discussion: the inscription
The inscription of this artifact is preserved virtually intact and is much longer than the texts of the other three objects considered in this chapter. The Sippar Samas Tablet is also well known, and its text and relief have attracted more scholarly attention than have the other artifacts presented here. Because it has so much to offer in the areas of political history, religious ritual, and, of course, study of the Entitlement narus, the following discussion of BBSt 36, the Sippar Samas Tablet, is longer and more detailed than the discussions devoted to the other artifacts in this chapter. By publishing the Sippar Samas Tablet in Babylonian Boundary Stones, King must have considered it part of, or at least



CHAPTER 6: DEBATABLE MEMBERS OF THE CORPUS 211
related to, the corpus under investigation. Steinmetzer, too, included the piece in his study, designating it L 36. In Political History, Brinkman (1968a: 348) referred to it as a 'stone tablet', as he labeled other tablet-shaped members of the corpus, reserving the term kudurru for artifacts in the shape of stelae. Seidl did not include the Samas Tablet in her iconographic study. Previous discussions have focused on the shape, material, and size of the objects, and omitted the Samas Tablet. But by seeing the Entitlement narus as a cohesive genre with distinct textual and visual characteristics, it is clear that the Samas Tablet belongs to this group of artifacts. The Samas Tablet dates from the reign of Nabu-apla-iddina and originates in the city of Sippar-well within the chronological and geographical ranges circumscribed by uncontested members of the corpus. It was found in the remains of a temple, a locus indicated by archaeological and textual evidence as the one in which the Babylonians placed their Entitlement narus. The artifact is made of stone, and bears both inscription and relief. The stone is carved in the shape of a tablet, obverse flat and reverse slightly convex, and it is inscribed so as to be turned end-to-end. The artifact's size and the organization of the text into six columns are characteristics of the plaqueshaped type of Entitlement naru. The orthography and language of the inscription can be described as archaizing Neo-Babylonian,
for example, SU is used more commonly than SU for the third person masculine pronominal suffix, yet U is used more often
than U for writing the extra-vowel sign -u. Case vowels are subject to Neo-Babylonian rules for vocalic endings (see GAG §63 e; Hyatt 1941: esp. pp. 22-23; and Woodington 1982: 63-65). The edge of the stone is ridged all the way around, a feature encountered on an unpublished member of the corpus dating to Adad-apla-iddina, an artifact that similarly exhibits characteristics of the plaque-shaped Entitlement narus. The inscription commemorates a royal grant of a temple sinecure and can be summarized as follows:

Narrative. The narrative portion of the inscnptIOn provides valuable information about the political history and religious cult practice of Babylonia at the beginning of the first millennium. In the eleventh and tenth centuries, semi-nomadic peoples, designated in Babylonian sources as the Sutians, were held responsible for disturbances throughout northern and eastern Babylonia (Brinkman 1968a: 285-87). Sutians are connected to the devastation of cult centers during the reign of Adad-apla-iddina (1068-1047) at Nippur, Sippar, and possibly also Der and DilrKurigalzu. One casualty of the destruction was the Ebabbar temple in the city of Sippar, cult center of the sun-god Samas. According to the Sippar Sama§ Tablet, the devastation of the Ebabbar resulted in the loss of the divine image of Samas-the focus of cult worship-and the discontinuation of regular cultic rites. Religious ceremonies served to guide and punctuate the life of the Mesopotamian temple and its community. Linked to the agriculturally based calendar, such rituals featured offerings of consumable goods to the temple. These offerings, in addition to the produce of lands held directly by the temple, provided income to the temple-income which was then disbursed to cult personnel and temple dependents. Prosperity and well-being in the land was reflected in the regularity and the richness of cultic rites and offerings; their cessation signaled large-scale collapse of community and of civilized rule. Mesopotamian kings from time immemorial commemorated gifts to their gods in their royal inscriptions, and establishment of regular offerings in sustenance



CHAPTER 6: DEBATABLE MEMBERS OF THE CORPUS 213
of a temple and its personnel was an obligation of the king, testimony both to able rule of an orderly realm and to receipt of divine favor. The Sippar SamaJ Tablet relates that king Simbar-Sipak ( 1025-1008), first king of the Second Dynasty of the Sealand, endeavored to recover the lost cult image and to restore cultic rites at the Ebabbar. When Samas, however, did not "reveal his face" to the king, Simbar-Sipak erected a nipbu, a sun disc (Brinkman 1976: 183), established regular offerings, and installed as Jangu-priest one Ekur-suma-usabsi. In the reign of a later king, Kassu-nadin-abbe, characterized as a time of hardship and famine, those offerings ceased. The aforementioned Jangupriest then petitioned a subsequent king, Eulmas-sakin-sumi (1003-987), who allocated some of the income from the Esagila, temple of the god Marduk in Babylon, to Samas and his priest, along with some orchard land in the city of Babylon. Such was the state of the Samas cult at Sippar until the reign of Nabfi-aplaiddina (ca. 887-ca. 855). King Nabu-apla-iddina, having driven the Sutians from Babylonia, proceeded to rebuild the holy temples and restore the ancient rites. At this point, according to the SamaJ Tablet narrative, a design for the lost cult image of Samas was discovered on the west bank of the river Euphrates. The implication is that Samas, described as having been angry with the land and presumably its kings, relented and allowed his image to be found during the reign of Nabfi-apla-iddina. Nabu-nadin-sumi, Jangu-priest of Sippar and descendent of the aforementioned §angu-priest Ekursuma-usabsi, displayed the rediscovered design to N abfi-aplaiddina. In response, the king joyfully commissioned a new cult image to be fashioned, and this new cult image was duly consecrated and installed in the (presumably rebuilt) Ebabbar (for which see also the succinct discussion of Reiner 1996: 311-12). In conclusion-and in accordance with the logic of the inscription as a whole-the king was so pleased with the result that he assigned a rich prebend of foods and garments to the Jangu-priest responsible.
The narrative of the Sippar SamaJ Tablet compares well with narratives found throughout the Entitlement naru corpus. In most



214 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
narratives, the king, pleased with service rendered him by an individual, rewards the individual with an entitlement. For example, the narrative of Nebuchadnezzar BBSt 6 relates that the king recognized the heroism of Sitti-Marduk in Babylonia's victorious battle over Elam. He then granted the valiant Jakin mati ancient exemptions for the province under his jurisdiction. Similarly, in another inscription of Nebuchadnezzar, BBSt 24, the king granted lands to a fugitive priest from Elam and his son. According to the narrative, the priest had petitioned Nebuchadnezzar for assistance, after which Nebuchadnezzar "took the hand of the Bel," i.e., the stolen cult image of Marduk, and "led him back to Babylon." While the situation is not made explicit, it would seem that the Elamite priest somehow assisted Nebuchadnezzar behind enemy lines in recovery of the stolen cult image, and, in recognition of that deed, the king settled him in Babylonia and rewarded him and his descendants with a rich temple prebend. In the narrative of the Samas Tablet, the basic theme, grounded in a larger history of recent fortunes of the Ebabbar, is that King Nabfi-apla-iddina, pleased with the new cult image of Samas, granted a rich prebend to the sangu-priest who presided over its discovery, consecration and installation.
Description of prebend. Having recounted events leading to the prebend grant, the text goes on to describe the prebend in detail. Shares of fine beer, honey-cakes, vegetables, sheep, fish, and other meats are allotted to the sangu-priest. Moreover, a large selection of garments, a special gift of the king, is designated for the three gods of the temple, and included in the prebend for the sangu-priest.
Statement of entitlement event. The lengthy prebend description is followed by a statement of the grant:

CHAPTER 6: DEBATABLE MEMBERS OF THE CORPUS 215
(all of the above) NabG.-apla-iddina, king of Babylon, granted to Nabu-nadin-sumi, sangu-priest of Sippar, diviner, his servant.
This is the characteristic formulation of a grant of entitlement found throughout the Entitlement nara corpus: RN...PN arassu irfm "RN ... granted to PN, his servant." As discussed in the previous chapter (in the section Inscriptions: Operative division: Statement of Entitlement event), this formulation is not encountered outside the corpus of Entitlement nara inscriptions. According to the text, the king established (ukfn-ma) income for Samas and granted it (irlm) to the priest (ii 4-10), yet gave (iddin) the orchard to Samas and entrusted it (pani PN usadgil) to Ekur-suma-usabsi (ii 11-17). Taken altogether, these statements imply that a gift made to a god is also a gift made or entrusted to the priest who serves that god. This same implication, that a gift to a cleric may be tantamount to a gift to the temple served by that cleric, is discussed above in the previous chapter, under Inscriptions: Operative division: Statement of entitlement event.
Sealing and witnesses. As discussed in Chapters Three and Four, an account of the king administering the royal seal to a clay tablet documenting the transfer of entitlement is a characteristic feature of the Entitlement nara inscriptions from the time of Meli-Sipak down to Samas-suma-ukln. After impressing the tablet with the royal seal, the king presented the sealed document-the document upon which the operative division of the nara inscription is based-to the entitlement recipient. As seen throughout the corpus, witnesses to the preparation of the sealed document often held high rank in the administrative bureaucracy. Witnesses recorded in the Sama,f Tablet were a kala-priest, a sukallu 'minister' or 'vizier' at court, a sakin [emi 'chief official of the province', and a bel pfbati 'provincial governor'.
Date formula. The month and year date of the entitlement event emerges as a regular feature of Entitlement nara inscrip



216 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
tions beginning with the Second Dynasty of Isin. It is noteworthy that the date rubric of the SamaJ Tablet invokes Babylon and not Sippar, the site of the Ebabbar temple and its associated prebend. This indicates that the date probably corresponds to the point in time at which the royal grant was made and a clay tablet recording the grant was sealed, all of which apparently took place at the royal court at Babylon. This in turn implies that date formulae on other Entitlement naras may not necessarily indicate the time and place at which the nara was executed and set up, but may refer rather to the time and place at which the entitlement event transpired.
'Copy of the royal seal of allocations'. As discussed above in Chapter Four (in the section Sealing and the durability of entitlement), the expression gabare kunuk §arri §a §ipreti "Copy of the royal seal of allocations," appears in the 11th through to the 7th centuries as a regular feature of Entitlement nara inscriptions commemorating royal events. Outside of the Entitlement nara corpus, the phrase is attested only once, upon a dynastic seal dated to the Neo-Babylonian period (also discussed above, in Chapter Four; for publication of the seal, see Frankfort 1971: pI. XXXVI k and p. 220). In other words, we would not expect to find the phrase outside of the corpus of Entitlement naras, and we would anticipate encountering it in an Entitlement nara inscription dated to the reign of Nabu-apla-iddina.
Prohibitions. The imprecative division of the SamaJ Tablet inscription should dispel any lingering reluctance to include this artifact among members of the Entitlement nara corpus. Individual imprecations making up the Prohibitions section are seen again and again throughout the corpus: a warning specifically against a future king who should claim, take away, reduce, or grant the entitlement to another, to the province, or to himself. Moreover, that future king is enjoined from harming nare Juatu, 'that nara'-i.e., the nara with which the entitlement is commemorated. 'That nara' in vi 43 is obviously a reference to the Sippar Sama§ Tablet itself. The inscription of the Sippar SamaJ Tablet thereby identifies itself as a (stone) nara, a feature that



CHAPTER 6: DEBATABLE MEMBERS OF THE CORPUS 217
further attests to its status as a member of the Entitlement naru corpus.
Divine curses. The curse section is eleven lines long, and fits within expected parameters for Entitlement naru inscriptions from the 10th through 7th centuries. The fact that three gods profoundly involved in the entitlement are the only gods invoked in the curses is consistent with like situations found elsewhere in the corpus. The content of the curses is unremarkable in comparison to the other Entitlement naru curses of the ninth century: depriving the malefactor of heirs and descendants, and of his health and well-being. The final curse, depriving the transgressor of burial, is related to concern with proper funerary rites and cult after death evinced elsewhere in the corpus.
Discussion: the relief (fig. 11)
The climactic event of the long narrative of the inscription, lines i l-iv 42, is the installation of a new cult image of Samas, the Mesopotamian sun-god. The leitmotif of the narrative is the inter-dependent relationship of light and vision, appropriate themes for a monument profoundly connected to the temple of the sun-god and the plurality of his manifestations as deity of sunlight, oracular vision, justice and truth, as well as to the re-appearance of his long-sought cult image. This understanding of the inscription shapes the following explication of the relief, and vice versa. I will discuss the iconographic elements of the relief first and then consider the relief in the context of the relevant textual passages: the three epigraphs located within the relief field, and the narrative of the inscription. At the center of the relief field is a large sun disk-reaching higher than the human figures present in the scene-standing upright on edge upon an altar. To the right of the altar sits the god Samas, facing left, iconographically marked as divine by his size, horned crown, seated position vis-a.-vis the other figures in the relief, and signaled specifically as Samas by the rays streaming out from his shoulders, the details of his throne, and perhaps his grasp of the 'rod and ring', iconographic insignia associated with the sun god elsewhere, most famously in the relief of the Law



218 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
Stele of /jammurapi (fig. 14). To the left of the sun disk, opposite the seated Samas, facing right, are three standing figures. The first, that is, the leader of the small procession and the one closest to the sun disk, wears a cap and no beard, indicating that he is a priest; he touches the altar with his left hand and leads the figure behind him with his right. The second figure sports headgear and a beard signalling royalty; he is slightly taller than the leading figure. The third figure wears a homed crown and robe signaling divinity, appears to be female, and has both hands raised. These elements of the relief yield a composition well-known in Mesopotamian art history as a presentation scene. This type of scene is best attested on cylinder seals from the Ur III period, and depict a person being led by a figure who grasps his hand into the presence of a major deity. Similarly, the scene on the Samas Tablet lends itself to the interpretation that the king is being led into the presence of the god Samas-represented in the scene both by the sun disc and by the seated anthropomorphic figure-at the hand of a priest, presumably an erib bfti, literally, 'one who enters the temple'. This was a designation for priests whose duties required them to enter the sanctuary of the god they served, the place where the divine image was kept and which was the most sacred part of the temple. (See, for example, v 20-27 in which food allotments granted to the sangu-priest are reckoned according to the allotments of the eribut bfti, the 'ones who enter the temple' or 'the status of those who enter the temple'.) Less straightforward is interpretation of the elements surrounding the seated anthropomorphic Samas. Jacobsen suggested that this is a representation of the sanctuary of the god, viewed from the side, and that the two divine torsos are at opposite corners of the front of the shrine, which is obscured by the angle of our viewpoint. Reiner (1996: 311) sees also a representation of an architectural edifice: "une colonne indique sans doute I' entree." The first epigraph in the relief field (epigraph A, above) proclaims: "Image of Samas, great lord, resident of the Ebabbar, the one within Sippar." As noted above, the epigraph foreshadows the first lines of the main text, which narrates the return 0 f Samas' divine favor to Sippar and the re-discovery, re-creation



CHAPTER 6: DEBATABLE MEMBERS OF THE CORPUS 219
and re-consecration of his divine image as well as its re-installation in the Ebabbar. The visual correlations of Epigraph B are less obvious: "Sin, Samas, and IStar, set upon the face of the apsu, between Niral] (and) the support pole." The three named gods correspond to the three astral disks over the sun-god's head: a crescent moon, a four-pointed star with four radiating bands of rays, and an eightpointed star. Niral], (dMUS), the snake-god, corresponds to the two-torsoed figure arching over the enthroned deity, with the curved pole descending from the heads to the ground representing the body of the snake. Akkadian timmu 'support pole' corresponds to the palm-pole in front of Samas. In the mythic realm, apsu is the subterranean waters, the abyss, and the domain of Ea/Enki, god of freshwaters, rituals, and associated with purification (in which role he is invoked in the main text in lines iv 22-23, below). The term apsu also designates a feature of the temple: a basin, cistern, or pool of fresh water (Burrows 1932; see also Black, Green, and Rickards 1992, s.v. abzu and fig. 18, and CAD A/2, s.v. apsu). As such, it played a prominent role in the ritual for consecration of the cult image (Burrows 1932: 239-40, and Jacobsen 1987: n. 24). In this relief, the cultic apsu has been seen represented visually by the space above the cult statue embossed with astral symbols (so CAD A/2, s.v. apsu 3, citing epigraph C), whereas the mythical apsu has been seen as represented by the band of wavy lines below the relief that is embossed with four stars (see discussion of Rashid 1967: 303-4). Epigraph C: "Herald of Samas, snake of two-faces," certainly refers to the twin torsos above Samas holding the ropes attached to the altar supporting the sun disk. Elements from the main inscription are reflected in the relief as well-or vice-versa, as the relief was probably carved before the text was inscribed. Brinkman (1976: 183-4) proposed that nip!;za in line 18 referred to the sun disc shown in the relief. As part of his argument, he postulated that sutru~u, "a stem most commonly employed in passages concerned with the construction of roofs of buildings, would not be unexpected if one compares the mode of support for the disc shown in the picture on the tablet." In other words, Brinkman suggested that the manner in



220 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
which the sun disc was shown, "supported by what seem to be two ropes grasped in the hands of two divine protomes (wearing horned crowns) projecting from the front of the roof of the shrine" was comparable to the way roofs were erected in Babylonia. In the relief, the sun disc stands upon an altar or table which seems to be suspended from the ropes from up above. It is clear that the relief depicts a cultic scene, one involving the major actors of the Entitlement nara event: the king who granted the entitlement, the recipient of the entitlement, and the god Samas, in whose temple the prebend was granted and whose cult is the focus of the long narrative. The god is represented by a sun disc upon an altar and by an enthroned anthropomorphic figure, which is depicted seated within a temple sanctuary. These three entities are also the main actors in the narrative portion of the inscription, a narrative that culminates in the re-installment 0 f the divine image of Samas in the Ebabbar-and we should recall here that the first caption (Caption A) and the opening lines of the inscription both explicitly refer to the "Image of the god Samas" and the "god Samas" that are "resident of the Ebabbar, the one within Sippar." We are on solid ground therefore to connect the narrative with the relief scene, and to conclude that the sculpted figure of Samas on the right, depicted as seated within his sanctuary, represents not so much the god Samas in general, but specifically the god Samas manifest in the re-installed cult image. The four arms of the double-torsoed serpent, Niran, appear to be in motion, straining against the weight of the altar supporting the sun-disc. The angle of the ropes they hold also convey an impression of dynamism rather than stasis. Upon close examination, the visible left leg of the altar appears to be suspended slightly above the surface on which the scene takes place, all of which suggests that the altar supporting the niplJu-disc is being raised from above, removed from its central position in the temple now that the reconstituted anthropomorphic cult image has been restored to its proper place. On the left side of the relief, the sanga-priest of Sippar, NabO-nadin-sumi, leads the king NabO-apla-iddina into the presence of Samas, who, in the form of his re-created cult image,



CHAPTER 6: DEBATABLE MEMBERS OF THE CORPUS 221
had taken up his traditional residence in the Ebabbar sanctuary. As members of the audience viewing the relief, we are witness to King Nabfi-apla-iddina being received by the enthroned divinity, led at the hand of the dutiful and dutifully rewarded Jangu-priest. The SamaJ Tablet thus does conform to the functional and descriptive definition of Entitlement narus proposed by the present study. It meets the chronological and geographical parameters defined by the undisputed members of the corpus. Its size, shape, and material comply with the physical characteristics evinced by the Entitlement narus. Its inscription commemorates a royal grant of a temple sinecure. Moreover, the inscription adheres to the structure common to all members of the Entitlement naru corpus and features specific terminology not found outside of the corpus. The subject matter of the relief corresponds to relief scenes found elsewhere in the corpus, in which the major actors involved in the entitlement event are depicted engaged in cultic behavior. In every measurable aspect Artifact C, N abo.apla-iddina BBSt 36, the Sippar SamaJ Tablet, conforms to the functional and descriptive definition of the Entitlement narus, and should be considered henceforth a member of the corpus.
ARTIFACT D: SAMAS-SUMA-UKIN AIO 16
The final artifact to be considered in this chapter is a black stone tablet, without relief imagery, approximately 18 x lOx 3.5 cm. It is dated to the reign of Samas-suma-ukln (667-648), the last king represented in the corpus of datable Entitlement narus. First published by N. M. Nikolskij, Drevnosti vostocnja I, 2 (Moscow 1889) 143-66, pI. IX 1-4, the inscription was subsequently re-edited by Weidner (1952-53: 43-5, Ahang 1) in an article on business documents from the seventh century. In his article, Weidner noted that the object "seems to have been altogether forgotten." He based his edition of the text on the photographs published by Nikolskij, unaware that in the intervening years the artifact itself had entered the collection of British Museum (1952-53: 43, n. 15). A brief description of the stone and a photograph of its obverse were published in the British



222 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
Museum Quarterly 16 (see Gadd 1951), and, as noted by Weidner, no mention was made there of its previous publication. Artifact D has heretofore not been considered among the socalled kudurrus. Nonetheless, in his description of the object Gadd (1951: 44) wrote: "This belongs to the class of memorial tablets, dating from late Babylonian times," implying an affiliation with the artifacts published by King in Babylonian B oundary Stones and Memorial Tablets in the British Museum (BBSt). The inscription documents the purchase of a house in good repair and a quantity of land, including a stand of date palms, along a canal levy in Uruk. I was able to study the artifact in the spring of 1996, and a new edition of the text with a few improved readings is offered below.

He wrote that "SES sieht etwas seltsam aus, kommt aber VAS I 70 v 9 in etwa der gleichen Form und in derselben Verbindung v or. " As noted by Weidner, the unusual sign form in this text is paralleled in VAS I 70, an Entitlement naru dating to the reign of Sargon II, NeoAssyrian king who ruled Babylonia 709-705. It is a ligature of d and SES, with d written above SES. The passage from the Sargon II inscription (VAS I 70), lines v 9-12 reads:

Discussion
The artifact is not included in Steinmetzer's catalogue, nor in Seidl's (Brinkman's catalogue of sources in Political History ends with the reign of Salmaneser, 726-722). Two Entitlement narus date to the reign of Samas-suma-ukln: BBSt 10, a plaque-shaped stele with relief carving, commemorating a royal restoration of land, and AnDr 12, 302, also a plaque-shaped stele with reliefs, commemorating a royal grant of a temple prebend. Discussion of Artifact D addresses whether it or any stone tablet without reliefs should be included in the corpus of Babylonian Entitlement narus.
The text can be summarized as follows:

Price 9-10

Sealing and witnesses 9-23
Date 23-24
"Fingernail impression of Nabil-abbe- 25 usallim (the seller) as his seal"
Up to line 18, the text employs the same structure and formulary as regular Neo-Babylonian sale documents, that is, records of sale inscribed on clay tablets. The prohibitions and the divine curses, however, are characteristic of the imprecative division of the Entitlement naras. In that respect, Artifact D merits consideration in this chapter. The final line of the text requires comment. The expression ,~upur PN kfma kunukkfsu "fingernail (impression) of PN as his seal," first occurs on Middle Babylonian clay tablets recording business transactions. The phrase appears three times in the Entitlement nara corpus: Marduk-sapik-zeri YOS I 37, Simbar-Sipak BBSt 27, and Marduk-zakir-sumi VAS I 35. When the expression appears on clay tablets, it is accompanied by semicircular indentations-actual nail impressions made on the surface of the tablet before the clay hardened. It is also common to find nail impressions on clay tablets from this period without the legend ~upur PN kfma kunukkfsu.
Stone tablets clearly cannot receive such impressions, yet the clause "fingernail (impression) of PN as his seal" appears in the Entitlement nara corpus nonetheless. The statement is analogous to other phrases on Entitlement naras that refer to sealing (see Chapter Four, above, in the section on Sealing (stone) narus?). Even though a seal impression itself was precluded by the medium of stone, the nara inscription preserved a permanent



228 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
record of the sealing and the witnesses to the sealing-either made by impression of a cylinder seal or fingernail. The majority of artifacts examined in the present study occur in the shape of upright stelae, and bear sculpted relief imagery as well as text. It has been argued that the function of these artifacts was to commemorate and protect an entitlement in perpetuity, and that the reliefs are an integral component to ensure the survival of the naru and the entitlement it chronicled. A few members of the corpus occur in the shape of tablets rather than ostensibly free-standing stelae. Because the inscriptions upon these artifacts commemorate the same types of events as do the inscriptions on stelae, because they employ the same textual structure to commemorate those events as do the stelae inscriptions, and because most of them bear the same type of reliefs as do the stelae, this study has presumed that the tabletshaped artifacts served the same function as the stelae-shaped artifacts, and that the shape can be considered a physical variation within the same genre-a variation dictated by anyone or combination of chronological and geographical factors, or even a question of resources and expense. The tablet-shaped members of the genre have been included under the Akkadian term naru-because that is the tenn by which the artifacts, both steleshaped and tablet-shaped, were designated by the Babylonians. There are six tablet-shaped Entitlement narus with reliefs, clustered between the reigns of Itti-Marduk-baHitu (1139-1132) and Adad-apla-iddina (1068-1047), all kings of the Second Isin Dynasty, within a maximum span of 92 years. A set of tablet-shaped artifacts commemorate the same type of events but do so without two of the most prominent characteristics of the Entitlement naru genre-the sculpted relief carvings and the divine curses. I have argued in the context of the structure of the naru inscription (Chapter Three) that these two features were intended to accomplish the same function: to protect the entitlement and the naru itself by calling divine retribution upon a would-be transgressor. The circumstance that artifacts lacking one of these features consistently lack the second as well supports the notion that the two features, do, in fact, serve the same purpose.



CHAPTER 6: DEBATABLE MEMBERS OF THE CORPUS 229
Nonetheless, the tablet-shaped stones without reliefs do commemorate entitlements, and they do so while adhering to the textual structure characteristic of the rest of the corpus. Other scholars working on the corpus as a whole have included these objects in their studies. King published four of them in Babylonian Boundary Stones and Steinmetzer included all six of them. Nevertheless, while including them with the so-called kudurrus, both authors designate them as stone tablets rather than boundary stones, a term applied in their studies only to the stelaeshaped members of the corpus. Brinkman referred to these artifacts in Political History as 'stone tablets', as he categorized also the tablet-shaped members of the corpus with relief imagery. Seidl included the tablet-shaped stones without reliefs in her catalogue, but in a separate category designated by the letter T ("Tafel"). On the other hand, Seidl did include in her main catalogue, alongside the stele-shaped stones, the tablet-shaped stones with relief imagery. The present study treats the tablet-shaped stones without relief imagery as members of the corpus. The text of Artifact D, however, changes our picture of the tablet-shaped Entitlement narus. The Samas-suma-ukln AiD 16 inscription features a series of divine curses, curses known well from the repertoire of divine curses found upon the stele-shaped and tablet-shaped members of the corpus that do have relief sculptures. Yet this stone tablet does not feature divine symbols sculpted in relief. It is therefore unique in being a tablet-shaped stone without relief imagery but whose inscription does include divine curses. In sum, Samas-suma-ukln AID 16 presents the same features as tablet-shaped members of the corpus without relief carvings. Moreover, by exhibiting divine curses, the inscription is more strongly affiliated with the inscriptions of the corpus than are the other tablet-shaped Entitlement narus without sculpted imagery.
CONCLUSIONS
At this point, BBSt I and BM 135743 (Artifacts A) should continue to be included as the sole examples of Entitlement narus



230 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
fashioned out of clay, a type of artifact whose existence is indicated by textual evidence elsewhere in the corpus. On the strength of that evidence and the existence of these objects, we should expand the foregoing definition of the Entitlement naru to include monuments made exceptionally of clay. The present evidence for these rare clay Entitlement narus indicates that they did not bear any imagery, in relief or any other form, and that, thus far, their existence is not attested after the reign of Nazi-Maruttas. Meli-Sipak MDP IV 163 (Artifact B) should be added to the present catalogue of Entitlement narus, and this brings to six the total number of Entitlement narus dated to that 33rd and fourth from final king of the Kassite Dynasty. Its incorporation supports Seidl's observation that the earlier Entitlement narus were larger than the later ones, and that only early examples of the genre (Seidl's pre-canonical style) display imagery featuring architectural elements and anthropomorphic depictions of divinities (which are not to be confused with representations of the anthropomorphic cult image, as depicted in the relief of N abfi-aplaiddina BBSt 36, the Sippar Sama§ Tablet). The presence of a secondary Elamite inscription, added to the stele after it was removed to Susa, indicates that the Entitlement narus were counted among the prized treasures of successful Elamite forays alongside other more famous royal monuments removed from Babylonia, such as the Victory Stele of Naram-Sfn and the Law Stele of /jammurapi.
Nabfi-apla-iddina BBSt 36, the Sippar Sama§ Tablet (Artifact C) is unquestionably a member of the Entitlement naru corpus. It is distinguished by the richness of its long and detailed narrative and complex relief sculpture. Samas-suma-ukln AfO 16 (Artifact D), the final artifact considered here, also meets the formal and functional parameters of an Entitlement naru. Its inclusion in the corpus adds to our repertoire of like artifacts that commemorate purchase of property and are intended to ensure that claim to an entitlement thus acquired remain unchallenged. It is unique in the corpus in having a senes of divine curses but no divine visual representations.



CHAPTER 6: DEBATABLE MEMBERS OF THE CORPUS 231
The present chapter has examined four artifacts against the backdrop of the formal definition of the Babylonian Entitlement narus presented in Chapter Five, arguing that all four should be included in the corpus of the Entitlement narus. The next, and final, phase of this investigation, considers the genre of the Babylonian Entitlement narus within the greater context of Mesopotamian culture.
'Walker and Collon 1980: Il2 (Addendum 2): "The beginning of the text can now be almost fully restored, and the location of the land is given as GO fdUD.KIB.NUNki x x KUR MAR.nO "on the bank of the Euphrates ... AmuITu." This location is not inconsistent with the idea that both kudurru fragments were found at Sippar." 2These include the Stele of Nariim-Sfn, a well known example, of which the Elamite text was first published in MDP III as text XXIV. Text XXV in the same volume is a similar Elamite inscription added to another Babylonian monument brought to Susa. 3"Von den tiber vierzig in Susa gefundenen, dorthin verschleppten Kudurru ist keiner mit einem Elamischen Text beschriftet worden; hingegen tragen verschleppte Staatsdenkmaler haufig elamische Inschrift." 4"Doch, da einerseits die Reliefbilder-eine Befestigungsanlage, eine mythische bzw. kultische Handlung und ein Symbole tragendes Schiff-anderseits der Rest der babylonischen Inschrift-ein Teil der Fluchformel-fiir einen KuduITU nicht unmoglich sind, ist der Stein hier aufgenommen." SNote that in sentence Ill, Elamite text lines 6-7, Konig has transcribed [suub]-mu-tuMES Me-l[i-dSi-pak-ir-ra hal] Ka-ri-[in-ta§ bu-ma-ah]; see MDP IV, pI. 17 for this line, in which the sign Konig took as MES appears as the upper portion of a single vertical wedge. Konig's transliteration requires the translation: "[I] acquired the stelae (pI.) of Meli-[Sipak] in Kari[ntas]," and such a statement, referring to multiple stelae of Meli-Sipak removed to Elam by Sutruk-NalJlJunte, would seem to require that this artifact be counted among the other stelae-Le., Entitlement narus-dated to MeliSipak and found at Susa. It is likely, however, that the sign transcribed by Konig as MES, which he did not incorporate as such into his translation, is not MES but simply a Personenkeil, rml, written before the royal name, as it is written also before the name Naram-Sln in the Elamite inscription upon the stele of that
Mesopotamian king; see lines 5-6: su-ub-mu-tu mNa-ra-am-d30 "stele of Naram-Sln." According to Steve (1992: 17): "MES, postpose: d'abord signe de pluralite, puis au neo-elamite indique que Ie signe qui precede est un logograme." However, this is a Middle- and not Neo-Elamite text, and the writing [su-ubl-mu-tu is clearly not a logogram. Brinkman (1976a:



232 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS

The reading of this line of the Elamite text should accordingly be emended to [su-ub ]-mu-tu rm'MeJ li'[Sipak] "[ste]le of Merli'-[Sipak]." 6_ tu in Hinke's copy. 7Some of these remarks on the Sippar Sama'S Tablet appear in Slanski 2000. 8A. Hurowitz is preparing a study of the inscription for publication. 9After Brinkman 1968b: 296 City").



Chapter Seven
The Place of the Babylonian Entitlement narus in Mesopotamian Culture
The Babylonian Entitlement narus emerged in the 14th century onto a cultural landscape already shaped by a long established history of literary and visual expression. This chapter will attempt to show not only that the Babylonian Entitlement narus were innovated from indigenous elements, but that their form was devised in light of ancient Mesopotamian royal monumental tradition. After tracing the outlines of the monumental form in Mesopotamia, discussion moves to consideration of selected individual monuments, exploring how their features relate to attributes of the Babylonian Entitlement narus. By investigating the relationship of the Babylonian Entitlement narus to the monuments preceding their appearance, the chapter raises a set of interrelated questions about the form and function of the Entitlement narus and their place in Mesopotamian culture. Finally, this chapter will suggest that the Entitlement naru was conceived in response to evolving socio-political developments taking place in Babylonia as well as the rest of the ancient Near East. After placing their advent within a greater timeline 0 f Mesopotamian monumental expression, this study closes by suggesting what historical factors might have enabled and/or stimulated the innovation of the Entitlement naru in mid-second millennium Babylonia.
233



234 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
THE INNOVATION OF THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NAROS
The Babylonian Entitlement narus constitute a cohesive and definable Mesopotamian artifactual genre, the physical, textual, and visual features of which have been described and investigated in the foregoing chapters. Fashioned out of stone, inscribed with text according to a set pattern, sculpted with a distinctive repertoire of visual imagery, and placed in temples, these artifacts performed a unique and consistent function: the commemoration and perpetuation of entitlement to a on-going source of income. Early examples commemorated the acquisition or affirmation of land and associated privileges through royal grant. The form came also to be used to commemorate transfer of property and sinecures through non-royal gifts as well as through non-royal purchase. Earliest examples of the genre date to the 14th century, when the Babylonian Entitlement naru presumably was innovated in response to a particular set of historical circumstances. The artifact type apparently continued to function for some seven centuries as a productive form for the commemoration and perpetuation of entitlement. The divers elements of the Entitlement narus-their texts, imagery, and physical form-work together to commemorate entitlement. The inscriptions, as shown above in Chapter Three, follow a predictable pattern. Typically accompanied by a brief heading, consisting of a title or name for the naru, and a closing, tusually a colophon, the texts are divisible into two main parts, termed in this study the operative and the imprecative divisions. The operative division, in which the entitlement is described and the details of its acquisition are recorded, has long been recognized as originating in Babylonian legal texts (see notably Brinkman 1976-80: 269; for earlier discussions, see Hinke 1907: 8-36, and Steinmetzer 1922, passim). It is likely that elements of the operative division of individual Entitlement naru inscriptions were copied from standard legal documents, inscribed and sealed on clay tablets in the regular manner of Mesopotamian legal texts (Brinkman 1980-83: 269-70). Several inscriptions state explicitly that they are copies (e.g., Meli-Sipak BBSt 3, Marduk-sapikzeri ZA 65, Marduk-sapik-zeri Sumer 36), and references to seals



CHAPTER 7: ENTITLEMENT NARUS IN MESOPOTAMIAN CULTURE 235
and sealing in the inscriptions, discussed above in Chapter Four, also support the hypothesis that the transactions commemorated by the Entitlement narus were first recorded as legal documents on clay. In contrast, the imprecative division finds its parallels in the tradition of royal monumental inscriptions, whose texts conclude with series of imprecations and divine curses aimed at protecting the monuments on which they are inscribed. Regarding imagery, the divine symbols sculpted on the Entitlement narus, with few exceptions, are firmly established in Mesopotamian iconographic tradition reaching back at least as early as the 3rd millennium. As to physical form, stone monuments with inscribed text and sculpted relief are known throughout the history of Mesopotamia, and these features, too, find their parallels in the lengthy tradition of royal monuments. Thus, the individual elements found in the form of Babylonian Entitlement naru have their origins in long standing Mesopotamian traditions of legal texts, iconography, and royal monuments. The innovation of the Entitlement naru lies in the combining of elements from these deeply rooted yet disparate traditions into a single commemorative form. Mesopotamian legal texts, familiar to most students of Mesopotamia and the subject of numerous specialized studies,l win not be reviewed here, nor win the origins of the symbols of the Entitlement narus, a topic that has been treated in depth by Ursula Seidl (1989). The interrelated concepts of monument and monumentality, however, which have not been considered in previous treatments of this corpus of artifacts, are crucial to understanding function and resonance of the Entitlement narus in Babylonian culture, and are the focus of this chapter's inquiry.
(NA4) NARU '(STONE) MONUMENT'
As demonstrated above in Chapter Two, the Akkadian word naru is the regular Babylonian designation for the artifacts under investigation. Taking into account their place of origin, function, and native designation, this study has coined for these artifacts the term 'Babylonian Entitlement narus'. Within the textual corpus of



236 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
these artifacts, the word naru is applied to objects in the form of upright standing stelae and also in the shape of tablets or plaques, including Nabu-apla-iddina BBSt 36, the Sippar Sama§ Tablet, treated above in Chapter Six (Artifact C). In the foregoing pages of this study, the indigenous Babylonian label naru was cited as one reason for divesting the artifacts of their modern misinterpretation as kudurrus 'boundary markers'. However, in addition to informing us what they were not, the ancient designation naru also identifies what, in their original cultural context, the artifacts typologically were. The Akkadian word naru was borrowed from the Sumerian
n a - r u - a. In Akkadian texts, including the inscriptions under investigation, Akkadian naru can be written with the
Sumerogram n a - r u- a, or n a 4 - r U - a, as well as syllabically.
The Sumerian meaning of n a - r u- a is, literally, 'erected stone' (Cooper 1990: 44), composed of the cuneiform signs n a (or
n a4) signifying 'stone', r u the verb 'to stand', and the post
position element -a marking the completed action of the verb. In addition, writings for naru are often preceded by the determinative na4 'stone', indicating that the word following is an object made of stone.
Sumerian n a - r u - a and Akkadian naru are typically translated 'stele' or 'stone stele'. But while 'stele' is defined as 'an upright or standing stone' (Yon 1997: 79), the terms naru/n a
r u - a are applied in cuneiform texts to objects other than upright standing stones. Cooper (1990: 44), writing about monumental
art in the 3rd millennium, contends that n a - r u - a "can be used to distinguish bas-relief type monuments from statues," and that
n a - r u- a is the "literal word for monument in Sumerian." In
other words, although Sumerian n a - r u- a and Akkadian naru are conventionally understood and translated specifically as '(stone) stele', their more accurate modem equivalent is '(stone) monument'. Moreover, and contrary perhaps to our modern ex
pectations of what constitutes a monument, naru/n a - r u - a can be used to designate artifacts that vary considerably in shape and size, a point made already by Winter (1985: 23), in a study on the Early Dynastic Stele of Eannatum (Stele of the Vultures).



CHAPTER 7: ENTITLEMENT NAROS IN MESOPOTAMIAN CULTURE 237
The medium of stone
While the Mesopotamian landscape of the 14th century was not lacking in cultural traditions, it was largely bereft of hard stone. Soft, light-colored limestone was available in southern Mesopotamia, where local white, grey, and yellow-white varieties were used in architecture (see the recent discussion of Potts 1996: 100-2). Surviving stone monuments, however, both royal monuments and Entitlement narus, seem rarely to be made from this native stone, and the hard stone that was used for monumental expression had to be imported. The foremost characteristic of hard stone is its durability and the quality of immutability it lends to inscriptions and images. In Mesopotamian culture, in which an entity is strongly identified with its image, the symbolic meaning of stone as a medium cannot be underestimated. Stone artifacts that have survived-be they vessels, foundation tablets, wall plaques, sculpture in the round, or stelae-were reserved for prominent and solemn roles as votive objects or royal monuments. Stone statuary, for example, was, according to Frankfort (1970: 45), "intended for temples; the human form was transmitted into stone for the express purpose of confronting the god." In Ancient Mesopotamian Materials and Industries, Moorey (1994: 23) wrote:
it is important to appreciate that stone sculptures, of whatever size, were to a degree luxuries. Terracotta, even more subject to the depredations of time than stone, was the common medium for statuary and figurines from earliest times through into the first millennium Be. Even the stones most readily available in Mesopotamia, like gypsum and limestone, were overwhelmingly employed for statuary within the great organizations of court and temple; this was not a popular art.
In other words, "(s)tone was rare and expensive in Mesopotamia and its use for inscriptions was always limited," (Gelb, Steinkeller, and Whiting 1991: 2). As early as the 3rd millennium, royal inscriptions bear witness to the importance Mesopotamian monarchs placed on hard stone found in other lands, and expansionist kings boasted of its acquisition with the same breath used to record foreign military conquest. The Sargonic king, Manistusu (2269-2255), wrote that after defeating the Elamite forces, he crossed the Persian Gulf, quarried the



238 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
black stone he found there, loaded it onto his ships, and brought it back to the quay of Akkad (Manistusu, CI: 7-42; as edited in Gelb and Kienast 1990: 76-77). Similarly, his famous son Naram-Sin (2254-2218) proclaimed:
Naram-Sin, mighty king, king of the four quarters, victor of nine battles in one year... He conquered Magan and captured Manium, ruler of Magan. In their mountains he quarried diorite stone and brought it to Agade, his city (RIM 2: E2.1.4.13: i 1-ii 18).
The large blocks of stone acquired abroad by Mesopotamian kings were fashioned into statuary in the round or into narus, (stone) monuments typically sculpted with imagery in bas-relief and incised with cuneiform text. In some cases, the particular type of stone may itself have carried symbolic meaning. In a study of Naram-Sin's Victory Stele, commemorating his military mastery over the Lullubi in Iran, Winter argued that the stone from which the Stele was fashioned originated in the very region of the battle. Its use for commemorating the Akkadian king's foreign triumph was in and of itself a symbolic statement of conquest and control; according to Winter (1999: 71), the stone "would have constituted a not-insignificant part of his victory statement, that he had conquered and possessed himself a piece of the territory itself." Royal stone statues in the round are known from southern Mesopotamia from ca. 2500 to the end of the second millennium.2 Inscriptions on such sculpted images reveal their votive quality: they were dedicated to the god and placed in his or her temple. Inscriptions on the statues of Gudea, ruler of Lagas (ca. 2000), constituting the largest and best known corpus of royal votive statuary, inform us that these objects underwent rituals of creation, consecration, installment in the temple, and received ongoing care in their cultic setting. The rituals resulted in the animation of the statue, enabling it to speak directly to the god, presumably on behalf of Gudea himself or others who petitioned his representation to intercede with the god on their behalf. Like sacred images of the gods, the sculptures of Gudea also received food offerings (Winter 1992: 13), testimony to the animated state of the carved representation. Set in a temple, votive statues in the round were "on-duty" twenty-four hours a day, perfor



CHAPTER 7: ENTITLEMENT NARUS IN MESOPOTAMIAN CULTURE 239
ming cultic service for the god and receIvmg cultic veneration themselves. More importantly, the statue would continue to perform and receive cult long after the living patron who had dedicated it had died; theoretically, his image could perform its pious service and receive offerings for all time. Textual evidence from later periods indicates that ritual aspects of votive statuary were perpetuated in both Babylonian and Assyria into the middle of the first millennium (Winter 1992: 17-18). Less is understood about the function of stone narus and about the intent of their makers. Evidence is scattered, and the narus have not yet been the focus of the same depth of study as have votive statues. It is likely that narus were not subject to the same kind of animating rituals as were the anthropomorphic statues in the round. For example, different terminology was used in reference to the creation of the statue and the creation of a naru. Winter (1992: 21) has drawn attention to Sumerian texts that recount a statue as having been 'born' (TUD), whereas narus are recorded as having been 'fashioned' (DIM).3 The conceptualizations of 'statue' and of 'monument' connoted by these terms of making is consistent with the overall visual impact of the anthropomorphic cult statues in the round versus the impact of monuments featuring sculpted imagery in low relief. It is consistent, moreover, with the different functions of the two kinds of stone sculpture: unlike votive cult statues, narus were not called upon, for example, to speak directly to or to hear messages from the divine. Nevertheless, according to their inscriptions, narus were set in the temple and often dedicated to a god. Moreover, as is made clear by the imprecations and divine curses closing their inscriptions, royal stone narus were intended to preserve a record of the king's achievements for all time. The intended eternal immutability of the stone naru is in this way comparable to the intended eternal service provided by a votive statue.



240 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
MESOPOTAMIAN MONUMENTAL TRADITION
The stone monuments of Mesopotamia, including the Babylonian Entitlement narus, were reviewed by Jutta Borker-KHihn in a twovolume work, Altvorderasiatische Bildstelen und vergleichbare Felsreliefs (1982). Borker-KHihn divided the monuments into two main chronological divisions: those from what she termed the Sumerian-Akkadian world, i.e., from the beginning of the Early Dynastic period to the end of the Old Babylonian period, and those from the Babylonian-Assyrian world, i.e., from after the fall of the First Dynasty of Babylon, ca. 1595, until the end of the Neo-Babylonian kingdom, marked by Cyrus' entry into Babylon in 538. The following remarks review Borker-KHihn's (1982: 49-52) conclusions about the development of monuments in Mesopotamia up to the advent of the Entitlement narus during the hegemony of the Kassite Dynasty, that is, in the Middle Babylonian period. These are followed by a discussion of selected works to illustrate concrete features of the Mesopotamian monumental tradition.
Stelae from the Early Dynastic to the Old Babylonian period
Borker-KHihn surveyed the more than 100 stone fragments representing approximately 50 stelae that are attested from the Early Dynastic period to the end of the Old Babylonian kingdom. The oldest, dated to the early part of the Early Dynastic period, exist in the form of uncomplicated stones that apparently had not been worked to any great extent. Their subject is chiefly the commemoration of cultic building activity. In addition to these simply worked examples, plaque-shaped stones ("Platten") with reliefs are also attested. The earliest surviving stone stele, represented by a fragment from Uruk, is dated to the time when writing makes its first appearance in Mesopotamia, sometime between 3500 and 3000 (Frankfort 1970: 33-5, ilL 34 (originally published in UVB V (1933) pIs. 12-13)). The overall shape of this monument has been characterized as a "boulder," that is, a stone that had been left in its naturally occurring state rather than having been fashioned into any symmetrical or otherwise formal geometric shape



CHAPTER 7: ENTITLEMENT NARUS IN MESOPOTAMIAN CULTURE 241
(Frankfort 1970: 33-4). The subject seems to be lion-hunting, and the complete monument was conceivably sculpted all over its entire surface (Frankfort 1970: 34). In the later part of the Early Dynastic period, the pillarshaped stele ("Pfeilerform") made its debut. These were not much larger than the earlier stelae, their size presumably limited by available materials. Stelae also appear with two flattened sides, that is, an obverse and reverse, such as the Stele of Eannatum (Stele of the Vultures).
This period also saw production of the earliest of the so-called "ancient kudurrus," dating from the Uruk III period to the Sargonic period, from around 3100 to 2159. These are records on stone documenting the purchase of multiple pieces of land by a single individual. They have been discovered in Mesopotamian cities in northern and eastern Babylonia, with the exception of one which was found in the far south in the city of Ur (Gelb, Steinkeller, and Whiting 1991: 3). Like the Entitlement narus, the "ancient kudurrus" are not, strictly speaking, stelae, although the upright free-standing stele-shape is represented in the corpus. The relationship between the Babylonian Entitlement narus and the so-called "ancient kudurrus" is discussed below in the section The ancient kudurrus. During the Akkadian or Sargonic period, a development can be seen in the pillar-shaped stele with a growing degree of standardization. Borker-KHihn (1982: 49) has suggested that this may be a reflection of strong central political authority. Surviving monuments from this era are primarily victory stelae, as opposed to the cultic stelae and "ancient kudurrus" witnessed earlier. The best preserved example is the Victory Stele of Naram-Sfn, which in addition exhibits a number of stylistic innovations. In the succeeding periods known for the reigns of Gudea and the Ur III Dynasty, cultic stelae re-emerge as the main type of commemorative monument. These are primarily of two types: flat, plaque-type stones with reliefs, and small, free-standing stelae. Stylistically, the imagery reveals a strong affiliation with the Akkadian period, notably in idealized depictions of the ruler. The best preserved example of an inscribed and sculpted stele from this period is the fragmentary Stele of Ur-Nammu.



242 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
Stelae from the last historical period before the appearance of the Entitlement narus, the Old Babylonian period, continue in the iconographic style of the Ur III period, that is, hearkening back to the style of the Sargonic stelae. Stelae inscribed with collections of laws, as exemplified by the celebrated Law Stele of ljammurapi, seem to play an important role in the monumental stone expression of the period. In summarizing the stelae dating from the Early Dynastic to the end of the Old Babylonian period, Borker-Klahn observed that they were found primarily in southern Mesopotamia. She maintained that the style of stelae from this entire span of time was fairly conservative, and surmised that, in the last analysis, artistry of the Old Babylonian period represented only a (final) developmental stage of the Sumero-Akkadian tradition (BarkerKHihn 1982: 50).4
Stelae from the Middle Babylonian period
Outside of the Entitlement narus, there are only two monuments known to date to this period, a pair of votive stelae dedicated by an official of Nazi-Maruttas, one of which was found in the courtyard of the bIt akltu in Uruk (Barker-Klahn 1982: 171, nrs. 118-19). The 72 and 85 cm tall stelae, described as unformed and superficially worked, are carved with a relief image of Lama, a protective goddess. The text, a prayer to Inanna for the life of Nazi-Maruttas, is inscribed on the deity's skirt. Thus, aside from the numerous Entitlement narus, the form of the stone stele seems in this period to have all but disappeared (BarkerKlahn 1982: 52),5
Entitlement narfis and 'monumentality'
When considering Entitlement narus in the context of other Mesopotamian stelae, Borker-Klahn focused on shape and iconography and found little in common between the Entitlement narus and other stelae, what she termed "Bildstelen." Regarding shape, Barker-Klahn concluded that the major Entitlement naru types could be accounted for by two factors: the natural shape of the stones and the genre's dependency on the form of the clay tablet (i.e., as a legal document). According to Barker-KHihn



CHAPTER 7: ENTITLEMENT NAROS IN MESOPOTAMIAN CULTURE 243
(1982: 51), even the quadriform Entitlement narus evidence no particular directional orientation, a characteristic of other Mesopotamian stelae.6 Concerning their iconography, Barker-Klahn (1982: 51) found the Entitlement narus remarkably static.7 Barker-Klahn pointed out additional differences between the Entitlement narus and other Mesopotamian monuments. After the Early Dynastic period, stelae exhibit carved imagery on only one face, whereas the Entitlement narus do not seem to follow any particular program for the orientation of their reliefs. In addition, Barker-Klahn (1982: 51) characterized the quality of the Entitlement naru sculptures as uneven and often poor, and noted, as did Seidl, a decrease in the size of the Entitlement narus over time: "Mit fortschreitender Lebensdauer der Gattung zeigen die Denkmaler sogar immer geringere Ausmasse." In sum, BarkerKlahn differentiated sharply between the Entitlement narus and Mesopotamian stelae proper on the grounds of monumentality. According to Barker-Klahn (1982: 51), "what fundamentally distinguishes Kudurru( s) from stelae is the absolute lack of inner and outer monumentality.,,8 Barker-Klahn did not elaborate on what she meant by "the lack of inner and outer monumentality" on the part of the Entitlement narus, but her observations indicate that it has to do with a want of overall shaping, absence of directional orientation to their reliefs, uneven or poor relief carving, and diminutive size. In other words, as monuments go, the Entitlement narus are not terribly impressive, and therefore, lacking in 'monumentality'. But would the Entitlement narus have been lacking in monumentality in the view of a Mesopotamian audience? Survey of Mesopotamian stelae reveals that very few exhibit the regular geometric forms that a modern audience has come to expect from its monuments. Some Mesopotamian stelae do exhibit symmetrical shapes, such as the Stele of Eannatum (Stele of the Vultures) and the Victory Stele of Nariim-Sfn, both of which also exhibit flattened obverse and reverse sides. But many Mesopotamian stelae, such as the Law Stele of !fammurapi, do not. Moreover, a number of the Babylonian Entitlement narus do exhibit overall forms that clearly have been deliberately shaped. Several evince a symmetrical shape with clear obverse and reverse sides,



244 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
e.g., the (fragmentary) naru of Enlil-nadin-abi CT XXXVI, Marduk-zakir-sumi RA 16, and Samas-suma-ukln BBSt 10. One, Meli-Sipak BBSt 4, has been sculpted into a flat-sided regular quadriform, with representations of brickwork columns at the comers, coming to a pyramid at the top (see King 1912: pIs. XXIII-XXX; for an uninscribed naru with very similar decoration, see Seidl 1989: pI. 18a). A number of others, such as Meli-Sipak BBSt 3, Merodach-baladan I BBSt 5, Nebuchadnezzar I BBSt 6, and Marduk-apla-iddina II VAS I 37, exhibit deliberately flattened sides. Additional stele-shaped Entitlement narus without regular geometric shapes or flattened sides still evince some degree of shaping; see, for example the stelae of Marduknadin-abbe BBSt 7 and BBSt 8, which come to almost pointed tops (King 1912: pIs. XLII-LII and pIs. LIII-LXVI), or Enlilnadin-apli BBSt II, which in shape evokes an egg (King 1912: pIs. I-IV). All the Entitlement narus evidence a visually appealing highly polished surface. Bulges and indentations exhibited by many ancient monuments, perceived as irregularities by a modern audience, may not have been so disturbing to the ancients. It is worth considering that the aesthetic values of Babylonian stone sculpture may have favored maximal surface area and a highly polished surface over achievement of an idealized geometric form, a preference that would be consonant with circumstances imposed by the rarity of indigenous hard stone in Mesopotamia. On the subject of size, with the exception of a few wellknown royal stelae, i.e., the Stele of Eannatum (Stele of the Vultures), the Victory Stele of Nariim-Sfn, the stelae of Gudea, the Stele of Ur-Nammu, and the Law Stele of fJammurapi, survey of Borker-KHihn's study reveals that the pre-Kassite "Bildstelen" of her corpus are not significantly larger than the Entitlement narus. Moreover, the disparity in size that does exist between royal narus and Entitlement narus may be accounted for by dissimilarity in the status of their patrons: Babylonian Entitlement narus are not royal stelae, and the individuals who commissioned them could not have had the same access to large and more impressive stones as did Mesopotamian kings.



CHAPTER 7: ENTITLEMENT NAROS IN MESOPOTAMIAN CULTURE 245
It was the combination of the medium of stone, the careful incising of cuneiform in deliberately archaizing lapidary style, a highly polished surface, and the selection and deployment of evocative divine symbols along with other sculpted elements-in other words, what Winter (1995: 2579) has characterized as "positively encoded aesthetic endowments"-that would have generated for the Entitlement narus a positive aesthetic response when viewed by their audience. In addition, placement of the Entitlement narus in the temple would have heightened their overall impact, sanctioning their monumental form as well as their function with the gravity endowed by sacred space. 'Monumentality' is culture-specific. Exploration of what features contribute to 'monumentality' for a Mesopotamian audience-an inquiry that would be welcome in research on Near Eastern culture, art history, and historiography, among other areas-lies outside the scope of this work. But even in the absence of such a study, it is irrefutable that the Entitlement narus are members of the category of objects designated naru/n a - r (i - a '( stone) monument'. Regardless of precisely what qualities constituted 'monumentality' in an ancient Mesopotamian setting, the artifacts investigated in this study belong, by ancient Mesopotamian definition, to the typology of monuments.
THE "ANCIENT KUDURRUS"
The term kudurru was first applied by Gelb (1952: 3-4) to this group of third millennium stone artifacts when he listed eight of them in the second volume of Materials for the Assyrian Dictionary. Complete publications of the 57 known "ancient kudurrus" can now be found in Gelb, Steinkeller, and Whiting (1991), Earliest Land Tenure Systems in the Ancient Near East: Ancient Kudurrus (henceforth, Earliest Land Tenure). The twovolume publication deals with the records of purchase or sale of immovable and movable property in third millennium Mesopotamia and proposes interpretations for their socio-economic and legal significance.



246 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
The records published in Earliest Land Tenure consist of two very different types of documentation, what the authors have termed "ancient kudurrus" on the one hand, and "sale documents" on the other. The "ancient kudurrus" are third millennium stone artifacts with inscriptions and occasionally imagery that commemorate the transfer of property. The sale documents are records on clay, dealing with what is usually a single purchase or sale of any kind of property, both immovable and movable (Gelb, Steinkeller, and Whiting 1991: 3). Whereas sale documents on clay are attested throughout the history of written records from ancient Mesopotamia, "ancient kudurrus" are limited to the third millennium. As explained in the book's introduction, publication of the "ancient kudurrus" was expanded to include the sale documents when the authors realized that analysis of one kind of documentation could not proceed without analysis of the other. Earliest Land Tenure thus treats 57 "ancient kudurrus" and 282 sale documents. The inscriptions of the "ancient kudurrus" are written in Sumerian or Akkadian, and it is not always clear which language is represented. Difficulties in reading the early script also hamper understanding exactly what is being documented by each artifact. All concern parcels of land, and most of them contain prices and terminology known from other records of purchase. Some of the same persons and land parcels figuring in the "ancient kudurrus" appear on clay sale documents that are also published in Earliest Land Tenure, e.g., nos. 22 and 23, and the sale documents treated in the appendix to no. 23. When first deciphered, the "ancient kudurrus" were seized upon by Assyriologists because the artifacts demonstrated that private individuals or individual families could own land, in contrast to prevailing scholarly models of third millennium social history positing that land ownership was limited to the institutions of palace and temple (for a list of these discussions, see Gelb, Steinkeller, and Whiting 1991: 2). In sum, even though the inscriptions from the "ancient kudurrus" are not completely understood, we can be fairly confident that they commemorated transfer of land from one private owner to another.



CHAPTER 7: ENTITLEMENT NAROS IN MESOPOTAMIAN CULTURE 247
In analyzing the structure of the inscriptions, the authors of Earliest Land Tenure had to exclude some inscriptions that were unintelligible or insufficiently preserved. In general, the remaining transactions exhibit the following elements in the following order:
Description of commodity (land, animals, or persons) Price (in silver) Statement of transaction ("the price was given to the seller(s) ," or "the seller( s) received") Statement of customary practice signaling that the transaction was complete (e.g., "the seller spread the oil," or the seller and the witnesses attended a meal served by the buyer) List of witnesses
Most of the "ancient kudurrus" record multiple transactions, and the above structure or some variation thereof is repeated for each transaction. Gelb, Steinkeller, and Whiting (1991: IS) propose that "once the buyer accumulated a considerable number of such records (either multiple or individual), he had them copied on a stone kudurru, which he then deposited in a temple, to serve as a permanent and public record of his purchases." Whereas the so-called "ancient kudurrus" are limited to the third millennium, from ca. 3100 to 2159, i.e., from Uruk III through the Sargonic Period, first attestation of the Akkadian word kudurru occurs no earlier than the 14th century. As acknowledged by Gelb, Steinkeller, and Whiting (1991: 1-2), the term kudurru for these objects is therefore anachronistic, although the usefulness of the term "ancient kudurru" is weighed and defended (Gelb, Steinkeller, and Whiting 1991: 21-24). A relationship between the two artifactual genres cannot be dismissed simply on the ground that the label kudurru for these third millennium objects is misleading: as this inquiry has shown, kudurru is a misnomer for the second and first millennium artifacts investigated in the present study as well. Borker-Klahn (1982: 50) characterized the so-called "ancient kudurrus" as free-standing "milestone-type kudurrus.,,9 As noted above, very few of the "ancient kudurrus" occur in the shape of



248 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
stelae; as stated by Gelb, Steinkeller, and Whiting (1991: 5): "(b)y far the most common form of ancient kudurrus is in the shape of tablets (square, rectangular, or round), slabs, or plaques." Other forms include obelisks (two), stelae (two), a disk, a vessel, and a cylinder. Two occur in the shape of humanoid statues, one is in the shape of a bird, one possibly a sheep. They are, on the whole, much smaller than royal monuments as well as the Babylonian Entitlement narus. Of the 29 "ancient kudurrus" published in Earliest Land Tenure for which height is preserved or can be confidently estimated, 24 range from 4 to 25 cm. Only five of the "ancient kudurrus" extend outside that range: one tablet 32 cm in height, a disc estimated to have reached about 40 cm, a broken human figure measuring 42 cm, and a complete one at 75.8 cm. In comparison, the Entitlement narus range from 15 to 91.5 cm in height. The largest so-called "ancient kudurru" is the Manistusu Obelisk, which in its modern, decapitated state, currently stands 144 cm tall; note that it, too, was recovered at Susa, another trophy of Sutruk-Nabbhunte's Elamite raids into Babylonia. This monument commemorates multiple purchases of land by the Sargonic king, Manistu8u, whose acquisition of foreign stone was referred to in the preceding section of this chapter. At almost one and one-half meters tall, it towers above the rest of the "ancient kudurrus" and it is probably not coincidental that it is the only one commemorating land purchases made by a king. It has no relief sculpting. Of the 57 "ancient kudurrus," only five have imagery: the Blau Obelisk (number 10 in Earliest Land Tenure), the Blau Plaque (11), the Usumgal Stele (12), and the Figure aux Plumes (18) have carvings in low relief; partial representation of a human head is also preserved on the fragmentary Lagash Stele (19). The reliefs of the Blau Obelisk, the Blau Plaque, and the Figure aux Plumes are thought to depict customary symbolic practices signaling the completion of a transaction. For example, the figures on the Blau Obelisk may be engaged in food preparation (Gelb, Steinkeller, and Whiting 1991: pI. 11 and discussion pp. 40-1), an image possibly connected to a meal prepared at the conclusion of a sale, a practice attested in inscriptions of other "ancient kudurrus" and known from Old



CHAPTER 7: ENTITLEMENT NARUS IN MESOPOTAMIAN CULTURE 249
Babylonian land sale texts as well (Gelb, Steinkeller, and Whiting 1991: 243-4). Figures depicted on the Blau Plaque may be participants in the rite of driving a clay cone into a wall, similarly "symbolizing the transfer of the sold field to the buyer" (Gelb, Steinkeller, and Whiting 1991: 41, 240-41, and pI. 12). The Usumgal Stele, a stele-shaped quadriform, reaches a height of 22 cm and is the tallest of the "ancient kudurrus" with reliefs. Even so, it is only two-thirds the height of the smallest of the stele-shaped Entitlement narus, Meli-Sipak BBSt 4, which stands 36 cm tall. Its relief presumably depicts ritual/legal actions performed at the time of the transaction (Gelb, Steinkeller, and Whiting 1991: 43-6 and pIs. 13-15). In size, shape, and relief imagery, the Usumgal Stele probably comes closest of any of the "ancient kudurrus" to the form of the Babylonian Entitlement naru.
By commemorating purchases of land, the "ancient kudurrus" do memorialize acquisition of entitlement to a source of income, and in this regard the two genres of the "ancient kudurrus" and the Babylonian Entitlement narus are similar: functionally, both commemorate acquisition of entitlement with an inscribed stone artifact. Even though the texts of "ancient kudurrus" lack explicit reference to the inheritability of the property as well as divine sanctions against transgressing the entitlement, the immutability of the record of the event conferred by the medium of stone was intended to ensure that the result of the transaction so documented be permanent. Moreover, the majority of both the "ancient kudurrus" and the Babylonian Entitlement narus serve non-royal interests. A closer connection between the form of the "ancient kudurrus" and the Babylonian Entitlement narus cannot, at present, be demonstrated. The latest "ancient kudurrus" and the earliest Entitlement narus are separated by a gap of more than seven centuries. The "ancient kudurrus" seem to commemorate land purchase(s), whereas the majority of the Babylonian Entitlement narus commemorate acquisition by royal grant. The "ancient kudurrus" do not show any evidence of the formulary RN PN arassu irim "RN granted to PN, his servant" that is emblematic of the Entitlement naru royal grant inscription. In so far as we un



250 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
derstand them, the "ancient kudurrus" were never used to commemorate exemptions or prebends as were the Entitlement narus. The texts of the "ancient kudurrus" can be characterized as simpler and more straightforward than those of the Entitlement narus. They evince no prohibitions or curses characteristic of the Entitlement naru imprecative division, that is, features that link the Entitlement naru texts with the tradition of royal monumental inscriptions. Only a small percentage of the "ancient kudurrus" have reliefs, whereas almost all of the Entitlement narus do. The imagery of the few "ancient kudurrus" that do have relief sculptures contain no divine representations, imagery that on the Entitlement narus invoked the presence, sanction, and protection of the divine for the transaction detailed in the text. In the opinion of this study, the "ancient kudurrus" and the Entitlement narus do not share sufficient formal features to posit any direct connection between the two genres. Finally, unlike the artifacts under investigation, the "ancient
kudurrus" were not designated in cuneiform as naru/n a - r u - a. The Entitlement narus, in the minds of their creators, and presumably, their audience, belonged to the typological category of naru, (stone) monument-a form whose production up to the 14th century was limited to the crown. It is with other members of that class of artifact that we should seek closer formal and functional parallels to the Entitlement narus.
BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS WITHIN MESOPOTAMIAN MONUMENTAL TRADITION
Like Mesopotamian royal monuments, the Babylonian Entitlement narus were fashioned out of stone, inscribed with text, sculpted with imagery, and placed in the temple; significantly, they were also designated with the Sumero-Akkadian term naru. Taking these formal parallels as a basis for comparison, reference to individual royal narus 'monuments' can further illuminate the significance of the monumental form for understanding the function of the Entitlement naru.

252 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
The Stele of Eannatum (Stele of the Vultures)
The Stele of Eannatum (fig. 12) is badly broken. The text opens by relating that the ruler of the city-state Umma had exploited the Gu)edena, "beloved field of Ningirsu, city god of Lagash" (textual interpretation after Cooper 1986: 33-39). The field is identified both as the property of Ningirsu and as the property of Lagas (col. i), implying a unity between the domain of the god and the realm of the city-state. According to the text, Eannatum, ruler of Lagash, was instructed by Ningirsu to fight the ruler of Umma on behalf of the land that had been wrongly appropriated (cols. vii-viii). When wounded in the course of the battle (col. ix), Eannatum struck back with supernatural means, loosing a windstorm and flood upon Umma (col. x). Victorious Eannatum then measured off the boundary of the Gu) edena and erected a monument on the spot (coL xi). He afterward erected a monument in the temple of Ningirsu-which monument is the Stele of Eannatum itself. 10
In the conclusion of the inscription, the defeated ruler of Umma was compelled to swear a series of oaths by the "battle nets" of five different gods, stipulating that he would not transgress the territory of Ningirsu, lest the divine battle nets fall upon his own city. The obverse of the stele depicts a greater-thanlife-size figure holding a huge net in which struggling human captives can be seen (see the discussion of Winter 1985). As Winter (1985: esp. pp. 13-16) has persuasively argued, this figure is more likely a representation of the god Ningirsu, rather than the king Eannatum. The reverse depicts in registers the events leading to the conflict between Lagas and Umma and the climatic battle itself, showcasing Eannatum at the head of his troops. The imagery of the Stele thereby creates a tension between two inter-dependent tellings of the conflict and its resolution: a "mythological" account on its obverse, and a "historical narrative" account on its reverse. As formulated by Winter (1985: 21, and n. 50), "(t)he stele is clearly an attempt to integrate myth and history, one in which different modes of representation are used, while neither mode is totally separate from the other." Consideration of the Stele of Eannatum is instructive for understanding the Babylonian Entitlement narus in



CHAPTER 7: ENTITLEMENT NAROS IN MESOPOTAMIAN CULTURE 253
a number of ways. First, as discussed above in Chapter Four, the text and the imagery of an inscribed and sculpted object do not simply reflect one another; as put by Winter (1985: 22), each medium "has its own agenda" (see also the discussion above, Chapter Four, the section on Textual references to the relief scenes). Second, on the level of content, the text of the Stele of Eannatum relates how control of a piece of arable land was wrested from a neighboring city-state, in other words, how access to a valuable income-producing property was (re)acquired. In this way, the legalistic nature of the events narrated on the Stele is functionally comparable to the operative division of the Entitlement narus, in which acquisition or affirmation of an entitlement is spelled out and accompanied by inscriptional elements, such as an account of sealing and list of witnesses, that are drawn from the Mesopotamian tradition of legal documents. Winter (1985: 23 and n. 56) has already highlighted the legalistic dimension of the Eannatum inscription: by narrating the history of the conflict between Lagas and Umma, the text presents a case for Lagas' valid claim to the contested Gu)edena. The Eannatum text, concerned as it is with the acquisition and maintenance of land, stresses the inviolability of the land's borders; as such, the prominent role of borders and boundaries in the inscriptions of the Babylonian Entitlement narus also finds a parallel in text of the Eannatum Stele. As in the case of the Babylonian Entitlement narus, the conspicuous border-oriented passages of the inscription may have led early interpreters to think that the monument had been set up upon the field to mark the boundaries of the newly defined territory. Frankfort, perhaps guided by the prevailing misconception that the Babylonian Entitlement narus had been set up in the fields, contended that both the Stele of Eannatum and the Entitlement narus stood upon actual land boundaries. In his brief commentary on the Entitlement narus ("kudurrus") in The Art and Architecture of the Ancient Orient, Frankfort (1970: 130) wrote that:
the custom of marking the limits of fields by reliefs naming the gods who vouchsafed the permanence of the boundary is very old; we have seen the Eannatum boundary stone set up at the limits of the field which the ruler of Lagash took again from Umma.



254 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
The parallel drawn by Frankfort between the Entitlement narus and the Stele of Eannatum is apt, but their actual deployment is other than what he had envisioned-the Stele of Eannatum stood in the fields no more than did the Babylonian Entitlement narus: both were erected in temples. In the service of protecting borders, the Eannatum inscription recounts that the ruler of Umma was forsworn "not to transgress the territory of Ningirsu, not to shift the course of its irrigation channels and canals, not to smash its monuments" (after Cooper 1986: 35). Recall that, as noted above in Chapter Three, esp. p. 28, canals function as borders in the field descriptions of the Entitlement narus. Thus, on the level of form, the series of firstperson oaths sworn by the king of Umma is reminiscent of the series of third-person imprecations found in the imprecative division of the Entitlement narus. The king of Umma then calls a curse down upon himself if he should break the agreement: "Whenever I do transgress, may the great battle net of GN, ... , by which I have sworn, descend upon Umma!" (after Cooper 1986: 35). This formula is repeated five times with five different gods. In its spirit and repetition, the passage is reminiscent of the series of divine curses closing the inscriptions of the Entitlement narus. In the Eannatum Stele text, the defeated king of Umma swears by divine "battle nets" not to transgress the territory of Ningirsu, and the relief on one side of the Stele depicts a giant net gripped by a figure who towers over the other persons represented. Whether the giant figure represents the victorious king Eannatum or the god Ningirsu, he holds the net by a handle in the shape of a lion-headed eagle, the symbol of Ningirsu (for this identification, see Winter 1985: 14). The representation of the god by his emblem visually signals divine enforcement for the terms described in the Stele's inscription. In this way, the imagery on the Eannatum stele functions analogously to the divine symbols depicted on the Entitlement narus: both include divine visual emblems to reinforce the binding nature of the event commemorated by the stone monument, i.e., naru. It is in this context, furthermore, that we should recall that in Mesopotamian belief images constitute more than a mere representation, but, in fact, are a manifestation of the divine or human agent depicted.



CHAPTER 7: ENTITLEMENT NAROS IN MESOPOTAMIAN CULTURE 255
Thus, the Eannatum stele provides parallels to the Entitlement narus in that it is an inscribed and sculpted stone monument commemorating the acquisition of an income-producing (landed) entitlement and proclaiming the inviolability of its borders. Its inscription shares with the Babylonian Entitlement narus a text that is grounded in legalistic justification for the situation it presents and is intended to safeguard into the future. The Eannatum Stele was set up in a temple. And, as is made explicit by the majority of the names given to the Entitlement narus, these artifacts were intended to protect the entitlement-not by means of standing on a field boundary to mark it, but by preserving an immutable record of the entitlement's acquisition and by furnishing divine verbal and visual representations to ensure its perpetuity.
The Stele of Ur-Nammu
The very fragmentary Stele of Ur-Nammu (fig. 13) bears a relief in four registers on the obverse and an inscription on the reverse (see Borker-Kllihn 1982: 155-6, nr. 94, pIs. 94:a-k for photographs of the fragments and pI. H for a drawing of a reconstruction (reproduced here as fig. 13)). The relief depicts the king engaged in cultic activity. Better preserved fragments from the upper portion of the stele show him pouring liquid into the roots of potted trees that stand before the figures of a seated god and goddess. In a lower register, the king is depicted carrying a basket full of tools, symbolizing his involvement in building activity, possibly connected with verbal accounts of temple building so characteristic of Mesopotamian royal inscriptions (see Winter 1992: 13-42, for a discussion of the impact of depicting cultic activity in this medium). Unfortunately, very little of the inscription on the reverse of the stele is preserved. What is preserved, though, is important for consideration of the Entitlement narus. The text lists a number of canals that Ur-Nammu had excavated. The list is followed by the beginning of an imprecation section (after Steible 1991 : 136-37): "The man, [who would commit a] misdeed [against it (the stele), (who would damage the inscription inscribed] thereon [...J may DN and DN cur[se (him)!]" We cannot know what Ur

CHAPTER 7: ENTITLEMENT NARUS IN MESOPOTAMIAN CULTURE 257
Nammu intended by listing on his stele the canals dug during his reign, but we should recall (a) the dependence in southern Mesopotamia of agriculture-and civilization!-on canals, and (b) the role canals playas boundary markers. In other words, regardless of the author's intent and the overall logic of the fragmentary inscnptIOn, this preserved section invokes the interrelated concepts of canals, boundaries, and agricultural productivity-issues similarly critical for understanding the Entitlement naras. On the obverse of the Stele, the visual representation of UrNammu watering vegetation in the presence of the divine captures the idea of the king as agent who provides water for agriculture in the service of his gods and his state. The cultic setting depicted in the relief is also reminiscent of the cultic scenes featured in the Entitlement nara relief corpus. The visual depiction of Ur-Nammu libating a plant in the presence of the god and goddess in one scene and carrying a basket of tools in another reinforces connections among the multidimensional roles of the Mesopotamian ruler: serving the gods as human worshipper, as (state) builder, and as the leader responsible for ensuring the agricultural productivity of the land. Many of the reliefs of royal monuments from different periods of Mesopotamian civilization clearly depict cultic activity, and the relief of the Stele of Ur-Nammu is a good example. As soon as we view the Ur-Nammu relief, provided we possess the culture-specific iconographic vocabulary to understand it, we can begin to comprehend, without recourse to a verbal text, what is depicted and the multi-layered implications of the royal cultic acts so represented. The visual representation thus is also comprehensible to a viewer who does not read-the presumed state of most members of the ancient Mesopotamian audience. Similar then to the function of votive statues, the imagery on the Stele of UrNammu re-creates visually the cultic offering of the king-and its acceptance by the god-over and over again, each time the stele is beheld. As with votive statues placed in a cultic setting, the pi0us behavior of Ur-Nammu would be visually performed, into eternity, or as long as the stele was to survive.



258 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
The Babylonian Entitlement naru Meli-Sipak MDP X 87 (fig. 4 and discussion Chapter Two, pp. 42-53), joins the Stele of UrNammu as a stone monument with imagery depicting cultic activity that was set up in the temple. This Entitlement naru commemorates the granting of several valuable land parcels by king MeliSipak to his daughter, ijunnubat-Nanayya. The relief depicts a presentation scene whereby the king leads his daughter into the presence of the seated goddess, Nanayya, before whom stands a censer. The naru' s inscription indicates that a censer (nignakku ) was set in the presence of the goddess Nanayya, and prohibits its removal or damage as well as removal of or damage to the naru itself. While it is possible that an actual physical censer was set up before Nanayya at the time of the naru's installation, there need not have been. The visual representation of the censer, standing between the goddess and her devotees as they enter into her presence, would have provided a perpetual and never-ending recreation of a cultic act. Such a composition is in perfect harmony with an inscription emphasizing the intended inviolability and durability of ijunnubat-Nanayya's newly acquired entitlement. And if, as has been argued above in Chapter Two, ijunnubatNanayya was affiliated with Nanayya's temple, Meli-Sipak's rich gift to his daughter can be seen as elevating ijunnubat-Nanayya's position with respect to the goddess. I I With different emphases, the inscription communicates verbally the same information the relief communicates visually: Meli-Sipak, through his gift, mediates between his daughter and the goddess Nanayya. The relief depicts Meli-Sipak leading his daughter into the presence of the goddess, highlighting the relationship of goddess, king, and princess, and the divine acceptance of their gift, symbolized by the censer occupying the very center of the relief field. The inscription stresses the righteousness, the richness, and the permanence of the king's gift; simultaneously, the never-ending devotion of the king and his daughter are symbolized visually by the inextinguishable and eternal flame of the sculpted censer. As in the Stele of Ur-Nammu, text and image function together to perpetuate infinitely the piety of the human worshippers, the acceptance of their offerings by the gods, and the divine sanction thereby accorded the events preserved through the inscribed text.



CHAPTER 7: ENTITLEMENT NARUS IN MESOPOTAMIAN CULTURE 259
The Law Stele of Ijammurapi
The Law Stele of Ijammurapi, a self-designated naru, IS one of the Babylonian trophies removed to Susa along with a number of Babylonian Entitlement narus (fig. 14). Like the royal monuments reviewed thus far, ijammurapi's stele also provides a perspective on the inter-relation of text and image and on the overall impact of the Entitlement narus. ijammurapi's Law Stele inscription readily lends itself to a three-part division, known conventionally as the Prologue, Laws, and Epilogue. The Prologue relates ijammurapi's excellent qualifications and his divine selection to kingship. The middle section of so-called "Laws" consists of 282 precepts set out in a fixed formula: "If a man committed x (delict), then such-and-such shall be done to him (penalty)." The Epilogue, which, like the Prologue, is written in a high literary style, offers a number of parallels to the imprecative division of the Entitlement naru inscriptions. The Epilogue (columns xlvii-Ii; this and subsequent citations follow the edition of Roth 1995: 133-40) begins with a summary of how and why the gods appointed ijammurapi king in order to maintain justice in the land. It continues in the first person, in which voice ijammurapi relates that he inscribed his decisions upon his naru and affirmed them "in the presence of his image, king of justice."
The phrase ina mabar $almfya sar mfsarim "before my image, king of justice," occurs twice. The first passage reads:
awatfya suquratim ina nareya as!ur-ma ina mabar tjalmiya sar mlsarim ukfn
I wrote my precious words on my monument (naru) and affirmed (them) in the presence of my image, the just king ("king of justice"). (xlvii 74-78)
It is usually assumed that the image (,~almu) was a separate statue of the king, bearing the name or title, sal' mfsarim "King of Justice," and standing in the sanctuary; see, for example, the translation of Roth 1995: xlvii 59, xlviii3-19, or Sasson 1995: 907-8. The text, however, does not require this interpretation. In



260 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NAROS
Fig. 14. Law Stele ofljammurapi, photograph of the relief.



CHAPTER 7: ENTITLEMENT NARUS IN MESOPOTAMIAN CULTURE 261
fact, in light of the Babylonian Entitlement narus, in which sculpted relief images are referred to with the word ,~almu 'image' (see Chapter Four, above, Textual references to relief scenes, pp. 133-42), the expression "before my image" could well refer to the representation of the king carved in relief in the upper portion of the Stele (fig. 14). Furthermore, the phrase Jar mfJarim literally, "king of justice," can be read simply as the epithet "just king," as it is used in a subsequent passage to refer to a future king, rather than as august title for a putative independent royal statue in the round. The epithet "just king" would certainly be an entirely appropriate in the context of a ruler who had inscribed a monumental stele with hundreds of his legal decisions. This understanding of ,~almfya Jar mf§arim applies as well to the second passage:
awflum bablum Ja awatam iraHu ana mabar ~almiya Jar mL~arim lillik-ma nari ,~a!ram liJtassf-ma awatfya Juquratim liJme-ma nari awatam likallimJu dznJu llmur libbaJu linappiJ-ma
Let a wronged man who has a lawsuit come before my image, the just king, and have my inscribed naru read out loud; let him hear my precious words, let my naru reveal to him the matter. Let him see hi s case; let (it) soothe his heart, and... (xlviii 3-19)
This same interpretation, taking the phrase ,~almfya Jar mf§arim "my image, the just king," to refer to the relief sculpture of the Stele and not to a separate statue, is followed by CAD N/1, s.v. naru A 1: "I wrote my precious words on my stela and placed them under (lit. before) a representation of me as king of justice." Winter (1997: 366-7) similarly argued for such an understanding, drawing attention to the legal dimension of the phrase ina ma!Jar x kunnu "to confirm before witnesses." She proposed reading: "I have inscribed my word (i.e., the laws) upon my stele (and) established/confirmed/certified it by (i.e., through the witnessing presence of) my image (as) 'king of justice' ." The second passage, xlviii 3-19, is followed by a short text in praise of ljammurapi that the "wronged man" introduced in the previous excerpt is instructed to pronounce, setting off a further



262 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
series of blessings for ijammurapi and future kings who will honor the stele. Those kings to come are then enjoined:
ana warkiiit umf ana matf-ma §arrum §a ina miitim ibbaHu awat miJarim §a ina narlya a,v!uru li,v,vur dfn miitim §a adfnu purusse miitim §a aprusu ayy-unakkir u$uriitlya ayy-u,vassik summa awllum su ta,vfmtam iHi-ma miissu sute,vuram ile)i ana awatim sa ina narlya a#uru liqul-ma kibsam rfdam dfn miitim ,va adfnu purusse miitim §a aprusu narum ,vu likallim§u-ma ~almiit qaqqadf§u li,vte,~ir
May any king who will appear in the land in the future, at any time, observe the pronouncements of justice that I inscribed upon my naru. May he not alter the judgments that I rendered and the verdicts that I gave, nor remove my designs. If that man has discernment, and is capable of providing just ways for his land, may he heed the pronouncements I have inscribed upon my naru, may that naru reveal for him the traditions, the proper conduct, the judgments of the land that I rendered, the verdicts of the land that I gave, and may he, too, provide just ways for all humankind in his care. (xlviii 59-87)
Here, without doubt, u,~riitfya "my designs" must refer to the relief at the top of the Stele depicting ijammurapi standing piously in the presence of the god Samas, who extends to the king the so-called "rod and ring." There is no firm consensus as to the identity of the rod and ring, nor to what they may symbolize Nonetheless, their prominence in scenes in which a ruler appears to receive them from a divine agent argues for at least a minimal interpretation that they signify good relations between a king and his god( s), and can be considered symbolic attributes of divinely sanctioned kingship. (The most thorough-going discussion of the image of the rod and ring remains van Buren 1949.) Thus, according to its own inscription, ijammurapi's nara served two purposes: to provide justice to a wronged individual and to enable a future king to render just judgment. The inscription then issues a series of imprecations:
,~umma awflum su ana awatfya ,~a ina narlya a#uru iqul-ma dfnf Iii u,vassik awatfya Iii ustepfl u~'}Uriitfya Iii unakkir awflum ,vu Hma sar mHarim Sama§ bana§u lirrik ni§fsu ina mfsarim lirf summa aflum su ana awatfya sa ina narfya as,uru Iii iqUl-ma erretfya imes-ma erret ill Iii fdur-ma dfn adfnu uptassis awatfya ustepf/ u~uriitfya uttakkir ,~umf ,~a!ram ip,~i!-ma ,~um,~u i,~ta!ar aHum en'etim ,~iniiti

If the aforementioned man (i.e., future king) should listen to my words, which I inscribed upon my nartl, (if) he should not overturn my decision, (if) he should not change my words, (if) he should not damage my design-that man, like me, is a just king. May Samas ex

May the great god Anu, father of the gods, who has proclaimed my reign, deprive him of the sheen of royalty, smash his scepter, and curse his destiny! etc. (xlix 2-52)
This passage offers a striking parallel to the imprecative division of the Babylonian Entitlement naru inscription. Although not as elaborate as most imprecation sections appearing in this study, the ijammurapi passage cited above shares with the Entitlement narus concern for the welfare of the naru, particularly for the survival of its inscription and relief. The passage concludes with a list of office-holders, persons who are not to be exempted from doing wrong to the naru, regardless of how much political authority they may exercise, up to and including the king. Note too, that the expression sar mlsarim, 'king of justice' or 'just king', so prominent in the ijammurapi Epilogue, also occurs in the corpus of Entitlement narus as an epithet of kings who have affirmed a petitioner's claim to an entitlement, e.g., Kadasman-Enlil BBSt 1 (BM 91036 and duplicate BM 135743, edited and discussed above, Chapter Six, Artifact A); Nebuchadnezzar I, the Hinke "kudurru," 22; Merodach-Baladan II BBSt 35, 16; and Samas-suma-ukln AnOr 12, 1. As in the Entitlement naru inscriptions, the list of political offices in the ijammurapi inscription is followed by a series of di



264 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
vine curses invoked against a would-be malefactor. Twelve gods are called upon: Anu, Enlil, Ninlil, Ea, Samas, Sin, Adad, Zababa, IStar, Nergal, Nintu, and Ninkarrak. A few specific curses from the ijammurapi epilogue can be found echoed almost verbatim in the Entitlement naru corpus, but this should be attributed to a common tradition associating certain gods with particular curses rather than to any genetic relationship between the Law Stele of /jammurapi and the Entitlement narus. A more significant parallel is the concern evinced through the ijammurapi Epilogue for the future of the naru and the precepts of justice inscribed thereon. Written in the voice of ijammurapi, the excerpt from the Epilogue (xlviii 3-19), cited above, invites the "wronged man who has a lawsuit" to "come before my image, the just king" and find his case. As noted above, the stele's audience, the "wronged man" is then instructed to pronounce the following short text in praise of ijammurapi, his service to the people of the land, and to Babylon's god, Marduk:
ljammurapf-mi be/um ,~a kfma abim walidim ana ni,~f ibaHu ana awat Marduk betL~u u,~taktit-ma irnitti Marduk elL~ u ik,~ud lihhi Marduk hen~u utih u Jfram {aham ana nifi ana dar ifim u matam u,~te,~er
ijammurapi, lord, who is like a father and begetter to his people, submitted himself to the command of the god Marduk, his lord, and achieved victory for the god Marduk everywhere. He gladdened the heart of the god Marduk, his lord, and he secured the eternal well-being of the people and provided just ways for the land. (xlviii 20-38)
These passages are key for understanding a number of elements bearing on the setting and function of inscribed and sculpted stone monuments in Mesopotamia, including the Babylonian Entitlement narus. Foremost is the indivisible juxtapOSItion of image and text. The intended audience-the "wronged man"-is explicitly called to view the image of ijammurapi and hear the text of the monument read out to him. The passage makes clear the public nature of the monument, and accounts for how the "wronged man" would have had access to the inscription even if he himself was not literate: he was to have had it read to him out loud.



CHAPTER 7: ENTITLEMENT NARUS IN MESOPOTAMIAN CULTURE 265
Finally, the visual viewing and aural hearing of the monument-the performance of the stele to its audience-was inextricably linked to a real-time invocation of ijammurapi, the speaking of his name in a short praise composition, even, and I would argue especially, after his death. ijammurapi, through his inscription, motivates the Stele's audience to perpetuate his mem0ry through a reminder of his deeds, foremost among them the just ways he provided the land, and the continuing benefit of his rule to all peoples of his land, even, and especially after, ijammurapi lived on only in memory. In Mesopotamian belief, one was assured of a good afterlife only if one's descendants performed the proper funerary rituals. These included making offerings of food and drink but relied principally on regular invocation of the name and memory of the deceased. It is significant that the very first word of the praise text to be performed by the "wronged man" is the name "ijammurapi." Concern with having an heir to perform the mortuary rites and to perpetuate one's memory is evident throughout the Entitlement naru corpus. In the imprecative division of a number of inscriptions, the gods are called upon to deprive a would-be transgressor of his progeny and heir specifically in the context of annihilating the perpetuation of his memory:
dNin-urta EN ku-dur-re-e-ti IBILA-,~u na-qa(sic!) A.MES-,~u li-,~e-li
May Ninurta, lord of kudurrus, extirpate his heir, the one who pours his libations! (Marduk-nadin-alJlJe BBSt 8, iv 19-20)
a-a-ir-§i tH-§a-ta si-mat la-Ii-Hi IBILA za-kir ,~u-mi
May he not acquire a wife befitting his desire (?), an heir, one to speak (his) name! (Marduk-sapik-zeri Sumer 36, iv 8-9)
Nin-una EN NlGDUMES ku-dur-ra-Ul /i-is-suh ,~um-§u NUMUN-su
NUNl!Z-,M ~ ,:a-a~:-~~b-§u i-na KA UN.MES li-bal-liq IBILA u [na]-aq A.MES a-a-u-sar-Sl-Su
May Ninurta, lord of kudurrus, uproot his kudurru! May he annihilate his name, his children, his scion, and his progeny from the mouth of the people! May he prevent him from acquiring an heir and one to pour out libations! (NabCi-mukln-apli BBSt 9, 14-19)



266 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
The particular invocation of the god Ninurta in these curses may be attributed to (a) Ninurta' s identification as the patron god of kudurrus 'borders' (see above, Chapter Two, the section Passages containing the word kuduffu), and (b) the homonyms kudurru 'border' and kudurru 'heir' (see above, Chapter Two, the section Modern dictionaries and native terminology). Regardless of the origin of the association, its implications cannot be overlooked. Perpetuation of the entitlement was linked in the minds of the Babylonian audience with the ability of the entitlement beneficiary to pass the entitlement to his heir and consequently with survival of the memory of the original entitlement beneficiary. That beneficiary ensured the perpetuity of the entitlement through erection of the stone naru, and the continued existence of that naru preserved the record of his name, his claim to the entitlement, and in some cases his sculpted visual image. At first glance, it would seem to be the heirs of the beneficiary who stand to benefit from the entitlement and its preservation through the immutable stone naru. But in addition, every future reading and viewing of the naru would also serve to perpetuate the name and memory of the original holder of the entitlement. Furthermore, by guaranteeing the inheritability of the entitlement, the original beneficiary provided his heir with a source of income in tum ensuring the survival of his lineage.
BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS AND ROYAL MONUMENTS
In the introduction to his study of Vr III royal inscriptions, llallo (1962: 1) wrote:
The monumental texts of Mesopotamia comprise that part of cuneiform literature which was intended for permanent preservation and which, for this purpose, was either inscribed on durable materials, or duplicated in great numbers, or provided with blessings and curses on those who would preserve the monuments and curses on those who would destroy them or erase or alter the name inscribed on them.
If degree of artistry and size were the only criteria of monumentality, it might be argued with Borker-KIahn that the Entitlement narus fail to qualify as "monumental." But, first and foremost, the



CHAPTER 7: ENTITLEMENT NARUS IN MESOPOTAMIAN CULTURE 267
artifacts were designated with the term naru by the Babylonians. Although Borker-KHihn found the Entitlement narus wanting for inner and outer characteristics of monumentality, they definitively fulfill Hallo's physical and textual specifications. They were manufactured from stone. They bear divine representations and divine imagery. They were inscribed with prohibitions and curses to ensure divine protection for the events they commemorated. They were placed in temples. A full definition for 'monument' is lacking for Mesopotamian cultural studies and is beyond the scope of this study as well. In the interim, I offer here a preliminary sketch of the basic formal and functional criteria shared by Mesopotamian royal monuments.
-Monuments fall typologically under the Sumero-Akkadian designation (n a ) n a - r (i - a/naru.
-Monuments are made of stone.
-Monuments are inscribed with text.
-Monuments are often sculpted with imagery.
-If both media are present, the text and the Imagery of a monument complement one another.
-The inscription of a monument closes with a series of divine curses invoking the wrath of the gods upon anyone who would harm it, its inscription, and its imagery (if present).
-Monuments were intended to be encountered by the present and future public. Archaeological and textual evidence indicates that they were erected in public spaces associated with temples.
-Royal monuments commemorate achievements emblematic of the role of the king, such as military victory, cultic building projects, providing justice for the land.
-Royal monuments are emblematic of their patrons, and, as such, are taken as trophies by victorious military opponents.
-After the king whose deeds are commemorated by a royal monument has died, the monument serves as his memorial.



268 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
The kinds of events commemorated by the Entitlement narus-the acquisition of entitlement and the preservation of that entitlement-were commemorated at an earlier period as well, by the "ancient kudurrus." The "ancient kudurrus" provide a third millennium precedent for commemoration of acquisition of land with inscriptions on stone that were set up in a temple. Admittedly the gap of approximately 700 years between the last known "ancient kudurru" and the earliest known Entitlement naru makes a genetic relationship between the two groups of artifacts doubtful. But we must consider the possibility that examples of the "ancient kudurrus" were accessible to the innovators of the Entitlement narus-a likelihood bolstered by evidence that one of the "ancient kudurrus" was re-inscribed with a curse during the Neo-Babylonian period before it was re-deposited in a temple (see Gelb, Steinkeller, and Whiting 1991: 161, no. 48). Another third-millennium functional parallel to the Entitlement naru may be found in an inscribed stone monument attributed to the Sargonic king, Rimus. Originally published as BE III 7, this limestone block bears a fragmentary inscription that mentions Rimus and commemorates the establishment of regular offerings to the "table of Samas" (Gelb and Kienast 1990: 72-3 {Rimus 7}). The most recent editors of this text draw a parallel to the Cruc~form Monument, a Neo-Babylonian attempt to create an anachronistic monument commemorating a royal grant to a temple by Rimus' brother and successor, Manistusu. (Gelb and Kienast 1990: 72-3 {Rimus 7}) I would submit that the individuals responsible for commission and execution of Entitlement narus, who, in most cases, were not royal, had to rely on available stone, possibly even old monuments that had fallen into disuse, and that this conceivably accounts for the differences in size and quality between examples of the corpus of Entitlement narus and the corpus of royal monu
ments. 12 On the basis of Mesopotamian criteria for what constitutes a monument, I am not persuaded by Borker-Klahn that the gap of "inner and outer monumentality" separating the two groups is so very great.



CHAPTER 7: ENTITLEMENT NARUS IN MESOPOTAMIAN CULTURE 269
Appropriation of a royal prerogative?
As discussed above in regard to the so-called "ancient kudurrus, the practice of commemorating entitlement with inscriptions on stone placed in temples date back to third-millennium Mesopotamia. The work of Ursula Seidl demonstrates that elements of the iconographic repertoire of the Entitlement narus reach back into the third millennium as well. Yet, with few exceptions, according to Michalowski (1990: 63-4 ):
wntmg on stone was largely a royal prerogative... exceptions only serve to underline the main point. Stone stelae represent royal authority, and it is the combined effect of writing, symbolic imagery, and the very medium itself that work together to express certain concepts.
This circumstance, together with concrete parallels in verbal and visual expression, suggest that in the late second-millennium innovators of the Entitlement narus were looking to the millennial old tradition of Mesopotamian royal monuments. The composition of imprecations and curses to protect royal monuments, their inscriptions, and their imagery was not an innovation of the fJammurapi Law Stele, but rather a long-standing practice characteristic of royal monumental inscriptions. It seems clear that when the first Entitlement narus were sculpted and inscribed in the 14th century, their sculptors and authors looked to existing royal monuments for their models, illustrated, for example, by the stelae reviewed above. By co-opting the form of the royal monumental stele-its material (stone) and the impact 0 f that material, its inscriptional form, the impact of combined of image and text, its placement in the temple-the Babylonian Entitlement naru tapped into the authority engendered by that form and extended it to the event it commemorated: the acquisition of entitlement. Moreover, the authority conveyed by the monumental form ensured perpetuation of the entitlement that was detailed in the Entitlement naru inscription. By adopting the form of the royal naru, the creators of the Entitlement narus also appropriated the authority traditionally conveyed by that form.



270 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
All the ingredients found in the Entitlement narus were at hand in the 14th century; the innovation of the Entitlement narus lies in their unique combination of function and form. This raises then another question: what circumstances enabled and/or stimulated this unprecedented combination of elements? The innovation of the form itself implies an appropriation of royal prerogative-why, in this time and place, do non-royal persons begin commissioning and erecting stone monuments? Does this suggest a diminishing of royal authority and a devolution of political power away from the crown? What light can the creation of the Babylonian Entitlement narus shed on the history of 14th century Babylonia?
HISTORICAL SETTING
As noted by Borker-KHihn, outside of the Entitlement narus, stone monuments are virtually unattested in Babylonia under the Kassite and Post-Kassite dynasties. This means that during the era of the Entitlement narus, with the exception of two rather crudely sculpted and unimposing votive stelae dedicated for the life of Nazi-Maruttas by one of his officials, there is no evidence for the manufacture of royal stone monuments. Yet royal monuments are attested in Babylonia both before the advent of the Entitlement narus and after their apparent discontinuation in the seventh century. This sequence seems unlikely to be coincidental. In her survey of Mesopotamian stone monuments, Borker-Klahn suggested that uniformity among Akkadian (Sargonic) period stelae may reflect the political reality of a strong centralized bureaucracy. Along similar lines, perhaps the dearth of royal monumental stelae in the centuries marked by the Entitlement narus reflects a comparative weakness of central political authority in Babylonia. Such a diminishment may have created the opportunity for nonroyal persons not only to lay claim to permanent, hereditary, entitlements, but to monumentalize their claims using a commemorative form heretofore restricted to the crown.

Babylonia and the Kassites
The most informative history of the Kassites in Babylonia, and to which the following remarks are indebted, is Brinkman's (1976-80b) essay, "Kassiten," published in the Reallexikon der Assyriologie. As cautioned by Brinkman, it is important to distinguish between "History of the Kassites" and "History of Babylonia under the Kassite Dynasty." Kassite names first appear in cuneiform sources in 18th century Babylonia. Their homeland and method of entry into Babylonia remain obscure. During the Old Babylonian era, they appear to be regular participants in Babylonian economic activities, yet to occupy a social status somewhat apart. According to Brinkman (1976-80b: 466):
Most references to K( assites) in and around Babylonia proper are to groups or individuals living in encampments or tribal settlements in the Sippar area... K( assites) served as agricultural laborers, drew pravisions, and sold bitumen; their inclusion in some of the larger ration rosters shows that they served as part of the organized labor force who may on occasion have had military functions. Individual K( as sites ) engaged in such typical Babylonian activities as renting a field or receiving silver to purchase barley. But in general K(assites) appear in the texts designated specifically as a group apart and, while serving economic and other function within Babylonian society, not integrated into its structure.
The means by which a Kassite came to claim the Babylonian throne is unknown. The tradition preserved by Kinglist A suggests that a Kassite Dynasty was already established when the First Dynasty of Babylon (i.e., the dynasty of which ijammurapi was sixth king) collapsed circa 1595, and it was the tenth ruler of this Kassite Dynasty, Buma-Burias, who first laid claim to Kassite rule over Babylonia. According to Old Babylonian texts, Kassites seem to have been organized into clans named after eponymous ancestors, called "houses" in Babylonian, i.e., Bft PN, "House of PN." Even after the Dynasty began to rule Babylonia, individuals continued to be identified according to their clan affiliation, i.e., PN mar Bft PN2 "PN, son of the House of PN2." Some provinces in Babylonia, in fact, came to be called after such Kassite clan names. Yet the role of Kassites in Babylonia during the rule of the



272 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
Kassite Dynasty is difficult to assess: despite the tenure of a Kassite ruling family, "there is no obvious trace of either a Kassite caste of officials, or even of a disproportionately large Kassite population within Babylonia" (Brinkman 1976-80b: 467). In any event, the Kassite Dynasty ruled Babylonia for some four and one-half centuries-longer than any other dynasty attested in Mesopotamian civilization. The political and social history of Babylonia under the rule of the Kassite Dynasty remains obscure, due, in part, to the current situation of written sources bearing on the period. Although tablets have been recovered from three urban centers, Nippur, Vr, and Babylon, as well as the second royal capital at DUr-Kurigalzu, their usefulness for historical study is limited. Of the some 12,000 tablets excavated from Nippur, just a fraction have been published (Brinkman 1971b: 395).13 Only 75 tablets have been recovered from Vr, and most of these belong to the private archive of a single family (see Gurney 1974 and Gurney 1983). A mere handful of tablets from DUr-Kurigalzu have been published (see Gurney 1949), and none from Babylon. Thus, in terms of written documentation, only a single city is well represented and those records remain largely unpublished; information from a second city is limited to the economic activity of a single family; and only a few texts from the two royal capitals are available for study. As Brinkman (1976-80) and Sommerfeld (1995) both have emphasized in recent overviews of Babylonia under the Kassite Dynasty, conclusions must remain provisional and are bound to be altered by the future publication of primary material. There is no evidence for a written Kassite language. In Babylonian written sources, data is limited to personal names, a small number of words, chiefly relating to horses (Brinkman 1976-80: 472-73, and see Balkan 1954).14 The names of 20 presumably Kassite gods can be gleaned from personal names, but there is no evidence that temples or shrines were built to them in Babylonia or for their assuming any significant role in Babylonian religion (Sommerfeld 1995: 929). Suqamuna and Sumaliyya, two gods who seem to be gods of the dynasty, were accorded shrines in already established temples, and their names appear in a few of the Entitlement naru inscriptions. Along with an



CHAPTER 7: ENTITLEMENT NAROS IN MESOPOTAMIAN CULTURE 273
emblem for the Kassite god ijarbe, theirs are the only symbols identified by Seidl (1989) as post-third millennium additions to the Mesopotamian iconographic repertoire. Attempts to link the Kassites with Indo-European religious traditions have been dismissed (Brinkman 1976-80: 472). Current knowledge about the Kassites is clearly inadequate to enable us to attribute developments in Babylonian history and culture to foreign ideas that the Kassites might have introduced. What we can say about the political history of Babylonia under the Kassite dynasty is the following: after the fall of the First Dynasty of Babylon, the age of city-states was over. From time immemorial, southern Mesopotamia was organized in a patchwork of independent city-states. Occasionally one would assert hegemony over the others, but not for long, and eventually the pattern of city-states, each vying for resources and trade routes, would re-emerge. Strong kings who had established centralized control over these states during the third and first half of the second millennium, such as Sargon, Naram-Sin, Sulgi, and ijammurapi, managed to conquer and control the city-states for limited periods of time only. These were charismatic rulers with strong military support, but their attempts to impose a single regime over the land usually came to an end with the close of their reigns. Within a generation-or even less-of the deaths of these kings, the political structure of southern Mesopotamia had reverted to its ancient pattern. But after the fall of the First Dynasty of Babylon, marked by the Hittite raid of 1595, the scheme of city-states did not re-assert itself, and the ancient pattern of city-states striving for regional control would not appear in Mesopotamia again (see Sommerfeld 1995: 918). Beginning with the Kassite Dynasty, there is a kingdom of Babylonia with its capital at Babylon, and it endured, albeit with interruptions, until native Mesopotamian rule was ended by Cyrus in 538. The Kassite Dynasty held the Babylonian throne from about 1595 to about 1150. During the 14th century, Babylonia became a major player on the international scene, and her fortunes are documented in the Amarna letters as one of four great countries alongside Egypt, ijatti, and Mitanni. As such, Babylonia was



274 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
party to the rich trade network maintained by these kingdoms, kingdoms moreover to which the Kassite royal family linked itself through diplomacy and marriage. During this period, "Babylonia played a key role in the wide-ranging contacts of the political, intellectual, and mercantile life of south-western Asia" (Brinkman 1976-80: 466). At one point, Egypt sent so much gold that for more than a century-and the only time in its history-mercantile Babylonia adopted a gold rather than silver standard (Brinkman 1976-80: 467 and Sommerfeld 1995: 920). Bablyonia's luxury contributions to Egypt in turn included notably lapis lazuli and horses and chariots for Pharaoh's court. The economic and symbolic value to the kings of gifts exchanged and of marriages arranged should not be underestimated (Moran 1992 {1987}: xxiv-xxv). The corpus of Amarna letters is witness to another global phenomenon taking place during the reign of the Kassite Dynasty: the dissemination of Babylonian written culture throughout the ancient Near East. The letters exchanged among the four "great kings" were written in Babylonian cuneiform, and their language is Babylonian. The same Babylonian writing system and language was also adapted for the letters that make up the rest of the archive-missives and archival copies of such that were sent between the Pharaoh and his Syro-Palestinian vassals. Fragments of Babylonian literary texts dating from the 16th-14th centuries are found throughout the Near East, and it is presumed that education in cuneiform and Akkadian was accomplished by means of scribal schools set up across the region. Along with literary traditions, there is evidence for the spread of Babylonian science, especially divinatory methods and medicine. Physicians were requested at neighboring courts, indicating that Babylonian medicine was held internationally in high regard (Sommerfeld 1995: 920; and see, e.g., KBo I 10, r. 34-48 on Babylonian physicians and magical experts at the Hittite court). Also documented in the Amarna letters was the downfall of the kingdom of Mitanni, as well as the Babylonia's objection to the pretensions of the Assyrian state that stepped in to fill the political vacuum left by Mitanni' s collapse. Although a Kassite king protested that Assyria was a Babylonian vassal (EA 9), the upstart



CHAPTER 7: ENTITLEMENT NAROS IN MESOPOTAMIAN CULTURE 275
Assyrian kingdom grew in power quickly and came to interfere in Babylonian dynastic succession during the 13th century. Though the Kassite dynasty was able to re-claim the throne, it appears to have lost its strength, and by 1157 the Kassite kings were replaced in Babylonia by the dynasty we call Isin II. On the domestic stage, the Kassite rulers engaged in the traditional pious public works projects of the Mesopotamian monarch-building, restoring and furnishing temples, which they commemorated in traditional Babylonian style with inscriptions in Sumerian and Akkadian. It seems to have been a time of flourishing in the literary arts, both in terms of new composition and the copying, and perhaps canonization, of traditional texts. This is the time when the Standard Babylonian Epic of Gilgames is thought to have been composed, as well as poetic texts such as ludlul bel nemeqi, Advice to a Prince, and others familiarly known under the heading of Babylonian Wisdom Literature (see Lambert 1960 for editions of these compositions). This is also the time when scribes first connect themselves to great scribal families. And, as mentioned above, the sciences, too, enjoyed a period of high activity and presumably royal patronage. There is no evidence that the Kassite kings attempted to impose any specifically Kassite religious or other "Kassite" cultural elements upon Babylonia. A single comment in a king list written after the fall of the dynasty may possibly be taken as an expression of anti-Kassite sentiment, but otherwise there is no evidence for any Babylonian-Kassite ethnic or other antipathy (Brinkman 1980: 470). On the contrary, the Kassite kings of Babylonia seem to have respected and furthered the Babylonian traditions and were considered themselves to be authentic monarchs 0 f Babylonia. By all available accounts, external and internal, Babylonia under the Kassite dynasty was, for the most part, politically stable and economically prosperous. The king ruled from the old capital Babylon and the newly built Dur-Kurigalzu, and the provincial system of outlying areas was administered by governors who reported directly to him. The palace engaged in international trade and diplomacy, traditional arts and sciences thrived, and Babylonian culture spread throughout the ancient Near East.



276 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
One innovation dating to the period of the Kassite kings is, of course, the Entitlement nara. Under the label kudurru 'boundary stone', this artifact type was long regarded as a Kassite cultural import brought into Babylonia and used to mark the boundaries of royal land grants. Based on these assumptions, scholars concluded that these royal land grants constituted evidence for a feudal system introduced by the Kassites into Babylonia as well (see notably Balkan 1943 (1986), followed, for example, by von Soden 1994 (1985): 79-80). The idea that Babylonia under the Kassite Dynasty was organized according to a feudal system has been recently evaluated and rejected by Walter Sommerfeld (1995). In brief, Sommerfeld submits that basic elements of feudalism are evident in Kassite Babylonia: the king did make land grants to individuals, in some cases explicitly as reward for service, providing them with income and, presumably, ensuring himself of their future loyal service. But by no means does this qualify the society as a whole as having been organized as a feudal system. For this, as argued by Sommerfeld (1995: 923), two conditions must be met: the "ruler must control the land totally or almost totally and land must be granted to the elite or to officeholders not under exceptional circumstances, but systematically." The amount of land granted according to the Entitlement naras hardly adds up to evidence that "the country was either wholly or partly parceled out to a ruling stratum" (Sommerfeld 1995: 923). On the contrary, the Entitlement naras provide good evidence that the king did not have the power to distribute land at will. For example, Meli-Sipak MDP X 87, discussed above in this chapter and in Chapter Two, commemorates a grant to the king's daughter, ijunnubat-Nanayya. According to the text, land that had not been "prepared for cultivation, in which no canals were dug" was developed for cultivation by the king before he gave it to his daughter. That account of the work performed on the land before it was granted is included in the inscription indicates that it was his improvement of the uncultivable land that enabled King Meli-Sipak to bestow it upon his daughter. Along these lines, the king is later described as having purchased orchard land that he also gave to this same princess. A similar history for the develop



CHAPTER 7: ENTITLEMENT NAROS IN MESOPOTAMIAN CULTURE 277
ment of granted land is related by the Nebuchadnezzar Hinke kudurru. And, according to other inscriptions that relate the origin of granted land-which, admittedly, are not many-a king once granted land of an individual who had committed a "misdeed" (Marduk-sapik-zeri ZA 65 8-13) and another bestowed land of an individual who had died intestate (MeliSipak BBSt 3). Viewed, then, from a broader socio-historical perspective, the Entitlement naras provide evidence about royal land grants that is incompatible with a feudal system.
Other contemporary expressions of limitations on royal power
In addition to this evidence, features of the imprecative division of the Entitlement nara inscriptions imply restrictions on the power of the king. Many of the texts prohibit officials of the realm from appropriating or otherwise encroaching upon the land and exemptions commemorated by the Entitlement nara, and the list of officials regularly includes the king. Thus, Entitlement naras preserve unambiguous expressions of limitations on royal authority. Meli-Sipak MDP II 99, for example, commemorates the granting from the king to his son and eventual successor, Merodach-baladan I, of large amount of land, including settlements. The grant includes provisions that the residents of the granted territory were to be exempted from work and tax obligations. The text also expresses that the king was obliged to respect the laws of the land, and enumerates ways in which the king was not to overstep the rights of its residents. One of the passages was cited above in Chapter Two; for convenience the translation is repeated here:
Royal service for sluice, weir, seepage, small bank repair, and reed cutting of the Royal Canal; bank maintenance of the settlement of BIt-Sikkamudu and the settlement of Sa-damiq-Adad, together with those levied by the work-gang leader of the settlements of the land of IStar of Akkad, its settlement; (so that a levy) is not exacted...

not to take away on behalf of the king, nor on behalf of the §akin mati, nor on behalf of any such notable of the province of BIt-Piri '-Amurru, wood or hay or straw or grain or any such deliverable commodity, his wagon, his team, his ass or his man... animals of the king or §akin mati, who may be situated in the pfbiltu of BIt-Piri '-Amurru, are not to be led into its basin to graze upon its vegetation; not to look after roads and bridges/dams, either for the king or for the ,~akin mati, who may be situated in BH-Piri )-Amurru; moreover, any new work obligation which, in future days, a king or ,~akin milti, who may be situated in the pfbiltu of BH-Piri '-Amurru, would effect through a lawsuit, or a work obligation which is fallen into disuse from of old, but (now) emerges anew; not to effect that aforementioned work obligation, the prohibition against taking away its land, the exempting of its settlement( s), its basin, and whatever else he (the king) gave him, he (the king) established, and in the presence of Samas, Marduk, AnunItu, and the great gods of heaven and earth, he inscribed on a (stone) nara. (Meli-Sipak MDP II 99: iii 5-52)



CHAPTER 7: ENTITLEMENT NAROS IN MESOPOTAMIAN CULTURE 279
The tone of these passages is echoed in a literary composition possibly dated to this period, mentioned above and known as Advice to a Prince (or Fiirstenspiegel) and edited by Lambert (1960; see p. III for bibliography of original publications). The following citations follow Lambert's edition. Advice to a Prince begins:
If a king does not heed justice, his people will be thrown into chaos, his land will be devastated.
The text continues with a series of similar protasis-apodosis, or ifthen clauses. Most of the enumerated misdeeds involve the proper administration of justice: the king is cautioned to heed the justice of his own land (line 2) and to render just decisions to his own citizens (line 9). The text continues:
(If he) mobilized Sippar, Nippur, and Babylon to impose corvee upon (them) together with the work gangs, (If he) imposes upon them ilku-Iabor at the call of the herald... (lines 23-5)
(If he) give fodder of the citizens of Sippar, Nippur, and Babylon to his own choice steeds... (lines 31-2)
(If he) dissolves their contracts and alters their (stone) narus ... (line 51)
Lambert (1960: 110) described the 59-line Advice to a Prince as a "salutory corrective" to the impression "that ancient Mesopotamian kings were typical oriental despots, following their own whims, and unchallenged within their domains," in contrast to the kings of ijatti and Israel/Judah, whose actions were circumscribed either by law or by censure. While exemptions from corvee and other obligations recorded in the Meli-Sipak Entitlement naru cited above are much more detailed than those enumerated in Advice to a Prince-the Meli-Sipak Entitlement naru text is also much longer-the sense that the rights of the citizens are not to be abrogated by the king is very much the same. In addition to censuring a king who calls his citizens up for royal corvee duty,



280 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
the text also cautions the king against glvmg the fodder of his citizens to his own horses (lines 31-2), appropriating their livestock (lines 38-41), and heeding unjust counsel of his advisors to the detriment of his citizens (lines 45-6). Like Advice to a Prince, the passage cited above from MeliSipak MDP II 99 is an extraordinary statement about the rights of the citizenry and limitations on the powers of the king. In addition to asserting the obligation of the king to honor established exemptions, Meli-Sipak MDP II 99 illustrates the behavior of the righteous king as one who does not violate the privileges or exemptions (zakutu) held by his citizens:
Whensoever in distant time, in far-off days (in regard to) one whom the great gods summon and elevate to the shepherdship of the landJust as I did not take away land which the king, my predecessor, granted to his progeny; (just as) I did not cause to enter into ilku-service
(the inhabitants of the settlements) whom he exempted, and (just as) I did not alter and did not change anything which he inscribed upon his naru and left behind; (just as) I did not act at the word of powerful men, my counselors, the sakanakkus of the pfbiitus,
or (any )one who would urge a lawsuit; (just as) I did not take away the land which they granted to their progeny; (just as) I did not cause to enter into ilku-service (the inhabitants of the settlements) whom they exempted; (just as) I, myself did not despise or transgress the text which they inscribed and left behind for me(so) shall he (i.e., the future king) commit no sin against me! (Meli-Sipak MDP II 99: iii 55-iv 29)



CHAPTER 7: ENTITLEMENT NARUS IN MESOPOTAMIAN CULTURE 281
Taken all together, these texts hardly add up to a picture whereby the king had absolute or almost absolute control over the landed resources of the country. Rather than speaking for a feudal system, evidence from the Entitlement narus speaks against the existence of a feudal system in Babylonia under the Kassite Dynasty.
The Babylonian Entitlement narus as witness to 2nd millennium social change
There are two ways in which the new interpretation of the Babylonian Entitlement narus proposed by this study may contribute to the current understanding of the history of Kassite and post-Kassite Babylonia. First, non-royal persons found it both possible and desirable to commemorate acquisition of entitlement and to ensure that their heirs would have permanent claim to the entitlement. Second, contemporary circumstances enabled those persons to appropriate the form of the (stone) naru, otherwise a royal prerogative, to commemorate and perpetuate their claims to entitlements. Rather than viewing these innovations as the result of foreign, i.e., Kassite influence, the reality and impact of which is belied by evidence reviewed above, these innovations can be seen instead as signs of broader social changes taking place in Babylonia and throughout the ancient Near East. In a study on the role of landed property in the history of social change in the ancient Near East, Mario Liverani posited a model in which developments in the two primary sectors of economic production, the "palace sector" and the "family sector" stimulate one another's evolution. Liverani outlined four diachronic stages whereby practices in the family sector are influenced by changing practices in the palace sector and vice versa. As is true of any model of social transformation, Liverani acknowledged that the stages and chronology proposed are simplified for the purposes of the model. The model begins with a description of land tenure and social structure around 2500. At that time, palace property is managed by the palace, and its members are rewarded by rations. Family property is the undivided property of the household its members receive food.



282 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
Under the influence of practice in the family sector, Liverani (1984: 38) argues that the palace began to reward its members "through allotment of a field from which the grantee will take his food directly." The palace maintained ownership of the land, and the new system simplified greatly redistribution of food to the members of its sectors. This process was well established by the middle of the 3rd millennium. But influence also ran from the palace sector to the family sector. Under the influence of the palace sector, in which adult male heads of household receive land for their family's maintenance, land in the family sector began to be divided up in the process of inheritance. This process took place throughout and beyond the 2nd millennium. In the next phases, the organization of the palace was influenced by the principles of inheritance at work in the family sector. In the palace sector, land allocation had been the reward for service rendered, and, consequently, "reward is cut if the service is interrupted." But meanwhile, in the family sector, every member would receive a portion of land because he (and In some cases she) was born into the family. Over time, proposes Liverani (1984: 39), a variety of social forces result in
the attempt (often successful) by dependents of the great organizations to transmit their functions to their sons. ,. when labour is rewarded by land allotment, the substitution of father by son leads to the consolidation of a given field's possession by the same family of grantees. This in turn leads to an undermining of the palatine property and of the palace's ability to revoke the grant in case the serVIce 1 s finished.
According to Liverani, this second stage reached its height during the first half of the 2nd millennium and continued beyond. In the second half of the 2nd millennium, a further development takes place in regard to exemptions from service. Production units of the family sector, i.e., families, could substitute payments in place of surplus food and forced labor. Analogously, "service of the Palace dependents is sometimes substituted by payment in money" (Liverani 1984: 39). The analogy can be extended even further, with the result that palace land may be granted without expectation of return in service. The



CHAPTER 7: ENTITLEMENT NARUS IN MESOPOTAMIAN CULTURE 283
implications of this development are momentous, and according to Liverani (1984: 39):
(e)xemption from service greatly damages the Palace's position by consolidating the feeling that the allotted lands are the grantee's property, and by changing his status to that of a tax-paying tributary, rather than a dependent rewarded for his work.
Liverani's model is likely based, at least in part, on data from the corpus of Babylonian Entitlement narus, and so to use it to explain their advent and function would be tautological, to say the least. Rather, I introduce his model into discussion of the historical context of the Entitlement narus for three reasons: ( 1) the model provides a legitimate alternative to the unsatisfactory feudal model imposed or alluded to in discussions of the socio-political history of so-called "Kassite Babylonia," i.e., Babylonia under the Kassite Dynasty; (2) it divests us of the need to attribute apparently anomalous historical and social developments of Kassite Babylonia to the introduction of foreign elements by the kings of the Kassite dynasty; (3) it raises the issue of a weakening of the palace's position vis-a-vis the granting of lands and exemptions, a development that correlates positively with the hypothesis proposed by this study, that the innovation of the Babylonian Entitlement narus represent an appropriation of a royal prerogative by non-royal persons. Sommerfeld's persuasive discussion should lay to rest lingering notions that Babylonia under the Kassite dynasty was organized according to a feudal system. In matters of culture, Babylonia under the Kassite Dynasty was distinguished by continuity of tradition rather than by change-why should we expect the impact of the Kassite Dynasty on the socio-political situation to be so very different? As far as socio-political history is concerned, a definitive word will have to wait for the publication of more primary sources. But with reference to Liverani's model, the current picture can be attributed to a long-term developmental process fueled by changing practices in land tenure and resulting



284 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
societal transformations taking place not only Babylonia but throughout the Near East.
The innovation of the Babylonian Entitlement nan}s in the mid2nd millennium
And what of the Entitlement narus themselves? Ursula Seidl demonstrated that the iconography of the Entitlement naras, which, at first glance appears so strange, is rooted firmly in the iconographic traditions of Mesopotamia reaching back to the 3rd millennium. As argued in this study, other features of the Entitlement naras-their material, their inscriptions, their subject matter, their provenance, and most importantly their typological classification according to Babylonian conception-are of comparable antique indigenous Mesopotamian pedigree. In the vacuum of knowledge about Kassite cultural tradition, it cannot be proven that their form and function was not a foreign import. But there is certainly quite a lot about their form and function that is simply Babylonian, and, in the wider perspective of the preservation and furthering of traditional Babylonian culture under the kings of the Kassite dynasty, the introduction of an entirely foreign artifact genre signaling the introduction of a foreign socio-political 'feudal' system would be anomalous. The innovation of the Entitlement nara in 14th century Babylonia lies in the combining of traditional Mesopotamian iconographic, legal, and monumental elements, and was stimulated or enabled by specific socio-political historical circumstances of the time.
'The field of Mesopotamian Legal Studies is vast; for a recent summary, see Greengus 1995 and references, and see the forthcoming History of Near Eastern Law, R. Westbrook, ed., (Brill). The latter will include an essay by the author on law according to Middle Babylonian sources. 2For a recent examination of the function, as well as the consecration, installment and maintenance procedures of royal votive statues, see Winter 1992: 23-36. The ideas presented here about cultic performance through visual image are indebted to Winter's study. 3Although there are instances of the Akkadian equivalent for TUD (w)aladu 'to give birth to' used in reference to the creation of a divine statue (for examples see CAD A/I, s.v. aladu 1 d), the distinction may not have been maintained as strictly as it apparently was in Sumerian. ill Akkadian texts, the manufacture of divine images, presumably in the form

The subject deserves further study. 4Borker-Klahn 1982: 50: " ... dass also letzlich auch die altbabylonische Kunst nur eine Entwicklungsstufe der sumerisch-akkadischen Gesamtleistung darstellt." 5Borker-Klahn 1982: 52: "Es konnte bezeichnend sein, dass aus der mittelbabylonischer Zeit neben vielen KuduITU ausser diesen beiden keine weitere Stelen bekannt sind; diese Gattung schien vollig in den Hintergrund geddingt." 6Borker-Klahn 1982: 52: "Wahrend also die Haupttypen, entweder aus nattirlichen Steinformen oder durch Anlehnung an Tontafeln erklart werden konnen, ist bei Platten und Pfeilern, bis zu einem gewissen Grade auch bei Quadern, Ubereinstimmung mit herkommlichen Stelen nicht zu verkennen, die jedoch keine Orientierung zu bedeuten braucht." 7Additionally, Borker-Klahn was not persuaded by Seidl's conclusion that an iconographic "Kanonisierung" in the repertoire and deployment of the symbols had taken place during the reign of Meli-Sipak. Her objection is based on the ground that statistics are biased toward the monuments from the reigns of Meli-Sipak and Merodach-baladan. These statistics may well be biased because of the number of Entitlement narus recovered from Susa attributed to these reigns. That group of monuments came to Susa as a result of the raids of Sutruk-Nabbunte ca. 1156, and so could not possibly include any monuments dating from after the reign of Enlil-nadin-apli. Thus, the raids of Sutruk-Nabbunte, the preservation of the monuments at Susa, and the discovery of the Susa corpus may be responsible for the fact that a.,great number entitlement narus dating to the relatively long reigns of Meli-Sipak (1168-1172) and Merodach- baladan I (1171-1159) are extant. 8Borker-Klahn 1982: 51: "Was KuduITU grundsatzlich von Stelen unterscheidet, ist der absolut Mangel an innerer und ausserer Monumentalitat.

In the course of her study, Winter demonstrates positive and deliberate correlations between the image and text found on seals belonging to Ur III officials; ideas presented here about the inscription and relief of Meli-Sipak MDP X 87 are indebted to her methodology. l2RecaU that a few of the extant Entitlement naru inscriptions are clearly incised over older texts; see p. 27, and n. 3, and p. 126, and n. 7, above. It would be worthwhile to investigate to what extent other monuments were recycled in this fashion. 13Brinkman 1976b is a superb review of the sources pertaining to Babylonia under the Kassite Dynasty, and provides extensive bibliography, an informative introduction, and an appendix of a number of annotated text editions. l4The most comprehensive study of the Kassite language remains Balkan 1954.



Conclusion
The preceding remarks are not intended to be the final word on the Babylonian Entitlement narus (kudurrus). Sculpted and inscribed stone artifacts spanning a period of almost 700 years and originating in multiple ancient Babylonian cities, their present chronological and geographical representation is insufficient to merit statistically based conclusions. Instead, this investigation aimed to organize and present the evidence in order to (a) facilitate meaningful comparison of the inscriptions and imagery 0 f the objects, both within and without the corpus, and (b) propose fresh ideas about their role and significance of these artifacts in ancient Mesopotamian civilization. In modern scholarly understanding, the artifacts investigated in this study are known as kudurrus, an Akkadian word conventionally translated 'boundary stone'. They have been thought to have commemorated feudal land grants given by the king, and to have stood in the fields to physically mark the borders of the granted land. The earliest examples are dated to the 14th century, a time when Babylonia was ruled by what is known as the Kassite Dynasty. The Kassites, an ethnic group recognized from cuneiform sources to have been present in Babylonia since the 1700s, gave rise sometime in the 1600s to a dynasty that came to rule Babylonia for some four centuries. Because the objects made their debut in Babylonia under the Kassite Dynasty, much modern scholarship has assumed them to be a foriegn artifact type that, along with a feudal system based on royal land grants, was imported into Babylonia by the Kassites. For this reason, the artifacts have also been known as the 'Kassite kudurrus'.

288 THE BABYLONIAN ENTITLEMENT NARUS
In contrast to common modern perception, however, the objects were not known to the ancient Babylonians as 'kudurru', 'boundary', or, by extension, 'area enclosed by a boundary', or 'boundary marker'. Rather, they were known as nara, a word usually translated 'stele', but more fundamentally signifying '(stone) monument'. A number of factors support re-assessing the form and function of the so-called "kudurrus" and assigning them to the Mesopotamian typology of 'monument' rather than 'boundary marker'. Re-examination of archaeological and textual evidence pertaining to the placement of the artifacts points to an original setting of the temple rather than fields; this includes information culled from formal archaeological excavation as well as references in the inscriptions to their installation in the presence of the gods. Systematic analysis of the inscriptions also points to a function other than marking the boundaries of granted lands. The texts commemorate a variety of subjects, the majority of which are royal land grants, but also the granting of tax and labor exemptions, adjudication of lawsuits, affirmation of land title, royal and non-royal grants of sinecure, non-royal land grants, and non-royal land purchases. Each of these subjects represents a perpetual source of income to the recipient. This study has invoked the concept of entitlement for these different subjects, and has coined the term "B abylonian Entitlement nara" for the artifacts. Despite the multiplicity of subjects, the inscription of each artifact shares the same over-riding structure. The texts can be divided into two main parts, named by this study the operative and imprecative division. The operative division spells out the terms of the entitlement as well as any legal or historical circumstances that lend legitimacy to its acquisition, while the imprecative division, through a series of warnings and divine curses, seeks to ensure the inviolability of the entitlement and the ability of the recipient to hold the entitlement permanently, that is, to pass it down at his death to his heirs for all time. The inscriptions and the sculptures of the Entitlement naras were composed with an eye to one another, as numerous implicit

and explicit correlations between text and image throughout the corpus can attest. Divine symbols carved upon the narus are invoked in parallel to divine names inscribed in the curses that close each inscription: the visual and verbal media each served to reinforce the intended inviolabilty of the entitlement detailed in the text. Scenes that are carved on some members of the corpus also function to legitimate and reinforce the information set out in the inscription. By virtue of their manifacture in stone, the verbal and visual representations of individuals in receipt of entitlements also serve to memorialize those parties and their role in the original entitlment transaction. These features of the Entitlement narus, along with their indigenous designation 'naru' and their apparent placement in temples, align the artifacts more closely with the genre of Mesopotamian royal monuments than with the genre of legal texts, the body of material with which the artifacts under investigation have heretofore been compared. Individual features of the inscriptions and the relief imagery have their roots in native Mesopotamian monumental tradition, and recourse to an explanation of "foriegn importation" is no longer satisfactory to explain the genesis of the artifact type. Moreover, evidence from the inscriptions of the Entitlement narus belies reconstruction of a "feudal system" at this time. This same evidence, as well as information from other sources, undermines the notion of a domination of foreign Kassite influence in Babylonia during the time of the Kassite Dynasty. As an alternative, this study has proposed that socio-political developments underway in Babylonia and throughout the ancient Near East enabled and perhaps even stimulated appropriation by non-royal persons of the royal monumental form. In this way, individuals had an opportunity to co-opt the authority invested in otherwise "royal" form of the inscribed and sculpted stone naru, and were able to extend that authority to their own acquisition and maintenance of income-producing entitlements.

BIBLIOGRAPHIC CROSS·REFERENCES FOR ARTIFACTS WITH DATABLE INSCRIPTIONS
The present study designates artifacts according to the reign to which the text can be dated plus the principal text publication(s). A "nickname" in common use, such as the Caillou Michaux or the Hinke "kudurru," are also included. Major publications as well as museum numbers are provided in the second column. The third column lists corresponding designations as found in Seidl 1989; the fourth provides those found in Brinkman 1976b (Materials and Studies for a Kassite History 1 lMSKH), covering the reigns of Kurigalzu I to Enlil-nadin-abJJe, i.e., ca. late 15th c-1155) and Brinkman 1968b (A Political History of Post-Kassite Babylonia {PHPKB}, covering the reigns of IttiMarduk-balatu to Nabfi-suma-iskun, i.e., ca. 1139-748). The designations assigned in Steinmetzer 1922 are given in the fifth column. For annotated publication information for each artifact, see the corresponding entries in the catalogues of Brinkman 1968b, Brinkman 1976b, and Seidl 1989. Artifacts are listed in chronological order. Dates, as elsewhere in this study, are after Brinkman 1977a, and the ordering of the first two entries follows Brinkman and Dalley 1988, n. 2. An asterisk, "*,, indicates that dating is not certain, "n.i." indicates that artifact is not included in that study, "N" followed by a page number indicates where the artifact is included in Seidl's 1989 "Nachtrage."

ARTIFACTS RECOVERED THROUGH CONTROLLED
EXCAVATION
Provenience information is culled primarily from Seidl 1989 and Reade 1987, with reference also to Hinke 1907 and Margueron 1972. This study designates artifacts by the name of the king to whose reign the inscription can be dated and the primary publication. Seidl's descriptive catalogue includes data about provenience when known, and her sigla are provided here for easy reference. "N" follwed by a page number indicates where the artifact can be found in Seidl's Nachtrage; "n.i." signifies that the artifact was not included. Information about the architectural feature from which the artifact was recovered is more precise for some finds than for others. The chart does not include the 12 datable and 47 undatable artifacts and fragments recovered through excavations at Susa, although these presumably were originally located in Babylonian temples and associated spaces (see discussion above, in Chapter Two: Ancient Setting, pp. 56-9).

One inscription records so many different types of events, with and without the participation of the king, that it seems prudent to consider it in a category by itself. The text records two royal adjudications, one non-royal gift of land, one non-royal affirmation of the gift, and a closing event that seems to secure land rights through payment.

King Ninurta-kudurri-u~ur settled a dispute between Arad-Sebetti and Burusa over the killing of a slave. Arad-Sebetti was ordered to give Burusa 7 slaves, but he was unable to pay.

APPENDICES
Arad-Sebetti later gave a field to his daughter when she became the daughter-inlaw of Burusa.
After the death of AradSebetti, his son affirmed the grant to his sister.
Later, when unrelated claims were made against his father, the son of Arad-Sebetti was remanded to pay. He could not, and appealed to Burusa, the father-in-law of his sister. Burusa paid, and the parties were enjoined not to make claims against one another. Moreover, the family (lit. 'house') of the debtor was enjoined not to make any claims.
In the final situation, Burusa paid a price (for a field?) to the son of Arad-Sebetti, and the family of Arad-Sebetti was enjoined from making any claims.

field
payment of debts
payment (for land?)
Because Arad-Sebetti and a woman from his family are pictured together with King Nabfi-nadin-ahhe in the relief of the stele, it seems likely that the family of Arad-Sebetti was responsible for setting up the naru. In that case, it seems that the critical event commemorated by the stele is that Arad-Sebetti and his family were absolved of debts and other claims against them. See above pp. 136-41 and Slanski 2000.
1Although the operative statement of the event is not preserved, the imprecations make reference to "anyone who would say the field is not a/the gift of the king" (ii 12'-13'), indicating that the piece does commemorate a royal grant.






APPENDIX 4
GLOSSARY OF AKKADIAN TERMS
The following list offers brief English approximations for most Akkadian terms appearing in this study. A number of the words and expressions listed below are officials' titles that occur in the imprecation and curse sections of the Entitlement naru inscriptions; for their Engish equivalents I have relied primarily on Brinkman 1968b, especially pp. 296-314. Of these, many are obsolete tenns for governmental offices that no longer existed during the period when the Entitlement narus were commissioned and erected. Unless attributed otherwise, modern meanings given below are drawn from the Akkadisches Handwbrterbuch (AHw) and the Chicago Assyrian Dictionary (CAD).
