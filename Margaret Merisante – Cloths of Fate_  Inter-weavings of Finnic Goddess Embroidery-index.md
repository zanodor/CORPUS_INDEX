Cloths of Fate:
Inter-weavings of Finnic Goddess Embroidery with Ancestry and
Mythology
Paper and visual presentation given at the 2016 conference of the Pacific Northwest American
Academy of Religion/Society of Biblical Literature/American Schools of Oriental Research. May 20, 2016.
Abstract
The nexus of this paper explores links to ancient myths and mythic symbols; sacred Finnic textiles; and personal ancestry. Cloths of Fate: Inter-weavings of Finnic Goddess Embroidery with Ancestry and Mythology extends my on-going mythological research into solar mare goddesses and their corresponding figures—swan maidens—while adding both experiential and ancestral orientations.
Additionally, this paper looks at evidence of solar mare goddesses and swan maidens that may show a merger from Finno-Ugric mythic practices and narratives with Indo-European ones. The richness and longevity of these symbols demonstrate a particularly robust female sphere of ritual, sacrality, and myth. Additionally, Finnic goddess embroideries clothes depicting these figures were used ritually as votaries to goddesses that represented time, fate, light, life, and death.

Introduction
My continuing mythological research into mythic celestial mare goddesses and folkloric swan
maidens deepens in this paper through the additions of experiential and ancestral orientations.
Specifically, this paper connects my ancestry with this particular mythological research through the
mediums of scholarship, genealogy, and the re-creation of a traditional Finnic embroidered cloth
the juhlakäspaikat.
Approaching this material from comparative mythology and feminist perspectives, I offer
three intersections of the personal and intimate with the mythological and universal:
1. My ancestral lineage to Finland with its tradition of creating beautiful symbolic textiles;
2. background on the broader topic of Finnic textiles—especially, Finnic goddess
embroideries; and
3. insights into mythic correspondences to these embroidered symbols.
Previously, I’ve shown that the mythological paths of the solar or celestial mare goddess
intersect and often blend with the migrations of the solar or celestial swan maiden (Merisante
Women, & Aloft). To my delighted surprise, this research unveiled an unmistakable personal
connection; one that literally resides in the threads of my Finno-Ugric heritage. Additionally,
recreating a traditional Finnic red-work goddess embroidery cloth in conjunction with this research
allowed me to offer a tribute to my ancestors, a gift to my descendants, and a testament to the power
of myth.
Finno-Ugric identity and ethnicity:
To understand the primary terrain of this paper, I must first give certain definitions of both
language, peoples, and geography. Uralic languages (a linguistic grouping that is non-Indo-European)
have three branches—Finnic, Ugric, and Samoyedic. Among several others, the subset of Finno
Ugric languages includes Finnish and Hungarian. Finns and Hungarians are identified by both
2



geographic nativity and as native speakers of their respective languages. For the purposes of this
paper, the term Finnic refers to Northern European peoples who speak Finnish languages and their
historical habitat of the greater geographical area around the Baltic and White Seas.
I am a descendent of Finno-Ugric peoples. Over half of my great-grandparents come from
either Hungary or Finland. Genealogical research shows my two Hungarian great-grand-parents
living in southern Hungary prior to emigration. Records pertaining to my three Finnish great
grandparents reveal one branch rooted in the western coast of Finland; the other stemming from
Finland’s southern regions. During the mid-to-late 1800’s, each of these great grandparents
emigrated to the United States.
Linguistically and often, culturally, Uralic peoples retained their ethnic traditions longer than
many Indo-European cultures. Finnish folklore scholar Laura Stark explains that prior to the 1860’s,
Finland and Finns were distinctly “pre-modern.” This designation of “pre-modern” follows the
widely prevailing view on Finland by Finnish sociologists and historians; they find that “‘modern
Finland’ emerged only” after the 1860’s and up to the 1950’s when industrialization and nation
building became pronounced (Gender 154). Stark, remarking on the robustness, tenacity, and
longevity of ancient ways in Finland, says, that “verbal and ritual traditions expressing ancient
historical layers of cultural thought survived in the interior of Finland until the twentieth
century” (Gender 153).
Within in this paper, I celebrate the textile heritage of my Finnish ancestry through the
medium of goddess embroideries. Goddess embroideries refer to embroideries that feature stylized,
geometric, and figurative designs which indicate a goddess as the subject of the embroidery.
Goddess embroideries also refer to the broader widespread female tradition of embellishing woven
cloth with art that depicts the immanence and communal veneration of a female divinity who
represents a notable part of the natural world. Although, both Finns and Hungarians have strong
3



traditions in ritual or sacred textiles, this paper concentrates on Finnic goddess embroideries which
display definitive mythic links to celestial mare goddesses and swan maidens..
Unfortunately, I didn’t inherit any traditions, textile or
otherwise through my father's Hungarian ancestry. From my
maternal Finnish heritage, however, I grew up learning many
familial and ethnic food traditions. Textile handwork was not
explicitly presented to me as a either family or Finnish tradition.
Instead, working with fabric, needle, and thread simply was
something that all the women in my maternal line did. However,
these textile arts were never presented as sacred female or Finnish
traditions..

Instead, throughout my childhood, I heard stitchery stories about my grandmother Hazel.
Evidently a superb seamstress, she could merely size up an article of clothing in a store window,
return home, draw up a pattern, and then sew up a nearly identical garment. I assume she learned
this astonishing skill from her mother, Lisa—my Finnish great-grandma who at 24 years old
emigrated to America. My grandmother Hazel died when I was quite young. Therefore, instead of
hearing more stitchery stories from her or seeing her skills, I simply witnessed my family’s devotion
to textile arts.
My great-aunt made dozens of intricate hooked rugs, one aunt knitted and embroidered
exquisitely, the other crocheted up a storm. My mother, an accomplished seamstress and excellent
embroiderer herself, made the majority of clothes for my sister and me until we were in high school.
I learned to hand-sew, machine-sew, and embroider—all with decent proficiency. Later, when my
daughter was getting married, I hand-beaded nearly all of the lace for her wedding dress. Yet, none
4



of this prolific expert textile handiwork was ever deliberately or explicitly linked back to our Finnish
roots. Now, of course, I see this obvious family tradition as a textile link to our Finnish heritage.
Finnic Goddess Embroidery
Across the globe, embroidery is an enduring women’s art form. Embellishing clothing and
textiles of all sorts serves as a celebration of ethnic identities; a permanent textile message honoring
deities, seasons, and natural powers; a continual visual prayer for divine protection and favor; and
often, a pictorial “text” that preserves female spiritual symbolism, mythologies, and rituals. The
broader category of goddess art is both ubiquitous and ancient. Representations of diverse
goddesses show up in sculptures, paintings, carvings, weavings, songs, dances, writings, symbols, tile
patterns, and more. Embroideries featuring a goddess or goddesses are a smaller yet important part
of that artistic tradition.
Additionally, it appears that goddess embroideries in the subarctic regions of northern
Europe are quite cohesive in their subject matter. These embroideries favor a sun goddess with
either raised or lowered arms, accompanied by horses, swans or other birds, and the Tree of Life or
plants. Solar symbols such as swastikas, rayed sun faces, or a circle with a cross through it are also
prominent. All of the symbols appear squared due to the constraints of stitching on linen.
Like most art, embroidery doesn’t follow geo-political boundary lines, adhering instead to
both linguistic groups and ethnic cultural traditions. Regarding art categorized as folk art, this
adherence is especially strong. For the purposes of this paper, the folk art bond to both language
and ethnic culture is an important distinction. This distinction opens the door toward a deeper
understanding that certain goddess embroideries currently categorized as “Russian folk
embroideries” are actually mislabeled. The mislabeling of their provenance and historicity may be
due to an overlay of more recent geo-politically-derived boundaries instead of a more accurate
5



ethnographic designation. Thus, designations of certain goddess embroideries as Slavic or Russian
(or even as Northern Russian, Karelian or Estonian) are also misleading. By this I mean, that claims
of certain goddess embroideries as broadly Russian automatically then situates these folk art objects
and the art they contain within a sizable Russian textile tradition as well as within a Slavic mythology
and religious perspective.
I argue that, by doing so, a more ancient Finnic folk art with its corresponding mythos is
subsumed under improper Russian or Slavic designations and interpretations. Finnic peoples, i.e.
Baltic Finns, speak Finnic languages, share Finnic cultural traditions, and live in historically-occupied
Finnic lands. These historic lands lie within Northern European subarctic to arctic zones. The
world’s subarctic regions are those that begin at roughly 55oN of the equator; Finland and the entire
Baltic region are subarctic lands. The world’s subarctic regions inhabit the forested border between
northern circumpolar lands/peoples and the vast southern steppes/peoples. The broader term of
Finnic peoples includes Finns, Saams, Estonians, Ingarians, Karelians, Veps, Mari, Lavonians,
Olonets, and Votes or Vadja, among others. On the other hand, Slavic peoples, who speak specific
types of Indo-European languages, include Russians, Croatians, Bulgarians, Czechs, Serbs,
Ukrainians, and Macedonians among others.
Textile expert Elizabeth Wayland Barber unwittingly aids us in making the visual distinction
between Finnic and Russian goddess embroideries. She remarks that “red and black on a white
ground”—a noted goddess color motif throughout the world—“dominated” Slavic goddess
embroideries (164). The illustration below shows an example of Slavic/Russian red-black goddess
1
embroidery. The goddess Makosh wears a white shirt richly embroidered with solar symbols on the
sleeves and a featured panel of red and black embroidery highlighting the sun goddess with raised
In contrast, Jaan Puhvel argues for an Indo-European tricolor motif of red-white-green (see Comparative Mythology,
1
125). However, red-white-green as a color motif simply does not have the regular rate of occurrence in myths and folktales, as well as ritual art, that red-black-white does. Nor does red-white-green appear as a standard embroidery color motif.

Although she mentions these goddess embroideries, Barber herself does not distinguish
between Russian and Finnic. Russian goddess embroideries predominately feature the red-white
black color palette, but may also include yellow. The beloved Russian goddess of fate, Baba Yaga has
three horsemen—white, red, and black—who ride across the sky at her bidding. Over millennia,
white has been associated with light and daylight; red with fire, blood, and warmth; and black with
darkness or night. Goddess embroidery expert Mary B. Kelly acknowledges that “the preponderance
7



of Finno-Ugric dress is red and white,” but she, too, does not separate this cultural embroidery out
from Slavic or Russian embroidery (Goddess 156).2
To my eye, Finnic embroideries are easily identified by their limited color palette and
consistent embroidery symbols, as well as a depiction of the supernatural power Finns call väki.
Finnic women and girls cross-stitched singularly red embroidery goddesses designs on white linen
(see Fig. 4). The color emphasis is clear as is the mythic representation. The white linen symbolizes
light, extended days, and being in “right relationship with both the living and the dead,” (Kelly
Goddess 156). The red thread stands for the sun’s warmth, women’s menstrual blood, and “design,
motif, ornament or writing” (Kelly Goddess 156). Together they represent the white expanse of the
Milky Way with prominent red stars , the red ochre and white bones of death, and the childbirth
3
blood and milk of new mothers. This color and textile symbolism also honors the migratory life
arriving with the renewed sun: swans finding mates and hatching chicks; wild mares bearing spring
foals.
Barber remarks that rural girls in the Fino-Baltic region devoted substantial time learning
how to skillfully create woven cloth used for daily tasks and for ritual occasions such as births,
weddings, and death, i.e. clothing, linens, beddings, and shrouds. She notes that,
“principal among these . . . were the ritual towels, [käspaikka of the Finnic peoples] or rushniki (as the Russians call them): swatches of linen a couple of feet to a couple
of yards/meters in length, the ends covered with age-old magic symbols for fertility
and protection. Stylized goddesses dance singly or in long chorus lines across these towels” (162-64).
In Finnish, Kirjonta means embroidery. Kirjonta is sewn onto the the edges and ends of
clothing and household textiles creating protective symbolic borders that shield both the wearer and
Mary B. Kelly in her Goddess Embroideries of the Northlands (125) views this distinctive embroidery style as Karelian by

which she means Russian and does not link this embroidery to Finnic peoples or lands.
Several cultures believed that swans were the messengers or vehicles of the dead and also flew souls to the Milky Way.

the home. To understand the enduring and crucial function of the protective kirjonta, Stark informs
us that generally, from the nineteenth century back into prehistory:
“Finns experienced themselves as ‘open’ and vulnerable to their environment, and used magic to protect themselves from its intrusion into the self. This was because
in their mode of experience, the world did not remain external to the self, but was
entangled with it” (Magic 127).
As part of being inextricably intertwined with the natural world, Finns were also in relation
with väki (Gender 156) . Stark describes väki as “impersonal forces of a supernatural nature . . . the
4
essence of an object or animate being” who emanates an innate “‘power charge’”—one with limited
scope, but demonstrably potent affects. Water, fire, iron, death, earth or stone, sauna steam, female
5
sexuality, forests, and particular wild animals all contain väki (Gender 156-59, 162). In relation to
protecting their porous self, Finns viewed the openings of clothing (such as edges of cloth, hems,
sleeves, neck openings, and the like) as liminal areas—poised between being open or shut.
Finnic embroideries regularly feature a sun goddess with a tree of life, horses, swans or
geese, and solar symbols. Potentially, Finnic peoples saw swans (as birds of both air and water) and
horses (who mirrored the sun’s speed) as some of the wild creatures, which, like women and girls,
contain väki. Importantly, goddess embroideries stitched by women
and girls onto the hems of cloth and clothing effectively closed
vulnerable entry points to supernatural powers. Furthermore, these
goddess embroideries offered strong protection and blessings from
both the sun goddess’s väki and the women’s väki to everyone.

Stark refers to the Paleolithic age of the word väki. This leads me to contemplate the astonishing persistence over a vast
4
span of time in speaking this word, practicing it ritually, and embroidering it as part of a Finnic female mythos.
She notes that “väki has been compared to the Melanesian concept of mana, the Iroquois concept of orenda, and its
5
closer Old Scandinavian counterpart meginn.” (Gender 156).

Several Finnish folk narratives document that with the sun’s return in spring, prior to letting
the livestock out to forage, women would stand wide-legged on a raised shelf above the barn’s main
doors. The animals passed underneath her väki—her crotch, her
vagina, and symbolically her womb—which protected the livestock
from harm and conferred blessings of fertility and health upon
them (Stark Gender 164-68). I believe that Finnic goddess
embroideries such as the ones shown here definitely link female väki
with the sun goddess’ power to generate new life, offer protective
warmth, and nourish the land, peoples, and animals.

Käspaikka is Finnish for any embroidered ritual towel intended for
daily use. These cloths display a simpler design (see Fig. 4). Juhlakäspaikat refers to more elaborate
goddess embroideries on ceremonial cloths intended for specific uses: births, marriages, and deaths;
sanctifying sacred areas of the home; and as textile offerings for times needing greater divine aid,
protection, and blessings.
Hubbs highlights the multiple ceremonies in Northern Russia where these goddess
embroidered towels were essential. She states that,
they “adorned the head of the bride to invoke her fertility; in death they were placed around the bones of the exhumed ancestors [. . . ;] in springtime, girls decorated
early-flowering trees—the birch, preeminently—with ritual towels to invoke the
productivity of nature; [and] in the house, the embroidered image of the goddess covered the loaf of bread placed upon the domestic altar for the ancestors” (25).
Kelly also documents that the juhlakäspaikat and käspaikka were ritually used in childbirth labor,
birth, and wrapping the newborn; as wedding clothes, bedding, gifts and ceremonial decorations;
and as funerary clothing, coffin coverings and grave markers (Kaspaikka 2).
10



Therefore, juhlakäspaikat and käspaikka represent Finnic peoples’ awareness of the powers
6
of the solar goddess of life and death who imbued her väki—her life force—into the earth, forest,
water, fire, air, metal, death, women, and wild animals. In particular, Finns felt that the embroidered
cloth also naturally “gathered holiness and healing to itself ” (Peliltonen et al., qtd. in Kelly Kaspaikka
3). These goddess embroideries reflect Finnic women’s stitched scripture venerating seasonal cycles,
the rhythms and practices of everyday life, human rites of passage, and humans’ interdependence on
an immanent world.

Figure 6 shows the sun goddess with upraised hands holding birds, plant life beside her, and

stamp, depicts the sun goddess with her daughters as twin solar mare goddesses. Barber sees the
solar goddess with upraised arms as depicting a “maiden” goddess (163); I view this figure as
representing goddesses of the spring and summer sun.

of anchored fertility, thriving offspring, and the steady, beaming warmth of love—all stitched
blessings for a newly married couple. Again, the textile symbolism matches the careful observation
the horses and swans around them.
“Mares . . . decide which stallion to mate with—a prominent theme in many celestial mare goddess myths. This sexual agency, reflected directly in mare goddess myths,
spills over onto the swan maidens who are typically associated with goddesses of
love, sexuality, and procreation. Thus, it also makes sense that swans and mares symbolized goddesses of sexuality, love, time, and destiny and were stitched onto
wedding apparel”(Merisante Aloft 6).

Symbolism and Myth: Embroidered Solar Mare Goddesses and Swan Maidens
The goddess embroidery patterns shown here together with the woven linens reflect a
distinctly female mythos. Spinning artifacts and symbols representing goddesses mark a common
thread between many far-flung cultures. Scholar Patricia Monaghan explains that:
“fiber and whorl [. . .are] connected with the sun goddess. The round sun is like a
spindle anchoring the light; light rays jut from the sun like hair, or yarn. [. . .]
12



Spinning is an apt metaphor for the production of light, for it was in the past a constant, apparently endless activity. [. . .] The woman with her ceaseless spinning
was both the model and representative of the spinning sun goddess” (106).
Although diverse goddess embroideries exist throughout the world, Finnic embroideries
display a woven ‘text’ representing symbols, rituals, and narratives that are perhaps millennia old.
Monaghan notes that throughout the Baltic Sea region, “the connection between the sun and
spinning is very old, and the sun-stone, amber, forms the link.” Amber spindles and discs—i.e. drop
spindles—are common grave goods in “the most ancient burial mounds in the region.” Monaghan
states, that “amber was considered a magical substance for a spinner; as the light never tangles in the
sky, so an amber spindle protected threads from snarls” (106).

Thus, the solar spinner with her golden stone was “common to all peoples of the Baltic
coasts; [. . .] appearing among Finno-Ugrians and Russians [. . .] Balts, Germans and Scandinavians.”
For Finns, the weaving and spinning sun goddess is Päivätär; in Estonia, she is Päike; in Hungary,
she is Beiwe; in pre-Teutonic lands, she is Mother Holle or Hulda; and in Lithuania and Latvia, she is
Saule. Monaghan concludes that “the oldest form of the spinning sun goddess was probably an
indigenous deity of the subarctic, a goddess whose worship preceded the coming of the Indo
Europeans, who brought their own sun goddess with them” (107). More often than not, the Indo
13



European sun goddess (who may have merged with the Uralic sun goddess) was also depicted as a
mare (Merisante Women & Aloft).
The sun goddess who weaves light and life governed the timing of the seasons with its
inevitable cycle into darkness and death. Weaving and spinning goddesses around the world are
often goddesses of fate, destiny, and time. The Finnic sun goddess was no exception. In Finnic
embroidery, she is represented by specific beings—horses, swans or geese, and women—who
represent cyclic time, sex and sexuality, love and devotion, and, especially for women, the razor’s
edge between life and death that can often be experienced in childbirth. Finnic goddess embroidery
encapsulates seasonal, celestial, and animal cycles as well as the deeper mythic symbolism that arose
out of them.
This tangible textile practice offers additional evidence of solar swan and mare goddesses
being interwoven from a long-standing mythical tradition. Myths of solar mare goddesses from
textual sources and archeological artifacts have been traced from approximately 2000 BCE onwards
and range from northern India to Celtic and Germanic lands (O’Flaherty 79, Merisante Aloft 2-3).
According to scholar A. T. Hatto, swan maiden folktales and myths may also span over four
millennia and three continents (328, 333). For decades, scholars believed that swan maiden myths
originated in India or the Far East. Similarly, previous scholarly work on solar mare goddess myths
also targeted India and Indo-Aryan peoples as an origin point.7
However, neither swans nor horses are native to India. Hindu scholar Wendy Doniger points
out that horses were a late and continually imported addition to the fauna of northwest India
(Hindus 41-2). Mute swans overwinter in the Himalayas and India’s northwest; the same regions that
imported horses for centuries. The oldest known textual account of a solar mare goddess lies within
the Rig Veda (10.17.1-2) which speaks of Saranyū, a Hindu solar mare goddess who, like the swan

goddess Leda, bears two sets of twins—one set being the divine Aśvins. In Sanskrit, hamsa means
both goose or swan, especially a mythical swan possessing uncanny knowledge. Significantly, in
Hindu mythology, the swan is the alternate form of the dancing morning star goddess Urvaśi, as
well as the divine vehicle for Sarasvati, the mother of all rivers and the goddess of knowledge. A
goose serves as a vehicle for her consort, Brahma, the four-headed god of creation.
Hatto persuasively argues that the origin of swan maiden myths and tales arises from
peoples speaking Uralic and Altaic languages (326-52). The primary locations of these peoples are
8
the world’s sub-arctic regions—regions that also correspond to:
• swan migration routes to spring & summer mating and breeding grounds,
• ancient Uralic and Altaic practices of magic and shamanism,
• worship of sun goddesses, and • pre-historic matrilineal societies (Hatto 326-52).
Current research backs up Hatto’s claims. Linguistics show definite contact between Proto
Uralic speakers and Proto-Indo-European speakers from 4000 BCE onwards (Anthony 94-6).9
Anthropologist David W. Anthony states that both linguistic ancestral ties and word borrowings
show solid evidence of trade relations between pastoral Proto-Indo-European (PIE) speakers and
forest-dwelling Proto-Uralic (P-U) speakers. Two of the thirteen earliest borrowings are words for
spinning and wandering (96). Additionally, Barber notes that, “all the data suggest that until late
Roman times, the speakers of Uralic and Altaic [languages . . .] always inhabited the belt to the north
of the Indo-Europeans across Eurasia, [. . . a belt] where the swan-geese and dancing cranes
breed” (204). Furthermore, Finnish linguist Jaakko Häkkinen places the Proto-Uralic homeland in
the middle regions of the Volga River (5). This geographical, linguistic, and ethnographic evidence
Uralic and Altaic languages continue to promote lively debate over their origins as well as their linguistic connections.

Häkkinen posits the date of initial contact at approximately 2,800 BCE (1, 5).

15



of early Uralic speakers point convincingly to a long-standing convergence with the migratory lands
of swans and horses in northwestern Europe.
My research tracks this convergence in myths of solar mare goddesses and swan maidens.
Goddesses of sexuality, love, light, fate, death, and time such as Aphrodite, Hera, Leda, Helen,
Holda, Sarasvati, Solntse, Urvasī, Isis, Saulė, Devi, and Tibetan dakinis are all mythically linked to
swans or geese” (Merisante Aloft 5). Many of these goddesses carry epithets of light or are primarily
known as goddesses of celestial light.
Following their swan sisters, mare
goddesses such as Rhiannon, Macha,
Medusa, Melanippe, Leucippe,
Demeter, and Sarany ū also
symbolically represent light, fate,
death, sexuality, love, and time
(Merisante Women 7-8).

themes of weaving and “leaving” her children come into play within the myth of Shinto sun
goddess Amaterasu. However, the myth also alludes to this sun goddess owning a treasured horse.
After her brother kills and flays her horse, plunges it through her weaving hall roof, thus breaking
her loom, and killing one of her maidens, Amaterasu leaves her “children”—the Japanese people

laughter. Due to the raucous commotion, Amaterasu peers out, sees her reflection in a large mirror,
and returns to the world (DeFelice 4).
Leda or Leto (both meaning Lady), was originally a widely-worshipped swan goddess. Leda
gives birth to double twins—female and male, mortal and immortal—who are joined with celestial
mare goddesses. The female twins are the immortal Helen (whose name means light), a celestial
weaving goddess of love and the mortal Clytemnestra (whose name means famous wooing— an
allusion perhaps to swan courtship). Clytemnestra births three solar daughters—Electra (amber),
Chrysothemis (golden order). and Iphigenia (mothering a strong race) (Graves, 418). Leda’s male twins are
the Dioscuri, the celestial horsemen Kastor and Polydeuces. The Dioscuri wed the Leucippides (i.e.
the white horse women)—Hilaeira (shining) and Phoebe (bright moon) (Graves 246). Leda is also
conflated with the pre-Hellenic goddess Nemesis, another solar swan goddess who turns the year
and fate around in her hands. “Swans were sacred to [this] goddess, because of their white plumage,
[and . . .] the V-formation of their flight was a female symbol . . .” (Graves 126).
The most infamous of the three Greek Fates, golden-winged sun goddess Medusa, gives
birth through her parthenogenetic blood, (or by mating with the sea god), to the white winged
11
horse Pegasus and the golden sickle Chrysaor (Apollodorus II: 4. 2). “Chrysaor was Demeter’s new
moon sign, the golden sickle or falchion; her consorts carried it” symbolizing her claim on them
(Graves 129). Additionally, Aeschylus states that Medusa’s three other sisters, the Graeae, or ancient
maidens (dênaiai korai), are shaped like swans (788, 791). These swan sisters are also described as
robed in beauty and saffron (Hesiod 270), i.e. a rich gold produced from the stigma of crocuses—a
flower species known to signal the start of spring.
Patriarchal glosses attribute the birth of these twins to the blood of death; removing that gloss shows Medusa as a
11
solar goddess who, through the blood of childbirth, also creates twin solar divine beings. See Monaghan for Medusa as a sun goddess.
17



Like Medusa, Demeter, another mare goddess, mates with the sea god and subsequently,
gives birth to the horse Arion and the goddess Despoina (Lady or Mistress). In a possible variant of a
swan maiden tale, Demeter does not leave her child; instead, Persephone disappears. Demeter,
resembling the dying sun, withdraws from the world causing all plant and animal growth to cease. In
order to bring her out of her seclusion, the minor goddess Baubo, like Amaterasu’s Ame-no-uzume,
raises her skirts high in front of Demeter while telling her bawdy jokes, i.e. displaying the power of
female sexuality.
Freyja (meaning Lady), is the Scandinavian weaving goddess of sexuality, love, childbirth,
prophecy, gold, magic, and death. As my last example for this paper, Freyja displays an amalgamation
of fragmentary or bricolaged mythological borrowings, stronger revisions, or a combination of all.
In the same manner as the goddesses mentioned above, Freyja has distinct sun, bird, and horse
associations along with amber. In her case, however, these symbolic representations do not mesh
nearly as neatly. Freyja wears her solar amber necklace, Brísingamen, and a cloak of feathers; not
swan, but falcon or hawk feathers. Yet Freyja has her own marshy hall for the dead—Fensalir. Her
wetlands of the dead do point to perhaps prior links with water-birds such as swans, geese, or ducks.
Freyja bears beautiful, light-filled offspring who may be again doubled twins: her sons, the beautiful
Balder and blind Hödr, and her shining daughters Hnoss and Gersemi (Larrington, 4-13, 53, 97-8).
She is not a definitive mare goddess; instead, her twin brother Freyr has a horse cult attached
to him. Additionally, they both own magical boars; his being the one made of gold and light.
However, as the prototypical Scandinavian volva, a magical seeress, she does have the ability to “turn
into a mare and to carry a man away to death” (Walker 1039). Freyja carries a vala, meaning a staff
of power, but she herself is the great Vala of Valpurisnacht, the Beltane celebration where bonfires
were lit in her honor (Kelly, Goddess 191). Does this then point to Freyja also representing the great
immortal World Tree who is lit with the shining light of the sun?

Vale and volva may be etymological links to the term “valkyrie.” Freyja is called Valfreya,
mistress of the slain. Valkyries are divine golden-haired warrior women, wearing golden armor, and
flying over land and sea on immortal horses. As Freyja’s maidens, they determine which warriors go
to Valhalla or Fensalir where they serve slain warriors inexhaustible amber-colored mead. Valkyries
appear to both parallel and combine swan maidens and mare goddesses who symbolize the path to
death, the afterlife, and the underworld. Mircea Eliade notes that,
“the Valkyries are psychopomps and sometimes play the role of the ‘celestial wives’ to ‘spirit-wives’ or the Siberian shamans; but we have seen that this later complex
extends beyond the sphere of shamanism and has elements both of the mythology
of Woman and the mythology of Death” (381-82).
Conclusion
As a comparative mythologist whose speciality is the mythology of women, I see Eliade
partially recognizing that the mythology of women does encircle the realm of death. He leaves it
there however. More capacious, the mythology of women also oversees the realms of life, birth,
relations with the natural world, and women’s own innate powers. Additionally, Finnic women were
shamans in their own right. Further, the combination of the väki contained in the fire, birch
branches, stones, and water of a sauna (a long-standing Finnic sacred space) coupled with the väki
of women would undoubtably be seen as quite powerful. Finnish women have a long-standing
practice of using the sauna for ritual purposes, for menstruation, for aid in childbirth, and for
cleansing a deceased person. The union of women’s innate powers with the realms of birth, fertility,
sexuality, and death (often historically viewed as a female domain also) may have served to reinforce
women’s connection to a sun goddess and fate.
Throughout this paper, I make the case that Finnic women made their own distinct goddess
embroideries; that these embroideries reflect the rhythms, cycles, and creatures of the natural world
19



around them; and that Finnic goddess embroideries represent a deep mythic tradition centered on
solar goddesses, female väki, and the powers of life, death, fate, light, and love.
Drawing upon scholarship within textile archaeology, anthropology, mythology, zoology, and
linguistics, I present strong evidence here that Finnic goddess embroideries are firmly tied to ancient
myths of solar mare goddesses and swan maidens. Indeed, it is highly likely that Finnic belief in the
supernatural powers of female väki became translated across continents into the Greek mare
goddess Demeter’s Baubo and the Japanese sun goddess Amaterasu’s Ame-no-uzume.
There is at present, no way to determine the length and breadth of time in which Finnic
women have created, used, and handed down the craft and magic of their goddess embroidery.
However, we do have evidence on how far these myths and female symbols spread. The persistence
and consistency of these embroidered female sun goddesses with their swan or mare counterparts
convinces me that Finnic women did use käspaikka as a long-standing inherited fabrica—a textile text
and spiritual practice—one that wove generations of females into the weft of treasured mythic
narratives and the warp of rituals of power, renewal, cycles, and love.
