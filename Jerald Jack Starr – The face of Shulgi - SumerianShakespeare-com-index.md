A foundation statue of Shulgi, the king of Ur, the king of Sumer and
Akkad.

The above image is an enlargement of the
picture
on the left, with some resultant loss of image quality
due to the added magnification.
This small picture of the statue is the only one I had.
Even at such a small scale, something about this face immediately caught
my attention.

I was looking at this picture of the two foundation statues of Shulgi. I
instantly knew
it was him, even before I read the caption. I've done a lot of research into
Shulgi, so I know
what he looks like. I can recognize his statues at a glance, so I’m
something of an expert
on the subject (a self-professed expert, admittedly, and probably the only
one in the world).
I had already developed a general idea of Shulgi’s appearance based on his
many statues.

I can also distinguish between Shulgi’s statues and those of his father, Ur
Namma.
They look very similar, but not the same. There are a few subtle
differences between them.
Shulgi
The figure on the left is very crude, typical of most foundation statues
throughout most of
Sumerian history. The entire statue is about 12 inches tall, so the face is
about an inch high.
It’s very difficult to model the facial features on such a small scale, so the
artist sculpted
just a few lines to create a rough impression of the eyes, ears, nose, and
mouth.
Although crude, even primitive, this statue is correct in all of its essential
details. Shulgi had
a round face and a bulbous nose. He also had a down turned mouth and
heavy-lidded eyes
that were asymmetrical.
When I looked at the statue on the right...

I was looking across 4,000 years of history,
staring into the face of a living man
who was staring back at me.
I had been looking for this man for quite some time.
It all started in 2010, when I recognized Ur-Namma in the Met Museum.
See The Face of Ur-Namma.
Ur-Namma. The king of Ur, the king of Sumer and Akkad, and the father
of Shulgi.
Ur-Namma's most noticeable features were his eyes. Not only were they
heavy-lidded,
they were also asymmetric. His drooping eyelid was the result of the
hereditary condition
known as “congenital ptosis”. It is present at birth and it doesn’t affect the

vision.
Enlarge.
All of Ur-Namma’s foundation statues portray the asymmetry of his eyes.
Before Ur-Namma, a foundation statue had a simple and generic depiction
of a man's face.
It wasn't a recognizable portrait of the king as a distinct individual. Ur
Namma was the
first king with foundation statues that actually looked like him, the way he
looked in real life.
Despite his unusual demeanor, or because of it, Ur-Namma created
recognizable statues
that deliberately portrayed the asymmetry of his eyes. A drooping eyelid is
not a kingly look,
but Ur-Namma was not embarrassed by it.
Since congenital ptosis is a hereditary condition, Ur-Namma transmitted
it to his son.
All Shulgi foundation statues portray his asymmetric eyes.

They also portray his rounded face and his prominent nose.
Most of the Shulgi foundation statues convey his basic facial features, but
many of them
are really quite crude, almost comical. This is somewhat surprising,
considering the fact
that an artistic renaissance occurred during his reign. I expected better
quality in the statues
of Shulgi. I thought they should have more artistic merit.
Six years ago, when I discovered the realistic statue of Ur-Namma, I
immediately guessed
that his son had also made a realistic portrait of himself. It seemed almost
inevitable,
given Shulgi’s vanity and his artistic nature. I was certain that somewhere
out there
a realistic portrait of Shulgi was waiting to be discovered.
Realistic human portraiture was a recent development in Sumer (and in

the world). It began during the reign of Gudea.

Gudea.
This is the first realistic portrait
of any human being in all of history.
Ur-Ningirsu, the son of Gudea,
also had a realistic portrait of himself.

Ur-Namma, the father of Shulgi,
continued the tradition.
Unfortunately, very few statues of
Shulgi
survived the ravages of time. All of them are
heavily damaged. None of them have a face.
I knew a realistic statue of Shulgi was out there somewhere. I kept hoping
it would soon

be discovered, but I had my doubts. Archaeological expeditions to Iraq
were suspended
due to the constant warfare in the region, so I had little confidence that
the statue would be discovered during my lifetime.
Little did I know, the statue had already been found.
Nippur, circa
1956 (AD).
After 4,000 years, a Shulgi statue emerges from its foundation box into
the light of day.
Meanwhile I was scouring the Internet, trying to find a Shulgi statue in a
museum collection.
I was hoping it was mislabeled and overlooked, like the statues of other
Sumerian kings
that I had already identified. Finding Shulgi was always at the back of my
mind. Even when
I was researching other subjects, I kept looking for Shulgi.
The statue pictured below is a simple and abstract portrayal of Shulgi’s
facial features.
Trying to to find the real Shulgi based on this statue was like trying to find
a real person
based on a crude composite sketch.

I was looking for a man who
looked something like this.
He had a round face, a bulbous nose, and a mouth turned down at the
corners. His eyes were heavy-lidded and asymmetrical. I was looking for...
Shulgi.
The face of Shulgi. It is photographic in its realism. This is exactly how

Shulgi looked
when he was a living man and a reigning king.
This is not a prettified portrait. The statue is uncompromising in it
realism. Like Ur-Namma,
Shulgi preferred to show his real appearance, without idealization, and
without the
ancient version of Photoshop, as it were. He didn’t make his asymmetric
eyes more even
to minimize his ptosis and make him seem more regal. He didn’t reduce
the size of his nose
to make himself more handsome. Then again, Shulgi didn’t need to look
like everyone else.
His face was not conventionally handsome, but it was strong and
charismatic.
Once you’ve seen this statue, you know exactly what Shulgi looks like. Not
“kinda, sorta”,
but exactly. You would instantly recognize him if you met him on a city
street, even if
he was wearing a suit and tie.
Perhaps you have already met somebody who looks like this. I know I
have. In a way,
it could be said that Shulgi is a “type”. But even in a room full of similar
men, Shulgi
would be instantly recognizable by his asymmetric eyes.
The first time I added magnification to this
picture,
it startled me. It was like seeing a ghost:

The blurry spectral image set on a dark background; the eerie lighting, the
tattered
diaphanous robe streaming in the light; it was like the photograph of a
ghost; the ghost
of a king. It's as if the spirit of Shulgi, who was buried 4,000 years ago,
transmitted as a
holographic image on my computer, appearing once again exactly as he
appeared in life,
in all of his power and glory. I swear, if a bright light had burst forth from
my computer and
Shulgi himself appeared before me, I wouldn’t have been a bit surprised.
Now I knew why
he was staring at me so intently from that small little photograph. He had
willed himself

into the modern world.
In a real sense, that’s precisely what he did when he made this bronze
portrait of himself
in the 20th century BC. He guaranteed that he would still be around in the
20th century AD,
and beyond. With this statue, he made himself immortal.
I love these old photographs of Shulgi (courtesy of the Oriental Institute of
the University of Chicago), but hopefully some better high-resolution
photos will soon become available.
When they are published, I'll be sure to post them.
In the meantime...
This is the actual size of the statue, based on my estimate that it was 9
inches tall (see the
entire statue). It required incredible skill and artistry to create this statue.
Imagine trying to
model a photo-realistic face on such a small scale. This is by far the best
foundation statue
ever created. It is in a class of its own. You've seen many foundation
statues on this page,
The face of Shulgi about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/789301.html

so you already know that nothing else compares to it.
Shulgi himself did not sit for this portrait. A king didn't have a lot of time
to sit around posing
for every little statue. Nor did the artist first attempt a realistic portrait on
such a small scale.
It's much easier to accurately model a life-size statue, then scale it down.
Shulgi posed for a
life-size portrait, and this statue is a scaled down version of it. Given the
detail and precision
of the statue, I believe it was created by the same artist who created the
life-sized version.
The artist clearly knew every crease and contour of Shulgi's face.
So ...
Somewhere out there is a life-size, realistic portrait of Shulgi, just like the
realistic statue
of his father Ur-Namma. This would be the Holy Grail of Sumerology.
The {d} is dingir, representing divinity. It means
Shulgi was worshiped as a god during his lifetime.

I will soon add a biography of Shulgi to this website. For now, here is a
brief introduction:
Shulgi was an intellectual. He was an accomplished writer and a talented
musician.
He spoke several languages. The arts blossomed during his reign. Shulgi
was a
“renaissance man”, long before the term was even invented.
He was a powerful athlete and a marathon runner. He hunted lions for
sport.
He was also a warrior, a priest, a king, and a living god.
He ruled for 48 years when Sumerian civilization was at its peak, at its
absolute pinnacle.
He was the greatest king of Sumer, where there wasn’t any shortage of
great kings. In the

long history of the world, he was one of the greatest kings who ever ruled.
He should be
just as famous as Caesar and Alexander. Even they would be in awe of his
achievements.
He lived almost two millennia before they were born, so even they would
consider him to be impossibly ancient.
Now he suddenly appears in the modern world, looking exactly as he did
4,000 years ago,
when he was a living man and a reigning king, at the peak of his power
and glory.
Shulgi resurrected.
