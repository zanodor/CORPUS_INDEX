DEDICATIONS
This 2004 “Limited Edition” of The Egyptian Mystery “School of On (Annu)”: Esoteric
Atannuology. Egyptology and Rastafariology is dedicated first to the comparative religion
scholarship and mastery of spirituality of the now deceased (1973) Light and Sound (Surat
Shabd) Yoga Sant Kirpal Singh Ji who inspired this work’s over 10 years of research.
Master Kirpal Singh Ji was the first to identify the Aten Path promulgated by ancient
Egyptian Pharaoh Ikhnaton\Akhenaten’s as an ancient version of today’s Light and Sound
(Surat Shabd) Yoga in his monumental book Naam or Word, (page 38) as follows:
“Four thousand years back. we find that in Egypt it {The ‘Path of Naam or
Shabd’} was known as the ‘Path of the Aten’ which was preached by King
lkhnaton.” (emphasis added)
Master Kirpal Singh Ji also formulated the “Human Development Center” model based on
the aboriginal and ubiquitous “Mystery School” model of which this work’s major subject the
Biblical “School of On” was the ancient Western Civilization’s standard.
Secondly, this work is dedicated to the now deceased (1989) Master of Light and Sound
(Surat Shabd) Yoga Sant Darshan Singh Ji,who initiated this author (2/29/1976); and who has
answered in his Perfect Master manner my prayers for research, development, funding and
guidance without which this work would not have been achievable.
Thirdly, this book is dedicated to the courageous scholarship of the great French Egyptologist
Abbe’ Emile Amelineau, who first brought the subjects of “Annuology” and “AtannuoIogy" to
public attention; i.e. the existence of and contribution to humanity by the black African Anu
People in the Aboriginal Nile Valley to the Predynastic and Dynastic periods of the Theocratic
System of Civilization and Spirituality of Ancient Egypt/Kemit. This scholarship cost him his
reputation and research support, as his findings and conclusions were ostracized and ridiculed by
the International Community of Egyptology led by fellow French Egyptologist Gaston C.C.
Maspero knighted by the English for his efforts. English Egyptologist Flinders Petrie replaced
Amelineau at his Abydos archeological work site wherein lay the last Predynastic Kings of the
Anu People.
Although Amelineau’s published works on these subjects, the 1899 Nouvelles Fouilles d’Abydos’
and the 1916 Prolenomenesta Itetude de Ia religion egyptienne, have not yet been published in
English; key findings were translated and included in Chek Anka Diop’s African Origin of
Civilization.
Fourthly, this work of love and appreciation is devotedly dedicated to the living Light and
Sound (Surat Shabd) Yoga and Science of Spirituality Master Sant Rajinder Singh Ji who
brings the Light and Sound Yoga mantle to America. This Master Sant graciously visited and
blessed with his family our BRCA/Hope LA-USA Project located at the Annu Biological Living
Center in the heart of South Central, Los Angeles, America in 1994.

PREFACE: ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MYSTERY “SCHOOL OF ON”
I. THE PRIMEVAL PRE-DYNASTICALLY FOUNDED ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MYSTERY SCHOOL OF ON (ANNU) HAD AT ITS CORE THE ABORIGINAL AND ESOTERIC SCIENCE OF SPIRITUALITY SYSTEM CALLED THE ”ATEN PATH”. TOWARDS THE END OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MYSTERY SCHOOL OF ON (ANNU)
ROLE AS THE MAJOR PLAYER IN ANCIENT EGYPT/KEMIT’S THEOCRATIC GOVERNMENT AND SOCIETY, THE PREVIOUS ESOTERIC SPIRITUALITY SYSTEM OF THE “ATEN PATH” WAS PUBLICALLY REVEALED AND MADE FAMOUS BY THE “HERETIC” PHARAOH AKHENATEN IN THE 18 TH DYNASTY. DURING PHARAOH AKHENATEN’S REIN THE SHORT-LIVED CITY OF AKHETATEN (AMARNA) BECAME THE NEW CAPITAL OF EGYPT WHOSE SOCIAL RELIGION WAS THE “ATEN PATH.” AS SUCH PHARAOH AKHENATON IS HISTORICALLY CREDITED AS HAVING ESTABLISHED THE FIRST MONOTHEISTIC RELIGION.
BUT THE “ATEN PATH” HAD BEEN ESOTERICALLY REVEALED IN PRE-DYNASTIC STONE AGE EGYPT/KEMIT BY THE GODHEAD ANNU TO THE SACRED PEOPLES OF THE NILE RIVER VALLEY; I.E. TO THE FOUR BLACK AFRICAN ANU PEOPLES. THESE CULTURALLY CONNECTED PEOPLES LIVED IN THE EGYPTIAN VASSAL STATES OF NUBIA, KUSH, MEROE AND KHENTHUNNEFER; RESPECTIVELY SITUATED ALONG THE ENTIRE COURSE OF THE NILE RIVER FROM THE DELTA TO THE GREAT LAKES OF CENTRAL AFRICA. THE “ATEN PATH” SPIRITUALITY SYSTEM WAS BASED ON THE CONTINUOUS COSMOGONIC
EVENT DESCRIBED ON THE DYNASTIC PERIOD SHABAKA STONE NOW IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM, ITSELF A COPY OF A PRE-DYNASTIC PERIOD ORIGINAL STONE DOCUMENT; WHEREIN THE FORMLESS CREATIVE BEING ANNU CREATED AND CONTINUES TO CREATE FORM, MATTER AND THE UNIVERSE POSTULATED TODAY IN PHYSICS AS THE “ BIG BANG EVENT.” SIMULTANEOUSLY THE EGYPTIAN MYSTERY SCHOOL OF ON (ANNU) WAS MONOTHEISTIC AND PANTHEISTIC HAVING A 12 SUN GOD AND GODDESS HIERARCHY THAT EMANTED FROM THE GODHEAD ANNU. SEE APPENDIX_I-B FOR DETAILS.
THE SPIRITUALITY SYSTEM DOCTRINES OF THE “ATEN PATH” ARE DERIVED FROM THE COMPARATIVE RELIGIOUS STUDIES OF THE WORLD’S SOCIAL RELIGIONS AND THEIR MYSTIC PRACTICES BY SANT KIRPAL SINGH JI PRESENTED IN HIS BOOKS NAAM OR WORD AND CROWN OF LIFE. HE IDENTIFIES THE PRINCIPLES OF LIGHT AND SOUND (SURAT SHABD) YOGA SYMBOLIZED BY THE CHRISTIANS AS THE “TREE OF LIFE”, “THE WORD”, “LIGHT OF GOD”; BY THE MUSLIM SUFIS AS “HU”; BY THE ANCIENT PYTHAGOREANS AS THE “CELESTIAL HARMONY”; BY THE HINDUS AS NAAM AND BY THE SIKHS AS SURAT SHABD TO NAME A FEW SOCIAL RELIGIONS. THE DESCRIPTIVE PHRASES OF “CELESTIAL SOUND” AND “CELESTIAL LIGHT” ARE FOUND WITHOUT FAILURE IN THE TRANSLATIONS OF THE WORLD’S
RELIGION’S SPIRITUALITY WRITINGS. THE ANCIENT EGYPT/KEMIT SPIRITUALITY PRINCIPLES OF THE “ATEN PATH” WERE AND STILL ARE THE ONLY TRIED AND TRUE PATH TO THE “SALVATION OF THE HUMAN SOUL” NO MATTER WHAT NAME IT IS CALLED AND WHAT RELIGIOUS TRADITION ONE FINDS IT.
II. THE EGYPTIAN MYSTERY “SCHOOL OF ON” (ANNU) IS CITED IN THE BIBLE AS THE “SCHOOL OF ON” WHICH TRAINED JOSEPH (GENESIS 41: 45, 50, AND 46::20); AND IS INFERED BY THE BIBLE AS HAVING TRAINED MOSES (ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 7:22) CONFIRMED BY JOSEPHUS THE HISTORIAN.

IN ANCIENT TIMES THIS CITY WAS FULL OF OBELISKS DEDICATED TO THE SUN. OF THESE ONLY ONE NOW REMAINS STANDING. ‘CLEOPATRA'S NEEDLE’ WAS ONE OF THOSE WHICH STOOD IN THIS CITY IN FRONT OF THE TEMPLE OF (A)TUM, I.E., ‘THE SUN.’ IT IS NOW ERECTED ON THE THAMES EMBANKMENT, LONDON.

D. FROM SWIFT PLATINUM EASTON’S TOPICAL BIBLE :
MOSES “AT LENGTH BECAME ‘LEARNED IN ALL THE WISDOM OF THE EGYPTIANS’ (ACTS 7:22). EGYPT HAD THEN TWO CHIEF SEATS OF LEARNING, OR UNIVERSITIES, AT ONE OF WHICH, PROBABLY THAT OF HELIOPOLIS (ON), HIS EDUCATION WAS COMPLETED.” (EMPHASIS ADDED)

“WE ARE TOLD NOT ONLY BY THE BIBLE, BUT ALSO BY THE HISTORIAN PHIL0, THAT MOSES WAS AN INITIATE OF THE EGYPTIAN MYSTERIES..., WHOSE CREATION STORY OF GENESIS IS CLEARLY OF EGYPTIAN ORIGIN.”
III. THE ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MYSTERY SCHOOL OF ON (ANNU) TRAINED THE EGYPTIAN THEOCRACY’S ANNU PHARAOHS AND OTHER ROYALTY, VIZARS AND OTHER BUREACRATS AND PROFESSIONAL AND CULTURAL LEADERS OF ANCIENT EGYPT/KEMIT THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH ITS GREATEST SPIRITUALITY, PUBLIC WORKS, CULTURAL AND POLITICAL ACHIEVEMENTS. THE ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MYSTERY SCHOOL OF ON (ANNU) CURRICULUM OF THE 42 BOOKS OF THOTH ARE DESCRIBED BY CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA IN THE THIRD CENTURY A.D. (A. DEIBER, CLEMENT D’ ALEXANDRIA ET L’ EGYPTE, CAIRO, 1904, PG 72, TRANSLATED IN R.A. SCHWALLER DE LUBICZ, SACRED SCIENCE, THE KING OF PHARAONIC THEOCRACY, APPENDIX V, VT. 1988). THE ORIGINAL 42 BOOKS OF THOTH IN HIEROGLYPHICS ARE STILL “LOST”, AND THE ONES CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA VIEWED IN THE 3 RD CENTURY A.D. ARE BY NECESSITY PTOLOMY GREEK PERIOD EGYPTIAN COPIES TRANSLATED IN GREEK NOW “MISSING” PROBABLY IN THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH’S VATICAN LIBRARY.
THE NATURE, INFLUENCE AND HISTORY OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MYSTERY SCHOOL OF ON (ANNU) WAS PARTIALLY PRESENTED IN GEORGE JAMES’ STOLEN LEGACY (J. RICHARDSON, SAN FRANCISCO, 1976) AND IS FURTHER COMPLETED HEREIN. THE “ATEN PATH” WAS TAUGHT AT THE “INNER SUN” (ATEN) WORSHIPPING TEMPLE COLLEGE EXTENSIONS OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MYSTERY SCHOOL OF ON (ANNU) BASED ON MEDITATION ON THE ANNU KHET (SYMBOLIZED BY THE CIRCULAR CROSS THE ANKH) OR “STREAM OF CREATIVE LIFE ENERGY” THAT EMANATES CONSTANTLY FROM THE
SUPREME BEING THE ANNU. THE CENTRAL TEMPLE OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MYSTERY SCHOOL
WAS AT THE “CITY OF NORTH ANNU”, WHERE LATER IN THE BIBLE ANNU IS CORRUPTED TO “ON” AND LATER HELIOPOLIS. ITS MAIN TEMPLE SCHOOL EXTENSIONS WERE AT “ANEB-HETCH” OR MEMPHIS AND “ANNU OF THE SOUTH” OR TENTYRA (DENDYRA) WITH ITS MAIN PRIEST SCHOOL CAMPUS AND
“ATEN PATH” INITIATION SITE AT THE GIZAH PLATEAU COMPLEX OF 3 GREAT PYRAMIDS AND SPHINX ROCK SCULPTURE AND 2 SPHINX TEMPLES.
OUTLINED IN CHAPTER FIVE ARE THE NINE SPIRITUALITY DOCTRINES OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MYSTERY SCHOOL OF ON (ANNU), ITS “PATH OF THE ATEN 7 OR ATANNU” AND ITS SPIRITUALITY
CURRICULUM AS PART OF THE 42 BOOKS OF THOTH ALONG WITH ITS GREEK PHILOSOPHER STUDENT ALUMNI. IN CONSTRAST THE EGYPTIAN MYSTERY SCHOOL OF ON (ANNU) IS COMPARED WITH ITS
ANTITHETICAL SPIRITISM/SPIRITUALISM THEOCRATIC RIVAL THE THEBAN “SORCERY” LODGE SCHOOL CENTERED AFTER THE FIFTH DYNASTY AT THE CITY OF THEBES. THEY WORSHIPPED THE OUTER PHYSICAL PLANE MOON AND PHYSICAL SUN (RA) OSIRIS-AMEN-RA GOD TRIUMPHERANT WHOSE
GRAND MASONIC LODGE WAS HEADQUARTERED AT THE THEBES LUXOR METROPOLIS. FINALLY, THE MODERN DAY SURAT SHABD YOGA IN AMERICA KNOWN AS THE SCIENCE OF SPIRITUALITY IS COMPARED TO SHOW IT AS AN IDENTICAL MATCH TO THE ANCIENT EGYTPIAN MYSTERY SCHOOL OF ON (ANNU) “ATEN PATH”.

IV. AT THE BEGINNING OF WHAT THE ANCIENT EGYPTIAN TRAINED HISTORIANS HERODOTUS AND MANETHOS CALLED THE “DYNASTY OF THE DEMI-GODS” CIRCA 17,000 TO 10,000 B.C.; IN ANCIENT EGYPT/KEMIT PROPER (WITHOUT NILE RIVER CATARACTS) A THEOCRATIC
EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION FOR TEACHING THE DOCTRINES, TECHNOLOGIES AND TECHNIQUES REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH AND OPERATE A THEOCRATIC SOCIETY WAS STARTED BY THE DEMIGOD THOTH (TCHUTI OR HU) AT THE CITY OF “ANNU OF THE NORTH” JUST NORTHEAST OF
MEMPHIS REFERRED TO IN THE BIBLE THOUSANDS OF YEARS LATER AS THE “SCHOOL OF ON (ANNU).” THE CITY OF ANNU WAS KNOWN BY THE HEBREWS REFLECTED IN THE BIBLE OLD TESTAMENT AS ON AND BY THE GREEKS AS HELIOPOLIS.
ANCIENT EGYPT/KEMIT WAS DIVIDED BY THE DEMI-GOD THOTH (TCHUTI OR HU) INTO 42 THEOCRATIC STATES OR NOMES EACH RULED BY A THEOCRATIC KING-HIGH PRIEST TRAINED AT THE ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MYSTERY SCHOOL OF ON (ANNU). EACH THEOCRATIC NOME OR STATE WAS DEDICATED TO AN ASPECT OF DIVINE SYMBOLISM OR TOTEM AND EACH THE GUARDIAN OF ONE OF THE 42 BOOKS OF THOTH COVERING THE WRITTEN CURRICULUM TEACHINGS OF THE DOCTRINES, TECHNOLOGIES AND TECHNIQUES REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN A THEOCRATIC SOCIETY.
V. “PLOTINUS, EGYPTIAN BORN SPIRITUAL TEACHER WHO TAUGHT IN ANCIENT ROME, DEFINES THIS {SPIRITUALITY} EXPERIENCE AS THE LIBERATION OF THE MIND FROM ITS FINITE CONSCIOUSNESS WHEN IT BECAME ONE AND IS IDENTIFIED WITH THE INFINITE. THIS LIBERATION WAS NOT ONLY FREEDOM OF THE SOUL FROM BODILY IMPEDIMENTS, BUT ALSO FROM THE WHEEL OF REINCARNATION OR REBIRTH. IT INVOLVED A PROCESS OF DISCIPLINES OR PURIFICATION BOTH FOR THE BODY AND THE SOUL. SINCE THE (EGYPTIAN) MYSTERY SYSTEM OFFERED THE SALVATION OF THE SOUL IT ALSO PLACED GREAT EMPHASIS UPON ITS IMMORTALITY.”
“THE EGYPTIAN MYSTERY SYSTEM, LIKE THE UNIVERSITY WAS THE CENTER OF ORGANIZED CULTURE AND CANDIDATES ENTERED IT AS THE LEADING SOURCE OF ANCIENT CULTURE.” (FROM GEORGE JAMES’ STOLEN LEGACY. PG. 27) (EMPHASIS ADDED)
“ACCORDING TO PIETSCHMANN, THE EGYPTIAN MYSTERIES HAD THREE GRADES OF STUDENTS:
(1) THE MORTALS PROBATIONARY STUDENTS WHO WERE BEING INSTRUCTED BUT WHO HAD NOT YET EXPERIENCED THE INNER VISION.
(2) THE INTELLIGENCES THOSE WHO HAD ATTAINED THE INNER VISION AND HAD RECEIVED MIND OR NOUS.
(3) THE CREATORS OR SONS {AND DAUGHTERS} OF LIGHT WHO HAD BECOME
IDENTIFIED WITH OR UNITED WITH THE LIGHT, TRUE SPIRITUAL CONSCIOUSNESS.
FOR YEARS THEY UNDERWENT DISCIPLINARY INTELLECTUAL EXERCISES AND BODILY ASCETICS WITH INTERVALS OF TESTS AND ORDEALS TO DETERMINE THEIR FITNESS TO PROCEED TO THE MORE SERIOUS, SOLEMN AND AWFUL PROCESS OF ACTUAL INITIATION.
THEIR EDUCATION CONSISTED NOT ONLY IN THE CULTIVATION OF THE TEN VIRTUES, BUT ALSO SEVEN LIBERAL ARTS. THERE WAS ALSO ADMISSION TO THE GREATER MYSTERIES.”

THE EGYPTIAN MYSTERY “SCHOOL OF ON”, VOL. 1 BY GEORGE SINGLETON, ENLIGHTENMENT PUBLICATIONS, 2003 EDITION
xviii.



INTRODUCTION
The Sacred Scriptures are the highlight of this book presented in Chapter Six, the translation of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) Scriptures: “Chapters for
Manifestation of the Inner Sun Light of the Spiritual Regions”. Esoterically they were
originally copied from the now missing 42 Books of Thoth of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu), and represent its esoteric spirituality system we know historically from the 18 th Dynasty as the “Aten Path”. These ancient sacred scriptures embody the principles of modern Light and Sound Yoga and teach meditational communion with the Annu Khet (the Ankh circular cross), the Shabd, the “Creative Word” or the “Inner Lighted Sound” Current of the Godhead Annu. These Chapter Six Scriptures originate from the Predynastic Period as far back as before 10,000 B.C. based on the esoteric chronology of Greek historian Herodotus and Egyptian historian Manethos, both trained by the School of On (Annu) and who wrote respectively about 460 B.C. and 300 B.C.
Specifically, during the Dynastic Period the corrupt Theban Sorcery Lodge priests and priestesses were the theocratic rivals of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu), becoming increasingly more powerful and wealthy under the “Theban Influenced
Pharaohs” of the 18 th Dynasty. Thus circa 1570 thru 1330 B.C the Theban Sorcery Lodges produced the Egyptian Book of the Dead by mixing their demonic occult writings with the
Sacred Scriptures of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) including those presented in Chapter Six. As a consequence the 18 th Dynasty witnessed the holistically
brilliant but failed attempt by the “Aten Path” Master and Pharaoh Akhenaton (Ikhnaton) to continue what his Co-Regent father Pharaoh Amenhotep III and Queen Tiy began __ the limitation of the corruption and power of the Theban Sorcery Lodges.
The Theban Sorcery Lodges sold copies of their Book of the Dead to prominent Egyptians promising false “Salvation of Their Soul” upon death regardless of their having entered or completed the esoteric Science of Spirituality System (Salvation of the Soul through Deification While Alive ). Called the “Aten Path” as part of the priest and priestess training by the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu); the Theban Sorcery Lodges antithetically offered the false spiritism/spiritualism doctrines of body resurrection and materialism based on mummification through its demonic Amen-Ra and Osiris-Isis cults.
The “Aten Path” was the esoteric “Spirituality System of Salvation of the Soul through Deification While Alive”, and was the core of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu). As Light and Sound (Surat Shabd) Yoga Master Sant Kirpal Singh Ji brilliantly noted in Naam or Word page 38, the “Aten Path” brought to the public of Ancient Egypt/Kemit by Pharaoh Akhenaton is identical to modern Surat Shabd Yoga.
Please study herein Chapter Five the nine doctrines and Appendix I-A the INTRODUCTION TO SPIRITUALITY SYSTEM DOCTRINE STANDARD to appreciate this identity. With the destruction of Ancient Egypt/Kemit conventional Egyptologists have incorrectly confounded, confused and continued the inclusion of the “Aten Path” spirituality mystic writings of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) with the spiritism/spirtualism sorcery “spells” of the Theban Sorcery Lodge Priests who constituted the Amen-Ra and Osiris-Isis Cults found on papyri in the tombs of prominent Egyptians.
The first Egyptologist Jean-Francois Champollion first deciphered the Ancient Egypt/Kemit Hieroglyphics on the Rosetta Stone; and first distinquished and recognized the Science of Spirituality of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) mystic writings. About 1834 he compiled and translated them under the name La Manifestation’ a La Lumiere, or "The
Manifestation of the Light”, a title contained in these Sacred Scriptures. However he died mysteriously soon after this book’s publication, ignored and unavailable in English ever since.
In a now obvious move to keep the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) spirituality mystic writings from the “missing” Books of Thoth from being promulgated:
1) the entire group of writings by the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) and the Theban Sorcery Lodge Amen-Ra and Osiris-Isis Cults were combined
together and published incorrectly entitled Chapters of Coming Forth by Day: The Full Theban Recension of The Book of the Dead, translated and edited by E. Wallis Budge, last published in 1910, and not promulgated; and

INTRODUCTION (continued)
2) an abridged group of Chapters largely from the Theban Sorcery Lodge AmenRa and Osiris Cults was published negatively entitled The Book of the Dead edited by Wallis Budge, which has been continuously periodically published in 2 editions and thus greatly promulgated.
Not being promulgated the source hieroglyphics of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) spirituality mystic writings are hard to get and thus study.
Subsequently, Chapter Six embodies the first blessing of the ongoing effort to properly translate from the Ancient Egypt/Kemit Hieroglyphics of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) esoteric writings dealing with the Schools’ “System of Salvation of the Soul”; i.e. Reu en Pert em RaHeru em Netherkhert or ”Chapters for the Manifestation of the Inner Sun Light of the Spiritual Regions.”
Included also in EXHIBITS PART III:: EGYPTOLOGY: DYNASTIC GRAPHIC DOCUMENT HISTORY OF AND REFERENCES TO THE ATEN PATH OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MYSTERY “SCHOOL OF ON (ANNU) are some short references from the source Hieroglyphics of Pharaoh lkhnaton\Akhenaten’s “Path of the Aten” reign of the 18th Dynasty (circa 1360 B,C.). These documents and Aten Path references show this path of spirituality was not new but an esoteric aboriginal spiritual tradition of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu). Specifically notice the compound ideographic Hieroglyph of the “Aten Path” symbolizing the most profound cosmogonic and cosmographic knowledge is shown on EXHIBIT III_F-1_2 and elsewhere herein!
The Ancient Egypt/Kemit Hieroglyphic writing was a secret writing system of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu). The necessary contextual spirituality theory and knowledge is based on Initiation into the identical mysticism of the Light and Sound (Surat Shabd) Yoga; upon the extensive writings on comparative religion and spirituality of the Masters of Light and Sound (Surat Shabd) Yoga; i.e. Swami Ji, Sant Kirpal Singh Ji, and Darshan Singh Ji; and upon the comparative history, philosophy, religion and spirituality classic of Professor George James’ Stolen Legacy. In the future volume of this on-going work, source Hieroglyphics and transliterations will be issued for the serious students of Atannuology, Egyptology and Rastafariology; including other mystic writings of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) and hymns and prayers of Pharaoh Akhenaten’s “Aten Path” reign.
The reader of this volume will easily see the astonishing identity of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) “Path of Atannu (Aten\7)” with the modern Light and Sound (Surat Shabd) Yoga. The reader will quickly grasp that as Sant Kirpal Singh Ji declared, Pharaoh Ikhnaton (Akhenaten/Aakhunaten) was a Master of the Light and Sound (Surat Shabd) Yoga identical “Path of the Aten”; and that his so-called unique “monotheistic reign” was simply a later 1370 B.C. public ministering of the aboriginal Science of Spirituality system of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu). See Appendix V for more detail.
That these Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) mystic scriptures were compiled by the Masters and “Initiated” disciples of the aboriginal “Path of the (Aten\7) Atannu” is not debatable. Circa 10,000 B.C is the time esoterically for the writings of Spiritual Scripture D Chapter 64a translated partly herein. That these mystic scriptures were complied within the black African Anu Peoples Nile River Valley Annu Culture originating aboriginally in Central Africa is documented herein. In the Predynastic Period these writings were composed by the Anu Peoples who lived along the entire Nile River Valley; and who had cultural and religious allies called the “Nine Bow Nations” along the Jordan, Tigris and Euphrates River Valleys; i.e the Biblical Garden of Eden\Aten.
A systematic cover up and falsification of history and artifacts has been perpetrated by the Theban Sorcery Lodges, the corrupt rivals of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School on On (Annu) who dominated the Theocracy of Ancient Egypt/Kemit after the reign of Pharaoh Akhenaten at the close of the 18 th Dynasty.

Introduction (continued)
falsification continues with the subsequent rulers and various conquerors of Dynastic and Post-Dynastic Egypt/Kemit to keep the black African Anu People and their “rainbow” colored “Nine Bow Nation” contribution to ancient Egypt/Kemit’s great civilization hidden.
Esoterically this is when Pharaoh lkhnaton\Akhenaten the last simultaneous Annu King and Aten Path Master set on the throne of Ancient Egypt/Kemit and the n was driven out into Palestine and Syria after a long, bitter civil war. Thus Pharaoh lkhnaton\Akhenaten’s subsequent actions are known in history as those of Moses.
That Moses and Pharaoh Akhenaten were one and the same person in history was first presented in our 1986 issuance Esoteric Atannuology, Egyptology and Rastafariology, V. I the precurser to this 2004 “Limited Edition” of The Egyptian Mystery “School of On (Annu)”: Esoteric Atannuology. Egyptology and Rastafariology. Refer to Chapter Seven POEM #7D and POEM #7E and Appendice V.
It has come to our attention that noted Bible Scholar and Egyptologist Ahmed Osman specializing in the area of converging Biblical history with the history of Ancient Egypt/Kemit and Ancient Israel (Stranger in the Valley of Kings, Out of Egypt and The House of he Messiah) in 1990 published a book entilted Moses and Akhenaten: The Secret History of Egypt at the Time of the Exodus in which he declares:
“This book is an attempt take further the story told in the Stranger in the Valley of the Kings by demons trating that Moses is to be regarded as the Pharaoh Akhenaten.” (Ahmed Osman, Moses and Akhenaten, p. 3
A 2005 “Limited Edition” of The Egyptian Mystery “School of On (Annu)”: Esoteric Atannuology. Egyptology and Rastafariology will be issued fully addressing the detail, implications and integration of Osman Ahmed’s Moses and Akhenaten: The Secret History of Egypt at the Time of the Exodus . In addition it will address Douglas Reed’s The Controversy of Zion (1978) which 1.) uncovers the tribe of Judah’s practices of infanticide sacrifices to Ammon/Baal/Molloch and why the Old Testament nation of Israel refused to join Judah, 2.) explains the “abominations” of the Hyksos invaders of Ancient Egypt/Kemit cited by Pharaoh Queen Hatshepsut in her burial temple at Deir el Bahari, and 3.) sheds further light on why Pharaoh Akhenaten shut down the Amen-Ra Priest Temples.
Consequently, the motivation to develop this work and its paramount objective is to identify and expose the racial, political and religious rationalizations for the systemic exploitation of
the black African Anu People before and especially since 1350 B.C. The ramifications of the world’s people having these Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) scriptures are vitally important to their and the world’s salvation as follows:
1) Black, Red, Brown and mixed race people will have access to their ancestors
Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) mystic scriptures and be
motivated to seek its modern counterpart, the Light and Sound (Surat Shabd) Yoga
because the four black African (4 ) Anu Peoples practiced the Aten Path; and
2.) The knowledge of Black Africa’s mystic and cultural contributions to Ancient Egypt/Kemit and Western civilization and the defalsification of history and thus education is required for WORLD PEACE! This is the concern of Chapter Seven: Golden Ages Knowledge Poetry.

THE EGYPTIAN MYSTERY “SCHOOL OF ON” (ANNU):
ESOTERIC ATANNUOLOGY, EGYPTOLOGY & RASTAFARIOLOGY
CHAPTER ONE: SECRETS OF ANCIENT EGYPT/KEMIT
A. ANCIENT EGYPT/KEMIT WAS BLACK AFRICA DERIVED
Since the premature death at 42 years of age of its founder Jean-Francois Champollion (1790-1842), conventional Egyptologists have covered up and ignored the truth about Ancient Egypt/Kemit's chronology and history, culture, technology and spirituality. For example although geographically Ancient Egypt/Kemit proper (Nile River portion without cataracts) is part of the African Continent, the study of Ancient Egypt/Kemit is taught as an Asian or Oriental Culture and Civilization in the world's mainstream universities, colleges, secondary and elementary schools.
A major breakthrough in defalsifying Ancient Egypt/Kemit occurred under the auspices of the United Nations. In 1982 escaping virtual house arrest in Senegal Africa, Black African
Senegelese Nuclear Physicist Professor and Egyptologist Chekh Anka Diop who wrote African Origin of Civilization: Myth or Reality, 1974 came to the U.N. in New York City. From there he challenged the world's Egyptologists to disprove his premise that black African
Cultures and languages were the foundation of Ancient Egypt/Kemit's civilization and hieroglyphic based aggregate language. Chekh Anka Diop received no challenges to his premise from the world's community of Egyptologists. The United Nations is thus supporting the development of a "corrected" history and education defalsifying Ancient Egypt/Kemit and black Africa's contributions to Western civilization.
Consequently this book continues Chekh Anka Diop's work of defalsifying black Africa’s contributions to Ancient Egypt/Kemit of which it was an integral part and consequently black Africa’s contribution to Western civilization by :
a.) recognizing the earlier contributions of white French Egyptologist Abe'
Emile Amelineau who in his books Novellas Foulest d"Abydos (1899) and Prolenomenesta Itetude de la religion egyptienne (1916) cited by Chekh Anka Diop in his African Origin of Civilization: Myth or Reality, first identified the black African peoples of the Nile River Valley the Anu Peoples as the aboriginal peoples of Ancient Egypt/Kemit;
b.) merging the similar work of George James in Stolen Legacy (1978) which described the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) in great detail, proving that Ancient Greece's civilization was derived from Ancient Egypt/Kemit; and
c.) expanding it upon a multi-disciplinary foundation of comparative religion, comparative history, political economics, experimental/developmental anthropology and General Systems Theory.
Ironically in the modern world rampant with fascism including racism against black Africans, below is presented the irrefutable evidence first brought forward by Amelineau, Diop and James that the Civilization of Ancient Egypt/Kemit was founded upon four black African tribes (Nubians, Kush, Meroe and Anu Antiu) collectively called the "Anu" People.

GRAPHIC 1.0
TERA NETER'S TILE MONUMENT: (FROM ABYDOS II, FLINDERS PETRIE, PLATE I, "ABYDOS TEMPLE"- GLAZED POTTERY M69)
GRAPHIC 1.0 above is "Tera Neter's Tile" the Ancient Egypt/Kemit Hieroglyph and illustrated artifact that dates back to Predynastic Ancient Egypt/Kemit circa 5,000 B.C. Ironically it was discovered by British Egyptologist Flinders Petrie at the Abydos Predynastic burial grounds. Petrie took over at Abydos from French Egyptologist Abbe' Emile Amelineau, who had been dismissed for his "Black African Anu Peoples were the Aboriginal founders of Ancient Egypt/Kemit theory.” It is Ironic because this Tera Neter Tile proves Amelineau’s Anu theory.
It is part of the FIRST DISCOVERY by BRCA'S Chronic Poverty Research & Development Into the Ancient Civilization Of Egypt/Kemit. The Tera Neter Tile simultaneously identifies the earliest people of Ancient Egypt/Kemit as the aboriginal black African "Anu" in specific Hieroglyphics as Flinders Petrie acknowledges, and demonstrates that the black African "Anu" used Hieroglyphic writing in the Predynastic period. The translation of the Tera NeterTile's Hieroglyphics indicates the man is named "Tera Neter" and that he is an "Annu Priest" of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) from the black African Anu People country of aNubia. For complete details on GRAPHIC 1.0 see EXHIBIT I_E-1_2.
Herein the objective study of esoteric Predynastic Ancient Egypt/Kemit is termed “Atannuology", as opposed to the study of Dynastic Ancient Egypt/Kemit termed ”Egyptology.” Predynastic Ancient Egypt/Kemit and Dynastic Ancient Egypt/Kemit are plagued by falsification through deception, vandalism of key artifacts and out right cover-up. The falsification began in Pharaoh Akhenaten’s 18th Dynasty Reign in Ancient Egypt/Kemit and continues to this very day.
This falsification has its roots in the rivalry of the corrupt Theban Sorcery Lodges founded by the Theban Invader Peoples with the aboriginal Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On
(Annu) and is motivated by their jealousy of the great antiquity and achievements of the black African Anu Peoples founded Ancient Egypt/Kemit Civilization. Today this falsification is
continued by the fascist rivals of the principles of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu), and feeds upon the racism against the black African Anu Peoples and their descendants who were the founders and guardians of Ancient Egypt/Kemit.
B. UNDERSTANDING THE SECRETS OF ANCIENT EGYPT/KEMIT
This defalsifying of Ancient Egypt/Kemit is possible now because the predicted time has arrived for Understanding the Secrets Of Ancient Egypt/Kemit Civilization, the most mysterious and marvelous civilization of written history. Ancient Egypt/Kemit's true legacy of immense prosperity and wealth devoid of poverty, institutional stability and astonishing engineering feats over an unbelievable longevity of millenniums of years is now being revealed, understood and appreciated. Thus the value of defalsifying Ancient Egypt/Kemit is not simply an intellectual or black African racial self-esteem one alone. Understanding the Secrets Of Ancient Egypt/Kemit is a prerequisite to help planet Earth evolve from its present inhuman "Iron Age" milieu of chaos based upon the Malthusian "Mentality of Scarcity" and the continual Darwinian struggle of "the Survival of the Fittest" and ruled over by atheistic “reductionist pseudo-science” specialists.

This Understanding the Secrets of Ancient Egypt/Kemit is a prerequisite for the long
awaited manifestation on planet Earth of a human assisted and maintained "Golden Age";
resplendent with a Garden of Eden "Mentality and Reality of Prosperity and Wealth", and "Golden Rule Peace" of "Treat all things as if they were part of oneself" designated herein as General Systems Theory (GST). In defalsifying and uncovering the Secrets Of Ancient Egypt/Kemit the world's "cancer" of Chronic Poverty and its causes of inhuman fascism and related racism, and its symptoms of bigotry, civil and national wars, economic exploitation and depravation, organized and unorganized crime, dehumanizing jails and prisons, environmental degradation, individual and family dysfunction and violence, disease and pestilence, malnutrition, hunger and starvation can be significantly and quickly reduced to a memory in our lifetimes. The alternative health movement is a clear sign of this change.
The most significant and best covered up Secret of Ancient Egypt/Kemit to be primarily addressed herein is however cited right in the Bible Genesis 41: 45, 50 and 46: 20 and is the esoteric and mysterious “School of On (Annu)”.
C. EGYPTIAN MYSTERY SCHOOL OF ON AND ITS GREAT PYRAMID COMPLEX AT GIZA
The most famous and controversial Royal couple in Ancient Egypt/Kemit are undoubtedly Pharaoh-High Priest Akhenaton And Queen-High Priestess Nefertiti.
GRAPHIC 1.1

GRAPHIC 1.1 above shows Eighteenth Dynasty Pharaoh-High Priest Akhenaton and Queen-High Priestess Nefertiti in worship of the “Aten” before the "Tree of Life". Their worship of the "Aten Path" making it the top theocratic religion of their short reign is celebrated as the occasion of the world's first monotheistic social religion. In truth they were just practicing the aboriginal and previously secret (esoteric) Science of Spirituality System of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) in the open as if a social religion.
GRAPHIC 1.1 is the most profound artifact of Ancient Egypt/Kemit, surviving and coming to light after being buried as a tomb wall painting for over 3,000 years. A complete reading of this book fully uncovers GRAPHIC 1.1's portent for ending Chronic Poverty on Earth through prosperity, peace, equality and salvation for all the world's life forms.

GRAPHIC 1.2 above shows the marvelous and perplexing Ancient Egyptian Giza Plateau Complex from a southeast aerial view. The whole Giza Plateau Complex was the main University of Theocratic Education Campus and Aten Path Spirituality Initiation Center of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu); which trained amongst others Vizier
Imhotep (Father of Herbology), Pharaoh-Queen Hatshepsut, Pharaoh Thuthmoses IV, Pharaoh Akhenaton and Queen Nefertiti, Joseph, Moses, Pythagoras, Solon, Socrates, Herodotus and Manethos.

GIZA PLATEAU COMPLEX EAST VIEW SHOWING SPHINX ROCK SCULPTURE AND “SECOND PYRAMID” (KHEFERE)
GRAPHIC 1.3 above shows the Sphinx Rock Sculpture and the Second Pyramid from the east view of the Giza Plateau Complex. A significant defalsification of Ancient Egypt/Kemit's Chronology surfaced in 1992 with the publishing of Geologist Robert M.
Schoch's article "A Modern Riddle Of The Sphinx" Article in Omni Magazine, August
1992 Issue. The Robert Schoch article was followed in 1993 by his collaborator, writer John A. West's Article "Civilization Rethought" in Conde Nast Traveler Magazine, February 1993 Issue. Their conclusion is that the Sphinx Rock Sculpture was carved between 5,000 to 7,000 BC and not 2,500 BC as conventional Egyptology promulgates. The realization that the civilization of Ancient Egypt/Kemit is much older than taught conventionally is crucial to
its proper understanding; i.e. to believe the Mesopotamian Culture to be older is ludicrous but commonly held. For more detail see EXHIBIT I_C_1.
THE EGYPTIAN MYSTERY “SCHOOL OF ON”, VOL. BY GEORGE SINGLETON, ENLIGHTENMENT PUBLICATIONS, 2003 EDITION

That Ancient Egypt/Kemit is more ancient than conventionally taught is just what the historians of Ancient Egypt/Kemit wrote about its chronology and history. Graham Hancock And Robert Bauval in The Message Of The Sphinx: A Quest For The Hidden Legacy Of Mankind (Crown Publishers, Inc, NY, 1996) examine this older chronological history
argument better than any other book to date. They conclude that the Giza Plateau Complex dates to 10,500 BC as many records and monuments of Ancient Egypt/Kemit and its peers document. See EXHIBIT I_D-1, EXHIBIT I_D-2, EXHIBIT I_D-3 and EXHIBIT I_D-4-1.

GRAPHIC 1.5 above shows the north view of the little known and astonishingly engineered Sphinx "Monolithic" Temple in the foreground, and the more massive and fantastically engineered Sphinx "Entrance" Temple in the background. See EXHIBIT I_C-5_1 for more detail on the fantastic engineering achievements of the Sphinx “Monolithic” and Sphinx “Valley” Temples which to this day surpass the 3 Great Pyramids in unexplained engineering awe.

Please note that the stone building-lifting limit of modern era civil engineering is limited to 40 tons. Yet the Giza Plateau Complex constructed by the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) of the 3 Great Pyramids, the Sphinx Rock Sculpture, the Sphinx "Monolithic" Temple and the Sphinx Valley "Entrance" Temple involved the cutting,
moving and lifting of immensely heavy stones into precise positions weighing more and more beyond the modern civil engineering 40 ton the stone building-lifting limit in such tight space involving such precision maneuvers!
Specifically the heaviest stones from the Great Pyramid weigh 60 tons, the heaviest stones of the Sphinx "Monolithic" Temple weigh 80 tons, and the heaviest stones of the Sphinx Valley "Entrance" Temple weigh an unbelievable 200 tons! It is not known how the technology of
Ancient Egypt/Kemit accomplished these stone lifts beyond the stone building-lifting limit.
Contrary to the depictions in popular Hollywood Movie Mythology; e.g. in the movie "Stargate" in 1993, the Giza Plateau Complex stones were not lifted by space aliens nor dragged by slaves up ramps. They were lifted by the advanced meta-engineering technology of the HU-man beings trained by the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) during the historical period the Ancient Egyptians themselves called the Dynasties of the "Gods" and "Demi-Gods". These “HU-man Gods and Demi-Gods” were the most advanced of the Sun People.
Consequently, you can see why a major focus in the research and development of this book has been on how Ancient Egypt/Kemit avoided Chronic Poverty. In particular the paramount question is with what necessarily “sustainable” economic production and distribution enterprise systems did Ancient Egypt/Kemit generate the required enormous prosperity assets to pay for such unparalleled and esoteric engineering achievements as the Great Pyramid, the Sphinx Rock Sculpture, the Sphinx "Monolithic" Temple and the Sphinx "Entrance" Temple at the Giza Plateau Complex?
D. THE GREAT PYRAMID'S IRON PLATE
GRAPHIC 1.6
THE GREAT PYRAMID IRON PLATE REPORTEDLY DYNAMITED OUT OF THE GREAT PYRAMID'S SOUTH AIR SHAFT BY THE BRITISH COLONEL VYSE EXPEDITION IN 1836, WAS COVERED UP IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM UNTIL 1989 WHEN IT WAS FINALLY ANALYZED AND FOUND TO BE MADE OF MINED IRON ORE, ONCE GOLD PLATED AND VERY OLD (FROM HANCOCK AND BAUVAL, THE MESSAGE OF THE SPHINX , 1996)
GRAPHIC 1.6 above shows the Great Pyramid Iron Plate (one eighth of an inch thick, a foot long and four inches wide), a glaring example of the falsification and cover-up surrounding Ancient Egypt/Kemit. It was found in 1836 when the "highly respected" British Colonel Vyse's archaeological team dynamited the south side air vent of the Great
Pyramid in Egypt to gain entrance. Colonel Vyse's Team is "highly respected" because it is Vyse who also found on this same expedition the "proof positive" that the Great
Pyramid was built by Forth Dynasty Pharaoh Khufu. Colonel Vyse's Team found the only Ancient Egypt/Kemit Hieroglyphic writing in the Great Pyramid painted in the stress vaults above the Great Pyramid King's Chamber rock quarry marks including the painted name of Pharaoh Khufu in Ancient Egypt/Kemit Cursive Hieroglyphics.
THE EGYPTIAN MYSTERY “SCHOOL OF ON”, VOL. BY GEORGE SINGLETON, ENLIGHTENMENT PUBLICATIONS, 2003 EDITION

Suspiciously, although Colonel Vyse Team's "discovery" of Pharaoh Khufu's name in painted Cursive Hieroglyphs in the Great Pyramid is accepted by the conventional Egyptologists because it fits their shortened chronology of Ancient Egypt/Kemit; the Colonel Vyse Team's discovery of the Great Pyramid Iron Plate is considered a hoax because this can not be fitted into Conventional Egyptology’s "shortened chronology" of Ancient Egypt/Kemit.
Consequently and astonishingly the Great Pyramid Iron Plate was stored in a drawer in the British Museum in London beginning in 1837. Forty four (45) years later in 1881
conventional British Egyptologist Flinders Petrie examined the Great Pyramid Iron Plate and honestly and correctly observed:
"THOUGH SOME DOUBT HAS BEEN THROWN ON THE PIECE, MERELY FROM ITS RARITY, [HE NOTED] YET THE VOUCHERS FOR IT ARE VERY PRECISE; AND IT HAS A CAST OF A NUMMULITE [FOSSILIZED MARINE PROTOZOA] ON THE RUST OF IT, PROVING IT TO HAVE BEEN BURIED FOR AGES BESIDE A BLOCK OF NUMMILITE LIMESTONE, AND THEREFORE TO BE CERTAINLY ANCIENT. NO DOUBT CAN THEREFORE EXIST ABOUT ITS BEING A REALLY GENUINE PIECE...." (FLINDERS PETRIE, THE PYRAMIDS AND TEMPLES OF GIZA, LEADENHALL PRESS, LONDON, 1883, PP 212-213) (EMPHASIS ADDED) (FROM HANCOCK AND BAUVAL, THE MESSAGE OF THE SPHINX, 1996).
Yet it was not for another 108 years that a full metallurgical analysis of the Great Pyramid Iron Plate was conducted in 1989 by El Sayed El Gayer and M.P. Jones. Their professional
scientific analysis "Metallurgical Investigation of an Iron Plate Found in The Great Pyramid at
Gizeh, Egypt" was published in The Journal of The Metallurgical Society, Vol. XXIII (1989)
pp. 75-83. They determined as reported in Hancock And Bauval, The Message Of The
Sphinx , 1996 that the Great Pyramid Iron Plate was made from mined iron ore and not from a meteor, was of great age, had been incorporated within the Great Pyramid when it was constructed and had probably been covered on one side with gold.
Note that Greek historian Herodotus wrote in his History that when he visited the Great Pyramid circa 425 BC that it had a gold covered cap stone that could be seen glistening from miles away. According to Charles Finch, MD. The Star of the Beginings, page 49 the Great Pyramid’s cap stone was probably covered with the glistening gold and silver alloy called “electrum.” Nevertheless conventional Egyptologists hypocritically still consider the once gold plated Great Pyramid Iron Plate a hoax by the British Colonel Vyse and his
archeological team; and yet whole heartedly accept the Vyse team's finding in the Great Pyramid of Pharaoh Khufu's name in cursive hieroglyph red paint as authentic proof he built it.
To accept the Great Pyramid Iron Plate as part of the Great Pyramid would force conventional Egyptology to move its Iron Age calculation for Ancient Egypt/Kemit back from 650 BC to 2,650 BC. That would converge the Iron Age with the Pyramid Age of Ancient Egypt/Kemit, and this could not be explained easily by conventional Egyptologists. Thus the motivation for the falsification and cover-up of the Great Pyramid Iron Plate is clear. The conclusion would be that as a prerequisite earlier development the black African Anu Peoples had mastered iron and gold smelting and fabrication in the Pre-Dynastic Period as clearly the archaeological evidence in Nubia, Kush, Meroe and Khenthunnefer substantiate.
The book Charles Finch, MD. The Star of the Beginings: The Genesis of African Science and Technology (Khenti Inc., Decatur, GA., 1998) substantiates this and is recommended reading for all those students of Ancient Egypt/Kemit. It’s excellent
Chapter 2 “The Followers of Horus: 40,000 Years of African Mining and Metal Technology” proves the predynastic black African Anu Peoples indeed mastered iron and gold smelting. He identifies the Predynastic “Followers of Horus” who we know as also associated with Thoth who founded the “School of On” as the source of this metallurgical knowledge.
Ironically and oddly both Charles Finch and his venerable mentor Chek Anka Diop both of black African descent fail to recognize and support the full significance of the Great Pyramid Iron Plate because of the preponderance of conventional Egyptologists, other historians and scientists who dismiss it today as a later stone cutting tool that was left behind by stone robbers! Fortunately the white writers Hancock and Bauval in their revelational The Message Of The Sphinx , 1996 expose this falsification and coverup of the Great Pyramid Iron.

THE EGYPTIAN MYSTERY “SCHOOL OF ON” (ANNU):
ESOTERIC ATANNUOLOGY, EGYPTOLOGY & RASTAFARIOLOGY
CHAPTER TWO: CHRONOLOGY AND ORIGIN
A. THE FANTASTIC ANTIQUITY OF EGYPT/KEMIT
Both the "Greek Father of History" Herodotus (circa 484 to 420 BC.) and Egyptian Annu High Priest historian Manethos (circa 300 BC.) were taught by the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) studying from the school's now “missing” 42 Books of Thoth. Herodotus and
Manethos both were taught and wrote that Ancient Egypt/Kemit’s age challenged human imagination: They were taught that dating back to well before 30,000 B.C. were the "Dynasty of the Gods" and then the succeeding "Dynasty of the Demigods.” They also were taught that the "Dynastic-Human" Period in which they lived started at circa 9,000 BC.
What will be made clear by the close of this Chapter is that the Dynasties of the Gods and Demigods were dominated by the "so-called" stone age black African Anu Peoples (4 distinct
Tribes) living along the entire course of the Nile River. This was followed by the relatively brief and
confusing Predynastic-Human Period characterized by the Theban Invader Peoples and
resulting Horus-Seth War. The Annu Pharaoh named Menes/Narmer with Souls of Annu
including the Shemsu-Hor Blacksmiths started the Dynasty of the Humans by settling this War, reuniting Ancient Egypt/Kemit and allowing the Dark-Red Dynastic Race People to remain.
Plato is considered the "Greek Father of Philosophy". Plato himself had been taught by the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) and/or its alumni including his most famous teacher Athenian Greek Philosopher Socrates. Plato described in his Timaeus (or Time) Essay that the Greek student and later Athenian Greek politician Solon was taught by his Priest teachers of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of Annu (On) that the Ancient Egyptians and Greeks were contemporaries and allied war adversaries of the Legendary “Lost Continent” of Poseidon Atlantis at approximately 10,000 B.C. Such fantastic chronology associated with Ancient Egypt/Kemit would help explain the recent 1992-93 scientific studies by Schoch and West that push back the construction date of the Sphinx Rock Sculpture at Giza from 2,400 BC. to between 5,000 and 10,000 B.C. respectively. Again only the "so-called" stone age black African Anu Peoples of 4 distinct Tribes/Nations lived in the Nile River Valley then.
1. QUATERNARY PERIOD’S PLEISTOCENE EPOCH (circa 1,600,000 to 40,000 BC.)
From 1,600,000 to 40,000 BC. during the geological Quaternary Period’s Pleistocene Epoch a succession of glacial and interglacial climatic cycles took place at the earth’s high latitudes close to its Artic and Antarctic circles; while increased rain fall and hydrological changes from flooding occurred at the earth’s middle and lower latitudes including the area of Egypt/Kemit proper. The fertile land of historical Egypt/Kemit proper and the historical Nile River extending from the Great Lakes to the Mediterranean Sea were incomplete at this time.
During the geological Quaternary Period’s Pleistocene Epoch a Gulf of the Mediterranean Sea covered most of the area of Egypt/Kemit proper with sea water up to the first cataract at Abu/Elephantine/Aswan. The historical or United Nile River was still not yet completely developed at this time being separated into two shorter rivers. The Nile’s (northern) lower portion had headwaters from the East African Ethiopian Plateau flowing into Lake Tana from which flowed the Blue Nile flowing northwest to its mouth on the Mediterranean Sea Gulf at Abu/Elephantine/Aswan. The Nile’s (southern) upper portion had Central African headwaters flowing into the immense Lake Victoria with its water flowing north into the huge drainage system of the Sudan al Sudd Swamp and Lake Sudd enclosed without an outlet.
Specifically, the White Nile River of the historical or United Nile River had yet been formed.

2. THE “DYNASTY OF THE GODS” (circa 40,000 to 17,000 B C.)
During the close of the Quaternary Period’s Pleistocene Epoch (dated from 40,000 BC to 10,000 BC.) the formation of the White Nile River took place uniting the Nile’s (southern)
upper portion with the Nile’s (northern) lower portion. The resulting United Nile River then began silting the Mediterranean Sea Gulf submerged Egypt/Kemit Proper creating a Nile River Valley without cataracts with 35 feet of alluvial soil as the requisite foundation of a prosperous agricultural empire based on a water based transportation system.
Esoterically during circa 40,000 BC. to 25,000 BC. at the beginning of the “Dynasty of the Gods”; the United Nile River was formed through a divinely inspired spiritual and mystical geological and hydrological engineering “incident” assisted by the “gods”. These “gods” or
“Souls of Annu” included the “venerables of Memphis” and the Shemsu Horu or “Followers of Horus” and were the deified human priests and priestesses who founded the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu). They had inherited esoteric sustainable “metatechnologies” brought by immigrant priests from the Mystery School of Poseidon Atlantis ravaged by war, geological disturbances and floods. They undertook the awesome feat of astronomically and hydrologically designing and civil engineering the man made canal we call the White Nile River uniting the Nile’s (southern) upper portion with the Nile’s (northern) lower portion. The resulting United Nile River predictably floods annually at the helical rising of the fixed star Sirius (Sothis) irrigating the then non-arid horticultural lands of Egypt/Kemit Proper including the man made canal feeding the man made Lake Moeris and the horticultural lands of the nation of Meroe between the Blue Nile and Atbara Rivers and one of the Nine Bow Nation. Cited by Herodotus as the “Table of the Sun” this latter area is still today the site of the largest irrigated farming region in the world.
This “incident” combined the Nile River’s lower and upper portion’s into a United Nile River with the Sorbet River, the Blue Nile River, the Atbara River and the newly formed White Nile River as its major tributaries. Waters from the Central African Great Lakes including Lake Victoria which flows into the previously enclosed natural reservoir of the Sudan al Sudd Swamp and Lake Sudd are provided with an outlet ___ the 500 mile long, shallow, wide, and gently sloping White Nile River. The White Nile River will supply 80% of the United Nile
River’s water outside the flood season. Lake Sudd disappears until the annual monsoon rain season when it floods the Blue Nile River right up to the White Nile River.
From about 25,000 BC. to 20,000 BC. this United Nile River began to form the historical cataract free Nile River Valley flood plain of Egypt/Kemit Proper by silting up the
Mediterranean Sea Gulf with black alluvial soil that had previously covered Egypt/Kemit Proper from its old mouth at the first cataract at Abu/Elephantine/Aswan to its new mouth just north of where the city of Memphis would be located. Most of this silt came from the Blue Nile and Atbara Nile Rivers from the monsoon rain season flooding eroding soil from the Ethiopian Highland Plateau. Note that the Nile River Delta was not formed during this “incident.”
“I hold that where now is Egypt there was once another gulf [similar to the red sea]; one entered from the northern [Mediterranean] Sea towards Aethiopia ... now if the Nile choose to turn his waters into this Gulf, what hinders that it be not silted up by his stream in 20,000 years/ nay, I think 10,000 years would suffice for it. Is it then to be believed that in the ages before my birth a Gulf ..... Could not be silted up by a river so great and so busy?”
“Therefore, as to Egypt, I believe those [Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) Priests] who so speak, and I am myself so persuaded; for I have seen that Egypt projects into the Sea beyond the neighboring land, and shells are plain to view on the mountains and things are coated with salt (insomuch that the very Pyramids are wasted thereby), and the only sandy mountain in Egypt is that which is above Memphis; moreover Egypt is like neither to the neighboring land of Arabia, nor to Libya, no, nor to Syria (for the seaboard of Arabia is inhabited by Syrians); it is a land of black and crumbling earth, as if it were alluvial deposit carried downstream from Aethiopia; but we know the soil of Libya is redder and somewhat sandy, and Arabia and Syria are lands rather of clay and stones.” (from Herodotus, History, Book II, p. 11 and 12. (A. D. Godley translation) (emphasis added)
This” incident” produced the legendary fertile land of Egypt/Kemit Proper with a navigatable Nile River with no cataracts flowing through the center of a huge flat flood plain endowed with an average of 35 feet of black humus topsoil. This soil is only part alluvial being rich in organic matter and giant earthworms at a density of up to 3,000 earthworms per cubic foot of soil. Contrary to popular belief the Nile River Valley’s black humus topsoil is self-replenished from the “soil alchemy” of this high-density giant earthworm population and not from the annual Nile River flooding. Kemit the native traditional name for Ancient Egypt derives from the hieroglyphic transliteration kemi-ta or “land of the black soil” capable of awesome sustainable annual horticultural production.

“ The greatest of the early civilizations was doubtless that of the Egyptians, who developed a marvelously sophisticated culture and maintained it for four thousand years. The Egyptian experience alone is
strong indication that a complex civilization cannot develop until the basic agricultural needs of its people are met. There is little time to pursue art and philosophy until bellies are full.”
“The Nile Valley offered the richest agricultural land the world has ever known. ... the annual alluvial deposits are essential, to be sure, but without the extraordinary earthworm activity of the Nile Valley, even this rich soil would not be so lushly productive.”
“ A UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE REPORT OF 1949 STATED:
‘Investigations carried on in the valley of the white Nile in the Sudan indicate that the great fertility of the soil of this valley is due in large part to the work of earthworms. Observations are recorded from which it is estimated that the castings of earthworms on these soils during the six months of active growing season of the year amount to 239,580 pounds (119.79 tons) per acre.’ “
“ Consider, then, the annual incorporation of 120 tons per acre of high-grade organic fertilizer on Egypt’s agricultural fields. This is approximately ten times the amount of castings deposited on good American and European agricultural lands, and goes far in explaining the unparalleled fertility of the Nile Valley.” (from Jerry Minnich, The Earthworm Book, pg. xx ) (emphasis added)
Now predictably annually the United Nile River floods at the time of the helical rising of the fixed star Sirius which the Ancient Egyptians considered the “center of the universe.” See EXHIBIT I_D-4-3. The flood waters predominately originate from the Blue Nile and Atbara Rivers during the spring monsoon rains off the Ethiopian Plateau Highlands. The White Nile tributary of the United Nile River is then blocked at Khartoum Egypt and Lake Sudd temporarily forms again from the back up water. In the arid climate of Egypt/Kemit proper this annual flood water made it possible to irrigate vast horticultural land activities on the alluvial floodplains which had been finalized by 15,000 BC. from the first cataract at Abu/Elephantine/Aswan to the Mediterranean Sea just north of the city of Memphis.
3. THE “DYNASTY OF THE DEMI-GODS” (circa 17,000 to 8,000 B.C.)
During what the Ancient Egyptian trained historians Herodotus and Manethos and the Turin Papyrus called the “Dynasty of the Demi-Gods” circa 17,000 to 8,000 BC.; in Egypt/Kemit proper a theocratic educational institution for teaching the doctrines,
technologies and techniques required to establish and operate a theocratic and prosperous
society graduating Souls of Annu was started by the Shemsu-Hor Demi-God Thoth
(Tchuti/HU/Hermes). The Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) used the 42
Books of Thoth as its curriculum with two original Hieroglyphic copies in stone located at the major temple at the city of Annu of the North (On, Heliopolis) and the main school campus located at the Giza Plateau Complex both just northeast of the city of Memphis. This theocratic educational institution is cited in the Bible thousands of years later as the “School of On.” The city of Annu of the North was corrupted by the Hebrews in their Bible Old Testament as On or Avon (Aten) and by the Greeks as Heliopolis (“city of the sun”).
Ancient Egypt/Kemit Proper (that portion along the Nile River without cataracts) was divided by the Demi-God Thoth (Tchuti or Hu) into 42 theocratic states or Nomes each ruled by a theocratic king-high priest trained at the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On
(Annu). Each theocratic Nome or state was dedicated to an aspect of divine symbolism or totem Neter. Each theocratic Nome or state was the patron of a god or triad of gods with a Nome Temple so dedicated; was the guardian of one of the 42 Books of Thoth with its Nome Temple having a complete papyrus copy of that book and excerpted papyrus copy of the other 42 Books of Thoth; and had a theocratic capital administrative unit with housing the necessary theocratic bureaucracy. The Books of Thoth of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) included the required doctrines and technologies for a prosperous theocracy.
4. THE “DYNASTY OF THE HUMANS” (circa 8,000 to 60 BC.)
The “Dynasty of the Humans” as determined by the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) trained historians Herodotus and Manethos began circa 8,000 BC. in Egypt/Kemit proper. However, modern conventional Egyptology separates this period into the “Predynastic Period” and the “Dynastic Period”, with the First Pharaoh of the First Dynasty Pharaoh Menes who united Lower (Northern) Egypt/Kemit with Upper (Southern) Epypt/Kemit as the demarcation point.

B. TENTYRA TEMPLE CIRCULAR ZODIAC: RECORD THAT PLANET EARTH IS UPSIDE DOWN AND OFF-AXIS
GRAPHIC 2.0
TENTYRA TEMPLE CIRCULAR ZODIAC : RECORD OF 3 EARTH POLE SHIFTS (SCIENTIFIC AMERICA, SEPTEMBER 1994, PAGE 82)
GRAPHIC 2.0 above is the Tentyra Temple Circular Zodiac with the original 36 decans of the Ancient Egyptian/Kemitian astronomy and astrology, esoterically confirming Ancient Egypt/Kemit’s fantastic antiquity. The Ptolemic Greek Egyptian built monument was dynamite blasted from the roof of the Tentyra Temple in Upper Egypt/Kemit by the French Emperor
Napoleon's Scientific Expedition to Egypt and taken to the Louvre Museum in Paris, France. For more GRAPHIC 2.0 detail see EXHIBIT I_A-1 .
The initial orientation for a new student at the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) would have included an esoteric explanation of this thrice (3) concentric zodiac. Indeed Herodotus indicated in his History, Book II, page 142 that he received this very orientation as an ancient, being told by the Priests that in the past three (3) times the Planet Earth switched poles as reflected in each concentric zodiacal segment of the Tentyra Temple Circular
Zodiac.This means that presently planet earth is upside down, and is at least 20 degrees off-axis at any given time of the year in order to remain in orbit around the sun!
GRAPHIC 2.1
THIS DIAGRAM SHOWS EARTH'S MAGNETIC "ECLIPTIC" POLES OFF-AXIS FROM THE GEOGRAPHIC POLES OVER 20 DEGREES; CONTRARY TO OTHER PLANETS IN THE SUN'S SOLAR SYSTEM DISPLAYS A NEGATIVELY (-) CHARGED NORTH POLE, A POSITIVELY (+) CHARGED SOUTH POLE, AND COUNTER CLOCKWISE SPIN ESOTERICALLY EXPLAINED BY THE EARTH BEING UPSIDE DOWN AND OFF-AXIS.

GRAPHIC 2.1 above diagrams the iconoclastic "Earth topsy-turvey" reality that Planet Earth is upside down and off axis as revealed to Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) student Herodotus. The fact is that unlike any of the other 8 planets in the Solar System of the Sun; planet Earth's Magnetic North Pole is negatively (-) charged, Earth's Magnetic South Pole is positively (+) charged and Earth is rotating counter clockwise and off-axis over 20 degrees. This unnatural planetary Earth North Magnetic Pole negative (-) charge is continually demonstrated by the positively (+) charged end of a compass' suspended bar magnet arm always pointing towards the negatively (-) charged Earth North Magnetic Pole because oppositely magnetically charged objects attract each other. For more detail on the reality that Plant Earth is upside down and off axis including the “Tectonic Plate Theory” to attempt to explain away this reality see the Hecht article.
APPENDIX III-B presents the approximate times of these three (3) polar shifts recorded in the Tentyra Temple Circular Zodiac as at 3,500,000 B.C., 800,000 B.C. and 270,000 B.C.; and indicates that the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) had access to the constellation topographies of these fantastic antiquities and thus itself of great antiquity.
This in turn should lead to a new appreciation of the previously thought "defective" Solar
Calendar of Ancient Egypt/Kemit and its now recognized uncanny accuracy being based on the binary star Sirius (Sothis). It was composed of 360 days of 12 months, each month with exactly 30 days reflecting the aboriginal right side up and on axis Earth orbit and polar coordinates before it turned upside down and off-axis. Our modern solar calendar has a 365 day year, months from 28 to 31 days and the need every forth year for a 366 day "Leap Year" and 29 to 31 day months. This is caused by the Earth being upside down and offaxis having an unnatural faster planetary axis rotation speed but slower revolution speed around the Sun of 365.25 days changed from I original 360 days since becoming upside down and off axis.
C. THE FOUR RACES OF ANCIENT EGYPT/KEMIT
GRAPHIC 2.2
THE FOUR RACES OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIAN EMPIRE :: GEO-POLITICAL ECONOMICALLY COMPRISING THE "NINE BOW TRIBES" OF THE EGYPTIAN FEDERATION OF TRIBES (18 TH DYNASTY)
GRAPHIC 2.2 above indicates the ”4 Races Of Humans” recognized by Ancient Egypt/Kemit described below from right to left as follows:
1.) The First Race on the right facing right is the mysterious Dynastic Dark Red "Hamitic" People who invaded into the Nile River Valley in the late Predynastic-Demigod Period at about 10,000 B.C. called herein the Theban Invader People and ethnographically part of the Hamitic group.
They introduced mummification of the dead and the concept of body resurrection into Ancient Egypt/Kemit. They brought with them for the first time into Africa their cattle, horses, sheep, goats, hogs and other domesticated animals; which lead to the deforestation, desertification and ultimate fall of the Ancient Egyptian civilization. This race dominated much of the Ancient Egyptian Dynastic-Human Period. It includes the people of Sheba and Punt, which today dominate the modern countries of Ethiopia, Somalia and Eritria. A mixed blood people of Scythians and Asian Indian Dravidians.
2.) The Second Race from the right is the black African “Anu” People made up of four distinct Tribes of the aNubians, Kush, Meroe, and Anu Antiu; living respectively from the Delta to the Equatorial Great Lakes along the entire length of the Nile River.

Valley. Today they are predominately confined to Sub-Saharan Africa. French Egyptologist Abbe' Emile Amelineau first theorized in 1902 that this race was the aboriginal Ancient Egyptians which founded and dominated the Ancient Egyptian
Predynastic-Demigod Period, and parts of the Ancient Egyptian Dynastic-Human Period.
3.) The Third Race is the miscegenational tan colored Asia Minor "Semitic” People of mixed blood origins, including the Hebrews or the aboriginal 12 Tribes of Israel represented today by the sole surviving Tribe of the Jews, historically the identity of the mysterious Hyksos; and their ethnic cousins the aboriginal 12 Tribes of Ishmael today known as the Arabs all Biblically and ethnomythically originating from Abraham of “Ur of Chaldea a known Scythian derivative.
4.) The Fourth Race is the white Indo-European "Caucasians" including the barbarian
Scythians whose miscegenation derivatives continually invaded Ancient Egypt/Kemit.
For more detail on GRAPHIC 2.2 see EXHIBIT IV-1.
Surprisingly and frustratingly for all the world's racists against black African people is the uncovering of the truth that Ancient Egypt/Kemit's Second Race of the black African Anu People were the foundation of a prototypic cultured and multi-racial Ancient Egyptian Federation of Tribes during the Predynastic and Dynastic-Human Periods called the "Nine Bow Tribes".
D. THE “NINE BOW” EMPIRE OF ANCIENT EGYPT/KEMIT
Esoterically, the Ancient Egypt/Kemit Proper had been united as one country at the beginning of the Pre-Dynastic Period which is reflected in the myths of the Osris-Isis
Legends, the Horus verses Seth War Legends and the Shemsu Hor (Companions of Horus) references in the Turin Papyrus and other documents.
“Among the buildings of the Ancient Empire [of Third Dynasty of Ancient Egypt], mention must be made of the descending passageway connecting the pyramid of Unas situated on the plateau, with its ‘temple in the valley’. 38 [ footnote 38: All the pyramids
were constructed on the plateau and connected by a long causeway to a temple located in the valley.] ‘This
passageway, 666 meters long and 6 meters 70 wide, was entirely paved and its adjoining limestone walls were covered with magnificent bas-reliefs, representing all manner of religious, craft working, and agricultural scenes...... it was in the pyramid of Unas that the religious texts concerning afterlife, known as the Pyramid Texts, were first discovered, carved on the walls of interior chambers.” (from R.A. Schwaller De Lubicz, Sacred Science: The King Of Pharaonic Theocracy, Pg. 102)

“O great Ennead (9 Sun Gods and Goddesses) of the Temple School of On (literally ‘Temple School of the City of Annu of the North’) the Sun God Atum, Sun God Shu, Sun Goddess Tefnut, Sun God Geb, Sun Goddess Nut, Sun God Asar (misnomer Osiris), Sun Goddess Ast (misnomer Isis), Sun God Seth and Sun Goddess Nephthys ; which the Sun God Atum created by emanating them from itself, so the Nine Bow (Tribal Nations) were born as emanations from the Sun God Atum and can not be separated (from Ancient Egypt/Kemit Proper) ...”
This Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) sacred text from the Third Dynasty Pyramid Texts establishes the divine creation and maintenance of the Ancient Egyptian Federation of “Nine Bow” Tribal Nations’ crucial support role of Egypt/Kemit Proper.

GRAPHIC 2.4 is the 18 th Dynasty Wall Painting of the Ancient Egypt/Kemit Federation of Nine Bow Tribal Nations. Conventional Egyptologists consider these nations as held in bondage as shown by their hands tied behind their backs. Aboriginally, these Federation members paid tribute to the Annu Pharaoh of Egypt/Kemit Proper. See EXHIBIT IV-2.
From Right to left the “Nine Bow” Tribal Nations identified by hieroglyphs are:
I.) HITTIA (Caucasian/lonian Greek people living in the areas now known as Turkey);
2.) KUSH (part of aboriginal black African Anu Peoples of the Nile River cataract 3);
3.) MITTANI and NEHARRIA (2 mysterious and distinct peoples living together; the MITHRA ANNU people of the country of Mittanni of various mixtures of Asian Dravidian, black African and Ishmael Semitic peoples and the Neharrian (Harrian) people of a mixture of Caucasian and Asian Orientals; esoterically Mittanni joined the Upper Egyptians and ousted the Hyksos Invaders founding the 18 th Dynasty and furnishing the legendary 18 th Dynasty Queens including Queens Hatshepsut, Tiy and Nefertiti);
4.) MEROE (part of aboriginal black African Anu Peoples of the Nile River cataract 6);
5.) KEFT (Phoenicia and her coastal city states who thru the mercenary mysterious "Hyksos Shepherd Kings" (Israelite Semitic people) overran Lower Egypt for centuries until later ousted and enslaved in Egypt/Kemit by the founders of the 18 th Dynasty);
6.) ANU ANTIU (part of aboriginal black African Anu Peoples; of the legendary Ta Neter, “land of the gods”, Khenthunnefer identified partly today with the Dafur Province region of Sudan, Africa and the Nile River Central Great Lakes);
7.) LIBYA (including Carthage and pre-cursor of the later Spanish race);
8.) ANU SETHET ("Nubia”, black African Anu Peoples of the cataract less Nile River); and
9.) SHA ANSU ("Israelite" or Hebrew segment of the Semitic peoples including Jewish and Arabian Peoples of the Sinai, Palestine and Southern Mesopotamia).
Esoterically, a united Egypt/Kemit proper existed in the Predynastic Period and in addition was the center of a Federation of 9 Tribal Nations called the “Nine Bow” that helped secure its physical and financial theocratic security.

The Egyptian Federation of Tribal Nations or “Nine Bow” was the military and socio-political economic foundation of Egypt/Kemit Properof nine (9) multicultural, multi-racial tribal nations initially united by common bond to the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) and the wondrous civilization ofAncient Egypt/Kemit.
E. THE BLACK AFRICAN ANU PEOPLES
Sometime during the Predynastic-Human Period the Egyptian Federation of “Nine Bow”
Tribal Nations was implemented by and founded upon the backbone of the 4 Black African Anu Peoples. These Anu Peoples numbered right to left as they appear in the "Nine Bow Tribe" Wall Painting, EXHIBIT IV-2 and location specified along the Nile River Valley are as follows:
* as Nine Bow Tribe #2 the KUSH at Nile River cataracts #3 & #4;
* as Nine Bow Tribe #4 the MEROE at Nile River cataracts # 6 through #8, as “the
land island” between the Atbara and Blue Nile Rivers and northern most Lake Tana;
* as Nine Bow Tribe #6 the ANU ANTIU of Equatorial Africa Central Great Lakes; and
* as Nine Bow Tribe #8 the aNUBIANS from the Nile River Delta to cataract #1 of Egypt/Kemit proper and the Northern Sudan of today.
Esoterically these four (4) tribal nations were originally founded by the Ancient Egyptian
Mystery School Of On (Annu), and collectively operated as "ONE SUPRA-NATION UNDER THE GODHEAD ANNU”; each with a lead responsibility for maintaining a specialized "national security” function of safeguarding a key “Egyptian/Kemit Sacred Science and Annu
Cultural" element. This was carried out by SUN PEOPLE that served as the core that kept the Federation of Egypt/Kemit Proper operational for over 8,000 years through countless invasions, wars, civil wars and natural disasters as follows:
1.) the ANNU ANTIU (Great Lakes of Nile River); were aboriginal recipients of a.)
cosmogonic, cosmographic, cosmic-chronological and cosmic historical and b.) metasocio-political economic science, meta-physical science, meta-biological science, meta-spiritual and "HU-manistic” ontological knowledge via all 42 BOOKS of THOTH (HERMES) from the TWA PEOPLE [commonly called African Pygmy People who had migrated to Africa upon the successive destructive geological disturbances on the legendary island continent ATLANTIS]; surviving members known today as the DOGON”/DOGANU PEOPLE of Mali, Africa;
2.) the MEROE (cataracts 6 - 8 of the Nile River in Sudan including Lake Tana of SHEBA/Abyssinia today called Ethiopia) were the aboriginal recipients of metacommercial and economic science via the relevant 42 Books Of Thoth (Hermes)
from the Twa People maintaining a.) the largest Garden/Sustainable Agri-Forest in the world then called the "TABLE OF THE SUN” by HERODOTUS and its international commerce; and b.) producing and trading products to and from the other tribal nations and nations of the world via land route camel caravan and ocean route star map guided ships of the black Africans of Lake Tana in Southern Sudan and “lowlands” of Ethiopia;
3.) the KUSH (cataracts 3 & 4 of the Nile River. which ancient historians like Herodotus called “Ethiopia”, today called the Sudan) were the aboriginal
recipients of a.) meta-governmental, diplomatic and b.) military sciences via the relevant 42 Books Of Thoth (Hermes) from the Twa People; including having the best infantry and specialized troops, commanders, strategy and military hardware; today’s black Africans Fur People of Dafur Province, Sudan;
4.) the ANU SETHET or "aNubians” (Nile River Delta through cataracts 1 & 2 ) were the aboriginal recipients of the meta-spiritual. meta-educational and meta-cultural arts and sciences plus the balance of the 42 Books Of Thoth from the Twa People
including: a.) the establishment and security of the main temples and campus of the
Ancient Egyptian Mystery School Of On (Annu) and its Priesthood and
Priestesshood; b.) the protection and teaching of the School’s 42 curriculum Books Of Thoth and c.) operation of the largest Garden/Sustainable Agri-Forest in Ancient Egypt/Kemit Proper called Lake Moeris ;

c.) the operation of the esoteric Aten Path spirituality system; d.) the creation of a social religion based on the Sun God Ra and e.) maintenance of the Ancient
Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) campus and classrooms and spiritual Aten Path initiation supra-structure at Giza including the SPHINX/HU natural rock sculpture and the Great Pyramid ___ today’s Nubians (ANU-bians) of modern Egypt and Sudan.
The premise that the 4 Anu Peoples of the ”Nine Bow” Tribal Nations of aNubia (Anu
Seth), Kush, Meroe and Kenthunnefer (Anu Antiu) were the aboriginal founders and core of ancient Egypt/Kemit is supported by the Historian HERODOTUS in his History, Book II as follows:
“ ... we can show that there was once no country for the Egyptians; for we have seen that (as the Egyptians themselves say, and as I myself judge) the Delta is alluvial and but lately (so to say) come into being... I hold rather that the Egyptians did not come into being with the making of that which the (Ionian Greeks) call the Delta: that they [the Egyptians] ever existed since men were first made; and as the land grew in
extent many of them spread down over it, and many stayed behind. Be that as it may, the Theban province, a land of six thousand one hundred and twenty (6,120) furlongs in circuit, was of old called Egypt.” (paragraph 15)
“... Egypt is all that country which is inhabited by Egyptians ... we shall consider all
Egypt, down from the [8 Nile] Cataracts and the city of Elephantine 10 [footnote 10 On the Island opposite Syene (Assuan/Aswan)], to be divided into two parts ... For the Nile, beginning from the [8 Nile] Cataracts, divides Egypt into two parts as it flows to the sea.” (paragraph 17)
“ ...the extent of Egypt ... is attested by the answer which (my judgment being already formed) I heard to have been given concerning Egypt by the oracle of Ammon. The men of the cities of Marea and Apis, in the part of Egypt bordering on Libya, thinking themselves to be not Egyptians but Libyans, and misliking the observance of the
religious law which forbade them to eat cows’ flesh, sent to Ammon saying that
they had no part or lot with Egypt: for they dwelt (said they) outside the Delta and did not consent to the ways of its people, and they wished to be suffered to eat of all
foods. But the god forbade them: all the land, he said, watered by the Nile in its course was Egypt, and all who dwelt lower down than the city Elephantine [ the 4 Anu Tribes of the “Nine Bow”] and drank of that river’s water were Egyptians. Such was the oracle given to them” (paragraph 19).
NOTE: That according the Herodotus the original Anu Peoples and Annu Culture of Egypt/Kemit followed the spiritual dietary law of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) which forbid as did the sister Mystery School of Asian India the eating of the flesh of cattle and other animals and were at minimal and best vegetarian/vegan.
Thus in the Ancient Egyptian Predynastic Human Period the "Nine Bow Tribal" Federation was founded and dominated by the Anu Peoples of the "Second Race". French Egyptologist Abbe' Emile Amelineau was the first to discover and publish in his books of 1902 and 1916 that the black African Anu People were the aboriginal Ancient Egyptians. This scholastic courage cost him his reputation and research support at the hands of racist conventional Egyptologists. To this day his scholastic findings and courageous conclusions are ostracized and ridiculed by the world’s conventional Egyptologists.
In the Dynastic Human Period the Ancient Egyptian "Nine Bow Tribal" Federation was
dominated primarily by the invading Dark Red Hamitic People the "FIRST RACE"; while the Federation was constantly secondarily domination challenged by its founding Anu People the "SECOND RACE". The Dark Red Hamitic People had invaded Anu People controlled Ancient Egypt/Kemit from out of Asia Minor during the final stages of the Ancient Egyptian Predynastic Human Period; symbolically recorded in the Ancient Egyptian war and civil war mythologies of the "Horus-Seth Wars", the Osirian (Osiris & Isis) tales historically recorded on Narmer's Palette presented in EXHIBIT I_F-1 and EXHIBIT I_F-2.

F. PHARAOH-QUEEN HATSHEPSUT’S PUNT EXPEDITION TO “TA NETER” AND THE "GARDEN OF EDEN"
GRAPHIC 2.5
18 th DYNASTY EGYPTIAN PHARAOH-QUEEN HATSHEPSUT'S BURIAL TEMPLE AT DEIR EL BAHARI IN WESTERN THEBES ON THE NILE RIVER HOLDS THE INCREDIBLE WALL RELIEFS HISTORICALLY DESCRIBING HER COMMISSIONED SHIP & SAFARI EXPEDITION TO THE "LAND OF THE ANCESTORS/GODS"
GRAPHIC 2.5 above presents the Burial Temple of 18 th Dynasty Egyptian PharaohQueen-High Priestess Hatshepsut (1492-1470 BC) located at Deir El Bahari in Western Thebes on the Nile River. She sent 5 ships to take a "Ship and Safari Expedition to the 'Land of the Gods/Ancestors (Ta Neter)". This over two year round trip Ship and Safari Expedition is recorded in written and visual detail in a series of Wall Reliefs on the southern half of the wall behind the middle colonnade of her Deir El Bahari Burial Temple.
An "objective interpretation" of this detailed Wall Relief record of 18 th Dynasty PharaohQueen Hatshepsut's so-called "Punt Expedition", or more exactly the "Ship and Safari
Expedition to the 'Land of the Ancestors/Gods (Ta Neter)"; has been circumvented into a mystery and thus source of heated controversy for over a hundred and twenty years.
Consequently, there are significant obstacles to an "objective interpretation" of the Hatshepsut Deir El Bahari Burial Temple Wall Relief record of her "Ship and Safari Expedition to the “Land of the Ancestors/Gods (Ta Neter)" as will be appreciated below. These obstacles notably include the racist scholarship and severe physical vandalism directed at the Wall Reliefs in question, primarily motivated by the continued need to engender this mystery in order to cover up the real location and real racial and ethnic identity of the residents of “Ta Neter".
Nevertheless please note that what follows in the remaining portion of this Chapter is this long awaited "objective interpretation": A final resolution is presented to this prolonged and heated controversy by the simple solution of the mystery of what country Ancient Egypt's "Land of the Ancestors/Gods (Ta Neter)" was located; and the simple solution of the mystery of what was the ethnic and racial identify of the human residents of Ta Neter the "Ancestral Gods" or aboriginal Ancient Egyptians who founded the greatest civilization of written history.
Esoterically these "Ancestral Gods" who first founded the Ancient Civilization of
Egypt/Kemit, correspond to the aboriginal Ancient Egyptians of the "Predynastic
Demigods" and earlier "Predynastic-God" Periods dating back to well before 100,000 B.C. This view is based upon the writings of both the Greek "Father of Written History" Herodotus and the Annu Egyptian High Priest historian Manethos; the only two historians of Ancient Egypt/Kemit who both lived and wrote their histories during the final days of the Dynastic Period.
Specifically, Herodotus and Manetho were the only two historians of Ancient Egypt/Kemit who had access to the source documents of the BOOKS OF THOTH the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) before Ancient Egypt was finally "destroyed" by the Roman Empire founded and thus spun-off by its perennial invader and nemesis the barbarian SCYTHIAN/MAGOG TRIBES of the Black Sea Crimea region of Europe.

Consequently, the TWO KEYS to unlocking these 2 mysteries rest upon the identification of the location and the identification of the human residents of Ancient Egypt/Kemit's "Land of the Ancestors/Gods (Ta Neter)". These TWO KEYS were acquisitioned in 1928 by “Anthropological Analysis” of the written and visual record of the 18 th Dynasty Pharaoh Queen Hatshepsut Deir El Bahari Burial Temple Wall Relief of her commissioned "Ship and Safari Expedition to the 'Land of the Ancestors/Gods (Ta Neter)".
The acquisition of these TWO KEYS and the unlocking of the Ta Neter and aboriginal people of Ancient Egypt/Kemit mysteries through a holistic or multi-disciplinarian "objective interpretation" is presented below .
GRAPHIC 2.6
WALL RELIEF OF THE ARRIVAL OF THE 5 SHIPS TO THE RED SEA COAST OF THE AFRICANCOUNTRY OF PUNT TODAYS "ERITRIA" ON THE "HORN OF AFRICA", COMMISSIONED BY 18 TH DYNASTY PHARAOH-QUEEN HATSHEPSUT TO THE "LAND OF THE ANCESTORS/GODS" (MARIETTE, AUGUSTE, DEIR EL BAHARI, LEIPZIG, 1877)
GRAPHIC 2.6 above presents the "Ships' Arrival" Wall Relief from the Hatshepsut Deir El Bahari Burial Temple. It details the arrival and anchorage of the 5 Egyptian ships in the Red Sea Port of the African country of Punt today known as Eritrea on the coast of the Red Sea "Horn of Africa". This Expedition of 5 ships left Egypt was commissioned by 18 th Dynasty Egyptian Pharaoh-Queen Hatshepsut. and sailed south down the African coast of the Red Sea, outfitted with Egyptian soldiers and sailors. We will see below that this ambitious Expedition includes sailing the Red Sea by ship to the coast of Punt (today called Eritrea), and then undertaking an interior of Africa land Safari on foot across Sheba (today called Ethiopia/Abyssinia) into the Nile River Equatorial Great Lakes region known then as Khenthunefer. For more GRAPHIC 2.6 detail see EXHIBIT IV-B.

GRAPHIC 2.7 above presents on 2 levels the "Welcome and Tribute by the Country of Punt" Wall Relief from the Hatshepsut Deir El Bahari Burial Temple. Specifically, it shows the Puntian people bringing welcoming gifts (lower level) and later delivering tribute (upper level) to the Egyptian soldiers. The soldiers were aboard the 5 Egyptian ships which sailed from Egypt/Kemit by way of the Red Sea as part the Pharaoh-Queen Hatshepsut "Ship and Safari Expedition to the 'Land of the Ancestors/Gods (Ta Neter)" .

COMPUTER ENHANCED WALL RELIEF FROM THE HATSHEPSUT DEIR EL BAHARI BURIAL TEMPLE OF 4 LEVELS OF DETAIL OF THE SAFARI TO THE "LAND OF THE ANCESTORS/GODS" COMMISSIONED BY 18 TH DYNASTY PHARAOHQUEEN HATSHEPSUT SHOWING FOR THE FIRST TIME A MALE GIRAFFE IN THE LEFT CORNER OF LEVEL THREE AND A HIPPOPOTAMUS AND BABOON IN THE LEFT CORNER OF LEVEL FOUR (from Smith, William Stevenson; “The Land of Punt”, Journal of the American Research Center in Egypt, Bk. 1, Boston, MA., 1962)
GRAPHIC 2.8 above presents the 4 leveled "Safari" Wall Relief computer enhanced
from William Stevenson Smith’s article “The Land of Punt”, Journal of the American Research Center in Egypt, Bk. 1, Boston, MA., 1962. The"Safari" Wall Relief details part of Pharaoh-Queen Hatshepsut's Punt Expedition to the “Land of the Ancestors/Gods (Ta Neter)" recorded in the Hatshepsut Deir El Bahari Burial Temple. The "Safari" on foot took place after the 5 ships commissioned by 18 th Dynasty Pharaoh-Queen Hatshepsut of Ancient Egypt/Kemit had landed, been welcomed with gifts and been given tribute by the African Red Sea Coastal country of Punt.
Note that Frankincense and Myrrh trees are shown on all 4 levels of the "Safari" Wall Relief GRAPHIC 2.8 above seen being collected and resin harvested throughout the AgriForests of the various regions and carried back to the 5 Egyptian ships anchored in the Red Sea Port of Punt. For more GRAPHIC 2.8 detail study EXHIBIT IV_D, EXHIBIT IV_D-2, EXHIBIT IV_D-3, EXHIBIT IV_D-4-1 and EXHIBIT IV_D-4-2.
Specifically it is theorized the 18 th Dynasty Pharaoh-Queen Hatshepsut commissioned "Safari" penetrated on foot into the interior of Africa, traveling through the Agri-Forests or cultivated jungles of coastal Punt or today's Eritrea, across the mountainous Sheba or today's Ethiopia/Abyssinia; then descended down in elevation into the Nile River Valley of Meroe around the Atbara and White Nile River area of Lake Tana, and on into the interior Nile River Central Great Lakes region of Equatorial Africa called Khenthunefer.
Note that this 1962 American Research Center in Egypt published computer enhancement of the heavily vandalized "Safari" Wall Relief GRAPHIC 2.8 above exposed for the first time the presence of a male giraffe. Specifically the left portion of the 3 rd level of the "Safari" Wall Relief is inhabited by a male giraffe.
Note additionally the left portion of the 4 th level of the "Safari" Wall Relief GRAPHIC 2.8 shows a hippopotamus and baboon. It is logical to assume that the male giraffe and baboon were captured by the "Safari" for return to Egypt by ship. This can be seen below in GRAPHIC 2.9 (Page 20) detailed in EXHIBIT IV_E-1, GRAPHIC 2.10 (Page 20) detailed in EXHIBITIV_F-1 and GRAPHIC 2.12 (Page 23) detailed in EXHIBIT IV_F-5 and EXHIBIT IV_F-6.
The proximity of the male giraffe with the hippopotamus strongly suggest that the "Land of the Ancestor/Gods" is in the Nile River Region of the Great Lakes in Equatorial Africa starting at the northern most Lake Tana; being that these fauna naturally are found in close proximity together only in that region.

GRAPHIC 2.9
WALL RELIEF OF THE 5 SHIPS BEING LOADED FOR THE RETURN TRIP TO EGYPT FROM THE EXPEDITION TO THE "LAND OF THE ANCESTORS/GODS" BY 18 TH DYNASTY PHARAOH-QUEEN HATSHEPSUT (MARIETTE, AUGUSTE, DEIR EL BAHARI, LEIPZIG, 1877)
GRAPHIC 2.9 above shows the "Ships' Loading and Departure" Wall Relief with the 5 Egyptian ships anchored in the Red Sea port of the country of Punt being loaded and leaving Port for their return trip north up the Red Sea Coast back to Egypt/Kemit. This Wall Relief from the Hatshepsut Deir El Bahari Burial Temple records in hieroglyphic and visual
detail describe the 5 ships from Egypt/Kemit being loaded with at least 12 Frankincense and Myrrh trees, bags of resin incense, precious woods and metals, various rare animals including at least 10 caged leopards and 3 baboons, and other tribute from the coastal African coastal country of Punt and Safari collected precious items from various interior African countries. For more GRAPHIC 2.9 details see EXHIBIT IV_E-1.
The question that the giraffe encountered and captured in the Land Safari is apparently described as being part of the return cargo in the heavily vandalized hieroglyphic section of the "Ships' Loading and Departure" Wall Relief is addressed in EXHIBIT IV_E_2. The suspicion the Wall Relief shown in GRAPHIC 2.9 above has been vandalized to erase the presence of the giraffe "on board” any of the 5 ships is addressed in EXHIBIT IV_E-4 and EXHIBIT IV_E-5.
Such vandalization would be motivated by hoping to cover-up that the 18 th Dynasty Hatshepsut Expedition's Safari penetrated into the Central Great Lakes of Equatorial Africa, and thus hoping to cover-up the definitive location of Ancient Egypt/Kemit's "Land of the Ancestors/Gods" (Ta Neter). Ignoring the Land Safari’s visit to Sheba or present day Sudan and Ethiopia is part of that cover-up as shown by EXHIBIT IV_E-3 and EXHIBIT IV_F-2.

WALL RELIEF OF THE PROCESSION OF TRIBUTE AND CARGO CLEARLY SHOWING THE LOWER BODY OF A MALE GIRAFFE, LEOPARDS AND CATTLE BROUGHT BACK TO EGYPT FROM THE EXPEDITION TO THE "LAND OF THE ANCESTORS/GODS" OF 18 TH DYNASTY PHARAOH-QUEEN HATSHEPSUT (NAVILLE, TEMPLE OF DEIR EL BAHARI, VOL. III, EEF, 1898)

GRAPHIC 2.10 above shows the "Tribute and Cargo Procession" Wall Relief of some of the items brought back to Egypt by the 5 ships that returned from the 18 th Dynasty PharaohQueen Hatshepsut Punt Expedition involving naval ships and land safari to the 'Land of the Ancestors/Gods (Ta Neter)". This heavily vandalized "Tribute and Cargo Procession" Wall Relief from the Hatshepsut Deir El Bahari Burial Temple, nevertheless includes the lower body of a male giraffe as well as leopards and cattle. Remember that the Giraffe is an African animal found naturally only on the planes and in the jungles of the Nile River Valley's Great Lakes Equatorial Region known as Khenthunnefer in Ancient Egyptians/Kemitians. See EXHIBIT IV_F-1.
Ironically in 1928 Barthold Laufer an Anthropologist and not an Egyptologist working in the Chicago Field Museum, published in his book The Giraffe in History and Art the first correct but ignored analysis of this "Tribute and Cargo Procession" Wall Relief GRAPHIC 2.10 above showing the mutilated figure of a male giraffe. Without racial bias against black
Africans Barthold Laufer correctly identifies that the location of the male giraffe was not the African coastal country of Punt but the similar but yet distinct contiguous interior Equatorial African Central Great Lakes region of Khenthunefer.
Thus Anthropologist Barthold Laufer's scholastically ignored 1928 "objective interpretation" agreed with Egyptologist E.G. Naville’s earlier scholastically ignored 1894 "objective interpretation" , the latter having lead the original archaeological study of the Hatshepsut Deir El Bahari Burial Temple. Both Laufer and Naville’s "objective interpretations" identify the Red Sea coastal port country of Punt (todays Eritrea) as the destination where Queen Hatshepsut’s naval expedition of 5 Egyptian ships anchored and landed the Egyptian soldiers. They also identify that Punt was not the final destination of this Pharaoh-Queen Hatshepsut's "Ship and Safari Expedition expedition as it conducted a land "Safari" into the interior Equatorial African Central Great Lakes region of the Nine Bow “ countries of Meroe and Khenthunefer;. i.e. into the 'Land of the Ancestors/Gods" (Ta Neter).
Anthropologist Barthold Laufer concludes in his book The Giraffe in History and Art:
"According to E. Naville (The Temple of Deir El Bahari, pg. 21, Egypt Exploration Fund, XII, 1984), the giraffe is said to come from the country Khenthennofer, not from the coast. The region is generally distinguished from Punt; the two countries, however, were contiguous, but of somewhat wide and indefinite extent, Punt possessing a coast where vessels could land, while Khenthennofer was located in the mountainous interior. The two countries had a mixed population which included Negroes, and their products were almost identical. Ivory, live panthers, panther-skins, monkeys, gold, ebony, and antimony were common to both. All these products being typically African, it is evident that Queen Hatshepsut's expedition had been directed to the east coast of Africa. Wealthy Egyptians were fond of keeping live specimens of the fauna of Punt like dogs, monkeys, panthers, leopards and giraffes." [The Giraffe in History and Art,
Department of Anthropology, Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago, Il., 1928, Leaflet #27, pages 20 & 21]
Remarkably Barthold Laufer makes his conclusion exactly 34 years after E.G. Naville's 1894 conclusion and exactly 34 years before the computer enhancement in 1962 by the American Research Center in Egyptology of the "Safari" Wall Relief GRAPHIC 2.8 above. Please take note that the computer enhancement of the "Safari" Wall Relief undoubtedly revealed for the first time the same male giraffe of the "Tribute and Cargo" Wall Relief GRAPHIC 2.10 above that Bart hold Lauer and E.G. Neville both correctly use to deduce the location of Ancient Egypt's "Land of the Ancestors/Gods (Ta Netter)" was Khenthunefer.
Summarizing the significance of the male giraffe in the Hatshepsut Deir El Bahari Burial Temple Wall Relief historical record of Pharaoh-Queen Hatshepsut's "Ship and Safari Expedition to the "Land of the Ancestors/Gods, the following observations can be made:
1.) a 1962 computer enhancement makes visible for the first time on the "Safari" Wall Relief GRAPHIC 2.8 above, that a male giraffe figure is conclusively identified and located on the land "Safari" into the interior of Equatorial Africa's Nile River Central Great Lakes region called Khenthunefer ;

21.



2.) in the "Ships' Loading and Departure" Wall Relief GRAPHIC 2.9 above, the suspected same male giraffe figure appears to have been vandalized from the written record and erased from the visual record of being transported by ship back to
Egypt/Kemit see EXHIBIT IV_E-4 and EXHIBIT IV_E-5; and
3.) in the "Tribute and Cargo Procession" Wall Relief GRAPHIC 2.10 above, the suspected same male giraffe figure is recognized although heavily vandalized as part of the Procession for Pharaoh-Queen Hatshepsut; thus this male giraffe is logically identifiable as the same one having been seen on the Expedition's land "Safari" and obviously captured and transported by ship back to Egypt/Kemit.
Consequently in identifying the geographic location of Ancient Egypt's "Land of the
Ancestors/Gods (Ta Neter)" The FIRST KEY Is The Zoology Of The Giraffe And Related
Fauna. The natural history of the giraffe and the hippopotamus found near it, indicate that the African Equatorial Great Lakes was the final destination of 18 th Dynasty Pharaoh-Queen Hatshepsut "Ship and Safari Expedition to the 'Land of the Ancestors/Gods (Ta Neter)".
However in identifying the ethnicity and race of the human residents of Ancient Egypt's "Land of the Ancestors/Gods (Ta Neter)" The SECOND KEY Is The Political Geography Of Ancient Egypt/Kemit And Its Neighbors. Specifically, the "Land of the Gods/Ancestors Tribute Procession" Wall Relief GRAPHIC 2.11 below shows there were 4 groups of kneeling Tributing people who returned back to Egypt on the 5 Egyptian ships.
But to acquire this SECOND KEY we must use the race and ethnicity concepts of the 18 th Dynasty Ancient Egyptians themselves presented previously in the two GRAPHIC 2.2 and
GRAPHIC 2.4 detailed respectively by EXHIBIT IV-1 and EXHIBIT IV-2. So equipped with the Ancient Egyptian Political Geography we can continue our "objective interpretation" of the Hatshepsut Deir El Bahari Burial Temple record of the 18 th Dynasty Pharaoh-Queen Hatshepsut "Ship and Safari Expedition to “Ta Neter".
GRAPHIC 2.11

GRAPHIC 2.11 above is a composite of separate documents as part of the "Land of the Ancestors/Gods Tribute Procession for Queen Hatshepsut" Wall Relief following the return of the 5 Egyptian ships back to Egypt/Kemit after the completion of a 2 1/2 year "Ship and Safari Expedition to the 'Land of the Ancestors/Gods (Ta Neter)" . The "Tribute Procession" before Pharaoh-Queen Hatshepsut is led by four groups of kneeling Tributing people followed by the Tribute and Safari collected items including Frankincense and Myrrh Trees, resin incense, leopards, baboons and cattle. See EXHIBIT IV_F-4.
The composite of GRAPHIC 2.11 is separated and presented as GRAPHIC 2.12 below to detail the graphics and identifying hieroglyphics of the four groups of kneeling Tributing people and as GRAPHIC 2.13 below to detail the hieroglyphic text describing in detail the
entire processionary wall relief. Compare EXHIBIT IV_F-4, EXHIBIT IV_F-5, EXHIBIT IV_F-6 and EXHIBIT IV_F-7.

NAVILLE, TEMPLE OF DEIR EL BAHARI, EGYPT EXPLORATION FUND, 1898)
GRAPHIC 2.12 above is a blowup of the right portion of the composite "Land of the Ancestors/Gods" Tribute Procession" Relief GRAPHIC 2.10 detailing the graphics of the four groups of kneeling Tributing people, the 4 groups have in front of them hieroglyphics naming them and are identified as follows:
* Anu Antiu, the first group of people are males without goatees of the black African Nine Bow Tribe #6 from the Equatorial Africa Nile River Valley Central Great Lakes area called KHENTHUNEFER __ today known as the Dafur Province of the Sudan the surviving people known as the Fur as well as the Dogon People of Chad;
* Meroe, the second group of people are males without goatees of the black African Nine Bow Tribe #4 between the Atbara and Blue Nile Rivers and northern most Great Lake Tana area of the Upper Nile River Valley;
* Sheba, the third group of people are males with goatees of the Dark Red Hamitics, from the "Horn of Africa" interior country today called Abyssinia or Ethiopia; and
* Punt, the forth group of people are males with goatees of the Dark Red Hermitic from, the "Horn of Africa" Red Sea coastal country today called Eritria. See EXHIBIT IV_F-5 and EXHIBIT IV_F-6.
Note that the Anu Antiu and the Meroe are the most remote members of the 4 Anu Peoples living along the Nile River Valley starting at its Delta end and ending at its start at the Central Africa Great Lakes of the White Nile River. The Anu People were the foundation of the Egyptian Federation of Tribal Nations called the “Nine Bow”. Refer to EXHIBIT IV_2. Thus it makes total sense that they would be considered as part of “Ta Nerter” or “ the Land of the Gods” having lead the founding of ancient Egypt/Kemit and implementing its theocratic institutions in the Predynastic Human Period.

NAVILLE, TEMPLE OF DEIR EL BAHARI, EGYPT EXPLORATION FUND, 1898)
GRAPHIC 2.13 above is a blowup of the hieroglyphic right portion of the composite "Land of the Ancestors/Gods" Tribute Procession" Wall Relief GRAPHIC 2.10. It presents hieroglyphics naming three of the four groups of kneeling Tributing people with the forth group's hieroglyphics being most likely vandalized in the "Land of the Ancestors/Gods Tribute Procession" as follows:
1.) the Sheba group from hieroglyphics in line 1;
2.) the Punt group from hieroglyphics in line 1;
3.) the Anu Antiu group of the region Khenthunefer both from hieroglyphics in the first part of line 2; esoterically the Dafur Province area of today’s Sudan, the Fur People being their descendents as well as the Dogon People of Chad; and
4.) the suspected Meroe group from the vandalized hieroglyphics in the last part of line 2, "suspected" because they are graphically shown and hierogyphically named in the previous blow up section of the "Land of the Ancestors/Gods" Tribute Procession" Wall Relief GRAPHIC 2.12 above. See EXHIBIT IV_F-7.
Finally, the knowledge acquired from the FIRST KEY (of the captured male giraffe's origin location) COMBINED with the knowledge acquired from the SECOND KEY (of the identity of the 4 groups of kneeling Tributing people who returned from the Queen Hatshepsut Ship and Safari Expedition to “Ta Neter") unlocks the identity of the location and human residents of Ancient Egypt/Kemit's "Land of the Ancestors/Gods (Ta Neter)" :
I.) THE FIRST KEY IS THE ZOOLOGY OF THE GIRAFFE AND ASSOCIATED FAUNA: The identity of the location of Ancient Egypt's "Land of the Ancestors/Gods (Ta Neter)" is the Nile River Central Great Lakes region of Equatorial Africa called KHENTHUNEFER including the northern most Lake Tana of the Upper Nile River Valley; the natural history home of both the giraffe and hippopotamus;
II.) THE SECOND KEY IS THE POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY OF ANCIENT EGYPT AND ITS NEIGHBORS: The identity of the human residents of Ancient Egypt's "Land of the Ancestors/Gods (Ta Neter)" are two of the four black African ANU Tribes the Anu Antiu of KHENTHUNEFER of the Nile River Central Great Lakes region of Equatorial Africa and the Meroe who lived in the contiguous “land island” area between and surrounded by the Atbara River and Blue Nile River. See MAP 7.

Thus French Egyptologist Abbe' Emile Amelineau was correct in 1902 that the black African Anu People were the aboriginal people of Ancient Egypt/Kemit as follows:
* THE BLACK AFRICAN"ANU ANTIU" TRIBE Inhabited The Central Great Lakes Of Equatorial Africa. This Region Called By The Ancient Egyptians "KHENTHUNNEFER" Meant And Was Biblically Referred To As The Legendary "Garden Of Eden"; and
* THE BLACK AFRICAN "MEROE" TRIBE Lived In Northern Great Lakes Equatorial Africa Bordering KHENTHUNEFER, On Land Bounded By The Atbara And White Nile River Tributaries And The Northern Most Great Lake Tana.
Yet it is this type of unprecedented and continued rediscovery, promulgation and reconstruction of the true history, culture, technology and spirituality of the aboriginal Ancient Egyptians The Black African Anu People and their Ancient Egyptian Mystery School Of On (Annu) that is now required for world education, healing, prosperity and
peace today. A New Paradigm of human general systems theory of civilization and modern sustainable technology is required and emerging. It needs to be regrounded in the
Aboriginal Paradigm of the "Garden Of Eden (Aten)" Mentality And Sustainable AgriForest Prosperity Reality attained most spectacularly last on Earth by Ancient Egypt/Kemit.
Elements of the Ancient Civilization of Egypt/Kemit appear to have spread around the world to other Ancient Classic Civilizations; e.g. the still existing Hunza of the Himalayan Mountains, the now extinct Essenes of Israel, the still existing Toltecs and Mayans of MezoAmerica, the extinct "Mississippi River Valley Mound Builders", the extinct Anatazi of the Four Corners America, and the Pre-Incas and Incas of the Andean Mountains. Few of these elements have survived to this day in a living civilization; except notably the Hunza of modern Pakistan and the Anatazi successors the Pueblo and Navajo/Dine' Indian Tribes.
More importantly up to this time in history a reemergence of an evolved holistic human civilization based on an evolved modern sustainable technology on the level of Ancient Egyp/Kemit has been ruthlessly suppressed, sabotaged and covered up for over three thousand years.

Discovered is the paramount role of dreadlocked coiffured Rastafarian Priests in the Predynastic founding and Dynastic maintenance and operation of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu). For more discussion see EXHIBIT I_G.
It is clear that aboriginally the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) educated the” Annu Pharaoh”, Rastafarian and Annu Priests And Priestesses and other leaders of the Theocracy Of Ancient Egypt/Kemit; as well as leaders of the theocratic government bureaucracy, commerce, science, engineering, military, the arts and music, health and legal professions and other socio-theocratic-enterprise technicians.

GRAPHIC 3.4 above documents that the 12 th Dynasty of Ancient Egypt/Kemit Pharaoh Amenemhet III circa 1839 BC. was trained by the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) and attaining simultaneous Rastafarian and High Priest status. This is as indicated by his dreadlocked hair, leopard head and skin smock, "Aten Path" Medallions and Het-Heru necklace (commemorating Third Spiritual Plane communion). This Annu Pharaoh is cited by Herodotus as having built the Labyrinth and the largest artificial Lake Moeris with an island and pyramid. Esoterically the Lake was the center of an irrigated sustainable horticultural area fed by a manmade parallel canal. See EXHIBIT III_A-1, EXHIBIT III_A-2_3 and MAP 3.
B. THE RASTAFARIAN HIGH PRIESTESSES' ROLE IN THE ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MYSTERY SCHOOL OF ANNU (ON)
The THIRD DISCOVERY of the Chronic Poverty R & D behind this book was the
"Amenses" condition the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) Priestesses achieved from their training including vegetarian/vegan diet, inner hygiene enema and "positive celibacy" regimen. Thus they wear and need no undergarments or menstrual pads being absent leucorrhea, menstruation, and coital promiscuity. The Amenses condition was the "Original Condition of Women".
The "Amenses" condition is an aboriginal and natural condition of women like the Navajo/Dine' Native American of the American states of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah women were found to be in 1951. It is a natural feminine state so esoteric today that is confused with the abnormal "amenorrhea" condition. The "Amenses" condition of women has been used as the standard for priestesses in the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu), the priestesses of the Oracle Of Delphi Of Ancient Greece, the mystic women members of the Essenes Of Ancient Israel and the past and today's reborn Rastafarian, Eastern and New Age Spiritual movements.

Her headdress indicates she achieved a Forth Spiritual Plane communion. Her Sarcophagus lid contained Ancient Egypt/Kemit Hieroglyphics indicating that she was a follower of the "Aten Path". By definition of her status, achievements and dress she was "Amenses". See Exhibit III_J-1 and Exhibit III_J-2.
C. RASTAFARIAN PRINCIPLES OF THE EGYPTIAN MYSTERY SCHOOL OF ON (ANNU)
The FORTH DISCOVERY of the Chronic Poverty R & D behind this book is the proper identification and translation of parts of the "missing" 42 Books Of Thoth/Hermes. This was achieved by the realization they were premeditatively dislocated and later mistranslated within the Egyptian Book of the Dead.

Fortunately several of these spiritual segments of the 42 Books Of Thoth have been identified, properly translated and presented in Chapter Six.
This breakthrough based on comparative religion scholarship of Sant Kirpal Singh Ji’s Naam or Word and the Crown of Life and experimental anthropology was used to help reconstruct a composite of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) and its Spirituality System of the Path of the Aten including the Ten (10) Cardinal Virtues identified by George James in Stolen Legacy.
Thus the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) Rastafarian High Priesthood And Priestesshood can be characterized with the following 12 principles:
1.) VEGAN AND VEGETARIAN DIETARY REGIMEN
2.) POSITIVE CELIBACY OR MONOGAMOUS "BECOME ONE" MARRIAGE
3.) HORTICULTURAL BASED EARTH CARETAKERS
4.) COMMUNE WITH NATURE AND AVOIDANCE OF INTOXICANTS
5.) LIVE SIMPLY IN SERVICE AND IN PEACE __WHICH THE DREADLOCKED HAIR SYMBOLIZED
6.) PRACTICE OF ABORIGINAL SPIRITUALITY VIA LIGHT AND SOUND YOGA
7.) CONDUCT REFLECTING THE "GOLDEN RULE" TOWARDS ALL THINGS
8.) SUSTAINABLE & SMALL SCALE ENTERPRISES
9.) UTILIZE PREVENTIVE SICKNESS NUTRITIONAL HERBOLOGY AND SICKNESS CURATIVE MEDICINAL HERBOLOGY
10.) SUSTAINABLE TECHNOLOGY & TECHNIQUES INCLUDING SUSTAINABLE
AGRI-FORESTRY (SAF)
11.) CREATE, PERFORM AND ENJOY MUSICAL ARTS & VISUAL ARTS
12.) IN THOUGHTS, WORDS AND DEEDS STRIVE TO BE "HUMAN GODS" BY PERFECTING THE TEN (10) CARDINAL VIRTUES of the SCHOOL OF ON
The challenge to the modern Modern Rastafarians permeating the Reggae Music Culture starting from the Caribbean Island of Jamaica in the 1930's, is to fully understand the discovery of the Ancient Rastafarian's integral connection with the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu). The mission of the Modern Rastafari is to help usher in the return of the "Prosperity Mentality and Reality" founded on the "Garden of Eden" inspired Sustainable Agri-Forestry reforestation of planet Earth detailed in Chapter 9.
D. THE RASTAFARIAN PRESENCE IN BIBLICAL ISRAEL
Exoterically, Moses was trained at the Egyptian Mystery “School of On” as inferred in the Bible, and confirmed by Josephus the Historian and by Philo. Thus after the Exodus and his arrival in Palestine, Moses fashioned the Theocratic nation of Israel on the “School of On” Rastafarian Principles. The recipient of Moses’ “School of On” training was the Essenes including the dreadlocked coiffured Nazarites epitomized by Samson and John the Baptist.
Esoterically, Sigmund Freud in Moses and Monotheism deduced that Moses and Egyptian Pharaoh Akhenaton if not the same personage as we theorize were contemporaries as the monotheistic “School of On” Aten Path and worship of Adonas in Israel is not a coincidence. This is evident in that Moses spoke to the Israelites in his natïve Egyptian tongue which was in turn translated into Hebrew by Aaron. The forthcoming Volume II of The Egyptian “School of On” will address this Rastafarian presence in Israel in detail.

PHARAOH-QUEEN-HIGH PRIESTESS HATSHEPSUT OF THE 18 TH DYNASTY OF ANCIENT EGYPT SHOWN AS SPHINX
The Architectural Function of the Sphinx Rock Sculpture is clear: The Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) commissioned and oversaw the Sphinx Rock Sculpture and Temples as the gateway onto its Giza Rock Plateau Complex. However the Epistemological Function of the Sphinx Rock Sculpture is only speculated upon by contemporary Egyptology. The related Artistic Symbology of the smaller Sphinx Figures found amongst Ancient Egypt/Kemit’s artifacts as statues, wall reliefs and as illustrations in religious writings, as human headed hawks or more commonly human headed lions is not fully understood.
For millenniums conquering cultures, tourists, scientists, other scholars and spiritualists have marveled at the unknown construction technology, and struggled with the meaning of Ancient Egypt/Kemit’s Sphinx Rock Sculpture at Giza. The Ancient Greeks who marveled at it called it the "SPHINX". The Ancient Civilization of Egypt/Kemit which built the Sphinx Rock Sculpture at Giza called it the "HU" (E. Wallis Budge, An Egyptian Hieroglyphic Dictionary, NY, 1978, Vol. I, pg. 469).
It has been presented in Chapter 1 that the Giza Rock Plateau Complex was the main Education Campus and Spirituality Initiation Center for its Spirituality System called the Aten Path of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu). Thus there is all the reason to begin our discussion suspecting the Sphinx Rock Sculpture as having a Spiritual Epistemology and thus Spiritual Artistic Symbology.

GRAPHIC 4.0 above shows 18 th Dynasty Pharaoh Thutmose IV in a unique "Multiple Time Lapse Progression." He is depicted being trained by the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) "Thet" or Master Priest Hekreshu (Shu-Ra) as a child, teenager and as a young man. This would explain Pharaoh Thuthmose IV's loyalty to the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) Spirituality System the Aten Path expressly stated in the Eighth (8 th) Line of the Hieroglyphics accompanying GRAPHIC 4.0. See Exhibit III_B-1 and Exhibit III_B-2.

GRAPHIC 4.1 above shows the 18 th Dynasty Commemorative Sphinx Stela of Pharaoh Thuthmose IV. The Stela describes Thuthmose’s spiritual vision as a young man before becoming Pharaoh at the Sphinx Rock Sculpture and his resulting renovation of it. The
Sphinx or as personification of the Third Spiritual Plane Sun God Ra-Heru Aakhuti in Thuthmose ’s vision asked him to clear away the sands which were nearly covering it from years of neglect. In return for doing this Thuthmose was told he would become the next Pharaoh, although he was not next in line to the throne of Egypt/Kemit. See Exhibit III_B-3_4.

This would explain Pharaoh Thuthmose IV's unprecedented renovations to the Sphinx Rock Sculpture, and why he is associated more with it more than any other Pharaoh of Ancient Egypt/Kemit. Fittingly the name "Thuthmose" means "Reborn Son of Thoth". Thoth (Tchuti/Hermes) was the Second Plane Sun God. The God Thoth and its Priesthood were the founders of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu). See Appendix I-B.

GRAPHIC 4.2 above shows a recent North side view of the Sphinx Rock Sculpture. The people standing in the upper left background show the colossal size of this rock sculpture. The immense trench around it was formed from the sculpturing of the limestone rock and the quarried rock segments up to 200 tons were used for the Sphinx Rock Sculpture and Monolithic and Valley Temples. See EXHIBIT I_C-3.

With the sand removed from around the Sphinx Rock Sculpture, erosion weathering lines are exposed and indicate an earlier construction date than the conventional circa 2,800 BC. As
discussed in detail in Chapter 1 the 1992 article by University of Boston Geologist Schoch and the 1993 article by the writer West present computerized sonar geological evidence that push back the construction date of the Sphinx Rock Sculpture to between 5,000 and 10,000 BC.

GRAPHIC 4.5 above shows the 12 th DYNASTY statue of Pharaoh Amenemhet III dressed in a Leopard Skin Smock, indicated by the leopard head on his shoulder. He too is adorned with Path of the Aten Medallions and coffered with Dreadlocked Hair. See Exhibit III_A-1. Note that both the 1 st Dynasty Thet Master Priest of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of (On) Annu shown on the previous page and GRAPHIC 4.4 of the 12 TH Dynasty Pharaoh Amenemhet III shown in GRAPHIC 4.5 above are separated in time by over a 1000 years yet as adherents of the Aten Path they both wear Leopard Skin Smock and Aten Path Medallions.
Thus the question arises as to what is the significance of the Leopard Skin Smock to the
Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) which practiced the Path Of The Aten? The significance lies in the Spiritual Epistemology of the Sphinx Figure; i.e. the human headed lion artistically represents a spiritually advanced Deified/HU-man Person. Thus Aten Path Master Priests of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) as presented in GRAPHIC 4.4 previously and discussed in Exhibit I_F-4 and Pharaoh Priests as Pharaoh Amenemhet III above; upon achieving this deified status wear Leopard Skin Smocks symbolically representing their leopard Sphinx personification. Deification or becoming a "Human God" was what successful student priests of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) strived for and attained in the Aten Path Spirituality System. Exhibit II_A-1, Exhibit II_A-2, Exhibit II_B-1, Exhibit II_B-2-3, Exhibit II_B-4 and Exhibit II_C depict this Deification Process in more detail.

GRAPHIC 4.8 above shows Two Depictions of the Tree of Life,the one on the right from exoteric and the one on the left from esoteric knowledge of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu). The right side exoteric depiction in GRAPHIC 4.8 shows the mysterious Tree of Life cited in the Bible Genesis 3:24 as being guarded from humans by "Cherubim’s (an order of Angels), and a burning sword" after the exile of the First Humans Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden. The Tree of Life is at the core of all Spirituality Systems; e.g. by following the Tree of Life an Aten Path Aspirant would be able to traverse the Land of Light or the Heavens made up of 8 Ascending Spiritual Planes. See Appendix_I-B.
The left side esoteric depiction in GRAPHIC 4.8 shows the First and Second Spiritual Plane
Sun Goddesses Ast and Neb Het and 6 Sacred Baboons/Souls of Annu revering the Tree of Life consisting of Ankh (Circular Cross) esoterically the Annu Khet or "Stream of Cosmic Life Energy" emanating from the Godhead Annu personified as the Sun Goddesses. The Ankh is depicted with hands holding the Solar Disc or Chakra (Hindu Terminology) or Aten (Ancient
Egyptian Terminology) of the Sun Gods. See EXHIBIT II_B-1. Compare with Exhibit II_A-1 and Exhibit II_A-2 depicting the hands within the Annu Khet holding an incense burner.

Note on the left side the married couple on the spirituality Aten Path stand before the Tree of Life” in their spiritual bodies or Ba’s preparing to enter the “Land of Spiritual Light”. The gatekeepers into the spiritual realms of heaven are shown as the “Guarding Leopards”. They symbolize the difficulty of the Deification Process of a spiritual aspirant overcoming his or her fears and weaknesses and “escaping the body tomb.” This direct communion with heaven and the “Gods” must be achieved by all successful spiritual aspirants resulting in their wearing of the leopard skin smock of the Annu Priest.
GRAPHIC 4.10 depicts on the right side this “achievement of escaping the body tomb” symbolized by the sacred Benni bird standing in front of the “Tree of Life.” Such successful male spiritual aspirants are symbolized as wearing a Leopard Skin Smock having conquered the Guarding Leopards as are the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of Annu (On) Priests as shown in GRAPHIC 4.4 and GRAPHIC 4.5 above. When such spiritual aspirants reached the third spiritual plane of the Deification/HU-man process they were often shown as a Sphinx/HU as illustrated below.

GRAPHIC 4.11 above shows that 18th Dynasty Ancient Egypt/Kemit Aten Path Thet Master and Pharaoh Akhenaton was also depicted as a human headed lion Sphinx Figure as verified by the tufted lion’s tail. Appendice I-B presents the cosmology of the continuous cosmogonic event where the Eighth Spiritual Plane and Most High God Annu's Solar Disk or Aten beams Annu Khet or Ankh symbolized by the Circular Cross of the Annu’s Cosmic Life Creative Energy Stream that animates all in the Universe.
NOTE too that Pharaoh Akhenaton is shown holding the Second Plane Sun Goddess Maat/Neb Het in his hand. Clearly Pharaoh Akhenaton has achieved Deification by
communing with the First Sun God and Goddess Ares and Ast and Second Plane Sun God and Goddess Thoth and Mgaat/Neb Het. Hence he can be shown as a leonine bodied Sphinx Figure. For more discussion see Exhibit II_G-1.

GRAPHIC 4.12 above depicts Aten Path Thet Master and Pharaoh Akhenaton, Queen Nefertiti and Two Daughters meditating on the Tree Of Life. Beaming down upon them is the uniquely illustrated "Atannu 7" or the Eighth Spiritual Plane Aten of the Most High God Annu. It emits Annu Khet or Stream Of Cosmic Life Energy through 8 Spiritual Planes to the Physical Plane Of Earth. For a full discussion see Exhibit III_F-1_2 and Exhibit III_F3_4.
In Summary the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) taught a Spirituality
System called the Path Of The Aten. Its Priesthood as we have seen above wore Leopard Skin Smocks, symbolizing the Deification/HU-man Process of conquering the Leopard guarding the entrance into the Spiritual Planes Or Land Of Lights.
Successful Aten Path practitioners who achieved Deification/HU-man Status by traversing the First and Second Spiritual Planes of the Land Of Light were depicted as the
Sphinx/HU Figure. They were depicted with their own Human Heads On The Bodies Of Hawks and more commonly Lions; now being able to commune with the Third Plane Sun
God Ra-Heru-Aakhuti, Hu Or Harmarchis (Greek). See Appendix_I-B for cosmography.
Thus the Sphinx Rock Sculpture symbolizes the Deification process of the Path Of
The Aten taught at the GIZA ROCK PLATEAU COMPLEX COMPLEX including the 3
Great Pyramids and the 2 Sphinx Temples by the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School
of Annu (On).

THE EGYPTIAN MYSTERY “SCHOOL OF ON” (ANNU):
ESOTERIC ATANNUOLOGY, EGYPTOLOGY & RASTAFARIOLOGY
CHAPTER FIVE: SPIRITUALITY DOCTRINES
The Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) was founded during the Predynastic Period and had at its core the aboriginal and esoteric spirituality system called the Aten
Path. Towards the end of the role of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) as the major player in Ancient Egypt/Kemit’s theocratic government and society, the Aten Path was openly revealed to the public at large by “heretic” Pharaoh Akhenaten in the 18 th dynasty circa 1360 BC. During Pharaoh Akhenaten’s rein the newly built city of Akhetaten (Amarna) became the new capital of Egypt/Kemit where the outward social religion was the Aten Path. Pharaoh Akhenaton is historically credited as establishing the first monotheistic religion.
But the Aten Path had been esoterically revealed in the Predynastic or Stone Age Period of Egypt/Kemit by the Supreme Being or Godhead ANNU to the sacred peoples of the sacred Nile River Valley; i.e. to the four black African Anu Peoples. As presented in Chapter 2 herein these culturally connected peoples lived in the Egyptian “Nine Bow” vassal federated states of Nubia, Kush, Meroe and Khenthunnefer respectively located along the entire course of the sacred Nile River from the Delta to the Great Lakes of Central Africa. The spirituality system of the Aten Path was based on the continual Cosmogonic Event described on the 25 th Dynastic Shabaka Stone now in the British Museum itself copied from a Predynastic document.
This continual Cosmogonic Event of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) is postulated today by modern physicists as the “ big bang event”. It is summarized symbolically and metaphysically on the Shabaka Stone as the androgynous Supreme Being called ANNU being formless and alone deciding to create form. Thus from itself ANNU emanated the celestial water of Nun and the “hillock” of the androgynous Sun God Ptah, who in turn emanated the androgynous Sun God Khepera, from whom in turn is created by a series of rounds of similar emanations the Ennead of 9 Sun Gods and Goddesses. The Ennead is composed of the androgynous Sun God Atum who in turn emanates in like manner 4 pairs of Sun Gods and Goddesses who continue to create the celestial universe’s physical matter and life forms. The continual Cosmogonic Event and its Cosmology is as follows:
Eighth Spiritual Plane ______ Most High Godhead Annu (Androgynous) emanates Seventh Spiritual Plane ____ Sun God Ptah (Androgynous) emanates Sixth Spiritual Plane _______ Sun God Khepera (Androgynous) emanates
The Ennead Fifth Spiritual Plane _______ Sun God Atum (Androgynous) emanates Fourth Spiritual Plane _____ Sun God Shu-Ra and Sun Goddess Tef Nut emanate Third Spiritual Plane ______ Sun God Ra Heru Aakhuti (Hu) Sun Goddess Het Heru (Hathor) emanate Second Spiritual Plane ____ Sun God Thoth (An Tchuti, Seth) Sun Goddess Maat (Neb Het) emanate First Spiritual Plane _______ Sun God Asar (confounded with Osiris) Sun Goddess Ast (confounded with Isis) emanate
Physical Plane Earth Solar System _____ Sun God Ra and Sun Goddess Rat

See Appendix I-B for more cosmographic details associating the specific 12 Sun Gods and Goddesses of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) to one of the 8 specific spiritual planes and comparing them with several past and present social religions.
Thus from its beginning in the Predynastic Period the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) simultaneously was monotheistic and pantheistic with a total of 12 sun gods and goddesses; i.e. 11 sun gods and goddesses hierarchically emanated from the Godhead ANNU.
“ Further the Egyptians (said they) first used the appellations of twelve gods (which the Greeks afterward borrowed from them); and it was they who first assigned to the several gods their alters and temples, and first carved figures on stone.” (Paragraph 4)
“ .... The change of the eight gods to the twelve, of whom they deem Heracles one, was made seventeen thousand years before the reign of Amasis.” (Paragraph 43) (Herodotus, History, Book II.) (emphasis added)
Outlined in this section are the major 9 (nine) spirituality doctrines of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu), its spirituality system called the Aten Path (“Path of the Aten 7” or “Path of Atannu”) and its spirituality curriculum as part of the 42 Books of Thoth along with its Greek philosopher student alumni notably Pythagoras, Socrates and Plato. Please
refer to Appendix I-A for a comparison of the spirituality doctrines of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) with its Ancient Egypt/Kemit theocratic rival the Theban
“Sorcery” Lodge School and its antithetical spiritism/spiritualism practices centered upon the outer moon and outer sun worshipping Osiris/Isis- and Amen-Ra god trilogy. This aboriginal forerunner of the Grand Masonic Lodges was located at the Thebes-Luxor metropolis and its priesthood trained such Pharaohs as Thothmoses III, Ramesses I and II.
The spirituality tradition or system doctrines of the Aten Path were derived from the
comparative religious studies of Sant Kirpal Singh Ji most notably his book Crown of Life based on the comparative religious epistemology that although there are and have been many “social religions” that there is but One God and One Reality about knowing that One God called “spirituality”. Thus there is a necessary commonality amongst the world’s spirituality systems; e.g. it is described by the Christians as the “tree of life”, “the word”, “light of god”; by the Muslim Sufis as “Hu”, by the ancient Pythagoreans as the “celestial harmony”, by the Sikhs as Surat Shabd, by the Hindus as Naam to name a few. The descriptive phrases of “celestial sound” and “celestial light” are found without failure in the translations of the great social religions of the world spirituality systems. The spirituality system doctrines of the Aten Path taught by the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) were and still are the only tried and true path to the “salvation of the human soul” no matter what name it is called and what “social religion” one finds oneself a member.

ODE TO SOLOMON #12

AND HE HAS CAUSED HIS KNOWLEDGE TO ABOUND IN ME, BECAUSE THE MOUTH OF THE LORD IS THE TRUE WORD, AND THE DOOR OF HIS LIGHT; 4. AND THE MOST HIGH HATH GIVEN IT TO HIS WORDS, WHICH ARE THE INTERPRETERS OF HIS OWN BEAUTY, AND THE REPEATERS OF HIS PRAISE, AND THE CONFESSORS OF HIS COUNSEL, AND THE HERALDS OF HIS THOUGHT, AND THE CHASTENERS OF HIS SERVANTS. 5. FOR THE SWIFTNESS OF THE WORD IS INEXPRESSIBLE, AND LIKE ITS EXPRESSION IS ITS SWIFTNESS AND FORCE; 6. AND ITS COURSE KNOWS NO LIMIT. NEVER DOTH IT FAIL, BUT IT STANDS SURE, AND IT KNOWS NOT DESCENT NOR THE WAY OF IT. 7. FOR AS ITS WORK IS, SO IS ITS END: FOR IT IS LIGHT AND THE DAWNING OF THOUGHT; 8. AND BY IT THE WORLDS TALK ONE TO THE OTHER; AND IN THE WORD THERE WERE THOSE THAT WERE SILENT; 9. AND FROM IT CAME LOVE AND CONCORD; AND THEY SPAKE ONE TO THE OTHER WHATEVER WAS THEIRS; AND THEY WERE PENETRATED BY THE WORD; 10. AND THEY KNEW HIM WHO MADE THEM BECAUSE THEY WERE IN CONCORD ; FOR THE MOUTH OF THE MOST HIGH SPAKE TO THEM; AND HIS EXPLANATION RAN BY MEANS OF IT: 11. FOR THE DWELLING - PLACE OF THE WORD IS MAN; AND ITS TRUTH IS LOVE, 12. BLESSED ARE THEY WHO BY MEANS THEREOF HAVE UNDERSTOOD EVERYTHING, AND HAVE KNOWN THE LORD IN ITS TRUTH. HALLELUJAH.

EXCERPT FROM PETER THOMPKINS, SECRETS OF THE GREAT PYRAMID
“To {William} Kingsland {author of The Great Pyramid in Fact and in Theory, London, Rider, 1932}
The Book of the Dead, though it appears to be a ritual for funerary rites of a deceased king or high official, was actually a description of the
trials, temptations and difficulties which the {spiritual} adept had to meet and overcome as he progressed from knowledge to knowledge, and from power to power, as he penetrated the superphysical regions from plane to plane.”
“The ultimate goal of initiation, says Kingsland, was ‘the full realization of the essential divine nature of man, the recovery by the individual of the full knowledge and powers of his divine spiritual nature, of that which was his source and origin, but to the consciousness of which is now dead through the ‘Fall of Man’ into the matter and physical life’.”

SCRIPTURE A. CHAPTER 9: MANIFESTATION OF THE LIGHT
THROUGH THE PASSAGE OF HAVING PENETRATED THE REGION OF THE BEINGS OF LIGHT
(1) “What Saith Annui?"
“Hail Soul, mighty of valor! (2) Really I am here! I have come to see thee Soul. I have penetrated into the region of meditation, I have seen (3) (my Soul’s) Father Sun-God Arus 1 st plane. a I have driven away or conquered the darkness (i.e., seen the first plane sun-god’s light via its Aten/Inner Sun). I am His beloved. I have come that I may see (4) my Father the Sun-God Arus. I have stabbed this heart of the God Ansuti\Set(h), doing deeds as would my divine Father Arus. b
(5) The Master opened the Pathway (i.e., “Third Spiritual Eye’s) for me into Heaven. On Earth I am a loving Son of the Earth Guardian Fathers under the Sun-God Arus. (6) I have become free from the body, I have become a Being of the Light, i.e., a spirit of the light, freed from body materialism and mind intellectualism and illusion. I am capable of communicating (communing) with every God. The Blessed Master of Light c makes a Pathway to the Sun-God Arus 1 st plane for me, the scribe Anui, d righteous (perceiving) of the Holy Sound Current Shabd\Creative Word, Annu Khet.”
source hieroglyphics: E. Wallis Budge’s, The Book of the Dead, Papyrus of Ani, Dover ed., pg. 120, 1967; numbers in parenthesis are line numbers. _____________________________________________________ FOOTNOTES:
a. This is the first spiritual plane of Rastau\Rasta or Astral plane which is inhabited and controlled by Sun-God Asar\Aras\Arus. See depiction in EXHIBIT III_B-1 and EXHIBIT III_B-2. This is confounded by the Theban Priest Osiris-Isis Cult with Osiris to rationalize their body resurrection, spiritualism, spiritism, hypnosis and mesmerism practices; and to legitimate their claim to the throne through the Theban Princess’ declared offspring of Osiris’ and lsis’ son Horus.
Thus Isis too is a confounded by the Theban Priests with the 1 st plane solar Goddess Ast. See EXHIBIT II_B-1.
b. The negative connotation to Seth is a Theban priest religious political dogma of the 18th Dynasty against a God who esoterically is the 2 nd Plane Spiritual Plane Sun-God Tchuti. Seth is personified as the devil or satan which in reality is “Magog’ of man’s own failings in the continued struggle with the” 7 sins of Magog” lust, greed, fear, ego, attachments, lies and anger.
Tchuti/Thoth was one of the most popular of the Annu Sun-Gods, patron of its Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu), its 42 Books of Thoth and “Nine Bow” Annu-Sethui Tribe. Yet immediately to the south and Annu-Shasu (Hebrews/Hyksos) and immediately to the north of Egypt/Kemit Proper “Nine Bow’” Tribes #8 & #9 respectively shown in EXHIBIT IV-2. Thus the expression means Anui has conquered the “7 sins of Magog” (lust, greed, fear, ego, attachments, lies and anger).
c. Literally “Aakhu-Neb.”
d. Esoterically, this word is pluralized as “double” inferring Anui the scribe and his wife Thuthu. See Footnote a of Chapter Six, Scripture B. “Introduction to Chapter 18” herein. Anui is the deceased person within whose tomb the ‘Papyrus of Ani” was found. It is no coincidence that this Papyrus was chosen for promulgation by the Egyptologists and that its owners name is almost identical to the ancient Anu Peoples and their various words for spiritual plane sun gods in particular “Annu”. The coverup of the Anu Peoples and the 8 th plane “Most High” God Annu has been shrewd but not totally successful as witness this work!

SCRIPTURE B. INTRODUCTION TO CHAPTER 18: MANIFESTATION OF THE LIGHT
AAT-ANNU MASTER’S * SPEECH
Aat-Annu Master
(1) “What did the Aat-Annu Master say?"
“He said: Two have ascended (from below) to you, divine gods, mighty; who are in Heaven and on Earth. a (2) I have brought to you Inner Sun-God Arus on the first plane, Anui [and his wife]. He has not sinned against any Gods. Grant that he may be with you and the Master of Light." b
ANUI’s SPEECH
(1) in praise of the Sun-God Asar, Lord of Rastau (Rasta), c company of the great gods which is in the Heavens.
What did the Scribe Anui say to the Inner God Asar of the first plane?
(2) He said: Greetings to you, Head of Amentet, ‘the beautiful one’(Nefer-Un) within Abtu. We two (my wife and I) ascend from under you. d My heart is of righteousness. (3) There is no unrighteousness in my body.
I have not told lies to my knowledge. I have not acted with a double motive, (i.e., deceit). Give to me the heavenly food. (4) I have manifested into the light before the visage of the divine offering table. Possessors of Righteousness can go in and out from the Heavens. They need (use) the Path of the Beatified Disciple of the Master b (of the Aten). They can see the Aten (inner spiritual sun). They can see the (5) spiritual moon when they desire at anytime ‘forever'. "

_________________________________________________________ FOOTNOTES:
a. The two are the deceased and his wife. This is verified by picture vignettes ofEXHIBIT II_C showing the two in spirit form; i.e. traveling together on the “Aten Path.” This reflects the Annu Cultural ideal of co-equal wife and husband relationship ......”one flesh” as the Biblical Adam and Eve which of course esoterically was derived fom this Annu Cultural ideal.
b. The “Aat-Annu” Priest erroneously transliterated “An-mut-f” is the Master of Light (and Sound). This explains why he is the one who guided the two “Aten Path” travelers to the first spiritual plane Sun-God Asar, a ‘Perfect Master.
* The Aat-Annu philological analysis is as follows:
- hieroglyph of phonetic value Annu, indicating the 8th plane GODHEAD and the cosmographic hierarchy and infers seership capability to so commune with the GODHEAD on this plane. See Appendix I-B. - determinative indicating is a whole hieroglyphic term. - determinative indicating the giving of Life Energy\Celestial Waters\Annu Khet in manner of indiscriminate loving Mother as the GODHEAD does unfailingly and constantly to all creation; Note used in other hieroglyphic spellings of term. (Budge’s, Dictionary, pg. 59) - determinative indicating female component to Godhead. Godhead is androgynous. - determinative indicating male component to Godhead. - determinative indicating one who hears, Aat the Holy Creative Word\Annu-Khet. from Godhead and is phonetically valued aat. (Budge’s Dictionary, pg. 27)
c. “Rastau\Rasta is the 1st spiritual plane, “astral.” See POEM #8 for its philology and root aggregate of more modern term “Rastafari.”
d. Literally hieroglyphic, esoterically the “3rd eye\Eye of Horus transliterated “a makhu” meaning an initiate of a Master of the “Aten Path.” See Budge’s Dictionary. pg. cxvii and 50.

SCRIPTURE C. “(1)” CHAPTER 46a: MANIFESTATION OF THE LIGHT
WITHOUT PAIN\ANGUISH MERGING WITH THE INNER LIGHTED SOUND (SHABD) OF THE HEAVENS
"What saith Anui to the God Arus (i.e., the first plane Sun-God?”
(2) “Hail, children of the divine light’ (personified as the Sun-God Shu of 4 th plane, (literally the expression is “Hun-Annu Shu”) in the region of the early morning transcendental stars of meditation: Who have the power (of access) to His crown (i.e., His inner sun, the Aten, is seen by them) as “Children\People of the Light” (literally Aakhu-Hammemet).

OF LEAVING THE BODY MERGING WITH THE INNER LIGHTED SOUND (SHARD) OF THE HEAVENS
“With those ‘children of the (2) divine light’ (personified as the Sun-God Shu-Ra, literally the expression is “Hun-Annu Shu-Ra”) a, meditating in the early morning to the second spiritual plane: I have gained the power (of access) to His crown (i.e., His inner sun, the Aten, is seen) of the current of light in the region of sound."

_________________________________________________________ FOOTNOTES:
a. This indicates that ‘children of the light” (Hun-annu-Shu\Henen Shu) and “People of the Light”\Sun People” (Aakhu-Hammemet) are synonyms for those men and women intiated on the ‘Aten\Atannu Path” of light and sound yoga, rising to at least the 3 spiritual beyond matter, emotions and mind.
b. Literally Heru Neb.
c. This alludes to the purification and perfecting process of the System of Spirituality of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu), whereby only those students found worthy by the Aten Path (Master of Light) Guide were allowed and lifted through the door ‘third eye” Into the Land of Light (Kingdom of God). Refer to the Predynastic EXHIBIT I_G depicting the “Thet”, Master Priest dreadlocked as an aboriginal Rastafarian assisting the Annu King/Pharaoh to “leave the physical body tomb” during Aten Path meditation at the Great Pyramid.

SCRIPTURE D. CHAPTER 64a: (LONG VERSION) MANIFESTATION OF THE LIGHT OF HEAVEN
LINES 1 -18
“What Saith Nebsensi about the Divine Master (of light)?”
(2) "I am of the two leopard Gods {i.e., symbolism of having conquered and passed by the “physical difficulties" of leaving the "body tomb" which “guard" the entrance into the "land of light" Heaven}, a giving off light in early morning meditation (3) to His (the Master’s) “children (of the light”). At any other time it is difficult for the Soul to pass through to visit the gods, who give spiritual food to the Beings (spirits) in the proper (right) part of Heaven.
Steering through the (4) wrong (left) parts (of Heaven), the Perfect Master (Seer) directs by His inner light image (i.e., His Light Body). b
The Master gives words of power {i.e., the charged “mantra” words given upon lnitiation} (which) bring people through the darkness. c (5) He transforms spiritually on the plane (in the abode) where resides the perfected ones. Hail to His “double hawks” {i.e., double inner suns of the third spiritual plane where one is “perfected" having crossed the first and second planes of emotions and mind}.
The best of the celestial Beings listen (6) to the words spoken by the Master. His words cause blessings to the inhabitants of the Holy Regions. They (the Masters words) cause the "followers (7) of the Sun-God Ra" to be brought to the plane (place) of the celestial region sanctuary. d The Master stands in the sanctuary upon the very top of the celestial regions (8) from the citadel of earth (while alive in the body). I become the Master, and the Master becomes me. e I am formed of the lights (of Heaven) of the Sun-God Ptah (i.e., the 7 th plane Sun-God), from his primeval matter.
The Sun-God Ra f causes one’s heart to be content, (9) covered (by) the celestial waters of the Inner Lighted Sound Currents (literally Maat-Shuu). One’s happiness, which is the light (of Heaven) from its entrance into Khemannu (i.e., the 2 nd or causal plane); flows out from the dark (left) part (of the Heavens, i.e., the 8 th Plane). The spiritual light causes (10) meditation or adoration on or of the GODHEAD amongst the gods which dwell (in the Heavens).
I hasten along your (the Master's guidance) Pathways (through the Heavens). I move in long strides on your “Path of Athannu" {i.e., the path of the 7 Atens or inner spiritual suns personified and actually Sun-Gods}. (11) I started on the journey (from) earth with the plot (i.e., understanding of the theory of the “Aten Path,” the science of spirituality taught by the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu)}, and the visage of your Goddesses of Light {i.e., the Light and Sound Currents, personified as Tefnut, Het Heru (Hathor), Neb Het (Nephthys), Ast on the highest to the lowest of the respective 4 lowest physical planes}. g
I was in ignorance of (my) soul (i.e., opposite condition of ‘Man, Knowing Himself'). h The GODHEAD speaks to those who enter within (the Heavens by escaping the body) through (12) the ears of the Heavens {i.e., transcendental ear, ‘third ear’ counterpart of the ‘third eye’}.”

SCRIPTURE D. CHAPTER 64a: (LONG VERSION) MANIFESTATION OF THE LIGHT OF HEAVEN (continued)
I am saved from any sins or defects of my mother upon me. i l am protected from (13) the closing of the Divine Eyes in the dark regions (of the Heavens). I come to an end of the celestial waters of the “Great Black Lake” (literally Kem-Ur). j (14) I am filled with the Holy Word (i.e., the Sound Current from the GODHEAD’s emanations, esoterically sounding as His name). My body is covered with His (the GODHEAD’s) light (covering).
Hail, Chief of the Gods, that which dwells in the “Great Black Lake” (Kem-Ur). (You) call or beckon to those who meditate or dwell within their forehead temples. (15) It is at these divine meditation times, wherein the GODHEAD’s Holy Word (i.e., the Inner Lighted Sound Current) carries (those who so meditate) in the manner of returning (to) the celestial regions of his divine, celestial waters (i.e., a “yoga” meditation).
The Master’s power protects (the Initiated disciples) by means of subjugating the sins {unrighteousness of the 7 sins of “Magog,” {greed, lust, fear, attachments, lies, anger and ego} of their mind. k (16) I sit in the right side of (my) head’ (forehead temple, in meditation) amongst the Ur-urti Goddesses {i.e., the 2 SunGoddesses of the God Geb, the Sun Goddess Het-Heru personification of the inner lighted sound currents on the first and second spiritual planes -- Ast (Demeter) and Neb Het (Nephthys) l. I thrust out within the tears of my (inner) vision. (17) I am inclined to behold the spiritual plane of Abtu (lower Astral plane). The fetters (holding me within the ‘body tomb’) are broken by the two Ur-urti Goddesses’ celestial water visage {i.e., the inner lighted sound currents, personified as the Sun-Goddesses Ast (Demeter) and Neb Het (Nephthys)}. (18) One (thus) gains power over those things below. It’s visage (the experience of the inner lighted sound currents) causes me to go through (the heavenly) division or planes, as a greyhound (dog) which catches the scents of the heavenly divisions or planes {and would thus follow that scent}.”

d The “Master’s words” allude not only to the “charged mantra’ words explained in C above, but also to the esoteric reality that these words are audibly connected to the specific sound of the “inner lighted sound’ stream which manifests audibly and uniquely different on each spiritual plane, i.e., here the “Master’s words’ are that celestial sound.

SCRIPTURE D. CHAPTER 64a: (LONG VERSION) MANIFESTATION OF THE LIGHT OF HEAVEN (continued)
FOOTNOTES: (continued)
f Esoterically aboriginally the “Sun-God Ra” was a generic expression for all the 7 sun-gods and specifically to the Yogic practice of the “Aten 7\Atannu Path.” But at the end of the 5th Dynasty dominated by the Annu Pharaoh’s esoterically the School of On (Annu) Priests of the Physcal Plane Sun God Ra joined in treason the priests of the Theban Mystery Lodges and their demonic Amen-Osiris Cult to take over the Theocratic Throne of Egypt/Kemit. Thus from Dynasty 6 onward this term “Sun-God Ra” was degenerated to only a social religion for the masses based on the simple cult worship of the physical plane sun.
g Esoterically the sun-goddesses are personifications of the “inner lighted sound” stream which in reality as it flows from the 5th spiritual plane splits up into 2 currents, i.e. the sun-goddesses are aspects of the duality of the stream below the 5th plane and represent that current useful in meditations back to the spiritual.
h The opposite of “Man\Woman Know Thyself” rising out the body it now knows itself as spirit.
i Esoteric reference to genetic and environmental defects from one’s Mother is a startling revelation reflected in the Eastern teaching of the importance of the conception, pregnancy and up to three year breast feeding periods of traditional and aboriginal parenting skills.
j Esoterically Kem Ur is the spiritual plane synonym of Annu, wherein resides the GODHEAD.
k Again an incredible description of the “Science of Spirituality” DoctrIne which is denoted as Doctrine #8 of Chapter Five and Appendix I-A “Introduction to Spirituality System” as well as Appendix VII-1 as to the role of the Master, who helps each disciple rid his or herself of past life negative karmic actions and need for its compensation by interceding directly at all levels to do penitence with the disciple to eliminate this karmic load via financial, health, reputation trials of relatively minor significance. As Jesus Christ was also a light and sound Master, this is the origin of the myth he "died for sins” which in truth he did repentance with each of his disciples to eliminate their karmic load, since Jesus Christ is now dead, only a living Master can “die for our __ his Deciples’__ sins” now.
l This alludes to the 3 nadis or vital energy channels within the spinal cord linked to the chakras, where the right side one, the Ida esoterically is the “sun” and the left side one, the Pingala, esoterically the moon, and the middle being the Sukhman; each accommodating life energy flow at 2 hour intervals alternating. While meditating it is easier in Sukhman or the being calm time, but difficult in either Ida or Pingala channel times to meditate without being restless. See EXHIBIT III_I1_2. See Kirpal Singh Ji’s Crown of Life.



THE EGYPTIAN MYSTERY “SCHOOL OF ON”
SCRIPTURE E. “(1)” CHAPTER 68: MANIFESTATION OF (2) THE INNER SUN LIGHT
“I have opened the great double doors of heaven, I have opened the great double doors of the world: I have released the restraints of the Earth God Geb. (3) I have opened the temple of the forehead. I have the inner vision of the Gods. Did not the Earth God Geb restrain me strongly? I released the hold by which He fettered me and tormented me (in the body). a
(4) I have opened the passage way “third eye” channel to the Heavens... it has been given to me. I can manifest into the inner sun light through the passage way to the heavens onto whatever plane of the Lord I desire within. I have prevailed or withdrawn b from out of my heart. (5) I have prevailed or withdrawn from out of my breast. I have prevailed or withdrawn from out of my two hands, I have prevailed or withdrawn from out of my two legs and feet. I have withdrawn through my 'third eye” opening C I have prevailed or withdrawn (6) from out of my whole body.
I have gained the power of the sound of heaven (Creative Word, Shabd). I have gained the power over the waters. I have gained the power over this passageway (into the Heavens). (7) have gained the power over the earth gods of the rivers and soil (earth). I have gained the power to change the earth. I have gained the power over the female creative forces within me (8) I have gained the power over the male creative forces with me in the Heavens. d I have gained the Mastery of the laws (spiritual) seeing within me while (alive) upon the earth.
You (plural, to the gods) spoke words not to be opposed by me (saying):
(9) “Behold, let him live upon the bread of the Earth God Geb.” I eat that which is not abominable or unrighteous (no meat, fish, eggs, fowl). I live upon bread made of grains of (spiritual) light and the divine elixir of the red (10) grains of the celestial waters of the celestial river (Hapi, i.e., the light and sound stream). E”
In the abode of the High Priest\Master I sit (in meditation) away from the earth beings. I am caused to see through my forehead temple the pleasant sight of the Solar Goddess Het Heru (i.e., the personification of the Inner Lighted Sound Currents, wherein resides the Solar God Ra-Heru-Aakhuti in the Aten, inner sun disk of the third plane).f It (Het Heru as the light and sound current) causes my forehead temple to become spacious for the Atannu (i.e., the vision of the seven inner suns\Atens of the seven sun-gods of the seven spiritual planes. (11) It (Het Heru as the inner lighted sound current) causes me to advance to the plane of Annu (the 8th plane of the Godhead).
Following the ancient writings of the divine teachings (words of the gods) of the Books of the God Tchuti (Thoth, Seth. Hermes) g ; I have withdrawn from my body’s heart; I have withdrawn from my body’s breast; (12) I have withdrawn through the “third eye” opening; I have withdrawn from my two hands; I have gained control over the waters; I have gained control over the passageway (into the Heavens); I have gained control over the earth gods of the rivers; I have gained control of the earth; I have gained control (13) if the female creative forces within me; I have gained control over the male creative forces (14) within me; I have gained the mastery of the laws of spiritual seeing in the Heavens within me while (alive) on earth.

SCRIPTURE E. “(1)” CHAPTER 68: MANIFESTATION OF (2) THE INNER SUN UGHT (continued)
I am raised up into the Heavens. I am allowed this through the left side of my face by means of the Perfect (right) (15) Spiritual Master. I am allowed by the Master to dwell, to remain for a while in the right part of the Heavens. I partake and place myself in and of the celestial currents winds, those which are of the uraeus\”third eye” Guide. It the inner lighted sound current wind\”guide” causes me to be prepared and perfect.”
source hieroglyphics: E. Wallis Budge’s, Chapters of Coming Forth by Day. The Full
Theban Recension of the Egyptian Book of the Dead, Volume II, pg.
150, London, 1898; numbers in parenthesis are line numbers. ______________________________________________________________________ FOOTNOTES:
a. remarkable description of the “Aten Path” disciple who defeats the “physical body tomb” restraints of the material world’s “earth god Geb” and rises above body consciousness to the god awareness state of viewing the sun-gods of the spiritual planes. Refer to EXHIBIT III_I-1_2 citing the facilitating “Third Eye”.
b. The term “Sekhan” (s-sekhan, pg. 690 of Budge’s Hieroglyphic Dictionary esoterically means the ‘wIthdrawal of life currents or consciousness from that part of the body” in the process of “dying while alive” and rising above the body. The life force during proper meditation upon the “third eye” area just behind and between, the eyebrows and listening to the Holy Word) will rise up through and from the body chakras leaving the body feelings non-existent.
c. Literally, “ra" means third eye opening to the nadi (Sukhman) passageway or channel leading out\into the spiritual planes and esoterically translated as “mouth." See EXHIBIT III_H-1_2 on the “opening of the passageway” ritual which under the Theban Sorcery Lodge’s priesthood corruption degenerated into a spiritism/spiritualism rite of allowing the deceased to talk via the mummy or his or her statute, to those on the earth plane knowing the processes of spiritualism. Refer herein to “spiritism/spiritualism.” A priest or other person served as medium.
d. The reference to male and female forces is based on the androgynous origin of humans, and alludes to the sub-physical chakras vital energy center dimensions and planes of existence wherein resides the various nature, vital forces and entities which have dominion over various bodily functions. There are 7 major chakras each a sub-physical plane, consisting of the crown (top of head), third eye (ethereal plane), throat and tongue, heart, solar plexus (stomach), genital and anal; each ruled over by a planet and a specific color. Spirituality transcends these sub-physical planes in its highest form of “light and sound yoga.” But less appropriate to the times yogas may meditate on these various chakras centers, e.g., Kundalini Yoga meditates on the anal chakras to control “serpent power” which is the body’s vital energy from the “inner lighted sound stream.” Refer to Kirpal Singh Ji’s Crown of Life for indepth comparative Yoga analysis.
e. ‘Abominable food” undoubtedly is flesh food of 4 legged animals, birds, fish, Insects and eggs thereof, since strict vegetarianism was a requirement for entrance into the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) and its “Aten Path” or light and sound yoga. Refer to Appendix II-A for specific proof. Reference to the spiritual bread and celestial waters allude to the Master and his linkage of the disciple to the “inner lighted sound” current ..... bread and water respectively.
f. Confirmation that Solar Goddess Het Heru as well as the other 3 sun-goddesses personifies the stream of “light and sound’ life energy (Annu Khet: Ankh) that emits from the sun-god Ra-Heru-Aakhut\HU of the third spiritual plane, is given in the ancient Egyptian myth (source hieroglyphs from 19th Dynasty King’s tombs circa 1300 B.C.) “The Destruction of Mankind” in E. Wallis Budge’s The Gods of the Egyptians V.1:
“Let go forth thy emission of Life Energy from thine eye (Sun-God Ra-Heru Aakhuti’s Aten), let it {however} destroy those whose blaspheme with wickedness. No mans eye can resist your beam of light and sound {literally } when It goeth down in the form of Het Heru. This Goddess then went forth and slew those {wicked} people hiding in the mountains.” (pg. 392 lines 5-8, retranslated by George ”Aakhun“ Singleton).
See Exhibit II_B-2_3 as Het Heru is depicted as the cow in the Annu Khet “light and sound’ stream.
Compare with the “light and sound” stream HU terminology used by Sufi Muslims in Appendix I_D-3. Esoterically, a HU-man is an evolved homo sapien who has learned to listen to the “inner lighted sound stream” termed “HU” on the third spiritual plane depicted in Exhibit III-E.
g. A remarkable statement identifying the 42 Books of Thoth/Hermes of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) as the “science of spirituality” written knowledge the “Aten Path” disciple studied on his or her successful journey through the 7 spiritual planes to the 8th” plane Godhead Annu. This proves the source of this chapter as the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu), and the key role of the now “missing” 42 Books of Thoth/Hermes in their “system of soul salvation,” as well as the access to magical powers which the nature forces control.

“One of the biggest illusions and contradictions is ‘race’, which
confounds people of all colors and cultures. In particular it must be
understood that culture not color is the determinate factor in group
dynamics in an ideal state of group consensus and action. Yet
shrouded in mystery is the fact that not all b!ack colored people on
earth are descendants from the aboriginal black African Anu
Peoples (aNubians, Kush, Meroe and Anu Antiu) who established
the great civilization known commonly as ancient Egypt/Kermit.
Those who would understand must study the cultural antithesis of
the “Garden of Eden” Anu Peoples and contrasting culture with the
pastoral and animal herding culture called the “snake” in the Bible
Genesis...called the “Scythians" by Herodotus, the "Father of
History.” Cultural identity not skin color is the key. ‘Toleration for
all..... For all are One’ is the rule. The Caucasian or Aryan races
include black skinned people often confused as black Africans; i.e.
the mixed blood Eritrian (Punt), Ethiopian (Sheba) and Samolian
peoples known as the ‘Hamites’.
That there is but ‘one race’ the human race is proven continuously
by the mixture of races and the human gene pool. Miscegenation
results in offsprings being fully fertile. In contrast the now extinct
Tasmanian race was incapable of producing fertile offspring upon
race mixing with humans.”

From Raymond H. Wooley, “Men and Women of Color”, International Bible, Inc. Langley Park, MD. Page 29, 1977 :
“During his period, the third millennium B.C. [Dynastic Period of Egyptology], much of Nubia (another name for Cush) to the south of Egypt was under Egyptian influence, if no under is control. Quite probably, in earlier times [the Pre-dynastic Period of Atannuology] there was probably no appreciable differentiation between Egypt and Nubia___ the peoples mingled freely. But eventually a distinction developed. The Egyptians were of a dark hue and black-haired, but the Nubians seem to have been of an even darker complexion, and some were said to have had woolly hair.”
“The Egyptians eventually disinquished themselves from the Nubians by calling the latter Negroes. In fact, there is some dispute over whether Egypt was not originally Negro and only replaced by those whose ancestry included a mingling of Asiatic peoples. A noted Sengalese writer of modern times[Cheikh Anta Diop) asserts that ‘the Egyptian experiment was essentially Negro, and all Africans can draw the same moral advantage from that as Westeners draw from Graeco-Latin civilization.’ [Cheikh Anta Diop, “The Cultural Contributions and Prospects of Africa,” Proceedings of the First International Conference of Negro Writers and Artists,
Presence Africaine, Special Issue, June-November, 1956, cited by Joseph E. Harris, Africans and Their History {New York: Times Mirror}, p. 23] “

#2 THE EARTH’S ORIGINAL CONDITION OF HUMANS: The Garden of Eden Golden Age
(1) THE EARTH’S GARDEN OF EDEN (ATEN) WAS A GOLDEN AGE, (2) WHERE FOOD WAS BOUNTIFUL AND "HU-MEN" WERE SAGES: (3) WHERE PEACEFUL LOVE REIGNED FOR HEAVEN WAS RIGHT THERE NEAR, (4) AN AVERAGE LIFE SPANNED ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY YEARS; (5) THE BIBLE’S GENESIS BOOK MAKES IT PLAIN,
(6) ABOUT GOD’S “ORIGINAL CONDITION” EARTH PLAN:
(7) THAT PROPER “HU-MAN” SURROUNDINGS IS A GARDEN. a
(8) NOT EATING “TREE OF EVIL” (ANIMAL) FLESH IS THE LAWn; b (9) THAT PROPER “HU-MAN” DIET IS OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES, (10) FOR THERE ARE MORE THAN TWELVE HUNDRED PLANTS EDIBLE, c (11) THAT PROPER DISEASE PREVENTION AND CURES ARE HERBS, (12) FOOD AND MEDICINAL FOR THE LAW’S BEEN DISTURBED; d
(13) THAT PROPER “HU-MAN” MATES IS ONE MAN WITH ONE WOMAN, (14) FOR ADAM AND EVE AS “ONE FLESH” WITH GOD DID STAND; (15) THAT PROPER HEALTH IS BODIES AND MINDS PURIFIED, (16) WITH WOMEN AMENSES AND MEN UNCIRCUMCISED; e (17) THAT PROPER “HU-MAN” HOUSING IS IN GARDENS SIMPLY, (18) BEING CLOSE TO NATURE, BEING BUILT EASILY; (19) THAT PROPER “HU-MAN” LEARNING IS “BIOLOGY” (20) STUDY OF BIRTH, LIFE, DEATH AND ECOLOGY; (21) THAT PROPER “HU-MAN” ECONOMICS IS COOPERATIVE, (22) SELF-RELIANCE FULFILLS MUTUAL NEEDS: (23) THAT PROPER “HU-MAN” TO BEAST GUIDE IS GUARDIAN, (24) AS WITH PEOPLE WE MUST EXTEND A HELPING HAND;
(25) THAT PROPER “H U-MAN” LEISURE SHOULD BE IN SERVICE, (26) TO VOLUNTEER FOR THE NEEDY SPREADS HAPPINESS; (27) THAT PROPER “HU-MAN” RULE IS TRUE DEMOCRACY, (28) FULL CONSENSUS, “GOLDEN RULE” ARE PREREQUISITES;
(29) THAT PROPER “H U-MAN” GOAL IS “WALKS WITH THE LORD,”
(30) AS DID CAIN, ENOCH, MOSES THROUGH THE “FOREHEAD DOOR” (31) THUS IN THE GOLDEN AGE PEOPLE ARE GODS, “HU-MAN,” (32) THE GODHEAD’S SOUND “HU” IS LISTENED TO BY “MAN”; (33) THE “INNER LIGHTED SOUND” INVITES MEDITATION, (34) SUCH PRACTICE IS THE “ORIGINAL RELIGION.” _________________________________________________________ FOOTNOTES: a The aboriginal natural environment of humans is a sustainable agri-forest like the proverbial “Garden of Eden. Modern psychology knows the benefits of “horticultural therapy” to those with mental illnesses, physical illness and social dysfunctions as criminality and abusive behavior and abusive damage.
b Nature’s Law of vegan/vegetarian diet, was the only rule in the Garden of Eden:
(Genesis 1:11) “Then God said: Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb that yields seed, and the fruit tree that yield fruit according to its kind, whose seed is in itself, on the earth’; and it was so. (Genesis 1:29) And God said, See, I have given you every herb that yields seed which is on the face of all the earth, and every tree whose fruit yields seed, to you it shall be for food. (Genesis 2:16) “And the Lord God commanded the man saying, ‘Of every tree of the garden you may freely eat; (Genesis 2:17) But of the tree of knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die.”
Esoterically, the “tree of the knowledge of good and evil” symbolizes the life decision: to follow Nature’s Law of vegan/vegetarianism or to of animal flesh eat and reap its penalties of loss of spirituality (God communion\ walks with God), poor health and higher chance of a shortened life span.
c “ . . . 600 edible fruits, 100 cereals, 200 nuts, and 300 vegetables. (Kellogg, Natural Diet of Man, pg. 15)
d ‘Most disease is caused by breaking Nature’s Law of a vegan/vegetarianism or immoral livelihood -see Appendix I I-B.
e “If the female body is perfectly clean through this (Garden of Eden} diet, the menstruation disappears.” ArnoId Ehret, Ibid., pg. 176) On the subject of “amenses women” refer to the extract from Arnold Ehret’s Mucusless Diet Healing System and the extract from Vicktoras Kulvinskas’ Survival into the 21 St Century.

(18) THE GARDEN (OF EDEN) SHALL GROW OVER EARTH AGAIN IN A SHORT WHILE: (19) THEN STARVATION, VIOLENCE, GOD PUTS ON TRIAL; (20) THEN ANIMALS EAT NO FLESH NOT EVEN BARN OWLS; (21) THEN EARTH TURNS RIGHT-SIDE UP, AIR, WATER UNFOULED; c (22) THEN SEASONS CHANGE SO THERE'S NO STORMS OR SNOW PILES; d (23) THEN DESERTS TURN ORCHARDS, ONCE EXTINCT BEASTS RUN WILD; (24) THEN WOMEN HAVE PURE BODIES NOT MENSES DEFILED; e (25) THEN POLYGAMY ENDS, GIRL-BOY NUMBERS EQUALED;

FOOTNOTES:
a Refer to Appendix Il-B Section I for the use of enemas by the ancient Egyptians as a sickness prevention measure monthly, believing bad diet brings the onset of disease.
b “Master of Rastau” poetically means the Perfect Master of Light and Sound Yoga. See Chapter Seven POEM #8 including footnote a; shows “Rastau” means the “astral spiritual plane.”
c When earth is in its normal astronomical position, its magnetic and geographic poles coincide, and Its north pole is magnetically positive.
d Earth beings upside down and necessarily off the axis, the seasons and storms, ice and snow, drought and deserts are largely caused by the uneven distribution of sunlight over the planet, where complete darkness plagues the north and south arctic circles most of the annum. See Exhibit I_A. Practically, it would take a longer time after the other conditions of “Heaven on Earth” are reached for this “final correction” to take place - and is not a prerequisite for “Earth Heaven. At such time the ice caps, snow storms and violent storms of all types would cease to exist: A peaceful spring and summer continuum would ensue over the entire planet.
e The “amenses” condition is based on proper human sexuality where coitus is limited to voluntary conception and the monthly ‘infertile” period, where other non-coital, normal human sexuality is practiced “celibacy”; and are based on a Garden of Eden diet of naturally grown largely fresh fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds. Refer to Ehret’s Mucusless Diet Healing System and Kulvinskas’ Survival into the 21st Century for details.
“.... .ln scripture it {amenses} is called by the significant word ‘purification - which it in fact is; clean no longer polluted by the monthly flow of impure blood and other waste” (Ehret, Ibid., pg. 176)
“Comparing the modern woman to the less sophisticated one, we note that menstruation is less a problem among primitive peoples (124): ‘One is astounded at the apparent cleanliness of the vagina in Navajo women who know nothing of douches and personal hygiene. Few Navajo women wear undergarments and the great majority apparently do not use perineal pads during menstruation.’ (Footnote 124 from the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, May 1951)” quoted from the Viktoras Kulvinskas, Survivial into the 21 st Century, page 173.

FOOTNOTES:
a These “sorcerers” who exploit the laws of Nature and are many times disguised as “scientists” and “doctors” are of the Theban Priesthood’s institutions and traditions, who have been empowered on earth for thousands of years now.
“Priests (of the Theban Priesthood lineage} have used telepathic mass-hypnosis to dominate whole nations. Today they still function on a worldwide scale by mental means. Their evil operates through telepathic bidding of the mentalists. These instruments are readily recruited from among those persons who are inclined to fear, to hate, to lust for power, and to seek privilege over others. The people who fall into the grip of the insidious, unbelievably clever mentalists are characteristically arrogant in their belief that they are especially qualified to rule over others and often believe themselves to be divinely inspired and unable to do wrong.”
“Egypts {Theban} priests mastered the mental ability to impose their will upon others telepathically. They also learned how to “tune in” on the thoughts of others and thus maintain surveillance on their enemies telepathically.”
(Anonymous Author, The Ultimate Frontier, pg. 72 emphasis added)
NOTE: “Telepathically” means via hypnosis\mesmerlsm - see Appendice_I_A.

FOOTNOTES:
a See Dedication herein for Sant Kirpal Singh Ji’s Word or Naam citing the Aten Path” identical match with the Light and Sound/Surat Shabd Yoga .
b Spirituality is a science being a personal experience of self-analysis, self-knowledge and god-knowledge within the laboratory of the body temple, based on unchangeable laws and doctrines which can be practically demonstrated. The Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) “System of Salvation of the Soul” using George James’ Stolen Legacy terminology, had as its core spiritual science the ‘Path of the Aten 7\Atannu. See Appendix VII-3 - Question\Answer #14 and Appendix VII-3 - Question\Answer #19 on Surat Shabd Yoga as being of the " Science of Spirituality” that can be practiced by anyone in any ‘social religion’ -- not being Occultism or a religious cult.
c The word “Egyptian” comes from the Greek word Aegyptius and is a monument to the ancient Anu People’s practice of “Aten Path” spirituality. The Egyptian Anu People and Phoenicians having colonized Greece aboriginally as a defense against barbarian country of nation of Scythia and its allies :
“.... .the Greek work Aegyptius is usually derived from the Egyptian Khi-Khu-Ptah, which means the temple of the soul of Ptah.” (Chek Anka Diop, African Origin of Civilization, pg. 186)
“.....the sacred name of {Memphis\Men-nefert, an Annu city just nearly south west from On or the city of Annu of the North} is Het Ptah-Ka, and means the ‘temple of the genius of Ptah’ ... from this name it seems that the Greek name for Egypt (Aegyptius) is derived.” (Wallis Budge, Mummy. pg. 10).
NOTE: That “Athens”, Greece derives its name from the “ Aten or Athen Path” and that Socrates was a “Ra-Athen” Initiate - teacher. Esoterically, the progressive elements of he Greeks revered their cultural teachers the Anu Egyptians so deeply they gave them the highly respectful name “Aegyptius” as the Anu People were so divinely filled with the Godpower, specifically the Sun God Ptah of the 7th spiritual plane. Ptah is depicted wearing the “anu cap” which the Egyptian Mystery School of On priests wore. See Exhibit I_E-1_2.

FOOTNOTES:
a The mysterious “Land of the Gods” - literally Khenthunnefer the Egyptian’s land of their ancestors and origin of the Sun Gods and Goddesses is esoterically the Nile Great Lakes and surrounding sea coasts including “South Africa” loaded with minerals, forests and water resources as today. See the Exhibit series of Exhibits Part IV, Section 2: Pharaoh Queen Hatshepsut’s Punt Expedition showing Queen Hatshepsut’s Paunt expedition. Note the returning Egyptian ships being loaded with African goods including giraffes. See MAP 2.
b “. . . (A. Ame’lineau), after his tremendous finds (Abydos Royal Burial site) and his in-depth study of Egyptian society, reaches the following conclusions of major importance for the history of mankind:
‘From various Egyptian legends, I have been able to conclude that the populations settled in the Nile Valley were Negroes. since the Goddess Isis (Ast) was said to have been a reddish black woman. In other words, as I have explained, her complexion is cafe’ au lait (coffee with milk), the same as that of certain other blacks whose skin seems to cast metallic reflections of Cooper’ (Prolegomenes a l’etude Ia religion egyptienne, 1916, part 2, pg. 124)”
“Ame’lineau designates the first... race to occupy Egypt (which was Black} by the name Anu. He shows that they came slowly down the Nile and founded the cities of Esneh {Anlt}, Erment {Ament\Southem Annu}, Qouch {Qes}, and Heliopolis {On, Northern Annu} for he says:
‘All those cities have the characteristic symbol which serves to denote the name Anu. (Footnote Hieroglyph,: an arrow with two feathers or reeds {phonetic value am, aun’s). It is also in an ethnic sense that we must read the term Anu applied to Osiris (An)) “(Ibid. pg. 124-125)” (emphasis added, from C.A. Diop’s African Origin of Civilization, pg. 76). See MAP 1.
“(One of the) . . . earliest theory of salvation is the Egyptian theory. The Egyptian Mystery System had as its most important object, the deification of man, and taught that the soul of man (Aakhu,) if liberated from its bodily fetters, could enable him to become Godlike and see the Gods In this life and attain the beatific vision and hold communion with the Immortals (C.H. Vail, Anc, Mys., pg. 25).”
Plotinus was born in Egypt 205 A.D., died in Rome 270 A.D., and was a philosopher trained in Ancient Egypt/Kemit by Ammonius Saccas of the underground Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) spirituality tradition. He defines the mystic experience as:
“the liberation of the mind from its finite consciousness, when it became one and is identified with the Infinite. This liberation was not only freedom of the soul from bodily impediments, but also from the wheel of reincarnation or rebirth. It involved a process of disciplines of purification both for the body and the soul. Since the Mystery System offered the salvation of the soul it also placed great emphasis upon its immortality.” (from George James’ Stolen Legacy, pgs. 27 and 28)
c “The Egyptian Mystery System was (among) the first secret Order(s) of History and the publication of its teachings was strictly prohibited. This explains why Initiates like Socrates did not commit to writing their philosophy, and why the Babylonians and Chaldeans (part of the “Nine Bow” Nations) who were very closely associated with them also refrained from publishing these teachings.” (from George James’ Stolen Legacy, pg. 4)
d “They (the ‘Nine Bow’ Tribe Sha-Ansu *#9 Exhibit IV-2) lived chiefly upon the milk of their flocks, and the fruit of the date palm. (from Maspero, Dawn of Civilization, pg. 350 Footnote #9)
“According to Ame’lineau, this Black race, the Anu, probably created in prehistoric times all the elements of Egyptian civilization which persist without significant change throughout its long existence. These Blacks were probably the first to practice agriculture, to irrigate the valley of the Nile, build dams, invent sciences, arts, writing, the calendar.” See Exhibit I-J for the Anu Peoples’ predynastic agriculture and irrigation practice.”
“They created the cosmogony contained In The Book of the Dead, texts which leave no doubt about the Negroness of the race that contained the Ideas.”
“These Anu . . . were an agricultural people, raising cattle on a large scale along the Nile, shutting themselves up in walled cities for defensive purposes.”
“To this people we can attribute, without fear of error, the most ancient Egyptian books, The Book of the Dead and the Texts of the Pyramids consequently all the myths or religious teachings. I would add almost all the philosophical system then known and still called Egyptian.” (Amelineau, Ibid, pgs. 257 – 258, from Chek Anka Diop’s African Origin of Civilization, pg. 77) (emphasis added).
Note: It is believe that cattle not native to Africa were first brought in by the Scythian derivative Theban Invader Peoples in Predynastic Egypt/Kemit as corroborated by Herodotus’ observation that the Ancient People of Egypt did not eat cattle.

(68) AS IF THEIR NILE VALLEY CULTURE NEVER HAPPENED; (69) GREEKS, JEWS, ARABS AND EUROPEANS ARE CREDITED (70) BLACK (AFRICAN ANU PEOPLE) ANNU KNOWLEDGE BY THOSE WHO ARE BIGOTED; (71) MYSTERY SCHOOLS OF ON (ANNU) HAVE BEEN RAZED TO THE GROUND, (72) THEIR BOOKS OF THOTH STOLEN, COPIED HAVE NOT (YET) BEEN FOUND. __________________________________________________________________ FOOTNOTES:
a See Exhibit IV-1, Exhibit IV-2 and Appendix III-B for the identification of the Theban Abyssians and Egyptian invaders as the “sons of Ham" Havillah and Ludim of Bible’s Genesis 10:7,13 the so-called “dynastic race’ of Hamitic peoples; esoterically grafted on assimilated peoples to the aboriginal Predynastic Anu culture of black African peoples.
The “Thebans” racially were mixed brown (India's Dravidian) and white Scythian {“Magog”) culturally “Namon Gog’ barbarians of Asia and Europe respectively.
b The mystery, confusion and controversy as to the identity of the First Dynastic Egyptian Pharaoh Mena Identified by historians Herodotus and Menthos and “Kings Lists” documents is esoterically solved by identifying Pharaoh Khasekhem\Khasekmui as one and the same and Mena. He changed his name for Khasekhem to Khasekmui upon unifying Egypt under both Annu andTheban invader peoples building his capital at Men-nefer (Memphis). The conventional exoteric Egyptology holds Annu King Narmer as Menu based on the orthodox interpretation of Narmers Palette presented as Exhibit IF-1 and Exhibit I-F-2 especially with the two lions being lassoed and held in check. However, King Narmer’s tomb relics show that the same “Mena’ is not identified with him although ‘men" meaning winery is found on a clay winesealing. Alternately Anu King Aha - Narmers supposed son is theorized as Narmer by some. Yet both of these Mena identifications are incorrect. For esoterically these kings were forerunners of King Khasekhem who is Mena based on the following:
- wine scalings with “Mena" and Men-nefer. his capital were amongst tomb relics. - he uses both Seth and Theban (Horus) symbols in his name, - placing him as Dynasty #2 King #9 Pharaoh does not hold since his name is found on the King’s Annal Fragment ‘ Palermo Stone’ earlier than that time, and by. - placing the first two dynasties in Thin is as capital violates his capital as Memphis (Men-nefer). This is emphasized not only by Herodotus and Manetho but are on the “Shabaka Stone” treaty.
C This will be fully explained in the forthcoming Volume II, the exoteric first and second dynasties are Predynastic Annu reigns during the Theban invasion wars under their War God “Amen.”
For descriptive location of the “Nine Bow” tribes, see Exhibit IV-2 and MAP 2. For the wars directed by Theban Egyptians against the Anu Peoples is the following evidence; esoterically of pre-Mena Predynastic times:
- ‘Smiting of the Anu’ from Register 3. 2 spaces from the right in the Egyptian Kings Annal fragment (Palermo Stone’). - ‘Khesef (Anu) Antiu repulse of the (Anu) Antiu {Nine Bow Tribe} #6 - the name of the festival that commemorated a great defeat of the enemies of {Theban} Egypt in Predynastic times.

a The Holy Garanth by the 4th Guru after Nanak 1450 A.D. has become the Sikh religion’s holy scriptures.
b A Golden Age Band of mystic musicians will resound or play the music of God’s Edenic plan on Earth. Mystic musicians with their “third eyes\ears” opened, dedicated to work for God and walk with the Godhead Annu.
c Note from Appendix I-B that the “mysterious’ 12 Egyptian Sun-gods\goddesses were copied by the Greeks cosmography of 12 gods\goddesses.
Kirpal Singh Ji in Naam or Word also identifies Socrates as an Aten Path” adherent and teacher. Aristophanes’ comedy play the Clouds reportedly says that Socrates taught the religion of “rotation”, which esoterically means “Ra-Aten”. See George James, Stolen Legacy, pg. 35.
Note that the city Athens Greece was named after the “Path of Aten”, with “Aten” many times being transliterated and spelled “Athen.” That Greece was a colony aboriginally of Ancient Egypt/Kemit is clear, long before it conquered Egypt and plagiarized its knowledge during the Ptolemy period.
d The esoteric overall purpose of George James’ Stolen Legacy and Check Anka Diop’s African Origin of Civilization works both appearing in 1954 was to spread the truth of the black African Anu Peoples’ Cultural contribution of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) to Western Civilization and thus end “racism” based on black African inferiority ending Black African heritage self-negativity. Though James’ nor Diop’s books do not differentiate the Anu Peoples’ cultural elements from the Invader Peoples called the Theban/Scythian cultural elements in Ancient Egypt/Kemit, it is highly recommended that these books be read and their truths communicated to others. The need to change historical education is critical as the United Nations has begun from Check Anka Diop’s historical Egyptology Conference under UN sponsorship on the question of Ancient Egyp/Kemit’s linquistic and cultural foundation derived from black Africa.
e Ideally “Rastafari”, the “cream of the Sun People” priest students of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu), has been reinstituted to help return the “Golden Age.” See Chapter Seven POEM #8 for the formulation of these 21st Century “mystic schools” and “mystic musicians.”

a Reggae Musician Bunny Wailer states “ Rastafari means head creator in Amharic.” (Reggae Times Calender, 1986, pg. 36). This Ethiopian Amharic definition is close to the aboriginal meaning from the older language of hieroglyphics of Ancient Egypt/Kemit which is esoteric denoting “one who communes with the God of the Rastau or Astral Spiritual Plane.”
See Chapter Six Scripture B. Introduction to Chapter 18 - Introduction line 1 of ‘Annui’s Speech for its use as such herein.
b Esoterically Rastafari” is a synonym for ‘lsraelite” – see Chapter Seven POEM #7E Footnote C.
c Nazarites are mentioned in Bible Numbers 6:1-8 (Law of Nazareth) and Judges 13:15 on Samson. The “Law of Nazareth” is somewhat corrupted. This is to be expected being a later Israelie derivative of the Rastafari High Priests and Priests and Priestesses of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) as founded by Moses esoterically Pharaoh Akhenaten circa 1350 BC. The Bible Pentateuch (first five books including Numbers) was written by Moses in Hieroglyphics of Ancient Egypt/Kemit Moses’ native tongue. The Nazarite Law would have been translated from Hieroglyphics to Hebrew by the Israelie High Priest Ezra circa 900 BC.

ITS THROUGH LIVING SIMPLY THAT WE CAN BECOME STRONG, FEWER NEEDS AND WANTS MAKE IT HARD TO DO US WRONG; IT’S THROUGH MUTUAL HUMILITY THAT UNITES, SEEING THE ONENESS OF OUR SOULS CAN PREVENT FIGHTS; IT’S THROUGH GOD SERVICE THAT WE CAN EARN “HU-MAN BIRTH,” TENDING PLANTS, ANIMALS, PEOPLE AND THE EARTH. “SELF STUDIES” IS THE ONLY TRUTH ALTERNATIVE: CHOOSE TO SERVE GOD AS THE RIGHTEOUS PEROGATIVE; STUDY OF THE ARTS, NATURE AND “MAN KNOWN THYSELF,” ARE PRIORITIES THAT BRING EVERLASTING WEALTH. a “KINGS” AND “QUEENS” ARE BEING PREPARED TO FOCUS INWARD, JOIN THEM IN GOD’S FREE “HU-MAN DEVELOPMENT CENTERS” THE SCHOOL OF ON (ANNU) MUST BE THE PROTOTYPE DEMAND, TRANSFORMS A HOMO SAPIEN TO A “HU-MAN”

ITS THROUGH GOD’S LIGHT AND SOUND THAT ONE STOPS LIFE’S DESPAIR, IT (“ANKH: ANNU KHET”) CREATES\SUSTAINS ALL, BECAUSE GOD CARES; IT’S THROUGH TRUE KNOWLEDGE THAT BRINGS FREEDOM,
REINCARNATE\KARMIC DOCTRINES SHOWS GOD’S KINGDOM; IT’S THROUGH A MASTER’S MERCY THAT WE CAN BE “HUMAN GODS,” AS “ATEN PATH” INITIATES WE’LL BEAT THE ODDS. b

d Refer to Appendix Vll-6 “Toward a New Education” from Sant Kirpal Singh Ji, The Night is a Jungle for the theoretical, philosophical formula for “HU-Man Development Centers” modeled after the successful one in India; based on the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) model.The sound “HU” which is also the Ancient Egypt/Kemit hieroglyphic name for the Sphinx Rock Sculpture, is the highest manifestation of the “Holy Creative Word”. See Appendix, I-D Sections D & E, and Chapter Seven POEM #2.

As Sant Kirpal Singh Ji’s “Toward a New Education” in the Night Is a Jungle (Ibid.) and Sant Darshan Singh Ji’s Secrets of Secrets (‘Education” chapter) point out, modern education fails to prepare HU-mans. Unlike the Ancient Egypt Mystery Schools of Annu (On) and those in India they fail to 1) teach ethical principle of being HU-man in harmony with nature as opposed to the carte blanch of Homo sapiens, and 2) teach the "Science of Spirituality,” i.e., the “Path of Atannu” based on comparative religion methodology. Without ethics and spirituality education, there can be socialization and job oriented programming at best; leading to materialism, divisionism and ignorance of the oneness of the entire creation. An “Earth Crisis” is thus inevitable until education is properly corrected to reflect these esoteric truths.

FOOTNOTES:
a By approximately 1250 B.C., 100 years after Moses’ Exodus and establishment of Israel the theocratic base of the Aten Path; Theban Egyptian Pharaoh Seti I conquered Israel in the name of Amen-Set, “Set” having been transformed into a demonic god unlike the original Second Spiritual Plane Sun-God Seth/Tchuti/Thoth/Hermes. The “Israel Stele” of Pharaoh Seti I document this victory. A Theban priest influenced Bel\Baal Golden Calf (Bacchus) cult was established with Jehovah being its general god ....the revenge seeking god of the Old Testament.
b Moses’ Aten Path in Israel was given to the Essene Jewish sect following strictly his teachings upon the Adonis Path . . . Adonis being the 5th plane sun god corresponding to Aten of the Egyptians - See Appendix I-B.
“There would be a short way of proving our thesis that the Mosaic religion is nothing else but that of ATEN: namely, by a confession of faith, a proclamation. But I am afraid I should be told that such a road is impractical. The Jewish creed, as is well known, says: ‘Schema Jisroel Adonai Elohenu Adona Echod’. If the similarity of the name of the Egyptian ATEN (or Atum) to the Hebrew word Adonai and the Syrian divine name Adonis is not a mere accident, but is the result of a primeval unity in language and meaning, than one could translate the Jewish formula:
‘Hear, 0 Israel, our God ATEN (Adonai) is the only God’. I am alas, entirely unqualified to answer this question and have been unable to find very little about it in the literature concerned,...”
‘Only a few passages in Weigal {Aakhunaten} pp. 12, 19; ‘The god ATEN, who described Re as the setting sun, was perhaps of the same origin as ATEN, generally venerated in Northern Syria.’
‘A foreign Queen, as well as her suite, might therefore have been attracted to Heliopolis rather than to Thebes ...“
“but probably we had better not make things so simple.”
(Sigmund Freud, Moses and Monotheism, pg. 27)
Esoterically, in the light that Moses was lkhnaton-Aakhunaten, things are just that simple.
c As Sigmund Freud and others have observed, Ezra’s translations and the Theban Egyptian incursion into Israel shows up as two Moses and replacement of the Adonis Path Essenes as the dominant force in Israel’s theocracy to the Theban priest influenced Pharisee\Sadducee Priests, i.e., the Levites.
d E. Wallis Budge’s Mummies and Egyptian Magic presents significant evidence of Nectanibus lI’s escape and influence on the Macedonian Greece royal family, as well as the Theban priests’ sorcery methods displayed by Alexander the Great under the name of “Ammon.”
e History’s disclosure that Macadonian King Alexander the Great sent an expedition to conquer Upper Egypt (Ethiopia od antiquity)\Sudan which was completely destroyed is suspect, for Alexander would not attack an Amen worshiping nation, nor did he have the pattern of sending expeditions out without going with it. Alexander’s going to the oracle of Amen at Seine would have curtailed this also. His sending an army to conquer Sheba\Abyssinia is acceptable.
f The Indian’s stopped Macedonia King Alexander the Great with the first of several armies it had assembled, saving the Far East from the Theban Priesthood. Remnants of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) Mystery went underground and fled Egypt and Israel, etc. into India, including Pakistan in the case of the Hunza People of Hunza Province, Pakistan; leaving Africa\Middle East virtually without schools of spirituality “Sun People” (3rd spiritual plane and higher) Masters. The mantle of spirituality moved in 1989 to America leaving Pakistan\lndia; e.g., Jesus having been initiated in Egypt’s Great Pyramid had to travel to Tibet and India to gain “perfect” Master access and higher esoteric knowledge training. Sant Rajinder Singh resides in the U.S.A.
g Refer to George James’ Stolen Legacy for specific detail of this Greek Theban plagiarism.
h Referring to the Bible Deuteronomy 27:14-26, such practice or end of prayer “Amen” was set up by the priests’ clan of Levites of Israel professional priests under the Theban priesthood’s influence following Jehovah and not the “Adonis Path.”
i Edmond Szekeley’s Essene Gospel of Peace Book I and Gospel of Peace Book IV, Robinson’s (ed.) Gnostic\Nagamadi Bible “Discourse on 8th and 9th” shows conclusively that Jesus Christ’s vegetarian/vegan dietary teachings were Essene Hebrew as derived from Moses who was an Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) graduate. Thus Jesus taught a “science of spirituality” as demonstrated in the vegan/vegetarian mandate of his Deciples and the Light and Sound Yoga as he indicated in the Bible, Matthew 6: 22 “The light of the body is the eye; if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.”

(13) BUT WHEN CAIN WAS SWITCHED TO ABEL, ABEL TO CAIN, (14) EZRA FAILED TO SWITCH PRONOUNS IN THIS LINE THE SAME: (15) {GENESIS 4:7 SAID TO CAIN BY THE LORD, AFTER REJECTING CAIN, (16) OFFERING AND ACCEPTING ABEL’S ANIMAL FLESH OFFERING: (17) “...AND UNTO THEE CAIN SHALL BE HIS ABEL’S DESIRE, AND, (18) THOU (CAIN) SHALT RULE OVER HIM (ABEL).”} (19) WHICH SHOULD HAVE READ AFTER THE SWITCH FROM ABEL TO CAIN: (20) “. . AND UNTO HIM (ABEL) SHALL BE YOUR (CAIN’S) DESIRE, AND (21) (ABEL) SHALT RULE OVER THEE (CAIN).”
(22) THUS JEW HIGH PRIEST EZRA CONCEALED GOD’S PREDICTION,
(23) OF THE RESULT OF ADAM AND EVE’S EATING FLESH (“EVIL TREE”) ACTION: (24) EXPLAINS GARDENER CAIN AS FUGITIVE VAGABOND, (25) WHEN HISTORY SHOWS HERDERS AS BEING NOMADS; (26) EXPLAINS THE HERDER’S FLESH OFFERING BEING “BEST,” (27) WHEN THE LAW OF EDEN WAS TO NOT OF FLESH INGEST; (28) EXPLAINS GARDENER CAIN BUILDING A CITY, (29) WHEN HISTORY SHOWS HERDERS AS ABEL BUILDS THESE; (30) EXPLAIN THOSE FOLLOWING THE HERDING (LIFESTYLE) OF ABEL, (31) KEPT BUILDING CITIES OF DIVISION LIKE BABEL (B-ABEL, BABYLON); (32) EXPLAINS THE CONNECTION OF ABEL WITH HERDING, (33) FOR THE GOLDEN CALF CREW RELIGION’S GOD WAS BEL (BAAL, A-BEL); (34) EXPLAINS THE TWO ADAMIC GENEALOGIES,
(35) ONE FALSE (GENESIS 4) ONE TRUE (GENESIS 5) TO THE HISTORY; (36) EXPLAINS GARDENER CAIN EXILED TO THE LANDS OF NOD, (37) HISTORY SHOWS HERDERS FIRST LOST THE EARTHS TOP SOD.

(42) TO THIS DAY THE THEBAN PRIESTHOOD OBSCURES THIS TRUTH, (43) THE REASON MAN LOST “EDEN” AND BECAME UNCOUTH.

ADDENDUM BIBLE GENESIS’ CHAPTER 4: RECONSTRUCTION OF THE “TRUE CAIN AND ABEL STORY” (God’s Prophesy of Genesis 3:15 Fulfilled) a
Genesis Chapter 4
1. “And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bared Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the Lord. b
2. “And she again bares his brother Abel, and said, I have gotten a man of the snake." c
“And Cain was a gardener, a tiller of the ground, and he ate only of fruits and vegetables from his garden for food as had been originally commanded by Lord." d
“But Abel was a herder and butcher of sheep, and ate of the flesh organs and fat of his flock of sheep for food as had been originally forbidden by the Lord.“ e
3. “And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruits and vegetables of the ground an offering unto the Lord.” f
4. “And the Lord and respect unto Cain and to his offering of fruits and vegetables, and accepted him through the door into the Kingdom of God .“ g
"And the Lord said to Cain, and unto thee Cain shall be your brother Abel’s desire, and thou Cain shalt rule over him." h
5. “And Abel, he also brought of the first lings of his flock of sheep and of the fat thereof. But unto Abel and to his meat offering the Lord had not respect." i
“And Abel was very angry, and he was very sad and disappointed."
6. “And the Lord said unto Abel, why art thou angry? And why art thou sad and disappointed?”
7. “If thou doest well Abel, shalt thou not be accepted through the door into the Kingdom of God."k
8. “But instead of heeding the Lord’s words, Abel proceeded to argue with Cain and his brother; being of anger and hatred toward Cain because Cain’s offering of fruits and vegetables were respected by the Lord, Cain was hence accepted through the door into the Kingdom of God, and Cain was given dominance over him.”
“And it came to pass, when they were in the field of Cain’s garden, that in anger and hatred Abel rose you against Cain his brother and slew him, as the Lord had prophesied enmity and murder amongst the offspring of Adam and Eve upon their eating of the ‘Tree if Evil’ flesh.”
9. “And the Lord said unto Abel, where is Cain thy brother? And Abel said. I know not: am I my brother’s keeper?"

ADDENDUM (Continued) BIBLE GENESIS’ CHAPTER 4: RECONSTRUCTION OF THE “TRUE CAIN AND ABEL STORY”
10. “And the Lord said, what has thou done? The voice of thy brother Cain’s blood crieth unto me from the ground of Cain's garden.”
11. “And now art thou Abel cursed from the earth’s Garden of Eden, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother Cain's blood from thy hand.”
12. ‘When thou Abel tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; fugitive from the Garden of Eden, and a vagabond shalt thou be in the Lands of Nod of earth.” m
13. “And Abel said unto the Lord, my punishment is greater than I can bear.”
14. “Behold, thou hast driven me out from the Garden of Eden onto the lands of nod of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive from the Garden of Eden and a vagabond in the land of nod on earth; and if shall come to pass, that everyone that findeth me shall want to slay me for having killed my brother Cain the gardener." n
15. “And the Lord said unto him, therefore whosoever slayeth Abel, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the Lord set a mark upon Abel, the mark of the beast 666, least any finding him should kill him for he has already been punished for killing Cain the gardener.” o
16. "And Abel went out from the presence of the Lord in Eden, and dwelt in the lands of nod, on the east of the Garden of Eden.” p

a See POEM #10 B for proof of the Bible’s rendition has been corrupted, and the basis of its reconstruction herein using the old “King James Version” as the base.
b Eve prophesies that her son Cain is a man of God and by inference will conduct his life accordingly righteously. “Cain philologically is “Kha-an(nu)” in Egyptian - “man of God.” Esoterically Kha-an(nu) has the philology - ‘emanation\sun\son of the Most High God Annu.
c In contrast to Cain, Eve does not prophesy Abel as being a man of God and by inference will conduct his life accordingly unrighteously . . . as the snake of Genesis 3.
d This is why Eves prophesy did not describe Abel as “a man from the Lord,” since he practiced the “original occupation” (of Genesis 2:5 and 8) and “original diet” (of Genesis 1:29, 2:9) symbolically the “tree of good”\vegetarian diet.
e This is why Eve did not prophesy describe Abel as “a man from the Lord,” since he was not! Abel practiced the then novel and un-divine occupation of sheep meat raiser\butcher and “tree of evil”\meat diet - both basis for exile for the Garden of Eden to the Lands of Nod.
f Esoterically “offering” means one’s livelihood and dietary conduct of on the divine hand gardener ”tree of good’ - vegetarian diet and on the other unrighteous hand animal meat herder\butcher\”tree of evil” -meat diet (“blood sucking”). Refer to Appendixe II-A and Appendixe ll-B on the relationship of livelihood and diet to spirituality an body\mental health and sickness.
g This issue of whose offering\occupational and dietary conduct was respected by he Lord and whose not respected is the most vital detail, and one which is clearly corrupted from the original fact that the gardener\vegetarian Cain’s offering\conduct was respected by the Lord since he fulfilled the “original occupation” and “original dietary” directives of the Lord (Genesis 2:5 and 8, 1:29, 2:9). The failure to properly coverup this corruption by Ezra and succeeding translators and revisers where Abel’s clearly unrighteous offering\conduct of animal herding\butchering and meat diet is respected by the Lord; is exposed not only by reference to the “original occupation\dietary” directives, but by Ezra’s failure to change the pronouns where necessary - see Chapter Seven POEM #10 B, lines 13-21 herein.
Clearly Cain’s divine and “original occupation” of gardening and “original diet” of fruits and vegetables are virtues in the Lords view, and led to Cain’s acceptance through the “door” into the Kingdom of God; i.e., he was given access through the “tree of life” esoterically the “Path of the Aten\Eden” to the Land of Light of the Heavens . . . where he could see the face of the Lord. Thus Eve’s description of Cain as “a man from the Lord” was prophetic and came true ... see Exhibit II_B-1, Exhibit II_B-2_3 and Exhibits II_B4 on the “tree of life”; see Chapter Six Scripture E. Chapter 68 on the “door” to the heavens.

FOOTNOTES:
h These are the key words in uncovering the corruption of the original “Cain and Abel Story.” For in the Bible King James Version’s Genesis 4:7 these words do not support the corruption by Ezra of making Abel’s sheep meat\fat “offering” respectable in the Lord’s view. Cain is given dominance over Abel as expected since Cain’s gardening\vegetable and fruit “offering” is in divine accordance with the “original occupation\dietary” directives of the Lord (Bible Genesis 2:5 and 8; 1:29, 2:9).
Oops! This mistake by Ezra nearly 3,000 years ago has now returned to bring the truth and true living in the open! A mass attempt to coverup Ezra’s pronoun mistake is found in all New King James Versions of the Bible! For Genesis 4:7 of the new versions change the Abel’s pronouns to a “neuter” sense: “And its desire is for you, but you should rule over it” . . . in the outrage of attributing to Cain the murder of his brother Abel instead of the truth of fratricide by Abel against Cain.
i The Bible’s Hosea 8:11-13 confirms that God rejects offerings\conduct involving butchering of animals and meat eating. Ephraim as Abel also transgresses God’s Law of Genesis 1:29, 2:9:
Hosea 8:11 “Because Ephraim has made many altars for sin,They have become for him altars for sinning.
12 I have written for him the great things of My Law, But they were considered a strange thing for the sacrifices of my offerings”.
13 They sacrifice flesh and eat it, But the Lord does not accept them. Now He will remember their iniquity and punish their sins. They shall return to Egypt {from the Lord’s Land exiled}.” (emphasis added, grammar signs corrected)
NOTE: These are God’s words explaining the reason for Ephraim’s punishment that Hosea prophesies.
Today in this meat eating world of the Lands of Nod, God’s law of vegan/vegetarianism (Genesis 1:29, 2:9) seems “strange” as it did to Ephraim (half Egyptian Annu son of Joseph). By inference as with Abel punishment includes exile from the Lord’s land, the veritable Garden of Eden to Egypt now symbolizing the unrighteous Lands of Nod.
But Hosea 9:3-4 specifies that Ephraim’s punishment is identical to Abel’s and Adam and Eve’s; i.e., exile from the “Lord’s Land”\Garden of Eden to the Lands of Nod in Egypt and Assyria; “house of the Lord”\ kingdom of God:
Hosea 9:3 “They shall not dwell in the Lord’s Land, But Ephraim shall return to Egypt, And shall eat unclean things in Assyria.
Hosea 9:4 “They shall not offer wine offerings to the Lord. Nor shall their sacrifices be pleasing to Him. It shall be like bread of mourners to them; All who eat it shall be defiled. For their bread shall be for their life; It shall not come into the house of the Lord.” (emphasis added)
NOTE: Esoteric warning that meat eating leaves uric acid, mucus and other wastes that will take one’s life via sickness and close ones “third eye.”
NOTE: “Bread of mourners” esoterically means meat\flesh\fat\ organs of animals: A clear reference to Abel’s meat offering and angry\sad behavior.
Obviously, the Prophet Hosea lived after High Priest Ezra, and this truth of God’s law went uncorrupted! Ephraim and all those thinking Gods’ law is strange and not following it are “ignorant.” But this is no excuse as Hosea 4:6 so well puts forward the words of God:
Hosea 4: 6 “My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge. Because you have rejected all knowledge, I also will reject you from being priests for me; Because you have forgotten the last of your God, I also will forget your children.”
Cain whose vegan/vegetarian offering\conduct was pleasing to the Lord, was rewarded by be!ng made a “priest’ of the Lord; For he was accepted through the “door” into the “Kingdom of God,” thus communing\seeing the face of the Lord. He was thus qualified to help others spiritually, and accordingly was given Abel’s desire and ruled over him as priest.
j Final philological proof that High Priest Ezra switched the Cain and Abel fratricidal role is found in the derivation of “Abel” According to even the new King James Version of the Bible (copyright 1982 by Thomas Nelson Inc.):
• Genesis 50:11 reads: “...‘This is a grievous mourning of the Egyptians.’ Therefore its name {Atad} was called Abel Mizraim, which is beyond the Jordan. • Footnote 43 informs us on page 53 that “Abel Mizraim” means “Literally Mourning of Egypt.” • Language experts all agree that the Hamitic lineage of Bible Genesis 10:6 & 13 clearly indicates that the word “Mizraim” means “Egypt.” Consequently “Abel” must mean “mourning,” more precisely “grievous mourning.” • Does not Abel’s name meaning fit exactly his behavior of “anger and great sadness and disappointment” in the light of the truth his offering of meat did not, please God, he was rejected through the “door’ into the Kingdom of God, and Cain is chosen to rule over him. The esoteric truth of the Cain and Abel Story has been unleashed!

THE EGYPTIAN MYSTERY “SCHOOL OF ON”
FOOTNOTES:
See Hosea 9:3 where meat\flesh\fat\organ of animal offerings as food is referred to as “bread of mourners” - an obvious reference to the true Cain and Abel Story that also as Genesis 4:7 escaped the many corrupting translations of the Bible after Ezra’s initial Hebrew one.
k Clearly Abel’s un-divine and novel animal herding and flesh eating are sins, of “not doing well,” in the Lord’s view; and are blockages to entry through the “door” into the Kingdom of God. Esoterically, AbeI's “third eye” is closed. See Chapter Six Scripture E. Chapter 68; Chapter Seven POEM #7B and Exhibits III-E, Exhibit III_H-1_2, and Exhibit III-I-1_2.
Thus Eve’s failure to identify Abel as “a man from the Lord” was prophetic and true. . . Abel was not given access to the “tree of life”\”Path of Aten (Eden),” having partaken of the “tree of evil”\animal flesh described in Genesis 3:22 & 24 as in the case of Adam and Eve who similarly transgressed.
l The Lord’s prophecy of hatred and violence between Adam and Eve’s offspring can be clearly seen in Genesis 3:15, quoted in Chapter Seven POEM #10 B lines 7-9. More esoterically, the Lord’s prophecy of murder in Genesis 2:17 as “for in the day that thou eatest (of the tree of evil knowledge\animal flesh) thereof thou shalt surely die” is a reference to becoming witnesses of the violent death of murder!
In the words “Abel rose up against Cain” is inferred the situation that Cain was given dominance over Abel by the Lord due to Cain’s superior and righteous “offering”\conduct of gardening and vegetarianism.
Esoterically the “Garden of Eden” was of abundance; while the “Land of Nod” was of “not,” i.e. scarcity and poverty, Undoubtedly the Garden of Eden and the Land of Nod coexisted at the time of the occurrence of the Cain and Abel Story. Specifically the location of the story up to the exile of the brother murderer, is no doubt in the Garden of Eden during those transition years of the majority of woman and man’s exile to the Lands of Nod. The Old “King James Version” of Genesis 4:16 proves this, since the perpetrator of fratricide is exiled to the “Lands of Nod, on the east of Eden.”
The unrighteous diet of animal fIesh\organ\fat eating and novel occupation of animal herding\butchering\hunting had just begun among the lesser developed Homo sapiens termed “snakes.” More developed “human” Homo sapiens clearly a “snake” follower . .. antecedent of the Magog lineage from Noah’s son Japeth. i.e. between Genesis 3:17, 18 & 19 and Genesis 4:12 - both exiles are to the east of the Garden and must be commonly the Lands of Nod, both involve resultant very difficultly must be similarly related to the breaking of the “original gardening\dietary” commandments of the Lord (Genesis 2:5 & 8; 1:29 & 2:9) by Adam and Eve partaking of the “tree of eviI”\fIesh and Abel’s sheep herding\meat eating “offering”\conduct. Abel just went further and fulfilled the Lord’s prophecy of enmity, violence and murder (Genesis 3:15 and 2:17).
NOTE: The Lord’s punishment of weak agricultural produce in the soils of the lands of Nod is esoterically the essence of “biological history” in regards civilization and the erosion and depletion of top soil and its nutrients. Such erosion and nutrient depletion of black humus top soil is the epitaph of animal herding\butchering\animaI flesh-fat eating civilizations. Obviously Abel and his lifestyle followers cannot live on animal derived food solely and must engage in growing plant-derived foods. Specifically “farming” is associated with Abel animal\herding\butchering\fIesh culture; as opposed to the aboriginal “gardening” of the original divine vegetarians humans of the Garden of Eden.
m To this day the “curse” of weak agricultural products still follows the Abel cultural adherers. Their animal manure and chemical fertilizer farming methods show clearly the lack of positive electromagnetic radiations measured by pendulum\radionic techniques; and overall lower levels of biochemical food elements on chemical analysis and compassion with naturally grown garden fresh foods. Thus the vegetarian gardeners of the Pakistan Hunza people produce the world’s best food produce, living in virtual Garden of Eden conditions. Since the soil is sick animals over grazing, compaction and artificial fertilizers, the food is sick; and thus animals and man is sick . . . see Chapter Seven POEM #3.
n These words “from they face shall I be hid” us a specific reference to Abel’s inability to pass through the “door” into the Kingdom of God and commune with the Lord; i.e., his “third eye” is closed. This is exactly the situation described for Adam in Genesis 3:22, 23 and 24 being kept from the “Tree of life,” esoterically the “Path of the Aten (Eden).”
o Abel is already punished by exile from the Garden of Eden, vagabond existence in the Lands of Nod, weak agricultural products, inability to commune with the Lord via closed “third eye,” and marked with the sign of the “Beast 666”.
Esoterically this mark identifying the meat eating\animal herding killer of the earth’s divine vegetarian\gardener is the pale white mucused skin and cIosed\crusted “third eye”\pineaI-pituitary gland blocking entrance through the door to the Kingdom of God/Land of Light associated with the Caucasian race. Ironically anyone following this life-style is so afflicted. Arnold Ehret first proposed this theory in his Mucusless Diet Healing System.

THE EGYPTIAN MYSTERY “SCHOOL OF ON”
FOOTNOTES: (continued)
Esoterically, “666” has the archetypical value of 9 (6 + 6 + 6 = 18 = 9) and refers to the 9th opening of the body called the “third (single by Jesus Christ) eye.” In a Homo sapien who has not achieved “HUman” status, the reference is to a “beast as a sure the “third eye” would be closed as in all Homosapien animals. In a HU-man that is a Homo sapien being initiated with resulting opening of the “third eye,” this is the mark on the forehead of the Lord cited in Revelations.
Meat eating, especially heavy meat eating associated with animal herding generally, results in an excessive mucus and acidic blood condition with an overabundance of abnormal white blood cells. White pale complexion, dandruff (dried mucus emission from the scalp) and a mucus waste blocked pineal/pituitary gland would be a mark. Materialistic, un-virtuous, vioIent\expIoitative behavior as an animal would be the rule of such people . . . unable to see the face of God.
“...the white race is an unnatural, a sick, a pathological one. First, the colored skin pigment is lacking, due to a lack of coloring mineral salts; second, the blood is continually overfilled by white blood corpuscles, mucus waste with white color; therefore the white appearance of the entire body.”
“The skin pores of the white man are constipated by white, dry mucus {, e.g., dandruff of the scalp}; his entire system is filled up and filled out with it. Everybody knows that an extreme case of paleness is a bad sign. “When I (a white man} appeared with my friend in a public air-bath, after having lived for several months on a mucusless diet (Garden of Eden meatless diet of fresh fruits and green leaf vegetables} with sun baths, we looked like Indians, and people believed that we belonged to another race. This condition was doubtless due to the great amount of red blood corpuscles and the great lack of white blood corpuscles.” (from Arnold Ehret, Mucusless Diet Healing System, pg. 72-73)
Since white blood cells are abnormal (see Ehret’s Mucusless Diet Healing System) via meat and improperly cooked food of civilized diet; AIDS (Acquired Immunological Deficiency Syndrome) is the Most High’s answer to errant people as predicted in the Bible Revelations 16: 2 (plague of sores) and Zechariah 14:12 (wasting disease).
p The words “Abel went out from the presence of the Lord in Eden” is esoteric symbology; Abel’s being now unable to follow the “Path of the Aten\(Eden)” and commune with the Lord.
The word “Nod” means “flight or wonder” according to Williamson in Moses. Since the perpetrator of fratricide is exiled to the Lands of Nod, the site of the Cain and Abel story must be in the Garden of Eden at a time corresponding to or shortly after Adam and Eve ate from the “tree of evil” flesh and God prophesied enmity and violence amongst their offspring (Genesis 3:15, and Genesis 2:17).
q Knowing the Adam genealogy of Genesis 4 is false since Can was murdered and not Abel, and thus the Adam genealogy of Genesis 5 is the correct one; then Babel must be Abel’s son since the namesake was to the east of the Garden of Eden in the valley of Shinar (Mesopotamia). Babel\Babylon the city is the first city mentioned in the Bible. Genesis II. Thus, the two Cain genealogies can be differentiated: Please refer to Appendix II-C wherein philology, comparative religion (sun vs. moon worship), content analysis and history are used.
Note that Abel is of the Magog\Japheth antecedent of the White\Caucasian race known for its warlike, paternal, animal herders, meat eating, moon worshiping cultures so opposite to be Cain\Annu lifestyle described in Chapter Seven POEM #2 and POEM #7A and POEM #7B. The White\Caucasian race is a major element of the Aryan root-race, which means “noble warrior” (M. Blavatsky, Isis Unveiled. II pg. 435) and includes the dark-skinned Abyssinians (today’s Ethiopians) and ancient “Thebans”\Dynastic Ethiopians.
Consequently the Bibilical Cain verses Abel myththology is esoterically analogous to the Seth verses Horus mythology of Ancient Egypt/Kemit based upon the historic struggles between the original vegan/vegetarian civilizations (Cain and Horus) and the later corrupt and demonic flesh eating cultures who invaded the Garden of Eden as the “snake” and caused its destruction. The Scythian Tribes of the Black Sea Crimes are associated with Magog/Gog in the Bible and described by the Greek historian Herodotus as cannibalistic raiding and herding culture. The name Seth or Thoth is corrupted and confounded with Satan. The invader peoples of Ancient
Egypt/Kemit included the famous Dark Red Dynastic race which was a miscegenation of the white Scythian cultures with the Dravidian race of India in pre-10,000 BC South Asia which too culminated in the Indo-European race and the myths of Rama’s exodus out of Europe in an attempt to escape the cannibalistic Scythians and their Druid sorcery priesthood. This war between the Sun and Moon forces is the basis of Hindu/Brahman religious texts.
The two myths of Ancient Greek Poet Hesiod used in the controversial last Ancient Greek play by Aeschylus Prometheus Bound esoterically recounts this secret migrational and racial mixing history of the origin of the Dark-Red Dynastic Race as part of the Theban “Invader” Races that entered into Ancient Egypt/Kemit over the milleniums symbolized by the “Cow headed” woman Io symbolizing the Sun-Goddess Het Heru of the Ancient Egpytian Mystery School of On (Annu).

Sixteen years later this interview is just as relevant as the “Original Condition” movement is well on its way as witnessed in the United States of America with a $30 billion dollar “alternative health industry”, a $20 billion “organic food industry” and a population where 10 % of the people practice a vegan/vegetarian dietary lifestyle.

GRAPHIC 8.1
STATUTE OF IMHOTEP THE 4 TH DYNASTY VISAR TO THE PHARAOH DOSER, STEP PYRAMID ARCHITECT AND PHYSICIAN PRIEST OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MYSTERY SCHOOL OF ON (ANNU)
Specifically, it was discovered that four primeval health related technologies were utilized in Ancient Egypt/Kemit by the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School Of On (Annu) students,
physician priests and priestesses. These health technologies were vital in the intervention of any disease based Chronic Poverty in Ancient Egypt's zenith. These four primeval health related technologies that prevented and naturally cured diseases are as follows:
I. The Ancient Egyptian Mystery School Of On (Annu) adhered to a vegetarian/vegan diet, prospective students as Pythagoras had to be able to follow this vegetarian/vegan diet regimen to gain entrance and maintain the vigorous scholastic pace required in their study of the esoteric 42 Books of Thoth/Hermes, and successful Priests and Priestesses followed this vegetarian/vegan diet regimen as part of the Spirituality System of the Path of the Aten;
II. The Ancient Egyptian Mystery School Of On (Annu) taught its Physician Priests and Priestesses a sickness preventive and curative technology best described as HOLISTIC HERBOLOGY utilizing nutritional herbs, vegetarian/vegan diet and monthly 3 day enemas for prevention; and medicinal herbs, fasting, and water therapies including high enemas for curing; reflected in its most famous Physician Priest graduate Imhotep who became the Vizier (chief adviser) to the 4 th Dynasty of Ancient Egypt Pharaoh Djoser, who was the Step Pyramid architect and who also was worshiped later as the Ancient Greek god of healing
Aesculapius; reflected in the series of Ancient Greek Physicians under the name "Hippocrates" (the 6 th born in 400 BC); and embedded in the Hippocratic Oath in modern allopathic and osteopathic medicine;
III. Those Priestesses who adhered to the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School Of On (Annu) directives including vegetarian/vegan diet and positive celibacy enjoyed the original health condition of women called the "AMENSES" condition absent of monthly menstruation,
menopause and with greater human ability physically, emotionally, mentally and spiritually; and
IV. Civilizations like Ancient Egypt/Kemit based on Sustainable Agri-Forestry (SAF) are the most productive and long lived, which today is exemplified by the Ancient Egyptian spin-off culture the HUNZA Province in modern Pakistan founded by Ptolemy Egyptian colonists;
where a minimal of 3 feet of humus top soil from intensive earthworm recycling waste cultivation in mountain terraced deep beds and constant glacial water mineralization produces such a
high quality of natural "organic" foods are some of the these secrets of the average lifespan of Hunzacuts being well over 100 years of age. Crime, disease and Chronic Poverty were nonexistent in the Hunza Province of Pakistan as witnessed and documented in the 1960’s by the American National Geriatrics Society’s Jay M. Hoffman, PhD in his book Hunza: 15 Secrets of the World's Healthiest and Oldest Living People (Professional Press Publishing Association, 1985 expanded edition, 13115 Hunza Hill Terrace, Valley Center, CA. 92082, 619-749-1134/749-1135) excerpts presented on the BRCA/Hope LA-USA Project, Inc.

The overall benefit of the natural and original "nutritional herbology" promulgated by the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu)'s adherence to a vegan/vegetarian diet is the avoidance of unhealthy acid blood conditions resulting largely from eating animal flesh foods including dairy, poultry and aquatic animals. It is the achievement of healthy alkaline blood conditions that fostered the legendary Amenses Priestesses of the
Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) and the spin-off Ancient Israeli Essene Hebrew women including Jesus Christ's Mother Mary.
A truly outstanding modern reference on this problem of acid blood conditions including symptoms, pathological reasons for its leading to diseases and solutions are summarized in D.

GARDINER, PG. 176, TOMB PAINTING OF NEFER-HETEP, THEBES, C. 1350 BC.)

GRAPHIC 8.3 above illustrates the classic "Garden Party" social event and vegan and
vegetarian way of life of the Amenses Priestesshood of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu). The fruit garden and its delicacies of fruit and fruit juices were the center of their days menu and amenses health maintenance. Note the Amenses toiletry condition of the Priestesses. Esoterically, Eve the first women on planet earth ate out of the garden and were without monthly menstruation;. i.e. were "Amenses". This aboriginal female Amenses condition and the beginning of menstruation is symbolically presented in the Bible/Genesis 3: 15-19 with the "Garden of Eden" curses on human kind. See Exhibit III_G-3.
Esoterically, the Garden of Eden "sin" was not sexual nor having anything to do with apples, but was dietary based; i.e. the decision by the original Garden inhabitants the Adam and Eve people not to follow the vegan/vegetarian law of the Garden of Eden presented in the Bible Genesis 1: 29.
Ge 1:29 And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
Esoterically, the original Garden of Eden inhabitants the” Adam and Eve People” followed the suggestions of the outsider Scythian "Snake" people to break the vegan/vegetarian rule of the Garden. Described in the Bible Genesis 3: 1-6, historically the Black Sea Crimea area Scythians or Magog introduced cattle and animal herding and eating into Africa the site of the Garden of Eden. According to the historian Herodotus who visited the Scythians about 450 BC. they were not only animal herders and animal flesh eaters but cannibals and criminal raiders too.
The resulting "biological curse" on the woman from eating animal flesh is the resulting "thick and acid blood" conditions from trying to digest unnatural animal flesh proteins and its cholesterol and uric acid by-products. Such a diet is not conducive to female fertility and successful childbirth. The resulting menstruation "womb hemorrhage" and leuchorrhea is the female body's response in order to thin and bring the female blood to a basic pH blood condition necessary to conceive babies successfully. But unnatural menstruation has a price___ monthly heavy loss of body blood, hormone and dietary nutrients. The resulting menstruating woman has painful and difficult childbirths and becomes weaker than her male counterpart as to comparative power and societal position.
Ge 3:16 Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
Accordingly, the "Original Condition of Women" or "Amenses Female Human" Condition was a foundation of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) and the later Ancient Israeli Essenes. A basic fruit based diet is the prerequisite to achieve an Amenses condition naturally fertile without days of vaginal blood flow and perennial leucorrhoea conditions.
This natural condition of women was rediscovered by Arnold Ehret and published in
his 1930 book Mucusless Diet Healing System. It was Arnold Ehret who deciphered
the Biblical New Testament description of the Virgin Mary's Immaculate Conception
of Jesus Christ as her esoteric achievement of the "Amenses Female Human" Condition as an Ancient Israeli Essene Priestess.
From the writings of Josephus the Historian, Pliny and other historical descriptions of the Ancient Israeli Essenes; we know that for a female priestess to be admitted into the Ancient Israeli Essene Order, she must have achieved the "Amenses Female Human" Condition. Specifically, she was on probation for 2 years to accomplish this immaculate
"inner cleanliness" physiological status while undergoing her other Ancient Egyptian

Later in 1972 Viktoras Kulvinskas published his landmark millennial preparation book entitled Survival into the 21 st Century; which presented a complete natural system of female gynecology and obstetrics based upon the "Original Condition of Women" the "Amenses Female Human" Condition.

THESE HUNZA PAKISTAN WOMEN IN TRADITIONAL DRESS ARE AMENSES, AS WOULD BE EXPECTED OF WOMEN EATING A VEGAN DIET AND ASSOCIATED WITH GARDEN WORK. (FROM JAY HOFFMAN, 15 SECRETS OF THE HUNZA, 1961)
GRAPHIC 8.4 above is a 1961 photograph of modern Hunza Pakistan women in traditional dress. The Hunza women in the photograph have a median menstrual period of 1 day with several of them totally Amenses. Hunza women are Amenses following the necessary vegan/vegetarian diet, naturally grown food and natural sexuality conducive to attainment of the Amenses "original condition of women" status. Pakistan being a Moslem nation the Hunzakut women have no problem in following a sexual tradition that prohibits intercourse during pregnancy or the 2 to 3 years they nurse their babies. Since the Sino-Pakistan two lane highway was completed in the 1980's the Hunza's long 120 year plus lifespans and excellent level of health free of nutritionally related diseases is predicted to deteriorate due to exposure to civilized food, beverages and past times.
D. THE ORIGINAL HUMAN DIET AND HOMO SAPIENS
The "Amenses Female Human" Condition of women is the true natural pathway to female liberation; and simultaneously ironically explains why women out live men by 9 years on average. The unnatural menstruation of women is a hemorrhage of the uterus to rid the female body of acidic blood in order to conceive. Thus the male body suffers from a physiological inability to match the female body's adaptation to an "unnatural putrefactive acid blood condition" via monthly menstruation.
Humans are paleo-anthropologically members of the last surviving species sapien in the genus homo; i.e. Homo Sapiens. Human female menstruation commenced historically upon the unnatural introduction of animal flesh of all types to what was originally thus naturally a vegan/vegetarian human nutrition.
In more recent ancient history the Late Ice Age European Neanderthal hominids who are not of the genus homo sapian have been confirmed as cannibals. The later Stone Age Black Sea Crimea Scythians were cannibals according to Greek Historian Herodotus who visited them in the 5th Century BC. It is thus not surprising that the Neanderthals and the Scythians are the prime candidates as the peoples originating the novel practice of animal flesh based human nutrition and animal herding husbandry based agriculture. Esoterically, the philogy of the word “cannibal” derives from the ancient human dietary dilemma symbolized by the Biblical Edenic story of Cain and Abel (cannibal = Cain-Abel).

This dilemma is whether to follow the original human dietary plan of vegetarian/vegan or follow the novel animal meat dietary plan created by the "snake people" better known as the barbarian cannibal Scythians or as Biblically known as Magog and Gog.
Physiologically and biochemically eating by homo sapian humans of animal flesh foods causes an acidic pH blood condition without exception; where characteristically excessive white immune system cells leave the lymphatic system and inhabit the blood system. Comparatively few plant foods like almonds; walnuts; and peanuts, soybeans and other legumes cause comparatively weaker acidic blood conditions in humans. Basic or alkaline pH blood condition is associated with a strong disease prevention status and over a 100 year life span in humans.
Thus male humans must suffer acidic blood conditions too but are unable to release it except as minor monthly tooth bleeding. Unnatural female menstruation is why today's "normal" women are stronger physiologically than men; females being able to withstand significantly more pain, more gravity forces, weather extremes and emotional stress than men.
Simultaneously, the woman's monthly replacing of this menstruation blood loss leaves women less powerful (ability to move mass at speed) significantly than a man. Unfortunately, since the Roman period there has appeared an increased incidence of child bearing women receiving Caesarean child births in "civilized" and developing countries; reflects the toll of animal flesh and organ meat eating on the human female genetics and physiology over millenniums of time.
The toll on the modern "civilized" human male has been devastating from a female comparatively shorter life span, falling sperm counts and increased baldness; excessively high violent death rates including suicide; to epidemic levels of sexual impotency and sterility, sexually communicated diseases, increased male sexual abuse and criminality, and negative birth rates on the national level; e.g. Italy and the Balkans (ex-Yugoslavia).
E. THE 12 CAUSES OF CANCER AND ITS PREVENTION
For those heeding the American Cancer Society's warning that half of the American population will contract cancer, here are the 12 causes of the Cancer Epidemic and how to prevent it for you to download freely.
As my Step Father has undergone several colon cancer surgical procedures this past year and I am reminded I have been warning my family and friends for 30 years now what I had learned in my medical pathology and "nutritional herbology" studies starting with my pre-med undergraduate education at the University of Chicago from 1966 to 1970 (BA in General Biology) and culminating in my Doctor of Herbology (HD) Degree in 1986 ___ that 50% of the American people will die of cancer. Of course not having an MD degree and warning so early in the cancer epidemic very few have listened to me seriously.
Since then both my Mother and Step Father have contracted cancer, my mother's brother and sister died of cancer in 6 months from diagnosis in 1998, my step father's sister died of cancer this year and a score of other people in my family and network have it or have died of it. A year ago I heard a frustrated and frightened Reverend Jessie Jackson on his CNN cable show ask outright what was the cause of this cancer epidemic?
Here is a list of the 12 leading causes of the cancer epidemic known 30 years ago remembering that cancer cells are one's own cells who decide to break the "body plan" and revolt growing on their "own plan" and satisfying their own needs without regard to the body's needs, overall safety and well being:
#1.) animal organ and flesh foods __ animal protein digestion unlike plant protein digestion leads directly to the heavy production of the carcinogen uric acid, unnatural animal manure containing bacteria and fungi which is allowed into the meat from the dead animal's intestinal tract during the "curing process" of hanging butchered meat
THE EGYPTIAN MYSTERY “SCHOOL OF ON”, VOL. 1 BY GEORGE SINGLETON, ENLIGHTENMENT PUBLICATIONS, 2003 EDITION
96.



caucuses to tenderize the meat, and these microbes excrete carcinogens (mycotoxins) into the ingester's body; and leads to ingesting agri-chemicals from the grains these farm animals are feed ___ creates the cancer cell producing environment of a thick acid pH blood condition with a low level of oxygen;
NOTE: a.) The human body in its normal cellular death maintenance metabolism produces uric acid that is excreted by the kidneys, and is additionally overloaded from the unnatural addition of animal organ and flesh foods adding additional uric acid for the body to eliminate. The identification of the secondary bile salt lithocolic acid as the cause of Colon Cancer from a fatty animal flesh diet will eventually lead to its involvement in the majority of other types of cancers and the end to animal flesh foods as an accepted food source.
b.) Dairy products that are rennetless are alright to eat and prevent cancer but are extremely hard to get. Thus substituting and switching completely to dairy -less cheeses (soy and rice)) and soy and rice and other seed and nut milks is ideal.
#2.) improper internal hygiene __ people are taught to brush, and floss their teeth and antiseptically wash their mouth; i.e. the beginning of the digestive/alimentary tract but have not been told and in fact are encouraged not to wash the end segment of their digestive/alimentary tract the colon; the colon being the part of the intestinal tract that not only withdraws water from the feces but helps purify the blood along with the kidneys by filtering sold wastes from the blood stream into the large intestine for elimination in the stools ___ thus leading to a further compounding of the Cancer Epidemic cause #1 problem above by causing a build up old undigested putrefactive acid forming mucus waste material amounting to a dangerous anaerobic (oxygen deficient) cesspool environment teaming with microbes and their carcinogenic toxic excrements.
NOTE: Colon cancer is the # 2 killing cancer in America and the other industrialized countries. It and stomach cancer are obviously connected to what we eat and drink and the relative internal hygiene of these two key food digestive organs.
#3.) parasitic tape worms, flukes, protozoa, viruses, bacteria and fungi ___
usually animal manure, organs and flesh food originated but also in contaminated and spoiled vegetable, fruit, nuts, legumes and grains as well as in the air from other infected people and animals ___ tapeworms, flukes and protozoa getting the nutrients before the host, viruses entering cells and mutating their genetic (DNA and or RNA) material carcinogenic, and bacteria and fungi feeding on undigested food residues ___ with them all excreting carcinogenic wastes right into the core of the human body and carried by the blood stream throughout the body on every heart beat;
#4.) conventionally grown vegetables, fruits and grains contaminated with agrichemicals from artificial fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, growth hormones and fungicides;
#5.) refined, adulterated and preserved foods ___ from farm and garden humus topsoil erosion and failure to soil remineralize producing especially since World War II and the onset of chemical agriculture empty calorie food products devoid of biogenic energy and natural micro-nutrients needed to detoxify carcinogenic wastes and chemicals and fight cancer cells abound ___ producing in the general population a "sub clinical malnutrition" devoid of the natural fresh fruit, vegetable, nut, seed and grain cancer fighting cytosomes, vitamins, minerals and enzymes; with chemical preservatives, artificial colors and additives including propyl alcohol ;
#6.) improper beverages and damaged disinfected drinking water ___
alcoholic beverages including wines and beers overwork the cancer fighting organ the liver while stimulating briefly increased blood flow by thinning the otherwise average meat eater's thick acid pH blood condition with a low level of oxygen, and the use of the chemical
poisons chlorine gas, fluoride, calcium carbonate and aluminum to name a few to disinfect
and treat sewer utilized water to produce public drinking water which is high pressurized in municipal water systems damaging its molecular structure and oxygenation ability;
THE EGYPTIAN MYSTERY “SCHOOL OF ON”, VOL. 1 BY GEORGE SINGLETON, ENLIGHTENMENT PUBLICATIONS, 2003 EDITION
97.



#7.) loss of 50% of the Oxygen in the Air since 1900 ___ by the continued deforestation of the planet and environmental chemical pollution killing the oxygen producing trees, water and soil algae and ocean plankton and seaweed__ which alone explains the Ozone Holes since Ozone (O3) is produced naturally from Oxygen (O2) and if the former is reduced so will the later be reduce ___ causing the increased need for nutritional anti-oxidant vitamins and micronutrients;
#8.) ultraviolet light from the sun ___ can mutate cellular genetic material carcinogenic is normally filtered out by the atmosphere but allowed through the atmospheric Ozone Holes ultimately caused by the loss of trees and other oxygen producing plants and thus loss of oxygen in the atmosphere produces skin cancers;
#9.) industrial chemicals in commercial products, manufacturing work sites and as environmental pollutants in the air, water, earth, food plants and animals;
#10.) natural and man made radiation ___ from substances as natural radon, from nuclear power plants, radioactive wastes used to produce "irradiated preserved" foods, nuclear weapon testing and uses thereof ;
#11.) stress at home, work or extracurricular activities ___ usually from a dislike of one's livelihood or one's interpersonal relationships blocks the bodies daily detoxing of free radicals, cancer cells and other carcinogenic toxins; and
#12.) Over indulgence in sexual intercourse, prescription and illicit drugs and greed.
Obviously, it is a wiser lifestyle and economically expedient to prevent the onset of cancer in one's life before it starts or to cure it in its early stages. You can afford to look like an "extremist health nut" if you can avoid the cancer epidemic, since the majority of America's people are content in allowing this cancer epidemic to consume them for the sake of progress, too confident in their health insurance and hoping for a "magic" cure. Even the first stages of a particular cancer can benefit from an avoidance of the 12 cancer causes no matter what treatment one chooses to take ___ the conventional legal chemical, surgery and radiation treatments or an alternative cure.
Finally, there are so-called "genetically associated cancers" but it is maintained here that avoiding the 12 cancer causes outlined above will prevent even "so-called " hereditary cancers" from manifesting which comprise only 5% of all cancer incidents.
For those needing guidance as to how to deal with Cancer Causes #1, 2 and 3:
1.) the vegan/vegetarian diet is highly recommended for you immediately;
2.) with corresponding "high enemas" every 4 days for at least a year reduced to once a month thereafter when all one's sickness symptoms have disappeared targeting the "unseen" intestinal tract unsanitary mucus food wastes;
3.) please refer to the Original Prevention of Disease: General Nutritional Instructions Pamphlet included herein and down loadable to visitors to our Web Site for free at http://www.hopelausa.org/Page8.html#anchor67182/ for diet, high enema and ridding oneself of tape worms and internal intestinal mucus filth.
For those needing guidance as to how to deal with Cancer Causes #4, 5, 6 and 7:
1.) invest in your health and start buying "organic" food produce and food products from your local natural food store, market or farmers' market;

2.) invest and plant your own deep bed garden that will produce 4 times as much food with half the water ___ with deep bed installation instructions found herein;
3.) invest and increase the number of oxygen producing landscape trees and ornamental plants inside and outside your residence;
4.) invest in a Champion quality triturating juicer and prepare your own fresh vegetable and fruit juices which are rich in oxygen;
5.) avoid drinking tap or well water directly and wasting money on bottled water not in polycarbonate plastic as any other plastic bottle will leach plastic polymers into the water, and invest in a mobile Nikken PiMag (Fliptop or Sport) Water Bottle ($58 or 4 pack for $88) and Magna Tote ($95) or stationary residential faucet installed Nikken PiMag Water System ($850) and purify and naturally energize your potable tap, well or camp site water to oxygen rich, pH balanced PiMag water.

F. SUB-CLINICAL MALNUTRITION, CRIMINALITY AND ALCOHOL/DRUG DEPENDENCY
The connection of CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR WITH POOR NUTRITION must be brought into focus, because of the denial and neglect of this reality by all levels of government and philanthropic organizations. Poor nutrition is a causative factor for juvenile and young adult crime; associated school misbehavior, scholastic failure and inadequate job performance. Poor nutrition is a causative factor in alcohol and drug dependency. Such Sub-Clinical Malnutrition and alcohol and drug dependency becomes a nearly invisible vicious sub-cycle in individual, family and community dysfunction, depravation and violence.
AS FAR BACK AS 1936 DR. GEORGE WASHINGTON "CARVER ALSO SAW A CONNECTION BETWEEN POOR NUTRITION AND CRIME. SPEAKING BEFORE A CLASS IN DIETETICS AT TUSKEGEE, HE EXPLAINED HIS THEORY:
' IT MAY SEEM STARTLING WHEN I SAY THAT THE MAJORITY OF OUR CRIMINALS ARE PRODUCED AS A RESULT OF BAD COOKING AND BAD COMBINATION OF FOOD STUFFS. BUT UPON SERIOUS THOUGHT, ONE CAN SEE THAT THIS IS TRUE. WHEN A PERSON EATS POORLY COOKED FOOD, HIS BODY IS NOT PROPERLY NOURISHED. A POORLY NOURISHED BODY PRODUCES AN UNHEALTHY MIND. A PERSON WHO IS POORLY NOURISHED QUICKLY TURNS TO STIMULANTS, SUCH AS ALCOHOL, TO GIVE THEM A FEELING OF WELL BEING, WHICH SHOULD HAVE BEEN SUPPLIED BY PROPERLY COOKED FOOD.' "
[FROM FRUITS OF CREATION: A LOOK AT GLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY AS SEEN THROUGH THE EYES OF GEORGE WASHINGTON CARVER, BY JOHN S. FARRELL, MACALESTER PARK PUBLISHING, 1955, PAGE 78; QUOTED FROM "A FEW NOTES ON A DEMONSTRATION BY DR. CARVER BEFORE THE CLASS IN COMMERCIAL DIETETICS", TUSKEGEE MESSENGER, JULY-SEPT. 1936, 14, CLIPPING (CM/46) ]
Furthermore today it must be recognized that poorly mineralized soils, agribusinesschemicals, over refined and processed foods extend Dr. George Washington Carver's causal theory indicating a given individual's deficient nutritional food status from improperly cooked and wrongly combined foods are significant causal elements in an individual’s delinquent educational and/or criminal behavior that society can readily address and ameliorate.

In 1992 the BRCA/Hope LA-USA Project, Inc. helped establish the federally funded
"Brown Thumb\Green Thumb Demonstration Program" at the County of Los Angeles
CA. Probation Department Camp Karl Holton Youth Detention Center for 3 time youth
offenders. The documentary video clip the 1993 "Life Centered Learning" Teacher Training Video explores the holistic impact of the "Brown Thumb\Green Thumb Program's" horticultural therapy on urban youth inmates’ "symbiotic" nutritional food
status and connected educational delinquency and behavioral criminality
(delinquincy/criminality).
The term "symbiotic" is used because delinquency/criminality can be caused partly from and many times "feeds upon" a deficient nutritional food status. This in turn can lead to the onset of alcoholism and drug addiction, two "nutritionally related syndromes" preventable with a healthy nutritional food status. Any sustainable amelioration strategy as indicated in the video must be holistically formulated; i.e., be multi-disciplinarily designed and minimally socio-political economically optimized.
In 1994 the BRCA/Hope LA-USA Project, Inc. with the support of Cell Tech, Inc. the makers of a high quality freeze dried "Super Blue Green Algae (SBGA)" whole food (as opposed to a "food supplement") harvested wild from Lake Klamath in Oregon, USA.; conducted an applied nutrition demonstration at the County of Los Angeles CA. Probation Department Camp Karl Holton Youth Detention Center. In the "Camp Karl Holton/Cell Tech Demonstration" Video: Part 1" the "Brown Thumb/Green Thumb Program" and the applied nutrition demonstration are showcased in detail.
In the "Camp Karl Holton/Cell Tech Demonstration" Video: Part 2" the impact of such a "whole wild crafted food" like SBGA administered clinically daily by the Camp Charge Nurse on selected volunteer inmates is documented. Clearly, from the testimonials presented "one behaves in part as a reflection of what one eats".
Of significance here is that the U.S. federal and state governments centered their "criminal justice system" upon a coordinated “Drug War” at least up through the September 11, 2001 Terrorist Attack. Thus they seriously neglected the prevention of crime modality of improved nutritional food status qualitatively and quantitatively from before an individual's conception, after conception through birth, and throughout their life. Conventional scientific research and development studies support the symbiotic connection of deficient nutrition and increased criminality.
Of particular interest are the research writings of Alexander Schauss, Diet, Crime, and Delinquency and Orthomolecular Treatment of Criminal Behavior originally cited in Hamaker and Weaver's Survival of Civilization) summarized in Multimedia_7.3 Camp Karl Holton/Cell Tech Demonstration” Video: Part 3: Planting the Seeds of Hope Pamphlet. This pamphlet cites other criminal/nutritional related research.

GRAPHIC 9.0 above is the Fifth Discovery of the Chronic Poverty Research And Development behind this book, constituting the breakthrough to the question of how Ancient Egypt/Kemit
generated its fabulous sustainable prosperity and wealth. The answer to this ancient question would provide a viable solution to the modern world's Chronic Poverty . Ironically this graphic answer was found carved on an Ancient Egyptian military weapon called "Scorpion's Mace
Head". This relic dates back to the Predynastic Ancient Egyptian Period. Even in ancient times a nation's agricultural production and ability to feed its civilian and military populations was a core military premise. See Exhibit I_J.
The proper interpretation of GRAPHIC 9.0 answers not only the question of how Ancient Egypt/Kemit generated the enormous prosperity to build the technologically enigmatic Sphinx Rock Sculpture, Sphinx Monolithic Temples and 3 Great Pyramids; but also answers the how they were able to sustain this prosperity over such an incredibly long chronology in excess of ten
thousand years. The "so-called" King Scorpion of Upper Egypt is shown standing in a Sustainable Agri-Forest. King S corpian stands behind irrigation trenches with pick adze in hand, surrounded by workers planting a tree in front of him also with pick adze in hand. Behind King Scorpian can be seen workers tending "Planting Beds" with sunflowers and beehives ready to harvest. The connection of a strong agricultural sector and strong military is clear.

9.1 above shows the aboriginal "Sustainable Agri-Forest" called in the Bible the "Garden of Eden". This was the continual source of Ancient Egypt/Kemit's immense and perennial sustainable prosperity and wealth. Ancient Egypt/Kemit's Sustainable Agri-Forests spanned the entire Nile River Valley from the Great Lakes to the Delta.
Esoterically, in the Pre-Dynastic Period of Ancient Egypt/Kemit cattle were introduced onto the African Continent by invading Scythian and Scythian derivative Theban Invader Peoples from Euro-Asia. The resulting soil erosion dictated a climatic deterioration and associated encroaching desertification that significantly reduced this aboriginal
Sust pt/Kemit. Esot damaged and continually buried the Sphinx Rock Sculpture
ainable Agri-Forest into and throughout the Dynastic Period of Ancient Egy erically, this is the same desertification that under sand as especially associated with 18 th Dynasty Pharaoh Thuthmoses IV. This observed ancient climatic damage forms the basis of the theory that the Sphinx Rock Sculpture was built in the Pre-Dynastic Period of Ancient Egypt/Kemit. See Exhibit IV_D-5-2.
Note that this is the same desertification that resulted in the Nile River soil erosion silt deposits, at its highest during the annual Nile River inundation (flooding); that eventually created in the Pre-Dynastic Period of Ancient Egypt/Kemit the Nile River Delta. Thus the Greek Father of History Herodotus reported that the first Pharaoh of the First Dynasty of Ancient Egypt, Pharaoh Menes had to drain the Nile River Delta to make it inhabitable. Esoterically, and that the Delta was not there when the Great Pyramid Complex at Giza was first built, and explains the trench system of the Great Pyramid.
This desertification and deterioration of the Ancient Egyptian Sustainable Agri-Forests necessitated that the during the Dynastic Period of Ancient Egypt/Kemit the Pharaohs periodically sent expeditions to and received tributary from expeditions to this area we now call the Great Lakes of Africa, which they called Khenthunnefer surrounded by the regions of Meroe (modern southern area of Sudan and Lake Tana area of Ethiopia), Sheba (modern Ethiopia) and Punt (modern Eritrea).
B. THE SUSTAINABLE AGRI-FOREST WAS THE ABORIGINAL HUMAN ENTERPRISE
The Biblical “Garden of Eden” or technically speaking the Sustainable Agri-Forest was the aboriginal human enterprise system; an integrated garden, orchard and forest cultivated integratively on one location __ an integrated garden, orchard and forest cultivated on one piece of ground. Thus the Sustainable Agri-Forests are found in Ancient Israel, North

Note the companion planting of fruit and nut trees with vegetable plants, and the use of an irrigation cistern fed pond.
Essenes authored the Dead Sea Scrolls and were the leaders of Ancient Israel being the prophets, lawyers and political and military leaders. They were derived from the "Hyksos" the mixed Semitics-Asiatics invaders of lower Egypt, who ruled the Egyptian 15 th Dynasty from circa 1630 BC. until defeated by an upper Egyptian and Mittanian coalition creating the 18 th Dynasty circa 1521 BC. Esoterically, the Essenes were established by the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) student Moses. They lived in rural horticultural production communities linked to urban distribution centers.

It is Figure 7 of that book depicting part of a 100 acre ancient Sustainable Agri-Forest found in the Saint Joseph River Valley of the state of Michigan in the United States first described in 1825. They have also been found in other parts of the states of Michigan as well as in Indiana and Wisconsin of the United States. The French explorer Verandier had observed such Sustainable Agri-Forests as far back as 1748 in the western territories.
However Henry Schoolcraft in his capacity as editor of this multi-volume study of Native Americans for the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs was the first to systematically study them writing that these:
"garden-beds, and not the (Mississippi and Ohio River Valley Indian) mounds, form, indeed, the most striking and characteristic antiquarian monuments of this district of the country."
Predictably the federal and state authorities allowed all traces of these ancient sustainable agri-forests some as large as 300 acres, built by a "mysterious" aboriginal Native American people found in Michigan as well as in Wisconsin and Indiana to be completely destroyed by contemporary farm activity by 1877.

ELEMENTS to Sustainable Agri-Forestry (SAF) as used by the black African Anu Peoples of Ancient Egypt/Kemit and the Pre-Columbian Cultures of North, Central and South America:

Egypt/Kemit along the entire Nile River Valley using the “Giant African Nile River Valley
Nightcrawler“ (Eudrilus Eugeniae) the aboriginal “gardening earthworm” producing enormous quantities of humus top soil as opposed to the intermediate soil amendment compost.
2.) Deep Planting Beds from 2 to 5 feet deep with permanent pathways.
3.) “Biological Horticulture”, a natural sustainable cultivation Including heavy recycling based humus topsoil production as opposed to “organic agriculture’s “ emphasis on compost production and protection of land from over grazing practices.
4.) Multi-Cropping With Integrated Forest And Orchard Trees, Vines, Bushes, Scrubs And Garden Ground Plants including the Paulownia “Super-Tree. NOTE: The Paulownia or “Empress Tree” is native to China with several species for Reforesting, agri-forestry and landscaping purposes in all climates and terrain.
5.) On Demand Irrigation System fed from a river, stream, creek, lake, pond, well and/or rainwater cistern with optional Aqua-Terra Cultivation.
A detailed description of the 5 KEY SAF ELEMENTS is provided.
E. VERMICULTURE: INTENSIVE EARTHWORM CULTIVATION:: THE SUPREME
SUSTAINABLE AGRI-FOREST (SAF) ELEMENT
The until recently secret and supreme element of Ancient Egypt/Kemit's Sustainable Agri
Forest based agricultural system was intensive earthworm cultivation (vermiculture) on a level of an average 2,500 earthworms a cubic foot of soil. This fantastic earthworm soil density produced then in ancient Egypt and produces right up to today in modern Egypt an astonishing humus topsoil production throughout the entire course of the Nile River from the Great Lakes and its tributaries to the Delta.
Esoterically, the truth has emerged that the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School Of On (Annu) set up and maintained a Sustainable Agri-Forestry System whose foundation was the maintenance of Intensive Vermiculture (earthworm cultivation) throughout the Nile River
Valley from the Great Lakes to the Mediterranean Sea. The incredible reproductive and humus
production power of the Giant African Nile River Valley Earthworm was harnessed.
Thus it is a myth that the Nile River Valley's perennial fertility came from the annual flooding of the Nile River bringing silt downstream to replenish the soil; taught every school child since the fall of ancient Egypt to Rome in 30 BC with the defeat of Ptolemy Pharaoh Queen Cleopatra to this modern day! Jerry Minnich in the Earthworm Book (Rodale Press, 1972) astutely writes:
"There is also evidence that the ancient Egyptians were well aware of the earthworms' contribution to their prosperity. Cleopatra, in fact, decreed the earthworm to be a sacred animal to be revered and protected by all her subjects __doubtless the only time in history that the earthworm has achieved so elevated a status."
"...Cleopatra (69 - 30 BC) recognized the earthworm's contribution to the Egyptian agriculture by declaring this animal sacred. Egyptians were not allowed to remove so much as a single worm from the land of Egypt, and even farmers were not allowed to touch an earthworm for fear of offending the god of fertility."
The first breaking of this secret was made by the famous naturalist and evolutionist theorist Charles Darwin (1809-1882) whose last book Formation of Vegetable Mold published in 1881 just before his death in 1881. This book was dedicated to his "discovery" of the scientifically documented awesome power of the humus topsoil producing "lowly" earthworm. Darwin judged the earthworm as probably the most important animal in history. This book outsold his more famous and flawed Theory of Evolution books.

This "Nile River Valley fertility from the Nile River's annual inundation" falsification was fully exposed in 1949 by the U.S. Department Of Agriculture's study of the Nile River Valley fertility. Half a century ago in 1949 the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) studied earthworm humus/topsoil production in the Nile River Valley. What they found makes suspect as myth the common school book belief that the annual inundation of the Nile River bringing silt from soil erosion up stream was the basis of the multi-millennium long fertility of Ancient Egypt/Kemit's Nile River Valley agricultural system.
The 1949 USDA study recorded humus/topsoil productions of 240,000 pounds per acre annually produced in the Upper Nile River Valley, and 2,000,000 pounds per acre annually produced in the Delta; i.e. the equivalent of $240,000 to $2,000,000 per acre of new top soil produced each year of Sustainable Horticulture a "prosperity mentality" permeated the culture Of Ancient Egypt/Kemit, its Institutions and all its people from the farmer to the Pharaoh.
To help preserve the intensive vermiculture the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) made it a sin in the "so-called" Egyptian Book of the Dead and thus forbidden by law to dam the Nile River in favor of parallel canals. This is the case in the Ancient Egyptian man made 400 mile circumference Lake Moeris which was fed by parallel to the Nile system of canals built by the 12 th Dynasty Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of Annu (On) Pharaoh-Priest Amenemhet III (circa 1839 BC). The purpose of Lake Moeris
replete with man made island and Pyramid was the irrigation of the largest sustainable agriforest in Egypt proper. The forbidding of damming the Nile River ensured the proper ecosystem stability for the intensive earthworm cultivation; i.e. they believed that such dams would lead to droughts up and downstream which would wreck their vermiculture system.
Again Jerry Minnich in the Earthworm Book (Rodale Press, 1972) astutely writes:
"It is believed that certain Egyptian priests devoted their full study of the earthworm and its work. Unfortunately, the results of their efforts have not survived, or have not so far been uncovered for modern man to examine."
Esoterically, the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) had as part of its 42 Books of Thoth (Hermetic Books) sections on the maintenance of their intensive earthworm cultivation (vermiculture) is clear from last Ptolomy Pharaoh Queen Cleopatra's decree to preserve and refer the "lowly earthworm." By this time in Ancient Egypt/Kemit the desertification process had seriously diminished the Sustainable Agri-Forest system of Ancient Egpyt/Kemit and its foundation of intensive earthworm cultivation (vermiculture).
The introduction of cattle into Africa by the "Theban Invader People" beginning in Predynastic Egypt/Kemit circa 10,000 BC. triggered the climatic changes and desertification processes that eventually reduced the Sustainable Agri-Forests and produced a "scarcity mentality" characteristic of "Herder People" from short food growing climates.
In conclusion the comparative anthropological fact is that all the Humanistic Classical
Societies used this aboriginal Sustainable Agri-Forest (SAF) Technology. Thus we find
the SAF Technology used by not only Ancient Egypt/Kemit but also the ISRAELI ESSENES, Mezo-American Toltecs, Andean South American Pre-Inca and Inca, North American Anasazi (Ancestors of the Pueblo and Navajo/Dine' Indians) and Mississippi Valley Mound Builder Native Americans as well. They too displayed this "Prosperity Mentality" of immense wealth and longevity with no Chronic Poverty.
These findings constitute the driving force behind the BRCA/Hope LA-USA Project Inc. human, land and community development work in its 12 element Sustainable AgriForestry Model today presented in detail on the Hope LA-USA Project Web Site http://www.hopelausa.org/Page9.html!

“...toward the Divine Power which called into being all things, visible and invisible. Of its majesty and boundless perfection we dare not even think. It is enough for us to know that IT exists and IT is all wise. Enough that in common with our fellow creatures we possess a spark of ITS essence.
The supreme power {the Godhead} whom we revere is the boundless and endless one, the grand ‘CENTRAL SPIRITUAL SUN’ by whose attributes and the visible effects of whose inaudible WILL we are surrounded, the God of the ancient and the God of modern seers.
His nature can be studied only in the worlds called forth by his mighty FIAT. His revelation is traced with his own finger in imperishable figures of universal harmony upon the face of the Cosmos. It is the INFALLIBLE gospel we recognize.”

EXHIBIT I_A: Tentyra Temple Circular Zodiac - Record of Earth Pole Shifts
(Figures from pg. 108 of Peter Clayton’s Rediscovery of Ancient Egypt (1982) (copied from V. Denon’s Description de 'lEgypt 1809)
EXHIBIT NOTES:
• As it’s name implies the “City of Middle Annu” or Tentyra (Dendera) besides being the sixth nome capital in ancient Upper Egypt/Kemit, was a satellite enclave of the
Egyptian Mystery School of On which was located in the “City of North Annu (On).” Tentyra (Dendera) Temple was dedicated to the Goddess Het Heru (Hathor)
exoterically the goddess of fertility and the sky. Esoterically Hathor was the Third Spiritual Plane Sun Goddess of the Egyptian Mystery School of On spirituality system the Aten Path. Annu King Narmer and King Scorpian as well as Pharaoh Amenemhet III wore cows tails and necklaces attesting to her spirituality.
• The esoteric history that the earth is presently upside down and off-axis was recorded in an original astronomical 36 star "decan" circular and concentric star map in the original Hathor Temple that dated back at least to the Fourth Dynasty rein of Pharaoh Khufu (circa 2613 to 2494 BC). The Ptolemy Greeks (350 –30 BC) rebuilt the temple on the old temple’s foundation and modified the original circular concentric star map with the 12 Greek Zodiac astrological signs. Found by Napoloeon’s Scientific Expedition to Egypt at the end of the 19th Century in the ceiling of the Hathor Temple roof chapel it was dynamited off the ceiling and resides now in the Louvre Museum in Paris France.
• Esoterically within its 3 superimposed circular star maps are millions of years of history!
"This Zodiac, with its mysterious 3 Virgos between the Lion and Libra, has found its Edipus, who understand the riddIe of these signs, and justified the truthfulness of those priests who told Herodotus in his Book II, paragraph 142 that:
a. The poles of the Earth and the Ecliptic had formerly coincided;
b. That ever since their first zodiacal records were commenced, the Poles have been 3 times within the plane of the Ecliptic, as the {Egyptian Mystery School of On} Initiates were taught.” (M. Blavatsky, Secret Doctrine II, pg. 368).

EXHIBIT I_A-2: Tentyra Temple Circular Zodiac - Record of Earth Pole Shifts
• The poles and Ecliptic coinciding means that originally the magnetic and geographic north poles coincided (as of course the magnetic and geographic south poles coincided); i.e. the earth is now unnaturally upside down and off-axis. Remember that the “plane of the Ecliptic” represents the magnetic poles which are "off axis” 23 degrees from the revolving geographic pole axis plane. The North Pole is magnetically negatively charged since the positively charged end of a compass points to the North Pole and opposites attract.
• Winter soltices in the Northern Hemisphere of which ancient Egypt/Kemit belongs now have sun risings in Capricorn, not Cancer as in the Dendera Zodiac!
“As asserted by the Egyptian Priests to Herodotus, who was informed that the terrestrial Pole and the Pole of the Ecliptic had formerly coincided, thus was it found and corroborated by Mackay (“The Mythological Astronomy of the Ancients Demonstrated”). ‘Capricorn is represented at the North Pole, and Cancer is divided, near its middle at the South Pole, which is a confirmation that originally they had their winters when the Sun was in Cancer: but the chief characteristics of the {Zodiac} being a monument commemorating the first time that the Pole had been in that position, are the Lion and the Virgo.” (M. Blavatsky, Ibid. pg. 431) (emphasis added)
• “On the Dendera Zodias the lion stands upon the Hydra and his tail is almost straight pointing downwards at an angle of 40 or 50 degrees this position agreeing with the original conformation of these constellations.”
Virgo #1 Lion #2 Lion #1
• “But in many places we see the Lion (Simha); MacKey adds with his tail turned up over his back and ending with a Serpent’s head; thereby showing that the lion had been "inverted" which indeed, must have been the case with the whole Zodiac and every other constellation, when the Pole had been inverted {shifted}.”
“Speaking of the circular Zodiac, the Virgin is nursing her child; but it seems that they had not had that idea when the pole was first within the plane of the Ecliptic: for in this Zodiac. . . we see three Virgins between the Lion and the Scales, the last of which holds in her hand an ear of wheat.”
Virgo#2 Virgo #3
“.....the meaning is plain, as the 3 Zodicas {concentric, one for each of 3 Virgos} belong to 3 different epochs. (M. Blavatsky, ibid, pg. 433)
Esoterically to be explained fully in Volume II, there have been 3 pole shifts:
NSN S Shift # 1 # 2 # 3 SNS N
corresponding to the 3 Virgos, accompanied by a deluge (flood and/or ice age). This explains the upside down, off-axis condition of the planet earth today! See EXHIBIT I_D-4-1, EXHIBIT I_D_4-2, EXHIBIT I-D_4-3, EXHIBIT I- D_4-4 and EXHIBIT I_D_4-5.

EXHIBIT I_B-1: Giza Egypt Plateau Complex _North Latitude 30 Geodetics and “Base 60” Survey Mathematics
(FROM HANCOCK AND BAUVAL, THE MESSAGE OF THE SPHINX, 1996, FIGURE 5, PG. 39)
EXHIBIT NOTES:
• “ .... The earth’s equatorial circumference of 24,902 miles works out at around 132 million feet, with the result that a degree of latitude at the equator is equivalent to approximately 366,600 feet (i.e. 132 million feet divided by 360 degrees). Each degree is divided into 60 arc minutes, which means that 1 arc minute is then further subdivided into 60 arc seconds __ with the result that 1 arc second is equivalent to a distance of 101 feet.
This system of measuring by degrees is not a modern convention but rather an inheritance of scientific thinking, connected to ‘base 60’ mathematics, that dates back to the remotest antiquity [For further discussion see Graham Hancock, Fingerprints of the Gods, The Evidence of Earth’s Lost Civilization, Chapter 48]. It seems, however, to have been
employed in the geodetic and astronomical calculations that were used to locate the Great Pyramid __ for the monument is positioned barely a mile to the south of latitude 30; i.e. almost exactly one third of the way between the equator and the north pole.” [from Piazzi Smyth, The Great Pyramid, Bell Publishing Co., NY, 1990, pp. 79-80]
“ It is unlikely that this choice of location could have come about by chance. Moreover, because no suitable site for such a massive structure exists a mile or so to the north, it would be inadvisable to assume that the fractional offset from the thirtieth parallel could have been caused by a surveying error on the part of the Pyramid builders.
“ This offset amounts to 1 arc minute and 9 arc seconds __ since the [Great] Pyramid’s true latitude is 29 degrees 58’ 51”. Interestingly, however as a former Astronomer Royal of Scotland has observed:
‘If the original designer had wished that men should see with their bodily, rather than their mental eyes, the pole of the sky from the foot of the Great Pyramid, at an altitude before them of 30 degrees, he would have had to take account of the refraction of the atmosphere; and that would have necessitated the building standing not at latitude 30 degrees but at latitude 29 degrees 58’ 22”.’ [Piazzi Smyth, Ibid, pp 80]”
” In other words the monument turns out to be situated less than half an arc minute to the north of astronomical latitude 30 degrees, uncorrected for atmospheric refraction. Any ‘error’ involved is thus reduced to less than half of one-sixtieth of one degree __ a hair’s breadth in terms of the earth’s circumference as a whole.” (Hancock and Bauval, Ibid, pp 39-40)
• The Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) had such astronomy survey mathematics.

EXHIBIT I_B-3: Giza Egypt Plateau Complex __ Overhead Diagram and Dimensions
North Coordinate
(FROM HANCOCK AND BAUVAL, THE MESSAGE OF THE SPHINX , 1996, FIGURE 2, PG. 24)
EXHIBIT NOTES:
• Compare with the EXHIBIT I_B-2 southeastern view photograph to appreciate the exactly planned layout along the cardinal north-south and east-west directional coordinates the ancient architects of the Giza Plateau Complex utilized. Especially note the 45 degree diagonal that the three Pyramids lie on from the Great Pyramid south west to the Second Pyramid with the Third Pyramid offset somewhat forward of that diagonal to the east.
• The Sphinx Rock Sculpture and its Sphinx Temple and Valley Temples are exactly lined up facing the Eastern Horizon where the Sunrises daily.
• The 3 Great Pyramids are aligned along a diagonal that mimics the Orion Constellation’s 3 Belt Stars. The Orion Constellation was associated by the Ancient Egyptian Mystery
School of On (Annu) with the First Spiritual Plane Sun God Asar, who is confounded by the Theban Sorcery Lodges and in turn Egyptologists with the God of Resurrection Osiris.
“The Great Pyramid was originally 481.3949 feet in height (now reduced to just a little over 450 feet) and its four sides each measure some 755 feet in length at the base. The Second Pyramid was originally slightly lower __ with a designed height of 471 feet __ and has sides measuring just under 708 feet in length. The Third Pyramid stands some 215 feet tall and has a side length at the base of 356 feet.” (Hancock and Bauval, Ibid, page 37)
• ”... ‘impossible’ __ at any rate for a people like the ancient Egyptians who are supposedly to have known nothing about the true shape and size of our planet __ is the relationship, in a scale of 1:43,200, that exists between the dimensions of the [Great] Pyramid and the dimensions of the earth. Setting aside for the moment the question of whether we are dealing with coincidence here, it is a simple fact, verifiable on any calculator, that if you take the
monument’s original height (481.3949 feet) and multiply it by 43,200 you get a quotient of 3,938.685 miles. This is an underestimate by just 11 miles of the true figure for the polar radius of the earth (3949 miles) worked out by the best modern methods.”
“ Likewise, if you take the monument’s perimeter at the base (3023.16 feet) and multiply by 43,200 then you get 24,734.94 miles __ a result that is within 170 miles of the true equatorial circumference of the earth (24,902 miles) .....a minus-error of only three quarters of a single per cent.” (Hancock and Bauval, Ibid, page 38) (emphases added)

EXHIBIT I_B-4: Predynastic Giza Egypt Plateau Complex _ Cardinal Point Alignment and Geometrical Mathematics
(FROM HANCOCK AND BAUVAL, THE MESSAGE OF THE SPHINX , 1996, FIGURE 4, PG. 33)
EXHIBIT NOTES:
• This Meridian and Eastern Horizon Diagram of the Giza Plateau Complex shows the exact cardinal, astronomical and geometrical architectural elements of its design.
“ It is fairly well known that the Pyramid was aligned by its architects to the cardinal point (with its north face directed north, its east face directed east, etc, etc.). Less well known is just how eerily exact is the precision of these alignments__ with the average deviation from true being only a little over 3 arc minutes (i.e. about 5 per cent of a single degree).[I.E.S. Edwards, The Pyramids of Egypt, p. 208]” (Hancock & Bauvel, Ibid , Pg. 41)
• All face exactly east with Meridian Line dissecting a circle around the Second Pyramid.
“ The causeway of the Third Pyramid, like the gaze of the Sphinx, is targeted due east. The causeway of the Second Pyramid points 14 degrees south of due east. The causeway of the Great Pyramid points 14 degrees north of due east. The arrangement is precise, geometrical, obviously deliberate, with each significant structure bearing a designed relationship to every other structure __ and the whole contained within a large, circular artificial ‘horizon’ that is apparently centered on the apex of the Second Pyramid with its rim lying just to the west of the rump of the Sphinx.” (Hancock & Bauval, Ibid, Pg. 34)
• Note the 45 degree diagonal that the three Pyramids lie on from the Great Pyramid south west to the Second Pyramid with the Third Pyramid offset somewhat to the east.
“... ‘almost impossible’ since the mathematical value pi (3.14) is not supposed to have been calculated by any civilization until the Greeks stumbled upon it in the third century BC [The supposed discoverer was Archimedes.] is the fact the designed height of the Great Pyramid __ 481.3949 feet __ bears the same relationship to its base perimeter (3023.16 feet) as does the circumference of any circle to its radius. This relationship is 2 pi (i.e. 481.3949 feet x 2 x 3.14 = 3023.16 feet).
• Obviously, the Greek mathematician Archimedes who “discovered” the value of the circle pi, like the Ionic Greek Philosopher Pythagoras before him who supposedly derived the
hypotenuse theory of a right triangle; were taught these mathematical principles as
students of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu).

(from S. Glubok’s The Art of Egypt: Under the Pharaohs, pg. 5, photo by Dietrich Wildung)
EXHIBIT NOTES:
• In 1992 and 1993 writer John B. West (in 2\93 Conde Nast Traveler Magazine) and geologist Robert M. Schoch (in 8\92 Omni Magazine) using computer assisted
geological analysis and seismic monitoring corroborated French Egyptologist R.A.
Schwaller de Lubicz’s theory of a (Sacred Science) “lost people” having established the ancient Egyptian civilization based on the weathering rain erosion of the Great Sphinx, i.e., it was sculpted in situ from the natural limestone rock plateau at Giza Egypt between 5,000 to 10,500 B.C.
• John A. West describes Schwaller de Lubicz’s theory:
“Based on seventeen years’ work in Egypt, mainly in Luxor, Schwaller de Lubicz had developed a total reinterpretation of Egyptian civilization. In his view, Egypt was not a kind of misguided dry run for ancient Greece, from which our modern societies eventually developed. Rather, it was the higher source, and Greece, even at its height, a pale imitation (a view, it should be noted, held by many ancient Greeks). Nor did Egypt spring miraculously and fully formed out of a primitive neolithic melting pot somewhere around 3,000 B.C. According to Schwaller de Lubicz, the civilization we know as dynastic Egypt was itself built upon knowledge handed down from earlier, highly advanced civilizations that disappeared without a trace — or almost without a trace.”
“This was not a fantasy of Schwaller de Lubicz’s, nor did it come to him via channeled New Age entities. Several fragmentary Egyptian texts refer specifically to two earlier civilizations in Egypt dating back tens of thousands of years. Solon, in Plato’s Timaeus claims to have heard a similar story direct from an Egyptian priest.” (from J.A. West, ‘Civilization Rethought’ in Conde Nast Traveler, Feb 93, pg. 104)
• “If the single fact of the water erosion of the Sphinx could be confirmed, it would in itself overthrow all accepted chronologies of the history of civilizations; it would force a drastic re-evaluation of the assumptions of ‘progress’ __ the assumption upon which the whole of modern education is based. It would be difficult to find a single, simple question with graver implications. [John A. West, Serpent, op cit, p.186] (Hancock and Bauval, The Message of the Sphinx, pg 16)

EXHIBIT NOTES:
• “The Sphinx was carved by first excavating a large trench around a monolithic central core of limestone which was shaped into the form of a lion.”
“This photograph (above), taken from the Great Pyramid, shows the Sphinx in the trench, the remains of the so-called Sphinx Temple (immediately in front, i.e., to the east of the monument) and Valley Temple (a little to the South). Also shown, running down the south side of the Sphinx is the gigantic causeway of Khafre.” (Hancock & Bauval, Ibid, 1996, pg. 176, figure 2)
• “The evidence presented in this book concerning the origins and antiquity of the monuments of the Giza necropolis suggests that the genesis and original planning and layout of the site may be dated, using the tools of modern computer-aided “archaeological-astronomy”, to the epoch of 10,500 B.C. We have also argued, on the basis of a combination of geological, architectural, and “archaeological-astronomical” indicators, that the Great Sphinx, its associated Megalithic ‘temples’ and at least the lower courses of the so-called ‘Pyramid of Khafre’ {the “second” whose foundation is made up of the natural rock of limestone at the Giza locations}, may in fact have been built at that exceedingly remote date.” (Hancock & Bauval, ibid, 1996, pg. 303) (Emphasis Added)
• Esoterically, the “lost people civilization” conceptualized by authors de Lubicz, West and Schoch black African Anu Peoples who established the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) and the civilization known as ancient Egypt. The Sphinx is shown with the cobra\ureaus on its head, indicating the Aten Path existed at 10,500 B.C.
• As to the logical question of what similar monuments existed contemporary with a Sphinx built in 10,500 B.C., i.e., by the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu)
esoterically it must be realized that the ancient historian Manethos and Herodotus both report the first dynasty beginning around 8,000 to 9,000 B.C. Thus the remnants are there but not recognized, e.g., many pyramid remnants exist in mounds of ruble but can not be identified as to builder or time of construction.

(From John A. West, "The Sphinx: Clue To A Lost Civilization?" in Conde Nast Traveler, February 1993, Page 101)
EXHIBIT NOTES:
• This north side view of the Sphinx Rock Sculpture shows the immense proportions of the largest sculpture in the world. Note the huge trench that was quarried with
limestones of up to 200 tons removed and used for the Sphinx Temple seen in front of its paws and the Valley Temple to its right not shown. Note the controversial 12
foot deep heavy rain water erosion patterns seen clearly on the leonine body of the Sphinx. The heavy vandalization of the face of the Sphinx is also seen from this
view, debatable as having been done deliberately by Arab and/or Napoleonic cannon fire to disfigure its obvious black African Anu People facial features.

EXHIBIT NOTES:
• Compare the southeastern view photograph of EXHIBIT I_B-2 with this overhead diagram of the Sphinx Rock Sculpture and its Sphinx Temple, Valley Temple and appreciate the exact east-west and north-south coordinates used by the architects of these monuments which are facing due east. The Second (Khefre) Pyramid’s Causeway that connects the Valley temple to the Mortuary temple is not drawn to scale but is directionally correct.
• Note that no mummified bodies were found in these temples or any inscriptions or other artifacts have been found on them to date their construction.
• Also note that the Sphinx Rock Sculpture is attributed to Fourth Dynasty Pharaoh Khafre, son of Pharaoh Khufu (Chepren) who is also given the construction of the Second Pyramid. However this is based on circumstantial evidence including the syllable “Khef” found on the damaged Sphinx Stele of Pharaoh Thothmose IV __ shown in EXHIBIT III_B-3_4 that
stands between the Sphinx’s paws. However no Pharaonic Cartouche surrounds this “Khef “syllable thus it can not be the name of the Sphinx building Pharaoh.
• Esoterically, it is not conclusively known who built the Sphinx Rock Sculpture, its Sphinx and Valley Temples or the 3 Great Pyramids nor exactly when they were built. No ancient authentic Hieroglyphic inscriptions on the monuments nor documents on the subject exists.

THE NORTH VIEW OF THE GIZA COMPLEX OF THE SPHINX ROCK SCULPTURE TEMPLES, THE SPHINX ‘MONOLITHIC TEMPLE" IN THE FOREGROUND AND THE MASSIVE SPHINX VALLEY "ENTRANCE TEMPLE" IN THE BACKGROUND WITH STONES IN EXCESS OF 200 TONS (FROM HANCOCK AND BAUVAL'S THE MESSAGE OF THE SPHINX, 1996 PICTURE 19)
What follows with emphasis added is an excellent and exhaustive analysis of the Sphinx (Mortuary) Temple and the Sphinx Valley (Entrance) Temple by Graham Hancock and Robert Bauval in their outstanding book The Message Of The Sphinx, pages 26 to 32 presented in its entirety because it highlights the “Impossible Engineering” of these awesome and mysterious structures.
“Approaching Giza from the east, through the modern Arab village of Naziet-el-Sammam, one comes first to the Great Sphinx — which rears its grizzled head above an ugly bus-park and a crowd of tourist shops and cafés. Fortunately the ground has been cleared for a distance of about two hundred meters in front of the monument, giving an open view of the enormous and unusual architectural complex that has surrounded it since time immemorial.”
“This complex consists of the so-called ‘Sphinx Temple’ and the ‘Valley Temple of Khafre’, the former lying immediately to the east of the Sphinx, and directly overlooked by it, the latter lying a little to the south of the Sphinx Temple, separated from it by a narrow corridor but in direct alignment a bit like two chunky, detached houses standing side by side.”
“The layout of these monuments, and the relationship that both of them have to the Sphinx and its enclosure, are best appreciated from the plans and photographs reproduced herewith. The Valley Temple is the larger of the two, being almost square and measuring approximately 130 feet along each side; the Sphinx Temple is more pronouncedly rhomboidal with side lengths of about 100 feet.”
“Originally around 40 feet high, both monuments are built out of massive limestone coreblocks and both were at one time fitted with inner and outer casings of granite. These casings and much of the core masonry have been removed from the Sphinx Temple, leaving it in a very dilapidated state. By contrast the Valley Temple is still largely intact. Both monuments are roofless, lacking their original ceiling beams. In the case of the Valley Temple, however, sixteen original interior columns and architraves remain in place in the T-shaped central hall, creating graceful patterns of light and shadow.”

EXHIBIT I_C-5_2: Predynastic Great “Sphinx” HU Rock Sculpture Masterpiece at Giza, Circa 10,500 BC. __ 5. Sphinx Mortuary & Valley Entrance Temples
What follows with emphasis added is the continuation of an excellent and exhaustive analysis of the Sphinx
(Mortuary) Temple and the Sphinx Valley (Entrance) Temple by Graham Hancock and Robert Bauval in their outstanding book The Message Of The Sphinx, pages 26 to 32:
“The unifying features of these ancient and anonymous structures are the stark, undecorated austerity of the building style, and the use throughout of ponderous megaliths — many of which are estimated to weigh in the range of 200 tons apiece. 1 (For block weights see I.E.S. Edwards, The Pyramids of Egypt, op cit, p. 215; John Anthony West, Serpent in the Sky: The High Wisdom of Ancient Egypt, Quest Books, Wheaton, Il., 1993, p. 242; John Anthony West, The Traveler’s Key to Ancient Egypt, Harrap Columbus, London, 18989, pp. 143-5; NBC tlevision documentary interview Mystery of the Sphinx, 1993; DR. Joseph Davidovits and Marge Morris, The Pyramids: An Enigma Solved, Dorset Press, New York, 1988, p. 51).
There are no small blocks here at all: every single piece of stone is enormous—the least of them weighing more than 50 tons — and it is difficult to understand how such monsters could have been lifted and maneuvered into place by the ancient Egyptians. Indeed, even today, contractors using the latest construction technology would face formidable challenges if they were commissioned to produce exact replicas of the Sphinx Temple and the Valley Temple.”
“The problems are manifold but stem mainly from the extremely large size of the blocks — which can be envisaged in terms of their dimensions and weight as a series of diesel locomotive engines stacked one on top of the other. Such loads simply cannot be hoisted by the typical tower and hydraulic cranes that we are familiar with from building sites in our cities. These cranes, which are pieces of advanced technology, can generally ‘pick’ a maximum load of 20 tons at what is called ‘minimum span’ — i.e. at the closest distance to the tower along the ‘boom’ or ‘arm’ of the crane. The longer the span the smaller the load and at ‘maximum span’ the limit is around 5 tons.”
“Loads exceeding 50 tons require special cranes. Furthermore, there are few cranes in the world today that would be capable of picking 200-ton blocks of quarried limestone. Such cranes would normally have to be of the ‘bridge’ or ‘gantry’ type, often seen in factories and at major industrial ports where they are used to move large pieces of equipment and machinery such as bulldozers, military tanks, or steel shipping containers. Built with structural steel members and powered with massive electric motors, the majority of these cranes have a load limit of under 100 tons. In short, a commission to put together a temple out of 200-ton blocks would be a most unusual and very taxing job, even for modern heavy-load and crane specialists.”
“In the United States there are presently only two land-based cranes of the ‘counterweight and boom’ type able to handle loads in the 200-ton range. Recently one was brought in to a Long Island construction site to lift a 200 ton boiler into a factory. The crane has a boom 220 feet long (at one end of which is 160 ton concrete counterweight which keeps it from tipping over). A crew of 20 men had to work for six weeks to prepare the ground before the boiler could be lifted.” 2. (NBC television documentary interview, Mystery of the Sphinx, 1993.)
“The biggest technical challenge of building a replica of the Valley Temple would be the need to lift hundreds of such weights and to do so within the physical limitations of the Giza site. In order to overcome that challenge the ideal crane would have to be of the gantry or bridge type, made mobile by being mounted on steel tracks — which would have to be set up within, or around, the confined area of the temple structure itself.”
“Not surprisingly, when the crane engineer responsible for lifting the 200-ton boiler on Long Island was shown photographs and given technical details concerning the blocks of the Valley Temple— and asked whether he thought that he could hoist similar blocks into place with his crane — he replied: ‘I’m looking at what you’re showing me here, and looking at the distances involved I don’t know if we would be able to pick the 200-ton blocks from the positions that I see available to us . . In my business we pick heavy loads, and we look to see how heavy loads were picked by other people before us. And seeing how they moved these heavy blocks, 200-ton blocks, thousands and thousands of years ago, I have no idea how they did this job. It’s a mystery and it’ll probably always be a mystery to me, and maybe to everybody.’ 3 (NBC television documentary interview, Mystery of the Sphinx, 1993) “ For further discussion see EXHIBIT I_C-5-3

EXHIBIT I_C-5_3: Predynastic Great “Sphinx” HU Rock Sculpture Masterpiece at Giza, Circa 10,500 BC. __ 5. Sphinx Mortuary & Valley Entrance Temples
What follows with emphasis added is the continuation of an excellent and exhaustive analysis of the Sphinx (Mortuary) Temple and the Sphinx Valley (Entrance) Temple by Graham Hancock and Robert Bauval in their outstanding book The Message Of The Sphinx, pages 26 to 32:
“Mystery or not, the Valley Temple and the Sphinx Temple stand at Giza as mute testimony to the fact that certain builders in antiquity did know how to pick 200-ton loads, and did have the technical wherewithal to do the job. Furthermore, although it is reasonably certain that they did not do it with gantry or’ any other such cranes, we are in darkness as to how they did do it. Confronted by such questions Egyptologists tend to speak in vague and general terms of ‘earth ramps’ and ‘unlimited manpower’. ” 4 (See for example I.E.S. Edwards, Pyramids of Egypt, op.cit, p. 220; John Baines and Jaromir Malek, Atlas of Ancient Egypt, Time-Life Books, 1990, pp. 138-9.)
“Engineers, however are required to be more specific and to address themselves to the issues of the precise kinds of ramps that would have been required — up which such big blocks could have been dragged — and the precise numbers of men that would have been needed to drag them.”
“No detailed technical studies have ever been undertaken at Giza concerning the logistics of building the Sphinx and Valley Temples. The(3 Great) Pyramids, however — which Egyptologists also believe were built with ramps — have been studied quite closely by a number of highly qualified architects and engineers. 5 (The most thorough study is provided in Peter Hodges (Julian Keable ed.), How the Pyramids were Built, Element Books, 1989) What these studies have indicated is that the maximum feasible gradient for a construction ramp up which heavy loads could be hauled by men on foot is 1 in 10. 6 (Peter Hodges, How the Pyramids were Built, pp. 11) In the case of the Great Pyramid, which originally reached a height of 481 feet, this would have called for a ramp 4800 feet long and almost three times as massive as the Pyramid itself. 7 (Peter Hodges, How the Pyramids were Built, pp. 11-13)”
“Of course, such a problem does not apply where the Sphinx Temple and the Valley Temple are concerned because their original constructed height was much lower than that of the Pyramids and they therefore could have been approached by relatively short 1-in-10 ramps. The fearsome mass and weight of the many 200—ton blocks found in these temples, however, rules out the use of any ramp made of materials less stable than the limestone ashlars of the temples themselves.8 (Peter Hodges, How the Pyramids were Built, pp. 13)”
“Let us assume, then, that solid stone ramps were used and then later dismantled and cleared away. The question now becomes: how many men would be required to haul hundreds of 200-ton blocks up such ramps? To get this problem into perspective it is helpful to realize that a block of 200 tons represents a load roughly equivalent to 300 family-sized automobiles (each with an average weight of three-quarters of a ton).”
“Again, we do not have a technical study on the Sphinx and Valley Temples to refer to. Fortunately, however, a relevant study has been undertaken at the Great Pyramid where the French master engineer Jean Leherou Kerisel, a consultant for the building of the Cairo Metro, worked out the logistics of hauling into place the 70-ton blocks that were used in the construction of the so-called King’s Chamber. According to his calculations the job could just about have been done — although with enormous difficulty — with teams of 6oo men arranged in ranks across a very wide ramp buttressed against one face of the Pyramid. 9
“Jean Kerisel, a prominent soils engineer in France and also President of the Franco-Egyptian Society, did an extensive study in the hauling of large blocks using human labour and wooden sledges. Kerisel kindly made this study – La Grande Pyramide et ses Derniers Secrets – available to us prior to its publication (due 1996). The basis of his calculations is that the pressure on the soil cannot exceed 1.5 tons/sq. m. for ramps made of compacted soil (probably covered with stone slabs) with the slopes not exceeding 8 per cent. The friction coefficient has been calculated at 15 per cent using soaked lime as the lubricant. Kerisel noted that a greater pressure than 1.5 tons would cause the lubricant to seep away and thus the friction coefficient would increase, making hauling more difficult. The average speed has been worked out to be 0.3 meters/second with a 13-kilogram traction force produced by each man. Thus the hauling of a 70-ton block would require (07,000 x o.15 x 1/13 +) 807 men and take some 9.25 hours for a ramp of one kilometer. Merisel worked out that it the traction was much higher than 13 kg/man __ even for a short period of time __ the result would be serious back injuries. Thus assuming at least 1-meter distance between each standing man, 807 men in 6 rows would need a ramp space of 134.5 meters long and 6 meter wide. The problem, of course, is greatly increased for blocks of 200 tons within the confined working conditions of the Sphinx and Valley Temples __ a task almost impossible to imagine with such primitive techniques.”

EXHIBIT I_C-5_4: Predynastic Great “Sphinx” HU Rock Sculpture Masterpiece at Giza, Circa 10,500 BC. __ 5. Sphinx Mortuary & Valley Entrance Temples
What follows with emphasis added is the continuation of an excellent and exhaustive analysis of the Sphinx
(Mortuary) Temple and the Sphinx Valley (Entrance) Temple by Graham Hancock and Robert Bauval in their outstanding book The Message Of The Sphinx, pages 26 to 32:
“From this it follows that teams 1800 men strong would have been required to haul the Valley Temple blocks. But could 1800 men have been effectively harnessed to such dense and relatively compact loads (the maximum dimensions of each block are 30 feet by 10 feet by 12 feet)? And more to the point, since the temple walls do not exceed 130 feet along each side, how likely is it that such large teams could have been organized to work efficiently — or at all — in the limited space available? Assuming a minimum of three feet of horizontal space per man, each rank of haulers could not have contained more than fifty men. To make up the total of 1800 needed to move a 200-ton block, therefore, would have called for no less than thirty-six ranks of men pulling in unison, to be harnessed to each block.”
“We also need to ask when the work was done?
As noted earlier, the Sphinx Temple and the Valley Temple are both anonymous monuments. And although it is certain that use was made of the latter for Khafre’s funerary rituals, there is no proof that he built it. On the contrary, if Professor Robert Schoch’s geological evidence is correct, then it is quite certain that Khafre did not build either of these structures. This is so because the Sphinx itself was made by hewing a deep horseshoeshaped trench out of the bedrock of the Giza plateau, leaving a central core which was then carved into shape, and because geologists have been able to prove that the limestone megaliths used in both temples came from the trench and were thus quarried at the same time as the Sphinx. 10 (NBC television documentary interview, Mystery of the Sphinx, 1993.) It therefore follows, if the Sphinx is indeed thousands of years older than Egyptologists think it is, that the temples must also be thousands of years older.”
“What we may be looking at here are the fingerprints of highly sophisticated and perhaps even technological people capable of awe inspiring architectural and engineering feats at a time when no civilization of any kind is supposed to have existed anywhere on earth.”
“Supportive of this possibility is the fact that the megaliths of the temples demonstrate precisely the same apparent precipitation-induced weathering features as the Sphinx itself. And it is of interest to note that the surviving granite casing blocks seem to have been carved on their inner faces to fit over the limestone core-blocks at a time when these were already heavily marked by erosion. Since the granite casing has the look of other Old Kingdom Egyptian architecture (while the limestone core-blocks do not) this may be taken as further evidence of the theory that an ancient, revered and much-eroded structure was restored and renovated by the Old Kingdom Pharaohs. Robert Schoch certainly favors this view. ‘I remain convinced,’ comments the Boston University geology professor, ‘that the backs of the Old Kingdom granite facing stones were carved to match or complement the earlier weathering features seen on the surfaces of the core limestone blocks of the temples.” 11 (KMT Vol V, op. cit, p.7)

1. The Sphinx Points to Constellation Leo at Spring Equinox Rising Sign of 10,500 BC.
(FROM HANCOCK AND BAUVAL, THE MESSAGE OF THE SPHINX BY, 1996, FIGURE 28, PG. 75)
EXHIBIT NOTES:
• “ ... a mounting body of geological evidence suggests that it [the Sphinx Rock Sculpture] is ancient __ vastly older than the 4,500 years allocated by Egyptologists and perhaps dating back as far as the last Ice Age when no civilization capable of fashioning such a monument is supposed to have existed.”
“Such notions are of course controversial and hotly disputed. Moreover, as should be obvious by now, geology is incapable of providing us with a precise chronology and is particularly limited by the present state of our knowledge of palaeo-climatology. Indeed, the most we can say, on the sole basis of the monument’s [rainfall] erosion patterns, is that it does appear to have been carved at a much later date than Egyptologists believe but that its antiquity could range anywhere between 15,000 BC and 5000 BC.”
”There is, however, another science which, provided one essential precondition is fulfilled, can provide a much more accurate dating__ to within a few decades __ of uninscribed ancient stone monuments. This is the science of archaeoastronomy. The precondition upon which it depends for its successful functioning is that the monuments studied should have been accurately aligned to the stars or to rising points of the sun by their builders.”
“The Great Sphinx fulfills this precondition. It lies exactly along the east-west axis of the Giza necropolis with its patient and eternal gaze set perfectly towards the east. It is therefore, a superb “equinoctial marker”” its eyes target the exact position of sunrise at dawn on the spring equinox.” (From Hancock and Bauval, Ibid, Page 58-59)
• “ In the pre-dawn on the vernal [spring] equinox in 10,500 BC., with the sun 12 degrees below the horizon, the Great Sphinx would have gazed directly at his own celestial counterpart, the constellation of Leo __ which experienced what astronomers call its “helical rising” at this moment.” (From Hancock and Bauval, Ibid, Page 75)

2. The Three Pyramids’ Ground Plan Mimics the Orion Constellation South
East
(FROM HANCOCK AND BAUVAL, THE MESSAGE OF THE SPHINX, 1996, FIGURE 31, PG. 80)
EXHIBIT NOTES:
• As observed by Graham Hancock and Adrienne Gilbert’s book Orion Mystery (pages 97104) and detailed further in Graham Hancock and Robert Bevel’s book Message of the
Sphinx (pages 66- 82) the ground plan of the 3 Great Pyramids’ was designed to mimic the Orion Constellation’s Belt Stars of three central stars comprised of:
“ Al Nitak (Zeta Orionis), the brightest (and also the lowest) of the three star of Orion’s belt__ which the ancient Egyptians identified with Osiris, their god of resurrection and rebirth and the legendary bringer of civilization to the Nile Valley in a remote epoch referred to as Zep Tepi, the ‘First Time’. ” (from Hancock and Bauval, Ibid, pg 65)
• “ ... the strong correlation ... between the three belt stars of the Orion constellation and the ground-plan of the three Pyramids of Giza. An overhead view shows that the Great
Pyramid and the second Pyramid stretch out along a diagonal running 45 degrees to the south and west of the former’s eastern face. The third Pyramid, however, is offset somewhat to the east of this line. The resulting pattern mimics the sky where the three stars of Orion’s belt also stretch out along a ‘faulty’ diagonal. The first two stars (Al
Nitak and Al Nilan) are in direct alignment, like the first and second Pyramids, and the third star (Mintaka), lies offset somewhat to the east of the axis formed by the other two stars.”
“ .....Additional confirmation of its symbolic significance, however, is provided by the Milky Way, which the ancient Egyptians regarded as a kind of ‘Celestial Nile’ and which was spoken of in archaic funerary texts as the ‘Winding Waterway’. In the heavenly vault the belt stars of Orion lie to the west of the Milky Way, as though overlooking its banks on the ground the Pyramids stand perched above the west bank of the Nile.”
“ Faced by such symmetry, and by such a complex pattern of interlocking architectural and religious ideas, it is hard to resist the conclusion that the Pyramids of Giza represent a successful attempt to build Orion’s belt on the ground. This makes all the more sense when we recall the firm identification of the Orion constellation with the high god Osiris.” (from Hancock and Bauval, Ibid, pg 66-67) (emphases added)
• Esoterically, the Giza Rock Plateau Complex was the campus of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) which associated the Orion constellation with its First Spiritual Plane God Asar.

3. The Spring Equinox 10,500 BC Convergence of Constellations of Leo and Orion
(FROM HANCOCK AND BAUVAL, THE MESSAGE OF THE SPHINX, 1996, FIGURE 30, PG. 77)
EXHIBIT NOTES:
• Esoterically, at the Vernal (Spring) Equinox of 10,500 BC. marking the beginning of the Astronomical Age of Leo the Giza Egypt/Kemit Plateau Complex located just west of the Nile River on a limestone rock plateau at the earth’s 30 degree North Latitudinal Line; had
the ground plan position of the Sphinx Rock Sculpture and the 3 Pyramids facing exactly due east. Together they mimicked on the ground the celestial position of the unique convergence of the Constellation Leo (rising helically due east above the horizon) with the Constellation of Orion (aligned due south on the dissecting north-south Meridian Line) in the sky over the Giza Egypt/Kemit Plateau Complex). Consequently, in the sky at the Spring Equinox of 10,500 BC. the celestial position of the Constellation Leo helically
rose exactly east of the Milky Way on the Elliptical Path of the Sun and converged with the Constellation Orion lying just west of the Milky Way exactly on the north-south Meridian line at 9 degrees 20’ altitude south in the sky over the Giza Egypt/Kemit Plateau Complex.
Consequently, on earth at the Spring Equinox of 10,500 BC. the ground plan position of the Sphinx Rock Sculpture and the 3 Pyramids mimicked this unique convergence of the Constellation Leo with the Constellation Orion like a mirror image. The leonine body of the Sphinx Rock Sculpture pointed directly east across the Nile River to the helically rising Constellation Leo on the eastern horizon. The First (“Great” or Khufu) Pyramid, the Second (Khefra) Pyramid and Third (Menkare) Pyramid on the ground reflected their analogous celestial positions in the Orion Constellation as its Belt Stars of Al Nitak, Al Nilam and Mintaka respectively. The Nile River flows south to north just east of the Giza Limestone Rock Plateau on earth analogous to the celestial Milky Way spanning the length of our galaxy just east of the Orion Constellation in the sky along a south to north course.
• Esoterically, prior to the Spring Equinox of 10,500 BC. during the “Dynasty of the Gods” (40,000 to 10,000 BC.) discussed in Chapter One, page 9 the astronomer, architecture and temple engineering priests of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu)
designed, surveyed and constructed the Giza Egypt Plateau Complex. It was the main instructional university campus based on the 42 Books of Thoth and was the spirituality system initiation and training center of the Aten Path. The founding leaders and staff of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) were by definition priests who had
attained spiritual deification and become “human gods” called in the ancient documents of Egypt/Kemit as the shemsu-hor or “Followers of Horus” or the “Souls of Annu” __ Annu being the Most High God.

EXHIBIT NOTES:
• G. Hancock and R. Bauval’s The Message of the Sphinx uses computerized archaeoastronomy to create the above drawing of the Southeastern horizon at the Giza Rock Plateau Complex at the Vernal or Spring Equinox in 10,500 BC. This is the time period proposed as the construction completion time for the Sphinx Rock Sculpture and its Sphinx Temples. Constellation Leo (Heruakhti) rises on the eastern horizon on the left of the Milky Way Galaxy stars, the
Constellation Orion (Shu) and Constellation Canis Major ‘s Binary Star Sirius A & B (Sothis and Potolo) lie on the southern horizon meridian on the right of the Milky Way Galaxy stars.
• The Message of the Sphinx uses archaeoastronomy to propose that the Giza Plateau Complex and its Sphinx Rock Sculpture and 3 Great Pyramids are “continual astronomical meridian and latitude tracking time monuments” that mimic exactly the 10,500 BC Spring
Equinox southeastern sky. Specifically, with the Nile River analogous to the Milky Way Galaxy stars the Sphinx Rock Sculpture points directly east across the Nile River to the
Constellation Leo; and the 3 Great Pyramids match the Constellation Orion’s 3 Belt Stars with the Constellation Canis Major’s Star Sirius A & B (Sothis and Potolo) directly below Orion on the southern horizon meridian to the right or west of the Milky Way Galaxy stars.
• Esoterically, the construction completion time of the Giza Rock Plateau Complex was 10,500 BC designated by its “continual astronomical meridian and latitude tracking time monuments” the Sphinx Rock Sculpture and the 3 Great Pyramids. They were designed as a unit and constructed during the time period the historians Herodotus and Manethos called the Dynasty of the Gods by the aboriginal human “gods” or “Souls of Annu” of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu).
These human “gods also engineered the United Nile River with a man made canal called the White Nile River connecting the paleolithically bifurcated Nile River; created the Nile River cataract free land of Ancient Egypt/Kemit Proper in an area submerged beneath the Mediterranean Sea with silt from the now United Nile River they fabricated; made the horticultural irrigation Lake Moeris and feed canal and produced the “Table of the Sun”. See Chapter Two.
• Thus the Giza Plateau Complex was not only the university campus of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) and the initiation and training center for its Aten Path spirituality system; but was collectively itself a “continual astronomical meridian and latitude tracking time monument” to these colossal feats of planetary geodesic hydrologic and horticultural design and civil engineering that produced the Nile River Valley.

EXHIBIT I_D-4-2: Archaeoastronomy of Giza Plateau Complex: Constellation Convergences at 10,500 BC. Equinox ___ 2. The Significance of the Milky Way Galaxy
2. The Significance of the Milky Way Galaxy of Planet Earth’s Solar System
(from NASA Infrared Astronomy Satellite, Encyclopedia Britannica, 2002)
EXHIBIT NOTES:
• Modern astronomy knows our Solar System is in the Milky Way Galaxy, a “spiral” galaxy with a 150,000 light year wide disc. Our sun is 27,000 light years from the Galactic center nucleus, most likely a black hole with a mass equal to 4.0 million suns. As an internal part of this Galaxy it is difficult to optically observe the various other Milky Way Galaxy parts from our Solar System because of the cosmic dust. The above picture of the Milky Way Galaxy center was made with infrared light by the NASA Infrared Astronomy Satellite (IRAS), with the center bulge its disc and yellow and green colors from the interstellar gas and cosmic dust. Modern astronomy does not know what the “dark matter” is that constitutes most of the material of the Milky Way Galaxy.
• The Constellation Canis Major Binary Star of Sirius A (“Dog Star”, Sothis) is the brightest star in the sky, and its invisible to the naked eye star partner Sirius B (“Potolo”) is an incredibly heavy White Dwarf Star. Modern astronomy just discovered that the Milky Way Galaxy is rotating in the Universe around the binary star Sirius only 8.6 light years from our Solar System. Yet the ancient astronomer priests of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) knew that Sirius is the center of our Solar System thousands of years ago:
“The fact is that ancient Egypt possessed a very complete solar, lunar, and Sothic calendar(s). The Sothic cycle is established on the coincidence every 1,460 years of the vague year of 365 days with the Sothic (or Sirian) year of 3651⁄4 days. All civil acts were dated according to the vague year, composed of exactly 360 days plus the five epagomenal days consecrated to the .... [Gods] : Osiris, Isis, Seth, Nephthys and Horus.”
“The Sirian, or fixed year, was established according to the helical rising of Sirius, yet the interval between two helical risings of Sirius corresponds neither to the tropical year, which is shorter, nor to the sidereal year, which is longer. For it is remarkable that owing to the
precession of the equinoxes on the one hand, and the movement of Sirius on the other, the position of the sun with respect to Sirius is displaced in the same direction, almost exactly to the same extent.”
“Calculations established by astronomers have demonstrated that between 4231 and 2231 BC., the approximate duration of the reign of the Bull, Hap, the Sirian year was almost identical to our Julian year of 365 1⁄4 days. This period would cover the entire Ancient Empire, ‘and we can not but admire the greatness of a science capable of discovering the coincidence because Sirius is the only star among the ‘fixed stars’ which allows the cycle.
It can therefore be supposed that Sirius plays the role of a center for the circuit [rotation] of our entire solar system’.”
“ Thus the double star of Sirius was chosen for these coincidences because it is the only star that moves the needed distance and in the right direction against the background of the other stars. This fact, known four thousand years before our time and forgotten until our day, obviously demands an extraordinary and prolonged observation of the sky.”

3. The Significance of Constellation Canis Major Binary Star Sirius A and Sirius B
EXHIBIT NOTES: (FROM R.A. SCHWALLER DE LUBICZ, SACRED SCIENCE, IBID, Fig 1. Page 27)
• The above ancient Egyptian 36 decan star map segment shows the Orion Constellation and Sirius and suggests that Sirius is the center of our Milky Way Solar System with Orion leading the way with the Ankh followed by Sirius holding a bigger Ankh and thus source of his power. Jupiter, Saturn and Mars follow and with Orion all face Sirius.
“... there is yet other evidence [that Sirius is considered by the ancient Egyptians as the center of the Universe] Sirius, the Sothis of the ancients which was called the Great Provider, is constantly evoked in the Pyramid Texts:
‘Isis comes to thee [Osiris] joyous in thy love; Your seed rises in her, penetrating [spd.t] like Sirius [spd.t]. The penetrating [spdl Horus comes forth from thee in his name of Horus who-is-in-Sirius.’ [from R. O. Faulkner, The Ancient Egyptian Pyramid Texts, Oxford, 1969, 1635-1636]’ “ (from De Lubicz, Ibid, Page 27-28) (emphasis added)”
• R.O. Faulkner’s translation above of the Pyramid Texts conventionally associates Sirius and Orion with the Theban Sorcery Lodge’s Resurrection Goddess Isis and God Osiris. De Schwaller De Lubicz accepts this translation and continues this misinterpretation concluding that the decan star map above identifies Isis and Osiris with Sirius and Orion. Esoterically, the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) created the Pyramid Texts and the astronomy 36 decan star map; and thus Sirius and Orion are the First Spiritual Plane Sun Goddess Ast and Sun God Asar. The Theban Sorcery Lodge later developed their astrology zodiac with Sirius and Orion as Isis and Osiris. See Appendix I-B.
• “In the spirit of the temple, Sirius plays the role of the great eternal fire for our sun (which is the Eye of Re and not Ra himself). It took our own discoveries in atomism and astronomy to suggest yet another characteristic of Sirius which coincides with what we are beginning to know about the atomic nucleus, made up of a positron (a giant star of very weak density) accompanying a neutron whose volume is exceedingly small in relation to the atom, but where all its weight is concentrated (a dwarf star of incredible density). In 1934, calculation still
accorded the heavy companion of Sirius [Potolo, Sirius B] a specilic gravity of 50,000 (whereas gold, for example has a specific gravity of 19.3). This is an absolutely exceptional case with respect to other double stars and to our sun, which is generally accorded a specific gravity of 1.4 relative to water. But in 1953, according to new observations, it was possible to ascribe a density of 53,000 to this strange Sirian neutron which has not ceased to astound us.”
“ ‘The companion of Sirius constitutes a remarkable exception: its mass is indeed far superior to what its absolute magnitude would assign it, and in density seems on the order of fifty-three thousand times the density of water, a fact since confirmed by other research based on the theory of relativity.’ “
“The double star of Sirius—which for Pharaonic Egypt played the role of a central sun to our entire solar system—today suggests the existence of a cosmic system of atomic structure whose nucleus is this ‘Great Provider’ the Sothis (spd.t) of the ancients.” (from R.A. Schwaller De Lubicz, Sacred Science, Ibid, Page 27-28) (emphasis added)

4. The Significance of the Constellation Orion (Shu)
(FROM HANCOCK AND BAUVAL, THE MESSAGE OF THE SPHINX BY, 1996, FIGURE 56, PG. 219)
• Astronomer priests of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) associated
the Constellation Orion (Shu) with the First Spiritual Plane Sun God Asar. As also noted the astrologists of the Theban Sorcery Lodge associated the Constellation Orion with the Resurrection God Osiris, and modern Egyptologists mistakenly accept and pass on this misnomer. The Constellation Orion literally sits on the north–south meridian just above the southern horizon with the Star Sirius at its feet on the southern horizon and meridian intersection.
• Modern astronomers have centered on the study of the Constellation Orion which lies about 15,000 light years from earth. It has 4 massive Trapezium Stars which are bisected by the diagonal 3 Belt Stars mimicked by the 3 Great Pyramids. The Trapezium area is filled with hundreds of young hot stars of the Orion Nebula. The Nebula since first discovered in 1610 has captivated all astronomers. Classified as an “emission nebula” its faint extensions fill most of the other areas of the Constellation Orion.
From Hubbel Space Telescope, (NASA photo # STScI-PRC94-24a) Encylopedia Britannica, 2002
• Modern astronomy has confirmed the special power of the Constellation Orion especially with the assistance of the NASA Hubbel Space Telescope. The Constellation Orion is
shown above with a Trapezium Star in the upper left corner showing part of a ” giant stellar formation region with over 700 young stars” and “over 150 protoplanatary disks, or proplyds, which are believed to be embryonic solar systems that will eventually form planets. These stars and proplyds generate most of the nebula’s light”. (Encyclopedia Britannica, 2002)
• Astronomer priests of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) were taught the spiritual cosmogony that the Constellation Orion as the First Spiritual Plane God
Asar and Sirius as the First Spiritual Plane Sun Goddess Ast emanated from themselves all that is in this Solar System we call the Milky Way Galaxy. Modern astronomers have confirmed that Orion is a star and solar system creator of our Milky Way Galaxy which revolves around Sothis the brightest and heaviest binary star in all the Universe.
That this knowledge resided in the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) as
mere coincidence as contend conventional Egyptologists is out of the question and absurd!

EXHIBIT I_D-4-5: Archaeoastronomy of Giza Egypt Plateau Complex: Constellation Convergences at 10,500 BC. _ 5. Significance of Constellation Leo
5. Significance of Constellation Leo
(FROM HANCOCK AND BAUVEL, THE MESSAGE OF THE SPHINX BY, 1996, FIGURE 65, PG. 260)
• The Encyclopedia Britannica writes about the Constellation Leo:
” (Latin: Lion), in astronomy, zodiacal constellation lying between Cancer and Virgo, at about 10 hours 30 minutes right ascension (the coordinate of the celestial sphere analogous to longitude on the Earth) and 15° north declination (angular distance north of the celestial equator). Regulus (Alpha Leonis), the brightest star, is of the first magnitude. The November meteor shower called the Leonid has its radiant, or point of apparent origin, in Leo. In astrology, Leo is the fifth sign of the zodiac, considered as governing the period c. July 23–c. August 22. Its representation as a lion is usually linked with the Nemean lion slain by Heracles (Hercules).” Copyright © 1994-2002 Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc
• Esoterically, in 10,500 BC “Constellation Leo” had the Ancient Egypti/Kemit name
Heruakhti and was a part of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) astronomy system of 30 Decan Stars. “Leo” was not known as the 5 th Zodiac Sign of ”Constellation Leo” until the Ptolomy Period of Ancient Egypt/Kemit during which its astronomical 30 Decan Star System was simplified to the Greek Zodiac 12 Astrological Signs. The two systems can be seen juxtaposed in the Dendera Zodiac presented in EXHIBIT I_A-1.
• Esoterically, “Leo” symbolizes both the leopard and the lion. The Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) considered the leopard a sacred animal, trainable on leash. On the Queen Hatshepsut Punt Expedition the leopard is honored depicted being captured and exhibited live on leash in EXHIBIT IV_F-1, EXHIBIT IV_F-2 and EXHIBIT IV_F-5. When such a leopard died in captivity its skin was made into a Leopard Skin Smock worn by the deified
high priests. In contrast the lion is rarely shown in documents of Ancient Egypt/Kemit being considered relatively dangerous and un-trainable on leash and hunted and killed as in EXHIBIT I_K. Comparative zoology suggests the reason is that the male leopard is a solitary creature outside the mating season, hunting alone with great prowess; while the male lion rarely hunts living in prides with several females lions who do most of the hunting.
Spiritually when an Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) priest student and Aten Path aspirant conquered the ”leopard within” (the inner obstacles of fear and rambling mind guarding the “entrance into the inner land of Light of Heaven”) and communed with the Third Spiritual Plane Sun God Ra Heru Aakhuti he or she earned the right to wear the Leopard
Skin Smock and to be depicted as a Great Sphinx Rock (the Sphinx/HU). See EXHIBIT I_F-4, EXHIBIT II_C, EXHIBIT III_A-1, EXHIBIT III_H-1-2 and EXHIBIT III_I-1_2.
• The 10,500 BC archaeoastronomical convergence of Constellation Leo, Constellation Orion and Constellation Canis Major’s Binary Star Sirius is the “time signature” for the completion of the Giza Egypt Plateau Complex; commemorating the achievement of the
Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of Annu (On) bio-engineered Sustainable Agri-Forest along the United Nile River Valley and sustainable economic system centered in Ancient Egypt/Kemit Proper (the Nile River without cataracts) from submerged land claimed from the Mediterranean Sea Gulf.

1. Annu High Priest “Tera Neter” Tile: Esoterically circa 9,000 B.C. [from Flinders Petrie, Abydos II, plate I, “Abydos Temple” – Glazed Pottery M69]
Translation of Tiles Aboriginal Hieroglyph Inscription:
•Iine 1 Het-u: Temples
•line 2 Seth: “of the God Seth” (Tchuti\Thoth\Hermes)
•line 3 Net Annu-u: “of the Cities of the Anu People”s
•Iine 4 Tera Neter: Tera Neter (the devoted one to God) (as name\title)
•line 5 (Anu): (used as determinative for High Priest)
“The High Priest Tera Neter of the Temples of the God Seth (Thoth) of the Cities of the Anu Peoples”
EXHIBIT NOTES:
The “Tera Neter” Tile is Predynastic being found by “Father of British Egyptology” Flinders Petrie in ruins of a temple at Abydos underneath the Dynastic temple. The figure is on a green colored tile and seems to be used as a “votive offering” of worship at the temple. Right hand could be carrying a libation vessel. Compare with An(nu) priest of “Narmer’s Palette”, i.e., same “Anu” skull cap, lion cloth and stance shown in EXHIBIT I_F-3. The figure is a member of the Nine Bow Tribe #8, the Annu-Seth
presented in EXHIBIT IV-2 known today as the (A)Nubians. He is an Annu Priest of the
Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu).

EXHIBIT I_F-3: Annu King “Narmer’s Palette” - Obverse (Top) Side: Enlargement of Annu High Priest and Annu King Narmer
3. BLOWUP OF FAR LEFT UPPER LEVEL OF NARMER’S PALETTE’S OBVERSE SIDE
EXHIBIT NOTES:
• King Narmer is of the Anu Peoples with his kilt and Sun Goddess Het Heru cow
tail. He is an Annu King/Pharaoh. NOTE the similarity of his dress to that of the Lion Hunters in Exhibits I-K; the dress of King "Scorpion" in Exhibit I_J and the dress of the unknown King in Exhibit I_G.
• The King Narmer seems also to be wearing a leopard skin smock with a lion paw over his left shoulder indicating he is an alumni of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) and an adherent of its Aten Path as is also the unknown King in Exhibit I-G. Thus he too is an Annu King.
• Two types of Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) Priests are shown on Narmer’s Palette; i.e. the ritual libation water carrying Annu High Priest and the Thet Master Priest. Narmer’s Palette is conservatively dated at circa 2,925 BC. and more likely older than 4,250 BC. indicating that the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) is truly “ancient” having a much greater antiquity and Predynastic origin.
• The similarity of dress between the Annu Priest "Tera Neter" in Exhibit I_E-1_2 to the Annu High Priest standing behind the Pharaoh above is striking. It is concluded they both are Annu High Priests handling outer spiritual ritual duties as opposed to the Thet
Master Priest who handles the inner spiritual Aten Path responsibilities of the Ancient
Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu).

EXHIBIT I_F-4: “Narmer’s Palette”__ Obverse (Top) Side Enlargement of Thet Master Priest and Dreadlocked Rastafari
4. BLOWUP OF MIDDLE LEFT UPPER LEVEL OF NARMER’S PALETTE – OBVERSE SIDE
EXHIBIT NOTES:
• Note the man wearing a Annu High Priest’s leopard skin smock with dreadlocked hair is an Aboriginal Rastafarian. He is the second in stature (size) preceding King Narmer and thus second most prominant in the royal procession. The hieroglyphics in front of him transliterates into the word “Thet .“ The Thet according to E. Wallis Budge’s Egyptian Hieroglyphic Dictionary means he is one of the “learned men, the sages of the house of life, the learned men of the college attached to the temple (emphases added).”
• Esoterically the “college\houses of life” means the Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu). This man is a Thet High Priest of the Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu). As indicated by the “two cords ending in half circles” extending down from his left shoulder he is the Highest of its High Priests being the Spiritual Master of the Aten Path the Thet Master Priest. Compare
with EXHIBIT III_A-1 showing the Pharaoh Amenemhet III with the same “cords in half circle.”
• The Thet Master Priest initiated practitioners of the Aten Path of which the Annu (Priest) King was the leading deciple. Compare to EXHIBIT I_E-1_2 and Aten Path practitioners meditated on the Annu Khet [symbolized as the circular cross or Ankh or stream of cosmic creative life energy, known in other spirituality systems as the word\logos or shabd, naam or ”inner lighted sound” identical to the Surat Shabd Yoga of today] as the core of its “system of soul salvation” and communed with the hierarchal Sun Gods until they reached the Supreme Being, the Most High God, the Godhead Annu.
• The Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) was established by the Anu Peoples in the Predynastic Period of Ancient Egypt/Kemit. Annu King Narmer conventionally is identified as the first Pharaoh Mena of Dynastic Egypt. Esoterically he is Predynastic by two lines of kings, i.e. part of Manetho’s dynasty of the demigods the “Souls of Annu” or “Shemsu Heru”.

EXHIBIT I_G: Predynastic Unknown Annu King Assisted by School of On Rastafari Thet Master Priest in Aten Path Meditation at Pyramid Site __ Pottery Art
(from Plate XVIII of Petrie’s Abydos II, “Prehistoric White-lined Vases,” #74)
EXHIBIT NOTES:
• Refer to Chapter Six Scripture C Chapters 46a and 46b herein to understand the spiritual event depicted here, i.e., the “Manifestation of the Inner Light” which was founding Egyptology Father Jean Champllion title for the corrupted Book of the Dead of the Theban Sorcery Lodges.
• Comparing with Exhibit I_F-4 the dread locked hair of the left figure is undoubtedly the “Thet”
Master Priest of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) and the dress of the figure on the right with Third Plane Sun Goddess Het Heru cow’s tail and king crown identifies him as an Annu (Priest) King.
• The existence of pyramids in Predynastic Egypt circa 4,500 B.C. is esoterically supported here with the triangular figure not a mountain as conventional Egyptologists ascribe.
• The dread locked coiffered priest is helping the Annu (Priest) King leave the “body tomb” and soar “above the pyramid” in the spiritual realms. Thus esoterically this Predynastic Period pottery art depicts an aboriginal Rastafarian and Master/Thet Priest of the Aten Path “science of spirituality” of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery Spirituality School of On (Annu) who spiritually initiated the Annu (Priest) King.
• NOTE: The Rastararian Thet Master Priest is assisting the Annu (Priest) King who is practicing the Light and Sound Yoga or Aten Path meditation technique of plugging the ears with one’s fingers in order to hear the Inner Celesial Sound or the Word of what the Ancient Egyptiain Mystery School of On (Annu) expressed as the Annu Khet or Stream of Creative Life Energy. Later Sufi Muslim Sages will use this method of plugging the ears with one’s fingers. Compare with Exhibit I_I_3.
• NOTE: The Predynastic stylized “Tree of Life” is shown indicating this is indeed a spiritual experience of Yoga or “yoking back to” the Most High God ANNU as part of the Aten Path of the
Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu). Compare with the “Tree of Life” shown in Exhibit I_I-1_2, Exhibit II_B-1, Exhibit II_B-2_3, Exhibit II_B-4; Exhibit III_E; and Exhibit III_F-1_2.

EXHIBIT I_H: Paleolithic Rastafarian “Dreadlocked” Annu Priests with Leashed Giraffes __ Prehistoric Cave Drawings (circa 12,000 B.C.)
EXHIBIT NOTES:
• Paleolithic Dreadlocked Priests are shown in these cave drawings with rope tethered giraffes found in Neolithic Egyptian caves. The giraffe was held as sacred partly because of its practice of meditating on the sun at sun rise and sun set; as similar to the practice of meditating on the inner and outer sun of these aboriginal Rastafarian dreadlocked priests.
• In this Pre-Dynastic period of Ancient Egypt/Kemit the black African Anu Peoples were called “Troglodytes” by the admiring Greeks because of their spiritual practice of inhabiting caves for long periods of time. Esoterically, they were practicing the Path of the Aten or Light and Sound Yoga. Caves are natural amplifiers of the “Ceaseless Word”, Shabd (Sanskrit), Annu Khet” (Kemit); as abbreviated and symbolized by the circular cross the Ankh (Kemit). This “stream of cosmic energy” from the Most High God Annu is everywhere and makes up everything.
• Thousands of years later a Sufi Mystic initiated Prophet Muhammad in the sacred cave of Hira.
“ About the Prophet Mohammed it is said in Al-anwar of Maulana Sheikh Modh. Akram Sabri that at the age of 40 he began receiving messages from God, after he had for 15 years practiced communion with Awaz Mustpuim, Anhad Shabd or the Ceaseless Word, and had seen the glimpses of truth as flashes of heavenly Light for 7 years. At one time he remained for 2 years in the cave of Hira in meditation.”
“ It is further stated that the prophet practiced in the cave of Hira for 6 years, the Sultan-uI-Azkar, Surat Shabd Yoga and that Hazrat Abdul Qadir Jillani did the same for 12 years in that sacred cave.”
(from Kirpal Singh Ji’s Naam or Word. pg. 106, 141)
See Appendix I-D herein.
• Esoterically these aboriginal Rastafarian Dreadlocked Priests were the founders of ancient Egypt/Kemit’s theocracy. The simple and primitive caves of the aboriginal Rastafarian Dreadlocked Priests of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) and its
aboriginal spiritual practice of the Aten Path evolved into the Predynastic and Dynastic Period complex of pyramids and temples exemplified at the Giza Rock Plateau Complex. The simple and primitive caves became the secondary temples of initiation and spiritual practice for those in the far rural reaches of Ancient Egypt/Kemit and its Nine Bow Nations..

EXHIBIT I_I-1_2: Predynastic Aten Path Symbols and Practice Depictions_Pottery Art
1. Predynastic Pottery Art Reveals Aten Path Motif
(from Flinders, Petrie, Ibid, Gerzean Epoch- Red Decorations, Plate XXVII)
EXHIBIT NOTES:
• Esoterically, the inner sun or Aten Disc and other Aten Path symbols can be seen on these Predynastic “Gerzean” pottery samples. Specifically, the concentric cicle motiff is a predynastic depiction of the Solar Disc or Aten from whence comes the Annu Khet or stream of life energy. The pyramids mistakenly thought mountains by conventional Egyptologists represent the Sun Gods of the Spiritual Planes that emante from the Most High God ANNU..
• The lower right figures above show the third-eye, pituitary-pineal gland complex as
specifically stylized in this “Prehistoric” art motif; flanked by 2 “Tree of Life”. It is simplified in the Dynastic Period as the coiled cobra or silhouetted in the Aten Disc. Compare with similar symbology in Exhibit II A-1, Exhibit II_A-2, Exhibit II_B-1, Exhibit II_B-2_3 and Exhibit II_B-4.
2. Predynastic Aten Path Motif: “Third-Eye” Pineal and Pituitary Gland Complex
(isolated from Flinders, Petrie, Prehistoric Egypt, Plate XXVII)
EXHIBIT NOTES:
• Comparing this Predynastic Aten Path Motif with the Aten Path symbol of the Dynastic Period of Pharaoh Akhenaten shown in EXHIBITS III_F-1_2 and interpreted in its footnotes a and b; this Predynastic Aten Path symbol represents the same “science of spirituality” system concept but is several thousands of years older.

(from Flinders, Petrie, Ibid Gerzean Epoch- Red Decorations)
EXHIBIT NOTES:
• Two persons plugging their ears with their fingers meditating on the Annu Khet or Light and Sound Current in front of the third-eye, pituitary-pineal gland
complex are on the Aten Path the Spirituality System of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) as practiced in Predynastic times. The black African
Anu Peoples are clearly the Aten Path aboriginal practitioners, the legendary “Souls of Annu”; who ruled Egypt/Kemit (“land of the blacks”) in the Predynastic
Period. Hence the Troglodites were Anu Peoples who meditated in caves listening to the Annu Khet or Light and Sound Current. Compare to Exhibit I_G.
• The solar boats and totem animals in front of a roll of 13 pyramids indicates spiritual not physical landscape. Elephant and ostrich totems reflect the Predynastic
flora of the entire Nile River Valley habitat before its desertification. The boats are solar boats as seen later in Dynastic Period. The so-called 13 mountains are
esoterically pyramids which just happen to symbolize the 13 Gods of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu); i.e. the 8 Spiritual Planes of the Most
High God ANNU and its emanated 11 Solar Gods and Goddesseses (Ptah, Khepera, Atum, Sha-ra/Tefnut, Ra-Heru-Aakhuti/Het Heru, Thoth/Maat and
Asar/Ast) and the Physical Plane Sun God Ra identified in Appendix I-B.

EXHIBIT I_J: Annu King Scorpion’s (An-Hetch) Macehead: Garden of Eden/Sustainable Agri-Forestry Work with Pick Axe and Shovel
From Arnett’s Predynastic Origin of Egyptian Hieroglyphics, Plate L
EXHIBIT NOTES:
• The hieroglyphics before the “Scorpian King” transliterates as An-Hetch meaning “being of the power of light” __ implying he meditates on the Inner Celestial Light of the Aten Path.
• The Scorpian King is wearing the so-called “Upper Egypt” crown as King Narmer in EXHIBIT
I_D-3. Compare with the lion hunters shown in EXHIBIT I_K who wear short kilts and the cow’s tail of Sun Goddess Het Heru. This identifies the Scorpian King (An-Hetch) as a Annu (Priest) King of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu), and ethnically related to the Anu Peoples of the Nine Bow Nations represented in EXHIBIT IV-2.
• King An-Hetch is working in a Sustainable Agri-Forest based “Garden of Eden”; for below workers are planting trees, one has also a pick axe as does the King standing behind irrigation trenches. Planting “deep” beds can be seen behind the King in the “Garden of Eden”, full of sunflower plants.
• Militarily one can appreciate the importance of “food security” and Garden of Edens/Sustainable Agri-Forestry in Ancient Egypt/Kemit’s military superiority and long civilization preservation. Clearly the Anu peoples are as much horticulturists as they are military conquerors. Obviously, the Anu people can make war, but their first passion is horticultural as this gardening figure is found on a ceremonial war macehead.
• Since this is a military mace head weapon, conquered enemies are shown hung as totem animal symbol, as well as totem standards of the victorious Nine Bow Nations supporting the King; i.e., the Seth peoples of the Annu Sethiu (aNubians) and the Shasu Annu (Semites) or those Mentu who worship the God Min, the falcon and jackal or wolf bands shown in EXHIBIT IV-2.
• The sunflower being a complete and easily digestible raw food, is “phototrophic” (following the sun) the only plant of its kind was developed by the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) as a complete prime vegetarian food for its Aakhu-Hammemet\”Sun People” students, graduates and followers of the Aten Path.

• The double feathered arrows of Anu People as cited by French Egyptologist Abbe' E. Amelineau and head dress feather identify the lion hunters as of the Anu Peoples. Thus between
Predynastic Egypt and the 18th Dynasty, i.e., exoterically 2,000 years and esoterically more than 7,000 years, the Anu Peoples’ use of the bow and arrow remained.

ABOUT THE ROMAN CATHOILIC CHURCH SAINT AUGUSTINE
“ST AUGUSTINE A VEGETARIAN, TELLS US OF THE MANIFESTATION IN HIM OF THE LIGHT IN THIS WAY:
'I ENTERED EVEN INTO MY INWARD SELF. THOU BEING MY GUIDE AND ABLE AS I WAS: FOR THOU WERE BECOME MY HELPER. AND I ENTERED AND BEHELD WITH THE EYE OF MY SOUL SUCH AS IT WAS, ABOVE THE SAME EYE OF MY SOUL ABOVE MY MIND, THE LIGHT UNCHANGEABLE.’
‘NOT THIS ORDINARY LIGHT WHICH ALL FLESH MAY LOOK UPON, NOR AS IT WERE A GREATER OF THE SAME KIND, AS THOUGH THE BRIGHTNESS OF THIS SHOULD BE MANIFOLD BRIGHTER, AND WITH ITS GREATNESS TAKE UP ALL SPACE.’
‘NOT SUCH WAS THE LIGHT BUT OTHER, YEA, FAR OTHER FROM ALL THESE. HE THAT KNOWS THE TRUTH, KNOWS WHAT THAT LIGHT IS AND HE THAT KNOWS IT, KNOWS ETERNITY. ‘ ”

EXHIBIT II_A-1: The Annu Khet or Ankh (Circular Cross): The Creative Word, Inner Lighted Sound Stream, Shabd (Hindu) or Cosmic Energy
I. ANNU KHET or ANKH (Circular Cross): Stream of Cosmic Life Energy
(Tomb of Pashedu, 20th Dynasty 1186 B.C. - 1070 B.C. Tomb No. 3 at Deir el-Mednich, Thebes.)
EXHIBIT NOTES:
• From the Dictionary of Egyptian Symbology :
“A figure of Osiris seated before a desert mountain ridge dominates the end wall of the chamber in the tomb Pashedu. Pashedu kneels in adoration behind the god’s throne and above him is represented a wedjet-eye with hands that proffer two lighted tapers. Similar tapers in a vessel are held by a squatting geni in front of Osiris. A Horus-falcon looks on from the left Tomb of Pashedu, 20th Dynasty 1186 B.C. - 1070 B.C. Tomb No. 3 at Deir el-Mednich, Thebes.”
• The Exoteric conventional Egyptology texts explan that the “wedjet eye” is part of a “mountain” and not part of the “Inner Light Sound” stream of cosmic energy.
The Esoteric truth is that the “desert mountain” is the “Inner Lighted Sound” stream of celestial water (Annu Khet). Please note this indicates “primeval matter or water” literally
“nun” from the Most High God ANNU (8th plane). The “wedjet-eye” is the Third Eye of the spirituality system of the Light and Sound Yoga called the Aten Path in Ancient Egypt/Kemit.
(From National Geographic, Collector’s Edition Vol. 5, Treasures of Egypt, p. 117, /2003)
• Esoterically note that Osiris is confounded with First Spiritual Plane Sun God Asar (Aras); i.e. the god of the Dead and body resurrection is not the First Spiritual Plane Sun God
Asar. This is a vestige of the Theban Invader People and the Theban Sorcery Lodges Cult religion derived from the Scythian Peoples and their demonic cult worship of Lucifer and Ahriman. Please refer to Appendix I-B for Cosmomlogy.

(“The Magic Eye” Portion Enlarged of the Tomb of Pashedu Wall Mural, 20th Dynasty 1186 B.C. - 1070 B.C. Tomb No. 3 at Deir el-Mednich, Thebes.)
EXHIBIT NOTES:
• Esoterically, the hieroglyphic of the “third eye” or the eye of the 3 rd plane Sun God Ra-Heru-Aakhuti is giving the life energy of spiritual light from the Celestial Water Stream. The “Eye of Heru” used on Het-Heru the solar cow. See Exhibit II_B-4. This is
symbolized by the famous circular cross of Ankh or “stream of life energy” the Annu
Khet.
• Esoterically, the streams of red and black colored particles details the “primeval matter or cosmic water” and infers that the ancient Egyptians knew about the atomic theory of matter as George James in Stolen Legacy declares so succinctly. The School of On (Annu) was the source of the current theory that characteristically first appears
in Ancient Greece philosophy. It is not a coincidence that the 5 th Plane Sun God’s
name is in fact Atem/Atum/Atom.

EXHIBIT II_C : The Two Leopard Gods Guarding the Entrance to the Heavenly Land of Light (18th Dynasty)
(from Budge, The Egyptian Book of the Dead, Panvrus of Ani: Citadel’s ed)
EXHIBIT NOTES:
• The conventional exoteric interpretations:
1.) The Husband Ani and Wife Thuthu in the “Body Tomb” playing the “game of life” (drafts). The deceased Ani is enabled to leave and enter Amenta, the Underworld at
will and in whatever form he pleases. Clark describes this very important chapter of the Book of the Dead as one of the most popular religious texts in ancient Egypt. The
picture of Ani sitting in a hall playing drafts is a reflection of the title of the chapter in the Papyrus of Ani. The two birds are the souls of Ani and Thuthu, standing on a pylon.
Next to them is an alter with offerings and lotus flowers.
2.) The Ba’s astral bodies of couple rising above the “body tomb” facing the leopards of “physical difficulties.” The Bennu bird, or Heron of Annu/On/ Heliopolis, which was
symbolic rebirth, next to a fable of offerings. in the text the deceased identifies himself with this bird. 3.) Two leopards symbolic of Yesterday and Today, Osiris and Re. Between
them is the solar disk beneath the vault of the sky. The Leopard Gods mentioned in Chapter 64 a line 2 of the Book of the Dead personifies the concept of overcoming the
“leaving the body tomb” obstacles; and the Leopards guard the entrance into heavenly land of light, Aakhut.
• Esoterically, once the “Aten Path” or Light and Sound Yoga initiate rises above body consciousness and enters onto the first spiritual plane, conquering the guarding leopard guards
then achieve “self- knowledge” . . . the basis of the symbology of the leopard skin smocks worn by the higher priests that leads to the 12 Sun Gods and Goddesses including
the Most High God ANNU. The Anu Peoples’ co-archial/equal male and female culture is seen here as the mystic ideal of husband and wife as “one flesh and soul” on
the spiritual “Path of the Aten” together.

DYNASTIC GRAPHIC DOCUMENT HISTORY OF AND REFERENCES TO THE ATEN PATH OF THE EGYPTIAN MYSTERY “SCHOOL OF ON”
“Amenophis III was concerned with the status of the king, who in his imperial role ought to be an absolute ruler in control of civil, religious and military affairs. He may have considered that the temples and estates of the god Amun at Thebes had received enough of the riches of empire to pose a threat to the king in certain circumstances. To counter this he appointed to high posts officials who came from the Delta or Memphis in the north, men who were loyal to their king and less likely to manipulate the income of any temple for political gain.
He also began to promote the interests of a god who until his reign does not seem to have had a special priesthood or temples. That god was the Aten, the physical disk of the sun, which since the Middle Kingdom [ circa 2040 to 1782 BC., Dynasties 11 to 12)] had been a symbol of divinity linked with the king. During the Eighteenth Dynasty Aten had emerged as a god who couId be depicted as hawk-headed or as a winged sun disk with arms outstretched. The development of Aten as an aspect of the sun-god Re is significant for Re was the prominent deity of earlier times [Old Kingdom, Dynasty 5] when kings had enjoyed absolute power. Since then many deities had been attached to Re, including Amun as Amun-Re.
Amenophis III, therefore, sought to identify the Aten as a particular cult of the King, a process which had been under way in the reigns of his father [Thothmoses IV] and grandfather [Amenophis II], but which now became more positive with temples and a priesthood created for the god. To emphasize his own divinity further, Amenophis III was deified and statues of him were worshipped in various temples. At the temple of Soleb in Nubia a relief scene depicts him worshipping an image of himself (figure 5). Normally deification began when the king died and joined the gods. These measures were not directed against the cult of Amun or any other god but were part of a wider political struggle being waged by the crown.”

I. Cairo Museum Statue of Pharaoh Amenemhet III as "Master Pharaoh”
(From L.B. Terrace’s Treasures of Egyptian Art from Cairo Museum, pg. 87)
EXHIBIT NOTE:
• Although this statue of “King-Priest Master Pharaoh” Amenemhet Ill’s nose has been disfigured as the Sphinx statue, the Pharaoh is of black African Anu People ethnicity and
culture. A Het-Heru Priest on the Aten Path, Pharaoh Amenemhet Ill had built Lake Moeris outfitted with an island with twin pyramids and the Labyrinth which Herodotus describes.
• Compare the Master Pharaoh Amenemhet III’s statue above with the Thet Master
Priest of “Narmer’s Palette” in Exhibit I_F-4; who was a combined Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) “Thet” High Priest and Aten Path Master. NOTE they both wear dreadiocks with long side locks and leopard skin smocks (above, “head” on left shoulder and ‘paw” on the right), and they both wear the Aten Path aspirant priest accessory of the half circle on a cord. The latter is composed of the cord hieroglyph symbolizing “path” ending with the striated base half circle hieroglyph symbolizing the heavens or spiritual planes esoterically the “Aten Path.” Obviously they both were aboriginal Rastararians.
• However, the leopard head is without the “Third Eye” complete symbolism between the eyebrows but displays it on his forehead (disfigured) as ureaus snake. Note as Het-Heru
Priest the Menat Necklace, associated with Third Spiritual Plane Sun Goddess Het-Heru of the referring to Exhibit II_B-4.

EXHIBIT NOTE:
Note that in this black granite sculpture in the Cairo Museum instead of the usual royal head cloth, Amenemhet III is shown as a Sphinx/HU with the mane, ears and body ears of a lion. Clearly the Pharaoh was a student of the Ancient Egyptian
Mystery School of On (Annu) and adherent of its esoteric spirituality Aten Path. Compare this with Exhibit III_A-1 showing this Pharaoh wearing the Menant
Necklace apparel and accessories of a “Master Pharaoh” as Het-Heru Priest on
the Aten Path.

Column 5 4 3 2 1 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15
(Vestibule of Thebes Tomb 64) (from Joy Collier, The Heretic Pharaoh, pg. 45)
EXHIBIT NOTES:
• Joy Collier’s Heretic Pharaoh presents this wall painting from the tomb of Pharaoh Thutmose lV’s tutor “Hekreshu” as representing both Pharaoh Thutmose IV and his son and successor Pharaoh Amenhetep Ill, both in their youth with their respective tutors “Hekreshu” and “Hekerneheh.” Ms. Collier interprets this document as the youthful Thuthmoses IV being seated on the lap of his tutor “Hekreshu,” and his Father Pharaoh Amenhetep Ill as standing with the sidelock of youth standing in front of his tutor “Hekerneheh”
“Before him {Thuthmose IV seated on Master Shu-Ra’s lap} stands {the alleged} Amenhotep {llI’s} already half his father's {Thuthmose lV’s} size and aged (apparently) five or six. He wears the royal sidelock and holds in one hand a bouquet of flowers and in the other a sprig of green leaves. Suspended from his neck was once a pectoral with the praenomen of Thuthmose IV. .“ (Collier, Ibid., pg. 44). {bracketed clarification}
Note as presented below this conventional Egyptology interpretation by Collier and others is incorrect. It supports the theory Thuthmoses IV was too young to have been the father of Amenhetep II; since the former died at 25 and the latter succeeded him at not less than 12 or more than 16 years old.
• Esoterically, this wall painting represents a time lapse from right to left of “Aten Path” Master ShuRa and his “heir to the throne” Initiate Thothmose IV, indicated by his scepter and foot rest. Thus the beginning of the time lapse shows the adolescent Thuthmose IV with the sidelock of youthful initiation into the “Aten Path” standing in front of his standing “Aten Path” Master Shu-Ra.
Clearly both the seated and standing Kings are time-lapse representations of Thuthmose IV, for they both wear on their chests the praenomen of "Thuthmose":
“Hekreshu is shown seated with King Thuthmose IV upon his knee. The young prince looking about ten years of age . . . wears a pectoral inscribed with his praenomen.” (Collier, Ibid., pg. 44) (emphasis added)
Most importantly this wall painting’s correct hieroglyphic translation presented below, cIearly states that Thuthmose IV was the first-born son of Pharaoh Amenhetep II. By inference the Aten Path was very influential in both these Kings’ reigns, the Sphinx Stele of Thutmose IV describing his vision of the Sphinx\HU or Third Plane Sun God Ra-Heru-Aakhuti must be retranslated; for he was an Aten Path Initiate desiring to be a “Master Pharaoh” and his vision was not by chance. See Exhibit III_B-3_4.

3. “Master Pharaoh” Thuthmose IV as Renovator of “Sphinx\HU Giza Sculpture”
From Hancock and Bauvel, The Message of the Sphinx, fig 51
EXHIBIT NOTES:
• The Sphinx Stela of Pharaoh Thuthmose IV describes his vision of the Sphinx\HU, Third Spiritual Plane Sun God Ra-Heru-Aakhuti; which told him if he would clear the sand away from around ifs neck he although far removed would become heir to the throne.
4. “Sphinx\HU Stela of Master Pharaoh Thuthmose IV”
UPPER PORTION OF THE SPHINX STELA OF GIZAH OF PHARAOH THUTHMOSE IV (from RA Schwaller De Lubicz, Sacred Science: The King of Pharonic Theocracy, Fig.11, pg 97)
EXHIBIT NOTES:
• Exoterically “..... in line 9 of its inscription, the granite stela of Pharaoh Thuthmose IV, which stands between the paws of the Sphinx/HU and refers to the Sphinx itself as ‘Horem-Akhet-Kherpri-Re-Atum,’ and subsequently in line 13 as ‘Atum-Hor-em-Akhet’ { }.” (Hancock and Bauval, Ibid., pg. 161) • Esoterically Pharaoh Thuthmose IV is represented as deified being a Sphinx/HU and thus as an Aten Path initiate merged with the Third Plane Sun God Ra-Heru-Aakhuti. Note that the Sphinx/HU sits atop the Body Tomb and that the Winged Aten dominates the whole relief.

I. Aten Path Master Amenhotep, Son of Hapu : As a Young Master
From L.B. Terrace, Treasures of Egyptian Art from the Caro Museum, pgs. 118 and 119
EXHIBIT NOTES:
• This Cairo Museums, statue, shown as a young master: the inscription on base is translated conventionally (L.B. Terrace, Ibid, pg. 117 and 118) as follows:
“Repeating the titles and names of the owner. . . says: ‘0 ye Upper and Lower Egyptians and every eye that beholds the sun disk {a reference to the “Sun People” initiates of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) of which he is the Master Thet of the Aten Path} who came downstream and upstream to Thebes to supplicate to the Lord {Most High} of Gods: Come unto me, and I will report to Anum of Opet {Pharaoh Amenhotep III} what ye have to say. And make the offering ritual and libations for me with what is with you. For I, by the King’s grace am an intercessor who will give the supplicant a hearing and will advance the affairs of the two hands!” (explanations in brackets by Aakhun George Singleton)
• His reputation as a governmental advisor; a high priest and Aten Path Master led after his death to his being made a god as his much earlier model lmhotep of the 3rd Dynasty. He was the 8th Spiritual Plane “Aten Path” Master Thet to Pharaoh Amenhetep III and Pharaoh Akhunaten/Ikhnaten. See Exhibit III_G-1.

II. Aten Path Master Amenhotep, Son of Hapu: As an Elder Master
From LB. Terrace's Treasures of Egyptian Art from the Cairo Museum, pgs. 118 and 119
EXHIBIT NOTES:
• As an 80 year old master “Amenhotep, Son of Hapu” is shown with the characteristic enlarged area between eyebrows of a Master Thet of the Science of Spirituality. The enlarged third eye area between the eyebrows, which is esoterically a sign of an Aten Path Master via enlarging the veins and arteries in this area at will.
• The chest insignia in cartouche translates “Neb em Annu Khet Ra” and translates “Master of the “Light and Sound” Stream of the Sun God Ra {generically including the 12 Sun Gods and Goddesses of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (ANNU)}.” As
“Annu Khet Master” he is clearly the Master Thet of the Science of Spirituality called the Aten Path of “those who aspired and who could see the Aten”, i.e. the “Sun People.” Refer to POEM #7C. As Aakhu-Hammemet (Sun Person) “Amenhotep, Son of Hapu” means “at peace in Amen as a son of the spiritual light and sound stream.”
• Conventionally transliterated Neb em Maat Ra translates “Master of the Sun Goddess Maat.” The meaning is the same for Maat, as this is a personification of the light and sound stream or Annu Khet/Ankh which purifies one righteous via its meditation. See Exhibit III_A-1 and Exhibit III A-2-3.

1. Monument I : Pharaoh Amenhetep III, Attended by Sun Goddess Tef Nut
(from Christian Deo-Noble Court’s Tutankhamen, pg.117; source unidentified)
• In monument “I” Queen Mother Mutemuaa is dressed as the Fourth Spiritual Plane Sun Goddess Tef Nut. This implies that Pharaoh Amenhotep III reached the
Fourth Spiritual Plane already qualified as a Sphinx/HU and now as Master Pharaoh. Compare representation of Tef Nut in.Exhibit II_B-2_3.
2. Monument II: Pharaoh Amenhetep lII, Attended by the Sun Goddess Maat
(from Cyril Aldred's Akhenaten, pg. 122; from South Vizier Ramoses Tomb #55 at Qurna)
• Queen Tiy is dressed as the Sun Goddess Maat (Neb Het). Compare with representation of Sun Goddess Maat in.EXHIBIT III_G_1. The spelling of “Pharaoh Amenhetep IV” the
original name of Pharaoh Akhenaten did not include the hieroglyph Uast the city of Thebes. Instead it included the hieroglyph for the city of Annu of the South (On, Heliopolis) site of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu).
• Pharaoh Amenhetep Ill spelled his name with the Uast hieroglyph, which appears in the
spellings of “Amenhetep III” in both Monuments “I” and “II” above. Thebes was the capital of Egypt/Kemit since the emergence of the Theban Sorcery Lodges and its Priesthood in
the 18 th Dynasty. Since the Theban Invader People finally settled in Ancient Egypt/Kemit at the end of the Predynastic Period, the city of Thebes became the headquarters of the Theban Sorcery Lodges’ Amen and Osiris cult priesthood and priestesshood.
• Above in Monument “II” the Aten literally “Annu Kenten Aten” is depicted as the “daughter dwelling within spiritual heavens and chief of the Goddesses” thus causing the celestial waters of Annu Khet personified as the Nile River God Heh “ to be given for all time.” This is discussed in detail in Appendix V, Section A 5.

3. Pharaoh Amenophis\Amenhotep III, attended by Queen Tiy\Tya, enthroned beneath the Triple Canopy of His Palace (Monument III)
(from Stele of the Lady Tuth Shena)
EXHIBIT NOTES:
• The above document is from the Stele of Lady Tuth Shena, the same Lady Tuth Shena of EXHIBIT III-E, who was a Aten Path practitioner of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) who had achieved deified status called a Sun Person.
• Esoterically the comparison of the previous three monuments, results in the conclusion that they are all the Pharaoh Amenhetep Ill in the beginning of his reign and just after his marriage to Queen Tiy. His Queen Mother being shown in Monument "I" identifies it as earlier in his reign than Monument “II” shows. Queen Tiy is shown in Monument "llI” which makes it the older of three. Conventionally Monument “II” is ascribed to Pharaoh Amenhetep IV\Akhenaten, for the Aten Disk is shown above his head.
Note: Monument “Il”s” cartouche bearing the name “Amenhetep” is in fact the praenomen identifying it as of Amenhetep IV. It is “suspiciously” defaced. Although the “Horus” names of the Pharaohs on these two monuments show them as the same, they have been altered. The motivation is to coverup the “Aten Path” practices of Amenhetep IlI.
4. Pharaoh Amenophis\Amenhotep III in War Chariot Sustained by Winged Aten
Limestone Stela (From Petrie, Six Temples at Thebes, 1897, plate X)
• War Chariot of the Pharaoh Amenhotep III shows him victorious against Asian and African
adversaries being sustained by the Annu Khet of the Winged Aten, implying the Pharaoh
Amenhotep III is an Aten Path initiate and Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu)
trained.

EXHIBIT III_D-5: Pharaoh Amenhotep Ill and Queen Tiy Revere the “Aten Path” (18th Dynasty)
(from C. Aldred’s Akhenaten, plate 80; found in house of Pinhasy at Amarna, British Museum #57399)
EXHIBIT NOTES:
• This scrapped off figure Limestone Sele with prenomen and nomen (name) cartouches
have been conventionally ascribed to Pharaoh Akhenaten, based on the misassumption
that the use of the “late form of the Aten cartouches” occurred after the death of
Amenhetep Ill. Esoterically, this scrapped figure is Amenhetep III. Queen Tiy is defaced
above. This can be seen faintly in a defaced praenomen Neb-Maat-Ra associated only with
Pharaoh Amenhotep III and not with his son Amenhotep IV.
• shown above has Pharaoh Amenhotep Ill and Queen Tiy (defaced), practicing the Aten
Path seated before an offering stand or Tree of Life with the Aten offering Annu Khet
them. Queen Tiy is defaced probably because of her foreign Mitanni parentage. Compare
with Exhibit III_F-1_2.
• Pharaoh Amenhotep Ill’s prenomen Neb-Maat-Ra is used instead of “Amenhetep” and
esoterically means he was a "Master Pharaoh" initiated by Master/Thet of the Aten Path
Amenhetep, Son of Hapu. Queen Tiy is given the analogous name to her husband’s
Pharaoh’s prenomen, Neb-Shu-Ra. Since “Shu-Ra” is the Fourth Spiritual Plane Sun
God this implies Queen Tiy reached this spiritual plane and this far and thus she too was a
Sphinx/HU. See Exhibit III_C-1 and Exhibit III_C-2.
• Obviously Pharaoh Amenhotep Ill and Queen Tiy were avid “Aten Path” practitioners.
Clearly Pharaoh Amenhetep Ill was also both a “Annu Master Pharaoh” trained by the
Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) and a practitioner of the Aten Path.

EXHIBIT NOTES:
• Esoterically in this painted figure from the Stele of Lady Tuth Shena, the Lady Thuth Shena is an Aten Path Initiated “child of the inner sun”; i.e. student of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On Annu).
• Esoterically her name “Tuth Shena” is the transliteration for Tchuti Shena or “the traveler on the path of Thoth”, the aboriginal founder of the School of ON (Annu).
• Esoterically here she is shown meditating on the Third Spiritual Plane before the Tree of Life. She is in communion with the Sun God Ra-Heru-Aakhuti viewing his Aten (inner sun), and as receiving his heavenly food of flower blossoms, which symbolize the inner lighted sound stream of Annu-Khet, the creative Word.
Thus Tuth Shena is an Annu High Priestess and “Sun Person” (Aakut- Hammemet). Additionally she is predictably Amenses as most such High Priestesses having no need for and thus not wearing underwear being free of menstruation and leucorrhoea.
• See EXHIBIT III_D-3_4 where Monument III of “Pharaoh Amenophis\Amenhotep III, attended by Queen Tiy\Tya is also from this Stele of Lady Tuth Shena.

EXHIBIT III_F-1_2b: Depiction of Aten 7/Atannu Path - Meryra’s Tomb Plate XXII
FOOT NOTES: (continued)
a. The “Cult of Ra” during the Fifth Dynasty combined with the foreign Amen-Osiris Cults and so formed the Amen-Ra\Osiris triumvirate; which confused Ra generically with the 12 spiritual suns or SunGods\Goddesses, a degeneration and corruption of the ‘Aten Path practice of spirituality. Esoterically Ra denotes the 12 Sun-Gods\Goddesses of the “Aten Path back to the 8th plane GODHEAD Annu. Since “Yoga” means to yoke or return back to the GODHEAD, the ‘Aten Path” is a Yoga, the most effective and efficient, the original Light and Sound Yoga.
The term Shen Aten 7 was used for this Aten Path practice.
b. An actual graphic representation of the ‘Path of the Aten 7\Atannu” is presented uniquely in the Tomb of Aten High Priest Meryra as a composite ideographic hieroglyph of the most profound cosmogonic\cosmographic and spiritual symbology, It is shown in the upper right hand corner of Exhibit III_F-1_2.
It is composed of the monad expression Annu-Khet-Aakhut en Aten as rays of life energy, the “inner lighted sound current” ( creative word, Shabd) being given ( hand of God) from the GODHEAD ANNU on the 8 th plane called Annu. From the Most High God Annu are emanated seven (7) hierarchal Atens or inner suns of the 7 Sun-Gods of the 7 spiritual planes and 5 Sun Goddesses below the 8 th plane represented by the rainbow clusters around the Aten Inner Sun Disk.
The Annu-Khet life energy gives life to the Pharaoh and Queen and provides food and animates all of creation. The “third eye” entrance to the “Path" is symbolized as the Cobra snake outlined within the Aten, the uraeus or Cobra snake front and side views respectively.
Thus 7 Sun-Gods and 4 Sun-Goddesses make up the 12 esoteric Deities of Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu), established about 17,000 B.C., according to Greek Historian Herdotus, Book II, p. 43) along with the 8th plane GODHEAD ANNU.

EXHIBIT III_G-1: Aten Path Master Pharaoh Akhenaten: as “Sphinx”\HU (Third Plane Sun God)\Ra-Heru-Aakhuti
Pharaoh Akhenaten (Amenhetep IV) as a Sphinx making Maat offering to the Aten. [18th Dynasty c. 1370 B.C.]
(from W. Budge, Tutankhamen: Amenism, Atenism and Egyptian Monotheism, Plate IX)
EXHIBIT NOTES:
• The “Sphinx” is the Greek name of the being the Egyptians name “HU”, the name used by the Egyptians and Sufi Muslims for those who meditate/commune by following the Annu Khet of the “inner lighted stream” with the Third Spiritual Plane Sun God Ra-Heru
Aakhuti esoterically depicted as the HU\Sphinx. See Poem #7C and Exhibit I-C-1.
• Thus esoterically the above monument of Pharaoh Akhenaten as the Sphinx or HU,
means he has merged with the Third Spiritual Plane Sun God Ra-Heru-Aakhuti; and as an “Aten Path" Master meditates on the “inner lighted sound.” He is a “Master of the Light and Sound Stream” of the Sun Gods, of which he is shown meditating on and holding in the palm of his hand as Master.
• The hieroglyphics rendered Neb em Annu Khet Ra or Neb em Maat Aten is on the chest of the previous “Aten Path” Master Amenhotep, Son of Hapu. See Exhibit III_C-2. It was also the premomen Pharaoh Akhenaten’s father Pharaoh Amenhetep Ill; who was also represented as the HU/Sphinx. See also Exhibit III_C-1.
• Thus Pharaoh Akhenaten was also a “Master” of the esoteric spiritual practice of the “Aten Path”. Such “Sun People” or “children of the light” or Aakhu Hammamet were trained by the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu). Those who achieved the Third Spiritual Plane are represented as the HU\Sphinx. This is the esoteric etiology of the word “HU-man”; i.e. a “human” was a “homo sapien” person who had achieved deification while alive on the earth plane.

THE EGYPTIAN MYSTERY “SCHOOL OF ON”
EXHIBIT III_G-1b: Aten Path Master Pharaoh Akhenaten: As “Sphinx”\HU\Ra-Heru-Aakhuti
• Clearly Pharaoh Amenhetep Ill was a practitioner of the Aten Path who achieved “Annu Master Pharaoh” trained by the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu).
• Thus Exhibit III B-1 and Exhibit B-2 present the proper interpretation and translation that indicates that Pharaoh Amenhetep Ill’s father Pharaoh Thuthmoses IV was a “Annu Pharaoh” who had been trained by Aten Path Master Thet Hekreshu (Shu-Ra). According to Sphinx Stele of Pharaoh Thuthmose IV shown in Exhibit III_B-3_4 Pharaoh Thothmoses IV too meditated/communed with and became one with the
Sphinx\HU\Sun God Ra-Heru-Aakhuti also being an Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) alumni.
As presented in Exhibit III_C-1 and Exhibit III_C-2 and Appendix V herein, Aten Path Master Amenhotep, Son of Hepu trained Pharaoh Akhenaten and by inference served this role for Akhenaten’s father Pharaoh Amenhetep III. See also Exhibit III_D-1_2, Exhibit III_D-3_4 and Exhibit III_D-5.
• Pharaoh Thothmoses IV’s father was Pharaoh Amenhetep II. Thus one can deduce he too was a practitioner of the Aten Path, if not a “Master Pharaoh” himself.
• Cyril Aldred’s book Akhenaten indicates houses of a “cult of dead ancestors” dedicated to Pharaoh Thuthmose I (father of “Aten Path Master-Queen Pharaoh” Hatshepsut), Pharaoh Amenhotep II, Pharaoh Thuthmoses IV and Amenhotep III existed in Pharaoh Akhenaten’s city Akhetaten (Amarna). Esoterically they were all minimally 3rd plane “Master Pharaohs” having merged and communed with the Third Spiritual Plane Sun God Ra-Heru-Aakhuti symbolized as the Sphinx/HU.
• Pharaoh Akhenaten changed his name from “Amenhetep IV.” Akhenaton is spelled “Ikhnaton” and “Akhunaten” , but more correctly it should be spelled “Aakhunaten.” Aakhunaten was a “Master Pharaoh’ who reached at least the 4 th Spiritual Plane and thus is depicted as a Sphinx/HU as shown in the previous Exhibit III_G-1.

• This document ranks with the most important of the Path of the Aten, the previously and normally esoterically taught spirituality system as part of the training to qualifying students of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery “School of On (Annu).” Since the recent discovery of the existence of Pharaoh Akhenaton and Nefertiti in 1901 by Egyptologists, history now attributes to them the development of the first “monotheistic social religion.” For this their names were removed from the Kings Lists and off monuments by their arch-rivals the Theban Sorcery Lodges and their Priests of Amen-Ra and Osiris-Isis Cults.
In more historical accurateness the 18 th Dynasty “School of On (Annu)” graduates
Pharaoh Akhenaten and Queen Neferrtiti did not invent the Aten Path. What they did as first pointed out by comparative religion scholar and Light and Sound
(Surat Shabd) Yoga Master Sant Kirpal Singh Ji in his comparative religion classic
Naam or Word, page 38 was to publically promulgate, organize and practice in public as a social religion the world’s aboriginal and previously esoteric spirituality system generically in comparative religion and spirituality called the “Light and Sound Yoga.” As shown in this book repeatedly and holistically the Aten Path spirituality system was esoterically practiced in Predynastic and Dynastic Egypt/Kemit thousands of years before the 18 th Dynasty reign of Pharaoh Akhenaton and Nefertiti.
• This document embodies the essence of spiritual art of the “Amarna Period” at the brief new capital city of Akhetaten (Amarna); and represents the highest form of art exposing the onlooker to the highest values of spiritual knowledge, and spiritual accomplishment in the ultimate human social experience of a “sustainable life science” based on the General Systems Theory reflected by truly loving family.
Pharaoh Akhenaten and Queen Nefertiti on the royal throne with their three daughters are shown in meditation/communion with the Continuous Cosmogonic Event of the
“stream of creative cosmic life energy” or Annu Khet streaming from the Aten Solar Disc as radiating hand Hieroglyphs of the always giving and sustaining Most High God ANNU. This is the aboriginal atomic theory as discerned by George James in Stolen Legacy named after the Fifth Spiritual Plane Sun God Atum. See Exhibit III_E, Exhibit III_F-1_2, Exhibit III_F-3_4 and Appendix I-B.

EXHIBIT III_G-3: Garden Party of Egyptian Mystery School of On Priestesses During the “Amarna Period” Reign of Aten Path Master Pharaoh Akhenaton and Queen Nefertiti, Dynasty 18, circa 1350 BC.
THE EGYPTIAN MYSTERY “SCHOOL OF ON”, VOL. 1
(from W.M. Flanders Petrie, Social Life in Ancient Egypt, pg. 176 copied from Tomb Painting of Nefer-hetep, Thebes, c. 1350 B.C.)
EXHIBIT NOTES:
• Esoterically, there are shown 7 “Sun People” women who are Annu Priestesses on the “Aten Path” of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) as indicated by their carrying “sistrums” in the shape of Third Spiritual Plane Sun Goddess Het Heru reflecting her personification of Annu Khet to make a noise resembling the “Life Energy Creative Word’s” sound, i.e., analogous to the tinkling of bells, one of the Annu Khet’s highest sound manifestations. They are accompanied by a Priest and 2 children.
• All food indicates they are indeed vegetarian/vegan with no animal flesh or organ meat in view, and plenty of vegetables, grains, fruit and fruit juices -- they are Amenses as one would expect of Egyptian priestesses -- they wear no underwear being without menstruation and leucorrhoea. See Poem #5, footnote e.
• The garden-orchard indicates deep beds were used to plant trees and grapevines which is part of the Garden of Eden/Sustainable Agri-Forestry technology of the School of On.
• The accompanying Priest is an Annu Priest. The 4 other women shown dressed in two tired dresses are not Amenses and are servants in attendance and serving food.
• Esoterically Henemit was used for such Amenses priestesses of vegetarian diet and high spiritual attainment on the “Aten Path” deified women, “Earth Goddesses.”
• “. . . , the sistrum, a kind of rattle that was sacred to Hathor (Het Heru).”
“Sistra was made of metal or faieve and formed in the shape of a Hathor {Het Hetu} head or Bat symbol, with horns bent round to form a loop. Three metal rods were threaded through holes and passed across the loop from one side to the other. The rods were either threshed with metal beads or left loose in their sockets so that when the sistrum was shaken they rattled .“ (Watterson, The Gods of Ancient Egypt, pg. 127)

THE EGYPTIAN MYSTERY “SCHOOL OF ON”
`EXHIBIT III_H-1_2 : The Book of the Dead, Papyrus of Ani: _ 1. “Opening of the Passageway” (“Third Eye”) Initiation & 2. Aten Path Reference
1. Kher-Heb Priest “Opening of the Mouth” of Initiate with the Urhekau Instrument
(from E Wallis Budge’s Book of the Dead, Ani Papyrus, Plate 15 Vignette, Citadel Ed.)
EXHIBIT NOTES:
• “Opening the mouth of the deceased” Ani implores Thoth, who is ..... the supreme magician, to remove the bandages which cover his mouth. This is an important and ancient funeral ceremony considered vital to the dead person’s chances of eternal happiness. Here we see a priest holding up the ur-hekau, ram headed snake-like instrument, about to touch the lips of the decreased. The text of which follows at this point in the Papyrus if Ani, has no vignette: in it the decreased asks to be given the magic formulas which will enable him to do as he wishes in the Underworld.
• Esoterically though corrupted by the Amon-Osiris cults as body resurrection rite. This
ceremony originally was the “opening of the third eye passageway”, where the ur-hekau instrument itself symbolizes the third eye (the cobra\uraeus snake) and the “passageway" from it to the “Rasta\Astral plane” above the “body tomb”.
• Aboriginally performed by the Master/Thet or other authorized Annu High Priest who on the “Path of Atannu” had earned the right to wear the leopard skin smock on a living Initiate, not on a mummy or stature of a dead person. Consequently, the “opening of the mouth” under the Thebans Sorcery Lodges was degenerated into a “spiritualism” rite of powering a dead person to talk to “mediums" on the earth plane, a far cry from its original initiation into the “Aten Path’t science of spirituality. Animal sacrifices went along with this Theban Sorcery Lodge Priesthood degeneration. This lead to Akhenaten making the Aten Path a social religion..
2. Budge’s The Book of the Dead, Papyrus of Ani “Aten Path” Meditation Description
(23) “I have merged with the (24) blissful Light of the Inner Sun-God Asar, first plane sun-god a of the blissful spiritual planes which originate from (25) Annu the 8th plane of the Godhead.” I partake of the gifts of the 7 inner sun lights (literally Ra Heru VII) of the blissful spiritual planes (which originates) from (25) ANNU (the 8th plane of the Godhead).
source hieroglyphics: E. Wallis Budge’s, The Book of the Dead, Papyrus of Ani, Dover ed, pg. 22, 1967; numbers in parenthesis are line numbers _______________________________________________________ FOOT NOTE:
a. Here Ra-Heru VII is used as synonym for “Aten 7\Atannu Path” a solar light for each of the 7 spiritual planes
to the 8th plane of the Most High God Annu. This spelling of “inner sun light” is the same as used in the title of the Annu sacred scripture “Manifestation of the Light,” leaving no grounds for its conventional translation as “day” in the erroneous title “Coming Forth by Day.”

EXHIBIT III_I-1_2: Pharaoh Tutankhamen Gold Leopard-Head (18 TH Dynasty) and Pharaoh Seti I as Atan Path High Priest (19 TH Dynasty)
1. Pharaoh Tutankhamen Leopard-Head from March 1977 National Geographic, pg. 306)
“The leopard-head ornament on his chest (of Pharaoh Seti I, below) resembles the golden one from the tomb of King Tutankhamen (right).”
EXHIBIT NOTES:
• Detail of “Third Eye” Aten inner sun held by Master of Transformation Khepera.
• The “third eye” or “single eye” (sukhmani) of Aten (inner sun) between eyebrows which are representing also the right and left Pingala and Ida Nadi (channels\passageways) - symbolized as “horns’ with Het-Heru cow. See Exhibit II_B-4.
2. Pharaoh Seti Wall Relief from March 1977 National Geographic, pg. 306)
“My Leopard skin is on my arm”
“Thus a Pharaoh assumed the role as High Priest. Here (below) a deity wears the priestly leopard mantle in the tomb of King Seti I at the Thebes.”
EXHIBIT NOTES:
• Above 19 th Dynasty Pharaoh Seti I wears a Leopard Skin Smock and the side lock of “young Heru” (Hipocrates) which is esoteric for initiated young student
practitioner of the Aten Path inner spirituality of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery
School of On (Annu).
Refer to Exhibit II_C for the significance of the Leopard Skin Smock.
• The Theban “Sorcery” Lodge that dominated Egypt in the 19 th Dynasty after
Pharaoh Akhenaten’s reign had not completely suppressed the Ancient
Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) and its Aten Path by the 19 th Dynasty
as clearly Pharoah Seti I was an Annu Pharaoh.
• The leopard head in relief is part of an ANNU High Priest dress, “third eye” symbolized by pentagram which is an esoteric geometric and numerologic symbol
of the “deification of man to HU-man” who has learned to escape the “body
tomb” and travel the Aten Path.
• Ironically Pharaoh Seti I conquered Akhenaten\Moses’ Israel. Esoterically,
Israel became an ally of Ancient Egypt/Kemit under Pharaoh Seti I.

EXHIBIT III_J-1: Aten Path High Priestess & Queen Ankhnesneferibra Sarcophagus (32 ND Dynasty)
1. Egyptian High Priestess and Queen Ankhnesneferibra Sarcophagus Lid
(from M. Bierbier, The Tomb Builders and the Pharaohs, fig. 85)
EXHIBIT NOTES:
• “Figure 85 is the sarcophagus lid of Egyptian Queen Ankhnesneferibre. She was the daughter of Pharaoh Psamtik II and wife of Pharaoh Ahmes II. She became High Priestess of Amun at Thebes in 584 B.C. in succession to her great-aunt, who had adopted her in 595 B.C. The last historical record of her is in 525 B.C., the year of the Persian conquest of Egypt whereupon Pharaoh Ahmes II was killed. It is not known if she was ever laid to rest in her splendid sarcophagus.”
(from M. Bierbier, The Tomb Builders and the Pharaohs, fig. 85)
• Esoterically, the last High Priestess-Queen before the Persian Conquest is a product of the much weakened but still operational Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) wearing a Winged Aten Head Dress. She is also shown wearing the headdress crown associated with the Fourth Spiritual Plane Sun-Goddess Tefnut implying she had reached that spiritual plane and thus a Sphinx/HU. Her adherence to the "Aten Path” is further gleaned from the hieroglyphics on her Sarcophagus translated in Exhibit III_J-2.
• Consistent with her Aten Path High Priestess status as graduate of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) she is Amenses wearing no underwear being free of menstruation and leucorrhoea and would be nutritionally a vegan/vegetarian.

_____________________________________________________________________ FOOTNOTES:
a. Literally “Heru Neter” the generic term for Sun-God.
b. Citation to this reference to the “Aten 7\Atannu’ was found in E. Wallis Budges Hieroglyphic Dictionary, Vol. I, p. 98 column b as follows:
“Aten 7 - the seven disks of the Sun-God, British Museum No. 32, 1. 253.”
“B.M. No. 32, 1. 253” was not deciphered in the dictionary as to the source hieroglyph location. But after extensive research the “Sarcophagus of Queen Ankhnesberferabra” was found to be British Museum Item #32, published text of the hieroglyphs in a book by Budge cited above denoting “line 253” therein containing the Aten 7~Atannu term.
Esoterically the Aten 7\Atannu is the “Path and Orbit of the 7 Atens, the 7 internal sun disks of the 7 Sun-Gods.” One Sun-God and his Aten inner sun manifestation exists on each of the 7 spiritual planes between the physical plane and the 8 th plane of the GODHEAD ANNU. On the 4 lowest planes, 4 SunGoddesses Ast (first spiritual plane), Maat-Neb-Het (second spiritual plane), Het-Heru (third spiritual plane) and Tef-Nut (fourth spiritual plane); and personify the Annu-Khet or inner lighted sound stream of the creative word,. See Appendix I-B for detail on cosmography. See Exhibit II_B-1 and Exhibit II_B-2 for depictions of the 4 Sun-Goddesses.
c. Heru Neb literally.

EXHIBIT IV_A :: 18 th Dynasty Queen Hatshepsut’s Expedition to Punt, Sheba and Khenthunnefer : Chicago Field Museum1928 Anthropological Analysis
Barthold Laufer’s The Giraffe in History and Art, Depart. of Anthropology Field of Museum of Natural History, Chicago, IL., 1928 Leaflet #27
EXHIBIT NOTES:
“... Punt, as the Egyptians called the Somali coast at the south end of the Red Sea, and along the south side of the Gulf of Aden. From that region, which, like the whole east, he termed the Gods Land, he obtained the fragrant gums and resins so much desired for incense and ointments.”
“One of the most important events of the reign of Queen Hatshepsut (eighteenth dynasty, about 1501-1480 B.C.) was a naval expedition to the land of Punt with the object to establish commercial relations with peoples of what is now the Somali coast. A sculptured record of this peaceful expedition is preserved on the southern half of the wall stretching behind the middle colonnade of her temple at Der el-Bahri situated on the west side of the river at Thebes. In this procession the giraffe is well represented, unfortunately mutilated; but even without its head it is a magnificent work of art, body and legs being exceedingly well modeled.”
“According to EG. Naville (The Temple of Deir El Bahari, pg. 21; Egypt Exploration Fund, XII, 1894), the giraffe is said to come from the country Khenthennofer, not from the coast. This region is generally distinguished from Punt; the two countries, however, were contagious, but of somewhat wide and indefinite extent, Punt possessing a coast where vessels could land, while Khenthennefer was located in the mountainous interior. The two countries had a mixed population which included Negroes, and their products were almost identical. Ivory, live panthers, panther-skins, monkeys, gold, ebony, and antimony were common to both. All these products being typically African, it is evident that Queen Hatshepsut's expedition had been directed to the east coast of Africa. Wealthy Egyptians were fond of keeping live specimens of the fauna of Punt like dogs, monkeys, panthers, leopards, and giraffes.”
Above excerpts taken from Barthold Laufer’s The Giraffe in History and Art, Department of Anthropology Field of Museum of Natural History, Chicago, IL., 1928 Leaflet #27, pgs. 20 & 21 with emphasis added.
Conventional Egyptology dates Pharaoh-Queen Hatshepsut’s 18 th Dynasty reign as from 14721458 BC. Documentation of this male giraffe from Queen Hatshepsut’s Temple at Der el Bahari presented in EXHIBIT IV_F-1. Zoological Analysis that is the careful study of animals in the relief and its hieroglyphic text is key to identifying the location of Ta Neter or ”Land of the Gods”. Esoterically “Punt” is the modern coastal country of Eritrea; “Sheba” is the modern country of Ethiopia (Abysinnia); and “Kent Hun Nefer” or Anuit is the Equatorial Nile River Great Lakes of Africa’s interior and surrounding lands. Though this analysis in 1928 is surprisingly accurate, it fails to recognize Sheba or Meroe as part of the geography of Ancient Egypt/Kemit’s legendary Ta Neter, the “Land of the Gods.”

EXHIBIT IV_B :: 18 th Dynasty Queen Hatshepsut’s Expedition to Punt, Sheba, Meroe and Khenthunnefer: 5 Ships Arrive in Punt Harbor
II. Five (5) Ships of Queen Hatshepsut Naval Expedition Arrive in Red Sea Harbor of Punt
(from Mariette, Auguste, Deir-elBahari, Leipzig 1877)
EXHIBIT NOTES:
• That the 5 boats of Queen Hatshepsut’s naval expedition are in Punt is indicated by the Hierglyphics of the left text, first column and that this is a Red Sea
harbor is identified by the salt water marine animals specifically the squid and lobster. The arrival is peaceful and met by a smaller Puntian boat far left and
thus expected being probably the first visit from Egypt/Kemit since the Hyksos conquered Lower Egypt/Kemit during the 16 th And 17 th Dynasties.
Refer to Map 2 for the location of ancient Punt as modern day Eritrea on the Red Sea, and Map 7 for detail of the Eritrea area with the Nile River Valley.

(from Smith, William Stevenson; “The Land of Punt”, Journal of the American Research Center in Egypt, Bk. 1, Boston, MA., 1962)
EXHIBIT NOTES:
• The body of water is an ocean and undoubtedly the Red Sea with salt water animals identified including a shark, sword fish and sea turtle.
• The grossly obese Queen of Punt is detailed and discussed in EXHIBIT IV_C-3. Note that her daughter standing behind her is not obese as of yet.
• The people of Punt live in huts on poles for beach front flood water protection, the same huts on poles used today in the Sudan Nile River Valley as
seen in EXHIBIT IV_D-5-1.
• They live in a Sustainable Agri-Forest with integrated forest incense trees and orchard palm trees described further in EXHIBIT IV_D-5-2 .

EXHIBIT IV_C-2 :: 18th Dynasty Queen Hatshepsut’s Expedition to Punt, Sheba, Meroe & Khenthunnefer: King & Queen of Punt Bring Tribute Wall Relief
II. King and Queen of Punt Bring Tribute to Egyptian/Kermit Expeditionary Force’s Camp
EXHIBIT NOTES:
• Note that the Puntians bring Tribute a second day directly to the land camp of the Egyptian Naval Expedition away from the Red Sea beach area using
donkeys to carry the merchandise and including cattle. The source of the wealth they bring as tribute is the Sustainable Agri-Forest (SAF) wherein they live
in their pole huts and tend to daily. Their SAF produces precious woods like ebony, sandlewood and the precious gum tree incenses frankincense and
myrrh, and is described further in EXHIBIT IV_D-5-2.
• Cattle were introduced into Africa by the Invader People and are seen throughout the relief, and are returned to Egypt/Kemit as tribute. Yet cattle are used
for diary products only by most people of the Egyptian civilization and its African continent tributary nations except perhaps the Puntians judging by the extreme
obesity of the Puntian Queen.
• Note that at this stage African wildlife are missing in the tributes from Punt the; e.g. leopards, giraffes, baboons. Such animals will be captured in the subsequent
land safari to Sheba or what we now call the “highlands” of Ethiopia, to Meroe what we now call the “ lowlands of Ethiopia around Lake Tana and Khenthunnefer
of the Central African Great Lakes in the next Exhibits.
• Note that their pole huts are the same as found on the Nile River to this modern day as shown in EXHIBIT IV_D-5-1.

EXHIBIT IV_C-3: Queen Hatshepsut’s Expedition to Punt, Sheba, Meroe and Khenthunnefer : Photo of Punt’s King & Queen Tribute Wall Relief
VI. People of Punt Mixed Racial Identity and Obese Queen of Punt Discussion
(from S. Glubok’s The Art of Egypt: Under the Pharaohs)
EXHIBIT NOTES:
• This is a photograph of the King & Queen of Punt Bring Tribute Wall Relief shown drawn in EXHIBIT IV_C-2. At the time of Queen Hatshepsut’s Punt Expedition in 1540 B.C. the
countries of Punt and Sheba (today’s Eritrea and Ethiopia) were controlled by a dynasty of “snake kings” of a ruthless nature until about 1370 B.C. when the Biblical Queen of Sheba’s ancestor Angebo defeated the “snake dynasty” and took over.
• The “snake dynasty” coincides with the Hyksos dynasty that took over Lower Egypt/Kemit and most of Asia Minor about 1780 B.C. during the 16 and 17 th Dynastys. They were a mixed race of the Black Sea area “Invader People” of white Scythia and Brown Dravidians of India Asia. The Puntian King as shown above appears to be so mixed racially with a goatee __ a characteristic Hyksos ethinc identity indicator.
• The steatophygic Puntian Queen however appears black African. She is grossly obese indicating adherence to a high animal flesh content diet and perhaps an accepted bizarre obese beauty standard. There is no indication of the Puntians following any of the black African Tribes characteristic lifestyle, except living in the same huts on poles type houses. This is quite different from that of the Anu Peoples, the Annu Culture of Ancient Egypt/Kemit and that of the legendary beauty of the Queen of Sheba.
Thus, although the Hyksos who ruled parts of Egypt/Kemit circa 1630 to 1530 BC were defeated by the founders of the 18th Dynasty of Queen Hatshepsut; the “snake dynasty” in Punt remained for more than another 200 years to 1370 B.C.

(W. S. Smith, “The Land of Punt”, Journal American Research Center in Egypt, Bk. 1, Boston, MA., 1962)
EXHIBIT NOTES:
• This portion of the Queen Hatshepsut Naval Expedition to Punt Wall Relief is
extremely vandalized and has been restored using computers by William Stevenson
Smith presented in “The Land of Punt”, Journal of the American Research Center in Egypt, Bk. 1, Boston, MA., 1962. An enlargement of a section of this composite 4 level wall relief is presented as EXHIBIT IV_D-4-2.
The above computer enhanced wall relief from the Pharaoh Queen Hatshepsut Deir el Bahari Burial Temple restores portions of the 4 levels of detail of the land safari into the "land of the ancestors/gods" (Ta Neter) commissioned by 18 th Dynasty Pharaoh-Queen Hatshepsut. It shows not only for the first time a male giraffe in the left corner of level three but a hippopotamus, baboon and cattle in the left corner of level four, a leopard in the center of level four.
• A historical corruption pattern emerges because a male giraffe appears for the first time in this 1962 computer restored Queen Hatshepsut Deir El Bahari Temple Wall
Relief Record of the Punt Expedition. For nearly 100 years since the appearance of the drawings by Egyptologist Auguste Marriette in 1877 and Egyptologist E.G. Naville in 1898 the existence of a male giraffe in the interior of mysterious “Ta Neter” was hidden in this heavily vandalized part of the Deir El Bahari Temple Wall Relief Records.
• Each of the 4 levels of the 1962 American Research Center in Egypt computer enhancement are separated, enlarged and presented as EXHIBIT IV_D-1b, EXHIBIT IV_D-2, EXHIBIT IV_D-3 and EXHIBIT IV_D-4-1.
• Thus conclusively the Queen Hatshepsut’s Punt Expedition encountered a male giraffe, a hippopotamus, a baboon and leopard on its land safari into the jungle interior of the country of Sheba, the country of Meroe and final destination of the country of Khenthunnefer of the Nile Great Lakes Region. All but the hippopotamus are captured and taken back to Ancient Egypt/Kemit as shown in the remaining part of the Queen Hatshepsut Deir El Bahari Temple Wall Relief Record of the Punt Expedition. Refer to Map 7 of the Nile River Valley to appreciate the geography of the Punt Expedition landing in Punt on the Red Sea and taking a land safari across Sheba (Ethiopia) and on to the Nile River Valley area of the Great Lakes of Central Africa.
• Please note that a study of the 4 levels of the Interior of Ta Neter as a whole shows a predominant Sustainable Agri-Forest with precious Frankincense and Myrrh Trees,
Palm Oil, Coconut and other valuable forest hardwoods wherein the people live in huts on poles with ladders and tend the Sustainable Agri-Forest.

Safari into the interior of Sheba (today’s Ethiopian highlands) and going westward away from the Red Sea coast of Punt. The body of waterappears a river tributary
of possibly the Atbara River or Blue Nile Rivers that flow into the Nile River in the Sudan as identified with fresh water animals including the crayfish.
• The Sustainable Agri-Forest is seen with Frankincense and Myrrh trees abundantly in the ground, transplant trees sacked to be transported back to Egypt, and
the harvesting of their sap in buckets for incense is being carried out. These incense trees were the primary economic purpose of Pharaoh-Queen Hatshepsut’s
Punt Expedition judging by the relative proportional detail devoted to these trees in the Wall Reliefs. The Frankincense and Myrrh incenses have special medicinal
And aromatic herbal and spiritual properties highly valued by the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) trained Pharaoh –Queen Hatshepsut. These
Incense trees are carried back to Egypt by boat as seen in EXHIBIT IV_E-1 and were planted at the Del el Bahari Temple in deep planting beds amongst other places.
The prepared Frankincense and Myrrh incense is shown back in Egypt/Kemit carried on trays and in sacks in Processional scenes in EXHIBIT IV_F-3, the composite

a land Safari to the area of ancient Sheba (modern Upper Highland Ethiopia), Meroe (modern Lake Tana Lower Ethiopia) and beyond. See Map 2 and Map 7.
• A dog of the African Bisenji type is shown outside the hut on poles with ladder on the far left is; and is described in the hieroglyphic text of EXHIBIT IV_E-1
as being loaded on the boat but not shown nor shown back in Egypt/Kemit.
• The Sustainable Agri-Forest is seen with trees abundantly in the ground, transplant trees sacked to be transported back to Egypt/Kemit,
and the harvesting of their sap for incense making is shown. Bringing back these Frankincense and Myrrh trees’ incense (sap) and young trees to transplant
was the primary socio-pilitical economic purpose of Queen Hatshepsut’s expedition judging by the relative proportional detail devoted to these trees in the Wall Reliefs.
The Frankincense and Myrrh gum incenses have special herbal and spiritual properties. These incense trees are carried back to Egypt/Kemit by boat and as the
prepared incense shown carried on trays and in sacks as seen in the loading scene of EXHIBIT IV_E-1, and the Procession scenes back in Egypt/Kemit in

dependent on the Nile River for survival. See EXHIBIT IV_D-4-2 for detail of the hippopotamus and baboon enlarged from the 4 level composite EXHIBIT IV_D_1a.
• The hippopotamus and the giraffe seen in EXHIBIT IV_D-3 are natural to the Central Equatorial African Nile Valley Great Lakes jungles and plains of the
countries of Meroe and Khenthunnefer. They were part of the Biblical “Garden of Eden” stretching along the Nile River Valley as a series of Sustainable
Agri-Forests. See EXHIBIT IV_G. By the time of this Punt Expedition circa 1540 BC. cattle had been introduced into Africa by the Scythian related
“Theban Invader Peoples” in the late Predynastic Period and significantly contribute to Its desertification.
According to Herodotus the people of ancient Egypt/Kemit were vegetarian/vegan. Thus Cattle are used for diary products only by the Anu peoples at this
time necessitated by the desertification destruction of the Sustainable Agri-Forests of the Nile River Valley. As the Hindus of Asia India the Anu People worship
their cattle using them for grassland survival.The Scythian derived cultures like the Greek, Hamites including the people of Punt used cattle meat and dairy
products as a protein food instead of the natural nuts and seeds. The adaptation around 5,000 BC of grains as food is cited in the Bible Genesis 3:18 (“Thorns also
and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field.”) as the consequence of being exiled from __ having destroyed the “Garden of Eden.”

• Above is an enlargement of the left half of the 1962 American Research Center in Egypt computer enhanced 4 levels of the Wall Relief presented as EXHIBIT IV_D-1a. The
hippopotamus on Level 4 and male giraffe on Level 3 can be better seen. These animals are natural to “Central Africa” or Khenthunnefer.
• One can better see the baboon on Level 4, noting 3 baboons are seen on board ship #4
in EXHIBIT IV_E-1, 2 baboons seen back in Egypt/Kemit in EXHIBIT IV_F-3 and 1 baboon in EXHIBIT IV_F-5.
Consequently, with the land safari capturing leopards and baboons which are brought back to Egyp/Kemit, it is within reason that this same male giraffe was shipped back to Egypt via a ship. This is confirmed in EXHIBIT IV_F-1 as the disfigured giraffe has male genitals.
• Note on the left of Level 2 the woman of the African Interior is not as obese as the Puntian Queen. On the right of Level 2 is seen the African Bisenji type dog.
• Cattle shown on Level 4 are seen back in Egypt/Kemit in EXHIBIT IV_F-1, EXHIBIT IV_F-3 and EXHIBIT IV_F-5.

EXHIBIT NOTE:
• The composite Wall Relief above of the huts on posts with ladder from the PharaohQueen Hatshepsut Punt Expedition Wall Reliefs was shown previously as EXHIBIT
IV_C-1 and EXHIBIT IV_C-2 used for housing in coastal Punt (modern Eritrea) by the Red Sea shore. Zoological analysis of the water identifies salt water animals of the Red Sea. They are obvious used for floodable housing area accommodation.
• Comparing with EXHIBIT IV_D-2 while showing the same huts on posts with ladder the water is a fresh water river or lake found in Sheba (immediate interior, modern Ethiopia) and in Meroe and Khenthunnefer (far interior) of the Nile River Central Great Lakes region.
B. TODAY___ NOW. . . 3,500 years later in the Sudan of Africa along the Nile River Valley [1976 AD.] the same huts on post with ladders are seen used by the black African aNubian peoples.
EXHIBIT NOTE:
• Three millenniums later we see the same huts on posts with ladder used by the aNubian people of the Nile River Valley in the Sudan of Africa. They are obvious still being used for floodable housing area accommodation. The difference in hut construction and shape is
strikingly similar indicating a connected anthropological cultural basis of the Anu Peoples of Nubia, Kush, Meroe and Khenthunefer of the Nile River Valley from the Mediterranean Delta to the African Great Lakes.

The truth is that the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) in the Predynastic Period created the United Nile River, and implemented the Sustainable AgriForstry System including intensive earthworm cultivation (vermiculure) along the entire course of the Nile River from the Great Lakes to the Ocean. This included the ”Table of the Sun” and Lake Moeris and produced the legendary Nile River agricultural fertility. See Chapter Two pages 1 through 12 and EXHIBIT I_D-3 and EXHIBIT I_D-4-1.

EXHIBIT NOTES:
• The baboon hieroglyph in the Left Text Column # 9 clearly indicates these animals were brought on board, and 3 apes can be seen on the ship deck shown above.
• The Leopard hieroglyph in the Left Text Column #8 clearly indicates this animal was brought on board the ships from the land Safari to Sheba, Meroe and Khenthunnefer. This is verified as leopards described in hieroglyphic text as from Sheba are presented to Pharaoh-Queen Hatshepsut back in Egypt in a processional ceremony presented in EXHIBIT IV_F-2 as well as in EXHIBIT IV_F-1 and EXHIBIT IV_F-5.
• The expedition was to the countries of Punt (Paunt) and Sheba and above the hieroglyphic of the country of Sheba or modern day high lands of Ethiopia is shown in the Right Text Columns # 1 and 2 read left to right and top and bottom. Conventional Egyptologist ignore the country of Sheba as an expedition destination by mistakenly translating its hieroglyphics as the adjective phrase “wonderful country” modifying the country Punt that follows its Hieroglyphics in column 2.
Esoterically, the Pharaoh-Queen Hatshepsut Punt Expedition’s 5 ships traveled from Egypt/Kemit through a Nile River canal to the Red Sea and then down the African Red Sea Coast south to a coastal harbor of Punt (today’s Eritrea) and anchored. They then took tribute from the King and Queen of Punt a vassal state Egypt/Kemit; and then mounted a land safari into Sheba (today’s Ethiopia) and then further into Meroe (today’s low land around Lake Tana of Ethiopia) and finally into Khenthunefer of the Nile River Great Lakes region.

EXHIBIT IV_E-4 :: Queen Hatshepsut’s Expedition to Punt, Sheba, Meroe and Khenthunnefer: 3 Departing Ships with “Missing” Giraffe Wall Relief
4. Enlargement of Three (3) (Ships Departing Punt with On-Board Giraffe “Missing”?
(from Auguste Mariette, Deir-el Bahari; Leipzig, Germany 1877)
EXHIBIT NOTE:
• The vandalized male giraffe hieroglyphic text identified in EXHIBIT IV_E-2 placing a
male giraffe on board one of the 5 ships is even more suspicious because the
conspicuous animal is not shown on board any of the ships leaving the Punt harbor.
Thus it is theorized a historical corruption pattern exists as to the “missing” male
giraffe for the prevailing racism against black Africa will not allow the truth to be revealed;
that “Ta Neter” is located in black Africa; i.e. it can not be a coincidence that:
i.) the male giraffe’s image is edited out and the male giraffe’s hieroglyphic text
disfigured unreadable in the 1877 archeological drawings by Egyptologist Auguste
Mariette (1877) shown in EXHIBIT IV_E-1 and in the 1898 archeological drawings by
Egyptologist E.G. Naville (1898) of the Deir El Bahari Temple Wall Relief of the 5
expedition ships leaving the harbor of Punt and returning to Ancient Egypt//Kemit.;
ii.) The male giraffe’s image is ruthlessly and completely vandalize erased from the actual
physical Wall Reliefs at the Queen Hatshepsut’s Deir El Bahari Temple of the land
Safari Wall Relief requiring computer reconstruction shown in EXHIBIT IV_D-1a; and
iii.) a male giraffe was definitely captured and brought back to Egypt by Pharaoh-Queen
Hatshepsut’s Punt Expedition presented herein as EXHIBIT IV_F-1 where the upper
portion of the male giraffe is vandalized but is irrefutable identification.
• Both EG. Naville’s 1894 Egyptological analysis and Barthold Laufer’s 1928
anthropological analysis defied racism toward black Africa and presented the
significance of the male giraffe in the Queen Hatshepsut Punt Expedition Wall Relief
Record. See both analyses in EXHIBIT IV_A.

EXHIBIT IV_E-5 :: 18 th Dynasty Queen Hatshepsut’s Expedition to Punt,
Sheba, Meroe and Khenthunnefer: Loading & Departing
Ship Wall Relief __ the “Missing” Giraffe’s Possible Location
5. Punt Harber Departing Ships Loading and Setting Sails Back to Egypt
Ships #5 #4 (Loading) Ships #3 #2 #1 (Departing)
(from Auguste Mariette, Deir-el Bahari; Leipzig, Germany 1877)
EXHIBIT NOTES:
• A historical corruption pattern emerges because the “missing” giraffe described in the Hieroglyphic records as having been loaded on board a departing ship leaving Punt analyzed in EXHIBIT IV_E-2, can not be seen in the Deir EL Bahari Temple Wall Relief Punt harbor departure drawings. Yet the on board presence of the “missing” giraffe is documented by its appearance back in Egypt/Kemit in EXHIBIT IV_F-1 which is properly interpreted in 1894 by Egyptologist EG. Naville and in 1928 by Anthropologist Barthold Laufer presented in EXHIBIT IV_A.
5’. Blowup of Ship #3 Leaving Punt Identifies Possible Position of the“Missing” Giraffe
Note the 2 crewmen standing and 1 sitting c
on sail rigging with sails set identify possible
rewman
position of where the “missing” giraffe on Departing
Ship #3 could be standing.
(from Auguste Mariette, Ibid; Leipzig, 1877)
EXHIBIT NOTES:
• Consequently, a possible answer to where the “missing” giraffe could be standing on
board one of the 5 loading and/or departing ships is revealed by a blowup above of
Departing Ship #3; i.e. the “missing” giraffe could be standing between the two standing
saillors setting the sails and seated sailor on the sail riggings, the latter possibly holding the
“missing” giraffe with a rope as shown in EXHIBIT I_H, EXHIBIT IV_I and EXHIBIT IV_J-1.
• The giraffe naturally habitats near its favorite food the Acacia tree of the plains and jungles
of the Central African Nile River Great Lakes known then as Khenthunnefer and in the
Bible as the “Garden of Eden”. Thus the motivation for the “missing” giraffe’s erasure and
disfigurement to hide the destination of Queen Hatshepsut’s land Safari after her 5 ships
landed in Punt (modern Eritrea) and caravanned into Meroe (modern Sudan) and Sheba
(modern Ethiopia) is clear.

EXHIBIT IV_F-1:: Pharaoh Queen Hatshepsut’s Expedition to Punt, Sheba, Meroe and Khenthennefer : Giraffe and Other Animals Brought Back to Egypt

201.
(from E.G. Naville, Temple of Deir el Bahari V. III)
/
EXHIBIT NOTES:
• The male Giraffe’s upper body neck and head have been vandalized destroyed but is easily identified and properly analyzed as proof of the Queen Hatshepsut’s Punt Expedition naval ship and land safari’s final destination to Khenthunefer in the Central Africa Nile River Great Lakes area. For a full description of Khenthunefer study EXHIBIT IV_A.
• Comparing this male Giraffe with the one shown in EXHIBIT IV_D-3 and EXHIBIT IV_D-4-2, they are both shown with male genitals suggesting that they are the same male Giraffe in the Del El Bahari Wall Relief records; i.e. the question of the final destination of Queen Hatshepsut’s Punt Expedition and thus the identity of ancient Egyptian’s “Ta Neter” or “land of the Gods” is unquestionably Central Africa’s Nile River Great Lakes called Khenthunefer in Ancient Egypt/Kemit.
• Thus the identity of the aboriginal founders of Ancient Egypt/Kemit as theorized by those courageous Egyptologists Abbe’ Emile Amelineau, Jean Champollion, George
James and Chek Anka Diop as the black African Nile River Valley people we know as the 4 Anu peoples of the (a)Nubia, Kush, Meroe and Anu Antiu (of Khenthunnefer) peoples.
• Leopards are sacred and were captured on the land safari into Sheba (modern Ethiopia highlands) and Meroe (modern lowlands of Sudan and Ethiopia) shown in EXHIBIT IV_D-4-1.
• Cattle too were sacred, the Sun Goddess Het Heru was symbolized as a cow and were cultivated in Punt and Sheba alongside the Sustainable Agri-Forest environment. According to the Greek Historian Herodotus the people of Egypt/Kemit did not use cattle for flesh food, but for their milk. Thus peoples of Punt and Sheba were probably meat eaters, while the Anu Peoples of Meroe and Khent Hun Nefer would have been vegetarian/vegan.
• The Predynastic introduction of cattle by invading peoples by 10,000 B.C. began the desertification of the Nile Valley “Garden of Eden” and top soil erosion silting the Nile Delta .



EXHIBIT IV_F-2: Procession of 18th Dynasty Queen Hatshepsut with Leopards from Sheba
I. EnIargement of a Rehef Segment NOT of the Punt Expedition Reliefs, but found in Hatsheput’s Deir el Bahari Temple (Circa 1490 BC.)
{From E.G. Naville, Temple of Deir el Bahari, Part 5 (Vol. 27 of Egypt Exploration Fund) 1906, Plate CXXV}
EXHIBIT NOTES:
• Though not part of the formal Punt Expedition Wall Reliefs within Queen Hatshepsut’s Deir el Bahari Temple souhthern collanade, this Wall Relief monument is found in another part of that temple as a Procession of the Queen.
• The leopards are clearly stated in the above Hieroglyphics column two of the relief to be from the country of Sheba as distinct from Punt. This distinctive hieroglyphic spelling of Sheba and Punt supports the belief of these as contiguous but separate countries confused in the historical documents: Sheba and Punt of antiquity are today’s Ethiopia and Eritrea geographic reality respectively.
Refer to EXHIBIT IV_A and EXHIBIT IV_B for an in-depth Anthropological and
Egyptological analyses of this view that Punt was contiguous and similar but distinct from
Sheba, Meroe and Khenthunnefer.
• These leopards must be from the Queen Hatshepsut Punt Expedition’s shipment and thus the same leopard collected on the land safari into Sheba, Meroe and
Khenthunnefer. Compare with leopards found in EXHIBIT IV_D-4-1a, EXHIBIT IV_F-1 and EXHIBIT IV_F-5.

EXHIBIT IV_F-3: Pharaoh Queen Hatshepsut’s Expedition Punt, Sheba, Meroe and Khenthunnefer : Processional Tribute to Queen Wall Relief
II. Processional Tribute to Queen Hatshepsut Showing Details of Hieroglyphics Identifying the of Lower Two Groups of Chiefs as from Punt and Sheba
(from Auguste Mariette, Deir-el Bahari; Leipzig, Germany 1877)
EXHIBIT NOTES:
• The above drawn figure is one of three parts EXHIBIT IV_F-3, EXHIBIT IV_F_5 and EXHIBIT IV_F-7 of the composite Deir El Bahari Temple Wall Relief drawing
presented as EXHIBIT IV_F-4. This segment of the Temple Wall Reliefs is the most important and thus most physically vandalized. The Egyptology source
document drawings of these Wall Reliefs have important drawing omissions, wrong transliterations of Hieroglyphic texts and other drawing “mistakes.” Together
this results in over 130 years of corruption of the identity of the Queen Hatshepsut Punt Expedition destinations; i.e. where was “Ta Neter” or “the Land of the
Gods” that Ancient Egypt/Kemit considered its aboriginal source of origin. Note that this “aboriginal origin” dates to the “Dynasty of the Gods” and “Dynasty
of the Demi-Gods” of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) trained historians Manthos and Herodotus before the Pre-Dynastic and Dynastic
Periods of Ancient Egypt/Kemit. See EXHIBIT IV-2.
• Note that the Wall Relief above contains a part of the procession including Frankincense and Myrrh incense trees, to be planted at various temples in Ancient
Egypt/Kemit including the Queen Hatshepsut Deir El Bahari Burial Temple containing the Punt Expedition Wall Reliefs. In addition this Wall Relief shows the
medicinally and spiritually useful Frankincense and Myrrh incense in bags and on trays, 5 cattle and 2 baboons. It overlaps the two lowest levels of four (4) levels
and 2 of 4 kneeling Chiefs (emissaries) presented in EXHIBITS IV_F-5, who returned to present their countries’ tribute personally to Queen Hatshepsut with
Hieroglyphics identifying their countries as Punt (modern Eritrea) and Sheba (the modern highland of Ethiopia). Compare with EXHIBIT IV_F-6 and EXHIBIT IV_F-7.

EXHIBIT IV_F-4: 18 th Dynasty Queen Hatshepsut’s Expedition Punt, Sheba, Meroe and Khenthunnefer : “Chiefs Bring Tribute to Queen Hatshepsut”
__ Composite Wall Relief
EXHIBIT IV_F-3 EXHIBITS IV_F-5 & EXHIBIT IV_F-6 EXHIBIT IV_F-7
COMPOSITE EXHIBIT NOTES:
• The above composite figure is from 3 separate Deir El Bahari Temple wall relief drawings by Egyptologists Augustes Marriete (1877) and EG Naville (1898)
found separately in the Egyptology source documents and herein EXHIBIT IV_F-3, EXHIBIT IV_F-5, composite EXHIBIT IV_F-6 and EXHIBIT IV_F-7.
This is done because this part of the Wall Reliefs is the most important and thus heavily vandalized in an attempt to cover up the identity of the destinations
of the Queen Hatsepsut Punt Expedition; i.e. the location of “Ta Neter” or “Land of the Gods” the aboriginal source of the people of Ancient Egypt/Kemit.
• The above composite Wall Relief includes the Procession featuring the expedition sailors, soldiers and Chiefs of the Punt Expedition’s destination countries
bringing Queen Hatshepsut tribute of the precious cargo brought back from the countries traveled to by the naval expedition and land safari. EXHIBIT IV_F-3
contains Frankincense and Myrrh incense trees to be planted at the various temples including her burial temple at Deir El Bahari and includes 4 cattle and 2
baboons. EXHIBIT IV_F-5 and composite EXHIBIT IV_F-6 contains 4 levels each with one of the four different groups of kneeling destination country Chiefs
(emissaries) identified with specific Hieroglyphics in a Procession bearing the medicianally and spiritually valuable Frankincense and Myrrh gum incense on
trays and in sacks, a leopard and another baboon on leash.
Especially study EXHIBIT IV_F-7 details the Hieroglyphic text identifying the Punt Expedition’s destination countries and returning Chiefs (emissaries)
who present tributes of animals, incense and other precious items personally to the 18 th Dynasty Ancient Egypt/Kemit Queen Hatshepsut.

Anu Antiu
(Khenthunnefer)
Meroe
Sheba
Punt
(from E.G. Naville, Temple of Deir el Bahari V. III, 1898)
EXHIBIT NOTES:
• This Wall Relief detail of Queen Hatshepsut Punt Expedition Procession identifies the Chiefs (emissaries) of the black African tribes shown on the top levels 4 and 3. They are respectively the Nine Bow Tribes #6 and #4 as shown in EXHIBIT IV-2.
Specifically the hieroglyphics in front of each of them identifies them as from the Anu Antiu people of Khenthennefer (today’s Central Equatorial African Nile River Great Lakes area) and from the people of Meroe (today’s Sudan and Ethiopia’s lowlands) including the “Island of Lake Tana” . This coincides with both the 1894 Egyptologist EG. Naville’s analysis and the 1928 Anthropologist Barthold Laufer’s analysis presented in EXHIBIT IV_A. Refer to Map #2 and Map 7.
Note that Meroe was included in ancient times within ancient “Ethiopia” or Sheba by Herodotus and other ancient historians, and is still confused by modern historians with the contiguous ancient country of Sheba the present day “Abyssinia\Ethiopia highlands.” This is contributed to by modern Ethiopia including parts of ancient Meroe.
• Because this drawing by Egyptologist E.G. Naville of the Queen Hatshepsut Punt
Expedition Procession Wall Relief does not show the complete hieroglyphic details of the lower levels 2 and 1 of the four levels of kneeling Tributary Nation Chiefs; a composite is made from the drawing by Egyptologist Auguste Mariette and presented herein as EXHIBIT IV_F-6.
The racially mixed (part Black African and Asian Indian Dravidian) people of the bottom levels 2 and 1 with curled goatees are the people of the coast of Punt (today’s Eritrea) and interior contiguous Sheba (today’ Ethiopia’s highlands) and are ethnically related to the Theban Invader People of Pre-Dynastic Egypt known as the Hamites who in turn are a Scythian derivative.
• EXHIBIT IV_F-7 hieroglyphic text to this entire Procession further confirms the identifications of the 4 groups of kneeling Tributary Nation Chiefs.

II. Composite from Various Drawings of Chief’s of Punt, Sheba, Meroe and Khenthunnefer Presenting Tribute to Queen Hatshepsut
COMPOSITE EXHIBIT NOTE:
• The Chiefs of the black African tribes shown on the top levels 4 and 3 are respectively the Nine Bow Tribes #6 and #4 as shown in EXHIBIT IV-2. The Hieroglyphs in front of them identify them as the Anu Antiu people of Khenthennefer the Central Equatorial African Nile River Great Lakes country; and as people from the country of Meroe known as the the “Island of Lake Tana”, the present day Sudan and “Ethiopian lowlands”. Meroe was confused then as now with Sheba the “Abyssinian\Ethiopian highlands.” See Map 2 and Map 7.
This coincides with both the 1894 Egyptologist EG. Naville’s analysis and the 1928 Anthropologist Barthold Laufer’s analysis presented in EXHIBIT IV_A.
• This composite of Egyptologists Auguste Mariette and E.G. Naville drawings shows the complete hieroglyphic details of the Wall Relief of the lower levels 2 and 1 kneeling Tributary Nation Chiefs (emissaries) not seen in the Egyptologist EG. Naville’s drawing presented as EXHIBIT IV_F-5.
Thus the racial mixture (part Black African and Asian Indian Dravidian) of the Chiefs of the bottom levels 2 and 1 with curled goatees are the people of the coast of Punt (today’s Eritrea) and interior contiguous Sheba (Abyssinia today’s Ethiopian High lands). These Pre-Dynastic “invader peoples” are ethnically related to the Theban Invader People of Pre-Dynastic Egypt who introduced cattle into Africa and are ethnically and racially mixed part Euro-Asian Scythian Caucasian known as the Hamites.
• EXHIBIT IV_F-7 Hieroglyphic text to this entire Procession further confirms the identifications of the 4 groups of kneeling Tributary Nation Chiefs.

EXHIBT NOTES:
• One must conclude from the Hieroglyphic text above describing the Procession scenes
shown in EXHIBIT IV_F-3, EXHIBIT IV_F-4, EXHIBIT IV_F-5 and EXHIBIT IV_F-6 that:
1.) Hieroglyphics on the top of column 2 identify the Anu Antiu people of the country
Khenthunnefer while the Hieroglyphics at the bottom of column 2 identify people from
the contiguous country of Meroe, the “Island of Lake Tana are almost totally obliterated;
2.) the location of “Ta Neter” the “lands of the gods” and ancestral origin of the ancient
Egypt/Kemit was the Equatorial Nile River Great Lakes country Khenthennefer;
inhabited by the black African Anu Antiu, an Anu People shown as Nine Bow Tribal
Nation #6 in EXHIBIT IV-2;
2.) with the Hieroglyphics for the countries of Sheba and Punt in column 1; the black African
Anu Antiu of Khenthunnefer were distinct from the racially mixed inhabitants of the
coastal area of Punt (modern Eritrea) and the interior contiguous Sheba (modern
highlands of Ethiopia); and
3.) Khenthunefer identified as Ta Neter or “Land of the Gods” was the Bible’s “Garden
of Eden”. See EXHIBIT IV_D-5-2 and EXHIBIT IV_G.

EXHIBIT IV_I: Kush Viceroy Rekh-mi-re Tomb - Upper Egypt and Sudan Tribute to Pharaoh Amenhotep II, circa 1470—1410 BC. (18th Dynasty)
From Tomb of Rekh-mi-re, Theban Necropolis (No 100, reigns of Thothmoses Ill and Amenhotep II, 1470-1410; in K.E. Aallakh, Treasures of the Nile; Art of Temples and Tombs, pg. 106
EXHIBIT NOTES:
• “Two Southerners Restraining A Giraffe. Tomb of Rekh-mi-re. Theban necropolis [No.
100). Reigns of Tuthmosis Ill and, Amenhotep II, 1490-1410 BC.” (From K.E. Aallakh, Treasures of the Nile; Art of Temples and Tombs, pg. 106) (emphasis added)
• The above “Southerners” are black African Anu people from the contiguous area of Khenthunnefer Central Africa Nile Great Lakes area and/or Meroe (Southern Sudan)> Thery bring as Tribute a captured giraffe tethered with ropes around its feet to the Kush Viceroy Rekh-mi-re of probably 18 the Dynasty Pharaoh Amenhotep II of Ancient Egypt/Kemit.
Since Expeditions to Punt occurred during the reigns of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) trained Annu Pharaoh; we can deduce this Tribute from Punt occurred during the reign of Annu Pharaoh Amenhotep II and not during the reign of the Theban Sorcery School trained Pharaoh Thothmoses III. This later 18 th Dynasty
stationing of a Kush Viceroy to receive Tribute from contiguous but remote Meroe and Khenthunnefer was a more cost effective and efficient way than Punt Expeditions.
Thus esoterically this further supports the contention that Pharaoh Amenhotep II was trained by the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) because it believed that “Ta Neter” was identified as the starting point of Ancient Egypt/Kemit and was centered in the Nine Bow Tribes founded upon the 4 black African Tribes of the Anu People. See EXHIBIT III_B-1, and Exhibit III_B-2 for further discussion of Pharaoh Amenhotep II.
• The Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) believed the giraffe sacred since it meditates on the sun at dawn and dusk as they do in the Aten Path or practice of “Light and Sound” Yoga. See EXHIBIT IV_J-2.

• Esoterically it shows Black African Anu People doing a “Sunrise and Sunset Yoga meditation”, very similar to exercises in modern Hatha Yoga. This explains
the spiritual significance of the giraffe since they too sun meditate at sunrise and sunset. It is theorized this “Sunrise and Sunset Yoga meditation” was part of
the aboriginal Science of Spirituality system of the Aten Path of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu). See Exhibit I_I-1_2.

APPENDIX_I-A: INTRODUCTION TO SPIRITUALITY SYSTEM DOCTRINE STANDARD
The primeval pre-dynastically founded Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) had at its core the aboriginal and esoteric spirituality system called the ”Aten Path”. Towards the School of On’s” end as the major player in Ancient Egypt/Kemit’s theocratic government and society, the “Aten Path” was publically revealed and made famous by 18 th Dynasty “heretic” Pharaoh Akhenaten. In the short-lived newly built capital city of Akhetaten (Amarna) he made the “Aten Path” the social religion. Thus he is historically credited as having established the first monotheistic religion.
But the “Aten Path” was esoterically revealed in Pre-Dynastic Egypt/Kemit to the sacred peoples of the Nile River Valley the four black African Anu Peoples. These culturally connected peoples lived in the egyptian vassal states of Nubia, Kush, Meroe and Khenthunnefer; along the Nile River’s course respectively from the Delta to the Great Lakes of Central Africa. The “Aten Path” was based on the Continuous Cosmogonic Event described on the 32 nd Dynasty Shabaka Stone now in the British Museum, itself a copy of a Pre-Dynastic period original stone document. Wherein the formless Creative being Annu created and continues to create matter, form and the universe postulated today by astro-physicists as the “ big bang event” ___ the Continuous Cosmogonic Event.
Simultaneously, the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) was monotheistic and
polytheistic with 12 sun Gods and goddesses all emanated from the 1 st God the Most High Godhead Annu. See Appendix I-B for more cosmographic detail.
These Spirituality System Doctrines were identified from the comparative religious writings of 8 th Spiritual plane light and sound (Surat Shabd) Yoga Master Sant Kirpal Singh Ji (Crown of Life and Naam or Word) and found in other religions; e.g. described by the Christians as the “tree of life”, “light of god”; “the word” by the Muslim Sufis as “Hu”, by the ancient Pythagoreans as the “celestial harmony”, by the Sikhs as Surat Shabd, by the Hindus as Naam to name a few. The descriptive phrases of “celestial sound” and “celestial light” are found without failure in the translations of the world spirituality traditions. The spirituality principles of the “Aten Path” were and still are the only tried and true path to the “salvation of the human Soul” no matter what name it is called and what religious tradition one finds it.
The Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) is cited in the Bible as the “School of On” which trained Joseph (Genesis 41: 45, 50, and 46::20); and is infered by the Bible as having trained Moses (Acts of the Apostles 7:22) confirmed by Josephus the Historian. The “School of On” trained the theocratic pharaohs and other royalty, vizars and other bureacrats and professional and cultural leaders of Ancient Egypt/Kemit that are associated with its greatest spirituality, public works, cultural and political achievements. The Schools 42 Books of Thoth curriculum are described by Clement of Alexandria in the third century A.D. (A. Deiber, Clement d’ Alexandria et L’ Egypte, Cairo, 1904, pg 72, translated in R.A. Schwaller de Lubicz, Sacred Science, the King of Pharaonic Theocracy, Appendix V, Vt. 1988). The original 42 Books of Thoth in hieroglyphics are still “lost”, and the ones Clement of Alexandria viewed in the 3 rd Century A.D. are by necessity Ptolomy Greek period Egyptian copies translated into Greek now “missing” in the Roman Catholic Church’s Vatican Library.
The nature, influence and history of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) was partially presented in George James’ Stolen Legacy (J. Richardson, San Francisco, 1976) and is further completed herein. The “Aten Path” was taught at the “Inner Sun” (Aten) worshipping Temple Colleges of the “School of On” based on meditation on the Annu Khet (symbolized by the circular cross the Ankh) or “stream of creative life energy” that emanates constantly from the Supreme Being the Annu. The “School of On’s” main temple schools were at Tentyra, “AnebHetch” (Memphis) and “Annu of the North” (On or Heliopolis) with its main campus and “Aten
Path” initiation site at the Gizah Plateau Pyramid and Sphinx Rock Sculpture and its 2 Temples.
Outlined in ths section are the Nine Spirituality Doctrines of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu), its “Path of the Aten 7 or Atannu” and its spirituality curriculum as part of the 42
THE EGYPTIAN MYSTERY “SCHOOL OF ON”, VOL. 1; BY GEORGE SINGLETON, ENLIGHTENMENT PUBLICATIONS, 2003 EDITION
221.
Books of Thoth along with its Greek philosopher student alumni. In constrast the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) is compared with its antithetical spiritism/spiritualism theocratic rival the Theban “Sorcery” Lodge School centered at the outer moon and sun worshipping, Osiris-AmenRa god triumpherant whose Grand Masonic Lodge was located at the Thebes Luxor Metropolis. Finally, the modern day Surat Shabd Yoga in America known as the Science of Spirituality is compared to show it as an identical match to the ancient “Aten Path”. All praises to the Master and the Godhead Annu!

INTRODUCTION TO SPIRITUALITY SYSTEM DOCTRINE STANDARD (continued)
CONCLUDING: THE AMEN-RA AND OSIRIS-ISIS CULTS OF THE THEBAN SORCERY LODGES WERE BASED ON THE ANTITHETICAL TO SPIRITUALITY PRACTICES OF SPIRITISM,
SPIRITUALISM, MESMERISM AND HYPNOSIS. SURAT SHABD (INNER LIGHT AND SOUND) YOGA MASTER SANT KIRPAL SINGH JI IN CROWN OF LIFE, PGS. 233-235 DIFFERENTIATES
SPIRITUALITY AS PRACTICED BY ASPIRAMTS OF THE ATEN PATH OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MYSTERY SCHOOL OF ON (ANNU) AND TODAY’S LIGHT AND SOUND (SURAT SHABD) YOGA
FROM SPIRITISM, SPIRITUALISM, MESMERISM AND HYPNOSIS BELOW.
A) “SPIRITUALITY [AS OPPOSED TO SPIRITISM, SPIRITUALISM, HYPNOSIS AND MESMERISM] IS THE SCIENCE OF THE SOUL, AND CONSEQUENTLY, IT DEALS WITH ALL ASPECTS OF THE
SOUL, WHERE IT RESIDES IN THE HUMAN BODY, ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE BODY AND WITH THE MIND, HOW IT SEEMINGLY ACTS AND REACTS THROUGH AND ON THE SENSES, ITS REAL
NATURE, AND HOW IT CAN BE SEPARATED FROM ALL ITS FINISHING ADJUNCTS. IT DESCRIBES THE SPIRITUAL JOURNEYING WITH ITS WEALTH OF SPIRITUAL PLANES AND SUB-PLANES,
THE SPIRITUAL POWERS AND POSSIBILITIES AND THEIR INTRINSIC WORTH.”
“SPIRITUALITY DISCLOSES WHAT THE HOLY WORD IS AND HOW TO COMMUNE WITH IT, TELLS US THAT THE ULTIMATE GOAL IS SELF-REALIZATION (SELF-KNOWLEDGE} AND GOD
REALIZATION (GOD-COMMUNION AND UNION HIERARCHICALLY UP TO THE GODHEAD ANNU), OR THE UNION OF THE SOUL WITH THE OVER-SOUL, AND TEACHES HOW IT CAN BE ACHIEVED
BY MEANS OF SURAT SHABD YOGA OR THE PATH OF THE SOUND (AND LIGHT} CURRENT(S).”
B) “SPIRITISM INCULCATES A BELIEF IN THE EXISTENCE OF DISEMBODIED SOULS APART FROM MATTER, WHICH ARE BELIEVED BY THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN SPIRITISM TO HAUNT EITHER THE
NETHER REGIONS AS GHOSTS OR EVIL SPIRITS, OR EVEN AS ANGELS OR GOOD SPIRITS IN THE LOWER ASTRAL REGIONS. AT TIMES, THEY EVEN BECOME INTERESTED IN THE INDIVIDUAL
HUMAN AFFAIRS, AND FOR THE FULFILLMENT OF LONG-CHERISHED BUT UNFULFILLED DESIRES, TRY TO SEEK GRATIFICATION BY ALL SORTS OF TRICKS, AND THOSE WHO DABBLE IN THE
BLACK ARTS CLAIM AND PROFESS TO EXERCISE POWER OVER THEM THROUGH MAGICAL (SORCERY) INCANTATIONS.”
C) “SPIRITUALISM GOES ONE STEP FURTHER THAN SPIRITISM. IT IS A BELIEF IN THE SURVIVAL OF THE HUMAN PERSONALITY AFTER PHYSICAL DEATH, AND THE POSSIBILITY OF
COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE LIVING AND THE DEAD. THE ADVOCATES OF SPIRITUALISM VERY OFTEN HOLD SEANCES FOR GETTING INTO COMMUNICATION WITH SO-CALLED SPIRITS.
THEIR MODUS OPERANDI IS BY MEDIUMSHIP, FOR THEY WORK THROUGH SOME SORT OF MEDIUM, MAYBE A PLANCHETTE (OR WEIJI BOARD) FOR PLANCHETTE WRITING, A TABLE FOR
TABLE RAPPING, OR EVEN A HUMAN BEING [MEDIUM] WHO IS RENDERED UNCONSCIOUS SO THAT THE SPIRIT CALLED MAY MAKE USE OF HIS BODY AND COMMUNICATE THROUGH IT. THIS
RELATIONSHIP GENERALLY WORKS BETWEEN JUST THE PHYSICAL OR EARTH PLANE AND THE LOWEST SUB-ASTRAL PLANES KNOWN AS MAGNETIC FIELDS. ..... THE RESULTS THAT
FOLLOW FROM SUCH COMMUNICATIONS ARE VERY LIMITED IN SCOPE, MOSTLY UNRELIABLE AND EXTREMELY HARMFUL TO THE MEDIUM, WHO SUFFERS A TERRIBLE LOSS AT TIMES BY
DEPRIVATION OF HIS INTELLIGENCE. ..... SPIRITUALISM, APART FROM THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE SURVIVAL OF SPIRITS AFTER DEATH, ADDS LITTLE TO OUR EXPERIENCE
AND OFFERS NOTHING OF SUBSTANCE IN THE WAY OF SPIRITUALITY.”
“THE MASTERS OF SPIRITUALITY, THEREFORE, STRONGLY CONDEMN THE PRACTICE OF SPIRITUALISM, THEIR CONTACT AND INTERCOURSE WITH THE SPIRITUAL REGIONS RIGHT TO
THE MANSION OF THE LORD (SACH KHAND) ARE DIRECT AND THEY COME AND GO AT THEIR SWEET WILL AND PLEASURE, WITHOUT ANY LET OR HINDRANCE AND INDEPENDENT OF THE
SUBJECTIVE PROCESS OF MEDIUMSHIP. WHILE THEIR [THE SPIRITUALITY MASTERS’] APPROACH IS QUITE NORMAL, NATURAL, DIRECT AND CONSTRUCTIVE, THE SPIRITUALIST ON
THE OTHER HAND WORKS SUBJECTIVELY, INDIRECTLY, AND MEDIATELY THROUGH A PROCESS WHICH IS FRAUGHT WITH DANGERS AND RISKS BOTH TO HIMSELF AND THE MEDIUM.”
“BUT NONE OF THE MASTER’S DISCIPLES (OF SPIRITUALITY) NEED BOTHER ABOUT THEM, AS NO EVIL INFLUENCE CAN COME NEAR ONE WHO IS IN COMMUNION WITH
THE HOLY WORD, FOR IT IS SAID: ‘THE GREAT ANGEL OF DEATH IS AN INVINCIBLE FOE, BUT HE TOO FEARS TO COME NEAR ONE IN COMMUNION WITH THE WORD. HE
FLIES FAR OUT AND AWAY FROM THE CHANTS OF THE DIVINE HARMONY, LEST HE FALL A VICTIM TO THE WRATH OF THE LORD.”

229.

INTRODUCTION TO SPIRITUALITY SYSTEM DOCTRINE STANDARD (CONTINUED)
D) HYPNOSIS AND MESMERISM ___”THE ABOVE REMARKS [ABOUT SPIRITUALISM AND SPIRITISM] APPLY EQUALLY TO HYPNOSIS AND MESMERISM, IN BOTH OF WHICH A PERSON WITH
A STRONGER WILL POWER TRIES TO INFLUENCE THOSE WITH WEAKER STAMINA BY MEANS OF PASSES OF HAND OR GESTURES COUPLED WITH A RIVETED ATTENTION ON THE
SUBJECT..... IN CERTAIN AILMENTS, LIKE HYSTERIA, ETC. SOME PHYSICIANS ALSO MAKE USE OF THESE PROCESSES AND ARE ABLE TEMPORARILY TO EFFECT CURES AND PAIN AND
ACHES FOR WHICH THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO FIND A PROPER REMEDY.”
(FROM SANT KIRPAL SINGH JI, CROWN OF LIFE) (EMPHASIS ADDED)
FOOTNOTES:
1. “PYTHAGORAS ALSO TALKED OF SHABD {HOLY CREATIVE WORD\ANNU-KHET} FOR HE DESCRIBED GOD AS ‘SUPREME MUSIC OF THE NATURE OF HARMONIES’. GOD WAS TO
HIM, ‘ABSOLUTE TRUTH, CLOTHED IN LIGHT’. WHEN HE COMMANDED AN EAGLE TO FLY DOWN TO HIM AND A BEAR TO STOP RAVAGING APULIA, THE WONDERING MULTITUDE
INQUIRED OF HIM THE SOURCE FROM WHERE SUCH POWERS CAME TO HIM. HE REPLIED THAT HE OWED IT ALL TO THE ‘SCIENCE OF LIGHT’.”
(SANT KIRPAL SINGH JI, CROWN OF LIFE, PG. 189)
THIS AND OTHER FACTS IDENTIFY PYTHAGORAS AS AN ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MYSTERY SCHOOL OF ON (ANNU) AND “ATEN PATH” DISCIPLE. ESOTERICALLY PYTHAGORAS
ESCAPED FROM THE CROTONA SICILY MOB THAT IS REPORTED TO HAVE KILLED HIM TO ATHENS, GREECE AND CONTINUED HIS “ATEN PATH” DECIPLESHIP TEACHINGS WHICH
INFLUENCED SOCRATES.
2. IT IS WRITTEN OF SOCRATES THAT HE HEARD WITHIN HIM A PECULIAR SOUND WHICH PULLED HIM IRRESISTIBLY INTO HIGHER SPIRITUAL REALMS”. (SANT KIRPAL SINGH JI,
CROWN OF LIFE, PG. 189). ESOTERICALLY PYTHAGORAS WAS SOCRATES’ SPIRITUAL FATHER AND SOCRATES TOO WAS AN ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MYSTERY SCHOOL OF ON
(ANNU) STUDENT AND “ATEN PATH” DISCIPLE. SEE POEM 7 F, FOOTNOTE C, HEREIN.

APPENDIX_I-C_1: CHRISTIAN REFERERENCES TO SPIRTUALITY SYSTEM
A. (1) In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. (2) The earth was without form, and void; and darkness was on the face of the deep. And the spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters. (3) God said. ‘Let there be light’: and there was light.
(4) And God saw the light, that it was good; and God divided the light from the darkness.” Bible. Genesis 1:1-4 (emphasis added)
B. (1) “That which was from-the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled. concerning the Word of life.
(2) The life was manifested, and we have seen, and bear witness, and declare to you that eternal life which was with the Father and was manifested to us. (5) This is the message which we have heard from Him and declare to you, that God is light and in Him is no darkness at all.”
Bible. First Epistle of John 1:1-2, 5 (emphasis added)
17) “Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of Lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow or turning.” (James 1:17)
C. “In St. John, Chapter One, we come to an elaborate exposition of the teachings of (Jesus) Christ. He begins his Gospel with the memorable words. the intrinsic significance of which few have cared to Grasp:
D. (1) ‘In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God. And the Word was God.’ (2) ’The same was in the beginning with God.’ (3) ‘All things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made that was made. (4) In Him was life; and the life was the light of men.’ (5) ‘And the Light shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not.’ (6) ‘There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.’ (7) ‘This man came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all thru’ him might believe.’ (8) ‘He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that light.’

(13) ‘Who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.’ (14) ‘And the Word became flesh and dwelt amongst us. And we beheld His glory, the glory as the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.’ (John 1:1-14)

APPENDIX_I-C_2: CHRISTIAN REFERENCES TO SPIRITUALITY SYSTEM
In the above statement of St. John. there cannot be any doubts about the nature of the Word. It is clearly the light and the life of the world, the creative life principle in which we live, move, and have our being.
{The Word} is the spirit of God, the very essence of the soul but now lost in the mighty swirl of the world and all that is worldly. t is only the contact with the Spirit {the Word} that shows the way back to God and thus is the true religion.
This contact {or ‘initiation’ into and with the Spirit\Word of God} is termed variously as the second birth, the resurrection, or the coming into life again.” (from Kirpal Singh’s Crown of Life, pgs. 206 and 207) (emphasis added)
D. (23) “Then Jesus said unto his disciples, ‘If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.”
(26) “For whosoever will save his life shall lose it and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.
(27) “For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?” (Matthew 16: 24-26)
“The Path that Jesus taught is one of self-abnegation and of rising above body-consciousness, a process which is tantamount to the experience of death in life. It means one has to sacrifice the Outer man, consisting of the flesh and the carnal mind, for the sake of the Inner man or soul. In other words, he has to exchange the life of the senses for the life of the spirit."
(from Kirpal Singh’s Crown of Life, pgs. 206. 207) (emphasis added)
E. “Jesus was conversant with the thought and practiced the Path of the Masters of the Audible Life Current,...
(22) ‘The light of the body is the eye; if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.
(23) “But if shine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness how great is that darkness.” (Matthew 6: 22-23)
“Obviously, ‘the eye’ refers to the single eye’ and the words ‘if shine eye be single, means concentrated awareness within at the center beiween and at the back of the eyes. Again, the words ‘if shine eye be evil' refer to a state of mental dispersion without as opposed to concentration within, and the result will certainly be darkness’ darkness born of ignorance about the true and real values of life, for this is the greatest ill of the soul.”
F. “(15) But hearing, ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive.’ (16) But blessed are your eyes for they see. and your ears for they hear.”

(17) ”For verily I say unto. you that many prophets and righteous men desired to see those things which ye see. and have not seen them. and to hear those things which ye hear: and have not heard them.” (Matthew 13: 15-17)
“In clear and unambiguous words, we have a reference to the inner spiritual experience, a realization of the Kingdom of Light and Harmony, which a real Master like Jesus could make manifest to his disciples.”
Like other seers. Jesus gave a mystical experience to his sincere disciples.” (from Kirpal Singh’s Crown of Life, pg. 206) (emphasis added)
E. “(13) ‘Now as the people were in expectation, and all reasoned in their hearts about John, whether he was the Christ or not. (16) ‘John answered, saying to them all, ‘I indeed baptize you with water; but One mightier than I is coming, whose sandal strap, I am not worthy to loose. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit Ghost and with Fires!’ (17) ‘His winnowing fan is in his hand, and He will thoroughly purge His threshing floor, and gather the wheat into His barn, but the chaff He Will burn with unquenchable fire.” (Luke 3:15-17)
We have to mark carefully the words ‘baptize by the Holy Ghost Spirit ‘and ‘fire’, for one refers to the heavenly music the Holy Word and the other is symbolic of the heavenly Light, and these are the twin principles of Sound and Light, the Primal manifestations of Godhead, or God’s Power behind the entire creation.” (from Kirpal Singh Ji's Crown of Life, pg. 208) (emphasis added)
H. “The way to the Kingdom of God can be opened unto him who knows how ‘ask, for it, how to seek’ it out and how to ‘knock’ at the gate.
In these 3 simple words St. Matthew in Chapter 7 summed up what the aspirant has to do. Unfortunately. we do not yet know where the gate to be knocked at Iies.
‘(7) ‘Ask, and it will be given to you: seek, and you will find: knock, and it will be opened to you. (8) For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened.” (Matthew 7: 7-8)
13) “. . .About this gate St. Matthew tell us: ‘Enter by the narrow gate: for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction. and there are many who go in by it. (14) ‘Because narrow is the gate and difficult is the way which leads to life, and there are few who find it.” (Matthew 7:13-4)

Christian Bible References to the School of “On”, esoterically “Annu”
A. From Swift Platinum Easton’s Topical Bible :
“On: light; the sun, (Gen. 41:45, 50), the great seat of sun-worship, called also Bethshemesh (Jer. 43:13) and Aven (Ezek. 30:17), stood on the east bank of the Nile, a few miles north of Memphis, and near Cairo, in the north-east. The Vulgate and the LXX. Versions have "Heliopolis" ("city of the sun") instead of On in Genesis and of Aven in Ezekiel.
The "city of destruction" Isaiah speaks of (Isaiah 19:18, marg. "of Heres;" Heb. 'Ir-ha-heres, which some MSS. (manuscripts) read Ir-ha-heres, i.e., "city of the sun") may be the name given to On, the prophecy being that the time will come when that city which was known as the "city of the sun-god" shall become the "city of destruction" of the sun-god, i.e., when idolatry shall cease, and the worship of the true God be established.
In ancient times this city was full of obelisks dedicated to the sun. Of these only one now remains standing. "Cleopatra's Needle" was one of those which stood in this city in front of the Temple of Tum, i.e., "the sun." It is now erected on the Thames Embankment, London.
"It was at On that Joseph wooed and won the dark-skinned Asenath, the daughter of the high priest of its great temple." This was a noted university town, and here Moses gained his acquaintance with "all the wisdom of the Egyptians."
B. From Naves’ Topical Bible:
“On: Capital of Lower Egypt (also known as Heliopolis or Annu of the North) (Genesis 41: 45, 46: 20).”
C. From the Bible, King James’ Version:
Genesis 41: 45 “And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On. And Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt.”
Genesis 41:50 “And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him.”
Genesis 46: 20 “And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him.”
Acts of the Apostles 7:22 “And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds.”
D. From Swift Platinum Easton’s Topical Bible :
Moses “at length became ‘learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians’ (Acts 7:22). Egypt had then two chief seats of learning, or universities, at one of which, probably that of Heliopolis (On), his education was completed.” (emphasis added)

FROM GEORGE JAMES’ STOLEN LEGACY. P. 178 ___ On Jesus Christ and the “School of On”
NOTE: George James confounds the Theban Masonic Lodges with the School of On at Giza which were distinct and antithetical rivals.



APPENDIX_I-D_1: ISLAMIC REFERENCES TO SPIRITUALITY SYSTEM
A. “ . . . Sufism, which bears a curious resemblance to the Atenism of Akhenaten. Although of a much later date being a form of mystlcism within Islam, it retains traces of sun worship.
Originating, possibly from Indo-Aryan peoples and from that part of the world once inhabited by the Mittanians, the object of Sufism was to make the soul purely spiritual and unite it by love with God from whom it {the soul) emanated as a ray emanates from the sun.
The Sufi devotee by training had to rise through three degrees of holiness to the highest certainty. At this stage the transcendental objective god became subjective, and the Sufi devotee found that he himself was consciously God.” from Joy Collier’s The Heretic Pharaoh {Akhenaten} pg. 127 (emphasis added).
NOTE: 1)The common mystic usage of “HU” by the "Aten Path” of Ancient Egypt/Kemit and by the Sufi Muslims is no coincidence. See Section E of this Appendice below. 2) The “three degrees of hoIiness” esoterically means the Third Spiritual Plane – See Poem #7b and POEM #7c and Appendice_I-B. 3) The Mittanians were “Indo-Aryan” mixed people, were a “Nine
Bow” Nation and was influenced by the Annu Culture of Ancient Egypt/Kemit. See Exhibit IV-2 and POEM #7b and POEM #7D.
B. “About the Prophet Mohammed it is said in Al-anwar of Maulana Sheikh Modh. Akram Sabri that at the age of 40 he began receiving messages from God, after he had for 15 years practiced communion with Awaz Mustpuim, Anhad Shabd or the Ceaseless Word, and had seen the glimpses of truth as flashes of heavenly Light for 7 years. At one time he remained for 2 years in the cave of Hira in meditation.”
(from Kirpal Singh Ji’s, Naam or Word, pg.106)
‘It is further stated that the prophet practiced in the cave of Hira for 6 years, the Sultan-uI-Azkar Surat Shabd Yoga and that Hazrat Abdul Qadir Jillani. did the same for 12 years in that sacred cave
(from Kirpal Singh Ji’s, Naam or Word, pg. 141)
C. “In the Muslim scriptures, the ‘inner lighted sound’, Shabd or Creative Word is variously described as:
- Kalam-i-Ilahi (The Voice of God) - Nida-i-Asmani (The Sound from Heaven) - sm-i-Azam (The Great Name) - Saut-i-Sarmadi (The Intoxicating Sound) - Saut-i-Nasira (The Sound Melodious) - Kalam-i-Maiid (The Great Commandment and - Kalam-i-Hag (The Voice of Truth)
which can be heard inside, and it was taught as Sultan-ul-Azkar (or the King of prayers) {i.e,. Surat Shabd Yoga in modern times).”
“We have in numerable references to this Sound in the teachings of the Mohammedan Fakirs {Sufi Saints practicing Light and Sound Yoga} -Maulana Rumi, Shah Niaz, and Hafiz.

APPENDIX_I-D_2: ISLAMIC REFERENCES TO SPIRITUALITY SYSTEM
D. “Shah Nias, another {Sufi} Muslim devotee, says: ‘Soul is the Will and the Secret of God. Its meditation is carried on without the help of tongue and palate. Ala! thou art stuck fast in the physical bondage and do not hear the Holy Sound of God, My beloved is speaking to thee all the while, but woe to thee for thou heareth not the Voice.
Again, ‘The whole universe is resounding with the Sound. and thou hast only to open the door of thine ears. For opening the ears, it is sufficient to stop hearing the outer sounds. If you do this, you will hear the perpetual and unending Sound. It is infinite and has no beginning nor end, and on account of that it is called Anhad without any limits. Without this word, the Eternal Sound, an expression of the Infinite, the world could not have come into existence. Hold communion with the Melodious Sound and lose yourself in it. O wise man. Proceedeth without Words.” (from Kirpal Singh Ji’s Naam or Word, pg. 82)
E. “{Sufi Muslim Saint} Hazrat lnayat Khan in his book The Mysticism of Sound speaks of the creation as the ‘Music of God’, and tells us that Saut-i-Saramad {Saute Samadi} is the intoxicating vintage from the Garden of God... for It is the overcome or manifestation of His power.
‘All space is filled with ‘Saute Sarmad’ of the ‘Abstract Sound’. The vibrations of this Sound are too fine to be either audible or visual to the material ears or eyes, since it is even difficult for the eyes to see the form and color of the ethereal vibrations on the external plane. It was the Saute Sarmad, the Sound of the abstract which Mohammed heard in the cave, Ghar-e-Hira, when he became lost in his ideal. The Koran refers to this Sound in the words: Be and all becamet (Kunfeu Kun). Moses heard this very Sound on Mount Sinai (Koh-i-Toor), when in communion with God. The same Word was audible to the Christ when absorbed in his Heavenly Father in the wilderness. Shiva heard the same Anahad Naad during his Samadhi in the Himalayas. The Flute of Krishna is symbolic of the same Sound allegorically explained. This Sound is the source of all revelation to the Masters to whom It is revealed from within and it is, therefore, that they know and teach the one and the same Truth.’
‘The knower of the mystery of the Sound knows the mystery of the whole Universe. Whosoever has followed the strains of this Sound has forgotten all early distinctions and differences: and has reached the same goal of Truth in which all the Blessed Ones of God unite. Space is within the body as well as around it: in other words the body is in space and space is in the body.’
‘This being the case, the Sound of the Abstract is always going on within, around and about man. Man does not hear It as a rule, because his consciousness is entirely centered in his material existence. Man becomes so absorbed in his experiences in the external world through the medium of the physical body that space with all its wonders of Light and Sound, appears to him blank. In comparison to It the sounds of the earth are like that of a whistle to a drum. When the Abstract Sound is audible, all other sounds become indistinct to the mystic.’ ”
, VOL. 1 BY GEORGE SINGLETON, ENLIGHTENMENT PUBLICATIONS, 2002 EDITION
236.



APPENDIX_I-D_3: ISLAMIC REFERENCES TO SPIRITUALITY SYSTEM
“ ‘The Sound of the Abstract is called Anhad in the Vedas, meaning unlimited sound. The Sufis name It Sarmad, which suggests the idea of intoxication. The word intoxication’ is here used to signify upliftment, the freedom of the soul from its earthly bondage. Those who are able to hear the Saute Sarmad and meditate on It are relieved from all worries, anxieties, fears and diseases: and the soul is freed from captivity in the senses and in the physical body. The soul of the listener becomes All-pervading Consciousness: and his spirit becomes the battery which keeps the whole Universe in motion.’
‘This Sound develops through ten different aspects because of Its manifestation through the different tubes of the body {Nadis}; it sounds like thunder, the roaring of the sea, the jingling of bells, running of water, the buzzing of bees, the twittering of sparrows, the Vina {flute}, the whistle, or the sound of Conch shells, shankha [bagpipes} until it finally becomes HU the most sacred of all sounds. This Sound HU is the beginning and end of all sounds be they from man, bird, beast or thing.’ " (from Kirpal Singh Ji’s Naam or Word, pgs. 139-140) (emphasis added)
NOTE:
Compare the “light and sound” stream HU terminology used by Ancient Egyptian
Mystery School of On (Annu) for example in Chapter 6, Scripture E Chapter 68 is identical to that of the later antecedent Sufi Muslims. Esoterically, a HU-man is an evolved homo sapien who has learned to listen to the “inner lighted sound stream” termed “HU” on the Third Spiritual Plane depicted in EXHIBIT III-E and originating and constantly emanted from the Most High God ANNU.
F. "From the above, it is abundantly clear that the inner spiritual experience of the Sound Current is within the reach of an individual provided there is a competent Master who is capabie of imparting his own life-impulse, and who can bring the consciousness in man to the inner eye and by unsealing the inner ear.”

APPENDIX_I-E_1: MAHAYANA BUDDHISM REFERENCES TO SPIRITUALITY SYSTEM
There are two major paths of Buddhism based on Shakyamuni Buddhas esoterically the 6th Buddha, commonly called “Gautama Siddhartha” teachings of 8th century B.C. India: the Hinayana “lesser vehicle”, of 18 to 20 schools of traditional monastic teachings which spread chiefly in Sri Lanka, Tibet, Burma, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and other parts of Southeast Asia: and the Mahayana "great vehicle”, the form of Buddhism which prevailed in China, Korea and Japan.
Mahayana Buddhism
A. The Mahayana Buddhist organization “Nichiran Shoshu of America (NAS)” is the leading Buddhistic organization in America. following the Latter Day 13th century AD. Buddhistic teachings by Nichiran Dashonin of Japan.
From NAS’ Seikyo Times, January 1987:
(1) Lotus Sutra:
Shakyamuni Buddha was the historical founder of Buddhism.. .and his...final {8 years of} teachings were crystallized in the form of the Lotus Sutra. The ultimate teaching clothe Lotus Sutra is that every single human being has the potential to attain Buddhahood, or in other terms, absolute happiness. It expounds that in every single human being there latently exists the state of Buddhahood “absolute happiness”. Samadhi (pg. 56)
(2) Mahayana:
One of the major streams of Buddhism. Dissatisfied with the monastic elitism of the {Hinayana} Buddhist schools that developed in India after the Buddha’s death, the adherents of Mahayana uphold the ideal of universal salvation and the way of the Bodhrsattva {See Sections A (6) and D}. They called their Buddhism Mahayana (‘great vehicle’), meaning the teaching which can lead all people to enlightenment, and criticized the earlier traditional schools for seeking only personal emancipation deriding them as Hinayana (lesser vehicle’) . . . The Mahayana sutras {scriptures teachings} are traditionally divided into two categories: provisional Mahayana, or those sutras expounded before the Lotus Sutra as preparatory teaching, and true Mahayana or the Lotus Sutra itself.” (pg. 42. Ibid.,)
(3) “During his lifetime in India, Shakyamuni {Buddha} foretold that for 2,OOO years {c. 800 B.C. to c. 1200 A.D.} after his death, all of his teachings would remain valid to help people reach enlightenment, but that after that time, his teachings would lose their power. He further indicated that at that time, known as the Latter Day of the Law (mapp), another Buddha would make his advent, enabling the salvation of all people throughout eternity, the Lotus Sutra’s promise of universal Buddahood will be realized.’

APPENDIX_I-E_2: MAHAYANA BUDDHISM REFERENCES TO SPIRITUALITY SYSTEM
‘And just as Shakyamuni prophesied at that time we find that in the Latter Day another Buddha by the name of Nichiran Dashonin made his appearance in this world {c. 1278 B.C.}.” (pg. 57, Ibid.,)
(4) ‘Distilling the essence of all Shakyamuni’s teachings, Nichiran Dashonin embodied his enlightenment to the Fundamental Law ~n the form of the Gohonzon. . the actual embodiment of the Law of the Universe itself.”
“He also taught the people of his time that one who chants daimoku {the words ~Nammyoho-renge-kyo’} and practices faith ~n the Gohonzon can attain the state of Buddhahood in this lifetime (pg. 57, IbId.,) (emphasis added}
(5) ‘The Universal Buddha nature can also be expiained as the fundamental Law of the Universe, which Nichiran Dashonin termed Nam-myoho-renge-kyo.”
‘The word Nan derives from Sanskrit and means devotion or dedicating oneself to something.
Myoho-renge-kyo is the title of the Lotus Sutra. as translated from Sanskrit into Chinese by Kumarajiva (Myoho-renge-kyo is actually {the} Japanese pronunciation of the Chinese characters, as Nichiran Dashonin pronounced them). ., a combination of Sanskrit and Chinese {a Japanese pronunciation}.” (pg. 58, Ibid.,)
The term ‘Lotus Sutra’ is also used to mean the highest teaching of a particular age; that teaching which leads directly to enlightenment. In the Latter Day of the Law, it indicates Nammyoho-renge-kyo of the Three Great Secret Laws.” (pg. 43, Ibid.,)
(6) “Bodhisattvas of the Earth: Innumerable Bodhisattvas who appear in the Yujutsu or fifteenth chapter of the Lotus Sutra and pledge to propagate the Mystic Law in the Latter Day. They alone were entrusted with this mission byShakyamuni Buddha.~ (pg. 421. Ibid,)
B. Esoterically the essence of Buddhism as with every divinely revealed social religion is the practice of light and sound yoga; the science of spirituaIity where knowledge of oneself and of the Most High are the goals. Transcendental seeing of the spiritual light current via the spiritual “3rd eye”, and transcendental hearing of the mystic sound current via the spiritual “3rd ear’ are common denominators of this ultimate religious practice. The Most High’s creative energy stream called the “Universal Law1’ by the Buddhist and the “ankh\annu khet” by the ancient Annu Egyptians is the source of these inner light and sound currents.

APPENDIX_I-E_3: MAHAYANA BUDDHISM REFERENCES TO SPIRITUALITY SYSTEM
C. “Extracts from The Path of Sudden Attainment by Hui Hail a scripture of Mahayana Buddhism translated by John Blofeld:
(1) ‘Nature of Perception: The faculty of perception is continuous so perception takes place whether objects are present or not. Thus we know it is the objects themselves that come and go and not the faculty of perception. It is the same with all the senses.’
(2) Nature of Hearing: It is not the question of whether there is sound or not. Because the faculty of hearing is continuous, so hearing takes place whether there is sound or not. It is the real nature of the ‘Self’ as knower that perceives and hears independently of the objects and sounds respectively and apart from the sense organs.’
(3) ‘Method of Enlightenment by sudden apprehension: Its purpose is to reach a state where thought is absent. Its scope lies in not allowing yourself to be moved by any form of allurement. Its nature is stillness and its activating agent is wisdom.’
(4) Wisdom: Four Kinds: {The last form of Wisdom is}.. the basis of all perception which produces the ‘Perfect All-reflecflng Buddha Wisdom. It is Absolute Void and Stillness. Perfect ad Unwavering Brilliance [Lights)”
(from Kirpal Singh Ji’s Naam or Word, pgs. 40-42) (emphasis and explanations added)

Honored Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas and great Arhats’ You have now been under my instruction for a long trme and have attained to perfect emancipation from the ‘body tomb.’
As an introduction to what I am about to say. I want to inquire of each of you as to how you attained Samadhi. When you began to realize in the early stages of your devotion and practice the falseness of the sense organs which one became thoroughly enlightened by means of which you attained to Samadhi Buddahood," ‘absolute happiness’).”

(11) “. .Then the Lord Tathagata {Shakyamuni Buddha} addressed Manjusri, Prince of the Dharma. saying:
Manjusri! you have now heard that these BodhisattvaMahasattvas of greatest and highest attainments have testified regarding the expedient means that were involved So we see that their devout practices, in spite of their variations, all eventuated in the same good result irrespective of their attainments and the times involved.
I want Ananda to fully understand and realize these different attainments of Enlightenment and note which of them is adapted to hrm. And I wish also.. .as future disciples of this world wish to allow hFghest Anuftara-Samyak-Sambodhi, that from these experiences they may know whFch door of expedient means appears to each most easily entered.”
(12) “. .Then Manjusri addressed the Lord Buddha, saying:
Blessed Lord( Since my Lord has descended. . .he has helped us most by his wonderful Enlightening Teaching. At first we receive this Teaching through our sense of hearing, but when we are fully able to realize its it becomes ours, through a Transcendental and Intuitive Hearing. This makes the awakening and perfecting of a Transcendental Faculty of Samadhi deepens in the mind of any disciple, he can most surely attain it by means of his Transcendental Organ of Hearing.”
.How sweetly mysterious is the Transcendental Sound of Avalokiteshvara! It is the pure Brahma Sound. It is the subdued murmur of the seaside setting inward. Its mysterious Sound brings liberalion and peace to all sentient beings who in their distress are calling for aid: it brings a sense of permanency to those who are truly seeking the attainment of Nirvana’s Peace ...”
.Ananda! Listen to me!... You have learned the Teachings by listening to the words of the Lord Buddha and then committing them to memory. Why do you not learn from your own self by listening to {the} Sound of the Intrinsic Dharma within your mind and then practicing reflection upon it? As soon as you have attained to this Supreme Purity of Mind-Essence, its Intrinsic Brightness {Light} will shine out spontaneously and in all directions.”
‘.. .All the Brothers in this Great Assembly, and you too, Ananda, should reverse your outward perception of hearing and listen inwardly for the perfectly unified and intrinsic sound of your own Mind-Essence for as soon as you have attained perfect accommodation, you will have attained to Supreme Enlightenment.”

“This is the only way to Nirvana, and it has been followed by all the Tathagatas {Buddhas) of the past, moreover, it is for all the BodhisattvaMahasattvas of the present and for all in the future if they are to hope for perfect Enlightenment. Not only did Avalokiteshvara attain perfect Enlightenment in long ages past by this Golden Way, but in the present, I also am one of them.’
‘My Lord inquired of us as to which expedient means each one of us had employed to follow this Noble Path to Nirvana. I bear testimony that the means employed by Avalokiteshvara is the most expedient means for all {See D (10) of this Section), since all other means must be supported and guided by the Lord Buddha’s Transcendental Powers. Though one forsake all his worldly engagements, yet he cannot always be practicing by these various means: they are especial means suitable for junior and senior disciples. ..‘
‘...but for lay men, this common method of concentrating the mind on the sense of hearing, turning it Onward by this Door of Dharma [“3rd ear”} to hear the Transcendental Sound of this Essential Rind, is most feasible and wise.”
(from Sant Kirpal Singh Ji’s Naam or Word, pgs. 43-63)
NOTE: That the spiritual hearing of the inner sound current\”Intrinsic Dharma”: the inner chant of the Most High God is deemed best for all aspirants, a recommended even for Bodhisattvas.
E. Esoterically the philology\etymology of the word “Nam” of the Spiritual Law of the Universe (Nam-myoho-renge-kyo) as formulated by Japanese Buddhist Master Nichiran Dashonin, reveals a two-fold nature and understanding of chants and sound.
“Nam: (Hindi) and Punjabi), Name; the Unspoken Name of Shabd: the Word; the Immortal Creator.
- Nam is of two kinds Varnatmak (that which can be expressed or uttered) and
Dhunatrak (that which can be heard only within {a person) as Nad or Shabd).
-The Varnatmak Nam acts as a pointer and leads to the real or Dhunatmak Nam within {a person}.
- {Dhunatmak Nam).....is not really a word, but a Power that emanates from the Supreme Being.
(from Sant Swami Ji’s Sar Barchan, pg. 188)

THE EGYPTIAN MYSTERY “SCHOOL OF ON”
APPENDIX_I-E_8: MAHAYANA BUDDHISM REFERENCES TO SPIRITUALITY SYSTEM
The esoteric philoIogy or etymology of the word ‘Shabd” which is a synonym of the word “Nam” is further revealing of this iwo fold nature of sound.
Shabd: (Sanskrit and Hindi), Sound: Spiritual Sound: the Word.
- As soul manifests in the body as consciousness. the word of God manifests itself as Inner Spiritual Sound.
- It is therefore synonymous with Sound Current within.
- It is the Word of the Bible {St. John} the Khalma .. of Islam; the Nad . . . of the Vedas; and is also called Nam, Ram Nam, Han Nam....
- There are Five Shabd within, the secret of which is imparted by a true Master.”
(from Sant Swami Ji’s Sar Barchan, pg. 197, Ibid.)
Thus the chanting of this “Mystic Lawu formulation of Nichiren Daishonin is of the highest level of Varnatmak Nam, the esoteric etymology of it can now be discerned remembering the derivation of "Moyoho-rengekyo,” presented herein. The Japanese pronunciation of the Chinese translation of the £Lotus Sutra,” the most important teaching of Shakyamuni. See A (5) of this Section. NAM-MYOHO-RENGE-KYO
“The Creative Word of the Lotus Sutra”
Meditation on ‘A 1, 4 & 5’ within will reveal that the “Creative Word” of Life Energy from the Most High the Ankh of ancient Egypt is that latent potential within all people to reach "Buddhahood”, Absolute Happiness Samadhi and in turn soul salvation: such occurs upon learning to spiritually hear this “Word.”
The spiritual ideal of chanting this “Mystic Law” formulation and contemplating the Gohonson which is a material symbol of this Mystic Law is to raise one toward perfection, and points toward the Dhunatmak Nam which exists within all awaiting to be heard. The outer chant of the disciples will lead the earnest disciples to the inner chant of the Most High ANNU.
NOTE: The key to the chant’s power is That the Lotus Sutra embodies
Buddha’s teachings of the light and sound yoga which the Ancient
Egyptian Mystery School of ON (Annu) called the Aten Path, the
only true salvation of the soul from the dilemma of life and death and the source of eternal happiness Nirvana.
"The earliest theory of salvation is the Egyptian theory. The Egyptian Mystery System had as its most important object, the deification of man, and taught that the soul of man if liberated from its bodily fetters, could enable him to become Godlike and see the Gods in this life and attain the beatific vision and hold communion with the Immortals.” (Anc. Mys. C.H. Vail, pg. 25)

APPENDIX II-A_1: Spirituality and Vegetarian Diet Requirement
I. The “Strict Dietary Rules” of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu), specifically requires aspirants to adhere to a vegetarian diet void of flesh including eggs, fish and fowl is deduced as follows using Greek students of the Mystery Schools as the medium to discern the truth:
a) The Egyptian Book of the Dead: Papyrus of Ani’s “Chapter 30 B” is considered part of the Hermetic Text Books of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu), wherein in the Dover ed. by E. Wallis Budge, pgs. 14 and 15. Rubic (instructions) to ‘Chapter 30 B,’ specifies that priests purified, one who hath not eaten animal (red) flesh or fish were required to teach, recite and administer to the specifications of this chapter, which would transform one into a God while alive, the great antiquity of Chapter 30 B is verified since it follows usually Chapter 64a (long version) which has a date of composition to the first dynasty reign of Pharaoh Gaga-Makheru\Hesepti\Senti.
b) Arnold Ehret’s Physical Fitness Through Superior Diet, Fasting and
Dietetics, pg. 15, discloses that Pythagoras “had to undergo a fast of 40 days, under supervision, outside of the city. Believing that this was a test of his will power and energy, he was totd thus: ‘Forty days’ Fast is necessary in order that you may grasp what we wilt teach you. By inference the city and school were at Annu, since the rival Theban Sorcery Lodges ate flesh.
c) George James’ Stolen Legacy, pgs. 43 and 132 refer to aspirant Pythagoras who attended various Egyptian priest colleges including the Annu Mystic Schools for a total of 22 years:
“...he learnt the doctrine of metempsychosis...that his knowledge of medicine and strict system of dietetic rules, distinguished him as a product of Egypt.”
“Metempsychosis” means ‘soul transmigration” into lower animals than man (Homo sapiens): why the ancient Egyptians then and Hindus now avoid eating cows, verified by Herodotus, BK. II. paragraph 41. Only bull calves were used for religious sacrifices, bulls and cows were allowed to die naturally. Also cows were held sacred for it was symbolic of the Solar Goddesses, Hathor and Ast. See Section H herein.
d) Consequently, in John Kellogg’s Natural Diet of Man, pg. 79 we are told
that “Pythagoras opposed flesh-eating most earnestly. . not only by voice and pen opposed the use of flesh food as unnatural and unphilosophical, but established a colony, Crotona, from which meat was excluded.”
Obviously he was taught this “strict dietary rule” as a student in the Ancient Egyptian
Mystery System of On (Annu).
e) Edward Szekely, Essene Gospel of Peace, Book IV presents Jesus Christ’s
esoteric teachings edited from the Bible by Roman Emperor Constantine’s Nicene Council : “Tell him always to eat of the table of our Earthly Mother, spread with her gifts: the fruits of the trees, the grasses of the fields, the milk of beasts good for eating and the honey of bees. He shall not invoke the power of Satan by eating the flesh of beasts, for he who kills, kills his brother, and whoso eats the flesh of slain beasts, eats the body of death. Tell him to prepare his food with the fire of life, not the fire of death, for the living angels of the living God serve only living men.”
Note that the preparing food with the “fire of light” refers to preparing food by the light of the sun through sprouting of seeds, nuts and grains; dehydration and solar ovens.

APPENDIX II-A_2: Spirituality and Vegetarian Diet Requirement (continued)
II. More definitive proof of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) student graduates called “Sun People” or Aakhu-Hammemet including its priest and priestess alumni’s vegetarian lifestyle is as follows:
“ . that the {Aakhu-Hammemet, ‘Sun People’} were believed to live upon grain {vegetables and fruits} is proved by the passage in a hymn to Amen-Ra wherein this God is said to be the ‘maker of the green herbs’ which giveth life to the beasts and cattle of the ‘plant of ife’ { }, Khet en Annu-Khet Hen, of the Hammemet in a Cairo Museum held papyrus, published in Ed. Grebaut, Section VJ.”
(from E. Wallis Budge’s Gods of the Egyptians, pg. 160 Vol 1)
III. “If we stopped to think about it, we would realize that the food we eat has an effect upon our physical, emotional and mental makeup. If we are trying to lead a life of nonviolence and compassion, if we are trying to become more serene and peaceful, if we are trying to control our mind and senses, then we will naturally want to follow a diet that helps us achieve our goal.
“Food can be categorized according to the effects it has upon humans. In India, three broad categories of diet have been given:
• Satvik foods {or pure foods} include vegetables, grains, beans, legumes, fruits and nuts, as well as milk, butter and cheese in moderation.
This diet produces serenity and equipoise, and it is said to keep the head and heart free from all types of impurities.
• Rajsic foods {or energizing foods} include pepper, spices, condiments, and sour and bitter things. Foods of this type produce restlessness.
• Tasmic foods {or stupefying foods} include stale foods, meat, fish, foul, eggs and alcoholic beverages. A tasmic diet produces inertia.
“Taking these factors into view, the saints and sages from time immemorial followed the Satvik diet because it is most helpful in leading.a pure life conducive to spiritual advancement.”
“If we examine various religious and mystic traditions, we find that they recommend or require vegetarianism.. Pythagoras a nd those who followed his school of thought were vegetarians. Many of the famous early philosophers such as Plato, Empedocles, Apollonius, Plutarch and Porphyry also followed the vegetarian diet.”
“Again, many of the early mystery religions, such as the.. . Orphics and the Essenes had vegetarianism as a prerequisite for initiation.”
“If we carefully study the Bible, we find that God had originally intended man to be a vegetarian.... After all, how can we claim to be lovers of God, lovers of its creation, if we kill the humbler members of God’s family?”
‘When the living Master or teacher {of a social religion} leaves the earth, the esoteric side of his teachings is often lost or obscured in the rites and rituals which are created.

APPENDIX II-A_3: Spirituality and Vegetarian Diet Requirement (continued)
Similarly, after the Master leaves, changes are made and relaxations in diet and discipline are allowed by those who want to popularize the religion or make it more acceptable to a larger number of people. But the mystic tradition is clear in advocating vegetarianism.”
(from Sant Darshan Singh Ji’s Spiritual Awakening, pgs. 149 and 151)
IV. “According to Professor Price, of the University of Chicago, one of the world’s greatest authorities in the languages of antiquity, the ancient Sumerians, the people who lived 2,000 years before the time of Abraham {circa 4,000 B.C.}, ate little meat and never took the life of animals or partook of flesh foods except in connection with religious rites and ceremonies.”
(from John Kellogg’s The Natural Diet of Man, pg. 84) (emphasis added)
V. "Quoting from the Encyclopedia Britannica on the Essene(s) {Hebrews/Jews}:
“According to Clement of Alexandria (200 A.D.) the Essenes were strict abstainers from flesh foods.”
“As a result of the ascetic training of the Essenes, and their temperate diet, it is said that they lived to a great age, and were superior to pain and fear.”
“... they had in many respects reached the highest moral elevatron attained by the ancient world, they were just, humane, benevolent and spiritually-minded; the sick and the aged were the objects of a special affectionate regard: they condemned slavery . . as an impious violation of natural brotherhood of man.”
“Josephus say that the Essenes lived the same kind of life as did the Pythagoreans .. .. .they entirely addicts themselves to husbandry... they are long lived also insomuch than many of them live above a hundred years!”
(from John Kellogg’s, Ibid., pg. 77) (emphasis added)
VI. “Dean Stanley points out certain evidence that St. John was an adherent of the Essenian philosophy.... ‘Thus from the above St. John by inference was a vegetarian too.”
“The Homilies of Clement, according to Howard Williams”... assure us ‘that St. Matthew ‘lived upon seeds and hard shell fruits and other vegetables, without touching flesh.”
“The Homilies of Clement, according to Howard Williams, represent St. Peter as a strict flesh-abstainer, living upon bread and olives only, with the addition rarely of kitchen herbs. This information it is claimed was given by St. Peter himself to Clement of Rome.”
“Eusebius state that St. James never ate any animal food.”
“According to St. Augustine, he lived upon seeds and vegetables, never tasting flesh or wine.’
(from John Kellogg’s, Ibid., pg. 77)
NOTE: St. James is St. James the Just, Jesus Christ’s brother and known Essene Nazarite.

VI. Refer to Appendix Vll-3;, Questions\Answers #9, #10, #11 and Appendix Vll-3;, Questions\Answers #15 and #16 on the subject of diet and spirituality.
VII. According to the Herodotus, Book II, paragraph 41, the ancient Egyptians avoided eating cows holding them sacred to the solar goddesses. See Exhibit II_B-4. The Theban priests were only being able to sacrifice bull calves specially selected.
According to early Christian historian Porphyry (as reported in John Kellogg’s The Natural Diet of Man, pg. 76) the priests were the ones responsible for killing animals for sacrifice and eating the sacrifice as a sorcery practice of absorbing its powers. This slowly spread to the populace not adhering to the “spirituality” path.
VIII. “Every child must be taught the use of flesh before he becomes a flesh eater. Raw flesh, the diet of carnivorous animals, is as repugnant to a man who has not acquired the taste as to an orangutan or a chimpanzee.
A two-year-old child will seize a peach or a plum and eat it at once, without being influenced by persuasion or example; but no amount of persuasion could induce an intelligent two-year-old child to catch a grasshopper, a mouse, or a butterfly, or to eat a bit of raw meat.”
The extreme dislike which some adults and most infants exhibit toward flesh food of any sort is attributed by Fitch to an ‘atavistic tendency’, that is, the survival of the primitive human instinct.”
(from John Kellogg’s The NaturaI Diet of Man, pg. 14) (emphasis added)

APPENDIX II-B_1: The Cause and Prevention of Disease -Diet and Livelihood
I. “Among the Egyptians themselves, those who dwell in the cultivated country are the most careful of all men to preserve the memory of the past, and none whom have questioned have so many chronicles.”
“For fhree following days in every monfh they purge themselves, pursuing after healfh by means of washing their lower intestines with an enema bag; for they think if is from the food which fhey eat that all sicknesses come to men.”
(adapted from the English and source Greek of Herodotus Book II, paragraph 77 in Godley ed. pg. 363) (emphasis added)
NOTE: That in the 5th Century B.C. traditional Egyptians took enemas three times a month to remove food waste.
“High enemas {2 quart bags used for two successive enemas} have proved of immense benefit. The objection to enemas usually comes from those who need them most but are not sufficiently informed on the subject of nutritional and eliminative physiology. Ihefear that they are habit-forming is based on lack of knowledge. Cleanliness -whether internal or external -is never harmful.”
(from N.W. Walker, Raw Vegetable Juices, pgs. 144 and 145)
II. “I hold that the diet and food which people in health now would not have been discovered, provided it had suited with man to eat and drink in like manners as the ox, the horse, and all other animals, except man, do of the productions of earth, such as fruits, weeds, and grass: for from such things these animals grow, live free of diseases, and require no other kind of food.”
“And, at first, I am of opinion that man used the same sort of food .that the present articles of diet {‘civilized diet’) had been discovered and invented only after a long lapse of time...”
“...for when they suffered much and severely from this strong and brutish {‘civilized’} diet, swallowing things which were raw, unmixed, and possessing great strength, they became exposed to strong pain and diseases, and to early death.”
(from Hippocrates “On Ancient Medicine,” extracted from Great Book Western World Vol 10) (emphasis added)
These quotes are by # 6 Hippocrates who was in a line of herbal masters:
“{Hippocrates}. as stated: ‘The more you feed the sick, the more you harm him.’ Also: Your foods shall be your remedies’ and your ‘remedies shall be your foods.’ His first statement proves clearly that he was an advocate of fasting and restrictions {vegetarian} diet, especially in case of an acute disease.”
NOTE: The first Hippocrates was Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On
(Annu) trained and was essentially a herbalist, never using drug, in the holistic sense using medicinal and nutritional herbs.

APPENDIX III: The Cause and Prevention of Disease -Diet and Livelihood (continued)
His second statement (suggestion) embraces. . the amount of nutrient contained in a food is not the decisive point, but rather the elminating quality determines to what extent it is a remedy according to Hippocrates."
(from Arnold Ehret’s Physical Fitness Through Superior Diet, Fasting and Dietetics, pgs. 7 and 9)
III. "Beelzebub, the prince of all devils, the source of every evil, lies in a wait in the body of all the Sons of Men. He is death, the ‘Lord of every plague’, and taking upon him a pleasing raiment, he tempts, and entices the Sons of Men. Riches do he promise, and power, and splendid palaces, and garments of gold and silver, and a multitude of servants, all these; he promises renown and glory, fornication and lustfulness, gluttony and wine bibling, riotous living, and slothfulness and idle days.
And he entices everyone by that to which their heart is most inclined. And in the day that the Sons of Men have already become the slaves of all these vanities and abominations, then in payment thereof he snatches from the Sons of Men all those things which the Earthly Mother gave them so abundantly. He takes from them their breath, their blood, their bone, their flesh, their bowe’s, their eyes and their ears.... And last of all shall the erring Sons of Man lose life. For he kept no the laws of his Mother, and added sin to sin.”
(from the Essene Gospel of Peace, Book I. pg. 11, translated by Edmund Szekeley)
NOTE: The above is from the teachings of Christian nutrition and sickness prevention, taken out of the Catholic Nicene Council from the Bible, “refound” in 1930 in the Pope’s Vatican Library by Edmund Szekeley, then a Jesuit student.
The holistic term of proper diet taught by the Saints is here expressed, proper livelihood and proper vegetarian diet is conducive to proper health.

APPENDIX II-C_1: The Essene Gospel of Peace Book IV: Teachings of the Elect – Excerpts
The Original Hebrew and Aramaic Texts was translated and edited by Edmond B. Szekeley (1981, International Biogenic Society, British Columbia, Canada).
[ FROM THE PREFACE:
“It was in 1928 that Edmond B. Szekeley first published his translation of Book One of The Essene Gospel of Peace, an ancient manuscript he had found in Secret Archives of the Vatican as the result of limitless patience, faultless scholarship, and unerring intuition ........ The English version of the ancient manuscript appeared in 1937 ...... It was not until almost fifty years that the first French translation that Book Two and Book Three appeared ......Book Four, The Teachings of the Elect ( appeared two years after Edmond Szekely’s death in 1982).......This Book Four, The Teachings of the Elect, represents yet another fragment of the complete manuscript which exists in Aramaic in the Secret Archives of the Vatican and in old Slavonic in the Royal Library of the Habsburgs (now the property of the Austrian government).“]
“Three are the dwellings of the Son of Man, and no one may come before the face of God who knows not the angel of Peace in each of the three. These are his body, his thoughts, and his feelings. When the angel of Wisdom guides his thoughts, when the angel of Love purifies his feelings, and when the deeds of his body reflect both love and wisdom, then does the angel of Peace guide him unfailingly to the throne of his Heavenly Father. And he should pray without ceasing that the power of Satan with all his diseases and uncleannesses may be cast out of all of his three dwellings; that Power and Wisdom and Love may reign in his body, his thoughts. and his feelings.”
“First shall the Son of Man seek peace with his own body; for his body is as a mountain pond that reflects the sun when it is still and clear; but when it is full of mud and stones, it reflects nothing. First must Satan be cast out of the body, that the angels of God may enter again and dwell therein. Truly, no peace can reign in the body unless it is as a temple of the Holy Law. Therefore, when he who suffers with pains and grievous plagues asks for your help, tell him to renew himself with fasting and with prayer. Tell him to invoke the angel of sun, the angel of water, and the angel of air, that they may enter his body and cast out of it the power of Satan. Show him the baptism within, and the baptism without. Tell him always to eat of the table of our Earthly Mother, spread with her gifts: the fruits of the trees, the grasses of the fields, the milk of beasts good for eating and the honey of bees. He shall not invoke the power of Satan by eating the flesh of beasts, for he who kills, kills his brother, and whoso eats the flesh of slain beasts, eats the body of death. Tell him to prepare his food with the fire of life, not the fire of death, for the living angels of the living God serve only living men.”
“And though he sees them not, and hears them not, and touches them not, still is he every moment surrounded by the power of God’s angels. While his eyes and ears are closed by ignorance of the Law and thirst for the pleasures of Satan, he will not see them, nor hear them, nor touch them. But when he fasts and prays to the living God to cast out all the diseases and uncleannesses of Satan, then will his eyes and ears be opened, and he will find peace.”
“For not only he suffers who harbors the diseases of Satan within him, but his mother, his father, his wife, his children, his companions, these suffer also, for no man is an island unto himself, and the powers that flow through him, whether they be of the angels or of Satan, truly these powers do unto others for good or for evil.”
“After this manner, therefore, pray to your Heavenly Father, when the sun is high at midday: ‘Our Father who art in heaven, send to all the Sons of Men your angel of Peace; and send to our body the angel of Life to dwell therein for ever.’ ”

NOTE:
a There are 2 Cush lines of ‘Kush’ of Africin Southern Sudan\Blue Nile and Cush of Northern Mesopotamia.
b. There are 2 parts of Mesopotamia of the North including Mitanni/Neharian and Assyria theantecedent to the North African Moors; and Mesopotamia of the South of Babylon, Ur of Chaldea from whence came Abraham the antecedant of the Hebrew and Arab peoples.
c. There are offspring with “anu” syllables In their names Mittani and Cannan
d. Sheba and Havila are identified again as offspring.
e. No “Phut” geneology is presented by the Bible continuing the mystery coverup of its peoples’ location contiguous to Ta Neter, the ‘Land of the Gods’ and home of the ancestors of the Ancient Egyptians. Esoterically, Biblical Phut is the Punt of Ancient Egypt/Kemit or modern day Eritria. The Queen Hatshepsut Expedition to Punt crosed over Punt and Sheba modern day Ethiopia to reach Khenthunnefer of the Nile Great Lakes and thus birthplace of the black African Anu Peoples. See Exhibits IV-A through IV-G and Chapter Two Section F herein.
f. Seba, Havillah, Sabtah, Raamah are related the Theban people Invaders whose entrance to the Nile Valley touched off a war with the Anu Sethet; i.e. Horus vs Seth endlng with the Dynastic Age.
g. Thus attempts to unit the term Cush to non-negrold peoples fails for Black African Anu Peoples are positively identified esoterically in Genisis 10: 28, 29 and 23: 3 as the “Nine 9 Bow Tribes” 2, 4, 6 and 8.
h. The demonic cannabal Scyhtians or Nagog/Gog of the Bible are esoterically related to the earlier Neanderthal cannabl barbarians who disappeared around 100,000 BC; who lived around the Crimea Peninsula of the Black Sea area of today’s Ukraine. The nemesis of the balck African Anu Proples of Ancient Egypt/Kemit they continued to raid directly and invade it over 10,000 years until it destroyed ii via its spin-off nations of Persia, Macedonia and Rome.
The Scythian (white) race of Europe\Asia culture was the Bible Genesis “snake” culture of the Garden of Eden (Aten), also called Magog and Gog with its pastoral animal herding, paternalistic and female exploitative societal practices, exemplified in the cities of Sodom and Gomorrhea; with alcohol-based sorcery sexual orgy religious practices carried out by a bi-sexual priesthood and prostitute-based priestesses bent on the total exploitation of the earth and annihilation of the original lifestyle of humans and their sustainable gardening environment of prosperity."
Esoterically the Hamities and Theban Invader peoples into Ancient Egypt as well as the Hyksos and related spin off Hebrew peoples and Babylonia were mixed blood Scythian related people. The Scythians “disappeared” melding into the Roman Republic in the 8 th Century BC and then later along with Macedonia’s King Alexander the Great armies which conquered Persia and Ancient Egypt/Kemit in the 4 th Century BC.
The identity of the Ancient Egyptian “invader races” including the dark-red complexioned “Dynastic Race”, the “Hyksos”, The Habesha or Hamites, the Semites, etc. as mixtures of with Dravidians of jet black complexion of India\Pakistan and blacks of Africa; is covered up but absolutely necessary to the understanding of what happened to the ancient culture of Annu Egypt/Kemit and its core of 4 black Afican Anu Peoples the aNubia, Kush, Meroe and Antiu Anu .

APPENDIX IV_1: Sabaeans\Sumerians and Origin of Islam and Abraham
A. “Abraham’s origins are linked to Ur {the form ‘Ur of the Chaldees” (Bible, Genesis 11:31) is esoterically Hur, the Sumerians’ more succinctly the Shemerions’ of Semitic, mixed blood origin. Ur is well known as an important center in the land of Sumer; it reached its zenith under the Kings of the third dynasty of Ur, who around 2060-1950 B.C. revived for the last time the ancient cultural traditions of the Sumerians {Sabaeans}. The names of several of Abraham’s relatives are a’so the names of known cities. All these are places around the river Balih in nodhern Mesopotamia.”
(from MacMillan’s Bible Atlas, text to Map #25) (emphasis added)
NOTE: The connection with ‘Northern Mesopotamia” Nine Bow Tribe #3 Mitanni\Neherna alias Assyria, home of Annu Egyptians and Queens Mutemuaa, Tiy and Nefertiti. Moses’ Exodus destination.
B. Refer to Appendix II-A on the virtual vegetarian diet of the ancient Sumerians (Sabaean) people.
C. Sabaeans and Sumerians are the lshmaelite and Jewish ancestors (‘Nine Bow Tribes #3 and #9. See Exhibit IV_2 respectively. “.. . occupying in turn North and South Mesopotamia . . . confused by the ‘experts.” The Sabaeans are mentioned three times in the Quran (2:62, 5:69, 22:17) together with Jews, Christians and Muslims as People of the Book. Considerable confusion and controversy have surrounded the ancient Sabaean religion. Baha’ulIah spoke of two types of Sabaeans (Sabin).
The first includes those people who were followers of John the Baptist but who refused to accept the Prophethood of Jesus Christ. Today this group, called Mandaens, is centered in southern Iraq... (‘Mandaen means Gnostic’).
The second types of Sabaeans are the remnants of an ancient independent, but Divinely revealed Faith. It is the Divinely revealed Sabaean Faith that was prevalent in Ur of Chaldea {Sumeria} during the time of Abraham, and it is probable that Abraham was originally a follower of the true Sabaean Faith.
The name of the Revelator of the ancient Sabaean Faith is unknown to us, but the remnants.of the Faith are the idolaters of Africa (see Genesis 10:17, 25:3) . . . revelators possible Adam, Noah or Eunuch.”
(from Riggs’ Apocalypse Unveiled, pgs. 50 and 284) (emphasis added)
D. It appears the Asia invaders from Europe the Cimmerians described in Herodotus Book I, paragraphs 15, 16, 17, 18 and 103 and BK. II, can be connected to the Sumerians of Lower Mesopotamia. Herodotus’ account has been corrupted, but they match the culture and Semitic (mixed race) facts properly. Thus, from the shores of the Euxine\Black Sea approximately 3,000 B.C. to 2,500 B.C. the Cimmerians\Sumerians invaded Asia Minor finally settling in the then Sabaean Southern Mesopotamia. They adopted Sabaean culture and intermarried producing a “Semitic” part Black-White person. They in turn were conquered and assimilated by other invaders continuing the Semitic mixed race pattern.

APPENDIX IV_2: Sabaeans\Sumerians and Origin of Islam and Abraham (continued)
E. The {Sabaean\Sumerians} religion seemed to emanate directly from the. . {Assyrian} cult. It would remain the same until the advent of Islam. The Sabaean gods were just about the same as the Babylonian gods and all belonged to the same Cushite family of Egyptian and Phoenician deities.... The only Triad revered was: Venus - Sun Mercury, as in Babylon.
The cult had a pronounced sidereal character, especially solar, they prayed to
the sun at different phases of its course.
There was neither idolatry; nor images, nor priesthood.”
‘They addressed a direct invocation to the seven planets. The 30-day fasting period already existed, as in Egypt. They prayed seven times each day, with their faces turned toward the north. These prayers to the sun at different hours somewhat resemble Moslem prayers which take place during the same phases, but which have been reduced by the Prophet {Mohammed} to five compulsory prayers ‘to relieve humanity’: the other two prayers are optional.”
‘There were also sacred springs and stones, as Moslem times: Zenzen a sacred spring; Kaaba, a sacred stone. The pilgrimage to Mecca already existed. The Kaaba was reputed to have been constructed by Ishmael, son of Abraham and Hagar the Egyptian (a Negro woman), a hFstorical ancestor of Mohammed, according to all Arab historians.
As in Egypt, belief in a future life was already prevalent. Dead ancestors were deified.
Thus all the elements necessary for the blossoming of Islam were in place more than 1,000 years before the birth of Mohammed {who died in 632 A.D.} Islam would appear as a purification of Sabaenism {the religion of the ancient Sumerian people of Mesopotamia.}”

APPENDIX V_1: Pharaoh Akhenaten (Ikhnaton) Esoteric Identity as the Biblical Exodus Moses and King Sargon I of Assyria
A. Pharaoh Akhunaten as the Biblical Moses.
The 18 the Dynasty Ancient Egypt/Kemit Pharaoh and ”Aten Path” Master Akhunaten (Akhenaen/Ikhnaton) and so-called Jewish Biblical leader of the Exodus from Egypt o Israel Moses can be connected not only as peers as Sigmund Freud cautiously did in 1933 in his series of essays now known as Moses and Monotheism, but can be
identified as the same person as Biblical Scholar and Egyptologist Ahmad Osman did in 1990 in his Moses and Akhunaten.
However, this author first identified this esoteric Akhunaten and Moses identity in 1986 based on the following esoteric evidence summarized below:
1. Egyptologists generally set the birth year of Pharaoh Akhunaten at 1404 B.C., and some like Bunsen the birth year of Moses at 1392 B.C. ___ only a 12 year difference.
2. Both Pharaoh Akhunaten and Moses attended the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu or Heliopolis) cited in the Bible as having trained Joseph.
a. “We are told not only by the Bible, but also by the historian Phil that Moses an Initiate of the Egyptian Mysteries, also became a Hierogrammat {3rd degree Annu Mystery School priest}; learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptian people.”
(from George James Stolen Legacy, pg. 67)
“Moses was indebted for this knowledge to the mother of the Egyptian princess, Thermuthis, who saved him from the waters of the Nile. The wife of Pharaoh, Batria, was an initiate herself.”
(footnote Devita et Morte Mosis, Phil Jadaeus, pg. 199) (Madame Blavatsky. isis Unveiled I, pg. 25)
“Manetho {the Egyptian High Priest historian of Egypt circa 240 B.C.} says he {Moses} was a hierophant of Hieropolis, and a priest of the Sun-God Osiris, and that his name was Osarsiph.” {lbid., pg. 555}
b. Aakhunaten as “Aten Path” High Priest and then Master\Pharaoh undoubtedly attended Annu’s Mystery School, a disciple of the “Aten Path” Master Amenophis, son of the Hapi who was his father’s (Pharaoh Amenophis Ill) and his advisor and Master.
3. “. . . there might have been a religious link between them {Moses and Akhenaton} . . . . That such a link existed is implicit in the statement by.Manetho,. .who atternpted to write a coherent account of the religious schism of Aakhunaten. But halfway through he confused it with a narrative relating to Moses {alias Osarsiph} and the last Hyksos wars . . . . Both (allowing Moses to have been a Hyksos prince) were heirs to the throne of Egypt. Both were, in their several ways, monotheists, and both . . . most likely were priests of Heliopolis Annu Mystery School.”
(from J. Colliers Heretic Pharaoh) (emphasis added)
a. Please note that Egyptian High Priest Manetho’s History of Egypt circa 245 B.C. is the key to the esoteric identity of Pharaoh Akhunaten as Moses. It must
be understood that Manetho wrote his history from the oldest, indelibIe
historical records of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu)
itself now missing and destroyed, under orders of the invader Ptolemy Greeks dominated by the Theban priesthood.

258.



APPENDIX V_2: Pharaoh Akhenaten (Ikhnaton) Esoteric Identity as the Biblical Exodus Moses and King Sargon 1 of Assyria (continued)
This priesthood’s political, religious, and economic policy is to coverup this Akhunaten\Moses identity, by confusing the facts with the Jewish (Theban priesthood dominated) peoples’ originating mythology as a distinct non-Egyptian race which once ruled Egypt as the mysterious “Hyksos" Shepherd Kings.
In short Manetho’s had constraints on what he could say, and what he wrote has been totally destroyed except for:
- a few quotes of his History of Egypt in Jewish Josephus’ work Contra Apionem I circa 220 AD., whose goal is to use it to prove the Jewish people are a nonEgyptian thus non-black race and as stated above the once powerful ‘Hyksos” who controlled Egypt from 200 to 511 years, and
- a separate list of the dynasties of Egypt with brief notes on their specific Kings and outstanding facts chronologically his Chronology.
With Egyptian High Priest access to the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) historical records, in no way could Manetho be confused or mistaken except by:
- being censored or commanded by superiors,
- Jewish historian Josephus Flavius corruption of his quotes and paraphrases of Manethos History of Eçypt,
- Greek or later Roman Catholic Church corrupflon of Manethos Chronology of dynasties and kings, and
- intentional "mistakes” which esoterically reveal the censored truth upon proper analysis and synthesis via comparative historical techniques.
b. Keeping this in mind two relevant points in Manetho’s Chronology must be brought forward and are presented below.
Point 1: Speaking about the 15th, 16th and 17th Dynasties of Egypt wherein from about 1700 to 1580 B.C. conventionally, esoterically 2,533 to 1580 B.C. the mysterious ‘tHyksos”\ Shepherd Kings controlled Egypt; Manetho clears up their identity as follows:
“{They}... consisted of Shepherd Kings. There were six foreign Kings from Phoenicia, who seized Memphis: in the Sethroite name they founded a town {Avaris on the east of the Bubastite branch of the Nile quoting Josephus Contra Apionem I, paragraph 78}"
(from Manetho, Aegyptiaca (Epitome) Fr. 43. from Syncelles\ Africanus)
Thus the six Phoenician cities on the Mediterranean coast of Asia Minor\Palestine\Canaan including Sidon, Tyre, Beirut, Gubla (Byblos), Sumur (Simyra) and Acco (Acre) were the leaders of a confederacy.
These six city Kings hired the surrounding Palestine\Syrian nomadic shepherd herders - Semitic (mixed white, black) peoples largely of Amurru\Retenu tribes of Hew Shasu. See Exhibit IV-2, Nine Bow Tribe #9. These shepherds clearly included the Hebrews or Khiburu shepherd nomads as mercenaries of these rich Phoenician Kings. See Exhibit IV-2, Nine Bow Tribe #5, Keft.

APPENDIX V_3: Pharaoh Akhenaten (Ikhnaton) Esoteric Identity as Moses and King Sargon 1 of Assyria (continued)
Point 2. In his description of the 18th Dynasty to which Pharaoh Akhunaten belonged to circa 1576 - 1317 B.C., his Chronology variants of Eusebius (Ibid.. Fr. 53a of Syncellus, 53b Armenian) list the following 14 Kings corrected by the monuments:

Akhunaten 1376 to 1361.B.C. - co-regent (Amenhotep IV) 1361 to 1345 B.C. - sole ruler (.) _ _ _ _ 11. Smenkhkare 1348 to 1345 B.C. -co-regent (Omitted, corrected) 10. Acherres - 8 years 12. Tutankhamon 1345 to 1337 B.C. 11. Cherres - 15 years 13.. Ay 1337 to 1322 B.C. 12. Armais - 5 years 14. Horemheb 1322 to 1317 B.C. (Danaus) - (faIsified his reign beginning with Aakhunaten's co-regency to 59 years, corrected by historians to 30 years) 13. Ramesses - 66 years (belongs to 19 th Dynasty, which is short a King In Manethos variants) (AegyptIus) 14. Amenophis - 40 years (in fact #9 Amenhotep III) _____________________________________________________________________________
The corrections via monuments and comparative history result in Manetho’s stated 14 Kings, where his #13 Pharaoh belongs to the 19th Dynasty and #14 is part of the myth of Danaus and Aegyptius placed in as part of an intentional confusion to conceal the “Akhunaten is Moses” identity... .. for esoteric identity later in time.
Specifically only 2 of the 4 Amenhotep Kings were acknowledged truthfully by the Theban Priesthood (Amenhotep I and II), Manetho’s #8 Pharaoh Orus is esotericalIy Amenhotep II (Aakhunaten’s father); while Manetho’s #9 Pharaoh Achencherses is esoterically Pharaoh Amenhotep IV. This Pharaoh in question here changed his name to Akhunaten, rejecting Amen as the national god and moving to curtail the powerful but corrupt Theban Amen-Ra/Osiris Cult priests as the national theocratic leaders.
4. ". . .I venture now to draw the following conclusions: if Moses was an Egyptian and if he transmitted to the Jews his own religion, then it was that of lkhnaton, the Aton religion.” (Sigmund Freud, Ibid., pg. 27)
“A strange fact in the history of the Egyptian religion, which was recognized and appraised relatively late. It is. possible that the religion Moses gave to his Jewish people were yet his own, an Egyptian religion [the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) “Aten Path’] though not the {more popular Theban priesthood’s Amen-Ra\Osiris cults} Egyptian religion.” (Sigmund Freud, Ibid., pg. 21) [explanation added]

APPENDIX V_4: Pharaoh Akhenaten (Ikhnaton) Esoteric Identity as Moses and King Sargon I of Assyria (continued)
5. We can now analyze the previously mentioned “confused’ account of
Manetho’s History of Egypt from Josephus’ Contra ADionem I. 26.
It is “confused” only if we think that the Amenophis\Amenhotep mentioned is Manethos #14 listed Pharaoh and get caught up in a myth involving his #12 and #13 Kings putting the time span far too late to glean the truth. However we know this myth of Danaus and Aegyptius is from the 12th Dynasty, for Herodotus Book II paragraph 102 and 107 mentions this myth as occurring during the reign of Pharaoh Sesostris Ill. Esoterically, the Pharaoh Amenophis\Amenhotep mentioned is Pharaoh Amenhotep IV\Akhenaten or Manetho’s #9 Pharaoh Achencherses while co-regent with his father Pharaoh Amenhotep Ill.
”....Manetho now interpolates this intruding Amenophis (Amenhotep IV). This King, he states, conceived a desire to behold the gods, as Or*, one of his predecessors on the throne, had done.” (the account of Manetho’s History of Egypt from Josephus’ Contra ADionem I. 2).
*NOTE: Esoterically King or Pharaoh Or can be identified as Pharaoh Akhenaton while he was co-regent with his father Pharaoh Amenhotep III. Ironically Pharaoh Amenhotep III is Manetho’s #8 Pharaoh Orus.
“....and he communicated his desire to this namesake Amenophis, Paaphis’ son Amenhotep, son of Hapu, Minister\Master of both Amenhotep lll\IV who, in virtue of his wisdom and knowledge of the future, was reputed to be a partaker in the divine nature.” (the account of Manetho’s History of Egypt from Josephus’ Contra ADionem I. 2).
a. Specifically what does becoming a spectator of the gods’ mean? Did Amenhotep IV truly then seek spiritual enlightenment from his minister in co-regency? Amenhotep IV\Amenhotep Ill’s co-regency was the period approximately 1378- 1367 B.C. when they tried to work with the Amen priesthood in the then capital Thebes.
Luckily George James’ classic Stolen Legacy elucidates that the “Egyptian Mystery System had as its most important object the deification of man.....{that} could enable him to become godlike and see the Gods in this life and attain the beatific vision and hold communion with the Immortals.” (George James, Stolen Legacy, pg. 27) (emphasis added)
See Illustrations O-4 and O-4 - Pharaoh and “Aten Path’ Master Akhunaten as “Sphinx”\HU. This was obviously the esoteric desire of Pharaoh Amenhotep IV, and as “Aten Path’t Master; Amenhotep, son of Hapu was uniquely qualified to guide the Pharaoh.
“{MinisterAmenhotep,son of Hapu} then, replied that he would be able to see the gods if he cleansed the whole land of lepers and other polluted person.”
“The King was delighted and assembled all those in Egypt whose bodies were wasted by disease: they numbered 80,000 persons. These he cast into the stone-quarries to the east of the Nile, there to work segregated from the rest of the Egyptians. Among them, Manetho, adds, there were some of the learned priests, who had been attacked by leprosy.’ (the account of Manetho’s History of Egypt from Josephus’ Contra Adionem I. 2, paragraph #234 and 235).



APPENDIX V_5: Pharaoh Akhenaten (Ikhnaton) Esoteric Identity as the Biblical Exodus Moses and King Sargon I of Assyria (continued)
b. Quoting again from Joy Collier The Heretic Pharaoh, pg. 234) for clarification of Lysimachus, the Greek historian, an alternative version of this account is presented:
“The King of Egypt sent some to consult the oracle of Hammon [Amen] the gods answer was this, that he must purge his temples of impure and impious men by expelling them out of those temples . . . the sun having indignation at these men being suffered to live.’’
Thus Pharaoh Akhunaten raised the ‘Aten Path’ as the national religion again, and reinvigorating anew an Aten Path practicing national theocratic priesthood. Here Lysimachus establishes without doubt that the people to be expelled suffered in the eyes of the “establishment” of Thebes from spiritual not physical defects.
In addition Joy Collier The Heretic Pharaoh, pg. 234 presents an alternative version of Lysimachus that identifies the Theban Sorcery Lodges and its Amen-Osiris Priesthood as the source of this spiritual leprosy for ”he {Pharaoh Amenophis IV} must purge his {Amens} temples of impure and impious men {priests} by expelling them out of those {Amen} temples..... the sun gods {of Annu\Heliopolis, generically Ra} having an indignation at these men {Amen priests} being suffered to live.”
This alternative Lysimachus version makes total sense via comparative history. For we know that before and after their ascendancy to national dominance via the conquests and support of Thuthmoses Ill, that the Amen Priesthood was corrupt e.g., printing blank name space copies of the Book of the Dead promising spiritual salvation and practicing sorcery e.g., spiritualism communication with the dead via séances, misuse of spiritism and exploitative use use of hypnosis and mesmerism.
A clear pattern of Theban priesthood using historical censorship can be seen in its historical treatment of their arch theocratic rival the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) 18 th Dynasty graduates Pharaoh-Queen Hatshepsut and Pharaoh Thutmose IV. Thus it can be better appreciated that Pharaoh-Queen Hatshepsut placed Aten Path symbols of the Obelisks in the Amen Temple at Thebes and commissioned a Punt Expedition to Ta-Neter. Thus it can be better appreciated that Pharaoh Thuthmose IV married a Mitanni princess Mutemuaaenra, esoterically an Aten Path practitioner; and he renovated the Annu Sphinx/HU Rock Sculpture and Temples at the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) at the Giza Rock Plateau Complex. Consequently, as shown above Pharaoh-Queen Hatshepsut was completely left out of Manethos’ Pharaoh list; while Pharaoh Thutmose IV was placed out of order on the Kings’ Lists by the rival Amen-Osiris Priesthood to further confuse true history and their contributions to the Science of Spirituality system of the Aten Path.
Esoterically, it must be understood that Amenhotep IIl and his son Akhenaten (Amenhotep IV) as Aten High Priest as his co-regent, with Master Thet of the “Aten Path” Amenhotep, son of Hapu as his advisor and also the Aten Path practitioners Mitanni Queens Tiy and Nefertiti; were organized and set for a “show down” with the corrupt
Theban Sorcery Lodges. Its demonic practicing Amen-Osiris Priesthood suffered from a “spiritual leprosy.” Esoterically they enjoyed unprecedented power via Pharaoh
Thutmose Ill’s imperialistic reig, who supported the Amen-Osiris Priesthood after receiving its aid in the unnatural takeover and disposal of Pharaoh-Queen Hatshepsut.
Under Pharaoh and Aten Path Master Akhunaten as sole ruler and his Aten Path practicing Queen Nefertit the corrupt Amen Priesthood was suppressed, and eventaully a civil war broke out throughout the Egyptian Empire from Kush to Hittite. Pharaoh Akhenaten established a new capital city Akhetaten (Amarna) located between the cith of Annu of the South (Heliopolis) and the Amen Priesthood headquarter and former capital city of Thebes just across from Khemannu\Hermopolis.

APPENDIX V_6: Pharaoh Akhenaten (Ikhnaton) Esoteric Identity as the Biblical Exodus Moses and King Sargon I of Assyria (continued)
This resulted in the Biblical Exodus lead by Pharaoh Akhenaton to Queen Nefertiti’s homeland Mitanni\ Neherna\Assyria of most of Egypt’s leading “Sun People” who
had been trained in the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) and many imprisoned Semites if we can believe the Bible an iota on this point.
c. Thus esoterically Manetho’s #9 Pharaoh Achencherses has been identified as Pharaoh Aakhunaten\Amenhotep IV co-regent with his father Pharaoh Amenhotep Ill about 1376 - 1361, sole ruler 1361 - 1345 B.C.
Remarkably even Manetho makes Pharaoh Aakhunaten and Moses contemporaries in the Eusebius variants of his Chronology: “#9 Achencherses for 16 years. About this time Moses led the Jews in their march out of Egypt.” [FR. 53a (from Syncellus) According to Eusebius]
“9 Achencherses . . . for 16 years. In his time Moses became the leader of the
Hebrews in their exodus from Egypt.” [FR. 53b Armenian version of Eusebius]
d. Via the genius of the multi-diciplinarian merging of adept psychoanalysis applied to history, Jewish psychiatrist Sigmund Freud agrees with Manetho:
“According to our construction the Exodus from Egypt would have taken place
between 1358 and 1350 B.C. - that is to say, after the ‘death’ * of lkhnaton and before the restitution of the authority of the state of Horemheb. The goal of the wondering could only be Canaan.... All conditions, internal and external, favoring the Exodus coincide only in the period immediately after the ‘death’ {disappearance} of the heretic King {lkhnaton}.” (from Sigmund Freud’s Moses and Monotheism, p.s. 32,33 and 36)
*NOTE: Pharaoh Akhenaton/lkhnaton’s "death” is conjecture, for where and when he died is still a mystery. Esoterically his destination was beyond Canaan\Syria to Mitanni\Upper Mesopotamia\Neherna\ Assyria ____Queen Nefertiti and his mother Queen Tiy homeland, the “Nine Bow” Tribe #3 refering to Illlustration I-2.
Sigmund Freud last book Moses and Monotheism was originally written in exile in Austria outside of Germany as a series of essays not a book as Frued feared Adolph Hitler rising to power as the German Chancellor. It’s genius of combining his pioneering psychoanalytic regimen with history represents the first multi-disciplinary psychoanalytic history. It came just short of concluding the esoteric truth that Moses was none other than Egyptian Pharaoh Akhunaten/Ikhnaton.
5. The remainder of Manetho’s commentary via Jewish historian Josephus’ is more corrupted with the following summary highlights: i.) Amenhotep, son of Hapu commits suicide after predicting to the King that civil war would breakout and for 13 years the lepers would take over Egypt; ii.) the lepers under an outcast priest of Osiris from Annu\ He!iopolis named Osarsiph later renamed Moses, joined forces with the Hyksos\Jews now settled in Jerusalem and took over Egypt forcing King Amenhotep to take refuge in Ethiopia; and iii.) in due course King Amenhotep returned to Egypt defeating Moses and his Hyksos allies causing their “Exodus from Egypt.
Knowing esoterically that King Amenhotep is Akhunaten the corruption of Josephus’ Manetho accounts is irrelevant, for Moses is made his opponent. As even Sigmund Freud realized Pharaoh Akhunaten and Moses theocratically have everything in common, and were most likely peers and allies.

APPENDIX V_7: Pharaoh Akhenaten (Ikhnaton) Esoteric Identity as the Bibllical Exodus Moses and King Sargon I of Assyria (continued)
6. Esoterically, Manetho through all the corruption and destruction of his works juxtaposes Pharaoh Akhunaten and Moses in his Chronology and History of Egypt (via Josephus). Even though censored, he puts the truth in both via the myth of Aegyptius and Danaus. Additionally, Manethos c. 300 B.C. had access to the earlier 5 th century B.C. Herodotus’ History. Book II paragraph 102 and 107 written 200 years before him, which correctly places this Aegyptius and Danaus myth in Dynasty 12 Pharaoh Sesostris IIl’s reign circa 1900 B.C. By using this device Manetho cleverly conceals via a comparative history key for those in the future to render the truth that would escape the censorship and rath of the all powerful and corrupt Amen-Ra/Osiris Cult Priesthood that controlled Ptolemy Egypt. It was the Pharaoh Ptolemy I or II that commissioned Manetho’s History.
Specifically, Manethos identifies the Pharaoh Armais he llsts as #12 as Danaus; an analogy that he is a traitor to the King who entrusts him with Kingly powers. We know that Horemheb or Armais was made general of the North by Pharaoh Akhunaten in the civil war with the forces of the Amen priesthood. This civil war took place about 3 years after Akhunaten became sole ruler about 1364 B.C. This is the 13-year period Amenhotep, Son of Hapu identified as the period of the struggle with the lepers under Osarsiph. Esoterically then Manetho’s has via the myth of Aegyptius and Danaus identified Horemheb as Osarsiph.
For it was when Pharaoh Akhunaten's general of the North Horemheb defects to the side of the Amen Priest forces that Akhunaten chose to abdicate the Egyptian throne and “Exodus” to his Queen Nefertiti and Mother (Queen Tiy) homeland Mitanni\Neherna\Assyria at the headwaters of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers in Mesopotamia. Aakhunaten left behind those family members who decided to continue to struggle against the Amen priest forces. Without exception each of the Kings Smenkhkare, Tutankhamon and Ay met unnatural deaths at the hands of the Amen-Ra priest forces. Then in the chaos the unroyal birthed Horemheb became Pharaoh.
B. Pharaoh Aakhunaten as: Becomes Assyria’s King Sargon\Ashur-Nadin-Akhi
1. Above is a picture of Pharaoh Akhunaten’s Canopic chest found smashed to fragments in the Royal Tomb at the city of Akhenaton; it is restored here. It’s decorations with a hawk with the Aten on its head, holding the “Shen Aten”\”Path of the Aten” hieroglyphics in its claws; indicates the Sun God Ra-Heru-Aakhuti. This implies its being made during the early years of the Pharaoh’s reign before his break with Amen-Ra\Osiris Cult, not using the usual four protective Gods\Goddesses. What happened to the burials of Pharaoh Akhunaten and Queen Nefertiti? They are unlikely ever to be known?” (C. Aidred’s Akhunaten, pg. 155)

APPENDIX V_8: Pharaoh Akhenaten (Ikhnaton) Esoteric Identity as the Biblical Exodus Moses and King Sargon I of Assyria (continued)
This is because Pharaoh Akhenaten nor Queen Neferfiti’s body as mummy or used funerary equipments have been found. The canopic jars which fit this chest were not filled with embalmed organs, nor stained with body fluids as would be expected if it had been so used.
Esoterically, Pharaoh Akhenaten and Queen Nefertiti’s burials were simply not carried out in Egypt, for they “Exodus” to Assyria and probably were buried there. Unbelievably, history records his presence as the King of Assyria known as Ashur—NadinAkhi reigning about 1380 - 1350 BC. - almost identical to Aakhunaten’s co-regency\regency durations of 1376- 1346. (Goodspeed, History of Babylon and Assyria, pg. 135)
Ashur Asar (1st plane Sun God of Egypt) Nadin N-Aten Akhi AaKhu Aakhun-Aten
Is it coincidence that contemporary Kings of Assyria and Pharaohs of Egypt have philologically the same name? Esoterically this is not coincidence but identity!
2. Esoterically Moses too is connected to Assyria through the seemingly strange similarity of his Biblical tradition with that of King Sargon of Agade (Akkad) Mesopotamia, who ruled anywhere from the 24th to the 13th century B.C.
From Madame Blavatsky’s isis Unveiled II, pgs. 442 and 443 and Secret
Doctrine I, pg. 319 footnote * comes the following information:
“On page 224 of Assyria Discoveries, Mr. George Smith says:
‘In the palace of Sennacherib {Assyrian King 705-681 B.C.) at Kouyunjik, I found another fragment of the curious history of Sargon, a translation of which I published in the Transaction of the Society of Biblical Archaeology. Vol. 1, pg. 46.’
‘This text relates that Sargon, an early Babylonian monarchy was born of royal parents, but concealed by his mother, who placed him on the Euphrates in an ark of rushes, coated with bitumen, Iike that in which the mother of Moses hid her child (see Exodus ii).’
‘Sargon was discovered. by a. man named Akki,. a water-carrier {gardener}, who adopted him as his son, and he afterward became King of Babylon.’
‘The capital of Sargon, (the Babylonian Moses), was the great city of Agadi called by the Semites Akkad - mentioned in Genesis as a capital of Nimrod (Genesis :10), and here he reigned for 45 years.Moses reigned over the people of Israel in the wilderness for more than 40 years.’
‘Akkad lay near the city of Sippara on the Euphrates and north of Babylon.’
‘Another strange coincidence is found in the fact that the name of the neighboring above-mentioned city of Sippara is the same as the name of the wife of Moses Zipporah (Exodus 2:21).’

APPENDIX V_9.00: Pharaoh Akhenaten (Ikhnaton) Esoteric Identity as the Biblical Exodus Moses and King Sargon I of Assyria (continued)
‘The name of Saigon signifies the right, true or legitimate King.’
‘The date of Saigon, who may be termed the Babylonian Moses, was in the 16th century and perhaps earlier.’
‘G. Smith adds in his Chaldean Account that Sargon I was a Babylonian monarch who reigned in the city of Akkad about 1600 B.C.”
The circa 1900 translaflon of the three Saigon Tab’et fragments by George Smith immediately uncovered the remarkab’e identity of Sargon’s heritage to that of the Biblical Moses. Yet a more modern translation of the fragment’s show that Sargon’s heritage is connected to the Annu Egyptian Aten Path and gardening life style.
* From G. Smith’s translations of lines 1-3 as found in Madame Bavatsky (Ibid.,.), circa 1900:
1.1 “Sargona, the powerful King, the King of Akkad {Agadi} am I.
1.2 My mother was a princess, my father I did not know, a brother of my father ruled over the country.
1.3 In the city of AzupFrana, which is by the side of the river Euphrates ....,”
From John Gray’s Near Eastern Mythology, pg. 54 is taken the following circa 1962 translations:
1.4 ”My mother, an enitum {anutum}, conceived me; in secret she bore me,
1.5 She set me in a basket of rushes, with bitumen she seated my lid,
1.6 She cast me into the river, which rose not over me,
1.7 The river bore me up and carried me to Akki, the drawer of water.
1.8 Akki, the drawer of water, sifted me out as he dipped his bucket.
1.9 Akki, the drawerof water, took me as his somand reared me,
1.10 Akki, the drawer of water, appointed me as his gardener.
1.11 While was a gardener, {Sun Goddess} Ishtar granted me her ‘ove,
1.12 . . .And for four and . years exercised Kingship,
1.13 The black-headed people ruled, I governed, ...”
Then the Sargon Tablet relates the extent of Sargon’s Kingdom of rule over the "black-headed people” to the Amanus Mountains in the west, to the Zagros Mountains in the east, to the Taurus Mountains to the north and the Persian Gulf to the south.

APPENDIX V_9.01: Pharaoh Akhenaten (Ikhnaton) Esoteric Identity as the Biblical Exodus Moses and King Sargon I of Assyria (continued)
3. Esoterically, “Akkad\Agadi” is the name of the region of Mesopotamia. During primaeval times it was inhabited by the “black-headed people” -also called the Akkadians\Sabaean\Mithannu; the mixed Dravidian and Black Annu ancestors of the Moors and Arabs, the Bible’s lshmaeljtes and Midianites.
NOTE: Conventionally, the White-Greek\Scythian “Sumerians are considered to be the “Black-Headed People,” who are given the achievement of civilizing Mesopotamia. Thus Sargon of Akkad is misconstrued as a Semitic conqueror of the Sumerians and thus assigned to the24 th Century B.C.
It is no coincidence that the capital of Akkad (Agadi) was the city of Sippara, which was the center of “sun worship” and “Aten Path” light and sound yoga mystery school was located there. Akkad was not a city but a primeval country.
“At Sippara, the worship of the sun-god {San or Sansi} was so prominent, that Abydenus, probably following. Berosus, called the town Heliopolis {Greek for the Egyptian word “Annu’) (Abyden, Fr. I Syncellus, Vol 1, pg. 70)” (from George Rawlinson, Seven Great Monarchies, Vol. 1 pg. 83.)
Thus no coincidence could explain that Moses’ wife Zipporah, has a name philologically identical to Sippara; and that Sippara is geographically located on the bank of the Euphrates north of Babylon in Assyria\Accad. Thus the city of Sargon’s birth “Azupirana” (line.3 of the Sargon Tablet) is esoterically analogous to Sippara\Zipporah.
Zipporah Azupirana (A)zupirana Suppi- anu Sippara
There is no coincidence that the “Aten Path” practicing people of Sippara, the Sepharvites are akin to the “missing” 10 tribes of Israel who were “carried off’ by the Assyrians from Samaria during the 8th and 9th century’s B.C. The Sephardite Jews of today bear this heritage and “birthright” Cain(aan)’s people.
“There can be little doubt that the Adrammaelech, or ‘Fire-King’. whose worship the Sepharvites (or people of Sippara) introduced into Samaria (2 Kings xvii 31), was this deity {of the Sun God San\Sansi}.” (from G. Rawlinson, Ibid., v.i, pg. 83)
C. The “Aten Path” Practice in Mesopotamia (Neherna)
1. Mithannu (Mitannu) of Northern Mesopotamia was a key Annu Egyptian “Nine Bow” country, whose name philologically shows its allegiance to the Annu “Aten Path”:
Mithra- Annu: Mithannu
India’s Hindu Most High God The country of Mithannu. And (8 th plane) Biblically known as Gozan, Persian Zoroastrian Haran, Halah and Midian; Sun Goddess, representing called Myodynia by Strabo: the tight and Sound and peopled by a mixed lndia Current analogous to Dravidian, Annu Black and the Annu Egyptian Goddess White race aboriginals Het Heru and synonym for a people following the Aten Path. Egyptian Hieroglyphics Egyptian Hieroglyphics (Budge’s Hieroglyphics (Budge’s Hieroglyphics Dictionary, pg. 291) Dictionary. pg. 999)
NOTE: That the hieroglyphic roots of Mith\Math’ is common to both the names of the goddess and the country.
THE EGYPTIAN MYSTERY “SCHOOL OF ON”, VOL. 1 BY GEORGE SINGLETON, ENLIGHTENMENT PUBLICATIONS, 2003 EDITION
267.



APPENDIX V_9.02: Pharaoh Akhenaten (Ikhnaton) Esoteric Identity as the Biblical Exodus Moses and King Sargon I of Assyria (continued)
It is no coincidence that the Sargon Tablet (line 11) relates that Sargon was granted ‘love” by the Sun Goddess Ishtar: for Ishtar was the Assyrian synonym of the Mitannu Sun Goddess Mithra, they both corresponding to the Annu Egyptian Sun Goddess Het Heru, the personification of the Inner Light and Sound Current. See Exhibit II_B-2_3 and Exhibit II_B-4. Thus, Sargon esoterically had access to this spirftual current; i.e., was a practitioner of the ‘Aten Path.” Akki, is esoterically his Akkidian Spiritual teacher of the ‘path.’ This is confirmed by the fact that Sargon’s mother was also an “Aten Pathni priestess, an “enitum”\anutum (1.4), as a well as being a princess (1.2).
The enitum {anutum} was originally the bride of the god {refer to POEM #9C}, for whom the King or chief-priest officiated in the fertility rites of the “sacred marriage.” (from John Gray, Op. Cit. pg. 55)
2. Consequently, it is not surprising to find a cloud of mystery and confusion surrounding the Sun God\Goddess Mithras\Mithra and the people of Mithannu. However, the identification of the below illustrated “Northern Mesopotamia” clay cylinder seal as an artifact of the Mithannu people is very clarifying and informative.
(from John Gray, Near Eastern Mythology, pg. 55 in Staatliche Museum, Berlin Germany, circa 1350 B.C.)
Esoterically, note the following interpretations of this Mithannu Clay Cylinder Seal:
a. It is a representation of the Mithannu King and his astral double standing before the "Tree of Life” the inner lighted sound stream called Sun Goddess Mithra; which leads 8 planes globes up to the Most High God Annu\Varuna. Compare with Exhibit II_B-2_3.
b. The winged disc above the iree of Life’ Sun Goddess Mithra is Sun God Mithras of the first spiritual plane. Compare with the Egyptian/Kemit winged Aten in Exhibit III_D-3_4.
c. Behind the King in the lower register is a representation of the Kings spiritual body facing the Leopard\Lion guard into the heavens. Compare with Exhibit II_C and Chapter Six Scripture D Chapter 64 a (long version) line 2.
d. Behind the King in the middle register is a representation of the King having successfully merged into the Leopard\Lion gaining entrance into the heavens symbolized as the sphinx.
e. Behind the King in the upper register is a representation of 4 Atens or Suns from the physical plane (Ra) to the 3rd plane spiritually; the King as gained access to the 3rd spiritual plane. Compare with Exhibit III_G-1.
f. The King’s astral double Fs holding the hand of a protective genie.
g. The ethnicity of the King is clearly “Negroid” specifically being mixed blood India Dravidian and Black Annu ancestors of the Bible lshmaelites and Moorish Arabs, esoterically the Biblical Midians.

APPENDIX V_9.03: Pharaoh Akhenaten (Ikhnaton) Esoteric Identity as the Biblical Exodus Moses and King Sargon I of Assyria (continued)
Thus the Mithannu King and by inference the best of its people embraced the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) spiritually system of the “Path of the Aten" holding in common the “Tree of Life” Sun Goddess (inner lighted sound current), the winged Aten disc of the Sun God first plane Mithras, the conceptualization of the struggle to leave the ‘body tomb” and the sphinx symbolism of the gaining access to the 3rd spiritual plane, the minimal ideal achievement of the King. Refer to POEM #7C and POEM #7D lines’ 31-34.
It is conventionally admitted that the Mithannu cylinder seals influenced the art of its long time regional state Assyria. “Mitannian cylinder seals.. . {have} certain motifs such as the stylized ‘sacred tree’ {of life} . {which} survived in the imagery of later Assyrian ornament.”
Esoterically, this indicates that the religious, culture and spirituality practice of the Mithannu of the outer and inner sun worship of the “Aten Path” yoga was also that of the Assyrians. This became especially so when Mithannu was destroyed and Egyptian Pharaoh Akhunaten “exoduses” to Assyria. . a region of and successor and champion of the “Aten Path” of Mithannu.
THE EGYPTIAN MYSTERY “SCHOOL OF ON”, VOL. 1 BY GEORGE SINGLETON, ENLIGHTENMENT PUBLICATIONS, 2003 EDITION
269.
(from Lloyd, Op. Cit. pg. .185, figure 133 circa 900 B.C.)
The above illustration of an Assyrian clay cylinder seal clearly shows the influence of the parent nation of Mithannu on its regional successor nation Assyria. Comparing it with the previously illustrated Mithannu cylinder seal finds the sharing of the winged disc, tree of life with 8 levels, and protective genei behind the King. A more humanized winged disc represents the Sun God Ashur\Asur; analogous to the Egyptian Sun God Asar\Mithannu Sun God Mithras of the first spiritual plane. Also compare with Exhibit III_F-1_2 where sun rays carrying the Ankh are analogous to the Egyptian Ankh or Annu Khet of the inner lighted sound current, the life energy “Creative Word” of the Aten.

5. Clearly if Pharaoh Akhunaten would “Exodus” anywhere it would be to Egypt’s ally Mitanni\Neherna\Assyria which was an enemy of the Hyksos. This is plainly stated by Manetho’s {Josephus, Contra Apionem I. 14 paragraph 77}:
“Above all, {Hyksos King Salitis} . . fortified the district to the east {of Egypt}, foreseeing that the Assyrians, as they grew stronger, would one day covet and attack his Kingdom’}. . . ethnic home of Akhunaten’s wife Nefertiti, mother Tiy, grandmother Mutemuaa(ra), and great-grandmother Tiy.
6. Again Sigmund Freud in Moses and Monotheism is astounding by identifying that the Bible contains two Moses figures, the first of the “Exodus” and the second much later one of the wars in Canaan, The first Pharaoh Akhunaten\Sargon I, the second a Semitic warrior priest of Jehovah, the first was a priest of the Aten\Atuma\Adonis never evoking the God Jehovah until made to do so via Jethro the Midian priest yielding his transformation to Moses #2. Moses #1 lived circa 1350 B.C., Moses #2 lived circa 1200 B.C.
D. Destination of Pharaoh Aakhunaten\Moses’ Exodus; Assyria
1. The possibility of Mitanni\Assyria as Pharaoh Akhunaten’s Exodus destination is supported by the following references from the “Tel-elAmarna letters” found in Akhunaten’s new cify Akhutaten (Amarna).
a. King Tushratta of Mitanni, contemporaneous with Pharaoh Amenhotep Ill and Pharaoh Akhunaten had possession of Nineveh, Assyria’s Goddess lshtar’s (Astarte, analogous to the Egyptian’s Ast, first plane Sun Goddess) statue and sent it to Egypt during Pharaoh Amenhotep Ill’s reign. This indicates Assyria was then under Mitanni control (Egypt’s major ally) and Assyria, Mitanni and Egypt shared very analogous “Aten Path” religions.
“The image of lshtar, Goddess of Nineveh {Assyria}, had fallen during this time into the hands of the King of Mitanni, who sent it to Egypt (Winckler, Tel-el-Amarna letters, 20).” (from Goodspeed, A History of Babylon and Assyria pg. 133)
A tablet (Kri #23) in the British Museum from Tushratta of Mitanni to Amenophis Ill announcing that the Goddess Ishtar of Nirieveh has been sent on a visit to Egypt. A docket written in hieratic by the Egyptian filing clerk gives the date the original was received at Thebes in year 36 and indicates that this was a copy.” (from C. Aldred, Aakhunaten, plate 116)

Year 36 of Amenhotep Ill coincide with co-regent year 8 of Akhenaten then residing in Akhetaten\Amarna where this letter was found.
b. Of the Temples of Aten Pharaoh Akhenaten built, one is known in Asia.
“He (Akhenaten) also built a temple to Aten in Syria, which is mentioned on one of the Tall al-Amarnah tablets in the British Museum * under the form Hi-na-tuna” (* Footnote: Babylon Room, Table-Case F. No. 72 (29855) (from W. Budge’s. Tutankhamon, pgs. 89 and 91)
c. But the rendering of Hi-na-tu-na from the cuneiform script and locating it in Syria is incorrect; correctly it was the city of Arbela based on the philologic analysis based on Mercers Assyrian Grammar presented below.
d. Arbela was a city of Assyria corresponding to the moderrn city of lrbil in Iraq; in ancient times just 40 miles east of the city of Nineveh between the Greater and
Lesser Zab River tributaries of the Tigris River in Mesopotamia. Arbela like Nineveh had the patron Goddess lshtar, and thus would have been supportive of
Akhenaten’s “Aten Path.’ See H. Frankfort, Kingship and the Gods on Arbela.
Assyria was a part of Mitanni originally, which stretched all the way to the Zargos Mountains in Iran to the Mediterranean Sea. Mitaani disintegrated as a result of the Egyptian Civil War, assasination of the Mitanni King Tushratti and the resulting
Pharaoh Akhenaten’s Exodus there. Arbela was next to Media, a district of Assyria.
Thus Arbela in Assyria was most likely the location of Pharaoh Akhenaten’s Asian Aten Temple as cited by Tel-el-Amarna Letter #72. Also it is more than likely that Assyria just outside the city of Nineveh, from which the Goddess Ishtar visited Egypt as cited by Tel-el-Armana Letter #23; was the Egyptian allied country that received the Exodus entourage of abdicated Pharaoh Akhenaten. He became the new Assyrian King Ashur-Nadin-Akhi; his mother (Tiy), wife (Nefertiti), followers of the Egyptian “Sun People” Aakhu-Hammemet and Hebrew\Khabiri slaves.
Esoterically, the “missing” 10 Tribes of Israel who were taken to Babylon and Assyria according to the Bible, were never missing but disassociated from their true identity as the 12 Tribes of lshmael, later known as the Arabian Moors. See POEM #7 C.

THE EGYPTIAN MYSTERY “SCHOOL OF ON”
Appendix VI-2_2: Vision Of A New Millennium: Global Peace through Meditation by Sant Rajinder Singh
Today we have gathered from all over the globe at a crossroads in time. We meet together to reflect on and to celebrate the past fifty years of the United Nations and to look ahead to a vision of the 21 st century. I offer my congratulations to the United Nations on their golden anniversary. Fifty years of organized dialogue among nations of the world is a monumental achievement. We celebrate this golden anniversary of the United Nations at the end of a millennium in which our technological progress has made global communications simple.
The continued existence of the United Nations is a reflection of the growing desire of humanity to achieve lasting peace on our planet. Each member of our global society, therefore, has a shared responsibility toward the attainment of peace. Let us join together, rising above labels and divisions, and set a course for the United Nations and for all people that calls forth the highest aspirations of humanity. If we can do so, posterity will look back on this moment and say that we were leaders who inspired and moved humanity forward in its evolution to a higher consciousness and brought peace to a weary planet.
This transformation can take place through four steps. First, we need an inspiring vision of the new millennium. Second, moved by that inspiration, we need to live the vision. Third, each of us needs to share and promote the vision to our respective countries, religious groups, organizations, and circles. Fourth, we need to teach people how they can live the vision. In a few words, we need inspiration, meditation, communication, and education to bring about the transformation we so earnestly seek.
First: Have a Vision
Let us begin with a vision of a Second Renaissance on earth—a time for renewal and enlightenment where noble human values illuminate every heart. It is time to hear the laughter of every child on this planet Instead of their cries of hunger arid screams of terror. It is time to see families live out their destiny in peace and joy instead of being torn apart by war and violence. lt is time to smell the fragrance of flowers in our air instead of the stifling smell of pollution. It is time to see people of all nations, colors, and religions embrace one another, conscious of their unity while celebrating their differences. The time for rededication and renewal is now. Let us seize the moment—for the sake of our children, our planet, and our souls.
Let us join together to offer an action plan to lay the foundation of the United Nations’ future. In the past, people have focused on bringing about peace in the strife-torn parts of the world. Despite the best of efforts, there is still war and violence. I would like to share with you another point of view, a shift in thinking, and offer a solution that is so simple, it is startling. It is not my solution, but one that already lies in each one of our hearts. It is one that has been taught by the saints, mystics, philosophers, and prophets that have walked the face of this earth. That message is that our efforts in making other countries, communities, and people peaceful are only a part of the solution. The missing key is that we begin finding peace within ourselves. In truth, peace begins within us.
At this critical juncture in the United Nations’ growth, it is time for new solutions. So many attempts have been made to bring about outer peace and so much good has been accomplished over the past fifty years. But peace still eludes us. What has been missing has been spoken of since the dawn of time. If we scan the pages of history, we will find that the great saints and founders of every religion brought to the world a simple message: peace lies within. The process of achieving inner peace is called meditation. If we want lasting outer peace, then let each of us explore inner peace.

jAppendix VI-2_3: Vision Of A New Millennium: Global Peace through Meditation by Sant Rajinder Singh
Second: Live the Vision
For this transformation we need to live the vision ourselves. We are busy trying to make other countries peaceful, but do we have peace in our own countries? We are busy trying to make every other community peaceful, but do we have peace in our own communities? We are busy worrying about whether the family next door is peaceful, but do we have peace in our own household? We are busy worrying about making everyone around us peaceful, but do we have peace within our own selves? Let us turn this formula around. if we want to bring about world peace, let us first find peace within ourselves. If we want to have global peace for our generation, let us begin with personal peace through meditation.
Let us make a commitment from this day forward to explore inner peace within ourselves by practicing meditation. By meditating, we discover the Light of the Creator shining within each of us. Contact with the inner Light brings about a profound transformation. We are bathed in love. We realize the same Light that is within us is in every human being and each living creature. We recognize that we arc all souls, drops of the one Creator, and as such we are all brothers and sisters in the Lord. We see all creation knit together in the silken bonds of love. We start to treat all humanity as members of one family and begin to love, respect, and serve one another. We want to eliminate the pain and suffering in the lives of others for we realize that the pain of others is our pain and the joy of others is our joy. We must feel the world’s pain, and then heal the world’s pain. The dreams and goals of the United Nations can become reality as a by-product of inner spiritual growth.
By realizing our oneness through meditation we see that we are all one family. Hunger will be eliminated, because who would let their family go hungry? By realizing our oneness through meditation, poverty will be eliminated, because who would let their family be homeless in the streets? By realizing our oneness through meditation, war will be eliminated, because who turns a gun on one’s brothers or sisters?
If we discovered peace and happiness through meditation, we would live our lives in a state of calm and equipoise, and we would radiate that peace to others. Anyone who came in contact with us would naturally feel peaceful. We would no longer have to pray for peace we would be peace. Meditation elevates us to achieve an angle of vision in which we become a witness to the unity in the fabric of life. We look upon the world as an embroidered whole. All life may appear like a variety of colors, shapes, and sizes but, in reality, the texture is the same: the texture of love. Imagine a world in which everyone lived this vision. How many wars would come to an end? How many cities would become safe? How many community problems would be solved? How many domestic fights would dissolve? We would have a world permeated with peace where people could live their lives safe from the threat of crime and war.
Third: Share and Promote the Vision
The third step in making the vision of the new millennium a reality is to share and promote it in our respective countries, religious groups, organizations, and circles. Let us make a commitment today to be an inspiration to others by spending some time daily in meditation ourselves and encouraging others in our countries and religions to do the same. If we are leaders or representatives of a nation, a religion, a spiritual path, or an organization we must set an example. We cannot merely engage in preaching and lecturing. We ourselves must live a life of meditation, ethical values, and love for all.
When people see us living up to the noble ideas taught by the great saints, philosophers, and humanitarians they will he motivated to lead such a life themselves. No saint or enlightened being taught hatred and violence. Yet throughout history we find, time and

again, religious wars bringing untold death, destruction, and misery. We find throughout history, people of all religions at one time or another killing in the name of God. We even find followers of the same religious founder divided into different sects within the same religion, engaged in religious persecution and wars with each other. Among nations, we find people taking pride in their own way of doing things. People come to believe that their own culture and customs are the best and begin to denigrate those from other cultures and religions. Instead of differences being a source of beauty; diversity, and joy they become a breeding ground of bigotry; intolerance, and hatred. It is time to call a halt to the fires of hatred and violence, and we can do so by first extinguishing these flames within ourselves. Before we heal the world we must heal ourselves. Before we can bring lasting peace to the world we must have peace ourselves. Through meditation we can attain this state of peace. Then we can radiate it to our families, communities, religious groups, and countries.
Once someone asked a gardener to plant a certain kind of tree. The gardener replied, “But this tree grows so slowly that it will not reach its maturity for a hundred years.” The man replied, “Then we have no time to waste—plant it today.” Similarly, let us not waste a single moment—let us plant the tree of peace today. Let us start now by learning a simple technique of meditation that will bring about this desired peace. This process of inversion lies at the core of every religion, and has been taught by all saints and founders. My own spiritual teachers, Sant Kirpal Singh Ji Maharaj and Sant Darshan Singh Ji Maharaj, made an intense comparative study of all religions and found that at the heart of each lies an underlying message: There is Light within. There is a divine Sound Current within. There is universal love within, and we can find all these gifts through meditation. Search the sacred works of the world and you will find references to the same Light and Sound, whether it is called Word in the holy Bible, Kalma in the Muslim scriptures, Jyoti and Sruti or Naad in the Hindu scriptures, Sraosha in the Zoroastrian scriptures, Naam in the Sikh scriptures, or Baang-i-Asmaani in the Sufi scriptures, or many other terms in other religions. By merging in the divine Light within we will find eternal love, eternal happiness, and eternal peace.
Love, which is lying dormant in each of us, is awakened by nonviolence. Nonviolence is not limited only to humans, but extends to animals, plants, insects, and each living form. It is nonviolence that awakens the love in us, and that love is actually the love of God. Once the love of God is awakened, we are not going to hurt any other living form. It is ahimsa or non-violence that makes one a true human being—the human being that God wants us to be. When nonviolence comes in the presence of violence, then with joy in its heart, nonviolence sacrifices itself and lets its own blood flow. It is one who walks on the path of nonviolence who removes the pain and anguish of the whole world. When we look at the lives of the great saints and mystics, whether it was Buddha, Krishna, Mahavira, Moses, Christ, Mohammed, or Guru Nanak, we see how much they sacrificed—not for themselves, but for the world.
Without sacrifice, there can be no nonviolence. Without sacrifice there can be no love. Without sacrifice there can be no selfless service. Without sacrifice we cannot be a true human being. It is that sacrifice that we have to make and that God expects us to make if we want to walk on the path of nonviolence. If we walk on the path of nonviolence, the whole world comes close to us and we draw close to the whole world. Our life is then lived for every human being who shares the planet. Strife, tension, and wars will disappear, and if we are at peace ourselves, our communities, our nations, and the whole world will be at peace. Some may ask, “If I find inner peace, how can I alone bring about outer peace?” In reply to this I would like to relate an anecdote. A man was walking along the beach and he spotted another man from afar picking something up, twirling around and tossing it in the water. The man kept repeating these movements, so the first man

was curious, approached him and asked, “What are you doing?” The man called back, “I am throwing the starfish back into the ocean. If I do not do this, they will die on the shore.” Scanning the beach, the first man said, “But there are thousands of starfish on the beach. What difference can you possibly make?“ Without the least hesitation the second man picked up another starfish, threw it back in the water and said, “It made a difference for that one”
We too can make a difference for all humanity and for posterity by the actions we choose to take. Let us begin with our own transformation and pursuit of peace.
Fourth: Teach Others How They Can Live the Vision
Along with promoting the vision, we need to teach people how they can live the vision by giving them the tools to do so. We need to teach people how to meditate, how to live in a nonviolent, peaceful way, and how to help end the suffering of others. Let Us teach people to reject the infliction of pain and instead inject affection and love. We need to set an example and teach others how to make all decisions in a manner that will not cause pain, injury, or death to any being, but instead will bring about peace and harmony to all.
In this century there are two noble examples of saints who lived this vision and taught others to do the same. One example was Sant Kirpal Singh Ji Maharaj, the great saint of Sant Mat and Surat Shabd Yoga in India, founder-president of the World Fellowship of Religions, and convener of the first Human Unity Conference held in India in 1974. Thirty-nine years ago, he addressed the 9th General Session of UNESCO, saying: “Without love no lasting peace can be maintained in the world and without the spiritual aspect of man being realized you cannot have true love.” He cited instances from the past in which heads of state consulted the saints and enlightened beings of their times in matters affecting humanity as a whole and asked them for solutions to carrying out the work of their state without recourse to physical force or violence. Sant Kirpal Singh Ji then said, “If similar guidance can now be had, it would go a long way to secure peace in the world.”
The second example of one who continued this work for peace was Sant Darshan Singh Ji Maharaj, founder of the Science of Spirituality, a renowned Urdu mysticpoet who won four Urdu Academy Awards for his poetry, and president of the 6th World Religions Conference. He lived a life of meditation, service to humanity, and love for all and taught others how to lead such a life.
He wrote in his verse:
Life is not a dagger stained with the blood of hatred; It is a branch filled with the flowers of love and compassion.
In another verse he said:
Life itself is restless for peace in the world, Let its noble dream materialize. May the garden be illumined with wave after wave of Light. May the wealth of love grow greater and greater and enrich even heart.
It is my heartfelt prayer that we see the fulfillment of their mission as we enter me new millennium. We are holding gatherings where civic, religious, and social leaders can explore these ideas in such forums as the annual International Conference On Human lntegration and the Global Conference on Mystism.

We convened the 7th World Religions Conference in which we held the first
"Spiritual Dialogue on Meditation, Prayer, and Nonviolence.” Next September 1996, we will hold the Sixteenth International Human Unity Conference.
The United Nations can take a more active role In leading the world into an era of peace if each member of the United Nations from the ambassadors and delegates to its agencies and NGO's, becomes an expert in peace by learning meditation and encouraging others to practice it as well1 seeing the Light of God in every human being, and letting love, nonviolence, and service for all humanity guide their every decision.
So let us sit for a few moments to learn a simple method of meditation and then share it with others. The technique is simple and after learning it you can practice it in your homes every day. Meditation is the process of concentration and can be practiced by people of any age, any religion, and background. We concentrate our attention at a point between and behind the two eyebrows known as the seat of the soul the single eye or the third eye. By focusing our attention there we come in contact with a current of Light and Sound which leads to a state of higher consciousness and peace. In each religion one finds references to a power that flows out from the Creator. This power has two manifestations Light and Sound. This current flows out from the Creator and also returns to the Source. When we withdraw our attention to the seat of the soul, we can tap into this inner Light and Sound. Contact with it fills us with a profound peace, love and happiness, more fulfilling and blissful than any we know on earth.
So if you would like to meditate, sit in a pose that is most comfortable to you,
Close your eyes. Focus your attention in the field of darkness lying in front of you. Do not put any strain or tension on the forehead or eyes You are not looking in front of you with your outer but looking into the middle of whatever is in front of you with closed eyes. To keep your mind from distracting your gaze by sending. thoughts, repeat any name of the Creator with which you feel comfortable. Repeat that Name slowly and mentally and not out loud. Continue concentrating on whatever comes in front of you. By concentrating in front of you, Light will sprout forth, You may see Light—Lights of any color, white, gold, blue, red, yellow, orange, purple, etc. You may see an inner vista of sky, stars, moon and sun, or other inner experience. Keep looking into the middle of whatever you see in front of you. That Light will give you peace. Let us sit now in meditation for a few moments and I pray that at each of you receive whatever is best for you. (Sant Rajinder Singh leads the assembly in meditation for a few minutes.)
As you can see, this technique is very simple and can be practiced by people of every country, religion, age group, and walk life. You can practice it in the comfort of your home or anywhere you want. If each person practices this, it will not be long before we find that everyone attains inner peace. With an inner core of peace nurturing our lives, we will live in the world in a spirit of positive mysticism. Meditation is not life negating; instead it is active. Along with meditation, we live in the world, make a positive contribution to society, and do our best to help make the world a better place. As a byproduct outer peace will be a reality.
So let us begin today with this simple action plan: inspiration, meditation, communication, and education to bring about transformation. As we set forth a vision for the United Nations for the 21st century, it is my hope and prayer that our meditation today be the start of a continuous exploration of inner peace so that all of us, our families, our children, our grandchildren, and posterity finally experience inner and outer peace. May God bless us in our endeavors.
Thank you.

THE EGYPTIAN MYSTERY “SCHOOL OF ON”
APPENDIX VII-1: Need for a Perfect "Spirituality" Master: Excerpt from Sant Kirpal Singh Ji’s Naam or Word
“The initiation into the esoteric science of the soul can successfully and rightly be granted by some perfect Saint or Master, an adept in the art and science of Para Vidya or the Knowledge of Beyond. One who has no himself extricated and freed his spirit from body bondage and transcended into higher spiritual regions and who has not seen Reality face to face and who as not, by spiritual practice, become established in Truth, cannot possibly do anything in this behalf, A Saint of the highest order alone is competent to reveal the Path and lead Godward, regardless of what we call him: Sant Satguru, Murshid-i-Kamil, Prophet, Messiah or Master – Soul. As light comes from light, so does like from like. The scriptural lore, by itself, is unable to impart this life-impulse.
‘Meet a Satguru and take his initiation, surrender thine all and peep within (Guru Nanak) (Gauri Mi)
‘Repent, and be baptized everyone of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and ye shalt receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. (St. Peter) (Bible, Acts 2:38"
“No man, however learned he may be, however high his morals are pitched, can by his own unaided efforts rise above body-consciousness. The experience of the spirit withdrawal while living can be vouchsafed only a Master Saint and by no one else, and without this transcendence one cannot peep into the worId beyond and take hold of the Sound Principle, the Devine Chord in man, the link between the Creator and his creation.
‘It is the Divine Law that none can conceive of Him without a Satguru. (Guru Amar Das) (Bihagra War Mz)”
‘No man cometh unto the Father, but by me. (Christ) (Bible, John 14:6)
‘Neither knoweth any man the Father save the son, and he to whom ever the Son
will reveal him." (Christ) (Bible, Matthew 11:27)”
“Initiation from a Master - Soul is of paramount importance, for herein lies the secret of all esoteric teachings and esoteric experience. It means a new birth and a new life, entirely in a new setting. This spiritual birth or birth in the Master is called a second birth, and enables a person to turn over a new leaf, to say goodbye to the past and march forward to this original home, the long-forgotten paradise - New Jesusalem, the Holy. City, Muqam-iHaq or Sach Khand.
‘Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the Kingdom of God. (Christ) (Bible, John 3:3)
‘Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God. (Christ) (Bible, John 3:6)”

APPENDIX VII-2_1: Sant Darshan Singh’s - The Divine Path” (emphasis added)
P# 1 “In the beginning God was an Ocean of Consciousness. God was alone and the question of separation did not arise. But later God decided to become many from one. This is expressed in the Hindu scriptures; and the Muslims also say that, ‘God said, ‘Become’ and it became.’ So the process of separation started. Maulana Rumi, a great mystic, starts his ‘Masnavi” with the following words:
Listen to the sound of the flute. Because it is telling its own tale of separation.
And the tale is a very poignant one.”
P# 2 “Gradually so many species of life came into being, and the soul has been passing though these species. We have been separated from our Source, the fountainhead of Love, Light and Life, for millions of years. The ultimate goal of man is communion of his soul with the Creator, and it is only when the soul assumes the human body that the soul can merge back with God. This is why all scriptures tell us that the human body is the crown of creation. Maulana Rumi has said, “You are next to God, 0 man.” Even if the angels are to attain ultimate salvation, they also have to assume the human form. It is also stated in the scriptures that when man was created the angels were asked to bow to him.”
P# 3 But unfortunately we have forgotten that we are souls and we have started to believe that we are the body itself. The truth of all religions is that we are ensouled bodies, and we are here to find out ways and means to achieve our purposes in life to know yourself and to know God. So this is the point of the story.
P# 4 The other part is that when God came into expression, He assumed two forms. One was the Light of God and the other was the Music of the Spheres. His Holiness Sant Kirpal Singh Ji would often explain the meaning of the word ‘religion.” The prefix re’ means ‘back’ and 'liaare' means ‘to bind.’ So religion means the path which binds the soul back to God. This can be done only through a direct contact with the Light of God and the Music of Spheres (Naam or Word). And this is what the Saints give. The Saints come into this world and assume the human form just to take the soul back to its Eternal Home.
P# 5 God is love, and the soul being of the same essence as that of God is also love. And the way back to God is love. The Saint or Master is love’s embodiment. So Masters come here and take us back only through love. We therefore pray that we may also come in contact with such a soul who is one with God, and as such is a conscious co-worker of the divine plan. We may call him by any name God -- power, Christ power, Master power, or Word made-flesh. He is the only living entity who can help us unite our soul to God. Life is born out of life. He gives us a contact with the Elixir of Life, the priceless Jewel within one of us.
P # 6 We have therefore to sit at the feet of someone who has known God and learn from them how to lead a pure life. What will they do? Naturally, if they know God, they will know what are the retarding factors in our way to God Realization.” [emphasis added]

APPENDIX VII-2_2: Sant Darshan Singh’s - The Divine Path” (emphasis added) (continued)
P# 7 “They will tell us how to withdraw the attention from without and show us how to rise above body consciousness and come in contact with the God-power already within us. Then we well be able to hear the Music of the Spheres reverberating in all creation. This is the Water of Life and the more we partake of it, the more our love will increase for God and the entire creation. We will see God both within and without and see that the whole world is nothing but an expression of God.”
P# 8 “The greatest grace of the Saints is that at the time of initiation into the Mysteries of the Beyond, they give us a direct link with the Divine Light and Music of the Spheres. They tell us that our body is the real temple. God does not reside in temples made by human hands. Outer temples are just to remind us of our Godly heredity within. The symbol’s of light and sound found in temples and churches are just reminders of the Light and Sound Principles within us. So our body is the real temple of God. On the first day of Initiation, the living Master gives us a direct link with the inner Light and Sound, so that we can progress on the Path, come above the body consciousness, and traverse within to meet the Radiant Form of the Master.”
“This is the first stage {of spirituality.”
P# 9 “In spirituality, all Masters have told us that there are two stages. First is the communion with our Master, and second is the communion with our Creator. When we reach the Radiant Form of the Master within, after rising above the body consciousness, we will merge with the Master. And then the Master through divine grace, takes us through the higher planes. Progressing thus from plane to plane, we arrive at our final destination, our eternal Home, Supreme Truth, Supreme Consciousness, and Supreme Bliss.”

APPENDIX VII-3_1: “Can We See God?” - An Interview with Sant Darshan Sing Ji (emphasis added)
Sant Darshan Singh, the past Science of Spirituality living Master was born in 1921, the son of Sant Kirpal Singh. Both father and son were initiated into the mysteries of the
Word the Surat Shabd Yoga, by the great Master Hazur Baba Sawan Singh. Darshan Singh devotedly served Hazur, as well as Hazur’s successor, Sant Kirpa Singh. In 1974, when Sant Kirpai Singh left the earthly toil, the power of spirituality was transferred to Sant Darshan Singh, who carried the torch of spirituality as the living Master of the science of the soul ___ fully competent to answer the aspirants deepest questions, grant first hand spiritual experience of the Light of God and the Music of the Spheres at the time of initiation, and guide the soul, within and without, back to its true Home.
Sant Darshan Singh resided at Kirpal Ashram in Delhi, India. He toured America in 1978 and 1986. He gave Naam initiation free of charge to sincere seekers after truth the world over. He died in 1988 and has been succeeded by his son Sant Rajinder Singh Ji.
Question #1: Can we see God?
The Master: Yes, we can see God in this very lifetime.
Question #2: What is the proof of what you are saying?
The Master: Just as the proof of the pudding is in the eating, the proof of spiritual attainment is in its experience. We can attain self-knowledge and Godrealization through mystic experiences or the path of the Masters. Once Ramakrishna Pharamhans was asked by his disciple Vivekananda, ‘Father, have you seen God?’ He replied. ‘Yes, my son, have seen him as clearly as I see you.’
When God came into expression He assumed two forms: the Light of God and the Music of the Spheres. It is by coming in contact with these two Principles that we cannot only see God but we can talk to Him face to face, get his guidance in all our affairs and ultimately merge in Him.
Question #3: What does God look like?
The Master: God is formless. God is all effulgence, all Light, and pristine glory. God is so effulgent that we cannot describe His Light in detail, but it has been said in the scriptures that even trillions of suns and moons put to other cannot vie with even one hair of God. We can see God in His pristine glory in the highest spiritual stage. But since the highest spiritual realm is beyond the reach of the mind and intellect, mere words cannot describe it in clear terms. It is said that in that state we speak without tongue, we see without eyes, we hear without ears, we walk without feet, and we work without hands. That realm cannot be described in words, and al that has been said by the saints and seers gives only a hazy estimate and a symbolic representation. But one thing can be said: there is no language there except for one, and that is the language of love.
PREVIOUS APPENDIX E-BOOK NAVIGATOR



APPENDIX VII-3_2: “Can We See God?” - An Interview with Sant Darshan Sing Ji (emphasis added)
Question #4: In what ways can we see God?
The Master: God has been seen by all saints and seers since the dawn of eternity. Guru Nanak has said, “I see my Lord before me.” Other saints and seers have told us that they have seen God within. God has seldom been seen in the various places of pilgrimage because God does not reside in temples made by human hands; he resides in a temple which He has made with His own hands -that is the human body. And the human body is the real temple in which we can see God in all His effulgence.
Question #5: There have been many books written about life after death experiences. What do you think about this?
The Master: The various books written about life after death, including Dr. Raymond Moodys book, Life after Life, have emphasized the inevitability of death and the continuance of our life after physical death. The recent revelation of these truths through these books may have caused a stir in the West, but in reality our saints, seers and prophets all over the world have been talking about these truths since the dawn of eternity. They have been stressing the need of learning to die so that we may begin to live and they have experienced death even many times a day. They have been blessed with this experience by coming in contact with the revitalizing Word, that is: the Light of God and the Music of All Harmonies. These divine gifts have been bestowed on seekers after truth at the time of initiation through the grace and compassion of the living Master of the times.
Question # 6: Why do we need a living Master?
The Master: A living Master is one who has not only learned to die while living and has thus attained communion with the Almighty, but he is also one who can teach others the technique of dying while living so they too can attain the merger of their soul with God. Sincere seekers after truth go to a perfect Master to learn the above technique and reach their ultimate goal of self-knowledge and God-realization.
Question #7: What is the purpose of meditation?
The Master: Although everyone in the world is searching for happiness, we find that everyone is suffering from pain, disappointment and unhappiness; The transitory and material things in life cannot give us any lasting pleasure. Since the soul is a conscious entity and is of the same essence as of God, it is only a conscious contact with the divine essence within us that can give us solace and peace of mind. We find that lately, more and more people are looking for inner peace, a lasting peace. Meditation is the process of withdrawing our attention from the world and the senses and focusing ft within to come in contact with the Light and Sound of God, which is the source of all love, all joy, all peace and bliss.
Question #8: There are many groups starting up, especially in the United States, which are practicing different lypes of meditation, although they are not connected with any particular teaching. What is the difference between those forms of meditation and a more spiritual meditation as the type you are teaching?

APPENDIX VII-3_3: “Can We See God?” - An Interview with Sant Darshan Sing Ji (emphasis added) (continued)
The Master: Most of the forms of meditation which are now being adopted relate to the yogic exercises. Some of these exercises are primarily meant to keep our bodies healthy and fit but they have little or no bearing on the elevation of the soul and its ultimate union with the Almighty, which is the be-all and end-all of the human life.
Question #9: What are the requirements for initiation?
The Master: All scriptures tell us we must lead an ethical life, which is a steppingstone to spirituality. An ethical life means a life of truth, love and all, chastity, humility, selfless service and nonviolence. Another requirement is the maintenance of a strict vegetarian diet: abstinence from meat, fish, fowl and eggs, both fertile and infertile. If we say we have love and compassion for all, how can we claim to be lovers of the entire creation of God and yet eat the dead bodies of animals which are served to us as food.
Sant Kirpal Singh 1894-1974, great spiritual Master of this age, devoted his whole life to God and to the service of creation. He first physically met his own Master, Hazur Baba Sawan Singh in 1924, after seeing him inside in daily meditations for seven years. He served Hazur for 24 years, then was commissioned by Hazur to take up the work as the living Master of the Surat Shabd Yoga. Sant Kirpal Singh was the first perfect Master of modern times to visit the West (in 1995, 1963 and 1972). His accomplishments were incredible:
He connected thousands of souls with the inner Light and Sound of God; was elected president of the World Fellowship of Religions by leaders of the major faiths; convened the World Conference on Unity of Man, the largest inter-religious gathering since the time of Ashok; built Manav Kendra (Man :enter) in India; wrote a score of spiritual books, give innumerable discourses and composed numerous poems; and lighted the flame of divine love in the hearts of millions.
Question #10: Are their any other requirements for initiation?
The Master: Another requirement with regard to diet is the avoidance of all liquors and intoxicating drugs.
Question #11: Why are alcohol and drugs prohibited?
The Master: Spirituality is an awakening of the divine consciousness which is within everyone. In order to take up .the spiritual path we have to become more conscious. By taking alcohoi and drugs, instead of expanding our consciousness, we dull it. Spirituality a path of freedom, but if we become addicted to alcohol and drugs, then where is our freedom? Anything which is habit-forming, or anything which weakens our consciousness, stands in the way of the ultimate goal of our lives which is to liberate our soul, a conscious entity, from the clutches of mind and matter. It is only after the soul shakes off these shackles that it can traverse into the higher regions and commune with God, who is all-consciousness.



APPENDIX VII-3_4: “Can We See God?” - An Interview with Sant Darshan Sing Ji (emphasis added) (continued)
Question #12: What does it cost to follow the path?
The Master: Spirituality, like all other gifts of nature, is bestowed free of charge to seekers after truth. A true Master always earns his own livelihood and does not accept any offerings from his disciples.
Question #13: In order to follow the path of the Masters, do we have to leave the world and go into the mountains or the jungles to find God. This is not a path of negative mysticism, and it is a path of positive mysticism. We are to remain in the world, but not be attached to it. We have to fulfill our worldly obligations, earn our own livelihood, and share with others. We do not have to leave our families. Marriage is not a bar to spirituality if lived according to the scriptures. We find that many of the saints have their family life and they fulfill their obligations as householders.
So saints ask us to lead normal lives and practice self-discipline, ethical living, and meditation. This is what is needed. We must develop these qualities in order to move forward on the spiritual path.
Question #14: Is it possible for a Christian to also follow the path?
The Master: Yes. Ours is a scientific path. We present spirituality only as a science. If a Christian comes, he is always asked to become a true Christian and to follow the teachings of Christ. We are ourselves following the teachings of Christ, and of all other prophets and saints who have blessed this earth from time immemorial. But we practice religion only as a perfect science. We do not dabble with its exoteric side which pertains to outer forms of worship such as rites and rituals; we deal only with the inner esoteric side which is universal.
Question #15: Can you explain to me this passage from the Bible which says that “some will fall away from the faith; they wilI yield to deluding spirits and demonic teachings by liars whose own consciences are seared with a branding iron. They prohibit marriage and the enjoyment of foods which God created to be partaken of by thanksgiving, by those who believe and know the truth, for everything which God created is good, and nothing is to be rejected when it is gratefully received for it is consecrated through the Word of God and prayer?”
The Master: This passage talks about marriage and about food, So far as marriage is concerned, I have already stated that marriage is no bar to spirituality provided that we lead our married life according to the scriptures. We have seen in history that even the saints have had family lives and have attended to all their household obligations.
So far as the question of food is concerned, we do not debar anybody from eating whatever has been given by nature in the form of vegetables. If we on the one hand profess to have love for all creation, how can we, on the other hand, agree to slaughter animals, birds and fish for our own appetites? We say that Christ was the Apostle of Peace, and that he was the embodiment of nonviolence. Christ and nonviolence go together. Christ said, “Whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.”

APPENDIX VII-3_5: “Can We See God?” - An Interview with Sant Darshan Sing Ji (emphasis added) (continued)
The Master: If he was nonviolent to this extent, he could not have been violent to those on the lower rungs of the creation of God, meaning the animals, the birds and the fish. He was for universal love, and he was for total nonviolence. If we are also for universal love and total nonviolence, then we will not kill anyone. And even otherwise, it has been written in the holy scriptures, “Thou shalt not kill.” If we follow the golden principle of “Thou shalt not kill.” then naturally it is out of the question to take meat, fish, fowl and eggs. So while adhering to the vegetarian diet we are strictly following the commandments of the Apostle of Peace, because he asked us not to indulge in any killing. He commanded that we have love for all creation, and this, along with nonviolence, will naturally debar us from killing and eating animals.
Question #16: When you eat anything it is said you are taking a smaller form of life; in essence, killing it and digesting it into your own body - even vegetables, even water. Could you explain this?
The Master: There are five substances or elements, which in our scriptures are called tatwas: earth, water, fire, air and ether. Mans body contains all the five tatwas which make him the most valued. Man’s killing of fellowcreatures is considered the most heinous crime, and in history, it has merited capital punishment. The next value is placed on the quadrupeds and beasts having four tatwas or elements, with ether being almost absent or forming a negligible portion. According to most laws, killing of an animal usually entails a penalty equal to the price of the animal in question. Then come birds, having three active elements in them- water, fire and air - giving them lesser value. Lesser still is the value for reptiles, worms and insects which have only two active tatwas or elements - earth and fire - as the other three elements exist in a dormant form. This death of this species of life does not involve any penalty of payment by most laws in the world. The least value is placed on roots, vegetables and fruits which contain only the element of water in an active state, leaving the other four elements dormant. Thus, karmically the vegetarian and fruitarian diet constitutes the least pain-producing diet, and man, by partaking of this type of diet, contracts the least karmic debt. Since we have to live in the world and keep our body going, then keeping in view the point of nonviolence, let us try to live by causing the least.possible pain and.destruction, and that is possible if we partake of the vegetarian diet.
Many people have a misunderstanding about the vegetarian diet in thinking that vegetables do not give us proper food value. I have been in touch with the leading nutritional researchers in India, and their evidence shows that the vegetarian diet gives us the necessary nutritional balance for keeping us going. Actually till a few years back the only complaint made was that vegetarians were not getting the proper proteins; but the latest research shows that we can certainly get the proper amount of proteins, as well as the required calories. From the health point of view the vegetarian diet is as wholesome and nutritious as any other diet, and this has been proved by the scientists, biologists and nutritionists.

APPENDIX VII-3_6: “Can We See God?” - An Interview with Sant Darshan Sing Ji (emphasis added) (continued)
Question #17: What is the relationship between the Master and his disciples?
The Master: The relationship between the Master and the disciple is one of selfless love. The Master guides the footsteps of a disciple rn this world as well as in the hereafter. He assists the disciple till the latter have reached his final spiritual destination and attained communion with the Almighty.
The disciple in turn is moved by a spirit of complete dedication, complete self-surrender, and implicit obedience toward his Master. He emulates the ideal life of his Master with a view to imbibe his godly virtues.
Question #18: How long will it take for the disciple to attain the ultimate goal?
The Master: We cannot fix any time limit because it all depends on the evolution of the soul of the disciple concerned. Some of the disciples are already very evolved on the spiritual path, and the moment they come to a Master they make quick progress. But others who are not so spiritually evolved, or who do not have the same zeal or passion for this path, naturally take their own time.
Question #19: How can these spiritual teachings help the world?
The Master: Despite all our material progress the world is at the edge of a precipice. With all these nuclear weapons, one wrong step and mankind will fall into the abyss of complete devastation and annihilation. Before controlling our own self, we have tried to control the forces of nature. Had we perfected our own selves first, our material progress would have been used for the benefit of humanity. To be successful in any walk of life we should have control over our mind and senses. Our troubles arise because we cannot control them.
The great Master Sant Kirpal Singh Ji was often asked how we can establish lasting peace in the world. His reply was very simple: he said, “If kings rise above kingdoms, and priests above isms, there would be lasting peace. He did not teach any ism; he presented religion as a science. He would say if you are a Christian, be a true Christian: if you are a Sikh, be a true Sikh; if you are a Hindu, be a true Hindu. We can only do this when we lead ethical lives and live according to moral values. All religions command us to love our neighbors even our enemies. Only then can we fully understand the meaning of the Fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man. We are all brothers and sisters in God, therefore we should love each other irrespectively of our differences in religious beliefs, color, or social standing. If we do this then the Kingdom of God can come on earth. This can be achieved only through the grace and compassion of a living saint who has solved the mystery of life and death and can help others to do so.



APPENDIX VII-3_7: “Can We See God?” - An Interview with Sant Darshan Sing Ji (emphasis added) (continued)
Question #20: Do you have anything you would like to say in closing, perhaps something that may help us through our day?
The Master: We should all not only profess, but we should practice, having love and affection for all human beings, and not only for all human beings, but for the entire creation of God, because if we develop real love for the entire creation of God, then the question of any struggles and disparities will not arise. Once we have learned to sit together as brothers and sisters in the same God, then we will have eternal peace, eternal bliss, eternal ecstasy, eternal tranquIity and salvation. And if we are able to achieve this end, then we would be ensuring that the Kingdom of God can come on earth, because the universe will be full of love, full of affection, full of compassion; and well have love, humility and ethical life as our basis. This ethical basis consists of love for the entire creation, humility first, humility second and humility last, chastity and purity, because “blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God.” Besides this we should get rid of our ego, because mans ego is the root cause of all our struggles, all our afflictions and all the wars we have in the world. if only we recognize from the core of our hearts the unity of all mankind, we will not try to encroach upon the rights of others and we will be radiating love and compassion wherever we go. If we are able to achieve this object then there will be an end to all wars, an end to all struggles, an end to all conflicts, and we will have peace and bliss everywhere. That, I think, is the be-all and end-all of our lives.
This is a path in which we don’t have to play our part isolation. It is not a solo-play. We must have a community feeling and work for the good and benefit of all others amongst us. Here we should play our proper roles in the orchestra of life so that we have the symphony of love, the symphony of peace reverberating throughout the universe.
Hazur Baba Sawan Singh (1858-1948) was one of the greatest Masters ever to walk the earth. In 1903, he was commissioned to carry on the spiritual work by his own Master, Baba Jaimal Singh, thus continuing the line of Masters dating back, in the modern era, to Guru Nanak and Kabir Sahib. The path back to God, which was
known to only a small number before Hazur, was thrown open to millions of seekers, by the grace of the Master. Under Hazur’s direction and guidance the message of the Masters was first brought to America in 1911. As do all Masters, Hazur personally took on the karmas of his initiates. He left the earth in 1948, leaving the task of holy initiation to his spiritual successor, Sant Kirpal Singh. Many initiates of Hazur and Sant Kirpal Singh, as well as the new initiates of the present living Master Sant Darshan Singh, are blessed with the inner vision of Hazur.

APPENDIX VII-4: “Initiation” by Sant Kirpal Singh
For Whom is INITIATION
Certain persons are preordained or predestined by the Supreme Father (God Himself) to personally meet or otherwise have contact with a Living Master and obtain INITIATION. Such yearning souls are entitled to INITIATION during a lifetime when they are ready as a result of reactions of their past.
From Whom is INITIATION had
a. Qualified Endower
INITIATION can be had only from a Living Perfect Master in person or, through his authorized representative. The boon of INITIATION is only possible through His Grace. All Masters were INITIATED by their own Masters. Endowment of Life is made only when the individual comes in contact with the Living True Master on earth of his time or age.
b. Unqualified
INITIATION CANNOT be given by the invisible, unseen, and ascended masters, because Life comes from Life and Light comes from Light. Neither is it possible to be given by selfmade masters of the lower order of nature, nor by masters of esoteric teachings.
A person may be highly educated, intellectual, learned, righteous and\or pious, even perhaps recognized and known throughout the world, but he being enmeshed in the illusion of mind and matter cannot connect himself with the Divine Melody or Music. Only a Son knows the Father and others to whom the Son reveals Himself, or through his representative.
It is impossible to get INITIATION from religious scriptures as these are fine records of the findings and experiences of the past masters in knowing oneself and knowing the Oneself--God. They can create interest for achieving the higher life but cannot transmit the life spark which can be obtained only from the Living Master.
What is the INITIATION
INITIATION is the spark of “Naam” which can be had only from the Living Master.
At INITIATION the Living Perfect Master infuses the soul of the devotee with Higher Consciousness and Light. He grants the Life Impulse and assists the aspirant in
contacting the Audible Life Stream or Sound Principle, also known as the ‘Wordt’ of God, which remains with the disciple forever.
It is the “Word” Personified or the Master Power that gives INITIATION and at the time of INITIATION the Master takes His seat at the Third Eye of the Initiate and takes care of him henceforth. The accepted aspirants who are sincere and receptive during INITIATION do have a perceptible first-hand inner spiritual experience (there is a difference between the psychic and spiritual) at which time the Spiritual (Third) Eye is opened to see the Light of God and the Inner Ear is opened to hear the Voice of God, the Creative
Sound of the Beyond which has a soothing and healing effect. Occasionally, an aspirant may feel, for one reason or another, that the initial experience was lacking.

APPENDIX VII-4_2: “Initiation” by Sant Kirpal Singh (continued)
This could be due to over-excitement and inability to discern the more subtle type of experience granted such a person in line with his background. However, in due time, this individual receives a magnified experience(s) which erases any feeling of lack should such still exist. The Master Power from the moment of INITIATION, guides and protects one, even after the end of the world, and beyond.
This INITIATION is a personal lesson from the Great Master to the disciple, which lesson, when regularly and devotedly practiced by the Initiate, through the Grace of the Master, makes rising above the body consciousness possible.
Everything necessary is explained in detail at the time of INITIATION for the practice of Simran (Repetition), Contemplation, and Bhajan (listening to the ‘Voice of God” - the Sound Current), including an explanation of the opening of the Inner Eye and Inner Ear. The Master aids the disciple to transcend stage by stage until he reaches the final destination, his true Eternal Home. At INITIATION one is reborn. “Except ye be reborn, you cannot enter the Kingdom of God.”
What INITIATION does
INITIATION makes the disciple capable of higher spiritual living after the Master grants to him his Spiritual Life Impulse. The Life Impulse is also called the “Grant of Life.” INITIATION is also called a “baet” by the Moslem Faqirs (Mystics).
The Fifth Guru of the Holy Granth says:
“After giving Life Impulse They endow him with devotion to make him reach the Lord.”
The Master ultimately unites the soul with the Supreme Father. By the practices of “Naam,” the Mind ceases all its ramifications, and by and by, becomes fully controlled to enable one to know himself and be free from the wheel of Birth and Death.
Guru Nanak, Founder of the Sikh Religion says:
“Only the Living Master can connect one with the ‘ Word’, ‘Naam, or ‘Shabd.”
The scriptures say that we should therefore have shelter with a God-Man and put away all our cleverness.
Guru Nanak again says:
“That person is fortunate is whose mind the INITIATION resides or is established.”
No reasoning can bring home to a blind man the truth of a sun risen on the horizon. It is only when the Inner Eye (also known as the Third Eye or Single Eye) is opened by the Master at the time of INITIATION, that one is then convinced of the truth and is satisfied. Mere words will not satisfy the really thirsty and hungry souls. It does not matter where the Master is at the time of INITIATION. Regardless of whether the Master Himself is near at hand, or far away overseas, the Master Power always works. In case of distance, the authorized representative conveys the initiation instructions, generally in the morning hours.



APPENDIX VII-4: “Initiation” by Sant Kirpal Singh (continued)
Charities of INITIATION
When a disciple gets this link of “Naam” from the Living Master, he starts progressing on the Spiritual Path, and overcomes all his weaknesses and shortcomings by regular practice, and at the same time develops physically, morally and intellectually as well. His soul begins to rise into the higher heavenly planes and is not longer Earthbound. The gift of “Naam” is given only to yearning souls at the time of INITIATION, more or less, according to each individual’s background, as everyone has a different foundation. In some the ground is ready while in some it is still unprepared. It is through spiritual consciousness or cosmic awareness that the Light and Life give the ecstasy of Realization. It manifests more and more after INITIATION as the Initiate devotes regular time to meditation with loving devotion and he feels the fufiness and grace within himself. This seed of Holy “Naam” given the Master cannot be obliterated, or eradicated by the Negative Power. Whosoever has been initiated, finds sooner or later, that his spirituality is sprouting, so to speak, and surely one day he must reach his origina’ home, Sach Khand.
Unless a person gets INITIATION, he cannot get True Knowledge. “Truth” cannot be recognized.
The Sikh Bible (Holy Garanth) says:
“Without INITIATION from the Master, how can one get True KnowIedge?”
INITIATION by a Master involves His taking charge of a soul and winding up his or her Karmic debts in as smooth and helpful way as is best for the Initiate.
Guru Nanak says:
“What kind of ba!ance-weight, and what kind of goldsmith could I call, and from which Master could I get INITIATION? Who could value this Thing? When I met a True Master, personally I got INITIATION, sacrificed my mind, my body, and then had Inner Realization.”
QUOTATIONS ON INITIATION
“IN!TIATION BY THE Living Master had been formed as earring and Lord has been ingrained in it. Without INITIATION from the Master, how can one get knowledge; and without seeing, how can one contemplate on the invisible?”
Great Saint
“INITIATION has been talked about. and truth has been praised; how can INITIATION and Truth be preached? Those who have Guru Nanak know, for the Perfect Master gives the real IN!TIATION.”
Guru Nanak
“The Earth has nine paths....In the (Human) body is the whole world. The world pays homage at every step.”
Fifth Guru
“The Ocean of Attachment and Maya are dreadful as everyone is drowning or drifting. This attachment descends one into Transmigration and it brings him to the King Judge.”
THE EGYPTIAN MYSTERY “SCHOOL OF ON”, VOL. 1 BY GEORGE SINGLETON, ENLIGHTENMENT PUBLICATIONS, 2002 EDITION

APPENDIX VII-4_4: “Initiation” by Sant Kirpal Singh (continued)
If a devotee AFTER INITIATION is engaged in other pursuits like austerities and rituals his Attachment will NOT be broken or cut asunder. It is possible that neither Birth and Death will be finished in one lifetime, depending upon the circumstances.
Guru Nanak
“If a Master bestows His Grace, this Attachment goes away, and then one is merged into the Lord.”

APPENDIX VII-5: “Directions for Meditation” - by Sant Kirpal Singh
The body is the Temple of God, and God is Light. When we enter inside we will see the Light of God. We will first see if we can see the Light, if we can transcend the body. If you will follow these directions accurately, each one of you, I hope, will have some experience, with the Grace of my Master.
Sit in one posture. In any posture most convenient to you, in which you can sit longer. Do not change your posture. That is the first thing. When you sit, sit in a relaxed position, with no tension in the body. A relaxed position, naturally.
Close your eyes. Cease to look through these eyeballs, just as when you go to sleep, you leave out the outer eyes.
Don’t think of the body at all, whatsoever, nor of the outside environments. Leave out all thought of the body and the outside.
You will see some darkness. Even after that, there is something within that sees that darkness. Well, darkness is all over. We simply have to see with that something that is inside, with the inner eye, or the third eye, -- the single eye.
With that inner eye, you are to look into the middle of the darkness just lying within the space of the two eyebrows, you see.
From inside, outside. Look with the inner eye into the middle of the darkness, the space of the two eyebrows, minutely and penetratingly into the middle. Continue looking, constantly without a break. This is the first thing to be done.
Let there be no imagination, no presupposition, no visualization. Simply look into the middle of the darkness within, just lying between the two eyebrows with the inner eye; with no strain on the eyes or on the forehead, whatsoever. Become the eye itself. Look minutely, more minutely, still more minutely, constantly. This is the first thing to be done.
All those who have been Initiated, let them repeat the charged words given them, one by one, very slowly, mentally only, you see, with the mental tongue, so that your inner gaze is not disturbed, you see.
Continue looking minutely into the middle of the darkness just lying between the space lying between the two eyebrows and continues looking minutely, more minutely, still more minutely. All those who have not yet been Initiated, they just sit, in sweet remembrance of God.
Now sit down. Have one pose and don’t change. Keep your hands and feet anyway you like, but once you are seated, don’t change. Close your eyes. Give up all thought of the body. Look deeply into the darkness just lying between the eyebrows. Continue Iooking, minutely, more minutely, and still more minutely without a break.
Become the eye itself with no thought of the body outside. With no attention on the eyes or the forehead, please. With the inner eye look into the inner darkness just lying between the eyebrows. With sweet remembrance of God, very slowly repeat the charged words, so that you inner gaze is not disturbed.
Through the Grace of His Holiness.

APPENDIX VII-6: “Toward the New Education” by Sant Kirpal Singh
Man has been regarded as the crown and glory of this creation. ‘Not only is man at the origin of development, not only is he its instrument and beneficiary, but above all he must be regarded as its justification and end.” Man, as Lord Jesus told us, whom God made in his own image, should prove a worthy recipient of His blessings. But alas! The man of today has belied most of our expectations. Increasingly, his vanity has led him to regard himself as the center of the world, and made him oblivious to his shortcomings. The education system which could have remedied all ailments and promoted his all round development has proved woefully inadequate. Somehow a student of today is unable to get true knowledge, which could have helped him to acquire the right understanding of life resulting in right thoughts, right speech and right action. in fact, the real aim of education is to develop the character and individuality of a pupil, his mind, will and soul power. The best education is that which teaches us that the end of knowledge is service.
This “service” is another name for love and fellowship; which constitute the very essence of personal and sociaI life. Love and fellowship bring with them peace, gentleness and humility, basic values of life whose significance has been repeatedly stressed by the sages and prophets of India and the world. To nurture these values, to practice them, and to adopt them wholeheartedly in life, is what is known as Spirituality. "Spirituality” is not a name of a few religious dogmas. In fact, there is no room for dogmatic assertion in spiritual life. Once Huen Tsang put a question to Shil Bhadra, the head of the Nalanda University: “What is Knowledge?” He replied, “My child, knowledge is perception of the principles or laws of life. And the best principle of life is fellow-feeling sharing with others what you have.” He says that those who cook food for themselves alone are thieves. Jesus once asked his disciples, “What does it profit a man if he were to gain the whole world and lose his own soul?” The voice in them which brought forth the answer, “None, Jesus, none,’ was the voice of Spirituality. The tenth Guru says,” Those who put food in the mouths of the poor and the needy, they put it in my mouth.”
This capacity to share is known as Spirituality, without which all education is a sheer exercise in futility. As Gentile, a great thinker, says, ‘A school without a spiritual content is an absurdity." Modern education is largely egocentnc and makes men spiritually and socially incompetent; and they enter life with a view to gaining money on earth and applause for their own personal enjoyment, forgetting that true happiness begins only when one goes out of one’s little self - the ego - and seeks the larger self.

APPENDIX VII-6: “Toward the New Education” by Sant Kirpal Singh (continued)
The most important thing about education is it relation to life. “Knowledge without action is empty as a shadow.” “Education is not a withered parchment but the Living Water of the Spirit." The school should be a home teachers and students who reflect in their studies, and the and in their daily lives, the cherished virtue of humilIty. Till our knowledge enables us to imbibe the noble th[ngs of life, it has not served its purpose. Al-Ghazali, a man of scholarship and meditation, says in his book Child, “Know, my child, that knowledge without action is insanity, and the noblest action is service."
The chief malady of current education is that it results in the disassociation of heart and head. It lays emphasis on the development of head, and does sharpen the inteIlect to some extent. But more essential is the liberation of the heart.That will be done when the reason is awakened in sympathy for the poor, the weak and the needy. Sacrifice grows out of the hearts, so the heart is required to be unfolded.
The young should: (I) strive after the ideal of sacrifice and not emotions; (ii) be simple, for simplicity is strength; (iii) learn to cooperate with all, and not let differences in creed or political opinions stand in the way of solidarity; (iv) accept the creative ideal, which regards humanity as one and service as the end of all knowledge. Teachers should train students in the spirit of sympathy and love, blending information with inspiration and knowledge with love. A man may pass university examinations and yet remain ignorant of the realities of life. He may have read a thousand books, yet be no better than a boor. But true education will make him truly cultured; and the soul of culture is courtesy. Scholarship may be proud; culture is humble.
Paradoxically enough, culture and agriculture are srmilar in many ways. The souls Kshetra [field] must be cultivated by disciplining desires and emotions. Who could have put it better than Buddha who, while dilating on the analogy, observed, "I piow and sow and grow, and from my plowing and sowing, reap immortal fruit. My field is religion; the weeds pick up are passions my plow is wisdom; my seed is purity.” Our Rishis have prayed, Tamso ma Jyotirgamaya (“Lead ne from darkness to light.”).
But this darkness cannot be illumined in just a day. Bricks, mortar, comforts and luxuries cannot give any such training. It is the proper atmosphere which can deliver the goods; that is way emphasis in the school should be on atmosphere more than on rules, textbooks and buildings.
The tender heart of a child calls for very delicate handling. In fact, education begins even before birth and therefore better care must be bestowed upon every pregnant mother. It is a constant association with gentle forces which breeds virtuous persons. A child is the center of creative life. It needs to be opened as a flower is opened, gently, by sympathy not by force. Do not let the child be imprisoned in the examination machine; never let him be snubbed and scolded.
The fruits of fellowship are four-fold. The first fruit is Artha, which indicates the economic aspect of education. The second is Dharmo, which preaches reverence for law. Kama provides for the freer and fuller growth of human beings. The most important is, of course, the fourth fruit, Moksha, the complete liberation. This is liberation from our petty selves, which impels us to shed all our bigotry, narrowmindedness, and chauvinism. If education does not enable us to raise ourseives from the levels of our ordinary selves, our average minds to heights above our normal vision, it does not fulfill it’s very purpose. It is a lamentable fact that present education, which should insure an integrated growth of human personality, provides a very incomplete and insufficient preparation for life.

APPENDIX VII-6_3: “Toward the New Education” by Sant Kirpal Singh (continued)
In this process, the situation of the school also plays a major role. The German word kindergarten is quite suggestive in this context. Kinder means child, and garten, indicating that every school should be situated in a lovely spot of nature. In ancient India, every Ashram was a garden of nature. The Manav Kendra is situated at a healthy and picturesque spot in the Doon Valley, presenting a glorious and tempting view of the snow-clad peaks of the Himalayas. In the true tradition of Manav Kendra - the Man Center - it belongs to all mankind for the creation of understanding, peace, and progress.
The institution is dedicated to the concrete realization of human unity and is projected as an entirely new concept of integral education and moral lying according to the ethics of spirituality. Human body is the true Temple of God. God resides in the temple of the body made by Him in the womb of the mother, and not in the temples made by the hands of man.
Without an inner change, man can no longer cope with the all-round development of his life. To accomplish this vital and indispensable task, the very nature of education has to be transformed so that it can give society young men and women who are not only intellectually but emotionally trained for vigorous, realistic and constructive leadership. We envisage such an atmosphere where persons will be able to grow and develop integrally without losing contact with their souls.
The aim is to make it a place where the needs of the spirit and concern for human progress will take precedence over material satisfactions, pleasures and enjoyment. Certainly the education will have to be spiritually oriented and given, not with a view to passing examinations, getting certificates and diplomas, and seeking employment, but for enriching the existing moral, ethical and other faculties and opening up new vistas and horizons to fulfill the dream of Reality.

APPENDIX VIII-1: Description of BRCA\Hope LA-USA Project: “Planting Seeds of Hope in Our Inner Cities” By Anna Bond
When, people are starving, it is because their governments take too much, Causing them to starve. When people are hard to control, it is because of the contrivances of their governments, Which makes them hard to control. When people think little of death. it is because those above think so much of life thus the people think little of death.
—Lao-Tzu: Tao Te Ching
The CIA-Contra-Cocaine connection exposed by San Jose Mercury News’ reporter Gary Webb should not have shocked us as it did. Drugs, weapons and moneylaundering have always been tools of the trade for U.S. clandestine operations abroad. This most recent “dark alliance,” as Webb termed it, is simply another episode in the long saga of American trade in drugs, guns, dollars, and human lifeonly this time the life that trafficking victimized was African-American inner city youth.
From all appearances, it was targeted genocide. But what goes around comes around, and a short twenty-two years after crack cocaine made its first documented appearance in California, we have small Vermont towns with nothing that could even be called a street hosting street gangs and crack cocaine.
Somehow the pipeline between Columbia’s cocaine cartels and the black neighborhoods of South Central L.A. opened by CIA-backed Contras and Nicaraguan drug-smugglers recalls the infamous Triangle Trade, which laid the foundations for the fortunes of the future leaders of the United States.
Here the commodities are cocaine, crack and guns. There they were sugar, rum and slaves. Then and now, we see mindless destruction of human life and soils, mere means toward the acquisition of wealth and the control of the people by a powerful elite.
In the late eighteenth century, ships left New England loaded mostly with rum. In Africa the rum was exchanged for as many slaves as it would buy (often at the rate of 200 gallons per slave). Loaded with slaves, the ship set sail for the West Indies where the slaves were sold to the sugar plantations and part of the profit invested in molasses. On the final leg of the voyage, the vessel would carry the molasses back to New England, to be distilled into more run, to buy more slaves. 1
How much is a human life worth? Two hundred gallons of rum: absolutely equal for the purposes of trade! The damage to human society in Africa and the Caribbean as well as the soil destruction on the sugar plantations was never taken into account. _______________________________________________________

APPENDIX VIII_2: Description of BRCA\Hope LA-USA Project: “Planting Seeds of Hope in Our Inner Cities” By Anna Bond
In addition to the profits from the basic Triangle Trade, the American colonies supplied food staples for feeding the sugar plantation slaves. In 1770, for instance, the colonies exported to the Caribbean one third of their dried fish, almost all of their pickled fish, most of their oats, corn, peas and beans as well as half their flour and all their butter and cheese. 2
Ultimately, the Triangle Trade like the current Dark Alliance reveals an insidious mind set that treats everything—top soils, sugarcane, coca leaves, human life—as commodities or substances to be trafficked. 3 Using things as substances—rather than respecting their inherent value—invariably leads to addiction. Addiction to gold and sliver, addiction to sugar, addiction to alcohol and drugs: these were—Ad continue to be—the driving forces behind the exploitation of resources—be they natural or human—in the New World as well as the modes operandi behind American trade’ relations.
Eventually even money loses relevance as the trafficking takes on a life of its own. During the heyday of the CIA-contra-cocaine connection, between the passage and repeal of the Boland Amendment, in 1986, every market indicator of the cocaine glut in America went off-scale. As Wanda Palacio, the Puerto Rican-born airline employee whose two-year cocaine trafficking career spanned her relationship with an upperclass Colombian whose social circle included “people deeply involved in the drug trade,” astutely observed in 1987: “Three years ago [before Boland], the price of cocaine was $50,000 per kilo. Today it is $20,000 and sometimes you can get it for $15,000 to $18,000. The market for the cocaine isn’t smaller—so the lower price is a result of having supply increase even more than demand has. 4
“It got to the point where it was like, man, use don t want to count no more money.”
— Freeway Rick Ross
Rick Ross, a black teenager, was a talented tennis player with a promising future. Then his tennis coach discovered Rick could neither read nor write. Rick saw his dream of a college scholarship evaporate, which leads to some pointed questions. Would the coach of a white teenager have been unaware until the last lap that his student was illiterate? Having lost his one chance for a better life, Ross hung his future on drugs and became Freeway Rick, a dealer of mythical proportions in the L.A. underground. later sentenced to life with no chance for parole on cocaine conspiracy charges.

APPENDIX VIII_3: Description of BRCA\Hope LA-USA Project: “Planting Seeds of Hope in Our Inner Cities” By Anna Bond
Freeway Rick’s story epitomizes the three-pronged plight of inner city youth. First, there is epidemic subclinical malnutrition stemming from poverty, lack of nutritional awareness, the proliferation of junk foods and drugs. Fast food franchises dot black neighborhoods everywhere—serving up their brand of super-refined, nutritionally empty foods devoid of any real identity no trace minerals, no vitamins, no essential oils, no DNA to connect us to the earth and the soil. These are foods that enslave us and addict us: white sugar, white flour, white bread, white fat, white salt, white crack.
Poor nutrition means your brain doesn’t work well, remember things, make appropriate decisions. After seven generations of eating such food, we have lost our memory of who we are, where we came from and where we are going. No wonder the infant mortality rate in South Central rivals that of some Third World countries. Taoist Sage and social commentator Lao-Tzu, writing over 2500 years ago, says it best: how can you really care about life or death when you’re starving? “Thinking little about death," many people turn to the euphoria of drugs.
The second handicap impacting inner city youth is the lack of opportunities and options that comes with widespread poverty. There is virtually no chance to find a decent job, let alone meaningful work. Poverty gives you no options to switch schools, get special tutoring. Poverty leads to crime. Rick Ross grew up poor in Troup, Texas, then moved to South Central L.A., where he slipped into a career of drug dealing. When you don’t know where your next meal’s coming from, you think little of death—or life.
And third, we see clearly unequal education or, more accurately, blatant miseducaflon both in the schools and in the media That miseducation breeds cultural, ethnic and racial discrimination. When you see yourself as lesser, then you have adopted somebody else’s image of who you are. Not knowing who you really are makes it tough to be yourself or control yourself.
While most of the country is talking about accountability, people’s tribunals, justice, restitution and compensation, one visionary African American activist is transforming inner city hood areas into lush market gardens that incorporate pre-dynastic Egyptian blo-intensive deep bed agricultural technology, intercropped ‘floating’ gardens reminiscent of pre-Columbian Mexico, and three-tiered permacultured beds.
He is George Singleton: radical in the sense of going to the roots of the disease that perpetuates slavery. And those roots are the three pronged plight that is crippling our inner city youth: 1) the poverty/crime connection, 2) the subclinical malnutrition/addictions syndrome and 3) the vicious miseducation/discrimination cycle.
In 1974, the year crack cocaine made its first appearance, underground in San Francisco and Nicaraguan drug smugglers hooked up with Colombian drug sellers, George broke new ground for his first Blacqendian (Black and Indian) rural development cooperative in the Washington DC area. Soon afterward, George was recognized by Navajo leaders as the one who had been prophesied to teach them the old ways of gardening. He lived and studied with his the Navajo elders for seven years

APPENDIX VIII_4: Description of BRCA\Hope LA-USA Project: “Planting Seeds of Hope in Our Inner Cities” By Anna Bond
In 1981, just two years before Freeway Rick figured out how to blow up one kilo of cocaine into three or more of crack, the executive members of Louis Farrakan’s (Black Muslim) Temple 27 brought George from the Navajo Reservation to Los Angeles to design nutritional programs and gardens for their congregation of 2500.
From his intensive study of the Annu/Egyptian Mystery School practices, George helped the congregation align their diet to be harmony with the vegetarian ideals of Elijah Mohammed. Synthesizing what had been revealed to him among the Navajo and what he had earned from his Egyptian research, George developed an intensive biological gardening technology.
By 1 985, that technology had produced a garden on the temple rooftop that provided food for the entire congregation. Biological gardening is distinct from—and more universally practicable than—organic in that it does not depend on animal manures with their questionable microbial contaminants (E. coil) and agrochemical pollutants (herbicides, fungicides and pesticides used in animal fodder).
Where organic animal-based comporting demands high-temperature bacterial breakdown, large quantities of water and frequent labor intensive turning, biological gardening relies on low-temperature bacteria! recycling of green wastes and, above all, that “foundation of all civilization” (ecologist Andre Voisin) the earthworm, who since before the time of Christ has been revered and protected as “sacred" (Cleopatra). Earthworm castings create a humus topsoil of the highest fertility, filth and biological vitality more efficiently than any other means. Biological gardening is the gardening method practiced historically in Meso-America by the Mayans and Olmecs and continuing into the present in the Nile Valley, the headwaters of the Amazon in Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru; and in Hunzaland.
Recognizing the intrinsic connection between a people’s culture and agriculture, George developed a powerful urban agri-forestry model—now called Hope LA\USAbased on the need to break away from anima!-based farming with its inherent limitedresources, scarcity mind set that inevitably breeds struggle and conflict. He also developed this three-pronged mode! to provide simple, sustainable solutions to each of the three handicaps that paralyze the majority of our youth at risk today.
In 1987 the cocaine-rated deaths of two B!ack athletes prompted national hysteria and tough new crack laws that impacted U. S. Blacks with extreme inequality. The U.S. Congress voted to give the Contras $100 million in military aid. Danilo Blandon, son of wealthy Nicaraguan slumlord and Ross drug connection, was arrested, then released only a month later when the Iran-Contra scandal broke.
That same year a prominent South Central resident and social psychologist urged George to offer his genius and charisma to address the genocidal explosion of gang violence and crack use among youth at risk. From his years among the Navajo, George knew the extraordinary healing power gardening he’d for youth out of touch with nature and themselves.

APPENDIX VIII_5: Description of BRCA\Hope LA-USA Project: “Planting Seeds of Hope in Our Inner Cities” By Anna Bond
A quarter-acre biological garden at the famous Children’s Space Educational Center in Compton was succeeded by pilot biological gardens all over Los Angeles County. George’s striking dreadlocked figure—shouldering forks, shovels, pickaxes, even sacks of peat moss and earthworms to sites sometimes 20 miles apartbecame a familiar presence.
The super tree, the tissue-cultured Chinese Paulownia hardwood, shoots up 15 feet per year under ideal conditions and is valued at $1000 per cubic meter of timber! Aside from providing organic produce to the neighborhood, the Hope LA garden expanded the greening area in the midst of South Central’s asphalt battleground, It offered the youth involved the time and place to reconnect with nature, with the source of their food and with themselves.
George developed a brilliant sustainable life science curriculum that was at once a nonlinear education program that looked deeply at the political, economic and nutritional aspects of what has been called the “criminalization" of inner city life around the world and a hands-on apprenticeship in the high art and science of biological gardening which, at the close of the two-year program, gave the youth solid marketable horticultural skills.
Then in 1993 came perhaps the most potent agent for regenerating these youths’ malnourished bodies and drug-toxic immune systems. George started feeding Super Blue Green Algae, a wild super food harvested Klamath Lake, to the youth he was training. The changes were dramatic! Caseworkers observed better over-all health, improved school and work performance, greater clarity of thought and expression, sounder sleep, and a sense of new found joy and cooperation where before there had been apathy and distrust.
George’s Project in South Central was so successful he was invited to teach 160 third time offenders aged 14-19 in a youth detention facility in San Fernando Valley. Dispensing the daily Super Blue Green Algae to these youth, the Charge Nurse was enthusiastic about the potential of this wild super food. Her observations demonstrated not only the undeniable connection between poor nutrition and criminal behavior but also the incredible ability to restore vibrant health, strong immune response and a sense of bright hope simply eating this wild Algae could offer.
Almost four years later, George’s gardening model has evolved to integrate the deep beds with greenhouse covered algae ponds that provide abundant algae fertilizer and create microclimates outdoors—a novel concept indeed. George travels across the country to inner city neighborhoods, prisons, schools, reservations that ask for his expertise and his wisdom. He has projects at various stages of completion in over twenty states across the country.
Wherever he goes, George offers the gift of his technology of hope freely, without charge. His Hope LA/USA garden projects are funded through his Super Blue Green Algae network business and the sale of his videos, tapes and book.

Providing Super Blue Green Algae to gang and at risk youth, caseworkers noticed many changes: in patterns of increased sleep, awakening with vitatity, clearness of thought, improved schoot and work performance, and a sense of new found hope. The Project in South Centrat was so successfut that George was contracted to teach his program at the Camp Holton youth detention facility in San Fernando Vatley. This facitity housed 160 third time offenders aged 14 to 19, sixty percent of whom were Hispanic and African American from South Central.
For a two-month period, youth participating in the Camp Hotton ‘Brown Thumb Green Thumb Program" received Super Blue Green Algae. dispensed daily by the Camp’s charge nurse. Her observations clearly demonstrated the connection beiween poor nutrition and criminal behavior.
Today George’s gardening model has evolved to integrate the deep beds with greenhouse covered algae ponds that provide abundant algae fertilizer and create microclimates outdoors—a novel concept indeed. George travels across the country to inner city neighborhoods, prisons, schools, reservations that ask for his expertise and his wisdom.
The success of this program in Los Angeles led to changes in the funding strategy. The program addressed the needs of inner city people across the country. Thus, in September, 1995 the HOPE L.A. Project became the HOPE LA\USA Project, initiating the development of Sustainable Agri-Forests in 25 states.
The Project’s current Sustainable Agri-Forestry model encompasses ten interrelated aspects:
1. Spiritual Economics 2. Sustainable Life Science Curriculum 3. Intensive Vermiculture 4. Deep Intensive Growing Beds 5. Biological Horticulture 6. Three-tier Permaculture 7. Biological Aqua-Culture a.PiMag Water Irrigation b.Greenhouse covered Algae Ponds 8. Non-profit Organization Innovative Funding 9. Food Fortification with Nutritional Herbs 10.

Paulownia “Super Tree” SAF in the Peoples’ Republic of China
George W. Singleton has been Executive Project Director of the Blacqendian Royal Coop Association (BCRA), Inc. since 1980. He received a B.A. in General Biology from the University of Chicago (1970) and a Doctor of Herbology (HD.) Degree from the LA, CA. based International Monastery: University of Eternal Light Consciousness (1986) under the apprenticeship direction of Alfred “Dr. Roots” Patterson, HD..
Since 1979 Singleton has directed chronic poverty abatement research, development and demonstrations concentrating on ancient Egyptian culture and technologies including 3 federal grants. From 1988 to 1995 Singleton was the Volunteer Horticultural Instructor at the Los Angeles, CA. John Hope Continuation High School. His work is highlighted by the USDA/ Forest Service Grant #92-LA-5 funding of the BRCA/Hope LA Horticultural Corps from 1992 to 1995 demonstrating Sustainable Agri-Forestry (SAF) utilizing South Central-Watts, LA gang and “at risk” youth and young adults.
Singleton adapted SAF to address the present problems in the present urban community garden movement; i.e. as the basis of the next generation of urban community gardens capable of producing the horticultural assets to purchase its land sites and provide significant livable wage jobs. The holistic 12 element SAF model annually can generate on one (1) acre of land minimally 150,000 pounds of “organic” produce and other horticultural products and providing 4 full time jobs at twice the minimal wage as training stipend .
Sustainable Agri-Forestry (SAF) as exemplified in ancient Egypt, ancient Israel and preColumbian Mexico, Peru and North America can significantly ameliorate chronic poverty wherever properly installed at a one time cost of $85,000 per acre and operated on a “worker member” cooperative model. SAF is a technological forte in the modern Republic of China and a foundation of its emerging super power economy.
Since 1995 Singleton has transferred SAF technology and demonstrations to organizations in over 13 states via the BRCA/Hope LA-USA Project (HLAUSAP), Inc. The SAF model was certified for federal funding eligibility in the USDOL Welfare to Work Competitive Grant Competition 1999 Round #3 in CA., AZ., CT., NY., TN. and the Navajo/Dine’ Indian Nation. Singleton presented the SAF model to the 1997 State of the World Forum/Sustainable Agriculture Roundtable, and is State of the World Forum Member #20827 (presented at http:\\www.worldforum.org.)
The BRCA/HLAUSAP Web Site http:\\www.hopelausa.org is a complete self-help Sustainable Agri-Forestry Technical Assistance Transfer Center.

AKHENATEN (AKHENATON, AKHNATON, IKHNATON, AMENHOTEP IV) & NEFERTITI
exoterically the 18th Dynasty Egyptian Pharaoh and Queen from 1353-36 BC, Ancient Egyptian Mystery SCHOOL OF ON (ANNU) trained SUN PEOPLE ("ChiIdren of the Light”), Adam and Eve as "ONE-FLESH" Royal Couple and extended family; just recently rediscovered in 1908 in the beginning of "Modern Egyptology"; founded the “model city" of Akhetaten (Amarna) on the Nile River near the modern village of El Amarna, Egypt; known for its unmatched art, crafts and urban architecture replete with GARDENS/ SUSTAINABLE AGRI-FORESTS; credited with the establishment of the first
monotheistic religion called the ATEN PATH; Psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud’s last book Moses and Monotheism has Akhenaten and Moses as contemporary peers of the same monotheistic ATEN PATH religion and recently Oman Ahmen’s Moses and Akhenaten declares them as the same; and esoterically Pharaoh Akhenaten and Queen Nefertiti were involved in a bitter Civil War with the corrupt THEBAN "SORCERY" LODGE of priests and priestesses, whom they tried to suppress wherein they were both initially slandered and later "written out of history" beginning at least upon the enigmatic death and burial at 19 years of age of their son and successor to the throne Pharaoh Tutankhamen in circa 1337 BC; they were the last strong SCHOOL OF ON (ANNU) and ATEN PATH practicing ANNU PHARAOH and Queen; who abdicated from the throne in circa 1350 BC along with his parents Pharaoh Amenhotep III And Queen Tiy according to Sigmund Freud (ibid, essay 1) at the same time of MOSES’ Biblical "Exodus."
See Appendix I-A; Appendix V; Exhibit III_F-1_2, Exhibit III_F-3_4, Exhibit III_G-1, Exhibit III_G-2, Exhibit III_G-3; and Pages xv, xvi, xix, xx, xxi, 2, 3, 4, 14, 39, 40, 42, 62 & 74. Refer to ANNU and THEBES WARS, ANNU PHARAOH, ATEN PATH, GARDENS/SAF, MOSES.
AMELINEAU, ABBE’ EMILE

classic books in French the 1899 Les Nouvelles Fouvelles d Abvdos and the 1916 Prolegomenes’ a l’etude de la religion egyptienne had English translated excerpts included in CHEKH ANKA DIOP’S African Origin of Civilization; and
esoterically Amelineau was influenced by the "Aboriginal Anu People Theory"’ of the first
Egyptologist JEAN CHAMPOLLION, and thus he extended Champollion’s theory nearly 50 years after it had been stalled by the latter’s untimely death; was blocked from further research at the Abydos Predynastic burial site that he had first discovered, being replaced by British Egyptologist Flinders
Petrie; his "Anu People as founders of ancient Egypt’s civilization theories” were discredited by fellow French Egyptologist Gaston Maspero and ignored by the conventional Egyptologists to this day. See Exhibit I_K & Exhibit IV_F-1 and Pages xv, 1, 2, 13, 16, 25 & 70. Refer to ANU PEOPLES, ANU "LEGACY STOLEN"; CHEKH ANKA DIOP & JAMES, GEORGE.

esoterically in ancient Egypt/Kemit the THEBAN "SORCERY" LODGES which worshipped AMEN (ego) the “unknowable god and OSIRIS (sexual perversion) the "body resurrection god"; this cult feeds upon the ego and sexual perversion eccentricities of people exemplified by fascism and racism, and the use of sexual orgy, sadistic and masochistic and blood rituals exemplified by animal sacrifices, human puberty rituals of circumcision and clitoralectomy, human sacrifices and cannibalism; worshipped originally by the Neanderthals who first began burial of the dead and were cannibalistic, and now called on by the successors of the SCYTHlAN/"SNAKE"/PEOPLE.

AMENSES WOMEN/EARTH GODDESSES exoterically this "sans menstruation condition" is considered historically by allopathic medical
doctors (MD) as an abnormal syndrome, perhaps needing brain surgery and hormonal therapy e.g. "birth control pills"; partly this medical misconception exists because doctors confuse it with "amenorrhea” where the failure to have menses continues for months because of extreme congestion of the body’s eliminative systems from abnormal body waste and toxins from improper nutrition, environmental pollution and eating agri-chemicallv grown and chemically processed refined food; and esoterically this ORIGINAL CONDITION of women denotes a "supra-healthy" and highly spiritual women, due largely from their adherence to strict VEGAN/VEGETARIAN dietary laws, inner and outer body hygiene, "POSITIVE CELIBACY” via abstinence from vaginal and avoidance of anal intercourse, and use of platonic love relationships as practiced by the priestesses of the SCHOOL OF ON (ANNU); where the monthly menstrual period can decrease to 3 days and even down to one hour of clear mucus flow; also exemplified by the women of the ancient ESSENE Israelites symbolized in the “immaculate conception” by Mary borning Jesus Christ, whose female aspirants’ induction into the higher Essenian Orders was contingent upon their attainment of this sacred purification; historically women of the Navajo/Dine’ Native Americans and Hunza Province of Pakistan, and in modern times occurs often amongst the best female athletes and highly spiritually evolved girls and women; and recently revived by the books of Arnold Ehret’s Mucusless Diet Healing System (1934) and Vjktoras Kulvinskas’ Survival into the 21 St Century (1972).

PRIESTESSES which selected the ANNU PHARAOH for 9,777 years; however after centuries of late Pre-Dynastic Period bitter wars against the THEBAN INVADER PEOPLE/DARK RED RACE a duopriesthood theocracy wielded power in the subsequent Dynastic Period; and the invader peoples THEBAN “SORCERY” LODGE competed peacefully but aggressively for the right to place a Theban Pharaoh in the position of “King-Priest” or Pharaoh of Ancient Egypt/Kemit with this “peaceful” theocratic struggle between the SCHOOL OF ON (ANNU) and the THEBAN “SORCERY” LODGE
breaking-down periodically into civil disobedience, “invader” (outside the aboriginal NINE BOW TRIBAL NATIONS/EGYPTIAN CONFEDERACY) assisted civil wars and regular civil wars including:

“Aakhun” George Singleton Louise E. Hall
Board Member/Co-Chairperson Honorary Board Member
President & Secretary
PRESS RELEASE: An Author/Poet/Musician/Developer/Gardener “Aakhun” George Singleton
The CD-ROM e-Book 2004 Signed Limited Edition of The Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu): Esoteric Atannuology, Egyptology and Rastafariology, Volume I, ISBN 09741724-0-5 is one of divine inspiration whereupon “Aakhun” George Singleton was used by the Godhead Annu to synthesize a composite literary picture of the aboriginal Anu People of the Nile Valley and the surrounding Garden of Eden, their culture, religion and history embodied in the School of On (Annu) of Ancient Egypt/Kemit which have for eons been hidden, destroyed and falsified.
Aakhun was born January 13, 1949 in Charlotte, North Carolina. Ethnically he is African American (Black) and Native American (Mississippi Choctaw\North Carolina Cherokee Indian), African Moor; i.e., Black Indian or “Blacqendian.” He is a graduate of Shortridge High School in Indianapolis, Indiana (1966) with major in science and minor in history in a college preparatory curriculum. He is a holder of a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree from the University of Chicago (1970), majoring in general biology with a minor in history. He has also taken courses in biological medicine (having matriculated in dental and medical schools) and systems analysis from several universities.
In 1986 he was given a Doctorate in Herbology (D.H.) from the International Monastery: The University of Eternal Light Consciousness; Los Angeles, CA based on his development work in “biological agriculture” and dietetics applied to sickness prevention and cure, utilizing the ancient Egyptian instrument the pendulum (today termed - “radiesthetics\radionics”) and documenting the origin of the “bio-lntensive” gardening system as of predynastic Egypt; he has demonstrated the benefits of “experimental anthropology.”
Having been a studier and lecturer of “Black (people of color) History” since 1966, Mr. Singleton has been forced by fate initially and later of his own design, to follow a self-taught “generalist” as opposed to “specialist” approach to education, occupation and personal growth endeavors. He has observed the Western culture’s “divide and conquer” techniques are the basis to exploitation of native peoples (colonialism, neocolonialism, and indiscriminate arms manufacturing and sales), and exploitation of nature (e.g., air, water and soil pollution, humus top soil erosion, animal genocide). That is, fragmented ‘PH.D.” specialist information instead of holistic knowledge is identified as the specific “divide and conquer” technlque\medium used in the support of racism and other prejudices leading to the present “earth crisis” of fascism, environmental degradation, ignorance and hate threatening all life on the planet.
Consequently, Singleton is a Baptist, Bahai’, Black Muslim and “Blacqendian” Rastafarian, studying comparative social religion. He is a practitioner of the Science of Spirituality\Surat Shabd\Light and Sound Yoga meditation, being initiated in this surviving Asian-Indian Mystery System by Sant Darshan Singh Ji in 1976. His comparative history “hobby” and interest in Black History have led him to a study of Egyptology and “biological history.”
The more than 20 years of research and synthesis upon which Singleton based this book, has been supported by Blacqendian Royal Coop Association (BRCA)\Synergistic Research and Development. BRCA is a community, human and land development cooperative, founded and directed by Singleton since 1974. BRCA distributes its services through the network nonprofit Hope LA\USA Project.
As “messenger of the Light” or “Aakhun,” Singleton is dedicated to spreading the knowledge of the “original condition of HU-mans”; encompassing the original Light and Sound Yoga known as the “Path of Atannu” in Ancient Egypt/Kemit, shedding “light” on proper human life style, culture and spirituality which will end the “earth crisis.” As such the Ancient Egyptian Mystery School of On (Annu) must and is being virtually “reimplemented” virtually on the Web Site http://www.hopelausa.org.
Singleton became a member of the State of the World Forum in 1997 as Member # 20827.
