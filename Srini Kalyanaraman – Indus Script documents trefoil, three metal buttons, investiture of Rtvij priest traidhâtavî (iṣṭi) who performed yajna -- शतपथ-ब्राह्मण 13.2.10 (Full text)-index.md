Indus Script documents trefoil, three metal buttons, investiture of Rtvij priest traidhâtavî (iṣṭi) who performed
yajna -- शतपथ-ब्राह्मण 13.2.10 (Full text)
-- Archaeological evidence is provided of a gold button with interior loop to attach to clothing. Three such buttons, of tridhatu,three metals - copper, silver and gold -- trefoil on Mohenjo-daro priest's shawl, uttariyam are demonstrated.
-- The fillets worn on the forehead and right-shoulder of the priest signify him a portray him as पोतृ pot ̥r 'purifier priest',
पोतदार potadāra, ପ ୋଦ୍ଦୋର୍ poddār 'assayer of metals' (Marathi. Oriya) pot 'gold bead' PLUS dāra 'string, thread', together, potadāra
-- The embroidery tradition of Traidhâtavî (iṣṭi) of investiture ceremony for Potr with trefoils on his uttariyam -- in the concluding celebration of a yajna - continues into historical periods with trefoils adorning handicrafts made by artisans and embroideries of Kutch even today. शतपथ-ब्राह्मण 13.2.10 Tenth Brāhmaṇa (Full text appended) details how three metal coins are stitched into the uttariyam of the priest during the investiture ceremony for having successfully completed the yajna.
--Archaeological evidence of Indus Script proves the date of शतपथ-ब्राह्मण investiture of priests to be prior to 4th millennium BCE https://tinyurl.com/yacayrjh Harappan Gold from the 2000-2001 Excavations:
1. A button or sequin made of thin gold foil with a small interior loop for attachment to clothing. This piece was found crumpled into a small wad, possibly in preparation for remelting to make a new ornament.
2. Composite gold bead with copper-alloy core or wire on interior. The corroded copper still covers part of the tubular gold bead.
3. A collection of gold beads, three of which (UL, UR, LL) have copper-alloy in their interiors. The corroding copper often breaks the softer gold foil.
4. These two gold bead were originally part of the same ornament. Thin gold foil was placed over the outside of a sandy core around a copper tube. From our recently upgraded 90 Slide Show Harappa Excavations 2000-2001 at https://www.harappa.com/slideshows/harappa-2000-2001

1. When they prepare the knife-paths, the Sacrificer makes for himself that passage across, a bridge, for the attainment of the heavenly world.

2. They prepare them by means of needles; the needles, doubtless, are the people (clans), and the Asvamedha is the royal power: they thus supply him with people and royal power combined. They are made of gold: the meaning of this has been explained. 3. Three kinds of needles are (used), copper ones, silver ones, and gold ones;--those of copper, doubtless, are the (principal) regions (of the compass), those of silver the intermediate ones, and those of gold the upper ones: it is by means of these (regions) they render it fit and proper. By way of horizontal and vertical (stitches 1) they are many-formed, whence the regions are manyformed; and they are of distinct form, whence the regions are of distinct form. Note: On people (clans): Viz. because of the large number and the small size (insignificance) of the needles, or wires, (and the common people). On 'stitches' (on the robe?): It is doubtful what word, if any, has to be supplied here,--perhaps it means, by way of their being (in sewing) horizontal and vertical. The commentary is silent on this passage. https://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/sbr/sbe44/sbe44092.htm
13.3.4 FOURTH BRÂHMANA

अयियेन चरुणा तृतीयामाहुसतं जुिोसत आयास्या वै प्रजा रुद्रः न्तस्वष्ट्कृ त्प्रजा एव रुद्रादिदगधासत तिाैत्रद्यषाऽश्वमेध आहुसतगर्हयते न तत्र रुद्रः प्रजा अस मन्यते - १३.३.४.[५]
3. The first oblation (of blood) he offers 2 in the throat (gullet) of the Gomriga 1; for Gomrigas are cattle, and the Svishtakrit is Rudra: he thus shields the cattle from Rudra, whence Rudra does not prowl after the cattle where this oblation is offered at the Asvamedha. 4. The second oblation 1 he offers on a horse-hoof; for the one-hoofed (animals) are cattle, and the Svishtakrit is Rudra: he thus shields the cattle from Rudra, whence Rudra does not prowl after the cattle where this oblation is offered at the Asvamedha. 5. The third oblation he offers in an iron bowl; for the people (subjects) are of iron 2, and the Svishtakrit is Rudra: he thus shields the people from Rudra, whence Rudra does not prowl after the cattle where this oblation is offered at the Asvamedha. Note: That is, their value--as compared with that of the king or nobles, and the Brâhmanas--is that of iron, compared with that of gold and silver; cp. XIII, 2, 2, 19. 13.2.2.18, 19: 18. And as to why there are copper (knives) for the 'paryaṅgyas,'--even as the non-royal kingmakers, the heralds and headmen, are to the
king, so those 'paryaṅgyas' are to the horse; and so, indeed, is this--to wit, copper--to gold: with their own form he thus endows them.
19. And as to why there are iron ones for the others,--the other animals, indeed, are the peasantry, and this--to wit, iron--is a form of the peasantry: he thus combines the peasantry with the peasantry. On a rattan mat (lying) north (of the Âhavanîya) they cut the portions of the horse(-flesh); for the horse is of anushtubh nature, and related to the Anushtubh is that (northern) quarter: he thus places that (horse) in its own quarter. And as to (his doing so) on a rattan mat,-

the horse was produced from the womb of the waters 1, and the rattan springs from the water: he thus causes it to be possessed of its own (maternal) womb.
Udavasânîyâ (closing offering) includes Traidhataviya iṣṭi (Yajna involving three minearal ores):
13.6.2.17. ...The Traidhâtavî is the final offering (Udavasânîyâ): the mystic import is the same (as before 1). (Note: The process is as set forth in V, 5, 5, 6 seqq. As noted in V.5.5.7, the Traidhâtavî ends with presentation of gold coins. Such gold coins are either tied as goldbead-fillets on the forehead and right shoulder of the priest or stitched on as embroidered adornments on the robe of the priest.

5:5:5:
6. And that which had been his (Vritra's) seat, his retreat, that he shattered, grasping it and tearing it out 1 Cf. III, 2, 1, 28.: it became this offering. And because the science (the Veda) that lay in that retreat was, as it were, a threefold (tridhâtu) one, therefore this is called the Traidhâtavî (iṣṭi).
7. And as to why the oblation is one for Indra and Vishnu, it is because Indra raised the thunderbolt, and Vishnu stood by him.
8. And why it is (a cake) on twelve potsherds,--there are twelve months in the year, and the offering is of equal measure with the year: therefore it is one of twelve potsherds.
9. He prepares it of both rice and barley. He first puts on (the fire) a ball of rice, that being a form (symbol) of the Yagus-formulas; then one of barley, that being a form of the Rik-verses; then one of rice, that being a form of the Sâman-hymns. Thus this is made to be a form of the triple science: and this same (offering) becomes the Udavasânîyâ-iṣṭi (completing oblation) for the performer of the Râgasûya. ...
11. And, verily, he who performs the Râgasûya gains for himself all sacrificial rites, all offerings, even the spoonful-oblations; and this offering, the Traidhâtavî (iṣṭi), is instituted by the gods: 'May this offering also be performed by me, may I be consecrated by this one also!' thus he thinks, and therefore this is the completing offering for him who performs the Râgasûya. ...
16. Three gold pieces of a hundred mânas 2 each are the sacrificial fee for this (offering). He presents them to the Brahman; for the Brahman neither performs (like the Adhvaryu), nor chants (like the Udgâtri), nor recites (like the Hotri), and yet he is an object of respect. And with gold they do nothing 3, and yet it is an object of respect: therefore he presents to the Brahman three gold pieces of a hundred mânas each. Note: According to Sâyana, these 'satamânas' are similar to the round plate worn by the king during the Consecration-ceremony; see p. 104, note 2. These plates (as the 'rukmas' generally, VI, 7, 1, 2 seq.) were apparently used for ornament only, not as coins.
