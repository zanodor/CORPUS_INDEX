Hierakonpolis tomb painting
33-42 minutes
Hierakonpolis is the Greek name for the ancient Egyptian city of Nekhen.
Hierakon means "falcon”, polis means “city”. Hierakonpolis is the City of
the Falcon. It was the first large settlement in Egypt. At the time, Egypt
was not yet a nation, it was still just a collection of warring tribes.
Tomb 100 is dated to the Predynastic Period of Egyptian history (circa
3400 BC) before the unification of Egypt in 3100 BC by king Narmer
(Hierakonpolis was his capital city). The tomb is almost 1,000 years older
than the Great Pyramid. It dates to the very beginning of Egyptian
civilization.
The mural of Tomb 100 decorated the burial chamber of a local Egyptian
lord. His name
is not known (I call him Lord Hierakon). The tomb was discovered in
1899, but it had been
looted by robbers a few years previously, so no valuable artifacts were
found. The mural
covered one wall of the tomb (see the layout of the tomb). There were
other paintings
on the walls that were too badly deteriorated to be preserved. The mural

was removed
and transported to the Cairo Museum. Tomb 100 of Hierakonpolis was
later destroyed
when the land was returned to cultivation.
The mural is very confusing. For more than a century, scholars tried to
make some sense
of this painting. It is described as “jumbled” and “chaotic”, with hunting
scenes interspersed with battle scenes, plus a random selection of
vignettes portraying priests, dancing women, animal sacrifice, funerary
rites − you name it. The painting is most often described as a “catalog of
themes and motifs”, a variety of unrelated images without any coherent
meaning.
Click on the above image to enlarge it in a separate window. You may want
to reference it during the following discussion. I recommend that you take
a few minutes to study the painting. See if you can figure out what is
happening in this enigmatic picture.
The first time I saw the Hierakonpolis mural, my attention was
immediately drawn to the Sumerian “Master of Animals”. His heroic
stance between two animals symbolizes his dominance over the natural
world.
Because there are so many boats in the painting, I briefly considered the
possibility that it depicted a seaborne invasion of Egypt by the Sumerians,
but I quickly discarded this theory for a couple of reasons. First, I knew it
was impossible for the Sumerians to conduct an invasion of Egypt, which
is almost 4,000 miles away by sea; and second, all of the boats are
definitely Egyptian, not Sumerian.
That was seven years ago. Occasionally I would see the painting in my
Pictures File. I
would study it for a while, but I couldn’t make any sense of it, so I

eventually gave up trying.
I didn’t pay much attention to the painting after that. Basically, if it’s not
Sumerian,
then I’m not interested.
A few days ago, I was idly looking through my Pictures File when once
again I came across the Hierakonpolis painting. I took one look at the
“Master of Animals” and I instantly knew what this painting is all about.
There's a reason why I knew this. It's because I recently identified the
Gebel el-Arak knife
as being a clear and unequivocal portrayal of a Sumerian seaborne
invasion of Egypt. The Gebel el-Arak knife dates to 3400 BC, making it
contemporary with the Hierakonpolis mural.
Now the idea of a Sumerian attack on Egypt no longer seemed so
farfetched.

See a drawing of both sides of the knife. Also see the page about the Gebel
el-Arak knife
on this website.
Scholars have identified the Master of Animals as “Mesopotamian”, but it
is specifically Sumerian. Although Mesopotamia (and other civilizations)
later adopted the motif of the
Master of Animals, at this early point in history, it was used exclusively by
the Sumerians.
The first time I saw the Master of Animals on the Hierakonpolis painting,
I assumed (like everyone else) that it was merely an item from the “catalog
of motifs” that is unrelated to the rest of the picture. I figured that the
artist added it to the mural simply because it is a very compelling image
(especially for the Egyptians, as will be later explained).
This time, when I looked at the Hierakonpolis painting, I studied it more
carefully.

I started with the Sumerian Master of Animals. He is colored in red. I
noticed that other men
in the painting are likewise colored red, so these are the Sumerians. Some
men are colored
in white. They are the Egyptians.
Then I noticed that the red Sumerians are definitely the aggressors in this
attack. They are “the bad guys” in this story.
Next, I noticed that the red men arrived on boats.
A red Sumerian helmsman is sitting on the back of the boat.
So... the Master of Animals is quintessentially Sumerian, the invaders are
his men, and they arrive in Egypt by boat.

I therefore categorically state, in no uncertain terms, the Hierakonpolis
mural, like the
Gebel el-Arak knife, depicts a seaborne invasion of Egypt by the
Sumerians.
You may be thinking, “Didn’t he just say it can’t be a Sumerian invasion
because the boats
are definitely Egyptian? How can it be a Sumerian invasion without
Sumerian boats?”
Funny you should mention that.
The boats
There are six boats in the painting. This is the invasion fleet. All of them
face in the same direction. All of them have the same palm leaf “standard”
on the front of the boats.

Palm standards (insignia) on the prows of all the boats depicted on the
Hierakonpolis mural,
in the order of their appearance, from left to right.
I was surprised when I first noticed that there aren't any people on the
boats, except for the helmsman shown above. Then I realized the
Sumerians had disembarked from their boats
and all of them were on the shore, wreaking havoc on the Egyptians.
The Sumerian helmsman is on a white boat. There are four other white
boats. They are
similar in design and construction (with steep hulls and twin cabins) and
they have the same
color scheme (with white hulls and red cabins). This means the white
boats are Sumerian.
One boat is very different than the others.

The sinister Black Ship. It belongs to the Sumerian commander of the
invasion fleet.
The cabin is richly decorated, suggesting royalty.
A Sumerian boat
The Black Ship is the only ship on the mural that looks like it might
possibly be Sumerian,
but it could just as easily be Egyptian, as shown in a picture of Egyptian
rock paintings.
Since the Black Ship is so different than the others, it's tempting to say
that it is Egyptian,
under the assumption that at least one Egyptian boat is involved in the
conflict. However,
the Black Ship is Sumerian because it is facing in the same direction as the
other ships
and it has the same palm leaf standard.
The precise rendering of the Sumerian ships on the Gebel el-Arak knife
proves that it depicts a Sumerian seaborne invasion. The same cannot be
said about the Hierakonpolis painting.
As mentioned earlier, the boats on the mural are truly Egyptian. That's
because the artist
was drawing what he knew best − Egyptian boats, boats he had been
drawing his entire life. Except for the Black Ship, he made little pretense

that he was trying to duplicate the complicated architecture of Sumerian
ships. Besides, as can be seen below, artists are not always accurate in
their illustrations of foreign ships:
Enlarge

It is the Egyptian boats on the Hierakonpolis mural that prevented the
scholars (and me)
from recognizing the Sumerian context of the painting in the first place, so
we need to
forget about the boats. They are only important in showing that this is a
seaborne invasion
by foreigners, and not just some backwater dispute among neighboring
tribes in the region.
In other words, they may look like Egyptian boats, but they belong to the
Sumerians.
On an entirely unrelated subject...

There is never a good time to bring up such an indelicate matter, but as a
warning to the younger members of the reading audience, it should be
noted that many of the men in the painting (Sumerians and Egyptians
alike) wear penis sheathes. On the Gebel el-Arak knife,
all of the men wear penis sheathes.
Again with the Egyptians and their penis sheathes! For the record, the
Sumerians never
wore this ridiculous apparatus. It was much too primitive and barbaric for
the Sumerians.
In my opinion, it proves that the Sumerians were far more civilized than
the Egyptians
during this period of history. There, I said it. Someone had to say it.
But I digress...

This image on the Hierakonpolis painting has baffled scholars for 100
years.
What is it? The first time I saw it, I thought it was a carousel. The more
times I looked at it, the more it looked like a carousel. I finally realized
that it is actually a corral. The animals are standing in it.
This is an important clue to the painting. You cannot understand the
Hierakonpolis mural until you understand the meaning of this corral.
Notice that the animals in the corral are not the usual forms of
domesticated livestock
(horses, cattle, sheep, pigs, etc.). They are essentially wild animals
(antelopes, gazelles, impalas, and the like).
You never see antelopes and gazelles in a corral. They are animals of the
open plain and
they cannot be domesticated. Some animals refuse to reconcile themselves
to captivity.
They will never stop trying to escape from confinement. They will refuse to
eat, and they
will eventually sicken and die if held in captivity for too long.
Nevertheless, the attempted control and domestication of wild animals
continued to be an important part of Egyptian culture for quite some time.
It was part of the Egyptian world view.
It defined their proper place in the cosmos as the intermediaries between
animals and gods.
The Egyptians kept trying to tame and control wild animals long after
everyone else had
given up on the idea.
Hierakonpolis was the home of the world's first zoo. The king kept wild

animals (including elephants and a hippopotamus) to display his wealth
and power. It showed his total control
over the natural world. He was the master of the animals. This
supernatural power over the animals demonstrated his divine right to
rule. The zoo is dated circa 3500 BC, making it contemporary to the
Hierakonpolis mural. This was the beginning of the animal iconography
in the Egyptian pantheon of gods and goddesses.
Egyptian animal gods. On the left is Horus, the falcon god of Egyptian
pharaohs.
That is why the Master of Animals was such a compelling figure for the
ancient Egyptians.
He is someone the Egyptians could identify with, someone they could
admire, even worship.
To the ancient Egyptians, the Master of Animals was god-like and
superhuman.

Detail from the Narmer macehead. On the right, broad-horned aurochs
are seen in a corral
and in a royal procession. Aurochs are wild cattle that cannot be
domesticated. On the left
is shown a corral with wild antelopes. The captive wild animals
demonstrate the power of
the pharaoh. See the entire macehead.
On the Tomb 100 mural, although the wild animals in the corral are not
truly domesticated,
for all intents and purposes they are essentially “livestock”. The same is
true for the
wild animals in the field.
Because of their long horns, ibexes are highly-prized game animals for
hunters. That is why everyone thought the mural had hunting scenes, but
in the overall context of the painting,
the ibexes are just livestock, like their cousins in the corral. Basically, all
hooved animals
on the Hierakonpolis mural are livestock.
Within the context of livestock, the animals are not being hunted, they are
being “rustled”. When looking at the Hierakonpolis mural, think in terms
of “tribal warfare”. Think in terms of “cattle raid”.
Narrative
In an article published in The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology (Dec.
1962), the authors,
Humphrey Case and Joan Crowfoot Payne, claim that “Most writers have
seen an element
of narrative [storytelling] in the painting, but some have exaggerated the
role of warfare.”
I suggest there is not just "an element of narrative" in the painting, it is all
Hierakonpolis tomb painting about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/748301/855901.html
13 of 35 8/18/2020, 5:30 PM



narrative,
and it's all about warfare.
The Hierakonpolis mural is not just a collection of unrelated themes and
motifs, it is a
complex and cohesive narrative. It is a story of high drama and subtle
nuances, with some surprising twists in the plot, and it even has a bit of
humor.
Where before the Hierakonpolis painting seemed so confusing, now,
within the context of a Sumerian invasion, it suddenly makes perfect
sense.
A narrative of the events portrayed on the Hierakonpolis mural.
The narrative begins with a Sumerian attack. They arrive in a flotilla of
ships, seemingly from out of nowhere. This is a surprise attack, like the
one shown on the Gebel el-Arak knife. The Sumerians beach their boats on
the shore. They quickly disembark from the boats and
fan out across the countryside, wreaking havoc on the Egyptians and
stealing their livestock.
Attack
The lower right corner is completely damaged except for a single
Sumerian attacker.
There would have been others, which are now missing due to damage.

Presumably,
some Egyptians were facing the Sumerians and fending off the attack.
The remaining narrative starts in the upper right corner and moves
counterclockwise around the mural.
Livestock raid
A Sumerian lassoes a horse. The Sumerians will capture as many animals
as they can.
This kind of tribal raid on livestock had happened all along the Nile for
thousands of years.
After the Sumerians capture as many animals as they can, they run off the
rest. In this case, it is a herd of ibexes. The Sumerian is shouting and
Hierakonpolis tomb painting about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/748301/855901.html
15 of 35 8/18/2020, 5:30 PM



waving his arms, like people always do when they want to scare away
animals.
As in any livestock raid, the herds are scattered to deny them to the
villagers. Also, the Egyptians will go chasing after their scattered herds
instead of chasing after the Sumerians, giving the invaders enough time to
load up their stolen livestock and escape in their boats.
This picture indicates that the Sumerians came to Egypt as "cattle raiders"
and not as conquerors. They would not run off the livestock if they
intended to settle in the region.
Ambush
This scene looks as if three Sumerians in long white skirts are waving their
arms to scare off another herd of ibexes, but this isn’t what’s really
happening.
The animals are already running away, far off in the distance. They’re long
gone, so the Sumerians aren’t interested in the animals anymore. They’re
focused on what’s happening right in their midst.
Notice the man beneath the awning (canopy). It looks as if he is sitting
under a canopy
on top of the cabin. However, there are several problems with this
assumption:
1) None of the other boats have a canopy.
2) He is a white Egyptian on a Sumerian boat.

3) The man is seriously out of scale with the big red helmsman on the
back of the boat
(not that the artist was overly concerned about the subtleties of
perspective), and
4) The man is sitting on top of the oars.
I suggest the oars were inserted through the double loops on top of the
cabins for storage
during the attack (I’ve always wondered about these double loops seen on
so many
Egyptian ships). Four of the ships in the painting have their oars stowed
away like this.
The man under the awning is actually on land, in the background behind
the ship.
He is sitting in a royal pavilion.

ceremonial macehead.

This man is obviously very important. He sits in a pavilion, beneath a
white plume standard with black tips. He is drawn much larger than the
man standing in front of him, symbolizing his greater importance. He is
an Egyptian lord, and the Sumerians have him surrounded.
The captured lord
That is why the Sumerians have their arms outstretched. They are
surrounding him, closing in on him and preventing his escape. A
Sumerian stands before the Egyptian lord. This is the moment when the
lord is captured. He bends his knees and bows down in submission.
Clearly, this is not Lord Hierakon. He would not forever immortalize his
ignominious capture
by depicting it on his burial tomb for all of eternity. This is a neighboring
Egyptian lord, perhaps a friend of Lord Hierakon, perhaps an enemy.
The battle is not going well for the Egyptians, and it’s about to get worse.
The Egyptians are surprised and overwhelmed, like on the Gebel el-Arak
knife. Meanwhile, we keep looking for some sign of the inevitable
Egyptian victory.
And where is Lord Hierakon?
The lions

The Sumerian rampage continues. A huge Sumerian menacingly raises his
war club. The circle on the left is a corral that was busted open and
emptied of its livestock. The circle
on the right is a ruined village hut, reduced to its timbers. Beside it, a tiny
forlorn Egyptian
picks up the pieces.
What’s really interesting is what’s happening with the two lions. Case and
Payne and other scholars consider this to be a “Confrontation with the
Lions”. This raises a couple of intriguing possibilities:
1) The Sumerian is going to kill the lions. Normally, in a fight between a
man and a lion,
I'd bet on the lion, even if the man has a stick − but look at the size of that
man, look at the size of that stick. The Sumerian doesn’t seem the least bit
afraid of the lions. In fact, he seems to be reaching out to grab a lion by the
throat before bashing its head with a club.
This could symbolize the Sumerian’s total mastery of the animal world.
Not even the lions scare him.
2) But there are two lions. Perhaps the lions are going to kill the
Sumerian. This could
symbolize the turning tide of battle as the lions begin to attack the
Sumerians. This
would be the supreme irony, a “master of the animals” getting killed and
eaten by a lion.
You have to admit, it’s rather funny, in a morbid kind of way.
I suggest the scene is not a "confrontation with the lions". The Sumerians
and the lions
have no intention of attacking each other. The scene has a different,
unexpected meaning.
It is something very mythological, something eerie and supernatural.
The Sumerian and the lions are not enemies, they are friends and allies.
The raised club
of the Sumerian has nothing to do with the lions. It refers to the
destruction that he inflicts
on the Egyptians by demolishing their homes and corrals. The Sumerian
isn't grabbing a lion
by the throat before clubbing it, he is summoning the lion with a wave of
Hierakonpolis tomb painting about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/748301/855901.html

his hand. The lions are not in a posture of attack, they're just walking
along. They follow the Sumerians around like pets. The lions are the
“animal familiars” of the Sumerians, doing their bidding.
Referring back to the dispersal of the ibex herds:
Expanded view
The animal on the left is a female ibex. In front of the Sumerian is a lion,
attacking the herd
of ibexes. The Sumerian is not just shouting and waving his arms to scare
off the ibexes,
he is siccing his lion on them.
Another lion is shown on the right, tending to a herd of antelopes.
For the ancient Egyptians, the Master of Animals is not just a symbol of
human dominance over the natural world. He is literally the controller of
animals, directing their actions. He casts his spell upon the lions, making
them his minions, controlling them from afar.
In the expanded view, we can see how the lions and the Sumerians work
together to rustle
Hierakonpolis tomb painting about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/748301/855901.html
20 of 35 8/18/2020, 5:30 PM



the animals. Whichever direction the animals turn, they are confronted by
either a lion or a Sumerian. The lion on the right is acting like a sheep dog,
helping to herd the animals so they can be captured by the Sumerians. He
drives the antelopes toward a Sumerian while at the same time preventing
the horses from escaping. The lead horse skids to a dead stop
when he sees the lion.
The horses are running away from the Sumerian who has a lasso. Then
they see the lion.
The lead horse stops dead in his tracks.
As in any livestock raid, the Sumerians capture as many animals as they
can, and then
they run off the rest, so the other lion is helping to disperse (stampede)
the ibexes
that haven't already been rustled by the Sumerians.

21 of 35 8/18/2020, 5:30 PM



It's easy to imagine the astonished looks on the ibex faces when they first
behold a man
siccing a lion on them.
The story of the Master of Animals controlling the lions is truly
extraordinary. It is an original work of fiction that infuses a dark magic
into the events of a local cattle raid, making it into a mythic battle of epic
proportions. There's nothing else like it anywhere in the ancient world.
Prisoners
This scene has been labeled as “threatening the prisoners”, but it is much
worse than that.
The execution of the prisoners. Three Sumerian prisoners are kneeling on
the ground,
Hierakonpolis tomb painting about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/748301/855901.html
22 of 35 8/18/2020, 5:30 PM



tied together with a long rope. The Egyptian “guard” grabs one of them by
the hair before
cracking his skull with a war club. The other two prisoners cower in fear
while awaiting
the same fate.
This scene is the beginning of a long tradition of showing the pharaoh
holding his captured enemies by the hair and "smiting the prisoners":
I suggest that when the pharaoh is shown with his weapon on his
shoulder, it means he is capturing the prisoners.
Hierakonpolis tomb painting about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/748301/855901.html
23 of 35 8/18/2020, 5:30 PM



When his weapon is raised, it means the pharaoh is executing the
prisoners. It's not just
an idle threat.
The execution of prisoners after the battle may be offensive to modern
sensibilities, but it
was a common practice in the ancient world. The Egyptians had no
qualms about it.
For instance, the front of the Narmer palette shows the pharaoh executing
a prisoner,
and the back of the palette shows the bodies of bound prisoners with their
severed heads
lying between their feet.
On the Hierakonpolis mural, is the execution of the Sumerian prisoners a
sign that the Egyptians have finally won the battle?
No, not really. The next scene shows that the battle continues.

This scene is often described as “combat between two men”, but it seems
to me that they
are not facing each other. It looks like the Egyptian is running away from
the Sumerian.
Both men carry curved weapons. They have been described as “shepherd
crooks”, which makes some sense in the context of a livestock raid, but I
believe they really are weapons. The Egyptians had a curved mace that can
be seen in another Egyptian painting.
Meanwhile, it is still a desperate struggle. The Egyptians are losing the
battle.
The Sumerian base camp
This corral was captured intact with its livestock by the Sumerians. This is
also where they herd their captured animals before loading them onto the
ships. At the bottom, a captured gazelle tries to escape, trailing a rope
behind him. The white antelope is also trailing a rope.
On the right, a Sumerian “hog ties” an antelope, trussing up its feet so it
can’t escape.
The antelope is now ready to be loaded and transported on one of the
ships. The only way
to force a wild antelope on board a ship is to tie him up and carry him.
On the Gebel el-Arak knife, the Master of Animals is a Sumerian king. I

don’t believe this is the case on the Hierakonpolis mural. Neither do I
believe that the Master of Animals is the Sumerian commander of the
invasion. The commander is elsewhere, next to his black ship.
On the Gebel el-Arak knife, the Master of Animals is just a figurehead He
is not involved
in the battle. On the Hierakonpolis mural, he is part of the narrative. He is
on the scene,
actively involved in the conflict by controlling the animals. He is a
shaman/priest/god/demon
of the Sumerians. He is a supernatural being, radiating his power across
the landscape, causing fear and panic throughout the human and animal
kingdoms of Egypt (the terrified animals scatter in all directions). He is
the source of the Sumerians' supernatural power
over the animals, the lions in particular.
You may be skeptical that the Master of Animals magically controls the
lions from afar.
If so, then consider this: Where the Sumerians are, so are the lions, and all
the Sumerians
walk among the lions without any sign of fear. In the above picture, the
Sumerian who is
tying up the antelope isn’t the least bit concerned that two enormous lions
are standing
right behind him. So, either the Master of Animals is the only one
controlling the lions,
or all of the Sumerians have this supernatural power. In other words, only
one Sumerian
controls the lions, or they all do. It is, of course, highly unlikely that every
single Sumerian
has this godlike power.
Besides, why else would the Master of Animals be on the field, except to
control the lions? He’s not there just to strike a pose, he is there to cast his
spell. This is the only plausible explanation for the symbiotic relationship
between the Sumerians and the lions.
For the record, the lions are Egyptian. There was no reason for the
Sumerians to bring
their own lions. The Master of Animals simply turned the Egyptians' lions

against them.
The Master of Animals is supposed to be a positive image. It represents
humanity's efforts
to tame the wilderness and to bring forth civilization, but on the mural,
the Master of Animals is portrayed as a sinister demon who uses his
magical power over the animals for evil
rather than good.
Looting
This scene is often mistaken as combat between two men because it looks
like the figure on the right is attacking a man holding a spotted shield.
However, it's unlikely they are fighting since they both have the same
markings.
The red man on the left is obviously Sumerian. Surprisingly, so is the man
in front of him.
Look at those red legs.
A Sumerian on the left is holding an item of clothing, probably a leopard
skin. It matches the spotted standard of the captive Egyptian lord. The
Sumerians have plundered his wardrobe. The Sumerian on the right holds
the lord’s royal scepter. He dances around, parading his captured finery,
mocking the lord. He’s saying, “Look at me! I’m a great big Egyptian lord!
Bow down before me!” His buddy comically obliges him. He bows down
(notice how his

knees are bent) and says, “Yes, Lord High Almighty! I hear and obey you!”
He's cracking up, holding his belly with laughter. It’s an unexpected bit of
humor on an otherwise grim tableau.
Killing
The Sumerian looters were a bit premature in their celebrations. The
battle is not yet over.
In the very next scene, a Sumerian bites the dust.
The man on the right is a real Egyptian lord (notice the white legs). He has
just killed a
Sumerian soldier. Scholars think the soldier may be holding a pronged
weapon, but it's actually a neck stock, the kind used on prisoners of war. It
even has a loop of rope on it.
The crook of the stock was placed on the back of a prisoner's neck. The
rope went around
his throat. It was a way to control the prisoner while keeping him at a safe
distance.
This is a very important scene. The Egyptian is the captured lord himself,
who escaped from his neck stock, seized his guard's weapon, and killed
him while the guard's companions were busy plundering the wardrobe.
This is the lord's revenge.

With the heroic escape of the captive lord, the battle is finally beginning to
turn in favor
of the Egyptians.
Surrender?
Three Sumerians in long white skirts.
There are six boats in the painting, and six Sumerians in white skirts. I
suggest they are the captains of the ships. Three of the captains were seen
capturing the Egyptian lord. The other captains are here. They sit or kneel
on the ground, oddly reposed amid the chaos.
They still have their weapons, but they are strangely passive. Are they
going to lay down their arms? Are they surrendering? Remember, we are
still looking for some clear sign of an Egyptian victory.
Again, where is Lord Hierakon? Shouldn’t he be in the thick of the action,
saving the day?
Meanwhile, the three men just calmly sit there, looking to the right,
staring into the Void.
The Void is the dark, damaged area in the middle of the painting. This is
where we would expect to see Lord Hierakon. It is also where we expect to
see the Sumerian commander, next to his Black Ship. I suggest this is
where the entire narrative came together. Unfortunately, the ending of the
story is lost forever because of damage on the painting.

Then again, it’s not too difficult to imagine how the story ended.
Victory
At last, Lord Hierakon arrives on the scene. He is larger than anyone else
on the mural to show his great importance. There's no doubt about who’s
the Grand Poohbah in this picture.
In front of him is the Sumerian commander, himself a lord. Hierakon
either kills him, or captures him, or accepts his surrender. The victorious
lord is flanked by his men. Captured Sumerians bow down in submission.
Perhaps a lion kneels down before Lord Hierakon,
or lies dead at his feet, signifying that Hierakon is now the new Master of
the Animals.
One more thing. I suggest the captive lord is none other than Hierakon
himself. I know I said
he wouldn't portray his capture on his own burial tomb, but he would do it
if he had heroically escaped from captivity and turned the tables on his
captors. His escape is the last scene before the surrender ceremony. It is
the turning point of the battle. In the next scene, Lord Hierakon is
reunited with his men and he leads them to victory.
If the captive lord is someone else, it means he has taken up a lot of room
in this narrative
(he is surrounded and captured, then he is escorted to the base camp; he
has his wardrobe plundered, then he frees himself from his neck stock and
kills his captor, then he makes
his heroic escape) and he has gotten all the glory before Hierakon even
shows up.

That's not what this painting is all about. This is Hierakon's burial
chamber. The painting
shows how he presented himself to the gods for all eternity. He is the hero
in this story,
not someone else.
This is Lord Hierakon, victorious in combat. He has been there all along.
Conclusions
For 100 years, scholars were unable to piece together the narrative of the
events portrayed on the Hierakonpolis mural because they did not know
the context of the story.
It all comes down to the Master of the Animals. If he were absent, the
mural would be just what it looks like – a picture of Egyptian tribal
warfare. If the Master of Animals was present, but painted a different
color than the red invaders, it would simply be a selection from the
"catalog of motifs”, that would be meaningless in the context of the
picture. However, with the red Sumerian Master of Animals, and the red
invaders who arrive by boat, this painting
can only be about a Sumerian seaborne invasion of Egypt. It cannot be
about anything else.
On the Gebel el-Arak knife, the Master of Animals is glorified; on the
mural he is demonized.
Although the Master of Animals became a popular motif in many other
ancient civilizations,
it never caught on in Egypt. At first, this is somewhat surprising,
considering the Egyptians' dedication to the control and domestication of
wild animals. The Master of Animals is a god who was tailor-made for the
Egyptians, but he never became part of the Egyptian pantheon, perhaps
because he became a symbol of foreign invasion. So, on second thought, it
is not overly surprising that the Master of Animals was none too popular

with the Egyptians, not after he sicced his lions on them.
A few Sumerian artifacts (including pictures of boats and the Master of
Animals) had
reached Egypt through intermediary traders via an overland route. It was
the first time
that the Egyptians heard about a distant and powerful kingdom called
Sumer. Apparently it caused great consternation among the Egyptian
nobility. It made them look up from their
tribal wars long enough to realize that there’s a big bad scary world out
there, which could possibly be a threat to their own kingdoms. For the first
time, Egyptians considered the possibility of a seaborne invasion by
foreigners.
But did it actually happen? Did the Sumerians really invade Egypt?
I doubt it, for the reasons listed on the page about the Gebel el-Arak knife.
Sumer is simply too far away, almost 4,000 miles by sea. If you have read
stories about the Age of Discovery (1500 - 1700 AD), you know of the
incredible hardships involved in long ocean voyages, even in “modern”
sailing ships. It’s doubtful that the Sumerians (or their ships) could
survive such a long voyage, much less arrive with enough men to mount
an invasion, much less survive the return trip. Plus, the Sumerians would

have to row all the way there. Although the Sumerians later invented
sailboats, there’s no evidence that they had them at this time, and the
boats were certainly not seagoing vessels that were large enough to carry
troops. Besides, there aren't any sailing ships on either the mural or the
Gebel el-Arak knife.
Yet the mural of Tomb 100 clearly shows a Sumerian seaborne attack on
Hierakonpolis,
so just for the sake of argument, let's look at the possibilities.
One possible scenario can be seen on the map below. If the Sumerians
wanted to attack Hierakonpolis from the western shore of the Red Sea,
they would have to beach their boats
on the coast, then travel 70 miles inland, then commandeer some
Egyptians boats, and then
cross the Nile to attack Hierakonpolis on the opposite side of the river.
Perhaps the Sumerians did not attack Egypt from the Red Sea, perhaps
they somehow commandeered some ships on the Mediterranean Sea and

attacked Egypt on the Nile River. This requires a much shorter sea voyage,
but as can be seen on the map, this scenario is even more unlikely than the
first one.
To attack Hierakonpolis, the Sumerians would have to travel the entire
length of the Nile,
past every major town in Egypt, paddling upstream the entire time, while
being attacked
by the Egyptians on both sides of the river.
It's entirely possible that Lord Hierakon actually did fight a battle, with
events similar to the ones illustrated on the painting (including the
escape), but he was mistaken if he thought it was a battle against the
Sumerians.
I personally would love it the Sumerians were intrepid enough to mount a
seaborne invasion
of Egypt at such an early stage in history (not that I have anything against
the Egyptians)
but I don’t see how it is even remotely possible.
This begs the question: why are Sumerian seaborne invasions clearly
depicted on both the Gebel el-Arak knife and the Hierakonpolis mural?
I believe the importation of some Sumerian artifacts (along with
coincidental raids on the
Egyptian coastline by nomadic tribesmen that the Egyptians thought were
Sumerians),
galvanized the Egyptians into thinking about Homeland Defense. I suggest
Lord Hierakon
and other lords appointed themselves to be "The Defenders Against
Foreign Invasion".
They promised to put aside their differences and unite together in
common defense if they
were ever invaded by foreigners. I believe the perceived threat of the
Sumerians helped to
unite Egypt. For the first time in their history, Egyptian noblemen began
to think of Egypt
as an entire country, and not just a collection of warring tribes.
The battle scenes on both the knife and the mural are “hypothetical”. They

show
what would happen if the Sumerians attacked Egypt.
For the Egyptians, their worst fears of a seaborne invasion eventually
came true in 1200 BC
when Egypt was overrun by the "Sea Peoples" (long after the end of
Sumerian civilization).
For now, the Egyptian fear of a Sumerian invasion was something of a
"Red Scare", literally,
but it helped to formulate the idea of a unified Egyptian nation.
There is one more point that needs to be considered:
Twenty years after the tomb at Hierakonpolis was plundered, a private
antiquities dealer
offered to sell to the Louvre Museum a flint knife with an elaborately
carved handle. The provenance of the knife wasn't known. It was allegedly
from Gebel el-Arak, 60 miles north of Hierakonpolis. There aren't any
major archaeological sites in Gebel el-Arak, so the curators made an
educated guess and assumed that the knife was probably from nearby
Abydos.
So... an unknown provenance. Are you thinking what I’m thinking?
