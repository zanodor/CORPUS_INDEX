# Index for Latin obscenity – Wikipedia.pdf

Latin obscenity is the profane, indecent, or impolite vocabulary of Latin, and its uses.
Words deemed obscene were described as obsc(a)ena (obscene, lewd, unfit for public
use), or improba (improper, in poor taste, undignified). Documented obscenities occurred
rarely in classical Latin literature, limited to certain types of writing such as epigrams, but
they are commonly used in the graffiti written on the walls of Pompeii and Herculaneum.
Among the documents of interest in this area is a letter written by Cicero in 45 BC (ad Fam.
9.22) to a friend called Paetus, in which he alludes to a number of obscene words without
actually naming them.
Apart from graffiti, the writers who used obscene words most were Catullus and Martial in
their shorter poems. Another source is the anonymous Priapeia (see External links below),
a collection of 95 epigrams supposedly written to adorn statues of the fertility god
Priapus, whose wooden image was customarily set up to protect orchards against thieves.
The earlier poems of Horace also contained some obscenities. However, the satirists
Persius and Juvenal, although often describing obscene acts, did so without mentioning
the obscene words.
Medical, especially veterinary, texts also use certain anatomical words that, outside of
their technical context, might have been considered obscene.
Cicero's letter ad Fam. 9.22
In a letter to one of his friends, written about 45 BC, Cicero discusses a number of
obscenities in Latin.[1] It appears that the friend, Lucius Papirius Paetus, (whose letters to
Cicero have not been preserved) had used the word mentula ("penis") in one of his letters.
Cicero praises him for his forthrightness, which he says conforms to the teachings of the
Stoic philosophers, but says that he himself prefers modesty (verēcundia).
In the letter Cicero alludes to a number of obscene words, without actually mentioning
them. The words which he alludes to but avoids are: cūlus ("arsehole"), mentula ("penis"),
cunnus ("cunt"), landīca ("clitoris"), and cōleī ("testicles"). He also objects to words which
mean "to fuck", as well as to the Latin word bīnī "two" because for bilingual speakers it
sounds like the Greek βινεῖ (bineî) ("he fucks or sodomises"[2]), and also to two words for
passing wind, vīssiō and pēdō. He does not object to using the word ānus, and says that
pēnis, which in his day was obscene, was formerly just a euphemism meaning "tail".
Latin taboo words



Degrees of obscenity
There thus appear to have been various degrees of obscenity in Latin, with words for
anything to do with sex in the most obscene category. These words are strictly avoided in
most types of Latin literature; however, they are common in graffiti, and also in certain
genres of poetry, such as the short poems known as epigrams, such as those written by
Catullus and Martial.[3] The poet Horace also used obscenities in his early poems, that is
the Epodes and the first book of Satires, but later writers of satire such as Juvenal and
Persius avoided the coarser words even when discussing obscene topics. There were,
however, some occasions in public life, such as in triumphal processions, at weddings, and
at certain festivals, where obscenities were traditionally allowed. The purpose of these was
presumably twofold, first to ward off the evil eye or potential envy of the gods, and second
to promote fertility.[4]
Euphemistic expressions
A very common way of avoiding words for sexual acts was simply to omit the word in
question. J.N. Adams collects numerous examples of this.[5] For example, in Horace
(Epodes 12.15):
Īnachiam ter nocte potes
("You are capable of [having sex with] Inachia three times in a night.")
Another way was to substitute the taboo word with a milder one or a metaphor, for
example using clūnēs ("rump (of an animal)") for cūlus or testiculī for cōleī.
Sometimes the offending word was replaced by a pronoun such as istuc ("that") or an
adverb such as illīc ("there"), as in Martial (11.104.16):
et quamvīs Ithacō stertente pudīca solēbat
illīc Pēnelopē semper habēre manum
("And when the Ithacan was snoring, modest though she was,
Penelope always kept her hand there.")
Mentula
Mentula is the basic Latin word for penis. It is used 48 times in Martial, 26 times in the
Mentula and verpa: the penis



Priapeia, and 18 times in Pompeian inscriptions.[6] Its status as a basic obscenity is
confirmed by the Priapeia 29, in which mentula and cunnus are given as ideal examples of
obscene words:[7]
Obscēnis, peream, Priāpe, sī nōn
ūtī mē pudet improbīsque verbīs
sed cum tū positō deus pudōre
ostendās mihi cōleōs patentēs
cum cunnō mihi mentula est vocanda
("May I die if it doesn't shame me
to use obscene and improper words;
but when you, Priapus, as a god, shamelessly
show me your balls hanging out,
it is appropriate for me to speak of cunts and cocks.")
Martial mocks a friend who despised effeminate clothing, explaining why he suspects that
he is secretly homosexual:
rogābit unde suspicer virum mollem.
ūnā lavāmur: aspicit nihil sūrsum,
sed spectat oculīs dēvorantibus draucōs
nec ōtiosīs mentulās videt labrīs.
("He will ask why I suspect him to be a 'soft' man.
We go to the baths together. He never looks at anything above,
but examines the athletes[8] with devouring eyes,
and looks at their penises with motions of his lips."
Mentula also frequently appears in the poetry of Catullus. Catullus uses Mentula as a
nickname for Mamurra, as if it were an ordinary name, as in his epigram 105:
Mentula cōnātur Pipleium scandere montem:
Mūsae furcillīs praecipitem ēiciunt.
("That prick tries to climb the Pimpleian mount (of poetry);
the Muses drive him out with pitchforks.")
(Pimpleia was a place in Pieria in northern Greece associated with the Muses (the nine
goddesses of poetry and music).)
Etymology



The etymology of mentula is obscure, although outwardly it would appear to be a
diminutive of mēns, gen. mentis, the "mind" (i.e.; "the little mind"). Cicero's letter 9e22 ad
Familiares relates it to menta, a spearmint stalk. Tucker's Etymological Dictionary of Latin
relates it to ēminēre, "to project outwards", mentum, "chin", and mōns, "a mountain", all of
which suggest an Indo-European root *men-. Other hypotheses have also been
suggested, though none generally accepted.[9]
Verpa
Verpa is also a basic Latin obscenity for "penis", in particular for a penis in an erect state
with the glans bare,[10] as in the illustration of the god Mercury below. It was "not a neutral
technical term, but an emotive and highly offensive word" (Adams), used especially in
contexts of aggressive homosexual acts rather than mere futūtiō ("copulation"). It is found
frequently in graffiti of the type verpes (= verpa es) quī istuc legēs ("Whoever reads this,
you're a dickhead").[11]
It is found less frequently in Classical Latin literature, but it does appear in Catullus 28:
ō Memmī, bene mē ac diū supīnum
tōtā istā trabe lentus irrumāstī.
sed, quantum videō, parī fuistis
cāsū: nam nihilō minōre verpā
farti estis.
("O Memmius, while I lay on my back for a long time
you fed me good and slow with that entire beam of yours.
But as far as I can see, you guys have met with the same fate:
for you have been stuffed with a "verpa" no less large!")
Catullus is here speaking metaphorically. He complains that when he accompanied Gaius
Memmius, the governor of Bithynia (57-56 BC), as part of his entourage, he was not
allowed to make money out of the position. From this poem it is clear that Catullus's
friends Veranius and Fabullus were kept under an equally close rein when they
accompanied Lucius Piso to his province of Macedonia in 57-55 BC.[12][13]
Verpus, as a masculine adjective or noun, referred to a man whose glans was exposed,
either by an erection or by circumcision; thus Juvenal (14.100) has
quaesītum ad fontem sōlōs dēdūcere verpōs
("To guide only the circumcised [i.e. Jews] to the fountain that they seek").



And in poem 47 Catullus writes:
vōs Vērāniolō meō et Fabullō
verpus praeposuit Priāpus ille?
("Did that unsheathed Priapus prefer you guys
to my little Veranius and Fabullus?")
In Martial's time it was a common practice for actors and athletes to be fitted with a fībula
(a pin or brooch through their foreskin) to discourage sex and to preserve their voice or
strength.[14] Martial (7.81) mocks one such actor as follows:
Mēnophilī pēnem tam grandis fībula vestit
ut sit cōmoedīs omnibus ūna satis.
hunc ego crēdideram, nam saepe lavāmur in ūnum,
sollicitum vōci parcere, Flacce, suae:
dum lūdit mediā populō spectante palaestrā,
dēlāpsa est miserō fībula: verpus erat.
("Such a big brooch clothes Menophilus's penis
that it is enough for all the comic actors in the world.
I believed (since we often go to the baths together)
that he was anxious to preserve his voice, Flaccus.
But one day, while he was wrestling in the middle of the palaestra with everyone
watching,
the poor man's brooch fell off. He was circumcised!")
Mūtō
A third word for "penis" was mūtō, mūtōnis (or muttō, muttōnis). This is very rare and
found only in one line of Horace and a fragment of the satirist Lucilius. The passage in
Horace (Sat. 1.2.68) is as follows, in which he advises a young man who was beaten up as
a result of an affair with the dictator Sulla's daughter:
huic si mūtōnis verbīs mala tanta videntī
dīceret haec animus ‘quid vīs tibi? numquid ego ā tē
magnō prognātum dēpōscō cōnsule cunnum
vēlātumque stolā, mea cum conferbuit īra?ʼ
("What if, in the words of his penis, his mind were to say to the man when he sees
such troubles: 'What exactly do you want? Do I ever demand a cunt descended from a
famous consul or veiled in a fancy gown when my passion grows hot?'")
And Lucilius says:



at laevā lacrimās muttōnī absterget amīcā
("But with his left hand as his girlfriend, he wipes away his muttō's tears.")[15]
The word mūtō may be related to the marriage deity Mutunus Tutunus.[16]
Although mūtō itself is rare, the derivative mūtūniātus ("well-endowed") is found twice in
Martial, as at 3.73:
dormīs cum puerīs mūtūniātīs,
et non stat tibi, Phoebe, quod stat illīs
("You sleep with well-endowed boys, Phoebus,
and the thing that stands up for them does not stand up for you.")
The derivative mūtōnium is found in Lucilius and in two Pompeian graffiti.[17]
Synonyms and metaphors
The Latin word pēnis itself originally meant "tail". Cicero's ad Familiārēs, 9.22, observes
that pēnis originally was an innocuous word, but that the meaning of male sexual organ
had become primary by his day. The euphemism is used occasionally by Catullus, Persius,
Juvenal, and Martial, and even once by the historian Sallust,[18] who writes that the
supporters of the anti-government rebel Catiline included
quīcumque inpudīcus, adulter, gāneō manū, ventre, pēne bona patria lacerāverat
("whatever shameless man, adulterer, or glutton had ruined his ancestral property by
hand, stomach, or 'tail'")
Commenting on this passage, St Augustine notes that Sallust's use of the term in this
phrase was not offensive.[19] The word did not survive into Romance, however, and occurs
only once in a Pompeian inscription.
Juvenal, showing his knack for describing grossly obscene matters without using taboo
words, writes as follows in one of his satires (9.43-4):
an facile et prōnum est agere intrā viscera pēnem
lēgitimum atque illīc hesternae occurrere cēnae?
("Or do you think it is an easy or straightforward thing to drive a proper-sized 'tail'
inside someone's guts and there bump into yesterday's dinner?")[20]



An example of a sopio (see below), the god Mercury was depicted with an enormous penis on this fresco from Pompeii.
The obscure word sōpiō (gen. sōpiōnis) seems to have meant a sexualized caricature with
an abnormally large penis, such as the Romans were known to draw. It appears in Catullus
37: frontem tabernae sōpiōnibus scrībam ("I will draw sopios on the front of the tavern")
and in graffiti from Pompeii: ut merdās edātis, quī scrīpseras sōpiōnīs ("whoever drew
sopios, let him eat shit!'") The grammarian Sacerdos preserves a quotation about Pompey,
that says quem non pudet et rubet, nōn est homō, sed sōpiō ("whoever is not ashamed,
and does not blush, is not a man, but a sopio.") Sōpiō would appear to describe drawings
such as that of the god Mercury in the illustration.
The word pipinna seems to have been children's slang for the penis; compare English pee
pee. It appears in Martial 11.71:
draucī Natta suī vorat pipinnam,
collātus cui gallus est Priāpus.
("Natta sucks the pee-pee of his athlete,
compared to whom, Priapus is a eunuch.")
A draucus (the word occurs only in Martial), according to Housman, was a man "who
performs feats of strength in public".[21] Rabun Taylor disagrees and sees a draucus more
as a kind of rent boy who hung around in the baths in search of patrons.[22] A gallus was
an emasculated member of the cult of Cybele; according to Taylor (1997), they had much
in common with the hijras of India today.[23]
Another euphemism for the penis was cauda ("tail"), which occurs twice in Horace,[24] and
continues today in the French derivative queue ("tail" or "penis"). In one place in his Satires



(Serm. 2.7.50) Horace writes:
quaecumque excēpit turgentis verbera caudae,
clūnibus aut agitāvit equum lascīva supīnum,
dīmittit neque fāmōsum neque sollicitum nē
dītior aut formae meliōris meiat eōdem.
("Whichever girl receives the blows of my swelling 'tail',
or when I'm on my back sexily rides my 'horse' with her buttocks,
sends me away neither with a bad reputation nor worried that
a richer or more handsome guy might piss in the same place.")
For the metaphorical use of meiere ("to piss"), see below.
The words nervus ("nerve" or "sinew") and fascinum or fascinus, which meant a phallic
image or amulet in the form of a penis, were also sometimes used as euphemisms for the
penis.[25] In one of Horace's Epodes (12) a woman boasts of one of her lovers, Coan
Amyntas,
cuius in indomitō cōnstantior inguine nervus
quam nova collibus arbor inhaeret.
("on whose indomitable groin a sinew grows,
more constant than a new tree clings to the hills.")
And one of the characters in Petronius's Satyricon, Ascyltus, is described as follows:[26]
habēbat enim inguinum pondus tam grande, ut ipsum hominem laciniam fascinī crēderēs
("For he had a weight on his groins so big that you'd think the man himself was just an
appendage of his phallus.")
Erect and flaccid
The verb arrigō, arrigere meant "to have an erection". Suetonius's Lives of the Twelve
Caesars, Augustus 69, contains the sentence:
an rēfert, ubi et in quā arrigās?
("Does it make any difference where or in which woman you get hard?")
Martial uses the word rigidam ("a hard one") alone to refer to a penis in the following line,
mocking a certain Greek philosopher who despite his beard was effeminate (9.47.6):
in mollī rigidam clūne libenter habēs
("You enjoy having a hard one in your soft backside")



Another word for "erect" was tentus ("stretched, extended"). Priapus is addressed as tente
Priāpe in Priāpeia 81, and as being fascinō gravis tentō ("heavy with an extended phallus")
in Priāpeia 79.
An "erection" or "impatience to have sex" was tentīgō.[27] Horace (Sat. 1.2.116-8) writes:
...tument tibi cum inguina, num, sī
ancilla aut verna est praestō puer, impetus in quem
continuō fīat, mālīs tentīgine rumpī?
("When your groin swells up, then if
a slave girl or home-reared slave boy is available, on whom you can mount an attack
straightaway, do you prefer to burst with the erection?")
Similarly in Priapeia 33.5, the god Priapus says:
turpe quidem factū, sed nē tentīgine rumpar,
falce mihī positā fīet amīca manus.
("Shameful indeed to do, but so that I don't burst with desire,
I shall put down my sickle and my hand will become my girlfriend.")
An adjective to describe a penis which refused to become erect was languida. Ovid
(Amōrēs 3.7.65-6):
nostra tamen iacuēre velut praemortua membra
turpiter hesternā languidiora rosā
("But my members lay there as if prematurely dead,
shamefully, more languid than yesterday's rose.")
And a girlfriend of Horace's chides him with the words (Epodes 12):
Inachiā languēs minus ac mē
("You are less languid with Inachia than with me!")
While Catullus (67.23) speaks of an impotent husband in these terms:
languidior tenerā cui pendēns sīcula bētā
nunquam sē mediam sustulit ad tunicam
("whose little dagger, hanging more flaccid than a tender beet (a vegetable)
never raised itself to the middle of his tunic")
In the Romance languages
Mentula has evolved into Sicilian and Italian minchia and South Sardinian minca. Minga also



exists in Spanish. Verpa is preserved in some Romance dialects, usually with another
meaning; verpile is a sort of stirrup and spur in a Calabrian dialect, possibly named for its
shape. Most Romance languages have adopted metaphorical euphemisms as the chief
words for the penis; as in Spanish, Portuguese and Italian verga, obscene for penis, and in
Romanian vargă (although pulă is far more common), in Catalan and French verge, from
Latin virga, "staff", and French queue ("tail"), from Latin cauda/cōda "tail". The Portuguese
caralho "penis", first attested in the 10th century, is thought to derive from a vulgar Latin
word *caraculum "a little stake".[28] The Italian cazzo has no obvious Latin ancestor. A
number of different suggestions have been made for its origin, but none has yet gained
general acceptance.[29]
The basic word for the testicles in Latin was cōleī (singular: cōleus). It appears to have had
an alternative form *cōleōnēs (singular: cōleō), from which the Spanish cojones and other
Romance forms are derived. (One late Latin source has the spelling culiones).
Etymology
The etymology of cōleī is obscure. Tucker, without explanation, gives *qogh-sleǐ-os
(*kwogh-sley-os?), and relates it to cohum, an obscure word for "yoke".
Lewis and Short's Latin Dictionary relates the word to culleus ("a leather sack for liquids").
However, this etymology is not generally accepted today, and according to the Thesaurus
Linguae Latinae the etymology is unknown. In texts, the word for testicles is always spelled
with col- not cull-, and is plural.
Usage
Cicero in his letter discussing obscene Latin words (ad Fam. 9.22) says at one point
honestī cōleī Lānuvīnī, Clīternīnī nōn honestī ("Lanuvian cōleī are respectable, but
"Cliternian" ones are indecent"). (Lanuvium and Cliternia were small towns not far from
Rome.) However, the meaning of these phrases is not known, according to the Thesaurus
Linguae Latinae.
The word occurs in Petronius (44):
sī nōs cōleōs habērēmus, nōn tantum sibi placēret
Cōleī: the testes



("if we had any balls (i.e. if we were real men), he wouldn't be so pleased with
himself!")[30]
Martial (9.27) writes of a philosopher who had depilated his balls as well as the rest of his
legs, using a pair of volsellae (tweezers):
cum dēpilātōs, Chrēste, cōleōs portēs
("since you carry your balls hairless, Chrestus").
A Pompeian graffito quotes a line of iambic verse:[31]
senī supīnō cōleī cūlum tegunt
("When an old man lies down, his testicles cover his butthole.")
The form of the line is reminiscent of the proverbial sayings of Publilius Syrus, many of
which employ the same metre.
Synonyms and metaphors
The more decent word in Latin for testicles was testēs (sing. testis). This word may have
derived from the Latin for "witnesses". Cicero's letter says "testēs" verbum honestissimum
in iūdiciō, aliō locō nōn nimis. ("In a court of law, witnesses is a quite decent word; not too
much so elsewhere.") Katz (1998) draws attention to the fact that in some cultures it was
customary to take a solemn oath while laying hands on the testicles either of a living
person (as in Genesis 24e2-4; 47e29-31), or of a sacrificed animal (as described in
Demosthenes 23.67f); a similar ritual took place in Umbria when dedicating a sacrificial
animal. According to Katz, the word testis itself appears to be derived from the root trityo
("third") and originally meant a third party.
The two meanings of testēs open the door for puns such as the following from Martial
(2.72):[32]
quid quod habet testēs, Postume, Caecilius?
("What about the fact that Caecilius has witnesses/testicles, Postumus?")
Or Cicero's testīs ēgregiōs! ("outstanding witnesses!") in his amusing account of two
witnesses hiding naked in a public bathhouse.[33]
The diminutive testiculī was entirely confined to the anatomical sense; it is used 33 times
by the medical writer Celsus, but testis not at all.[34] The satirists Persius and Juvenal also
used the word testiculī. Veterinary writers use both testis and testiculus.



In Catullus (63.5), the testicles are famously referred to as pondera ("weights"), perhaps a
metaphor of the weights hung on threads of a loom.[35] The exact words of the text here
are disputed,[36] but the general sense is clear:
dēvolsit īlī acūtō sibi pondera silice
("He tore off the weights of his groin with a sharp flint")
Ovid (Fasti 2.241) recounting the same story, and perhaps implying that Attis removed the
whole organ, similarly uses the phrase onus inguinis ("the burden of his groin").[37]
Other euphemisms are used in other writers. Ovid (Amōrēs 2.3) uses the phrase membra
genitālia:[38]
quī prīmus puerīs genitālia membra recīdit,
vulnera quae fēcit, dēbuit ipse patī.
("He who first cut off the genital parts of boys
ought himself to have suffered the wounds which he made.")
In the Romance languages
Cōleōnēs is productive in most of the Romance languages: cf. Italian coglioni, French
couilles, couillons; Portuguese colhões, Galician collóns, collois, collós, Catalan collons,
Sardinian cozzones, Romanian coi, coaie, Spanish cojones (now a loanword in English).
Cunnus was the basic Latin word for the vulva. The Priapeia mention it in connection with
mentula, above. Despite its similarity to "cunt", the Oxford English Dictionary cautions that
the two words may have developed from different roots.[39]
Etymology
Cunnus has a distinguished Indo-European lineage. It is cognate with Persian kun "anus"
and kos "vulva", and with Greek κύσθος (kusthos). Tucker and de Vaan derive it from an
Indo-European *kut-nos akin to Welsh cwd 'bag, scrotum'.
Usage
Cicero's Orator (ad Marcum Brutum) §154 confirms its obscene status. Cicero writes:
Cunnus: the vulva



dīcitur "cum illīs"; "cum autem nōbīs" non dīcitur, sed "nobīscum"; quia sī ita dīcerētur,
obscaenius concurrerent litterae.
("We say cum illīs ("with them"), but we don't say cum nobis ['with us'], but rather
nobiscum; because if we said it like that, the letters would run together in a rather
obscene way.")
Because the /m/ of cum assimilates to the /n/ of nōbīs, cum nōbīs sounds very similar to
cunnō bis, meaning "in/from/with a cunt twice". A similar euphemism occurs in French: the
avoidance of qu'on, homophone to con (cunt), by the insertion of a superfluous letter: que
l'on.
Horace, however, uses the word cunnus in his Satires (Sermones) at 1.2.70, and again at
1.3.105:
Nam fuit ante Helenam cunnus taeterrima bellī
causa. . .
("For even before Helen, the cunt was a most loathsome cause of war")
Martial also uses it freely, for example (3.87):
nārrat tē rūmor, Chionē, numquam esse futūtam
atque nihil cunnō pūrius esse tuō.
tēcta tamen non hāc, quā dēbēs, parte lavāris:
sī pudor est, trānsfer subligar in faciem.
("Rumour has it, Chione, that you have never been fucked
and that there is nothing purer than your cunt.
However, you go to the baths without covering the part you should;
if you have any modesty, transfer your loincloth to your face!")
The word cunnilingus occurs in literary Latin, most frequently in Martial; it denotes the
person who performs the action, not the action itself as in modern English, where it is not
obscene but technical. The term comes from the Latin word for the vulva (cunnus) and the
verb "to lick" (linguere, cf. lingua "tongue").
Synonyms and metaphors
These include sinus, "indentation", and fossa, "ditch".
The modern scientific or polite words vulva and vagina both stem from Latin, but originally
they had different meanings. The word vāgīna is the Latin word for scabbard or sword
sheath.



Vulva (or volva) in classical Latin generally signified the womb, especially in medical
writing, and also it is also common in the Vetus Latina (pre-Jerome) version of the
Bible.[40] The meanings of vagina and vulva have changed by means of metaphor and
metonymy, respectively. Other words for the womb are uterus, mātrīx (in later Latin),
venter ("belly"), and alvus (also "belly"). At Juvenal 6.129, however, the word volva is used
of the vagina or clitoris of the (allegedly) nymphomaniac empress Messalina, who is
described as departing from a session in a brothel:[41]
adhūc ardēns rigidae tentīgine volvae,
et lassāta virīs necdum satiāta recessit
("still burning with the excitement of her rigid 'volva',
tired out by men but still not satisfied, she departs")
In the Romance languages
Cunnus is preserved in almost every Romance language: e.g. French con, Catalan cony,
Spanish coño, Galician cona, Portuguese cona, (South) Sardinian cunnu, Old Italian cunna.
In Calabrian dialects the forms cunnu (m.) and cunna (f.) are used as synonyms of "stupid,
dumb". In Portuguese it has been transferred to the feminine gender; the form cunna is
also attested in Pompeian graffiti and in some late Latin texts.
The ancient Romans had medical knowledge of the clitoris, and their native word for it was
landīca. This appears to have been one of the most obscene words in the entire Latin
lexicon. It is alluded to, but does not appear, in literary sources, except in the Priapeia 79,
which calls it misella landica, the "poor little clitoris". It does, however, appear in graffiti.
Usage
Not even the poets Catullus and Martial, whose frankness is notorious, ever refer to
landīca. In a letter to a friend,[42] Cicero discusses which words in Latin are potentially
obscene or subject to obscene punning, and there hints at the word landīca by quoting an
unintentionally obscene utterance made in the Senate:
. . . hanc culpam maiorem an illam dīcam?
"shall I say that this or that was the greater fault?"
with illam dīcam echoing the forbidden word. Note that the "m" at the end of "illam" was
Landīca: the clitoris



pronounced like "n" before the following "d."
The word landīca is found in Roman graffiti: xyz{ |}~ ÄÅÇÉ~Ñ ÖÜ}ÜÇ~y ("I seek Fulvia's
clitoris") appears on a leaden projectile found at Perugia left over from the Perusine
War,[43] while a derivative word is found in Pompeii: yÜx}áÇà~ }~â~ }~ÄÅÇÉ{ä~ ("Euplia (is)
loose and has a large clitoris").[44]
It also occurs in Priapeia 78.5 (in some versions 79.5), where a girl who has received the
attentions of a cunnilingus is described as suffering from landīcae ... fossīs ("cracks in her
clitoris").[45] The word also occurs twice in a medical context in a 5th-6th century Latin
translation of Soranus of Ephesus's book on gynaecology.[46]
Fay (1907) suggests one possible etymology as (g)landīca ("a little gland").
Synonyms and metaphors
Martial's epigram 1.90 alludes to a woman who uses her clitoris as a penis in a lesbian
encounter, referring to it as her "prodigious Venus":[47]
inter sē geminōs audēs committere cunnōs
mentīturque virum prōdigiōsa Venus.
("You dare to rub two cunts together
and your prodigious Venus pretends to be a man.")
In the Satires of Juvenal it is referred to euphemistically as a crista, "crest" in this line
(6.420), describing a lady's massage after an exercise session:
callidus et cristae digitōs inpressit aliptēs
ac summum dominae femur exclāmāre coēgit
("And the cunning masseur presses his fingers on her 'crest'
and causes the top of his mistress's thigh to cry aloud")
In the Romance languages
Landīca survived in Old French landie (extremely rare),[48] and in Romanian lindic .
The basic Latin word for the anus was cūlus.[49] Though not very common, it occurs in
both Catullus and Martial, and is productive in Romance. The word is of uncertain
Cūlus: the anus



etymology, according to Adams.
Usage
In the texts cūlus appears to be used only of humans. It was associated with both
defecation and with sex. Catullus (23) mocks a certain Furius with these words:
quod cūlus tibi pūrior salillō est
nec tōtō deciēs cacās in annō
("Because your arsehole is purer than a salt-cellar
and you don't shit more than ten times in a whole year!")
Martial (2.51) mocks a passive homosexual in these terms:[50]
Ūnus saepe tibī tōtā dēnārius arcā
cum sit et hic cūlō trītior, Hylle, tuō,
nōn tamen hunc pistor, nōn auferet hunc tibi cōpō,
sed sī quis nimiō pēne superbus erit.
īnfēlīx venter spectat convīvia cūlī,
et semper miser hic ēsurit, ille vorat.
("Though you often have only one denarius in your whole money-chest,
Hyllus, and that rubbed smoother than your arsehole,
yet it's not the baker, nor the innkeeper, who will take that away from you,
but anyone who is proud of his over-sized penis.
Your unlucky stomach looks at the banquets of your arsehole,
and the former is always hungry, poor thing, while the latter devours.")
Pōdex
The word pōdex was synonymous with cūlus, "arsehole". This word is thought to be an o
stem version of the same root as pēdere "to fart", identifying it as the source of flatulence.
Lewis and Short's Dictionary cites only two instances. In an unattractive picture of an old
woman Horace (Epodes 8.6) writes:
hietque turpis inter āridās natīs
pōdex velut crūdae bovis.
("And (when) there gapes between your wrinkled buttocks
an ugly arsehole like that of a cow with diarrhoea.")
Juvenal (2.12), writing of outwardly virile but in practice effeminate philosophers, writes:



hispida membra quidem et dūrae per bracchia saetae
promittunt atrōcem animum, sed pōdice lēvī
caeduntur tumidae medicō ridente mariscae.
("Your hairy limbs and the tough bristles along your arms
promise a stern spirit, it's true, but from your smooth arsehole
swollen figs (i.e. piles) are cut out as the doctor laughs.")
The implication is that the piles have been caused by anal sex; that such anal piles or sores
are caused by sex is a common theme in the poems of Martial.[51]
Pōdex seems to have been rather a rarer word than cūlus. It is not used by Catullus, and
only twice by Martial. It is not found in Pompeii, and did not produce derivatives in vulgar
Latin or in the Romance languages. The fact that it is used once by Juvenal (who avoided
obscene vocabulary) shows that it was less offensive than cūlus. In later medical Latin,
such as the 5th century Cassius Felix, it could be used as an alternative for ānus.[52]
Other synonyms
A more seemly Latin word for the backside was clūnēs (singular clūnis) "buttocks"; this
word was generally more decent than cūlus, and older, as well: it has several Indo
European cognates. It can be used for the rump of animals as well as humans, and even
birds.[53] The word is usually plural but sometimes singular. In the same satire quoted
above Juvenal (2.20–21) speaks scathingly of philosophers who have double standards,
preaching about virtue but practising vice:
dē virtūte locūtī
clūnem agitant. 'ego tē cēventem, Sexte, verēbor?'
("They speak of virtue
but waggle their rump. 'Am I going to respect you, Sextus, when you behave in such a
camp way?'")
Another word for buttocks, slightly less common, was natēs, which is generally used only
of the buttocks of humans. It seems to have been a more vulgar or colloquial word than
clūnēs.[54] In one of the Priapeia epigrams (22, in some editions 21) the god Priapus
threatens potential thieves with punishment as follows:[55]
fēmina sī fūrtum mihi faciet virve puerve
haec cunnum, caput hic praebeat, ille natēs.
("If any woman steals (from my garden) or a man or a boy,
the first must provide her cunt, the second his head, the third his buttocks.")



Ānus was the name for the posterior opening of the digestive tract; the word is not specific
to that usage, but instead originally meant "ring". Its anatomical sense drove out its other
meanings, and for this reason the diminutive ānulus became the usual Latin name for a ring
or circle.[56][57] In his book on agriculture, Columella describes how to treat a cow with
stomach-ache:
sī dolor remanet, ungulās circumsecāre, et unctā manū per ānum īnsertā fimum
extrahere
("If any pain remains, trim your nails, insert your oiled hand through its anus and
extract the dung")
An example of the usage of "ring" as a metaphor in a modern Romance language can be
found in Brazilian Portuguese slang, in which the word anel can have the same double
meaning, especially in the expression o anel de couro (the leather ring). "Ring" is also
British slang for "anus".
In the Romance languages
Cūlus has been preserved as meaning the buttocks (rather than the anus) in most
Romance languages except for Portuguese, which kept the original semantics. It yields the
forms culo in Spanish and Italian; in French and Catalan it becomes cul, in Romanian cur, in
Vegliot Dalmatian čol, in Sardinian culu, in Portuguese cu and in Galician cu. Its
offensiveness varies from one language to another; in French it was incorporated into
ordinary words and expressions such as culottes, "breeches", and cul-de-sac.
Decorative scene in the baths. Some scholars
Futuere: to have intercourse with women



suggest that this is what was meant by a prōtēlum ("team of three").[58]
Futuō, infinitive futuere, perfect futuī, past participle futūtum, Latin for "to copulate", is
richly attested and useful.
The etymology of futuō is "obscure". It may be related to refūtō "repel, rebut" and cōnfūtō,
"suppress" or "beat down", and come from a root meaning "beat".[59]
Futuō is richly attested in all its forms in Latin literature. Not only the word itself, but also
derived words such as dēfutūta, "fucked out, exhausted from sex" (Catullus 41), diffutūta
(Catullus 29, same meaning), and cōnfutuere "to have sex with" (Catullus 37) are attested
in Classical Latin literature. The derived noun futūtiō, "act of intercourse", also exists in
Classical Latin, and the nomen agentis futūtor, which corresponds to the English epithet
"fucker", but lacking the derogatory tone of the English word. The god Priapus says in one
poem (Priapeia 63):
ad hanc puella - paene nōmen adiēcī
solet venīre cum suō futūtōre
("To this (p....) of mine, a girl – I almost added the name
is accustomed to come with her boyfriend")
It is also used metaphorically in Catullus 6, which speaks of latera ecfutūta, funds
exhausted, literally "fucked away".
Futuō, unlike the English word "fuck", was more frequently used in erotic and celebratory
senses rather than derogatory ones or insults. A woman of Pompeii wrote the graffito
fututa sum hic ("I got laid here")[60] and prostitutes, canny at marketing, appear to have
written other graffiti complimenting their customers for their sexual prowess: Felix bene
futuis ("Lucky boy, you fuck well"); Victor bene valeas qui bene futuis ("Victorious, best
wishes to one who fucks well"). It is famously used in Catullus 32:
sed domī maneās parēsque nōbīs
novem continuās futūtiōnēs.
("but you remain at home and prepare for us
nine acts of fucking, one after the other.")
Futuō in its active voice was used of women only when it was imagined that they were
taking the active role thought appropriate to the male partner by the Romans. The woman
in Martial 7.70 is described as a tribas, a lesbian.
Ipsārum tribadum tribas, Philaeni



rēctē, quam futuis, vocās amīcam
("Lesbian of all lesbians, Philaenis,
you are right to call the woman you fuck, your 'girlfriend'.")
Other more neutral synonyms for futuō in Latin include ineō, inīre, literally "to enter", as in
this sentence from Suetonius, supposedly from a letter written by Mark Antony (lover of
Queen Cleopatra) to his brother-in-law Octavian (later to become the Emperor
Augustus):[61]
quid tē mūtāvit? quia rēgīnam ineō? ... tū deinde sōlam Drūsillam inīs?
("What has changed you? Is it because I'm sleeping with the queen? ... So is Drusilla
the only woman you sleep with?")
The word coeō, coīre, literally "to go with," whence Latin and English coitus, is also used
euphemistically for sexual intercourse, but it is not exactly a synonym for futuere. It can be
used for both men and women, and also of animals and birds.[62]
Another word found on Pompeian inscriptions was c(h)alāre, which appears to be a
borrowing from the Greek χαλάω (khaláō) "loosen".[63] A Pompeian inscription says
Dionysius qua hora vult licet chalare ("Dionysius is allowed to fuck whenever he wants
to").[64] The Latin word laxāre appears to be used in the same sense in Priapeia 31: haec
meī tē ventris arma laxābunt ("these weapons of my belly will relax you" (of pēdīcātiō).[65]
Adams (1982) lists a large number of other euphemisms for the sexual act,[66] such as this
one from Juvenal (6.126):
ac resupīna iacēns cūnctōrum absorbuit ictūs
("And lying on her back she absorbed the blows of all and sundry")
In the Romance languages
Futuō, a core item of the lexicon, lives on in most of the Romance languages, sometimes
with its sense somewhat weakened: Catalan fotre, French foutre, Spanish joder,
Portuguese foder, Galician foder, Romanian fute (futere), Italian fottere. A famous ribald
song in Old Occitan sometimes attributed to the troubadour William IX of Aquitaine reads:
Tant las fotei com auziretz:
Cen e quatre vint et ueit vetz,
Q'a pauc no-i rompei mos corretz
E mos arnes
("I fucked them as much as you will hear:
a hundred and eighty-eight times.



I most nearly broke my equipment
-- and my tool.")
The aggressive sense of English "fuck" and "screw" was not strongly attached to futuō in
Latin. Instead, these aggressive connotations attached themselves to pēdīcāre "to
sodomise" and irrumāre "to force fellatio" respectively, which were used with mock
hostility in Catullus 16:
Pēdīcābō ego vōs et irrumābō,
Aurēlī pathice et cinaede Fūrī,
quī mē ex versiculīs meīs putāstis,
quod sunt molliculī, parum pudīcum.
("I will bugger and facefuck you,
pervert Aurelius and faggot Furius,
since you thought me indecent
because my poems are somewhat sissified.")
The passive voice, pēdīcārī, is used of the person who is forced to submit to anal sex, as in
Priapeia 35, in which the god Priapus threatens a thief:
pēdīcābere, fūr, semel; sed īdem
sī dēprēnsus eris bis, irrumābō.
("You will be buggered, thief, on the first offence; but if
you are caught a second time, I will stick it in your mouth.")
There is some doubt in the dictionaries whether the correct spelling was ped- or paed
(Lewis and Short give the latter). Bücheler (1915, p. 105) argues that ped- is correct on the
basis of the following epigram in the Priapeia (no. 67):
PĒnelopēs prīmam DĪdōnis prīma sequātur
et prīmam CAdmi syllaba prīma REmī,
quodque fit ex illīs, mihi tū dēprēnsus in hortō,
fūr, dabis: hāc poenā culpa luenda tua est.
("Let the first syllable of 'Penelope' be followed by the first of 'Dido',
and the first of 'Cadmus' by the first of 'Remus',
and what comes out of them is what you will pay to me if you are caught in the garden,
thief; this is the penalty you will pay for your crime.")
Pēdīcātor and pēdīco (noun)
Pēdīcāre: to sodomise



The word pēdīcātor ("buggerer") is used in a poem by Catullus's friend the orator Licinius
Calvus quoted by Suetonius (Caesar 49), in which the King of Bithynia is referred to as
pēdīcātor Caesaris ("the buggerer of Caesar"), referring to a rumour that in his youth Julius
Caesar had had an affair with king Nicomedes.
Martial on the other hand preferred to use the shorter form pēdīcō or pēdīco, of the same
meaning,[67] for example at 11.87:
dīves erās quondam: sed tunc pēdīco fuistī
et tibi nūlla diū fēmina nōta fuit.
nunc sectāris anūs. ō quantum cōgit egestās!
illa futūtōrem tē, Charidēme, facit.
("Once you were rich; but in those days you were a pēdīco,
and for a long time no woman was known to you.
Now you chase after old women. O the things that poverty forces one to do!
That woman is making a fucker out of you, Charidemus!")
The activities of a pēdīco are hinted at in the following lines of Martial (12.85):
pēdīcōnibus ōs olēre dīcis.
hoc sī, sīcut ais, Fabulle, vērum est:
quid tu crēdis olēre cunnilingīs?
("You say that buggerers' mouths stink.
If this is true as you say, Fabullus,
what do you think the mouth of pussy-lickers smells of?")
The various distinctions in sexual activity are made clear in the following poem of Martial
(2.28):
rīdētō multum quī tē, Sextille, cinaedum
dīxerit et digitum porrigitō medium.
sed nec pēdīco es nec tū, Sextille, futūtor,
calda Vetustīnae nec tibi bucca placet.
ex istīs nihil es fateor, Sextille: quid ergō es?
nescio, sed tū scīs rēs superesse duās.
("Laugh a lot, Sextillus, if anyone calls you effeminate (cinaedus),
and show him your middle finger;
but you're also neither a buggerer (pēdīco) nor a fucker (futūtor),
nor does the hot mouth of Vetustina please you.
You're none of those, I admit, Sextillus, so what are you?



I don't know, but you know there are only two other possibilities!")
The fourth line rules out Sextillus as an irrumātor; the two remaining possibilities were in
Roman eyes the most degrading, that he was either a cunnilingus or a fellātor.[68]
Etymology
Pēdīcāre is often thought to be a Greek loanword in Latin (from the noun παιδικά (paidika)
"boyfriend"), but the long "i" is an obstacle. Bücheler (1915, p. 105), who rejects this
etymology, suggests there may be a connection to pōdex and pēdō.
In Romance
Unlike futuō, the word pēdīcō has no reflexes in Romance.[69] The French slang word pédé
("male homosexual") is an abbreviated form of pédéraste, according to the Dictionnaire
historique de la langue française.
Irrumāre: to make suck
Irrumāre, which in English is denoted by the passive construction "to be sucked", is an
active verb in Latin, since the irrumātor was considered to be the active partner, the
fellātor the passive. Irrumātio is the counterpart of fellātio; in Roman terms, which are the
opposite way round to modern conceptions, the giver of oral sex inserts his penis into the
mouth of the receiver.
To be forced to submit to oral sex was apparently a worse punishment than to be
sodomised. Martial (2.47) advises one effeminate man who is having an adulterous affair,
and who would not perhaps have objected too much if the husband punished him by
sodomising him:
cōnfīdīs natibus? non est pēdīco marītus;
quae faciat duo sunt: irrumat aut futuit.
("Do you rely on your buttocks (to avoid a worse punishment)? Your girlfriend's
husband is not a sodomiser.
He does two things only: puts it in your mouth or screws women.")
According to Adams (1982, p. 126-7), it was a standard joke to speak of irrumātio as a
Irrumāre and fellāre: oral sex



means of silencing someone. Martial (3.96) writes:
garris quasi moechus et futūtor;
sī tē prendero, Gargilī, tacēbis.
("You gossip like an adulterer and a womaniser;
but if I catch you, Gargilius, you will be quiet!")
Irrumātio was seen as a hostile act that enemies might inflict on one. An inscription
says:[70]
mālim mē amīcī fellent quam inimīcī irrument
("I would prefer my friends to suck me than that my enemies make me suck them.")
It is also a standard threat made by the god Priapus, protector of orchards, to potential
adult male thieves, as in Priapeia 13:
percīdēre, puer, moneō: futuēre, puella:
barbātum fūrem tertia poena manet
("You will be thoroughly 'cut', boy, I warn you; girl, you will be fucked;
for the bearded thief, a third penalty awaits.")
Fellāre: to suck
The word fellāre originally had an innocent sense, meaning to suck the teat or to suck milk,
but in classical times the sexual sense was predominant. The verb fellō and the nouns
fellātor and (less often) the feminine fellātrīx are common in graffiti, and the first two also
occur several times in Martial's epigrams.[71] The practice was thought particularly
degrading for a man, and Martial, mocking a certain butch lesbian, writes (7.67):
nōn fellat – putat hoc parum virīle
sed plānē mediās vorat puellās
("She does not suck cocks – she thinks this not masculine enough
but absolutely devours the middle parts of girls.")
Fellō was generally used absolutely, without an object.[72] A Pompeian wall inscription says
Murtis bene felas ("Myrtis, you suck well"),[73] and another says Romula cum suo hic fellat
et uubique ("Romula does fellatio with her boyfriend here and everywhere").[74]
Fellō leaves little trace in Romance languages, being replaced by sūgere ("to suck") and its
derivatives.
Lingere and lambere: to lick



The verb lingō ("I lick") was common in both sexual and non-sexual contexts. As a sexual
term, it could have cūlum, mentulam, or cunnum as its object.[75]
Its synonym lambere was also sometimes used in a sexual sense. Martial (3.81) criticises a
eunuch who presumed to have oral sex with women:
haec dēbet mediōs lambere lingua virōs
("That tongue of yours ought to be licking the middle parts of men (not women)")
Glūbere "to take the bark off", "peel" and dēglūbere "to take the husk off", "to skin, flay"
are famously used in a sexual sense in two places in Latin literature by Catullus and
Ausonius.[76] It has been argued that the meaning is to pull back a man's foreskin, in order
to masturbate him. Ausonius (Ep. 71), after mentioning various perversions (obscēnās
venerēs), says:
Crispa tamen cūnctās exercet corpore in ūnō
dēglūbit, fellat, mōlītur per utramque cavernam,
nē quid inexpertum frūstrā moritūra relinquat
("Crispa, however, practices all the perversions in one body:
she 'peels', she sucks, she puts it in either hole,
lest she leave anything untried before she dies.")
What seems to shock Ausonius is that Crispa actively enjoyed taking an active role in such
practices rather than passively submitting to male desires as was the norm.
The other sexual use of this word is in Catullus (57), who says in a moment of bitterness:
Caelī, Lesbia nostra, Lesbia illa,
illa Lesbia, quam Catullus ūnam
plūs quam sē atque suōs amāvit omnēs,
nunc in quadriviīs et angiportīs
glūbit magnanimī Remī nepōtēs.
("Caelius, our Lesbia, that Lesbia,
that one woman whom Catullus
loved more than himself and all his dear ones
now on crossroads and in alleys
'peels' the grandsons of magnanimous Remus.")
Glūbere: to "peel"



Some, noting that in Italian the phrases cavar la pelle, scorticare ("debark") can mean
"strip someone of their money", and similar uses of tondēre ("to shear") and dēglūbere ("to
skin") in Latin, have argued that Catullus is also using the word in a non-sexual sense; that
is, Lesbia is acting like a prostitute and fleecing the spendthrift Roman young men
(nepōtēs) of their money.[77][78]
Cēveō (cēvēre, cēvī) and crīsō (crīsāre etc.) are basic Latin obscenities that have no exact
English equivalents. Crīsō referred to the actions of the female partner in sexual
intercourse (i.e. grinding or riding on a penis); as, similarly to the case in English, futuō,
which is often translated "fuck", primarily referred to the male action (i.e. thrusting,
pounding, slamming). Cēveō referred to the similar activity of the passive partner in anal
sex.
Etymology
Both of these verbs are of fairly obscure origin.
Unlike some of the vocabulary of homosexuality in Latin (pathicus, cinaedus), cēveō seems
not to be of Greek origin. Francis A. Wood relates it to an Indo-European root *kweu- or
*qeu-, relating to a variety of back and forth motions.
Usage
Cēveō always refers to a male taking the passive role in anal sex. Martial 3.95 contains the
phrase:
sed pēdīcāris, sed pulchrē, Naevole, cēvēs.
("But you get buggered and you wiggle your arse so prettily, Naevolus.")
Crīsō appears to have had a similar meaning, but to have been used of the female. Again
Martial 10.68:
Numquid, cum crīsās, blandior esse potes?
Tū licet ēdiscās tōtam referāsque Corinthon,
Nōn tamen omnīnō, Laelia, Lāis eris.
("Could you possibly be prettier as you grind? You learn easily, and could do
everything they do in Corinth; but you'll never be Lais, Laelia.")
Cēvēre and crīsāre: to waggle



Lais was a famous prostitute or courtesan, and Corinth was the site of a major temple of
Aphrodite; the temple employed more than a thousand cult prostitutes.
Synonyms and metaphors
These words have few synonyms or metaphors, and belong almost to a sort of technical
vocabulary.
In the Romance languages
Both words seem to have been lost in Romance.
This word is found twice in the poet Martial, but apparently not in earlier writers.[79] Martial
writes in one poem (11.104):
masturbābantur Phrygiī post ōstia servī,
Hectoreō quotiēns sēderat uxor equō
("The Phrygian slaves used to masturbate behind the doors
whenever Hector's wife sat on her husband's 'horse'.")
The word masturbātor also occurs. In 14.203 Martial writes of a Spanish girl from Gādēs
(Cádiz):
tam tremulum crīsat, tam blandum prūrit, ut ipsum
masturbātōrem fēcerit Hippolytum.
("She wiggles so sexily and itches for it so charmingly
that she would have made a masturbator out of Hippolytus himself!")
Hippolytus was famous in mythology for refusing the advances of his stepmother Phaedra.
Etymology
Lewis and Short suggest that the word masturbārī may be derived from manū stuprārī "to
defile oneself with a hand", and this is the usual view, and supported ("with some
hesitation") by J.N. Adams.[80] Another view,[81][82] however, is that it comes from *mās +
turbāre ("to excite the penis"), assuming an otherwise unattested meaning of "penis" for
mās ("male"). The supporters of this view cite another word mascarpiōnem (from
Masturbārī: to masturbate



mascarpiō), which occurs once in Latin literature in Petronius (134.5), and which appears
from the context to mean "beating the penis with a wand (to stimulate it)". It is argued that
in this word, the element mās- may be the same as in masturbārī. Yet another proposed
etymology is that the element masturb- derives from a Proto-Indo-European root
*mostrgh- meaning "brain, marrow", and hence "semen".[83]
Synonyms and euphemisms
Martial (9.41) criticises a Roman gentleman for masturbating, using the phrase:
paelice laevā ūteris et Venerī servit amīca manus
("you use your left hand as a concubine and your hand serves Venus as your
girlfriend")
The hand used for masturbating by the Romans was evidently the left one, as Martial 11.73
confirms.[84] (Compare also the fragment of the satirist Lucilius quoted above in the
section on mūtō.)
In another poem (11.22) Martial advises a friend:
inguina saltem parce futūtrīcī sollicitāre manū
("do at least cease from troubling your groins with copulating hand").
He continues:
lēvibus in puerīs plūs haec quam mentula peccat
et faciunt digitī praecipitantque virum
("In smooth-skinned boys this (i.e their hand) sins more than their cock,
and their fingers hasten the process of turning them into a man.")
This apparently dates back to a belief of Aristotle that vigorous sexual activity caused a
boy's voice to turn rapidly into that of a man.[85]
In another poem (2.43), however, Martial admits that he himself for want of a sexual
partner sometimes resorts to the practice:
at mihi succurrit prō Ganymēde manus
("but as for me, my hand has to serve instead of Ganymede").
In another (11.46), addressed to a man who finds it difficult in middle age to get an
erection, Martial uses the word trūdō ("I shove" or "prod") to signify masturbation:[86]
trūditur et digitīs pannūcea mentula lassīs



nec levat extīnctum sollicitāta caput
("and your shrivelled dick is prodded by your fingers until they get tired,
but doesn't raise its worn out head even when provoked").
The frequentative form of trūdō is trūsāre ("to thrust or shove repeatedly"). This occurs in
only one place, in Catullus 56:
dēprendī modo pūpulum puellae
trūsantem: hunc ego, sī placet Diōnae,
prō tēlō rigidā meā cecīdī.
("Recently I caught the ward of my girfriend
'thrusting'; this boy, if it please Dione,
using my 'hard one' as a weapon, I 'cut'.")
The meaning of trūsantem here is disputed. "Masturbating" was the interpretation of A. E.
Housman;[87][88] he also wanted to read prō tēlō as prōtēlō with the meaning "there and
then". Others,[89][90][91] however, understand Catullus to mean that the boy was caught
having sex with a girl; in which case, prōtēlō probably means "in a threesome", since a
prōtēlum, according to the agricultural writer Cato the Elder, was a team of three oxen
pulling a plough.[92] Uden (2007) translates: "I just caught a kid banging his girlfriend",
explaining that pūpulum is a derogatory diminutive.
The verb caedere (literally "to cut" or "kill") is used as slang for homosexual penetration
elsewhere in Latin literature, such as at Priapeia 26.10, a poem in which Priapus boasts
that in his earlier days solēbam fūrēs caedere quamlibet valentēs ("I used to 'cut' (i.e.
sodomise) thieves, however strong they were").[93] Dione, was the mother of Aphrodite,
goddess of love; according to a passage in Homer's Iliad book 5, she cared for Aphrodite
when the latter was pierced by Diomedes' weapon in a battle. The implication is that her
services might be needed here after Catullus had dealt with the boy.
Cacō, cacāre was the chief Latin word for defecation.
Etymology
The word has a distinguished Indo-European parentage, which may perhaps relate to
nursery words or children's slang that tends to recur across many different cultures. It
would appear to be cognate with the Greek noun κοπρος, kopros, meaning "poop" (hence,
Cacāre: to defecate



coprophilia). It also exists in Germanic; in German, Swedish (kack), Scots (as both noun
and verb, cack or cackie, the diminutive),[94] whilst English "poppiecock" derives from
Dutch pappe kak, "diarrhea". It exists in Turkish (kaka), Irish and Scottish Gaelic (cac),
Hebrew, Hungarian, Ukrainian (какати), Russian, Lithuanian and Persian/Isfahani accent
(keke). In British English, "caca" is occasionally used as childish slang for excrement
(similar to American English "poop"), a word whose level of obscene loading varies from
country to country; whilst in Scotland and in Ireland, "cack" is occasionally used either as a
mild interjection, or as an impolite adjective to mean of poor quality, broken, nonsense. It
also exists as a loan in Finnish (kakka). The derivatives of this Latin word appear in
Spanish, Catalan, Portuguese, Italian (cacca), Romanian, and French. Also, in Slavic
languages: kakati.
Usage
The verb is usually used intransitively. Martial (1.92.11) says:
non cūlum, neque enim est cūlus, quī non cacat ōlim
("not your arsehole, for something that never shits isn't an arsehole")
However, in the phrase below, from Catullus 36, it is transitive:
Annāles Volusī, cacāta carta,
("Annals of Volusius, paper defiled by shit")[95]
Synonyms and metaphors
Few synonyms are attested in Classical Latin, apart from a word cunīre, attested by the
grammarian Festus (but nowhere else) in the meaning stercus facere. The word dēfēcāre
comes much later.
A euphemism which occurs in Petronius (116) is suā rē causā facere:
habuimus ... et pānem autopȳrum de suō sibī, quem ego mālō quam candidum; <nam>
et vīrēs facit, et cum meā rē causā faciō, nōn plōrō
("We also had whole-wheat bread, which I prefer to white, since it gives you strength
and also when I relieve myself, I don't feel pain.")
The same euphemism is used in Petronius of relieving oneself of gas (see below).
In the Romance languages



Cacāre is preserved unaltered in Sardinian and the southern Italian dialects, and with little
alteration in Italian (cagare). It becomes Galician, Catalan, Spanish, and Portuguese cagar,
in Vegliot Dalmatian kakuor, in French chier, and in Romanian as căcare (the act of taking a
dump) or a (se) căca. (Feces are referred to as caca in French, Catalan, Romanian (besides
căcat) and Spanish childhood slang, while Portuguese and Romanian use the very same
word with the general meaning of anything that looks or smells malodorous or reminiscent
of excrement.) German kacken, Dutch kakken, Czech kakat, Lithuanian kakoti, Russian
какать (kakat'), Icelandic kúka, Bosnian kakiti etc. are all slang words meaning "to
defecate", most of them having roughly the same level of severity as the English
expression "take a dump".
Merda is the basic Latin word for excrement. Frequently used, it appears in most of the
Romance languages.
Etymology
Merda represents Indo-European *s-merd-, whose root sense was likely "something
malodorous." It is cognate with German Mist (dung), Lithuanian "smird ́ėti" ("to stink"),
Russian "смерд ́еть" (smerdét', "to stink") and Polish śmierdzieć ( "to stink").
Usage
The word merda is attested in classical texts mostly in veterinary and agricultural contexts,
meaning "manure". Cato the Elder uses it, as well as stercus, while the Mulomedicina
Chironis speaks of merda būbula, "cattle manure".
Unlike the English word "shit", merda could be both singular and plural. In Horace (Satires
1.8.37), a talking statue of Priapus says:
mentior at sīquid, merdīs caput inquiner albīs
corvōrum atque in me veniat mictum atque cacātum
Iūlius, et fragilis Pediātia, fūrque Vorānus.
("But if I'm telling a lie, may my head be spattered with the white droppings
of ravens, and may Julius, delicate Pediatia, and the thief Voranus
come to piss and shit on me!")
Merda: feces



In one of his verse fables (4.18.25), Phaedrus speaks of some dogs who, on hearing
thunder,
repente odōrem mixtum cum merdīs cacant
("suddenly they shit out a stink mixed with turds")
The word can also be used in a metaphorical sense, as at Martial 3.17, speaking of a tart
which had been blown on by a man with impure breath (caused no doubt by oral sex) to
cool it down:[96]
Sed nēmō potuit tangere: merda fuit.
("But nobody could touch it: it was a piece of shit.")
Synonyms and metaphors
The politer terms for merda in Classical Latin were stercus (gen. stercoris), "manure" and
fimum or fimus, "filth." Stercus was used frequently in the Vulgate, as in its well-known
translation of Psalm 112e7: (Psalm 113e7 in the KJV.)
Suscitāns ā terrā inopem, et dē stercore ērigēns pauperem.
("Raising up the needy from the earth : and lifting up the poor out of the dunghill."
DRC)
In Classical Latin, faex, plural faecēs, meant the dregs, such as are found in a bottle of
wine; the word did not acquire the sense of feces until later.
In the Romance languages
Merda is productive in the Romance languages, and is the obvious etymon of French
merde, Spanish mierda, and in Vegliot Dalmatian miarda. It is preserved unaltered in
Catalan, Galician, Italian, Portuguese, and Sardinian. It was preserved in Romanian too, not
for feces, where căcat (derived from caco) is used instead, but in the word dezmierda,
originally meaning "to clean the bottom of (an infant)"; subsequently becoming "to cuddle"
or "to fondle".[97]
Pēdere
Pēdō, pēdere, pepēdī, pēditum is the basic Latin word for passing intestinal wind. In the
Pēdere and vissīre: passing wind



Sermones 1.8, 46, Horace writes:
Nam, displōsa sonat quantum vēsīca, pepēdī
diffissā nate fīcus. . .
Christopher Smart translates this passage as "from my cleft bum of fig-tree I let out a fart,
which made as great an explosion as a burst bladder". The "I" of this satire is the god
Priapus, and Smart explains that he was made of fig-tree wood which split through being
poorly prepared.
Martial also uses the word several times, including the following (10.15):
nīl aliud videō, quō tē crēdāmus amīcum,
quam quod mē cōram pēdere, Crispe, solēs.
("I don't see any other reason why I should believe you a friend,
other than that you are in the habit of farting in front of me, Crispus.")
A word oppēdere ("to fart in the face of, mock") is used in Horace (Sat. 1.9.70).
Catullus also uses the noun pēditum in one of his poems (54).
Vissīre
A rarer word, meaning "to fart silently", was vissīre. This is hinted at in Cicero's letter ad
Fam. 9.22, where he says that the word divīsiō is potentially obscene, in the same way as
the word intercapēdō.[98] The word is not recorded in Lewis and Short's Latin Dictionary
and does not appear to have been used by any extant author. However, the Oxford Latin
Dictionary quotes an inscription from a public bath in Ostia which says[99]
vissīre tacitē Chīlōn docuit subdolus
("cunning Chilon taught how to fart silently").
Judging from derivatives in some of the daughter languages (see below), there was also a
noun *vissīna "a silent fart", but no trace of this is found in the extant texts.
Crepāre
The noise made by escaping flatulence was usually called crepitus, a word which could
refer to "a noise" of various kinds, and the verb crepāre was used of breaking wind
noisily.[100] Martial writes of a certain man, who after an embarrassing incident of
flatulence when praying in the temple of Jupiter, was careful in future to take precautions:



cum vult in Capitōlium venīre,
sellās ante petit Patercliānās
et pēdit deciēsque vīciēsque.
sed quamvīs sibi cāverit crepandō,
compressīs natibus Iovem salūtat.
("Whenever he wants to come to the Capitolium (to pray)
he first heads for the toilets of Paterclus
and farts ten or twenty times.
But however much he takes precautions by breaking wind,
he still salutes Jupiter with clenched buttocks.")
Euphemisms
In Petronius (47), in the speech of the vulgar millionaire Trimalchio, euphemisms suā rē
causā facere and facere quod sē iuvet "do what helps one" are both used for relieving
oneself of wind:
itaque sī quis vestrum voluerit suā rē causā facere, nōn est quod illum pudeātur. ... ego
nūllum putō tam magnum tormentum esse quam continēre ... nec tamen in triclīniō ullum
vetuō facere quod sē iuvet, et medicī vetant continēre.
("And so it any of you wants to relieve himself (of wind), there's no need for him to be
ashamed. Personally I think there's nothing worse than holding it in. And I never forbid
anyone to relieve himself of wind even in the dining-room, and doctors forbid people
to hold it in as well.")
Etymology
The antiquity of pēdō and its membership in the core inherited vocabulary is clear from its
reduplicating perfect stem. It is cognate with Greek πέρδομαι (perdomai), English fart,
Bulgarian prdi, Polish pierdzieć, Russian пердеть (perdet'), Lithuanian persti, Sanskrit
pardate, and Avestan pərəδaiti, all of which mean the same thing.
Vissīre is clearly onomatopoeic. The Old Norse fisa may be compared,[101] although the
correspondence in sounds is not exact.
In the Romance languages and English
Pēdere and pēditum survive in Romance. In French, the noun pet from pēditum and the
derived verb péter (for earlier poire from pēdere) are very much alive. In Catalan, the
verb is petar-se and the noun is pet. In Spanish the noun pedo as well as the verbs



peerse and pedorrear are similarly derived. Portuguese peido and peidar(-se), (-dei) and
Galician peido and peidar(se) are related. Italian peto is less common than scorreggia and
its derived verb scorreggiare.
The English word petard, found mostly in the cliché "hoist with his own petard", comes
from an early explosive device, the noise of which was likened to that of farting. English
also has petomania for a musical performance of breaking intestinal wind, and petomane
for the performer, after Le Pétomane, a French performer active in the early 20th
century.[102]
Vissīre, though rare in Latin texts, has derivates in several Romance languages, such as
Romanian beșí (verb) and beșínă (noun);[103] French vesse (noun) and vesser
(verb).[104][105]
Mingō (infinitive mingere) and meiō (infinitive meiere) are two variant forms of what is likely
a single Latin verb meaning "to urinate", or in more vulgar usage, "to take a piss." The two
verbs share a perfect mixī or mīnxī, and a past participle mictum or minctum. It is likely that
mingō represents a variant conjugation of meiō with a nasal infix.
In Classical Latin, the form mingō was more common than meiō. In some Late Latin texts a
variant first conjugation form meiāre is attested. This is the form that is productive in
Romance.
The Classical Latin word micturīre became the accepted medical word meaning "to
urinate". It is the source of the English medical term "micturition reflex".
Usage
Martial's epigram 3.78 uses meiere and ūrīna to make a bilingual pun:
mīnxistī currente semel, Paulīne, carīnā.
meiere vīs iterum? iam 'Palinūrus' eris.
("Once you pissed off the side of a boat, Paulinus.
Do you want to piss again? then you will be Palinurus.")
(Note that palin is a Greek word meaning "once again." Palinurus was Aeneas's navigator
who was thrown overboard in the Aeneid.)
Mingere and meiere: urination



The verbs meiere and mingere could also be used euphemistically of sexual
intercourse.[106] Horace (Satires 1.2.44), speaking of the punishments meted out to
adulterers, says:
hunc permīnxērunt cālōnēs; quīn etiam illud
accidit, ut cuidam testīs caudamque salācem
dēmeterent ferrō.
("One got thoroughly 'pissed on' (i.e. raped) by the servants; it even
happened once that they cut off someone's balls and lecherous 'tail'
with a knife.")
Catullus (67.23) speaks of a father who "pissed in the lap of his own son" (ipse suī gnātī
mīnxerit in gremium), that is, had sex with his son's wife.
Urine
The most usual word for urine was ūrīna, which is attested in Latin as early as Cicero, and
became the usual polite term. The relationship with the Greek verb οὐρέω (oureō), "to
urinate", is not clear. In Classical Latin, however, the verb ūrīnārī meant "to dive into water",
and ūrīnātor was "a diver", ūrīnantēs "those who dive".
Catullus (37) writes contemptuously of a certain Spaniard who was one of the lovers of his
girlfriend Lesbia:
tū praeter omnēs ūne de capillātīs,
cunīculōsae Celtiberiae fīlī,
Egnātī. opāca quem bonum facit barba
et dēns Hibērā dēfricātus ūrīnā.
("You above all, one of the long-haired ones,
son of rabbit-filled Celtiberia,
Egnatius, made handsome by your dark beard,
and your teeth brushed clean with Iberian piss.")
Another word for urine, but less commonly used, was lōtium. This word relates to lavāre,
"to wash". The Romans, innocent of soap, collected urine as a source of ammonia to use in
laundering clothes. The early agricultural writer Cato, an advocate of cabbage, used this
word when he wrote (Res Rustica 156):
brassica alvum bonum facit lōtiumque
("Cabbage is good for the digestion and for the urine.")



Etymology
Meiere is an inherited Indo-European word. It relates to Sanskrit mehati, "urinates", Persian
mīz, "urine", Lithuanian myža, "he/she urinates", Greek ὀμείχειν (omeikhein), "to urinate",
which, taken together, point to an Indo-European *h3meiģh-. This IE root with a palatal ģh
was formerly mixed up (e. g. in Pokorny's IEW) with another one with velar *gh meaning
"mist" (Russian mgla), hence erroneous tentative overall translations like "to sprinkle" or
"to wet" which still turn up sometimes.
In the Romance languages
Though mingō represents the most common Classical Latin form, meiāre seems to have
been the popular form. This underlies Galician mexar, Portuguese mijar, and Spanish mear.
*Pissiāre represents a borrowing from the Germanic languages, and appears elsewhere in
the Romance territory, as in French pisser, Catalan pixar, Italian pisciare and Romanian a
(se) pișa, along with English to piss.
Further information: Prostitution in ancient Rome
Compared to the anatomical frankness of the Roman vocabulary about sexual acts and
body parts, the Roman vocabulary relating to prostitution seems euphemistic and
metaphorical.
Prostitutes were called meretrīx, "earner", and lupa, "she-wolf"; a brothel was a lupānar;
these words referred to the mercantile and perceived predatory activities of prostitutes.
The Latin verb prōstō meant "to be up for sale" and prōstituō meant "to expose for public
sale."
The poet Juvenal (6.120-3) describes how the disgraced Empress Messalina used to enjoy
playing the part of a prostitute in a brothel:
sed nigrum flāvō crīnem abscondente galērō
intrāvit calidum veterī centōne lupānar
et cellam vacuam atque suam; tunc nūda papillīs
prōstitit aurātīs titulum mentīta Lyciscae
("But hiding her black hair with a yellow wig,
wearing an old patchwork cloak, she entered the hot brothel
Latin words relating to prostitution



and an empty cell of her own; then she offered herself for sale nude
with her nipples covered in gold, using the false name of 'Lycisca'.")
The man in charge of the brothel, who dismissed the girls at closing time, was the pimp or
lēnō (Juvenal 6.127).
The neuter word scortum could refer to either a male or female prostitute.[107] This word
may relate to Latin scorteus, "made of leather or hide", much as English refers to the skin
trade. Lewis and Short quote Varro: pellem antīquī dīcēbant scortum ("in the old days
people referred to skin as scortum").
Another word for a male prostitute, notably one who is no longer a boy, is exolētus (literally
"grown up, adult").[108] Cicero (pro Milone, 21, 55) writes:
Clōdius, quī semper sēcum scorta, semper exolētōs, semper lupās dūceret
("Clodius, who always used to take with him whores, and male and female
prostitutes")
The verb scortor, scortārī, which occurs chiefly in Plautus, means "to go whoring" or "to
employ prostitutes". Plautus illustrates its use in Asinaria:
quandō mēcum pariter pōtant, pariter scortārī solent,
hanc quidem, quam nactus, praedam pariter cum illīs partiam.
("Whenever they go drinking with me, they also usually go whoring with me.
So I'll share this booty which I've captured with them equally.")
The important and productive words for a prostitute in Romance, *pūta or *pūtāna, are not
attested in Classical Latin, despite their many Romance derivatives: French putain and
pute, Italian puttana, Spanish, Filipino, Catalan, Portuguese and Galician puta. French
linguists state that they relate to Latin pūteō, pūtēre, "to stink," and thus represent yet
another metaphor.. Spaniards María Moliner (author of a famous dictionary of Spanish) and
Joan Coromines think they came from Vulgar Latin *putta, feminine form of *puttus, an
emphatic form of pūtus, "pure" or "boy". In Portugal, the word puto has the same
connotation as "small kid" or "little boy"; in Brazil, on the other hand, it is slang for "pissed
off" or enraged males in general or as a colloquial, mildly offensive term for male escorts
(more formally called prostitutos or michês) – the male counterpart of the slang puta, with
the same meanings.
The HBO/BBC2 original television series Rome depicts the city with the grit and grime that
In popular culture



is often absent from earlier productions, including that of language. But since the actors
speak English, Latin profanity is mostly seen in written graffiti, such as:
ATIA FELLAT, "Atia sucks"; "fellatio" is a noun derived from this verb.
ATIA AMAT OMNES, "Atia loves all [men]". Thus calling her a whore or slut.
CAESARI SERVILIA FUTATRIX, "Servilia is Caesar's bitch".
However, the character Titus Pullo says "cack!" occasionally when irritated, most likely a
derivative of caco above. And he and other characters use similar derivative words;
"cunny", "cunt", "cully".
