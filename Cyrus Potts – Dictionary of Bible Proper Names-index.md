PREFACE
The ever-increasing interest in biblical research and inquiry has also increased the demand for Bible dictionaries and encyclopedias, especially for those that deal with the etymology of proper names in the Scriptures. It may be affirmed, and easily proven, that scriptural names were not arbitrarily chosen but selected with the idea of defining the relation of the bearer to God and for the purpose of expressing some important general truth. The remarkable feature of sacred history is that God alone is exalted. This feature was por
trayed in the actions, conditions, and functions of men possessing names indicating natures either allied to or separated from the Divine.
Many persons have read the Bible from early youth but have failed to find any permanent help from its sacred pages. It has been to them little more than a history of an ancient nation, the poetry of an Eastern people, the story of a wondrous life, or a collection of precepts far too pure and undeviating for everyday life. To Bible students who do their own thinking, who delve beneath the surface and follow truth
wherever it may lead, there is nothing more helpful than a familiarity with the literal meaning of proper names in the
Bible. We can no more fathom the profound depths of the
Scriptures without a knowledge of the literal meaning of these names than we can solve mathematical problems without a knowledge of numerical values. The value of a full understanding of the original significance of the proper names in the Bible is beyond any possible computation and measurement, and the literal meaning of these names is the keynote of this understanding. Realizing the need of a concise and comprehensive dic
tionary of the proper names in the Bible led me to compile such a work. This dictionary is composed of definitions selected from accredited authorities. It is the result of extended research and credit of indebtedness to these authorities is unreservedly made.

8 DICTIONARY OF BIBLE PROPER NAMES
With the increased and systematic study now given to various portions of the Bible and the growing interest in Scripture exegesis, among all denominations, the literal meaning of proper names with which the Scriptures abound can hardly fail to elicit a larger share of investigation. Each name in the Bible has its own distinct significance and fills an important place in the understanding of the Bible. Therefore, let us seek by study, reason, and revelation, to understand the original significance of these names and reap the benefits which will accrue from this understanding. Cyrus A. Potts.



INTRODUCTION
Originally proper names were not chosen to merely designate persons, places, etc., but to indicate some distinct characteristic that is known to belong to them. This applies to all names whether it be that of the Supreme Being or of the most obscure person or place. The distinct characteristic of the Supreme Being is power. The principal Hebrew name for the Supreme Being, Elohim, translated "God" in the English Bible, is derived from an ancient Hebrew root denoting power. The plural form, Elohim (Gods), instead of pointing to polytheism is applied to God as the fullness
of power—the eternal Godhead (Rom. 1: 20). Jehovah, mean
ing "the existing one," another Hebrew name for the Supreme Being, occupies the same relation to Elohim that force does to power. Force is power manifested, Jehovah is the manifested or revealed Elohim. Thus the expression, Lord God (Jehovah-Elohim), meaning powrer manifested, indicates the entire administration of God by which he manifests himself and his attributes to men. The Bible tells us that no man can see God's face and live.
No one has seen power of any kind at any time; all that the physical senses can apprehend is the manifestation of power. Power can be seen only a posteriori; that is, from its manifestation. Elohim can be seen only through his manifestation, that is, the Invisible is a true reading of the visible (Rom. 1:20). The scriptural expression, "to walk in the name of God" is to experience his power. Such expressions as "the name of Christ" (2 Tim. 2: 19), "to believe in Christ's name" (John 1:12), "saved by his name" (Acts 4:12), "to have life through his name" (John 20:31), refer to the manifestation of divine power as demonstrated by Christ Jesus. Names are used in the Bible to portray good and evil agencies and forces, uniting in a perfect degree that to which the name applies, that is, scriptural names are true to type. Rightly understood these names focus the human mind on individual9



10 DICTIONARY OF BIBLE PROPER NAMES
ities instead of persons and are infinitely more important as a type than as a distinguishing label. The Bible has a fourfold sense, consisting of the literal, or historical; allegorical; moral; spiritual. Proper names enter into all these significations and are the "warp and weft" of Scripture exegesis. Hence the importance of knowing the meaning of Scripture proper names at once becomes evident. In this work all proper names occurring in the Old and
New Testaments are defined. These names are arranged in alphabetical order and the method of dealing with them is as follows
:
I. Pronunciation. A diacritical mark is employed for every clear vowel sound, and when not marked the vowel is invariably mute. Unaccented syllables are separated by a hyphen (-). Compound names are separated by an en dash (-). Primary accent (')• Secondary accent (").
a as in make; a as in courage; & as in add; & as in dare; a as in star; a as in all; a obscure as in liar.
e as in eve; $ as in serene; 8 as in end; e as in her; e obscure
as in fuel.
I as in sight; i as in idea; i as in pity; l obtuse as in firm;
l obscure as in ruin. 6 as in bold; 6 as in obey; 6 as in lord; 6 as in odd; obscure
as in valor.
U as in use; tl as in humane; u as in rumor; ll as in full; ii
as in up; ii as in urn.
y as in style; y as in myth. g soft as in cent; C hard not marked. £ soft as in Genesis; g hard before e and i, as in Gethsemane and Gihon; g hard otherwise not marked. § as z in muse; X as gs in Alexander; x as ks in Exodus.
II. Lexical References. Immediately following each name is a number which refers to a corresponding number in the Hebrew and Greek Lexicons in Strong's Concordance of the



INTRODUCTION 11
Bible. Numbers preceded by the letter "H" refer to the Hebrew Lexicon, and those preceded by the letter "G" refer to the Greek Lexicon. These lexicons contain all the Hebrew, Chaldee, and Greek words in the original Scriptures, showing the derivation and common meaning of such words, and giving a complete list of the different English words into which each word is translated in the Bible. These lexical explanations are so clear that even the original languages in which the Scriptures were written are brought in easy reach of every reader of English. III. Latin Meaning. The Latin meanings of names follow the lexical references. These definitions invariably throw some light on the significance of proper names and assist the student, hermeneutically, in the interpretation of the Bible. Although the original Scriptures were given to man in the Hebrew and Greek, they have since extended to every tongue and nation. At a very early period a Latin version was made from the Septuagint, and the Latin language has since occupied a prominent place in biblical translations. The superscription placed over Jesus at the crucifixion was written in Greek, Latin, and Hebrew. Luke 23 : 38. IV. Literal Meaning. The importance of a full explication of proper names in the Bible cannot be overestimated. The literal meaning of these names is the chief factor in determining their significance. Proper names among the Jews were all significant and in most instances expressive of religious feeling. In the Elder Scriptures the Jews formulated a complete system of doctrines by employing a peculiar set of names,
words, and phrases, figuratively. In the New Testament this nomenclature is approved and often quoted.
V. Identification. After the punctuation mark ( :—) appears
a brief identification of the name under consideration. This will also be found an aid to the student in determining the significance of proper names, as it is highly important to know whether the name is of a person, place, river, mountain, etc., as each has its own peculiar significance. Hebrew names were conferred not merely for the purpose of identification but because of an idea they expressed. This underlying idea can still be made apparent by taking into consid



12 DICTIONARY OF BIBLE PROPER NAMES
eration historical events, i. e., identification, and the literal meaning of the name.
VI. Comparisons. A name having a similar meaning to the one under consideration is given in capital letters and enclosed in brackets. VII. Scriptural References. In each instance a single scriptural reference is given. These references in some manner verify the information that precedes them. VIII. General Signification. The rules laid down herein, if applied, will enable any Bible student to determine the general signification of all Bible proper names. In some instances it will require a vast amount of study and thought to get the significance of names, while in other cases it may be easily determined and expressed in a single word, as in the case of Abraham,
signifying fidelity, Nathan, conscience, Noah, repose, etc. Many of the names occur only once and the historical events relative thereto are very meager, making it difficult to arrive at their significance. The meaning of those names occurring more frequently and interwoven more closely with historical events is less difficult to determine. It will be noted that in almost every instance more than one definition is given to each name. This is due to the fact that there is a variation of opinion of different authorities relative to the meaning of names; however, there is usually a similarity in these definitions. In cases where the
definitions are at variance it may be attributed to the following causes: the English rendering of the name and the original word are at variance; the root word uncertain or unknown; names had a colloquial meaning, therefore, the definition of a single name might include the meaning in the Hebrew, Aramaic, Arabic, and Babylonian tongues and each be at variance with the other.

SACRED BOOKS OF THE HUMAN RACE
The sacred books of all nations are full of high thoughts
and noble utterances. Such are the Koran of the Mohammedans, the Tripitaka of the Buddhists, the Yin-king of the Chinese, the Vedas of the Hindoos, the Zend-Avesta of the Parsees, and the Scriptures of the Christians. The Koran is the most recent, dating from the seventh century after the Christian era. It is a compound of quotations from both
the Old and New Testaments and from the Talmud. It is
the work of Mohammed and reflects the various experiences of the author. The Tripitaka contain sublime morals and pure aspirations, Gautama, the founder of Buddhism, the author, lived in the sixth century B. C. The sacred writings of the Chinese are called Yih-king, or Five Kings, the word "king" meaning web of cloth. From this it is presumed that they were originally written on five rolls of cloth. They contain the wise sayings from sages on the duties of life and are traceable back to the eleventh century before the Christian era. The Vedas, a collection of hymns, more or less sublime, are the most ancient books in the language of the Hindoos, but they do not antedate the twelfth century B. C. The Zend-Avesta of the Parsees, next to the Christian Bible, is reckoned among scholars as being the greatest and most learned of sacred writings. Zoroaster, whose sayings it contains, lived and worked in the twelfth century before our era. Moses wrote the Pentateuch fifteen hundred years before the birth of Jesus, therefore that portion of the Scriptures is at least three hundred years older than the most ancient of other sacred writings. The Eddas, a semi-sacred work of the old Scandinavian tribes, was first given to the world in the fourteenth century A. D.

GENEALOGY OF JESUS THE CHRIST
Genealogical lists are found in both the Old and New Testaments. The genealogy of Jesus the Christ is the only
one given in the New Testament. There are two lists of the human ancestors of Jesus; one, given in the first chapter of Matthew, beginning with Abraham, and the other in the third chapter of Luke, beginning with Adam. It will be noted that these two pedigrees of the Master do not harmonize and the differences between the lists given by Matthew and Luke have been variously explained. From an historical standpoint these lists are, no doubt, incomplete, but the value of them will be found to be not merely historical but in a delineation of spiritual unfoldment. Any student who will substitute the spiritual signification of these names for their literal meaning will find a continuity that relates a story beyond the mere history indicated. Some of the richest treasures of the Bible lie beneath what has been looked upon as mere genealogy. The real fabric is not upon the surface but beneath, in the original meaning of the proper names employed by scriptural writers.

THE NAMES OF THE HEBREW MONTHS
The terms for "month" and "moon" have the same close connection in the Hebrew language as in our own and in the Indo-European languages generally. The most important point in connection with the month of the Hebrews is its length, and the mode by which it is calculated. The moon played an important part in the life and history of the Hebrews as a measurer of time. Its very conspicuous and regularly occurring changes led all people in ancient days to use it for measuring time. Like so many other ancient peoples, the Hebrews also used the period during which the moon
accomplishes its changes as a unit of time—the month. Their
year was made up of twelve moon-months of twenty-nine and one-half days each. The Hebrews were also acquainted with the solar year. The discrepancy between the solar and lunar year they then smoothed over by means of an intercalary month inserted about every third year which was called Veadar, that is, the additional Adar, bringing up the
number to thirteen. No notice, however, is taken of such month in the Bible. The usual method of designating the months by their numerical order, e. g., "the second month" (Gen. 7: 11), "the fourth month" (2 Kings 15: 3), was generally retained even when the names were given; e. g., "in the month Zif, which is the second month" (1 Kings 6: 1), "in the third month, that is, the month of Sivan" (Esth. 8:9). The identification of the Hebrew months with our own cannot be effected with precision on account of the variations that must inevitably exist between the lunar and the solar month.
