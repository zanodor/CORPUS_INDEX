Vastu-shastra (5): Temple Architecture by D. N. Shukla | 1960 | --Chapter 12 - History of Hindu Temples (Prāsādas and Vimānas)
[quote] “If Hindu Temple is the grand Icon of the Supernal Man (“prāsādaṃ puruṣaṃ matvā pūjayet”),—Buddhist Stūpa is not lesser than it. It is a sacred structure akin to a mountain-temple to enshrine not the deity but the relics of that great Buddhist deity who was all against deification. If caves go with mountains, the cave-temples should also go with the Stūpas, the mountain-temples and the Buddhist architecture has a very rich heritage in this splendid side-branch of Indian Architecture. The Stūpa monuments at the renowned sites of Sanchi Barhut, Amaravati etc. arc a superb legacy of Indian art and a brief purview is called for...The earlier structure of a stūpa used to be formed by bricks which in the Vedic symbolism were the body of the sacrifice, later on the stone took the place of bricks. Thus the substances (the materials etc.) and the symbolism of the Buddhist stūpa and the Hindu temple are identical. Both are sacred places, shrines for devotion accompanied with respective rituals. Buddhist caitya-halls invariably house a stūpa. Chaitya is derived from citi”[unquote]

Chapter 4 - An outline History of Hindu Architecture [quote] Architectural traditions in the Ṛgveda:
Ṛgveda hymns (VII. 54-55) invoke Vāstoṣpati. as the special deity supposed to preside over building sites. Different explanations of Vāstoṣpati have been offered by different commentators. According to Devaraja Yajvā, Vāstu means the Antarikṣa and Vāstoṣpati indicates all heavenly deities which rightly fits in the later development of Vāstu-puruṣa whose different limbs constituted the abodes of the different deities as many as forty five...Vāstoṣpati is identified with Indra. He is also identified with Tvaṣṭṛ, the carpenter of the gods. Viśvakarmā is invoked as the Creator of the universe as a whole (X. 6 and 13-14) which very well fits in our concept of Viśvakarmā as the primordial planner and architect-creator. Similar references to Ṛbhus (disciples of Tvaṣṭṛ) and Vasus (the givers of dwellings) are also important—vide the geneology of Viśvakarmā, treated in the foregoing pages. In another hymn (1. 32. 2)Tvaṣṭā is said to have sharpened (Takṣa) the thunderbolt of Indra. This gave rise to what we know of Takṣaka as carpenter in later times. Yet in another hymn (vii. 33. 13) the birth of ‘Māna’ is referred to, and ‘Māna’ according to no lesser an authority than Sāyaṇa himself was another name of Agastya. This ‘Māna’ may be said to have given rise to two important traditions of Indian architecture—Mānavid, the Sūtragrāhin and Mānācārya Agastya one of the earliest authorities of Vāstu-vidyā.[unquote] ---contd.

--conttd. “References to Tvaṣṭā, the carpenter and his craftmanship in wooden and metallic crafts (X. 48) are sufficient proof of early architecture as wooden architecture, when wood was the chief material for constructing a building. The words like ‘Harmyas’ occurring frequently in the Ṛgveda (V. 32. 5, VII. 55. 6, 56. 16, 76. 2, IX. 71. 4, 78. 3) give you a clue for special kinds of buildings. The references to Puras and their fortification are already taken into consideration. The references to gorgeous and pillared halls and mansions (whether in the context of the gods and Ṛṣis or the Asuras) have also been hinted at. References to pillars and their shapes (1.59.1,111.31.12, IV. 5. 1) abound through: Sthūṇa, Stambha, Skambha or Viṣkambha are several names of pillars referring to both free standing pillars and supports. We are familiar with the Yūpa, the sacrificial post.”
