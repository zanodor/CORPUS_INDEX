# Index for Srini Kalyanaraman – Saptasindhavah, defines Veda Turvaśa Yadu region.pdf

Saptasindhavah, defines Veda Turvaśa Yadu region, seven rivers of Veda are: Gomal + Pancanad -
Śutudri,Vipaś,असिक्नी ,सितस्ता , परुष्णि -- + Sarasvati
Edward Thomas tries to define the Saptasaindhavah in a convoluted manner, governed by the linguistic doctrine that governs his views: Aryan Invasion Theory..
Let us look at the reality presented by the texts. I submit that Saptasaindhavah regionmentioned in Rgveda is coterminus with the Sarasvati-Sindhu Civilization. The key is provided by the placename: hariyupiya. (RV 6.27.5,6)
Griffith translation: RV 6.27.5,6: 5 In aid of Abhyavartin Cayamana, Indra destroyed the seed of Varasikha. At Hariyupiya he smote the vanguard of the Vrcivans, and the rear fled frighted. 6 Three thousand, mailed, in quest of fame, together, on the Yavyavati, O muchsought- Indra, Vrcivans' sons, falling before the arrow, like bursting vessels went to their destruction.
The Vrcivan are clearly identified in Vedic Index (as maybe, allies of Turvaśa)

आ यत िाकं यशिो िािशानााः िरस्वती िप्तथी सिुन्धमाता | यााः िुष्वयन्त िुदुघााः िुधारा असि ििेन पयिा पीप्यानााः || (RV 7.36.6) Sarasvati is the seventh river whose mother is Sindhu, according to RV 7.36.6
RV 2.12 3 Who slew the Dragon, freed the Seven Rivers, and drove the kine forth from the cave of Vala, Begat the fire between two stones, the spoiler in warriors' battle, He, O men, is Indra. 12 Who with seven guiding reins, the Bull, the Mighty, set free the Seven great Floods to flow at pleasure; Who, thunderarmed-, rent Rauhina in pieces when scaling heaven, He, O ye men, is Indra. RV 4.28 1. ALLIED with thee, in this thy friendship, Soma, Indra for man made waters flow together, Slew Ahi, and sent forth the Seven Rivers, and opened as it were obstructed fountains.
What does RV 8.24.27 say?
Griffith translation:RV 8.24.27 Who will set free from ruinous woe, or Arya on the Seven Streams: O valiant Hero, bend the Dasas' weapon down.
Wilson translation: RV 8.24.27: (He it is) who rescues men from the wickedness of evil beings, who enriches (the dwellers) on the seven rivers; now hurl, you who abound in wealth, your weapon at the Da_sa. [Dwellers on the seven rivers: sapta sindhus.u, i.e. the dwellers on the banks of the seven rivers; or, on the shores of the seven seas].
Source: Vdic Index In RV 8.24.23 Vis'vamanas declared himself to be the son of Vyas'va: 8.024.23 Praise verily at present, son of Vyas'va, praise (Indra), who is the tenth of the pervading (vital principles), the adorable, the all-wise to be honoured repeatedly (by sacred rites). [Vital principles: das'aman = the tenth; there are nine vital airs in the human body, Indra is the tenth; nava vai purus.e pra_n.a_

manus.yes.u vartama_na_ indras tes.a_m das'adha; cf. Taittiri_ya Bra_hman.a 1.3.7.4; Taittiri_ya Sam.hita_ 1.7.9].
In RV 8.24.25, he is referring to the Battle of 20 kings, the first battle of Veda samajam fought and won by Divodasa: 8.024.25 Indra, of goodly aspect, bring to the offerer (of the oblation) that (protection) wherewith to defend him you have twice slain (the goe) for Kutsa; show the same (care of us). [Bring to us that protection wherewith (you protect your) offerer; send to us (that protection wherewith) you have twice slain (the foe) for Kutsa].
These two indicators give us the chronological of his declaration of seven rivers. It appears that he was making this declaration from the banks of River Sarasvati.
There is an intriguing reference to Gomati river in RV 8.24.30: 8.024.30 If any ask of you, (Us.as), when anywhere present, where the sacrificer (Varu dwells), (reply) the powerful (prince), the refuge of all, abides on (the banks of) the Gomati_ river. [Ask of you: kuhaya_kr.te = oh, you who are honoured by those who ask where Varu wells, sa varuh kutra tis.t.hattyetad icchaya_bhilaks.an.a pravr.ttair jijn~a_subhih puraskr.te (us.as); valah = varah, svabalena ava_rakah s'atru_n.a_m, overwhelmer of enemies].
This indicates that he is adding Gomati as the seventh river. Thus, the count is: five rivers of the Panjab, PLUS the Rivers Sarasvati and Gomati (Gomal).
Vedic index is emphatic that the River Gomati is the Gomal, a western tributary of the Sindhu river:
Sanskrit: गोमती) is a 400 km long ,ګومل سیند،ګومل دریاب : Pashto ,دریائے گومل : Gomal River (Urdu river in Afghanistan and Pakistan...Gomal River's headwaters are located south-east of Ghazni. The springs which form the headwaters of the Gomal's main branch emerge above the fort at Babakarkol in Katawaz, a district inhabited by Ghilji Pashtuns from the Kharoti and Sulaimankhel clans, in Paktika Province. The Gomal's other branch, the "Second Gomal", joins the main channel about 14 miles below its source. The Gomal flows southeast through eastern Ghilji country before entering Pakistan.Within Pakistan, the Gomal River forms the boundary between Balochistan and the South Waziristan Agency (formerly part of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, but now part of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa). After approximately 110 miles from its source, it merges with the Zhob River, its major tributary, near Khajuri Kach.It is about 100 miles from the Zhob River to the Indus River. From South Waziristan, the river enters the Gomal Valley in the district of Tank, Pakistan at a place known as Girdavi, Murtuza which is inhabited by the Miani tribe. It is mainly here that the water of Gomal is used to cultivate the lands in Gomal Valley through Zam System (Rod Kohi). The river passes then through the Damaan plain in Kulachi Tehsil and later on through Dera Ismail Khan Tehsil, It then joins the Indus River 20 miles south of Dera Ismail Khan. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomal_River

The key in a delineation of the Pancanada.Vedic Index statesthat this reference to five streams is dated to Mahabharata.
पाञ्चनद pāñcanada a. (-दी f.) Prevalent in the पञ्चनद or Punjab. -दः A prince of the Punjab. 2 (pl.) Its inhabitants. Pancanada is clearly a reference to the region of Panjab: panjāb पंजाब् m. N. of the Land of the Five Rivers, the Panjāb (Rām. 1198)(Kashmiri)
The names of the five tributaries of Sindhu in Rgveda are:
Śutudri, Vipaś, असिक्नी (RV 8.20.25, 10.75.5), वितस्ता (RV 10.75.5), परुष्णि (also called Ravi
or इरािती) (RV 7.18.8,9 RV 10.75.5)

Ravi river (Harappa) Veda calls the place as Hariyupiya:
What is this Panjab? or Five, flows of water?
The word "Punjab" is a combination of the Persian words 'panj' ( پنج ) Five, and 'āb' ( آب ) Water, giving the literal meaning of the Land of the Five Rivers. The five rivers, after which Punjab is named are the Jhelum; the Chenab; the Ravi; the Beas and the Sutlej - all of them are the tributaries of the Indus river. https://www.jatland.com/home/Punjab

Panjnad River (Hindi: पञ्ज्नद , Urdu/Punjabi Shahmukhi: پنجند , Punjabi Gurmukhi ਪੰਜਨਦ) (panj = five, nadi = river) is a river at the extreme end of Bahawalpur district in Punjab, Pakistan.
Location: Panjnad River is formed by successive confluence of the five rivers of Punjab, namely Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, Beas and Sutlej. Jhelum and Ravi join Chenab, Beas joins Sutlej, and then Sutlej and Chenab join to form Panjnad 10 miles north of Uch Sharif in Bahawalpur district.
