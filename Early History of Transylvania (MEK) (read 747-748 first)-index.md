About the Library of Hungarology:
Hungarology, or Hungarian studies, covers interdisciplinary research dealing with the Hungarian people, its ethnic group, its history, language, culture, national civilisation in the past and present, as well as its place and role in the universal civilisation of mankind.
As such, in addition to the disciplines listed, it focuses attention on history, language and literature, fiction, cultural history, ethnological research and geography.
At the initiative of Professor Tibor Klaniczay an academic society was set up for those involved in Hungarian studies in 1997. The International Society of Hungarian Philology (ISHP) has its seat in Budapest, its members are dealing with Hungarian studies in 35 countries - their number exceeds one thousand.
It has been the objective of this society to assist the work of those involved in



Digital Library of Hungarian Studies
https://mek.oszk.hu/hungalap/indexeng.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:06:16]
Hungarian studies all over the world, and to present the findings of related research to those interested, as well as to allow them access to the achievements of this complex discipline.
Nowadays it is of special importance to provide information on this field before Hungary's accession to the European Union. The interest in our culture may grow, the events of our history and the changes in our civilisation are likely to raise extensive interest both in and beyond Europe. Hungary is expected to make the results of Hungarology research accessible to the students and faculty at the relevant departments of universities and colleges, to the visitors of Hungarian cultural institutes abroad (called Collegium Hungaricum), and to the users of library collections.
We wish to make the research results available to the widest possible audience, and to promote the exchange of information between the groups of specialists in Hungary and abroad.
The first serious initiative in this area was the publishing of a book list entitled "A core library of Hungarian studies" in 1986, co-published by the ISHP and the Society for the Dissemination of Scientific Knowledge (TIT). This bibliography represented an introduction to the literature of Hungarology.
The next publication to follow was the "List of reference works" compiled by the National Széchényi Library Centre for Library Science and Methodology (CLSM) in 1993. It has focused on handbooks and gave an overview of the materials in a variety of disciplines. This list was therefore shorter and more modest than its predecessor. Another addition is now in preparation, concentrating again on handbooks, being compiled by the Hungarian Library Institute, the successor of CLSM. These bibliographies have merely aimed at identifying the works in demand and at assisting their purchase.
The application of information technology today has, however, enabled remote access to the original works.
The Hungarian Electronic Library operating within the National Széchényi Library makes now, as a first step, the materials of the 1986 and 1993 book lists, plus the additions from 2003 available on the Internet. About 3,800 volumes (more than 2 million pages) have been selected from these lists - with the help of experts and the members of the HUNGALAP forum - to be digitised.

HISTORY OF TRANSYLVANIA
Volume I. From the Beginnings to 1606 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
Preface to the Series and Acknowledgments
The present volume is a component of a series that is intended to present a comprehensive survey of the many aspects of East Central European society.
The books in this series deal with peoples whose homelands lie between the Germans to the west, the Russians, Ukrainians and Belorussians to the east and north, and the Mediterranean and Adriatic seas to the south. They constitute a particular civilization, one that is at once an integral part of Europe, yet substantially different from the West. The area is characterized by a rich diversity of languages, religions and governments. The present threevolumes opus — the most ambitious undertaking of this series ever done — deals with Transylvania, a prototypical East-Central European region. The study of this complex area demands a multidisciplinary approach, and, accordingly, our contributors to the series represent several academic disciplines. They have been drawn from universities and other scholarly institutions in the United States and Western Europe, as well as East and Central Europe. The authors of the present volume are prominent experts of their theme, researchers of the Institute of History of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, more than one presents in this volume his life-long labor, some of them already passed away.
The editors are responsible for ensuring the comprehensiveness, cohesion, internal balance, and scholarly quality of the series they have launched. We cheerfully accept this responsibility and intend this work to be neither justification nor condemnation of the policies, attitudes, and activities of any person involved. At the same time, because the contributors represent so many different disciplines, interpretations, and schools of thought, our policy in this, as in the past and future volumes, is to present their contributions without major modifications.
Ms. Andrea T. Kulcsár gave extensive help in arranging, refining, type-setting, making up, and indexing of the text. The Biographies was made with the help of Tamás Pálosfalvi. The Bibliography was cut down by Tamás Vitek. I wish to express our gratitude to them.

Volume I. From the Beginnings to 1606 INTRODUCTION TO THE ENGLISH EDITION
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
On the eve of the publication of the English version of this opus, I am delighted that this decade-long project has finally borne fruit. The Hungarian Research Institute of Canada was inaugurated in 1985 and is a Research Ancillary of the University of Toronto. Since its inception, the mandate of the Institute has been to support scholarship dealing with the Central European Region through research and disseminating of its results through publication.
The Institute of History of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences made a substantial contribution to Hungarian history by the publication of the three-volume History of Transylvania. Having recognized the academic value of the original Hungarian version, our continued efforts resulted in the acquisition of the copyright for the English language publication. Accordingly, on behalf of the Institute, I would like to thank the editors and the authors for their cooperation in the publication of this important work for the English-speaking academic community.
In the publication of the History of Transylvania, we have found co-publishers; the Atlantic Research and Publications, Inc. and the East European Monographs series, whose capabilities, experience and interests compliment ours and has led to a highly successful co-operation in the past, namely the publication of István Bibó's selected works.
This introduction would be incomplete without acknowledging the support of many individuals and organizations that helped us realize our goal. In chronological order, we must thank the Canadai Magyarságért Foundation, its President Éva Sándor, Zsolt Balogh and Susan S. Szécsi, for their continuous support. We would also like to thank The Széchenyi Society of Canada and The Rákóczi Foundation of Canada, its founding chairman, Nicholas Korponay, who was a major supporter until his untimely death and his successor, Mr. Joseph Hamvas. I am truly grateful for the support of my esteemed colleagues who assisted this project during its long gestation period through their effort and financial aid: Levente L. Diosady, Tibor Fekete and Bennett Kovrig for his extraordinary effort in translating and editing this work. I would also like to specifically thank Béla W. Fejér and Géza Jeszenszky for their invaluable contributions. I would like to thank Béla K. Király for his enthusiasm and determination that were necessary for ensuring the project's completion. We are grateful to those supporters of the Institute, too numerous to mention, thus I must simply say thank you to all who have demonstrated their faith in the project through their financial and moral assistance.

{1-1.} INTRODUCTION TO THE ENGLISH EDITION
Contents
Objectives of the work Repercussions of the work
Transylvania, which today forms part of Romania, is a Central European region located in the eastern half of the Carpathian Basin. Bounded in the east and south by the Carpathian mountain range, historic Transylvania extended in the west to the Szigethegység (Apuseni Mountains); however, since 1919, Transylvania also encompasses, in the north, the Partium (Regni Hungariae Partes), lands that were once part of Hungary proper, and, in the west, a slice of the Banat. The Latin name Transylvania is rendered in Hungarian as Erdély; in Romanian as Ardeal (a derivation of Erdély) or, in more recent times, as Transilvania; and in German as Siebenbürgen.
The region that is known today as Transylvania encompasses 102,000 square kilometres, and borders on Hungary, Ukraine, and Yugoslavia as well as the Romanian provinces of Wallachia and Moldavia. Its principal waterways are the Szamos, Maros, Nagy- and Kis-Kőrös, Küküllő, Zsil, and Olt rivers. Transylvania enjoys a continental climate and, as its name implies, is richly endowed with forests; the varied topography allows for sheep grazing as well as for viticulture and the cultivation of wheat, corn, and potatoes. The mining of gold and salt dates back to ancient times; there are also deposits of iron, hard coal, non-ferrous metals, and natural gas. A manufacturing industry developed in the mid-19th and 20th centuries.
Since the Middle Ages, the region has been inhabited by three main ethnic groups, the Hungarians (Magyars and Székelys), Romanians, and Germans (known indiscriminately as Saxons, or, in the Banat, as Swabians). According to the 1992 census, Transylvania has 7.7 million inhabitants, including 5.7 million ethnic {1-2.} Romanians and 1.7 million Hungarians, who account respectively for 70 and 20 percent of the region's population. The Romanians speak a Neo-Latin tongue; they trace their ancestry to the indigenous Dacians and their Roman conquerors (2nd and 3rd centuries A.D.), although by other accounts their ancestors migrated from the Balkans. The Hungarians, whose language belongs to the Finno-Ugrian group, moved westward from the region of the Urals and settled in the lands now encompassed by Hungary and Transylvania in the last decade of the 9th century. Some of the Hungarians in Transylvania are known as Székely (from "szék," meaning seat, the distinctive name given to their administrative districts); the historic designation of the east-central region in which they are concentrated is Székelyföld, or Land of the Székelys. In the Middle Ages, Hungary's kings promoted the immigration of Saxons, most of whom settled in the so-called Királyföld (Fundus Regius, or Königsboden). The Swabians of the Banat settled much later, in the 18th century. At the beginning of this century, there were some 700,000 Germans in the region, but emigration — mainly to Germany — reduced their number to 100,000 in 1992, and the decline continues.
The population also came to include Gypsies (Roma) as well as smaller complements of Armenians, Jews, and other ethnic groups. The Gypsies, whose adopted tongue is variously Hungarian and Romanian, number around 200,000, or 3 percent of the region's population. The presence of Jews in Transylvania can be traced back to the Middle Ages, and by the early years of this century their number may have reached 300,000. The majority fell victim to the nazis, and most of the survivors eventually emigrated to Israel; barely 2000 Jews remain in Transylvania. The first Armenians were invited to settle by Transylvania's princes in the 17th century. Most of them assimilated to the Hungarians, and in the latest census no more than 724 people claimed to be Armenian.
{1-3.} This ethnic diversity coincided to some extent with religious denomination. Among ethnic Romanians, the majority belong to the Greek Orthodox Church, but in the early 18th century some of them adhered to the Greek Catholic (Uniate) Church, which acknowledges the authority of the Pope. Since the Reformation, the Hungarians



INTRODUCTION TO THE ENGLISH EDITION

have belonged variously to the Roman Catholic, Reformed (Calvinist), and Unitarian Churhes, the Saxons to the Lutheran Church, and the Swabians to the Roman Catholic Church. In 1568, Transylvania's Diet granted full recognition to the Catholic and Protestant faiths, and 'tolerated' status to the Greek Orthodox religion. This display of religious tolerance was unique in Central Europe and nurtured a degree of cultural pluralism.
In the Middle Ages, Transylvania's political system was based on the privileged status — enacted in 1437 — of the "three united nations" (unio trium nationum). This institution was designed by the Hungarian nobility, the militarized Székelys, and the privileged Saxons to exclude serfs and villeins of various ethnic backgrounds and to serve the needs of defence against the Ottoman Turks; in the event, it endured until the emancipation of villeins in 1848. The feudal relationship between landowners and villeins was marked by tensions that occasionally led to violent confrontation, notably in 1437, in 1514, and at the end of the 18th century. The privileged castes lived off the income of their estates; the Hungarian villeins engaged in agriculture and the exploitation of forests; the Saxons farmed and, in their towns, fostered crafts and commerce; while the Romanian villeins worked on the land or tended sheep. After some tentative beginnings, the mining and manufacturing industries entered a phase of dynamic development in the second half of the 19th century.
By the late 17th century, ethnic Romanians had come to form the majority of Transylvania's population, and their Greek Catholic intelligentsia began to propagate the notion that the Romanians originated in Dacia (the Roman province that encompassed the {1-4.} future Transylvania) and that therefore their settlement antedated that of the other ethnic groups. This thesis informed the 1791 petition, Supplex libellus Valachorum, in which the two Romanian Churches requested that the Romanians' privileged strata be recognized by Transylvania's Diet as a fourth feudal "nation". The Diet rejected the petition, and Saxon as well as Hungarian historians dismissed the theory of Daco-Roman continuity. They maintained that the Romanian people originated south of the Danube and spread only later to the region that became the Romanian principalities and to Transylvania; the first documentary reference to their presence in Transylvania dates from the early 13th century.
With the emergence of nationalism in the early 19th century, the debate acquired a political-ideological character. In 1848–49, during the Hungarian War of Independence, the competing forces of Romanian and Hungarian nationalism provoked a minor civil war. While Hungarian liberals called for the reunification of Transylvania with Hungary, Romanian leaders demanded recognition of their community's collective, political and cultural rights, and the preservation of an independent Principality of Transylvania. The pattern was set: Romanian nationalism found strength in the majority status of ethnic Romanians and the theory of Daco-Roman continuity, and confronted the Hungarian nationalists' insistence on reunification and the preservation of historic Hungary.
In the peace settlement after World War I, historic Transylvania and some additional Hungarian territory were annexed to Romania. Northern Transylvania, where Hungarians were in the majority, was reannexed to Hungary in 1940, then returned to Romania in the armistice and in the Paris Peace Treaty of 1947. The treaty offered no guarantees of minority rights, but Hungary's communist government considered that each state was responsible for the welfare of its own ethnic minorities. Hungarian historians were left to investigate past evidence of accommodation between the two nations.
{1-5.} In Romania, a certain official tolerance with regard ethnic minorities soon gave way to aggressive nationalism, and historians followed suit. Romanian historiography affirmed the theory of Daco-Roman continuity, claiming that Romanians had been present in Transylvania for several centuries before the arrival of the Hungarians. It was argued that in the Middle Ages, Transylvania had been an autonomous voivodeship within Hungary; that in the Ottoman period, Transylvania's status was similar to that of Moldavia and Wallachia; and that ethnic Romanians had always formed the majority of the region's population. Romanian historians held that the Romanian uprising in 1848–49 had been directed against the Hungarian revolution and War of Independence and tended to ignore the fact that the uprising enjoyed the political and military support of the Habsburg government. With regard to the 1867–1918 period, the historians focused on Budapest's policies of assimilation, neglecting to note the economic progress fostered by Hungarian liberalism among Transylvania's Romanians. In postwar Romanian historiography, the tendency was to attribute the terms of annexation in the Treaty of Trianon (1920) to the will of Transylvanian Romanians; that the Entente powers had promised the region to Romania as early as 1916, and that there was no attempt in 1918–19 to canvass the views of Transylvania's Hungarian population, were facts seldom evoked. Romanian historians highlighted the repressive measures taken by the Hungarian authorities against ethnic

Romanians in Northern Transylvania between 1940 and 1944, but ignored the anti-Hungarian rampages of the socalled Maniu Guards in 1944–45. They held the Hungarian authorities to have been fully responsible for the deportation of Jews from Northern Transylvania, but passed over in silence Romanian involvement in the persecution of Jews in Moldavia and Transnistria.
Official policy turned virulently nationalistic in the Ceauşescu era. The above-noted theories and biases became firmly entrenched, and political as well as administrative measures were {1-6.} applied to repress the Hungarian minority in Transylvania. Hungary's persevered in its policy of accommodation, but hopes dimmed regarding its effectiveness. The growing stream of biased interpretations from Romanian historians impelled scholars in Hungary to emerge from their officially-sanctioned silence. In the late 1970s, the Historical Institute of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences rose to the challenge. The result was the three-volume Erdély története (History of Transylvania), published in 1986.

{1-137.} Seven centuries elapsed between the fall of Roman Dacia and the foundation by Magyar gyula (warlords) of their first political centre, the 'White' fortress, built upon the ruins of an ancient Roman town whose name is no longer known. A few written sources remain from the beginning of this long period; beyond these, one must rely almost exclusively on sparse archaeological evidence.
It is no easy task to reconstruct history on the basis of such limited evidence. One must survey nearly two centuries' worth of archaeological research and analysis; to the extent possible, examine at first hand the archaeological collections in the museums of Transylvania, Budapest, and Bucharest, and even the original sites of the finds. The sorting out of all this data might seem a routine task, for archaeologists have long ago succeeded in linking the finds to the more important peoples and periods. Thus finds dating from the Hungarian Settlement were first identified in 1834, from the Merovingian Germans in 1848, from the Avars in 1872, from the Gepids of the migration period in 1880, from the Transylvanian Slavs in 1881, and, from the Hungarian-Slavic common people of the 10th and 11th centuries, in 1913 (in Transylvania). Since then, thanks to the growing number of finds and improvements in the methods of excavation and analysis, the classification and identification of finds has been steadily refined.
The archaeological finds and data need to be reconciled with written sources (which in turn must be carefully appraised), with linguistic evidence (notably the names of places and people), and with findings in such fields as anthropology, biology, and archaeozoology. This complex process leads us to certain conclusions regarding human settlements, and more generally about political, economic, and social history. However, archaeological finds (settlements, burial grounds, hoards of coin and jewellery) remain the fundamental and essential source. In the account that follows, the historical narrative may seem weighed down by the evidence from {1-138.} some one thousand archaeological sites; non-experts may choose to skip these passages, but it is not possible to write a history of the early Middle Ages without a thorough assessment of archaeological sites and finds.

Álmos (819?-895?)
Prince of the Hungarians, father of Árpád, the leader of the Hungarian Conquest. Presumably the victim of a ritual murder in the wake of the disastrous attack of the Pechenegs against the Hungarians.
Álmos (1075?-1127)

King of Hungary (1046-1060), the second son of blinded Vazul. Called back from exile by the leading Hungarians in {1-808.} 1046. Followed the work of St. Stephen and successfully defended Hungary against the Holy Roman Empire. Defeated by his own brother, Béla in 1060.
Andrew II (1177?-1235)
King of Hungary (1205-1235), second son of Béla III. Began the generous distribution of the royal demesne. His baronial opposition, supported by the movement of the nascent nobility, forced him to issue the famous Golden Bull. Granted privileges to the Saxons of Transylvania (Andreanum).

BIOGRAPHIES
https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/160.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:08:23]
Anonymus
Notary in the court of presumably Béla III (1172-1196), author of the Latin Gesta Hungarorum ("The deeds of the Hungarians"). Narrates the history of the Hungarians before and after the Conquest, justifying the latter by linking the Hungarians with the Huns. Although containing a great number of purely ficitve elements, the Gesta is important not only historically but also linguistically.
Árpád (850/855-907?)
Prince of the Hungarians, son of Álmos, ancestor of the Árpád dynasty. Leader of the Hungarians at the time of the Conquest.
Balassa, Menyhárt (1510?-1568)
Hungarian aristocrat, count (ispán) of Hont (1535-42) and Bars (1542-61) counties. He was the follower of King John, Ferdinand I, John Sigismund and Isabella alternately. In 1552 he was appointed as captain-in-chief of the army of Ferdinand I. He fought valiantly against the Transylvanians and the {1-809.} Ottomans. He protected the Protestant Church and the schools but changed his allegiance frequently.
Balassi, Bálint (1554-1594)
The most renowned Hungarian poet of his time, remaining unrivalled until the end of the 18th century. He came from one of the richest Protestant families of the country. He lived an adventurous life, fighting constantly against the Ottomans and his own relatives, who sought to deprive him of his inheritance. He died of wounds received during the siege of Esztergom.
Báthori, Sigismund (1572-1613)
Prince of Transylvania (1588-99, 1600-02). Upon the advice of his foreign counsellor, Alfonso Carillo, he gave up the traditional Transylvanian policy of playing off the two empires against each other and adopted an anti-Ottoman position. He conquered Wallachia for his ally Michael the Brave. He supporte the Counter-Reformation, thereby offending the Protestant nobility. He offered his throne to Emperor Rudolf II in return for the Silesian duchy of Oppeln. With the support of Rudolf II Michael the Brave defeated Báthori's son, Andrew, and declared himself prince of Transylvania. Although Báthori tried to recover his throne but was expelled by Michael and died in obscurity.
Báthori, Stephen (1533-1586)
Prince of Transylvania (1571-76), king of Poland (1575-86). Successfully opposed the Habsburg candidate for the Polish throne and attempted to form a powefulstate from Poland, Muscov, and Transylvania. He was elected prince of Transylvania after the death of John Sigismund. Before going to Poland he secured the Transylvanian throne for his brother, Christopher. He was planning to launch a crusade against the Ottoman Empire at the time of his death in 1586.
{1-810.} Béla III (1148-1196)
King of Hungary. Lived in Constantinople as the designated heir to the Byzantine emperor until 1170. In 1172 he returned to Hungary and became one of the strongest rulers of his dynasty. Developed the use of written administration. Consolidated the kingdom internally and established wide-ranging dynastic relationships.

Béla IV (1206-1270)
King of Hungary (1235-70), son of Andrew II. Rebuilt and reorganised the kingdom after the disastrous attack of the Mongolians (1241). Supported the construction of stone castles and favoured the urban development with privileges. Two of his daughters were canonised.
Bethlen, Gabriel (1580-1629)
Calvinist prince of Transylvania (1613-29). He began his careerin the court of Prince Sigismund Báthori, then supported Stephen Bocskai. Later he took refuge with the Ottomans who proclaimed him as prince of Transylvania. He reorganised the financial and military administration of the principality and joined the Thirty Years' War. His aim was to unite Transylvania, Hungary and parts of Austria under his rule. He was elected king of Hungary but refused to be crowned and contented himself with seven north-eastern counties of royal Hungary. He made great efforts to promote the arts and sciences in his principality.
Bocskai, Stephen (1557-1606)
Prince of Transylvania (1605-06). He was brought up in the court of the Báthoris and later advised Sigismund Báthori to enter an alliance with Emperor Rudolf. Being a Protestant, he later helped the Ottomans to drive out the Habsburg troops from Transylvania. In 1605 he was elected as prince of Transylvania and recognised as such by the Ottomans. In the same year he was also elected prince of Hungary. Therefore {1-811.} his aim was to preserve the independence of Transylvania. The peace of Vienna (1606) secured freedom for the Protestants, while the treaty of Zsitvatorok, mediated by Bocskai, put an end to the Habsburg-Ottoman wars.
Charles Robert of Anjou (1288-1342)
King of Hungary (1301-1342), founder of the dynasty of the Hungarian Angevins. Defeated the oligarchs in a series of wars from 1311 to 1323 with the support of the Hungarian church. Created a new aristocracy from his most faithful followers. Reorganised the system of financial administration and issued high-quality golden coins (florins).
Constantine VII (Porphyrogenetos) (905-959)
Byzantine Emperor (913-959), writer. His most important work, De administrando imperio [On the governance of the Empire] is an invaluable yet hotly discussed source of information on the early history of the Hungarians.
Decebalus (?-106)
King of the Dacians. United the various Dacian tribes and fought successfully against the expanding Romans. He was defeated by Emperor Traianus and Dacia became a Roman province in 107.
Ferdinand I of Habsburg (1503-1564)
King of Hungary and Bohemia (1526-64), King of Romans (1531-64), Holy Roman Emperor (1556-64). He was elected king of Hungary after the death of Louis II at Mohács. He fought a long war with John I for the rule over Hungary, which ended with the treaty of Várad (1538). He made great efforts to centralise the Habsburg provinces. He laid the foundations of Habsburg administration in Hungary.
Fráter, György (Martinuzzi, originally Utiešenović) (1482-1551)
Transylvanian statesman, cardinal. He sought to unite royal Hungary and Transylvania. Yet the failure of the Habsburg troops compelled him to comply with Ottoman demands. His {1-812.} aim was to maintain Transylvania as

an independent state under Ottoman suzerainty. In 1549 he offered once again Transylvania to Ferdinand I, but the Habsburg troops were unable to give effective support. The cardinal's gestures towards the Ottomans made him suspect and Ferdinand had him murdered in 1551.
Hunyadi, János (1407?-1456)
Hungarian aristocrat, voivode of Transylvania (1441-46), governor of Hungary (1446-52), captain-in-chief (145356). His family came to Hungary from the Romanian principality of Wallachia. Young Hunyadi served a number of lords from Filippo Scolari to Francesco Sforza. From 1441 he coordinated the defense against the Ottomans. He led a number of large-scale campaigns against the Ottoman Empire (1443-44, 1444, 1448) with the aim of breaking its power in Europe, but suffered serious defeats. His greatest victory was the relief of Belgrade in 1456.
Isabella (1519-1559)
Queen of Hungary, wife of John Szapolyai. After the death of King John in 1540 governor of Hungary with György Fráter and other barons. After the fall of Buda (1541) she moved to Transylvania and tried to secure her rule with Ottoman help. In 1551 she was forced by György Fráter to resign in favour of Ferdinand I and to leave Transylvania. In 1556 she was called back from Poland and ruled the principality until her death in 1559.
John I (Szapolyai) (1487-1540)
King of Hungary (1526-40). As voivode of Transylvania he suppressed the peasant revolt of 1514. He was elected as king of Hungary in 1526. He was expelled from Hungary by Ferdinand but swiftly returned with Ottoman help. In 1538 he recognised Ferdinand I as his heir, but changed his plans shortly before his death when a son was born to him, the future John Sigismund.
{1-813.} John Sigismund (John II) (1540-1571)
Elected king of Hungary (1540), prince of Transylvania (1556-71). Son of John I, he was under the wardship of his mother, Isabella. His personal rule in Transylvania began after the death of his mother in 1559. He suppressed the revolt with the Székelys and was acknowledged by the Sultan in 1566. In the treaty of Speyer he resigned his title of elected king of Hungary and began to call himself prince of Transylvania. Secured the freedom of the four accepted confessions. Died childless in 1571.
Ladislas I (Saint) (1040?-1095)
King of Hungary (1077-95), son of Béla I. Consolidated the work of Saint Stephen with his laws whose basic aim was the protection of private property. In 1091 he occupied Croatia and founded the bishopric of Zagreb. He was canonised in 1192 and later came to embody the ideal Hungarian knightly king.
Ladislas IV (the Cumanian) (1262-1290)
King of Hungary (1272-90). He was unable to halt the expansion of the baronial oligarchs to the detriment of royal power. He supported Rudolf of Habsburg against Otakar of Bohemia in the battle of Dürnkrut in 1278. His predilection for the Cumanians (his mother was a Cumanian) led to a number of conflicts with the church. Yet he was finally murdered by the Cumanians themselves.
Louis I of Anjou (the Great) (1326-1382)
King of Hungary (1342-82) and of Poland (1370-82), son of Charles Robert (Charles I). Led a number of expensive campaigns to Italy with the aim of securing the throne of Naples. Waged constant wars against Venice

and the neighbours of Hungary on the Balkans. He was the first king of Hungary to confirm the Golden Bull (1351). The first Ottoman incursion into Hungary took place under his rule (1375).
{1-814.} Louis II (1506-1526)
King of Hungary and Bohemia (1516-26). He was crowned king of both kingdoms in the life of his father, Wladislas II. He was declared of age in 1521. Marched against the Ottomans in 1526 and died in the battle of Mohács at the age of 20.
Matthias I (Hunyadi) (1443-1490)
Son of János Hunyadi, king of Hungary (1458-90). Reorganised the financial and military administration of Hungary. Successfully defended the country against the Ottomans and waged expensive wars against Bohemia and Austria. He was the first monarch beyond the Alps to implant the new ideas of Italian humanism in his kingdom. He tried in vain to secure the succession of his illegitimate son, János Corvin. His rule marked the apogee of medieval Hungary.
Maximilian I (1527-1576)
King of Bohemia (1562), and of Hungary (1563), Holy Roman Emperor (1564). Supported religious toleration in the Empire and the hereditary provinces. After the great Ottoman campaign in 1566 he concluded the peace of Adrianopolis and engaged himself to pay an annual tribute to the Sultan. Tried to secure the Polish throne against Stephen Báthori but died without achieving his aim.
Michael the Brave (Mihai Viteazul) (1558-1601)
Romanian prince of Wallachia. He submitted himself to Sigismund Báthori to secure his help against the Ottomans, against whom he fought successfully. In 1599 he defeated Andrew Báthori and proclaimed himself prince of Transylvania. He also conquered Moldavia, thereby temporarily uniting the two Romanian principalities and Transylvania. He was murdered in 1601 upon the order of the Habsburg general Giorgio Basta.
Sigismund of Luxemburg (1368-1437)
King of Hungary (1387-) and of Bohemia (1419-), Holy Roman Emperor (1433-). Married Mary, daughter of Louis I of {1-815.} Anjou. He was defeated by the Ottomans in the battle of Nicopolis in 1396 but consequently established an effective defensive system in the South. Played an active role in the international diplomacy and helped to settle the Great Schism. His long rule was a period of internal stability and economic prosperity in Hungary.
Stephan I (Saint) (c. 970-1038)
First king of Hungary (1000-1038), founder of the Christian Hungarian monarchy. Son of prince Géza, he was born a pagan and then baptised and brought up as a Christian. In 1000/01 he was crowned king of Hungary. Laid the foundation of the kingdom's secular and ecclesiastical organisation. He was canonised in 1038.
Werbőczy, István (1458-1542)
Hungarian statesman and jurist. He was appointed as palatine for a short period under Louis II. After the battle of Mohács he supported John I and played an unglorious role in the occupation of Buda by the Ottomans in 1541. He is most famous for his codification of Hungarian customary role under Wladislas II. His great work called Tripartitum remained the basic legal text for 400 years.

Apáczai Csere, János (1625–59)

In order to create and promote a high-level national culture he taught at first at Gyulafehérvár (today's Alba Iulia), then at Kolozsvár (Cluj). Orthodox Calvinism made, however, his efforts fruitless.
Apafi, Mihály I (1632–90)
Prince of Transylvania from 1661. He gave shelter to Imre Thököly fleeing to Transylvania and continued to support him later also. His aim was to join Transylvania to the Holy League, organized to expel the Turks, as an independent state.

Apafi, Mihály II (1676–1713)
Prince of Transylvania, son of Mihály I. He was elected prince still in his father's lifetime but Emperor Leopold I did not give his sanction to it and had him taken to Vienna in 1693.
Apor, Péter, Baron (1676–1752)
Transylvanian aristocrat, historian, and poet. His principal work is the Metamorphosis Transylvaniae (1736) in which he recorded the old customs of Transylvania.

Báthori, Gábor (1589–1613)
Prince of Transylvania between 1608–13. With his policy he incurred the hatred of the Turks, the Transylvanian aristocracy, and the Saxon burghers alike.

Prince of Transylvania on three occasions (1588–97, 1598–99, 1601–02). He fought in allience with the Habsburgs in the Fifteen Years' War. His political irresolution, resignations, and comebacks caused Transylvania serious damage.

He spent the rest of his life at Rodostó (Tekirdag, Turkey).
Bethlen, Gabriel (1580–1629)
Prince of Transylvania from 1613, nominal King of Hungary in 1620–21. His economic policy brought prosperity for the {2-801.} principality.

During the Thirty Year's War he led three campaigns against the Habsburgs, annexing seven counties of Upper Hungary to Transylvania.
Bethlen, István (1580–1648)
Prince of Transylvania in 1630. Younger brother of Gábor Bethlen. He resigned in the favour of György Rákóczi I.

Prince of Transylvania in 1605–06. During the Fifteen Years' War he defeated the Turks at Gyurgyevó (Giurgiu) as supreme commander of the Transylvanian and Wallachian armies in 1595. Later he became disappointed with the policy of the Habsburgs and concluded an alliance with the Turks.

In his political testament he called attention to the importance of preserving the independence of Transylvania.
Charles III of Habsburg (1685–1740)
King of Hungary between 1711 and 1740, as Charles VI Holy Roman Emperor. Younger son of Leopold I. He was the last male member of the House of Habsburg along the male line. The lack of a male successor threatened the Habsburg Empire with disintegration. His daughter, Maria Theresa, managed to {2-802.} stabilize her positions as empress and queen with the Hungarians' armed support.
Cserei, Mihály (1667–1756)
Transylvanian historiographer. His unfinished História (History), written in Hungarian, tells Transylvanian history in the years 1661–1712.

The Harmonia Coelestis composed by him is a valuable piece of Baroque music even by European standards.
Ferdinand II of Habsburg (1578–1637)
Holy Roman Emperor and King of Hungary from 1619. He fought mercilessly against Protestantism and the separatism of the Estates. His commander, Albrecht Wallenstein, won him considerable victories in the Thirteen Years' War.

Joseph II of Habsburg (1741–1790)
Holy Roman Emperor from 1765, King of Hungary between 1780 and 1790. Son of Maria Theresa. He made great efforts to turn the heterogeneous Habsburg lands into a modern and unified empire even at the expense of violating national interests and hurting sentiments. In Hungary he was called "the hatted king" because he refused to be crowned. He ruled by decrees which he revoked on his deathbed with the exception of three.
Károlyi, Sándor, Count (1669–1743)
Hungarian aristocrat, general of the kuruc army. In 1703 he still dispersed the first kuruc peasant forces but later he joined the war of independence. Supreme commander of the kuruc army in 1710. Seeing that fighting further was useless, he concluded peace with the Habsburgs in 1711 without the assent of Rákóczi negotiating abroad.

{2-804.}

Köprülü, Ahmed (1635–1676)
Son of Grand Vizier Köprülü Mehmed, who had considerably strengthened the Ottoman Empire. Grand Vizier between 1661 and 1676. His campaign in Hungary in 1664 led to his defeat at Szentgotthárd but he still won further Hungarian territories in the subsequent Treaty of Vasvár.

Leopold II of Habsburg (1747–92)
Holy Roman Emperor and King of Hungary from 1790. As Grand Duke of Tuscany between 1765 and 1790 he brought about the model of enlightened absolutism in Italy.

Queen of Hungary from 1741, Queen of Bohemia from 1743. Daughter of Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI.

His request to be allowed to return home was declined by Maria Theresa in 1741.
Montecuccoli, Raimondo, Prince (1609–80)
Habsburg commander of Italian origin. He fought against Princes György Rákóczi I and II. In 1661 he was sent by Leopold I to Transylvania to rescue János Kemény but his mission failed. In 1664 he was commander-in-chief of the Hungarian army. He defeated Ahmed Köprülü at Szentgotthárd on August 1 but instead of launching an offensive, he concluded peace with the Turks at Vasvár.

His principal work, Isteni igazságra vezérlő kalauz (A guide to divine justice), was published in 1613. He founded a seminary in Vienna in 1623 which is still working today under the name Pazmaneum.

Rákóczi, Ferenc II (1676–1735)
Price of Transylvania, ruling prince of the allied Hungarian Estates, leader of the anti-Habsburg war of independence in the years 1703–11. Son of Ferenc Rákóczi I and Ilona Zrínyi. Torn from his mother, he was brought up to be loyal to the Habsburgs but the Habsburg despotism wanting to subdue newly recoquered Hungary by heavy taxes, forced labour and the duty of billeting soldiers turned him against the dynasty. The war of independence breaking out after wars of liberation in the past decade and a half had no hopes of winning on its own. Rákóczi's efforts to win allies proved, however, futile both in France and in Russia. The Prince, who refused to recognize the Treaty of Szatmár not containing any guarantees for the Hungarians, died in exile at Rodostó (Tekirdag, Turkey).
Rákóczi, György I (1593–1648)
Prince of Transylvania between 1630 and 1648. Son of Zsigmond Rákóczi. He entered the Thirty Years' War in order to be able to force Ferdinand III to respect the privileges of the Estates and the freedom of religion on the Hungarian territories. The Treaty of Linz (1645) containing also the right of {2-808.} Transylvania to keep the seven counties of Upper Hungary obtained by Gabriel Bethlen earlier is a result of his successful foreign policy.
Rákóczi, György II (1621–60)
Prince of Transylvania between 1648 and 1660. Son of György Rákóczi I and Zsuzsanna Lorántffy. In 1657 he attacked Poland in alliance with Sweden without Turkish assent and this irresponsible step led to a Turkish campaign against him and a civil war, ending a golden age of fifty years in Transylvania.

Rhédey, Ferenc, Count (1610–1667)

King of Hungary and Bohemia between 1576 and 1608, as Rudolf II Holy Roman Emperor from 1576 till his death. His seat was in Prague.

Habsburg commander of French origin. He defeated the Turks in a number of famous battles, such as those of Zenta (Senta) in 1697, Pétervárad in 1716, and Belgrade in 1717. The treaties of Karlóca (Sremski Karlovci) in 1699 and Pozsarevác (Požarevac) in 1718 which meant Hungary's liberation from Turkish occupation could be concluded as a result of his successful campaigns. In 1704 he defeated the joint French and Bavarian armies near Höchstädt in the War of Spanish Succession, rescueing at the same time Vienna and depriving Rákóczi from the possibility of establishing contacts with the French. He was governor of Austrian-occupied Netherlands in 171415 and between 1724 and 1736.
{2-809.}
Sobieski, Jan (1629–1696)
As John III King of Poland from 1674. He played a decisive role in the disastrous Turkish defeat under Vienna on September 12, 1683. In 1684 he was one of those who founded the Holy League against the Turks.

Szenczi Molnár, Albert (1574–1634)
Hungarian writer, Protestant theologist, translator, and linguist. In 1604 he prepared a Latin–Hungarian and Hungarian–Latin dictionary. In 1610 he was the first to make an attempt at preparing a full Hungarian grammar. He translated into Hungarian hundred and fifty psalms for the Protestant Church and published in Hungarian Calvin's principal work entitled Institutio.
Thököly, Imre, Count (1657–1705)
Prince of Upper Hungary between 1682 and 1685, Prince of Transylvania in 1690. His father took part in the Wesselényi conspiracy. Unsatisfied with the Habsburgs, he flew to Transylvania and the Partium where he became leader of outlaws. He married Ilona Zrínyi, the daughter of Péter Zrínyi and the widow of Ferenc Rákóczi I. He supported the Turks in their offensive of 1683 and fought against the Habsburgs in the campaigns for the liberation of Hungary from the Turks though most of his soldiers joined the imperial army. In 1690 he could not defend Transylvania against the Habsburgs and died in Turkish exile.

He made the first printed Georgian alphabet. From {2-810.} 1689 on he worked at Kolozsvár (Cluj) and published spelling-books, calenders, and other useful publications at private expense, in thousands of copies. He strove to simplify Hungarian orthography. His efforts were frustrated against Orthodox Calvinism in Transylvania.
Wesselényi, Ferenc, Count (1605–67)
Palatine of Hungary from 1655. As commander of the Castle of Fülek (Filakovo) he collaborated with his future wife Mária Széchy, lady of Murány (Muráň), and occupied the castle for the Habsburgs. After the Treaty of Vasvár (1664), when the Habsburgs did not seem ready to expel the Turks from Hungary, he started to organize a conspiracy that was wound up by the Habsburgs in 1670–71, following his death.
Wesselényi, Miklós, Baron (1796–1850)
Transylvanian aristocrat, liberal politician. At the time of the great flood in Pest in 1838 he rescued many victims and became "the legendary boatman".

Poet, writer, and military commander. Ban of Croatia from 1647. In his work Szigeti veszedelem (The Sziget disaster) he spoke of the Turkish siege of Szigetvár in 1566. The commander of the castle had been the poet's great-grandfather. He wished to liberate Hungary from Turkish rule by an international military effort. He led a successful anti-Turkish campaign in 1663–64 but the Habsburgs concluded peace with the Turks despite his successes and the victory at Szentgotthárd. He died in a confused hunting accident. His younger brother, Péter Zrínyi, was executed at Bécsújhely (Wiener Neustadt) in 1671 under charges of participating in an anti-Habsburg conspiracy.

{3-3.} The 1830s ushered in a new era in the history of Transylvania and its people. The pressure mounted for radical change, and new political forces emerged. The decade or so following the 'quiet years' of the 1820s has been characterized in various ways. The term 'Reform Era' evokes the goal and process of a shift from feudalism to capitalism, as well as the purposeful preparations aiming at the creation of a liberal and national state. The romantic label 'national awakening,' often found in contemporary accounts, evokes mainly the changes in world outlook and value systems; specifically, the emergence of national movements and the refinement of a national ideology born in the Enlightenment and interwoven with liberal and democratic ideals.
Change, which was both actively sought and inevitably on the march, would have an impact on the idyllic patriarchy and archaic conditions noted by foreign visitors. 'Relics of the past still survive, the landscape has preserved its original character, but it is clear that all this will soon disappear,' observed Auguste de Gerando, who had married into the Teleki family and made his home in Transylvania and Hungary; he concluded that he 'could not have chosen a more propitious time' for visiting Transylvania.[1]
What elements of crisis and progress shaped this last phase in the transition from feudalism to capitalism? What tensions tore apart the feudal social system? How did the old and the new clash and become interwoven? And how did contemporaries perform on the political stage in responding to the great historical challenges that marked this period in Europe? The present chapter seeks to find answers to these questions.

{3-219.} In spring 1848, Transylvania rejoined the mainstream of European history. No sooner had the Parisians risen up to overthrow their king and proclaim a republic than a revolutionary wave swept across much of Europe. Faith in the redeeming power of French revolutionary ideas became generally dominant. The majority of radicals looked upon the French revolution — or at least some of its aspects — as worthy of emulation; even the more moderate liberals were inspired to take an active hand in changing the course of history.
If the great changes that occurred in western Europe in the eighteenth century — the Industrial Revolution in England, and the socio-political revolution in France — can be characterized as 'dual revolutions,' the liberal revolutions of 1848 had a strong 'national' dimension. In the more peripheral regions, in Germany, Italy, and the Habsburg empire, the revolutionary movements addressed not only social and political issues raised by the transition from feudalism to capitalism but also the goal of national sovereignty. The forces unleashed by social change coalesced into movements that aimed at national unity and liberal constitutionalism in the context of a nation-state; where conditions were less favourable, the objectives were local autonomy and minority rights.
Optimism reigned regarding the feasibility of these political objectives. The security system of the Holy Alliance had grown weak, and only czarist Russia seemed prepared to sustain the traditional policy of intervention. Although England's passivity was not auspicious, the French republican leaders lent their support — at least in principle — to the emancipation of oppressed nations and peoples, a cause that had been championed for a long time by sundry poets and writers.
The fledgling nationalist movements showed some solidarity in their initial celebration of the 'Spring of Nations.' This momentarily {3-220.} overshadowed the possibility that, given the social and ethnic complexity of the regions in turmoil, nationalist efforts would fall prey to political manipulation and turn against each other. In this respect, Transylvania proved to be the most vulnerable region in central Europe. The domestic bourgeoisie was too feeble and divided to serve as a solid base for radical change. The risk was great that, if the spirit of revolution spread to the Habsburg empire and provoked counter-revolutionary measures, the social and national tensions in Transylvania would be aggravated and might even erupt in civil war.

A mintegy 3.800, többségében nagy terjedelmű kiadvány elektronikus változatának elkészítése az eddigi legnagyobb magyar szöveg-digitalizálási vállalkozás. A programot az Országos Széchényi Könyvtár koordinálja, a művek nagy részét a Magyar Elektronikus Könyvtár fogja szolgáltatni. Az Informatikai és Hírközlési Minisztérium támogatásának köszönhetően a munka 2004 januárjában megkezdődött, a honlapon folyamatosan nyomon lehet követni a digitalizálásra váró és a már elkészült elektronikus könyvek listáit. Az első ütemben főként az egyes tudományterületek alapvető kézikönyvei kerülnek fel az Internetre.

2006. február 17. - Az Internet Szolgáltatók Tanácsa (ISZT) jelentős támogatást adott tartalomfejlesztésre a MEK Egyesületnek a MEK állományának bővítésére 2005. őszén. A támogatásnak köszönhetően sikerült folytatni a Hungarológiai Alapkönyvtár listájának digitalizálását is. A támogatás felhasználásáról készült részletes beszámoló tartalmazza az Alapkönyvtárból a MEK állományába bekerült újabb művek listáját is.
2004. június 15. - Döntés született Demeter Tibor: Bibliographica Hungarica című művének digitalizálásáról. Demeter Tibor feleségével együtt évtizedeken keresztül gyűjtötte a magyar írók külföldön bármely nyelven megjelent műveinek adatait. Az 1800-tól 1945-ig terjedő alap-gyűjtése mintegy 36000-38000 adatot tartalmaz. Az összeállítás megjelentetésére nem akadt kiadó, így sokszorosítva, 1957-58-ban jelent meg a Bibliographia Hungarica, Magyar szépirodalom idegen nyelven címmel 11 kötetben. Az alapbibliográfiát rendszeresen kiegészítette, a pótlások gépiratos példányai (1978-ig bezárólag!) az OSZK-ban találhatók. Az eredetileg nemzeti nyelven megjelent művek idegen nyelvű kiadásainak regisztrálását általában szépirodali művekre szokták korlátozni. A hazai könyvészeti munkák közül e műfajban ez a legjelentősebb vállalkozás. A Bibliographia Hungarica az 1800 után kiadott szépirodalmi alkotások, regények, elbeszélések, versek stb. bármilyen nyelven megjelent fordításainak (első sorban az OSZK

támogatásával állományára támaszkodva) bibliográfiai adatait közli. Gyűjtéséből nyomtatásban csak részletek jelentek meg. A mű terjedelme kb. 13000 gépiratos oldal. Technikailag igen érdekes feladat a rendkívül sokféle nyelvet és írásjelet tartalmazó (az európai nyelveken kívül kínai, japán, héber, mongol, arab, cyrill stb.) szöveg internetes megjelenítése és kereshető, továbbfejleszthető adatbázissá alakítása.

2004. január-március. - A jogi és technikai egyeztetések után elindult a digitalizálási munka. 2004. febr. 10. Megnyílt a program új honlapja, ahol folyamatosan lehet tájékozódni a digitalizálási munkálatokról és az elkészült elektronikus kiadványokról.
A Hungarológiai Alapkönyvtár ismertetése:
A hungarológia, vagy másként magyarságtudomány, a magyar népre, etnikumára, történetére, nyelvére, kontrasztív nyelvészeti kutatásaira, kultúrájára irányuló, a nemzeti civilizáció múltbeli és jelenlegi kultúrájával, az emberiség egyetemes civilizációjában elfoglalt helyével és szerepével összefüggő interdiszciplináris kutatások összessége.
S mint ilyen, figyelmét elsősorban a felsorolt tudományterületek mellett a történettudományra, a nyelv- és irodalomtudományra, magára a szépirodalomra, a művelődéstörténetre, a néprajzkutatás eredményeire fordítja, miközben nem mellőzi a földrajztudományt sem.
A világ hungarológusainak tudományos szervezete Klaniczay Tibor kezdeményezésére születetett meg 1977-ben, a Nemzetközi Magyar Filológiai Társaság budapesti székhelyű intézmény, tagságát 35 ország hungarológusai adják,

számuk mára már meghaladta az ezer főt.
Régi célkitűzése a társaságnak a világon bárhol dolgozó hungarológus szakemberek munkáját segíteni, a téma iránt érdeklődőknek megmutatni itthon és külföldön egyaránt a hungarológiai kutatások eredményét, s hozzáférhetővé tenni mindazt, amit e komplex tudományterület eddig elért.
Különös jelentőséggel bírhat e téma megismertetése napjainkban, amikor az Európai Unió tagsága előtt áll országunk. Várhatóan megnövekszik kultúránk iránt az érdeklődés, múltunk és történetiségünk jellemző eseményei, civilizációs változásaink valószínű széles körű kíváncsiságot ébresztenek Európa kis és nagy országaiban, de Európán túl is. Egyetemek, főiskolák tanszékeinek oktatói és hallgatói szerte a világban, a magyar intézetek, Collegium Hungaricumok látogatói, a könyvtári gyűjtemények használói számára hozzáférhetővé tenni mindazt, amit a hungarológia nyújtani tud a nemzetközi tudományosságnak, alapvető hazai feladat.
Célunk tehát minél szélesebb körben hozzáférhetővé tenni a hungarológiai kutatások eredményét, elősegíteni a magyarországi és külföldi műhelyek információcseréjét.
Az első komoly kezdeményezést a Nemzetközi Magyar Filológiai Társaság és a Tudományos Ismeretterjesztő Társulat kiadásában Budapesten 1986-ban megjelent Hungarológiai Alapkönyvtár c. könyvjegyzék jelentette. Ez a bibliográfiai összeállítás - a kiadás idejének megfelelően - a lehető legszélesebb körben mutatta be a hungarológia szakirodalmát.
Ezt követte 1993-ban az Országos Széchényi Könyvtár Könyvtártudományi és Módszertani Központja által összeállított kézikönyvtári jegyzék. Ez utóbbi szigorúan csak a kézikönyvekre összpontosította figyelmét, ugyanakkor további tudományterületekre is kitekintett. Ennek következtében elődjénél szerényebb és szikárabb. Most készül egy újabb kiegészítés, ez is csupán a kézikönyvjellegű művekre koncentrál, összeállítója Könyvtártudományi és Módszertani Központ jogutódja a Könyvtári Intézet. E bibliográfiai összeállítások csupán csak azt célozták meg, hogy segítséget nyújtsanak a szükséges művek beszerzéséhez.
Az információtechnológia alkalmazása mára lehetővé teszi, hogy maguk az eredeti művek távhozzáféréssel is elérhetők legyenek.
Az Országos Széchényi Könyvtárban működő Magyar Elektronikus Könyvtár az 1986-os és 1993-as könyvjegyzék, illetve a 2003-as kiegészítés anyagát teszi elérhetővé az Interneten. Ezekből a listákból - felkért szakemberek illetve a HUNGALAP levelezőcsoportban véleményt nyilvánítók segítségével - került kiválasztásra az a kb. 3.800 kötet (több mint 2 millió oldal), melyekből digitális változat készül.

Kölyökkóstolgató ; Nem születtünk szülőnek / Varga Domokos

"Ez szöget ütött a fejébe. Ha a Sapa elment, és többet nem is jön vissza, akkor vigyázni kell, hogy én is el ne menjek. Olyan bolondul kezdett ôrizni, hogy titokban kellett mindig elindulnom a háztól, a szeme láttára nem öltözhettem át, nem vehettem kabátot, mert üvöltve csimpaszkodott belém, hogy maradjak itthon."

Jánosy István / Kabdebó Lóránt
Magyar irodalom története költő, műfordító, költészet, irodalmi élet, magyar irodalom története, életútinterjú, Jánosy István (1919-2006), Magyarország, 20. sz.
"Két nemzedék szinte egyszerre indul, mégis különböző élményekre figyel, különböző történelmi kihívásra felel, változó nyelven szólal meg. Ennek a különbözésnek egyik legjellegzetesebb példája éppen Jánosy költészete lehet: ugyanis az ő esetében találhatjuk a legtöbb kapcsolódást is, látszólag mindkétfelé."

"Megöleli ápolónőjét, meg is csókolja. Azokat, akik e napon jönnek hozzá, mind ezzel a végső nagy igazsággal köszönti és csókkal, öleléssel bocsátja el. Osculum Pacis. A béke csókja ez, melyet a táltosfiú, a szárnyas ember lelke ad az időben itthon maradóknak."

Kortárs magyar irodalom magyar irodalom, memoár, 20-21. sz.
"Ahogy öregszel, az élet sietni kezd, az idő besűrűsödik, a távolságok pedig beszűkülnek. Májusban költöztünk le Csopakra a járvány miatt, és azóta a legnagyobb távolság, amit esti sétaként még meg tudok tenni, 1100 m. A kétharmada körül leülök egy kőre, hallgatom az onnan jól látható vasút és 71-es út zaját. Olyankor béke honol a lelkemen."

ELŐSZÓ
1.
A Hungarológiai alapkönyvtár című könyvjegyzék célja az, hogy mintául szolgáljon olyan kézikönyvtárak felállításához, illetve fejlesztéséhez, melyek valamely hungarológiai célkitűzésű intézménnyel kapcsolatosak, vagy ezután létesülnek annak érdekében, hogy a magyarságtudomány iránt érdeklődő olvasók és kutatók tájékozódhassanak a hungarológiai szakirodalom ágazataiban, valamint - a tájékozódás megalapozásaként - megismerkedhessenek a Magyarország múltjára és jelenére vonatkozó alapvető kézikönyvekkel.
Ennek megfelelően bibliográfiánk a magyar nyelvtudomány, irodalomtudomány és néprajz válogatott, de a lényeges információk vonatkozásában teljességre törekvő szakirodalmát adja közre (beleértve magukat a szépirodalmi műveket is, mint az irodalomtudomány anyagát), bevezetésként pedig az általános kézikönyveket, és a hungarológiai vizsgálatok megalapozása szempontjából lényeges tudományterületek (földrajz, demográfia, statisztika, jog, szociológia, történelem, művészetek) alapvető kézikönyveit. Különös gondot fordít ezek közül a magyar történelemre, ezen belül is a művelődéstörténetre, mint ami a specifikusan hungarológiai szakterületek műveléséhez elengedhetetlenül szükséges. A bibliográfiát valamennyi érintett szakterület legfontosabb folyóiratainak jegyzéke zárja le.
A gyűjtés záró éve 1984 volt, de kiegészítettük a jegyzéket az 1985. év szempontunkból fontos kiadványaival is. A jegyzékbe felvett művek megjelenési évére - ennek megfelelően beszerezhetőségükre - egyébként nem voltunk tekintettel. Minthogy egy-egy tudományszakból valamennyi alapvető kézikönyv, ma is érvényes szintézis vagy monográfia szerepeltetése elengedhetetlennek látszott, természetszerűleg kerültek be a jegyzékbe 1945 előtt megjelent, sőt - ha nem is nagy számban - múlt századi, ma már csak nehezen beszerezhető kiadványok is. Úgy tűnik azonban, hogy reprográfiai úton ezek a kiadványok könnyen pótolhatók; emellett a legfőbb kézikönyvek egymás után jelennek meg reprint kiadásokban Magyarországon és külföldön egyaránt.
Kötetünk természetesen felöleli a tárgyához tartozó, Magyarország határain kívül megjelent - magyar és nem magyar nyelvű - alapvető irodalmat is. Figyelmet fordítottunk a Magyarországon idegen nyelven - vagy idegen nyelven is - megjelent kézikönyvekre, monográfiákra is; ezeket a művek jellegétől függően vagy külön leírtuk, vagy a magyar nyelvű kiadás mellett utaltunk rájuk. Magától értetődik, hogy a különböző nyelvi területeken létesülő könyvtárak a nem magyar nyelvű műveket olvasóik várható igényeinek megfelelően fogják kiválogatni. Épp így elképzelhető, hogy az egyes könyvtárak - figyelembe véve olvasóik érdeklődésének irányát - egyes szakterületek kötetünkben megadott anyagát csak bizonyos válogatással, vagy éppen azt kibővítve szerzik majd meg.
Gyűjtésünk során törekedtünk arra, hogy a használó követhesse a több kiadásban megjelent művek útját, de valamennyi kiadás leírása természetesen felesleges lett volna. Az átdolgozott vagy bővített kiadásoktól eltekintve a könyvtárak szempontjából valamennyi kiadás egyenértékű, és nyilván a beszerzés lehetőségei szabják majd meg, melyik kiadás kerül fel a könyvtárak polcaira.
Meg kell itt végül jegyeznünk, hogy gyűjtésünk egyik lényeges szempontja az anyag túlságos felduzzadásának elkerülése volt. Ezt tükrözi pl. az írói névsor, melyből az irodalom mai művelői néhány kiemelkedő kivételtől eltekintve - kimaradtak; vagy az a körülmény, hogy a történelem

szakban - annak bevezető jellege folytán a forráskiadványok közléséről teljességgel lemondtunk. Anyagunkat elégségesnek érezzük azonban egyfelől ahhoz, hogy a tájékozódáson túlmenően is alapul szolgáljon cikkek, előadások, kisebb tanulmányok megírásához; másfelől ahhoz, hogy a kutató tudomást szerezzen a tárgyára vonatkozó teljes szakirodalomról, hogy ezt könyvtárközi kölcsönzés útján (címe: Országos Széchényi Könyvtár, Könyvtárközi Kölcsönzés. H-l 827 Budapest) kölcsönként vagy kópiában megszerezhesse.
2.
A címanyag elrendezése során fentieknek megfelelően négy fő csoportot alakítottunk ki: bevezető rész, nyelvtudomány, irodalomtudomány, néprajz, s ehhez csatlakozik a folyóiratok közös jegyzéke. A hungarológia három fő területén belül - amennyire ez különbözőségük folytán lehetséges volt igyekeztünk a szakrendet összehangolni: az alapvető segédkönyvek és összefoglalások után az anyag az egyes szakok természetének megfelelően - forrásszövegek és feldolgozások elkülönítésével került elrendezésre; a szakok végén a tudománytörténeti feldolgozások és a vegyes tartalmú gyűjteményes kötetek foglalnak helyet. Az írók szerinti rész az írók betűrendjében halad, az irodalmi művek és a vonatkozó szakirodalom alfejezeteivel.
Az egyes szakrendeken belül kialakított fejezeteket a decimális osztályozás formális szabályai szerint tagoltuk. A fejezetek számozása minden szakterületen újra kezdődik; az olykor elengedhetetlen utalás (hiszen könyvtárjegyzékről lévén szó, minden művet csak egyszer szerepeltethettünk) mindig a szakterületen belül értendő.
A fejezetek anyagának rendezési elve - az irodalmi bibliográfiákban már megszokott módon - a megjelenés időrendje (kivéve a tanulmánykötet-fejezeteket, ahol a szerzői betűrend alkalmazása látszott célszerűbbnek). A több kiadásban megjelent művek - jellegük, megszerezhetőségük szempontjainak figyelembevételével - vagy az első, vagy az utolsó kiadás événél kaptak helyet.
A könyvjegyzék használója számára azt javasoljuk, hogy a vizsgálni kívánt tárgykörre vonatkozó (általában nem nagy) fejezet teljes áttekintésén kívül a tárgykört magába foglaló átfogóbb fejezeteket is tekintse át; sok esetben ugyanis valamely kérdéskör legújabb és legteljesebb feldolgozását egy összefoglaló kézikönyvben vagy monográfiában találhatja meg. Különösen áll ez az írók személyi anyagára: számos jelentős szerzőről nem készült modern monográfia, de a kézikönyvek részletesen foglalkoznak működésükkel, és megadják a rájuk vonatkozó, folyóiratokban megjelent szakirodalmat is.
Jegyzékünk szakrendje egyben a létesülő könyvtárak felállításának javasok rendje. Javasoljuk azonban, hogy a felállított könyvtár mellett, a használat megkönnyítésére - esetleg a jegyzék címleírásainak felhasználásával - összesített betűrendes katalógus létesüljön.

Kötetünk címleírásai a bibliográfiai leírásokban szokásos adatokat tartalmazzák: szerző, cím, műfaj, közreműködők, a kiadás sorszáma (ha nem első kiadás), a kötetszám (többkötetes műveknél), a megjelenés helye, a megjelenés éve, kiadó, lapszám, sorozati cím. Gondolatjel választja el az új kiadás adatait (csak a változott adatok közlésével), a reprint kiadásra vonatkozó adatokat, illetve annak megjelölését: kritikai volt-e a kiadás. A kiadóvállalat nevét - ha az semmitmondó volt - néhány

esetben elhagytuk. Épp így nem törekedtünk a többkötetes művek valamennyi lapszámának megadására, ha a kötetszám megadása elegendőnek látszott.
A címleírás alatt foglal helyet a sorozati cím alatt leírt sorozatok köteteinek (illetve egyes köteteinek) a sorozat címleírásában nem szereplő adatokat tartalmazó leírása.
A címleíráshoz nem tartozó megjegyzéseket a leírás után külön sorban közöltük.
A szerző és a közreműködő nevét, valamint az évszámot - utóbbit ott, ahol a rendezés alapjául szolgált - tipográfiai eszközökkel emeltük ki.

INTRODUCTION TO THE ENGLISH EDITION HISTORY OF TRANSYLVANIA
Volume I. From the Beginnings to 1606 Repercussions of the work
Objectives of the work
The task assumed by the Hungarian historians was to produce a comprehensive scholarly history of Transylvania from the earliest times to the present century. It must be emphasized that their goal was to exercise "maximum possible objectivity," and to clarify contentious issues by drawing on hard historical evidence. In the interest of "maximum objectivity," they adopted a comparative approach, presenting Transylvania's history in a European context and with due attention to Transylvania's links with Hungary, the Habsburg Empire, the Romanian principalities, Turkey, and other states of Europe. The comparative approach was also applied to Transylvania's internal affairs: the authors investigated the history — demographic, economic, social, political, and cultural — of all three major national groups in Transylvania. This was a notable departure from the practice of earlier historical works, which tended to focus on only one or the other of the ethnic components. Due attention was paid to one of Transylvania's distinctive features, inter-ethnic cooperation, without neglecting the elements of conflict that obtained in feudal times and in the age of nationalism.
It followed from this approach that the focus would lie not on ethnic continuity but on the role played by the various ethnic groups in a succession of political structures: the vajdaság (voivodeship) that formed part of medieval Hungary, the {1-7.} Principality of Transylvania founded on the "union of three nations," the abortive union in 1848–49, Habsburg absolutism, the dualistic system that prevailed from 1867 to 1918, and, in more summary fashion, the period marked by the incorporation of Transylvania into Romania. By taking political structures as their organizing principle, the editors and authors allowed for a chronological and thorough investigation of the patterns of change in political life as well as in the economic, social, and cultural spheres.
Particular attention was paid to the common and distinctive features of the several ethnic groups' cultures. In the context of Central Europe, Transylvania was distinguished by the fact that it harboured two civilisations: on the one hand, the Roman Catholic and Protestant, and on the other, the Greek Orthodox and Greek Catholic, which reflected both Eastern and Western influences in its value system, literature, art, and science.
The account of Transylvania's earliest history, covering the Dacian and Roman periods and the Great Migrations, draws primarily on archaeological sources. Archaeological findings, together with toponymic and documentary evidence, indicate that when the Hungarians arrived in the 9th century, they encountered Slavs and Bulgaro-Turks in the region; the first evidence of the presence of Romanians dates from the early 13th century. The authors remained divided over the question whether the Hungarians entered Transylvania directly from the east, across the Carpathians, or from the west. What is clear is that the Transylvanian voivodeship was an integral part of the Kingdom of Hungary, the voivodes being appointed by Hungary's monarch.
In the 16th and 17th centuries, the Principality of Transylvania came under the suzerainty of the Ottoman Turks, but it maintained close relations with the West and enjoyed a degree of economic and cultural development. The nobility ruled over Hungarian and Romanian villeins; Calvinism and Lutheranism contributed to the development of Romanian language and culture. In the Rákóczi-led {1-8.} rebellion against Habsburg rule, Hungarians, Slovaks, and Romanians formed a united front, setting an example of multi-ethnic cooperation in an era still untouched by the ideology of nationalism.
The work traces the emergence in the 18th century of the theory of Daco-Roman continuity and the demands voiced in the Romanian uprising led by Horea (1784). It investigates, in the context of political, social, and cultural history, the rise of Hungarian, Romanian, and Saxon nationalism in the early 19th century. The Hungarian liberals, who in 1848 championed Transylvania's reunification with Hungary, advocated reform of the prevailing neofeudal system in the region, and thereby contributed to the eventual emancipation of villeins and the entrenchment of civil rights. To be sure, during the War of Independence, Hungarian leaders underestimated the significance of inter-ethnic animosities and were late in seeking to cooperate with Romanian politicians.
With regard to the post-1867 period, the work investigates the profound impact of liberalism on the economic,

social, and cultural development of Transylvania, without neglecting to register the more repressive policies aimed at the Romanians. Responsibility for the Treaty of Trianon is clearly attributable to the victorious Entente powers, but note is taken of the Transylvanian Romanians' Gyulafehérvár (Alba Iulia) Declaration (1 December 1918) as well as of the fact that Transylvanian Hungarians were not consulted in the matter.
The three volumes of Erdély története, complete with maps, illustrations, and bibliographies, were published by the Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, in November 1986, and the several printings totalled 160,000 copies. In the Hungarian edition, the last section surveyed the fate of the region in the context of the Romanian state. The political constraints that prevailed at the time of publication allowed for only a brief survey of the interwar and post-1945 period, and this section is therefore omitted from the present, Englishlanguage edition.
{1-9.} The contributing authors followed the rules of their various academic disciplines, free of any official guideline. Thus the reader will encounter certain differences of opinion as well as hypotheses that are not fully developed. The authors have nevertheless succeeded in producing a cohesive work of scholarship, one that gives a comprehensive account of the history of Transylvania.

Volume I. From the Beginnings to 1606
I. TRANSYLVANIA IN PREHISTORY AND ANTIQUITY
Repercussions of the work
The first scholarly conference devoted to Erdély története was convened at Debrecen, in October 1987, when twenty-eight historians aired their comments and complementary contributions. Some of the participants complained that the work failed to investigate the ethnogenesis of the Romanians and that the post-1918 survey was too brief. Opinions differed on the circumstances of the Hungarians' settlement in Transylvania, on the nature of the medieval voivodeship, and on the relations between the Principality and the Sublime Porte. Kossuth's views on the nationality question received further elaboration, but it was noted that Hungarian political parties paid scant attention to these views either before or after 1867. Additional information was offered on the role of Freemasonry. Participants expanded on Mihály Károlyi's and Oscar Jászi's approaches to the nationality problem in 1918–19, and offered critical analysis of the Groza regime's policies towards the Hungarian minority in the post-1945 period. Several participants deplored there were no Hungarian historians from Transylvania among the work's authors, an absence that is attributable to the political constraints of the 1980s.[1]
Despite some reservations, the work was well-received in Hungarian emigre circles. A specialist in Transylvanian history, Elemér Illyés, wrote that "we have long awaited a work of such scope and high standard, one whose timeliness, wealth of information, objectivity, and, above all, scholarly quality lift it well above earlier efforts. It is a noteworthy achievement."[2]
{1-10.} It could be anticipated that Erdély története would incur sharp criticism from political and academic circles in Romania. The first response came in the political sphere, when the so-called Council of Nationalities was convened in Bucharest on 27 February 1987. Reading from prepared texts, the speakers, including some who lacked any expertise in the subject, roundly denounced a work that they had not read. In his address, President Nicolae Ceauşescu reaffirmed the theory of Daco-Roman continuity, evoked the cooperative efforts of Hungarians and Romanians against the Ottomans, and declared that in Romania the nationality question had been fully resolved. He denounced the work as a "falsification of history" that disturbed the harmonious relations between two socialist states.
There followed a series of attacks from Romanian historians. On 7 April 1987, the London Times carried a paid advertisement in which it was alleged that by backing publication of the work, the Hungarian Academy of Sciences had sponsored a falsification of history. A pamphlet appeared, penned by three Romanian historians, bearing the title "A Conscientious Forgery of History of Transylvania under the Aegis of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences."[3] The authors reiterated the basic tenets of Romanian historiography with regard to Daco-Roman continuity, the autonomy of the Transylvanian voivodeship, the national endeavours of the voivode Mihai Viteazul, the justified rebellion of Transylvania's Romanians during the Hungarian War of Independence in 184849, and the oppression of Romanians by Magyars in the period of the Dual Monarchy (citing, in support, Marx, Lenin, Tolstoy, and the Norwegian dramatist Kvikne Björnson). They credited Transylvania's Romanians for the annexation enshrined in the Treaty of Trianon, evoked the oppression of Romanians and the deportation of Jews between 1940 and 1945 in Northern Transylvania, and reiterated that the nationality question had been satisfactorily settled in Romania. They branded Erdély története a {1-11.} revisionist and chauvinist work reminiscent of Hungarian historiography in the Horthy era. Romanian emigre circles in the West excoriated a Communist dictatorship that oppressed Romanians and Hungarians alike in Romania but largely endorsed the official tenets of Romanian historiography.
In the wake of the above-noted advertisement, the Times Literary Supplement published, on 2 October 1987, a review article by the Oxford historian Norman Stone. The latter outlined the evolution of Transylvanian society and its religious pluralism, and praised the region's cultural legacy. He regretted that the 19th century was covered more lightly in the work than earlier periods, that disproportionate attention was paid to military and diplomatic history in the section on the 17th century, and that the post-1918 survey dealt too summarily with matters other than culture. Rejecting the theory of Daco-Roman continuity, Professor Stone marshalled evidence to show that the

Romanians had migrated into Transylvania from the Balkans. He evoked the different types of nationalism and the attempts at Hungarian-Romanian reconciliation in the post-1867 period, and challenged the claim that the nationality question had been resolved in Romania, citing some of the numerous anti-Hungarian measures taken by the Ceauşescu regime. His conclusion was that Romanian politicians and historians had over-reacted to a work that was undeniably scholarly in approach, "with an impeccable list of sources in various languages and grasp of difficult techniques in archaeology or the interpretation of place-names." Although not all English historians agreed with Norman Stone's contentions, the work itself was acknowledged to be of high scholarly calibre. Similarly, in a review published in Südost-Forschung (7 November 1988), the German scholar Gerhard Seewann found some cause for criticism but concluded that the work was the most up-to-date and comprehensive treatment of the history of Transylvania.
{1-12.} A conference involving French, Hungarian, and Romanian historians was convened in November 1992 at the Hungarian Institute in Paris. The French participants were J. Le Goff, who acted as chairman, J. Bérenger, and S. Rosière; from Romania came G. Cipaianu, the deputy director of the Historical Institute in Cluj (Kolozsvár), I. A. Pop, and F. Constantiniu, who was, along with Pascu, one of the signatories to the statement published in the London Times; and, from Hungary, G. Barta, A. Miskolczy, as well as the author of this introduction. The Hungarian participants summarized the rationale for the undertaking, stressing that the authors had sought to foster professionalism, objectivity, and scholarly debate.
The Romanian historians at the Paris meeting insisted on the validity of the theory of Daco-Roman continuity and invoked Anonymus's Chronicle — a source of dubious historical accuracy — in dismissing the notion of a "shifting ancestral land." They alleged that the Hungarians considered the Romanian people inferior because of the latter's predominantly pastoral occupation in earlier times. Further, they construed the Romanian uprising of 184849 as a reaction to Hungarian oppression, and the Trianon treaty as a "decision of the Romanian people." Although the Romanian historians conceded that, in some respects, the Hungarian authors had shown signs of progress, they observed that "plus ça change, plus c'est la même chose" — i.e., the work did not depart from the tenets of an earlier phase of Hungarian historiography.
The French historians did not feel qualified to take a stand on the question of Daco-Roman continuity (nor did the work in question offer a definitive judgment) and agreed that there was need for further research and scholarly debate. They dismissed the charge that the Romanian people were considered inferior, noting that there were no doubt some shepherds among the participants' ancestors. They confirmed that the terms of the Trianon treaty were the work of the Entente, and that the "decision of the people" at {1-13.} Gyulafehérvár (Alba Iulia) came after the terms were set. The conference chairman offered a reminder that the duty of historians was to uncover and analyze evidence and to bear in mind their influence on public opinion.[4]
In recent years, several more narrowly-focused studies — dealing mainly with 20th century Transylvania — have been published by Romanian, Saxon, and Hungarian historians. Romanian scholars have also begun publication of a comprehensive history of the region.[5]
Some of the authors and editors of the three-volume Erdély története — András Mócsy, László Makkai, Gábor Barta, and Zsolt Trócsányi — have since passed away. Their contribution was invaluable, and we honor their memory. István Bóna joined our ranks to help edit the abridged version that appeared in several languages, including English.[6]
The present publication presents the integral text of the three-volume edition, apart from the post-1920 period. Our hope and expectation is that English-speaking readers — scholars, students, and others interested in Central Europe — will welcome this history of Transylvania's peoples, an account that encompasses social change, the evolution of the nationality question, and the region's distinctive cultural development.

{1-17.} 1. THE PREHISTORY OF TRANSYLVANIA (Gábor Vékony)
The prehistory of the mountain-ringed Transylvanian basin cannot be separated that of the surrounding regions. Since time immemorial, traders and migrants have made their way along the valleys of the Szamos, Maros, and Olt rivers. The high mountain ranges did not deter men from seeking out rich mineral deposits, whereas some less imposing mountains have served as boundaries between proximate cultures even in prehistory: such is the case of the Csík-Háromszék basin, which was sheltered by the Hargita and the Barót mountains, or of the Barcaság and the adjoining high plateau of Fogaras. Because of recurrent migration into the region, and because of its distinctive topography, periods of cultural and ethnic homogeneity have been more the exception than the rule.
The first human settlement of Transylvania occurred relatively late. Although the hand axe unearthed at Kiskapus is considered representative of the Acheulian culture and formally classed with other finds from the penultimate (Riss) glaciation period, the lack of stratigraphic data makes this purely conjectural. The chopper found in the Olt valley at Rakovica, south of Nagyszeben, also gives scant guidance. To be sure, similar large pebble tools (?) have been found in the Dîrjov and the Argyas valleys, along with — though not in the same sites as — fauna from Pleistocene period. Until it is linked to evidence of settlements, the Rakovica find remains simply a pebble with a sharp edge.
The earliest authentic vestiges of human activity date from the Middle Palaeolithic period. At the beginning the last (Würm 1) glaciation, palaeoanthropoids sheltered in caves of the Middle Maros region, at Ponorohába, Csoklovina, and Nándor. There is evidence in some of these sites of links with more of less contemporary {1-18.} cave settlements in the Western Balkans. The tools — cutterscrapers, bores, and tips — are all fashioned of quartz, and they evoke techniques similar to those identified in Italy and the south of France. A distinctive feature is that while these people, who belonged to the so-called Charente, hunted young cave bears at their open-field settlement in Érd, Hungary, somewhat later, others in the Hátszeg region hunted mainly wild horses.
The caves were heated by fires that were seldom allowed to go out. At the Bordul Mare cave in Ponorohába, three fireplaces were found, one of them double and enclosed by flat stones. They contained traces of ash, charcoal and carbonized animal bones; the latter were probably used to keep the fire going. This site yielded the first human remnants: three fragments of finger bones.
Traces of Charentian culture were found not just in the Hátszeg region but throughout the south Carpathian region, at the Pestera site in the Törcsvár pass as well as at Baia de Fier on the southern flank of the mountain range. Interestingly enough, evidence from some sites in the proximate Banat indicates that quartzite culture survived until the Epipalaeolithic period.
The other Middle Palaeolithical finds in Transylvania, at Csoklovina and in the Torda Gap, are so atypical that few conclusions can be drawn from them. This uncertainty extends to the widespread traces of a so-called Moustier culture, some of which, at Vizakna, belong to the Late Palaeolithic period.
Judging from evidence found at the cave in Nándor-Felső, groups that made fully-worked flint implements appeared in Transylvania at the end of the Middle Palaeolithic period; they are commonly linked with the broadlydefined Szeleta culture, which produced leaf-shaped instruments. There is no evidence that they had any direct contact with earlier local cultures, and the two-faced tips in late Charentian finds can at best be attributed to their influence. With regard to the Aurignac culture, the implements found in Transylvania date from its later phase, during the second cold period {1-19.} of the last Ice Age (Würm 2); a few temporary cave dwellings (at Csoklovina, Ponorohába-Bordul Mare, and Barcarozsnyó) indicate the presence of Aurignacians, who gradually took the place of the leaf-blade-using bear hunters in the interglacial period between Würm 1 and 2. The richest sites were at Pestera, and at Szitabodza-Cremenea, the only place where an open-air tool workshop was uncovered; the implements found include not only the characteristic blades, but also scraper-like objects. What is missing everywhere, except at the Aurignac hill at Baia de Fier, is this culture's short-lived innovation, the polished bone

tip. The fire sites at Csoklovina indicate cave-bear hunters who, judging from a skull fragment, might have belonged to the Protonordic anthropological group (Predmost race).
In the Würm 2/3 period, the mammoth and reindeer hunters of the eastern Gravettian culture apparently skirted the southeastern Carpathian region. Only two cave sites near the source of the Dîmboviţa, at Barcarozsnyó-Ödweg and Pestera, testify to the passage of hunters from the plains. Szitabodza (Cremenea), where evidence of implement production was found, is also on Transylvania's periphery.
After the retreat of the ice sheet covering the Carpathians, the repopulation of the Transylvanian basin proceeded very slowly. Epigravette-Tardenois sites have been discovered only in southeastern Transylvania, along the upper reaches of the Bodza, at Szitabodza-Cremenea and Gîlma. The former is situated on the lower terrace of the river, while the latter is on a mountain peak. Besides tiny blades, tips, and scrapers, the characteristically trapezoid tools of the Epigravette-Tardenoisian culture are also present. At the same time, in the southwestern Carpathians and at the Iron Gates, Romanello-Azilian protoeuropids began to domesticate dogs and experiment with grain cultivation and pig husbandry (Schela Cladovei, Cuina Turcului, Icoana, Ostrovul Banului, Vlasac, Lepenski Vir). There is no evidence of similar activity in {1-20.} the Southeastern Carpathians, where only workshop sites have been uncovered so far. On the other hand, farther east, along the Dniester River, groups that made Epigravette-Tardenois tools were breeding pigs and cattle around 5500 B.C. (!), and it is conceivable that their western cousins did likewise.
The Epipalaeolithical groups' moves toward food production were interrupted by the arrival of people who belonged to the Starčevo-Körös culture of the southern Balkans. The latter brought from their homeland the practices, assimilated from Anatolian migrants, of wheat and barley cultivation and goat and sheep husbandry. The cultivation of millet and the domestication of cattle may have been their own 'invention'.
Their settlements, found on the banks and lower terraces of rivers, had above-ground dwellings constructed of posts, and wattle and daub (Bedeháza, Lécfalva), as well as dugout huts (Lécfalva, Maroscsapó). They buried their dead within the settlements (Sepsiszentgyörgy, Bedeháza, Kolozsvár-Bácstorok). Whereas the Epipalaeolithical Cro-Magnons buried their dead in a supine position, the people of the Starčevo-Körös culture laid the dead on their side, with knees bent, and did not usually put other objects in the grave.
The excavations reveal a varying but clear pattern of food production. At some sites, there is evidence in equal measure of hunted and domesticated animals; at others, the ratio of domesticated to hunted animals is better than six to one. Although goats and sheep were the first to be domesticated, the breeding of cattle became more prevalent; at some sites, there is evidence of a large number of pigs, while at others there is no trace of this animal. Such variations (based on data extrapolated to Transylvania) may owe to chronology, but they could also be explained by environmental factors.
Due to the scarcity of data, such variations can only be surmised in the case of cultivated and gathered foodstuffs. Grinding stones found at some Transylvanian sites were evidently used for {1-21.} grinding seeds, but these could have been other than cereal grain. Few of the stone tools have the short blade, with one corner polished to a dull shine, that would indicate a sickle. The Starčevo-Körös communities were nevertheless food-producers, even if they continued to hunt and scavenge. It also appears that some of the groups in Transylvania specialized in processing minerals; this would explain why they settled in certain caves that had remained unoccupied since the Late Pleistocene period (Ponorohába, Csoklovina).
The Starčevo-Körös people probably came to Transylvania from the Banat. Their earliest known settlement is at Kolozsvár (Bácstorok). By this time, around 5500 B.C., they were crafting spherical vessels, with a red coating sometimes decorated with white spots. Some of them moved down the Szamos valley and settled in the Great Hungarian Plain, there to mix with the local Epipalaeolithical population; this may explain the discovery at Bácstorok of both Alpine and Cro-Magnon types, buried, according to the custom of the age, within and between the dwellings.
Around 5000 B.C., new migrants reached Transylvania, probably along the Maros valley. Their material culture, traces of which are also found in the southern part of the Great Hungarian Plain, dominates the archaeological finds from this period in Transylvania. Their earliest trace is the settlement at Szászhermány, where, besides coarse vessels made of clay mixed with chaff, finer bowls were bound bearing the white-spotted, red coating seen in the

earlier period. Such painting is as rare in the Transylvanian settlements as it is in the southern part of the Great Hungarian Plain. Another exception is the Lécfalva site, where evidence of multicoloured painting was found. The finds of the early period show strong Bulgarian traits; the end of their settlement coincided with the final stage of the Starčevo-Körös culture.
During a brief, transitional period, southern Transylvania was inhabited by people of the Dudeşti culture, whose settlements had spread in western Wallachia; their presence is attested by finds in {1-22.} the lower stratum of Tordos IV and at Kőhalom. Then, in the Middle Neolithic period, the unity that had characterized the Early Neolithic disintegrated, and new groups migrated into Transylvania from many directions. The Vinča-Tordos culture appeared in the central reaches of the Maros River, between the southern Carpathians and the Érc Mountains, and in the east as far as Fogaras; other immigrants, identified by ceramics bearing linear decoration, moved from Moldavia into southeastern Transylvania, and in the northwest as far as the Mezőség. Traces of the Szakálhát group, which was present in the southeastern part of the Great Hungarian Plain, are found along the Szamos River (St Mihály cathedral, Kolozsvár), while farther north lived groups, known for painted ceramics, that were related to people of the northeastern Great Plain.
The Middle Neolithic pattern of population in Transylvania remained dominant until the end of the Copper Age. First to leave their Transylvanian home were a majority of the best-known, Vinča-Tordos people. When people from the central regions of the Balkans chose to settle around the Érc Mountains, they must have been drawn by the region's mineral riches; early copper tools were unearthed at Balomir and Radnót, and one of the oldest gold mines is in nearby Zalatna. They grew wheat and kept many animals, mainly cattle; domesticated animals provided some 70% of the meat consumed. Their raised, clay-floored dwellings were constructed of logs or wattle and daub. Their vessels include graceful cups, mostly with a red coating; spaces between the meandering incised lines have been indented with small sticks. Their culture is exceptionally rich in anthropomorphic and zoomorphic sculptures; these small clay figures may well have played a part in a fertility cult.
Of particular interest are small pictographic tablets, found at Tărtăria (Alsó-Tatárlaka) in 1961, which bear a remarkable resemblance to Protoelamite and Protosumerian objects. Given the distance {1-23.} in space as well as time — at least a millennium — between such finds in Transylvania and in Mesopotamia, it is questionable whether any contact might have existed between the two regions; early linear-geometric scripts bore common features even when they were developed in isolation. However, the inscribed tablets of Tărtăria reinforce the supposition that some of the signs on the clay products of the Vinča-Tordos culture were a form of writing. Thus, significantly, attempts at writing occurred in the Maros valley around 4000 B.C.; this implies the existence in the region of a quasi-state, focused on some simple shrine, and with a division of labour among the communities. Such a development would be scarcely conceivable if certain groups had not begun to use local metal ores and come to depend on others for grain and meat.
The attempt in Transylvania to construct a productive society marked by the central distribution of goods ultimately failed. New migrations interrupted this process. In the southeast, where the line-decorated ceramic culture had predominated, with people who practised primitive agriculture and animal husbandry (hunted animals accounted for at least 50 per cent of their consumption), the newcomers were people of the sheep- and goatbreeding, Boian culture in Moldavia and eastern Wallachia. Coming from the Olt valley, some smaller groups got as far as the middle reaches of the Maros, where their large pots and plates, decorated with excised triangular patterns and bunched lines, have been found in settlements of the Vinča-Tordos culture.
However, the major break came with the migration of painted-ceramics groups from the Szamos region in northern Transylvania, southward along the Maros valley. Their white or orange vessels, bearing red, and at times black, painted decoration, make an early appearance in the top layer of the Vinča-Tordos settlements, indicating a mingling of the two populations. Since finds of a later date show little evidence of this integration, it is likely that the majority of the Vinča-Tordos people fled or simply migrated along the Maros.
{1-24.} Thus, for a brief period at the beginning of the Late Neolithic age, most of Transylvania was inhabited by a uniform population, while the people of the Boian culture lived on in the southeastern highlands. Communities of the Petreşti culture, which had emerged from the painted pottery groups, occupied southern and some of central Transylvania for a long period. Their dwellings, constructed on a wood foundation in wattle and daub, were situated on river terraces and hills; some were built on stilts on dry land (Nagylak, Hermány). Their access to metal

ore led them to forge contacts with distant peoples, in Wallachia, Dobrudja, and perhaps even farther south. Their pots, baked to produce a metallic ring, were painted with curved and spiral designs in black, red, and brown colours. Dishes, shouldered mugs, and cylindrical underplates indicate a capacity to melt metals, and copper finds support this. Originals and copies of laminated gold jewellery, found as far as Bulgaria, Greece, and, in the north, the Kassa basin, suggest exploitation of the local gold deposits. The smaller number of finds relating to agriculture and animal husbandry may be explained by the spread of metallurgy.
The Petreşti culture continued to evolve until the end of the Copper Age, but only in the territories formerly inhabited by the Vinča-Tordos people. Sweeping across the eastern Carpathians from the Pontic steppes, mounted Protoeuropids, who were cattle-breeders, occupied the settlements of the painted pottery people in the Szamos region (Magyarpalatka). Departing from earlier Neolithic custom, they buried their dead in large cemeteries at some distance from their dwellings (Marosdécse, Melegföldvár), laying the bodies supine, with knees slightly bent; the graves also hold large Pontic stone knives, bulbous-headed stone maces (Vizakna, Gredistye), and simple cups. In keeping with eastern custom, they put red and ochre paint alongside the corpse.
At about the same time, people of the Cucuteni-Tripolje (Erősd) culture arrived to settle in area of the Boian culture, in {1-25.} southeastern Transylvania. Migrations in led to recurrent alteration in the character of the populations in the eastern half of the Carpathian Basin; the newcomers mixed with the earlier inhabitants, changing lifestyles and material culture.
This latest incursion gave rise to the Tiszapolgár culture, which became established in the Tisza region, northern Transylvania, and the Banat; some of its bearers reached southeastern Transylvania (Bögöz), others spread out from the Banat to the middle reaches of the Maros River (Szászsebes, Maroskarna, Déva). The primitive hut settlements (Kalota) of these cattle-herding, agricultural peoples consisting of simple huts and the villages of the Cucuteni-Tripolje culture ringed the region inhabited by people of the Petreşti culture; if the latter survived peacefully in this turbulent era, it was probably thanks to the surrounding peoples' dependence on their metal craftsmen.
The Petreşti people passed on skills in painting vessels to their new neighbours of the Cucuteni-Tripolje culture. One of the most important finds of these vessels, which were decorated in two or three colours (black, white, and red) prior to firing, was at a mountain settlement at Erősd-Tyiszk, in a layer over four meters deep. The dwellings were constructed of posts and wattle and daub and had rimmed open fireplaces made of clay. The inhabitants of Erősd were partially dependent on agriculture for their sustenance; their main crop was wheat, sown in single rows. Although they raised livestock, mainly cattle, much of their meat came from hunting. Most of their tools, such as axes and hoes, were made of stone and bone; copper was used only for awls and jewels. Small clay figurines and clay seals used for body-painting evoke their rites and clan structure.
The Cucuteni-Tripolje culture extended to the upper reaches of the Maros, where it came into contact with the Tiszapolgár culture. The latter's settlement area was subsequently occupied by the Bodrogkeresztúr culture, whose bearers sometimes settled in their {1-26.} predecessors' villages (Déva, Marosgezse). Since conditions for intensive agriculture and animal husbandry were more favourable in the Banat and on the Hungarian Great Plain, the extension of the Bodrogkeresztúr culture to Transylvania can only be explained by the lure of the region's mineral deposits. It is significant that the incidence of copper tools grows rapidly as one moves from Transylvania towards the central area of the Bodrogkeresztúr culture. Long and short axes as well as 'double-edged' pickaxes from the copper-mining districts made their way to the Great Plain, and small pieces of gold jewellery are commonly found in the burial places of the Tisza region. It is therefore not surprising that only one of these small gold objects was found in Transylvania, in a Bodrogkeresztúr site at Marosvásárhely.
In other respects, Bodrogkeresztúr finds in Transylvania are similar to those in the Great Plain. Their tombs contain bodies lying on their side, with bent knees, and surrounded by double-handled or flowerpot shaped jugs and by shallow bowls. They villages probably consisted of dwellings constructed at ground-level; one group, which settled among Cucuteni-Tripolje people erected small, wooden-floored, wattle and daub houses (Réty).
By the time the Bodrogkeresztúr people reached the Háromszék basin, a peculiar process of integration was emerging in Transylvania. Mixed elements of the Bodrogkeresztúr, Petreşti and Cucuteni-Tripolje cultures start appearing on the eastern fringe of the Mezőség (Somkerék, Dedrád), while, around the middle reaches of the



1. THE PREHISTORY OF TRANSYLVANIA (Gábor Vékony)

Maros, the mix involves the Bodrogkeresztúr and Petreşti cultures. At the end of this process of amalgamation, one finds the material remains of a culture that was the common legacy of southwestern Transylvanian and Oltenian tribes (Băile Herculane-Cheile Turzi group).
Some elements of the Transylvanian cultural mix reached the Great Plain (Hunyadihalom group), whilst others obviously following the Szamos River — reached Ruthenia and eastern Slovakia, {1-27.} where their material culture became more simplified and, at a later time, cremation became the practice (Lažnany group).
The Băile Herculane-Cheile Turzi group frequently lived in caves (Herkulesfürdő, Nándor, Torda Gap). These regions were more suited to hunting than to grain cultivation cattle-breeding. Farmers, animal breeders, metal workers, and gold dealers did not freely choose to withdraw to the isolation of bleak caves. The impulse came from shepherds from the eastern steppes, descendants of the Srednii Stog culture, who by this time were grazing their flocks in Wallachia and Moldavia (Herkulesfürdő II/b); their bands stormed over the Carpathians and scattered the local communities, driving the people of the Băile Herculane-Cheile Turzi culture into the mountains, caves, and distant regions. Although the local population seems to have managed to cohabit with the first wave of invaders (Herkulesfürdő, Băile Herculane III, Lažnany), the succeeding waves of eastern shepherds drove them first into the highlands, and then beyond.
Thus began a new era in the history of Transylvania, and indeed of East Central Europe. On the lower reaches of the Danube, the newcomers from the east blend with the local population, as do arrivals from the southern Balkans and perhaps also from Anatolia. Bearers of the evolving new culture (Cernavoda III) settle as far as the middle reaches of the Maros (Péterfalva,Tărtăria- Alsó- Tatárlaka, Baráthely-Paratély). Judging from the layout of the settlements, they were no longer entirely dependent on animal husbandry, and traces of their log-based dwellings indicate a protracted period of residence. They raised cattle, along with sheep, goats, and pigs. Of the cattle bones uncovered, most belong to old males, and a large number of oxen is a common sign of cultivation by plough, whether of the wooden or horn type.
A similar mixture is found in other spheres of material culture. These people made pots, adorned with ribs, out of clay mixed with sand or crushed shells; they also produced shiny grey mugs with {1-28.} channel decoration. Their axes and rhomboid swords are fashioned from copper or bronze; evidence of their faith includes both clay statuettes of Caucasian derivation, representing stylized sitting figures, and idol-like objects peculiar to the earlier inhabitants.
The slow emergence of this culture is abruptly halted around 2000 B.C., when a new wave of migration once again transforms Transylvania's population: groups of shepherds from the Macedonian and Bulgarian highlands move into southeastern Carpathian region. Their settlements appear first in Oltenia (Coţofeni I culture), southwestern Transylvania (Karácsonfalva, Tărtăria-Alsó Tatárlaka); later, during the Early Bronze Age, they spread over the entire territory of Transylvania (Coţofeni II, Kolozskorpád I). Evidence of their settlement can be found virtually everywhere, from the highlands to alluvial grasslands, and often in mountain caves. They were the first in Transylvania to cremate the dead, although skeletons — often powdered in ochre — have been found in the lower levels of their early burial grounds; they may have borrowed the latter custom from their eastern neighbours (Folteşti II culture), although it is equally conceivable that they were preserving their own, essentially East European traditions. The environment and nature of their numerous, scattered dwellings, fit the lifestyle of a seminomadic shepherd population. Signs of rudimentary agriculture appear only at a later time, together with a change in the structure of their dwellings: there is evidence at Kolozskorpád that one of their later communities used wattle and daub over a log foundation or log floor.
Although these people originated in an environment similar to that of the Cernavoda III culture, their pottery is radically different. In the early period (Coţofeni I), their large-handled, splayed water scoops, spherical jugs, and urns are decorated with short incised lines and striated indentations; a similar ornamentation and some similar vessels were also used in the Cernavoda III culture. Later (Coţofeni II), the decoration was elaborated with the addition of {1-29.} lentil-shaped designs. Another decorative innovation, mainly within Transylvania, is a line of small indentations designed for the encrustation of lime.
In the period of the Coţofeni II-Kolozskorpád culture, shepherd tribes from beyond the Carpathians flooded into southeastern Transylvania. People of the Folteşti III-Zăbala culture spread from the Háromszék Basin (Zabola) and



1. THE PREHISTORY OF TRANSYLVANIA (Gábor Vékony)
https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/9.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:18:00]
the Brassó area (Gesprengberg) to the middle reaches of the Maros (Vládháza, Nándor). Little is known of their settlements. Their dead were buried on their side, with their legs pulled up, sometimes in simple pits, at other times in stone chests covered by mounds of earth. Their spherical, two-handled vessels, tall, barrel-like amphorae, and ribbed coarse pots evoke not only the east, but also the west, where similar pieces have been found in the middle reaches of the Tisza River (Hatvan culture). Since these finds are sometimes mixed with those of the Coţofeni culture, it is possible that in some localities the two populations had merged.
Towards the middle of the Early Bronze Age, the people of the Folteşti III-Zăbala culture were supplanted in southeastern Transylvania (and throughout Wallachia) by a new wave of immigrants: the people of the Glina IIISchneckenberg culture. The new settlers built their villages on hills. There were fireplaces inside their small dwellings, and some had a stone bench next to the wall. Their domestic animals included many sheep, and primitive ploughs fashioned from antlers indicate that they ploughed the land.
The clay model of a chariot found at Kucsuláta signals the beginnings of beast-drawn vehicles. They had curved stone knives and polished stone axe-adzes, but only a few copper tools have been found: awls, chisels, flat axes, and swords. Their coarser vessels were made of clay mixed with sand and ground shells, whilst the surface of their single and double handled mugs and small, handled cups was worked smooth. Their dead were buried lying on {130.} their side in a crouched position in stone coffers, with, in rare cases, their personal effects.
While the region along the Olt River was settled by people of the Glina III-Schneckenberg culture, the other parts of Transylvania remained populated by the Coţofeni people. In this late period, their vessels' principal form of ornamentation is the stab and drag decoration (Cîlnic culture), while the lentil shape becomes less common or disappears. By now, as a consequence of a more settled way of life, their wattle and daub houses (Kelnek) have two rooms as well as a fireplace and oven. There may well be a link between their longer residence in one location and the fact that the Cîlnic culture's densest network of settlements is in the area of the Érc Mountains (Muntii Apuseni). The so-called eastern copper axes — precursors of which date from the Cernavoda III period — are common finds in the region (Sáromberke). To be sure, this weapon, widely used throughout East Central Europe, was not produced solely in the Cîlnic area; it is nevertheless significant that a major 'treasure,' consisting of over forty axes, was unearthed in this region, at Bányabükk.
Towards the end of the Early Bronze Age, when the Glina III-Schneckenberg and Cîlnic cultures were fading away, a group that decorated ceramics mainly with a cord pattern appeared in the eastern and northeastern parts of Transylvania. The artifacts of those who settled in the Csík Basin (Jigodin culture) had much in common with those of the Glina III-Schneckenberg culture, as well as some similarities with vessels produced by people who lived in the same period around Hungary's north-central mountains (Hatvan culture).
On the eve of the Middle Bronze Age, groups from Moldavia began to settle in the Háromszék Basin of southeast Transylvania. This Ciomortan culture was related to the Monteoru and Costişa cultures. Their settlement on the Várdomb [Castle Hill] at Csík-csomortány was fortified with earthworks. A few of their two-handled {1-31.} jugs, spherical dishes, and cups have been found in graves, where the dead were buried on their side, their legs pulled up.
They did not survive long in their few fortified settlements. Unable to halt the influx of new waves of people of the Monteoru culture, they were forced to move to the more westerly parts of Transylvania. Their vessels' typical decoration of scratched-in triangles and pairs of lines filled with dots, as well as their broad mugs are found again in the later Wietenberg culture.
The Wietenberg culture — the most significant legacy of Transylvania's population in the Middle Bronze Age can be found all over the mountain-ringed basin. The most important sources of this culture are believed to be the Coţofeni (Cîlnic) people, along with a contribution from people of the Tei culture, who came from Wallachia to invade the Barcaság. However, the earliest remnants of the Wietenberg culture were found far to the north, beyond boundary of Transylvania at Derzsida. The earlier remnants found within Transylvania have much in common with the Early Bronze Age Ottomány culture east of the Tisza, and only later objects (Wietenberg II) show influence of the Ciomortan and Tei cultures. The people of the Ottomány culture cremated their dead just as the Middle Bronze Age population of Transylvania had done, whereas the latter's neighbours on the Great Plain and elsewhere outside the Carpathian Basin buried them. Evidence found at Dés, as well as at Bágyon on the Aranyos River, suggests

that at the beginning of the Middle Bronze Age, people coming from east of the Tisza invaded Transylvania; there they intermingled with people of the Ciomortan culture and, farther south, of the Tei culture. It is thus possible, but most unlikely that Cîlnic people contributed to the formation of this new population of Transylvania.
The Wietenberg culture encompassed virtually all of Transylvania, expelling or absorbing groups of the Tei culture in southern Transylvania. Only the region beyond the Hargita remained beyond their reach; the Háromszék Basin was won by the {1-32.} Monteoru people, who had managed to displace the people of the Ciomortan culture.
Wietenberg settlements were situated on the lower terraces of rivers, on plateaux, and on easily defended hilltops. Their dwellings were of wood beams or on wooden foundations, although sunken dwellings have also been found (Radnót). Little evidence remains of their agricultural activity, but hunting and animal husbandry, mainly of cattle, played an important role. Since they had exclusive control over Transylvania's metal ores, they must have traded gold for their neighbours' grain.
Wietenberg settlements have yielded finds of all the types of bronze objects and gold jewellery known in East Central Europe at the time, but only rarely as part of a hidden treasure. Yet their territory is ringed by treasuretroves. This fact, along with their 'citadels', leads to the conclusion the Wietenberg people had a numerically strong and militant aristocracy. Their weapons included not only eastern-type bronze axes and double axes, but also rapiers identical in form with those favoured by the Mycenaean Achaeans (Sáromberke, Énlaka, Gyulafehérvár, etc.). The latter were not a customary weapon in Eastern Europe, and it is also noteworthy that, in contrast to the neighbouring regions, there is no evidence in Transylvania of horseback riding; then again, long rapiers were illsuited to mounted combat.
Since there are other apparent links between the Wietenberg and the Mycenaean cultures (the prevalence of spiral decoration is often cited) it is conceivable that, in the 15th and 16th centuries B.C., warriors from the south had come to rule over the population of Transylvania. This aristocracy grew wealthy thanks to the spreading exploitation of mineral deposits and the sale of metal products. The latter are found most often outside the settlement area of the Wietenberg culture, where their traders could easily have fallen prey to treasure-seeking foreigners. This may explain the hoard of gold axes, disks and other jewellery found at Cófalva, {1-33.} in the area of the Monteoru culture), and the gold swords and rapiers unearthed at Perşinari, in Wallachia, where the Tei culture prevailed, as well as other, similar finds on the periphery of the Wietenberg culture's domain.
The prosperity induced by gold was apparent in all aspects of life. Women, dispensed of agricultural labour, engaged in decorative household crafts; the principal evidence consists of richly decorated clay vessels. Their spherical pots, shallow, handled bowls, and dishes were decorated with impressed and incised, wavy and spiral designs. Ascoi, mixing bowls with multiple openings, and chariot models were produced to serve in their diversified rituals. The main feature of their religious buildings was the decorated, sacred fireplace, such as the one found near Segesvár, at Wietenberg — the place that gave its name to their culture.
At the end of the 14th century B.C., the Carpathian Basin was invaded from the north by Central European tribes of shepherds. The invasion set off a chain reaction of migrations, and these destabilized — directly or indirectly the economy of the Transylvanian goldsmiths, merchants, and warriors. Familiar trading routes were now overrun with strangers. When groups of the latter seek refuge in Transylvania, local people bury their valuables (Igenpataka, Déva, Somogyom). Moving along the Maros on the heels of the fleeing locals, people of the Tumulus (Hügelgraber) culture occupied the entire area of southern Transylvania, as attested by finds near Nagyszeben (Hermány), in the Mezőség (Mezőbánd, Malomfalva), and even beyond the Hargita (Kézdiszentlélek). They, together with former inhabitants of the Great Hungarian Plain, settle also in southwestern Transylvania (Déva, Vajdahunyad). Some of the Wietenberg people withdrew to the mountains (their cave settlements date from this period), but most of them move northward. There, along the Szamos, in Máramaros and Ruthenia, they joined forces with people of the Gyulavarsánd culture resist the pressure of the Tumulus (Hügelgraber) people and {1-34.} others who had joined the latter. Elsewhere, communities were shattered into small remnants that survived in much-reduced material circumstances.
Due to the turbulence and social disintegration, Transylvania at the beginning of the Late Bronze Age became easy prey for shepherds of the eastern steppes. There are no treasure finds to indicate the resulting movement of peoples, presumably because by then locals had little treasure left to conceal. The new occupiers, people of the

Noua culture, reached Transylvania through the Carpathian mountain passes and spread as far as the middle reaches of the Szamos River in the north and the Érc Mountains in the west. Some followed the Szamos all the way to the eastern Great Plain, where they were absorbed into an already mixed population, the Berkesz-Demecser group.
Little is known about the settlements of this cattle- and sheep- breeding people. Their dwellings were presumably similar to the light, wooden constructions they had erected in Moldavia. Burial grounds (Brassó, Keresztényfalva, Hermány, Tövis, etc.) reveal their dead lying on their side, legs drawn up, or the remains of cremation. Most of their simple, rib-decorated pots and two-handled jugs were produced by assimilated groups from Monteoru culture. Their three-edged bone arrowheads, triple-pierced bridle links made of bone, knobbed bronze pins, and sickles with hooked handles all evoke a distant eastern culture, that of Sabatinovka people, who lived between the Dnieper and Dniester rivers. These Protoeuropids (Alpine and Mediterranean anthropological types were also present in Transylvania) probably spoke Ancient Iranian, and thus settlement of the Noua people in Carpathian Basin represents the first appearance of Iranian groups in the region.
It is noteworthy that most of the metal tools identified with the newcomers were found beyond their area of settlement, in the territory of the Felsőszőcs culture. The weapons and tools of the conquerors appear to have been produced by the Late Bronze Age {1-35.} descendants of the Wietenberg culture. The relationship between the two peoples was peculiarly symbiotic in some places: the tumuli of Oláhlápos contain objects from both the Felsőszőcs and the Noua cultures.
Sometime around 1000 B.C., the inhabitants of Transylvania and the Szamos-Tisza region were driven to bury their accumulated treasures (Felőr, Domahida, Ópályi). It was, however, mainly the people of the Felsőszőcs culture who hid their valuables, as seen at Felőr and Domahida. To escape servitude, most of the Noua people fled eastward.
The new conquerors, groups of people of the Gáva culture, occupied the Küküllő region (Medgyes), then the Olt valley (Réty), the Mezőség, and the Szamos region (Oláhlápos). Some of their dwellings were built of wood beams or on wooden foundations, others were oval or square, sunken huts with a central, plastered fireplace; some of their settlements were fortified. They bred mainly cattle but also kept many horses. Although many bronze sickles have been found, agriculture was not a major activity, and they obtained much of their meat by hunting.
Their arrival sparked off a renaissance of bronze craft in the region of the Érc Mountains. Almost all of their implements, weapons, and jewellery was fashioned from bronze; huge stores of axes, sickles, swords, lances, belts, pins, and vessels have been unearthed at Ispánlaka, Felsőmarosújvár, Nagysink and Marosfelfalu (Cincu-Suseni 'horizon').
By the end of the Late Bronze Age, the people of the Gáva culture, who buried cremated remains in urns, and related groups had expanded their domain. Their settlements and burial places are found not only in Transylvania, but also in the Banat, in areas east of the Tisza, and, east of the Carpathians, in Galicia and Bessarabia (Holihrad and Kisinyov cultures). Some of their groups travelled across the wooded steppes as far as the Dnieper River. Judging from the material evidence, peoples who lived at this time south of {1-36.} the Carpathians, in Wallachia and northern Bulgaria, spoke a language related to that of the Gáva culture (Babadag and Pšeničevo cultures). This region is roughly contiguous with the subsequent settlement areas of the Dacians, Gaetians, and Mysians.
Between the end of the Late Bronze Age and the first mention of these peoples in ancient sources, there were no migrations significant enough to radically alter the composition of the population. It is therefore likely that the finds from the Gáva culture and related groups are the legacy of ancestors of Dacians, Gaetians and Mysians. Their origins are clear: the indigenous communities of Middle Bronze Age people and conquerors bearing the Tumulus culture had coalesced by the end of the Late Bronze Age into a group of peoples speaking identical or related languages. The stability of this pattern is reinforced by the organizing skills of an equestrian group that arrived from the east in the middle of the Late Bronze Age. To be sure, the latter's rule was short-lived; well before the end of the Late Bronze Age, they were driven to hide their characteristic harness pieces and Caucasian axes — not only in Transylvania, but also in Transdanubia and in the region between the Drava and Sava rivers (Felsőmarosújvár, Ispánlaka, Karánsebes, Kőfarka). The first evidence of iron tools seems to coincide with their appearance in the region (Oláhlápos, Bogda, Babadag). There followed an extended period of peace in Transylvania; storehouses

dating from the end of the Late Bronze Age (Mojgrád, Pusztatóti, etc.) reveal that blacksmiths produced mainly axes and sickles. Although such tools could be used in battle, their primary purpose was cultivation.
The peaceful life of miners and merchants was disrupted at the end of the Late Bronze Age. Once again, horsemen from Asia broke into the Danubian region and the Carpathian Basin. This culturally mixed group, given to much infighting, sowed chaos, devastating villages and depopulating entire regions. When the resulting waves of forced migration subside, small and, for the most part, {1-37.} culturally-mixed communities appear along the Danube (Balta Verde, Bosut, Dálya, Mezőcsát groups). On the territories of the Gáva culture and its related groups, new populations emerge. The majority of Transylvania's Late Bronze Age inhabitants thus left the region, most probably for destinations beyond the Carpathians. Their deserted villages were occupied by newcomers as well as by settlers from the Lower Danube and a smaller number of migrants southern Transdanubia.
The people of the Basarab culture settled initially along the middle reaches of the Maros (Gyulafehérvár, TărtăriaAlsó-Tatárlaka), and then throughout the Transylvanian Basin (Marosvásárhely, Maroscsapó, Kolozsmonostor). Their settlements in Transylvania, unlike those in Wallachia, were occupied for a considerable period of time, and many were fortified. They erected wattle and daub dwellings as well as some light, above-ground structures, and lived mainly off animal husbandry. A significant part of the population must have been involved in metalworking; significantly, finds in the border regions contain bronze objects that were seldom if ever used by Transylvanians, but which were commonly used in the surrounding areas (Marosportus, Alvinc, Vajdéj).
The Basarabi culture was marked by advanced ironworking; iron objects include not only weapons and tools, but also a growing number of harness pieces and clothing accessories. The newcomers soon shed their former bronze objects; the earlier bronze bridle links and bits (Maroscsapó) soon give way to replicas made of iron (Maroscsapó, Maroskeresztúr). Their weapons — swords and "Scythian" daggers — often resemble the swords with open, ringed hilts of the Late Bronze Age (Aldoboly, Maroscsapó). Single-edged, curved daggers have also been unearthed, bearing T-shaped hilts similar to those found on the typical weapons of the neighbouring Balta Verde group (Miriszló, Borosbenedek).
{1-38.} Although little has transpired about their ability to work gold, it is not unlikely that they produced many of the gold objects found in the Carpathians. A case in point is the early treasure unearthed at Mihályfalva; it includes counterparts of a bracelet found at Dálya and a winged pearl find from the Michałkowo hoard. Since gold objects appear infrequently even in later finds, it can be surmised that the Basarabi goldsmiths produced mainly for 'export'.
The burial rituals of the time are uniform throughout Transylvania. The dead were interred flat on their back, with their heads pointing east or west, along with their weapons and tools as well as jewels and clothing. The graves contained food, principally beef, and, judging from the vessels, drink. According to a strict ritual, only three types of vessels were placed next to the corpse: urns, cups with handles, and bowls with narrowed openings. In the early period of settlement, shortly after the end of the Late Bronze Age, there is evidence of interment in burial mounts, complete with the deceased's horse (Maroscsapó, Nagyenyed), but the vessels in these graves are similar to the later ones. At a time when wheel pottery became common in the Great Hungarian Plain and along the Lower Danube, the Transylvanian peoples continued to inter vessels of the earlier type.
There is no doubt that this early Iron Age people, with its strict rituals, was related to the Scythians. Herodotus, writing at the end of the 5th century B.C. (but using information recorded by Hecataeus at the end of the 6th century B.C.), claims that the Maros passed through the land of the Agathyrsi before joining the Danube;[1] and the Agathyrsi were neighbours of the Neuri,[2] who, however, lived along the Bug, hear the source of the Tyras (Dniester) River.[3] Thus this information may have a bearing not only on Transylvania, but also on the eastern half, or indeed the whole of the Carpathian Basin.
When, at the end of the 6th century B.C., the Persian King Darius waged war in Europe against the Scythians, the Agathyrsi {1-39.} turned against the latter. This suggests a link, possibly an 'alliance' between Persians and Agathyrsi, and lends added significance to the epigraph of Darius found in Transylvania, at Szamosújvár.
According to Herodotus (or Hecataeus), the Agathyrsi were refined people who wore gold jewellery and practised polyandry (or, in a less likely interpretation, group marriage).[4] In any case, Hecataeus' information can hardly

apply to the majority of Transylvanian cemeteries (Csombord type) that belong to the late period; it must refer to the earlier periods.
The Agathyrsi of Transylvania were still extending their domain around 500 B.C., and their characteristic products have been found in the eastern half of the Great Plain (Ártánd). When, at the beginning of the 5th century B.C., Wallachian (Ferigile culture) and mid-Balkan groups moved into the region, the Agathyrsi evacuate the Great Plain but live on peacefully in their Transylvanian settlements. Finds of metallic objects within and beyond the Carpathian Basin (mirrors, akinakai, quiver closures, etc.) indicate that they continued to supply Scythian objects to neighbouring and even distant regions.
However, the Greeks lose track of the Agathyrsi. Herodotus does mention one of their kings, Spargapeithes, who ruled around the middle of the 5th century B.C.,[5] but last to name them is Alexander the Great's teacher, Aristotle: he observes that they were law-abiding people who chanted their laws.[6] The Agathyrsi were still present in Transylvania around the middle of the 4th century B.C. Then, according to archaeological evidence, they cease to bury their dead in Agathyrsi cemeteries and disappear without a trace. Their emigration was prompted by the arrival of the Celts. The latter had appeared on the eastern flanks of the Balkan mountain range at the end of the 4th century B.C. It is known that the Celts sent peace emissaries to Alexander the Great in 335 B.C., and that subsequently Cassandros repelled their attacks in the Balkan mountains.
{1-40.} A depopulated Transylvania attracted Celtic groups in search of a new home. Archaeological evidence of their settlement dates mainly from the beginning of the 3rd century B.C.; the few earlier traces are the graves of warriors who had fought in the Balkans (?Oláhszilvás). Among the La Tène finds in Transylvania, those few objects that can be considered authentically Celtic were unearthed near the Érc Mountains (Nagyenyed, ? Oláhszilvás) and in the Sajó and Nagy-Szamos regions (Újős — if it really belongs here —, Erked, Csépán). Within the population of the Transylvanian part of future Dacia, only one group is of probably Celtic origin, the Kothinoi/Kothensioi.[7] The other part of this tribe settled in the western part of the Hungarian North-Central mountain-range and, according to Tacitus, was engaged in the shameful activity of extracting iron ore.[8] Correlations between the data allow us to speculate that the Kothinoi of Dacia were descendants of the Celts who had settled in the 3rd century B.C. The latter formed a small if significant minority in Transylvania's population of the Celtic era.
Most of the new settlers were Dacians who came from the Great Plain (Vekerzug group). Despite the predominance of Celtic 'fashion', the earlier characteristics of the Dacians' material culture remain discernible in the widely disseminated, monochrome handicrafts — large pots, single-handled jugs, and small, curved knives. Most of the Late Iron Age cemeteries in Transylvania hold Dacian remains. The burial rites were as varied as in the Great Plain: some of the bodies were entombed, while others were cremated, their ashes being scattered in the bottom of the grave or buried in urns (Nagyenyed, Dipsa, Apahida, Újős).
The spread of wheel pottery, and of iron implements destined for agricultural use and household crafts, indicates the emergence of full-time craftsmen, who conceivably belonged to a distinct ethnic group such as Kothinoi. The presence of weapons, of numerous harnesses, and of war chariots in some settlements (Székelykeresztúr, Prázsmár) and the absence of arms in others (Apahida) {1-41.} suggests the existence of a ruling warrior aristocracy. Such a social structure indicates the production of a significant surplus, which, in turn, invited replacement of the barter system by monetary instruments of exchange in Transylvania and the adjoining regions.
The first 'eastern Celtic', or 'Dacian' coins to be minted were based on the tetradrachmas of Philip II and Alexander the Great; initially, both the original coins of the Macedonian kings and the imitations were in circulation. Minting is a faithful mirror of political change, for when, around 80 B.C., Burebista became ruler, the minting of copies of the Macedonian coins stopped. However, the contact between Transylvania and the 'Celtic world' had been severed earlier; the coins (scypathi) produced by local mints after 150 B.C. were seldom if ever used beyond the Carpathians and the Great Hungarian Plain.
From this point, and until the advent of the Dacian kingdom, the material culture of the Transylvanian Basin's population underwent a gradual transformation. Although striped, painted vessels were placed in graves as late as the 1st century B.C. (Baráthely-Paratély), and the traditions of ironworking endure, a new cultural dimension appears in the Pontus-type finds of 'Dacian forts' and 'Dacian silver hoards'. It seems that an important factor in this

development was immigration from Wallachia and Moldavia, although it is still unclear whether the movement occurred within Burebista's kingdom or was a prelude to the establishment of that kingdom. In any case, evidence showing the union of Dacians and Getae under a single ruler belongs to the history of the Dacian kingdom, as does the close contact forged with Greek cities on the Black Sea.

{1-42.} 2. THE DACIAN KINGDOM (András Mócsy)
The date and credibility of the earliest reports concerning a Dacian people are contested. The ancient assumption, that slaves, who figured in New Attican (4th century B.C.) plays under the name of Daos, were in fact Dacians, is less than plausible, for the first confirmed report of the Dacians' existence refers to a time at least two centuries later, whilst the Romans first reached the Danube even later, between 76-73 B.C. The utility of our data is limited both by the fact that only fragments of the detailed chronicles survive, and by the fact that the reflections on individual peoples found in these chronicles often compress events stretching over several historical periods. Thus historical research has not been able to establish clearly whether King Oroles of Dacia made war against his eastern neighbours, the Celtic Bastarnae, in the 2nd century B.C., or in some much later, equally indeterminate period. There is a similar lack of consensus over such an essential question as the identity of King Rubobostes, who is claimed by one source to have built up the power of Dacia; was he the first significant Dacian ruler, some time during the 2nd century B.C., or was his name merely a misspelling of Burebista, the king who is generally credited with founding a powerful Dacia? A further difficulty derives from the fact that more than one name has been attributed to the Dacians. The tribes that spoke Thracian and lived in the eastern half of the Balkan peninsula, the lower Danube valley, and Transylvania were called by a variety of names in Greek and Roman literature. The Thracians proper, who had very early contact with Greek culture, inhabited a region bounded in the north by the Balkan Mountains and in the west by Macedonia, while the Getae lived in a region north of the Balkan Mountains, along the lower reaches of the Danube. The Dacians of Transylvania, who were the {1-43.} last Thracian-speaking people to come to the notice of Greco-Roman world, are also called Getae in Greek sources; and Roman historians, who drew upon Greek sources, often — and arbitrarily — translated the appellation 'Getae' as 'Dacian', even when, as it happened, they were referring to authentic Getae. Thus caution must be exercised when dealing with the fragmentary sources that mention Dacians in the context of the wars, waged by the Romans in the 2nd and 1st centuries B.C., on the northern borders of Macedonia, against various Thracian, Getian, and Celtic tribes.
The Getae came into early contact with the Greeks. The development of their trade, crafts, and art was stimulated by contact with the Greek cities on the Black Sea, both directly and through the mediation of Thracian tribes. Within Transylvania, there is no significant trace of such Greek influence in the late Iron Age. It is all the more surprising, then, that Greek coins from the 2nd century B.C. (Macedonian and Thasos tetradrachma) have been found in larger number in southern Transylvania than in the lowlands south of the Carpathians. It is not known when these coins reached Transylvania. What is clear is that the Getae started producing silver copies of Greek coins well before such minting began — around 50 B.C., according to a recent study — in Transylvania. Thus the beginning of coinage in Transylvania coincides with that of Burebista's rule, and finds abound precisely at the center of the nascent Dacian state, in an area bounded by the Ruszka, Szörényi and Kudzsir mountains, and, in the north, by the Maros valley.
That region's mountainous borders to the south impeded access, but the Maros, Zsil, and Olt valleys allowed access to the Danube. The center of the nascent state was in the valley of the Városvíz, a tributary of the Maros. Numerous fortified hill settlements were established in the 1st century B.C. Recent research points to a significant growth in the number of non-fortified settlements in the 2nd and 1st centuries B.C., which implies a progressive transformation of Dacian society, but the nature of this change {1-44.} is not clear. The strong Celtic influence northern Transylvania presumably contributed to technological development. Besides the iron tools, potter's wheels, and other technical innovations, the hill fortresses can also be attributed to the influence of late Celtic, Oppidum culture. Coins and the advent of local minting indicate that silver was becoming a measure of the value of certain goods and a means of accumulating wealth. However, as in the case of the Danubian Celts, it cannot be concluded that the existence of coinage signified general acceptance of this measure of value or the advent of market-oriented production. By all indications, the Dacians lived in a predominantly subsistence economy; even domestic pottery was produced mainly in homes, and not for the market but for personal or local consumption. In this respect, even at the time of the Dacian kingdom, the economy of the Dacians was less developed than that of



2. THE DACIAN KINGDOM (András Mócsy)
https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/10.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:18:12]
the Danubian Celts.
The building of fortified settlements, the accumulation of silver and other valuables, and, above all, the spectacular and unexpected consolidation of Dacian power all point to a high degree of social stratification. What internal factors might have spurred this development? The little light shed by historical sources on Dacian society projects the image of two sharply-divided, caste-like strata: the 'tarabostes', or 'cap-wearing people', and the 'long-haired people'. Indeed, subsequent portrayals of Dacian notables show them wearing headgear made of felt, sometimes of fur, and resembling Phrygian bonnets. The polarization between a small caste of notables and a vast, exploited mass of people explains the duality of Dacian archaeological finds, a feature that is absent in other late Iron Age finds in the Danube region. The typical finds in Dacian fortresses consist of Greek pottery and mirrors, and elaborate, locally-produced silver objects; the finds in unfortified settlements, on the other hand, consist of handformed pottery that is very simple, even coarse, and bears the mark of the early Iron Age, as well as of primitive metal goods.
{1-45.} To be sure, the history of the Balkan and Danubian regions in the last centuries B.C. reveals other instances of a tribe, or group of tribes, investing vast territories in short order, and of linguistically different tribes being recruited as allies or subjugated and exploited. Even before the Dacians had come to power in the lower and middle reaches of the Danube, Roman Macedonia had come under attack, first by the Celtic Scordisci, and then, after 100 B.C., by the Dardani. From the middle of the 3rd century B.C., the Scordisci based themselves in the region of what is now Belgrade; the Dardani's ancient homeland lay in the southern part of today's Serbia and in Macedonia. Early sources identify the Scordisci as Rome's sole or principal enemy in the Balkans; the Dardani were seldom mentioned, and then only as one of the Thracian tribes allied with the Scordisci against Rome. When the Scordisci's power waned around 100 B.C., they came to be listed less and less frequently among Rome's Balkan foes, while references to Dardani and other Thracian 'allies' of the Scordisci become more frequent.
Similarly, the political history of the Carpathian basin in the last few centuries B.C. is marked by transitional supremacy of a tribe or group of tribes. At the end of the 2nd century B.C., the northwestern part of the Carpathian basin was ruled by an alliance of Celtic tribes led by the Boii. The Scordisci were predominant in the Sava valley, and they kept the Pannonic tribes, who lived between the Sava and the Drava rivers, in subjection until ca. 100 B.C.; their local hegemony collapsed probably in consequence of the successive defeats they suffered at the hands of Romans attacking from Macedonia. When King Mithridates of Pontus made plans to attack the Romans by way of the Balkan peninsula and the Apennines, he referred to the Pannonic tribes, and not to the Scordisci, as masters of the region on his path; it appears, therefore, that around 70–60 B.C., the Pannonic tribes were no longer subjugated.
Around 50 B.C., these tribes of the Carpathian basin and Balkan peninsula were confronted by the Dacian ruler Burebista, {1-46.} who began suddenly to expand his domain. As noted, the sources do not indicate clearly whether Burebista was the original unifier of the Dacian tribes, or whether his efforts at unification built upon the work of his predecessors, such as the mysterious Rubobostes. The sources date the period of his rule by reference to important events in Roman history: the high priest Decaineus, Burebista's chief assistant and adviser, reached Dacia in the year of Sulla's accession to power (82 B.C.), and the assassination of Burebista coincided with that of Caesar (44 B.C.). These correlations indicate that Burebista reigned in the middle of the 1st century B.C. By all accounts, he ruled for a long period, perhaps as much as forty years. According to our most important source, Strabo, Burebista completed his vast conquest in a short period of time. An epigraph at Dionysiopolis (Balczik, Bulgaria) indicates that by 48 B.C. he was regarded as the 'first and greatest king to rule over Thracia'.[9] The same inscription mentions that Dionysiopolis sent a delegation to the father of a Getae ruler, and that the latter met the envoys at Argedava. Due to the fragmented state of the text, it cannot be ascertained whether this ruler in Argedava was Burebista's father. Nor is it evident that Argedava is the same place as Arcidava (Varadia), situated on the eastern fringe of the Banat. If that is the case, then the ruler who received the Greek delegation in Argedava may well have been Burebista's father. On the other hand, there is no indication that Burebista exerted any influence over Greek cities on the Black Sea during the first half of his reign. The Dacians do not feature in the bold plans of King Mithridates in 70–60 B.C., either as enemies or as allies, which suggests that their sphere of influence did not yet extend to the lower Danube or the Black Sea coast. In all likelihood, then, Burebista completed his conquests in a brief space of time between 60–50 B.C. In the earlier, and longer phase of his rule, he must have concentrated on unifying the Dacian tribes, and on establishing and consolidating a centralized realm. In this task, which no doubt

involved bloodshed, he had the aid and {1-47.} counsel of the high priest Decaineus, who was said to enjoy 'virtually regal' powers.
With the considerable accomplishment of unifying the Dacian tribes behind him, Burebista proceeded to conquer in short order vast territories. The sequence of his conquests is not clear, for sources provide only a few bare facts. Burebista expanded the Dacian domains in three major directions. To the southeast, he reached as far as the Black Sea and seized Greek cities from Olbia, at the mouth of the Dnieper, to Apollonia (Sozopol, Bulgaria). It is likely that before he launched this campaign, Burebista subjugated the Getian tribes along the lower reaches of the Danube, and also the Bastarnae, who lived to the north of the Getae, on the eastern side of the Carpathians. A people of Germanic or Celtic origin, the Bastarnae had already supplied troops to the kings of Macedonia in the 2nd century B.C., and they would continue to serve as mercenaries of foreign powers; after Burebista's death, they fought against the Romans as allies or mercenaries of the Dacians.
Much to Rome's alarm, Burebista's second target was Macedonia. His armies crossed the Danube and, plundering their way across the Balkan peninsula, headed for the Roman province of Macedonia and the Dalmatian coast, which was also under Roman control. In the last years of Julius Caesar's rule, fending off the Dacian menace was a prime concern of Roman foreign policy. In the event, the only tangible evidence of this conquest is that the Scordisci, defeated by Burebista, became his allies in subsequent campaigns, and that the Dacians established a lasting presence south of the Danube, in the northern part of today's Serbia.
The third, westward direction of Dacian expansion touched the neighbouring Celtic tribes. In the first half of the 1st century B.C., the Boian alliance encompassed Celtic tribes that had settled in northern Transylvania. Burebista first objective was probably to subjugate these tribes, the Taurisci and the Anartes; in the process, he confronted the Celtic tribal (Boian) alliance that dominated the {1-48.} entire northern half of the Carpathian Basin. The clash occurred when Burebista crossed the Tisza and headed towards the Boian tribe's heartland in northwestern Transdanubia and western Slovakia. His victory over the Celts led not only to the breakup of the Boian alliance, but also to the establishment of Dacian settlements in the southern parts of today's Slovakia. Evidence of this settlement includes characteristic hand-formed Dacian pottery, as well as the 'Dacianization' of Celtic names in the region during the 2nd century A.D.
The resulting change in the balance of power on the middle and lower reaches of the Danube worried the Romans, all the more because a people virtually unknown to them and living beyond their sphere of influence had suddenly emerged as a major political factor in the hinterland of Illyricum (the Dalmatian coast) and Macedonia. Thus the destruction of Dacian power became one of Julius Caesar's key political objectives, and he made plans to launch an offensive from Macedonia. Had Caesar not been assassinated, the campaign would probably have got under way in 44 or 43 B.C. Burebista, too, fell victim to his political enemies at about the same time. The plot (the sources speak of a rebellion) may have served the interests of dissident Dacian nobles, for the unification of the Dacian tribes no doubt required the dismissal of many independent chieftains. Nor can it be ruled out that the Romans had a hand in the plot; in the period after Burebista's demise, more than one Dacian ruler kept contact with Octavian and Mark Antony.
At the peak of his power, Burebista had 200,000 soldiers, although somewhat later the Dacians' military strength was estimated at no more than 40,000. The late ruler's domain was divided into five, then four parts. At the center of that domain, Decaineus managed for a time to rule over Burebista's tribe; the merging of the roles of king and high priest was probably made permanent by his successor, a certain Comosicus. The kingdom over which ruled monarchs from Burebista to Decebalus obviously encompasses the {1-49.} central territory, which lay in southwest Transylvania; the other Dacian or Getian kings mentioned during the reign of Augustus ruled over the isolated Getian tribes on the lower reaches of the Danube. Identification of the actual Dacian kingdom's rulers is not without problems, for the commonly cited list names Comosicus as successor to Burebista and Decaineus but ignores Cotiso; yet the latter is identified in a number of sources as the Dacian who ruled over the region around the Iron Gate, the Danube's mountainous gorge. Since there are other misspellings in the list, it may be that Comosicus and Cotiso are one and the same; in any case, all sources agree that the latter ruled over the central part of Burebista's onetime kingdom.
Of the fragments of Burebista's domain, only the one within the Carpathians, in Transylvania, can be considered a Dacian kingdom, for the rest encompassed Getian tribes. Sources indicate that a king named Dicomes ruled over

one of those regions; he kept in touch with Mark Antony in the turbulent period following Caesar's death and offered him help before the Battle of Actium. Cotiso, meanwhile, tried to court favour with Octavian — at least according to Antony, who charged that Octavian even considered linking the two families by marriage. Other Getian or Dacian kings tried to sell their support to one or the other of the Roman factions. Such farflung diplomatic initiatives were uncommon among Barbarian peoples at the time, but each of these kings considered himself to be Burebista's legitimate successor and sought foreign help to realize his hegemonic ambitions. The reality of this struggle for hegemony is attested by the fact that the empire's five fragments were soon reduced to four; presumably a king had succeeded in eliminating one of his fellows. In these circumstances, the Dacian menace continued to worry the Romans even after Caesar's death. Octavian wanted to wage war on the Dacians in fulfilment of Caesar's intentions, although the timeliness and feasibility of such action became increasingly doubtful. Even the Iapodic war (35–33 B.C.) was {1-50.} launched on the pretext of preparing for a Dacian war, whereas its real objective control over the hinterland of coastal link along the Adriatic between Italy and the Balkans. One tangible gain was the town of Siscia (Sisak), in the Sava river valley; Octavian claimed that it would serve as an important base for a war against the Dacians.
The bellicose project faded as Caesar's successors intensified their struggle for undivided power, and in later years Rome's other concerns took precedence over a Dacian menace that was declining. Thus Rome contented itself with driving Cotiso out of his domains south of the Danube. The campaign was launched in 29 B.C., shortly after Octavian's victory at Actium. In the first phase of Balkan war that lasted several years, M. Licinius Crassus defeated Cotiso, who nevertheless hung on to the left bank of the Danube and probably continued to rule for some time over the heart of Burebista's kingdom.
Augustus' drive to the Danube threatened the Dacians, but Rome confronted them only later, in the context of a vast military and diplomatic operation aimed at stabilizing the political situation north of the Danube. In the first phase, the Romans occupied two regions south of the Danube, Pannonia and Noricum; formed a Moesian army in Macedonia; and prepared to extend their influence west of the Danube. In 10 B.C., during the Pannonian campaign, the Dacians had launched an attack across the Danube, and were repulsed. In retaliation, Augustus dispatched an army that 'compelled the Dacians to submit to the rule of Rome'.[10] The commander was probably M. Vinicius; it is recorded that in one of his campaigns, he had defeated an army of Dacians and Bastarnae, and then compelled the Celtic peoples living on the northern flank of the Great Hungarian Plain to join the Romans in 'alliance'.[11] This northward thrust across the Great Plain probably coincided with Lentulus' campaign, in which 'a people difficult to reach' — the Dacians — were drive out of their highland homes, and north of the {1-51.} Danube; the Romans then established military outposts along the right bank of the river. One source notes that although this operation 'did not defeat Dacia, it kept that power distant'.[12] Of the subsequent Roman campaigns, only a few details survive, e.g., that Roman soldiers sailed up the Tisza and the Maros rivers to reach the Dacians. A poet's comment, that Dacia's Appuli tribe (presumably people in the region of Apulum [Gyulafehérvár]) lived within early reach of the Pontus, must have been prompted by some event. In fact, this is the only surviving indication that the Dacians sought to make contact after Burebista's death with people in the lower reaches of the Danube. The shortest route from Apulum to the Black Sea lies along the Olt valley; and it is hardly coincidental that Augustus, who saw no necessity in militarizing the new frontier on the Danube, chose a spot near the mouth of the Olt to establish one of the first Roman military camps in the Danubian region (Oescus-Gigen). The second camp (Carnuntum-Deutschaltenburg), probably also established during Augustus' reign, lay near the lands of Rome's other dangerous opponent in the Danubian region, the German king Maroboduus. All this indicates that despite the fragmentation and territorial losses suffered after Burebista's death, the Dacian kingdom remained one of the better-organized — as well as less accessible — political units in the region.
In these circumstances, the Romans, who had barely consolidated their positions on the Danube, must have welcomed the gradual advance of two tribes of Sarmatian horsemen along the lower reaches of the river. The Jazyges, closely followed by the Roxolani, drove a wedge between not only the Getae and the Dacians, but also the Roman empire and the Dacians; moving westward, they came to serve as a buffer between Pannonia and the Dacians. The main body of Jazyges reached the northeastern part of the Great Plain in first decade A.D., expelling Dacians who had settled there in the time of Burebista. It is possible that the Sarmatian migration — which Rome may have sporadically encouraged — was a factor in {1-52.} Dacian incursions of varying scale, and that some of those were joint Dacian-Sarmatian operations. Already in Augustus' time, the Romans had resorted to resettlement measures in an attempt to pacify the region north of the Danube; to make way for the Sarmatians, they moved large

numbers of Getae (or Dacians?) to Moesia. The turbulence took long to dissipate, for Sarmatians and Dacians were warring in Moesia even towards the end of Tiberius' reign. The subsequent period of peace coincided — according to the list of kings noted earlier — with the forty-year reign of the Dacian ruler Coryllus.
Since Coryllus is not mentioned in any other source, it is probably a misspelling of Scorilo, a relatively common Dacian name. An anecdote has survived about a Dacian king called Scorilo: To dissuade his people from meddling with the Romans, he set two dogs fighting, then introduced a wolf, whereupon the dogs joined forces to attack the wolf.[13] Such prudence must have been characteristic of the long reign of Coryllus-Scorilo; the example of the dogs was certainly apposite during the Roman empire's first great crisis (68–69 A.D.), when legions left the Danube frontier unguarded to join in the civil war. The Sarmatians repeatedly exploited this situation, annihilating several Roman legions and even governors. On one occasion, probably in the winter of 68–69, the Dacians, too, crossed the Danube into Moesia, where they seized a few Roman camps along the border. It is not known if this raid was mounted by Scorilo or by some independent Dacian group. If the attribution of the dog anecdote is valid, it is more likely that the attack was launched by some Dacians from Wallachia, and that it served as the stimulus for Coryllus/Scorilo's cautionary stratagem.
In reference to the raid, Tacitus noted that the Dacians were 'always unreliable'.[14] Admittedly, his observation also drew on subsequent experience of Roman-Dacian clashes, but the Romans had been wary of the Dacians since the time of Burebista. Their strategy of forging alliances (in which the 'allies' were actually {1-53.} client states) was generally successful, but the Dacian kingdom proved less tractable. It is reported that, towards the end of Augustus' reign, the Dacians had become less menacing and more ready to accept Rome's supremacy — presumably a reference to the relatively peaceable relations in the time of Scorilo. It seems, however, that the Roman-Dacian alliance (foedus) lacked a solid foundation. Dacia differed in several respects from the German and Sarmatian client states along Rome's Danubian frontier. For one thing, the Dacians were favoured by geography, for high mountain ranges impeded access to their kingdom's heartland from the direction of the Danube. Rome's armies had to make long detours along the Maros or Temes valleys in the west, and the Olt or Zsil valleys in the east; in either case, they confronted easily-defended narrows and passes. Thus tactical advantage lay with the Dacians, and particularly so at a key stretch of the imperial frontier, where the Danube passes through a narrow gorge at the southern extremity of the Carpathians. There, a road had to be cut into the cliff face to serve as a towpath for shipping; this, one of the great engineering feats of Antiquity, was completed towards the end of Tiberius' reign. It is probably not coincidental that Daco-Roman relations took a peaceful turn at this juncture. Rome must have resorted to bribing the Dacians in order to keep this fluvial route secure.
Rome had to take into account not only Dacia's geographical defences but also the strong central organization of the kingdom. The 'royal' fortress on the heights of Sarmizegethusa, in the western Kudzsir Alps, was surrounded a ring of hilltop forts, and thus the center of power was easily defensible even against attack from the kingdom's outlying regions. These forts not only served as accommodation for troops but also as industrial centres, storehouses, treasuries and even shrines. The fortified emplacements, which covered several hectares, were protected by earthworks and generally had thick walls as well as towers; they served not only military purposes, but also as treasuries, industrial centres, warehouses, and {1-54.} even shrines. The ruler's ability to marshall great manpower is best attested by fortresses's walls, built of huge stone blocks on timber frames, by the paved yards and roads, stone steps, and by the drains hewn out of the rock. All this no doubt also served to make an impression on the ordinary folk, who lived in primitive conditions; a function that must not be underrated, for the great social gap between the 'capped' and 'long-haired' people probably necessitated an awesome display of kingly might.
Religion also served to buttress the monarch's authority and power. Religious sites include the fortresses and the more recently discovered shrines. The latter come in two shapes: round ones, marked by evenly laid stones, which probably also served as calendars, and quadrangular ones enclosed by four peristyles. All indications are that the cults had an astrological dimension. According to ancient sources, these cults originated with the Thracian Zalmoxis or Zamolxis, who was said to be a disciple of Pythagoras. The teachings of the legendary, deified Zalmoxis encompassed an ascetic way of life. This religion of Thraco-Getian origin was probably introduced by Decaineus, who had been invited by Burebista and became the latter's closest advisor. Burebista presumably perceived the potential utility of the cult and exploited it to consolidate his authority. To serve the cult was a privilege, and the priests were the guardians of its mystical truth; the head priest served in effect as mediator between the king and the transcendent sphere. The priestly privileges may well have included healing functions.

The fact that ancient Greek treatises on medicine mention many Dacian medicinal herbs, along with their Dacian names, points to a high level of botanical and medical knowledge, and it can be surmised that the experience of sheep-rearing in a mountain environment contributed to the Dacians' knowledge.
The excavation of Dacian fortresses has uncovered not only locally produced objects but also Roman ones. Some of the latter are luxury goods that are commonly found beyond the frontiers of {1-55.} the Roman empire amidst the belongings of Barbarian leaders. It is noteworthy, however, that the goods of Roman origin include not only those attributable to a tribal aristocracy, but also high quality iron tools that probably served advanced crafts practiced in the fortresses. It is also probable that the Dacians had recruited Greek and Roman experts to design the fortifications. Some of the ashlars that have been unearthed, most commonly those from shrines, bear incised, Greek characters that were probably intended to guide the sequence of assembly; others may be linked to the calendar function of the shrines. Latin-character sealmarks bearing a remarkable similarity to those on Roman bricks were found on a huge, inverse conical dish which was probably used in religious functions: one seal reads DECEBALUS, and the other PER SCORILO.
Most Romanian experts interpret these two sealmarks to mean 'Decebalus, son of Scorilo'. The problem with this interpretation is that the names figure on separate sealmarks, as if one was the owner who commissioned the object, and the other, the artisan who produced it. It is likely that the first name refers to King Decebalus, although the omission of 'rex' (king) is puzzling. However, if the interpretation 'Decebalus, son of Scorilo' is taken literally, then a further problem arises, which is that another reign, that of Diurpaneus, came between those of Scorilo and Decebalus. The Dacians' new political orientation, that which led to the demise of the Dacian monarchy after the golden era of Decebalus, is generally ascribed to the same Diurpaneus.
As noted, Scorilo found acceptable the associated relationship (foedus) that Rome tried to establish with neighbours all along the European borders of the empire. He may have been motivated by the exceptionally high annual stipendium that he received from Tiberius after the construction of the road along the Danube at the Iron Gate. According to a historian, the late Count Jordanes, King Diurpaneus only launched his attacks across the borders of the Roman empire when the Dacians, 'after a long wait, grew wary of {1-56.} the greed of the reigning emperor Domitian and renounced the contract that they had concluded with earlier emperors.'[15] Domitian may well have wished to reduce the exorbitant stipend, but it is hardly likely that he would have done so at a time when the Danubian Germans were preparing for war. It is more plausible that the Dacians timed their devastating surprise attack to exploit the tense situation on the German front.
The Dacian attack must have occurred no later than the winter of 85–86 A.D., and probably across a frozen Danube, as they had done in earlier raids. Oppius Sabinus, proconsul of Moesia, was one casualty of the surprise attack, which led to the capture of several settlements on the Moesian shoreline. The gravity of the situation is attested by the fact that Domitian rushed to Moesia and spent months preparing a retaliatory campaign. The operation was entrusted to Cornelius Fuscus, commander of the Praetorian Guard, who crossed the Danube and advanced steadily into Dacian territory. At this critical moment, Diurpaneus abdicated in favour of Decebalus, who started his reign by inflicting a crushing defeat on Fuscus' army in 87 A.D. Fuscus was killed in battle, and there were so many casualties that the Romans had to write off an entire legion. The third Roman to take charge of the campaign, Tettius Iulianus, finally managed in 88 A.D. to inflict a decisive defeat on the Dacians at Tapae, a mountain pass on the way to the royal capital.
It is difficult to discern, on the basis of the fragmentary evidence, the extent to which Daco-Roman relations were altered by the peace treaty and the new alliance concluded in 88 A.D. Roman historians, hostile to Domitian, regarded the peace terms as a victory for Decebalus: a sizeable stipend, and Roman experts whose knowledge he was evidently free to exploit for warlike as well as for peaceful ends. On the other hand, after the victory but before the peace treaty was concluded, a legion could already march unhindered 'across the kingdom of Decebalus' on its way to the German {1-57.} front on the Great Plain.[16] Moreover, Decebalus had proposed peace on several occasions before his defeat at Tapae, at a time when it was hardly in Domitian's interest to prolong the war, given the growing problems with the Germans.
Nor did Decebalus take advantage of the Romans' difficulties subsequently, when Domitian was drawn into prolonged warfare in Pannonia with the Germans and the Sarmatians. In all likelihood, his ambitions were satisfied by the peace terms. He did not participate in the peace talks himself but sent an envoy, Diegis (possibly his

brother); it is upon the latter's head that Domitian placed the diadem symbolizing the powers of a subordinate ruler.
The time of construction of the Dacian fortresses has yet to be ascertained. It is quite possible that at least some of the stone walls and towers date from Decebalus, for it is during his reign that Roman experts were made available to direct such projects. It might well have been a Roman military engineer who produced the seal bearing the name of Decebalus, in the form of a stamp used by the Roman army's brickmakers. The roof-tiles of the fortresses also suggest the presence of Roman architects.
While maintaining his alliance with the Romans, Decebalus significantly enlarged the territory of his kingdom in the decade following the peace treaty. The Romans tolerated such expansion, as long as it respected the foedus system, i.e., did not put at risk the agreements with other kings and the network of client states which had been so painstakingly constructed. The best indication of Decebalus's territorial gains is probably found in Ptolemy's geographical manual. The latter was written well after the conquest of Dacia, but the borders it describes are not those of the Roman province; and although, in reference to many provinces, it mentions the presence of Roman legions, it fails to do so in the case of Dacia. Moreover, since Ptolemy calls Sarmizegethusa 'royal', he must be referring not to the Roman colony established at Várhely but to the royal castle near Grădiştea Muncelului. According to Ptolemy, {1-58.} Decebalus' Dacia was bounded in the west by Tisza River, in the north by the Carpathians, and in the east by the Dniester River. This immense territory, the greater part of which was inhabited by Celtic, Sarmatian and other peoples as well as the Dacians, must have been conquered progressively, and not without bloodshed. Ptolemy lists the peoples under Decebalus' rule, though in a manner that makes it hard to identify their precise location. Other sources confirm that the northernmost regions were inhabited by the Celtic Anartae and Taurisci — peoples of the former Boian alliance living in northern Transylvania —, and the Thracianspeaking Costoboces who lived beyond the Carpathians. The other groups noted by Ptolemy are not mentioned in other sources; among them, a significant number bear the name of settlements (Predavenses, Ratakenses, Kaukoenses, Buridavenses, etc.). Since these groups were located at the center of the Ptolemaic map, one possibility is that Decebalus divided the people of Dacia into territorial units, each with its administrative center, thus erasing the traditional tribal delineations; it is significant that the one Dacian tribe previously identified, the Appuli, do not appear on Ptolemy's list even under the name of Apulenses, derived from the locality of Apulum. In this case, the structure of Decebalus' kingdom differed little from that of the conqueror Burebista, who had amalgamated a number of tribes and peoples; as noted, the latter kingdom was reduced after Burebista's death to its central region, which reached from the Maros to the Danube, and from the Banat to the Olt.
Trajan probably did not need Decebalus's conquests to convince himself that the Dacian kingdom should be eliminated. As for Decebalus, his style of statesmanship makes it unlikely that he ever entertained ambitions to conquer parts of the Roman empire; after the peace treaty, he avoided any action that might have jeopardized his relations with the Romans. Yet there are indications that in the years following Domitian's death, the Romans were already preparing for a showdown with the Dacians. Trajan initially concentrated {1-59.} on forging alliances with the Danubian Germans, and then, in the fourth year of his reign, moved against the Dacians.
There were numerous factors favouring a showdown: The already excessive stipend might have to be raised again; the terms of Domitian's treaty were difficult to sustain; further expansion of Dacia would threaten the alliance network along the Danube; the Dacians might resort to diplomatic blackmail; opposition elements were mobilizing in Decebalus's realm; and the security of navigation on the Danube had to be assured. The only trouble spot along the Danube that Rome was unable to neutralize permanently with money and diplomacy was the Dacian kingdom.
Few details survive concerning the two short but bloody campaigns, in 101–102 and 105–106, by which Rome conquered Dacia. A commemorative monument, Trajan's column, does bear an ascending, serpentine relief that evokes the war, but no amount of expert analysis has succeeded in translating this into a plausible account of the historical highlights. Trajan had marshalled considerable military force in the two campaigns, and these armies advanced on the Dacian capital from several directions, along the river valleys and through mountain passes. In the first war, the Romans, having reached the fortresses, forced their opponents to make a stand, and defeated them. Trajan stationed garrisons in the fortresses and laid down peace terms that spelled the political demise of the Dacian kingdom and aimed at a final solution to the Dacian problem: disarmament and the surrender of weapons; demolition of the fortresses; surrender of the territories annexed by Decebalus; the release of refugees; and loyalty, or indeed passivity in foreign policy. After this victory, the Romans built the first permanent bridge over the

Danube, at Drobeta (Turnu-Severin); it allowed assured access to the territory of what was considered a defunct kingdom. Although, during this first war, Decebalus had shown a disposition to negotiate, after defeat he turned obdurate and prepared to continue the struggle. He rebuilt his forces, sought {1-60.} help from neighbouring peoples, and retook some of the lost territories; he even tried blackmail, taking as hostage a Roman officer who had come at his invitation to parlay.
The second Roman expedition ran into a well-planned counterattack led by Decebalus, who was determined to fight to the last. Nevertheless, the fortresses fell to the Romans in the spring of 106. If the triumphant reliefs on Trajan's column are to be believed, suicides, beheadings, precipitous flight, and attempts to parlay marked the disintegration of the ruling elite of 'capped ones'. Hunted down by the Roman cavalry, probably in eastern Transylvania, Decebalus took his own life; his head was brought back to Trajan.
With the demise of the kingdom, Dacian society also fell apart. Some of the common folk emigrated, and of those who remained, some were taken into slavery. The rigidly stratified society's highest caste, the 'capped ones', were decimated, and the survivors lost their status. The priesthood's authority vanished along with the kingdom; there is no surviving trace of a Dacian religion during the Roman period. Those Dacians who remained in place had great difficulty in becoming integrated into the society of a Roman province. In other conquered lands, the Romans could work with the only interlocutors that they were prepared to acknowledge, the aristocracy; but in Dacia, the aristocrats had disappeared, leaving the people without representation. It was this social vacuum, as well as the loss of population, that prompted Trajan and his successors to encourage people from other parts of the empire to settle in conquered Dacia.

II. FROM DACIA TO ERDŐELVE: TRANSYLVANIA IN THE PERIOD OF THE GREAT MIGRATIONS (271-896) (István Bóna)
The Fate of the Population after the Withdrawal
Sources are consistent regarding the evacuation and surrender of Dacia. In Eutropius' representative account, 'the province of Dacia, established by Trajan on the far side of the Danube, was evacuated and abandoned by Aurelianus after the devastation of Illyria and Moesia. The Romans were resettled from the towns and land of Dacia to the middle of Moesia, which he renamed Dacia. It separates the two Moesiae, and after standing on the left of the Danube, it now stands on the right'.[63] Is it conceivable that despite Eutropius' testimony, a sizeable number of Latin-speaking citizens remained in the province abandoned by Rome, survived the era of great migrations, and became the ancestors of a neo-Latin people?
This hypothesis would be plausible if historical and demographic conditions at the end of the 3rd century made the resettlement impossible or unverifiable; and if it could be established that after 271, there remained in the original province a large population of Latin-speakers, of citizens who had reached the highest level of Romanization. The size of this hypothetical population is critical, for 130–150 years later, after the collapse of Roman administration and military defence in their respective provinces, the Latin-speaking masses of the middle Danubian region were overwhelmed by the waves of the great migration; this happened sooner in the case of northeastern Pannonia, and later in western and southern {1-123.} Pannonia, Raetia, and parts of Noricum. Those who failed to flee in time eventually blended in with the successive newcomers or were swept away. No neo-Latin people emerged from the maelstrom, and this in spite of the fact that historical circumstances (including a society made homogeneous by four centuries of Romanization) and the natural setting were much more favourable than in the case of a Transylvania encircled by Barbarians. That region enjoyed no peace after the Romans' early withdrawal, for it continued to be harassed by the Carpi, Sarmatians, Vandals, and Gepids.
In considering the possibility that a Latin-speaking people survived in Dacia, one must examine the circumstances that might have facilitated the emergence of neo-Latin peoples in the other, more westerly provinces. It is important to note that Dacia was surrendered in deliberate and organized fashion, at a time when the empire still had solid foundations, and not in the midst a great crisis. The neo-Latin peoples that eventually emerged in Rome's onetime possessions did so 130–150 years later, after the fall of the empire. Even in these lands, the degree to which a Latin culture was preserved varied widely, notably between the middle Danubian provinces, and the western provinces or the coastal strip on the Adriatic. In the western border provinces of the empire, the Barbarians drove away most of the inhabitants in the early years of the 5th century and settled down. The new conquerors became either the ancestors of nationalities that exist to this day (in the case of Germania), or blended over time with the local population to form new nations: such was the case with the Ostrogoths and Lombards in Italy, the Visigoths in Spain, and the Franks in Gaul. There was little mixing at first between followers of the Nicene Creed and the Germans, who were either pagan or attached to Arianism, but once the conquerors converted or took baptism, there remained little hindrance to social integration. Thus these various tribal and ethnic groups evolved with little difficulty into territorially-organized feudal societies.
{1-124.} In the former empire's territories in western and southern Europe, a certain continuity prevailed once the conquerors had settled down. The situation in the Danubian provinces and the Carpathian Basin was radically different. There, the same peoples who later established states in the west or in Africa made only brief stays; they progressively eliminated the remnants of Roman culture, but neither settled nor founded states. Whether of not some Romanized inhabitants stayed behind in Dacia, this destructive process had begun in the province some 130150 years earlier.
There was another factor that assisted in the survival of provincial populations in the west European and middle Danubian regions. With the collapse of Roman administration, Christianity — both its institutions and its creed remained as the only source of social cohesion. With its promise of salvation in the afterlife, the Church brought no small comfort to people suffering through the vicissitudes of the 5th–7th centuries. The Church's task was

facilitated by an organizational structure that was fully developed by the 4th century and which quickly spread to the provinces. The integration of church and state administration was already under way when the administration of the Roman empire began to lose its grip and its ability to defend the towns, which were the fountainheads of Romanization. The Church stepped into the breach as bishoprics supplanted Rome's urban administration; the universality of the Christian creed compensated for territorial fragmentation. The bishops thus assumed a leading role, organizing defence and negotiating with the conquerors. However, the bishoprics had been established and granted privileges within the empire as it existed in the 4th century, and thus Dacia, which had been surrendered in 271, could not benefit from these defenders of Roman culture.
To recapitulate, many circumstances conspired to impede the survival of Latin culture in Dacia, even in the eventuality that fragments of the provincial society stayed in place. This border province jutted deep into Barbaricum and was connected by only a {1-125.} narrow strip to the Latin-speaking part of the empire. It was exposed to the storm of the great migrations at least 130 years earlier than Rome's other possessions. As the distance increased from the center, less and less of Latin culture survived. Dacia lay on the easternmost fringe of this sphere, or, indeed, beyond it, separated as it was from the Romanized Dalmatian coast by territories where Greek, then Slavic language predominated. And it had no organized Church to rally and defend its people.
Rome effected an organized withdrawal from the province at a time when she had brought the Goths' long advance to a halt in the northern Balkans; there a safe haven awaited Dacia's people. The curtailment of anarchy at the end of the 3rd century and greater domestic stability may not have impressed the peoples of the far-flung empire, but the end of Goth attacks on Moesia was a palpable success and indicated the possibility of effective defence. Battles south of the Danube had decimated the population, creating ample room for large-scale resettlement. Eutropius recorded that Dacia was evacuated not only because it was no longer possible to defend it, but also because Illyria and Moesia had been devastated. At least in Illyria, war was not the sole cause of depopulation in the 250s; Zosimus[64] records that 'a terrible epidemic of pestilence broke out in the town, such as never before witnessed: it surpassed the devastation wrought by the Barbarians, to the point that towns occupied and sacked by them felt fortunate to have escaped the fate of those infected by the plague.' The population losses were so great that in neighbouring Thrace, the Romans were actively promoting new settlement as late as the 4th century. Thus the relocation of Dacia's reduced population was not only feasible but also coincided with the need to repopulate the Balkans. Rome must have been pleased that for once it could resettle its own citizens, and not Barbarians.
To test the credibility of Eutropius, one can also ask whether Dacia's population welcomed the prospect of resettlement. To be {1-126.} sure, they were in no position to block execution of the policy. Soldiers and their families, who made up a significant part of the population, had no choice; the former left with their units, and the latter followed. The empire, suffering from depopulation, was hungry for people, but the evacuation of Dacia was not accomplished by force. The province's inhabitants, and particularly its Latin-speaking Roman citizens, had no interest in remaining in an undefended territory, exposed to the depredations of the Barbarians and doomed to sink to the level of their conquerors. At the beginning of the 5th century, when the empire was already disintegrating, people in the other provinces spontaneously fled southward, although they had little expectation of finding security and new homes. For Dacia's Roman citizens, who spoke Latin, Greek, and perhaps Syrian, staying put was hardly an attractive alternative when they could move a short distance across the Danube to a secure and civilized new home. The sources indicate a pattern of behaviour that is the very opposite. The free Dacians asked to settle in the empire on two occasions at the end of the 2nd century, and following the Marcomanni wars, two groups, one of unknown number, the other 12,000-strong, received the necessary permission. Although they could not have been Romanized in the mere 50–60 years that had elapsed since their settlement in the empire, now, with the Goths nearby, they were not likely to insist on remaining in the abandoned province. Ever since the 2nd century, the peoples on the periphery had regarded the empire as a prosperous and well-guarded haven, and one tribe after the other begged for permission to settle there. Nor was the empire's attractiveness diminished by wars and anarchy in the middle of the 3rd century; the Marcomanni were resettled under Gallienus, and so were the Dacianized Carpi in 295, despite the fact that they had earlier raided Dacia.[65]
The narrative sources give a uniform account of Dacia's surrender and of its population's resettlement. The evacuation and resettlement of Roman citizens was well within the capacities of {1-127.} Rome's efficient administration. Although many civilians fled earlier, the evacuation could not have been accomplished overnight, and while there is no evidence to show this, it is just possible that some of the inhabitants stayed behind. For all the

reasons noted, their numbers could not have been significant.
From the 250s onward, epigraphs raised by citizens grow scarce, and remain so for a long time. There is, however, one indication that resettlement could be traced through epigraphic finds. The new Dacian capital, Serdica, was in a previously Greek-language region, yet a large proportion of the epigraphs found there, and dated from the 4th century, are in Latin. A plausible explanation is the influence of Latin-speaking people who had been resettled from Dacia.
Cemeteries are a good guide to the history of a region, to change and continuity in its settlements. When a settlement's life was interrupted, whether for reasons of extermination, emigration, or flight, there would be no more burials. The cessation of burials — signifying the extinction of a settlement — can be dated with some precision in the Roman era on the basis of grave goods, such as apparel, household objects, and coins. If, despite the written evidence, provincials stayed behind in Dacia, then finds in the cemeteries of Roman towns, rural settlements, and military camps should indicate burials beyond the 270s. Setting aside individual graves and small portions of cemeteries as being unsuited to such analysis, one finds only one wholly excavated town cemetery, at Romula; and there, burials evidently ceased in the second third of the 3rd century. The cemeteries at Napoca, Apulum, and Potaissa, and those at military camps have yet to be excavated.
Roman coins, minted after 271, are commonly cited as evidence of the provincial population's continued presence, as are finds of clear or supposed Christian character. However, none of these finds demonstrate the validity of the hypothesis.
{1-128.} The finds in Dacia of Roman coins identified with the second half of the 3rd century are exceedingly few; the incidence of coins rises only in the 4th century. This type of find offers no proof of the survival of the earlier population, either in Transylvania or in the Banat. Such money circulated outside the empire, in Barbaricum, in amounts that varied according to historical circumstance. Roman coins circulated in the Sarmatian-settled areas of the Great Hungarian Plain and the Banat, and finds of such coins do not prove that the grandsons of onetime Dacian provincials engaged in commerce, nor that the Banat was part of the Dacian province and therefore of the empire. The traffic of coins in Barbaricum reflects a different historical process. The coin finds in the former province of Dacia and in the Banat are distributed unevenly, the dividing line being an earthwork, raised in the 4th century, that ran north-south across the Great Hungarian Plain. The explanation is found in the history of the Sarmatians. The coins found in those parts of the Banat and Transylvania west of the earthwork are evenly distributed; their traffic, as on the Great Hungarian Plain, reached a peak in the 360s and 370s. The traffic of coins in the rest of Transylvania presents a different picture, though it is similar to that in other regions beyond the borders of the empire, for example in Slovakia: it reached a peak in the middle of the 4th century, then another during the reign of Valentinian I. This is may be considered the normal pattern in the Carpathian Basin during the 4th century. The coins found in Transylvania prove only one thing: that the region's population, depleted by the Roman withdrawal, eventually started to grown again, if only at a modest rate.
Most of the fifteen Christian finds are of uncertain provenance or are incorrectly identified; only a biased analysis can attribute them unequivocally to surviving provincials. To be sure, after the empire collapsed, Christianity contributed greatly to the cultural survival of Romans in the western and southern parts of Rome's former domain, where the decisive factor was not religion itself but {1-129.} the Church's institutions, the bishoprics that were constituted in the 4th century. No such bishoprics were found based at Dacia's towns in the 3rd century. The finds of a Christian character therefore do not serve to prove the existence of Christian communities or bishoprics; they indicate, at best, the presence of individual Christian believers, who may well have been Christian Goths. These finds could have reached Transylvania thanks to trade or plunder by the Goths (Christian or not) who resided there in the 4th century; or, indeed, thanks to later collectors of Roman objects. The fortified posts found along the left bank of the Danube in the 4th century facilitated the transfer of such relics. Apart from the Berethalom finds, which can be plausibly attributed to the Goths, these objects are not linked to liturgical ceremony. In the final analysis, there is no proof that their original owners were Christians. The same conclusion can be drawn in the case of the finds at Tápiógyörgye (Pest county, Hungary) and Luciu (Ialomiţa county, Romania), and of the early Byzantine bronze lucernae found in the Barbaricum. Similarly, it cannot be assumed that the bronze hand of Jupiter Dolichenus, plundered in Dacia and subsequently unearthed in Ukraine, or the bronze statue of the goddess Victoria found at Akasztó (Bács-Kiskun county, Hungary) once belonged to Roman citizens or devotees of Roman

cults.
There is, apart from the ancient chronicles and archaeological finds, another source that can throw some light on changes in ethnic patterns, and that is toponymy. The names of settlements and rivers harbour clues to the geographical and ethnic distribution of the population. Such names reflect local culture, and their modification or alteration can be analyzed to reveal changes in the nature of a population. Toponymic changes generally do not coincide with ethnic change, for only rarely does an ethnic group disappear in its entirety. Where newcomers settle alongside the remnants of older-established ethnic groups, they will commonly preserve some of the earlier toponyms. Thus toponyms can be traced even where the {1-130.} people who gave rise to them have become assimilated or have disappeared. On the other hand, if the population of a region remains in place after the arrival of new settlers, at least some of the earlier toponyms will survive.
Toponymic change indicates the arrival and settlement of new inhabitants. The scale of ethnic change will influence the degree to which toponyms are modified, as will differences in the culture and social organization of the ethnic groups. In larger territories, there seldom occurs a wholesale change in geographical names. Parts of the banks of longer rivers have been inhabited without interruption, and thus the names of the waterways — such as the Elbe, Rhine, Danube, Tisza, Drava, Sava, and Maros — are preserved through the centuries. The scrutiny of toponyms is of particular utility when one examines the period following the breakup of the Roman empire, which suffers from a dearth of alternative sources. In regions where there remained a sizeable Roman population — that is, in what became the neo-Latin countries — many Roman place- and river-names survive to this day, subject of course to linguistic adaptation. In other regions, where the Roman population was depleted and joined by new settlers, there was greater change in toponyms. The change was even greater in places where the earlier population largely or totally disappeared. Prolonged cohabitation served to preserve some old toponyms, while recurrent ethnic transformation brought with it more rapid toponymic modification and replacement.
In the 5th century, after the breakup of the empire, the Roman population of Raetia, Noricum, and Pannonia soon changed in number and character due to emigration and assimilation, and thus relatively few of the earlier toponyms were preserved; yet in some regions where the provincials disappeared early, a few Roman toponyms survive to this day. In northeastern Pannonia, where there were several wholesale changes in population, no Roman place-names survive. On the other hand, between the Drava and the Sava {1-131.} and in western Pannonia, numerous river names (e.g. Rába < Arrabo, Marcal < Mursella, Zala < Sala, Zöbernbach < Sevira < Savaria, Mura < Mura) as well as place-names (Vienna < Vindobona, Ptuj/Pettau < Poetovio, Sisak/Sziszek < Siscia) bear a Roman imprint; the Szerémség (the triangle between the Drava and the Sava rivers, northwest of Belgrade) carried over the Roman toponym Sirmium, and the town of Mitrovica bears the name of that settlement's Roman defender, Demetrius. The Roman name of Sopron (Hungary), Scarbantia, can be found in documents until at least the end of the 6th century. The name of Savaria is documented in 860 and in the Middle Ages, and as late as the 19th century it was in official use along with the Hungarian name of the locality, Szombathely. These toponyms survive in regions of Pannonia where there is no neo-Latin population, and where most of the Roman population had disappeared by the time of the Avars. Yet an early period of cohabitation and assimilation had facilitated the transmission and preservation of some place-names, and when the Hungarians arrived, they, too, adopted these names. It follows that if Roman names had survived in that other Roman province of the Carpathian basin, Transylvania, the Hungarians would have preserved them as well. Thus, if part or all of a Romanian ethnic group that spoke neo-Latin had lived in Transylvania, it could be expected that there — as in other neo-Latin countries many Roman toponyms would have survived.
To be sure, the names of certain major rivers betray a Roman origin. In the case of the Szamos (only the placename of Samum is known from Roman times) and the Maros (Marisus, Marisia), only a stretch of the rivers lies within Transylvania, and thus their names were not necessarily given by Dacia's inhabitants. Two northern tributaries of the Danube, the Olt (Alutus) and the Cserna (uncertain, probably from Dierna) preserve their Roman appellation; this probably owes to the fact that after the Romans evacuated Dacia, they and the Eastern Roman empire for several centuries maintained {1-132.} a foothold on the left bank of the Danube. Beyond this, and apart from the debatable origin of a few river names in central Dacia, no Roman toponyms survive in Transylvania. In no other Roman province did Roman toponyms suffer a similar fate, but their disappearance is consistent with the historical record concerning the evacuation of the province. (The Roman place names found in the Dacian region of today's Romania were attributed in modern times, in evocation of the Roman period.)

Apart from one exception, the isolated, 4th century cemetery at Baráthely, there is no evidence that any of the provincial population might have stayed behind after Aurelianus evacuated Dacia, and thus no reason to question the written records of the period. The extent of toponymic change confirms this wholesale withdrawal. Transylvania, Oltenia, and the Banat were touched by the Great Migrations some 130–150 years earlier than was Pannonia, and 150–200 years before the first settlements of Franks and Goths in the neo-Latin territories. The chances of survival for the former provincials during this long period of turbulence were slight. Relinquished in 271 by the empire, Dacia would remain excluded from the Romanized world.

Even before it was evacuated, Trajan's Dacia was effectively lost, because, as early as 248, attacks by the Goths and their allies were beginning to sever from the empire a territory that thrust deep into Barbaricum. Dacia's extinction is almost unfathomable, for it came about as a consequence of events that occurred south of the Danube, in today's Balkan peninsula.
The prelude to Dacia's disappearance was the arrival of the Goths and their allies on the coast of the Black Sea ca. 235; in the process, they ravaged the Greek-Roman settlements — including the walled stronghold of Deraclea at the mouths of the Dniester and Bug rivers. In 238, they broke through the Romans' defensive line on the lower Danube and sacked the city of Histrus (Histria) in Scythia Minor (today's Dobrudja).
Events took a disastrous turn when, in 248, the allied Goths, Carpi, and Taifal launched an offensive against Moesia. Within a year, they devastated the right bank of the lower Danube, reaching Iatrus (Arčar), Novae (Svistov), and — as attested by a coin hoard, dating from 250 and discovered at Sofronievo in 1970 — the valley of the Augusta (Ogosta) River, which flows northward into the lower Danube, in present-day northwestern Bulgaria. They thus began to threaten Dacia's road links, north of the Danube. Although Emperor Decius checked their advance on this front in 250, when the enemy turned southward, he could not prevent them from seizing Philippopolis (Plovdiv), the first major city to fall to the enemy. Its inhabitants were put to the sword or taken prisoner. The following year, Moesia's defences collapsed. For the first time, in the {1-140.} great battle fought against the Goths near Abrittus (May or June 251), a Roman emperor, Traianus Decius, was killed in action; another casualty was his son, Herennius Etruscus.
Following this victory, the enemy pressed forward to Thessaloniki. The Romans had to defend the pass at Thermopylae and fortify Athens (254). By 257–58 the Goths had captured Olbia and Tyras, two ancient Greek cities on the Black Sea; thereafter, the towns' industries crafted weapons for the Goths, and their ships became the Goths' armed fleet. As early as 258, the Gothic-Herulic fleet ravaged towns on the coasts of the Black Sea and Propontis (Sea of Marmara). The Aegean coast suffered similar attacks a few years later; hallowed Ilion (Troy) was put to the torch, as was (in 262) Ephesus, famous for its temple of Artemis. In 264, the Goths reached Galatia and Cappadocia, and Gothic pirates landed on Cyprus and Crete. In the process, the Goths seized enormous booty and took thousands into captivity. Among those captured were the maternal ancestors of Bishop Vulfila, the Goths' 'apostle'.
Dacia's fate was sealed when, in 268–69, the Goths launched another offensive in the Balkans. They reached Greece, sacking Athens, Corinth, and Sparta, then, loaded with booty, marched northward. Although in 269, at Naissus (Niš), the Goths suffered a severe defeat at the hands Emperor Claudius II 'Gothicus', they kept up the

pressure on the Romans' Danube line and, in 270, once again raided Dobrudja. By then, the Romans had withdrawn their forces from Dacia Superior, where the towns did not hold out for long against the invaders. Emperor Aurelian had little prospect of retaking the area north of the Carpathians; instead, he proceeded to evacuate troops and civilians from Dacia Inferior, known at the time as Dacia Transdanuviana, and today as the eastern Temesköz and Wallachia.
No details survive concerning the operations by which Carpi, Goths, Taifals, Gepids, and Vandals smashed the peripheral and internal defences of the Transylvanian part of Dacia, but the {1-141.} process must have begun around the end of Gordianus III's reign (238–244), when the province's inhabitants buried their coins, notably at PotaissaTorda, Cege, Domáld, and Lozsád. Another wave of panic must have struck shortly thereafter, from Mezőbánd to Kemenceszék, in Krassó-Severin county; the latest coins found in these areas were minted under Philippus II (247249). There is evidence of coins still circulated, at a reduced rate, during the reigns of Philippus Arabs I (244–249) and Decius (249–251); then the circulation virtually ceased. Between 268 and 271, the occupation of Dacia was completed with the capture of towns and a few inhabited forts, such as Sóvárad. Transylvania and the Romanian plain become Gutthiuda or, as the Romans called it, Gothia/ Gotia — 'the Goths' country'. Oltenia, the area between the Olt and Danube rivers, was occupied by the Goths' allies, the Taifals, after 270.
Having conquered Transylvania, the formerly united Gothic tribes divided into two groups. The Ostrogoths (austro = 'bright, shining, brilliant') settled east of the Dniester, as far as the Crimean Peninsula, while the Visigoths (vezu/vizu = 'good, brave, valiant') established themselves west of the Dniester. (The subsequent interpretation of the names as signifying eastern and western Goths is linguistically incorrect, even though it happens to reflect the pattern of settlement.) However, between 271 and 376, the two groups of Goths identified themselves by different names, which arose from their environment. Those living in the east were called Grutungi or Greutungi meaning 'lowlanders' — while those settled on the fringes of Transylvania and the southeastern Carpathians were known as Tervingi — 'forest people'. The latter must have acquired the name only after they settled in the Transylvanian-Carpathian region; it first appears in contemporary records in 291 ('Tervingi, pars alia Gothorum, adiuncta manu Taifalorum adversum Vandalos Gepidesque concurrant'[1]). Around that time, or a little earlier, the Tervingi and the Taifals had joined forces to repel Gepids and Vandals intent on seizing a share of formerly Roman Dacia.
{1-142.} The battles were waged on the territory of the former province, somewhere in the Szamos valley, for it is recorded that the Gepids and Taifals (led by Fastida) confronted the Tervingi-Taifal coalition (led by King Ostrogotha) near a town. Since there is no evidence of a Gothic settlement in the Gutthiuda larger than a village or fortified position, the reference in 'ad oppidum Galtis, iuxta quod currit fluvios Auha'[2] must be to a onetime Roman town. Notwithstanding much uninformed speculation, the identity of this town on the river 'Auha' (from the Gothic ahwa, meaning 'water, river') is unknown, and probably destined to remain so, for it is unlikely that new written sources will be discovered, and the original source (Ablabius' 'Origo Gothica) drew its information from legends in the Gothic language.
Up to 328, the main events of Visigothic-Roman history unfolded along the ripa gotica — 'the Gothic riverbank' on the lower Danube. This does not, however, put into question the existence of Goth settlements in Transylvania, notably in the Maros valley. In fact, during the reign of King Ariarik, the Goths of Transylvania advanced along the Maros in an attempt to drive the Sarmatians off the lowlands of the Temesköz. The Sarmatians turned for assistance to Constantine the Great, who sent a large Roman force led by his son, the future Constantius II. This army won a formidable victory over the Goths in Sarmatia on 18 February 332. Thousands of Goth warriors were captured, and an onerous and humiliating peace was imposed upon the Goth kings. This was probably the occasion when Vidigoia, 'the bravest Goth', was killed as a result of 'Sarmatian trickery'. The place where he fell, and perhaps his grave as well, were long remembered; in 449, when Priscos crossed the Temesköz on his way to Attila's 'capital', the 'ordu', his escort could still lead him to the historic spot.
However, the Goths did not give up the control of the Transylvanian entrance of the Maros valley. When, around 335, the army of the Vandal King Visumar tried to settle there, a force of {1-143.} Transylvanian Goths under the command of Geberik, son of Ovida, drove them away.
In 364 and 369, Emperor Valens launched attacks against the Tervingi from the lower Danube, but to little effect, for the iudex Athanarik withdrew not only his troops but also the rest of his people, partly to the wetlands of the

Danube Delta, partly to the 'Serrorum montes' (the Southern Carpathians), and, of course, to Southern Transylvania.
In the summer of 376, the Huns, after defeating the Greutungi, proceeded to crush the Tervingi Goths. They outflanked Athanarik's advance guard (commanded by Munderic), swam across the Dniester — which the Goths considered impassable — at nighttime, and, as dawn rose, they fell upon the Goth camp guarding the ford on the river. (Centuries later, the same brilliant 'nomad' tactic was employed by the Hungarians at Pozsony and by the Mongols at Muhi.) The result was a panic of a kind never recorded in world history until then. That autumn, the Visigoth tribes, commanded by Alavivus and Fritigern, crossed the Danube to seek refuge on Roman territory, while, following a succession of defeats, Athanarik and his retinue withdrew into the mountains. It is not clear whether the area known to the Goths as Kaukalanda (in Gothic: 'the country of mountains') includes all of the Carpathian highlands known to them, or only part of the highlands ('Caucalandensis locus'); but in both cases the name refers to Transylvania.
In the late autumn of 380 or 381, Athanarik and his escort were routed by an enemy force that is not identified in recorded history, but which, as will be seen, probably consisted of Gepids. Despite a 'vow' that he had proudly evoked as late as 369, Athanarik fled across the Danube to Roman territory; he reached Constantinople on 11 January 381, and died a few days later. Thus ended the rule of the 'woodland' Goths and the first 'post-Roman' phase of Transylvania's history.

{1-179.} 2. THE HUNS
Once they had earned their remarkable victory on the Dniester in the late summer of 376, the Huns chose not to pursue the shattered Visigothic forces as the latter fled towards the Lower Danube. They allowed both Athanaric's Goths and most of the followers of Alavivus and Fritigern to seek refuge across the Danube. To the Huns, the Visigoths' land must have seemed densely populated compared to the endless steppes that they had conquered in Eastern Europe. They waited until the Lower Danubian Plain, washed by broad rivers, had been evacuated by its inhabitants before they moved in. It was ideally suited to their nomadic, cattle-herding life and to serve as a base of military operations.
The first sizeable Hun army crossed the Lower Danube in 395 to launch raids into Moesia. Traces of their dwellings include copper cauldrons and rich graves of women wearing jewelled diadems. At Dulceanca, just beyond the Limes Transalutanus, the fragment of a diadem has been unearthed, along with the remains of a Mongoloid male whose skull had been purposely elongated, a feature that horrified Europeans; the isolated grave had been dug near the ruins of an abandoned Gothic settlement of the Marosszentanna type.
Apart from the diadems, the unmistakable signs of the first Hun invasion of Wallachia and Oltenia (which had been evacuated by the Taifals) are the copper cauldrons that have been found at Boşneagu. Hotărăni, Ioneşti, Desa, Celei, Hinova, and near Bucharest(?). When Uldin's Huns established their military headquarters in the former Dacia Inferior, there, as in other conquered Danubian regions, they chose former Roman towns located at major crossroads.
{1-180.} At first, Uldin tried to placate the Eastern Roman empire by scaring away or exterminating warring bands of Goths (thus the slaughter of Gaina and his followers in December 400), and he adopted a conciliatory attitude with regards to Western Roman rulers as well. Responding to Stilicho's appeal, he 'helped' to rout Radagaisus' disorderly forces at Fiesole in 406; in 408–409, he held in check the forces of Alaric I, who had set up quarters in Illyricum. Having already suffered a crushing defeat at hands of the Huns, the Visigoths had no choice but to lie low. Thus Wallachia and Oltenia acquired importance in international politics as the bases from which Hun armies would range as far as Italy, Pannonia, and Moesia.
The Germanic tribes living in the northern reaches of the Carpathian Basin felt less threatened by Uldin's occasional forays along the Sava River than by the bold (and unrecorded) advance of another Hun group. The latter swept northward around the Carpathians and made camp on the upper reaches of the Vistula and the Oder rivers. Their archaeological traces correspond in almost every detail to those found on the Romanian Plain. It was this invasion, coming from an unexpected direction, that caused the second 'Hun panic' sometime before 406. Vandals, Alans, and Quads (the latter being henceforth known by their tribal name of Svebs) fled in great numbers. This development had a lasting significance, for the Gepids remained the sole Germanic people in the Carpathian Basin; free of rivals, they could exercise absolute dominion east of the Tisza and in Transylvania.
In 409, the Huns came into open conflict with the Eastern Roman empire. Uldin's armies, made up of Huns and Skirs, laid siege to the Moesian stronghold of Castra Martis. Relations remained hostile between the Huns and the Eastern Roman empire until the very end — that is, until the death of Attila and his son Dengizik (469). Although in 410 the Huns withdrew to their quarters north of the Lower Danube, in the new state of war they could {1-181.} not tolerate the threatening proximity of Roman outposts along the left bank of the Danube; they annihilated Sucidava and the fortress at Hinova around 410–411.
Thus, at the beginning of the 5th century, the Huns had become exclusive masters of the lowlands between the Lower Danube and the southern Carpathians. By 412 at the latest, they had secured militarily the frontiers of their new domain. Archaeological evidence of the Hun occupation is sparse but unequivocal. The negative signs are perhaps even more conclusive: there are no traces of a settled population in the first half of the 5th century.

In 422, a great Hun army under the command of King Ruga crossed the Lower Danube and made a devastating incursion into Thrace. It appears that the Huns' first foray into Transylvania occurred when they occupied the Olt valley. The discovery at Brassó of a gold 'boot buckle' with garnet, typical of those worn by leading Huns, evokes the possibility that a nomadic Hun nobleman established summer residence in the area; a gold solidus of Theodosius II, minted in Thessaloniki, also discovered near Brassó, serves as indirect evidence of a Hun presence around 430.
In or around 425 (the year King Ruga lent a hand to Aetius in Italy), the Huns transferred their main base of activity to a part of the Hungarian Plain lying between the Tisza, Maros, and Körös rivers; it was probably from this base that Uptar launched his Burgundian campaign in 430. In 435, at the time of the Margus peace talks, Bleda and Attila travelled from the Temes region to meet with the Eastern Roman negotiators; in 440, Bleda crossed the Danube at Viminacium (Kosztolác) to attack Eastern Roman towns. After Ruga's death, and between 434 and 44445, the central ordu, situated in the middle of the region east of the Tisza, was Bleda's place of residence, and it later became the 'capital' of Attila's empire. Earlier, between 434 and 445, Attila's ordu had been situated somewhere between the Lower Danube and the southeastern Carpathians, in present-day Wallachia. There he {1182.} received the Eastern Roman emissaries, and it was from there that he launched his campaigns in 441.
In the autumn of 449, a mission led by Maximinus and Priskos travelled for two days beyond the Danube to meet Attila and his escort. On his way back from his summer residence on the upper reaches of the Maros, the Hun leader stopped over in the Temes region for a wedding. Attila then proceeded in a north-northwesterly direction to his ordu, where he was welcomed with much ceremony; the Western Roman and Eastern Roman delegations took a parallel route to the same destination.
The Transylvanian traces, dating from 425 to 455, of the Huns and their era are surprisingly few, and all lie in the lowlands of the Maros valley. The earliest find is an oriental ornament, the pure gold cicada discovered at Sáromberke; this unusual badge of honour was crafted on the northern shore of the Black Sea in the early 400s.
The most important testimonies to Hun rule and occupation are the two separate sets of coins discovered at Szászsebes, which presumably had been the site of a Hun ordu or aul. The first find yielded fourteen gold coins of the Kushan-Sasanid king Varahram (Bahram) V (420–438). They had been brought back by Huns in the 420s from their campaign in Asia Minor, and were subsequently buried, probably after King Bleda's fall, by a follower about to suffer the same fate. On the other hand, another solidus, minted in 429–430 under Theodosius II and bearing the inscription VOT XXX MVLT XXXXX, must come from an Eastern Roman 'peace tribute'; there may well have been more of these coins in the find, for a set of the same type of coin was found at Hódmezővásárhely-Szikáncs. The Theodosius II solidus, inscribed CONCORDIA AVGG, and found near the methane gasworks at Gyulafehérvár, dates from the same period. These two Eastern Roman gold coins confirm that the Huns understood the region's advantages in terms of communication, as did their Avar and Magyar successors. The {1183.} Huns' presence is also indicated by finds of coins of the Western Roman emperors: at Vizakna-Táborhegy, a solidus minted under Honorius (395–423), and at Marosludas, solidi of Valentinian III (425–455).
Typical Hun settlements and graves (which yielded grey jugs with smoothed decoration, vessels, and a glass) have been unearthed on the site of the chemical works and the brick factory in Marosvásárhely; they match Hun finds in other parts of the Carpathian Basin. Another Hun-type jug, with smoothed decoration, has been found at Maroskarna-Lunkatanya. More recently, a burial ground of common people, dating from the Hun period, was discovered at Újős — the first such find in the region. The site yielded engraved bronze fibulae (of the 'Perse-Léva' type) that help to date the find, as well as earrings ending in a compact polyhedral button; the deceased had been interred with their horses. Finally, a solid gold bracelet with expanded ends was discovered at Marosvásárhely; a remarkably similar ornament was retrieved from the grave of a Hun girl at Mezőberény.
Another interesting find is the laminated bronze fibula unearthed at Gyulafehérvár-Partos. It is of a Caucasian Alanic type dating from around 400, similar to some found in Pannonia, and attests to the presence in Transylvania of the Huns' earliest allies.
It is eminently likely that between the 420s and 455, Hun princes and notables established summer residences in Transylvania. Accompanied by their escorts and herds (on his encounter with Maximinus, Attila, who was coming from the east, sent the Roman emissary an ox for food), they would repair to the mountains, where part of their

time was spent hunting. Transylvanian settlement stood at its nadir during this period, for there are no traces of human presence on the most hospitable land, the river valleys; the only exceptions are the valleys of the Szamos and the Maros, and the road along the Olt. Transylvania's settled area shrank considerably; from this time until the 12th century, the area in the {1-184.} Transylvanian Basin and its valleys that was suitable for settlement or was occasionally populated scarcely surpassed the area of two counties (such as Pest and Bács-Kiskun) in present-day Hungary.

In the Battle of Mauriacum (formerly referred to in error as Catalaunum), 'also present, at the head of an immense army of Gepids, was Ardaric, the most famous king, who, thanks to his loyalty to Attila, could participate in the latter's councils. Attila, who possessed sharp judgement, preferred him to the other vassal kings; Ardaric had earned renown for his loyalty and sound counsel'.[9] Jordanes drew for this characterization from Cassiodorus' Gothic history, which was based in turn on data furnished by Priskos, who lived at the time of these events; to be sure, the Goths' historiographers had clumsily interpolated that the Ostrogothic King Valamir was also Attila's most 'preferred' vassal.
There is no doubt that, in 451, Ardaric — together with his Gepids — already stood 'at the Lord's right hand'. Their rise stemmed from their very defeat. The Huns had defeated and killed the royal family, whose authority had been shared with the tribal chiefs' council, as well as the most of the nobility, but they allowed ordinary Gepids to remain on their land in the valleys of the Upper Tisza, Bodrog, Ér, Kraszna, and Szamos. When the Huns' centre of power shifted to the Hungarian Plain, the Gepids were left as the sole significant compact group within the Hun sphere east of the Danube. With no other potential allies in the vicinity, the dominant Huns soon came to rely economically, politically, and militarily on the Gepids. The new king imposed on the Gepids, Ardaric, did not become the 'chief administrator' of a clan-based society, or the 'chairman' of the tribal chiefs' council, but a ruler whose power over his people was as absolute as that exercised by Attila over the notables and general population of his empire. This unlimited power was based neither on election nor on ascendance; it was simply {1-186.} bestowed upon Ardaric — and upon other vassal monarchs — by Attila and his Huns. The clever Ardaric was one of those who turned this power to their own people's advantage, a fact confirmed by the Gepidic finds from the Hun period.
When Attila died unexpectedly in 453, Ardaric and his army, which had gained experience in the campaigns against the two Roman empires, showed themselves to be masters of the situation. Ardaric saw his power imperilled by Attila's sons, who vied for the succession and fought for shares of the father's domain. Ardaric was the only vassal with the means to challenge Attila's son Ellák, and he drew in his wake the Svebs and the Rugians from the upper reaches of the Danube, as well as Edika's Skiris. The struggle was waged mainly by the 'furious sword-wielding Gepids (ense furens Gepida), and in the battle by the Nedao River, in 455, it was 'Ardaric's sword' (Ardarici gladius) that earned a decisive victory.
Following their victory, 'the Gepids forcibly occupied the Huns' land and conquered the entire Dacian territory. From this position of strength, they issued a demand to the Eastern Roman empire for no more than a friendly pact (of alliance), peace, and an annuity'.[10] The demands were granted, and, apart from two troubled decades in the middle of the 6th century, the Gepids served as external allies of the Eastern Roman empire.
Thus Dacia came under Gepidic domination as early as 455, and not, as archaeologists once believed thanks to a

superficial assessment of their finds, many decades later. This is clearly demonstrated not only by the account drawn from Priskos but also by the archaeological finds. The archaeologists had concluded erroneously that in Dacia, only the inner Transylvanian region that happened to yield relevant finds had been occupied by the Gepids. Yet the original written sources are unambiguous: the Gepids' military domination extended along the Lower Danube to the mouth of the Olt, and therefore it must have encompassed all of the former provinces of Dacia, including Dacia Inferior. According both to historical {1-187.} records and to Hun archaeological finds, Oltenia had been a 'Hun settlement area'. The account based on data from the contemporary Cassiodorus clearly defines the Gepidic borders in the first third of the 6th century: 'Scythia prima ab occidente gens residet Gepidarum, que magnis opinatisque ambitur fluminibus. Nam Tisia per aquilonem eius chorumque discurrit; ab africo vero magnus ipse Danubius, et ab eoo Flutausis secat, ...intorsis illis Dacia est, ad coronae speciem arduis Alpibus emunita'.[11] In other words, the Gepidic people live in a region west of Scythia Minor (Dobrudja), bordered by great and famous rivers, in the north by the Tisza, in the south by the great Danube itself, and in the east by the Olt ... that flows into the Danube. Beyond these, protected by the high Alps, lies 'Dacia' — which in this formulation does not coincide with the territory enclosed by the Gepids' political frontiers. The same boundaries are noted by the contemporary Jordanes: 'Daciam ... quam nunc Gepidarum populi possidere noscuntur, quae patria in conspectu Moesiae sita trans Danubium coronae montium cinguntur ... haec Gotia, quam Daciam appelatur maiorem, quae nunc, ut diximus, Gepidia dicitur ... a meridiae Danubii terminabant'.[12] Thus the Gepids' present-day country lies opposite Moesia, on the other side of the Danube. The country whose name was once Dacia, and later Gotia, is now called Gepidia and is bordered in the south by the Danube.
The Gepids must have exercised firm control over the borderline formed by the Danube between the Tisza and the Olt in order to be able to wage a successful war in 539 in the Lower Danubian region. Allied against Byzantium with the Frankish King Theudepert, the Gepids crossed the Danube and (while their allies attacked the Byzantines in Italy) won a bloody and devastating victory over the Byzantine army of magister militum Calluc, killing the latter in the process. They thereupon occupied 'almost all the Dacian towns'. This refers to the Eastern Roman 'Dacia ripensis', which stretched along the right bank of the Danube from the Iron {1-188.} Gates to the mouth of the Olt; but the Moesian Singidunum (Belgrade and its surroundings) also came under Gepidic rule. This was the occasion when, for the first time, the Gepids acquired a sizeable 'enslaved Roman population'. Over some ten years, the Gepids would facilitate the movement of Slavs across the Lower Danube, and in 550 they helped the Kutrigurs to attack Thrace. The Gepids surrendered former Roman territories south of the Danube only after being defeated by a Byzantine-Langobardic alliance in 551.
Dacia Inferior (Wallachia, Oltenia) was a military border zone, and in keeping with their settlement pattern, few if any Gepids made their homes in this region. However, the fact that only a bare trace has been found of the Gepids' passage (a 6th-century stamped potsherd, at Şimnic near Craiova) owes more to the insufficiency or bias of archaeological research. Jewels, weapons, and vessels of the Gepidic occupiers have been discovered on both sides of the Lower Danube, at Orsova (a grave containing fibulae) and other sites, including Singidunum, Viminacium, Ratiaria, and Augustae. The scarcity of archaeological finds reinforces the hypothesis that during their rule, the Gepids did not allow a significant native population to remain in the area enclosed by the Olt and the Lower Danube. The Gepidic 'Olt limes' was broken through in the early 560s by the Slavs or, at the latest, in 567–58 by the Avars.

Around 522, the Avars lost their dominant position in Central Asia. Fleeing their Turkic enemies, and accompanied by their allies, the Hephtalite Huns, they reached the northern approaches of the Caucasus at the end of 557. The following year, in Constantinople, Avar envoys negotiated a treaty of alliance with Emperor Justinian and obtained a grant of gold. They agreed, in exchange, to attack and subjugate some tribes in Southern Russia and in Ukraine — the Sabirs, Utigurs, Kutrigurs, and Saragurs — which had been draining the empire's treasury. Within three to four years, the Avars accomplished the task of (in their own words) 'wiping them off the face of the earth'.
In 562, the Avars reached the Lower Danube. Their leader, the Kagan Bayan ('bayan', meaning 'powerful, rich', was also used as a personal name) once again dispatched envoys to Justinian: the Avars now demanded renewal of the treaty, a higher annuity, and land suitable for settlement. Bayan had set his sights on the plain lying to the south of the Lower Danube, and protected by that broad river; it encompassed Scythia Minor and Moesia (Dobrudja and Northern Bulgaria), the same regions that the Bulgar Turks would occupy a century later. However, the Eastern Romans had just sealed off their frontiers, ruling out any such concession to the Avars. Thereupon, the Avar forces advanced around the northern Carpathians, only to be halted in 563, at the Elbe, by Sigebert, the Frankish King of Austrasia. They were thus compelled to return to 'Scythian Danube', the Lower Danube region, where, on Bayan's orders, 'the tents were raised in a dense mass on the broad plain'.[13]
The Avars did not tarry when they learned that Justinian I had died on 21 November 565; within a week, their envoys were in {1-219.} Constantinople. In the 'insistent tone' that marked the nomads' diplomacy, they demanded that the new emperor renew the alliance. Instead, Iustinus II abrogated the treaty, indicated (in a similarly arrogant tone) that he would no longer pay the 'servants' wages', and declared that the Lower Danubian frontier would remain sealed. In the winter of 565–66, the Avars made an attempt to force their way through, but failed.
Almost as if they were trying to escape from a trap, the Avars once again circled the Carpathians, and reached Thuringia in the fall of 566. Although they prevailed on the battlefield against Sigebert's forces, the outcome was a truce and the withdrawal of both armies.
The Avars' desperate attempts to break through on the Lower Danube and, twice, to get around Carpathians, were driven by a real sense of danger, and that danger became more immediate in the winter of 566–67. In pursuit of their 'subjects', the Western Turks had crossed the Volga and, coming within striking distance, threatened to kill the Avars 'not with swords but with the hooves of their horses, by treading them into the ground like ants'. It is clear that the Avars, having suffered five years of adversity, yearned for a haven behind defensible natural boundaries — if not on the Lower Danube, then on the plain enclosed by the Carpathian Mountains; yet neither option proved to be attainable. Historical and archaeological sources confirm that the Avars could find no passage through the Northern and Eastern Carpathians.
The archaeological data on settlements in the 5th and 6th centuries indicate that along the Northern and Eastern

Carpathians, an uninhabited and uninhabitable forest had spread in a swath that was, on average, some 120 kilometres wide (and as much as 150–200 kilometres wide in certain areas). For an entire people and its livestock, this zone would have been virtually impassable even if it had not included, in the middle, a 80–100 kilometre-wide mountain barrier with an altitude ranging from 1500 to 2000 {1-220.} metres. The situation in Transylvania could be extrapolated from the valleys of the Upper Tisza and Lower Szamos rivers: from the beginning of the 6th century, there is no archaeological trace of human life in that region all the way to the Tiszafüred-Nyíregyháza-Debrecen line. In that period, a people intent on migrating would be limited to a few more or less accessible passes in the Southern Carpathians, principally the Vöröstorony (Rotenturm) Pass, in the Olt valley, and the Roman-built roads (later used by Gepidic forces) along the Lower Danube. However, these routes were barred by the Gepids' and Byzantines' strong military outposts.
The Avars were truly caught in a trap, for if they were still in the Lower Danube region when the Turks caught up with them, they faced slaughter. These fears had not entirely dissipated even twenty years later, when they lived in the Carpathian Basin (much like the Hungarians' lingering fear of the Pechenegs around 920); in 580, Emperor Tiberius II tried to make them lift the siege of Sirmium by spreading the (false) news that Cherson had been captured by the Turks.
In the critical days during the winter of 566–67, emissaries of the Langobard King Alboin met with Bayan somewhere between the Elbe and Oder rivers; Sigebert, Alboin's brother-in-law, had probably acted as mediator between the two powers. The envoys proposed a joint, two-front assault on the Gepids, as well as an 'eternal alliance' ('foedus perpetuum', which in Langobard usage signified a military alliance).[14] They accepted Bayan's demand that, in the event of victory, the Gepids' land, population, and riches be given to the Avars; they even evoked the tempting prospect that the Avars, if they captured Pannonia Sirmiensis, might easily cross the Sava River and realize their dream of occupying Scythia Minor and Thrace, or indeed press on all the way to Byzantium.
Few details of the famous joint operation survive, for the Langobards were more intent on recording their own achievements. {1-221.} It is likely that, in keeping with the terms of the agreement, the assault was launched by the Langobards. The Gepid King Kunimund drew together his forces 'from several directions'[15] to meet the Langobard attack. Only after he had taken this fateful step did he learn of a second, Avar attack (Tristis ad Cunimundum nuntius veniens, invasisse Avares). As a result of the strategy that had been agreed upon with Alboin ('ut cum Alboin statuerunt'), the Avar army (it must be emphasized that what happened was an attack by Avar forces, and not a 'migration' of the Avar people) was able to break through the sealed frontiers (terminos edicit).
Bayan's ultimate objective was Sirmium; at the original negotiations, he already requested that Langobards provide guides who could lead him against Sirmium. Moving in through the Moravian Pass and along the left bank of the Danube, 'taking immense pains and covering a long distance,' he set upon the Gepids. The late Langobard chronicles naturally attribute to their own king and people the glory of defeating the Gepids. But Byzantine contemporaries, who were well-informed and had a direct interest in the matter, recorded that it was Bayan who had 'defeated them in war' and 'smashed the Gepids' state'.[16] They were undoubtedly right; on this occasion, the Langobards had played but a secondary role and reaped the benefits of their allies' sweeping success.
Thus Bayan defeated the Gepids' main force, led by King Kunimund; the latter was killed in battle, and Bayan, in keeping with ancient Eastern custom, had his opponent's skull turned into a drinking bowl before presenting it ostensibly in friendship — to Alboin. Thereupon, Bayan immediately crossed the Danube to attack Sirmium's Gepidic defenders. The commander of the latter, Usdibad, did not wait for the Avars to arrive; he and his soldiers surrendered to the East Roman forces, who were on a state of alert. The Gepids' heir apparent, Reptila, fled to Constantinople, as did the head of the Gepid Arian Church, Bishop Thrasarik. By the time Bayan reached Sirmium, the town was already defended by {1-222.} Bonos's Byzantine troops; the latter repulsed the Avar cavalry, which was unprepared for the siege of a fortress.
In the meantime, the Langobard-Gepid war came to an end on the Great Plain as well. Kunimund's daughter, Rosamund, and her retinue were either taken into captivity by Alboin, or, perhaps, chose the lesser evil and sought refuge with Alboin. Thousands of Gepid warriors followed suit; indeed, in such numbers that four years later, while serving Queen Rosemunda in Italy, they were able to overthrow Alboin and imperil for several months the Langobard princes' grip over northern Italy. In the area between the Tisza, Maros, and Körös rivers, few Gepids

remained who were capable of bearing arms.
After the setback at Sirmium, Bayan and his army crossed the 'Ister' river and occupied the Gepids' ransacked and plundered land.[17] The source does not relate how the rest of the Avars followed suit to settle in their new homeland. They could not have taken the Vaskapu (Iron Gate)-Orsova Pass, for it was barred by a now openly hostile Byzantine fleet. The most likely route was through the Vöröstorony Pass and the valleys of the Olt and Maros rivers. Archaeological finds indicate that this route was in use both during the Avar period and in the 9th century.

Historical and archaeological evidence points to the likelihood that the Slavs failed to penetrate the Carpathian Basin while that region was under Gepidic rule. They were barred from access by the forest zone that the Gepids had 'purposely' allowed to expand around their settled areas as well as by the strong Gepid defence of mountain passes. The Gepids' 'forest defences' were not restricted to the Carpathian line; there was probably a broad swath in the region of Hunyad, Krassó-Severin, and Temes region, and an even broader one around the Szamos and upper Tisza rivers. These forests could easily deter attack by small forces. The Slav warriors who, in the 6th century, fought their way across the Lower Danube and into the heart of the Balkans, had come from a land of vast forests, as had the tribes that followed them in search of cultivable land; it seems unlikely that they would have been drawn to the similarly forested region in the north.
At the same time, armed bands of Slavs did have an impact in Carpathian Basin. The Langobard Hildigis sought the support of Byzantines and Gepids in his quest for the throne. In the late 540s, he was aided by both Gepids and 'Sclavin' warriors in his struggle against the Langobard King Audoin.[18] Later, in pursuit of the same goal, he would continue to seek the endorsement or assistance of Gepids as well as of the Slavs, who were encamped at Noviodunum, north of the Lower Danube.
The conquering Avars swept away the Gepids' frontier defences. Until the 630s, the Avars' alliances and spheres of influence extended in the east to the southern zone of the Ukrainian steppes, to the Dnieper, or, perhaps, as far as the Donets River. The Eastern Carpathians ceased to be regarded as a 'border' by either {1-246.} Avars or Slavs. But while the latter were now free to move in through the mountain passes, it appears that — at least in the last third of the 6th century — they only established marginal contacts, through intermarriage and barter trade. In the wake of the Avar and Avar-Slav offensives, and until the end of the 7th century, the Slavs kept their sights on the Balkans and considered even Moldavia and Wallachia as mere stepping stones on the way to that ultimate destination. However, the counter-offensives conducted by the Byzantines between 598 and 601 held back the Slavs' movement into the Lower Danube region; excluded from the empire, large groups of Slavs were compelled to settle down around the Carpathians.
The Slavic migrants left clear archaeological traces, dating from the 6th-9th centuries, in their Ukrainian homeland (Prague-Penkovka and Prague-Korčak cultures and groups). Thus the departure of Slavic groups and their southerly migration can be generally traced. Their earlier settlements and burial rites were marked by such puritanical simplicity that the dating depends on finds of foreign metal objects (mainly Byzantine and Avar jewels, or their Slavic copies), and is difficult even when such objects are present.
The first traces of Slav settlements in the period following the Great Migrations are to be found in the outer fringe of the Carpathians. The oldest settlement is at Suceava-Şipot, in northern Moldavia. Stone fireplaces (kamenica = '[kő]kemence' in Hungarian) were found in the corner of their sunken floor dwellings, along with hand-made vessels of archaic style ('Prague type'). A bronze fibula indicates that the settlement was in existence in the first half of the 7th century.
The largest early Slav cemetery discovered so far faces the southeastern corner of the Carpathians, at SărataMonteoru. It consists of 1536 graves holding cremated remains (in urns or merely buried), and was evidently in use over a long period of time. A fibula, the copy of a 6th century, East Germanic model, indicates that {1-247.} the

site came into use around 600. Its continuous use in the 7th century is attested by Byzantine and Avar bronze buckles, a strap-tip, a belt-hook, and arrowheads, as well as by a large number of grey metal (potin) fibulae. Although most of the urns were hand-fashioned ('Prague type'), others testify to a growing use of the potter's wheel (so-called half-wheels).
A sizeable Slav settlement, from roughly the same period as the Monteoru cemetery, has been discovered at Bucharest-Ciurel; it yielded pottery of the Prague-Penkovka type and resembles the settlement at Suceava. Traces of other, contemporary Slavic sites have been identified around Bucharest, notably the villages at Fundeni and on Lake Tei; these are dated to the late 6th–7th centuries by fibulae and two arrowheads, one Avar, the other Gepidic. There is clear material evidence linking Slav sites on the outer fringes of the Carpathians and the eventual settlement of Slavs in Transylvania.
The first material proof of the Slavs' presence in Transylvania was found on the southern, 'Avar' edge of the cemetery at Mezőbánd, in grave 24: a small baking dish ('klebec'), hand-made and decorated in a linear dot pattern, that must have belonged to a Slav household nearby, and dates from 600–630. Similar tart dishes ('klebci') — with or without decoration — have been found on the site of the abandoned Gepid (!) village at Malomfalva-Podej. These traces indicate that, at the beginning of the 7th century, groups of Slavs had come through the Békás and Tölgyes passes to settle in the region around the upper reaches of the Maros. One of the settlements along their route, consisting of pits and sunken floor dwellings, was discovered in Kolozs county, at Septér. The site yielded mostly hand-made pots and baking pans; a few fragments of vessels, made on the wheel, and bearing a wavy, linear pattern, date from the later period of the settlement, which remained in use until the early 700s.
Concurrently, or perhaps even earlier, sizeable groups of Slavs moved by way of the Ojtoz Pass into the valley of the Feketevíz {1-248.} (Feketeügy)-Csernavoda (černa voda = black water) River as well as the valleys of the Kászon and Kovászna (kvaś and kvaśena, meaning 'sour', 'sour water') rivers. The names of these rivers are clearly Slavic, as are those of the earliest settlements, Polyán and Csernáton. Indeed, the largest number of Slavic toponyms in Transylvania are found in the Háromszék Basin: apart from those mentioned, they include Lisznyó, Szacsva, Borosnyó, Doboly, Zágon, Papolc, Esztelnek, Gelence, Torja, and Karatna.
The early Slavic settlement at Kézdipolyán-Kőhát, in the Feketeügy valley, consists of 32 huts on two levels, all of them sunken floor and with stone fireplaces. The inhabitants must have had contact with remnants of the Gepid population, for the items found in house no. 20 — a bone comb, a bronze fibula with folded extremities, a bronze pin, and the fragment of a dish with stamped decoration — date the origin of the settlement to the very end of the 6th century. Its inhabitants used the same type of 'Prague-Penkovka' (Ripnev II type) vessels as did the Slavs beyond the Carpathians. The finds include baking pans and a cast-bronze fibula (from house no. 20) that is identical to several 7th century Slavic fibulae. The early, lower layer of a settlement excavated in FelsőcsernátonRóbert-tag is in every respect similar to that of Kézdipolyán; the finds (which include, in a house with four stone ovens, baking pans and a bronze ringhead) show no trace of Avar influence. In contrast, the Slav dwellings and pits discovered under a village, dating from the Árpád period, at Sepsiszentgyörgy-Bedeháza (site A), are dated by an Avar metal object. According to reports, a fragment of pressed bronze, found at the bottom of a pit, bore an animal motif (Germanic II style); this would date the hand-shaped tiles, decorated with a rough, deeply-incised, wavy linear pattern, — and therefore the settlement itself — to the 7th century. Another Slav settlement was discovered on a hillock above the Olt River at Alsókomána, in the Barcaság (Barzenland) district; it consisted of fourteen huts, with stone fireplaces, and of eighteen {1-249.} firepits, some of which intersect. One clue to the inhabitants activities was the revolving millstone found in one of the houses. Many of the vessels found on the site were of the crude, hand-fashioned type, but others, made on the wheel and bearing wavy, linear patterns of decoration, indicate that the settlement survived perhaps into the 9th or 10th century.
It may be that the valley of the Upper Olt was occupied by Slavic groups that also arrived through the Békás Pass, and which were therefore closely related to those who settled in the Maros valley. 'Klebci' baking pans have been found at Csekefalva, near Tusnád. That settlement lived on into the 8th, and perhaps the 9th, century, and thus had the same lifespan as those at Marosszentgyörgy and Marosnagylak, which are reported to have been in use from the 7th to the 9th centuries.
The Slavs who arrived through the Hargita reached the upper valley of the Küküllő rivers around the middle of the 7th century. The 'Prague type' pottery found in the region must date from the very beginning of settlement. The

hand-made pots are more of an Avar type, and the utilization of potter's wheels probably spread from territories controlled by the Avars. This pattern is found on sites in the Kis-Küküllő valley. The settlement near the Lóc creek, at Bözöd-Doborotványa-Nagyszénafű, consists of huts with ovens made of stone slabs; 7th century, early Slavic pots were found in its lower layer, and 7th–8th century, late Slavic pots, bearing the mark of Avar influence, in the upper. At Székelyszállás-Hímes-völgy, the huts (with square and horseshoe-shaped stone ovens, some with a stone apron) yielded pots and baking pans of the Prague-Penkovka type, Avar-influenced vessels, hand-made and with an indented rim, and pottery fashioned on the wheel. The largest settlement to be uncovered is in the NagyKüküllő valley, at Fiatfalva-Nagyerdő, near Székelykeresztúr; the many huts on the site were built and inhabited over a long period of time. The origins of the settlement are dated by hand-made 'klebci', pots of the PraguePenkovka type, {1-250.} and a fragment from a 7th century, Slavic fibula. The Avar-type, hand-made dishes are followed in time by 'Avar-influenced' ceramics made on the potter's wheel (Avar arrowheads were also found), and it is only at the end of the 8th century that a more Slavic style reappears. Part of a similar settlement has been excavated in the nearby Székelykeresztúr-Körtevár valley, by the Várpataka stream. It was the first Transylvanian site to yield a trace of Slav jewellers: a casting mould for typically Slavic pendants. The mould's derivation is evoked by a similar object, dating from the 6th–7th century, that was found at Bucharest-Funden. Yet another contemporary settlement has been discovered on a hillside at Székelykeresztúr-Fenyőalja.
The find of a Byzantine bronze coin, exceedingly rare for the period, that dates from Constantine V and Leo IV (751–775) provides evidence that the Slavs eventually followed another route of access, along the Olt River; the coin may also mark a Slav settlement at Vojla, in the Fogarasföld. The settlement at Kiscsűr — eleven houses, with stone fireplaces and postholes at the corners — probably dates from this period; its beginnings are marked by hand-made dishes and a Slavic spur from the Avar era, and it survived into the 8th, or even the 9th century.
Most of the authenticated traces of Slavic presence in 8th–10th centuries have been found in the Feketeügy valley and the environs of the Olt and Nagy-Küküllő rivers, but it is far from clear whether this owes to chance or to the actual pattern of settlement. The largest sites are at Segesvár-Szőlők (where there is evidence of strong Avar influence) and at Siménfalva-Nyikó-völgy (26 huts); also noteworthy are the huts with stone fireplaces found at Szászhermány and those showing a post-type of construction at Ocfalva-Mihályfalva. Huts (mostly with stone fireplaces) that date from this period have also been discovered at Székelyszenterzsébet (4 dwellings) Angyalos, Sepsiszentgyörgy-Kula-kert, Uzon, Szotyor, Szászveresmart (Rotbach), Szászhermány-Templomudvar, {1-251.} Homoróddaróc-Templomkert, and Barót. It is in this period that the long-abandoned Roman castrum at Sóvárad began to be resettled, and that the upper settlement flourished Kézdipolyán-Kőhát (16 huts, with ceramics that were already fashioned on the wheel). So far, little information has surfaced regarding the traces of Slavic settlement discovered in the Máramaros, around the Tisza, Szamos, and Lapos rivers (Tiszakarácsonyfalva, Szarvasszó, Kisnyíres, Nagysomkút, Somkútpataka, and Nagybánya); although their origins are unclear, they appear to belong to a relatively early period.
The history of Slavic settlement presents some unresolved problems. Slavic cemeteries, dating from the 7th century and later, have been found in Transylvania, but they are located well away from the zone, in the southeast, where the traces of settlement are concentrated. So far, Slavic cremation graves have been found only to the west of that zone, in the middle of the Transylvanian Basin and in Királyföld (Königsboden), and those regions encompassed mainly Avar settlements; it is not surprising, therefore, that those larger Slavic cemeteries which were professionally excavated show traces of two distinct funeral rites. On the other hand, the discovery of large, well-established villages in the valleys of eastern and southeastern Transylvania indicates that those were regions most densely settled by Slav farmers. The failure to find the cemeteries belonging to these villages must therefore be due to chance.
So far, the oldest to be found are the two graveyards (with urns) north and northwest of Kolozsvár. It is likely that they are traces of the Slavs who moved into Transylvania in the 7th century along the Upper Tisza and the Szamos rivers. The small, hand-made urns, of the 'Nezvisko-Prague' type, that were found at Nádasdaróc-Kisdomb contained nothing but ashes, which reinforces the conclusion that they date from the early period of Slav settlement. One of likely routes taken by the Slavs, through the Meszes Gate, is marked at Piskolt-Homokbánya (Szatmár county) {1-252.} by an urn cemetery; a hand-fashioned, 'Prague type' urn yielded Avar iron fire-starters from the 7th–8th century Avar as well as a belt hook. The urn graves at Doboka are from the late Avar period. One of the urns is reported to be hand-made; another cremation grave — with scattered ashes (?) — dates from the late

8th century, for it yielded an Avar cast bronze belt decoration, with a flat, tendril-patterned pendant. The urn graves at Beszterce, known only from 19th century accounts, come from the same period and general area as the ones previously noted; more recently, a large, 'Prague type' urn was unearthed on the site.
The Slav group that buried its dead at Tordas had evidently separated from others who settled in the 7th–8th century around the upper reaches of the Küküllő rivers, and moved westwards. The cemetery's initial period is marked by hand-made urns (end of the 7th century?), but the site remained in use throughout the 8th-10th centuries. A similar case is that of the cemetery at Nagyekemező, near Nagy-Küküllő (30 urn graves). A Byzantine bronze buckle, found on a belt in the cemetery's 'skeleton grave' (the above-mentioned Avar grave), dates the cemetery back to the last third of the 7th century; the object is similar to the easily-dated buckles found at Keszthely-Dobogó, at Zsély (grave 564, containing a sabre, braid clasp, and decorated belt), at Szentes-Kaján (grave 207, a woman's grave), and Szeged-Makkos-erdő (grave 44). The spartan quality of the urn graves is another indication of the cemetery's early origins. The cemetery at Mihályfalva (40 urn graves) was also established in the 7th century; the site yielded unadorned urns, some hand-made, and a bronze hair clasp, with twisted spiral tip, of the Marosgombás-Marosveresmart type; in the excavated section of the cemetery, the early graves lie amidst the more numerous 9th–10th century urn graves, arranged in rows and clusters.
The largest site in the Carpathian Basin of Slavic urn-graves was on the south bank of the Nagy Küküllő, at Baráthely 2. Moreover, that is the only confirmed site where a significant number {1-253.} of Avars cohabited with Slavs: the cemetery holds 36 graves of Avar origin (34 with skeletons, 2 with horses) as well as 210 graves of cremated Slavs (34 in urns). The Avar graves are scattered throughout the site, most of them in the alignment that characterizes the late Avar period. Some 90% of the Avar objects found in the cemetery (stirrup, bridle, castbronze belt ornaments, earrings adorned with tiny spheres, beads shaped like melon seeds, iron strike-a-light, and pottery) came from graves that held a skeleton. The rites, clothing, accessories and funeral objects are similar to those found in other regions of the Avar empire, at cemeteries of less wealthy, Avar villages dating from the 8th century. The find in four cremation graves of an Avar earring with tiny spheres, a crescent-shaped earring with silver pendant, an iron rattle, and some cast-bronze belt ornaments with a tendril pattern is particularly significant, for it serves as proof of cohabitation.
All of the archaeological finds at Baráthely 2 confirm that the urn cemetery came into use no earlier than the end of the 8th century; therefore, there could not have been any continuity between Baráthely 2 and Baráthely 1, a cemetery, dating from the 3rd–4th centuries, where ashes were simply interred. The Avar presence at Baráthely 2 remains evident as late as the early 800s; for instance, the grave holding a horse and full harness is of very late origin. The early hand-made, 'Prague type' urns and dishes are notable by their absence; the earliest Slavic urns in the cemetery hold 8th–9th century pots, fashioned on a wheel and bearing a wavy linear pattern, and similar to those found at sites in the Küküllő valley. Most of the Slav burials date from the post-Avar period ('Medgyes type' urns and dishes), when few personal accessories — only a few beads and iron knives — found their way into the graves. The cemetery essentially dates from the 9th century, although a few urns testify that it remained in use after the Hungarian settlement in the 10th century.
An extensive graveyard of Slavs buried in urns, and one that is characteristic of the late Avar period (the 8th and early 9th centuries), {1-254.} was found at Vizakna-Láb (120 cremation graves and 16 graves holding skeletons). Its beginnings can be dated by a late Avar bone carving and, perhaps, by the fragment of a decorated jar. Anthropological analysis indicates that 82 (out of 88) urns each held the ashes of two persons. If this finding is valid, it indicates that the sacrifice — voluntary or otherwise — of widows was practised among Transylvania's Slavs in the 8th–9th century.
The section of a cremation cemetery uncovered at the confines of Nagyszeben-Szenterzsébetfalva, near Kalten Brunnen, dates from the same period; it holds (including earlier finds) 73 urn graves, one grave of ashes, and one with a skeleton. In this rather densely populated section, the graves are not laid out in rows or groups, and thus the only links that can be inferred are domestic ones. Apart from one Byzantine ring, the grave finds are modest: a few iron knives, iron clips, and iron strikes-a-light that indicate men's graves, and a few glass beads and iron bracelets from what are probably women's graves. The urns, fashioned on a wheel, are decorated in somewhat random fashion with wavy lines and bunched-up lines, or with incised, wavy stripes, all of these being essentially 8th–9th century patterns. The urn graves at Kisselyk, Kisprázsmár, and Szászsebes also date from the 8th century.

https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/47.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:19:28]
The urn cemetery, which was the basis of the Transylvanian sites of Slavic cremation graves known as 'horizons' or 'groups', was only established in the 9th century. The group of urn graves excavated at Medgyes-Galgenberg has a layout that departs from earlier practice: the urns were buried into two straight and widely separated rows. The urns, made on a wheel, are distinctively decorated, with close-set, horizontal lines; many of them have a master's mark stamped on the bottom. At least half of the graves of Baráthely 2 hold Medgyes-type urns, and the same type is found in the later urn graves at Mihályfalva and Tordas. There is less information about a number of other finds: an urn cemetery at Marosújvár-Csongva, the 300-grave cemetery at Berve (of mixed rite, {1-255.} and holding mostly urn graves, as well as a few, scattered cremation graves and graves with skeletons), two urn cemeteries at Mezőszopor, and the urn graves at Oláhgorbó, Balázsfalva, and Gyulafehérvár.
The Slavs' cremation cemeteries in Transylvania, dating from the 7th–10th centuries, show a rather dismal uniformity. The graveyards — with a few exceptions that may be explained by inadequate research — consist of a few graves that contain skeletons. The rites, objects, and garments point to the possibility that these graves hold either the Avar chiefs of Slav communities (Baráthely 2, Mihályfalva) or Slav chiefs who had adopted Avar ways and acted on behalf of the Avars. The majority of Slavs was cremated and buried in pits or urns, which occasionally held iron knives, strike-a-light implements, or, even more rarely, jewellery (hair clasps, earrings, beads). Whether such modest burials were imposed by a specific funeral rite, or whether they reflected economic and social circumstances, has long been a matter of debate, and even this question probably oversimplifies the problem.
The Slavs who advanced westward and southwestward in the 6th–7th centuries had a material culture less developed than that of their European contemporaries. This backwardness was indicated by their ignorance of the potter's wheel and of any but the most primitive techniques for working bronze and iron. On the other hand, their knowledge of agriculture and animal husbandry, and indeed their settlements and houses, differed little from those of the Germanic tribes of Central Europe. The groups that headed for the Lower Danube were led by military (tribal) chiefs, many of whom were known by name to the Byzantines; thus their society had evolved beyond the level of closed clans.
The Slavs' permanent village settlements (such as Kézdipolyán, Fiatfalva, Siménfalva, and Székelyszállás), each consisting of some 30–40 huts, bear witness to centuries of agricultural activity. The contradiction between this and the modesty of their {1-256.} graveyards is more apparent than real. The excavated parts of cemeteries at Baráthely, Szenterzsébet, Mihályfalva, and Tordas display the same material culture and continuity.
So far, the cremation graves have revealed little about the Transylvanian Slavs' social structure in the 7th–10th centuries. At first glance, the graveyards seem archaic: they belong to clans, hold clusters of families (revealed by the rows of graves at Medgyes, Mihályfalva, and Tordas), and bear the traces of sacrificed widows and utter 'paganism'. This picture seems to fit the Transylvanian Slavs, who, despite their geographically central location, were at the margin of the Western Slavs' cultural development. The economic development, and the consequent social structure of the Western Slavs was affected by their proximity to the Merovingian, and then Carolingian empires. Similarly, the Southern Slavs felt the impact of neighbouring Byzantium. The Eastern Slavs found themselves at the meeting point of trade routes and economic forces. The Slavs of Transylvania were the only group that was isolated from such influences.
It must also be taken into account that the Slav cemeteries discovered so far all lie in the middle of the Transylvanian Basin, the region where the Slavs were came — willingly or otherwise — under the direct rule of the Avars. Their lives must have been onerous: they mined salt, felled trees, and paid tax in grain and animals. Their constituted what amounted to a servant class, and this status was only confirmed when they fell under the rule of the Bulgars. By the 9th century, the chiefs and leaders were buried (in skeleton graves) in the same simple style as were ordinary Slavs. And the demands made upon them by their Avar masters probably grew heavier.
Hungarian written sources, which became prevalent in the 11th–12th centuries, make note of many Slavic names of rivers and sites in Transylvania and the Temes region. A chronological analysis of archaeological finds suggests that some of these names — {1-257.} such as those, noted earlier, of rivers in the Háromszék Basin — date from the arrival of the Slavs. According to this analysis, the Slavic names of two tributaries of the Nagy-Szamos River (Beszterce = bystra/bystrica = 'swift'; Lekence = lekenica = 'with water lilies') are of early origin, as are those of two tributaries of the Olt (Cibin = sybin = 'with dogberries'; Cód = sade = 'sedimented'). The presence of Slav

villages along the upper reaches of the Küküllő rivers, east of the Avar settlement area, explains why the rivers acquired the Slavic name Tirnava. The fact that the cemetery at Baráthely 2 was used concurrently by Avars and Slavs accords with the contemporary, and equally concurrent application of two names to the river, Kökeleg ('blue') and Tirnava ('sloe-coloured').
The emergence in the 8th–9th centuries of the Szilágynagyfalu-type block of Slav settlements (see below) fully accounts for the Slavic origin of several names of rivers: the Kraszna (= krasna = 'red river'), Deberke (= dabreka = 'good river'), Lona (= lovini = 'fishing river'), and Lozsád (= luža = 'flat, marshy'), which are tributaries of the Szamos and Kis-Szamos, and the Bisztra (= bystra = 'swift'), a tributary of the Berettyó. There is not sufficient archaeological data to date the origin of Slavic river names on the right side of the Szamos. Further study of the settlement and urn cemetery at Zsebely/Széphely may one day serve to date the Slavic river names in the Temes region and Krassó-Severin.
It seems that Küküllő-Tirnava and the names of rivers in Háromszék and Beszterce date from the 7th–8th centuries. With regard to other river names, however, it must be borne in mind that the Slavs arrived in some Transylvanian regions as early as the 7th century, and left traces at least up to the end of the 12th century; indeed, there is archaeological evidence of their presence in Máramaros as late as the 12th–13th century (Máramarossziget, Szarvasszó). A succession of major political changes — Avar, Bulgar, and Hungarian resettlements, followed by administrative and settlement policies of the Hungarian feudal state — must have {1-258.} had a profound impact on the circumstances of the Transylvanian Slavs, but there is insufficient evidence to trace the resulting changes. Thus caution must be exercised in using archaeological data to demonstrate continuity in the Slavic names of rivers, and even more in the case of place names.

7. TRANSYLVANIA IN THE PERIOD OF THE HUNGARIAN CONQUEST AND FOUNDATION OF A STATE
{1-264.} 6. SOUTHERN TRANSYLVANIA UNDER BULGAR RULE
Sometime in the period between Charlemagne's offensive of fall 791 (successfully repelled) and the autumn of 795, the Avar empire was shaken by a catastrophic civil war. The two leading figures, the kagan and the jugurrus, fell out and waged a bitter struggle against each other. In nomadic empires, the 'right flank' was generally commanded by a leader of lesser rank; in the case of the western part of the Avar empire, this was the tudun. Therefore it is likely that figure who ruled over the region east of the Tisza, the Maros region, and Transylvania was the higher-ranking jugurrus (cf. the Hungarian harka-kündü-gyula triad in the mid 900s). The civil war ended with the defeat of the jugurrus and his followers; he himself was killed. However, time was too short for the kagan to fully reimpose his authority. In the winter of 795–96, the Franks renewed their attacks, and the outcome would be the collapse of the Avar empire. It can be inferred from these events that the Avars themselves decimated their ruling class in Transylvania.
Between 802 and 804, the Avars suffered further grievous blows, perhaps in several waves: the army of Krum, the Bulgar khan, advanced northward into the Tisza region. The invaders put the kagan to flight and captured a host of Avar soldiers; years later, the latter would serve in the Bulgars' campaign against Byzantium.
There is no sign that Krum's military campaign touched Transylvania, nor that any part of the Carpathian Basin was occupied by Bulgars in the first decade of the 9th century. To the contrary, reliable, contemporary sources indicate that 'Dacia on the Danube' (presumably the Temes region) and Sirmia were occupied {1-265.} by Balkan Slavs who were fleeing the Bulgars and seeking the protection of the Franks. These newcomers were the Abroditas (abodriti-praedenecenti 'qui ... contermini Bulgaris Daciam Danubio adiacentem incolunt') and the Timocians (timociani).[19] The emergence of this protectorate caused friction between the Frankish and Bulgar empires, which failed in the period 824–26 to settle their differences by negotiation. Around 827–31, the Bulgar Khan Omurtag launched a broad offensive against the Central Danube region; his armies occupied Sirmia and East Slavonia as well as parts of the Tisza region that are yet to be identified (perhaps as far as Csongrád = černi grad = 'black castle'). The Bulgar conquest was confirmed in the peace treaty that Khan Malamir concluded in 832 with the Eastern Frankish empire. There is no mention of the Timocians after 825, but the Abodritas are known to have been once again subjected by the Bulgars. The Bavarian Geographus counted among the Bulgars' neighbours the osterabtrezi Slavs — i.e. the eastern Abodritas — who lived in 'Dacia'. Ninth century written sources offer no further information with regard to the eastern half of the Carpathian Basin. However, the events of 863 and 883 show that the Bulgars were quite able to cross the Great Plain and the Garam River to attack Moravia. It is therefore likely that they had military outposts in the Tisza and Maros valleys.
Only a single piece of information, dating from 892, evokes the Bulgars' rule in Transylvania. King Arnulf's envoys requested that the Bulgar Khan 'Laodimir' (Vladimir) 'not allow the Moravians to buy (and transport) salt' ('Ne coemptio salis inde Maravanis daretur').[20] This indicates that in the 9th century, the Bulgars had taken possession of some of Transylvania's salt mines and traded in the salt mined by their subjects.
Fortunately, there are other, archaeological sources that throw light on Bulgar rule in Transylvania: the recently identified traces, dating from the 8th and 9th centuries, of the Bulgar khanate. The excavations were conducted on the site of the ancient capital cities, {1-266.} Pliska and Preslav, and at numerous cemeteries as well. Dobrudja, which was under Bulgar rule at the time, has also yielded much useful archaeological data. The finds in Transylvania are consistent with those in Bulgaria dating from the 9th–10th centuries.
The most significant site is the cemetery at Maroskarna. This unusual graveyard, located on the left bank of the Maros, has been repeatedly damaged by flooding. Despite repeated salvage attempts, the only traces of funeral rites are the dishes and skeletons washed up by the river, but this does not exclude the possibility that the cememtery had also contained cremation graves. Some 30 intact dishes, all made on the wheel, are now preserved in a museum. Their shape and decoration cannot be traced back to the earlier, Avar and Slavic pottery found in



6. SOUTHERN TRANSYLVANIA UNDER BULGAR RULE
https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/49.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:19:39]
Transylvania. All of them bear the distinctive features common to Bulgar pottery of the period: yellow and reddish-brown carafes with one or two handles (amphorae); pear-shaped mugs, with thick, 'ringed' brims, and either a smooth finish or deep, web-like decoration; slightly funnel-shaped pots; an unusual, cauldron-like pot with pierced handle; and others that evoke the 'Medgyes type' pots. That last object was a common find in Bulgaria, and Bulgar-Slav influence may be responsible for its dissemination in 9th-century Transylvania. Vessels identical to those from Maroskarna have been unearthed in large numbers at the major settlements (Pliska, Madara, Preslav, Kadiköj) and cemeteries in Bulgaria, as well was in Dobrudja. They spread from Bulgaria toward the Carpathians along the Olt and Zsil valleys, and perhaps also by other routes that led from Dobrudja and Silistra to Transylvania. Traces of villages dating from the 8th and 9th centuries — the period of Bulgar rule — have been identified at Ploieşti-Bucov; the Slav-Bulgar finds reveal the links between Bulgaria and Transylvania. The cemetery, consisting mostly of graves with skeletons, that was discovered in the Mostiştea valley, at Sultana, confirms that the Danubian Bulgars established outpost settlements as they advanced towards Transylvania.
{1-267.} As far as Maroskarna is concerned, the routes leading to the Bulgar motherland are of secondary importance, for the cemetery is far more than the marginal manifestation of a northward-spreading, archaeological 'culture'. It is, in fact, the cemetery of a population that had been collectively resettled, along with its material culture, from south of the Danube. This resettled population formed an 'island', for, judging from its traces, it inhabited only a small number of sites along the middle reaches of the Maros. Graves (with skeletons) yielded fine Bulgar vessels, including distinctive amphorae at Szászsebes (along with iron knives and sheep-bones) as well as at Kudzsir and Sebesán (along with jugs and pots). The intact vessels found at Gyulafehérvár Castle (amphorae and pots with smoothed-in decoration), Gyulafehérvár-Partos, and Magyarszentbenedek originally came from graves as well. At Oláhgorbó, two coffins holding skeletons were unearthed in what is probably a smaller cemetery. The dishes that once held food for the deceased differ slightly from those at Maroskarna, but they are still typical of Danubian Bulgar pottery, and a woman's beads and bronze earrings are 9th-century Bulgar models; sheep bones indicate that meat was buried with the deceased, and thus testify to the Bulgars' pagan rite. The fragment of a hand-made, earthenware cauldron — unique in Transylvania — that was unearthed at the Bulgar site of Oláhdálya-Troján cannot be dated precisely, for the settlement was still in existence in the 10th–11th centuries. Bulgar traces have been found along both banks of the Maros on strips of land 30–40 kilometres wide. A fine, ring-rimmed Bulgar pot with smoothed-in web decoration, found at Kézdipolyán, testifies merely to some contact with the Bulgar settlement area on the Maros or with the Lower Danubian region.
Further up the Maros, the cemetery at Csombord evokes yet another 'island' of settlement. So far, thirty-two graves have been excavated; aligned on an west-east axis, they date from the 9th–10th centuries. The grave goods included women's jewellery: {1-268.} four graves yielded 14 diverse, richly-filigreed pendants, while three others yielded beads, a half-moon shaped pendant (lunula), and a disc-shaped pendant ornament.
Jewels of the same type as those from Csombord and Oláhgorbó have been found only in Bulgaria, almost exclusively in cemeteries dating from the 9th–10th centuries. Bulgarian archaeologists judge that both the Csombord and Maroskarna cemeteries are of Bulgar origin.
In all likelihood, the Maros valley was occupied by a detachment from Khan Omurtag's army. Perhaps it was a unit that veered away from the Tisza in the direction of Transylvania; one of its chiefs, Tarkan Onega(bon) of the Küviar clan, drowned in the Tisza. Or, perhaps, it was another detachment that came up along the Olt River. Following the conquest, which must have occurred around 830, the Bulgars established settlements along the Maros. The settlers came from the right bank of the Lower Danube, in Bulgaria. Their material legacy jewellery, and dishes, complete with potters' marks on the bottom — is entirely the product of Danubian Bulgars. The settlers, who enjoyed military protection (grave with spurs at Tatárlaka), were charged with the task of putting back into production the salt mines at Marosújvár, Mezőakna, Sóvárad, and Torda, and to organize the transport of salt on the Maros River. Some of the shipments, towed along the Tisza to Csongrád, went to the Moravians, but most of them were directed downstream towards Belgrade. Since the bulk of the salt was probably shipped to the Bulgar khanate on the Lower Danube, the settlers had easy access to Bulgar products and luxury articles (jewellery). None of the finds indicate that they changed their way of life.
There is no information in historical sources regarding the background of the settlers. The Bulgar empire on the Danube had a mixed population that consisted principally of Bulgaro-Turks (whose language began to acquire

Slavic characteristics in the 9th {1-269.} century), various Slavic tribes, and the Balkan Latins (Vlachs). One of the fundamental goals of the early Bulgar khanate's empire-building policy was to resettle the various ethnic groups. In the case of Transylvania, the answer lies in burial rituals, for the graves contained skeletons; and there is general agreement that in Danubian Bulgaria's 'pagan' cemeteries of the 8th–9th centuries, these graves held the remains of Bulgaro-Turks. To be sure, cemeteries of this type were less numerous than those that cremation and double rites identify with the Slavic and local Balkanic population; but they reflect the ornate, 'nomadic' attire and wealth of a dominant group. It is therefore likely that Bulgaro-Turk soldiers and their families — the ethnic group that gave the empire its name — were present in Transylvania, a militarily and economically insecure border zone.
There has been linguistic speculation that such toponyms as Brassó, Krassó, Barca, and Barót have a BulgaroTurkish derivation. Since the Barcaság bears no traces of Bulgar rule, this hypothesis lacks archaeological confirmation. However, it is possible that, both in the Tisza region and Transylvania, the Bulgar overlords relied on the remnants of another ethnic group: the Onogur-Bulgars (Wangars), who had moved into the region in the same period as the Danubian Bulgars. In this case, the Bulgar-type toponyms of the Barcaság might well be of Onogur-Bulgar origin. A more plausible contention is that the name of the Karas-Krassó River, in the Temes region, is derived directly, or via the Slavs, from Danubian Bulgar. Vessels of the 'Maroskarna type' archaeological traces of Bulgars — have been found at Temesvár and Parác, as well as in the area of MarosAranka (Nagyszentmiklós, Makó, Deszk).
The Romano-Byzantine castle of Singidunum had white stone ramparts, and, in the 9th century, the Bulgar conquerors named it 'Belgrad', meaning 'White Castle'. In Bulgaria, the predominance of the Slavic language can be dated from the death of the last Turkish-named khan, Omurtag (831). Archaeological finds (quantities of Maroskarna-type pottery, including fragments with {1-270.} smoothed-in web pattern) indicate that the Bulgars' central settlement in the Maros region was located within the Roman, white stone walls of Apulum; and it was evidently the Bulgars who named the town Belgrad. For centuries, the Slavs who lived in the region continued to use that name, which probably explains its adoption into modern Romanian (Bălgrad).
There is some significance in the very fact that the sparse traces of the Bulgaro-Turks who had been resettled into Transylvania do not reveal much about their relations with the local Slav population. The influence of the Danubian Bulgars' more advanced techniques may be detected in the pottery ('Dridu pottery-craft') that dates from the time of Medgyes-type urn cemeteries, and it was still visible in the Szilágynagyfalu group. The aftereffects can be noted in the vessels that were found around Slavic stone fireplaces and Hungarian earth ovens at the 10thcentury site in Maroskarna.

{1-318.} Settlements and Villages in Transylvania at the Time of the Conquest and in the early Árpádian Period
Owing to the small number of excavated sites (archaeological digs of settlements are expensive, time-consuming, and seldom show 'spectacular' results), the pattern of settlement in the 10th–12th centuries is as difficult to ascertain in Transylvania as it is in the rest of Árpádian Hungary. Only a few of the early settlements can be dated by metallic objects: at Csernáton and at Sepsiszentgyörgy-Bedeháza, rhombus-shaped arrowheads and 11thcentury spurs; at Angyalos, a rhombus-shaped arrowhead; at Marosgombás, a rhombus-shaped arrowhead and a horse skull; at Erősd-Csókásvár, fragments of an early bridle and sabre(?); at Maroslekence, a heart-shaped harness decoration, plain hair-rings, iron fire-starters, and spurs. The sites at Malomfalva and Doboka were described above. Some finds testify only to the later, 11th-12th century period of the villages: thus, the S-tipped hair ring found in a house (equipped with an earthen oven) at Székelykeresztúr-Gyárfáskert; coins, dating from Stephen II, at Baráthely, and from Coloman and Béla III at Betlenszentmiklós; and an 11th or 12th century spur at RétySuvadástető.
A common form of Árpádian pottery, the 'Csüged type', is an indicator of the political and economic unity that prevailed in the Árpádian period. The Transylvanian sites that have yielded such pots include Gyulafehérvár (Csüged and -Püspökvár), Dobokavár, Marosvásárhely-Vár, Székelyudvarhely (-Budavár, -Székelytámad, and Gyárosfalva), Székelykeresztúr, Malomfalva (-Csittfalva and -Hula), Radnót, Nagymedesér, Sajósárvár, Sepsiszentgyörgy (-Várgödre and -Bedeháza), Betlenszentmiklós, Vizakna, Vermes, Kézdiszentlélek-Perkő, Erősd-Csókásvár, Csanád, and Csákó. Although early versions still reflect to some extent the technical and decorative techniques of Bulgar-Slav potters of the 9th and 10th centuries, this pottery does not serve to identify an ethnic {1-319.} group. Other vessels, found at Ákosfalva, Alsó-Csernáton, Dedrádszéplak, and sundry locations, can be dated only individually and reveal even less information.
There is, however, one object that clearly indicates Hungarian settlements of the 10th–12th centuries and cannot be linked to the presence of other ethnic groups: the earthenware cauldron. Of late, this distinctive vessel has been the subject of much archaeological study. To be sure, its origins can be traced back to the Khazar- Bulgar 'SaltovoMaják' culture, and finds in Moldova and Dobrudja indicate that the Pechenegs used similar vessels in the 10th and 11th centuries. But the fact is that, in contrast to the later-arriving Cumanians, Pechenegs never settled as a group in the Carpathian Basin; there is little trace of them in historical sources and in 10th-13th century place-names. Thus, from an archaeological perspective, Pecheneg finds are a sporadic, 'invisible' phenomenon.
What is more significant, and conclusive, is that the cauldrons — made of earthenware or iron, more rarely of copper (Betlenszentmiklós and Magyarbénye) — are found throughout the territory that was indisputably settled by Hungarians in the 10th-12th centuries. They are a distinctive characteristic of Hungarian settlement. Beyond serving as an 'ethnic' identifier, the cauldrons reflect specific social conditions, for they were the shared cooking vessel of clan- and family-based communities; the social structure based on these small communities took a long time to disintegrate, for they practised an isolated, pastoral way of life, and this, in turn, led to the prolonged use of cauldrons. Thus the earthenware cauldron may be regarded as an economic and social indicator of Hungarians from the 10th to the 12th centuries. This indicator bears no relevance to any of the other peoples living at the time in the Carpathian Basin, or, indeed, in all of Central Europe — with the exception of Pechenegs and Bulgars in the Prut and Lower Danube regions, and their cauldrons (found at Garvan and other sites) are {1-320.} clearly distinguishable from those of the Hungarians. By then, the great community of Germanic peoples had long since disintegrated, and while the Slavs, especially the Southern Slavs, continued to flourish, they did not have the seminomadic, pastoral culture which, in the case of the Hungarians, gave birth to this distinctive vessel.
When a new, feudal order and way of life became consolidated following the invasion and withdrawal of the Mongols, the family-clan culture faded away, and that important archaeological indicator, the cauldron,

https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/56.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:20:00]
disappeared as well. There remain the traces of hundreds of early Árpádian villages that had been burned down by the Mongols or which had been abandoned from the 13th century onwards. Fragments of cauldrons have been found in the 'upper' layer, dating from the 12th and early 13th centuries, but most of the villages had a 'lower' layer as well, dating from the 11th and even the 10th centuries. The excavations at Doboz and Malomfalva have served as excellent case-studies.
Earthenware cauldrons have been found at settlements and excavation strata that Hungarian metal objects (such as arrowheads and belt ornaments) date from the 10th–11th century: Biharvár, Kolozsvár (Monostor), Tordavár (Várfalva), Aradvár (Glogovác), Gyulafehérvár, Dobokavár, Csernáton (upper level), Sepsiszentgyörgy-Bedeháza, Maroslekence, and Malomfalva. There is no trace of earlier cauldrons at any of these sites. At some locations Csíkszentkirály, Radnót, Kelnek, Gyulafehérvár, Malomfalva, Réty, Sajósárvár, Dobokavár, Asszonynépe — the finds included not only cauldrons, but also that other distinctive Hungarian vessel, the Eastern, 'Saltovo type' pot. On other sites, the cauldrons are dated from the end of the 11th century to the second half of the 12th century by pieces of money: coins from the time of Ladislas II (along with an S-tipped hair-ring) at Ó-Bodrogmonostor, of Constantine IX at Csernáton, of Coloman and Béla III at Betlenszentmiklós, and of Stephen II at Baráthely. Cauldrons have also been dated by 10th {1-321.} and 11th century graves and cemeteries belonging to the settlements at Gyulavarsánd, Sajtény-Salánk, Pécska, Déva, Betlenszentmiklós, Biharszentjános-Klastromdomb, ÖthalomGlogovác- Földvár, Radnót, Sajó-Sárvár, Szászsebes, and Várfalva; the cauldron at Székelykeresztúr was dated by an S-tipped hair-ring found in the same dwelling. Finally, some cauldrons are dated from the 10th and 11th centuries by their decoration of incised, single or bunched wavy lines: at Segesvár-Szőlők, Sajósárvár, BulcsKápolnás, Körösgyéres, Belényesszentmiklós, and also at Kolozsmonostor, where the finest example was found.
As of 1985, cauldrons had been found at some 160 sites in Transylvania and at the eastern end of the Great Plain; this corresponds to the frequency of finds in Hungary proper (1975), and thus indicates a similar level of archaeological activity as well as similar patterns of settlement. To be sure, systematic excavation can quickly alter these statistics: a single site may yield hundreds of fragments of earthenware cauldrons, and sustained search may lead to the rapid discovery of many new sites. Thus in Békés county, formerly a blank spot on the archaeological map, the recent, systematic exploration of two districts led to the discovery of cauldron-yielding sites greater in number than those previously known in the entire Carpathian Basin.
The greatest concentrations of cauldron sites are on the Great Plain (Nagyalföld), which straddles the Tisza River, and on the Small Plain (Kisalföld), in northwestern Hungary; toponymic data and historical sources confirm that these were Hungarian-inhabited territories. The cluster of sites in the eastern Great Plain, beyond the Tisza, extends into the flatland around the Ér, Berettyó, Körös, and Maros rivers; there are forty sites in present-day Arad county alone. In Transylvania, too, most of the cauldrons have been unearthed in the valleys and lowlands.
No cauldrons have been found in Central European regions where the population — according to historical, toponymic, and {1-322.} archaeological data — was wholly Slavic. The hypothesis, that the cauldrons, which were unknown in Transylvania prior to the 10th century, are of Eastern origin, is supported by the discovery of similar vessels on the territory of the former Khazar empire. The intense debate among archaeologists over the origin of the cauldrons has been somewhat attenuated by objective assessment of the sites. Most of cauldron sites have no relation to present-day villages and towns; at least 90 percent of them are villages or homesteads that were destroyed during the Mongolian invasion or abandoned in the 12th and 13th centuries. In terms of the history of settlement, the sites bear witness to the denser network of villages that existed in the Árpádian period.
The dwellings that housed the earthenware cauldrons and other vessels (Hungarian, Slavic, Árpádian) in Transylvania are similar to those found elsewhere in the Carpathian Basin and the rest of Eastern Europe. These 'houses' had rounded corners, measured 3 by 2–4 metres, and were dug into the ground to a depth of 80–100 centimetres. Some of the huts (e.g. at Mezőerked) had a stone fireplace, while in others (Székelykeresztúr-Gyárfáskert, Csernáton-Domonkos-kúria), a firepit had been dug in one corner of the dwelling. It is hard to differentiate the latter from the sunken, 'outdoor' ovens found in other villages and dwellings (at Vermes, both types are present).
A small hoard of Byzantine coins, found in a pouch at Csernáton, serves well to date the early Árpádian, archaeological culture of Transylvania. The pouch had been concealed — or lost — when the village was destroyed by the Pechenegs in the course of one of their incursions in the latter half of the 11th century. The coins

https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/56.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:20:00]
date from the time of Nicephorus II Phocas (963–969) and Johannes Tzimisces II (969–979) to that of Constantine IX Monomachus (1042–1055), shortly before the untimely death of the village. It follows that both the rhombusshaped arrowhead and the cauldron that were unearthed at Csernáton antedate the latest coin.
{1-323.} The Pecheneg threat can be credited with another noteworthy trove. As early as the 10th century, the Hungarians had engaged in the trade of silver and salt, and thereby obtained some Byzantine-style jewels of old Russian and old Polish provenance. Most of these jewels had not been purposely concealed, for, in the 11th century, enemy incursions seldom reached farther than the borderlands. One such treasure, consisting of old Russian (as well as some Scandinavian) silver jewellery, was unearthed in the western gyepű (a ring of uninhabited and scarcely penetrable marches and waste land surrounding the country in the medieval Hungary) at Darufalva. Silver pendants similar to those found at Darufalva date the earliest period of the fort at Daruvár. The trove of jewels discovered in the 'Királyföld'/Königsboden, an early settlement area of the Székelys, is of uncommon interest and has no parallel in the Carpathian Basin. It consists, in smaller part, of 'broken silver' (possibly due to the carelessness of the finders), and, in larger part, of intact jewels: richly-filigreed, silver 'knobbed' beads, earrings, a half-moon shaped pendant, a cast-silver bracelet, and glass beads. This collection, similar to that found at Darufalva, probably belonged to the family of a border-guard; the jewels were made around the year 1000 and were presumably acquired in the same period. Judging from other troves, dated by coins, in Eastern Europe, such jewels were worn as late as the first half of the 11th century. Thus the Királyföld collection may well have been concealed by a supporter of the gyulas at the time of King St. Stephen's military campaign in Transylvania; the other possibility, suggested by the coin trove at Csernáton, is that it was concealed at the time of the first attacks of the Pechenegs.
Three coin treasures correspond in date and location to the first significant Cumanian incursion, led by Kapolcs, in 1091; the coins, dating from the time of Ladislas I, were unearthed at Torda (a pot holding 48 pieces, probably once part of a greater treasure), at Magyarfráta (120 pieces), and at Biharszentandrás (170 pieces, {1-324.} plus a coin of Constantine IX Monomachus [1042–1055]). After breaking through the Ojtoz Pass, the Cumanians had ravaged the environs of Torda and Kolozsvár, then proceeded to do the same in the Great Plain, beginning with Bihar and its hinterland. The buried treasures testify not only to the destructive advance of the Cumanians, but also to the amount of wealth that some individuals had accumulated by this time. The coin trove that was reportedly unearthed in the 1870s at Lámkerék (part of present-day Szászsebes) is more difficult to assess. If the account is correct, and the trove consisted of silver coins from the time of King Peter, then it might be concluded that one of his followers resided in this important place when the monarch was overthrown — which occurred twice, in 1041 and 1046.
The mountains and forests ('Királyerdő') around the Sebes-Körös and Fekete-Körös rivers, once famous for their stock of bison (in Hungarian, bölény, hence the toponym Belényes), were known in the 11th and 12th centuries as the Igfan/Ygfon, meaning 'sacred vastness'. In the 1060s and 70s, they were a favourite hunting ground of Duke Géza. On a plateau above the present-day village of Belényesszentmiklós, near the spot where the Fekete-Körös River meets the Poklos brook and reaches the lowlands, an archaeological site known for at least a hundred years was excavated between 1972 and 1982. A sizeable manor-house, measuring 10 by 28 meters at the base, had been built there around the middle of the 11th century. Set on a foundation of stone and packed clay, the brick house had the shape of an elongated hall; wood lean-tos had been added along its length on both sides. The remains of the manor's chapel, which dates from the same period, were discovered some 150 metres to the north, under the imposing ruins of a monastery. Judging from the archaeological strata and finds (11th century vessels and earthenware cauldrons), both house and chapel had been erected between 1050 and 1070, making this the earliestknown Árpádian, princely manor. Although there is no visible trace {1-325.} of fortification, the manor, situated on the highest promontory, must have been protected by a palisade. The building complex is probably the princely 'hunting lodge' that is known to have been erected during the dukedom of Béla or Géza. The original buildings may have been damaged during the Cumanians' incursion in 1091. The manor house was rebuilt and expanded, partly on the old foundations, perhaps during the dukedom of Prince Álmos, and in any event no later than the 12th century; its inner courtyard was sectioned by large pillars. As for the chapel, it was turned into a church with the addition of a pillared choir. In the 13th century, this royal property passed into the ownership of Borsa, who had a manor house in neighbouring Széplak. The Borsa family, which long enjoyed King Ladislas IV's favour, expanded the manor and erected a vast monastery on the site of the little church, drawing on the latter for building material.



Settlements and Villages in Transylvania at the Time of the Conquest and in the early Árpádian Period
https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/56.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:20:00]
Archaeological investigations have been pursued methodically for over 150 years, and even if they were not focused systematically on this period, the results produce a broad picture of the pattern of settlement in Transylvania during the 10th and 11th centuries.
The area that encompasses the eastern fringe of the Great Plain, reaching from the Ér region to the Lower Danube, as well as the contiguous valleys, differs from the more westerly plains in one significant respect: the presence of major centres of early settlement and political power, stretching from Szatmárvár, through Biharvár, Várad, Zarándvár, Aradvár, and Temesvár to Krassóvár and even Orsova. The pattern of settlement in the vicinity of these centres was more dense than in the middle and southern Tiszántúl (the region east of the Tisza River), which helps to explain why, in the 11th century, Marosvár/Csanád and Biharvár emerged as centres of political opposition to the seats of power at Esztergom and Székesfehérvár. The Szamos and the Szilágy regions, lying to the north around the valley of the Túr, Szamos, and Kraszna rivers, present {1-326.} a different picture, for they yield virtually no archaeological trace of early Hungarian settlement; linguistic and toponymic analysis confirms that the Slavic settlements in these regions survived into the 11th century. In contrast, the Slavic block in the Temes-KrassóLower Danube region began to lose its homogeneity as early as the 10th century.
The situation in historic Transylvania was somewhat different. The graves of armed members of the middle social strata indicate that at the time of the Conquest, military strategy demanded the occupation of the Mezőség, the larger basins (such as that of Háromszék), and both sides of the Maros valley; thus the Maros River could not have delimited the area of settlement or served as a political frontier. This extensive defensive system, designed to repel Pecheneg invaders, was gradually superseded in the course of the 10th century by the military occupation and settlement of the entire Transylvanian Basin. The first permanent Hungarian settlements arose around the saltmines of central Transylvania, along the Maros and Aranyos rivers. They included Gyulafehérvár, which clearly served as a political and military centre, as well as Tordavár, Dobokavár, and some smaller villages along the Maros River; further archaeological exploration is needed to discover the location of other settlements dating from the later decades of the 10th century.
When the Hungarian state was reorganized after 1002, its new settlement policy still focused on the Maros valley. For centuries, that river served as the principal route for the shipping of Transylvanian salt into the country's interior; indeed, the military campaign against Marosvár's ruler, Ajtony, was prompted by his decision to impose a tax on the salt-carrying vessels of King Stephen. Judging from archaeological finds, it seems that the overland 'salt-route' — from Désvár (newly-founded at Transylvanian Szolnok) across the Meszes to Szolnok on the Tisza — came into use only in the later decades of the 11th century. As for the Szamos valley, between Dés and Asszonypataka/Nagybánya, archaeological {1-327.} finds indicate that until the end of the 11th century, it failed to attract significant Hungarian settlement and did not play a major role in linking the two parts of the country. (It had suffered similar neglect in the Avar period).
The Sebes-Körös-Királyhágó-Kis-Szamos route was already in use at the time of the Conquest, but, in terms of settlement, it remained less important than the principal artery, the Maros. The distribution of earthenware cauldrons in Transylvania confirms that this pattern continued to prevail until the end of the Árpádian period.
Until the last third of the 11th century, Transylvania's strategic defence was assured in the north by Dobokavár, in the east by Küküllővár, and in the south by Hunyadvár. The pattern of settlement was particularly dense around these strongpoints, and also around Kolozsvár and Tordavár, but Gyulafehérvár retained its preeminence. Archaeological findings have confirmed the conclusions of linguistic research: to the north, east, and south of this central region, there lay — at the time of the Hungarian Conquest — concentrations of Slavic settlement. In the regions that preserved Slavic toponyms, Slavic settlements survived well into the 11th, and, in some cases, as late as the 12th century.
In the last third of the 11th century, border-guard villages, grouped around small earthworks, were established in southern Transylvania and Beszterce — areas that were later settled by Saxons — to protect the central region. The people who were resettled from Hungary to serve as border-guards came to be known as Székelys. An ecclesiastical structure was implanted in these rural areas during the reigns of Ladislas I and Coloman. By that time, churches and churchyards had begun to appear in other, previously uninhabited districts and former woodlands. The counts' castles served as centres of Christianity — for example, Dobokavár, where traces were found of three early stone churches. However, higher levels of ecclesiastical authority were not put in place east of

the Kolozsmonostor-Gyulafehérvár line until around 1100.
{1-328.} In the 12th century, when the first resettlement of German colonists to Transylvania got under way, the border-guards were progressively relocated to what became known as the Székelyföld (Székely land). Archaeological evidence testifies to the arrival of border-guards in that region. These Hungarians preserved old Magyar traditions that had gone out of fashion in the rest of the country; the importance of their function is attested by their apparel, which in its richness came close to that of their noble countrymen. There is no archaeological evidence in any border-guard village that the inhabitants might have been of Pecheneg origin.

{1-580.} The Religious Culture of Romanians in Medieval Transylvania
Although little is known about the education of Transylvania's Romanian clergy, it is likely that the monasteries at Priszlop and Körtvélyes had a part in it. No scholarly work can be attributed with any certainty to Priszlop, but if the monastery was indeed founded by Nicodim, the monks would have been inspired by that leading participant in the renewal of Greek Orthodox theology in the 14th century.
In the mid-1300s, the Greek Orthodox Church was engaged in a two-front struggle. It tried to counteract the rapprochement between the Byzantine emperors, who were being pressed by the Ottomans, and Rome, by combating Catholic efforts at conversion. It also fought the Bogumil heresy, which had regained strength in the 13th and 14th centuries and, in the guise of Catharism, had spread to Southern France. The Bogumil movement, a successor to ancient Manichaeism, emerged in the 10th century in Bulgaria. Its most distinctive tenet was a dualistic view, of an evenly-matched struggle between good (God) and evil (Satan), which was reflected in society by a struggle between the rich and the poor. However, since Bogumilism also involved mystic meditation and asceticism, it failed to become the ideology of social conflict and, in medieval Bulgaria, it even drew adherents from the higher social strata. Thus it remained primarily a doctrinal problem, and both the Greek Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches persecuted the Bogumils as heretics. The patriarchs of Constantinople and Tirnovo and the Pope urged the Byzantine emperor, the Bulgar czar, and Hungary's king to take up arms against the Bogumils, and occasionally, the monarchs would comply when it served their political interests. Crusades were launched against the Bogumils in the early 1200s and mid-1300s. Bogumilism reached the Romanians as well; there survive copies, produced in the Romanian voivodeship during the {1-581.} fifteenth century, of mystical apocryphal literature (The Visions of Isaiah the Prophet and of Abraham; The Evangel of Nicodemus; Afrodisian's Legend; Enokh's Secret Book) that must have been circulating for many years.
Byzantine monks spearheaded the fight against both Roman Catholicism and Bogumilism. In the mid-1300s, their greatest theologian, Gregorios Palamas, founded the so-called Hesiasta movement, which aimed to take the wind out of the sails of Bogumil mysticism by advocating ecstasy as a substitute for reason, the acceptance of life as suffering, and even the repudiation of life. Thus 'man must not rejoice, for his laughter will turn to tears', and 'a happy man is one who suppresses his will'.[29] The similarity to Buddhism is not coincidental, for, in their campaign against Bogumilism, the Hesiastas propagated the Buddhist-inspired legend of Barlam and Josaphat along with other moralistic popular pamphlets. These works spread to the Romanian voivodeships and, from there, to Transylvania, where they may have been brought by Nicodim, who had professed these ideas in Wallachia. An investigation of the influence of Bogumilism and the Hesiastas, mediated by the clergy, on the Romanian popular culture would lead one into an obscure and uncertain territory; some see traces of it in the famous Miorica Ballad, where the shepherd anticipates death with resigned calm. In any event, Bogumils had made Romanian converts. In the early 13th century, they considered the famous Bulgaro-Romanian czar, Kalojan (also known as Ioniţă), to be one of them, and when he laid siege to Philippopolis, it was the Bogumils who surrendered to him that important Byzantine town. Perhaps it was the Bogumils' Kalojan-cult that introduced to Romanians north of the Danube a widespread magic ritual. At times of drought, people would bury a small clay figure in a wooden box on the river bank, chanting a funeral dirge to call for rain: 'Caloiene, iene / Caloiene, iene / go into the sky and ask / for the rains to fall.'[30]
{1-582.} Tracts bearing of the Bogumils' and Hesiastas' contrasting messages reached Romanian priests mainly by way of the Serbian and Bulgar monks who, in the later 1300s, headed northwards to escape the Turkish tide of conquest. Although the tracts may have had some influence of Transylvania's Romanian priests, the latter's celebrations were dominated by the traditional order of service and the recitation of set biblical texts. Nor did they necessarily stick to a few short formulas recited in Old Church Slavonic. The humble priest, noted earlier, in the village of Kerésztelek reported in 1470 that he had been robbed of all his possessions, valued at 100 forints; the first, and probably most valuable, items on his list were two books. The latter may have been similar in content to two books, of Moldavian origin, that had been donated to the monastery at Felek, and which were basic texts for

religious service: one dealt with rites (1481) and the other with the four gospels (1488). The third essential text was the Psalter. This was translated into Romanian in the early 1500s at the monastery of Körtvélyes; this is evident from the Máramaros dialect found in the earliest Romanian-language sources — the Psalters of Şchei, Voroneţ, and Hurmuzaki.
It was not by chance that the first Romanian ecclesiastical works happened to be translated at Körtvélyes. When, in 1488–90, the Russian bishop of Munkács tried to impose his authority on this monastery, he met with protests from Romanian nobles in the Máramaros. They were rescued by the monastery's patron, Bertalan Drágffy, who was the voivode of Transylvania and came from a Magyarized family in the Máramaros that had converted to Catholicism. In 1494, Drágffy placed the monastery under the protection of the Catholic bishop of Transylvania. The remedy brought new difficulties. There was no formal declaration of union between the two churches, but Körtvélyes had to make concessions on the main, disputed theological issues; the so-called Şchei Psalter, translated at the monastery, follows the Catholic creed in affirming that the Holy Spirit arose not only from the Father but equally from the {1-583.} Son (Filioque). This did not prevent Körtvélyes and the priests who had studied there from preserving Greek Orthodox rites, but they were influenced by the Catholic Church's moves to introduce the vernacular and translate the Bible into Hungarian. It is probably against this background that ecclesiastical literature began to be produced in the Romanian language at Körtvélyes. Further development in this direction came only in the 16th century, under the impact of the Reformation.
The translations at Körtvélyes were nevertheless an important step in the emergence of Romanian vernacular culture, for, previously, the Transylvanian Romanians' religious and secular texts were all in Old Church Slavonic. Slavonic inscriptions can be found on the walls of cnezial churches dating from the early 1400s, and Slavonic notes, written in Cyrillic script, figure on the back of 15th-century letters of nobility granted to cnezial families. The earliest reference to the use of Slavonic language and Cyrillic script by Transylvania's Romanians dates from around 1280, in Simon Kézai's chronicle. He relates that, after the death of Attila, the Székelys sought refuge behind the mountains of Transylvania, where they lived alongside the Romanians and adopted the latter's alphabet. The obvious explanation lies in Kézai's assessment of the Romanians' Slavonic-Cyrillic texts and the Hungarians' runic writing; he was not able to read either of these, but by misconstruing the few Greek and Glagolitic characters that had appeared in the Székelys' Old Turkic runic script, he concluded that the two forms of writing were one and the same. Transylvania's Romanians had a long tradition of writing texts in Slavonic-Cyrillic, first in the monasteries, and then in the earliest known school for laymen. That school had been established by Balkan merchants at Şchei, on the outskirts of Brassó, an important centre for trade with the Levant. The earliest source to mention the school's teacher dates from 1480. The school's written language was Slavonic, but it was probably taught with some Romanian additions, for the first Romanian {1-584.} linguistic relic that can be dated accurately is a 1521 letter (in Cyrillic script) sent by a Wallachian boyar, Neacşu Lupu, from the frontier locality of Cîmpulung to people in Brassó.
Whatever its language, the Greek Orthodox culture of Transylvania displayed a spirit fundamentally different from that of Catholic Hungarians and Saxons. The Roman Catholic Church, dominant in Hungary, would occasionally accommodate papal urgings by attempting to convert the Romanians. It redoubled its efforts after 1204, when, as a consequence of the Fourth Crusade, the Patriarch of Constantinople formally acknowledged Papal authority; in this period, which lasted for over fifty years, the Orthodox rites were latinized. Whatever their success, the attempts at conversion were interrupted by the Mongol invasion, then renewed at the time of the Balkan conquests of Louis the Great. Then, as before, conversion efforts were driven by political considerations and aimed exclusively at the Romanian districts of Severin Province. When Miklós Lackfi, count of Zemplén and a zealous follower of the king, visited Rome in 1358, he obtained the Pope's permission to hold annual parish festivals for three churches which he had built for recently Catholicised (aliqui de novo) feudal tenants on his Romanian-inhabited estates (in medio olachorum); unfortunately, owing to distorted recording by the Papal Chancellery, the localities cannot be identified. The first reliably documented case of conversion, dating from 1366, concerns a certain Sorbán Acsvai, in the Világosvár district. Upon becoming a Catholic, he took the name István and was rewarded by the king with an additional estate (albeit one subject to the sheep tax).
That same year, Louis the Great issued a charter — the real purpose of which has been much disputed acknowledging that cnezes whose property rights were confirmed by royal charters ranked with the nobility, and relegating 'common cnezes' (communis kenezus) to the status of village judges; there is no hint of compulsory

https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/96.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:20:54]
conversion. The king evidently sought the support of the {1-585.} higher, military cnezes for his campaigns against Wallachia and Bulgaria. Soon thereafter, Louis instructed the counties of Keve and Krassó to deliver Slavic or schismatic priests (sclavos sive schismaticos sacerdotes) — without harm (absque omni dampno, lesione et deturpatione) — to the local count, Benedek Himfy, pending his decision on their fate. However, this measure was designed merely to forestall opposition to his war plans, and it had no long-term consequences. Romanian priests in the region carried on with their duties until the end of the Middle Ages. One of King Sigismund's charters, dating from 1428, attributes to Louis the Great a decree providing that in the Sebes district, 'only real Catholics, only those adhering to the Roman faith [...] may hold estates by noble or cnezial right'; however, only a modern copy survives, of questionable authenticity, and history shows that if either Louis the Great or Sigismund ever entertained such intentions, there were no tangible results.
King Louis's charter of 1366 also called for 'the liquidation of malefactors of all nationalities, especially the Vlach' (ad exterminandum et delendum de ipsa terra malefactores quarumlibet nationum, signanter olachorum). This gave rise to the widespread belief that the king aimed to annihilate the Romanian people, or at least compel them to convert to Catholicism, and this as a reprisal for some Romanian peasant rising. This is, to say the least, a naive theory, and the monograph that it inspired has since been dismissed by critics. In fact, Romanians as well as others were involved in various sorts of unlawful activity. Most of the trouble originated with landowners who would dispatch their feudal tenants, Hungarian or Romanian, to loot or occupy neighbouring villages, at times setting Romanians against other Romanians, and Hungarians against other Hungarians. There were also predatory gangs of robbers, Hungarians and Romanians alike. Finally, some Romanian cnezes, particularly in Hunyad county, were indeed 'deprived of their rights'; but the known cases are all successful possessory {1-586.} actions brought by cnezes holding royal charters against other cnezes who held property in customary law — thus, actions that involved only Romanians and had nothing to do with religion.
At the same time, it is a fact that a number of Franciscan friars, particularly in the Bosnian province, burned with proselytizing zeal. They had considerable influence at King Louis's court, and tried to obtain military backing for the forceful conversion of the 'schismatic' Orthodox. The Byzantine emperor, Johannes V Comnenus, came to Rome in 1369 to renew the union between the two churches. Thus encouraged, Urban V issued, in 1378, a papal bull — Dilectionis sinceritas — in which he called upon the temporal powers to help convert the 'schismatics'. The aging King Louis had become preoccupied with Italian affairs, and he was disheartened by the failure of the Balkan campaigns (ca. 1366). To rekindle his zeal, the Bosnian vicar Bartolomeo de Alverna sent him a memorandum some time after 1379, urging him to wage war on the 'schismatics'. Alverna argued that the obstinacy of the Orthodox Slavs and Romanians had to be combated 'with the sword more than with words, and in hard battle'; 'owing to their ignorance, these people have become bereft of religious rites and sacraments [...] and they cannot achieve salvation within their sect.' He quoted the warning issued by Johannes V Comnenus during a visit in 1366 to Hungary: 'The king would be well-advised to convert these Slavs, for they follow neither the Greek nor the Roman rite.' And he even quoted the monks of Mount Athos, who said that those who practised Slavic rites 'are not priests, they are dogs!' If they refused to convert, argued Alverna, they would have to be expelled from the country, and their flock would have to be forcibly Catholicized, for then at least the next generation would become good Catholics. Religious arguments were complemented by a timeless political reasoning: 'Those who adopt a deviant faith and are untrue to God will never be loyal to their lords.' However, such deplorable fanaticism did not sway Louis the Great, for he failed to launch a new {1-587.} campaign of conversion. Nor was it well received by Hungarian landowners, whose interest lay in the settlement of Romanians, and who therefore exercised religious tolerance by allowing the latter to have their own churches and priests. Aware of this hostility, Alverna had warned the king that 'some stupid and indifferent people disapprove and slander the recently-begun saintly works of His Majesty, the King of Hungary [...] i.e. the conversion and christening of the Slavs and Romanians in his lands.'[31]
The tolerance that marked Transylvania's Hungarian landowners sprang more from economic interest than from indifference to religion. In the 15th century, only the Hussites were subjected to religious persecution; they found refuge in Moldavia, where they translated the Bible into Hungarian. True, some of the ennobled Romanian cnezes turned Catholic, but they were motivated by social considerations, not fear: in those days, a different religion would have prevented them from marrying into Hungarian noble families, which, in the event, many of them did. The resulting gulf between ordinary Romanians and their elite was only deepened after Mohács by the institution of 'perpetual villeinage', which also gave the cleavage an ethnic complexion.

3. TRANSYLVANIA IN THE FIFTEEN YEARS'
WAR BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTES
The Balance-sheet of War
The killing had lasted close to fifteen years, yet the balance of military force remained in equilibrium. The more astute of contemporary observers soon drew a fundamental conclusion: the Ottoman empire was past the peak of its expansionist powers. The earlier defeats suffered by the Ottomans might be attributed to the deleterious effect of a long period of peace on their mighty war machine, but their subsequent impotence testified to a more deeplyrooted decline. Their expansionary drive weakened as its geographic scope grew wider; with Don Juan of Austria's victory at Lepanto in 1571, the Christian fleets restored a certain military balance. The Ottoman system thrived on steady expansion, and the signs of weakness were not a temporary phenomenon but the beginning of a long decline. At the time, however, the Habsburgs lacked the strength to take advantage of their opponents' greater vulnerability.
The lessons for Transylvania's future were evoked in István Bocskai's last will and testament:
{1-765.} 'I invite my beloved subjects in Transylvania and in Hungary to come to an amicable agreement. Those in Transylvania must nurture a filial attachment to Hungary even if they come under the rule of a non-Hungarian sovereign. As for the people of Hungary, I entreat them not to alienate the Transylvanians but to consider the latter their blood brothers.
As long as the Germans, a more powerful nation, have possession of the Hungarian Crown, and the Hungarian Kingdom is dependent on them, it will remain necessary and useful to have a Hungarian prince in Transylvania, for he may be able to offer help and protection to those in Hungary. And if, by the grace of God, the Hungarians should regain their Crown, the Transylvanians must not oppose them and break away but offer them assistance and, as in earlier times, subject themselves to the Crown.'[17]
Bocskai thus set down the essential preconditions for the survival of the Transylvanian state, but the basic idea dated back to the era of the Szapolyai dynasty.
The political situation was clearly affected by the decline of Turkish power. In contrast to the declaration made by the feudal estates in the similar circumstances of 1556, Bocskai referred only indirectly to the influence of the Sublime Porte — a change that reflected the secondary role played by Turkish military force in the restoration of the principality. Indeed, the Ottomans themselves doubted whether they could have taken such a step without Bocskai's initiative. Transylvania's slow drift into subjection to the Ottomans in the 1570s was halted by its 'revolt'. Much as in 1551–56, the pashas were compelled to recognize that Transylvania was not Wallachia or Moldavia, and that they would incur great risks if they put too much pressure on the Transylvanians, for the latter were attached to statehood and preserved a Western orientation.
Now more than ever, the reestablishment of the principality was of crucial importance for all Hungarians. The Habsburgs compensated for their relative impotence by imposing arbitrary and unjust measures, and they persisted in waging a fruitless war. These actions imperilled the privileges of feudal society, freedom of worship, and the material survival of a victimized peasantry.
Back in the mid-1500s, the Hungarian ruling elite's instinct for self-preservation drove it to create the Transylvanian state. Now, similarly, it was the Hungarian aristocrats of the region east of the Tisza who revived what many had come to believe was a moribund country. Only later did the Transylvanians themselves join in the process, and necessity played some part in their choice. There were, to be sure, differences of scale and emphasis, but the essence remained unaltered: if Hungarians wanted to avoid becoming the pawns of two contending great powers and seeing their society perish, they had to preserve their odd little state at the eastern edge of the Carpathian Basin. An appalling price was paid in life and property before everyone realized that the earlier balance would have to survive in scarcely altered form.



The Balance-sheet of War

Transylvania, too, suffered heavily on the way to rediscovering its destiny. Although the region came under direct attack only some six years after the outbreak of war, the damage was extensive. By the time the assorted soldiery — Ottomans, Cossacks, Tartars, Serbs, Romanians, Germans, Walloons, Hungarian frontier-guards and hajdús reached the principality, the horrors of war had stripped them of much of their humanity. They were paid less, and less regularly, than in their earlier campaigns. The rampaging soldiers took a terrible toll on the population, as did the plague, famine, and the slavehunts conducted by the Tartars. The consequences are illustrated by demographic data for some districts of Doboka and Belső-Szolnok counties. In the mid-1500s, the population included 17,500 Hungarians, 13,200 Romanians and 2,000 Saxons. By the fourth (but not the last) year of the war, in 1603, the {1767.} number of Hungarians had fallen to 2,500 people, of Saxons to 250, and of Romanians to 7,200. Thus the losses were in the proportion of 85 percent for the Hungarians, 88 percent for the Saxons, and 45 percent for the Romanians!
Of course, these statistics cannot be simply extrapolated to cover the entire region; nor is it clear what proportion of the losses is accounted for by temporary escape, migration, and extermination. The figures do reveal that the ancient settlements of Hungarians and Saxons in the valleys suffered much more from the war than did the Romanians' highland villages, which benefited from remoteness and the proximity of forests where people could hide. Thus the war brought about a change in the ethnic balance. For one thing, while Hungarians and Saxons were being decimated, the immigration of Romanians continued unabated. Confronted with Michael the Brave's prohibition of movement, and then with the restoration of Turkish rule, many of Wallachia's peasants fled to the comparative safety of Transylvania. Some of the deserted villages were repopulated by Romanians. Despite the dearth of statistical data, it is clear that the Hungarian-Székely ethnic group's numerical superiority over the others was reduced.
The immigrants' more primitive farming techniques contributed to a certain regression in Transylvania's agriculture. The war-damaged Saxon and Hungarian villages concentrated their remaining energies on the task of reconstruction, and not on passing on knowhow to the new settlers. The result was a revival of shepherding, sheepbreeding, and simpler forms of cultivation. Since the profitability of estates depended largely on the level of agricultural productivity, the changes had a negative impact on Transylvania's economy. Manpower became even scarcer, for the more mobile Romanian peasants could not be readily tied down to a place of work.
The war had two further negative effects on the economy. One was the huge expense of the endless warfare. As long as {1-768.} Transylvania enjoyed a semblance of internal peace, its rulers tried to maximise their revenues from normal sources. The taxation of villeins grew steadily heavier. Before the war, the average tax per household was 3 forints; the tax rose to around 5 forints in 1595–97, 6 forints in 1598, and 12-16 forints in 1599, during the reign of voivode Michael; in 1600, it stood at 9, and in 1601 at 8 forints. These oppressive levels of taxation only aggravated the impoverishment of the peasantry, to the point that in 1603, the revenues extracted from the villeins of the seven counties added up to no more than 3100 forints.
When this source began to dry up, Transylvania's government tried to compensate by raising more revenue from the towns. The 'loans' extracted by Voivode Michael have already been noted. What followed was even worse, and a Saxon observer's report, dating from 1604, is illuminating:
'On 21 January, Gáspár Gert and his detachment of some 55 Walloons took up quarters in Segesvár. They stayed there until August, and, in that brief period, 32,000 forints had to be spent to cover their maintenance. The quartering of Captain Salamon and his troops cost the village of Báld 31,141 forints. Kézd had to disburse 38,561 forints for Ferenc Hersel and his men. Our own municipality had to spend 15,766 forints on the French blue troops.'[18]
These vast sums far surpassed the amount needed for the mercenaries' wages; officers and ordinary soldiers were all intent on lining their pockets, and no one dared to refuse their demands. There were reports that over the brief period of Giorgio Basta's rule, Brassó and its district had to pay him over 350,000 forints. Rumours — probably exaggerated — had it that when the general departed, his private booty amounted to two tons of gold and silver.
{1-769.} Even before these events, Transylvania suffered from a shortage of cash. Much of what was paid to the soldiery left the country, as did the booty amassed by the voivode Michael and General Basta. Thus the country's modest assets were depleted not only by the wrecking of agriculture but also by the extensive pillage.

The Székelys' revolt and the reprisals taken by the voivode Michael as well as by Giorgio Basta took a heavy toll of the Hungarian nobility in Transylvania. From 1594 on, successive waves of executions decimated the political elite. The Székely problem, always latent, was allowed to erupt. And, as power passed from hand to hand, the system of crown domains that had been painstakingly erected by the princes fell to pieces, completing the process of disintegration. By the time Basta came on the scene, only eight of these fiscal domains remained, at Lugos, Jenő, Déva, Fogaras, Gyulafehérvár, Lippa, Karánsebes, and Szamosújvár; and the last three were close to worthless, in part because they served as frontier forts, but mainly because their agriculture had been destroyed. (Karánsebes, for instance, was left with only two villages.)
Bocskai managed to restore the province to statehood, and his rule was acknowledged even by the Saxons, but Transylvania's economy, social structure, and interethnic relations had been profoundly altered. The country was poorer and more vulnerable than at any time since the establishment of the first principality. Bocskai was a tough soldier, and his military achievements earned him both respect and fear. If fate had granted him time, he might have been able to pull Transylvania out of the coma induced by the bloodletting. In the event, the great prince survived his crowning achievement, the two peace treaties, by only a few months. He died at Kassa on 29 December 1606, at the age of 49. Grieving hajdús reacted by slaying the chancellor, Mihály Káthay, whom they suspected of having poisoned their leader. And Transylvania was left to search for a new sovereign.

On the rationale for further research into the history of Transylvania, see István Rácz, 'Történetírói lehetőség és kötelesség', Zsigmond Pál Pach, 'Miért írunk Erdély történetét?', and Károly Irinyi, 'Tudatcsere kellene', in Tanulmányok Erdély történetéről, ed. by István Rácz (Debrecen, 1988), cited hereafter as TET. For the Romanian criticism, see 'The Conscious Forgery of History under the Aegis of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences', The Times (London), 7 April 1987; Norman Stone's review article appeared in The Times Literary Supplement, 2 October 1987.
The History of Transylvania was assessed at a historians' conference in October 1987; the conference material was published in TET.
Studies of the Saxons' origins have appeared both in Hungary and abroad. Among foreign studies, see, in particular, Konrad Schünemann, Die mittelalterliche deutsche Kolonisation (Viert., 1934) and Günther Franz, Geschichte des bauernstandes vom frühen Mittelalter bis zum 19 Jahrhundert (Stuttgart, 1970).
Studies on the origins of the Romanians focus on two basic and related themes, the so-called Daco-Roman theory of continuity and the location of their original homeland. The Daco-Roman theory finds full application in Constantin Daicoviciu, Stefan Pascu, et al., Din Istoria Transilvaniei I-II (Bucharest, 1964), published in Hungarian as Erdély története, ed. by Miron Constantinescu (Bucharest, 1964). This work continues to serve as a valid reference on the Romanian approach to some key questions, for the line taken in Romanian historiography has not changed since its publication. On the evolution of the Daco-Roman theory, see Gábor Vékony 'The theory of Daco-Romanian Continuity; The origin of the Romanians and the settlement of Transylvania' (The New Hungarian Quarterly, XXIX: 110, Summer 1988). The text of the 1791 petition can be found in Supplex Libellus Valachorum, trans. by Károly Köllő (Bucharest, 1971). Recent Romanian works on the question of ethnic origins include L. Bârzu, A román nép anyagi és szellemi műveltségének folytonossága az egykori Dacia területén (Bucharest, 1981) and Ion I. Russu, Etnogeneza românilor (Bucharest, 1981).
Research on the Jews of Transylvania was reinvigorated in 1990, when two scholarly conferences were held in Cluj/Kolozsvár; the conference {1-774.} material was published in Studia Judaica, ed. by Ladislau Gyémánt, Pompiliu Teodor, and Maria Radosav (Cluj-Napoca, 1991).
The cited Romanian works on Gypsy history are Georgi Potra, Contributioni la istoricul tiganilor din România (Bucharest, 1939), and Joana Ursu and Valeriu Budunu, 'Tiganii: Un popor îsi cauta istoria' (Magazin Istoric 1-4). The data on the number of Gypsies in 1786, published originally in H. M. G. Grellmann, Historischer Versuch über die Zigeuner (Göttingen, 1786).

Contents
'Forest People': The Goths in Transylvania The Huns. The Kingdom of the Gepids The Period of Avar Rule The Slavs. Southern Transylvania under Bulgar Rule Transylvania in the Period of the Hungarian Conquest and foundation of a State
The most important written sources include Auxentius, Ammianus Marcellinus, Jordanes, Corippus, Paulus Diaconus, the Annales Regni Francorum, the Annales Fuldenses, the Gesta Ungarorum, P. Magister, Vita S. Gerhardi ep., and the founding document of Garamszentbenedek. I have consulted the original texts, and quoted, where necessary, from the original. In his work Die Goten und Skandinaven (Berlin, 197O), R. HACHMANN attempts to distinguish the sources used by Jordanes. For Constantinus Porphyrogenetos, I have used Gyula MORAVCSIK's classic edition and translation, Bíborbanszületett Konstantin, A birodalom kormányzása (Budapest, 1950). For Procopios, I used Otto VEH's edition and German trnslation, Prokop, Gotenkriege (Munich, 1966). For the Byzantine sources of early Avar history (Protector Menander, Euagrius, Theophylactos Simocatta, Theophanes), the compilations and translations by Samu SZÁDECZKY-KARDOSS were of great help: 'Hitvalló Theophanes az avarokról' (AT 17: 1970), and 'Az avar történelem forrásai I-VIII' (Arch. Ért. 105: 1978, 1984). Some of the quotes from the legend of St. Gellert are based on Flóris SZABÓ's translation in Árpád-kori legendák és intelmek (Budapest, 1983).
The following selections from archaeological literature include a few of the shorter overviews, works that survey particular cultures, 'horizons', or regions, compilations of important documets, on individual cultures or field of research, and significant interpretive studies.
{1-778.} The archaeological syntheses of Kurt HOREDT have the value of source works, for they present reasoned groupings of finds ('find-horizons'). The first in this vein was 'Völkerwanderungszeitliche Funde aus Siebenbürgen' (Germania 25: 1941). His excellent monograph, Untersuchungen zur Frühgeschichte Siebenbürgens (Bucharest, 1958) includes information on Roman provincial burial places in Transylvania, on late Roman and 10th-12th century cemeteries at Gyulafehérvár/ Karlsburg, on Gepid finds (including the first register of these), and on the Old-Bulgar finds at Maroskarna as well as questions related to Bulgar rule (another first); the work also offers a list - 'metal finds from the 10th-11th centuries' - of cemeteries and grave finds in Transylvania dating from the period of the Conquest and the early Árpádian epoch. Published concurrently, his Contribuţii la Istoria Transilvaniei, Sec. IV-XIII (Bucharest, 1958) contains a good catalogue of Avar sites in Transylvania and much new data on finds; however, his analysis of the circulation of Roman currency after 270 is methodologically flawed and unconvincing, and the same applies to his elaboration of the 'stages' of Hungarian feudalism in Transylvania, which cannot be reconciled with finds and documentary sources. Another work, one of great utility, is his survey of 7th-12th century pottery, focusing on grave finds of intact vessels and earthenware cauldrons ('Ceramica slăva din Transilvania' [SCIV 2/2: 1951]).
There are problems with the analysis in a collective work, Relations between the Autochthonous Population and the Migratory Population (Bucharest, 1975), for most of the authors seem dedicated to demonstrating the validity of the title's premise. The book does contain very useful hard data presented, notably in Mircea RUSU's essays 'Avars, Slavs, Romanic population in the 6th-8th centuries' and 'The Autochthonous Population and the Hungarians on the Territory of Transylvania in the 9th-11th centuries', which include maps and notes. Rusu compiled the later 4th and 5th century finds in 'Cercetări arheologice' (MNI 7: 1984). Several of his publications

deal with the population and history of Transylvania in later periods, the most recent one being 'Frühformen der Staatsentstehung in Rumänien' (Zeitschrift für Archäologie 18: 1984). Rusu's works are marked by thoroughness but suffer from a major flaw: ignoring much of the critical reassessment, published during the past century, of documentary sources, he treats both Anonymus's fictionalized chronicle from the early 1200s, and Simon Kézai's late-13th century chronicle as solid history, to the point that he adapts data from the 9th-10th centuries to fit this mold. R. HEITEL uses the same sources and consistent 'filius {1-779.} ante patrem' dating in 'Unele consideraţii privind civilizaţia din Bazinul Carpatic în cursul celei de-a doua jumătăţi a secolului al IX-lea în lumina izvoarelor arheologice' (SCIVA 38: 1983).
Early Medieval settlement in Krassó-Severin and Temes counties are surveyed in L. MĂRGHITAN, Banatul în lumina arheologiei 3. Secolele VII-XII. e.n. (Timişoara, 1985). Mărghitan selects his sites and claims that most of them harbour (undocumented) earthen hovels dating from the '8th-10th', '9th-11th', or '10th-12th centuries'. Considering that an earthen hovel was not habitable for as much as 30 - let alone 300 - years, his conclusions are of little value.
I drew heavily on József HAMPEL's classic syntheses, although I always checked his data with the original publications, which remain the basic source. His works include 'A honfoglalási kor hazai emlékei', in A magyar honfoglalás kútfői (Budapest, 1900); Alterthümer des frühen Mittelalters in Ungarn I-III (Braunschweig, 1905); and Újabb tanulmányok a honfoglalási kor emlékeiről (Budapest, 1907).

Narrative sources that cover the entire period include Scriptores rerum Hungaricarum tempore ducum regumque stirpis Arpadianae gestarum I-II, ed. by E. SZENTPÉTERY (Budapest, 1937-38), which also contains the 14thcentury revisions; Catalogus Fontium Historiae Hungaricae I-III, ed. by F.A. GOMBOS (Budapest, 1937-38); Johannes Thuróczy, Chronica Hungarorum (Brünn, 1488), translated into Hungarian by L. GERÉB, (Budapest, 1957) and J. HORVÁTH (Budapest, 1978); Historiae Hungaricae fontes domestici I-IV, ed. by M.

ENDLICHER (Sanktgallen, 1849), which includes the 'Regestrum of Várad').
On documentary sources, the most comprehensive collection of material concerning medieval Transylvania is the series Documenta Romaniae Historica, C. Transilvania (Bucharest, 1951-81). The first six volumes, compiled by several editors, cover the period 1075-1350; the two volumes for the 1351-1360 period were edited by Şt. PASCU. The work includes extracts - translated into Romanian - of previously published documents (with bibliographic references) as well as a few additional, Latin documents, published and unpublished, in the appendix; the collection covers not only Transylvania but also the eastern regions of Hungary annexed to Romania in 1920. This collection does not diminish the utility - particularly with regard to the critical apparatus - of some other publications concerning Transylvania: Urkundenbuch zur Geschichte Siebenbürgens, ed. by G.D. TEUTSCH and F. FIRNHABER (Vienna, 1857), covering the period up to 1301; Urkundenbuch zur Geschichte der Deutschen in Siebenbürgen I-III, ed. by F.R. ZIMMERMANN, C. WERNER, and G.MÜLLER (Hermannstadt, 1892-1902), covering 1191-1415, and two further volumes, covering 1416-1457, ed. by G. GÜNDISCH (Hermannstadt, 1937, and Bucharest, 1975); Székely oklevéltár I-VII, ed. by K. SZABÓ and L. SZÁDECZKY (Budapest, 1872- 98), covers the period 1211-1750, and supplementary material dating from 1219 to 1776 was edited by S. BARABÁS (Budapest, 1934); documents dating up to 1400 are found in Documenta historiam Valachorum in Hungaria illustrantia, ed. by A. FEKETE-NAGY and L. {1-784.} MAKKAI (Budapest, 1941). Zsigmondkori oklevéltár I-II/12, ed. by E. MÁLYUSZ (Budapest, 1951-58), contains some documents dating to 1410 that are missing from the above collections. Additional post-1360 documents concerning Transylvania can be found in the following general collections: Codex diplomaticus Hungariae ecclesiasticus et civilis I-XLIII, ed. by G. FEJÉR (Buda, 1829-44), which covers the period to 1440; Mór CZINÁR, Index alphabeticus (Pest, 1866), is a guide to the previous publication; Hazai okmánytár I-VIII, ed. by I. NAGY et al., (Budapest, 1865-1879), covers 1068-1627; Hazai oklevéltár, ed. by I. NAGY, F. DEÁK, and Gy. NAGY (Budapest, 1879), covers 1234-1536; Kiadatlan oklevelek, ed. by M. WERTNER (TT 1908-11), covers 1260-1733; and Magyar erdészeti oklevéltár I-III, ed. by K. TAGÁNYI (Budapest, 1896). Further documentation can be found in county archives (Alsó-Fehér, Fo-garas, Hunyad), municipal archives (Beszterce, Brassó, Kolozsvár, Nagyszeben), private archives (notably those of the Bánffy, Batthyány, Csáky, Kállay, Károlyi, Lónyay, Révay, Teleki, Tholdaghy, Thorotzkay, and Zichy families), and church archives (the monasteries of Gyulafehérvár and Kolozsmonostor, and Saxon chapters); for a guide to these sources, see Domokos KOSÁRY, Bevezetés a magyar történelem forrásaiba és irodalmába I (Budapest, 1951), pp. 12-17).
The following surveys of Transylvanian history in medieval and modern times include only the earliest, along with some more recent ones that retain their utility. The earliest scholarly surveys are those of László KŐVÁRY, Erdély

The best general sources on the period are the relevant volumes of EOE and the Székely oklevéltár (see above).
The most important narrative sources include István Szamosközy's works (MHH-S 21, 28-30: 1876-1800, Budapest), of which excerpts, in Hungarian translation, can be found in Erdély története (Budapest, 1963); the series Monumenta Hungarica and Pro memoria (Budapest, 1981); the works of János Baranyai Decsi (Czimor), in MHH-S 17: 1866 (Pest); Ambrus Somogyi's Historia rerum Ungaricum et Transyvanicarum 1490-1606, in SRT II (Nagyszeben, 1840); Farkas Bethlen, Historia de rebus Transylvanicis 1-6, (Cibinium, 1782-93); Ferenc Mikó's history (MHH-S 7: 1863, Pest); as well as the works of Sebestyén Borsos and his Ferenc Szabó Nagy, in Erdélyi Történelmi Adatok I (Kolozsvár, 1855).
The selections, translated into Hungarian, in Erdély öröksége II-III are also relevant to this period.
In Erdély és a Porta (Pest, 1862), László SZALAY offers valuable information on Transylvania's turbulent external relations and their domestic impact. The records of the Jesuits in Transylvania were edited by Endre VERESS in volumes 1-3 and 5 of FRT (Budapest, 1911-13, and Veszprém, 1921). Veress also edited the correspondence of Alfonso Carillo, in MHH-D 32 and 41 (Budapest, 1906, 1943); further information on the Jesuits was published in 'Monumenta Historica Societatis Jesu', Monumenta Antiqua Hungarica I-III, ed. by L. LUKÁCS (Rome, 1969-81). Basta's letters were published by E. VERESS in MHH-S 34 and 37 (Budapest, 1909, 1913).
There is no detailed, monographic account of the period or of the long war. Some more general information can be found in SZILÁGYI, Erdélyország története; KŐVÁRY, Erdély története; ACSÁDY, 'Magyarország'; the relevant chapters in G. and Fr.

Gepidic Kings in Transylvania
https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/36.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:22:54]
Gepidic Settlement in Transylvania 3. THE KINGDOM OF THE GEPIDS The Gepids in the Period of Merovingian Culture
Gepidic Kings in Transylvania
If high-ranking military men settled their families in a ring around Napoca, it was because after the Szilágysomlyó period, Gepidic rulers had chosen to base themselves on the site of that ancient town. They dwelt within the city walls, probably in a restored building, just as the Alamanic and, later, the Baiuvaric princes had done at Castra Regina (Regensburg). However, they buried their dead not in Napoca, but on the site of the present-day village of Apahida, on the terrace of the Kis-Szamos; and they conducted funerals in secrecy. What remains the most important Gepidic grave was discovered in 1889; the coffin, with iron clamps, was in a despoiled state. Most of what is known about the grave was established in the original assessment. The grave yielded a finely-wrought, late-antique Byzantine gold fibula with bulb- shaped button and filigreed decoration; it was virtually identical to the one found in the tomb of the Frankish King Childeric I (who died in 481 or 482). It can be concluded that these were presents from the Eastern Roman imperial court to barbarian princes who were regarded as being of roughly equal rank. However, the princely grave at Apahida also yielded two elaborate silver jugs, a type of Eastern Roman present that was absent from Childeric's grave. Yet another object in the grave, a solid gold bracelet, was one of the distinctive badges of Germanic royal families from the 3rd–5th centuries {1-199.} onwards. The true status of the occupant was indicated most conclusively by a find that remains unique to this day: six large gold pendants, decorated with boar heads. Since these objects subsequently disappeared, it is impossible to determine how they might have been worn. The original report on the find compared the pendants with the hanging ornaments on the votive crowns of the Visigothic King Reccesvinthus; alternatively, the pendants might have ornamented large fibulae or glass vessels. A cloisonné gold buckle and gold handles from the prince's cups reflect the 'international' style of the 5th century, but they are clearly products of same Gepidic goldsmith's workshop where certain other finds had been crafted, notably the buckles and cup handles in the 2nd grave at Apahida, some of the treasure jewels in Szamosfalva, the birdshaped cloisonné ring found at Nagyszentmiklós-Keresztúr-puszta, and the ring, adorned with a bull's head, that was unearthed at Brassó or at Kolozsvár. There can be little doubt about the date of the grave. Close replicas of the ornamental fibula have been found in Italy, and coins as well other accompanying objects date these around 490; the replica in Childeric's grave was interred in 481–82. The first grave at Apahida therefore dates from the period between 454 and 500.
The name and the rank of the grave occupant can be deduced from three gold rings. The engraving on one of them, a large cross formed by four small, symmetrical crosses, indicate the owner's Christian faith. Constantinople must have been aware of this affiliation, for the ornamental fibulae that had been sent as a gift bore a plate clearly engraved with a long cross; among similar gold fibulae, only one, found in Rome, bears such a cross. On the second ring, the name OMHARIVS — with the letter R and I linked — appears under a small cross. The third, a signet ring, bears a cross and, in what may be Greek mirror writing, the name OMARIVS or AVD-OMARIVS, which corresponds to that on the second ring. Written sources make no mention of a Gepidic historical personage {1-200.} bearing this name. The second half of the name may well be derived from the Gothic word harjaz (meaning 'Heer', or army). Since the monogram could also be read as Audomharius, an authentic East Germanic name is revealed: Audomharjaz — (Aud) Omharius in latinized form, meaning 'lord of the army' or 'saviour of the army'. Such a name could have been assumed by only one Gepidic king (cf. the names Ardaric, 'king of the lands', or Gunderith/Gunderiks, 'king of the warriors'). The conclusion, that the ring's owner was a king, is reinforced by the names of the Frankish king Chlotharius (Lothar) and the Alamanic king Hariobaudes; the former signifies 'glory of the army', and the latter 'destroyer of armies'.
All this was made considerably more problematical by the discovery in 1968 of a second princely grave at Apahida, some 500 meters away from the first. Once again, the west-east oriented grave had been despoiled along the upper half of the corpse. It yielded a cloisonné buckle, somewhat larger than the one in the first grave, but otherwise identical, as well as a glass goblet with gold hoop, and a cloisonné cup handle; thus the two burials couldn't have been far apart in time. The rich finds in the second grave gave a clue to what might have been stolen from the first one. The prince's sword sling — for he wore a sword, and probably, so had the occupant of the first grave — was covered with cloisonné gold plates. On his belt, the prince had worn a purse of cloisonné gold, of

which only the cover plate remained. The only identical purse to be discovered was in the world-famous ship grave of Readwald (deceased 625), King of East Anglia, at Sutton Hoo; a somewhat similar gold-covered purse was found in Childeric's grave. An iron-bound wooden trunk next to the body contained three sets of harnesses, including a saddle adorned with superb cloisonné and gold eagles, bridles covered with rosettes and eagle head patterns, and gilded bits of Hun inspiration. The yield from the second grave was much richer than from the first, but that is no guarantee that the {1-201.} deceased had been of more exalted rank; the grave held neither insignia to indicate his status, nor personalia (such as rings) that might have identified him. Since neither grave was discovered intact, prudence must be exercised in considering the question of missing objects.
In 1979, a large cloisonné gold clasp was found at a secondary location between the first and second graves. To be sure, the clasp might have been originally in one of those despoiled graves, perhaps the second. On the other hand, the attire of contemporary princes usually included only one large cloisonné buckle, and a similar if lighter clasp was found in each of the two graves. On balance, there are grounds for suspecting that a third princely grave had been present at Apahida before it was despoiled without trace.
Discovered in 1963 on the northern bank of the Kis-Szamos, halfway between ancient Napoca and the princely graves of Apahida, the find treasure of Kolozsvár-Szamosfalva offers both complications and a possible explanation. The treasure lay in a vessel buried a few centimetres deep. The finders cut up some of the jewellery, and held back many items; what remained amounted to 'merely' 617 grams of gold. The outstanding piece is a splendid gold necklace holding a large gold ornamental disc. This brooch-like disc bears clear Christian signs: the obverse is decorated with a cloisonné, symmetrical cross, and a similar cross is engraved on the reverse. Another necklace was made of gold beads, of the same type found in the rich Gepidic woman's grave at Gáva and in the second princely grave at Apahida. The buckles with oval plates and frames are similar to the three buckles from Apahida, and also found were fragments of at least two solid bracelets, with expanded ends, similar to the gold bracelets found in the second grave at Apahida. The gold rings also found at Kolozsvár-Szamosfalva match those from the 'queen's' grave of Bakodpuszta (probably of members of the Skirian King Edika's family, buried prior to 470), in the so-called Olbia treasure, which included a large ornamental {1-202.} disc, hanging on a gold chain, similar to the one discovered at Szamosfalva); they also match rings found in a more modest Alamanic noblewoman's grave dating from the second half or the end of the 5th century. Another important item in the treasure is an ancient gold ring decorated with a gem.
There are countless parallels in the finds at Apahida and Szamosfalva, and all of them confirm that the precious objects represent an opulent 'international' style which had evolved in the Hun period and continued to flourish thanks to an ample supply of gold — until the end of the century. This grandeur is more or less typical of all the barbarian rulers and aristocrats of the period, but it is most characteristic of the Gepidic kings, who had defeated the Huns and appropriated most of their treasures.
The 'riddle' of Apahida and Szamosfalva can be solved. Among European princely graves dating from the half century following the Hun period, only that of the Frankish King Childeric is comparable to the one at Apahida, and the comparison is eloquent. No comparable Gepidic traces have been found outside Transylvania, nor any other Gepidic royal graves. Like the great Hun kings, or the Frankish, Ostrogothic, and Alamanic kings of the times, the Gepidic kings did not reside in a permanent 'capital' but had several residences, or regiae. The summer and the winter regiae of the Gepidic kings evidently lay far apart, one somewhere in the plain stretching along the Tisza, the other in the mountains and valleys of Transylvania. The connection between the regiae, the palatia, and the royal burial grounds remains unclear. For instance, Childeric I, at the moment of his death, was no longer king of the Frankish foederati around Turnacum, but the king of Gallia-Belgica. Yet he was buried — in secrecy and isolation — in the land of his youth, far beyond the walls of the late Roman town, on the other side of the river. Similarly, the regia of Napoca was undoubtedly only one of the royal courts, with the kings' burial places nearby. A gold ornament discovered at Palánk, in the southern {1-203.} part of Temes county, was decorated with garnet cloisonné, set into partitions that cover the entire surface — a type that as far as is known was exclusive to the costume of Gepidic princes after the Hun period; it is similar to ornaments, shaped like violins or fish, that were found at Apahida, and thus indicates that, in the second half of the 5th century, Gepid princes had one of their residences near the mouth of the Krassó River.
The princely richness of the finds at Apahida, the royal insignia, and the probable date of internment all evoke the

possibility that the graves are those of the Ardarikings. This suspicion would be confirmed if it turned out that more recently discovered gold buckle — similar to the cloisonné gold buckles in the first two graves — did not come from those graves but, instead, was the misplaced remnant of a third royal grave at Apahida that otherwise had been totally devastated. The Gepidic kings were buried at Apahida between 470 and 500; and written sources name two kings in that period, Ardaric, who founded his empire in 455 and evidently reigned for some time afterwards, and Gunderith, who reigned around 500. Conceivably, (Aud)Omharius, the occupant of the first grave, is in fact one of these kings; but it is more likely that the name belongs to a Gepidic monarch, not mentioned in written sources, who reigned some time between Ardaric and Gunderith. The establishment of a new dynasty by Elemund could well have driven a fleeing Ardariking to conceal his family jewels at Szamosfalva. By the beginning of the 6th century, the regia of Napoca as well as surrounding manor houses stood abandoned, and this could hardly have come about without some forceful intervention.

Archaeological Traces in Transylvania of the Hungarian Conquest
7. TRANSYLVANIA IN THE PERIOD OF THE HUNGARIAN CONQUEST AND FOUNDATION OF A STATE
Monasteries, Churches, and Churchyards
The Settlement of Transylvania in the 10th and 11th Centuries
Two Transylvanian cemeteries, discovered and excavated in 1910–12, proved to be of immeasurable value to archaeologists interested in that region and, more particularly, in the life of ordinary people at the time of the Conquest and in the early Árpádian period. The two cemeteries were closely related, and they also displayed links with the graves — some of which included harnesses or the remains of horses — of the 'middle class' from the Conquest period. Both could be dated from funeral obuli. Thanks to these two cemeteries, contemporary archaeologists who studied Transylvania could remain free of the 'Bjelo Brdo' bias: an ill-founded notion that 'row graveyards' had belonged, not to Hungarian commoners from the time of the settlement and of the Árpáds, but to the 'conquered' Slavs. Moreover, the same two Transylvanian cemeteries {1-304.} provided an excellent base for understanding — without ethnic bias — the composition of the lower strata who lived in Hungary at the time. In fact, the ethnic outlook that characterized the 19th and 20th centuries would have seemed almost incomprehensible back in the 10th and 11th centuries.
The first of these important sites was the section of a cemetery at Várfalva-Váralja, overlooking the valley of the Aranyos River. This was, in fact, an early burial ground of the first castle at Tordavár. The early objects found at the south end of the cemetery, which had a north-south alignment, were typical of 10th-century Hungarian attire: double-pendant collar ornaments, cast costume jewelry and buttons, silver and bronze buttons from short fur jackets, torques made of twisted wire, and bracelets, some flat, others decorated in the shape of animal heads. A rhombus-shaped arrowhead, placed in a grave as a talisman or as a token of rank, evoked the 'Magyars' arrows' that had terrorized Europe in the 10th century. On the other hand, in the northern part of the cemetery, the distinguishing feature is the funeral obuli that had been placed in the mouth or hand of the deceased: a central group of graves, which yielded coins from the time of Stephen I (five graves, of which four were of the obulus type), Peter, and Samuel, were surrounded by a set of seven graves containing coins (nine in all) from the age of Andrew I. The coins from Ladislas I, found at the graveyard's edge, indicate the latest burials on the site. Clasped hands testify to Christian burials in the age of the monarchy, as do the simple jewels of the early Árpádian period: bronze hair-rings with tips bent into an S-shape, rings, plain or twisted wire bracelets, and torques fashioned from smooth and thick bronze wire. There is no trace of pagan food offerings, nor of pots or weapons.
The other cemetery, in the vineyard at Vajdahunyad-Kincses, belonged to the first castle — yet to be researched at Hunyadvár. The excavated section, consisting of 78 graves (of which 21 were found despoiled), yielded only faint traces of the 10th century: a {1-305.} rhombus-shaped arrowhead, a metal button, a ring, a jacket button, a flattened, Byzantine bronze coin that had been pierced to hang on a necklace, and a man's skull that, in pagan fashion, had been trepanned. At the centre of the excavated section, four graves yielded funeral obuli from the time of Saint Stephen (Stephen I); graves situated southward held coins dating from Andrew I, while others, farther north, contained coins from Béla and Solomon, along with simple, 11th-century jewels.
Two social strata, partly overlapping in time, materialized in the Transylvanian Basin. The earlier one, the 'middle class' of the 10th century (identified with the 'pagan' graves, complete with horses and weapons) was eliminated by the central power no later than the beginning of the 11th century. The other stratum, which left its traces in graves such as the one at Várfalva-Váralja, lived on undisturbed in its villages and continued to use the cemeteries after the advent of the Christian monarchy; they were valued as taxpayers, manpower, and devout Christians.
There are cemeteries all over Transylvania that are linked to this popular culture, which evolved in two phases. Its 10th century, 'Várfalva' phase is marked by a number of finds: the later graves at Magyarlapád; the older finds at Maroscsapó (twisted torques, bridle, pot, bracelet) and at Maroskarna, which came from other cemeteries; a bracelet with animal head from the Torda region; a cemetery section of 45 graves, situated on a hill southwest of Torda- Tündérhegy; a carved bronze ring ornamented with a bird figure, twisted torques, an earring, and a bracelet, found in graves at Alvinc-Borberek; the 15–20 graves, of 10th-century origin, uncovered so far at Marosnagylak;



The Settlement of Transylvania in the 10th and 11th Centuries
https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/54.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:23:04]
and, at Zeykfalva, the graves dated by coinage from Stephen I. The chance find at Vecel of a 10th-century, lyreshaped clip that must have come from a grave, also belongs to this category, as do some of the rhombus-shaped arrowheads that were uncovered in commoners' cemeteries. The distinctive, and often masterfully wrought arrowheads have turned up at several {1-306.} certified sites of Hungarian settlements, dating from the 10th–11th centuries, in Transylvania: Angyalos, Sepsiszentgyörgy-Bedeháza, Sespsiszentgyörgy-Eprestető, Csernáton, Doboka, Malomfalva, and Marosgombás. Thus the more sporadic finds of this object (at Csáklya, Hari, Magyardécse, Nyírmező, Torda, as well as at Vajasd, where a 10th-11th century pot was also found) are presumably traces of nearby settlements or cemeteries.
A number of other cemeteries have been dated — mostly by 11th-century coins — as being contemporary with the one at Vajdahunyad: Bágyon, Betlenszentmiklós, Borosbenedek (a bracelet, and a set of six hair clasps, bearing a ribbed pattern, and with S-shaped tips); Dés; Déva (traces up to Ladislas I); Kelnek, Kozárvár, Marosvásárhely; Marosszentgyörgy (hair ring, pot); Máramarossziget (two hair rings); Radnót, [Sajó]sárvár, and Szék. The roots of the cemeteries at Zabola and Petőfalva can also be traced back to this period and type of graveyard. These cemeteries are distributed relatively evenly over the territory of Transylvania.
The survival of the centres associated with princes, clan chiefs, and clans in the 10th century deserves careful consideration. In this respect, medieval Kolozsvár is a poor example, for the commoners' cemetery that it must have had in the 10th-11th centuries remains undiscovered, and only the miserable hovels uncovered in Libucgát Street offer some evidence of continuous settlement.
On the other hand, at Gyulafehérvár, archaeological finds accurately reflect the castle's importance in the late 10th century and thereafter. The military power of the gyula is evoked by the bronze tip of a scabbard that once held a 'Viking', or rather a Byzantine sword. In the 10th and 11th centuries, at least four or five cemeteries were established on either side of the ancient Roman walls. Although none of them has been fully excavated, the graves and objects so far discovered attest to the importance of the site. The castle's earliest grave with horse held 10thcentury bridle fixtures. The site of a Roman necropolis, located southwest of the castle, {1-307.} holds the burials of succeeding cultures, notably Slav funeral urns and skeleton-graves dating from the Bulgar period. Finds indicate that the site was used by Hungarians from around 1000 (an iron-bound quiver holding flat, rhombus-shaped arrowheads, as well as twisted-wire torques, bracelets — some of cast metal and bearing animal-head decoration, rings, and earrings) until the middle of the 12th century (funeral obuli dating from the time of Béla II and Béla III). A third cemetery was located northwest of the Roman walls, in Zalatnai Street. The few graves initially discovered held stirrups, torques, hair rings, rings, pots, and a trepanned skull. More recently, an additional 180 were excavated, dating from the 11th–12th centuries, and holding earrings, hair rings, buckles, arrowheads, and obuli from the age of Andrew I, Béla I, Solomon, and Ladislas I. Hair rings and other rings were found in a fourth cemetery situated near Mamut Hill. The fifth cemetery to be reported is a commoners' graveyard, dating from the 11th century, and situated south of the castle, although it may be the same as the one superimposed on the Roman necropolis; it is said to hold some 10th-century graves as well, with braid ornaments in the form of filigreed bronze disks, silver earrings with grape-bunch pendants, and even horse bones.
All the signs point to continuity. The pottery in the sunken hovels that were excavated, mostly around the cathedral, on the citadel's land, evokes the pottery found at, say, Fehérvár, in Transdanubia; the jugs, pots, and earthenware cauldrons were similar in shape and decoration to those, dating from the Árpádian period, found in other parts of Hungary. Christian burials were conducted from the 10th to the 12th centuries around the rotunda that stood on the site of the present cathedral, and later around the first episcopal church. Some graves were discovered around the latter church a long time ago, and dated by coins from the time of Coloman to that of Béla III and Andrew II; more recently, many additional graves were found, and they yielded 12th century jewels (roundheaded metal hairpins, rings, and late-period hair rings).
{1-308.} The 19-metre long section of a church was recently excavated at a distance of some 32 metres from the present cathedral's western facade, but the details have yet to be published. The alignment of the uncovered apse and nave corresponds to that of the cathedral that stood there at the time of Saint Ladislas, but the church could not have been standing when construction began on the cathedral, for the latter's cemetery cuts across the foundations walls of the church. The earliest grave in the cemetery is dated by a coin from Coloman's time, the others by hair rings with S-shaped tips and by an obulus from the time of Géza II (1141–1161). A Hungarian grave with horse,

containing a heart-shaped harness ornament, was discovered under the little church, signifying that the latter had been founded no later than 1000.
Substantial memorials testify to the existence of other centres of power in the 10th–11th centuries. Dobokavár castle, which overlooks the valley of the Lóna, a tributary of the Kis-Szamos River, was evidently named after its first master, who had also owned an estate in Fejér county (Doboka-puszta). Doboka's son, Csanád, defeated Ajtony while serving as one of Stephen I's generals. The gigantic fortress was probably the centre of the defensive network built in Transylvania during the Árpádian period; it was eventually reconstructed in stone. The excavated finds on the site (apart from prehistoric and 8th-century Slavic items) date from around 1000: rhombus-shaped arrowheads, plain torques with a square cross-section, torques and bracelets made of twisted wire, a fragment of a foal's bridle, and iron fire-starters. These objects, which had belonged to ordinary people, are dated by a halfmoon shaped pendant similar to those, dating from the end of the 10th century, that were found in cemeteries at Szolnok airfield and Szob-Koliba. The pottery found in the lower level of the site (level I) is also from this period; it includes such distinctively Hungarian objects as a 'Saltovo' jug with ribbed neck and earthenware cauldrons. The castle had been rebuilt and enlarged through at least three or four historical {1-309.} periods. The ornamental silver pendants of the 'Darufalva type', which were crafted in Byzantium or in a Russian workshop in Kiev, date from the end of the first period. Coins and other precious objects of Polish, Russian, and Bulgar provenance (from 26 treasure troves) — including silver beads from a similar workshop — clearly date this excavation level to the last decade of the 10th, or the first decade of the 11th century. The later levels (II–IV) and periods are marked by pottery that reflects the development of this craft in Hungary through the Árpádian era, as well as by 11th and 12th century spurs, a feathered arrowhead, and the fragment of a 'Majs type' pectoral cross. The excavations thus confirm what other historical sources indicate: the original Dobokavár had been built as a count's (ispán's) castle at the time when Stephen I developed the county structure of administration. Its extensive cemeteries and churchyards — details of which have yet to be published — indicate that its golden age was in 11th and 12th centuries.
The feudal castle, surrounded by earthworks, at Malomfalva was probably also built around 1000. The arrival of the Hungarians, and the castle's antecedents at the end of the 10th century, are indicated by a double-edged sword (with a sabre-type hilt), a 10th-century, heart-shaped bronze button (Hula), and rhombus-shaped arrowheads.
Historiography and archaeology have followed separate paths in investigating Transylvania's political-military centres in the period of the Conquest and foundation of the Hungarian state. Since relatively few early records survived, historians have had to draw inferences from later sources. The pitfalls of this method are best illustrated by the case of the 'two Kolozsvárs'.
Excavations in the main square (Szabadság tér/Piaţa Libertăţii) of modern Kolozsvár — conducted by János Herepei (1927), István Méri (1943), I. Mitrofan and István Ferenczi (1948, 1958, 1961) — revealed no trace of the 11th–12th century settlement; V. Vătăşianu's search in the óvár (old castle), in 1956, proved {1-310.} equally fruitless. A few relics of the Middle Ages were discovered in the course of construction work in the main square in 1871, and during the canalization work in the inner city in 1895, but most of the finds were of Roman origin: coins (up to Philippus Arabs) as well graves and remnants of buildings. The earliest archaeological traces of urban life around 1200 were found in the layer of humus covering the ruins of the ancient Roman town (a fallen column, Roman debris with 2nd and 3rd century coins); the humus held only insignificant signs of settlement dating from the early Middle Ages. The cemetery of a 12th-13th century church — which, buried under the foundations of St. Michael Cathedral, is the oldest church known to have existed in Kolozsvár — was found installed in the upper level of the Roman layer. The graves yielded a few objects dating from the late 12th and early 13th centuries: latetype hair-rings, hairpins with silver, disc-shaped heads, silver buttons from short fur jackets, a silver-gilt disk pendant with loop, and a worn obulus. There are no archaeological traces of continuous settlement between the destruction of Napoca and the turn of the 13th century.
The count's castle that gave the county its name is situated one-and-a-half kilometres west of the city's centre, in present-day Kolozsmonostor. It is mentioned in a document dating from 1341: 'quod quia monasterium Beate virgins de Kluswar fundacio sancti regis Ladislai exstitit'. Thus the name Kolozsvár was originally given to the hill on which the monastery was built. This is the site that is referred to in 12th century documents as castrum Clus, the seat of the comes Clusiensis.



The Settlement of Transylvania in the 10th and 11th Centuries
https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/54.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:23:04]
The castle, though much diminished by the ravages of time, remains imposing, measuring some 220 by 98 metres at its base. Only part of its earthen ramparts, 12–13 metres high, remain. The cuts through the ramparts and the excavations inside the castle, carried out it 1970–82, brought results that were both surprising and reassuring. The ramparts, which had two layers, concealed the remnants {1-311.} of an earlier fort constructed of earth and wood beams. Inside the castle walls, the foundations were found of sunken dwellings. Fragments of broken pottery in the earthworks and the houses clearly date from the 10th and 11th centuries; three items, a cast-metal pendant from the time of the original Hungarian settlers, an early earthenware cauldron, and a denarius (found in the late 1900s) dating from St. Stephen indicate with some precision that the first fort was erected around the year 1000.
The three Solomon coins that were unearthed in the ruins of a burned house point to the likelihood that the first fort and settlement had been destroyed by fire during the Pechenegs' incursion in 1068. When the fort was reconstructed, its earth-and-beam wall was raised by three metres; the dwellings within the walls were not rebuilt. Burials ceased — or were forbidden — in the semi-pagan cemetery that dates from the 10th–11th centuries and lies to the south of the fort.
The new ramparts sheltered the counts' residence and served exclusively military purposes, but Ladislas I settled Benedictine monks on the premises. By the end of 11th century, the monks had raised the three naves of the Church of the Blessed Virgin (contemporary with St. Aegidius [St. Egyed]'s monastery in Somogyvár) and probably a monastery building as well. The castle's people, who lived outside the ramparts, were served by the new church and a Christian cemetery. The numerous obuli, found in the more than 150 graves that have been excavated so far, date from the time of Andrew I, Ladislas I, Béla II, Géza II, and Béla III. The graves yielded objects hair-rings with S-shaped tips, rings, beads, pressed costume jewelry, and a round buckle fibula — that were similar to those found in Hungary's other churchyards dating from the 11th and 12th centuries. The richness of the graves is striking: over a third of them contained jewelry or money. However, this 'richness', found also in other Transylvanian churchyards, belies the relatively backward, archaic economic, social, and religious conditions that prevailed in the region.
{1-312.} The first Kolozsvár fort was destroyed during the Mongol invasion, by which time the first monastery might have been replaced. There are indications in the cemetery that, by the end of the 12th century, construction had begun on a new building, although it cannot be ascertained whether it was finished by 1241.
Art history was greatly enriched by the discovery of a hexagonal 'round chapel' of the Karcsa-Kiszombor-Gerénytype; it had been raised on the foundations of the late 11th-century monastery. Since the foundations included capitals and carved double plinths dating from around 1100, the round chapel could not have been built before the very end of the 12th century. This find therefore also serves to correct the previous, earlier dating of similar round chapels.
The phenomenon of the 'two Kolozsvárs' recurs in the case of Tordavár. The founding document of Garamszentbenedek, in 1075, mentions a castrum, quod vocatur turda on the banks of the Aranas (Aranyos) River, between present-day Torda and Torockó. The previously-noted graveyard at Várfalva was the first burial place of this fort's inhabitants, a fact confirmed by the reference to Turdawar alias Varfalwa vocata in a document dated 1394. The well-preserved earthwork measured 100 by 190 metres at the base; archaeologists have excavated several cross-sections of its ramparts, but their finds and conclusions have yet to be published. In the fort's later period, the walls had been rebuilt in stone.
The situation is similar in the case of another previously-noted cemetery, at Vajdahunyad, which bears no relation to the later castle of the Hunyadi family. Instead, it was linked to the original Hunyadvár — an earthwork, surrounded by ramparts, that has not been excavated, but which is similar to the forts of Kolozsvár and Tordavár. The fort of Küküllővár (castrum cuculiense, 1197) is situated on a promontory overlooking the marshy floodplain along the south bank of the Kis-Küküllő River. The original, oval ramparts were largely obliterated, first by the construction of a castle in the {1-313.} late Middle Ages, and then by recent building projects. There is no sign, either on the site or in written works, that excavations were ever conducted on the site. As far as is known, the only finds on the site of the fort are a few silver rings dating from the late Middle Ages.
The fort of Sárvár, on the Sajó River, is considerably smaller than the counts' forts; it was probably owned by clan chieftains, and in the early Middle Ages by feudal lords. Sárvár, like Dobokavár and Kolozsmonostor, is encircled

by two lines of ramparts which at one point had been rebuilt and raised. In both periods, the early Árpádian technique had been used in raising a cross-structured beam wall on the earth ramparts. Since the ground below the earlier earthworks, which may date back to the 10th century, yielded no potsherds, it may be concluded that there was no former settlement on the site. The foundations of partly-sunken dwellings were uncovered inside the fort, similar to those at Kolozsmonostor, Biharvár, and Gyulafehérvár; the pots, vessels, and earthenware cauldrons found there date from the late 10th and 11th centuries. The second period of the fortification and settlement is indicated by easily-identifiable 11th-century fragments as well as by the 11th and 12th century objects (hair-rings, both small and quite large, with S-shaped tips, as well as beads and rings) found in the adjoining graveyards.
The presence of costly foreign swords and sword-fragments, dating from the 10th century, identify a number of forts as belonging to rulers, counts, or feudal lords, and their military retinues. This is the case at Dés, Nagyernye (two swords?), Malomfalva- Szentjános, Gyulafehérvár, Déva, Biharvár, and Arad-Csálya. Such finds are particularly common in the Temes region: at Kübekháza and Keglevichháza, both near Marosvár, at Zsombolya (near Temesvár), at Szászkabánya-Téglavető, near Krassóvár (from a grave), at Versec, Kevevár, and, last but not least, at Orsova. Another ('W-Z-X') type of Western sword,also from the 10th century, {1-314.} has been found in the Temes region, at Törökbecse and Nagybecskerek. In fact, more swords have been found in the Temes region than in the entire region between the Danube and Tisza rivers, including the old Bács region.
Research based on archaeological finds points to the conclusion that the warriors who bore late Western swords had been part of the new army (militia) raised by Prince Géza or of the miles-stratum (iobagiones, i.e. serfs); and that they had been buried, as late as the beginning of the 11th century, with ancient pagan rites. However, the same scholars ignored the unpublished finds of swords, or graves holding swords, in the region stretching from Kübekháza to Orsova. They concluded that this 'blank area' had revolted against Prince Géza (the country of black Magyars, the home of Ajtony's rebellion) and had been sealed off by sword-wielding knights who were settled by Géza along the right bank of the Maros and Tisza Rivers.
In fact, Géza's miles-stratum was as strongly in place in this dangerous, southern border zone as at the gates and gyepűs around the Felső-Tisza, Bodrog, Rába, and Danube rivers. Only after Géza's death did the rebellious Ajtony, 'backed by his many soldiers and nobles', turn against King St. Stephen ('Confidens in multitudine militum et nobilium').[23] If, as is claimed in the Gellért Legend, Ajtony's authority extended to the Körös River (a fluvio Keres), then the onetime domain of this prince of Marosvár holds more graves of soldiers with double-edged swords than any other region of Hungary, except for the Esztergom-Székesfehérvár-Óbuda triangle. And that would support the contention of the legend's author, that Ajtony 'surpassed the others with his multitude of warriors'.

Transylvania under King Stephen Báthori
When, in 1571, Stephen Somlyói Báthori occupied the throne left vacant by John Sigismund, he did not content himself with safeguarding his predecessors' political legacy. He also took bold initiatives to hold back the forces intent on destroying Hungary. The new prince's father, also named István, had served as King John's voivode in Transylvania between 1530 and 1534. Thanks to the elder István, the family had emerged from the shadow of the senior, the Ecsedi Báthori branch (from which sprang the Palatine István and the Transylvanian voivode András), which gave its loyalty to the Habsburgs. During his tenure as voivode, the elder István augmented the family fortune, adding the vast estates of Szatmár and Szinyér to their castle at Somlyó (the source of the nobiliary surname). Through marriage, his children acquired part of the property of the Várday and Drágffy families (which died out at mid-century) as well as some fragments of the domains of the Ecsedi Báthori branch. By the mid-1560, they had become the wealthiest family east of the Tisza.
It was the voivode's youngest child, Stephen junior, who would play the greatest role in this turbulent period of Transylvania's history. He was born in 1533, and by the early 1540s he was already serving as a page, first to the Archbishop of Esztergom, Pál Várday, then at the royal court in Vienna. The year {1-647.} 1549 found him in Italy, where he visited Padua, a favourite destination of Hungarian students, and became imbued with humanistic culture. These early experiences may also help to explain why Stephen Báthori would never feel attracted to the Reformation.
The political changes of the mid-1550 drew Stephen back to his homeland. With the return of Isabella, the Báthori estates were once again on Szapolyai territory, and Stephen was chosen to greet the queen on behalf of the feudal estates. In 1559, he received from Isabella his first major assignment, the captaincy of Várad castle, the Partium's governing centre. Báthori also played a significant role in John Sigismund's diplomatic undertakings and battles to take over fortresses. His name is associated with one of the Transylvanians' greatest military successes: in 1564, he led a surprise attack to seize Szatmár and Németi, properties that his family had obtained from King John, only to lose them on the occasion of Menyhárt Balassa's defection in 1561. (On the other hand, in 1562, he lost the battle of Hadad.) In 1565, while on a diplomatic mission for John Sigismund, Báthori was charged — in circumstances that remain unclear — with violating international law, and he languished for two-and-a-half years in Emperor Maximilian's jail in Prague.
Upon his return, Báthori vied with Gáspár Bekes for Maximilian's favour. The latter finally decided to back Bekes, who was largely responsible for the Speyer agreement; yet the chief beneficiary of that treaty turned out to be Báthori.
Stephen Báthori's wealth, popularity, and energy all helped to propel him onto the princely throne. Disagreement within the feudal estates flared up once again during the period of transition, when Bekes renewed his plotting, but the determined Báthori succeeded in drawing the most important figures to his side. In 1573, the conspiratorpretender had to flee the besieged Fogaras like a solitary wolf and headed straight for Prague. At the battle of Kerelőszentpál, in 1575, the tide turned in favour of Báthori when {1-648.} he was joined by Kristóf Hagymássy, formerly one of the executors of John Sigismund's testament (who were known as the 'testament lords'). This victory was not only a decisive moment in Transylvania's history; in enhancing Báthori's fame, it contributed to the decision of Poland's nobility to choose him as their king — in preference to Emperor Maximilian, who was backed by the magnates.
Báthori's accession to the Polish throne had a further, historic consequence: it brought respite in the conflict that had raged for fifty years between the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom, now the Principality of Transylvania, and the Habsburgs.
Stephen Báthori was the most enlightened and far-seeing Hungarian statesman of the later 1500s. In his capacity as

a landowning aristocrat in the Partium, he acquired direct experience of the misery and humiliating constraints brought about by Ottoman domination, and he learned the lesson well. In 1567, he remarked to one of Maximilian's confidants that 'the Ottomans will not allow just anyone [to become ruler of Transylvania]; His Majesty will be well-advised to find an influential person who, at the opportune moment, will be able to help reannex Transylvania to Hungary.'[11]
Báthori was not a man to entertain illusions. He would observe that 'the Turkish emperor's army does not pick strawberries to put them in someone else's basket.' His experience of the latest Turkish campaign (1552–1566) taught him that even if a definitive victory was beyond the reach of the Ottomans, they remained the mightiest protagonist on Hungary's battleground.
To be sure, this was not a novel observation. Prince Stephen adopted the policy of King John I and György Fráter, although he may have applied it more consistently, and to greater effect. The element of continuity was noted not only by Turkish potentates who dealt with Báthori, but also by the prince himself; when he refused to extradite Bálint Balassi, he evoked the example of the two Szapolyai kings.
{1-649.} Two factors had determined the policies of the late John Szapolyai. Officially, he construed Ferdinand I's intervention as a foreign attempt at conquest, but in reality he acted as the lawful, anointed king defending his crown against an armed rival. Later, his opposition was aimed at a neighbour who had been shown to be impotent, who had promised assistance but only managed to infuriate the Ottomans. György Fráter had pursued what he believed to be the logical solution to this quandary, and met a tragic end.
Stephen Báthori was justified in noting that since 1532, every Hungarian attempt to break out of the dilemma had rested on Habsburg support, and had failed. This realization led him, in his capacity as Transylvania's voivode, to adopt the strategy detailed earlier: to ostensibly accommodate the Porte while covertly pursuing other orientations. His reward was the same accusation that had been levelled by uncomprehending observers against György Fráter: 'They depict me, at their convenience, as a German or as an Ottoman.'[12]
The acquisition of the Polish crown endowed Báthori with far more power than that enjoyed by his predecessors. The second half of the 16th century was the Golden Age of Polish feudalism. The ruling strata drew unprecedented wealth from the production and export of grain. Only the inherited weakness of the political system prevented Poland from becoming the leading power in Eastern Europe. Báthori represented the Transylvanian political model, one in which the central authority could transcend feudal interests and govern with greater effectiveness.
The new king might have adopted another country, but he continued to regard himself as Hungarian. His underlings were understandingly offended when on one occasion, in 1577, he let slip a remark that God had created him to serve not the Poles, but the Hungarians. It was a different question whether, and how, he intended to use his new-found power on behalf of his homeland.
Europe was briefly shaken out of its long indifference to the Turkish problem when, on 7 October 1571, Don Juan of Austria {1-650.} won a great naval victory at Lepanto. The success raised new hopes, especially in Italy, which felt directly threatened by the Ottomans. However, within three years, the latter had rebuilt their strength and restored the balance of power in the region. Spain's support grew weaker, and Venice lost her colonies one after the other until, in 1573, she was compelled to make peace with the Sublime Porte. Meanwhile, in France, the Massacre of St. Bartholomew (24 August 1572) set off the wars of religion.
Only the Papal court continued to cling to the idea of victory over the Ottomans. Pope Gregory XIII had backed the Habsburgs over Báthori in the contest for the Polish crown, hoping to strengthen the former against the Ottomans. When the voivode, thanks to Maximilian's procrastination and his own nimbleness, was elected king, the Holy See found itself in a rather awkward spot, though relief soon came in the form of Maximilian's sudden death on 12 October 1576. (King Stephen, for his part, proceeded to introduce the Gregorian calendar in Poland.)
The first regular contact was established in 1577, when Laureo, the papal nuncio, invited Poland to join in the formation of an anti-Ottoman league. Báthori's response was unambiguous: he offered, on behalf of Transylvania, 40,000 soldiers if the league materialized, but made no commitment whatsoever on behalf of Poland. In 1579, the new nuncio, G.A. Caligari, returned to the attack, once again dangling the prospect of a league. The King temporized until the outbreak of the Spanish-Portuguese War compelled the Pope to withdraw his proposal.

In 1581, it was Báthori himself who issued a call for all Christians in eastern Europe to march on the Ottomans, but this was only a straw in the wind, inspired by rumours of Emperor Rudolph's illness. King Stephen broached the subject once again, in August 1582, with the nuncio, Father Bolognetti. This time, circumstances played into his hand, for the Ottomans had renewed their offensive and were threatening Venice's most important {1-651.} islandcolony, Crete, and both Philip II and the Pope were thinking about forming a defensive alliance. When Bolognetti reported on the positive answer of the Holy See, Báthori unveiled his precondition: he was prepared to join the league only after the Papal See, Venice, and Spain had come to an agreement.
That, however, was momentarily out of the question, for the 'most Catholic king' and the merchant republic were not prepared to cooperate. The Pope nevertheless persevered with the scheme. In 1584, the King of Poland insisted that Emperor Rudolph should first pledge himself to the cause, then came forward with an entirely new idea: abandoning his demand for the West's direct support, he proposed that the Holy See help him to conquer the Grand Duchy of Moscow. With this in hand, he would rally against the Ottomans all of Eastern Europe, as well as the peoples of the Caucasus. (The plan, which had been maturing in his mind for a year, was communicated on 24 April 1584, in Lublin, to the papal representative, the Jesuit Antonio Possevino.) After almost six months, Rome declined. In the meantime, the death of the Valois Crown Prince prompted the Protestant King of Navarre, the future Henry IV, to lay claim to the throne of France; and Spain was girding to punish England (three years before the defeat of the Invincible Armada). Understandably, the Holy See considered that there was little hope of raising substantial help for the defence of eastern Europe. Báthori was in no mood to give in. He dispatched his nephew, Cardinal András Báthori, to the Holy See, and turned for assistance to Possevino, who in the meantime had fallen from favour. In the summer of 1586, the two negotiators obtained an agreement in principle (as well as a token commitment of 25,000 ducats) from the new Pope, Sixtus V. Shortly after receiving the good news, King Stephen fell ill. His visionary plan unrealized, he died at Grodno on 12 December 1586.
The seriousness of these plans is open to question. For a hundred years, Europe's major powers had talked of antiOttoman {1-652.} leagues and great military campaigns, but most of this served only propaganda purposes. An examination of the Polish King's policies towards the Ottomans offers more grounds for scepticism. When he was voivode, his conduct of relations with the Porte was marked by extreme caution, and the same could be observed in Polish-Turkish relations. When Polish Cossacks raided the sultan's domain, the king recalled them and had the more disobedient put to death. And when the Ottomans expelled the Moldavian voivode Ivan Podkova (in 1578) and the Moldavian pretender Jankula Saso (in 1582), the King of Poland had them beheaded.
The Christians' perfunctory planning exercises hardly required such extreme caution. In fact, the motive can be found not on the European level but in Poland itself. For one thing, Báthori owed his election as king partly to the endorsement of the Sublime Porte. Moreover, he — much like other monarchs of that era — was free to pursue his own foreign policy but had to bow to the feudal estates in other matters, such as public finances and declarations of war. Finally, Báthori had pledged to respect a set of conditions, the famous Pacta conventa, drawn up well in advance of the royal election; and one of these was to preserve peace with the Ottomans.
Long experience had taught the Poles not to test their strength against that mighty adversary. In any case, the Baltic region, or Russian and Prussian affairs were of more immediate interest to Poland. Their aversion was so strong that, for years, King Stephen did not dare to raise the question of a Turkish war. The secrecy and procrastination over the Papal proposals of 1577 and 1579 were not due to some personal quirk of the monarch.
Báthori had been accustomed to wholly different conditions in Transylvania, and he once allowed himself to complain about the constraints on his authority; he cited the catastrophe in Hungary as an example of what happens when a country is led by both a council and a senate, particularly when the two quarrel. The solution eluded him. Like Hungary's onetime King Matthias, Báthori {1-653.} enjoyed little popularity in his own time. The enthusiasm over his election soon dissipated, and when he tried to exercise tighter control, the feudal estates turned against him. Jan Zamoyski, whom he drew from the middle nobility to serve, first as his personal secretary, than as his chancellor, came to be almost universally despised. The Zborowski brothers, who had played a leading part in his election, led a revolt against him, and when, in his customary manner, Báthori punished their disloyalty with execution in 1584, there were countrywide protests.
Báthori was ultimately able to still internal dissent, but foreign policy problems left him little breathing space.

Having been elected against the Emperor's wishes, his relations with the Habsburgs and the Catholic German princes remained tense for a long time. Danzig (Gdańsk), the prosperous commercial center at the mouth of the Vistula, refused to bow to his rule, and the war to secure the town's submission (1576–77) ended in a rather ambiguous peace settlement. The Protestant German princes who sided with Danzig never became friendly neighbours.
After the Danzig affair came Báthori's biggest test: the Grand Duchy of Moscow, which for some fifty years had been pushing the Polish-Lithuanian border westward. Tsar Ivan IV (the Terrible) had exploited the chaos following Sigismund Augustus's death to extend his conquests. In three major campaigns, between 1579 and 1581, Báthori managed to inflict heavy defeats on Ivan, but a definitive victory eluded him. Poland's feudal estates won the Pope's forceful endorsement for their demand for peace, and, on 15 January 1582, Báthori was compelled to accept the treaty mediated by the papal nuncio, Possevino. It was after this event that Báthori got the idea of linking the expulsion of the Ottomans with his proposed acquisition of the Russian throne. Initially, the Polish nobility was violently opposed to his war plans, but, by 1586, the mood was changing, particularly among the Lithuanians. Death prevented the king from realizing his plans.
{1-654.} There is no doubt that in his heart of hearts, Stephen Báthori wished to drive the Ottomans out of eastern Europe. However, he was too astute politically to commit his energies to an enterprise that was militarily hazardous and would bring him little advantage in the domestic and foreign policy arenas. He tried to bring about more favourable conditions, then ran out of time.
With regard to Transylvania, Báthori's acquisition of the Polish crown brought significant change only in the nexus with the Habsburgs, who moved beyond simple acknowledgment of the principality's existence. The burden of a conflictful relationship with the Habsburgs followed Báthori from Transylvania to Cracow and Wilno. Both Maximilian and Rudolph made reconciliation conditional on full implementation of the Speyer accord, i.e. on full acknowledgment of their sovereignty over Transylvania. Báthori, on the other hand, wished to retrieve the family property at Szatmár and Németi, which he had lost in 1564–65, and he would not consider making concessions that went beyond his original, secret pledge of allegiance. The Pope, aided by Possevino, attempted to mediate, but in vain. Only in 1585 was some progress made regarding Transylvania, when the Báthori family received Nagybánya as compensation. In 1584, Báthori refused to renew the Polish-Habsburg peace treaty that had been drawn up after Maximilian's death, on the grounds that negotiations over Transylvania were still pending.
The Habsburgs' failure to break his rule in Transylvania and Poland inspired Báthori to speculate about the prospects of the Hungarians: 'If God would have mercy on us and recalled your present emperor and king [i.e. Rudolph], who I believe is ailing, then you could elect your sovereign freely and without any trouble [...] as long as we could obtain from the Turkish Emperor that instead of harassing this wretched remnant of our lands, he offer it his protection'.[13]
Plainly, Báthori regarded himself as a possible successor to Rudolph as the king of Hungary. He would evoke this prospect on {1-655.} several subsequent occasions, during talks with the nuncio Caligari, at a time when the emperor was gravely ill, and also in letters to his Hungarian followers.
This reorientation brought Transylvanian policy back to the objectives pursued by King John I in 1528–32. If Báthori's plan, devised independently of the Habsburgs, to expel the Ottomans is taken seriously, then it went beyond the earlier version; if, on the other hand, he aimed to avoid any provocation of the Porte while challenging the Habsburgs in Hungary, then the plan was more modest than that of King John. In any event, the most significant feature of Báthori's plan was that it envisaged reunifying Hungary under the shadow of the Porte. This strategic conception would have long life, being subsequently adopted by Gábor Bethlen as well as Imre Thököly. Evidently, Stephen Báthori, voivode and king, continued to pursue a policy that encompassed all of Hungary, and not just Transylvania.
The pattern of governance in the principality is consistent with all this. Native Transylvanians were still largely excluded from government. The extinction of the Drágffy and Várday families, the territorial losses resulting from the contest for fortresses, and the reconciliation between the two branches of the Báthori clan left no aristocrats in Transylvania — apart from the princely family. The positive aspect of this situation was that after the initial turbulence, Báthori would not be confronted with powerful rivals. On the other hand, the disappearance of

https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/105.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:23:15]
aristocratic magnates left a vacuum in the structure of power, and this had to be filled.
Predictably, it was Báthori's relatives who came to the fore. The office of voivode was assumed by his older brother, Kristóf, then handed down to his son Zsigmond. (Zsigmond would also bear the official title of palatinus Transilvaniae, but this was in fact a Polish honorific, and did not denote 'palatine' [in Hungarian, nádor].) Since Zsigmond was still a minor when he inherited the office of voivode, Stephen Báthori ordered the establishment of a governing council; its members included Zsigmond's uncle, István {1-656.} Bocskai, and two more distant relatives, Dénes Csáky and László Sombori. Concurrently, old Transylvanian families that earlier had been overshadowed by the oligarchy of aristocrats came to play a more prominent role, chief among them the Kendi family (Sándor Kendi soon joined the governing council), as well as the Bánffy and Apafi families.
However, the key functions of government remained in the hands of men of a different ilk, for Transylvania enjoyed little autonomy during Báthori's kingship. Foreign relations were conducted exclusively by King Stephen, from Cracow or Wilno. In home affairs, the voivode Kristóf ruled with some autonomy, but the three-member governing council served merely to implement the directives of a 'Transylvanian chancellery' in Cracow.
That chancellery was headed by Márton Berzeviczy, who came from Upper Hungary, and his deputy, first Farkas Kovacsóczy, then Pál Gyulay. Back in Gyulafehérvár, the post of chancellor was held until 1575 by Ferenc Forgách, a Hungarian aristocrat (and ex-bishop) who came from Habsburg Hungary. Imre Sulyok, a Báthori relative, succeeded him for a short term. When Kristóf Báthori became voivode, the chancellorship was given to Farkas Kovacsóczy, who originated from Slavonia. Thus Transylvania's government was largely in the hands of 'outsiders', men who had no roots in Transylvanian society, and whose authority was derived wholly from their service of the prince. They were united less by their origins than by a certain common culture. Most of the personnel in the chancelleries — including Forgách, Berzeviczy, and Kovacsóczy — had, like Báthori himself, studied at Padua. (So did Báthori's foremost Polish supporter, Jan Zamoyski.) Padua was under the authority of Venice, and that prosperous merchant-republic had long ago learned how to coexist with the Ottomans. At the University of Padua, Báthori's future officials had not only assimilated European culture but also learned the utility of friendly relations with the Ottomans. They were thus prepared to follow the prince's lead with sincere enthusiasm.

{1-731.} Society and Culture
As the focal point of Hungarian political life shifted to the principality, Transylvania became in the late 16th century the true center of the Hungarians' intellectual and material culture. The Reformation had spread across the Hungarian lands, but the coexistence of many denominations that marked Transylvania had no parallel in the Habsburg counties. Indeed, Transylvania was unique in Europe for the variety and legal equality of its religious denominations.
It is another question whether Transylvania's particularity had an impact on the rest of Europe. In the early phase of the Reformation, the mid-1500s, the eastern Hungarian Kingdom served essentially as a receptive environment for religious renewal. Thanks to Honterus and the early Hungarian reformers, Luther's fundamental theses steadfast adherence to the Holy Writ, the belief that faith is the only way to salvation (sola fide), the rejection of priestly celibacy, confession, fasting, pilgrimage, and, last but not least, the use of the vernacular in church services — were transplanted to Transylvania with only the minor modifications necessary to accommodate local conditions.
Transylvania's leading proponent of Calvinism, Péter Melius Juhász, applied the founder's teachings — notably with regard to predestination and the significance of Holy Communion — with exemplary rigor. Indeed, this bishop of the region east of the Tisza became one of the most creative theologians of his time; although he followed the basic guidelines set by his forerunners, he did not shrink from engaging in doctrinal debates, and was particularly critical of Zwingli. The divisions among Europe's Calvinists were overcome thanks to the formula elaborated by the German reformer Heinrich Bullinger in The Second Helvetian Faith; accepted by Melius and endorsed by a synod at Debrecen in 1567, this became the Hungarian Calvinists' definitive doctrine.
{1-732.} The religious renewal rested on high-level contacts, for Hungary's and Transylvania's reformers kept in close touch with Wittenberg and Switzerland. A Saxon reformer, Martin Hentius, facilitated contact between Bullinger and Honterus, and the latter received the personal sanction of Luther, Melanchton, and Bugenhagen for his work Reformatio. It is noteworthy that in the Hungarian lands, Calvinism came to based principally on the teachings of Béza (Théodore de Bèze), Bullinger, and Musculus (Wolfgang Müslin); Calvin himself had no personal contacts in either Hungary or Transylvania.
Miguel Servet's unsettling notions were conveyed to Transylvania by his disciples. Jacobus Palaeologus evoked a universal religion that would make peace among monotheists, that is, between Jews, Christians, and Moslems. Johann Sommer proclaimed that the foundations of a faith had to be understandable, and therefore logical. However, it was a Transylvanian intellectual, Ferenc Dávid, who provided a theological elaboration and synthesis of Anti-Trinitarianism and drew believers into a single denomination; and thus Transylvania became the historic fountainhead of several denominations, including the Unitarians and the Baptists.
There was an element of spontaneity in the acceptance and development of Protestant doctrines in Transylvania. Especially in the early stages, one finds little evidence of state intervention. It came as an unpleasant surprise when, on 17 September 1571, Stephen Báthori introduced a form of press censorship by requiring that all written works be submitted for government approval prior to publication.
In fact, Transylvania's rulers exerted a significant influence over religious issues. The creation of an independent state, a perception of intellectual and moral crisis, and the struggle against the arch-Catholic Habsburgs at first induced a spontaneous interest in Protestantism, and then led (as in the case of Péter Petrovics) to a deliberately pro-Protestant policy. The patience of John Szapolyai {1-733.} may have been superseded by the aggressiveness of György Fráter, but even the latter stopped short of resorting to any religious persecution. Many felt Fráter's wrath, notably Orbán Batthyány, Mihály Csáky, the Barcsai family, Gáspár Drágffy's widow, and several city councillors, but seldom to the point of losing their lives. (One who did was a Nagyvárad clergyman, burned at the stake for having slapped a woman who was kneeling before a religious statue.) Nor did subsequent rulers adopt a markedly

https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/116.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:23:26]
different approach; a case in point is Stephen Báthori's artful intervention to isolate Romanians from the Reformation.
The rulers' influence was manifested more through force of example, buttressed by their great moral authority. In the early stages of the Reformation, the support of a local notable was sufficient to sustain a particular denomination. But the Reformation's youngest offshoot, Anti-Trinitarianism, could find security only when John Sigismund himself gave it his endorsement — and this despite the fact that Ferenc Dávid was head of the Hungarian Protestant Church in Transylvania and pastor of the flourishing town of Kolozsvár.
On the other hand, it would be misleading to assert that the last great waves of religious reform in Transylvania were propelled by individual caprice. The spread of Anti-Trinitarianism doubtless owed much to John Sigismund's keen interest in theology, but the young prince, with his questing spirit, was a child of the times and of Transylvania. The tactical shifts of an impulsive and wilful mother scarcely served as a sound political education. To be sure, those sudden shifts mirrored the profound dilemmas facing Transylvania. Hungarian society dreamed of unity and lived the reality of fragmentation; it felt itself part of Western Christianity, yet was forcibly distanced from that world; and it was both embraced and deserted by the rest of Europe. An awareness of these circumstances accompanied Hungarian statesmen throughout the 16th century. John Sigismund was born to be a king, and from {1-734.} an early age he was taught that he would have to assume responsibility for his country. He had to suffer through the disintegration of Hungary and the destruction of traditional values. From his PolishItalian mother, he had inherited the intellectual freedom of the Renaissance, and from his father, a Turcophile policy that facilitated the foundation of Transylvania. Arguably, all this predisposed him to accept the innovative theology of Blandrata: that colourful Italian physician applied the same analytical tools to resolve some basic contradictions of Christian belief and to transform the Moslems — despised as pagans, and regarded as an unavoidable evil — into a fraternal people. Nowhere else in Europe did the Anti-Trinitarians find such an eminent patron. Much as the prince's personality reflected the fledgling state's society, so did the systematized form of Anti-Trinitarianism mirror a distinctively Transylvanian mentality.
The divergence between individual will and social forces became more apparent during the reign of Stephen Báthori. In his election-oath, Báthori, although a fervent Catholic, had promised freedom of worship to all recognized Christian denominations (that is, Catholics, Calvinists, Lutherans, and Anti-Trinitarians). However, the restoration of calm in Transylvania was hampered by the ceaseless spiritual ferment, and particularly by the bolder reformers, Ferenc Dávid and his followers.
In 1578, that famous bishop took another major step on the path of doctrinal revision: he denied that Jesus should be worshipped. He thereby put himself at odds with Blandrata, who was deeply apprehensive about the princely court's hostility to Anti-Trinitarianism. The ruler now gave free rein to his more impatient and rigid relative, the voivode Kristóf Báthori, but even the latter shrank from unleashing a bloody wave of religious persecution in Transylvania. The voivode invited one of Europe's most prominent Anti-Trinitarians, Fausto Socino, to persuade Dávid by theological argument of the error of his ways. When Socino admitted defeat {1-735.} and left the country, Kristóf Báthori had the Anti-Trinitarian bishop arrested and incarcerated at Déva castle. Dávid died in captivity on 15 November 1579, before it became clear that he was not guilty of the principal charge brought against him: for in Socino's report, which had been used by Blandrata to incriminate Dávid, the theses of one of the latter's disciples, Mathias Vehe-Glirius, a refugee from Germany, had been substituted for those of the bishop.
The denomination itself could not be outlawed, if only because it already encompassed a large proportion of Transylvania's urban middle class. However, official pressure led to its fragmentation. The moderate wing, led by Blandrata, became the Unitarian Church, which drew strong support in Kolozsvár and other Hungarian towns, as well as among the Székelys. The 'noble wing' of the denomination was largely eliminated in political struggles that multiplied towards the end of the century. Gáspár Bekes, the Anti-Trinitarians' principal patron after the death of John Sigismund, was allowed by Stephen Báthori to live out his days in Poland; János Gerendy was exiled in 1594 by Zsigmond Báthori; and Farkas Kornis was murdered in 1601 on the orders of Michael the Brave. The third faction, led by András Eőssy and Simon Péchi, followed Glirius's lead in rejecting the New Testament, and founded the Sabbatarian sect.
Thus the Anti-Trinitarians were finally reduced to play a secondary role in Transylvania's religious culture. Meanwhile, the Catholic Church, which had seemed fated to disappear, was saved through the efforts of Stephen

Báthori. In 1579 — when there were no more than thirty Catholic priests in the whole country, and Kolozsvár was without one — Stephen instructed the diet to allow the Jesuits into Transylvania. The highly-educated Jesuits proceeded to establish a university-level college in Kolozsvár as well as lesser schools in Kolozsmonostor, Várad, and Gyulafehérvár. The first Jesuits in Transylvania all came from abroad, although there were among them Hungarians (notably István Szántó) who had {1-736.} studied in Rome; later, they were joined by local recruits. Prince Zsigmond's first father-confessor was the Hungarian Jesuit János Leleszi. By then, the majority of Transylvanians had converted to Protestantism, and they looked upon these elite troops of the CounterReformation with ill-concealed hatred. Apart from solid blocks in the Csík and Háromszék districts, the remaining Catholics lived in some dispersal. The prince realized that it would be senseless to provoke the hostility of the feudal estates. The Catholics retained the right to worship freely, but there was a delay until their Church hierarchy could be reestablished; the first new bishop, Demeter Napragi, was appointed by King Stephen's successor, Prince Zsigmond Báthori.
The Reformation reached ordinary people in a variety of ways. In so far as Transylvania had a feudal system, the political elite, acting on the principle of cuius regio, eius religio, should have imposed its choice of denomination on its subjects. However, the social structure of the principality had some uncommon aspects. The nobility, the Saxons, the Székelys, the non-German middle class in towns like Kolozsvár, and the peasant-citizens of the region east of the Tisza all enjoyed varying degrees of liberty. Thus the religious debates reached a rather wide circle of individuals and communities that had the right to independent choice. Although the small but growing number of literate people cannot be all attributed to these groups, the four hundred books that were published in Transylvania during the 16th century can provide some indication of their cultural interests.
It has been estimated that there were, in this period, between 50,000 and 100,000 books in the principality. Theological works accounted for 38 percent of this number, a rather high proportion compared to the European average, which was less than 30 percent. (It is indicative of the interest in religious reform that the most popular author was Philipp Melanchton.) Some 22 percent of the books were the works of classical authors, while those by contemporary {1-737.} humanists accounted for 24 percent. Classical literature was represented by Homer, Euripides, Titus Livius, Terence, and Virgil, philosophy by Aristotle, rhetoric by Cicero, and law by Justinian. (In Transylvania, unlike in the rest of Europe, the works of Aristotle were as popular as those of Plato.) Modernity was represented by Erasmus, Boccaccio, Ramus, and Justus Lipius. The religious debates and reforms coincided in time with the other great intellectual movement of the age, the Renaissance.
The early humanist circles at Várad and Gyulafehérvár had been but glimmers of light in the wholly medieval world of Transylvania, which, like the Partium, suffered from remoteness and backwardness. This situation was radically altered by the establishment of the principality. The royal court had been the main promoter of the Renaissance in Hungary; in the 16th century, this role was assumed principally by Gyulafehérvár. The other impetus to change came from the historic reverses suffered by Hungary. Political turmoil and social stress induced a growing interest in history; people wanted to understand how the Hungarian state could have collapsed, and to identify the factors that were responsible for their misfortune.
The beginnings of this historical quest mirrored the decades of slow and painful disintegration. The first three historians who were connected in some way to Transylvania all worked in a Habsburg environment. Miklós Oláh was in the Low Countries when he wrote his geography of Hungary. Antal Verancsics, who left behind an extensive but unfinished history of the events after Mohács, ended his days as Archbishop of Esztergom. György Szerémi was a 'senior' student at the University of Vienna when he worked on his famous Memoirs of Hungary's decline. Both Verancsics and Szerémi had served King John, the first as a diplomat, the latter as chaplain, and Oláh, as noted, was born in Transylvania.
In Habsburg Hungary, these historical investigations were carried forward by János Zsámboki (Sambucus) and reached a peak {1-738.} with Miklós Istvánffy. In Transylvania, the task was assumed by Ferenc Forgách, a prelate who had come from Habsburg Hungary to serve as chancellor; his monumental chronicle spans the period from 1540 to 1572. Forgách had once studied at Padua, as did his successor, Farkas Kovacsóczy, whose Párbeszéd Erdély közigazgatásáról (A Dialogue on the Administration of Transylvania) was the first Hungarian treatise in the field of political science.
Another alumnus of Padua at the chancellery, Pál Gyulay, chronicled Stephen Báthori's Russian campaign of 1580.

István Szamosközy, who had a similar background, was a pioneer of analytical and objective historiography; his history of the period around the turn of the 17th century has lost none of its value.
Even Stephen Báthori dabbled in history-writing, and his memoir of the castle-wars in the 1560s remains an important source. It was he who invited the Italian Gian Michele Bruto (Brutus) to write a sequel to Bonfini's great historical treatise; the resulting work represented a quasi-official endorsement of the emerging cult of King Matthias. Also deserving of note is János Baranyai Decsi (Czimor), the chronicler of Zsigmond Báthori's early military campaigns.
In keeping with humanistic traditions, these court historiographers deliberately adopted Latin, the cultural lingua franca of the age. That might have seemed a retrograde choice at a time when the Reformation was inspiring a growing body of work in Hungarian, and particularly when Hungarian was being actively promoted at the expense of Latin as Transylvania's language of administration. The latter policy was inspired by the Hungarians' domination of political life, their numerical superiority in Transylvania, and the aforementioned linguistic revolution induced by the Reformation. Hungarian became the exclusive language of administration, official correspondence, judicial proceedings, and, in 1565, of codification. In this respect, too, the principality stole a march on Habsburg Hungary, where the sovereign's German-French-{1-739.} Spanish-Italian court was scarcely disposed to give official recognition to Hungarian, and where the Latin-rooted Catholic Church retained far greater influence.
The contrast between the radiant optimism of Renaissance art and the sombre pessimism — or, at best, sharply critical outlook — of Transylvania's historiographers was even more striking. In this case, the historians were in tune with the Protestant reformers, whose passionate tracts reflected a similar bitterness, sense of crisis, and quest for answers.
It took exceptional talent to reconcile the internal contradictions of intellectual and literary life. One who possessed it was Bálint Balassi, whose poetry encompassed both the joyful optimism of the Renaissance and desperate debates with God. Balassi belonged to Habsburg Hungary, and his stay in Transylvania was somewhat accidental: taken prisoner at the battle of Kerelőszentpál, he was saved from execution or imprisonment by the normally severe Báthori, who received him at his court.
Balassi was the first truly great poet to write in Hungarian. Others, more closely connected to Transylvania, contributed to the emergence of literary prose in that language. The work of Gáspár Heltai (Chronica, Fabulák, Bible translations) has already been noted in the account of Kolozsvár. Also worthy of note are Gábor Pesti, the translator of Aesop's works and the New Testament, and Gábor Mindszenti, a rather mysterious figure who wrote an account, in lyrical Hungarian, of the death of King John I.
The government actively helped to develop the network of schools. The old Catholic schools gradually disappeared, making way for Lutheran and Calvinist colleges that over time earned great renown. Such Protestant schools were founded at Debrecen in 1536, at Brassó in 1543 (the Studium Coronense, founded by Honterus on the site of the earlier Catholic school), and, during the reign of Isabella and John Sigismund, at Kolozsvár, Marosvásárhely, Gyulafehérvár, Nagyenyed, and Székelyudvarhely. {1-740.} In 1560, the school at Gyulafehérvár was upgraded to a college, and some time later the former Franciscans' school in Kolozsvár was converted by Anti-Trinitarians into their principal educational institution. Kolozsvár was also the site of Transylvania's first university, founded by Stephen Báthori; by 1583, this academy had a faculty headed by four full professors, 130 students, and a library of several thousand volumes.
With regard to changes in the lifestyle of the ruling elite and urban dwellers, mention has already been made of the building boom that materialized in the mid-1500s. New castles, manors, and other dwellings appeared all over the principality, with a profusion of interior furnishings designed for comfort and convenience. These trends reflected the popularization of Renaissance style.
The transformation had its origins in the time of John Szapolyai and György Fráter. An Italian fundator (engineer), Domenico da Bologna, restored Buda's fortifications in 1536 and went on to build a fortress at Szamosújvár. Fráter's castle at Alvinc was a fine example of 16th century Lombard architecture. Over a period of decades, the efforts of successive rulers turned the princely residence at Gyulafehérvár into a magnificent Renaissance palace

that, alas, has not survived. (Kolozsvár's stonecarvers honed their skills on the project.)
The home of the Bethlen family at Keresd stood out among the great castle building operations at the mid-century with its stylistic excellence. The arcuated porticoes and the old tower are a harmonious blend of stone and wood, a combination that is typical of the Renaissance in Transylvania. The castle at Szentbenedek, constructed around 1593, displays a riotously rich ornamentation that betrays its Italian inspiration. Kolozsvár's Academy, destroyed in 1603, had been designed by King Stephen's Italian chief architect; a palace of classical elegance, its quadrangle was enclosed by late Renaissance arcades.
{1-741.} As in the case of earlier innovations, this mature, late Renaissance style appeared first in military constructions. Although circumstances required that Várad's new fortifications be built of earth, their design (by Ottavio Baldigara) accurately reflects the period's style of defensive architecture. The structure, laid out in the shape of a symmetrical pentagon, with 'Italianate bastions', would stand out as the strongest fortress of the principality. Some existing edifices of uneven shape were remodelled by Italian architects into symmetrical castles, pentagonal at Várad and Szatmár, and square-shaped at Fogaras.
The fine arts, in contrast, seemed to stagnate. The goldsmiths of Kolozsvár and the Szászföld maintained their high standards, but there is no evidence of outstanding paintings or sculptures (apart from the finely-carved decoration on Renaissance buildings). Many works of art were destroyed in the ensuing wars, but there is an additional reason for their paucity: the Reformation banned pictures and sculptures from places of worship. The period of civil war dampened interest in the arts, and the princely court could fill only part of the gap in demand. Transylvania's greatest cultural figure in the 16th century, the lutist-composer Bálint Bakfark (Valentin Greff?), spent only a short time at King John's court before heading west to find new patrons.
The implantation of the Italian Renaissance owed much to the influence of Gyulafehérvár. Influential Italians were always present at the courts of Isabella (herself half-Italian) and her successors; the most noteworthy were Doctor Blandrata-Biandrata, Gian Michele Bruto, and Antonio Possevino. The Báthori family, notably King Stephen, Prince Zsigmond, and Cardinal András held Italian art in high esteem. The celebration of Zsigmond's coming of age was conducted in Italian style, with music performed by Italians.
As noted, Stephen Báthori's cultural patronage extended to many areas, notably the foundation of a university, construction projects, and support for historiographers. Thanks to foreigners, his {1-742.} quintessentially Hungarian court was exposed to the wonders of the Renaissance. During the reign of Zsigmond Báthori, the style of the court became overwhelmingly Italian: Giambattista Mosto led an orchestra of twenty Italian musicians, the Tuscan Simone Genga was chief architect, and the monarch's favourite painter was Niccolò Greco. There were also Italian actors, jesters, cooks, gardeners, and fencing-masters. Zsigmond's successor, the Cardinal-Prince András, was equally enamoured of Italians and their art.
The court at Gyulafehérvár was held in high regard by cultured Europeans. The welcome extended to AntiTrinitarians contributed greatly to its fame. In Venice, the composer Girolamo Diruta dedicated his work Il Transilvano to Zsigmond Báthori. And, as noted, Transylvanians who had studied in Padua held important positions in the government.
All this did not mean that Renaissance lifestyle and culture were widely disseminated in Transylvanian society. The new style was adopted by some of the wealthier burghers and more cosmopolitan nobles, but a far greater number of people felt drawn to the sober spirit of the Reformation. Many in the ruling elite were decidedly hostile to the influential Italians milling around the court, to their foreign tastes and comportment. This antagonism was not the least of the problems with which Stephen Báthori's successors would have to contend.
If aristocrats, nobles, and Saxons, had reservations about Renaissance culture, then the puritanical citizens of the market towns, the increasingly impoverished Székelys, and, above all, the villeins felt wholly estranged from the 'eccentricities' of the court. Thus popular culture did not undergo fundamental change in the course of the 16th century; in this respect, the Middle Ages in Transylvania lasted well into the 17th century.

Bocskai's Insurrection and the Rebirth of the Transylvanian State
Zsigmond Báthori, Michael the Brave, and Giorgio Basta
No one in Hungary since King Matthias had managed to consolidate central power as effectively as did Transylvania's rulers. This fact goes a long way toward explaining how that small state, threatened from two directions, could survive a succession of crises; and how a Hungarian social entity could make its culture flourish again and remain an actor on the international stage.
There was only one flaw in this generally positive record: the excessive concentration of power in the hands of the ruling prince. With their jurisdiction ill-defined, high state officials were not so much decision-makers as advisers to the prince and agents of his will. Such subservience depended on the presence of a capable and determined ruler; a weakening of the latter's authority could have potentially disastrous consequences.
Between 1581 and 1586, the government of Transylvania was firmly in the hands of Stephen Báthori, King of Poland. The aristocrats who acceded to power after his death were no better than second-rate civil servants. János Ghiczy, who was appointed governor in 1585, found himself at odds with Zsigmond Báthori's ambitious relatives. Led by István Bocskai, the latter quarrelled constantly with officials of the Kovacsóczy chancellery, people who had acquired a humanistic outlook in Padua. The feudal estates, after thirty years of obedient quiescence, realized that this discord at the apex of power could serve their particular interests. When the diet was convened in October 1588 to enthrone the 16-year-old Zsigmond Báthori, it dug in its heels and demanded that the Jesuits be expelled. Young Zsigmond was a fervid Catholic, and his father- {1-744.} confessor was the Spanish Jesuit Alfonso Carillo. He rejected the demand, whereupon the diet dispersed without having accomplished its appointed task.
A tug-of-war followed between the prince and the emboldened feudal estates. Zsigmond Báthori and his chancellery had little leverage at their disposal: other members of the Báthori family controlled the principal crown estates, and both Boldizsár Báthori and the younger István Báthori, captains respectively of Várad and Fogaras, were jealous of their cousin's power. When the diet reconvened in December 1588, the prince was compelled to ban the Jesuits in exchange for recognition of his majority. The aging Ghiczy resigned and died soon afterwards.
The victory of the feudal estates spurred the prince's power-hungry relatives into action. In 1590, the oldest of them, Boldizsár Báthori, began to forge links with opposition forces led by the Kendi family. Successive diets whittled away at the powers of the ruling prince. A bill, enacted in November 1591, prescribed that on issues of national importance, the prince had to follow the rulings of his council. Smelling danger, the chancellery tried to retaliate; it proposed to Zsigmond that it mediate a reconciliation with Boldizsár, or, alternatively, arrange the latter's assassination. By coming forward with a proposal rather than a fait accompli, the chancellery's officials revealed their major weakness: they were incapable of taking initiatives. Nor did the prince's reaction bode well for the future: frightened by the proposal (and allegedly on Carillo's advice), he revealed the plan to Boldizsár. The latter promptly arranged for the murder of two chancellery officials, Pál Gyulay, the prince's scholarly personal secretary, and János Gálfi, Zsigmond's onetime tutor and manager of Stephen Báthori's 'election' in 1581. The prince remained silent.
Following these events, which all occurred in the autumn of 1592, Chancellor Kovacsóczy lost confidence in his ruler and made overtures to the opposition. He was married to Sándor Kendi's {1-745.} daughter, whose sister had just been wed by Boldizsár Báthori. Thus the feudal estates, the chancellery, and the core of the Báthori family combined forces against the prince.
However, Zsigmond Báthori had some potential supporters. Ignoring the last wish of King Stephen, the Polish diet had elected as king not his nephew but the Swedish monarch Sigismund III. When the Habsburgs tried to impose their rule over Poland, the late king's Transylvanian troops helped the Poles to repel this threat, then headed back to Transylvania. There they were garrisoned in frontier fortresses, and their commanders naturally established close relations with the castellans and other local aristocrats. The most important of these was the prince's uncle, István Bocskai. When young Zsigmond turned to Bocskai for help, the latter was ready to seize the opportunity.

https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/118.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:23:37]
The changes that came in 1593 confirmed Stephen Báthori's wisdom in treating the Ottomans with great circumspection. After twenty-five years of relative peace, the Ottoman Empire went once again on the offensive in Hungary. Emperor Rudolph received promises of assistance not only from his German lands but also from Spain, Venice, and the Pope.
The 21-year-old, Jesuit-educated Zsigmond Báthori saw a ray of hope: perhaps he could participate in the expulsion of the Ottomans and realize the goals that Hungarians had dreamt of for fifty years. He won the enthusiastic support of soldiers who had participated in Stephen Báthori's victorious battles and of those who had knowledge of the great king's anti-Ottoman schemes. Zsigmond convoked the Transylvanian diet, which duly approved his proposal to prepare for war, but only on conditions that further limited the prince's powers. Thus in the fall of 1593, a new tax (kalongyapénz) was imposed; the revenues were to be handled by the treasurer of the feudal estates, who was none other than Gábor Kendi. The following spring, the military units were kept separate from the prince's army.
{1-746.} Somewhat unexpectedly, the Christian armies in Hungary earned a series of victories over the Ottomans in late 1593 and early 1594. Zsigmond Báthori's enthusiasm grew by leaps and bounds. Father Carillo conveyed alliance proposals, first to Rome, then to Rudolph's court at Prague, and found a ready welcome in both places. The Pope promptly dispatched a nuncio to Transylvania, and the pact was sealed at Gyulafehérvár in February 1594. Transylvania, announced Zsigmond, would adhere to the Holy League. A few weeks later, the governor (bán) of Lugos, György Palatics, launched an assault on the Turkish vilayet of Temes.
This bold stroke was rather deceptive, for it was executed on a unilateral decision of the prince and lacked the backing of the diet and the feudal estates. Chancellor Kovacsóczy remained wedded to the traditional, Turkishoriented policy, as did most of Transylvania' aristocrats, who were unable to forget the events of the 1550s. Their reservations found justification in the fact that the Habsburgs, despite all the promises of help, went to war with insufficient forces. Contributions came only from the German Empire, then in a phase of disintegration, from a papacy weakened by the Reformation, and from the Republic of Venice. Other European countries remained neutral, and the chancellor of neighbouring Poland, Jan Zamoyski, preferred to nurture cordial relations with the Sublime Porte.
Despite the early military successes in Hungary, the majority of delegates to the diet that convened on 12 May 1594 at Torda remained opposed to the war. Ignoring the advice of Bocskai and other military leaders, the diet rejected the prince's proposal, and the latter was prevented by the 1591 law from acting independently. The diet named two opposition figures, Boldizsár Báthori and János Gerendy, to command and manage the finances of the feudal estates' army set up in February. Left to his own devices, Governor Palatics suffered a defeat at the hands of the Ottomans, and the local Serbs who had rallied to him lost their faith in Transylvania.
{1-747.} Meanwhile, in Habsburg Hungary, the Grand Vizier Sinan Pasha led a successful counter-attack against the Christians' armies. What's more, Tartar raiders reappeared on the Great Plain and the borders of Transylvania. Bocskai, who had been promoted to the captaincy of Várad, had to rush to the aid of Ferenc Geszty's beleaguered garrison at Déva. When, on 1 July, at Gyulafehérvár, Zsigmond tried once again to obtain the support of the diet, the opposition put on a show of armed force and rammed through a resolution to stay out of the war.
The prince momentarily gave up. After declaring that he would abdicate and hand over power to Boldizsár Báthori, he headed for the Hungarian border. Stunned by this unexpected turn of events, his opponents spent weeks debating how to reorganize Transylvania's government. They seemed oblivious to the fact that while the prince had departed, the pro-war faction continued to exist.
Zsigmond Báthori did not leave the principality, but halted in Kővár. As soon the Tartar threat waned, Bocskai, Geszty, and the captain of Huszt, Gáspár Kornis, hurried to his side and persuaded him to change his mind. At the end of July, the prince issued a proclamation that he would return. The Kendi brothers, Boldizsár Báthori, and the chancellery's officials kowtowed and saw no reason to stay away from the meeting of the diet called for August 20. The Prince entered Kolozsvár at the head of Bocskai's troops and forced the diet to declare war on the Ottomans. Urged on by his officers, Zsigmond proceeded on 28 August to have the opposition leaders arrested. Sándor Kendi and his younger brother, Gábor, were beheaded along with three other councillors. The imprisoned Boldizsár

Báthori, Farkas Kovacsóczy, and Ferenc Kendi were garrotted on 11 September.
The war-party now stood unopposed, and the confiscated wealth of the late dissenters could be applied to the needs of the army. The autumn was too short to launch a major military campaign, {1-748.} and a raid on Facset, in the Temesköz, ended badly. However, Bocskai travelled to the Prague court and there, on 28 January 1595, a treaty of alliance was signed between Transylvania and the Habsburg Empire; this was the first occasion that the Habsburgs recognized Báthori's title of prince (princeps). A second agreement, signed in March, sealed the betrothal of Archduchess Maria Christierna to Prince Zsigmond.
Soon afterwards, the Transylvanian army launched a two-pronged offensive. Between June and October, forces commanded by the governor of Karánsebes, György Borbély, reoccupied Tótvárad, Facset, Solymos, Lippa, Arad, Világos, Borosjenő, and all the forts in the area. The prince himself led the bulk of the army southward to drive the Ottomans from Wallachia.
Since October 1593, that Romanian principality had been ruled by the voivode Michael, who later came to be known as Michael the Brave (in Romanian, Mihai Viteazul). Wallachia had been for decades a vassal state of the Porte. Its voivodes acted essentially as proconsuls for the Ottomans; far from being able to confront the latter, they were obliged to provide military assistance. The shift in Transylvanian policy created conditions similar to those before 1526: Hungarian, or, more precisely, Transylvanian support could help to counteract the power of the sultan. Moreover, unlike most of his predecessors, the voivode Michael was prepared to take bold action. Around the middle of 1594, he concluded a secret pact with Zsigmond Báthori. In November, assisted by Székely soldiers, Michael turned on the Ottomans, attacking their strongholds along the Danube from Vidin to Brăila. Moldavia's voivode, Aron Tiranul, promptly joined the Transylvanian alliance and attacked the Ottomans in the Danube Delta.
By the end of 1594, Grand Vizier Sinan had largely succeeded in stabilizing the Hungarian front. The following summer, he had to set off on another mission. Istanbul relied heavily on Wallachia for its food supply, and Michael's rebellion had brought it close to famine. Sinan marched off at the head of a 40,000-strong army to {1-749.} restore order in the Romanian principalities. Meanwhile, first Wallachia (on May 20), then Moldavia (on July 3) had acknowledged the suzerainty of Prince Zsigmond, who was therefore obligated to protect his new vassals. Voivode Michael disposed of no more than 17,000 troops, including a strong Székely contingent. On 23 August, at Călugăreni, he managed to halt Sinan Pasha's advance, but superior numbers soon forced him to withdraw into the Carpathians, with his army reduced to 8,000 men.
At summer's end, Zsigmond Báthori intensified his preparations for war. He had recently wed Maria Christierna, but it appears that the wedding night turned into a fiasco, prompting the broken-hearted prince to seek solace in military glory. The prince's own army, the feudal estates' units, and the detachments sent by the Habsburgs and the new voivode of Moldavia, Ştefan Răzvan, added up to only 16,000 soldiers. Zsigmond therefore called on the Székelys, who had been driven into servitude some twenty-five years earlier. Some 15,000 Székelys assembled at the military encampment near Feketehalom and, on September 15, the prince gave in to their demand that he restore their liberties. Báthori must have felt vindicated in making this risky concession when, a few days after the formal document was issued, an additional 8,000 Székelys arrived at the camp. The commander-in-chief, Bocskai, soon issued an order to march, and in October an army of close to 40,000 men crossed the border near Brassó to link up with Voivode Michael. On October 18, they recaptured Tîrgovişte from the Ottomans. Two days later, Sinan Pasha pulled out of Bucharest, but Bocskai and Michael caught up with his retreating army at Giurgiu, on the Danube. The main Turkish force managed to cross the river, but the garrison and the rear-guard units were slaughtered. By October 29, Wallachia was once again free of the Ottomans.
The war took a favourable turn in Hungary as well, for Christian forces recaptured Visegrád, Vác, and Esztergom. Zsigmond, however, could not have been wholly satisfied with the fruits of victory. As a reward for Michael's military contribution, he {1-750.} had to release the Wallachian voivode from vassalage. As for Moldavia's ruler, when Stephen returned home from the battle of Giurgiu, he was murdered on orders of a rival, the Polish-backed Ieremia Movilă, and the latter took over as voivode.
Zsigmond faced a bigger problem at home, and one for which he was largely responsible. The liberation of the Székelys clashed with the interests of Transylvanian nobles (who thereby lost many villeins) and ran counter to the ineluctable disintegration of traditional Székely society. Perhaps the prince never had any intention of making the

change permanent; in any case, after perfunctory talks, he rescinded the decree in early 1596.
Having given their blood for freedom, the Székelys were embittered by the prince's volte-face and girded for an 'offensive'. Zsigmond and his main adviser, Bocskai, had anticipated this reaction and, just before Lent 1596, they dispatched troops to the Székelyföld. The revolt was nipped in the bud, and with such appalling cruelty including impalement, hanging, and mutilation — that ordinary Székelys developed an abiding hatred for the prince and the entire Báthori dynasty. No longer could Zsigmond count on them to fight the Ottomans; his attempt in early summer to recapture Temesvár ended in failure.
That fall, the Christian armies suffered a series of major defeats in Habsburg Hungary. The earlier setbacks and the famine in Istanbul had spurred into action the new sultan, Mohammed III, who personally led an army into Hungary. On 13 October, the mercenary garrison of Eger ignored the protests of the castellan, Pál Nyáry, and surrendered that key stronghold. A relief force of Habsburg and Transylvanian troops arrived with some delay, only to be defeated at Mezőkeresztes in a bitter battle that lasted four days, from October 23 to 26. A disillusioned Zsigmond repaired back to Transylvania, apprehending perhaps that henceforth the war would turn into a costly stalemate. Accompanied by Bocskai, he travelled to Prague in January 1597 for talks with the court. Zsigmond raised the possibility of his abdication, but the court had {1-751.} not given up hope of military victory and tried to dissuade the prince. In the event, the year brought little cause for optimism; a Transylvanian offensive in the Temesköz was once again repulsed, and a military stalemate marked the front in Transdanubia.
Zsigmond's irrevocable decision to abdicate was conveyed to Prague by Father Carillo, and an agreement was concluded on 23 December. Emperor Rudolph assented to the prince's divorce from Maria Christierna, granted him an annuity as well as the duchies of Oppeln and Ratibor, and promised to obtain for Zsigmond a cardinal's hat.
In April 1598, the emperor's commissioners — István Szuhay, Miklós Istvánffy, and Bartholomeus Pezzen — took charge of Transylvania and the Partium. István Bocskai had the principality's soldiers swear allegiance to the emperor, and Zsigmond Báthori set off for Silesia.
As in 1551, the transfer of power did not go smoothly. Military reverses had rekindled the pro-Turkish tendency in Transylvania, and the new chancellor, István Jósika, adopted this orientation. His intrigues were exposed, and he was put under arrest, but the leading proponent of war, Bocskai, was dismissed from his post of army commander.
Offended by this demotion, Bocskai urged his onetime ruler to return to Transylvania. Zsigmond was as unhappy with his status at Oppeln and Ratibor as Isabella had been in the 1550s. Responding to Bocskai's entreaties, he set off in total secrecy and reached Kolozsvár on 20 August 1598. Bocskai was reinstated as army commander, replacing Gáspár Kornis; Chancellor Jósika was executed; and the imperial commissioners were sent home. Transylvania was once again ruled by Zsigmond Báthori.
The Prague court refused to ratify this change, and, in the autumn of 1598, the Ottomans laid siege to Várad, the gate to Transylvania. The fortress still had its imperial garrison, which Bocskai reinforced with some Transylvanian units. After a protracted struggle, the defenders, who were under the command of {1-752.} Pál Nyáry (of Eger fame), drove off the Ottomans. Paradoxically, Transylvania had been preserved from the Ottomans by another hostile power, but that did not alter the fact that the principality was caught between two millstones. Dire necessity drove Báthori to parley with the Ottomans, but when this failed, he was persuaded by Father Carillo to seek a rapprochement with the Poles. Chancellor Zamoyski responded readily to the overture. The agreement, sealed on 17 March 1599, provided for Zsigmond to abdicate (for the third time!) and hand over power to his cousin, Cardinal András Báthori, freshly arrived from Poland.
Transylvania thus fell into Poland's sphere of influence. This shift carried one clear benefit: both Cracow and its ally, Moldavia's voivode Ieremia Movilă, interceded for András Báthori in Istanbul. However, this transfer of power was no more trouble-free than the preceding one. Bocskai withdrew to his domain in the region east of the Tisza and proceeded to assemble a new army. Emperor Rudolph armed an expeditionary force, commanded by Giorgio Basta, to bring Transylvania back to the fold. Both were beaten to the punch by Wallachia's Voivode Michael, who, on 5 October 1599, marched on the principality.
Michael the Brave had good reason to act promptly. He had fought bravely against the Ottomans, and although, in 1598, he signed a treaty of peace with the latter, both sides knew that the issue was far from settled. When

Transylvania fell under the influence of Poland, which preserved normal relations with the Porte, a hostile ring closed around Wallachia. Only the Habsburgs were prepared to ally themselves with voivode Michael. The treaty, signed in Prague on 9 June 1598, made Wallachia a vassal state; in exchange, the emperor undertook to cover the cost of providing five thousand mercenaries to the Romanian principality. The voivode, as befits a good general, wanted to secure a land link to his ally. With Emperor Rudolph's assent, he launched an attack on Transylvania.
{1-753.} Many Székelys rallied to Michael, and his army had grown to over 20,000 men when, on 28 October 1599, he engaged the forces of Gáspár Kornis, András Báthori's military commander, at the village of Sellenberk, near Szeben. The battle ended in Michael's favour. On November 3, the cardinal-prince, on his way to safe haven in Poland, was killed in the Székelyföld.
Voivode Michael marched into Gyulafehérvár on November 1. The Transylvanian diet, which convened there at the end of the month, dutifully bowed to the conqueror and acknowledged him as imperial governor. This was the first time that the state of Transylvania had a Romanian ruler. Wallachian boyars were given functions — rather ill-defined — in the government. The bán Mihalcea acted as governor when Michael had to be absent from the country. For a time, András Báthori's chancellor, Bishop Demeter Napragi, remained at his post; when he resigned, Michael did not name a successor but left matters in the hands of the secretary, János Jacobinus. At the same time, Michael gave freer rein to his Wallachian chancellor, the logofet Teodosie. The important post of court-marshal was assigned to a boyar, Stoica, who thereby gained influence over the administration of state finances. The Transylvanian army's command was held at first by István Csáky, then, after he changed sides, by András Barcsai. The Székely troops, and, of course, the Romanian ones belonged to separate command. The administration of each district in the counties and seats was placed under the supervision of a Romanian captain. The Greek Orthodox denomination was given official recognition, a status withdrawn from the Calvinists and Unitarians, and Orthodox priests were taken out of the ranks of villeins. Villages were ordered to allow Romanian shepherds to graze their flocks on fallow land.
On the other hand, there is no evidence that Michael wanted Transylvania's Romanians to play a political role. Indeed, while he brought some of his Wallachian aides to Transylvania, he also invited {1-754.} some Székelys and other Transylvanian Hungarians to assist in the administration of Wallachia, where he wished to transplant Transylvania's far more advanced feudal system. Initially, Michael made an effort in Transylvania to win over the traditional feudal estates. Several leading figures, political and military, were drawn to his court: Csáky, Barcsai, Napragi, and even Gáspár Kornis, Farkas Kornis, and Mózes Székely. The voivode consulted the diet, which met three times (including the initial session at Gyulafehérvár) over the short lifespan of his rule. The Székelys, having recovered their liberties, rewarded Michael with their loyalty; and he had such faith in them that he did not bother to appoint Romanian captains for their districts.
Yet Michael failed to entrench his rule. The majority of Hungarian nobles were alienated by his early concessions to the Székelys, and for two reasons. One was that they suffered material losses as a result of the liberation of Székely villeins. The other was that the Székelys, giving vent to their pent-up resentment, seized the opportunity to take bloody revenge — not sparing even women and children — on all those implicated in their suppression in 1596.
The hostility to Michael was also fed by hefty tax increases. The basic state tax, which had stood at 3 forints per household for decades, shot up to 16 forints by late 1600; and towns were obliged to make loans to the state. The money was needed mainly to cover military expenses: as mistrust turned to mounting hostility, the voivode could only sustain his rule by the threat of force. Financial support from the emperor ceased as soon as it became clear that Michael had no intention of allowing Transylvania to be controlled by Prague, and when he laid claim to the Partium, which had passed under Habsburg rule. The mercenaries cost Michael close to 100,000 forints a month, and neither Wallachia nor Transylvania could generate sufficient revenues. To forestall collapse, Michael launched in May 1600 a surprise attack on Moldavia and expelled the pro-Polish voivode, Ieremia Movilă. But the booty from that impoverished country could delay the crises for {1-755.} only a few weeks; by the end of the summer, most of the victorious troops had to resort to looting to sustain themselves. The peasants, Hungarian and Romanian alike, tried to resist, and thereby incurred even more vicious reprisals — the most notorious of which was the bloodbath perpetrated on 6 August 1600 at Bánffyhunyad. The outrages incited Transylvanian nobles to mount a counter-action, and the leader of the resistance movement, István Csáky, turned for help to Giorgio Basta.

A Habsburg army entered Transylvania and, aided by the local rebels, defeated Michael's forces in a battle at Miriszló on 18 September 1600. The majority of Székelys had remained loyal to Michael and, indeed, accounted for the larger part of his army, but others had changed sides and joined Basta. Mihály fled to Wallachia, only to face a revolt of the boyars, who, with Turkish and Polish support, had invited Simion Movilă to be their new voivode. On 15 November, Michael suffered another defeat in a battle by the Argeş River. Forced once again to flee, he reached the imperial court at Prague on 12 January 1601.
Meanwhile, in late October 1600, Transylvania's three 'nations' had sworn allegiance to Emperor Rudolph. Basta promptly revoked the act that had restored Székely liberties and exiled István Bocskai, whose wealth and independence made him dangerous. Like Michael, the distinguished general sought refuge in Prague, but he soon retired in disgust to his domain in Bihar county.
Now it was the turn of General Basta's ill-paid mercenaries to torment Transylvania's people. Their depredations, which spread to the edge of the Great Plain, acquired appalling proportions. Among the Christians, the most brutal were the hajdú troops, mostly uprooted peasants who applied to their former fellows the cruelty that they had suffered and learned from the soldiers. On the Turkish side, the worst atrocities were perpetrated by the Tartars and other soldiers of fortune. Observing the meaningless bloodbath, and counting on the mutual exhaustion of the protagonists, Chancellor {1-756.} Jan Zamoyski tried to draw Transylvania back into Poland's sphere of influence. Zsigmond Báthori was ready and willing to serve this end, and the feudal estates followed István Csáky's advice to invite the return of their onetime prince. Basta and his troops left Transylvania without a fight, and, in February 1601, Zsigmond reclaimed the princely throne.
However, Prague was not ready to give up. Basta's army was re-organized, and the former voivode Michael was assigned to help. On 3 August, at Goroszló, Báthori suffered defeat and was put to flight. Two weeks later, Michael was murdered by Walloon officers of Basta's army. Transylvania fell once again into Habsburg hands, and the conquerors wrought death and devastation. An eyewitness, István Szamosközy (who also used the name Pál Enyedi), recorded that 'the peasantry sought refuge deep in the woods, the hills, the mountains, where they suffered great deprivation. But even the forests could not offer adequate hiding place; they were hunted down, tormented, branded with red-hot irons, ropes were tightened around their heads until the eyes popped out, many were hung by their hair and burned to death, children were burned in front of their mothers, and I will not detail what atrocities they perpetrated upon the women.'[15] Nor were aristocrats spared in the manhunt; one of the victims was Gáspár Kornis.
A ray of hope pierced through the darkness of despair when the persistent Zsigmond Báthori made a fourth attempt to regain control of Transylvania, this time with the help of Turkish and Tartar troops. Basta once again withdrew without a fight, his troops carrying on with the pillage as they left the country. They left behind Tartar marauders and the plague. Zsigmond was appalled at the consequences of his latest initiative. A few months later, he suffered a breakdown and departed from his devastated country, never to return. He died in exile in Prague, in 1613.
The news of Zsigmond's departure prompted Basta to change course again. The beleaguered Transylvanians marshalled an army, {1-757.} but it was soundly defeated at Tövis on 2 July 1602. The looting and killing that followed were now explicitly construed as reprisals, and the conquerors, for good measure, began to persecute Protestants. The feudal estates made one last attempt to defy the odds. Mózes Székely was a general who had once served Stephen Báthori and who had distinguished himself in recent battles. In April 1603, he called upon the assistance of Turkish and Tartar auxiliaries to launch a revolt against the emperor. Basta's army was routed, and their commander was trapped in besieged Szamosújvár. On May 8, Mózes Székely assumed the title of prince.
But the pendulum swung back, perhaps even more quickly than on earlier occasions. The depredations of the Tartars had utterly demoralized the peasantry. The Székelys, for their part, refused to back a man who claimed to be a successor to the Báthori dynasty. That spring, Wallachia's new voivode, Radul (Radu Şerban) had gone to war against the Ottomans; to protect his rear, he launched an attack on Transylvania. Most of the Székelys rallied to Radul, and on 17 July, near Brassó, Mózes Székely lost the battle, and his life.
Basta returned, and the emperor's authority was firmly reimposed, but Transylvania was being bled white. The population, already dispossessed, was decimated by epidemics and famine. Food and draught animals became exceedingly scarce. When Basta left Transylvania in early 1604, he could be confident that no one had the strength

The Early Coexistence of Avars and Slavs
https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/45.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:23:48]
Avar Rule before 630 4. THE PERIOD OF AVAR RULE The Last Century of Avar Rule
{1-234.} The Early Coexistence of Avars and Slavs
The restoration of Avar rule had two consequences. First, Slavic groups that were ready to accept — if only nominally — the suzerainty and protection of the Avars flooded into the region. This inaugurated a new phase of settlement, one in which the area of arable land was expanded at the expense of forests. At first, Avars and Slavs avoided each other in their choice of location (cf. the section on the Slavs). The presence of the Slavs in 7th century Avar cemeteries is indicated only by costumes of women who had intermarried. The second consequence was the emergence in Transylvania (and in other parts of the Avar empire) of full-fledged villages, which lent a certain 'stability' — covering several historical periods in some cases — to the adjoining cemeteries.
In the turbulent period around 630, the remaining Gepids stayed out of trouble; so did the Western Germanic people who had been settled among them and enjoyed amicable relations with the Avars. The cemeteries at Marosnagylak and Baráthely were in continuous use until the end of the 7th century; the finds include, on both sites, Byzantine silver earrings and bronze buckles from the 7th century, and, at Baráthely 3, a fancy, Igar-type buckle with serrated decoration (style II) as well as silver and bronze fibulae.
The best known memorial of this new epoch is the small cemetery at Marosgombás. Its graves (with horses) are dated by stirrups as well as by a more substantial type of food container that had lately come into common use throughout the Avar empire. Byzantine silver and bronze earrings and necklaces with star-shaped pendants date from the same period. Cast-bronze fibulae became fashionable among Slav women (although the extent to which this fashion is of Gepidic, Crimean Gothic, or even provincial Byzantine origin is a matter of debate), as did the wearing — in conjunction, and not on ears, but on plaits — of diverse types of Byzantine-Avar earrings. Typical finds in Slavic graves include wooden buckets with iron {1-235.} hoops and hair clasps with tips twisted into a spiral (the latter indicating a Slav woman or a woman wearing Slavic costume); similar objects have also been found at Marosnagylak and Marosveresmart. However, the various stirrups with round and straight footrests found at Marosgombás are typically Avar, as are the bridles with double ring, spearheads and pikeheads, war axe, and belt ornaments (including a pressed, four-leaf model).
At Tövis, graves have yielded a perforated spearhead, similar to the ones found in Marosgombás; a stirrup with round footrest; Nagylak-type earrings with pendants of joint 'star and crescent shape'; and pottery. All these items, and particularly the pottery, suggest that the cemetery was established prior to 670. A long pike head and a bronze earring adorned with rays date the cemetery at Nagyekemező to some time after 630. The Avar origin of other cemeteries and individual graves can be established on the basis of certain finds: at Torockó, a war axe from the 7th century; at Beresztelke and Kisselyk, 7th century pots fashioned on the wheel; at Kőhalom and Nagycsűr, ornamented solid silver bracelets dating from the same period; and at Nádpatak, a bronze bracelet as well as small, multicoloured beads. The growing incidence of Avar-Slav cohabitation and the gradual expansion of the inhabited area are both signalled at a number of sites: by the beads and crescent-shaped silver earring found next to skeletons in the graves at Várfalva, by beads and a highly ornamented, white-metal fibula at Vecel, by a Marosgombás-type fibula and multicoloured beads at Sinfalva, by a Vecel-type ornamented fibula at Székelyföldvár, and by intact and fragmentary earrings adorned with 'rays' and 'stars' at Mojgrád, Barátfalva, and Marosnagylak. Of similar type are the bronze fibulae found amidst the ruins of ancient Sarmizegethusa (Várhely) and at early Slav settlements in Fiatfalva (Udvarhely) and Kézdipolyán (Háromszék); these sites lies in regions that were ill-suited for Avar settlement. A small, 'Kiev-type' bronze fibula, found next to a skeleton at Székelyhíd-Horó, and some 7th-century {1-236.} fibulae from Felsőlupkó and Orsova, i.e., from the Bánát, merely confirm the Avars' presence on the Great Plain and the Lower Danube. Another form of Avar-Slav coexistence can be observed in a Slav cremation cemetery at Nagyekemező, where a grave aligned on an east-west axis holds a Byzantine belt buckle and the remains of a man who may well have been the Avar-Slav chief of a community of Slavs.
Avar sites in the middle of the Transylvanian Basin — at Szászsebes, Malomfalva-Borsóföld, Marosszentgyörgy, and Bözöd — bear the characteristics of 7th century Avar settlements: sunken dwellings with stone fireplaces, and vessels, fashioned freehand or on a wheel, with impressed or incised decoration, sometimes with pointed rims.



The Early Coexistence of Avars and Slavs
https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/45.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:23:48]
However, the few grave finds do not allow an adequate assessment of social structure or of the local economy.
Some eastern peoples (including Onogur-Bulgars, wangar elements), were driven out of their homelands and flooded into the Avar empire in the era of Constantine IV (668–685); this migration took place in the 670s, shortly before the Bulgars, impelled by the creation and expansion of the Khazar empire, settled in their new, Danubian homeland. Contemporary sources make no mention of the event, which, although not without consequences, failed to arouse the interest of Frankish and Byzantine policymakers. Yet the migration had a profound impact on the early Avar empire. For decades, that empire had been forced to adopt a defensive posture on its northern and western approaches, but the 'new Avars' who flooded in behaved more like aggressive conquerors. Their settlements spread as far Vienna, and with the destruction of Lauriacum (ca. 680), the Enns River became part of the Avar empire's political frontier. In the north, settlements spread north of the line of earthworks at the Danube and the northern edge of the Great Plain, into Slovakia's southwestern, southern, and southeastern regions, where, as in Austria, many large cemeteries came into being. The empire's heartland also felt the effects of change. Although a number {1-237.} of early Avar cemeteries dating back to the 6th century remained in use, many others were abandoned, and an even larger number of new ones appeared. New centres of princely rule (OzoraTótipuszta, Igar) materialized, as did new military posts (e.g. Dunaújváros 1908, Iváncsa, Szeged-Átokháza). Sites throughout the Avar empire have yielded archaeological traces exclusive to the new arrivals. Their weapons were single-edged, curved sabres, and broad, symmetrical bows. The men wore distinctive weapon-belts, with ornaments that were 'plated' or rectangular, the latter in an Asian, ribbony pattern, with inlaid glass; and hair-clips, evidently for pigtails. The women sported new types of earrings and beads, as well as double disc-shaped brooches worn in front and on the shoulders. The newcomers' harnesses included bridles with guards on the ends of the bit, stirrups with flat footrests which indicate that they wore hard-sole boots, rose-shaped rein-decoration all over the Avar empire. There is no trace of such objects dating from before 675. Change is also evident in funeral rites, grave alignment, and cemetery layouts that had no precedent in the Avar empire. These finds were dated, for the initial phase, by gold coins from the time of Constantine IV, and for the subsequent phase by 'blanks', fake coins that were cut from sheets of gold and used as obuli between 675–720.
There are traces of the transformation in the Temes region as well: a few graves and coins that were discovered in the 19th century. Solidi of Constantine IV were found along with a Byzantine belt buckle at Orczyfalva, and with dishes at Kőcse. Other grave finds include two gold coins that had been pierced, and therefore worn on clothing or a neck-chain, one from the time of Constans II (641–668), the other dating from Constantine IV (TorontálszigetTorontáldűlő); and 'light' solidi, weighing 20 siliqua, minted between 661–663 (Mercyfalva, Óbéb). In Transylvania, similar coins were found in the vicinity of Székelyudvarhely: a gold semissis from the age of Constans II or Constantine IV, and a gold {1-238.} solidus of Constantine IV, minted between 674 and 681, that had been trimmed to 'obulus size'. Both coins must have been unearthed in graves dating back to 670–80. Also noteworthy are the graves, of both men with horses and women, that had been dug in a Neolithic settlement-mound at Óbesenyő. The former are linked to this period by the silver earrings, adorned with small spheres, that had become fashionable among men, and the latter by a pendant in the shape of a bronze cross (similar in outline to the contemporary one, bearing a Greek inscription, that was found at Závod, Tolna county) — such crosses were the identifying mark of the many Christians among the new immigrants. The Central Asian origins of a migration that probably occurred in several waves are evoked by a gold denarius, found at Ófutak, dating from the time of the Omajid caliph Abd-al-Malik (685–705).
A set of six graves, belonging to a single family, has been fully uncovered at Csákó-Szelistye, in central Transylvania. It reveals much about both the older and the more recent aspects of the Avar empire. The family head, a military chieftain, was buried with his tarpan (a species of wild horse), a curved sabre of the new type, a distinctive pikehead, and a war axe (grave no. 3). He wore flat-soled boots; buried alongside his horse were a pair of stirrups fashioned to fit such boots — the earliest find of such an object in Transylvania. The horse's harness had the new type of mouthpiece and strapping, the latter being decorated with faleras of varying size. The man's female relatives, who had Mongolian features, wore earrings (with star-shaped and large, spherical pendants) that were the fashion of an earlier period; it may be concluded from this that only the family head belonged to the new nobility. In another family(?) burial ground dating from the same period, at Oláhgorbó, the opposite can be observed. Males were buried in modest fashion next to the richer graves of two women; one of the latter wore a pair of artfully granulated gold earrings with pendants, and the other had silver earrings that also reflected the new style. A pair of {1-239.} women's earrings of an uncommon type, found in a grave at Kisjenő, by the Fekete-Körös River, also date

https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/45.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:23:48]
from this period.
The curved sabre unearthed at Székelykeresztúr testifies to the presence of the new immigrants, as do the sabre, spear, and stirrups with flat footrests found in a grave (complete with horse) at Felenyed. The discovery at Tövis of a grave (with horse) containing objects of the newer type — rectangular belt ornaments, an earring with starshaped pendant, and a bridle with guard-rods — indicates that the newcomers were using the existing cemetery and therefore cohabited with the earlier settlers. At Aranyosgyéres, however, the grave-goods discovered so far (a stirrup with flat footrest, a bridle with guard-rods, and earrings with star-shaped pendants of the later type) reveal that the immigrants created a separate burial ground. At Marosnagylak, an isolated grave with horse (which yielded a flat-soled stirrup and a war axe) indicates that the long-established cemetery fell into disuse around this time, possibly because the newcomers squeezed out the former, Germanic-Avar settlers.
The distribution of power in the Avar empire was altered by the new influx of settlers, who established additional centres of power. In Transylvania, one such new centre was located at Gyulafehérvár, where a splendid gold ring has been unearthed. Crafted in the style of a smaller one from Ozora, the ring held a recycled, antique semiprecious gem that bore the incised outline of a peacock. The discovery of a similar ring at Újlak, in Sirmia, raises the possibility of a newly-established centre in that locality as well.
There are signs that the expansion of the new Avar power occurred not only westward and northward, but in other directions as well. Sunken floor dwellings and a cemetery have been discovered at Felsőlupkó, not far from the ancient Roman road that led along the Lower Danube to Orsova. Evidence that the settlement dates from the late 7th or early 8th century is provided by a bronze {1-240.} earring with radial decoration (Nagyekemező-type) found in one of the hovels, as well as by a crescent-shaped silver hair ornament (similar to those unearthed at Marosnagylak, Tövis, Várfalva, Baráthely no. 2, and in a Slavic burial urn at Mihályfalva). Thus the new homeland extended south of the Carpathians.

The Gyulas in Alliance with Byzantium

The Land of the Gyulas 2. FROM THE HUNGARIAN CONQUEST TO THE
MONGOL INVASION White and Black Hungarians
{1-395.} The Gyulas in Alliance with Byzantium
In 948, a sudden turn of events compelled Transylvania's gyula to adopt a policy divergent from that of the ruling prince. Prince Fajsz had dispatched his nephew, Tormás, and the harka Bulcsú to Constantinople, to renew the peace treaty; the envoys attached so much importance to the task that they had themselves baptized. It is likely that this gesture was motivated by Bulcsú's decision (for he was taking charge of foreign policy) to launch new western raids; therefore he wanted to protect his rear from Byzantine attack. Some time after 952, the gyula Zombor also presented himself at Constantinople, but he came in his own right, and not as an envoy of the ruling prince. He, too, had himself baptized, but his political goal was different from that of Bulcsú. Zombor was interested not in western raids but in the anti-Bulgar plans of the Byzantine court. The latter had never given up its ambition to crush the Bulgars and restore the old imperial borders on the Sava and Lower Danube rivers. The gyulas also considered the Bulgars, from whom they had seized the territories that lay north of the Danube and the Carpathians, to be their principal enemy. The Árpádian ruling princes would have been satisfied with Byzantine neutrality, but the gyulas sought an alliance against the Bulgars. After getting baptized, Zombor did something that neither Fajsz nor Bulcsú would have dreamed of: he brought back to Transylvania a Byzantine evangelizer. The patriarchate of Constantinople appointed Hierotheos bishop of 'Turkia'. Historians have looked for his episcopal seat in Transylvania, in or near the gyulas' capital. More recently, a seal was discovered belonging to two later bishops of the 'Turks', Theophylaktos and Antonios, and bearing on the reverse the figure of Saint Demetrius; this find has prompted speculation that the episcopal seat was located at Szávaszentdemeter (today Mitrovica), which had been founded on the site of ancient Sirmium. (Then again, the bishops' flock may have been the Vardariot Turks, near Thessaloniki!)
{1-396.} The new ruling prince of the house of Árpád, Taksony, drew a lesson from the defeat suffered by the Hungarians in 955 at Augsburg. He decided to seek peace in the West, asked the Roman pope to send him an evangelizing bishop, and launched several military campaigns against Byzantium in the years leading up to 972. Taksony thus put himself in opposition to the gyula Zombor, who was seeking security by forging ever closer links with Byzantium. Faithful to the Greek Orthodox rite, Zombor stayed aloof from the western Hungarians' raids against the Byzantine empire; he would even redeem and liberate Byzantines captured by his nominal countrymen. Zombor took a clear political stand in rejecting the ruling prince's western orientation and siding with Byzantium; he knew that the Byzantine court took a dim view of the attempts of the German king, Otto I, to revive the Carolingian empire and be crowned Holy Roman Emperor — attempts that came to fruition in 962.
Taksony regarded Zombor's Byzantine alliance as an affront to his princely authority and a threat to the political unity of the confederation of Hungarian tribes. However, since he had yet to settle his relations with the Germanic Roman empire, he avoided an open confrontation with the gyula. Instead, he followed the example of Fajsz and decided that his son and heir, Géza, should marry Sarolt, the daughter (probably still a minor) of Zombor. By the 960s, the relations between prince and gyula had become so strained that Taksony could not expect a warm welcome in Gyulafehérvár for the emissaries bearing the formal proposal. A go-between was needed — and this may be key to an enigmatic episode, related by chroniclers of 11th-century Hungary, in which a certain Kulan fell out with his brother Keán, and was supported in his battle by one Beliud, who subsequently inherited Kulan's lands. It was this Beliud who recommended that Géza and Sarolt should marry, and thus, despite a fairly common belief, Keán could hardly have been the Bulgar czar. More recent research points to the conclusion {1-397.} that, judging from their names, the brothers were quarrelling over land that is situated in Hunyad county, where there are two localities called Kaján and Kalán. Moreover, there is a locality on the Maros river, across from Gyulafehérvár, called Béld. This toponym evokes Beliud, who may have been a Transylvanian notable, perhaps a descendant of the Bár-Kalán clan. (This 'upper class' clan dates back to the conquest, when it settled along the Tisza River; it subsequently spread to the upper reaches of the Fehér-Körös River, in Transylvania, and from there — as indicated by the toponyms Bár, Kalán, and Kaján — to Hunyad county.) Since the conflict between prince and gyula could affect his own power and privileges, Beliud chose to act as peacemaker and as a go-between in the

proposed marriage. In the event, his efforts brought fruit, for Géza and Sarolt were wed. That alliance is evoked by (Maros)décse and (Magyar)décse, two estates given by the gyula to his new son-in-law, and located near the saltmines of Torda and Dés, respectively (a wedding present similar to that given by the gyula to Fajsz).
All this is informed speculation. The fact is that the arranged marriage of Géza and Sarolt served only as a temporary palliative. The Roman bishops who came to Géza's court at Esztergom after 972 took a dim view of Sarolt, who had been brought up in the Greek Orthodox faith; thanks to her, they had to contend not only with Géza's indifference to religion and the Hungarians' paganism, but also with the competing influence of the Byzantine church. Since, as Thietmar attests, Sarolt dominated her aging husband, the evangelizers blamed her for their failure to convert many Hungarians and complained that 'a religion infected with paganism is worse than barbarism itself.'[5] It is likely that the Orthodoxy professed by Sarolt was actually a mixed bag of religious beliefs derived from the various cultures, Hungarian, Pecheneg, Russian, and Bulgar, represented in the gyula's entourage. Although, prior to 1054, Roman priests could not openly condemn the Orthodoxy, {1-398.} they regarded it as the greatest obstacle to their evangelizing mission. Thus they branded as 'paganism' the version of Orthodoxy transmitted from Transylvania to the Esztergom court, while overt paganism, which they found easier to overcome, earned the epithet 'barbarism'.

AGES Monastic and Mendicant Orders
The Cultural Role of the Catholic Clergy
There is no evidence, either written or archaeological, that the Bulgars who lived in Southern Transylvania prior to the region's conquest by the gyula had an organized church, or that Christianity might have spread among Transylvania's other Slavic peoples before the 10th century. The bishopric established by the gyulas at Szávaszentdemeter belonged to the Greek, and not the Slavic rite, and there is no trace of bishops at the gyulas' court in Gyulafehérvár. The round church whose remains were excavated on the precincts of Gyulafehérvár cathedral dates back to no earlier than the 10th century. It is most unlikely, therefore, that Transylvania's Catholic episcopacy came about as the result of the Latinization of some earlier, Slavic bishopric. The interval between the subjection of Northern Transylvania and the defeat of the gyula was so brief that even if King St. Stephen had considered creating a bishopric that encompassed the northern salt route, he lacked the time to carry out such a plan. At best, the king's unrealized scheme is reflected in the attachment in the Middle Ages of the counties of Közép- and Belső-Szolnok, Kraszna, and Szatmár to the Transylvanian bishopric. After the occupation of Southern Transylvania, Gyulafehérvár passed from the gyula's to the king's authority, and it became the new episcopal seat. The bishop's authority extended over almost the entire territory of Transylvania. The only exception was the prepostship of Szeben, which was {1-530.} founded in 1192 and came under the immediate authority of the archbishop of Esztergom; it encompassed the desertum where King Géza II had settled Saxons, and came to be known as 'Altland' to differentiate it from Saxon regions that were attached to the Transylvanian episcopacy. The names of Transylvania's bishops from this time onwards can be found in codicils to royal charters, but little else is known about them.
There are grounds for believing that the Transylvanian chapter, and perhaps also the canonical school run by learned priests, was founded by King Ladislas (the Saint). Over time, most of the ecclesiastical estates around Gyulafehérvár became the property of the canon. In Southern Transylvania, the bishop retained only three villages: Sárd, Akmár, and Berve. He probably resided most of the time in the manor house at Sárd, although he owned a few small properties in the royal castle-town. It was presumably in compensation for property transferred to the chapter that the bishop received Gyalu and its dependencies, although this donation provoked a centuries-long dispute between him and the abbot of the neighbouring monastery at Kolozsmonostor.
The Transylvanian bishop was one of the wealthiest prelates in Hungary. During the reign of Béla III, his income from tithes amounted to two thousand silver marks, and, among the fourteen bishops, he ranked fourth in terms of wealth. Then, and subsequently, tithes accounted for the major part of the bishop's revenues. To protect this source, he turned against the Teutonic Knights of the Barcaság when the latter attempted to entice away tithe-paying Transylvanians, and later against Saxon gerébs who tried to draw Saxon villages outside the Altland (along with their tithes) under the jurisdiction of the prepostship of Szeben. In the course of this festering feud, the Saxons, as noted, attacked Gyulafehérvár in 1277 and burned down the cathedral. The following year, Gyulafehérvár lost its status as a royal castle town and became the property of the bishop (as did Kolozsvár for a short {1-531.} period), who proceeded to reconstruct the cathedral. However, this precipitated another conflict, with the voivode, who had been compelled to relinquish the towns and to take up quarters in fortresses in the mountains. The rivalry in the 14th century between Transylvania's three high officials — the bishop, the voivode, and the abbot of Kolozsmonostor — occasionally degenerated into armed clashes and did great damage to the church's spiritual and moral authority.
Transylvania's bishops may have been belligerent, but they were also cultured men. Until the end of the 13th century, most bishops had an aristocratic background, and study abroad had been within their means. In the 12th century, Paris was the centre of learning for Western Christians, but only wealthy Hungarians could afford to send their sons there. In 1176, the University of Paris reported directly to Hungary's king regarding the death of a student named Betlehem, who is generally considered to have issued from Transylvania's Bethlen family. This episode suggests that the king encouraged and perhaps sponsored foreign study for young aristocrats. In any case, most of them found employment at the royal court, e.g. Adorján, a royal scribe, who later became bishop of

Transylvania, and who first systematized the drafting of Hungarian charters. Another royal scribe and eventual bishop of Transylvania, named Paul, drew up in 1181 a charter regulating administrative records and establishing the royal chancellery. Thus Transylvania's bishops were selected from among the most highly educated churchmen, and the practice was maintained in the 13th century, when the lure of Paris waned and Hungarian students began to attend universities in Italy.
This shift followed a change in the social and political functions of the Hungarian clergy. Monarchs charged the bishops with diplomatic and military assignments, while canonical chapters, monasteries, and convents were designated as 'responsible institutions' (hiteles helyek) and given notarial functions. All these activities {1-532.} required legal skills, which Hungarians would seek in Bologna, Padua, and Ferrara rather than in Paris. They abandoned Paris in the century when scholastic theology and natural philosophy began to flourish at that university, with teachers such as Siger de Brabant, Roger Bacon, and Thomas Aquinas. Responding to the growing demand for clerics possessed of legal expertise, the synod of 1279 ruled that such expertise was a condition of appointment even to the relatively lowly post of archdeacon. In the event, only a few of Transylvania's archdeacons became known for their erudition. They include, in the 14th century, the chronicler János Tótsolymosi Apród, who was archdeacon at Küküllő, and, in the 16th century, the outstanding humanist Salatiel Tordai, archdeacon at Torda. University training in law was required of clerics attached to the two 'responsible institutions' in Transylvania, the monastery at Kolozsmonostor and the chapter at Gyulafehérvár, which were responsible for the northern and southern regions, respectively. Among members of the Gyulafehérvár chapter in the period 12921355, five had studied in Bologna, and two in Padua. Since the designation of 'responsible institutions' nationwide dates from 1231, it is likely that both of these Transylvanian church institutions began issuing official charters before the Mongol invasion. That must remain an assumption, for Gyulafehérvár was burnt down, and the earliest chapter records that survive date from 1278; as for Kolozsmonostor, the earliest evidence of notarial activity dates from 1288, and its actual records date from after 1334.
A more detailed picture of ecclesiastical culture in Transylvania begins to emerge in sources dating from the second half of the 13th century. Most of the surviving information concerns bishops. There were twenty-four who served in Transylvania between 1270 and 1524. Nine of these bishops came from an aristocratic background; apart for one member of a Transylvanian geréb family, they came from other parts of Hungary and bore the family names Monoszló, Szécsi, Czudar, Pálóczi, Perényi, and {1-533.} Várday. The others came variously from the lesser nobility, the urban middle class, or abroad. They included the Saxon Goblin and Péter Knoll; Benedek and Demeter, known only by their Christian names; István Upori, Balázs Csanádi, György Lépes, Gabriele Rangoni, Miklós Bácskai, Zsigmond Thurzó, and Matteo De la Biscino. The first bishop to issue from a rural market-town family, in the early 1500s, was the scholarly humanist Domokos Kálmáncsehi. By the late 1300s, all of them, regardless of their social background, had a university education or at least an equivalent level of learning. Similarly, 25–50 percent of the names of chapter canons figure in the registers of 15th-century universities; most of the twenty-five chapter preposts known to have served between 1287 and 1534 had a university degree and came from the nobility. There were some five hundred ordinary priests in Transylvania around 1300, and at least a thousand in 1500; a fair number of these were domidoctus, i.e. educated in Hungary, while some, even from small village parishes, managed to pursue studies abroad on their savings and with the help of family and patrons. Some aspects of the clergy's peregrinations will be noted below.

The Road Network 3. THE ROMAN PROVINCE OF DACIA
(Endre Tóth) The Long War, and Renewal in the Severan Era
{1-78.} Commerce and the Economy: the First Growth Phase
For the empire, the central European provinces were of little economic significance and offered negligible exports, yet required great expenditures for the stationing of troops. Nevertheless, the mineral deposits in Transylvania must have enhanced Dacia's importance to Rome. There were stone quarries as well as iron and salt deposits, but the most valuable resource was gold. Although much is known about Transylvania's gold, there is no evidence of its exploitation in Dacian times — archaeological finds indicate that the Dacians preferred silver jewellery — or about the goldmines' yield in Roman times. New information surfaced in the form of wax-coated wooden writing tablets, several of which were discovered at Verespatak in 1786, 1790, and in the 19th century, and which bear a variety of commercial texts, contracts, and accounts dating back to 131–167.
The exploitation of gold deposits (aurariae Dacicae) began shortly after the occupation of the creation of the Roman province. The goldmining centre was in the Érc Mountains (Muntii Apuseni), where miners lived in larger settlements — Ampelum (Zalatna, Zlatna) and Alburnus Maior (Abrud-Verespatak, Roşia Montana) as well as smaller ones (Deusara, Kartum, Immenosus Maior, and Vicus Pirustarum).
The mining district (territorium metalli) was the property of the Emperor, and its settlements did not benefit from local government. It is not clear whether the largest settlement, Ampelum, was granted the status of municipium. A mine procurator (procurator aurariorum) was in charge of local administration and of the gold mines. In keeping with Roman practice, these officials (ten names survive) were chosen mostly from among former slaves of the imperial household. Slaves who had earned their freedom at around age 30 might, if they performed meritoriously in other official capacities, be appointed procurator at age 40–45. The first procurator {1-79.} known by name, M. Ulpius Hermia, had been freed by Trajan and administered the district under Hadrian. This, together with the date of the earliest tablet, 131, indicates that mining began, at the latest, during Hadrian's reign. It is likely that the Dacian gold mines were under the joint administration of two procurators, one a freed slave, and the other a knight. This dual system, reserved for important installations, provided better checks and supervision, as well as administrative continuity, for the terms of office were staggered: the former slaves served longer terms as procurator than did the knights. Most of the lower-rank officials who looked after administrative and technical matters (vilici, tabularii, dispensatores) also came from the ranks of imperial slaves and freed slaves. In some cases, the librarii who served in the procurator's secretariat (officium) were drawn from the ranks of the legion XIII Gemina. They were not the only soldiers in the mining district. This important area, situated near the frontiers of the empire, had to be guarded against bandits as well as external attack. Internal security and the protection of ore and precious metal shipments was entrusted to North African soldiers of the numerus Maurorum Hispaniorum; the location of their garrison is not known. The ore was mined both in open pits (currugus) and by tunneling.
The wax tablets offer some information about this mining society, as do the epitaphs at Ampelum and Alburnus. Most of the mine workers were brought from Dalmatia, and belonged to Illyrian tribes — the Pirusti, Sardeati, and Buridusti. Some 64 per cent of the Illyrian names found in Dacia belonged to the mining district. These Illyrian miners lived in closed communities (Vicus Pirustarum), with their own tribal leaders (princeps). Following the practice in their homeland, they often called their settlements a castellum. The mines also employed workers from Asia Minor.
Most of the actual mining was probably done by wage labourers, who earned 70 or, more likely (the sources are unclear), 140 denarii a year. This was a considerable sum at a time when a lamb {1-80.} in the Alburnus region cost 3.5 denarii, and a piglet 5 denarii, prices comparable to those prevailing in the rest of the empire; wine, at 1.3–1.8 denarii a litre, was expensive.
Surviving records make no mention of the prisoners sentenced to labour in the mines (damnati ad metallum) or of the employment of slaves in other than administrative work. Slaves fetched exceedingly high prices in northern Dacia: in 139, a six-year old girl was sold for 205 denarii, while in 142, a boy was bought in the neighbourhood of



Commerce and the Economy: the First Growth Phase
https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/15.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:24:20]
the legion camp at Apulum for 600 denarii. These rates suggest that slave labour would have been unprofitable in the mines, and that there could not have been many slaves in the district or, indeed, in northern Dacia.
It also seems likely that, despite the efforts at resettlement, the mines suffered from a shortage of manpower. High wages are indicative of a tight labour market. One of the wax tablets clearly indicates that by the late 160s, the district's population was declining. On 9 February 167, before the outbreak of the great wars (and before the concealment of the tablets), the officers of the Jupiter Cernenus collegium at Alburnus disbanded the association because the membership had dwindled from 54 to 17. Thus the population was shrinking even in Dacian districts that offered well-paid employment.
Less is known about the Transylvanian iron and salt mines. These were also state property, though managed by leaseholders (conductores). The surviving epigraphs bearing a mention of the latter date from around 200. One records that Flavius Sotericus, a man of Greek origin who leased an iron mine, was also a member of the emperor's cult association at Sarmizegethusa. That inscription was found at Alsótelek (Teliucul Inferior), where the Romans had begun to exploit the large iron ore deposits of the Ruszka Mountains. The remains of an iron smelter have been uncovered at Gyalár (Ghelar), in the vicinity of Alsótelek. A number of salt mines were in production inTransylvania, in the northern part of the {1-81.} province (Homoródszentpál-Sînpaul, Szék-Sic, Kolozs-Cojocna, Homoródszentmárton-Mărtiniş, Marosújvár-Ocna-Mureşului, etc.); the operators leased not only the salt deposits but also the surface land and, in some cases, the right to trade salt.
Besides mining, little is known about the economic life of Dacia. As in other provinces, domestic crafts served mainly local demand. Agricultural and mining implements were probably fashioned from local iron. The most thoroughly investigated craft is that of ceramic houseware, although very few workshops and kilns have been discovered.
The province did not develop a common style of pottery. Shapes and finishes common in southern Dacia reveal influences coming from south of the Danube. Northern styles were more influenced by Noricum and Pannonia, as seen in the typical tripodal dishes. Northern Transylvania did give birth to a distinctively decorated ceramic that, as far as can be ascertained, was not used in other parts of the province; the sides of the roughly hemispherical bowls bore sigillary imprints. The style of the grey and pink dishes produced in large quantities in Porolissum can be readily traced back to their south Pannonian models; the sigillary decoration on the sides had been simplified, figures being replaced by geometric patterns.
Good land and fluvial communications potentially favoured trade with distant markets, while the domestic market was buttressed by the presence of a large and well-paid military force. The existence of far-reaching trade is attested by the merchant M. Secundianus Genialis (negotiator Daciscus),[30] who came from Colonia Claudia Agrippinensium (Cologne), a city that traded actively with the Danubian region; he died in Aquileia, a center and meeting point for northern and eastern trade. By way of the Sava valley and Aquileia, Dacia could link up to a major commercial artery, the Amber Road, which crossed western Pannonia. The family of Titus Fabius, which originated from Augusta Treverorum {1-82.} (Trier), on the Mosel River, also became involved in Dacian trade through Aquileia; one of their members, Fabius Pulcher, became the augustalis of the colony at Apulum (a body made up mostly of wealthy merchants and libertines). The epitaph of a woman who died in Salona (Dalmatia) relates that her husband, Aurelius Aquila, had been a town councillor at Potaissa and gives the latter's occupation as negotiator ex provincia Dacia. Macrobius Crassus styled himself protector of the merchants of Dacia Apulensis (the name given in 167 to Dacia Superior). There is evidence of close contacts between the Sava valley and Siscia: C. Titius Agathopatus had been at one and the same time the augustalis of both Siscia and Sarmizegethusa. Bricks produced in Siscia have been uncovered in the Maros valley, and the products of south Pannonian potteries also found their way to Dacia.
The presence in Dacia of many people of eastern origin facilitated contact with Syrian traders, who played an important role in the commercial life of the Roman world. The names of some of Dacia's Syrian merchants (Suri negotiatores) survive: altars to a deity of Syrian origin, Jupiter Dolichenus, were erected in Apulum by Aurelius Alexander and Flaus, and in Sarmizetgethusa by Gaianus and Proclus Apollophantes.[31]
Excavations have produced scant evidence of the actual activities pursued by Dacia's numerous merchants. It may be that they traded in goods, such as food and clothing, that leave little or no trace. There is a similar dearth of



Commerce and the Economy: the First Growth Phase
https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/15.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:24:20]
information about the export trade. The longer-established iron mines of Noricum as well as of Moesia limited the prospects of Dacia, which may, however, have exported iron to Pannonia Inferior and Moesia Inferior. The exports of salt were probably more significant: one epigraph refers to the leasing of both salt mines and trading rights. As for agricultural products, Dacia was a net importer to satisfy demand from the large number of troops stationed in the province. In any case, Transylvania's mountainous terrain did not favour grain production; most {1-83.} suitable land lay in the southeastern part of the province, on the Oltenian plain. Wild animals, such as bears and wolves, may have been exported to satisfy the Roman taste for circus games. Sheep and goats were plentiful and cheap enough to satisfy domestic demand, and perhaps some export demand as well.
A very limited range of imported goods has been unearthed in Dacia — mainly sigillated earthenware, along with some amphorae from the Mediterranean region, which were used to transport oil, wine, and grain. Food for the soldiers and their families must have accounted for a major share of the imports. According to the wax tablets, wine was expensive; this was probably due to the fact that Burebista destroyed Dacia's vineyards. Fragments of an epigraph in Thrace speak of two merchants of Syrian origin who shipped wine to Dacia. A merchant from Sarmizegethusa, Aelius Arrianus, left an epigraph on the island of Delos, where he may have been drawn by the oil or wine trade. As the economy improved, some resourceful people were inspired to replant vineyards in southern Dacia.
The biggest import item, as noted, was earthenware — fine, red, partly embossed, terra sigillata pots, dishes, bowls, and cups. In the 2nd century, these items were produced in the potteries of central Gaul and the Rhineland, and shipped down the Danube to Noricum, Pannonia, and Dacia. Such ceramics are prized by archaeologists, for it is easy to date them and identify their provenance. The finds of imported, sigillated ceramics are modest in number, but sufficient for analysis, all the more since the same pattern of dates is found throughout the province. In the 130s, following the Roman conquest, imported earthenware in Dacia Inferior came from central Gaul. Between 130–160, the main supplier was a pottery at today's Lezoux: its products account for close to half of the terra sigillata items found in Dacia. The early boom was followed by a sharp slump. The potteries at Rheinzabern and Westerndorf, which were established somewhat later than the one at Lezoux, continued to export well into the 3rd century, but their market in Dacia {1-84.} Inferior was rapidly shrinking. The origin of the sigillated earthenware found in Apulum reflected this pattern, while the incidence of central Gallic and Rheinzabern products was more uneven in Oltenia. Even there, however, there was a sharp drop in the number of Westerndorf products. The latter, which came after the central Gallic products, are completely absent in Napoca, and very few were found in the camps at Porolissum and Bucsum. Steadily growing exports from the same sources to Pannonia make the Dacian slump even more remarkable. Since reports of Transylvanian finds are few, the only observation that can be made is that the absence of late sigillatae in Napoca seems anomalous when contrasted with their continuing incidence in Apulum. This disparity may simply be the result of an unbalanced pattern of excavations. The other plausible explanation is economic. In Dacia, as in the other Roman provinces, the army was the principal beneficiary of economic expansion during Severus' rule, and Apulum was a garrison town, while purely civilian settlements like Napoca ceased to offer a ready market for imported products.
The decline of the sigillata market in Dacia may be better understood if one examines earthenware found outside the empire, in the Great Hungarian Plain. The products of the Rheinzabern and Westendorf potteries appeared in small number before 200, then came to dominate the Pannonian market for earthenware. Thus exports from Rome's western provinces continued to reach Pannonia in considerable number at a time when sales in Dacia petered out. The merchants presumably found a more proximate market, among the Sarmatians. The terra sigillatae represent the main surviving indicator of economic activity, and they suggest that after an initial spurt, Dacia's foreign trade declined in the 160s–170s. The decline cannot be fully accounted for by the appearance of domestically-produced copies, which were few in number and could complement, but not substitute for the imported product. The other type of decorated earthenware, produced in the {1-85.} northern part of the province, was only distributed in its home region. Thus the domestic production of sigillata imitations was not a cause of the decline in imports, but rather a consequence, to fill the gap in supply. The absence of imported, western ceramics confirms Dacia's economic slump in the last third of the 2nd century; future finds may facilitate a more differentiated analysis of this process.

Anonymus on the Hungarian Conquest of Transylvania
The earliest Hungarian chronicle, the 'Old Gesta', was repeatedly expanded and reworked into several versions between the 11th and the 14th centuries. Unfortunately, it offers only a brief account of how the Hungarians first occupied Transylvania, killed their leader Álmos (probably in a ritual sacrifice), and then moved on to 'Pannonia'. The source fails to make clear where Gyula was coming from when, while hunting, he chanced upon a 'white castle' (i.e. the ruins of Apulum), or what people he might have encountered there. Nor does the source put a date on the Hungarians' arrival in Transylvania; that can only be inferred from the comment that King Stephen (St. Stephen) took over Transylvania from the third Gyula, i.e. the grandson of the one just mentioned. At the beginning of the 13th century, these mysteries drew the attention King Béla III's scribe, a man who modestly signed his work Master P., and who is known to posterity as Anonymus.
Anonymus relates the Hungarian Conquest of Transylvania in chapters 23–27 of his chronicle: 'When Tas, Szabolcs, and Tétény (Thosu, Zobolsu, Tuhutum) [...] reached a depopulated region, they remained there for a few days and fortified its borders with mighty ramparts (chap. 23). They had been there for some time when Tétény, father of Horka (Tuhutum pater Horca), learned from the local people that there was a good land lying beyond the forests (terre ultra silvane), ruled by some Blak named Gyalu (Gelou quidam blacus) (chap. 24). Tétény [...] sent ahead a clever man, {1-334.} Father Agmánd Apafarkas (patrem Opaforcos Ogmand)... Tétény's spy, scouting around like a fox, took note of that land's richness and inhabitants [...] spoke often with its master [...] and learned that the land was irrigated by fine rivers, rich in alluvial gold deposits, that there was much salt to be mined, and that the inhabitants were the vilest people in the world. They are contemptible because they are Blas and Slav people (blasii et sclavi), they have only bows and arrows for weapons [...] they are much harassed by the Cumanians and the Pechenegs (chap. 25). Leaving his companions behind, Tétény headed eastward, to the land beyond the forests, to confront the Blak leader Gyalu... Gyalu rode out to meet him and halt his advance at the Meszes passes (per protas Mezesinas). But Tétény, having crossed the forest in a day, reached the waters of the Almás (Almas)... (chap. 26). There ensued a fierce struggle in which Gyalu's warriors were defeated, and many of them were killed, while many others were taken prisoner... Gyalu fled, together with a few followers, toward his fortress on the Szamos (Zomus) River, but he was killed by Tétény's warriors near the Kapus (Copus) creek. When the people of that land learned that their master was dead, they proposed peace and hailed Tétény, father of Horka, as their new leader. They testified to their loyalty by taking an oath of allegiance at a place known as Esküllő (Esculeu).'[1]
Anonymus' account of the Hungarian conquest of Transylvania must be assessed in the context of what he has to say about the entire Carpathian Basin. In his rendition, information regarding the peoples that the conquering Hungarians would find in the Carpathian Basin is conveyed by the Russian rulers of Kiev and Halych (Galicia) to Álmos when the latter passes through their lands (chaps. 9 and 11). According to the Kievans, 'that land is inhabited by Slavs, Bulgars, Blachs, and the Romans' shepherds.' The Galicians offer more detail on those who had lived in that land since Attila's death. Roman lords had occupied Pannonia as far as the Danube, and had settled their shepherds there. Bulgaria's master, {1-335.} the great khan (Keanus Magnus), had occupied the land between the Danube and Tisza rivers all the way to the Polish and Russian borders, and he settled Slavs and Bulgars in the region. The country was now ruled by one of his descendants, Salan (Salanus). (It is later revealed that one of the latter's military commanders bears the name Laborc.) The land between the rivers Tisza, Maros, and Szamos, reaching to Transylvania, had been occupied by Marót (Morout) and his 'Kozar' people; it was now ruled by his grandson Ménmarót (Menumorout). Galád (Glad), who came from Vidin, had seized, with the help of the Cumanians, the land lying between the Danube and Tisza, south of the Maros (chap. 11). The Kievans failed to mention the Khazars, and the Galicians omitted the Blachs, and the information given by the two sources did not cover the entire Carpathian Basin: it left out the part of Upper Hungary that lies west of the Garam River, as well as Transylvania. However, Anonymus later mentions these regions: the 'Slavs of Nyitra' are under the rule of the Czech prince, who appointed Zobor as their governor (chaps. 33–37), while Transylvania is inhabited by Slavs and Blachs, and ruled by the Blak Gyalu (Gelou) (chaps. 24–27). In chapter 50, Anonymus affirms that Pannonia is

ruled by the 'Romans' and populated by 'Slavs and Pannonians'. In chapter 44, Glad's Cumanian warriors are assisted by Bulgars and Blaks in their resistance to the Hungarians. Finally, with regard to Ménmarót's domain, the 'Kozárs' noted in chapter 9 earn no further mention; instead, in chapters 50 and 51, Anonymus refers to the presence of Székelys (Siculi, Sicli).
It is obvious from these references that Anonymus had simply projected back to the time of the Conquest the ethnic and political pattern that prevailed in Hungary's vicinity in his own time, i.e. in the early 13th century. At the time of the Conquest, Pannonia belonged to the Eastern Frankish empire; only after 962, when it became part of the Germanic Roman empire, could it be considered 'Roman'. Until 895, the Slavs of Nyitra had been ruled by the {1-336.} Moravians (known to the Hungarians as 'Marót'); the Hungarians seized the territory from the Moravians, and not from the Czech prince, who took control of the Moravian lands lying beyond Hungary's borders only after 955. The case of the Bulgars is even more instructive. Anonymus was evidently not aware that at the time of the Conquest, they had an independent state and were called Nándors by the Hungarians; only after 1000, when they came under Byzantine rule, did the Hungarians begin to refer to them as Bulgárs or Bolgárs. This probably explains why Anonymus considers Salanus, Menumorout, and probably Glad as well, to be subjects of Byzantium, although he does not claim that the last two are Bulgars. It was during Anonymus' lifetime, in 1185, that the Bulgars and their Romanian and Cumanian allies shook off Byzantium's yoke; and this knowledge probably inspired him to situate these three peoples (the Romanians being referred to as 'Blaks') in Glad's domain. Of the 'states' surrounding the future Hungary at the time of the Conquest, he identifies correctly only those of the Poles and the Russians, and he judges that the influence of these two states did not extend to the Carpathian Basin.
Anonymus believed that Transdanubia, the Nyitra region, the area between the Danube and the Tisza, and Transylvania were all inhabited by 'Slavs' (Sclavus), who lacked political autonomy and were ruled, respectively, by Romans, Czechs, Bulgars, and Blaks; the Hungarians expelled these rulers and subjugated the indigenous 'Slavs'. All of the above assumptions inform Anonymus' conception of the Hungarian Conquest: the Carpathian Basin had been part of Attila's empire, and Álmos, who descended from Attila, was its rightful heir. The political forces that ruled over the region after the disintegration of Attila's empire were eventually driven out by the Hungarians and survived as Hungary's neighbours, while their Slavic subjects came under Hungarian rule. Thus, according to Anonymus, the Slavs were the only people to enjoy ethnic continuity in the Carpathian Basin; the Romans, Czechs, Bulgars, and Romanians (Blaks) did not.
{1-337.} Anonymus had no need for historical data to support his view of Hungary at the time of the Conquest; he simply noted what countries adjoined the Hungary of his day, and drew retroactive conclusions. As noted earlier, Anonymus converted toponyms into the names of Conquest-era potentates; Salán, Laborc, Ménmarót, Galád, Zobor and Gyalu must have been his inventions, for none of them figure in the sources that were available to him. Indeed, although he must have been familiar with some early variant of the 'Old Gesta', he purposely ignored the names that appeared therein, such as Marót, the latter's son Svatopluk, and perhaps Keanus Magnus. By the time that Marót was mentioned in the 'Old Gesta' as Svatopluk's father, the name's derivation from the term applied to the Moravians, 'Marót', was long forgotten, and thus Anonymus could not deduce that a Moravian kingdom had existed in the Carpathian Basin at the time of the Conquest. He therefore chose to ignore Svatopluk, relegated Marót and the great khan to a distant past, and imagined that the Hungarians encountered these figures' descendants, to whom he gave the names Ménmarót and Salán. He considered that the 'Old Gesta' was not a reliable source, particularly in its claim that the Hungarian conquerors' first stop had been Transylvania. He preferred to believe that the Hungarians had moved in through the Verecke Pass, and that the name applied by foreigners to these Magyars — Ungari, Hungari — was derived from the first locality that they occupied, Ungvár, or Hungvár. He further believed that their main enemies had been the Bulgars, and not the Moravians. Historians later speculated that Anonymus culled the notion of 'Romans' shepherds' from the 'Old Gesta'. This may not be the case, for the first authentic reference to this dates from 1147, when Odo de Deuil, who had travelled across Hungary, situated the pastures of Julius Caesar (i.e., the Romans) in that land. Thus the information may have come from a French source, and it may well have been conveyed back by none other than Anonymus, who had pursued studies in Paris.
{1-338.} The first mention of Transylvania in Anonymus' chronicle is in chapter 11, where he refers to it by the Hungarian name Erdeuelu. He notes that it lay on the eastern border of the domain of Menumorout, the lord of Bihar, but then seems to forget about the place. It may be surmised that if Anonymus neglected to mention the

https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/59.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:24:31]
ruler and people of Transylvania, it is because he was unwilling to broach the matter of that region's conquest perhaps because he did not want to contradict the 'Old Gesta', which, as noted, indicates that the Hungarians had made their first stop in Transylvania. However, while working on his chronicle, he came across information that compelled him to take some account of Transylvania. Unwilling to alter his initial thesis, Anonymus turned history on its head; his Hungarians, instead of moving westward from Transylvania, are depicted as entering that region from the west.
In Anonymus' rendition, Árpád, who was encamped at Szerencs, dispatched three of the seven chieftains, Tas, Szabolcs, and Tétény, to confront Menumorout (chaps. 20–23). They conquered the northern part of Menumorout's domain: the forces of Tas and Szabolcs advanced to the fortress at Szatmár, while the rest of the army, led by Tétény and his son, Horka, occupied the Nyírség as far as the Ér River. When the two armies reunited at the Meszes Pass, the chieftains 'decided to draw the border of Árpád's country [...] at the point where the land ceased to be inhabited'; there they marked the frontier with a stone gate and felled trees. The story's logical continuation would be the return of Tas and Szabolcs to Szerencs after their victory, but this happens only in chapter 28; forgetting that he has already related the marking of the conquered land's eastern border, Anonymus inserts four chapters (24–27) describing Tétény's military campaign in Transylvania. He concludes that tale as follows: 'Tétény ruled in peace and with good fortune over the conquered land, which remained in the hands of his descendants until the reign of St. Stephen. Tétény begot a son, {1-339.} Horka, who had two sons, named Gyula (Geula) and Zombor (Zumbor). Gyula had two daughters, Karold (Caroldu) and Sarolt (Saroltu). King St. Stephen was the son of Sarolt. And Zombor's son was the younger Gyula (minor), father of Buja and Bonyha (pater Bue et Bucne). It was during this Gyula's rule that St. Stephen seized the lands beyond the forest. Gyula had been too proud to become a Christian and, although related to the king's mother, had often acted in a manner hostile to St. Stephen; he was therefore taken in fetters to Hungary and kept imprisoned for the rest of his life.'
Anonymus digresses in relating Tétény's Transylvanian campaign and, what is worse, becomes mired in contradictions. Tétény, unlike Tas, Szabolcs, and their relatives, disappears from the narrative. When Anonymus returns in chapter 50 to the story, begun in chapter 22, of the expedition against Menumorout, new names figure as the army's leaders, men who had previously conquered Transdanubia. Forgetting apparently that he had already related how Tétény occupied Transylvania, he now has Menumorout fleeing to that region — a curious choice, since he would have been heading straight into the arms of the Hungarian occupiers. Moreover, Anonymus fails to make good on his promise in chapter 6 to relate how the Maglód clan was descended from Tétény. Instead, he affirms in chapter 27 that the Gyulas of Transylvania descended from Tétény. The scribe credits Tétény with the conquest of Transylvania, turns Tétény's grandson Gyula into the Gyula who rules Transylvania, and says nothing about a Maglód clan. In fact, there are no documents testifying to the existence of such a clan. A clan bearing the double name Gyula-Zombor did live in the diocese of Vác during the Middle Ages, but there is no documentary evidence to link them to the Transylvanian Zsombors. With regard to Tétény's son and grandson, Horka and Gyula, Anonymus was not aware that 'Gyula' and 'Harka' (as well as another name in his chronicle, 'Kende') served merely as honorifics {1-340.} at the time of the Conquest, and became proper names only during the monarchy. Thus Tétény may have been a 'harka', and the father of another 'harka', but it is not known whether he was related to two subsequent 'harkas' who lived in the mid-900s and whose proper names were Kál and Bulcsú.
While it is evident that Anonymus had converted honorifics into the real names Gyula and Horka, the source of the name Tétény is less clear: he may have borrowed it from a Hungarian family's legend, or from the locality, on the Danube, called Tétény. Gelou was an authentic personal name as well as a toponym that is noted in the chronicle: the fortress of Gyalu, at the confluence of the Szamos and Kapus rivers. This Hungarian name, of ancient Turkic origin, occurs as a toponym in other regions of Hungary as well. Curiously, Anonymus did not choose a royal castle — such as Kolozsvár or Doboka, both proximate to the scene of his story — for the seat of the Transylvanian Blak leader. Instead, he opted for the Transylvanian bishop's castle at Gyula — perhaps because it was the closest major fort in relation to the Almás River and the Meszes Pass, and because it sounded similar to the leader's name, Gyalu.
The derivation of the term 'Blach' is somewhat clearer. The most likely source is the early 12th-century Russian chronicle of Niestor, which Anonymus either consulted or learned about from the Hungarian entourage of Prince András when the latter served as Galicia's ruler between 1188 and 1190. According to Niestor, the Hungarian conquerors encountered Volohs (Volohi) and Slavs in the Carpathian Basin: 'The Slavs were the earlier inhabitants,



Anonymus on the Hungarian Conquest of Transylvania
https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/59.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:24:31]
but their land had been occupied by the Volohs. Then the Hungarians (Ugri) expelled the Volohs, appropriated the land, and settled down among the Slavs, making the latter their subjects; ever since, the land has been known as that of the Hungarians (Ugorska).'[2] The significance of 'Volohs' is revealed in an earlier passage of the chronicle, when Niestor, listing the peoples of Europe, situates the Volohs near England; thus, for Niestor, 'Voloh' identified the French, and, {1-341.} more broadly, all the peoples who spoke neo-Latin or belonged to the Roman empire. However, Anonymus could not know that Niestor's Volohs were one and the same as the 'Romans' who, in his own chronicle, were expelled from Transdanubia by the Hungarians, and he therefore situated them elsewhere in the Carpathian Basin. This is why, in chapter 9, he makes separate mention of the 'Blachs' and of the 'Romans' shepherds'. He evidently associated the latter with the Germanic Roman empire, observing that even in his own day, 'they continued to graze upon Hungary's wealth'; thus he held them to be important foreigners, and not mere shepherds. As for Niestor's Volohs, Anonymus noted the similarity between their name and that of the VlachRomanian elite in the Bulgar-Romanian empire; and since he believed that there had been indigenous Slavs in Transylvania, he conveniently identified their masters with the Volohs who, according to Niestor, had ruled over Slavs and been expelled by the Hungarians.
Anonymus referred to the Blaks as soldiers in Glad's domain, which lay between the Danube, Tisza, and Maros rivers. Therefore, in his view, the Blaks were not oppressed commoners but rather the ruling elite or at least armed 'freemen'. There has been some speculation that Anonymus' Blaks were the Turkic people who are mentioned in medieval sources as bearing the same name and living east of the Carpathians, but this hypothesis does not bear the test of scholarly scrutiny. Judging from his account of Glad, Anonymus could only have been referring to the Vlach-Romanian warriors of the Bulgar-Romanian empire, who were assisted by the Cumanians. This would have been consistent with his belief that the Hungarians had driven out of the Carpathian Basin the Slavs' former masters, and that, in his day, the latter could only be found along or beyond Hungary's frontiers. In fact, this picture coincided to some extent with the situation in Anonymus' time: the Bulgar-Romanian empire, founded in 1185, had a common border with Hungary along the upper reaches of the Lower Danube, and reliable {1-342.} sources indicate that there were Vlach-Romanians living in the Southern Carpathians.
As noted, Anonymous drew on Niestor to conclude that Gelou's people were a mixture of Slavs and Blaks (Blasii, Blaci). In Anonymus' account, there are Slavs in almost all regions of the Carpathian Basin, but they are always depicted as being the subjects of another people: Salán the Bulgar settled Slavs between the Danube and the Tisza, the Czech Prince imposed his rule over the Slavs of Nyitra, the Slavs and Pannons of Transdanubia were ruled by the 'Romans', i.e. by the Germanic Roman empire, and the Transylvanian Slavs were ruled by a Blak. The masters were expelled by the Hungarians, the Slav commoners stayed put. When Anonymus wrote his 11th chapter, he apparently knew nothing about the inhabitants and rulers of Transylvania, and he was directly inspired by Niestor's chronicle to apply the standard formula to that region. He entertained two notions regarding the Romanians. The first, that the Bulgaro-Romanian empire included Vlach-Romanians, was accurate; the second, that they were one and the same as Niestor's Volohs (i.e, the Franks of Transdanubia), was patently false.
His confusion is underscored by his inconsistent spelling. In chapter 9, he assigns to the Balkan Romanians the name 'Blach', which has a Greek tonality; this name was also used by literate Byzantines and at the papal chancellery (e.g. Rex Bulgarorum et Blachorum). However, in chapters 24–26, which deal with Transylvania, he adopts two further spellings: he refers to Gelou as a Blacus, dux Blacorum, and to Gelou's people as Blasii et Sclavi. The name 'blacus' has a French ring, and, in fact, on their way across the Balkans, French crusaders had encountered the Romanians. The latter's Greco-Slavic name was spelt 'Blach' and pronounced 'Vlach', but the crusaders pronounced it and spelt it 'Blak'. This French variant was subsequently borrowed by the Hungarian chancellery and declined as in Latin: blacus, blacci, {1-343.} blacorum. The first trace in Hungarian sources of this ethnic designation is the phrase, terra [...] exempta de Blaccis, in a court document dating from 1223. The forest of the Blaks and Pechenegs (silva Blacorum et Bissenorum) is mentioned in a royal document (the Andreanum, see below) drafted in 1224 but known only from a transcription made in 1317. Around 1231, German knights at the papal court forged a Hungarian royal document (purportedly dating from 1222) in which there is reference to the terra Blacorum; the more Byzantine-style terra Blachorum figures in this document's papal endorsement. Only the French-style 'Blak' figures in Hungarian documents until 1247, when the Hungarian vernacular term Oláh first appears; it was derived — probably via the variant Volah — from the Greco-Slavic Vlach. The plural of the word Oláh, Vlasi (= Olasz, which means 'Italian' in Hungarian) had been used earlier in the vernacular to refer to neoLatin peoples — but not to the Romanians. However, after 1247, the Hungarian chancellery would only use the

https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/59.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:24:31]
terms Olacus and Olachus, which were Latinized versions of the vernacular Oláh.
It is likely that Anonymus was aware of the Hungarian chancellery's name for the people that he had called the Blaks of Transylvania, for from chapter 24 onwards he employs the French spelling. On the other hand, in chapters 9 and 25, he also uses the spelling Blachi and Blasii, which indicates that he was familiar with the pronunciation of the Greco-Slavic Vlach and of the Slavic plural Vlasi; it was thus in imitation of Niestor that he located the VlachRomanians in Transylvania. In light of the above, the thrust of Anonymus' account is not that northern Transylvania was inhabited in his day by Vlacho-Romanians, but the very opposite: that they had been driven out of the region, or, more precisely, that they did not live there.

The Hungarian Settlement of Transylvania
In light of Transylvania's geographic endowment, it is understandable that Anonymus 'led' the Hungarian conquerors to the place that best suited their traditional way of life, the small plain known as the Mezőség. The Hungarians' presence in this region is attested by archaeological finds from the 10th century, 11th-century written sources, and toponyms that in some cases can be traced back to the 10th century.
Since Anonymus' purpose in writing his chronicle was to relate the 'origins of the kings and nobles of Hungary', the events concerning Transylvania had to serve this end. Judging from his accurate placement of Gyalu castle, the village of Esküllő, and the Almás, Kapus, and Szamos rivers, he had reliable information about the Kis-Szamos region, and indeed the text reveals his sources: members of the Zsombor and Agmánd clans, who were happy to pass on their family legends and thereby help the author to authenticate their ancient property rights.
Unfortunately, it is not clear who the Zsombors identified as their ancestor at the time of the conquest, for Anonymus embellished their ascendance, tracing it back to Tétény's grandson Zombor, though he fails to indicate who were the latter's sons; as for Tétény's other grandson, Gyula, Anonymus affirms that his sons Buja and Bonyha were banished by King St. Stephen from Transylvania. In fact, as has been noted, the Maglód (or GyulaZombor) clan lived in the diocese of Vác and had nothing in {1-372.} common with the Transylvanian Zsombor clan. The similarity of the family names Zombor and Zsombor helped Anonymus to concoct a fictitious family tree. With regard to Agmánd clan, it is clear that they traced their ancestry to Apafarkas and his son Agmánd; the former inspired their coat of arms, which sported a wolf (farkas = wolf), the latter their family name. In all likelihood, it was information provided by the Zsombor and Agmánd clans that led Anonymus to associate the names Gyula and Gyalu, and to link his account of Transylvania's conquest to the person of Tétény. To be sure, the two clans, according to their family legends, descended from original settlers in the Kis-Szamos valley. The Zsombors probably claimed to be descended from one of the seven chieftains, for their coat of arms held a lion; this animal had been the totemic emblem of tribal leaders and figured on the crests of the ruling élite. Thus Anonymus, helped by the similarity in the names Zombor and Zsombor, obliged the clan by making the chieftain Tétény their ancestor.
Anonymus's story, cobbled together from disparate elements, would be of little relevance were it not for the fact that the Zsombors' and Agmánds' properties were all located in Transylvania, north of the Maros, indicating that these families were indeed descendants of the original settlers in the region. The question remains, when did this settlement actually occur? According to evidence from other parts of Hungary (e.g. Komárom county), when the feudal state was established, two thirds of the land (and people) belonging to the clan chiefs (who were called bő) was taken away and converted into the megye (a word that came to mean 'county') of royal castles. Research has shown that as late as the 13th century, the Zsombor family still owned around a third of the land in Doboka county, divided in two parts. The first was situated to the left of the Kis-Szamos and extended to the Almás valley; its principal locality was (Magyarnagy)zsombor, and it also encompassed Drág, Milvány, Ugruc, Esküllő (cf. Anonymus's {1-373.} story), Adalin, Szótelke, (Ördög)keresztúr, (Réce)keresztúr, Szentkatolna, (Magyar)fodorháza, and Sólyomkő (also called Elefánt), as well as many villages that no longer exist. The second property, fifty kilometres east of the Kis-Szamos, straddled the Mélyes creek in the Mezőség; the villages there included (Szász)zsombor, Mányik, Kékes, (Szász)móric, and (Dellő)apáti. Most of these toponyms (including some of Slavic derivation) are personal names, rendered in the nominative and without suffix or article, which was the Hungarians' practice between 900 and 1270. Equally Hungarian are two toponyms that date from the 13th century and identify the patron saint of the local church: Keresztúr (= Holy Cross) and Szentkatolna (= Saint Catherine).
The many toponyms that date from after the Mongol invasion and contain the word telek indicate that the land owned by the Zsombors had been settled prior to the 13th century; the addition of 'telek' to an earlier toponym signified that the site, once settled, was now deserted. Most of these deserted villages bear old-style Hungarian toponyms: Póstelke, Lőrincszigete, Váma, Mikustelke, Kéthorpágy, Örkénytelke, Fikacstelke, Tibatelke,



The Hungarian Settlement of Transylvania
https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/65.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:24:42]
Berketelke, Palota, Rigótelke, and Boroszló. It is likely that the original centre of the Zsombor clan's domain was the castle later known as Doboka, and that the salt-mine at Szék also belonged to them. When the royal county of Doboka was established, the castle and the salt-mine became royal property, as did the proximate villages (preexisting or newly-settled) of Kend, Poklos(telke), Lózsárd, and Inak. The soldiers and servants of the royal county organization were settled nearby — the former at Cseh and Jenő, the latter at Udvarnok and Kovácsi. The episcopal properties that lay farther east, near Harina and between the Lekence and the Sajó rivers, were probably owned originally by the Zsombor family, and had been appropriated by the king before being transferred to the Church.
{1-374.} Similarly, the royal castle of Belső-Szolnok county, at Dés, and the Désakna mine lay on land once owned by the Agmánd clan; the latter still owned property to left of the Szamos (Keménye, Szekerestörpény, Gyékényes, Kodor, Szükerék, Ormány) as well as on the right bank (Péterháza, Boncnyíres, Hesdát, Bodzástelke). The Agmánds also had property farther afield, around the Lekence valley in the Mezőség: (Uzdi)szentpéter, (Nyulas)néma, Mező(rücs), and a few other villages that have disappeared.
Thus it appears that the Zsombor and Agmánd clans settled along both banks of the Kis-Szamos in the 10th century, well before the establishment of the royal county system, and that they were subsequently compelled to surrender two thirds of their land, including castles and salt-mines, to the king. By extension, one can assume that other, exclusively Transylvanian clans whose properties were divided up in this fashion also descended from the original settlers. There are three such clans, the Kalocsa, Borsa, and Mikola, the latter being named after its earliest known ancestor.
The Borsa clan, who in the 13th century also acquired land in Bihar county, possessed ancestral holdings around Kolozsvár and the Kolozs salt-mine, at Kolozsborsa, Kolozsgyula, Macskás, Szentpál, and Saság (to the left of the Kis-Szamos), as well as at Ajtony, Novaj, Mezőszentgyörgy, Mezőszentmárton, and Majos (on the right bank). Wedged between them lie royal properties: Lomb, Pata, Szopor, Szovát, along with two settlements that appear to have been reserved for the military, (Mező)őr and (Mező)keszü, and another, Udvarnok, whose name indicates that it was inhabited by servants.
The northern branch of the Kalocsa clan was called Szil. In the 13th century, Szil properties stretched along the northwestern edge of the Zsombors' domain and included Kalocsa, Szentpéter, and Mikó, as well as Szili and other extinct villages. This branch's name died out in the mid-1300s, but the southern branch of the family, called Tyukod, survived. The latter's ancestral holdings, clustered {1-375.} around Torda castle and the Tordaakna salt-mine, included Detrehem, Mindszent, Egerbegy, Kók, Tóhát, Szentkirály, Szentmárton, Füged, and Bányabükk, as well as the now extinct Tordalaka and Szarkad. In 1270, Székelys from Kézd were resettled amidst these villages on twenty-one sites that were part of the royal estate of Torda. The Székely villages all bear Hungarian names, such as Dombró (a 10th-century borrowing from Slavic), Örményes and Igrici — both names evoke royal servants, for the first comes from örlőmalmos, meaning 'miller', while the second means 'minstrel' — and, farther east, Megyer, where lived the royal castle's serfs.
Finally, there is a clan whose common name is not known, but which had many branches, including the Mikola, Gyerő, Kemény, Kabos, Radó, Tompa, Vitéz, and Veres. Their estates were spread around Gyalu castle, a royal property that had been transferred to the Church to become an episcopal seat. The clan owned properties in the valleys of the Kapus and the Nádas rivers, at Gyerőmonostor, Gyerővásárhely, Pányik, Kapus, Derite, Bedecs, Erdőfalva, Inaktelke, Szamártelke, Boc, Andrásháza, Tamásháza, Topa, Szentmihály, Szentkirály, and Berend; and east of Kolozsvár, along the bend of the Kis-Szamos River, at Dezmér, Szentmiklós, and Szamosfalva, which lay close to the salt-mine at Kolozsakna.
Hungarian clans often had a common monastery to serve all their branches. Of the monasteries that belonged to the five clans in northern Transylvania, one only has been clearly identified, that of the Mikola clan. Built prior to the Mongol invasion, it was eventually named Gyerőmonostor, after one of the clan's families. A common coat of arms symbolized the unity of this clan, which had many branches. The monastery at Almás, mentioned in sources dating from 1294–1320, was probably owned by the Borsa clan; the buildings were later destroyed, and never rebuilt, but the locality continued to bear the name Monostor-Almás well into the 15th century.
{1-376.} Although the five Hungarian clans established between the Szamos and the Maros cannot all be linked to



The Hungarian Settlement of Transylvania
https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/65.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:24:42]
known monasteries, each of them had a coat of arms that characterized a clan at the time of the Conquest. Each of these crests bore the figure of an animal: a lion for the Zsombor clan, a wolf for the Agmánds, a deer for Gyerős, a fish for the Borsas, and a bird for the Kalocsas. All five clans owned large blocks as well as scattered parcels of property, spread around royal (or episcopal) castles and salt-mines on both sides of the Szamos; judging from the location of these properties, the royal counties and episcopal holdings had been carved out of the clans' original estates.
The evidence also suggests that in the early period of settlement, clan families, or at least the shepherds, periodically moved their flocks from one pasture to another along the Kis-Szamos and other rivers. This pasturerotation is indicated by pairs of toponyms, identifying sites some 50 km. apart, on both sides of the Kis-Maros: (Magyarnagy)zsombor — (Szász)zsombor, Buda (today's Bodonkút) — (Buda)telke, (Szarvas)kend Ken(d)telke, Kecsed — (Mező)kecsed, (Oláh)péntek — (Szász)péntek, Néma — (Nyulas)néma, (Szekeres)törpény — (Szász)törpény, and (Kolozs)gyula — Gyulatelke. These toponyms are derived from old Hungarian and Slavic proper names, and were evidently applied before the early Hungarian toponymic custom died out around 1270; and many of them are found on estates of the clans that may be counted among the original settlers. The two places called Zsombor were in the ownership of the Zsombor clan as late as the 14th century, and the location of the two Budas, as well as that of the two Kends, points to the likelihood that these sites, too, belonged to that clan. Since Kecsed and Szekerestörpény belonged to the Agmánd clan, it is likely that the latter also owned the two corresponding sites on the right side of the Kis-Szamos; similarly, since the Agmánds owned (Nyulas)néma, on the right bank, it can be assumed that Néma, on the left bank, was also their property, {1-377.} particularly since Néma was situated close to other Agmánd holdings. The location of the two places called Péntek also points to Agmánd ownership. Apparently, the Agmánd clan had been granted land on the northern and eastern fringes of the original settlement area. This conclusion is consistent with Anonymus' contention that Agmánd had acted as scout for the leader of advancing Hungarians; his clan continued to perform this function on the periphery of the conquered land.
It is likely that the paired sites served to demarcate pastures belonging to the several family heads in each clan; this would explain why they are found on the periphery of the clans' original area of settlement. The paired sites became isolated from each other when the king expropriated the most valuable, central parts of these clan estates, along with their castles and salt-mines. (There may well have been additional paired sites, belonging to the three other clans; countless villages were destroyed by the Mongol invaders and disappeared from memory.
The date at which the estates were partially expropriated can serve as one reference point for estimating when the five clans originally settled in the region. Archaeological finds and Anonymus' chronicle point to the 10th century, but there is a more precise indicator: the toponyms (Szamos)jenő and (Mező)keszü, in the Kis-Szamos valley, and Megyer (later extinct), on the north bank of the Maros, which bear the names of three out of the seven Hungarian tribes. As was known long ago, and recently confirmed by research, the ruling prince's army consisted of soldiers recruited from the tribes, and the settlement of these soldiers occurred in the 10th century, ending during the reign of Stephen. The conquering tribes' names were not preserved in Hungarian legend; our knowledge comes from the notation made by the Byzantine Emperor Constantine in around 950. By the early 11th century, the names had faded from memory, for the Árpádian ruling princes generally drew tribal warriors — the jobbágy (later to mean serfs or villeins) — i{1-378.} nto their personal military service, and then settled the soldiers on land that they had taken away from the tribes; much of this land was inhabited by Slavs, either native-born or brought in as slaves.
When, at the end of the 10th century, Hungary was reorganized into a kingdom, this warrior class provided the officers — the 'castle warrior' — at the castles that served as royal county seats. Around these centres, there were generally several settlements bearing the name of one of the tribes, but only three were found in Transylvania: Jenő near Doboka castle, Keszü near Kolozs castle, and Megyer, which may have been attached Torda castle. This indicates that at the time counties were formed in Transylvania, most of the tribal soldiers who served in the princely retinue had already settled elsewhere; and that, in turn, implies the tribes in Transylvania were subjected to the authority of the supreme ruler or king rather late, probably during the early part of Stephen's reign. This hypothesis is reinforced by the fact that the first ispán (count) of Doboka county was closely related to King St. Stephen (according to the chronicles, the count's son, Csanád, was a nephew or cousin of Stephen). Earlier, the castle had probably served as the Zsombor clan's stronghold, and it acquired the name of its count when the royal county was established, just as Marosvár was renamed after Csanád.

Since the five clans in Transylvania retained a third of their estates, it is very likely that they had submitted peacefully to the expropriation mandated by the king. And in that case, a member of the Zsombor clan may well have been appointed royal count of Doboka — a post that was rewarded with one third of the taxes collected in the county. The case of Torda county reinforces this hypothesis. As noted, the castle at Torda may have been the political centre of the Kalocsa (a.k.a.Tyukod) clan's original settlement area. One of the earliest-named properties retained by the clan after expropriation was Tordalaka (in the vicinity of today's Aranyoslóna). Since the suffix laka indicates very early toponyms, {1-379.} it is most likely that at the time of King St. Stephen, a prominent member of the Kalocsa clan was called Torda (a name that occurs in other parts of Hungary as late as the 13th century), that he became the royal count of the clan's expropriated land, and that he gave his name to the castle taken from his clan. The earliest documentary reference to a Transylvanian royal castle dates from 1075, and it is to Torda. One of the properties retained by this count, probably his personal residence, is located near the castle and bears the owner's name.
Thus Doboka and Torda counties (and probably [Belső-] Szolnok and Kolozs counties as well) were established at the end of the 10th century, and, in the process, the five clans had to transfer to the king two thirds of their estates and many of their subjects. The clans obviously must have settled in Transylvania at an earlier date. According to the plausible legend related in several chronicles, the Hungarians, under Álmos's command, conquered Transylvania. Their next move is not entirely clear. Maybe the Hungarians proceeded en masse to the DanubeTisza plain, leaving behind some soldiers to guard the hunting grounds, pastures, and mines of Transylvania. The legend, recorded by Anonymus, holds that the conquering tribes initially set the eastern boundary of their domain at the Meszes Pass; perhaps they wanted to keep a buffer zone, several days' march wide, between themselves and the Pechenegs, one that would absorb the brunt of the latter's attacks. The danger of Pecheneg incursions was very real, and as late as the 11th century, eastern nomads launched raids across northern Transylvania, all the way to the Nyírség. In the 10th as much as in the 11th century, these threats warranted the military occupation and defence of Transylvania.
Thus Anonymus' assertion is plausible, that the Hungarian tribes occupied the Mezőség as well the region between the Maros and Nagy-Szamos rivers in Transylvania in the first wave of settlement, and that the Zsombor and Agmánd clans played a leading {1-380.} role in this conquest. There are several indications of their links with the tribes that settled farther to the west. First, the vast county of Szolnok, which encompassed the Nagy-Szamos valley and the region around the Meszes Pass, was eventually subdivided into Outer, Central, and Inner parts, but it remained under the governance of a single count; it was the site of the salt-route, which passed through Szalacs to Szolnok, from where the salt was shipped on the Tisza River. Second, the bishop of Transylvania was from the start given authority over Szatmár and Kraszna, two counties that lay beyond that region but were on the salt-route. Numerous toponyms in the region between the Maros and Nagy-Szamos in Transylvania correspond to placenames in Szatmár (e.g. Kend — Kékkend, Kapjon — Kaplony), on the western fringe of Szabolcs (Zsombor Zombor), and along the Szamos in Szatmár county (e.g. Bogát — (Nyír)bogát and Ogmándlovamezeje, to which there is only one documentary reference, dating from 1342, and which is the sole toponym bearing the name of the Agmánd clan). This evidence indicates that when the Hungarians moved westward from Transylvania, at least the major part of one of the tribes remained behind to supervise the salt-route, and this tribe kept contact via the Szamos valley and the Meszes Pass with those who had settled down between the Danube and the Tisza: the other six tribes and their Kabar allies (who had one, or up to three tribes).
There is further, corroborative evidence. Transylvania is the only region of Hungary where estates belonging to a 'ruling class' clan (the lion-crested Zsombors) could be found scattered among the holdings of ordinary clans. Moreover, the castles of four of clans in question — at Dés, Doboka, Kolozs, and Torda — were converted into royal county seats; and if the fifth, Gyalu, is an exception, it is because that castle soon became the seat (probably the first) of Transylvania's bishop, before the latter moved to Gyulafehérvár. This may be the reason why, of the seven bishoprics {1-381.} founded by King St. Stephen, the Transylvanian is the only one named after a province, and not a castle. The close links between the five clans are also indicated by the fact that five deaconries were created in the region between the Szamos and the Maros, at Szolnok, Doboka, Kolozs, Uzd, and Torda; although they do not correspond exactly with the four counties (Belső-Szolnok [Dés], Doboka, Kolozs, and Torda), their number and territory probably indicate an earlier administrative structure. When the Székelys of Marosszék were resettled in the region, the southern boundary may have been modified, leading to the abolition of Uzd county; that county's

centre had been the castle and church which were excavated at Malomfalva.
In keeping with the above analysis, the first Hungarian settlement of the region between the Szamos and the Maros should be regarded as an occupation by elements linked to other Hungarians situated farther to the north and west. This occupation did not originally extend south of the Maros River. There a wholly different social and political structure emerged, and no traces were found of estates belonging to the conquering clans; the eventual settlers were probably propertied families who moved here from the western parts of the country. A further hypothesis is that the clans which occupied the region between the Maros and the Szamos all belonged to the same conquering tribe and were led by the Zsombor clan. In Transylvania, the process of adapting the ancient tribal structures to the new political forms, first the principality, then the monarchy, was slower than in the rest of the country, and the older type of property relations endured longer. The settlement in Transylvania of the tribe that consisted of the Agmánd, Kalocsa, Borsa, and Mikola clans under the leadership of the Zsombor clan, was thus part and parcel of the original conquest; these conquerors stayed, and for a time they preserved their tribal structure.

The Hungarian Settlement of Transylvania 2. FROM THE HUNGARIAN CONQUEST TO THE
MONGOL INVASION The Land of the Gyulas
{1-382.} Gyula and the Gyulas
The conclusion that Transylvania was settled by one of the original conquering tribes is based not only on family legends and the property structure but also on contemporary reports that in the mid-900s, the Hungarians had a tribal structure. In his account of Byzantine government, Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenetos listed the names of the seven Hungarian tribes and of the Kabar tribe; he observed that in addition to each tribe's chieftain, the Hungarians had a higher leadership that consisted of a prince (in Greek: megas archon), a gyula, and a harka. An earlier Moslem source refers to the prince by the Hungarian word kende and also mentions the gyula, but not the harka. Constantine noted that these titles should not be confused with proper names: 'It should be borne in mind that the harka Bulcsú is the son of Kál, the harka, and that while Kál is a proper name, harka is a title, just like gyula, which ranks higher than harka.'[4] This account dates from Bulcsú's visit to Byzantium in 948. The emperor's explanatory note was apposite, for confusion could arise involving title and personal name, as it did in the work of a contemporary Arab historian, Ibn Haijjan. When, in 942, the latter met Hungarians who had been captured in the course of their campaign in the Moorish-held region of what is today Spain, he inquired about their leaders; as he records it, the Hungarians said that their second-ranking chief was the gyula (a title), and that their third-ranking leader was Bulcsudi (the personal name of the harka). The study of Hungary's history in the 10th century is complicated by the fact that the titles in the tribal alliance, and indeed the names of tribes noted by Emperor Constantine had faded from memory as the tribal alliance disintegrated. As a result, medieval chroniclers were not aware of the tribes' names and would use the three highest titles as personal names; this happened with kende or kündü (Kund) and gyula in the 'Old Gesta', and with the same titles as well as harka in {1-383.} Anonymus' chronicle. The chroniclers were not alone in making this mistake; all three titles would appear frequently as late as the 12th century in the form of personal names and toponyms.
The fusion of personal names and titles was not specific to the Hungarians. 'Charlemagne' gave rise to the Slavic kral, which inspired the Hungarian király (king), which in turn became crai in Romanian. In Hungary, the pattern was reversed, for the titles were converted into personal names, but there remained traces of the original meaning, for at times the title and personal name would be used to designate father and son, or two brothers. Anonymus does this in his passages on Transylvania. In drawing Tétény's family tree, he attributes two sons to Horka, Gyula and Zombor; Gyula is said to have two daughters, Karold and Sarolt, while Zombor has two sons, Buja and Bonyha. Both the 'Old Gesta' and Anonymus affirmed that Sarolt had been the wife of Prince Géza and mother of King St. Stephen. Yet two reliable sources, the Altaich Annals (1003) and Bishop Thietmar of Merseburg (d. 1018) maintain that the Transylvanian gyula who was defeated by King St. Stephen was the king's uncle (avunculus); the former refers to him by his title, Iulus rex, while the latter calls the gyula by his personal name, Prokuj senior. In an expanded, 13th-century version of the 'Old Gesta', Sarolt is again presented as daughter of the Transylvanian Gyula, wife of Prince Géza, and mother of King St. Stephen, and it is the 'third' Gyula who is imprisoned in 'Pannonia' by King St. Stephen. In the Altaich Annals, it is the wife of Iulus rex and their two sons (identified by Anonymus as Buja and Bonyha) who are taken into captivity by King St. Stephen; according to Thietmar, it is 'Prokuj's' wife who suffers this fate. It becomes apparent that Anonymus believed 'Zombor gyula' (i.e. Zombor the gyula) to be two persons, the brothers Zombor and Gyula, and he divided up the gyula's children between the two imaginary brothers; and since in this case, the 'younger Gyula' could not be the uncle of King St. Stephen, Anonymus concluded that he was merely 'related to the king's mother'.
{1-384.} If Anonymus failed to distinguish between title and personal name in the case of the gyula Zombor, it is likely that he made the same mistake with other titles as well. Anonymus reports that the tribal chieftain Künd descended from Kurszán; in fact, Kurszán was a kündü, and Anonymus turned that title into the name of a son. Reversing the mistake, he affirms that the father of the gyula Zombor was called Horka, when in fact he must have simply borne the title of harka. Since titles were passed on from father to son (Constantine noted that Árpád's sons and grandsons were princes, and that the harka Bulcsú was the son of the harka Kál), it is likely that Tétény, too, was a harka. In the case of the father, the title is missing; with the son, it is the personal name that is omitted.



Gyula and the Gyulas
https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/66.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:24:53]
The question thus arises, what was Tétény's title, and what was the personal name of his harka son? Since Anonymus' more reliable information came from family traditions (e.g. the Zsombor and Agmánd clans), it is not likely that he made up the name Tétény or derived it from a contemporary toponym. No such place is found east of the Tisza. There is, on the other hand, a Tétény south of Buda, and another on the right bank of the Danube in Moson county; they lie on the periphery of a region, north of Lake Balaton, where there are toponymic traces of the later harkas Kál and Bulcsú, and there are also Harka toponyms dating from the Middle Ages, one to the west of Lake Fertő, the other near Szőny. Thus, if the toponymic legacy of Tétény and his harka son signifies that Tétény was a harka at the time of the Hungarian Conquest, then he can hardly have been (as Anonymus contends) the conqueror of Transylvania, for the toponyms Tétény and Harka do not occur in that region. By all indications, the harkas were charged with defending the western frontier, and set off from this area (as did Bulcsú) for their western European campaigns. At best, Tétény might have been the father of a chieftain who led the conquest of Transylvania. That chieftain must have been promoted from harka to gyula, for Transylvania was ruled by a gyula — through two generations {1-385.} according to Anonymus, or three according to the 'Old Gesta'. It may be supposed, on the basis of Anonymus' chronicle, that Transylvania's first gyula was a former harka who had moved there from Transdanubia along with his soldiers; as gyula, he became the leader of the Hungarian clans in Transylvania and assumed responsibility for the defence of the country's eastern frontier.
But was there a precedent for such a promotion in Hungary during the 10th century? According to a plausible hypothesis, after the kende Kurszán died in 904, the gyula Árpád became the ruling prince, and his title was passed on. The most likely recipient is no other but Tétény, who was named by Anonymus as the ancestor of a string of gyulas. This supposition is reinforced by the fact that Tétény, who — as noted — was probably once a harka, was given the land, on the right side of the Danube, where there are toponymic traces of Kurszán. At this point, the gyulas were not yet in charge of eastern defences; they were needed to lead the early raids into Italy and the German regions. After the death of Kurszán, the life of a ruling prince could hardly be put to risk in foreign raids. The campaigns came to be led by a gyula and a harka, who — as is known from the fate of the harka Bulcsú and of Lél — were accompanied by a prince of the house of Árpád.
In the eastern border regions, the Hungarian conquerors were compelled to mount a protracted defensive action. The blows suffered at the hands of the Pechenegs and Bulgars in 895 induced great caution. Constantine Porphyrogenetos repeatedly noted that the Turkic people (i.e. the Hungarians) feared the Pechenegs, who were used by the Bulgars to keep the Hungarians in check. When, early in the 10th century, Byzantine envoys urged the Hungarian leaders to attack the Pechenegs, their proposal was rejected on the grounds that it carried too many risks; in any case, the Hungarians had no intention of reoccupying the Etelköz, now held by the Pechenegs as far as the Danube delta. They tried to preserve peaceful {1-386.} relations with the Pechenegs so that they would be free to concentrate on more westerly targets. The Pechenegs, for their part, preferred to raid the richer lands of the Bulgars and Byzantines rather than the poorer Carpathian Basin, which was in a state of some turmoil due to the Hungarian conquest. Thus the anti-Hungarian alliance of the Bulgars and the Byzantine empire gradually fell apart, and the two old enemies, the Hungarians and the Pechenegs, pursued a rapprochement in the face of growing Bulgar might. Negotiations were conducted as early as 917 with the aim of launching joint Byzantine-HungarianPecheneg action against the Bulgars. In the short run, such action did not materialize, and Czar Simeon proceeded to conquer additional Byzantine territory, but in 932 the allies did launch a joint attack.
Al Masudi, a contemporary Arab geographer from Baghdad, noted in 932 (making reference to the Byzantine emperor Romanus Lecapenus, who reigned between 920 and 944) that four Turkic peoples, the 'bedjenei', the 'bedjenek', the 'badjgird', and the 'nu.k.r.da" (read: unkariya) had been fighting against each other when their undefended homes were attacked by the inhabitants of a 'Byzantine town' called W.l.n.d.r (read: Wlandur, from Lándor or Nándor, the Hungarians' name for the Bulgars). The four peoples thereupon joined forces and killed many of the people of 'Wlandur'. Although the Byzantine emperor led a great army to save the 'town', it was invested and sacked by the attackers, who took the inhabitants into captivity and proceeded to devastate the Byzantine Empire all the way to Constantinople. This account, which muddles up the names of peoples, 'towns', and countries, has inspired a variety of interpretations, but scholars now tend to conclude that it concerns only two 'Turkic' peoples, the Hungarians and the Pechenegs, who were attacking the Bulgars, a.k.a Lándors, at a time when the latter were getting support from Byzantium.
The Hungarians' occupation of southern Transylvania may well be linked to this event, if not to an earlier one. The



Gyula and the Gyulas
https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/66.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:24:53]
legend, {1-387.} related in the 'Old Gesta', of Gyula's hunting expedition and his discovery of the ruins of a Roman 'white castle' (Apulum), may well be based on the historical fact of a military campaign conducted in southern Transylvania. But who was the Gyula, or rather gyula, who led this campaign? The answer must satisfy three conditions: first, his name could not be Gyula or Harka/Horka, but he had to be a gyula or harka; second, he had to leave some toponymic traces in Transylvania; and third, he had to be dated from the early 900s in a reliable and preferably contemporary source. The only known personage who satisfies these conditions is the ruling prince Bogát (Bugat rex). It is recorded in Liudprand's Antapodosis that in 921, Bogát and his Hungarian troops joined Dursac rex in bringing aid to the Italian king Berengar against a group of plotters.
Hungarian historians agree that the western raids were led by the harka, who was accompanied by a prince of the house of Árpád; thus Bulcsú and Lél were present at the fateful battle of Augsburg. Since 'Dursac' has been plausibly identified with Tarhos, son of Árpád, Bogát is considered equally plausibly to have been a high dignitary of the tribal alliance. Some believe that Bogát was the gyula in that period, but it is more likely that he was the son of the gyula Tétény, and held the rank of harka — unless he had already inherited the title of gyula from his late father. In medieval documents, Bogát's name figures in numerous toponyms — three in Baranya county, two in Somogy county, and one in each of Vas, Zala, and Veszprém counties; and these places are found in the neighbourhood of villages bearing the names of Árpád, Árpád's relatives, and the harkas Kál and Bulcsú. He also appears in chapters 39, 41, and 53 of Anonymus' chronicle, where the subsequently famous harka Bulcsú — the 'man of blood' — calls Bogát his father. Although Anonymus did not know that Bulcsú was a harka and the son of the harka Kál, he nevertheless links Bogát, through Bulcsú, to the harkas; the chronicler may have drawn this vague connection from dying and misconstrued legends. Contemporary foreign {1-388.} sources, Hungarian legends, and toponyms all point to the existence of the harka (later gyula) Bogát, son of the harka (and later gyula) Tétény; judging from his places of residence, this Bogát may have been related to Árpád's family, perhaps as a son-in-law.
Moreover, medieval documents reveal that Bogát's name figures in another, eastern group of toponyms that, following Anonymus, can be linked to the gyula (Bogát) who was the son of Tétény (the harka), as well as to the other Transylvanian gyulas. Most of these place-names are found along the salt-route from Transylvania to the Tisza. In the period of the monarchy, the salt extracted in northern Transylvania at Désakna, Székakna, and Kolozsakna (perhaps along with some salt from Tordaakna) was transported across the Meszes Pass and Szalacs down to the Tisza, where it was loaded on ships. There is a place called Magyarbogát in the vicinity of Désakna; another Bogát, now defunct, was found in the 13th century south of Tordaakna, in the Aranyosszék district; there is a Nyírbogát northwest of Szalacs; and, finally, there are two fields called Bogát near the Tisza, at Mezőzombor and Polgár, but there is no assurance that these date from the Middle Ages. (The Oláhbogát in Fehér county must be excluded from this list, for it got its name in the late Middle Ages from the propertied Marosbogáti family; on the other hand, Oltbogát, as will be noted, has some bearing on the matter.) The eastern Bogát toponyms are invariably proximate to places bearing the name Zombor or Zsombor (which are linguistically indistinguishable): Magyarnagyzsombor at the Meszes Pass, and farther north, Zsombortelek, a settlement that had become deserted by the Middle Ages; Szászzsombor on the right bank of the Kis-Szamos, in the Mezőség; Mezőzombor on the left bank of the Tisza; and two Zsombors along the Olt River, northeast of Oltbogát. If Gyula had not been a common personal name in the Middle Ages, three additional Gyula toponyms from northern Transylvania and four from the middle reaches of the Maros could be linked to Anonymus' Gyula-Zombor legend; however, the only {1-389.} one of these toponyms that safely traced to the title of gyula is Gyulafehérvár. As noted, Anonymus probably drew from the Transylvanian, Zsombor clan's legend the information that the ancestor of the Transylvanian gyulas was the harka Bogát, son of the harka Tétény, and that Bogát's son was the gyula Zombor (considered by Anonymus to be two brothers, Gyula and Zombor). If this information is broadly accurate, it supports the hypothesis — one that has been advanced by others as well — that the first Transylvanian gyula was Bogát, who reached this second-highest rank in the tribal alliance when he moved from western Hungary to Transylvania. The promotion would have occurred shortly after 921, when the title of harka was assumed by Bulcsú's father, Kál.

The turmoil that prevailed at the turn of the century had consequences for the distribution of property. The huge estates acquired by the voivode László were subsequently confiscated by Charles Robert to punish the latter's sons for their rebellion. Both the king and the voivode rewarded their trusted supporters with land from the former royal estates. In the aftermath of the Mongol invasion, the beleaguered Church became the prime beneficiary of royal assistance; the king made new grants of land to expand the Church's depopulated estates. He enlarged the Transylvanian bishop's estate at Gyalu, in Kolozs county, and, for a time, even Kolozsvár was attached to it. The bishop's and canon's estates in Fehér county were also enlarged by donation, purchase, and exchange. Properties in Kolozs county and on the Küküllő River that belonged to the Benedictines' Kolozsmonostor monastery were initially reduced by crown grants, then enlarged to encompass forty-four villages; the estate along the Olt River of the Cistercian monastery at Kerc was also restored. The Church's estates remained proportionately smaller in Transylvania than in other parts of the country, and their expansion was far more modest than that of other private estates. Then again, there were only two institutional owners of large estates in Transylvania, the Church and the Crown. In practice, the Crown's estates were treated as if they {1-460.} belonged to whichever aristocrat from Hungary proper happened to be serving as voivode. Until 1370, the voivode remained master of all who toiled on the huge estates surrounding royal castles, and the beneficiary of the revenues they produced. In that year, King Louis the Great bestowed the Almás castle estates on the Bebek family. The disposal of royal-voivode estates was completed by King Sigismund, who bestowed a whole series of castle estates on one or the other voivode. Thus the Dezsőfi family, from Losonc, obtained Csicsó (1387) and Gogán(új)vár (1391), while the related Bánffy family got Bonchida (1387) and Sebesvár (1433). Bálványos was granted in 1406 to the Lackfi family, who later passed it on to the Losonci family. After 1409, when the king gave the Hunyad estate to Vajk, a knight and courtier of Romanian descent, royal donations grew scarcer. In later times, only Vajk's son, the famous military leader János Hunyadi, received major grants of land in Transylvania, including Léta castle and an estate at Beszterce. By the second half of the 15th century, the Transylvanian voivode's official lands had been reduced to the castle estates of Déva and Görgény. During Sigismund's reign, Transylvania was turned into a region of private estates; the last major beneficiaries were the Hunyadis and three branches of the Tomaj clan, the Losonci, Dezsőfi, and Bánffy families.
Following the Mongol invasion, the descendants of certain military heroes consolidated their position of eminence in Transylvania. This was the case with the Gerendi family, which traced its ancestry to one of the conquest-period clans, the Kalocsa-Tyukod, and the Dobokai family, who descended from the Kökényes-Radnót clan and had recently moved to Transylvania. The Gerendis were granted some villages from the former royal estate of Torda castle, while the Dobokais received lands around Torda and the castle they had acquired at Doboka. At the end of the 13th century, several Transdanubian families showed up in Transylvania, probably under the auspices of descendants of László {1-461.} Kán, who came from Baranya county: his sons Gyula and László (voivode from 1260 to 1267), as well as the latter's son László (voivode from 1275 to 1276) and grandson, also named László (voivode from 1295 to 1315). The Járai family, related to the famous Zichy family in Transdanubia, were granted the castle and estate at Jára, in Torda county; a branch of the Ákos clan received Torockó and its environs; Count Dénes Tomaj, an ancestor of the Losoncis, obtained the Lápos estate; and the ban Simon from the Szalók clan added estates along the Küküllő rivers to his holdings in Zala county. In the civil war, Simon shifted his allegiance from the voivode László to the king early enough to win a royal pardon, and thus his many descendants (including the Kendi family, which played a prominent role in the modern period) were allowed to keep their property.
Charles Robert's victory in Transylvania carried severe consequences for the aristocrats who had opposed him. Several powerful families, including some who had settled there during the conquest, had their property confiscated; the king eventually pardoned most of them (notably the Zsombor and Borsa clans), but only aristocrats of proven loyalty were allowed to play a leading role. The Kacsics clan's Tamás Szécsényi, who had subdued the Transylvanian rebels by force of arms, served as voivode until Charles Robert's death in 1342. His

services were rewarded with a generous share of the rebels' confiscated property. In 1319, he received the huge Teke estate, between Beszterce and the Maros River, and, in 1324, the Salgó castle estate in Szeben county. The authority and power that he exercised on behalf of, and with the approval of the king, were as great as those wielded by the voivode László, and he followed the latter's example in marrying a Piast princess, Anna of Auschwitz. Fully disposed to practice nepotism, Tamás brought along his cousins to Transylvania. One cousin, Simon, was granted the Nagysajó estate as well as the lucrative office of Székely count; his disloyalty led in 1327 to the confiscation of his property, part of {1-462.} which passed into the hands of the voivode Tamás. The latter's prestige helped another relative, Péter Cseh, to win the hand of the heiress to the immense riches of the Saxon geréb from Talmács, and to establish a family that bore the name Geréb of Vingárt; in the 15th century, descendants of this family became voivode and bishop, the highest offices in Transylvania. Another member of the Kacsics clan married a daughter of the Saxon geréb at Radna, founding a family that took its name from the estate at Kentelke. Péter Cseh's son, János, wed one of the daughters of Mihály Kelneki, a wealthy geréb; five of her six sisters also married Hungarian noblemen. Another Hungarian noble clan, the Barcsai family from Hunyad county, improved its fortunes by inheriting some of the property of Alvinci's Saxon geréb, who had no male heir. The reverse could also happen: the Saxon geréb Brassai family became linked by marriage to a branch of the Zsombor clan, and it acquired substantial estates when that branch ran out of male heirs.
The political crisis that erupted around 1300 left a lasting impact on Hungary's social structure. In the wake of the Mongol invasion, the royal county structure disintegrated, first in Western Hungary, then, by the end of the 13th century, in Transylvania as well. There arose, in its stead, a new social and administrative system in which the nascent nobility played an increasingly important role. The new owners of the royal estates that had been either given away or unlawfully appropriated during the civil conflict included the great propertied families, the royal officials who were freed from the counts' authority, and the castle warriors (várjobbágyok). In terms of legal rights and obligations, these groups came to form a single social stratum: all of them enjoyed a right to own property, owed allegiance directly to the king, and were eligible for military service. The county was no longer an organized unit of the kings' servants, but an administrative and judicial entity, whose crown-appointed counts had the obligation, as decreed by King Béla IV in {1-463.} 1265, to provide for law-enforcement. In each county, a college of noblemen (universitas nobilium) named the count's assistant magistrates. The latter participated in judicial proceedings in the county assembly (congregatio generalis) and assize courts (sedes judiciaria, or sedria), and they would also supervise, or themselves perform, the implementation of judgments and other rulings. These county officials, known as the szolgabíró (administrative magistrate, literally 'servant judge', in evocation of royal servitors; judices nobilium, abbreviated as judlium) were elected annually as representatives of the county's autonomous nobles, and so were eight to twelve jurors (iurati assessores).
Thus the fate of the county's inhabitants was essentially determined by the nobility, who were interposed between the central authority and the lower orders on their estates. The landless folk who laboured, under varying conditions, for landowners came under the legal authority of the latter. If they became embroiled in a lawsuit with another landowner's workers, or with a nobleman, it was their own landlord who presented the case in court. The king progressively transferred to the landowner the taxes paid by those who worked on the latter's estate, thus giving birth to a new class that was subordinated, in both legal and economic terms, to the landowning nobility. Only their right to migrate freely and change landlords was protected by law. In Transylvania as well as in other parts of Hungary, the term jobbágy (better rendered as 'villein', one bound to the lord, than as 'serf', one bound to the land) acquired a new meaning: it came to designate people who were under the legal authority of the landlord and owed the latter labour as well as contributions in money and kind. The villeins, like the nobles, came from diverse backgrounds. They included impoverished freemen as well as slaves who had been liberated by their masters. The institution of slavery (rabszolgaság) had ceased to exist in Hungary by the early 14th century. The last known Transylvanian charter providing for the emancipation of a slave dates from 1339.
{1-464.} Social relations in Transylvania evolved much as in the rest of Hungary, if at a slower pace due to the peripheral location of the region. Whereas in Hungary proper, the power of county nobility began to be felt even before the Mongol invasion, in Transylvania, the system of castle warriors (várjobbágyság) still flourished in the second half of the 13th century, when charters still bore references to serfs in (Belső-)Szolnok, Doboka, Kolozs, Torda, and Gyulafehérvár. In Transylvania, the major transformation of society occurred during the years of political crisis, which may explain why in that region the castle warriors did not merge with the nobility to the same extent as in western parts of the country. Late in winning its independence, this socioeconomic group was in

effect swept away. Most of the documents dealing with them involve the sale of their land; the purchasers were descendants of the original, settling clans (notably the Gerendi, Kecseti, and Szentmártoni families), other nobles of unknown origin, and the occasional churchmen. The fate of these castle warriors is not known. A few may have managed to keep sufficient property to sustain the lifestyle of a noble, but most of them must have been compelled to take service with wealthier noblemen or to seek their livelihood in the neighbourhood of the newly-founded royal fortresses. There is no evidence that any noble family living in Transylvania during the Middle Ages descended from castle warriors. To be sure, it is not possible to trace the origins — whether to first settlers or to later arrivals — of many of the noble families that emerged in the second half of the 13th or at the beginning of the 14th century. The more important families in this category include the Ősi Jankafi, Rődi Cseh, Frátai, and Csányi of Northern Transylvania; and, in the southern counties of Küküllő, Fehér, and Hunyad, all Hungarian noble families other than those known to be branches of families in other parts of Hungary, notably the Gyógyi, Gáldi, Béldi, Bagói Miske, Barcsai, Barincskai, Töreki Bakóc, and Rápolti. Their ancestors may have been members of clans in Transylvania or {1-465.} another Hungarian region, or, indeed, freemen who were in the service of the king.
Descendants of the clans that settled in the Szamos region at the time of the conquest continued to form the core of Transylvania's nobility. Although divided over time into many branches, the five clans still owned vast estates, and they played an important part in public life, mainly in Transylvania, but in some cases at the national level as well. Most of the families survived into the modern era. The main, Zsombori branch of the Zsombor clan died out in the early 1300s, though their name lived on through female descendants of a Saxon geréb family from the Barcaság that had become linked to the Zsombors by marriage. Two other branches generated descendants throughout the Middle Ages, one set bearing the names Esküllői Botos, Köblösi Teke, and Keresztúri Ördög, and the other Macskási, Szilvási, and Gyulai. The Agmánd clan's most notable branch was the Kecseti, and the wealthy Suki family may also have belonged to this clan. Other related families, which bore the names of their villages (Mórici, Hesdáti, Péterházi, Nyíresi, Szűkereki, and Kódori), did not play a role beyond the confines of their county. The Borsa clan's principal branch, consisting of the Iklódi Beke and the Majosi families, continued to flourish in medieval Transylvania; the other branch was represented by the Szentpáli family. In the Kalocsa clan, the principal, Szentmártoni branch died out in the mid-1300s, but the Kalocsa branch, named after a common ancestor, lived on in three distinguished and wealthy families bearing the name Gerendi, Detrei Urkundfi, and Figedi. The Mikola clan proved to be the most enduring. A member of its Kemény branch was Prince of Transylvania in the 17th century. As early as the Middle Ages the clan had split into two branches. The first gave rise to the Tamásfalvi Erdélyi, Szentmihálytelki Tompa, Bikali Vitéz, Farnasi Veres, and Valkai families; the second included the Kabos, Kemény, Radó, Mikola, Gyerő, and Gyerőfi families, who bore one of two nobiliary surnames, Gyerőmonostori and Gyerővásárhelyi.
{1-466.} In the Middle Ages, the core of the nobility in rural parts of Belső (Inner)-Szolnok, Doboka, Kolozs, and Torda counties was made up of descendants of the clans that had participated in the Conquest. They were differentiated only in terms of their wealth. In some cases, as the descendants multiplied, property had to be subdivided into very small estates. Thus several noble families might each have a manor (kúria) in the vicinity of the same village, where they would dispense with villeins and cultivate the land themselves; such 'kurial' villages included Magyarmacskás, Burjánosbuda, Kide, and Csomafája. Even less prolific families rarely owned more than ten villages. Only the wealthiest families might own as many as 20–30 villages, generally dispersed among the holdings of other families. On the periphery of this region of small and medium-sized estates, a few larger estates emerged that each consisted of a single block of 20–50 villages.
Due to the power of the provincial voivode, the nobility in Transylvania was emancipated more slowly than that in the rest of Hungary. At the beginning of the 14th century, Transylvania's nobles were still paying taxes to the king, or rather to the voivode. In 1324, to reward them for their aid in suppressing the Saxons' rebellion, Charles Robert abolished the tax. Only in 1342 did they acquire jurisdiction over the people on their estates, and thus become fully-empowered landowners. Their efforts to win autonomy for their counties were less successful. To be sure, by the early 1300s, nobles were electing the szolgabíró and other representatives to county courts even in Transylvania, and some counties would hold general assemblies. However, the voivode soon prevailed in his efforts at centralization and terminated the practice of county assemblies chaired by a count. Instead, the voivode would convene a joint assembly of the seven counties, normally at Torda, and this assembly appointed two administrative magistrates (szolgabíró) — and not four, like in the rest of the country — for each county. The voivode thus came to govern Transylvania's counties {1-467.} as if they were one great county, thereby delaying the

https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/78.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:25:04]
development of local self-government. On an individual basis, Transylvania's noblemen possessed all the rights that distinguished Hungarian nobles from commoners, but they did not constitute a social — feudal — order that could impose its will on the voivode. One obstacle was the social institution known as familiarity (familiaritás) a Hungarian version of vassalage that emerged in conjunction with the great estates, or latifundia.
Initially, poorer freemen would spontaneously enter the service of noble lords, mainly as the latter's armed escorts or estate managers. The nobleman would receive them into his extended family (hence the term 'familiarity') and commit himself to provide for their material needs and legal protection. The 'familiars', for their part, would take a pledge of loyal service. The greater a lord's wealth and power, the larger the number of nobles of lesser means who would enter his service. The latter were commonly rewarded with a fief, and if the lord was named to high office by the king, he would appoint his retainers to subordinate official posts. In Hungary's medieval administrative system, only the highest posts were filled directly by the king, and thus the retainers of great lords would come to play an important role in the middle and lower reaches of administration.
Accordingly, Transylvania's voivode would name one of his retainers as his permanent deputy; and this deputy voivode would also serve, ex officio, as the count of Fehér county and chairman of the voivode's 'octaval' court. By the 13th century, the Borsa founding clan had contributed two deputy voivodes, László and György Almási, and, as noted earlier, one of their relatives, Loránd, served as voivode. The counts, appointed directly by the king, came from the most prominent families, and chose their deputies from among their personal followers. Since the post was both lucrative and prestigious, even members of the wealthiest Transylvanian clans — Agmánd, Borsa, Kalocsa, Mikola — were eager to serve. Over time, {1-468.} a broad cross-section of Transylvania's lesser and middle nobility found itself in a 'familiar' relationship with one or the other voivode, and the latter's power was only strengthened by this social network. This may explain why even the wealthiest aristocratic families in Transylvania could not match the social prestige of the voivode. Although the voivode normally came from outside Transylvania and did not own significant property in the province, he filled the posts under his jurisdiction not only with retainers from his family estates, but also with locally-recruited 'familiars', thus securing the loyalty of much of Transylvania's nobility.
The institution of 'familiarity' offered a high degree of mobility to the nobility. A retainer who performed meritorious service for his lord would see his estates enlarged with new grants; and if he earned distinction as a soldier or functionary, his lord might well commend him to the king, whose favour could launch him on an independent career. It was, of course, the king's own retainers who had the best chance of rising to the highest levels. Some of them became more influential than members of the king's council who were aristocrats by birth or by wealth, and would rapidly join the ranks of the aristocracy. Even propertyless commoners could profit from familiarity if they impressed the lord with their talents. In the Middle Ages, Hungary's noble estate had not yet become a rigidly defined caste to which accession depended entirely on royal sanction. The main attribute of a nobleman was his freehold estate: nobility was synonymous with ownership (homo possessionatus). A landless man who obtained a freehold by royal or private grant, by marriage or by co-optation, automatically became a member of the nobility. Many retainers gained land and noble status through the benevolence of their lords. There were, to be sure, gradations in this social ascent. Often, the king, clergy, and private landowners would make a grant to their landless familiars — servants, personal attendants, soldiers, or estate managers — subject to certain conditions. The recipient would be bound to continue providing the same {1-469.} services as before, and upon his death, the property would revert to the landlord. Moreover, this conditionarius nobleman would remain under the legal authority of his lord, and not come under that of the county court. The recipient would enjoy the normal civil rights of nobles only if his lord exempted him from further personal service. The restrictions did not prevent a conditionarius from acquiring the nobility's lifestyle. With their lord's assent, they could sell, mortgage, or hand down their property; in this case, the new owner would have to accept the original terms of deed, which generally involved military service and a tax burden lower than that borne by feudal tenants. In the 14th century, Hungary's armed forces consisted largely of the private troops (banderia) of lay and ecclesiastical landowners. Charles Robert had reduced but could not fully eliminate the oligarchy's political power; he therefore compelled aristocrats to serve the national interest by raising troops in proportion to the size of their property. A retainer would join the royal army under the standard of his lord, while the free nobles served in the voivode's military units.
The feudal peasantry evolved necessarily in step with the nobility. In the medieval Hungarian state, the bearing of arms was the most important and highest degree of public service. Its material precondition was the soldier

nobleman's economic well-being, and this the king guaranteed by granting the nobles total legal and economic authority over the people on their estates. Only with the consent of the feudal nobility could the king impose a tax on villeins. An inheritance law, promulgated by King Louis I in 1351, confirmed the ancient customary law according to which a noble family retained full rights to its estate as long as there was an unbroken line of male descent from the original proprietor. Otherwise, the land reverted to the king, who generally would bestow it once again, frequently upon descendants of the female line. The lands of noblemen who were found guilty of disloyalty (high treason) also reverted to the king. In 14th century {1-470.} Transylvania, there was a sharp distinction between regions where the feudal order of nobles and villeins predominated, and those occupied by homogeneous communities of Székelys and Saxons. In the latter areas, the king did not exercise his right of escheatage, whether for disloyalty or because of the extinction of the male line; instead, the land in such cases reverted to the Székely or Saxon community. The feudal regions eventually were transformed into counties of the nobility, administered by counts appointed by the voivode: Belső-Szolnok, Doboka, Kolozs, Torda, Fehér (including its enclaves in Saxon and Székely territory), Küküllő, and Hunyad. To make the distinction clear, the administrative districts of the Saxons and Székelys came to be called széks (sedes = seats).
The king's purposeful policy of military defence was the motive force behind the great social transformation that gave rise to the social class of nobles. The maintenance of an effective armed force was the central and overriding concern of government, and thus the inspiration for all attempts by monarchs to mold society: those who were to bear the heavy burden of military service had to enjoy economic security and high social status. Accordingly, the measures taken in the last three centuries of the Middle Ages to assure the defence of the realm affected not only the noble estate of free Hungarians and emancipated castle warriors, but also the Székely, Saxon, and Romanian communities. Social elements that could contribute to defence were always the ones to benefit from the king's favour. The Hungarian soldier was imbued with the aura of a crusader, and since the qualities of soldier and noble became inseparable, the Székelys, Saxons, and Romanians were drawn by the prestige of noble status. To be sure, they were also attracted by the lifestyle, which encompassed considerable material and political advantages: freehold estates worked by unpaid villeins, exemption from taxes, and direct legal subjection to the king. The aspiration to nobility was a powerful factor in the development of Székely, Saxon, and Romanian society.

Education at Home and Abroad
The schools run by ecclesiastical chapters, monasteries, and mendicant orders concerned themselves with educating the next generation of priests and monks and preparing students for foreign study. To provide more education, schools were supposed to be established in every parish, but these materialized only slowly, first in the larger towns, then in smaller ones, and finally in villages. In the 14th century, such schools — supervised by the parish priest — were operating in Kolozsvár, Szeben, Brassó, and Beszterce. They must have attained a respectable standard; sources indicate that, by the late 1300s, Szeben had a library serving both parish and school, and that in 1442 it held 138 volumes. Some priests are known to have had private libraries, which no doubt also served educational purposes. In 1444, a scolasticus, seconded to the priest, served as the village teacher at Egeres, in Kolozs county, but this was more the exception than the rule in rural Transylvania. There was, in any case, little need for schools that prepared students for entrance to university, for only aristocrats and the wealthiest patricians could afford to attend the institutions in faraway Italy and France. When, in the mid-1300s, universities were established in East Central Europe, at Vienna, Cracow, Prague, and Pécs, the situation {1-544.} changed: it became possible for the sons of urban guildsmen and noble landowners to obtain a university education within reasonable distance, and at affordable cost.
Little is known about the medieval university at Pécs, for its archives, including rosters of students, were destroyed, and there is no way to find out how many Transylvanians studied there. More information is available about enrolment at Vienna and Cracow, and there is some fragmentary data concerning Prague. In the Middle Ages, over 90 percent Transylvania's itinerant students attended one or the other of these universities. The first to register at Vienna came in 1368, at Prague in 1369, and at Cracow in 1405. However, few Transylvanians attended the latter institution until 1409, when donors, apprehensive about Hussite influence, ceased to offer scholarships for study in Prague. Thereafter, and until 1526, there were few years when Cracow did not welcome some Transylvanian students. A similar continuity can be observed in their attendance of Vienna University.
A smaller number travelled to more distant universities. King Matthias was a devotee of the Renaissance, and this helped inspire students to go to Italy, where the most popular destinations were Bologna and Padua; those universities enrolled their first Transylvanians in 1464 and 1468, respectively, and new ones would arrive almost every year. Others, far fewer in number, would attend the universities at Rome, Naples, Ferrara, Perugia, and Siena. German universities became popular with Hungarians only during the Reformation; before the Battle of Mohács, only a few dozen Transylvanians are recorded as having studied in Leipzig, Heidelberg, Ingolstadt, and Cologne.
The records at hand show 2,026 Transylvanian students attending foreign universities in the period to 1520. They also reveal the places of origin of all but two hundred of these students. The larger numbers came from Szeben (285), Brassó (267), and Kolozsvár (122), and Segesvár (95); although the relevant data is {1-545.} unclear, another major town, Beszterce, can probably be added to this list. Medgyes, Szászsebes, Berethalom, Nagydisznód, Torda, Gyulafehérvár, Nagyenyed, Szentágota, and Dés — small towns with a Saxon, or mixed, Saxon and Hungarian population — each sent 26–50 students. Between 10 and 25 students came from Kereszténysziget, Szelindek, Beszterce (?), Muzsna, Prázsmár, Földvár, Kőhalom, Hermány, Segesd, Vidombák, Régen, Alvinc, and Marosvásárhely; with the exception of Marosvásárhely, whose inhabitants were all Hungarian (Székely), these even smaller towns were inhabited mainly by Saxons. Another sixty Transylvanian localities were represented by 2–10 students, and thirty-four — including some villages — by one student each.
A disproportionately high number of students came from the Szászföld, between the Olt and Nagy-Küküllő rivers, the Barcaság, and the Beszterce district. In fact, Saxons made up a majority of the Transylvanians who attended university abroad. This probably owed in part to the fact that the cities of Vienna, Prague, and Cracow offered a German-language environment, and were thus more congenial for Saxon than for Hungarian students. To be sure, mother tongue was not a factor at the universities, where the language of instruction was Latin. A more important

https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/91.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:25:15]
reason was the privileged legal status of the Saxon parishes. The deaneries of Szeben and Brassó, which encompassed thirty-seven parishes, came under the direct authority of the archbishop of Esztergom, bypassing Transylvania's bishop; these parishes enjoyed a high degree of autonomy in managing their finances and in administering ecclesiastical justice, which was an important source of revenue. The free towns, along with 250 parishes in the Szászföld, came under the bishop's jurisdiction, but they too were vested with archdeaconal authority, including the right to select their priests. Many of these localities would offer scholarships for study at foreign universities, and thereby end up with priests qualified to administer ecclesiastical justice; alternatively, the priests' emoluments {1-546.} allowed them to upgrade their educational qualifications abroad. The Hungarians' and Székelys' smaller towns and villages did not enjoy such advantages. They were tightly controlled and heavily taxed by the bishop, and lacked both the freedom to select their priests and the material means to send students abroad.
The geographical distribution of Hungarian and Székely university students was uneven. Most came from the KisSzamos valley, from Kalotaszeg (near Kolozsvár), from the villages in the Mezőség, on the right bank of the Szamos, from Alsórépa and Marosillye, along the Maros, and Csula to Alpestes in the Sztrigy valley. Székely students came mainly from the seats of Aranyos and Maros. In the more easterly seats, the towns of Kézdivásárhely, Gyergyószentmiklós, Nyujtód, Vargyas, Uzon each sent some students, but other towns, notably Sepsiszentgyörgy, Udvarhely, and Csíkszereda are absent from the list. Thus the Székelys' low level of education, which aroused comment as late as the Reformation, can be traced back to a lack of educational opportunities in the Middle Ages.
An analysis of the students' social background shows that the stratum of urban tradesmen was well-represented. This is evident from the large number of surnames denoting certain trades, e.g. Szabó (tailor), Kovács (smith), Varga (cobbler), Szűcs (furrier), Ötvös (goldsmith), Takács (weaver), and Mészáros (butcher); a few other trades are evoked in their Latin, German, or Hungarian forms. The list of students had always included aristocrats, prelates, and burghers. In the later 1400s, they began to be joined by members of Transylvania's Hungarian nobility. Some of the latter went on to distinguished careers, notably Péter Kecseti Agmánd, royal chancellor in 1445; Tamás Mérai and his nephew, Barnabás, both canons at Gyulafehérvár; and Máté Frátai Szentes, who was also a canon in that town at the turn of the century. Some students came from noble families that were of Romanian descent but had converted and become Magyarized, e.g. three members of the Osztró {1-547.} family of landowners, in Kolozs county, Márton Haczaki, the humanist and coadjutor of Várad, and a scion of the Csulai family, whose men more commonly chose a military career.
Most of Transylvanians who sought education abroad were drawn to legal studies, this being a qualification for employment in the church's notarial, 'responsible institutions' as well as for priestly duties in the more privileged parishes. The records show that of some two thousand students who came from Transylvania, nearly five hundred obtained Bachelor's or Master's degrees. Of the smaller number who obtained a Doctorate, four did so in Philosophy, five in Medicine, and five in Theology; but, in testimony to the prestige afforded by legal training, fully fifty-seven became Doctors of Law. These statistics, and particularly the predominance of law, confirm that despite the disproportionate number of Saxons, Transylvania's intellectual stratum, clerical and lay, was adapting to the cultural norms that prevailed in the rest of Hungary.

The Hunyadi Family
The Transylvanian 'nations' may have deceived and crushed the poorly-armed peasant rebels, but they lacked the strength to hold back the Ottoman onslaught. In 1438, an army of Ottomans, Romanians, and Serbs advanced through the Iron Gates into Hunyad county. This was no mere raid, but a diversionary manoeuvre by Sultan Murad II, whose objectives were Temesvár and Buda, and whose main force had been held up at the frontier by the Hungarian army. The invaders were accompanied by Wallachia's voivode, Vlad Dracul, a Knight of the Dragon and onetime vassal of King Sigismund. He persuaded Szászsebes to surrender, whereupon most of the townsfolk were driven off into slavery. Szeben survived an eight-day siege, but Gyulafehérvár and Küküllővár were invested and looted by the Ottomans. The latter rampaged for close to two months, then withdrew by way of the Barcaság, carrying off vast booty and thousands of captives. This invasion, and in particular the heroic resistance of the people of Szeben, was noted in contemporary Byzantine, Polish, and Austrian chronicles, and Transylvania would draw even more attention in the years to come.
{1-510.} As the Ottomans renewed their attacks along the southern frontier, it became clear that the goal was not simply consolidate their grip on the Balkans and intimidate the Hungarians, but to conquer Hungary. The Pole Wladislas I, who occupied the throne after the unexpected death of King Albert, made defence against the Ottomans his top priority. In 1441, right at the beginning of his reign, he proceeded to reorganize the country's defences and to consolidate the administration of the southern borderlands. His choice fell on the ban of Macsó, Miklós Újlaki, and the latter's old comrade-in-arms, the ban of Severin, János Hunyadi. They were given, in addition to their existing posts, the titles of counts of Temes and Székelys and voivodes of Transylvania. Újlaki was put in charge of defending the border zone's western half, and Hunyadi of the eastern half.
Transylvania had finally acquired effective leadership. After a long interval the fate of Transylvania had at last come into good hands. Hunyadi was a native Transylvanian and cared deeply for his homeland — unlike most of his predecessors, who resided in other parts of Hungary and who were too concerned with their estates and issues of national politics to pay much attention to Transylvania. Of humble birth, Hunyadi rose rapidly to become one of the outstanding figures in 15th-century Europe. Hunyadi's father, Vajk, probably issued from a family of boyars that had immigrated from Wallachia, had been a valiant but — according to contemporary sources — rather aggressive knight at the court, and his military services were rewarded in 1409 with a fine estate at Hunyad. János, who was rumoured at the time to be the illegitimate son of King Sigismund, spent the early years of his career as a noble retainer and soldier, serving successively György Csáky, the Székely count, Stephen Lazarević, the Serbian despot, and the ban of Macsó, whose brother, Miklós Újlaki, would also become ban and, later, Hunyadi's fellow voivode. Hunyadi, already known far and wide for prowess against the Ottomans, accompanied King {1-511.} Sigismund in 1431 to Italy, where he spent two years as captain of the mercenaries of Filippo Visconti, Prince of Milan. After his return to Hungary, he remained close to the king until the latter's death. The new king, Albert, put Hunyadi in charge of Severin Province, which was under constant attack from the Ottomans. Hunyadi earned much prestige, his voice carried weight in the selection of the next king, Wladislas I. He became the latter's trusted adviser and most highly-regarded soldier, and was put in charge of military operations against the Ottomans. The king recognized Hunyadi's merits by granting him estates in Eastern Hungary. In fact, Hunyadi became the greatest landowner in Hungarian history; in the end, his lands encompassed over two million acres, a quarter of which were located in Transylvania. Unlike most of his contemporaries, Hunyadi did not use his great revenues or the military and political weight of his thousands of retainers simply for his personal aggrandizement; for many years, he bore a large share of the cost of fighting the Ottomans.
Hunyadi's first defensive action took place in 1442, when a Turkish army led by Bey Mezid invaded Transylvania. The enemy prevailed in a battle near Szentimre, and Bishop György Lépes was killed in action, but a relief force led by Miklós Újlaki defeated the Ottomans — and killed Mezid — as they prepared to lay siege to Szeben. Hunyadi pursued the retreating Ottomans and even managed to drive them out of Wallachia. In 1443, he launched an offensive, and a series of military successes took him beyond the Balkan Mountains before bad weather

compelled him to withdraw. Hunyadi's next campaign, ended in defeat at the battle of Várna, where one of the casualties was King Wladislas. These offensives nevertheless served to keep the enemy well away from Hungary's borders.
Hunyadi became the hero of Western Christendom and the idol of Hungary's nobility. The successor to the throne, Ladislas V (1440–1457), was a minor, and Hunyadi was appointed Governor {1-512.} of Hungary. He was determined to use his new authority and power to eliminate the Turkish threat once and for all. To secure a base for his next campaign, he appointed his retainers to the posts of voivode in Wallachia and Moldavia and tried to rally the Balkan peoples into an anti-Ottoman alliance. However, Hunyadi's third Balkan campaign, in 1448, ended in defeat at the battle of Kosovopolje, in Serbia. This setback marked the end not only of Hungary's leading role in the Balkans, but also of the Serbs' fight for independence. Hunyadi's wider ambitions were thus frustrated, yet he continued to defend Hungary with notable success. When, in 1456, the conqueror of Constantinople, Sultan Mohammed II, laid siege to Nándorfehérvár (today's Belgrade), Hunyadi won a great victory over the Ottomans; in celebration, and to inspire Christians, the Pope ordered that church bells be rung at noon, a practice that endured into modern times. For decades, the Ottomans held back from attacking Hungary. Hunyadi was at the peak of his glory, but that same year he fell victim to the plague that swept through his military camp, and he was buried at Gyulafehérvár. Jealous of his power, rivals tried to relieve Hunyadi's sons of his estates and political legacy. László, his elder son, killed their principal adversary, Ulrich of Cilli, and paid for it by dying under the executioner's axe. However, the family's retainers and the lesser nobility took up arms in defence of Hunyadi's legacy, and in 1458 his younger son, Matthias was elected king.
Transylvania greeted the new monarch with some diffidence. When the three 'nations' met to confer in 1459, they renewed their union in a manner expressly directed against the king. The hostility was inspired not by the adolescent Matthias, but by his maternal uncle, Mihály Szilágyi, who governed in his stead and was noted for a violently aggressive manner. Szilágyi persuaded the king to grant him the family's most valuable estate, at Beszterce, and the barony that went with it. The late Hunyadi had obtained the property — carved out of a Saxon district — when he resigned the regency {1-513.} in 1453, and he had protected the rights and privileges of its inhabitants, but the new owner chose to treat the latter as common villeins. When, in 1458, the people revolted against his castellans' abuses, Szilágyi took Beszterce by force and wrought bloody revenge on his opponents. The Saxon nation felt at one with the people of Beszterce and was outraged by this action, which also alarmed the nobility and the Székelys. Fearing the spread of unrest, Matthias took over the reins of power from his uncle. In 1465, he restored Beszterce's free status, and he continued to bestow favours upon the Saxons, hoping no doubt that the latter would reciprocate in kind.
The hostility did not abate. The heavy expense of Matthias's military campaigns as well as the unaccustomed severity that he displayed towards the nobility led to the rise of opposition movements. In 1467, Transylvanian nobles, led by Benedek Farnasi Veres, took up arms against the king. They won the support of the voivode, János Szentgyörgyi, by hinting that they would like him to be the ruling prince of an independent Transylvania. Prominent Saxons and Székelys joined the rebellion. Matthias surprised the unprepared rebels with a quick and forceful intervention. The voivode was the first to beg the king for mercy, and some of the plotters sought refuge abroad. The punitive measures taken by Matthias were comparable to those following the fall of the voivode László, when Charles Robert seized the property of nobles. Rebels who bore such old and distinguished names as Farnasi Veres, Suki, Iklódi, Kecseti, Drági, Bogáti, Losonci Dezsőfi, Somkeréki Erdélyi, Dobokai, Illyei, and Folti became hunted outlaws. The king bestowed their properties on his relatives and faithful followers, notably the new voivode, János Dengelegi Pongrác, Miklós Csupor, and János Nádasdi Ungor. No doubt they would have generated a new Transylvanian aristocracy, but fate decreed otherwise, for all three family names became extinct within a few decades. After the first flush of anger, Matthias pardoned some of the rebels {1-514.} and restored their property, while the rest of these families' newly-acquired estates was divided up among descendants on the female line. The nobility was not alone in suffering the king's wrath. Saxon and Székely rebels were also punished; the mayor of Szeben was beheaded. Matthias personally led a punitive campaign against the voivode of Moldavia, Ştefan, who had been one of the instigators of the revolt. After being wounded in battle, the king withdrew his troops, but the voivode decided that discretion was the better part of valour and took an oath of allegiance; he was rewarded with fiefs at Csicsó and Küküllővár.
During Matthias's reign, which lasted from 1458 to 1490, there was only one major Turkish attack on

Transylvania. It was launched in 1479 by Bey Ali, an aggressive member of the same Mihaloglu clan that had been waging war along the Lower Danube for decades. While some Ottomans effected a diversionary thrust into the Barcaság, Ali and the bulk of his army thrust ahead through the valleys of the Lator and Sebes rivers and into the Szászsebes district. He took many prisoners, and his forward troops sacked Gyulafehérvár, but the main Turkish force was intercepted by the voivode Stephen Báthori at Kenyérmező, in Hunyad county. There followed, on 13 October, the bloodiest battle fought thus far in Transylvania against the Ottomans. Thanks to the timely arrival of the count of Temes, Pál Kinizsi, who was already renowned for his military feats, the Hungarians inflicted a stinging defeat on the Ottoman foe. For some ten years, the latter would forego making direct attacks on Transylvania. Defence against the Ottomans had become better organized. Between 1387 and 1438, Saxon towns had acquired an outer ring of fortifications, and many villages in Southern Transylvania turned their churches into redoubts, giving rise to a Gothic style of fortified church found only in Transylvania.
Under the reign of Matthias, Transylvania might have flourished much as under Anjou rule, had it not been for the unrest of commoners, who felt oppressed by the nobility and by Saxon and {1-515.} Székely notables. In the aftermath of the 1467 rebellion, Matthias was more discerning in his choice of voivodes. There was a marked increase after 1470 in the number of charters issued by the voivodes, one indication that the latter were taking their official responsibilities more seriously, and no longer regarded the office as merely titular and an opportunity for self-enrichment. However, during the period 1490–1526, when the Jagiellonians Wladislas II and Louis II occupied the throne, the country was beset by battles fomented by fractious oligarchs. The lesser nobility engaged in a bitter struggle in the diet with the aristocracy, and peasants revolted under the leadership of György Székely (Dózsa). Amidst these signs of social and political decay, the Ottomans renewed their attacks. In 1493, Transylvania was shaken by two more Turkish incursions as well as by social unrest among the Saxons and Székelys.

Writers and Literacy
Transylvania lacked the university that might have stimulated scholarly writing, and the strong demand for legal training worked at the expense of active theological debate. If a Transylvanian clergyman harboured ambitions to put his thoughts on parchment, he was likely to realize them in central Hungary, or abroad. Thus the archdeacon of Küküllő, János Apród, compiled his chronicle at the royal court; almost two centuries later, in 1523, the abbot of Kolozsmonostor, Márton Nagyszombati, penned his pamphlet against the Ottomans during a stay in Vienna. The earliest Transylvanian authors did their creative work, which was linked to their notarial duties, abroad. In the 14th century, the Franciscan János Erdélyi (Johannes de Septem Castris sive Transilvanus) penned his treatise on canon law during his stay in Italy, and the work is still preserved in Rome; Petrus de Dacia, who was a student in Cracow around 1381, earned fame abroad as a compiler of calendars. It was also abroad, in Florence, that a Dominican from Kolozsvár, Nicolaus de Mirabilibus, won renown in a debate — held in the presence of Lorenzo de Medici with a Franciscan on the subject of original sin; he returned in 1489 to Hungary, where he lectured at his order's college in Buda, drafted the school's charter, and eventually became the order's Hungarian provincial. These few examples indicate that Transylvania's intellectual clerics were in the mainstream of Roman Catholic culture and contributed, mainly abroad, to its enrichment.
Although Transylvania's clerics produced few original works, they were clearly literate men. Early codices produced at Kolozsmonostor and in the scriptorium of the Gyulafehérvár chapter {1-540.} were written in Carolingian script. Then, towards the end of the 12th century, priests and monks who had studied in Paris began to experiment with transitional forms of Gothic script. The drafting of charters, an activity encouraged by Transylvania's bishops, was initially done in Parisian-style, Gothic script, before this was supplanted in the course of the 13th century by Italian lettering. Later, beginning in the mid-1300s, the hundreds of Transylvanian students who attended university in Prague, Vienna, and Cracow, propagated these schools' Gothic cursive, which came to be adopted in Transylvania's schools. (There is no information on the presence of Transylvanians at Hungary's first university, at Pécs, or on this institution's contribution to literacy.) The writing of humanistic works began in the mid-1400s, among a small circle of prelates who had studied in Italy, and became more common only with the advent of the Reformation.
Initially, the manuscripts were written on domestically-produced parchment, the quality of which was progressively improved and reached international standards around 1400. By then, paper had largely replaced parchment, which would be used only for important charters and liturgical works. In Transylvania, paper came into general use a generation later than in the rest of Hungary. The earliest surviving document on paper issued by the voivode's office dates from 1345; by Kolozsmonostor, from 1348; and by the Gyulafehérvár chapter, from 1350. However, parchment was also in use until 1400; all the paper had to be imported until local production began in 1545. At first, the church's 'responsible institutions' were the main repositories of the art of writing, but over time the great majority of priests and monks achieved full literacy. The requirement that they be able to read dates from the beginning of the 14th century, and from 1389 they were expected to know how to write in Latin. By that time, the clergy had become so literate that the Diet of 1397 prohibited the appointment of foreigners to benefices of the Transylvanian church; and, by 1498, the competition {1-541.} was such that no one was allowed to hold more than one benefice.
The proliferation of intellectual clergymen led to a certain underemployment within the church, but it contributed to the spread of literacy among the laity. Churchmen who failed to obtain a benefice became scolastici and took on tasks in public administration at the national, county, or town level, initially as occasion clerks, and later as permanent officials. The most talented found employment at the voivode's chancellery. Since the voivodes were generally aristocratic landowners from Hungary proper, the routine of administrative and judicial tasks befell on the deputy voivode, who would be assisted by three or four clerks.
The voivode's chancellery was established relatively late, between 1415 and 1437, when Loránd Lépes (whose

brother, the bishop, played an important role in the Peasant Rebellion) was serving as deputy. The work of the chancellery was supervised by a prothonotary, whose office came to be identified more with the region than with the voivode: from 1442, he was referred to as partium Transsylvanarum prothonotarius. However, the prothonotary was not empowered to render judgment; that was reserved for officials appointed by the court. The functions were combined, at first in practice, then officially, during the administration of the voivodes István Báthori (1479–93) and Péter Szentgyörgyi (1499–1510), both of whom were also 'national' justices. Incumbents of the office of prothonotary included such prominent men as the chronicler János Thuróczi, Pál Magyi (who was concurrently deputy voivode), and István Werbőczy; the latter continued in office even after John Szapolyai, who was not a national judge, was appointed voivode. Beginning in 1503, if not earlier, the notaries in the chancellery were supervised by a secretary (secretarius). The first professional civil servant of noble origin, János Szucsáki, held the post of secretary under Szapolyai. Szucsáki had taken the job not as a temporary device to enlarge his estates but to {1-542.} make a career of it. He had worked as a clerk for the voivode, then did the same at Kolozsmonostor before returning to serve as secretary and de facto director of the voivode's chancellery. Two other secretaries, László Kecseti and Pál Barcsai, both began their careers in 1493, as clerks to the voivode. In 1519, the latter was promoted to the post of voivode's judge, an office now separated from that of national judge. With this step, the voivode's chancellery acquired its own hierarchical structure. Its officials, as is revealed by the above-cited names, came from the ranks of educated Transylvanian nobles.
One of the more noteworthy members of that growing group was István Rődi Cseh. He chose not to enter the public service, preferring to look after his estates, but he applied his literacy to the benefit of the county. In 1508, he drafted, in Hungarian, a letter of safe conduct for adoption by the county. A year earlier, he had written out his last will and testament in his mother tongue — Transylvania's earliest surviving document in the Hungarian language. Learning was a family tradition — one of his forebears served as canon in 1440 — and Cseh, after taking care of his older son, left most of the estate to his studious younger son: 'I bequeath my livestock, my grey cattle, [and] the rest of my possessions to Péter, so that he may study and not have to leave school.'[24]
Thus by the early 16th century, clerical and lay intellectuals could write not only in Latin but also in Hungarian or German. Literacy spread rapidly. János Hunyadi was still unlettered, but a century after his death, virtually all Transylvanian noblemen could read and write. The cultural evolution of the towns matched, and may even have outpaced that of the nobility. From the mid-1300s onwards, the larger towns had public notaries to do the work otherwise performed by the ecclesiastical 'responsible institutions'; sources mention the names of around a hundred of these notaries. Many were foreign-born and introduced to Transylvania the documentary practices prevailing in the more developed towns of the {1-543.} Germanic empire. They wrote in Latin, and always on parchment. In the 15th century, the patricians and many guild members became educated, and by the early 1500s only women and the plebs were still unlettered. Progress was slower in the villages, even in Saxon areas. In 1521, the judges and associate judges of Saxon villages in the Beszterce district asked the town to send them an auditor, explaining that they were 'unskilled in reckoning and writing'. Beginning around 1400, itinerant students would offer their writing skills to villages that lacked a parish priest and scolasticus teacher. It would take centuries before the rural population became literate.

WAR The Balance-sheet of War
Bocskai's Insurrection and the Rebirth of the Transylvanian State
While Transylvania agonized, the pointless bloodletting dragged on in Hungary. The imperial coffers in Prague stood empty, and few were willing to help with loans. Rudolph's government resorted to arresting the wealthiest Hungarian aristocrats, on {1-758.} fabricated charges, in order to confiscate their property and thereby raise money. The principal executor of this sordid stratagem was a man not unfamiliar with Transylvania, István Szuhay. The most famous of his victims was István Illésházy. Meanwhile, the official persecution of Protestants spread to Hungary, which, like Transylvania, suffered the depredations of mercenary soldiers and of the Ottomans. The public's trust in the Habsburgs was shaken not only in Transylvania but also, for the first time, in royal Hungary.
The arrogance of imperial officials and officers and the dissatisfaction and fear that suffused the feudal estates combined to make the situation explosive. The military governor of Upper Hungary, General Giacomo Barbiano, Count of Belgioioso, was informed by a turncoat that István Bocskai, who had withdrawn to private life years earlier, entertained contacts with Gábor Bethlen, the leader of the 'exiles' — a group of nobles from Transylvania and the Partium who had sought refuge with the Ottomans. In early October 1604, Barbiano personally led an operation to seize Bocskai. The aristocrat faced the alternatives of losing his possessions, or resisting. He chose to fight, and was favoured by a lucky circumstance: Barbiano's hajdú troops, men who were believed to fear neither God nor man and to be interested only in money and looting, were also Protestants, and the evidence of religious persecution turned them against the emperor. On the night of October 15, the hajdús, stationed near Álmosd, in Bihar county, revolted, and with Bocskai's help they routed the general's advance guard. Bocskai's forces numbered no more than 4,000, while Barbiano still disposed of some 8,000 soldiers, but after tarrying for a few days in nearby Várad, the Habsburg general ordered a withdrawal to Kassa. However, the town gates were shut in their face, whereupon most of Barbiano's soldiers deserted, leaving the general with a bare fifty men.
On 11 November, Bocskai and his hajdú force made ceremonial entry into Kassa. They were greeted by Gábor Bethlen, who {1-759.} had arrived a few days earlier bearing a sword of honour from Ahmed I as well as the sultan's decree naming Bocskai Prince of Transylvania. The first Turkish-Tartar reinforcements arrived soon afterwards.
Giorgio Basta, who had become imperial governor for the whole of Hungary, cut short his military operations against the Ottomans in the Esztergom district and moved against the insurgents. His force prevailed in the battles at Osgyán and Edelény but failed to take Kassa, and in mid-December he was compelled to order a withdrawal. The garrisons of all fortresses in the region east of the Tisza except Nagyvárad turned against the emperor and rallied to Bocskai.
Between April and June 1605, the highly mobile hajdú regiments — aided by Turkish and Tartar cavalry overran most of royal Hungary. Led by Illésházy, many Hungarian aristocrats and nobles joined Bocskai with some enthusiasm; the others were driven by necessity to submit to him. Even Transdanubia was swept clear of German and Italian mercenaries. By the end of June, the front-line units of Gergely Némethy had laid siege to Sopron, but they withdrew at the approach of a large imperial army. After a short respite, the Hungarians returned to the attack. Némethy fought and won a battle on September 27–28 near Szombathely, then sent raiders into Austrian provinces and as far as the outskirts of Vienna. By this time, Bocskai disposed of more than 40,000 soldiers.
The imperial court was acutely short of cash; its last sources of credit, two Bohemian banks, had just declared bankruptcy. With great difficulty, it assembled its forces and, in late November, launched a counter-offensive that proved comparatively successful. Led by Count Tilly (who would earn fame, or rather notoriety in the Thirty Years' War), the imperial army reoccupied the western, non-Turkish part of Transdanubia.
Earlier, on 20 April 1605, a diet convened at Szerencs had acclaimed István Bocskai ruling prince of Hungary. Euphoria {1-760.} reigned, and Bocskai's hopes and expectations were great: perhaps he could realize Stephen Báthori's dream and, without any Habsburg involvement, reunite Transylvania with the rest of Hungary.



Bocskai's Insurrection and the Rebirth of the Transylvanian State
https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/119.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:25:47]
Bocskai's envoys in Istanbul were instructed to request that the sultan recognize him not simply as prince, but as 'King of Hungary'. Breaking with a policy that had been in effect since 1540, the Ottoman ruler assented. The glittering crown that he sent to Hungary was presented to Bocskai on 11 November 1605 by no less than the Grand Vizier, Lalla Mehmed.
The Turkish potentates were probably unaware that before setting off for this ceremonial encounter, Bocskai had taken the precaution of naming an heir to his title in the person of the seventeen-year old Gábor Báthori, telling his chief commander, Bálint Homonnai: 'If something happens to me while I am with the Ottomans, please draw the right conclusion and never again trust the Turkish people!'[16] A similar scenario had been played out on three occasions during the fifty-year span of the Transylvanian principality, in 1529, 1532, and 1566. Bocskai enjoyed widespread renown as a former slayer of Ottomans, and perhaps he had more to fear than his predecessors.
The Habsburgs were still capable to defending their interests in Hungary, for by the autumn of 1605, the hajdú army had been driven out of the western counties. The Hungarians did not possess sufficient resources to tip the equilibrium between the two great powers that were vying for control of their country. Thus the situation that had prevailed since 1526 was essentially unaltered, and common sense dictated that the hopeless struggle be brought to an end as soon as possible.
The Ottomans' latest actions induced Bocskai to caution. The pashas had used the alliance as an excuse to recapture Esztergom and Visegrád, then proceeded to keep the two towns in the sultan's domain. The grand vizier also had designs on Érsekújvár. This important fortress was saved thanks only to the Archduke Matthias, {1-761.} who was exercising wide discretion in Hungarian affairs: he ordered the garrison to surrender to the besieging Hungarians before the Ottomans arrived.
The combined effect of all these factors was that within a few months, the prince abandoned his dream of restoring the Kingdom of Hungary and devoted his energies to ending the 'long war'. To this end, he first had to clarify his international status. If he took the title of King of Hungary, he would fatally antagonize the Habsburgs. Instead, he set aside the crown presented to him by the Ottomans and concentrated on gaining control of the whole of Transylvania.
At first, the efforts the Turkish-appointed 'prince of Transylvania' and of the exiles aroused little interest in the province. Memories of the recent past were too fresh in people's minds, and their yearning for peace too strong to let them fathom the full import of Bocskai's latest plan. The prince himself had little direct involvement in Transylvania. His immediate entourage consisted mainly of hajdú captains (Balázs Lippai, Balázs Némethy), Hungarian aristocrats (Homonnai, Illésházy, Ferenc Mágócsi), and popular Hungarian officers (Miklós Segnyey, and Mihály Káthay, formerly the imperial captain of Kálló castle, whom Bocskai named chancellor). Apart from Gábor Bethlen, only two of his close associates were familiar with Transylvania, and neither was a native of the province: Ferenc Rhédey, an officer active in Upper Hungary, and the Sabbatarian Simon Péchi, who became Bocskai's secretary.
Thus the three 'nations' had some cause to be suspicious of Zsigmond Báthori's onetime confidant, Bocskai. In Transylvania, only a few disillusioned hajdú officers and Hungarian aristocrats had joined his insurrection prior to the end of 1604. There was little to stop the province's imperial commissioners from launching an attack on Bocskai's rear, in the region east of the Tisza; they disposed of a regular force of 5,000 soldiers and could readily mobilize some 20,000–25,000 Székelys. Instead, they remained inactive {1-762.} as the garrisons of Jenő, Lugos, and Karánsebes surrendered in quick succession to officers of the 'insurgent' Bocskai. The latter well understood where the key to the Transylvanian problem lay: he advised the Székelys that they could retain their liberties if they stayed neutral in the struggle.
The insurgents took their first military initiative in the east in January 1605. László Gyulaffy, who had been appointed by Bocskai captain-general for Transylvania, laid siege with 4,000 men to the well-fortified town of Szatmár, and invested it on 21 January. That success opened a gate to historic Transylvania.
At a national assembly in February at Keresztúr, the Székelys rallied with unexpected enthusiasm to Bocskai's side. That latter did not tarry: on February 16, he issued a formal statement confirming their 'ancien freedoms'. Five days later, Hungarians and Székelys jointly acclaimed their new prince. However, the Saxons, backed by a

few nobles and imperial garrisons, prepared to resist. They were led by an elderly notable, Albert Huet, and, on the military side, by György Rácz, an outstanding lieutenant who had risen from the ranks. The Saxons' cause seemed hopeless after the Székelys' change of camp, but they were encouraged by the fact that Gyulaffy had come to Gyulafehérvár with a small force of a thousand cavalry and was trying to win support for Bocskai by relying on local resources. On 18 May 1605, Rácz launched a surprise attack on Székely and Hungarian troops as they gathered at Ebesfalva and managed to rout them.
Bocskai now sprang into action. Skirting Várad, which was still in imperial hands, he headed with a thousand mounted soldiers to Medgyes. At the same time, he directed Gábor Bethlen and his small force of 'exiles' to move into the Maros valley and called the Székelys and Transylvanian nobles to arms. And, at Bocskai's invitation, Moldavian and Turkish troops penetrated the Barcaság.
György Rácz fought another battle, on June 14, but his luck had run out. Realizing the hopelessness of their cause, the Saxons submitted to Bocskai, who made a ceremonial entry to Medgyes on {1-763.} August 27. The troops that remained loyal to the emperor fled to Segesvár, where, on September 9, they took up an offer of safe passage and surrendered. With that, the 'Fifteen Years' War' in Transylvania came to an end.
On 14 September, at Medgyes, a diet representing the three 'nations' unanimously acclaimed Bocskai Prince of Transylvania. The much-tormented province was finally at peace, and, amidst the rejoicing, people managed to forget their internal quarrels. The new ruler inspired widespread enthusiasm. To govern Transylvania, he chose an elderly and widely-respected aristocrat from the Partium, Zsigmond Rákóczi. Soon after the conclusion of the diet, Bocskai hastened back to Hungary to pursue his most important goal: peace in his homeland.
Negotiations with the Habsburg court made slow progress. Some of Bocskai's followers would not hear of any compromise; the nobles in the Tisza region and the Partium were particularly adamant that Bocskai must not give Hungary back to the emperor. They could count on the support of the large number of hajdú soldiers, who were only interested in war and pillage. The lack of discipline of his troops worried the prince, for it reflected badly on him. He had already resorted to forceful methods, including the execution of several hajdú officers, but only a peaceful solution could eliminate the problem. On 12 December, 1605, Bocskai granted the hajdú infantrymen 'collective nobility' (on the Székely model) and settled them on the land; a similar decree, issued on 2 September 1606, took care of the hajdú mounted troops. They were granted sites for seven villages in an uninhabited district near Debrecen.
The Habsburgs made repeated, but ultimately unsuccessful attempts to have Bocskai assassinated. Their financial straits and the ongoing hajdú raids into Austria demanded a quick resolution of the Hungarian problem. Without consulting the emperor, Archduke Matthias agreed to Bocskai's terms, and a peace treaty was signed in Vienna on 23 June 1606. The treaty restored the {1-764.} Principality of Transylvania, and the borders of the Partium were shifted westward to encompass the counties of Szatmár, Szabolcs, Ugocsa, and Bereg, as well as Tokaj castle. With respect to royal Hungary, the Habsburgs agreed to reinstate freedom of worship and to appoint only Hungarians to high state office.
There remained the problem of war with the Ottomans. Exhausted by a succession of revolts and yet another Persian campaign, the Sublime Porte was disposed to compromise. Thanks to Bocskai's mediation, the Habsburg court also reconciled itself to the status quo. It was agreed that the line of demarcation should coincide with the military front lines; the Ottomans thus gained some territory around Kanizsa and Eger, as did the Christian side in Nógrád county and along the Maros River. The peace treaty was signed on 15 November 1606, at Zsitvatorok.

Following the triumphal parade in Rome, the head of the Dacian king Decebalus was put on public display on the Gemonia steps, and celebratory games were staged in the Colosseum; commemorative coins were struck bearing the words DACIA CAPTA. The former kingdom's territory was occupied by Roman troops. Most of the Dacian royal treasure has been buried in the bed of a brook called Sargetia (Sztrigy), but a Dacian nobleman, Bikilis, betrayed the secret to the Romans. Part of loot was distributed among Trajan's commanders and soldiers, and Roman citizens; another part paid for the cost of the games, which lasted for 123 days, and for gilding the statues at Rome's new forum. Yet another, substantial part of the treasure was donated by the grateful emperor to the shrine of Jupiter Casios at Pelusion, in Asia Minor. Even so, the Romans did not get all of the Dacian kings' treasure, for in the mid-1500s, some 40,000 Lysimacian gold pieces (weighing 340 kg) were discovered in the bed of the Sztrigy brook, near the onetime Dacian capital; the find came into the ownership of György Fráter, and then of Giovanni Castaldo.
The Dacian campaigns were the first occasion when Roman armies crossed the empire's fortified frontier (which stretched from the North Sea to the Black Sea) with the objective of annihilating an enemy and permanently occupying its territory. The plan entailed turning the Dacian lands into a Roman province, but subsequently there would be much debate over the necessity of preserving this status.
{1-62.} The organization of the province proceeded at a rapid pace under its first governor, D. Terentius Scaurianus, legatus Augusti pro praetore. Coins, minted in 112, and bearing the inscription DACIA AUGUSTI PROVINCIA, indicate that the task was completed while he was in office. The early, key measures taken by Scaurianus included a population census, a land survey, the marking of frontiers, the organization of military defences, and the construction of a secure road network to link the military camps.
By the beginning of the 2nd century, the empire's European provinces had a limes, a fortified boundary. Legions and auxiliary units were deployed along fluvial borders (the Rhine and the Danube); elsewhere, such as in Raetia and southern Germania, arrow-straight, defensive earthworks were constructed, even over hilly terrain. But Dacia's mountains and rivers generally did not facilitate either method. It took some ten years before an adequate defensive line of military camps was completed across the mountains, passes, and rivers. The camps on the province's perimeter also marked the limits of the empire. Their location was affected by foreign policy considerations, i.e., defence against possible attack from the new province's neighbours. These included independent Dacians tribes, Sarmatian Jazyges to the west, and Sarmatian Roxolani to the east. More archaeological investigation is required to uncover the early history of the fortified line, particularly in the eastern Banat, Oltenia, and Wallachia. After the Dacian wars, some of the land north of the Danube — eastern Oltenia, Wallachia, perhaps even south Moldavia was under the supervision of the Romans' Lower Moesian army, and not their Dacian army. Thus, for example, the area (later part of Dacia) that stretched from Turnu Severin to the Olt and the southern flank of the Carpathians was garrisoned by the Lower Moesian army in the period between the end of the war and the final administrative delineation (118 A.D.). Contrary to the earlier assumption that the Banat was supervised by the Upper Moesian army, it is now known that until 118–119, a {1-63.} Dacian legion, IIII Flavia, was stationed at Bersovia (Zsidovin, Berzovia), which means that in the early years of the province, eastern Banat was under the supervision of the Dacian army. The other legion in the occupying army was the XIII Gemina. Since we know that at a later date it was stationed at Apulum (Gyulafehérvár, Alba Iulia), it is likely this 6,000-strong legion, the core of the province's defence force, was based from the start at that central Transylvanian location. A future excavation at its castrum may reveal some details of this legion's early history.
Thus in the early years of the province of Dacia, at least two legions were stationed there. This meant, in Roman practice, that the governor of Dacia was nominated from among the senators who had previously served in the highest public office, that of consul.

Apart from the legions, the military protectors of the province included a large number of auxiliary units, each of them normally numbering 500 or 1000 armed men. At first, the camps' perimeter defences consisted — as in other provinces — of earthworks and palisades. The defensive structure was completed by the 120s. The construction of the camps and of the connecting roads proceeded simultaneously. The army began to build roads as soon as the province's organization got under way, for the easy movement of reinforcements was particularly important in a territory that reached deep into the Barbaricum. In northern Transylvania, the road between Potaissa (Torda, Turda) and Napoca (Kolozsvár, Cluj-Napoca) was completed by 109–110 A.D., according to the epigraph on a milestone unearthed at Ajtony (Aiton). Communication with the more central part of the empire was assured by the stone bridge at Drobeta (Turnu-Severin), erected in the interval between the two campaigns, and, farther west, by a pontoon bridge at Lederata (Palanka).
Veterans of the Dacian wars were settled by Trajan in the province's principal town, Colonia Dacica (the former Sarmizegethusa). In order to repopulate the region, Trajan — in the {1-64.} words of Eutropius, a historian in late Antiquity — moved large numbers of people from all corners of the empire into Dacia. The resettlement is evoked by a coin minted at the time of the province's official foundation: the obverse bears a female figure, personifying Dacia, holding children on her lap.
The province of Dacia was barely established when, in 107–108, war broke out on its western border. All that is known is that the governor of Lower Pannonia (and future emperor), Hadrian, waged war on the Sarmatian Jazyges (located between the Danube and the Tisza and east of the Tisza), even though they had been allied with the Romans during the Dacian wars.[19] The Sarmatians' unrest may well been provoked by the fact that 'even Trajan would not return to them' a territory, the eastern Banat, which had been occupied by Decebalus between the two Dacian campaigns' wars.[20] It is possible that there was a further source of tensions: the creation of a Dacian province meant that the Jazyges, who were spreading out east of the Tisza, found themselves surrounded by the empire, in the east as well the south and the west. An altar, found at Versec (Vrsac, Yugoslavia), indicates that units from western Dacia also fought in the war; raised in 106–108 by the II Hispanorum cohort, it is dedicated to Trajan and bears an epigraph to Mars U(ltor) or V(ictor).[21]
There followed a peaceful period during which the province seemed secure. Soldiers who had completed their service in Dacian auxiliary units were demobilized in 110; although the governor appointed in 112 was once again a career soldier, Trajan's friend C. Avidius Nigrinus, two years later detachments of the Dacian army were commandeered for the Parthian War. The peace was of short duration. In the wake of Trajan's death in 117, the Dacian region became the stage for the first great test of strength between the empire and the neighbouring peoples. Two tribes of the Sarmatians, the Jazyges and the Roxolani, attacked Upper and Lower Moesia, and the war spilled over into Dacia. The death of Quadratus Bassus, {1-65.} a veteran of the Dacian wars who had just been appointed governor of Dacia, added to the Romans' difficulties. The causes of war included the Roxolani's resentment at a reduction in Roman financial aid, the Jazyges' territorial claims, and the fact that the new province separated the two related tribes' territories on the Lower Danube. Hadrian visited Moesia and Dacia; in the latter province, 'fearing that the Barbarians, who had captured the defences of the bridge [at Drobeta] with little effort, would manage to cross into Moesia, he ordered that the superstructure of the bridge be torn down'.[22] The Jazyges were dealt with more severely. Hadrian took the unusual step of putting a mere knight, the excellent soldier Q. Marcius Turbo, in charge of both Lower Pannonia and Dacia; a coordinated attack from two directions crushed the Jazyges. It was during Turbo's and his successor's governorship that the organization of the province was completed. When, in 119, Turbo was named praefectus praetorio and left Dacia, the inhabitants of Sarmizegethusa honoured him with an epigraph expressing their gratitude.[23]
The Sarmatian War of 116–118 showed that Dacia contributed little to the security of provinces south of the Danube. The new province could not prevent attacks on the empire by Jazyges from the west, through the Banat, and by the Roxolani from the east, across Wallachia. On the Oltenian Plain, which favoured the attackers' cavalry, the two tribes could execute a pincer movement and cut off the province's Transylvanian territory; and, by way of the bridge at Drobeta, they could also threaten Moesia. The elimination of Decebalus rid the Romans of the danger presented by a unified Dacian realm, but it also deprived them of a useful buffer against the Sarmatian tribes. The latter had gained strength, and threatened not only the empire's frontier along the Danube in Upper and Lower Moesia, but also the Dacian province's borders with Oltenia and the Banat, where there were no natural defences. Since the Sarmatians relied on mounted warfare, the province's mountain {1-66.} regions were less vulnerable; but if

Jazyges and Roxolani allied themselves with the tribes of free Dacians, Celts, and Germans in the north, a concentrated attack might be launched along the entire length of the lower Danubian fortified frontier and Dacia's frontiers against the empire and the province. By incorporating Dacia, the empire had greatly extended its frontiers, and it needed greater vigilance as well as more troops to defend the latter than had been required for the shorter, Danube frontier. Perhaps this is why Hadrian, whose strategic outlook was primarily defensive, considered the option of relinquishing Dacia at the beginning of his reign.[24] Such a move would have been a realistic strategy, and, in fact, Hadrian had readily surrendered other territories that had been won by his predecessor at great military cost: he 'evacuated areas beyond the Tigris and Euphrates'.[25] In the end, moved by Turbo's success or the advice of friends, he changed his mind about giving up Dacia and, instead, reorganized the province's defences. In order to consolidate the Danubian limes against the Sarmatians, the IIII Flavia legion was transferred back from the Banat to its earlier, more easily defended base behind the Danube at Singidunum (Belgrade).
In sum, it appears that the role played by Dacia in the defence of the empire and Italia was not as great as claimed by some historians. The province jutted into Barbaricum, and its geographical situation did not allow the local Roman forces to forestall attacks against the empire's possessions south of the Danube. Beyond the defence of the province, these forces could only join in retaliatory action after the attacks had occurred. Instead of being assigned independent operations, the Dacian army was put to effective use only as a reinforcement for other provincial forces. At the time of the wars against the Marcomanni, in the late 2nd century, the Dacian army could not even defend its own province; it had to be reinforced with an additional legion, which then remained in Dacia.
{1-67.} In its peripheral provinces, Rome took pains to establish defensive lines that would clearly indicate to the peoples of Barbaricum the border of the empire, and which would facilitate terrestrial or fluvial communication between the fortified posts. It may seem anomalous, then, that Rome did not to stand on its shorter and more defensible, Danubian frontier, but maintained a province with long, vulnerable, borders, along many parts of which communication was difficult between the fortified posts; the defence of Dacia was far more costly than that of other provinces. On the other hand, once the decision was taken at the end of the Dacian Wars to establish a province, considerations of prestige came into play and militated against a subsequent withdrawal — as did, presumably, Transylvania's gold deposits, particularly in the early years.

The Division of Dacia into Provinces: Borders and Military Organization
The structure that was put in place by Marcius Turbo and probably further developed by his successor, Iulius Severus (120–126), affected the province's borders and military organization and had an impact on the neighbouring Barbarian territories, the Banat, Oltenia, and Wallachia. Although recent archaeological finds have thrown some light on this process, many details — intra-provincial boundaries, the procurators' sphere of authority, and whether the fortified posts along the left bank of the Danube were subordinated to Dacia or to Moesia remain the subjects of debate. It must have been, at the latest, in this period that units of the Lower Moesian army's units were withdrawn from Wallachia; thus, some of the land occupied during the Dacian Wars was relinquished. A region west of the Olt River was constituted into a new province called Dacia Inferior (Lower Dacia). The province was governed by a procurator of knightly rank, for no legion was stationed there, and {1-68.} enjoyed a certain autonomy in internal affairs. It was bounded in the southwest by the Danube, in the northwest by Dacia Superior, and by a line running from Dierna (Orsova) to the southeast Carpathians. Its eastern border may have followed either the line of camps along the Olt, or a fortified line, some 25–35 kilometres farther east, running roughly parallel to the Olt, and called the Limes Transalutanus.
Prior to the division, the remainder of Dacia — with the exception of the northern part — was renamed Dacia Superior (Upper Dacia). It encompassed central Transylvania and the eastern Banat all the way to the eastern Carpathians. The transfer of the legion IIII Flavia to Moesia Superior left only one legion in Dacia Superior, the XIII Gemina, stationed at Apulum. The province's governor also commanded the legion. Since, according to the prescriptions of Roman administration, former consuls could only rule provinces with more than one legion, Dacia Superior was in subsequent decades administered by officials of the next lower rank, i.e. senators, who became consuls only at the end of their terms as governor.
Another new province was carved out in the northern part of Dacia, which corresponds to northern Transylvania, and named Dacia Porolissensis after the important military camp at Porolissum (Mojgrád); this may have been done at the time of the 118 reorganization, and certainly before 124. As in Dacia Inferior, no legion was stationed in the province, and thus administration was entrusted to a procurator of knightly rank. In military matters, the governor of Dacia Superior had supervisory responsibilities over Dacia Inferior and Dacia Porolissensis. Dacia was thus divided into three parts.
After the first 10–15 years of military occupation, a more or less definitive structure of defence and administration had emerged. Rome withdrew its troops from regions of lesser importance. The three Dacian provinces' borders to the north, east, and west were {1-69.} part of the empire's defensive perimeter. The line was drawn to according to topographic features as well as in anticipation of the provenance of enemy action, and it influenced, in turn, the enemy's strategies.
In the mountains and valleys of Dacia Porolissensis, a line of military camps, which were at times located in close proximity to one another, protected the province against raids from the north by free Dacian and Dacianized Celtic tribes (Anartii, and later by German tribes (Buri). period. In the west, the border ran north from the Aranyos valley along the Bihari, Gyalu, and Vigyázó mountains; no trace has surfaced of the camps in this region. Farther north, the valleys of the Sebes-Körös and the Szamos were guarded by camps at Gyalu (Gilău) and Sebesváralja (Bologa). The northern frontier, where narrow valleys offered a natural access for attackers, was guarded by the long ridge of the Meszes Mountain and an unusually close-set line of camps (Vármező-Buciumi, MagyaregregyRomânaş, Romlott-Romita, and Porolissum's two camps, on the heights of Pomet and Csitera). The Cikó pass was defended by a camp at Tihó (Tihău). Between and in front of the camps, a dense network of watchtowers overlooked the frontier. Farther east, the frontier followed the inner range of the Haragos, Ilosva and Lápos mountains, with camps at Alsókosály (Căşeiu = Samum?) and Alsóilosva (Ilişua), veered southwards along the Borgó and Kelemen Alps, and finally ran along the inner, western range of the eastern Carpathians (Alpes Bastarnicae: Tabula Peutingeriana). Camps were established at Jád (Iad-Livezile) and Óvárhely (Orheiul

Bistriţei), on the southwestern slopes, as well in the Maros valley at Marosvécs (Brîncoveneşti); the latter was Dacia Porolissensis' southernmost camp on the eastern frontier.
In the plains of the Banat, the principal threat to Dacia Superior came from Sarmatian Jazyges, and the only known border fortifications were in that southern region. To the west, a forward line of camps was constructed, along the road from the Lederata (Palanka) {1-70.} pontoon bridge to Tibiscum (Zsuppa, Jupa), at Gerebenc (Grebenac), Arcidava (Varadia), Versec (Vršac, Yugoslavia), Centum Putei (Szurduk, Surduc), Bersovia (Zsidovin, Berzovia) and Aizis (Furluk, Fîrliug). There were fortified camps along another road, running from Dierna, just to the west of the Drobeta bridge, to Tibiscum, at Pretorium (Mehadia), Ad Pannonios (Teregova), and Agnaviae (Závoly, Zăvoi). Northward, towards the Maros valley, there were no camps, for the Ruszka Alps provided a defensive shield. The Maros valley itself was protected by military camps at Micia (Vecel, Veţel), Felsővárosvíz (Orăştioara de Sus), Bucsum (Bucium), and Csigmó (Cigmău), as well as by the camp of the Dacia Superior legion at Apulum, in the central part of the province. The frontier north of the Maros valley was marked by the Érc and Bihari mountains.
The north-eastern frontier of Dacia Superior ran along the westernmost ranges of the eastern Carpathians, including the Görgényi Alps and the Hargita mountains, and had camps at Mikháza (Călugăreni), Sóvárad (Sărăţeni), Énlaka (Inlăceni), Székelyudvarhely (Odorhei Secuiesc), and Homoródszentpál (Sînpaul). In the region of the eastern front, the borderline separating Dacia Superior and Dacia Inferior is not clear.
With regard to Dacia Inferior, its northeastern and eastern borders also constituted the frontier of the empire. In the east, the line ran along the western ranges of the eastern Carpathians, with camps at Olthévíz (Hoghiz), Oltszem (Olteni), Komolló (Comolău), and Nagyborosnyó (Boroşneul Mare). The Ojtoz pass was guarded by the forward camp at Bereck (Breţcu). To the southwest, the Olt valley was guarded by camps at Kissink (Cincşor), Földvár (Feldioara), and, later, by a camp at Caput Stenarum (Bojca, Boiţa) which secured the Vöröstorony pass. Since there were no natural defences south of the Carpathians, a dense line of camps had to be built on the Oltenian Plain to guard against attack from the Sarmatian Roxolani. Two lines of defence were constructed on the {1-71.} eastern border. The inner one ran along the Olt River; according to epigraphs at Bivolari, Racoviţa, Copăceni, and Rădăcineşt, the camps were probably rebuilt in stonework towards the end of Hadrian's reign.[26] There were camps of normal scale (that at Slăveni measured 169 by 190 metres) as well as a series of smaller forts (Copăceni, Titeşti, Bivolari, Sîmpotin, Stolniceni, and Enoşeşti). Some 25–30 kilometres east of the Olt line, the Romans added a parallel, outer line of defence on a north-south axis, the 'Limes Transalutanus'. Pending excavations, the date of its construction can only be guessed at. The general assumption is that the Limes Transalutanus was constructed around 200 A.D., and abandoned by the middle of the 3rd century. Even without excavation, the traces found at certain camps (Săpata de Jos, Urluieni, Băneasa) of two forts, side by side, indicate two construction periods, for it is unlikely that they would have been in use simultaneously. This suggests that the camps in the outer line were used for a longer period of time, and that they may have been constructed before 200. There were earthworks, some three metres high, at a distance of 150–300 metres on the eastern approaches to the camps. Towards the northern end, the outer defensive line, like the Olt line, turns northeastward with the camps at Pürkerec (Purcăreni) and Cîmpulung; the two ends of the Törcsvár pass were guarded by forts at Rukkor (Rucăr) and Barcarozsnyó (Rîşnov).
The fact that Dacia was a geographical salient, deep into Barbaricum, determined the layout of its military defences. It needed protection from attack in three directions, along extensive borders. No camps were built where passage was barred by impassable mountains. For defence in depth, additional camps were built along river valleys away from the frontier. In addition to those along the Maros, camps were built to protect the road to Napoca from northern attack at Gyalu (Gilău), near the junction of the Hideg- and Meleg Szamos rivers, and near the KisSzamos river at Szamosújvár (Gherla). Camps at Maroskeresztúr (Cristeşti) and Segesvár {1-72.} (Sighişoara) protected the valleys of the Maros and the Nagy- Küküllő, respectively, against attack from the east. The camps in Oltenia and the Banat also served to protect lines of communication with the inner empire. As in the case of other provinces, Dacia's frontier fortifications clearly demarcated the reach of the province and of the empire.
There were some 80 military camps in Dacia. Indication of the dates of construction has yet to be unearthed, but it is likely that a few of them were used for only a short period. The large overall number is explained by the fact that on the Olt limes and the Transalutanus, only a few camps were of normal size, but they were linked by dozens of

smaller posts, and one military unit probably manned several of these. In 164 A.D., the 15 camps in Dacia Porolissensis were manned by 3 mounted and 12 infantry regiments, or some 11,500 soldiers, not counting the legions' special detachments. It has been estimated that in the 2nd century, the total military complement in Dacia — including the legions — stood at 45,000–50,000.
So far, the earliest form of fortification, consisting of earthworks and palisades, has been observed in the unearthed remains of fifteen camps. Under Hadrian and Antoninus Pius, some of the camps were partially or fully reconstructed in stonework; others were not upgraded until the early years of the 3rd century.
The military structure protecting Rome's domain between the mouth of the Tisza River and the Black Sea acquired final shape during the reign of Hadrian. Prior to the conquest of Dacia, Moesia's short Danube border, between the mouth of the Tisza and two of its tributaries the Almum (Lom) and the Ciabrus (Cibrica), was defended by two legions: the IIII Flavia legion in Singidunum (Belgrade) or Ratiaria (Arčar, Bulgaria), and the VII Claudia legion in Viminacium (Kostolac). To the east, the border of Moesia Inferior had been guarded by three evenly-spaced camps, that of the V Macedonica at Oescus (Gigen), of the I Italica at Novae {1-73.} (Svishtov), and of the XI Claudia at Durostorum (Silistra). The conquest of Dacia led to changes in this regular pattern of defence. Dacia's Danubian border with the empire no longer required substantial defence, but the three legions remained on guard along the long border of Moesia Inferior. Therefore, the V Macedonica legion was transferred from Oescus, on the Dacian frontier, to the Danube delta at Troesmis (Igliţa). The legion IIII Flavia was moved from Moesia Superior's short Danubian border to join the occupation forces in Dacia. The camp at Ratiaria was shut down; there, and at Oescus, colonies were founded by Trajan. No evidence has surfaced concerning the camps of auxiliary units, but it is clear that the military complement on Dacia's border with the empire was reduced considerably.

The Long War, and Renewal in the Severan Era 3. THE ROMAN PROVINCE OF DACIA
(Endre Tóth) The Population: Dacians and Settlers
Settlements and Urbanization
With the conquest, Dacia's land became property of the Roman state, to be classified, according to its administrative status, as military, municipal, or belonging to the Emperor. Dacia was granted the status of province by Trajan soon after the conquest. It would have been difficult to draw settlers to this sparsely populated region if it had remained under military administration, which denoted insecurity. To introduce civil administration, Trajan needed {1-92.} to create autonomous towns, and this came about, at the latest, between 110–112. The first such town, Colonia Ulpia Traiana Augusta (known later as Sarmizegethusa) was founded on Trajan's instructions by the governor; those who were settled there included veterans of the Dacian Wars from the XIV Gemina, V Macedonica, and XI Claudia legions. The remaining native Dacians earned less consideration than the veterans; since agricultural land was scarce, there was a greater incentive here than in other new colonia to move out the indigenous population. Colonia Ulpia Traiana Augusta remained Dacia's sole town until the reign of Hadrian. The establishment of the province of Dacia had a greater effect on urbanization in other parts of the Balkans, which the defeat of the Dacians had made more secure. Trajan founded a series of towns in the Balkan provinces, including Ratiaria, Oescus, Nicopolis, Tropaeum Traiani, Marcianopolis, Traianopolis, and Augusta Traiana (Beroe). The Emperor thereby gave strong impetus to urbanization and the consequent spread of Roman culture in the regions south of the Danube. The scale of urbanization in the Balkan peninsula is all the more remarkable when one notes that in Pannonia, Trajan founded only one town, Poetovio (Ptuj, Yugoslavia).
Dacia's newly-founded town soon regained the name of Sarmizegethusa Regia, despite the fact that it was situated on previously unsettled land, some 37 kilometres to the west of Decebalus' capital. It is likely that the site had been briefly occupied after the war by the legion IIII Flavia, before the unit's transfer to Bersovia (Zsidovin), in the western Banat. To be sure, it was the Romans' common practice to preserve earlier place names. The Romans could note these names because the settlements were still in existence when their army occupied the region. In his history of the wars, Trajan listed the localities that were progressively invested by his troops, e.g., 'we advanced to Bersobis, and then to Aisis'. There are other known reports on the campaign, and these probably {1-93.} helped the Romans to name their camps after more or less proximate Dacian villages. The adoption of indigenous place names does not, however, indicate survival of the settlements — least of all in Dacia, where towns were generally established on or near the sites of former Roman camps. The installation of a military camp at a village resulted in the displacement of the local population. When a camp was located at some distance from a local settlement, the name of the latter was sometimes adopted, as with Aquincum and Brigetio, in Pannonia, or Singidunum in Moesia. The conquerors' free use of Dacian place names is exemplified by Sarmizegethusa Regia and Colonia Dacica. In short, it cannot be assumed that adoption of Dacian names for Roman camps signifies the survival of the original settlements or the continued presence of indigenous people in the vicinity. At times, the Romans also gave their installations the Dacian names of rivers, compounding the toponymic confusion.
When Dacia was reorganized by Hadrian into three provinces, Colonia Ulpia Traiana Sarmizegethusa became the administrative center of Dacia Superior, and a new town was founded in each of the other two provinces. The town in the southeastern province, Dacia Inferior, was located on the vicus of the military camp guarding the north end of the Danube bridge at Drobeta. Heavy traffic across the bridge had promoted the natural development of a settlement on the vicus, making it the logical site for an autonomous town. In the northern province, Dacia Porolissensis, Napoca (Kolozsvár) was raised to the rank of municipium. Due to insufficient archaeological research, nothing is known about the previous settlement or about the new town's topography. That the town was situated on the site of the former Roman camp is suggested by some bricks bearing military stamps, as well as by a milestone, found at Ajtony, which marked the highway between Napoca and Potaissa and bears the names of those towns. The road had been constructed right after the war, in 109–110. Since the Romans' first priority {1-94.} in the conquered territories was to assure a strategic link between military garrisons, it follows that Napoca-Potaissa road connected two camps.
Contrary to general opinion, evidence shows that the urbanization of the province proceeded very slowly. The

founding of the first colonia was necessitated by the introduction of a civilian administration, while the other two came about in consequence of the creation of additional provinces. There is less information on the date and circumstances of the foundation of other towns. The vicus of the camp at Romula (Reşca, Oltenia) became a municipium after the transfer of the garrison, probably under Antoninus Pius or Marcus Aurelius. The civilian settlement near the legion camp at Apulum was raised by Marcus Aurelius to the rank of town (Apulum I); it was upgraded to a colonia no later than Commodus's reign. The pace of urbanization picked up during Septimius Severus' reign, probably helped by the Dacian army's support for the new Emperor and by the appointment of his brother as governor. The canabae of the legion camps at Apulum (Apulum II) and Potaissa were granted the rank of municipium at this time. The vici of two camps along the Danube, at Dierna (Orsova) and Tibiscum (Zsuppa), became municipii in the third century, possibly by the reign of the Severus emperors. Concurrently, Drobeta became a colonia, and Caracalla (211–217) granted that privilege to Potaissa and Apulum II. Sources indicate that a town named Malva was a colonia in 230; opinions are divided on whether it can be identified with Romula. The legal status of the largest settlement in the mining district, Ampelum, is also uncertain, for there is no clear evidence that it was an autonomous town. If Ampelum did win this status, it must have been in the third century.
The pattern of Danubian legion camps was repeated at Apulum, where two settlements materialized in close proximity to each other and to the military installation. One, the canabae, was on a site under military supervision, and was occupied mainly by families {1-95.} of the legionaries. The other, civilian settlement grew up around the province's military headquarters. However, in contrast to other Danubian towns, both of these settlements were granted autonomy. The sources do not reveal clearly which of these towns corresponds to Marcus Aurelius' municipium and Commodus' colony, and which to the municipium of the Severan period. The settlement on the Maros (Maros-Portus, Partoş) may well have been the forerunner of the civilian municipium, and later Colonia Aurelia Apulensis; it also bore the name Chrysopolis ('Golden Town') in 252–53. The municipium of the Severan period (the military settlement) was elevated to colonia by Trajan Decius in the middle of the 3rd century.
Thus there were three or four municipii and eight coloniae in Dacia; the status of Ampelum is uncertain, as is the identification of Malva with Romula. The number is fewer than in the region's other provinces. Moesia Superior, with a smaller territory, had 13 towns, and Pannonia, which was only slightly larger than Dacia, had 20–23. Moreover, towns were distributed relatively evenly across the other provinces, whereas in Dacia they were all located in the western regions. What might have caused this disparity?
Rome's administrative network encompassed towns endowed with local government, the municipii and coloniae. Some, or all of their inhabitants enjoyed the rights of Roman citizens. The authority of local government extended to the town's hinterland, where lay the townspeople's garden plots, the villages, and manorial farms. The first towns in the Danubian provinces came into being when settlements spawned by military camps, indigenous communities formed into entities called 'civitas', and settlements of veterans who had benefited from land-grants (deductio) were given the legal right to self-government (lex municipalis). Eventually, other major civilian settlements, notably those at highway junctions, were also raised to town status.
{1-96.} Despite the lack of adequate topographical research, the broad outlines of Dacia's urban development are clear. In contrast to the pattern in other provinces, no civitatis were organized in Dacia, and their absence predetermined the nature of urbanization. Elsewhere, these administrative structures, which were designed for the indigenous population, paved the way for the emergence of towns; they fostered Romanization and facilitated the eventual introduction of local government. The absence of civitatis in Dacia was probably the main reason why many significant settlements — some five or six in number — were granted town status only during the reign of Septimius Severus. In Pannonia, only two towns were clearly established in the corresponding period, for that province's urban development had been essentially concluded by the end of the 2nd century.
Dacia's towns had to be based on the settlements near army camps, the only places where larger communities sprang up. In the 2nd century, there remained obstacles to this process. The soldiers' families, veterans, merchants, and craftsmen lived in the canabae of the legion camps and the vici of the auxiliary units, both of which were under military authority. The municipalization of the canabae would have required transferring some military land to the towns; but that land supplied the needs of the military. The result was a considerable delay in Dacia's urban development, for such land transfer became feasible only during the reign of Septimius Severus. Thanks to the large number of camps (around 80), the military controlled vast areas, and settlements in these areas could only be

converted to towns when they ceased to be under the authority of the army. Apparently, Dacia's larger communities all fell in this category.
The late conquest of Dacia did not leave enough time for purely civilian communities to grow to sufficient size. In contrast, Pannonia's communities benefited from a hundred years of development before they were made into towns by Hadrian. Moreover, for fifty years, only one legion was stationed in Dacia. In sum, {1-97.} Dacia's problem was that it had no civilian communities large enough to be raised to town rank, except for those whose elevation was blocked by their location in military zones. After the first colonia had been founded on the basis of deductio, further urbanization in Dacia could only come by raising the vici to town rank, and that had to await the closure of the proximate military camps. This may have been the case with Napoca under Hadrian. Drobeta, the other municipium, was anomalous, for the military units identified in epigraphs belonged to the Moesian, not the Dacian army. The authority of provincial legati was strictly confined to their territory, yet it is highly unlikely that the two ends of this important bridge came under the authority of different legati. It is therefore possible that Drobeta's territorium, a source of military supplies, lay not in Oltenia but south of the Danube. If so, the vicus, or purely civilian settlement near Drobeta might have been detached from the camp, and removed from the jurisdiction of Moesia Inferior, allowing it to be raised to town status and granted a territorium within Oltenia.
In any case, the conversion of the settlements at Napoca and Drobeta into towns was motivated, not by some plan for Dacia's urban development, but by administrative necessity arising from the creation of two new provinces. Romula, established under Marcus Aurelius or Commodus, was also sited on a former military camp and vicus.
Thus, only one civilian settlement, Apulum I, was raised to town status in Dacia, and it, too, owed its existence to the legion. With regard to Potaissa, where a legion was garrisoned in 167, it is unclear whether a civilian community large enough for municipalization had emerged by the end of the 2nd century, or whether it was the canabae that was raised to town rank. Four other municipalities were founded in the 2nd century, pursuant to the closure the camps of auxiliary units. In the Severan era, it was the turn of these camps' vici to be turned into towns. This departed from the practice in other Danubian provinces, where the vici — however large — of auxiliary units were not municipalized. In these provinces, there {1-98.} existed civilian communities ripe for municipalization, which was not the case in Dacia, even at the time of the Severus dynasty.
Clearly, urbanization in Dacia had been more dependent on the presence of the army than in the other provinces, and it is just as clear that the remnants of the indigenous population played no role in the process. In these circumstances, the region's few towns, concentrated in western Dacia, could not serve as effective propagators of Roman culture.
The slow pace of urbanization is not the only indication that Dacia remained underpopulated in the 2nd century. A purposeful wish to embellish reality may be seen in the attribution of the term 'metropolis' to the sister towns at Apulum, Colonia Aurelia Apulensis Chrysopolis, and Sarmizegethusa; or in the minting of coins inscribed 'Dacia felix' ('Happy Dacia') at a turbulent moment in the 3rd century, just before Rome abandoned the province. Dacia also enjoyed a more tangible distinction, one in which it outdid the other Danubian provinces: up to five of its towns — Sarmizegethusa, Napoca, Apulum, Potaissa, and perhaps Dierna — were granted the ius Italicum under Septimius Severus, if not earlier. (There is no evidence that this right, which entailed exemption from land tax, was held by any of Pannonia's towns.) The purpose was to make Dacia more attractive to settlers, for early efforts at resettlement had not brought the desired results; indeed, by the 160s, people were emigrating from Dacia. The long-lasting Marcomanni wars and the plague epidemic also contributed to reduce Dacia's population. The shortage of people had a negative effect on the development of an urban culture and, consequently, on Dacia's ability to attract new settlers. After the wars, economic hardship and the delay in establishing local government led to civil disturbances. Radical remedies were needed to improve the situation and induce immigration — hence the granting of ius Italicum. This measure clearly paid off, for it drew Syrians and other settlers from the east.
{1-99.} It seems that a provincial council was established in the same period, as were civilian institutions dedicated to the cult of the Emperor; it is certainly odd that the latter had not materialized earlier in Dacia. In any case, there is no record of high priests of the Emperor's cult (sacerdos arae Augustorum) before the Severan era, nor of a provincial council (concilium provinciae). In the Roman empire, these councils were the highest-level organizations encompassing towns as well as the civitatis of the indigenous population. Beside nurturing the cult of the Emperor, they had an important function in representing popular interests: at the end of a governor's term of



Settlements and Urbanization
https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/17.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:26:29]
office, the council could appeal to the Emperor against his excesses and unjust measures. In the Severan era, references in epigraphs to a provincial council multiply. The title 'metropolis', denoting the seat of the provincial council, is mentioned in connection with Sarmizegethusa only during the reign of Alexander Severus (222–235). Two reasons could explain the late formation of a council. First, the authorities might have considered that the small number of towns in the 2nd century did not warrant such an institution or the organized promotion of the emperor's cult. In any case, the cult was nurtured both in the army camps, and, by the augustali, in the few existing towns. Second, the authorities may have felt that the small indigenous population, which lacked a network of civitatis, had no need for a full-fledged organization devoted to the cult and to Romanization. In the Severan era, however, the population grew, as did the number of towns, making timely the creation of a council and a cult organization. As in the eastern province, the cult's high priest was called coronatus (stephanephoros in Greek), meaning 'one who wears a laurel crown'. The high priests were chosen from among the province's wealthiest citizens, and most of them held the rank of knight. The high priest's title and the designation of Sarmizegethusa as a metropolis suggest an eastern influence, due perhaps to the number of eastern immigrants.
{1-100.} Thus full-fledged towns, with appropriate institutions, finally materialized in Dacia during the Severan era. The province had already been in existence for a hundred years, but it was to enjoy only a few more decades of peace, a time-span that would limit the Romanizing impact of the towns.
Less is known of about rural settlements. It appears that the spread of manorial farms, the villas, was linked to urbanization. Traces of the manors of agricultural estates are concentrated around towns in the western half of the province, mainly in Transylvania. They were most numerous along the Sarmizegethusa-Porolissum road: Hobica, Őraljaboldogfalva, Magyarosd, Déva, Rehó, Nagyenyed, Apahida-Pusztaszentmiklós, Csomafája, Magyargorbó, Kajántó, and Szenterzsébet. Excavations were confined to the principal buildings; the most complete traces are those of the villa at Csomafája, including its outer stone fence. These manor houses generally had an area of around 400 sq. metres, which, together with the absence of adornments such as mosaics, murals, and marble panelling, puts these villas in the category of small to medium estates. The extent of the properties was dictated by the amount and distribution of agricultural land. Few traces of villa buildings have been found on the Oltenian plain, despite that region's suitability for agricultural production. Judging from some epigraphs, most of the estates must have been owned by veterans. They must have grown crops suited to the mountainous region, such as barley and millet. An epigraph in Oltenia mentions a vineyard.[42] The breeding of sheep, goats, and cattle was probably an important activity on the villas, and covered domestic demand for meat.

3. THE KINGDOM OF THE GEPIDS 3. THE KINGDOM OF THE GEPIDS Gepidic Settlement in Transylvania
The Gepids during and after the Hun Period
The Gepids were becoming powerful and prosperous even under Hun rule. This is amply demonstrated by archaeological finds on the territory covered by Gepidia after the withdrawal north of the Körös River; the finds are of a richness that is exceptional in the Carpathian Basin, and even in Europe. Under Ardaric's reign, there emerged a new military aristocracy that built manor houses and obviously drew considerable profit from fighting in the Hun {1-189.} overlords' wars. Its members were buried alone, in secrecy, near their manor houses. Men's graves are few, for many of the military leaders must have died on the battlefields and in the revolt against the Huns. The grave found at Érmihályfalva held an eminent aristocrat; the period of his inhumation is revealed by the coin in his mouth, a Hun-period copy, dating from around 450, of Theodosius II's gold solidus originally minted at Thessaloniki in 443. The deceased himself is a model of the 'sword-wielding furious Gepids' of the Hun period: he was buried with not one, but two swords, a long double-edged sword in a silver-mounted scabbard, and a 52centimetre long Hun dagger in a sheath made of wood and leather. The belt of the long sword was decorated with a large amber disc, a common amulet in that century, and his shield had an iron boss to protect the warrior's hand. Of the same period is grave no. 1 at Gencs-Akasztódomb, which held a dagger of Hun origin as well as a costly glass beaker. The solidi of Theodosius II, minted in 429–30, serve to date many graves (Nyírbátor, Bikács, Szilágysomlyó, Lonkafalva). Their Hun replicas, minted by order of Attila around 450, do the same for other graves (Végardó, Érmihályfalva, Nagydoba-Liget, Kápolnokmonostor). The latter are contemporary with a solidus (found at Csög, Kendilóna) from a late minting under Valentinian III (425–455).
An even richer source are the isolated graves of Gepidic noblewomen of the Hun period, whose large number may be a consequence of the reduced area of settlement during Hun rule. The deceased were generally garbed in typically 'new rich' style. The Gepidic noblewomen were covered in jewels: heavy, cast-silver fibulae, large and unshapely, on their shoulders, a collection of bead necklaces, several silver bracelets, the customary large gold earrings, and one or two large silver clasps on their clothes and belts. The 'new Hun fashion article,' a metallic mirror with radial decoration on the back, is present in virtually every grave, while the provisions for the afterlife were stored in 'Hun' jugs with ears, often {1-190.} accompanied by a costly, decorated glass (Mád, Tiszalök, Balsa, Székely, Vencsellő, Barabás [formerly Mezőkaszony], Szamostatárfalva, Érdengeleg). Few graves have been found of less wealthy propertied women from the Hun period; one of these, grave no. 2 at Gencs-Akasztódomb, yielded a bronze earring, a small silver fibula, and also big glass and amber beads. The common burial grounds of small farming settlements, each consisting of a few graves, and dating from the post-Hun period, have been discovered at Rétközberencs, Bere, Körösgyéres, and Piskolt, where the finds include double-sided combs. There were probably similar graveyards at Bere-Szőlőhegy and Érendréd-Malomdomb (where earrings ending in a solid polyhedric button and a vessel with smoothed ornaments were found). In another cemetery of this type, at Érmihályfalva, the local, male leader bore a dagger of Hun origin, much like the military leaders noted earlier, while the women sported the prevailing Hun fashion: earrings, ending in solid polyhedric buttons, that imitated those of noblewomen, which had cloisonné and gold decoration, as well as the double-sided fine-tooth comb. It was around this time that the Gepids generally adopted a new custom, one that attests to the attraction of Arian Christianity: they began to bury their dead not on a north-south, but on a west-east axis. Among the graveyards of this period that have been discovered so far, the largest and longest-used is the 2nd burial site at Ártánd; however, there are numerous contemporary graves, sites, and burial objects (such as the fine-tooth combs from Szalacs and Bihardiószeg). The site at Bihar includes a settlement that consisted of sunken floor dwellings (with traces of a combmaker's bonecutting workshop in one of them), their roofs held up by two posts, as well as of authentic Germanic houses with many posts; and several graves, one of which yielded a pair of bronze earrings ending in a solid polyhedric button. Other graveyards from this period include those at Érkörtvélyes-Ligethegy and Nagyvárad-Szalkaterasz (which also has an earlier, Hun grave whose occupant bore a {1-191.} sword, a dagger, and arrows), yielding jugs and pots with superb smoothed decoration, channelled jars and mugs; and at Biharpüspöki and Nagyvárad-Micskepuszta, the latter yielding a 5th-century glass cup. The previously mentioned graves, containing weapons, at Érkörtvélyes-Égető-hegy and Szilágysomlyó may also date from this period.



The Gepids during and after the Hun Period
https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/34.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:26:40]
The expansion of Gepidic settlements after Ardaric's victory can be fully assessed only with the help of these Gepidic archaeological traces from the Hun period, for it is precisely this culture, based in the Upper Tisza region, that the Gepids took to their new settlements. They did so in at least two waves. Graves of noblewomen, who wore large silver-plated fibulae and jewelled gold earrings, and dating from the immediate post-victory period, appear in the Sebes-Körös and Fehér-Körös zones (Gyulavári, Nagyvárad), in the region of the Maros and the Aranka (Perjámos, Arad-Mikelaka), and even in the Temes region (Őszény, where gold earrings with polyhedral ornaments were found). They are distinguished from earlier finds by late-antique gold beads (Perjámos), which came into the Gepids' possession when the alliance with Byzantium facilitated a revival of trade.
The occupation of lands in Transylvania by Gepidic aristocrats of the Hun period is attested by similar grave finds that yielded several earrings with cloisonné ornamental buttons (Bánffyhunyad, Medgyes, Kisselyk, and what were probably two graves in Hunyad county). The period of Gepidic settlement is indicated by the late gold coins of Theodosius II, minted between 443 and 450. The Huns had received these as tribute, and passed on a few to their Gepidic allies; but while such coins are found only rarely in Hun graves, the offering of a funeral obolus was typical of the Gepids. Coins of this type have been found at Nagybánya-Asszonypataka, Válaszút, KolozsvárSzamoshíd, Hidalmás, Ajtony, Felsőidecs, Kerelőszentpál, Radnót (minting of 443 at Thessaloniki), Mese, Gyulafehérvár, Hunyad-Dobra in the Maros valley (discovered in {1-192.} 1811), and as far as Orsova on the Lower Danube. An even more precise dating is given by the gold solidi of Leo I (457–474), found, mostly in graves, at Kelnek, Uzdiszentgyörgy, and Torda (three bronze or gold coins). Also from this period is a rare gold coin, found at Biharszentandrás, of the Western Roman Emperor Libius Severus (461–465); it was probably brought back from the Roman empire by a Gepidic mercenary.
However, part of the Gepidic nobility did not leave the more secure 'old homeland' until the conquest of the Sirmia — Pannonia Sirmiensis — in 473. That was where the colourful new, post-Hun culture emerged, a culture that would then spread to the Gepids' older areas of settlement. This was a culture of conquerors, of those who shared in the annual tribute of one hundred pounds (almost 32 kg) of Byzantine gold. This second wave of settlement is represented by the rich grave find (silver fibulae and an elaborately- wrought gold ring with a cloisonné head) in the Temes region, at the brick factory of Nagyszentmiklós-Keresztúr-puszta.

The Gepids during and after the Hun Period 3. THE KINGDOM OF THE GEPIDS Gepidic Kings in Transylvania
Gepidic Settlement in Transylvania
The background data presented so far helps one to trace the evolution of Gepidic settlement in Transylvania. The final phase of that process is marked by Zeno's (471–491) solidus, found at Hátszeg. The new aristocracy (called logimoi in contemporary Greek sources) lived in manor houses situated at the centre of their property, just as they had in the Tisza region, and were evidently buried near these homes. The women's superb jewels are the products of the goldsmith's workshop at 'Gáva-Beregvidék'; most beautiful are the richly gilded and decorated, jewelled fibulae which found their way to the Hungarian National Museum in the mid-19th century, although, regrettably, the source is noted simply as 'Transylvania' or 'Hungary'. Earlier, the Antiken-kabinet (today's Kunsthistorisches Museum) in Vienna had acquired a similar {1-193.} pair of decorated fibulae, together with an ornamented silver clasp that, according to an early Transylvanian source, had been unearthed at Magyarvalkó (incorrectly identified as 'Mariersdorf'). In 1856 a gilded ornamental fibula and a jewelled gold earring with polyhedral decoration were found at Kisselyk-Steinweg — probably in a grave, though this was not noted at the time; this is the earliest Gepidic find in an identified location in the Carpathian Basin. A similar jewelled and gilded, silver fibula, the stem of which had been ritually broken off, was found at Nagyekemező ('im Kessel'). Finds that indicate noblemen's graves include a pair of gold earrings, ending in a polyhedric button, and an ornamental silver buckle, its jewelled tongue decorated with an animal's head, at Segesvár-Baierndorf, and an earring with a twisted ring as well as a jewelled polyhedric button at Medgyes. Other finds of gold objects — a bracelet at Kelnek, and a ring with a bull's head from Brassó or, more likely, Kolozsvár — suggest that in the 5th century, aristocratic manor houses were more typical of southern Transylvania than of other regions. This would not be surprising, for the Gepid leader who ruled over the Mezőség (Transylvanian plain) lived, along with his retinue, near the Kis-Szamos River.
In the second half of the 5th century, the centre of Gepidic settlement arose around the ruins of the ancient city of Napoca, in the valley of the Kis-Szamos. The burial grounds that have been discovered there contain only a few graves, but they are remarkable for their richness. The deceased had been probably military assistants of the princely ruler, who had set up his residence amid the walls of Napoca. Pairs of gold earrings with polyhedral buttons — this jewel can be regarded as the key find of the period — were found in graves at the Rettegi garden in Apahida (in the 1880s) and at Kolozsvár (in 1912). The graves near Kolozsvár, and contemporary graves elsewhere in Transylvania, contain other objects that correspond closely to the rich finds in the graves of common people in the Ér and Berettyó valleys, and thus there can be no doubt as to their origin.
{1-194.} At Kolozsvár-Kardosfalva, a short Hun sword and a quiver holding arrows were found in the grave of what was obviously a warrior. The graves of women from the same small community held bronze earrings with solid polyhedric button as well as bone combs; that of a woman of higher rank contained large, ornamental fibula, a simpler version of the noblewomen's fibulae. A third, small burial ground at Kolozsvár yielded a vessel, a comb, and a clasp similar to those found in the graves at Érmihályfalva, indicating that the deceased family came from the same district. In graves at Kolozsvár-Szamosfalva, two women also wore silver earrings with polyhedric buttons as well as amber and glass beads, while a third had a fibula made in the Tisza region (the Bakodpuszta type) in the 460s or 470s; a similar fibula was found more recently at Magyarkapus. Further along the Kis-Szamos, at Apahida, a pair of silver earrings with polyhedric buttons and a bronze clasp indicate the grave of a less affluent warrior's wife; the same location yielded a contemporary pot, with fine smoothed decoration, which originated in — or was made by a craftsman who had come from — the Tisza region. In neighbouring Gyulatelke, a similar early Gepidic pot with a large orifice and smoothed decoration indicates a grave; and a short distance away, at Cege, a woman's richer grave contained beads, a double-sided comb, and an earring. The fibula found at Cege is a larger ornament, similar to that of Szamosfalva; this type was common in the 5th century from the Crimea to the Czech Basin, and it can be surmised that some of them were crafted in the Gepids' land. The graves (with early fibulae) found at Magyarkapus, along the Kis-Szamos west of Kolozsvár, and to the south, the settlement at Ajtony (where a potsherd inscribed with runic characters [!] was found) all confirm the dating of the princely seat.
At Mezőszopor, Gepids had established a small community, and buried their dead, on the overgrown and levelled

ground of a Daco-Roman graveyard that had been abandoned around 270; although this settlement is more distant, it can nevertheless be linked to the class of landed retainers of the princely seat at Napoca. The graves were subsequently despoiled, but a few remaining beads and the cheaper, 5th century bronze fibula that was presumably dropped by a grave robber indicate that the deceased had been ranking freemen. Similar fibulae were found in older graves of the Gepidic burial sites of Kiszombor and Malomfalva. A fibula that was allegedly found at Verespatak is of a similar type and dates from roughly the same period.
Many graves and finds of this early phase, between 455 and 500, have been found in the Transylvanian Basin and in the valleys. At Maroslekence, the graves are dated by a short sword and triple-edged arrowheads, both Hunnic, a bronze earring with polyhedric button, and a deformed skull; at Malomfalva-Podej, the grave, whose occupant had a deformed skull, is dated by an early type of vessel and a comb. Some of the 6th-century farmstead graveyards had their origins in this period — for instance, at Betlenszentmiklós and Maroscsapó, where silver and bronze earrings with polyhedric buttons identify early graves; at the latter site, a deformed skull also dates the grave.
The Gepids were influenced by their Hun overlords' oriental notion of beauty; thus they adopted the practice of manipulating the skulls of infants in order to produce the 'fashionable' elongated head. When the Huns' rule came to an end, the Gepids gave up this practice, and the last people with deformed skulls died out in the first decades of the 6th century. Therefore, in terms of Gepidic history, this custom is considered a clear indication of ethnicity as well as of period (ca. 440–520). Gepidic deformed skulls have been found at many sites in Transylvania (Székelyudvarhely-Marhapiac [1874], Szászbonyha, Segesvár-Herzes, Baráthely [7], Galacfalva- Vermek, Maroslekence, Malomfalva-Hula and Malomfalva-Podej, Marosveresmart [the isolated grave, possibly from the Hun period, of a male with a deformed skull, accompanied by arrowheads], {1-196.} Maroscsapó, and MagyarkapusKenderáj) and in the eastern part of the Hungarian Great Plain (Elek-Kispél, Magyarád, and Arad-Gáj).
These small burial grounds are almost invariably in the proximity of sunken floor 'houses'. Silver earrings with polyhedric buttons were discovered also farther west along the Maros, at Inakfalva. To the northeast, a burial ground at Újős-Papdomb (Beszterce-Naszód county) yielded a bronze earring with a polyhedric button, and bronze clasps were found at Beresztelke. A bracelet was unearthed at Marosportus, in the southwest. All of these objects indicate the early presence of Gepids.
The enumerated sites serve to delimit the strip of land by the Maros occupied in the earlier wave of Gepidic settlement. Further south, near the Nagy-Küküllő, only few sites have been identified. At SzékelyudvarhelyMarhapiac, the grave whose occupant had a deformed skull also contained an earring with polyhedric button and a crescent-shaped braid fastener; the burial ground of a farmstead at Medgyes-Theba yielded a silver earring with polyhedric button and necklaces of amber and glass beads; a Gepidic fine-tooth comb was found in the grave of a man with a deformed skull at Segesvár-Herzes; and it has been reported that at the seventh site at Baráthely, a rich grave contained a deformed skull, gold and silver earrings, clasps, and ornamental pins with pierced heads. Farther still to the south, early Gepidic settlement — and the remarkable unity of these people's culture and costume — is witnessed by a single grave find: at Szelindek-Stempen, a woman's grave, aligned on a west-east axis, yielded silver earrings with polyhedric buttons. This pair of fibulae, decorated with birds' heads, were crafted in the Tisza region; similar fibulae have been found near Szentes (Bökénymindszent) and, even more significantly, at Szabadka, in a region that was evacuated by the Gepids and turned into a border zone after the army of Theodoric the Great had occupied Pannonia Sirmiensis (i.e. Sirmia, the territory that borders on the Banat in the south) in 504. The fibulae were therefore made — {1-197.} and probably buried — before this date. The only find in the Fogaras district of the Olt valley comes from Felmér: a jar with smoothed, herring-bone patterns, a masterpiece of 5th century Gepidic pottery. Prototypical versions have been found in the Tisza region.
The archaeological discoveries that have been made to date suffice to trace the Gepids' settlement in Transylvania. They reached the region through the Meszes Pass. By the 4th century, Gepids ruled over the Szamos valley as far as the Meszes Mountains, roughly to the bend near Zsibó (that is, to the border of the former Dacia). When, after the collapse of Gothic rule, the Gepids made their first attempt to conquer Dacia, their advance was soon blocked by the Huns, and they had to withdraw from the Transylvanian Basin. But their withdrawal did not go much past Dés, for they were present in the valley of the Nagy-Szamos even during the era of Hun rule, as is shown by the coins discovered at Kápolnokmonostor and Nagydoba, and by the graves of Újős-Papdomb, Budatelke, and Dombhát-Fürdő. After the collapse of Hun rule, the Gepids once again advanced through the Meszes Pass into

Transylvania's heartland, and notably into the Kis- Szamos valley. The conquerors were Gepids from the SzamosÉr region, who brought their earlier material culture. The noblemen, accompanied by their families and servants, carved out their new estates mainly in southern Transylvania, south of the Maros, in the valley of the Küküllő neither in the 5th nor in the 6th century was this area populated by the common people. It appears that the manor houses in southern Transylvania were abandoned — as a consequence of internal or defence policy — before the end of the 6th century.
The 5th-century settlement area of the Gepids extended in the shape of a wedge from the Kis-Szamos towards the southeast, past the middle reaches of the Maros, and with the thin end of the wedge reaching about as far as Nagyszeben. This expansion could not have involved large numbers of people, for there is hardly any trace {1-198.} of 5th-century villages (except, perhaps, at Nagygalambfalva- Várfele and Péterlaka). The small groups of settlers established farmsteads of a type common among the Gepids of the Hungarian Great Plain, with small graveyards nearby. From the beginning of the 6th century, the pattern of settlement began to change. The political and economic catalyst of this change was the disappearance, i.e. the liquidation or transfer of the princely capital that had been founded on the ruins of Napoca.

The Gepids in the Period of Merovingian Culture 3. THE KINGDOM OF THE GEPIDS Gepidic Burial Grounds
Gepidic Sites and Settlements
The fact that many sites dating from this period have been found is indicative of economic and political stability. Most of them were discovered in the Maros region. As a rule, the villages, most of which date from the turn of the 6th century, were not established on the site of earlier settlements; the rare Roman, 4th-century Gothic, or prehistoric antecedent seems almost coincidental. They were the new villages of a newly-arrived (or newly-settled) population of farmers and stock-breeders.
The best known Gepidic village is Malomfalva (Moreşti), parts of which were unearthed near Podej, on the north bank of the Maros. The thirty-four 'pit-dwellings', of various sizes, were rectangular in shape, with rounded corners. On the narrower ends, their tent roofs were held up by beams resting on one, two, or, most commonly, three posts. The roofs of the two largest 'houses' were supported by double posts; judging from the loom weights which fell on the floor in heaps during the final conflagration, the structures must have housed looms. Other pits yielded quern-stones and blacksmith's tools. The workers left behind bone combs, spindle whorls, iron knives, and cheap bronze fibulae, as well as items that must have belonged to very poor people — iron and bronze pins for fastening clothes, and bronze hairpins; all these correspond to articles found in other Gepidic graves of the same period. A profusion of earthen vessels and potsherds also help to date the site with some precision: it was inhabited between 500 and 567. Other finds on the site — jugs, with spouts, and variously smoothed, stamped, or decorated with knife pricks ('Keilstick'), pots, crocks, and mugs — are characteristic of contemporary villages and burial grounds throughout the Gepidic settlement area of the 6th century. Graves {1-207.} yielded smaller versions of the pots, decorated with undulating lines, that previously had only been found in settlements (similar ones were also found in Gepidic villages by the Tisza). The inhabitants of the settlement were breeders of stock: mainly cattle, some horses, and, as a sideline, sheep and pigs as well.
The earlier parts of the settlement gradually had to be abandoned, for the dugout dwellings, with roofs made of weeds, hay, or reed, became uninhabitable. The later section was destroyed by fire, and it was never rebuilt; at the same time, the graveyard ceased to be used. A settlement of comparable size, at Baráthely, is reported to date from the 4th–6th(?) centuries, and to include houses with stone fireplaces and ovens.
The settlements at Malomfalva (including the graveyard), Kisselyk-Várhegy, and Kisgalambfalva-Galáth-tető were all surrounded by earthworks. Archaeological excavations have not given a clear answer to the question, whether these ramparts belonged to the prehistoric period (the Bronze or the Iron Age), whether the Gepids themselves extended them or built similar earthworks, or whether they are in fact defensive ramparts dating from the 10th12th centuries. Other Gepidic villages in Transylvania (and in the Great Plain as well) lacked such defences. At Malomfalva, even the exact location of the Gepidic village remains a mystery, for the excavated site, 'protected' by the rampart, consists entirely of workshops, pits, pig-pens, and stables.
The similar 'houses' that have been gradually unearthed at various sites in Szentgyörgy (now part of Maroscsapó) are probably the remains of a small village. Little is known so far about the sunken floor huts discovered at Maroscsapó-Girle and the pit dwelling at Marosludas, and even less about the Gepidic villages and houses discovered at Szászfenes-Láb, Báboc-Sólyomkő, Kolozs-Győrtelek, Ajtony, Radnót-Szentgyörgy, the castle and the Calvinist church at Radnót, Marosnagylak, Méra-Várdűlő, Mezőakna, Mezőerked, Mezőszopor (three huts), Vidrátszeg, Vajdaszentivány, {1-208.} Kutyfalva, Gyulafehérvár-Citadella (where fragments of pots with spouts were found), and Vermes. A fine-tooth comb has been found in a house at Oláhgorbó-Leánydomb, and another finetooth comb as well as a potsherd with beautiful, smoothed decoration, at Belgrád street in Oláhdálya.
Gepidic settlement extended into the valley of the Nagy-Küküllő, where traces of Gepidic villages, mainly sunken floor huts have been discovered at Betfalva, Baráthely, Medgyes-Hosszúvölgy, Segesvár-Szőlők, and on Liberty Square in Székelyudvarhely. Traces of houses of a different type, built above ground and dated by, among other things, fragments of jugs with spouts, were found at Kisselyk-Várhegy; in the case of similar, large rectangular houses at Omlás-tető and Galáth-tető, near Kisgalambfalva, traces remained of the flooring and stone cladding of



Gepidic Sites and Settlements
https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/38.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:27:00]
similar, large rectangular houses, and sunken floor huts were also discovered nearby. The objects found on these sites are clearly Gepidic: ornamental vessels with spouts, and stamped or punched decoration, undecorated pottery made on a wheel, laurel-leaf shaped arrowheads, and spindle whorls. A fragment of a spouted vessel was also recovered from the post-framed, sunken-floor dwellings at Betlenszentmiklós. In the Olt valley, traces of a Gepidic settlement have been found at Sepsiszentgyörgy-Bedeháza. In the Feketeügy valley, there have been significant finds of Gepidic settlements, dating from the 6th century, at Réty-Telek, Felsőcsernáton-Róbert-tag, and, above all, at Kézdipolyán-Kőhát. The sunken-floor dwellings at Polyán are dated by a comb, fibulae, and a bronze pin, all similar to those found at Malomfalva. The dwellings — and, as will be seen, the graveyards — attest that the middle and the upper reaches of the river valleys were settled progressively in the course of the 6th century; as one advances eastward, the settlements and burial grounds are of relatively more recent origin.
Moving westward along the Maros valley, the finds include a Gepidic potters' settlement in the forest of AradCsálya; splendid {1-209.} vessels with smoothed decoration and spouts, accompanied by fragments of ornamental bronze fibulae and a Byzantine bronze clasp with a cruciform filigree decoration, at (Magyar)Pécska-Nagysánc (a prehistoric site!), and a two-sided comb as well as potsherds at Perjámos-Sánchalom. The huts and objects on these Transylvanian sites are similar to those found in Gepidic villages on the Hungarian Great Plain (Battonya, Eperjes, Tiszafüred, etc.).

Conquest, Settlement, and Raids
7. TRANSYLVANIA IN THE PERIOD OF THE HUNGARIAN CONQUEST AND FOUNDATION OF A STATE
The Settlement of Transylvania in the 10th and 11th Centuries
Archaeological Traces in Transylvania of the Hungarian Conquest
The archaeological traces that have been uncovered are few but nevertheless conclusive: at the turn of the 10th century, Hungarians of all social strata began to establish settlements and cemeteries, simultaneously at diverse locations, in Transylvania.
Their earliest major settlement was at ancient Napoca, a strategic road junction. Their burial grounds can be found around the remains of the ancient walls of the town, which, by the end of the 12th century, bore the name Kolozsvár. One of them, located east of the Roman city centre, in Zápolya (later Dostoevski) Street, bears comparison with the settlers' more sizeable burial grounds (e.g., at Kenézlő), although only part of it could be excavated, for the rest had been built over or used as a gravel-pit. The twelve graves that have been discovered probably constitute a third of the original cemetery. Six of the graves held men with sabres, bows and quivers; of these, five also held a folded horsehide and harness, and {1-286.} one a harnessed and stuffed horsehide. One of the graves yielded a trepanned skull! At least four graves had been despoiled at some unknown time. The original richness of the graves can only be guessed at from the objects that the looters left behind: weapon-straps with silver decoration, silver hair-clasps, lyre-shaped belt buckles, harnesses, silver-inlaid stirrups with silver fittings, and the silver hook of a leather pouch. One grave that, holding no harness, was not plundered, yielded a sabre, an iron-hooped quiver, and arrows. The finds in women's graves included silver ornaments from the collars and wrists of their dresses, silver buttons from their fur coats, silver rings, and splendid silver earrings with 'Tokaj type' pendants in the shape of a bunch of grapes (solid and hollow-cast mixed together), and fancy buttons. The style of the Hungarians' burial was without precedent in the region, and so were the found objects: their apparel, the weapons (including sabres, iron-strapped quivers, and forked as well as pierced, whistling arrowheads), and even the pots that had held food when they were placed in the graves of women and children. These 'Saltovo type' pots, from the Don region, were new to the Carpathian Basin. There have also been more recent excavations of graves in the cemetery.
Several of the finds in the Zápolya Street graves may be classified as 'archaic', notably a heart-shaped harness ornament that has Eastern parallels and is rare in Eastern Europe, and also the belt and harness decorations. There is little likelihood that the cemetery, which was established soon after the conquest, belonged to a wealthy, 'middle class' family; in all probability, it was the burial ground of the family and military escort of a high-ranking person who had established residence within the walls. An earring with a grape-bunch pendant, found in a woman's grave at 23 Farkas (later M. Kogălniceanu) Street, points to the presence of another, contemporary cemetery near the old fort.
The graves and cemeteries of the soldiering 'middle classes' spread from the Háromszék, at Eresztevény-Zádogostető (grave {1-287.} with horse and stirrup) and Kézdivásárhely (a bridle, sabre, and unadorned dishes, probably once in a grave, found by the builders of the Bereck railway line) towards the country's interior. In Köpec-Kőcsukk, one grave (with horse) was discovered before World War I, and another in 1927; the latter yielded a horseshoe similar to the one found at Soltszentimre, in a grave that also held a pommel decorated with plates of carved bone. A grave at Sepsiszentgyörgy-Epres-tető held a stuffed horse hide, arrowheads, and a rare Byzantine sword fitted with a bronze cross-bar. A stirrup and a horse's skull and shinbones — signs of a typical burial with horse — have been unearthed in Új Street at Székelyderzs. No details are available concerning the 10th-century settlement and cemetery that were reportedly discovered at Réty-Telek.
As these grave finds indicate, the area later known as the Székelyföld was only sparsely occupied by Hungarian fighters, for the Pecheneg enemy was nearby. A few traces in the Székelyföld of graves that belonged to common people probably date from the same period; none are more recent than the 10th century. The organization of border guards and the settlement of the Hungarians known as Székelys occurred only in the 12th century, in response to the Cumanian-Kun threat.

https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/53.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:27:11]
The first Conquest-era cemetery to be identified in Transylvania was discovered in 1895 at the Zeyk vineyard, near Marosgombás in the Maros valley. Excavations conducted in 1911–12 revealed a single row of twelve graves that held the remains of well-to-do settlers. The men were buried at one end, along with their sabres, war axes, and quivers that held 3, 5, or 7 arrowheads. At the other end, the women's graves yielded dresses with silver-studded collars, short fur coats with silver buttons, Bulgar and Hungarian earrings, and solid bracelets. The burial of horses along with the men was obviously not a rigid custom, for it was not practised by this community. A few of the women's graves were found devastated, and there are no published details of the {1-288.} finds in graves 5–9, although it is known that they yielded a sabre, quiver, and bundled arrowheads. The fireplace of a dwelling was excavated in the same location; Hungarian, rhombus-shaped arrowheads were found on its apron, along with a horse's skull. A similar burial ground was discovered in the valley below the castle at Magyarlapád: the graves held women's remains, with jewels typical of the 'middle class'. The ornamented harness fittings (details of which are yet to be published) that were found at Borosbenedek point to the presence of a wealthier Hungarian woman's grave. A grave with horse was destroyed during the construction of a church at Gyulafehérvár in the 11th century, but there remains a leaf-shaped harness ornament that is similar to the one found in Zápolya Street. At Déva, an important road junction in the Maros valley, a row of graves belonging to an armed, middle-class family was found, and objects were salvaged from seven of the graves. The grave of the highest-ranking man yielded a double-edged Carolingian sword that had been laid along his right arm; the same, or perhaps another grave contained an iron-belted quiver as well as diamond-shaped and forked arrowheads. The men's short fur coats had decorative buttons, while their womenfolk wore earrings, smooth hair rings, and plain rings, one bearing an incised pattern. The stirrups and bridles in this group of graves are probably the symbolic equivalent of burials with horse. There are reports of other finds of '10th-century graves with horses', notably at Piski.
A peculiar case is that of the burial ground of Maroskarna-Szőlőhegy. The partially-excavated cemetery 'B' is difficult to assess, for 11 of its 15 graves were found in a despoiled state. In some respects — layout, certain finds, the presence of a large stone used as a headrest — it resembles the Zápolya Street cemetery, but no horses were found in the excavated graves. Judging from the finds — a fragment of a sabre, iron quiver-straps, arrowheads, metal buttons, beads, a pair of silver earrings with grape-bunch pendants, and, last but not least, a Saltovo-type urn — the cemetery dates from {1-289.} the same period as the one in Zápolya Street. It may be surmised that the cemetery was used by a military contingent, charged in the period of the Hungarian settlement with supervising the Bulgars in the district. Their relative affluence (which later lured grave looters) probably owed to their military functions. The simpler objects yielded by the graves of less affluent relatives (bronze bracelets, rings, earrings) bridge the gap between the soldiers' graves and the 'archaeological civilization' of unarmed commoners' cemeteries. Judging from the bridle, torque, bracelets, and potsherds that are now in a museum, the cemetery at Maroscsapó must have been of a similar type.
Beyond the Királyhágó (Kings' Pass) and Sebes-Körös valley, at Krajnikfalva, four 10th-century stirrups were unearthed. They probably came from not two, but three graves, for three stirrups were of Norman-Carolingian type, with silver inlays. These may well be the traces of mounted soldiers who had been stationed there to guard the eastern approaches of the Bihar region.
There are sound reasons for believing that Biharvár, on the fringe of the Great Plain, was the 10th-century seat of a Hungarian prince. A modest earthwork on the site, dating from the Bronze Age, had been 'rebuilt' into a mighty fortress. Internal political necessities do not suffice to explain the design of these forts, which were built on high earthworks and surrounded by beam-reinforced earthen ramparts. The fact is that until the mid-900s, the Hungarians were under constant threat of Pecheneg attack. The latter, according to Constantine Porphyrogenetos, enjoyed an 'overwhelming superiority in power and numbers'; they threatened Bulgaria and were regarded with 'terror and fear' by the 'Turkic clan'. The Byzantine Emperor was well aware that the Hungarians would not dare to 'provoke' these 'wicked fellows'. To defend the Hungarians' gyepű (domain), mighty forts were raised at Szabolcsvár, Biharvár, and Marosvár, gateways to the Great Plain on the Tisza, Körös, and Maros rivers, and at Krassóvár in the {1-290.} Lower Danube gorge. The same sense of insecurity explains the network of fortifications of which only a few traces have been found so far — along the Eastern Carpathians.
With its perimeter forts, Biharvár spreads over four and a half hectares; the raised, central part measures 182 by 200 metres. Its earthwork ramparts are close to 10 metres wide and rise even today to a height of 9–12 metres. Although the conclusions that have been drawn from cross-section digs are somewhat confusing, it appears that

https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/53.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:27:11]
Biharvár was built up in several phases, and reached its present scale in the 11th century. In the final phase of construction, a stone wall was raised on the earthworks, as was also done at Dobokavár and Tordavár. Originally, Biharvár had only one gateway, on the southwest side. The gates at the northeast and southeast corners date from 1704, when Prince Rákóczi camped his troops on the site. Stone foundations dating from the 11th and 12th centuries evoke the buildings, and possibly a church, that were erected by contemporary princes and stewards. Below these, on level 'C', lie 10th-century traces, including some recently excavated huts.
The initial 'great' period of Biharvár (civitas Byhor, 1075) dates from the first half of the 10th century. The 'garrison's' cemetery, discovered on Somlyó Hill, across from the castle, dates from the same period and is almost without parallel in the archaeology of the Conquest. It consists of a single row of eight graves, aligned side by side on a west-east axis. In each grave, there was a harnessed horse hide placed at the feet of the deceased, and, to the right of the latter, iron-bound quivers holding 2, 4, or six arrowheads and arrows; one of the graves also yielded a war axe. The soldiers' chief is identified by his sabre and silver-studded belt, and the occupant of a neighbouring grave may also have held high rank, for he wore silver-studded boots and earrings with a gold pendant. The others' garb, as indicated by coat buttons, was plainer; their belts had iron buckles, and they carried a knife and firestarting tools in a leather pouch on their belt. The one woman in the group {1-291.} wore earrings with a beaded pendant and had been buried with a horse and a small stirrup; hers was the only grave that yielded a Saltovo-type pot for the ceremonial food. The number of arrowheads may indicate differences in rank, and the occupants of these graves were probably the commanders of larger and smaller units. Their relatives may have been buried farther along this row, or in another row of graves.
The lords of the castle are evoked by a double-edged Carolingian sword with an iron pommel (found, in 1862, in a grave that also contained a stirrup and dishes), as well as by a harness ornament bearing a rosette pattern. The lifestyle of the lower orders is represented by Slavic pots of the Szilágynagyfalu type and Hungarian, Saltovo-type pots and cauldrons. From the end of the 10th century, the people of the castle buried their dead nearby, on the site of a subsequently established brick factory; this is the largest commoners' cemetery to have been discovered east of the Tisza. The sections that have been excavated so far yielded evidence of the 'circulation of money', i.e. the placing in graves of funeral obuli; the earliest coins date from the time of Andrew I and Solomon, but most are contemporary with Ladislas I and Coloman. The coins testify that the cemetery remained in use through the reigns of Stephen II, Béla II, Géza II, and Béla III, up to the time of Andrew II; the most plausible explanation is that a church was erected on the site in the 11th century. Two finds, an intact dish and an early type of twisted torque, suggest that the origins of the 520-grave cemetery go back to the 10th century; more conclusive proof may be yielded by more extensive excavations and by a thorough assessment of the finds in the 506 graves excavated by Márton Roska. The fourteen, most recently excavated graves have been dated to around 1000.
Graves with horses have been found on the site of a Celtic cemetery at Köröstarján-Csordás Hill, not far from Biharvár; the very toponym, Tarján, evokes the name of a clan. The initial reports {1-292.} indicated that the 12 'Hungarian' graves held the remains of men, armed with sabres, and of women who wore earrings with silver, grape-bunch pendants.
There are, in the neighbourhood of Biharvár, several other cemeteries that had been used during the 10th–11th centuries by the castle's inhabitants and by common folk: at Biharszentandrás (where graves date up to the time of Ladislas I), Hegyközkovácsi (which yielded a contemporary bronze rattle), on Bálint Nagy's plot at Biharfélegyháza (twisted torques, bracelet with animal head, ring), at Biharszentjános-Klastrom Hill (obuli dating from Ladislas I, rings, beads), Hegyközszentimre (coin from Stephen I's time), Jankafalva (contemporary pots and a Majs-type, bronze pectoral cross), and, to the west, at Ártánd, where the cemetery included graves (with horses) of local notables.
An important, early Hungarian settlement was situated south of Biharvár, at (Nagy)Várad. Its old Hungarian name means 'place with a castle', but that does not prove there was a castle on the site before Ladislas I's time, since initially there would have been little need for another fortress so close to Biharvár. When, in the early 1890s, a hussar barrack was under construction on the southwestern periphery of Nagyvárad, between the Pece brook and the Arad road, numerous women's graves dating from the 10th century were uncovered; the finds in this commoners' cemetery included double silver pendants (worn as collar ornaments), seven twisted torques, numerous bracelets (smooth, apart from one with an animal head), a cast-silver earring with grape-bunch pendant,

https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/53.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:27:11]
and a Hungarian, Saltovo-type pot. The cemetery had remained in use until the beginning of the 11th century (hair clasps, with S-shaped tips, of an early type, and a half-moon shaped pendant, or 'lunula'). A more recent find is the 10th century cemetery that lies east of the subsequently-built castle, at the Szalka site, on the south bank of the Sebes-Körös River. The seven graves in the excavated section yielded a ring decorated with a carved bird figure, bronze earrings with grape-bunch pendants, and plain hair clasps.
{1-293.} Around 1091–93, an earthwork fortification — some 600 metres in circumference, and with a diameter of 150 metres — was constructed on a rise in the flood plain separating the Sebes-Körös and the Pece, between two 10th–11th century villages. Its purpose was to protect a nearby monastery that had been founded by Ladislas I. At the same time, Biharvár, which had been heavily damaged by the Cumanians in 1091, began to lose its importance. Soon thereafter, the parish's Holy Spirit church was erected on a site west of the castle ('Varadynum de Byhor', 1093); the location of its cemetery is indicated by the 12th century coins found in Nagyvásártér (Great Market Square). The transfer of the episcopal seat and the bishops' wealth and connections are all reflected in significant archaeological finds: the fragment of a procession cross or rood from the end of the 11th century, the earliest bronze-casting of this type from the Árpádian era; another fragment, from a 11th–12th century procession cross, crafted in Lorraine, and originally decorated with mountain crystals; and a 12th century altar cross from Limoges.
In the vicinity of Nagyvárad, commoners' graveyards have been uncovered at Peceszentmárton (metal button, bead) and at Mezőtelegd, where a cross was found, similar to the one at Jankafalva; in fact, such crosses have been found — in verified circumstances — in children's graves, dating from the 10th–11th century, located all over the country (e.g. at Majs). The twisted torque and other jewellery found at Nagyszalonta also date from this period.
Many 10th–11th century cemeteries, some only indicated by a jewel or two, have been discovered in the Érmellék and the Szilágy regions: Mezőfény (30 graves, yielding wire bracelets, both plain and with animal head decoration, hair clasps, both plain and ribbed, with S-shaped tips, twisted and flat rings); Iriny (rhombus-shaped arrowhead); Értarcsa (a variant of the earring with grape-bunch pendant); Kismajtény (12 graves); Szalacs-Várbót Hill (where {1-294.} Márton Roska excavated a commoners' cemetery, dating from the 10th–12 centuries); GálospetriMalomdomb (4 graves); Nagykároly-Bobáldi Hill (10th–11th century graves dug into a Bronze Age settlementmound, and also a churchyard cemetery); Érdengeleg; Érsemjén; Érmihályfalva (plain torques); Érkörtvélyes (plain torques, half-moon pendant); Mezőterem; Szilágypér; Szilágysomlyó (graves yielding a bronze bell and rings; and Zilah-Vártelek (31 graves, yielding hair clasps with S-shaped tips, iron knives). At Szalacs-Vida Hill, twelve graves were found dug on a west-east axis into a Bronze Age settlement-mound. One of them held a pair of 'Köttlach type', enamelled braid pendants, indicative of a Slovenian or Bavarian[?] woman, along with plain hair clasps and a ring); another woman's braids were held a row of clasps with S-shaped tips, while the skull of a man who had worn simple hair rings was trepanned. Pots were found in graves at Székelyhíd and, south of the FeketeKörös, at Kalácsa. The above grave finds are essentially similar to those, dating from the same period, in the neighbouring counties of Szabolcs, Szatmár, and Bihar.
A grave at Gálospetri is particularly noteworthy: it held a Saltovo-type pot, coat buttons, and filigreed, cast-bronze disks used as braid ornaments, all objects that denote the 10th-century burial of a wealthier Hungarian woman. One disk, bearing a horse figure entwined with tendrils — a helpful spirit — is of a type found in other Hungarian cemeteries, notably at Mándok and Sarkad; another disk bears a rare example of the Hungarians' palmettepatterned tree of life. Three other graves at Gálospetri held only a few hair rings; although one or more of them may have been plundered, they nevertheless testify to the social stratification that marks the Hungarian settlers' cemeteries.
The rich cemeteries found in the vicinity of Gyula may indicate that this was one of the early residences of the ruling gyulas. The three graves with horses at Muszka-Szőlődomb each yielded harnesses, one of which included an exceptionally fine stirrup and {1-295.} bridle, both with silver inlays (cf. Kolozsvár, Zápolya Street); jewels, mainly bracelets with animal heads decoration, were found in the graves of the family's women. The district's most important cemetery lies southeast of Gyula, at Sikló. Two of the twelve graves had a rolled-up horsehide placed on top of the corpse, and seven others contained harnesses; thus nine of the deceased (including several women) had been buried with a symbolic horse rite. The community's leader had been interred with his sabre, and the other armed men with a quiver holding 6–8 arrows. The gilded silver, rosette-patterned harness found in grave no. 1 indicates that these notables came from the higher reaches of the 'middle class'. What is more, the rich silver

https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/53.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:27:11]
ornaments of the women's dress, silver cloak buttons, and, particularly, the silver coins sewn on their clothes suggest that the remains are those of a prominent family whose members participated in the far-flung campaigns. The significance of the cemetery cannot be adequately measured, for three of the richest graves, including the one holding a sabre, had been despoiled back in the early Christian period, and another six or seven graves were subsequently destroyed.
A solidus (pierced, and thus once sewn on clothing) that dates from the time of the Byzantine emperor and founder of the Macedonian dynasty, Basil I (867–886), was found in a remote corner of the Fekete-Körös valley, at Felsőpojény. The similar coins found at Orsova and elsewhere suggest that it came from a rich burial in the period of Hungarian settlement.
Also worthy of attention is the cemetery that had been implanted on a Bronze Age settlement-mound at Gyulavarsánd-Laposhalom. It can be classed among the major cemeteries of commoners, along with those at Magyarhomorog, Békés-Povád, Tarhos-Városerdő, and Pécska-Nagysánc; all of the latter were also the sites of prehistoric settlements, and the last two have Bronze Age settlement-mounds. Such cemeteries came into use in the 10th century, and initially held free armed men (graves containing {1-296.} rolled-up horsehides, stirrups, bridles, bows, quivers and arrows) and their families (women's graves holding objects looted in the West in the first half of the 10th century, including gilt silver disks, silver costume ornaments, bracelets with animal heads, and coat buttons). The cemeteries remained in continuous use, by pagan and semi-Christianized Hungarians, from the time of Stephen I and Andrew I to that of Ladislas I.
The most important 10th-century settlement in the Maros region, between Transylvania and the Great Plain, was undoubtedly the one at 'Marosvár' (Civitas/Urbs Morisena, Moroswar). In the year 1000, this was the 'princely seat' of Ajtony, who rebelled against the central authority. An early Hungarian cemetery once stood at Sajtény, not far from Marosvár on the heights north of the Maros River. One grave, belonging to a man, still held the fittings of an ornamental belt that was similar, but simpler than the one found at Tarcal, along with a flat bracelet and a strapring. Two other graves had been totally plundered, while a third yielded only a Saltovo-type mug. The rest of the graves had been destroyed between 1925 and 1945.
In the Maros-Aranka region, cemeteries and graves that date from the period of the Hungarian settlement have been found at numerous locations. Arad-Csálya: at least three men's graves with horsehide and harness, a sabre with gilded pommel and silver-inlaid cross-bar, a double-edged sword, a ring studded with gems, and flat bracelets. Németszentpéter: a rich grave containing a harness with rosette-decoration, stirrup, bridle, short fur jacket with buttons, and, from a wealthy woman's grave, a pair of oriental earrings with beaded pendants. Németszentpéter-Roman earthworks: 10th–11th century graves, discovered in 1860. Fönlak: a grave with horse and stirrup, women's graves with jewels. Nagyteremia-Szőlőhegy: buttons and chain from short fur jacket, rectangular fittings from a wealthy woman's garment, pots. Nagyősz-Téglagyár: 10th–11th century graves containing hair clasps with S-shaped tips, {1-297.} rings, and (reportedly) from despoiled graves, rings, a spearhead, and a sword. Nagyősz-Kishalom: rich, 10th-century woman's grave containing a superb silver-gilt belt, a large, palmette-patterned strap tip, and a lyre-shaped buckle. A unique relic of this period is the pair of stirrups, with thin gold inlays, that was found in a grave (partly plundered?) with horse in Posta Street, Perjámos. Ópálos: a wealthy woman's grave, holding an earring with grape-bunch pendants, torques, bracelets. Kovászi/Kovaszinc: women's plaited bracelets, wire ring, and ribbed, strap ring. Graves belonging to the military classes were found at Nagykomlós-Posztszállás (graves with horses, holding horse bones, bridle, arrowheads, gold hair clasp), and at nearby Német-Komlós (grave with horse, with cast belt studding, strap tip, as well as rosette- and leaf-shaped fittings). The double-edged sword, with pommel, found south of the Maros at Keglevicháza, near Marosvár (Csanád), probably came from a grave. A similar 10th-century, Western sword was found in Zsombolya.
In the area encompassed by these rich graves, between the Maros and the Aranka, on the marshy plain of Nagyszentmiklós-Bukova, there are prehistoric and Roman settlement-mounds and burial mounds; almost without exception, they hold graves of armed and equestrian Hungarians. In the scholarly syntheses that draw on the original reports, these finds are generally — and erroneously — referred to as 'tumuli'. The tumulus-kurgan type of burial was characteristic of the Pechenegs, but it was not practised by the Hungarian settlers that they had persecuted. This explains why the 'tumuli' of Bukovapuszta came to be attributed to the Pechenegs, who were once held by scholars to be the allies, and later, the enemies of the Hungarians (the 'Pechenegs' of Ajtony, 'Glad', and so

on). What is more, certain types of grave-finds at Bukova, such as a pair of filigreed, braid-clasp discs — a typical hair-ornament of Hungarian female settlers — came to be regarded as 'ethnic identifiers' of the Pechenegs, simply because they were {1-298.} linked to the tumulus 'rite'. Thus by tracing the incidence of disks similar to those found at Bukova, some scholars imagined that the cemeteries of Hungarian settlers in the eastern part of the Great Plain were actually traces of a 'Pecheneg frontier zone' facing the Hungarians.
In fact, these places represented not ritualistic 'mound graves', but a burial custom practised throughout the floodprone Great Plain by Hungarian settlers in the 10th–11th century. In order to preserve the graves from periodic flooding, they buried their dead in prehistoric settlement-mounds (e.g. the previously noted cemeteries of Gyulavarsánd, Szalacs, Nagykároly, Nádudvar, and Hencida, as well as the finds, noted below, at PerjámosSánchalom and Hodony) or, more rarely, and particularly in the case of richer graves, in prehistoric kurgans (e.g. Zemplén). Some of the Bukovapuszta 'mounds' were low settlement-mounds dating from the Neolithic Körös culture. Into these — generally away from the centre, and above the actual settlement stratum — the Hungarians dug shallow, 40–100 cm. deep graves. Similarly, in the kurgans, the Hungarian graves were superimposed (to a depth of 40–80 cm.) over the earlier graves; wherever deeper excavations were conducted, traces of the original burial were found at the lower level of the kurgan.
Mound III at Bukovapuszta contained two graves with harnessed horsehide and iron-banded quivers holding 4 and 7 arrowheads. A similar grave was found in Mound II, along with the woman's grave that yielded the splendid, rosette-patterned harness and the pair of braid rings. Mound V had three graves, with harnessed horsehide but without weapons; one of them, found partially plundered, also contained the male occupant's metal-buttoned jacket and metal-studded belt. In 'settlement-mound' IV, at least two of the 18 graves included harnessed horsehides, and two others held harnesses, quivers, and arrowheads; most of the others, holding men as well as women, were of a simpler style. The man's {1-299.} grave in Mound I yielded a more ornate attire as well as a quiver with five arrowheads. Similarly, at Vizesd, the graves of two Hungarian settlers had been dug into a Sarmatian burial mound; the man's grave also held horse bones, while that of the women yielded torques and bracelets. The fine silver belt ornament and ribbed ring found in the Sánchalom at Perjámos also indicate an elaborate burial.
According to an incomplete report, the burial objects found in the early 1900s at (Magyar-)Pécska-Nagysánc include a set of double-pendant collar ornaments, coat buttons, a lyre-shaped bronze buckle, an earring with grapebunch pendant, twisted torques, plain and twisted bracelets, various rings, and glass as well as Cyprea beads; no details were published concerning a grave, with horse, that held stirrups as well as diamond and fork shaped arrowheads. As for the 140 graves, dating from the 10th–12th centuries, that were excavated at Nagysánc in the 1960s, the reports only indicate that they yielded wire earrings, hair clasps with S-shaped tips, rings, beads, and coins from the Árpádian era. A little to the west, at Nagylak, a hair clasp with S-shaped tip was found, and a 10th11th century twisted silver ring was unearthed farther east, on a site in present-day Arad. No details are available concerning the contents of the 10th–11th century graves uncovered east of Arad at Aradkövi (on the north bank of the Maros) and Szépfalu (on the south bank).
The Árpádian Aradvár (Urodvár, castrum Orod) is, in fact, one and the same as the long-known Földvár (Die Schanzen), located near Öthalom/Glogovác. The trapezoid earthwork rises gradually above the marshy ground to a height varying between 100 and 160 metres; its earthen ramparts are considerably eroded. Judging from the many earthenware cauldrons found on the site, the fort remained in use from the end of the 10th to the 13th century; most of the finds date from the 11th–12th centuries. At Aradvár, as in Abaújvár, Dobokavár, and Ó-Kolozsvár, a cemetery had been sited {1-300.} within the walls, probably next to the fort's church. The obulus coins found on the site date from the time of Peter, Andrew I, and Béla I all way to the 12th century, and they help to date the hair rings, twisted silver ring, and finds of jewellery. The cemetery of St. Márton's Church, some 500 metres from ÓAradvár, is dated by coins from the time of Stephen III (1162–1172).
The gorge where the Maros exits from the mountains into the Great Plain was defended by an earthwork that had been raised, in the 11th–12th century, on the north side, above a brook that bears the Slavic name Kalodva/Kladova. The graves that were excavated near the earthwork held hair rings, plain as well as with thick, S-shaped tips, and dating from the time of Coloman and Stephen II (1116–1131) to that of Ladislas IV. These objects probably came from a churchyard cemetery, and the earthwork itself probably dates back no farther than end of the 11th century.

In the Temes region, the site where now stands the city of Temesvár probably served as a major centre of settlement for Hungarians as early as the 10th century. East of the present city, the burial ground of a large family was discovered in the Csóka Forest, near the onetime village of Csókafalu; it closely resembles the Somlyóhegy cemetery. Half of the graves held men's remains, along with iron-banded quivers holding 5–7 arrowheads, jacket buttons, and, in some cases, harnesses, stirrups, and bridles. Their wives and children were buried with 10thcentury jewels (bracelets, some featuring animal heads, and torques). Another Hungarian cemetery was found implanted in a Neolithic settlement-mound at Hodony, northwest of Temesvár; it consists (so far) of eleven graves, in two parallel rows, belonging to a family clan of modest means. The funerary obuli, coins marked STEPHANUS REX, indicate that the cemetery dates from around 1000, and so do the other grave goods: a pair of stirrups and bridles (the symbolic version of a horse burial), metal buttons, and plain hair rings. There are other finds in Temesvár's neighbourhood that reinforce the conclusion {1-301.} this was a centre of Hungarian settlement. To the north, at Hidasliget, a commoners' cemetery holds some 25–30 graves, which yielded hair rings and a coin from the time of Andrew I. To the west, at Szakálház, graves yielded a bridle and two different stirrups. To the south, in Temesliget, the graves in a 10th–11th century cemetery contained torques, coat buttons, hair rings, a ring, and a coin from the time of Andrew I. To the east, at Temesremete, intact 10th-century pots marked the site of an early Hungarian settlement.
In Temesvár itself, the evidence of early Hungarian settlement — apart from the bronze coin from the time of Constantine Porphyrogenetos VII (912–959) — comes from some 11th-century grave objects (a hair ring, found in 1898 on the bank of the Béga, and coins dating from Andrew I's time) and some items unearthed in the inner city in 1910–13: a 10th-century earring, an early Árpádian bronze cross, a bronze ring decorated with a 12th–13th century double cross, and a copper coin from the time of Béla III.
Farther south in the Temes region, an outstanding find of early grave objects was made in 1882 at Detta-Újtemető (1882): a man's silver belt studs and fur-jacket buttons; a bronze coin, found in the mouth of a corpse, dating from the time of Leo VI (the Wise; 886–912); the rich jewels of a woman wearing Slavic-Hungarian attire, including a two-piece pendant from a deep-cut collar, a cast-bronze pendant earring, a braid pendant with inlaid enamel, a small disk fibula with colourful enamel inlays, and a similar but larger one that is a masterpiece of south German or Rhenish craftsmanship and must have come from the Carolingians' or Otto's empire; and the hair ring and finger ring of a more simply dressed woman. The same site yielded a splendid 10th–11th century gold ring with a gem in a wire setting. There is less information about a number of other finds, either because no reports were published, or because they were lost, or, finally, because their size and location do not allow for conclusive assessment. This is the case with the sites at {1-302.} Germán (Ermény)-Roman earthworks (eleven graves, yielding twisted torques, bracelets, and plain hair rings), Csákova (rhombus-shaped arrowheads, wire bracelets, and ring), Vrány, Illyéd (earring with beaded pendant, bracelet), and Mehádia (ten simple graves containing dishes, knives, grave no. 7 being dated by an Stephen I coin found in the deceased's mouth); and also with the commoners' cemetery at Ómoldova (twisted torques, bronze bracelets, bracelets made of glass and probably of Danubian-Bulgar origin, a 10th-century lead cross, rings, arrowheads, and coins up to the time of Ladislas I). At the very least, all these finds indicate that the settlements and distinctive culture of 10th–11th century Hungarians reached all the way to the Lower Danube.
At Orsova, the region's southern gateway, several important finds testify that in the 10th century, the Hungarians' borderlands lay on the Lower Danube: a fine, 10th-century Hungarian grave contained 28 silver costume ornaments, jacket buttons, earrings, and 14 pierced, Italian coins that were once sewn garments; and, on another site, three exquisitely-worked silver belt ornaments and a buckle, which were dated by a Carolingian coin from Milan — a denarius from the time of Louis III. A double-edged sword that was found in the Danube is also of Western origin. The Hungarian occupation of the Orsova gateway is dated by a number of coins: a solidus from the time of Leo VI, another solidus of Romanos Lakapenos I, minted between 921 and 931, and a gold coin issued jointly by Nicephorus Phocas II and Basil II in 963. The Hungarians brought back many Byzantine coins from their military campaigns. Two remarkable bronze coins, pierced for use as costume ornaments, have been found at Lovrin, in the northern part of the Temes region; they dated back to the time of Romanos I and Constantine Porphyrogenetos VII. Another solidus, found at Kisgáj, in the southern part of the district, is from the era of Constantine VII, Romanos II (959–963), and Nicephorus Phocas II (963–969).

Orsova, probably on the site of a onetime church graveyard, that date from the time of Coloman and Béla II. Objects used by commoners in the 11th–12th centuries — silver earrings, hair rings with S-shaped tips, rattles, buttons, and bracelets have been unearthed in the 42 graves of cemetery no. 4 at Felsőlupkó (Gornya), as well as in the graves of Alsópozsgás.
A commoners' cemetery, excavated in a gravel pit at Zimándújfalu-Földvári-puszta, northeast of Arad, provides evidence that even in the Maros region, people were not dramatically disturbed by their leaders' internecine struggles for power. Judging from the finds, the cemetery was opened in the 10th century (pendants, costume decorations, metal buttons, torques, bracelets with animal heads, plain hair rings, cross and half-moon shaped pendants worn on a necklace) and remained in constant use until the age of Ladislas I.

The Gyulas in Alliance with Byzantium 2. FROM THE HUNGARIAN CONQUEST TO THE
MONGOL INVASION Royal Counties in Transylvania
White and Black Hungarians
The competition between the Greek Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church was intensified by the conflict of interest between the Byzantine and Holy Roman empires both in Italy and along the Danube. Having swallowed up most of the independent Bulgar state, the Byzantines reached the Danube and could now strike at Italy from the northeast, a prospect that alarmed the fledgling Germanic Roman Empire. Stephen, who became Hungary's ruling prince after Géza's death in 997, and was the Bulgar czar's brother-in-law, must have feared that the Byzantines and Transylvania's gyula might launch a joint attack or otherwise help his domestic opponents to depose him. The same external circumstances probably played a part in Koppány's rebellion and his plan to marry the widowed Sarolt. The pagan Koppány was count of Somogy, but he maintained in Transylvania two residences that bore his name, (Magyar)koppánd and (Maros)koppánd, situated near the salt-mines at Újakna and Kisakna, respectively; it is likely that these places, being under the gyula's protection, were meant to serve as a refuge in case Koppány was attacked by Stephen.
In the event, Stephen crushed the rebellion and had Koppány quartered, then sent part of the corpse to the gyula a grisly warning that he considered himself the supreme ruler of the gyula's land as well. This claim was confirmed when Stephen had himself crowned in the year 1000 as 'king of the Hungarians'. Soon after 1003, he dispatched Latin-rite evangelizers to Transylvania. Bruno of Querfurt and Adhemar both attest that these missionaries regarded {1-399.} Transylvania as a politically-separate region; they called Transylvania the land of the 'black Hungarians' in order to distinguish it from the country of 'white Hungarians' ruled by Stephen. Historians generally agree that the 'black Hungarians'' land lay eastward, between the Maros, Tisza, and Danube, a region that at the time was governed by Ajtony; but the term probably refers to all the people who lived under the gyulas' rule. Some historians have attributed an ethnic significance to the terms and concluded that 'black' designated the Kabars, who at the time could still be physically distinguished from the Hungarians. However, this supposition is ill-founded. The Kabars (particularly if that appellation is extended to the Székelys as well) were found not only in the gyulas' domain but also in areas under the direct rule of the prince, in Transdanubia, Bihar, and along the Nyitra River. Thus the information, cited by Bruno of Querfurt, that they were baptized in the Roman religion in 1008, cannot be correct, for these baptisms occurred mostly during Géza's reign and must have been completed by the year 1000. Since it was a custom among Turkic peoples to use the adjectives 'white' and 'black' in reference to levels of politico-military hierarchy, essentially to distinguish the rulers from the ruled, the most likely explanation is that in the context of Stephen's Hungary, 'black' referred to the part of the population that was yet to be 'subjected' to the king.
Hungarian legends and chronicles, and foreign sources all agree: the subjection of the 'black' Hungarians to Stephen's rule was accomplished in two or more stages. First came the occupation of Transylvania and the abolition of title of gyula; in the next stage, the region ruled by Ajtony was fully incorporated into the Hungarian kingdom. However, there are grounds for believing that there was a preliminary stage, in which northern Transylvania, home of the five clans of original settlers, voluntarily adhered to the kingdom. This follows from the fact, noted earlier, that the five clans were allowed to retain one third of their estates when the {1-400.} countystructure was imposed. A similar policy was followed in other parts of Hungary, notably in Komárom county: where the proposed county coincided with a clan's estate, and if the clan voluntarily transferred its central castle and two thirds of the land to the king, then one third of the land was granted in perpetuity to the clan's chief. There is one clear example of this procedure in Transylvania, involving Doboka county, which originally belonged to the Zsombor clan; the clan retained one third of the estate, while the remaining two thirds — including Doboka castle — became the royal county. As was noted earlier, there is ample evidence to indicate that the estates of the Mikola, Borsa, and Agmánd clans were divided in similar fashion. This pattern distinguishes northern Transylvania from the region south of the Maros; only north of that river can one find toponyms that evoke the tribal names of warriors who, in the latter third of the 10th century, broke away from an already disintegrating tribal structure and put themselves in the service of the king — thus Jenő in Doboka county, Keszi in Kolozs county, and Megyer on

the right bank of the Maros River.
The name of Doboka county bears other implications. According to the legend recorded by Anonymus, the repression of Ajtony's rebellion was led by Csanád, son of Doboka and nephew of King St. Stephen. Since Doboka's ancestry cannot be traced to the Árpád family, he could only have been related to King St. Stephen on his mother's side. It was suggested earlier that Doboka had taken as wife Karold, who was Sarolt's sister and King St. Stephen's aunt. Apart from the fact that there is no obvious, alternative explanation, this hypothesis is reinforced by toponymic evidence that Doboka was related to both Árpád's descendants and to the Transylvanian gyulas. According to documents dating from the Middle Ages, he gave his name not only to the castle at Doboka, but also to two localities in Baranya county (where the Árpád family prevailed), one situated between the Drava and Sava rivers (an area ruled by the gyulas), one on the left bank of the Tisza (on the {1-401.} salt-route, near Pátroha), and to another (called Datk today) by the Olt bend, in the border-guard region. Since the castle raised on the home territory of the leading, Zsombor clan bears his name, it can be concluded that at the turn of the 11th century, Doboka must have been the most prominent member of the original clans. And since the castle-seats of royal counties were commonly named after the first count, Doboka must have been leader of the clans, or tribe that voluntarily submitted to the rule of King St. Stephen.
After these preliminaries, the gyula's domain was reduced to the lands lying south of the Maros, and his only hope lay in his Byzantine allies, who were making steady progress against the Bulgars. When Vidin fell to the Byzantines in 1002, a military showdown between Stephen and the gyula became unavoidable. Stephen made the first move, while the Byzantines were still recovering from the bloody war they had waged against the Bulgars. According to the Altaich Annals, he launched his attack on the gyula, in 1003, from northern Transylvania, which by then was part of his domain. Unable to put up effective resistance, the gyula surrendered. Stephen took him and his family into captivity, and, since his priests considered them 'pagans', he had them baptized.
There is no record of this gyula's name. In the 13th-century version of the 'Old Gesta', he is referred to as 'the third'; in Anonymus' chronicle, as the 'younger'; and, in the Altaich Annals of 1003, he is mentioned only by his title: 'The Hungarian King (rex) Stephen came with an army to attack his uncle King (rex) Julus, took the latter, as well as the latter's wife and sons into captivity, and imposed Christianity on (the gyula's) country (regnum).'[6] This story was embellished in the chronicles that Anonymus drew upon — or perhaps by Anonymus himself — to turn Stephen's campaign into a crusade against the pagan Gyula, their assumption being that the latter owed his lifelong incarceration to an unwillingness to renounce paganism. However, according to the expanded, 13th-century version of the 'Old Gesta', Stephen forced {1-402.} Gyula to take baptism, and thereafter treated him with respect. In any event, Anonymus records that the gyula's sons, whom he calls Buja and Bonyha, were considered part of the Hungarian elite until their death in 1045.
A contemporary source, Thietmar, Bishop of Merseburg, offers some additional details that came from the Hungarian royal court. He recorded that 'Prokuj Senior was the uncle (avunculus) of the king of Pannonia, who had once before — like this time — expelled him from his seats. Although Prokuj was not able to redeem his captive wife, his nephew — despite the fact that they were enemies — graciously gave her back to him as a present.'[7] Thietmar's reference to the gyula's two 'dethronements' finds support in the expanded, 14th-century version of the Gellért legend. The source indicates that King St. Stephen appointed Csanád commander, and Gyula deputy commander of the forces sent to put down Ajtony's rebellion in 1008. Csanád killed Ajtony and cut out his tongue, keeping it as proof of his victory; unaware of this act, Gyula presented Ajtony's head to the king, claiming it was he who had done the heroic deed. When the truth became known, Gyula was 'cast out' from the royal court. It appears from this account that after being expelled for the first time from Transylvania, Gyula entered the king's service and got back his wife (and probably his sons as well) without having to pay ransom; then, because of his misdemeanour during the campaign against Ajtony, he was expelled a second time. Thietmar, for his part, relates that Prokuj took refuge with one of Stephen's enemies, the Polish King Boleslaw the Brave, who put him in charge of a castle near the Hungarian border. This castle was subsequently taken by Stephen, but there is no further trace of the gyula Prokuj.
Thus the last gyula was called Prokuj, a compound of the Slavic words 'prok', meaning 'remainder', and 'uj' meaning 'uncle' (presumably in reference to Stephen). His name may be at the root of two toponyms (with Hungarian diminutive suffixes), the {1-403.} villages of Parajd and Pród, on the Küküllő River; localities named after

his sister Sarolt and his sons, Buja and Bonyhád, are found nearby. The Slavic origin of Prokuj's name should cause no surprise: there were other Hungarian given names of Slavic derivation, such as Bogát (Slavic meaning 'rich') and Zombor/Zsombor (meaning 'bison'), the gyula's subjects commonly applied to him the Slavic title vojevoda ('commander'), which inspired the Transylvanian title voivode of later date. The names of Zombor's daughters also point to a Slavic environment and to the multilingual habits of the gyulas' families: Sarolt and Karold, Bulgaro-Turkish names signifying 'white lady' and 'black lady', were common in high-ranking Hungarian families. The word hölgy (Hungarian for 'lady') also means 'weasel' (cf. the toponym Hőgyész = hölgyész, meaning 'weasel-hunter'). Both words are of Finno-Ugric origin, and, as early as the Ugrian period, the second one had given rise to menyasszony, meaning 'bride' — perhaps because (according to Muslim sources dating from before the Hungarian conquest) Hungarians once paid for their brides in weasel-skins. The fact that Slavic, BulgaroTurkish and (Finno-Ugric) Hungarian were all spoken at Zombor's court in Gyulafehérvár is shown by the alternative version of Sarolt's name cited in Thietmar's account: Beleknegini. Thietmar translated her name as 'beautiful woman' (pulchra domina), which indicates he was aware that the Bulgaro-Turkish word aldi ('weasel', in Hungarian menyét) also signified bride in the Finno-Ugric-Hungarian menyasszony (or it might have been translated to him simply as 'lady' or 'woman'); and he translates the Bulgaro-Turkish sar, meaning 'white', with the Slavic word bele. One of Prokuj's sons had a Slavic name, Buja ('daring'), while the other bore a Bulgaro-Turkish name, Bonyha ('little bull'; cf. the grandfather's name, Zombor = 'bison'!). The name Doboka also appears to be of Slavic origin, the word dob ('oak') being complemented by a Hungarian diminutive suffix — not an uncommon practice in Hungarian names. (Szil, the name of one the branches of the {1-404.} Kalocsa clan, also comes from a proper name.) If this interpretation of Doboka's linguistic origin is correct, then the name must have been given after the disappearance of the Slavic nasal in the 10th century, otherwise it would have probably taken the form domb(ka).
Doboka's attitude towards the efforts of King St. Stephen to unite the country diverged sharply from that of the gyula Prokuj, but it is clear that even north of the Maros, many disagreed with him. So did his son Csanád, who, judging from toponyms (Szászcsanád and Erdőcsanád) that evoke his name (or descendants with the same name), actually lived south of the Maros, in the gyula's domain, where he had links through his mother, Karold. According to the longer version of the Gellért legend, Csanád at first rallied to Stephen's enemy, Ajtony. Historians have generally concluded that Ajtony sided with the gyulas; there is even a village near Kolozsvár that bears his name. There are grounds for believing that after the capture of the gyula Prokuj, it was Ajtony who preserved the family's rule outside Transylvania, along the lower reaches of the Maros, and, with the help of the Byzantines, continued to oppose Stephen. Some time after 1002, he had himself baptized in the Greek Orthodox faith at the Byzantine town of Vidin, and he even founded an Orthodox monastery near his seat at Marosvár (today's Csanád). In or around 1008, the king directed the gyula Prokuj, now a loyal subject, to lead an attack on Ajtony; the gyula was joined by Csanád, who had betrayed Ajtony and fled to the royal court.
Byzantine help did not materialize, and the combination of royal armed might and internal betrayal led to the defeat of Ajtony, who paid with his life for having stubbornly defended an outdated cause, the autonomy of the gyulas. Stephen pardoned his family, and they were even allowed to retain part of their estates in Csanád county, in the same district where Ajtonymonostora was later to rise on the banks of the Maros. Csanád and Prokuj vied for the victor's {1-405.} laurels, but it was the former who won the king's favour, and he was appointed count of the county that was established on Ajtony's lands, and which bears his name. Anonymus, who knew about Stephen's campaign against Ajtony, made no mention of Gyula's participation, but he recorded this outcome. In chapter 11 of his chronicle, he relates that at the time of the Hungarian conquest, the region stretching from the Maros to the Danube (at Orsova) was ruled by Glad, who had come from Vidin (evidently Anonymus believed he was a Bulgar) and benefited from the aid of the Cumanians. Anonymus adds that 'one of his descendants was Ajtony, who, much later, in the time of King St. Stephen, was killed in his castle on the Maros River by Csanád, son of Doboka, nephew of the king, for he had been in every respect an opponent of the said king. The king rewarded Csanád for his loyal service by giving him a wife, as well as Ajtony's castle and all its dependencies... This castle still bears the name of Csanád.' Anonymus' story of Ajtony and Csanád could not have been based on the ancient tales recorded in the expanded Gellért legend, for it contains no reference to Gyula and diverges in other important matters of detail. For example, in the legend, Ajtony falls in battle, whereas in Anonymus' chronicle he is killed in his castle by Csanád. According to the legend, Csanád was originally pagan and a follower of Ajtony, but when the latter slanders him, he seeks refuge at the court of King St. Stephen, who has him baptized and sends him against

Ajtony in the company of Gyula (who was, perhaps, to keep an eye on Ajtony). All this is missing from Anonymus' chronicle, where it is simply noted that Csanád was Doboka's son and a nephew of St. Stephen.
Bruno of Querfurt recorded in 1008 that the 'black Hungarians' had been driven by force of arms to convert to the Roman faith. The Southern Carpathians and the Danube became the border between a Hungary unified by King St. Stephen and the Byzantine empire. The whole of Transylvania was now under the rule of the Hungarian king.

TRANSYLVANIA Christianity and Germanic Religious Beliefs
Visigothic Society
For a hundred years, the great gold find at Pietroasa was held to be 'Athanaric's treasure' and dated from the 4th century, and this despite a Gothic necklace (torque) bearing runic characters. When researchers began to question this conclusion, and when it was established that the treasure of Szilágysomlyó, buried far beyond the borders of Gutthiuda, could not have been hidden by Visigoths planning to leave their country, the treasures of the Tervingi kings and their badges of authority mysteriously 'disappeared'.
There is evidence that after the conquest of Dacia, and until 376, the Visigoths had a dual — partly parallel, partly entwined — {1-161.} social structure. According to a still prevailing conception, until the autumn of 376 the Tervingi lived in a 'tribal confederation' and had settled down grouped into 'tribes'. In reality, the notion of 'tribe' (thiuda) had always signified political unity, even if initially it also implied a certain consciousness of a common descent; and by the 3rd–4th centuries, it had come to denote the entire Tervingi community, i.e., the Visigothic people and their country. Instead of 'tribes' and 'chieftains', there was a central source of power (thiudanassus) headed by a single thiudans. In Vulfila's translation, the equivalent of the Greek 'basileos' is the thiudans, and certainly not in the sense of a 'head of the tribal confederation'.
In the 3rd and 4th centuries, the Visigoths were divided into 'kindreds' and clans (kunja = phylapagi) and settled in accordance with this division, each clan occupying an independent territory (garvi). By this time, the several clans (as is shown by their Latin designation) had at best a rather illusory sense of their distinctive origin; this is reflected in the fact that the clan (kuni) was led not by a 'kuning' — a term that denoted the leader of a consanguine community and which no longer appeared in Vulfila's Gothic — but by the kindins (meaning dux, archon, and applied by the Goths to Roman proconsuls), which denoted a relative of high rank. By the 3rd century, military campaigns were led by kindins. The 'clans', which actually denoted territorial units (garvi), consisted of associated great families (sibja). A century later, few of the latter represented consanguine communities or armed groups (siponjos); in the main, the term designated village communities with a stratified social structure. However, it was impossible to live outside the sibja; unsibja, a word obtained by adding a privative prefix, means 'outcast' or 'godless'. Thus the sibi was a solid political, economic and cultic unit, and one which imposed membership even on those who were not related to it by blood. Generally, each village (haims) was occupied by a single sibi. Its members, the inhabitants of the village, belonged to patriarchal families (fadreins); large and {1-162.} wealthy families exercised joint ownership over the land surrounding the villages (haimothlis). The status of outsiders or 'guests' (gasteis) is not clear.
The village communities preserved (or rather tried to preserve) the old clan institutions. Occasionally, the council (gamainths), in which 'the elders' (sinistans) played a leading role, and the other villagers would convene in the village's meeting ground or market place (garuns). However, as revealed in the Passio S. Sabae, in the 4th century the most that sinistans could aspire to was to 'outwit' the real authorities; in other word, they exercised only nominal authority.
The hoary institutions of the original tribal-clan society were doomed to disappear. After the conquest of Dacia, the traditional people's assembly (mathl, fauramathleins), which drew together the freemen (frijai) of the major territorial units, gradually became inoperative. After 376, the institution suffered a speedy and terminal decline, and within a few years its place was taken by the 'great council' (gafaurds).
From the 2nd–3rd centuries onwards, actual power was in the hands of the Visigoths' warlords and their military retinue. Reiks, the term designating a military commander (Greek: 'basilikos', Latin: 'regulus') frequently appears in compound names (Aoric, Ariaric, Geberic, Munderic) as early as the 3rd century; it also appears, somewhat vaguely, in contemporary Roman sources in the sense of rex. Initially, the term probably denoted the military rank of great and powerful clan leaders; in this sense, the reiks could also be a kindins, and vice versa. This military title figures in the name of Athanaric/Athanarik, the Visigoths' most powerful king in the 4th century. He was the only

one to be distinguished by the Romans of his time with the title of iudex (judge), although, in 4th century Latin, the latter term had come to signify governor or viceroy as well (Historia Augusta!); and in one instance, he was identified as 'iudex potentissimus', meaning the thiudans who stood above all the other reiks. Athanaric was evidently the thiudans; in 369, he {1-163.} was the only Tervingi to parlay on equal terms with Emperor Valens. Winguric, one of the church-burners in the anti-Christian campaign ordered by Athanaric, was only a lieutenant of the thiudans, as was Munderic, the commander of Athanaric's vanguard.
The title of reiks survived in the names of some of Athanaric's successors, who after 376 held together the Visigothic warrior groups (Alaric I and II, Theoderic I and II, Amalaric), but it disappeared completely in the second half of the 6th century. By the 4th century, however, the presence of reiks in compound names did not necessarily mean a king or a warlord; Frithareikeis (= Fridarik), martyred in Athanaric's anti-Christian campaign, was at best the descendant of a noble family.
The reiks (or several reiks together) drew his support from the class of the optimates or megistanes, and was himself a member of this class. The Greek term megistanes (= 'great, powerful men') corresponds perfectly with the Gothic mahteigs (= 'powerful, mighty', and also 'aggressive'; cf. mahts = 'power', 'might') and maistans (= 'great people'). Members of this class were already landowners in the 3rd–4th centuries. A member's domain consisted of a manor house (gards, which also indicated the surrounding land) as well as landed property (aihts) and livestock (faihu; those who owned livestock were called faihu habands, meaning 'the rich'). The landowner was master (frauja = despotes) of those attached to the manor house and imposed his rule with the aid of his private armed retinue (andbahts = 'steward'). The armed detachments of the Visigothic landed gentry and those of the one or several reiks made up the Visigothic army (harjis) and its smaller detachments (hansa); by the 4th century, this army consisted mostly of 'professional' soldiers (gadrauhts = miles; drunhtinonds = warrior). Their principal weapons were swords (meki) and shields (skildus), but they also used armor (brunjo) and helmets (hilms).
In the 4th century the territorial clan organizations, on the one hand, and the military power structure, on the other, were still joined by many links; the kindins, the reiks and the thiudans could {1-164.} be one and the same person (e.g. Athanaric), although this was more the exception than the rule. But the reality was far from harmonious. In the story of the martyr Saba, the background is one of the conflicts between the 'central' armed authority and the clans' 'local' autonomy.
By the 4th century the 'free' (freis) Visigothic society had become markedly stratified. The larger social classes were those of the free peasants (waurstwja) and of the paupers (unleths); they were probably joined by the liberated slaves (fralets). The wage labourers (asneins = 'hired harvesters') on the aigin (domanial) lands presumably came from these classes.
The servants' class was complex. Prisoners of war (bandja) became either 'trading goods' or enslaved servants (skalks) and farm labourers (thewisa). The manservants (thius) and maids (thivi) who worked in households may have enjoyed slightly better living conditions.
So far, it has proven virtually impossible to establish links between archaeological finds and the complicated social structure in which the old clan traditions mingle with incipient forms of centralized authority and military power. The 4th century gold torque found between Szászbuda and Szászfehéregyháza must have been a badge worn by one of the dignitaries known as megistanes/optimates. The splendid, jewelled gold fibula dating from the 4th century — a unique masterpiece from the world of the Visigoths that was found in Transylvania and became part of the Jankovich Collection — must have been worn by an aristocratic Gothic woman. A Gothic noblewoman's small fibula of pure gold, unearthed at Felsőpián (formerly Oláh-Pián), is of somewhat older vintage; it remains the sole Transylvanian example of the craftsmanship that flourished around 300 on the East Germanic 'grave horizon' (Osztrópataka, Céke, etc.). The silver jewellery found at Tekerőpatak-Kápolnaoldal surpasses the richest trove in the burial grounds that have been uncovered so far, and must have belonged {1-165.} to a woman socially superior to the common people found in most graves. The jewels — a fibula with semi-disc shaped plate, buckles, bracelets, rings, and crescent-shaped pendants that are replicas of a Roman original — are of the same shape and type as those found in graves of the richest women, and thus confirm that the owner had been a notable of the clan. The difference is that her jewels are heavy castings of fine silver, and that she also possessed 'wealth in coin'. An apparently similar hoard of gold and silver jewellery was reported to have been found at Borszék-Hollóvölgy, but it has disappeared.

The social stratification of the burial grounds is analogous to that of the village of the Gothic martyr, Saba. In a community of 50 to 100 people, there were four or five wealthy couples, an elite that probably played a leading role in the village council. The majority of villagers consisted of the families of common peasants, roughly equal in rank and wealth. The paupers (of whom Saba was one) were distinguished from slaves only by their legal status; their graves differ from those of the slaves in that their inhumation was accompanied by funeral rites. Although the slaves were buried in the village graveyard — which undoubtedly indicates a degree of patriarchalism — their inhumation lacked any ceremony. Deceased slaves were summarily interred by their surviving fellows.

The Gepids before Hun Rule
The Victovals, the first Eastern Germanic tribe to settle in the region, reached the Szamos valley, on the northwestern border of Dacia Porolissensis, in 168. After clashing with their cousins the Vandals, the Victovals settled down as Rome's external allies in the valleys of the Lower Szamos and the Upper Tisza, where they left archaeological traces. These finds are without exception cremation graves with weapons. (They are not to be confused with similar graves of the Vandals' Hasding dynasty, which were found on the eastern bank of the Tisza bend as well as in the valleys of the rivers Bodrog, Hernád, Sajó, and Tarna!). The Victovals' graves lie in a swath beginning near the Tisza in Szabolcs county (Tiszakanyár, Kékcse) and continuing along the Kisvárda-RakamazNagyvarsány-Vásárosnamény line in the region of the Szamos River (Aranyosmedgyes, Apa, BujánházaBélakirályvár); none are closer than eight Roman miles to Dacia's border. The graves have certain common features: a bossed shield with an iron handle covers the pit, which holds, along with the ashes, a spear, a halberd, or more rarely a bent sword, and (almost invariably) bronze or iron spurs {1-173.} that testify to mounted combat. The graves all fall within a period from the end of the 2nd century to the end of the 3rd century.
The cause of that sudden halt in Victoval burials was the arrival of another great Eastern Germanic people: the Gepids. In 269, for the first and the last time, the Roman empire had came under the joint attack of two Eastern Germanic peoples, the linguistically linked Goths and Gepids; the first written mention of the latter dates from this event. The only information concerning the origins of the Gepids comes from malicious and convoluted Gothic legends; between the 1st and the 3rd centuries they must have been the Goths' neighbours around the Vistula River. The Goths occupied Dacia ahead of them, and for a time the Gepids found themselves trapped among the Sarmatians, who maintained their dominance over the northeastern Carpathians (Sub-Carpathia, Tiszahát, Máramaros) and the northern part of the Hungarian Plain. King Fastida — the first Gepidic leader whose name survives — wished to extricate his people from this land 'enclosed by grim mountains and dense forests' ('inclusum se montium queritans asperitate silvarumque densitate constrictum'[8]), and urged the Visigothic King Ostrogotha to peacefully share his domain. The ensuing hostilities probably owed more to the manipulation of Diocletian's coemperor, Maximianus, who persuaded Fastida, as leader of the Gepids and the Vandals, to attack the Visigoths. The war, as noted earlier, took place before 290; the main battle, as confirmed by the Goths, was cut short when darkness fell, and thus ended somewhat indecisively, whereupon Fastida chose to withdraw his troops to their starting point. Maximianus's crafty tactic of inciting conflict among the Danubian Germans is evoked in an official speech written in 291 as well as by two gold coins, minted under his reign, which had been given to Fastida and are the oldest part of the treasure discovered at Szilágysomlyó.
Following their withdrawal, the Gepids had no option but to expand southward, toward the Hungarian Plain. More and more of {1-174.} their burial sites are being discovered north-northeast beyond the Sarmatians' great earthwork; the graves, which hold skeletons, reveal rituals and goods different from those of the preceding Victoval period. The Gepids' graves commonly contain weapons (spears, swords, shields with iron boss) that distinguish them from those of their Gothic cousins. On the other hand, their bronze and silver clasps, bone combs with rounded handles, and fibulae, sheathed in silver and with downward curved pins, resemble those of the Marosszentanna culture.
In the middle third of the 4th century, this Gepidic population, which by then had absorbed the Victovals, advanced along the strip of land between the Sarmatic rampart, the Meszes mountains, and the Erzgebirge into the valleys of the rivers Kraszna and Ér, then crossed the branches of the Körös and reached the Maros River. There is clear archaeological evidence of their new settlements at (from north to south) Lázári and Nagykolcs (the latter site being dated by a 4th-century silver fibula); Genyéte, where intact vessels, some {1-175.} with stamped decoration, were found, probably originating in graves; Mezőfény and Domahida (graves containing skeletons); ÉrdengelegÉrvölgy-sziget (a grave holding a skeleton on a north-south axis as well as plates, jars, and bone combs with rounded back); Ártánd-Nagyfarkasdomb and Ártánd-Kisfarkasdomb (burial grounds); Érkörtvélyes-Ligetdomb and, in Hajdú-Bihar county, Csökmő (graves holding iron shield bosses and spears); Bihar (a 4th-century bone comb with triangular handle, originating from a settlement or a grave); Nagyvárad-Szalkaterasz-Pece riverbank (a



The Gepids before Hun Rule
https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/31.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:27:46]
settlement, and a burial ground that remained in use in the Hun period); and Köröstarján-Csordásdomb (burial ground). These sites are dated by a solidus, minted under Honorius (395–424), and found at Székelyhíd. The sites further south include Rippa (an intact bone comb with rounded back and circular punched ornaments, probably from a grave); Muszka-Szászkút (graves, connected to a 4th-century site, containing pottery of the Beregsurány type with stamped decoration); Arad-Földvár and Szentanna (combs with rounded back, pottery of the Marosszentanna type with Sarmatic influences); and, finally, Kisiratos-Kistó, the Körös riverbank at Borosjenő, and Zimándújfalu (intact vessels, mainly jugs, originating in graves).
The Gepids' early history is known only from archaeological sources, but it can be inferred from the latter that these people played at least a supporting role in the political events of the Carpathian Basin. In 332, for instance, they must have participated in the ongoing wars; they attacked their longtime enemies, the Visigoths, from the rear, either along the Maros at Arad or from the direction of the Szamos and Kraszna rivers. The finest coins in the first find at Szilágysomlyó were probably minted on the occasion of the victory of Caesar Constantius II over the Goths (the inscriptions read GAVDIUM ROMANORUM and GLORIA ROMANO-RVM) and were sent to the joyful allies along with a triumphal gold medallion depicting Constantine the Great and, on the reverse, two Victorias flanking a shield. This uncommonly large medallion (of which only a Germanic replica survives) commemorates Valens' victory over the Goths, and bears a likeness of the holy emperor, riding over the corpse of a Goth, along with the inscription GLORIA ROMANORVM; it could scarcely have been intended as a present for the defeated Goths. In all likelihood, this and the seven other Valens medallions, along with the two medallions depicting Valentinian and Gratian, respectively, must have been intended as presents for the Gepidic allies' leaders.
In the 370s, the Gepids broke through the Sarmatians' earthworks and invaded a region bounded by the rivers Körös, Tisza, and Maros. This is corroborated, inter alia, by the grave at Sajtény, to the north of the Maros, which yielded a jug with typical smoothed decoration, a bronze fibula with downward curved pin, and a cut glass tumbler identical to one found at Hódmezővásárhely.
{1-176.} These pieces of evidence must be compared with the perceptive account of Ammianus Marcellinus. He wrote that Athanaric, having fled to 'Caucalanda', 'drove the Sarmatians out of that territory'. Yet no Sarmatians could have settled and survived in Transylvania or in the mountains. When Athanaric observed that Valens' officials had refused the request of the Greutung (Ostrogothic) King Vitheric and his escort (Alatheus and Saphrax) to be admitted, he independently looked for an alternative haven, probably in a part of the empire ruled by Gratian. Athanaric fled along the Maros valley out of Caucalanda; it must have been somewhere near Arad that he encountered, and succeeded in routing, the Sarmatians who lived along the river. And it was probably there that, somewhat later, in the second half of 380, he suffered the unexpected and overpowering onslaught of his deadly enemies, the Gepids. He had no choice but to kowtow to the 'Eastern Romans' and flee across the Lower Danube.
Archaeological findings to date do not indicate clearly whether the Gepids set up their princely center near Szilágysomlyó before, or only after the collapse of Visigoth rule in 376. The find at Szilágysomlyó included, in addition to the famous treasure, the grave of a high-ranking warrior (perhaps buried with his mount) who carried battle gear that may date from the turn of the 5th century. The splendid torque discovered a short distance to the north, at Szilágyújlak, is a late-4th century product of the Vandal 'workshop' of Osztrópataka. If it originates from a grave, it points to a 'princely' personage whose manor must have been located in Szilágysomlyó district. Manufactured in a similar workshop, a gold, half-moon shaped pendant, with filigree and granular decoration, that was unearthed near Zilah, points to a similar conclusion.
Once the Goths had withdrawn, the Gepids probably tried to move down the Szamos valley and occupy Dacia. Evidence for this early attempt at settlement is scarce. The most indicative pieces are a shield boss (similar to the one at Szilágysomlyó), sword, and {1-177.} earthen jug found in a grave at Budatelke, and a similar east-west grave at Somkerék, near Beszterce, that yielded a sword, a spear, and a vessel.
The fibulae, decorated with gems, and discovered in a rich woman's grave at Völc (Velz), near the Kis-Küküllő River, are of the same type as six rather more elaborate pairs in the second trove of Szilágysomlyó; others of equal quality have been found at Rábapordány and in the grave at Moult, in Normandy, while smaller and more modest versions formed part of the Gepidic treasure at Gelénes. The Völc find is unique in Transylvania. The other jewels — a pair of gold earrings ending in a polygonal button with inlaid red stones, a gold shoe buckle, and amber beads — are of an 'international' type that had been prevalent for at least two generations. They may have belonged to



The Gepids before Hun Rule
https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/31.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:27:46]
Gepids in the period before the Hun invasion, or, alternatively, to a Germanic noblewoman assimilated by the Huns.
The grave discovered near the village of Csépán, south of Naszód, is equally difficult to assess. According to its funeral obolus, a solidus, minted in 429-30 under Theodosius II, and bearing the inscription VOT XXX MVLT XXXX, the grave dates from the emergence of the Huns' Danubian empire; this is not belied by other objects in the grave, a gold ring and a solid gold bracelet with expanded ends.
The world-famous treasure of Szilágysomlyó marks the end of the pre-Hun, Gepidic period, which was a mere interlude in the history of the region. The splendid gold chain, sixteen gold medals, and other assorted jewels, discovered in a vessel in 1797, are closely related to another find at the same location in 1889: this consisted of a Roman imperial onyx fibula, a Germanic gold ring, three gold cups, and three pairs of beautiful gold fibulae as well as seven pairs of silver-gold fibulae, all of them decorated with cloisonné and precious stones. The Roman gold coins found in the first of these finds also serve to date the older, pure gold jewels of the two {1-178.} finds. However, the dating is not precise. The coins were collected over a period that spans close to eighty years. Very few of the jewels are contemporary with the early coins minted around 330; most of the jewels are either contemporary with, or of a much later date than the coins that were minted in the late 360s. When various historical and archaeological aspects are taken into account — wear-and-tear, breakages and repairs — it appears possible that the treasure, with the addition of the latest jewels, was buried as late as 425.
In terms of the history of Gepids, the treasure is significant in that it must have been hidden by their leaders when news arrived of an impending Hun attack. It could never be retrieved by the owners, for they lost their lives in the ensuing battles. Such was the case with a lesser notable who hurriedly buried his wife's fibulae (similar to those of Szilágysomlyó, but much smaller and plainer) in the Tiszahát, near today's Gelénes; and with another Gepid nobleman, who concealed an ancient silver jug and a silver-gilt jar at Tóti.
The Gepids were defeated and subjugated either, as Gothic legend has it, sometime around 405, by the Ostrogothic King Thorismund, who had been charged by the Huns with the task; or, in a version that has no written record, directly by Huns attacking across the eastern Carpathians; or, in the 420s, by Prince Ruga himself. Whichever version holds true, the treasures reveal at least one thing: the new rulers had no use for the Gepids' ruling family and aristocracy. After crushing the Gepids, the Huns chose new men to rule over the survivors. The initial choices may not have been the most felicitous, but by the time of Attila's reign, the Gepids were led by Ardaric, their greatest historical figure.

The Three Feudal 'Nations' and the Ottoman Threat 3. FROM THE MONGOL INVASION TO THE
BATTLE OF MOHÁCS The Hunyadi Family
The Hussite Movement and the Peasant Revolt
The burdens of national defence were felt most keenly by the villeins. Romanian villeins were taxed only on their sheep, and, being Greek Orthodox, they were exempted from paying tithes. As growing numbers of Hungarian and Saxon villeins moved to the flourishing towns, the lords recruited Romanians to take their place on the land; it was also the Romanians who repopulated the lands of Hungarian and Saxon villeins carried off by the plague or enslaved by the Ottomans. At the request of Transylvania's bishop, the king ruled that Romanians who had been settled on 'Christian lands' (i.e. previously worked by Roman Catholic villeins) had to pay the appropriate tithe. The measure aroused much discontent among the Romanians, who were accustomed to the less onerous sheep tax.
The circumstances of the Hungarian and Saxon villeins also worsened. The spread of a cash economy induced higher material expectations among the nobles, and this, along with the military obligations arising from the Turkish threat, impelled them to raise {1-504.} the feudal dues of the villeins. In 1351, a new feudal impost was introduced, modelled on the tithe and called the 'ninth' (kilenced); the noble landowners demanded this in addition to the earlier feudal services. They raised the ground rent, imposed exceptional taxes, and did all in their power to impede the free migration of villeins. Having been spared from military service for several hundred years, the peasantry did not take kindly to the apparently permanent reimposition of this obligation. Unrest spread among Transylvania's villeins, who in many localities refused to pay church tithes. The trouble began in the less prosperous Székelyföld; deprived of sustenance, priests began to abandon their parishes, and entire districts found themselves deprived of spiritual guidance. Bishop György Lépes laid an anathema on the recalcitrant villages, but the measure proved counter-productive, for it only deepened the despair of the peasantry.
Meanwhile, in Hungary's immediate vicinity, a twenty-year old crusade was being waged against the Hussites by King Sigismund, who was at the same time King of Bohemia and Holy Roman Emperor, and who relied in part on Hungarian troops for this purpose. The origins of this war lay in religious disputes that foreshadowed the Reformation; over time, the struggle became linked to Czech nationalism and, when the radical Taborite party (named after the Hussite centre in southern Bohemia) got the upper hand, it acquired an anti-feudal character. The radical party rejected ecclesiastical courts and taxes and proclaimed social equality, claiming that 'nobody, not even the Pope or the Emperor, can be greater than another man, for we are all brothers in Christ.' These doctrines reached Transylvania and aggravated the unrest of the peasantry. The bishop suspected that his rebellious flock was infected with Hussitism; in 1436, he summoned to Transylvania the Franciscan Jacob of Marchia, an Italian inquisitor who had been dispatched to suppress the Hussites in southern Hungary. Assisted by the bishop's armed contingent, the inquisitor conducted a heavy-{1-505.} handed purge and even made forcible attempts to convert the Greek Orthodox Romanians.
With the unrest apparently stilled, the bishop presumed he could start collecting the arrears of tithes. Earlier, King Sigismund had allowed the currency to be debased, and he issued a new, strong currency in 1436; the bishop insisted that the arrears as well as current tithes be paid in this specie, in effect multiplying the value of the tithe. In the spring of 1437, having been driven beyond endurance, Transylvania's peasantry, Hungarian and Romanian, rose in arms. Their rebellion may have been linked to the concurrent rising — promptly suppressed by the nobles — of peasants in the Nyírség.
The Transylvanian insurgents styled themselves 'freemen' and 'the general union of Hungarians and Romanians in the Transylvanian parts', employing expressions usually applied to nobles to propagate the Hussite program of social equality. They clearly followed the Hussite example in establishing a camp — a kind of Transylvanian 'Tabor' — on the vast Bábolna plateau, near Alparét in Doboka county. Their leaders (Antal Budai Nagy, from Diós, Mihály and Gál Nagy, from Kend, Tamás Nagy, from Szék, János, son of Master Jakab of Kolozsvár, László Gálfi, from Antos, and the standard-bearer Pál Vajdaházi Nagy) dispatched emissaries from the camp to meet the voivode, László Csáky, who had hastened to Transylvania. They demanded the lifting of the excommunication, the settlement of grievances arising from the tithes, and guarantees of free migration for villeins.



The Hussite Movement and the Peasant Revolt
https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/83.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:27:57]
The voivode had the emissaries mutilated, then killed. Having assembled the soldiers of the bishop, of his deputy Loránd Lépes, and of the Székely counts Henrik Tamási and Mihály Kusalyi Jakcs, he proceeded to launch an assault on the peasant rebels. (The voivode had to do it without the forces of Péter Lévai Cseh, co-voivode of Csáky since 1436, for they had been dispatched to confront the Ottomans in the Temes marches.) When his forces suffered {1-506.} a defeat, Csáky left Transylvania, and, at year's end, he was dismissed from office by the king.
The nobility was compelled to negotiate, and on 6 July, at the Kolozsmonostor monastery, agreement was reached that the villeins' grievances would be redressed. The insurgent peasants won a significant victory. The bishop reduced by half the monetary value of the tithes and made concessions in the matter of arrears. The nobles settled for a ground rent of 10 dinars instead of the former one and a half gold forints, and for an annual corvée (involving mainly the maintenance of mill-dams) of one day. They abolished the 'ninth' levy as well as the earlier akó, which involved the delivery of produce. In effect, the nobles had given up their feudal claim to produce and services and contented themselves with a moderate cash levy — a promising step in the emancipation of the peasantry. For his part, the deputy voivode promised to regulate the housing conditions of conscripts. Finally, the villeins' right to free migration was acknowledged. The most ominous clause in the agreement was one guaranteeing the right of villeins to assemble — under arms — each year on the Bábolna plateau, in order to review the compliance of the nobility and, if necessary, take steps to punish abuses.
Although the insurgents affirmed that they were acting on behalf of Transylvania's Romanians as well as Hungarians, there is little sign of active participation by Romanian villeins. Judging from their names, the movement's leaders were evidently Hungarian. Among them, Antal Budai Nagy and, perhaps Pál Vajdaházi Nagy, belonged to the lower nobility. Two members of the eminently noble Suki family joined the rebels; their relatives were active in the opposite camp. The participation of lesser nobles in the rising may be attributable in part to the attempt by Bishop Lépes to impose tithes on their class, and to discontinue the commuting of tithes, which had become common among lay landowners. As for the urban middle class, to the extent that it sympathized {1-507.} with the rebels, it was motivated by disputes with the nobility over customs duties and the migration of peasants to the towns. One of the rebel leaders, János, son of Jakab, was a Hungarian burgher from Kolozsvár. The only rebel leader of Romanian origin was Mihály Virágosberki Oláh; late in the rebellion, he had replaced László Gálfi, who probably fell in battle. The rebels made no reference to specific Romanian demands and had no objection to the 'fiftieth' sheep tax. In fact, the interests of the large number of Romanian villeins settled on 'Christian' lands were the same as those of the Hungarians, and it can be assumed that they supported the rebellion.
The compromise was short-lived, for the nobles chafed at this unprecedented blow to their dignity and interests, and fighting soon flared up again, with acts of merciless cruelty perpetrated by both sides. The peasants fought on, putting to the torch a succession of baronial manors. For decades, the voivodes were so uninterested in Transylvanian affairs that they did not bother to exercise their exclusive authority to convene a general assembly. Now, the nobility felt so hard-pressed that, without waiting for the assent of the absent and neglectful voivode, they prevailed on the deputy voivode to invite leaders of the other two feudal nations to a meeting in midSeptember, at Kápolna. The assembled representatives formed a 'fraternal union' and made plans for the joint defence of Transylvania against all internal and external threats — but not against the king. The unio trium nationum was an ad hoc assembly, driven by the perception among nobles, Székely notables, and Saxon patricians that they faced a common danger coming from the lower social orders. In the event, the first test of their solidarity came a few days after the Kápolna accord, in a bloody clash with the peasants, and the nobles once again felt compelled to negotiate. On 6 October, at Dellőapáti, in Doboka county, the two sides agreed that their delegates should ask the king to arbitrate in the dispute.
{1-508.} The peasants invited the monarch to reissue the laws of King St. Stephen, but they allowed that if the edict could not be found, they would agree to terms less favourable than those in the earlier accord: a levy of one forint for each team of plough-horses, a ground-rent of twelve dinars from landless cotters, the jurisdiction of landlords over their villeins (with the possibility of appeal to the borough courts), and the requirement that a villein obtain his landlord's consent before he moved off the estate. The peasants' concessions indicated that they were tiring of the struggle and retained a somewhat naive confidence in the monarch's goodwill.
In fact, King Sigismund detested grass-roots movements, but he died of a grave illness on 9 December. A decision on the petition had to await the arrival of his successor, the Duke of Austria, Albert von Habsburg. In the

meantime, the peasants won the support of Kolozsvár's citizenry and thereby acquired a fortified base from which to continue their attacks on the nobles' villages. The nobles were now led by the newly-appointed voivode, Dezső Losonci Bánffy, who owned an estate near Bábolna and had a vested interest in the outcome of the struggle. Reinforced by troops freshly dispatched from Western Hungary, they inflicted a decisive defeat on the peasants in a battle near Kolozsmonostor, killing Antal Budai Nagy in the process; Kolozsvár, the rebels' last refuge, fell in January 1438.
On 2 February, the delegates of the three 'nations' assembled at Torda and solemnly confirmed their union. Then the nobles settled their accounts with the rebels. The latter's leaders were tortured and killed; other captives were mutilated and had their eyes put out. Kolozsvár lost its municipal freedom, and many years passed before it could regain its privileges. The concessions that had been made earlier to the villeins remained a dead letter. The king had to intervene to prevent formal abolition of the right of free migration, but the nobles became ever more reluctant to respect that right in practice.
{1-509.} Although the rising ended in failure, it had revealed profound changes at the grass roots. The emergence of a market economy, the example of the lesser nobility and of Székely free peasants all helped the peasantry to develop a sense of its collective interest. The peasants' initial opposition to corvée and rents-in-kind, and their preference for reasonable cash rents make clear that their goal was economic independence and production for the market. Their notions of social equality, inspired by the Hussites, pointed in the same direction. The proposal to turn the Bábolna assembly into an annual event also indicates the emergence of a collective, peasant consciousness, a phenomenon that was displayed in other peasant risings that shook medieval Europe.

The Prelude to Transylvanian Statehood
1. FROM THE EASTERN HUNGARIAN KINGDOM TO THE PRINCIPALITY OF TRANSYLVANIA
'Prince' John Sigismund and 'Voivode' Stephen Báthori
Downfall and Renewal
Hungary's governance was marked by a precarious and delicate balance of power, one vulnerable to the first major disturbance. The discord that appeared to have been suppressed by the military campaigns of 1543–44 flared up again at the end of the decade as a consequence of political developments outside Hungary. There appeared, at the apex of power, an advocate of a break with the Szapolyai policy. This time, the challenge came not from Isabella, but from the friar himself, who seemingly decided to acknowledge Habsburg rule.
This stunning reversal had its roots in early 1546, when the Sublime Porte, freed of the demands of a Danubian war, adopted a firmer stance regarding the Szapolyai kingdom. In order to secure communications between Titel and Szeged, the Ottomans demanded that the fortresses of Becse and Becskerek be handed over to them. Predictably, their request caused an uproar in Gyulafehérvár. György Fráter lost no time in asking the sultan to reconsider the demand; meanwhile, on the home front, he devoted his energies to countering the attempts of Isabella to exploit the crisis.
The feudal estates in Transylvania and the region east of the Tisza also tried to draw advantage from the Becse affair. In autumn {1-620.} 1546, at the diet in Kolozsvár, a resolution was passed demanding that the regent give a public accounting of the state's finances. György Fráter convened a 'counter-diet' at Szászsebes, then, after protracted wrangling, reached an accommodation with Isabella; his major concession was a promise to let the queen participate in the affairs of state.
The year 1547 brought three significant changes in European politics. The Habsburgs' arch-enemy, Francis I, died the last day of March. On April 24, Charles V's army won a decisive victory near Mühlberg over forces of the rebellious Protestant princes (the Schmalkalden League). Finally, on June 19, a peace treaty was concluded between the Holy Roman Emperor and the Sultan of the Ottomans.
A good twenty years had passed since King John first decided to ally himself with the Ottomans. This policy had obviously produced some positive results. Left largely to its own devices, Eastern Hungary was preserved from Turkish attack, and this without having to submit to the sultan's suzerainty. Moreover, the country's peace was not seriously disturbed by the expansionary efforts of the Habsburgs.
However, these results owed much to Ferdinand I, whose resistance, however passive, constrained the Ottomans' freedom of action. In the event that this confrontation should dissipate, Transylvania would face the prospect and necessity of submitting to the Ottomans. The loss of Buda and the Becse affair indicated that the Ottomans were still bent on conquest, and that they had their eyes on the Szapolyais' part of Hungary. The threat was more than hypothetical: in 1547, Suleiman reiterated his request for the castles in the Temesköz and refused to extend the peace treaty with the Habsburgs to cover the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom. To be sure, he wrote to Isabella assuring her of his continuing good will, but the message was full of qualifications.
{1-621.} It is not surprising, then, that Isabella's advisers, headed by György Fráter, addressed a desperate appeal to Charles V — much like the feudal estates of Habsburg Hungary had done earlier — not to endorse the treaty, warning him that the peace would precipitate Hungary's utter destruction: 'For no peace is possible with an enemy that is bent not only on conquering us, but also on killing us; an enemy that is no longer satisfied with our tribute but is raising demands for more and more of our fortresses and is searching for opportunities to wear us down... At a time when the need is urgent and his military preparedness high, the emperor should not allow to let the opportunity pass, but attempt to liberate Hungary... Besides, [Transylvania] is ringed by virtually impassable mountains, and it can be defended by relatively small forces stationed in the passes. However, once lost, Transylvania would be very difficult to reconquer... Since our honour and loyalty bind us to the queen and her innocent son, we beg that you take steps to assure their welfare in accordance with the treaties'.[4]

Agreements may be signed simply to deceive or to gain time, as occurred in 1538 and 1541. To request continuation of the war, and to make a scarcely-veiled offer to comply with the Gyalu Treaty, incurred graver responsibilities. However, there was no other means available to persuade the Habsburgs to persist in the war against the Ottomans. To those living in the Carpathian Basin, it seemed that the German Empire, freed of its most dangerous internal and external enemies, was in an unprecedentedly favourable situation. The Ottomans, for their part, took advantage of the European peace to launch a new Persian offensive in early 1548.
The Hungarian overture fell on deaf ears in Vienna as well as at the German court. Charles V had little confidence that the empire's internal problems had been resolved by his victory at Mühlberg, and he thus clung to the peace agreement reached with the Sublime Porte. In Hungary, the war of nerves dragged on. For {1-622.} the most part, the feudal estates blamed the friar, and his supposed blind hunger for power, for the enduring division of the country. Queen Isabella, for her part, asserted her independence in the spring 1548 by initiating talks with Ferdinand I about the possibility of her departure.
György Fráter decided that the time had come to break Hungarian policy out of its vicious circle. He proposed to nudge the Habsburgs out of their sterile inaction and drive Isabella into making a choice that would definitively settle the fate of the House of Szapolyai. He took advantage of the queen's spring initiative to start his own negotiations with Vienna, offering once again to implement the Gyalu Treaty.
Ferdinand was faced with a difficult choice. Although he realized that Charles V had cause to remain passive, he was unwilling to surrender what was perhaps his most ardently pursued goal: sovereignty over all of Hungary. His aim may have been similar to that of the regent in Transylvania, to force his emperor brother to become involved in the struggle for Hungary. He may even have entertained the illusion that if he won the support of all Hungarians, he would become strong enough to deal with the Ottomans. Alternatively, he may have only wanted to eliminate the Szapolyai state, which only promoted dissension among Hungarians and hostility toward him, and cared little about the consequences for Transylvania and the Tisza region if the Ottomans considered the Hungarian initiative to be a casus belli.
György Fráter intended the proposed accord to preserve his state from the Ottomans. In the event, it took more than a year for Ferdinand to make up his mind and agree to commit troops to the defence of his future province. The new agreement, ratified in September 1549 at Nyírbátor, also provided compensation — the Silesian principalities of Oppeln and Ratibor — for Isabella and 'King John's son'. The negotiators agreed that the treaty should be kept secret and that the friar would continue to govern Transylvania, now in the name of King Ferdinand I.
{1-623.} Isabella was not privy to the negotiations leading up to the Nyírbátor agreement. During those fateful days, she sojourned at Déva castle, planning a marriage that would presumably facilitate her departure from Hungary. When she learned of the agreement — concluded without her knowledge, and against her interests — the queen abandoned all pretence: she rejected the terms and set about rallying her supporters. Her earlier threats to leave the country had been purely tactical, with the aim of weakening the friar's authority. Committed to preserving the dynasty's power, Isabella went so far as to denounce György Fráter to the sultan as a 'traitor'.
The Porte had already got wind of the agreement from Vienna, and it now dispatched an agent to Gyulafehérvár, with instructions to seize or execute the regent. Supporters of the Szapolyai cause now felt free to challenge the friar, and took up arms. Péter Petrovics led troops from Temes province into the Maros valley, and the Székelys turned rebellious. Meanwhile, some feudal lords, led by Ferenc Kendi and Farkas Bethlen, adopted a wait-and-see attitude. By September 1550, the friar was in dire straits, but thanks to his extraordinary energy, he once again rose to the challenge. He launched a counter-attack, laying siege to the fortress at Gyulafehérvár, where Isabella was sheltered. After six weeks, the queen gave up the struggle and dispatched envoys to tell the friar that she would receive him back in her 'good graces'. Her willingness to compromise was opportune, and probably not purely coincidental, for the Szapolyai realm had come under attack from three directions simultaneously: by Kasim, the Pasha of Buda, at Lippa, by Moldavian forces at Bereck, and by Wallachia's voivode at the Vöröstorony Pass. On October 29, the friar convened an armed diet at Torda and, exploiting the general alarm, managed to rally his supporters. In early November, the military balance shifted in his favour. Péter Petrovics' fortresses in the Temesköz were overrun by the captain of Várad, Tamás Varkocs; the Moldavian voivode Ilie was driven back beyond the Carpathians by forces under the friar's {1-624.} command; the Wallachians were routed by János Kendi;

and the lord lieutenant of Hunyad county, János Török, repulsed the forces of Kasim Pasha.
The danger was thus overcome, and the queen gave in. On November 30, at Gyulafehérvár, a tearful Isabella made peace with György Fráter and endorsed the Nyírbátor agreement. By then, the friar had no doubt that the queen's presence constituted a double burden for him. A personal threat, for whenever he departed from the late King John's political line, the power-hungry woman would emerge as the natural leader of Szapolyai loyalists; and a threat to the country, for — at least in the friar's opinion — her policy shifts were always inopportune and illinspired. Now, in 1550, it had become clear that even though Isabella was no match for him, she would not shrink from inciting her followers to defy the regent.
The friar was therefore determined to put into effect the Nyírbátor agreement. However, he was not aware that while he was forcefully quelling the opposition of the queen and their subjects in order to pave the way for cooperation with the Habsburgs, in Vienna, the Hungarian question once again lost its urgency. In 1550, at an imperial council in Augsburg, Ferdinand had his first major quarrel with Charles V. He could no longer count on his brother's aid in pursuit of his ambitions in Transylvania — an ominous turn, considering that the Ottomans had just terminated their Persian campaign. The Habsburg king momentarily lost his self-assurance and proposed to György Fráter that they postpone implementation of the agreement. However, the friar was past the point of no return. Isabella, for her part, made sure that he would be compelled to make his choice. The tears she had shed at Gyulafehérvár soon dried, and she once again protested to the sultan at the friar's 'treason', requesting that her son be named 'King of Transylvania'. The initiative was backed by her most faithful ally, Péter Petrovics, by other supporters, notably the aristocrats Ferenc Patócsy, from Békés county, and Menyhárt Balassa from Upper Hungary. {1-625.} Petrovics even offered Becse and Becskerek to the Ottomans in return for overthrowing the regent. In May 1551, rebellion broke out once again in Transylvania, and once again György Fráter laid siege to Gyulafehérvár.
The Hungarian aristocrats who engaged in humiliating talks with the sultan did so for reasons that are obvious. If György Fráter and the majority of Transylvania's elite realized their goal of adhering to the Habsburgs' realm, the first to suffer the Ottomans' predictable riposte would be the border regions: the Temesköz, which was Petrovics's domain, and the southern part of the region east of the Tisza, which encompassed the Patócsy family's estates. It is scarcely surprising that they were the ones least reassured by the Habsburgs' promise of assistance.
Ferdinand I did not wish to appear weak when, after twenty-five years, the opportune moment finally arrived. In the summer of 1551, he launched a Transylvanian campaign. The army, led by an Italian mercenary officer, Giovanni Battista Castaldo, Lord Chief Justice [országbíró] Tamás Nádasdy, and István Losonci, consisted of no more than six to seven thousand men — 'too little for an army, too much for a diplomatic mission,' remarked a bitter observer.[5] In the event, Castaldo's mercenaries did not need to fight a battle. When, at the beginning of June, Menyhárt Balassa and Péter Petrovics sped to rescue the besieged Isabella, they were defeated by György Fráter, and on June 7, Gyulafehérvár surrendered. On 19 June, at Szászsebes castle, a despairing Isabella signed on behalf of the child-king John II the letter of abdication thrust upon her by the friar. Castaldo marched into Gyulafehérvár, and András Báthori soon took over the governance of Temes province. On 26 July, the diet at Kolozsvár acknowledged the queen's abdication and the restoration of King Ferdinand's rule. On August 8, Isabella left Transylvania, travelling first to Kassa, then to Silesia. Péter Petrovics was granted Munkács castle in exchange for Temesvár.
It was a promising start, but storm clouds were already gathering in the southeast. Ferdinand's ambassador in Istanbul, {1-626.} Malvezzi, reported on 18 July 1551 that the sultan had reacted to the military movements in Transylvania by instructing Mehmed Sokollu, the bey of Rumelia, to launch an offensive, and that he, the ambassador, was being held captive. Pasha Mehmed had reached Szalánkemén with his troops when, on August 3, he learned that the sultan's treasury had received from György Fráter the tribute of 10,000 forints, which had been paid annually ever since 1543. Mehmed sent off a letter requesting that the friar clarify his intentions, and, while awaiting an answer, proceeded to occupy Becse, Becskerek, Csanád, and Lippa; thanks to the heroism of Temesvár's new captain, István Losonci, the bey failed capture that stronghold. These successes, together with an abundance of gifts, mollified the Turkish leader to the point that he lent credence to György Fráter's apology: the real traitor had been Petrovics, for it was his fortresses which were now guarded by Ferdinand's troops! The military operation was terminated, according to Turkish custom, on Kasim's Day, at the end of October, but the

bey's departure gave only temporary respite to György Fráter.
To be sure, the hopes of Transylvania's regent had been fulfilled in two important respects: first, he had got the Habsburgs to violate their peace treaty with the Ottomans, and, second, he had got rid of Queen Isabella. On the other hand, the Ottomans had sprung into action and occupied a large chunk of Transylvania's southeastern defence line. This understandably unsettled the feudal estates. Moreover, although reinforcements had arrived, led by the general Sforza Pallavicini, the assistance provided by the Habsburgs remained comparatively small. This weakness was scarcely compensated by the fact that Ferdinand had obtained a cardinal's hat for the friar.
In November 1551, György Fráter set himself an exceedingly difficult task: to respond to the Turkish assault without seriously provoking the Sublime Porte. Assembling all available troops, including Castaldo's mercenaries and the auxiliary units of the {1-627.} Hungarian feudal estates, he set off for Lippa. Mehmed claimed earlier that he had not intended to occupy the town, but that the predominantly Serbian townsfolk had invited him in. The Turkish garrison soon surrendered, and the regent, overriding the protests of his lieutenants, allowed them to leave freely.
Ferdinand I had always suspected that Transylvania's uncrowned ruler might be drawing his armies into a trap. There was little ambiguity in the order he gave to Castaldo at the start of the campaign: 'Should you become convinced that [the friar's] actions will clearly bring harm to us, we allow and order you to deal with him in accordance with the interests of our country and its loyal subjects. It is your duty to apply our will in this matter.'[6] The mercenary officers feared for their lives in Transylvania; their fear was accentuated by the hatred that Nádasdy (the Lord Chief Justice was the brother-in-law of István Maylád!) and his companions bore for the friar and by their constant exposure to the Ottomans. Moreover, the officers suspected that the freeing of Lippa's defenders and the assignment of mercenary soldiers to winter quarters in Transylvanian villages were but the prelude to some sinister plot against them. While awaiting the Ottomans' reaction, György Fráter tried to dispel these unfounded fears, and he even dismissed his bodyguards. That gesture, however, sealed the friar's fate, for the commander of the Habsburg troops, Castaldo, promptly exploited what he saw as a favourable opportunity.
Sforza Pallavicini received the order to put Castaldo's plan into action. Marc Antonio Ferrari, who earlier had served as secretary to the regent's council, and was, since mid-1551, Castaldo's personal secretary, provided the necessary intelligence. It was also Ferrari who mounted the ambush at Alvinc, where, on the night of 15–16 December 1551, György Fráter, regent of Transylvania and Cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church, was brutally murdered.
There is ample evidence that Ferdinand knew and approved of the plot. The decision of the friar-regent to invite the Habsburgs {1-628.} into his country was clearly ill-conceived, and if he had any intention to rectify the mistake, it was aborted by his assassination at Alvinc. As for Ferdinand, the act only betrayed his impotence: unable to give Transylvania adequate assistance, he got rid of the man who might have been able to draw the appropriate conclusions from that impotence. Thus the fate of Eastern Hungary remained unresolved in 1551.
While Castaldo reannexed Transylvania and the Tisza region to Habsburg Hungary, the sultan, feeling betrayed and incensed at the territorial gains made by his enemies, sent his armies against Hungary's frontier defences in 1552. Ferdinand and his realm proved to be totally unprepared for this foreseeable assault. Several of Hungary's peripheral fortresses fell in the course of the campaign, including Veszprém, Drégely, Szolnok, Lippa, Temesvár, Karánsebes and Lugos. Only Eger castle, whose defense was led by István Dobó, withstood the besieging Ottomans.
The Ottomans's biggest gains were along the southeastern defences of the former Szapolyai realm: the entire Temesköz, Arad county, and the lower reaches of the Maros River. The mercenary forces showed cowardice; Captain Aldana's Spanish garrison at Lippa simply took to its heels. István Losonci's death when Temesvár fell only confirmed the futility of self-sacrificing resistance.
Meanwhile, Transylvania's three 'nations' had given repeated evidence of their indifference toward the state that had just collapsed. The Saxons had obtained the right to pay their taxes independently of the Transylvanian diet and excluded themselves from the voivode's sphere of authority. The Székelys sought to recover their tax-free status. All three 'nations' insisted on raising their own, separate defences against external threat. In order to forestall a potentially hostile coalition, Ferdinand I forbade the feudal estates to convene their diets. The aristocrats

from the region east of the Tisza and the Tisza region thereupon began to attend diets {1-629.} convened in Western Hungary; in their view, the king had changed, but their country endured.
The Hungarians' spirits, already low after the Turkish successes in 1552, fell even more when the Sublime Porte began to intervene overtly in their domestic affairs. Firmans from the sultan, along with letters from Romanian rulers and Turkish beys in border provinces, enjoined the Transylvanians to invite Isabella and her son to return. Already, in 1552, the cowed Transylvanian diet had decided to continue payment of the 10,000-forint tribute. Castaldo and the voivode appointed by Ferdinand, András Báthori of Ecsed, protested, but in vain: Péter Haller, the onetime leader of the Saxon opposition, volunteered to take charge of the negotiations. At the talks, which began in the autumn of 1552, Haller went so far as to promise that if the sultan handed back the Temesköz, the Transylvanians would get rid of the German troops and elect a new voivode.
For the time being, that proposal had no consequences, and most people continued to draw some reassurance from Ferdinand's promises. Only the aristocrats in the most vulnerable region, the southern part of the region east of the Tisza, rebelled against the defenceless state: in the summer of 1553, they convened at an impromptu diet in Kereki and invited Queen Isabella to return; they also addressed a plea for help to the pasha in Buda. Accompanied by a small force of cavalry, Péter Petrovics hurried to join the Kereki rebels, who included Kelemen Ártándy, Ferenc Patócsy, and Gábor Bethlen. They found a few supporters in Transylvania as well, notably Antal Kendi and Kristóf Hagymássy, and the Székelys showed some interest in rallying to the cause.
By this time, Castaldo's government was on the brink of collapse. In 1552, his mercenary soldiers, deprived of battle and paid irregularly, aggravated their ill repute by looting towns and putting them to the torch. Instead of trying to restore public confidence, the bewildered general engineered the assassination of Ştefan Rareş, {1-630.} Moldavia' voivode. In early 1553, the king recalled Castaldo and withdrew the mercenaries from Transylvania, concluding that they did more to impede than to help the restoration of order. Involved in yet another Persian campaign, the Ottomans were unwilling to back the rebellion headed by Petrovics and Patócsy; it was suppressed by the new voivodes, Ferenc Kendi and the hero of Eger, István Dobó.
However, the sultan did not give up his goal of regaining control over Transylvania. The 1552 campaign had shown that the balance of power in the contested Danubian region was unchanged: although the Ottomans were unquestionably superior in tactics, they remained unable to break through the Habsburgs' defences in Hungary. The latest Persian campaign soon came to an end, and, in the summer of 1554, the Ottomans launched another offensive in Hungary, occupying Salgó and Fülek. In the meantime, a new envoy arrived from Istanbul to demand that Transylvania's three nations recall the Szapolyai royals. To press the point, Suleiman handed back Lugos and Karánsebes to Péter Petrovics; Ferdinand, meanwhile, still could not deliver adequate assistance. Acknowledging its impotence, Vienna paid Transylvania's tribute to the Porte and initiated new talks aiming at a peace treaty.
The sultan was willing to consider the proposal on condition that the Habsburgs give up Transylvania. His reply, delivered to Vienna's envoys, Antal Verancsics and the knight Busbecq, gave Ferdinand until November 1555 to make up his mind. Meanwhile, a firman issued on 7 October 1555 threatened the Transylvanians with an invasion if they did not call back the son of King John.
The Romanian principalities prepared for war, as did the Turkish garrisons in the Great Plain. At the instigation of Péter Petrovics, rebellion erupted once again in the region east of the Tisza. The Transylvanian diet, convened on 23 December 1555 at Marosvásárhely, sent un unambiguous message to the king: 'We were pleased to have a Christian ruler and links to the Holy Roman {1-631.} Emperor, but it was not God's will that this should endure, for we fear the enemy: it is near, has great numbers and might, and now that it is free of its Asian problems, it threatens us with all the power at its disposal. The enemy has warned us that our country will be put to fire and sword, and that we, our women, our children, our families will be exterminated. Those who witnessed the fall of Lippa and Temesvár know that this threat is genuine. We therefore ask that you either provide assistance sufficient to let us prevail against Suleiman, or release us from our oath.'[7]
In fact, they did not really expect to get an answer. The Hungarian captain general, Menyhárt Balassa, convened another diet at the end of January 1556, in Torda. It was no secret that the meeting was scheduled to declare secession. The voivodes Kendi and Dobó tried to restrain a few influential men by bribing them with gifts, but in vain. The participants, mainly Székelys and Hungarians, called for the return of Isabella and her son and invited

Péter Petrovics to lead his forces into Transylvania. The next diet, convened by Péter Petrovics on March 12 at Szászsebes, adopted the definitive resolution: 'On this day we have by our common will elected the son of our late King John as our Prince and King, and we will loyally serve his majesty and master now and in times to come.'[8]
Envoys were dispatched to bring back the dowager queen and her son. They headed for Cracow, Poland's royal seat, since Vienna had not even bothered to detain Isabella in Oppeln. The promise of the Silesian principalities had come with such miserly conditions that the queen preferred to seek shelter with her younger brother, Sigismund August, King of Poland.
On June 14, while the Transylvanian lords were enjoying a predictably warm welcome at the Cracow court, Ferdinand I wrote to the sultan announcing that he would give back Transylvania to John Sigismund. As usual, he backed down too late. As early as May, the forces of Buda's pasha, Khadim Ali, had laid siege to {1-632.} Szigetvár. Isabella and John Sigismund set off and made a ceremonial entry in Kolozsvár on October 22. Péter Petrovics and Menyhárt Balassa, assisted by Romanian auxiliary troops, proceeded to occupy one after another of the royal fortresses. Gyulafehérvár and Gyalu were the first to surrender, and Pál Bornemissza, whom Ferdinand had appointed Bishop of Transylvania back in 1551, was put to flight. The Romanians turned homeward, but Déva, Fogaras, Bethlen, Huszt, and the Saxon towns soon followed suit in raising the Szapolyai banner. Significant resistance was largely limited to the region east of the Tisza; Várad's isolated garrison held out until April 1557, while Gyula castle fell only in 1566, and then, to the Ottomans. In Transylvania, István Dobó once again lived up to his reputation as Hungary's most valiant captain with his defence of Szamosújvár, but he too had to acknowledge the futility of resistance and surrender in November 1556. In the northeast, Gömör and Torna counties were taken into the Szapolyai camp by Ferenc Bebek, Abaúj and Zemplén by Gábor Perényi, and Sáros by György Tárczay. Thus the Szapolyais' realm was recreated, and with some hope of being self-sustaining, for internal forces as well as external factors militated in favour of its survival.

7. TRANSYLVANIA IN THE PERIOD OF THE HUNGARIAN CONQUEST AND FOUNDATION OF A STATE
Archaeological Traces in Transylvania of the Hungarian Conquest
{1-277.} Conquest, Settlement, and Raids
'... et ab ungerorum nos defendas iaculis.'
Moving westward from the Don region, the Hungarians reached the Danube Delta between 832 and 836. Their temporary settlement area, which they called Etelköz ('Atelkuzu'), eventually extended to the valleys of the Dniester, Prut, and Seret rivers. The archaeological evidence, though ambiguous, is probably indicative of their passage: for instance, in the older section of the 'common people's' cemetery at Căpreria, in Moldavia (shallow graves, on an west-east axis, holding personal accessories, trepanned skulls, and 'Saltovo-type' pots), or at another cemetery in Moldavia, at Braneşti, where traces were found of distinctively Hungarian rites. Some graves, with horses, that are more likely Hungarian than Pecheneg have been found in southern Moldavia at Friedensfeld/ Mirnopole and Sabalaţ/Szadovoj; the grave at Frumusika/ Frumuşica yielded bow-stiffeners made of bone, an ironstudded quiver, and seven arrowheads, all of distinctly Hungarian character. Graves that are arguably of Hungarian origin have been found even in Moldova (Holboca, Moscu, Probotă, Grozeşti).
In the case of certain isolated burial places dating from the 9th–10th century — 'nomadic' graves, with horse and plain weapons such as quivers and arrows — it is difficult, and at times impossible to ascertain whether they are of pre-900, Hungarian origin, or of post-900, Pecheneg provenance. According to the reputable report of Constantine Porphyrogenetos, written around 948, the Pechenegs' domain had already stretched at that time for fifty years as far as 'the lower reaches of the Danube, opposite Dristra' [now Silistra] ). This, however, does not preclude the presence of Hungarians, in the 9th century, in Moldova or in the Lower Danube region. A number of finds are arguably of Hungarian origin. At {1-278.} Probotă (Prut valley, north of Iaşi), the incomplete grave of a man (with bundled horse-skin) yielded a quiver holding seven typical arrowheads. Similar discoveries have been made at Grozeşti, as well as at Moviliţa (Ialomiţa valley, north of Bucharest), where a quiver held six diamond-shaped arrowheads. The report on a find at Tirgşor (Muntenia) attributes Hungarian origin to a lyre-shaped, bronze clasp.
In 862, Hungarian mounted warriors traversed the Carpathians and raided Pannonia (Hostes ... qui Ungri vocantur, regnum ... depopulantur).[21] They had come at the invitation of their ally, the Moravian leader Rastislav. The following year, the Eastern Frank King Louis retaliated by forging an alliance with the Bulgars, whose Khan Boris-Mikhael sent mounted troops (cum auxilio Bulgarorum ab oriente venientium) to help beat Rastislav into submission. That set a pattern of confrontation in the Danubian region which lasted for some twenty-five years: Hungarians and Moravians against Bulgars and Franks. The Hungarian Conquest was one of the factors that upset this military balance. In 881, Svatopluk received assistance both from the Hungarians' Kabar auxiliaries and from a Hungarian force that advanced as far as Vienna (Primum bellum cum Vngaris ad Veniam, Secundum bellum cum Cowaris ad Culmite).[22] Two years later, Svatopluk suffered a punishing blow from the Bulgars. In 892, when Svatopluk once again refused to pay obeisance to the Franks, he could still count on his Hungarian allies — but also on Bulgar retaliation. Emissaries, sent by the Franks to request assistance from the Bulgars in Belgrade, had to travel along the Sava to avoid capture by Svatopluk's forces. The situation took a decisive turn in September 892, when Khan Vladimir informed Arnulf's envoys that the Franks could no longer count on his military aid in the Carpathian Basin; the Bulgars were only prepared to halt salt deliveries to the enemy. The Frank delegation was still there when Simeon ascended to the Bulgar throne; once a hostage of the Byzantines, he vengefully {1-279.} prepared for war. In response, the Byzantine Emperor Leo VI's envoy Niketas Skleros met on the Lower Danube with the Hungarian ruling princes Árpád and Kurszán, and they agreed to form an alliance. As a result, a Hungarian force, led by Árpád's son, Liüntika (Levente), was ferried across the Danube by the Byzantines and attacked Simeon's Bulgars from the rear. Simeon suspended his campaign against Byzantium to turn against the Hungarians. Defeated by the latter, he sought refuge in the castle at Dristra (Silistra).
That same year, in 894, Hungarian warriors advanced into the Carpathian Basin and Pannonia to aid Svatopluk



Conquest, Settlement, and Raids

against the Bulgars' Frankish allies. When they learned of Svatopluk's death, the Hungarians pulled back, though apparently only as far as the region of the Upper Tisza. In spring 895, Árpád followed with his army and, after some skirmishes on the Great Plain, brought the Bulgars' rule to an end.
When the Hungarians arrived to settle in the Carpathian Basin, they encountered little resistance on the part of the Bulgars. The latter had demonstrated their capability to attack Moravians north of the Garam, but that did not necessarily mean that they had ever stationed significant forces farther north than Belgrade. It took no more than ten days for mounted men to cross the broad plain (Avar[or]um solitudo) lying between the Moravian and Bulgar borderlands (Vulga[ro]rum fines). In the fateful period 894–899, the Bulgars maintained but a few outposts, such as the fort at Csongrád, each manned by some 100–200 soldiers.
Having hurriedly made peace with Byzantium, the Bulgars concentrated their forces to defeat Liüntika's Hungarians. Their new allies, the Pechenegs, simultaneously launched attacks on the Hungarian encampments in the Etelköz. The ensuing, massive withdrawal by the Hungarians ended in the 'conquest', or rather settlement, of what became their permanent homeland.
{1-280.} The route taken by the Hungarians is recorded in their 11th-century chronicle, the Gesta Ungarorum. Their flight stretched over three months. Pursued by the Pechenegs (the Hungarian name of the Pechenegs, 'besenyő', derives from the Old Hungarian 'bese', meaning 'eagle'), who slaughtered their horses and livestock, the Hungarians flooded through the Eastern Carpathian passes and forests into the haven of Transylvania (Exinde montes descenderunt per tres menses et deveniunt in confinium regni Hungariae, scilicet in Erdelw). There, they and what was left of their herds could rest and regain strength (In Erdelw igitur quieverunt et pecora sua recreaverunt). There is no reason to question the lore of the Hungarian ruling family, according to which one of the ruling personages, Álmos, died before he could reach Pannonia; he was sacrificed, in Khazar fashion, while in Transylvania, presumably because of the defeat suffered at the hands of the Pechenegs (Almus in patria Erdelw occisus est, non enim potuit in Pannoniam introire).
In their flight from Bulgaria, the remnants of the defeated Hungarian armies had no alternative but to seek refuge in Transylvania; the narrow passage on the south bank of the Lower Danube was guarded by strongly-manned Bulgar fortresses at Vidin and Belgrade.
Both ancient Hungarian legend and written sources indicate that the 'conquering' Hungarians first stop was in Transylvania. From there, they made their way up the valley of the Maros and Sebes-Körös — and perhaps also through the Meszes Gate — towards the Great Plain.
After a year or two, a Hungarian 'expeditionary' force of some 5000 horsemen conducted a campaign that left a major mark on European history and left Italy in a weakened state for an entire generation. On 24 September 899, the Hungarians crossed the Brenta River on horseback to confront a Lombard army that (according to a contemporary Italian source) outnumbered them by {1-281.} three to one. The result was a crushing defeat for the king of Italy, {1-282.} Berengar I. They occupied Mosaburg (Zalavár) and Pannonia shortly thereafter, and in 902 they annihilated (usque ad solum) the Moravians — something that the Eastern Frankish empire and its Bulgar allies had been attempting in vain for some fifty years.
On 4–5 July 907, Bavarian forces engaged the Hungarians near the former stronghold of the East Frankish Duke Braslav (Bresalauspurc-Pressburg, Pozsony), and suffered defeat. Their casualties numbered in the thousands and included Prince Luitpold and nineteen of his counts as well as Theotmar, Archbishop of Salzburg, with two of his bishops and three abbots.
The Hungarian warriors were evidently bold and resourceful. They shot off volleys of arrows even as they swam across the swift-flowing Brenta. They carried full equipment when, at dawn on July 5, they crossed the Danube at Pozsony. In the ensuing decades, they crossed the Danube, Sava, Po, Inn, Lech, Iller, Rhine, Rhône, Seine, Loire, Elbe, Weser rivers countless times. Yet some Hungarian as well as non-Hungarian historians blithely ignore this evidence and maintain that the conquering Hungarians were held back for many years by lesser waterways in the Carpathian Basin...
In the aftermath of the Battle of Pozsony, the Hungarians seemed unstoppable. On 3 August 908, at Eisenach, they crushed the Thuringians, killing in the process Burckhart, the Marquess of Thuringia, and Rudolf, Bishop of



Conquest, Settlement, and Raids

Würzburg. In 910, they divided and defeated the principal forces of the Eastern Frankish empire: on June 12, at the Lech plain near Augsburg, they disposed of a Swabian-Alemanni army (Count Gausbert was a casualty), and ten days later, at Rednitz, they defeated the Franks, killing the Frankish commander Prince Konradin Gebhardt. The army of Henry I of Saxony suffered the same fate in the summer of 919, and so did the forces of Rudolf, Prince of Burgundy, in the fall. In the winter of 920–921, on a battlefield between Brescia and Verona, they prevailed over the Burgundian and Lombardian enemies of their ally, Berengar I. Pressing forward, they dealt in 924 a punishing blow to the forces of Raymund III, Count of Toulouse. And so it went until 15 March 933, when, near Riade, the Hungarians suffered their first major defeat. All these events were accurately recorded by their enemies at the time. Yet historians who give credence to Anony-mus's Gesta maintain that the Hungarians had failed to prevail over the Bihar leader 'Menumorout'...
Back in 900, on June 29, the Hungarians had attempted the impossible and laid siege to Venice; to halt their advance, the defenders had to stretch a chain across the Canal Grande. They laid waste Vercelli and Modena at a time when Mosaburg still stood in Pannonia. The Moravian fortresses must have been well defended, for the Franks and Bavarians captured only one of them, at Dovina. By the time of the Battle of Pozsony, many Moravians had changed sides, braided their hair in the pagan manner, and fought shoulder to shoulder with the Hungarians. The Hungarians captured or burned down Verona, Bergamo, Brescia, Pavia, Piacenza, Tarentum, Lucca, and Beneventum; and, in the west, Altaich, Augsburg, Freising, Fulda, Brema, Basel, Sankt Gallen, Verdun, Châlons, Reims, Nîmes, Narbonne, Besançon, Malmédy, as well as Tournai. These were the warriors who, according to Anonymus and his imitators, could barely manage to seize Zemplén, Szatmár, and Doboka, and who could prevail at Bihar only in the final phase of their conquest, after a long siege, and then only by negotiation...
They covered great distances on horseback: across the Rhine, to Burgundy, in 913; along the Weser valley to Bremen and Denmark in 915; in 917, back across the Rhine to Alsace and Lorraine. In 922, they raided Apulia, reaching as far as Otranto and Tarentum in early February, and on their way back ravaged the environs of Naples and Rome. Two years later, the Hungarians crossed the Pyrenees into the province of Barcelona before returning along the Rhône valley and across the Rhine. In 926, they advanced along the Loire as far as the Atlantic Ocean, and one of {1-283.} their northern detachments reached the English Channel. Serving as the Pope's allies, they battled in Tuscany and around Rome in 927. They laid siege to Constantinople in April 934, then marauded through Macedonia and Thessaly. The following year, they were back in Burgundy and Aquitania. In the course a great campaign in 937, they plundered Lorraine and French Aquitania as far as the seacoast, then swept through Burgundy into Italy, where they ravaged the environs of Capua, Nola, Naples, and Beneventum. In 938, they were back at Rome. In the summer of 942, the Hungarians advanced across northern Italy and the Provence into Spain. They raided Byzantium and Hellas in April 943, and four years later they were once again in Apulia, where they devastated Otranto and Lerino. So often did they cross the Carinthian Alps on their way to Italy that their route was known for centuries as the strata ungarorum. In 951, another raid took them across northern Italy to Gallia. Three years later, the Hungarians conducted another major campaign in northern France. After suffering a defeat in 955 at Augsburg, they stopped raiding western Europe, but continued to harass Byzantium. They reached Constantinople on 3 April 959, came back in 961, and once again in 968, when they pillaged the environs of Thessaloniki as well. The question bears restating: how could these Hungarians have had trouble covering the few kilometres, on level land, that separate Vámospércs from Gálospetri and Szalacs, Ártánd from Bihar, Nagylak from Sajtény, as is argued even today by some historians and archaeologists who choose to rely on Anonymus?
The Hungarians' 'adventures' must not be embellished or idealized. Their goal was treasure and slaves, plunder and prey. The rampaging Hungarians brought dreadful destruction to Europe's towns and villages, churches and monasteries, and they were deservedly condemned by the public opinion of their day. It remains that they were no worse or more destructive than the Vikings, notwithstanding the attempts of historians in northern {1-284.} Europe to explain that the latter were driven to 'heroic deeds' by economic necessity. It is clear by now that the western raids were conducted not by 'the Hungarians' as a whole but by their rulers, clan chiefs, and the latter's 'professional' soldiery. They often entered into strategic alliances with one or the other of Europe's warring kings, and in this respect the moral outrage of contemporaries was somewhat selective. Their military tactics rested on rapid, concerted operations by well-disciplined, mounted soldiers. To understand the Conquest, it is important to put the Hungarians' military capability in the context of the balance of power of the Danubian region.
Since, by 895, the Hungarians had already buried one of their ruling princes in Transylvania, there may well be

https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/52.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:28:19]
archaeological evidence of their presence from that period onwards. A coin, minted under the Bavarian duke Berthold (Hrahtoldvs) (938–947), indicates that in subsequent years and decades, Hungarians from Transylvania participated in the western military campaigns. The coin, which has a serrated rim, was unearthed at Torda — the only such find in the Carpathian Basin — and once belonged to the collection of József Kemény.
The small but noteworthy communities implanted by the Bulgars in Transylvania did not even have the option of fleeing from the Hungarians, who came in overwhelming force. As the cemetery at Csombord testifies, they came under Hungarian rule but continued to use the burial ground into the early 10th century. Similarly, the Moravians, who fell under Hungarian rule a few years later, kept on burying their dead at Staré Mĕsto, Mikulčice, and other cemeteries. The Bulgars at Maroskarna, however, were supervised — as will be seen — by local, armed Hungarians.
With the emergence of the Árpád dynasty after Kurszán's death, a new clan became the repository of 'Turkia's second sovereignty'. There is no indication of the time when the ruling gyulas transferred their headquarters and residence to the middle Maros {1-285.} valley. The gyula must have been in charge of eastern and southern affairs, for he directed the raids against Byzantium in April 934 and April 943. The early phase of their 'independent' policy toward Byzantium is evoked by the Byzantine solidi and silver coins (left as gate-money for the afterworld, or sewn on garments as ornaments) that were found in Hungarian graves in the Maros-Tisza-Körös region.
In the Hun and Avar periods, ruling princes moved between their residences along the Maros valley, and recent excavations indicate that the gyulas did likewise. Their summer residence, which dates from the mid-900s, had by the end of the century become the capital of Transylvania's new rulers, complete with a Roman fort built of white stone, a round church, and a palace: the gyulas' Fehérvár (White Castle), or Gyulafehérvár.

Monastic and Mendicant Orders
By royal bequest, the Benedictine monasteries in Transdanubia and Upper Hungary received, from the start, a share of Transylvania's greatest natural treasure, salt, but they seldom reciprocated by sending monks to that region. Monasticism and its cultural influence were less in evidence in Transylvania than in other parts of the kingdom. Of the twelve Benedictine monasteries founded by royal fiat, only one was located in Transylvania, at Kolozsmonostor; another Benedictine monastery, at Meszes, was established by a prince. The Premonstratensian order had convents at Nagyszeben and Brassó, and the Cistercians a monastery at Kerc. Nor did the fashion for family monasteries catch on in {1-534.} Transylvania; the one clear example, at Gyerőmonostor, was already in ruins by the late 1200s. Harina may also have been a family monastery, and if Kraszna county is counted as part of Transylvania, then Ákos and Almás can be added to this list. As will be related in greater detail, monasticism and its mendicant variant were implanted late and haltingly in Transylvania. By the time the Saxons arrived, monasticism was on the decline throughout Europe, and they did not found any monastic institutions; indeed, the Saxons were so indifferent to this phenomenon that when the king bestowed on them the land and buildings of the nearby monastery at Kerc, they chose not to preserve its monastic function.
Monasticism was best represented in Transylvania by Kolozsmonostor. According to a charter issued by Béla IV, it had been founded by Béla I and endowed by King Ladislas (the Saint); however, in 1341, Queen Elisabeth claimed that the monastery had been founded by the latter. Recent excavation has unearthed the fragment of an arch (possibly the remnant of a round church) as well as coins from the time of Béla I and Romanesque stone figures. The monastery's original estate probably consisted of seven villages in the vicinity of Kolozsvár, most of which are noted in 13th-century charters. The monastery also acquired seven villages in Southern Transylvania, although these were the subjects of recurrent litigation with relatives of the aristocratic donors. These holdings gave the abbot of Kolozsmonostor the status of a lower-level Transylvanian aristocrat, but he was far less powerful than his rival, the bishop, who had come into possession of Gyalu. The bishop had no formal authority over the abbot; the two men engaged in recurrent — and not always voluntary — transfers of property and quarrelled openly. In 1220, Vilmos, the bishop of Transylvania, took over the monastery and had it torn down, destroyed the deeds of property, and had the abbot and his monks seized by the canon of Fehérvár. The monastery was rebuilt and pursued notarial activities {1-535.} while nurturing the Benedictine liturgy. A record of its library holdings, dating from 1427, lists fifty-four volumes; they mostly deal with liturgy, with not a single work on scholastic theology among them.
The monastery maintained excellent relations with the voivode and his deputy. Its notarial commissions came mainly from these officials, and only rarely from authorities in central Hungary. Most of the monks who performed notarial duties were educated members of Transylvanian noble families who had previously served as clerks to the deputy voivode or would do so later in life. The volume of notarial work grew to the point that in 1460, responsibility for this activity passed from the abbot to a lay governor. In 1518, Kolozsmonostor rallied to the Benedictine reform movement of Máté Tolnai, but this probably had little practical impact on the monastery, for there is no evidence that Abbot Tolnai sojourned there in the period leading up Battle of Mohács. Thus the main cultural contribution of this wealthy and well-staffed monastery lay in its legal and notarial activities.
It is impossible to assess the cultural impact of Transylvania's other Benedictine monastery, or of the Cistercian one at Kerc. The former, founded around 1120 by Prince Álmos, was located at the Transylvanian end of the Meszes Pass, and benefited from several royal grants that were confirmed in 1281 by Queen Elisabeth. The last reference to its abbot dates from 1288, and no physical trace has been found of the monastery. The Cistercian monastery was founded by King Imre around 1200; its ruins remain, but no record survives of its activities.
A more important cultural role was played by the Dominicans, Augustinians, and Franciscans, three preaching orders that were essentially town-based, being rooted in the struggle against urban heresies. In Hungary, the Christianization of the Cumanians was the work of Dominicans and of Franciscans, in the 13th and 14th centuries,



Monastic and Mendicant Orders
https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/89.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:28:30]
respectively. Kings and popes charged these orders with converting {1-536.} Balkan Bogumils as well as the Greek Orthodox in Hungary and the Balkans. As noted, they served as the ideological allies of the ruling strata in the struggle against Hussites, and, as will be seen, they played a role in relation to the Romanians as well. Their primary activity, which was also the most important from the point of view of Hungarian and Saxon culture, was preaching in the vernacular; alas, only Latin versions of their sermons survive, and that, only from outside Transylvania. Yet there is no doubt that they propagated the Marian cult, which left a legacy in the visual arts, and drew for their sermons on a wealth of folk tales that encompassed European, Moslem, and Indian motifs. Elements of the latter were absorbed into the folk tales and poetry of Transylvania's peoples. The Franciscans were particularly assiduous nurturing the cult of Hungarian saints; traces of this survive in the many depictions of St. Ladislas found in churches around the Székelyföld, and in the popular legends concerning that saint.
The Dominicans were the first of these orders to appear in Transylvania. Two of their monasteries, at Szeben and at Beszterce, were established prior to the Mongol invasion, and those at Segesvár, Szászsebes, Brassó, Gyulafehérvár, and Alvinc probably also date from the 13th century, for they are mentioned in sources dating from 1298–1323. Their monasteries at Kolozsvár and Udvarhely were founded in 1397 and 1524, respectively. The former became a major cultural force; its splendid Gothic library still stands. A library also survives from the Dominican college, the studium generale, founded in 1525 at Szeben; the institution was short-lived, for the Reformation had an early impact on the town. Another important Dominican library, that in Brassó, was destroyed by fire in the 17th century; the record of its holdings, over one hundred titles, offers a glimpse of the Transylvanian Dominicans' spiritual world, which was rooted in scholastic theology and manifested in preaching. That also applies to Franciscans and Augustinians, with the difference that these orders were less {1-537.} tied to the large towns, and more disposed to settle in rural market-centres, including Hungarian-inhabited towns — unlike the Dominicans, who preached mainly to the Saxons.
The Franciscans came to Transylvania only in the aftermath of the Mongol invasion; the first mention of their monastery at Beszterce dates from 1268. Their other monasteries, in Szászváros, Szeben, and Marosvásárhely were probably founded soon afterwards, and are noted in sources dating from 1300–16; a Franciscan school was established at Szászváros in the 14th century. The second phase of Franciscan expansion, in the early 1400s, saw the foundation of monasteries at Marosfelfalu, Fehéregyháza, Csíksomlyó, and Tövis — the latter two with the support of János Hunyadi, a noted patron of the Franciscans. Hunyadi also promoted the settlement in Transylvania of a more ascetic and resourceful branch of the Franciscans, the 'Observants', or 'Cseri friars', who had been active earlier in Southern Hungary. Their monastery at Hátszeg was founded some time before 1428, and in 1448 they created a monastic province separate from that of the 'Conventual' Franciscans. They then took over the above-noted four monasteries, which had been founded in the 15th century. Additional monasteries were provided for them by János Hunyadi at Vajdahunyad, and, in 1486, by King Matthias at Kolozsvár. In the early 1500s, the 'Observants' extended their activity to Medgyes and Brassó, in the Saxon region, and even to Bákó (Bacău) in Moldavia and Tergovistye (Tîrgovişte) in Wallachia. Some 'Observant' Franciscans supported the peasant rebellion of 1514; their Transylvanian provincial, András Dézsi, helped to recruit the crusaders. The Augustinians, for their part, had monasteries at Gyulafehérvár, Dés, and Torda.
The Dominican and Franciscan nuns and the Beguine sisterhood also deserve attention. The first convents were established in the 14th century (Szászváros, 1334), and at the end of the 15th century they rivalled monasteries in number. There were Dominican {1-538.} nuns in Brassó, Beszterce, Kolozsvár, Segesvár, and Szeben, and Beguines in Szeben, Brassó, Marosvásárhely, Kolozsvár, Tövis, Beszterce, Csíksomlyó, Fehéregyháza, Marosfelfalu, and Medgyes. Nuns and Beguines played an indirect but important role in the cultivation of the mother tongue, for they did not learn Latin, and thus had to have their devotional material translated by monks into the vernacular, with additional copies sometimes made by the nuns themselves. There are records of nuns in Transylvania who specialized in such transcription, and a number the nuns' Hungarian-language codices survive, all dating from the early 16th century. One of them, known as the 'Teleki codex', was written by Franciscan friars for their 'sisters of the third order', the Beguines of Marosvásárhely, who produced some additional copies; the work presented, in Hungarian translation, lives of the saints and the latter's meditations. A similar work, the 'Lázár codex' from Marosvásárhely, was drafted for the edification of a certain szesztra (Sister) Katalin. The 'Székelyudvarhely codex' was written in 1526 by a Franciscan educated in Cracow, András Nyújtódi, 'out of fraternal affection for his sister', a certain szesztra Judit in Tövis; it contains a Hungarian translation of the Biblical book of Judith.

The value of these late codices is all the greater since no trace remains of earlier religious works, even in Latin, by Transylvania's monks. Of the manuscripts produced by monastic orders in Hungary prior to 1350, forty-two have survived, but none of them originated in Transylvania. From 1350 onward, Transylvanian monasteries rapidly increased their collections of codices, as did the worldly clergy, especially the bishops, canons, and archdeacons. Of these collections, over four hundred items, dating from before 1526, survive; to be sure, only some were produced in Transylvania, and very few are actually the work of Transylvanian authors. The codex that once belonged to Bishop Domokos Kálmáncsehi is an Italian masterpiece. (The 100-volume collection of another bishop, the humanist Ferenc Várday, included many similar {1-539.} Italian works.) A breviary, copied by a Franciscan friar at Marosvásárhely in 1522, is one of the few surviving items that can be positively attributed to a Transylvanian source.

1. FROM THE EASTERN HUNGARIAN KINGDOM TO THE PRINCIPALITY OF TRANSYLVANIA
A State is Born
'Prince' John Sigismund and 'Voivode' Stephen Báthori
Political developments in the decades after 1556 bore great similarity to those between 1526 and 1551. King Ferdinand reacted belligerently to Isabella's return, and the war lasted, with occasional pauses, until the mid-1570s.
In 1557, the aristocrats in the Upper-Tisza region who rallied to the House of Szapolyai gained control of the most important royal fortresses, those at Várad, Huszt, and Tokaj. Only Gyula and Világos managed to hold out. Two counter-attacks by General Puchaim brought only minor successes, in Zemplén county. Isabella's realm once again extended as far as Kassa. However, at the end of 1557, thanks mainly to the efforts of the captain-general {1-633.} of Upper Hungary, Imre Telekessy, the initiative passed to Ferdinand's supporters.
After 31 January 1559, when King Ferdinand concluded an armistice with the Ottomans, the fighting became less intense in Transylvania, but the lull was short-lived. The death of Queen Isabella on 15 November set off a new wave of hostilities. Kassa's captain-general, Ferenc Zay, persuaded Menyhárt Balassa, Isabella's captain-general for Hungary, to change sides. This notorious act of betrayal was followed by many aristocrats from the UpperTisza region. As a result, by the end of 1561, Gyulafehérvár's effective authority did not reach beyond the counties of Bihar and Máramaros counties — with one noteworthy, and more distant exception, Munkács castle. Over the next few years, a few castles — notably Szatmár, Tokaj, and Nagybánya — did change hands, but the fighting brought no major territorial change. On two occasions, after the forces of 'John II' were defeated at Hadad on 4 March 1562, and during General Schwendi's offensive in the summer of 1565, it seemed that the Habsburg camp might threaten the survival of the Szapolyai state. By 1566, the sultan's armies were once again on the move in Hungary, and the new Habsburg monarch, Maximilian I (1564-1576), learned the same lesson as his father: the fortunes of war in Hungary could always be altered by the Ottomans' military might. In 1566, Suleiman the Magnificent lost his life in the siege of Szigetvár. In 1567, the brave Schwendi managed to invest Munkács. Finally, on 17 February 1568, a peace treaty was signed at Adrianople (Drinápoly), bringing two and a half decades of relative calm to war-weary Hungary; the treaty had the effect of turning any attempt against the Szapolyais into a risky provocation.
Hostilities ceased during the ensuing diplomatic parleys. On 10 March 1571, Emperor Maximilian got Transylvania's lords to ratify the Speyer peace treaty. The terms of that treaty applied only to the Szapolyai dynasty, and John Sigismund died on March 14, but when Stephen (István) Báthori was chosen to succeed him, {1634.} Maximilian dared not to intervene directly. He did try indirectly to alter the course of events in Transylvania by turning a blind eye to the activities of Kassa's captain-general, Johann Rueber. When Gáspár Bekes, who contested the Hungarian throne and colluded with Vienna, was defeated on 10 July 1575 at Kerelőszentpál, this kind of covert intervention came to an end.
The latest, bloody wars had shifted the battlefront eastward, but otherwise produced no clear-cut results. The situation was reminiscent of that before György Fráter's demise. There is a striking, and almost tragicomic, similarity between the protracted peace talks that ran concurrent with the fighting and the course of events prior to 1551.
The Speyer Treaty, much like the earlier Várad accord, endorsed the principle of a united Hungary. To be sure, 'John II' surrendered the title of king that he had received from his father and György Fráter, and contented himself with being qualified Prince (princeps, Fürst) 'John Sigismund', a title that could be passed on to his male heirs. The treaty provided that if he abdicated or lost his realm, he would receive as compensation the Silesian principalities of Oppeln and Ratibor. The Speyer Treaty was to be kept strictly secret. The stillborn Szatmár accord, signed by John Sigismund and Maximilian in 1565, was also supposed to be kept secret, but the emperor had divulged it to the Sublime Porte in the hope that fear of Turkish retaliation would bring the Transylvanians to heel — much as his father had done in 1540. But the case of the Speyer Treaty, Maximilian abided by the provision of secrecy.



'Prince' John Sigismund and 'Voivode' Stephen Báthori
https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/103.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:28:41]
The new state's international status remained marked by uncertainty even after the conclusion of the Speyer Treaty. Only the Porte, Poland, and France had recognized the sovereignty of Isabella and, later, of John Sigismund. The state had no name. Its rulers adopted the title of Hungarian King: Isabella's formal qualification was 'Queen of Hungary', and that of John Sigismund, 'John II, elected King of Hungary'. For a long time, Stephen {1-635.} Báthori was acknowledged abroad (except in Istanbul) simply as voivode. France's occasional offers of assistance were insubstantial, and of little consequence, although in 1555–56, Paris was actively involved in facilitating Isabella's return. The Romanian principalities served mainly to put external pressure on Transylvania. In 1556, the rulers of Moldavia and Wallachia, Alexandru Lăpuşneanu and Pătraşcu, acted on Turkish instructions to attack Transylvania, thus facilitating Péter Petrovics's venture. On the other hand, in 1561, Jakab Heraklides — of Greek origin, he had benefited from the Habsburgs' help to become Moldavia's voivode, and came to the known as the 'despotic voivode' (Despot vodă) — gave assistance to Balassa and his associates in their rebellion.
The Ottomans' attitude toward Hungary remained unaltered. They considered that Eastern Hungary was essentially in their domain, and that those who ruled there did so on sufferance. Accordingly, the sultan would exact tribute and insist that the Hungarian ruler could govern only after he had the sultan's assent, which in written form was called an athname. Suleiman's athname for John II was couched in exactly the same terms as the letter of alliance sent to King John in February 1528. When Stephen Báthori was elected, the Porte's emissary, a Hungarian renegade named Amhát, was waiting in the wings with a firman that had been drafted in Istanbul and which the prescient Ottomans had already addressed to Báthori. The text was new, and the tone commanding, but the essence was the same:
'Stephen Báthori, Transylvania's voivode! [...] Transylvania has been under my protection for a long time. I regard it in the same way as my other possessions, and give it the same protection against all enemies. My will is that all feudal lords, officials, fortresses, towns, palaces, fortifications, villages, provinces, prisons, and municipalities be kept in the same state and order as before; whatever belongs to {1-636.} Transylvania, whether in Hungary or Transylvania, belongs to my empire [...]
Therefore, exercising my authority, I grant to you, in accordance with your loyalty toward me, the country of Transylvania. [...]
In keeping with your loyalty toward me, you must be at one with your lords and reach peaceful agreement with them. [...]
'You must always act in concert with the beglerbeys of Buda and Temesvár, and thereby prevent the enemy from deceiving you.'[9]
Within these guidelines, the Ottomans continued to allow their Hungarian vassals to govern themselves freely. Their policy regarding Transylvania was driven by a single, and realizable objective: to prevent the reunification of Hungary. As long as the Szapolyai dynasty, and, later, Stephen Báthori and his successors avoided taking any steps in that direction, they were free to do as they wished.
When, in 1565, Vienna divulged to the Porte the secret of its agreement with John Sigismund, the young 'elected king' decided to personally pay his respects to the sultan and convince the latter, much as his father had done thirty years before, of his loyalty. Construing the attacks on Transylvania to be a breach of the peace treaty, the sultan led an army against Hungary. When John Sigismund hastened to Belgrade to meet the sultan, he was handed the above-noted athname. The Ottomans' punitive campaign touched only Habsburg Hungary; Szigetvár fell, and so did royal Hungary's last strongholds in the eastern Great Plain, at Gyula, Világos, and Jenő.
Everyone understood the full portent of the Ottoman reprisals. The Ottomans aimed to conquer Hungary, and the goodwill that they professed toward Gyulafehérvár was no more than a tactical element in their strategy. Occasionally, as a great favour, they would throw back a crumb from their booty. Thus, in 1554, {1-637.} Petrovics got Lugos and Karánsebes, and, a few years later, the small fort at Deszni, Zaránd county, was returned to John Sigismund. None of this stopped the Ottomans from pressing their claim (much as in 1546–51) to Transylvania's major border forts, at Lugos, Sebes, Várad, Kereki and Sarkad — in 1556–57, when Ferenc Bebek was intriguing against Isabella, and subsequently, when Gáspár Bekes responded positively in the hope of winning their support.
The disappearance of the Szapolyai dynasty led to a palpable change in the Ottomans' policy toward Transylvania.

https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/103.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:28:41]
At first sight, the change did not seem significant, for it did not affect basic principles. In March 1572, Sultan Selim II (1566–1574) solemnly notified Stephen Báthori that he recognized the latter as successor to King John and John Sigismund, thus as a ruler with full royal prerogatives. But even at the time, the more vigilant observers saw an ill omen in the Porte's attempt to expand the frontier zone — taxed by both sides — at the expense of Transylvania. Another, ostensibly minor change was that the sultan's court officials, from chief pashas down to interpreters, began to demand personal gifts of greater value than before. Sometimes, they merely evoked a practice dating from the 'late King John', but at other times, they brazenly demanded that the gifts match the value of those flowing in from the two Romanian principalities. The Ottomans showed their true colours in 1576, when Murad III acceded to the throne and not only reiterated a demand for the border fortresses but also increased by 5000 forints the annual tribute from Transylvania. Báthori did not have the slightest intention of raising a protest, and even so, he was sent a reminder that the Porte could have got greater benefits if it had chosen to support Gáspár Bekes.
In fact, the former pretender Gáspár Bekes had gone into exile, and a few years later, he would do battle in Poland as Báthori's bravest general. However, from that time onward, the sultan would routinely hold in reserve, in Istanbul, an alternative candidate for {1-638.} prince of Transylvania. From 1580 to the time of the Fifteen-Years' War, this shameful role was played by renegade Hungarian aristocrat, Pál Márkházi. Thus Transylvania was being prepared for the servitude that characterized the Romanian voivodeships, and the Ottomans exploited every opportunity move closer to that objective.
Báthori did all in his power to prevent such opportunities from arising. He paid the higher tribute, made sure that the troops in the border forts stayed clear of Turkish territory, and pursued the Moldavian voivode, Bogdan, when the latter was exiled by the Ottomans.
Clearly, the development of Eastern Hungary, now called Transylvania, remained constrained by the interests and demands of its two mighty neighbours. And yet, its history took a significantly different turn after 1556.

White and Black Hungarians 2. FROM THE HUNGARIAN CONQUEST TO THE
MONGOL INVASION The Székelys in Transylvania
{1-406.} Royal Counties in Transylvania
Once he had extended his rule to Transylvania, King St. Stephen formed royal counties — coinciding with deaconries — in the region between the Nagy-Szamos and Maros rivers. South of the Maros, the former domain of the gyula Prokuj became a royal estate. The 14th-century version of the 'Old Gesta'[8] relates that after taking the gyula captive, King St. Stephen 'put in charge his great-grandfather (proavus) Zoltán, who became the inheritor of those Transylvanian territories, and thus came to be known simply as Zoltán Erdőelvi (Erdeelui) [i.e Zoltán of Erdély = Transylvania]. He was a very old man who had survived into the time of the sainted king and wanted to rule over prosperous peoples.' His name was given to a fortification called Zoltángyepűje as well as to two villages called Zoltán, in the Olt bend. Initially, this territory constituted a huge 'Fehér' ('white') province, administered by a voivode generally selected from among the lords in the king's entourage. Sources from 1111 and 1113 identify this governor as Mercurius princeps ultrasilvanus, and the reference in 1097 to a Mercurio comes Bellegratae probably indicates the same titleholder, which means that he was also count of Fehérvár (Belgrade). The title voivode (voivoda in Latin) appears in documents only at the end of the 12th century; earlier sources, dating from 1177 and 1183, refer to the ispán (count) of Fehérvár. There are two subsequent references (in 1200 and 1201) to the voivode being also the count of Fehérvár; thereafter, only the title 'voivode' appears. Not infrequently, one man was the count of several counties; thus, in 1214, the voivode Gyula, of the Kán clan, was also the count of Szolnok county. However, this does not signify that Transylvania had been unified in terms of administration. For instance, in 1201, Gyula was both voivode and count of Fehérvár, but a certain Marton served as count of Szolnok, and records show that again, in 1220, different persons held offices of voivode and count of Szolnok. When, in {1-407.} 1227, King Andrew II put his son (later King Béla IV) in charge of Transylvania, with the title of 'junior king', the whole of Szolnok county (which extended as far as the Tisza and included a northern strip of Transylvania) was excluded from Béla's remit; Andrew's charters always included the count of Szolnok, and those of Béla, the voivode of Transylvania.
For a time, documentary listings of high offices included the counts of Doboka (1164) and Kolozs (1177, 1183, 1201), who were mentioned each time in conjunction with the voivode and the count of Fehérvár; then the counts were subordinated to the voivode, and the title disappeared from these lists. Torda, mainly because of its location, was the first county to come under the direct authority of the voivode; although there is a mention of its castle as early as 1075, its count (perhaps only by accidental omission) is never noted in royal charters. In contrast, until the early 13th century, the counts of Doboka and Kolozs were considered equal in rank to the voivode, who also governed the county of Fehérvár. All of Transylvania was finally brought under the voivode's rule in 1263, when he acquired responsibility for the county of Szolnok. Thereafter, the counts of Transylvania's seven counties including the newly-created counties of Küküllő (its castle was first mentioned in 1177, and its count in 1214), Hunyad, and Belső-Szolnok (carved out of Szolnok county) — were subordinate to the voivode.
Thus the authority of the voivode, who originally governed southern Transylvania, was extended north of the Maros only in the 13th century. This was because the harmonization of the two legal systems — that of the clans whose ancestors had been the original settlers, and that of the ruling prince and king — made slow progress in the newly-formed royal counties of northern Transylvania. The notables of the clans north of the Maros took some time to become integrated with the upper stratum of royal officials. First in rank among the latter were certain court officials, notably the count palatine (udvarispán, comes palatii), court judge (udvarbíró, comes or {1-408.} iudex curiae), and lord chief treasurer (tárnokmester, magister tavernicorum), and the counts. Next came the 'castle warriors' (várjobbágyok, iobagiones castri), responsible for the military and economic administration of the county castles; they included castellans (várnagy, castellani), judicial deputies of the counts (udvarbíra, comites curiae), and the commanders of platoons and companies (decurionatus, centurionatus). At the bottom of this scale was a large number of royal servants, mostly indigenous Slavs, with a sprinkling of Hungarians: the court stewards (udvarnok, udvornici) and the agricultural and maintenance workers around the castle (várnép, castrenses, civiles). The latter were bound to their jobs, unlike the immigrant 'guests' (vendég, hospites) who began to arrive in



Royal Counties in Transylvania
https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/70.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:28:52]
Hungary in the 12th century; they performed similar economic functions, but benefited from some privileges. On private estates, there lived a category of agricultural workers (known in Hungarian as 'ín') who used the master's implements and were virtually his slaves. In the course of the 12th century, most of them acquired the status of libertinus: though still bound to their master, they farmed for themselves.
The royal counties were administrative districts where all the inhabitants — descendants of original settlers and newcomers, free landowners and servants — came under the judicial and military authority of the count or the voivode. The counts were entitled to one third of the revenue generated by the people attached to the castles; although, particularly outside Transylvania, many counts also had private estates, the 'count's third' was their main source of income. Only royal residences lay beyond the count's authority; they were administered separately, and the king disposed freely of the staff and revenues. In Transylvania, as in the rest of Hungary, there were royal estates and residences reserved for the king and queen. There are few traces of such properties in Transylvania, for early documents are scarce, and the estates were subsequently given away or became the property of privileged settlers. The {1-409.} queen's onetime estates include, south of the Maros, (Magyar)lapád (granted by Queen Gizella to the Abbot of Bakonybél) and the neighbouring Asszonynépe (given away in 1177); as well as (Sajó) udvarhely, which was also given away, and (Székely)udvarhely, which became the main centre of the Székelys.
The soldiers, craftsmen, and ploughmen of the royal and castle estates came not only from the ranks of the Hungarian clans that had agreed to serve the king or from among the indigenous Slavs; settlers were brought in by the central government from other regions of Hungary. Selected on the basis of his loyalty and reliability, the typical settler was a Hungarian who, after the establishment of the monarchy and the disintegration of the tribal system, had sought his fortune in the service of the king. King St. Stephen employed these remnants of ancient tribes on royal estates and in counties throughout the country, which is how fragments of the Jenő and Keszi tribes ended up in Transylvania's Szamos valley, and how groups from the Megyer tribe settled on the right bank of the Maros; the evidence lies in the three places, noted earlier, that were named after the tribes. No doubt many other settlements were founded in this fashion, but their names are not as indicative, for the sense of tribal identity had mostly disappeared by that time. To concentrate the settlements and induce a more intensive pattern of production, King St. Stephen decreed that groups of ten villages or fewer must erect a church. At the end of the 11th century, King Ladislas (who, like Stephen, attained sainthood) forbade villagers to move far from their church and, wanting to put an end to pagan burials, ordered that all funerals be conducted next to the church.
The property structure and public administration in Transylvania were adapted to Hungarian practice. The early 13th-century record of ordeals by fire in Várad discloses a wealth of information about the organization of Transylvania's counties and the social structure. It reveals that, slowly but surely, Transylvania was moving into the mainstream of Hungarian development. Since {1-410.} the population of the regions that had not been occupied by Hungarian clans included many Slavs, it is likely that at first, other ethnic groups account for a considerable proportion of the new county society, high and low. However, as a growing number of free Hungarians entered the king's service, the Hungarians came to enjoy a numerical superiority. The names of 'castle warrior' (várjobbágy) and castle servant (várszolga) found in 13th-century documents indicate that most of them were Hungarians. Clan notables who rallied to the king became integrated with the older monarchist elite, and, by the 13th century, the term nemes ('noble') was applied to all freeholders, regardless of whether they had inherited property from the original settlers or acquired it by royal grant.
However, a rather different situation emerged south of the Maros and Aranyos rivers. The county-type structure, governed by a voivode, was established only along the lower reaches of the Küküllő rivers and around the Maros at Gyulafehérvár, giving rise eventually to the counties of Fehér, Hunyad, and Küküllő. There are no toponyms that indicate the settlement of tribal soldiers, and only a few evoke castle people (Bocsár = pohárnok ['cup-bearer'], Haró = szakács ['cook']). Most of Transylvania's Slavs came to be concentrated in this region during the rule of the gyulas. It was here, as well as in a region northeast of the original clans' settlements and also inhabited, though more sparsely, by Slavs, that big landowners from other parts of Hungary began to acquire estates in the early 13th century. By then, the royal county structure in Hungary was disintegrating, the counties' land was being parcelled out, and the waves of this transformation touched Transylvania as well. Estates were granted primarily to aristocrats who had come from Hungary to assume high offices in Transylvania. The earliest known royal grant is that of King Béla III to an ancestor of the Wass and Aczél families. When Mihály, a member of the Kacsics family from Upper Hungary, served as a voivode in Transylvania (1209–12), he and his brother Simon (a bán, and in



Royal Counties in Transylvania
https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/70.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:28:52]
1215 a voivode) {1-411.} received a large grant of land in eastern Kolozs county. Owing to ban Simon's disloyalty, some of this property was transferred in 1228 to Dénes, of the Tomaj clan (chief treasurer, then voivode in 123334), who became the founder of his family's Transylvanian, Bánffy branch. It is likely that Gyula, a member of the Transdanubian Kán clan, also received his estate on the Küküllő during his tenure as voivode (1201 and 1214). However, before 1300, Transylvania's voivodes were not able to consolidate their personal power, for their terms of office lasted no more than one to four years. Benedek, son of Korlát, became voivode in 1202, handed the office to someone else in 1206, then served as voivode again between 1207 and 1209. Between 1212 and 1226, the post changed hands every year. To be sure, this pattern allowed a fair number of Hungarian families to acquire estates in Transylvania. The count Kökényes, whose family, the Kökényes-Radnót, were of French origin, had been a landowner in Nógrád county, and some time before 1228 he acquired a large estate at Teke, near that of the Kacsics family. The Becse-Gergely, Ákos and Hermány clans moved to Transylvania in the second half of the 13th century. The first of these owned estates along the Nagy-Szamos and Küküllő rivers; their descendants include Bethlen, Apafi, and Somkeréki Erdélyi families, all of which would play a major role in the history of Transylvania. The Ákos clan's Thoroczkai branch owned properties in Torda county, and its Illyei and Folti branches in Hunyad county, on the right bank of the Maros; near the latter lay the estates of the Hermány clan, which later broke up into a number of families belonging to the lesser nobility. In the 14th century, one of the Hermány clan's branches, the Lackfi, rose to be one of the country's most prestigious families, and for decades they played a dominant role in Transylvania.
It is striking that all of these early estates were peripheral, situated at the foot of forested mountain ranges. It appears that the king settled these aristocrats in the more sparsely-populated regions {1-412.} of Transylvania so that they would take over the tasks of the royal counts. The new landowners rose to this challenge, if only out of selfinterest, and their promotion of settlement resulted in the creation of numerous villages. They had probably brought along some people from their estates in other parts of Hungary to settle in the manorial seats and valley villages, but they also invited German, Romanian, and Russian immigrants to populate lands that were left deserted after the Mongol invasion.
Toponyms of an early Hungarian type attest, along with the admittedly sparse documentary sources, that by the middle of the 13th century, the royal and private estates in Transylvania formed a block of predominantly Hungarian ethnic settlement. There were, within this block, patches of German and Slavic settlement, of earlier and later origin, as well as areas of beech and pine forests that lacked undergrowth for grazing animals. In the Middle Ages, the northern boundary of Hungarian settlement was marked by the valleys of the Nagy-Szamos and Szamos rivers; it remains a linguistic boundary to this day; the town of Dés and the salt-mine at Désakna are noted in documents dating from the early 13th century. In the east, Hungarian settlements must have reached the Sajó valley by the end of the 12th century, for the Hungarian village Sajószent-andrás is noted in a charter dating from the reign of Béla III (1172–1196). Farther to the southeast, where the Maros emerges from the highlands, lie Vécs castle and the nearby villages of Lövér and Magyaró, which are all mentioned in a document from 1228; the district still marks the northeastern boundary of the Hungarian ethnic presence in Transylvania.
In the southeast, Hungarian settlements extended to the Olt bend by the end of the 12th century; the evidence lies in village names mentioned in early 13th-century documents (e.g. Halmágy, Sáros, Báránykút, Hévíz, Sárkány, and Barót). The original Hungarian names of today's Szászváros and Szászsebes, in the southwest, were mentioned in 1224, but by that time Hungarian settlements {1-413.} had extended well into the Sztrigy valley, at the centre of the later Hunyad county. The western boundary of Hungarian settlement ran along the line of beech forests; the villages of Gyalu and Esküllő, which lie near these forests in the northwest, are mentioned by Anonymus. There are references in 1206 to Magyarigen — a village on the right bank of the Maros that by then had a Saxon population but which, judging from its name, must have been previously inhabited by Hungarians — and, in 1219, to Hungarian villages around Miriszló. The land encompassed by these boundaries accounts for almost all of Transylvania — apart from the peripheral forested areas that were and remain sparsely populated — and, until the middle of the 12th century, it was inhabited by an integrated community of Hungarians as well as some Slavs who were on the brink of full assimilation.
By 1200, Hungarian settlements could be found in all districts other than the forested areas, and it is safe to say that the origin of most villages in today's Transylvania can be traced back at least to the 13th century. A few examples should suffice. Asszonynépe and the surrounding hamlets — Magyarbénye, Kisakna, Vadverem

https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/70.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:28:52]
(originally Szokmánd), Magyarlapád, Fugad, Háporton, and Oláhtor-dos — in today's Alsó-Fehér county already existed in 1177. A document dating from 1206 lists seven neighbouring villages, bearing German or Hungarian names, in the Szászföld: Voldorf (Kozdfő), Lebnek, Kóbor, Felmér, Sáros, Réten, and Báránykút. The same seven villages are found today, with no new settlement between them. Thus the pattern of settlement in these districts acquired a lasting shape by the end of the 12th century. A few similar cases could be cited, but the sources are very sparse, for the registration of property in Hungary began only around the end of the 12th century. In any case, it is safe to assume that the density of settlement revealed in the above examples was replicated in nearby districts.
If, under the voivode's authority, the core of the early Fehér county was situated at the mouth of the Küküllő River, how did {1-414.} Hungarian settlements reach as far as the Olt River, and how did Germans come to settle along the middle reaches of the Küküllő? The answer to these questions must await an examination of the military frontier region, which was separate and distinct from the county system, as well as of the pattern of settlement of the Székelys, Saxons, and Romanians in Transylvania.

Saxon Settlement and the Reorganization of the Southern Border Defences
The Székelys in Transylvania
The Székelys, a Hungarian tribe, played a central part in the settlement of Transylvania's southern and eastern frontier districts. The 11th-century chronicle, and Anonymus as well as later chroniclers who drew selectively on this source, are unanimous in maintaining that when the Hungarians arrived in the Carpathian Basin, they encountered Székelys, the descendants of Attila's Huns. All through the Middle Ages, references to the Székelys identify them as a distinct ethnic group (natio Siculica) related to the Hungarians. Indeed, some evidence supports the contention that the Székelys who joined the Hungarians were a Turkic tribe of nomadic horsemen, with its own ruling class: their military and social structure was similar to that of the Oguz-Turks (6 leading clans, each with four branches), and they retained their light cavalry tactics long after the Hungarian army had adopted westernstyle heavy cavalry. These features seem to confirm the 11th century legends, but some other factors induce caution.
To our knowledge, the Hungarians were the only people that had not only a Turkic social structure, but also a deeply-rooted Finno-Ugric language that, while preserving some Turkic loan-words, survived Turkic linguistic influence and remained the Hungarians' common tongue. And the only information we have concerning the Székely people indicates that they spoke the same Finno-Ugric tongue. The names of their clans, clan branches, and social units are of Hungarian origin, as are all the toponyms they {1-415.} applied in their area of settlement. In the late Middle Ages, the Székelys still used a runic alphabet, of Central Asian origin, that had once served to record Turkic texts; of the 37 characters in this alphabet, 21 are of ancient Turkic, 3 of ancient Greek, and 3 are of Glagolitic (Slavic) origin. The latter include signs for the sounds 'f', 'h', 'ly' and 'c', absent from Turkic languages but present in Finno-Ugric Hungarian.
Thus even if the Székelys once spoke a Turkic tongue, they must have given it up in favour of Hungarian at an early date. The Székely dialect contains no more Bulgaro-Turkish loan-words from before the Hungarian conquest than does standard Hungarian. Such total linguistic assimilation could not have occurred after the Székelys settled in Transylvania, for they lived in the southern and eastern border districts and had contact with Hungarian communities only in the north and the east. In the event that they were not yet settled in Transylvania at the time of the Hungarian conquest, they must have moved there no later than the early 11th century; for if, in the 11th century, the Székelys had not been already located at the eastern fringe of Hungarian lands, their pattern of settlement would be just as dispersed as that of the seven Hungarian tribes. In contrast to the Hungarians, the Székelys preserved not only the clans' property rights but also administrative and judicial institutions that united each clan; this remained in effect all through the Middle Ages, and, formally, until 1848.
In light of these contradictory indications, it is not surprising that there are two schools of thought concerning the Székelys' origins and their settlement in Transylvania. Some archaeologists and historians believe that the Székelys were Hungarians, or at least an Onogur-Bulgar tribe closely related to the Hungarians, and that they were drawn by the Avars (who identified with the Huns, and were regarded as such by contemporary Europeans, hence the Székely-Hun link) into the Carpathian Basin, where they preserved their ethnic identity until the Hungarian conquest. According to a {1-416.} recent variant of this thesis, Hungarians and Székelys settled among the Avars in the Carpathian Basin at the end of the 7th century, bringing with them a decorative tradition known as the 'griffin and tendril' style.
On the other hand, most Hungarian linguists, along with some historians who draw on the latter's findings, maintain that the Székelys were of Turkic origin, possessed a Turkic culture, and had joined up with the Hungarians prior to the conquest. Thus the Székelys had been largely assimilated by the time they and the Hungarian tribes reached the Carpathian Basin in the late 9th century. Advocates of this thesis once sought the ancestors of the Székelys among the 'Eskil' Bulgars who cohabited with Hungarians on the Pontic steppes; although the thesis was challenged on etymological grounds, it still wins some scholarly support.



The Székelys in Transylvania
https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/71.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:29:03]
The date of the Székelys' arrival in Transylvania is also a matter of debate. One important aspect of this problem is that while the bulk of Székely settlements was located in Transylvania, there were others in southern, western, and northern Hungary, as well as in Bihar county and around Nagyvárad. Now, when other tribes joined up with eastern, nomadic peoples, the latter usually compelled them to serve as an advance guard (indeed, as late as the 15th century, the Hungarian army's advance guard consisted of Székelys). In light of this, and of the pattern of Székely settlement, Hungarian historians are tending to the conclusion that the bulk of Székelys settled in Bihar county; toponyms and written sources suggest that prior to the 13th century, and leaving aside Transylvania, this region had the largest number of Székely settlements. Then, continuing to serve as border guards, the Székelys were transferred in the early 11th century to Transylvania.
According to a legend recorded by Constantine Porphyrogenetos, the Kabars, whose three tribes belonged to the Khazar people, rebelled and allied themselves with the Hungarians. As noted, {1-417.} Anonymus believed that the inhabitants of the Bihar region were Khazars; he relates that Árpád's youngest son, Zolta, married the daughter of the Khazar leader Ménmarót and subsequently inherited the land ruled by his father-in-law. By linking this legend to King St. Stephen's first Transylvanian voivode, 'Zoltán Erdőelvi', one can hypothesise that the Székelys were none other than the Kabars (i.e. Khazars); in the mid-900s, Constantine Porphyrogenetos recorded that the latter spoke not only their mother tongue (Bulgaro-Turkish) but also the (Finno-Ugric) language of the Hungarians. Their stay in Bihar would explain why they had become linguistically assimilated by the time they were led by 'Zoltán Erdőelvi' into Transylvania and settled between the Maros and the Olt. The central settlement in their new home was named Telegd, after one of their clans; and there is a Telegd in Bihar county as well. The toponyms Ábrány and Jenő might also have been the names of clans that earlier resided in Bihar.
One of these theories regarding the origins of the Székelys may benefit from new information and emerge the winner, but one thing is clear: the bulk of the Székely people has been in Transylvania since at least the early 11th century, when their settlements lay south of the Maros and extended to the mountain frontier in the east and south. If today's Székely region does not coincide with the area of original settlement, that is because the Székelys spread out into a part of the southern frontier zone where Saxons would eventually settle, and, in the 13th century, they moved into the Háromszék Basin as well. Evidence for this is found in the names of the Sepsi (i.e. Sebesi), Kézdi, and Orbai székek (a term that means 'seats' and was used to designate military-administrative districts in the border-guard zones of feudal Hungary), which were later united under the name Háromszék ('three seats'). These district names generally evoke a specific locality, but no villages bear the names within the confines of the three seats. However, all three names can be found farther west, in an area where Saxons settled {1-418.} in the 13th century: (Szász)sebes, (Szász)orbó, and (Szász)kézd. With regard to Szászsebes, there is documentary evidence that Székelys lived there before 1224, when King Andrew II granted it to the Saxons, and it can be assumed that the other two toponyms also evoke a Székely presence. Medgyes and its district also must have had a Székely population before the latter was displaced eastward by Saxons, who moved in during the second half of the 13th century; this is clear from the fact that, for a long time, the district came under the jurisdiction of the count of the Székelys, who was appointed by the king to govern the Székelys. Since Medgyes bears the name of a Székely clan, it may have been one of their original settlements.
In sum, before the 13th century, the Székely-inhabited region stretched from today's Szászváros (another district with toponymic traces of early Székely settlers) in a broad swath, eastward to the Olt bend, and northward to the Maros. In the west and in the north, the Székelys settled in proximity to the Hungarians of the Maros valley; in the south and in the east, they settled on the right bank of the Olt and around the upper reaches of the Maros River and the Küküllő rivers. In the Barcaság, they joined forces with the Pecheneg border guards (who were probably there earlier) to protect the southern and eastern frontier; to defend the Carpathian mountain passes, the king had raised earthworks at Salgó, Pétervár (near today's Szászcsór), Talmács, Halmágy, Miklósvár, Bálványos, Görgény, and Vécs. The early origin of these earthworks is indicated by the fact that their districts, including the villages, retained the status of royal lands even after they were settled by Székelys and Saxons had settled around them; although these districts were surrounded by full-fledged Székely and Saxon settlement areas, for administrative purposes they were attached to Fehér and Torda counties.
Throughout the Middle Ages, the Székelys retained a social structure that was typical of Bulgar-Turkish peoples, and which {1-419.} was essentially identical to the Hungarians' social structure prior to King St. Stephen's reforms. The king's appointee, the Székely count, took over responsibility for only the most important political issues. In

Hungary, the clan chiefs lost their political function when the king and his representatives took control of judicial and military affairs; in the Székely lands, local officials continued to function as the agents of local autonomy. In accordance with a rigid system of rotation between the six clans (each with four branches), a new judge (iudex) and military commander (capitaneus) were appointed each year. These posts were hereditary within a few prominent families and carried considerable emoluments as well as a larger share of the Székelys' collective resources. As a result, Székely society became stratified in terms of wealth, but it remained free of feudal relationships; by birthright, all Székelys were freemen, with the right and obligation to be soldiers in case of war, and entitled to a reasonable share of the commonly-held land. Later, this status was confirmed by the qualification nemes (noble).
Among Hungarians, it was the Székelys who preserved the longest the system of rotating flocks from pasture to pasture. At first, they paid their taxes in horses (like the Bulgar-Turks of the steppes); even in the 13th century, they paid taxes only for their livestock, and in kind (ökörsütés = ox-roast). This was their only tax, and it was tantamount to a gift, for they only paid it on special royal occasions, such as the coronation or wedding of the king, or upon the birth of the king's first son.
As noted earlier, the Székely army consisted of light cavalry even after the majority of the Hungarian army had changed over to heavy cavalry. The 12th-century variant of the 'Old Gesta' relates the Székelys' peculiar, nomadic fighting tactics, which consisted of rapid surprise attacks and fake retreats that turned into ambushes; the chronicler, being more familiar with the stalwart defence put up by heavy cavalry, construed these tactics as signs of cowardice. Since warriors had to provide their own equipment, the Székelys {1-420.} stuck to light cavalry, for even after they began to shift from grazing to cultivation, they — unlike noble landowners — could not afford the costly armour and weaponry required for heavy cavalry. As a result of reforms that were applied in Transylvania in the 12th century, the Székelys found themselves deprived of much of their pasture-land, and most of them became smallholders who cultivated the land with the help of their household.

The Székelys in Transylvania 2. FROM THE HUNGARIAN CONQUEST TO THE
MONGOL INVASION The 'Land of the Romanians'
Saxon Settlement and the Reorganization of the Southern Border Defences
During the Hungarian kingdom's first 150 years of existence, the political importance of Transylvania was overshadowed by other priorities. Hungary's kings successfully fought off German and Polish pressures and, at the end of the 11th century, began to concentrate on the goal of securing a route to the Adriatic Sea. With the conquest of Croatia and Dalmatia, they put themselves in direct conflict with the interests of Venice and Byzantium. For much of the 12th century, the Hungarians were at war, and these wars were coming ever closer to Transylvania.
Beyond the borders of Transylvania, the Pechenegs, and then the Uz nomadic tribes had followed in the tracks the Hungarians. These nomadic and warlike peoples repeatedly raided neighbouring countries, and even Hungary, notably during Stephen's reign. In 1068, they launched a powerful attack that took them over the Meszes Pass into Hungary, where they devastated the Nyírség as far as Bihar castle. As they withdrew through the Lapos and Szamos valleys, they were outflanked by the army of King Solomon; thanks in part to the heroism of Ladislas, the latter's nephew and himself later king, the invaders were routed near the village of Kerlés, in Szolnok county. Prolonged conflict with the Kievan Rus and with related nomadic tribes wore down the Pechenegs, and, in the 11th century, the remnants of this people settled in the Balkans as well as in Hungary.
{1-421.} By then, Transylvania's borders were threatened by another eastern nomadic people, the Cumanians. The latter, known to the Russians as polovets, were called by the Hungarians 'white Cumanians' to distinguish them from the 'black Cumanians', i.e. the Uz people. At the end of the 11th century, the Cumanians' advance guard reached the Lower Danube, and even made a foray into Hungary. However, the Russian princes soon drove them back to their home base on the Don. The small groups of Cumanians that stayed behind in the Lower Danube region presented little threat to Transylvania until, in the 12th century, a more determined enemy appeared on the southern border — the Byzantines, whose intent was not to plunder but to conquer.
The first attack came in 1166, when three columns of Byzantine troops moved up the Danube and penetrated Transylvania. Although they did not stay long, the Byzantines' heavy cavalry and armoured infantry made short shrift of the Székely and Pecheneg light cavalry. King Géza II (1141–1162) did not live to see this attack, but he had been aware of the Byzantine threat and taken some defensive measures. Hungary's kings always welcomed, and indeed invited 'guests' with military expertise; not even those immigrants who acquired private estates were exempt from military service. However, Géza II realized that the occasional immigrant settlers — whose traces are found in many toponyms, including, in Transylvania, four Németis ('Germans'), two Oroszis (Russians), two Nándors (Bulgars), and one Cseh (Czech) — would not suffice to reinforce Hungary's defences; he wanted to strengthen the most vulnerable points along Transylvania's border with large settlements of well-armed warriors. He may have been inspired by the crusaders who were crossing Hungary, and who probably saw that country as an outlet for the surplus population in their homelands. In the event, Géza invited a group of impoverished knights and land-hungry peasants from the Rhine-Moselle region to settle in Transylvania along the Olt River, on land which, according to a 1224 charter, had been 'deserted' (deserta).
{1-422.} In fact, this land was 'deserted' only because the king had resettled its Székely inhabitants to make way for the German (as well as some Walloon) settlers. The German knights, who called themselves gref (in Hungarian: geréb) could serve the king as armoured soldiers. The German peasants, for their part, applied advanced agricultural techniques, and enjoyed greater freedom than in their homeland, for they were allowed to choose their geréb and priests and benefited from tax and duty concessions; as a result, they became so productive that they were able not only to provide for their gerébs, but also to pay some taxes to the king. The earliest known reference to these privileges is found in a charter, dating from 1224, that concerns Flandrenses and Theutonici (the people who came to be known as the Transylvanian Saxons); by then, their settlements had spread well beyond the original district. It is likely that the original German settlers had been granted similar privileges; otherwise, they would not have changed countries, and the king could not have counted on the settlers financing the military service of several hundred knights.



Saxon Settlement and the Reorganization of the Southern Border Defences
https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/72.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:29:14]
The Germans invited by Géza II settled in the vicinity of today's Nagyszeben and, farther east, in the Olt valley, where their districts would later become the 'Saxon seats' of Szeben, Újegyháza, and Nagysink. Some of the earlier inhabitants were resettled by the king to make room for the new arrivals, who proceeded to give German names to the new settlements, but others remained in neighbouring villages. Szakadát, a Székely border village still inhabited by Hungarians, has always been called Zektat by the Saxons, who thus adapted the Hungarian name; similarly, they converted the Slavic names of two brooks, the Cibin and the Cód, into Zibin and Zodt. The Székelymanned castles at Salgó, in the southwest, and Halmágy, in the southeast, were already standing when the Germans arrived; despite the interposition of Saxon settlements, both castles retained their administrative links — in the case of Halmágy, until the end of the Middle Ages — with Fehér county.
{1-423.} The boundaries of desertum that became the original Szászföld ('Saxon land') are not difficult to trace. The administrative map of medieval Transylvania shows that the three Saxon seats were surrounded by districts belonging to Fehér county, and which therefore had not been emptied to receive settlers. To the west, north, and east of the Saxon districts, German place names give way to Hungarian and Slavic toponyms; thus when new German immigrants arrived and spread out beyond the original area, they settled amidst the Hungarians and Slavs. When a provostship (prépostság) was established in 1192 at Nagyszeben, its terms of reference explicitly excluded 'Germans, other than those living on the deserted lands granted by King Géza to his Germans'; even later, its responsibilities remained confined to the three Saxon districts, or more precisely to the larger part thereof. To distinguish their first Transylvanian settlement area from later ones, the Saxons would always refer to it as 'Altland'. This was the only solid block of Saxon settlement in 12th-century Transylvania; subsequent German immigrants settled mainly in Székely, and sometimes Slav-inhabited districts.
The people who are referred to in documents as 'the first German guests of Andrew II' also founded their settlements amidst Hungarian villages, at Romosz in Hunyad county, and at Magyarigen and Boroskrakkó in AlsóFehér county. When news filtered back of the warm welcome that had met them, more and more groups of German settlers headed off to Transylvania. They settled to the east and west of the 'Altland', amidst a sparse population of Székelys and Slavs; these areas later came to form the northern half of Nagysink seat, and the seats of Szerdahely, Kőhalom, and Szászváros. In the western, Szerdahely seat, the Saxons found a local population of unassimilated Slavs; their place names were therefore adapted from Slavic toponyms — Kelling, Troschen, Dobring, and (in explicit reference to the Slavic inhabitants) Reussmarkt, Reussdörfchen, and Reussen. In what were later {1-424.} called the seats of Nagysink, Kőhalom, and Szászváros, the Saxons settled amidst a Székely population and adapted the latter's Hungarian place-names to produce, for instance, Tekes, Hamruden, Halmagen, Scharosch, Bekokten, Wassied, Broos, and Wurmloch. Some time before 1241, another wave of German settlers headed for the northeastern corner of Transylvania, near present-day Beszterce, to develop the local silver mines; their still current place-names — Ronda, Bistritz, Lechnitz — are of Slavic derivation and indicate that they settled among Slavs.
The settlement of Germans was given new impetus by King Andrew II. In 1211, he invited the Teutonic Knights, who had been driven out of the Holy Land, to settle in the Barcaság, a region that was under threat from Cumanian attacks. To make room, the king resettled some Pechenegs further west. Within a short time, the knights populated the region with German settlers and extended their scope of activity beyond the mountains and towards the Danube delta, into the territories inhabited by Cumanians. In terms of the royal charter, the knights came under the king's direct authority, but otherwise enjoyed broad autonomy and privileges: the voivode had no power over them, they were free to trade, organize markets, and build towns and castles, and they were exempted from taxes. However, the knights were not content; they aspired to a statehood modelled on the principalities in the Holy Land. This Western, feudal notion of sovereignty was unknown in Hungary, and the king took umbrage. Even before 1222, he was seeking ways to rid himself of these demanding and difficult 'guests'. A compromise was reached, but the knights pursued their objective by other routes, asking the Pope to establish their own bishopric. Instead, they were given an autonomous deanery. In 1224, the knights offered the Pope feudal tenure over the entire Barcaság, committing themselves to pay an annual tax, and continued their conquest of Cumanian lands. It is obvious, in light of their subsequent role in Prussia, that the knights intended to establish an eastern German {1-425.} state centred in the Barcaság, a natural redoubt, and extending to the Danube delta. King Andrew perceived the looming threat to Hungary's political interests; in 1225, overriding the Pope's strong protest, he resorted to military force and expelled the knights. The latter thereupon pursued their state-building ambitions in Prussia. Although the Pope

made several attempts to have his favoured knights resettled in Transylvania, Andrew II and his successors stood firm.
Even before he resorted to expulsion, King Andrew II was moved by this confrontation to effect a sweeping reorganization of frontier defences. After transferring the Székelys from the district of present-day Szászsebes to the Háromszék Basin, he turned all the land between Szászváros and Barót over to the Saxons. He abolished the previous, multiple jurisdictions and united the Saxons into 'one people' under the authority of the royal count of Nagyszeben, who was also responsible for the Székely, Pecheneg, and Romanian border guards. The Andreanum, a royal charter regulating the status of the Saxons, turned into law the practice of delineating the Székely, Romanian, and Pecheneg 'lands', and thus enshrined the principle of ethnically-defined territories. The charter provided that henceforth, people of different ethnic affiliation or legal status could not live in the same administrative district. Thus the king considered the Szászföld to be the exclusive preserve of the Saxons, and would not permit other ethnic groups to settle there. Similarly, in the case of the reconfigured Székelyföld, the king renounced his reversionary right, i.e. to dispose freely of properties that had no heirs or whose owners had given proof of disloyalty. At the same time, he appointed a Székely count (first mentioned in a charter dating from 1235), who was to be independent of the count at Szeben. The territorial rights granted to the Székelys and Saxons allowed them to form homogeneous societies. Thus began a process of social differentiation that culminated in the recognition of three distinct and distinctive feudal 'nations': the Hungarians, the Székelys, and the Saxons.
{1-426.} The Medieval notion of nationality (natio) differs, of course, from the modern notion of a nation defined by language, for it was based on a wide range of distinctive customs, of which language was but one element, of varying weight. A charter, issued in 1206 by King Andrew II to three Transylvanian villages inhabited by Germans, put it this way: 'It is essential that freedom, a gift from bountiful nature to all guests of His Majesty's lands, be protected fully and without exceptions.'[9]
As it is clearly illustrated by their dialects, the Transylvanian Saxons came in small groups from many different parts of Germany, and at different points in time. Only in their new home did they merge into a single 'people', and that largely thanks to the measures taken by King Andrew II. There were a few French-speakers among them, such as János Latin (Johannes Latinus); he was ennobled and brought into the king's personal military service, and his Transylvanian properties were withdrawn from Saxon jurisdiction. The man's Walloon origin is evoked by the name of his village, Voldorf. But the vast majority of the 'Saxons' were indeed Germans, linked by their common language and a few common-law customs — and that was all, for they had not brought any community structures, let alone urban culture, from the old country. There is no doubt that King Géza's German 'guests' were ordinary peasants, much like the settlers in the Szepesség in northern Hungary, whom a contemporary source describes as 'simple agricultural workers' (homines sunt simplices, agriculturis at laboribus intenti). From the 14th century onwards, the Saxons came to be identified with the artisans and merchants who had emerged to form a distinctive social stratum in their towns. This must not be misconstrued. Apart from Beszterce, which will be discussed later, the Saxons' towns — Nagyszeben, Szászsebes, Szászváros, Brassó, Segesvár, and Medgyes — were not born as full-fledged urban settlements of craftsmen and merchants; they simply grew out of villages populated by ordinary farmers. The growth of these towns {1-427.} cannot be attributed to the original settlers' commercial and craft skills or urban experience, for, as noted, they did not have such a background; urbanization was a consequence of Transylvania's distinctive social and economic development. Even when these settlements had grown into towns, their administrators included both the typically urban magistrate (Richter, iudex) and a leading official (Hann, villicus) whose post was carried over from the earlier village community. It can be inferred from the survival of village institutions in the Saxon towns that there were few, if any, town-dwellers among the original immigrants.
The Saxons' traditional leaders, called geréb (Gräve, comes), were essentially professional soldiers. As late as the 14th century, they were clearly distinguished from authentic nobles (nobiles et alii comites).[10] At the same time, their high post earned them a lifestyle and privileges similar to those enjoyed by the nobility (Saxones Transilvani predia tenentes et more nobilium se gerentes).[11] A geréb was not the landlord of the peasants under his authority, and thus he was not entitled to feudal services; he was merely a member of the community that had received a grant of land from the king, and owed the king taxes as well as military service. On the other hand, he derived some material benefit from his modest functions as administrator and magistrate (a lifelong post that he owed to the king and the support of his constituents, and in which he was supervised by royal officials): he held a larger than average share of the common land, was entitled to establish a mill, and kept a share of the fines that he

https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/72.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:29:14]
imposed. The gerébs thus acquired considerable economic power, and most of them managed to pass on the title — not to speak of growing assets — to their heirs. In principle, all members of the Saxon community enjoyed equal rights, but the gerébs came to constitute a separate social stratum that had the means to finance military service and thus acquired a lifestyle similar to that of the Hungarian nobility.
{1-428.} The king did not impose military service on individual Saxons; in the Andreanum, he simply required that the Saxon community be ready to provide 500 soldiers, naturally drawn from among the gerébs. In addition, the Saxon community had to pay a land tax (terragium) that, during the reign of Béla III, amounted to 15.000 silver marks per year. The other, lesser, imposts included what was known as the 'Chamber's profit' (kamara haszna), payable when old coins were exchanged for new; from 1224 onwards, the community was allowed to pay this tax in an annual lump sum of 500 marks (one mark contained 206.7 grams of silver). The prevailing tendency in royal tax policy was to specify a lump sum payable by the Saxon collectivity, and to leave the task of collection to the latter's local officials. The system was mutually advantageous. It spared Saxons the added expense of paying for the royal tax-collectors' tours and the frictions that were bound to arise with these 'foreign' functionaries; on the other side, it provided the king with guaranteed revenues. Together with the territorial rights, also granted in 1224, this global tax system fostered development of the Saxons' autonomous local government.
There is no doubt that the Teutonic Knights' brief but assertive presence in Transylvania contributed to growing ethnic consciousness among the Saxons. Although the knights initially focused on military activity and on reviving cultivation in the devastated Barcaság, they also planned to establish towns and to foster crafts and commerce; from the start, they insisted on having the right to hold markets and to trade freely throughout the country. This was probably what inspired the neighbouring Saxons to insist that the 1224 charter include the same rights. The knights' departure did not abort the modest initiatives at urbanization, although in the Saxon district, as in the rest of Hungary, full-fledged towns emerged only in the second half of the 13th century.

{1-429.} The 'Land of the Romanians'
It will be remembered that Anonymus had linked the 'Blak', i.e. Romanian people of the Bulgar-Romanian empire with the 'Blaks' who, according to him, lived in Northern Transylvania. The earliest relevant documents date from the first third of the 13th century, and originate in the Hungarian and papal chancelleries: they make reference to terra Blacorum, a land, or rather forest (silva), in the southern Carpathians inhabited by Romanians. However, there are no written sources to indicate when the Romanians first appeared in Transylvania.
The broader debate over the theory of 'Daco-Roman continuity' — which affirms the uninterrupted presence, dating back to Antiquity, of a Romanized ethnic group in Transylvania — is beyond the scope of this work. As noted earlier, there is no historical, archaeological, or toponymic evidence to indicate that Romanians lived in Transylvania before the early 13th century. On the other hand, various written sources from 976 onwards mention Romanians, either as migratory shepherds or as soldiers recruited into units of the Byzantine army in Thessaly and the Balkan mountains; in 1094, Romanians (Vlachs) guided Pecheneg raiders through those mountains' passes into Byzantine territory. Numerous Serbian documents, dating from the end of the 12th century, mention Romanian shepherds in the mountainous region between the Drina and Morava rivers. Although, in modern times, Romanians no longer lived there, nor in the mountains of western Bulgaria, both regions have numerous toponyms attesting to their presence in the Middle Ages. Without proving that Romanians migrated northward into the Carpathians, these traces indicate that they were mainly seasonal shepherds, spending summers on mountain pastures and winters in the river valleys or on the coast. Transhumance did not exclude ancillary farming activity, and there are in fact traces of terraced cultivation on the higher slopes of {1-430.} Transylvanian mountains. The Romanian and Albanian languages, which are probably of common origin, preserve words that evoke this way of life.
However, seasonal shepherding would have been practised only on the mountains' eastern and southern slopes, which benefit from sunshine, and it is therefore not plausible that the Romanians, ancestral pastures lay farther north, in Transylvania. As a Romanian historian observed, 'the transhumance of sheep from the south bank of the Danube or from the Carpathians to Transylvania was never mentioned; this would have been unnatural, for there are no suitable pastures on the northern and western, Transylvanian slopes of the mountains. A southern shepherd would not dream of driving his flock into Transylvania, a land poorly-endowed with pastures.'[12] On the other hand, Romanian shepherds who migrated seasonally to the Danube may well have lived on the southern slopes of the South Carpathian range after the emergence of the Romanian people; this is particularly likely after 800, when the Bulgars conquered southern Transylvania, for their supervision of the area between the southern Carpathians and the Danube (today's Wallachia) made transhumance from mountain to river more secure. After Bulgaria came under Byzantine rule (ca. 1000), Wallachia would serve as a peripheral pastureland for the Pechenegs, and later for the Cumanians. The Byzantine outposts around the Danube Delta and the Danube Bend could not provide security for the Romanian shepherds or for the Slavs' forested region of the plains; these people had to accommodate themselves to the nomadic newcomers. For the sake of mutual security, the Pechenegs and Cumanians worked out a modus vivendi (sources give no details) with the Romanian shepherds. After 1185, when the Cumanians helped to form a Bulgar-Romanian czardom, this relationship was formalized in an alliance. The leaders (cnezes) of the Romanians in Wallachia — drawing in part on their experience in the Byzantine army — proceeded to organize their people over a {1-431.} growing area. Shepherds' settlements, known as katuns, were grouped into broader administrative units (kenézség) led by the kenéz. At first, the latter combined soldiering and shepherding, but over time they turned into a closed caste of professional soldiers, a pre-feudal elite similar to that of barbarian tribes. In all likelihood, the Romanian border guard units that were settled in Transylvania's frontier zone along with the Székelys and Pechenegs came from this élite.
The first authentic document concerning this region reveals that the Romanians enjoyed a certain degree of autonomy: according to a property register dating from Benedek's voivodeship (1202–1209), a piece of land situated between the Olt River, the Eger and Árpás streams, and the mountains — was transferred by King Andrew II from the ownership of Romanians (exempta de Blaccis) to that of the Cistercian monastery at Kerc. That

Romanians had property rights, subject to alteration by the king, is also indicated in the Andreanum, which granted Saxons free use of a forest belonging to the Romanians and Pechenegs (silvam Blacorum et Bissenorum). A royal charter, long believed to originate from King Andrew II in 1222, granted the Teutonic Knights in the Barcaság exemption from duty when they travelled through the lands of the Székelys and Romanians (per terram Siculorum aut per terram Blacorum). Although it turns out that the document was forged in 1231, in Rome, by Hermann von Salza, the head of the Teutonic Knights (who by then had been expelled from the Barcaság), there is no reason to question this particular information: the Romanians, like the Székelys, had their own 'land' as well as the right to impose customs duty.
Since 'Barca's land' (Barca földje), the territory granted to the Teutonic Knights in 1211, encompassed the laternamed districts of Sárkány and Törcs, it is likely that eastern boundary of the 'land of Blaks' ran from the Királykő to a point on the Olt between Fogaras and Sárkány. The line of the western boundary is more difficult to {1-432.} establish. The 'forest of the Romanians and Pechenegs' mentioned in the Andreanum must have been located somewhere southeast of Nagyszeben, in the vicinity of Beşineu Mountain and Talmács castle, for those toponyms commemorate the Pechenegs mentioned in a document dating from 1250: in 1211, the count of Szeben had led a force of Saxons, Romanians, Székelys, and Pechenegs (associatis sibi Saxonibus, Olacis, Siculis et Bissenis) to do battle in Bulgaria. There are also later references to the coexistence of the Pechenegs, Romanians, and Székelys. When, in 1260, the Bohemian king Ottokar II recorded his victory over the Hungarian king, he noted that latter's 'inhuman men' included not only Cumanians, Hungarians, and sundry Slavs, but also Székelys, Romanians, and Pechenegs (innumeram multitudinem ... Siculorum quoque et Valachorum, Bezzenninorum). If, as it appears, the toponyms Beschenbach — Besimbák — Beşinbav are derived from Pecheneg, then these people could also be found on the 'Blak land' of the Fogaras region. It is likely that an early and cohesive community of Pechenegs had lived near the Olt bend, around southern tributaries whose names — Barca, Brassó, Tömös, Tatrang, and Zajzon — betray a Turkic origin; these streams had their source in the passes through which the Cumanians would invade from Wallachia. On the other hand, the occurrence of the toponym Besenyő in the Székelyföld and farther north probably owes to scattered Pecheneg settlements.
It will be remembered that the king had moved Pecheneg guards out of the Barcaság — perhaps to the Szeben district — in order to make room in 1211 for the Teutonic Knights, who were expected to strengthen the defence of the border. Thus when, in 1231, the leader of the Teutonic Knights requested duty-free transit through the land of the Romanians and Székelys, he must have had in mind, in the east, the Székelys of Sepsi, who had been moved there in 1224 from Szászsebes, and, in the west, the Romanians who shared with Pechenegs a forest near Fogaras and Szeben. By {1-433.} that time, it is likely that most of the Pechenegs were settled alongside Romanians around Talmács; in the same area where later, in the second half of the 13th century, three castles were raised to protect the Szászföld — Talmács (at the Vöröstorony pass), Salgó (near present-day Orlát < Váralatt), and Pétervár (near Szászcsór).
The Fogaras Alps were impassable between the Vöröstorony and Törcsvár passes, and thus sheltered the region known as the 'Oláhföld' ('Vlach land'; it must have been named after a monastery, for a document from 1252 refers to terra Olacorum de Kyrch); the first castle in this region, at Fogaras, was raised in the 15th century. However, west of the Olt River, the Szászföld was vulnerable to attackers moving north along the Lator and Zsil valleys, hence the building of the above-noted castles. The earliest documents that mention Romanian villages near these castles date from the 14th century; they are initially referred to simply as 'Vlach villages' (oláh falvak), and then by triple — German, Hungarian, and Romanian — names. However, there is every reason to believe that Romanians (as well as Pechenegs) lived there as early as the beginning of the 13th century, and with the same purpose as in 1383: to guard the mountain frontier from Talmács to Oláhnagyfalu (today's Szelistye), near Orlát (assumserunt ipsi Walachi custodiam alpibus ab Tolmacz usque ad magnam villam Walachicalem).
Contemporary sources, and inferences from later ones, point to the existence around 1200 of a 'Blak land' in the mountains near Fogaras and Szászváros, i.e. of an administrative district of Romanian border guards. It is more difficult to ascertain the defensive structure of the Maros valley and the Sztrigy Basin, which were the most vulnerable parts of Transylvania's southern border region, for they could be attacked both from the south, through the Vulkán Pass, and, in the west, from the Temes valley and through the Vaskapu (Iron Gates). It is not known when Hunyad county was established; sources dating from 1276 indicate the existence of two administrative districts, the comitatus of Hunyad and that of {1-434.} Hátszeg, and as late as 1399, a separate castellan (várnagy)

https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/73.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:29:24]
ruled over each part of the territory. When, in 1409, the castle at Hunyad became, along with its dependencies, the property of the Hunyadi family, Hátszeg remained a separate district, though one that came under the jurisdiction of the same nobiliary court as Hunyad county (1480: sedes iudiciaria universorum nobilium comitatus de Hunyad et de Haczak).[13]
The defence of the southern border was assured principally by the castle of Hátszeg and its district, which was inhabited in the era of the royal castle system — perhaps as early as the 11th century — by royal hunters known as daróc. The first mention of Romanians dates from 1263, when King Stephen the Younger bestowed upon one of his loyal nobles a piece of daróc land that encompassed three villages (later to form part of the Magyarbrettye estate); by excluding from this grant the lands belonging to the cnez Dragun and cnez Kodoch (exceptis terris ... kenasiis), the king acknowledged the property rights of these two, presumably Romanian, officials.[14] The latter's property, together with the rest of the Oláhbrettye estate, both in the immediate vicinity of Hátszeg castle, are mentioned in the 15th century as belonging to the Pogány family, who were descendants of a Romanian cnez. In the 14th century, judicial affairs in the Hátszeg district were dealt by the cnez assizes (kenézi szék), chaired by the Hátszeg castellan; after the cnezes were ennobled, their court merged with the nobiliary court of Hunyad county.

3. FROM THE MONGOL INVASION TO THE BATTLE OF MOHÁCS
The Cumanian Country and the Province of Severin
Until 1263, the history of the Hátszeg region was interwoven with that of the Cumanian Country (Kunország, Cumania) and Severin Province (Szörényi bánság). Hungarians and Bulgars had been vying for possession of Nándorfehérvár and Barancs since the beginning of the century. This conflict intensified when, following {1-435.} the expulsion of the Teutonic Knights, King Andrew II put his son Béla in charge of Transylvania, with the title of 'junior king'. Prince Béla's first priority was to sever the alliance between the Cumanians and the BulgaroRomanian, Asenid dynasty. The opportunity came with a sudden turn in the Cumanians' political fortunes. After uniting the Mongol tribes, Genghis Khan had launched a series of military campaigns comparable only to those of the Huns; within twenty years, he acquired an immense empire stretching from the Yellow Sea to the Volga River. In 1223, Genghis threw his main army against the Cumanians and their Russian allies. After defeating them in a great battle at the Kalka River, he extended his rule to the Dnieper. When the Mongols withdrew their army to deal with a crisis on the China front, their forward positions were relocated on the Volga. The Cumanians, however, anticipated that their fearful enemy would soon resume its westward advance. Since they could not count on the Russian princes, who were mired in internecine quarrels, the Cumanians turned to Christian Europe and sought the support of Eastern Europe's mightiest ruler, the King of Hungary.
For years, Dominican monks from Hungary had been trying to convert the Cumanians, who were encamped on the left bank of the Danube, west of the Szeret River. The Cumanian tribes' ruling prince, Bars (Barsz), used the monks as intermediaries to offer his conversion to Róbert, the archbishop of Esztergom and head of the Hungarian Roman Catholic Church, as well as his submission to Prince Béla. Both the French-born archbishop and his close friend, Prince Béla, were tireless champions of a Church that was reaching the apogee of its power. In 1227, having obtained the Pope's permission to organize a Cumanian Catholic Church, Róbert joined Béla and two other French-born prelates, Bertalan, the bishop of Pécs, and Rajnald, the bishop of Transylvania, for a ceremonial meeting in Transylvania with Prince Bars. The latter, together with his family and retinue, formally espoused the Christian faith, and {1-436.} placed his country and people under the suzerainty of the King of Hungary.
The superior of the Dominicans in Hungary, Teodorik, was named bishop of the new Cumanian diocese; his episcopal seat was located at Milko, a small town beyond the Carpathians, across from Háromszék county. Prince Béla visited Cumania, which was already annexed to Hungary (and referred to as terra sua in the Papal charter), to supervise its reorganization. Hungarians, Székelys, and Saxons in quest of land began to migrate eastward over the Carpathians and settle among Cumania's Slav farmers and Cumanian as well as Romanian shepherds. Contemporary documents and surviving toponyms attest to the establishment of numerous Hungarian villages and Saxon-Hungarian market towns in the region's river valleys. Moldavia's 'Csángó' people, who were said not long ago to number close to 100,000, are the descendants of these and later Hungarian settlers.
The Asenid ruler of Bulgaria construed the Cumanians' abrogation of alliance and submission to Hungary as a declaration of war. Indeed, Prince Béla intended to attack the Bulgars. In 1230, the Hungarians laid siege to Vidin, but they were beaten back, and the Székely count was captured by the enemy. It is probably after this event that Béla, seeing the need for a bridgehead, converted a part of Cumania lying west of the Olt (today's Oltenia) into the Province of Severin (Szörényi bánság). The bán — the title of governors appointed by the king in Croatia and other southern provinces of Hungary — had his castle seat at Szörényvár (today's Turnu Severin); the first documented reference to this official dates from 1233. According to a Papal document from 1234, the population of Cumania included Romanians, who were ministered by Greek Orthodox bishops, as well as the later Hungarian and Saxon settlers. The ethnic mix in Severin was probably similar; in any case, its population must have grown rapidly, for in 1238 King Béla asked the Pope to appoint a bishop to the province.
{1-437.} Although the Mongol invasion of 1241 dealt a severe blow to Severin's development, it is likely that conditions prior to that date were similar to those outlined in a charter from 1247, granting the province to the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem. With regard to Severin, the grant included the districts (kenézség) of cnez János

and cnez Farkas, but not that of the voivode Litvoj, which the king left in Romanian hands (quam Olacis relinquimus prout iidem hactenus tenuerant). The knights were also granted the rest of the earlier Kun Country, the part lying beyond the Olt and the Transylvanian mountains, again with the exception of a Romanian district, governed by the voivode Seneslaus (excepta terra Szeneslai woiavode Olacorum). Half of the royal taxes generated by voivode Litvoj's land (terra Lytua) was assigned to the knights — except for the income from the Hátszeg district (misspelt as terra Harszoc in the charter's only surviving, papal copy), which the king kept all for himself. In this way, the Romanian border-guard district of Hátszeg was taken away from voivode Litvoj, and its cnezes were subordinated to the Hátszeg castellan. On the other hand, Litvoj won a greater degree of autonomy in his remaining domain, which in the second half of the 13th century came to be known as 'Litva's Land' (terra Lytua). (Similary, Dobrudja was named after its Bulgar governor, Dobrotich, and Bessarabia after its conqueror, Basarab, the voivode of Wallachia.) Some time around 1272, Litvoj renounced fealty to King Ladislas IV the Cumanian ('Kun László'), who dispatched a punitive force led by György Sóvári. Litvoj was killed, and his brother Bărbat had to pay a heavy ransom to be released from captivity. There is no trace after this date of Romanian voivodes in the province of Severin. The onetime 'Litva's Land' may have lain somewhere along the upper reaches of the Zsil River. The name of Vîlcea county, in the Zsil valley, could indicate the land of the cnez Farkas (farkas, Hungarian for wolf > the Slavic vlk > Vîlcea). The land of cnez János may have lain farther south along the Zsil, around present-day Craiova, for {1-438.} that toponym evokes a (Hungarian) royal possession. It is unclear whether the domain of voivode Seneslaus, like that of Litvoj, had extended into Transylvania, potentially in the Fogaras area. If so, then Seneslaus would have suffered the same fate as Litvoj: in 1247, he would have lost his foothold in Transylvania and received a voivodeship south of the Carpathians, perhaps the same one mentioned in connection with a campaign led by György Sóvári in 1272 against a certain Dorman and his Bulgar allies. Dorman was presumably a precursor of Basarab, who, at the beginning of the 14th century, took Wallachia out of the Hungarian Kingdom.
The charter of 1247 refers to military service by the Romanians of Severin Province and the Cumanian Country (cum apparatu suo bellico). Their contribution to the royal treasury must have been an animal tax, which is mentioned in sources from 1256, 1262, and 1293; the latter specifies that the rate was one-fiftieth of their sheep (quinquagesima ovium).
The route, immediately to the west of Severin Province, that led from the Temes River region to the Danube's Iron Gates, was probably also part of the second line of defence on the Southern Carpathian border; and this line would have consisted of castle districts and Romanian cnezes, as in the case of Hátszeg. Until recently, only one of these defensive installations was known, that at Sebes (today's Karánsebes), whose castle and count are mentioned in early 14th-century records. The first reference to a Romanian cnez in the district dates from 1319 (Bach kenezius), and to a Romanian place-name, from 1337; the latter, Căprior — Kaprevár, is the very first recorded Romanian toponym in Hungary, including Transylvania.
In a recently-found document, dating from 1350, Pósa Szeri, the count of Krassó and Sebes, certifies that Juga's son Lupcsin (Lupchyn), otherwise known as the voivode János, had laid claim on the basis of inheritance (predecessorum suorum ... possessiones hereditarie) to certain properties being held by others in the Sebes {1-439.} district, notably at Tövis and Gyepű, and had presented a charter from King Béla to back up his claim; the count complied with the request.[15] The location of Gyepű (today's Gyepesfalu), near Karánsebes, coincides with a site referred to in another source as Mutnokpataka — unoccupied land that was granted in 1352 to Juga and Bogdán, sons of István Mutnoki, 'with all the rights enjoyed by cnezes who own free villages in the Sebes district'. There is no doubt that the two sources refer to the same family. Since the Mutnokis are subsequently mentioned as belonging to the nobility, their career must have followed a pattern similar to those of noble cnezes in the Hátszeg district. Sebes and seven other castles in Krassó county enjoyed the same degree of autonomy as the cnez's seat near Hátszeg. Although the first source to offer details of the king's terms for this autonomy dates from 1457, references are found as early as 1376 to 'the old and approved (antiqua et approbata) law pertaining to the Vlach districts'. The charter from King Béla IV referred to in the document above (the original is lost) gives an indication of the scope of this 'old law'; it suggests both that the voivode Lupcsin had a status similar to that of the Hátszeg district's voivode Litvoj, and that, like in Hátszeg, the office of voivode in Sebes had disappeared by the 14th century. The example of Hátszeg makes it likely that Sebes castle and its Romanian voivode district date back to the time of Béla IV, but confirmation depends on the discovery of additional documentary evidence.

The foregoing description of conditions in Transylvania's southern border regions is based largely on documents relating to the settlement of Saxons in the mid-1100s and to that of the Teutonic Knights in 1211, and on inferences, drawn from these documents, regarding earlier times. Although the Vlach-Romanian ethnic group appears in these documents no earlier than 1210, there is a strong likelihood that it had been present for some time. After all, the first documented references to Saxons, Székelys, and Pechenegs are found in the very same sources (dating from 1190 in {1-440.} the case of the Saxons), yet it is known that these groups were already present in Transylvania at least as early as the middle of the 12th century. Thus it is entirely possible that there were VlachRomanians in the region at the same time as these groups, and perhaps even earlier; and the reorganization of the border zone may well have imposed changes in their own organization and area of settlement, just as happened to the other groups.
In sum, it appears more than likely that around 1200, there lived along both sides of the Southern Carpathians Romanian border guards, who were administered by ethnic Romanian voivodes and cnezes. They lived alongside Székelys, Pechenegs, and Saxons, sometimes sharing land with the latter, but organized independently under the supervision of counts appointed by the king of Hungary. There are no documentary sources to indicate the exact date when the Romanian border guard districts were established, and when Romanians began to settle on the Transylvanian side of the Southern Carpathians. The answer to these questions can only be inferred from the Romanians' interaction with the other ethnic groups.
Their association with the Pechenegs in Transylvania probably came about through Hungarian mediation, for Transylvanian Romanians called the Pechenegs 'Beşineu', a term borrowed from Hungarian, whereas the Romanians of Wallachia used a term of Slavic derivation, 'Pečeneg'. A part of the Pecheneg people migrated to Hungary some time after 950; another part moved in the 11th century to the Byzantine empire, which at that time extended to the Danube. South of the Danube, the Pechenegs lived in a Slavic environment; in 1147, they served as mercenaries of Byzantium when the Crusaders fought their way across the Bulgarian plain. The Wallachian Romanians may have learnt the Pechenegs' Slavic name from remnants of this group, or from those who remained north of the Danube. The coexistence of Pechenegs and Romanians in Transylvania probably dates from after 1150. As noted, sources {1-441.} refer to Székelys, Pechenegs, and Romanians fighting side by side in the first half of the 13th century; but of the three, only Pechenegs and Székelys are mentioned in Hungarian as well as Czech accounts of the battles at Olsava (1116) and on the Leitha River (1146). (However, in the latter case, it is possible that the Székelys and Pechenegs in question came not from Transylvania, but from western Hungary.) The Slavic, Hungarian, German, and Turkic toponyms that were adapted by the Romanians (and thus antedate the arrival of the latter in the Southern Carpathian region) also points to the conclusion that the local Vlach-Romanians were organized into border guard villages sometime between 1150 and 1200.

The Three Feudal 'Nations' and the Ottoman Threat
Although the three groups, of Hungarian nobles, Székelys, Saxons were not free of differentiation in rank or of internal discord, each of them constituted an integrated community of interest with respect to the others. Each group jealously guarded the legal codes and customs that symbolized their autonomy and distinctive character. The fact that an individual's rights, obligations, and rank in Hungarian society depended on this membership only reinforced identification with his specific community, or feudal estate. In medieval terminology, these three Transylvanian Estates were each called a 'nation' (natio). This word evoked a community bound by customary laws and possessed of liberty (libertas), and not a nation in the modern sense, defined by common ethnic origin and mother tongue.
{1-497.} Thus Transylvania's feudal nations did not necessarily coincide with the ethnic groups. For one thing, only freemen could be full-fledged members. Villeins, whether Hungarian, Saxon, or Romanian, were under the authority of their lords and thus could not enjoy the freedom that was inseparable from membership in a nation. All freemen who performed military service and held personal title to property (i.e. whose land was not simply a share of commonly-held property, as in the case of Székelys and Saxons) counted as members of the 'nation' of nobles, irrespective of their ethnic background. Székelys and Saxons had an equal chance of becoming noblemen, and, as noted, many Romanians were ennobled as well. If Saxon and Romanian noblemen became assimilated to the Hungarians, this was not as a consequence of official policy or compulsion. The Hungarian nobility always included people of other mother tongues, and it possessed a distinctive lifestyle that held a powerful attraction for new recruits. If the latter assimilated the Hungarian majority's language and national consciousness, they did so voluntarily. In so far as the Hungarian nobility of the Middle Ages displayed a bias in the matter, it aimed more to exclude foreign elements — for reasons of foreign policy — than to assimilate them. To the Hungarian nobles, 'foreign' signified 'extraneous to Hungary'. When the lesser nobility pressed the national assembly to decree that foreigners could not hold public office, the target was always first-generation immigrants. The same noble 'nation' that agitated against domination by foreigners backed candidates for the throne, Matthias Hunyadi and John Szapolyai, who were not of wholly Hungarian ethnic origin. To be sure, the Hungarian nobles of Transylvania developed, in the late Middle Ages, an aversion to Saxons; the hostility, which was mutual, owed to the chronic friction between the nobility and the middle class as well as to the anti-German slant of contemporary foreign policy. The Székelys' 'nation' had long ago ceased to be a distinct nationality; indeed, they were generally regarded as the most {1-498.} Hungarian of Hungarians. Thus in 1558, Mihály Vilmányi Libécz, a poet from Upper Hungary, would advise Hungarians who were perplexed by some question of grammar or usage to
Consult without fail the language of the ancient Székelys, For they are the guardians of the purest Hungarian tongue.[22]
Only the Saxon 'nation' coincided with a distinct nationality, and even so, it did not include all the Germans of Transylvania, for neither German burghers in county towns nor Saxon villeins counted as members of the natio Saxonica. And if the Romanians did not come to constitute a 'nation', it is because when the voivodes and cnezes gained ascendancy over commoners, they effectively abrogated that ethnic community's 'liberty'.
At first, each of the three feudal nations concentrated on safeguarding and expanding its privileges and local autonomy. In the 14th century, the nobility, Székelys, and Saxons displayed no community of interest with regard to Transylvania, nor any disposition to take concerted action. At the time, Transylvania was an essentially geographical concept. The perception, that it was a somewhat autonomous region within the Hungarian realm, owed not to local patriotism but to exceptional powers held by the voivode. The latter was the chief magistrate, governor, and military commander of Transylvania's counties, and this power inevitably drew the Székely and Saxon territories into his sphere of influence. To be sure, these territories were governed by counts who were nominally independent of the voivode. Székelys and Saxons clung jealously to this status, fearing that if they were put under the same judicial and administrative authority as the noble 'nation', the nobiliary law would prevail at the

expense of their own legal codes. The kings, on the other hand, tried to harmonize the administration of this remote province by appointing close relatives of the voivode to the post of Székely count (who was, at the same time, count of three {1-499.} of the four Saxon districts, Beszterce, Brassó, and Medgyes-Selyk. When Tamás Szécsényi occupied the post of voivode, the Székely count was his nephew, Simon. For most of the period between 1344 and 1376, King Louis entrusted Transylvania to his favourites, the Lackfi family: the posts of voivode and Székely count were held variously by István, András, Dénes, Miklós, Imre, and the younger István.
In the 14th century, Hungary underwent a process of political and economic consolidation, and Transylvania prospered as never before, or since. The campaign led by András Lackfi had finally expelled the Mongols. The main source of unrest was the relationship between nobles and villains, which remained unsettled and was further complicated by judicial and social aspects of the settlement of Romanians in the counties. King Louis had to pay a visit in 1366 to Transylvania to deal with the disorder. Among Hungary's kings, he was the most frequent visitor to the province, one reason being the problems in the southern borderlands. The frequent rebellions by Wallachian voivodes did not represent a serious threat, but their armies would repeatedly rampage through the mainly Saxon villages in the frontier zone. To secure the mountain passes, the king had the fortresses rebuilt at Talmács and Törcs, a defensive measure fully supported by the Saxons of Szeben and Brassó.
The roster of voivodes offers one indication of the relative tranquillity that prevailed in Transylvania during the 14th century. Individuals and families who enjoyed the king's trust would hold the immensely prestigious post for long periods, thus ensuring political continuity: Tamás Szécsényi for twenty-two years, the Lackfi family for twenty-six, and László Losonci for fifteen years. The voivode represented Transylvania to the outside world; within the province, he was the link between social groups that were separated by law, language, custom, and interests. He mediated the first institutional links between the three feudal nations. When, as often happened, problems of a judicial, administrative, commercial, {1-500.} or military nature involved members of all three nations, the monarch was supposed to summon a general council (congregatio generalis), but he usually left this task to the voivode. These diets, convened at Torda, were a comparatively frequent occurrence in the 14th century, and they helped noble, Székely, and Saxon leaders to emerge from isolation and take note of their common interests. As the Ottoman threat intensified, so did the need for solidarity among Transylvania's 'nations'.
At the beginning of the 15th century, the voivode stopped convening these councils, thus suspending institutional contact between the three feudal nations. King Louis had been the last male descendant of the Anjou family, and his death in 1382 was followed by a fierce struggle for the succession. The aristocracy, which had been kept in check by Charles Robert and Louis, once again engaged in partisan battles, shattering the peace of the realm. The civil war ended with the enthronement of Sigismund of Luxembourg (1387–1437), who had to accommodate himself to a more assertive aristocracy. During the first half of the 15th century, the closely-related families of aristocrats formed themselves into 'leagues' controlling vast regions of the country and competed for political power. Whether by choice or economic and political necessity, the great mass of middle and lesser nobles became the feudal familiars of the aristocracy. The king depended on the barons' support, and would make repeated grants of land to secure it. Accordingly, the crown's holdings were diminished throughout the country — including, with some delay, in Transylvania — and the aristocracy ended up owning more land than the king. The aristocrats devoted their time and energies to partisan struggles, often at the expense of the responsibilities of their public office, which they entrusted to their retainers; the king's remedy, the appointment to important offices of not one, but two incumbents, scarcely alleviated the problem. King Louis's famous Polish general, Stibor Stiborici, served with some effectiveness as Transylvania's voivode {1-501.} in 1395–1401 and 1409–14, but his successors proved to be less conscientious. The voivodes Miklós Csáky (1415–1426) and László Csáky (1427–1437), father and son, never set foot in Transylvania, letting their deputy, Loránd Váraskeszi Lépes, govern in their stead. Lacking the authority of a voivode, the latter failed to provide Transylvania with the necessary leadership, but he and his brother, Bishop György, did promote their own family's interests with some success. Yet Transylvania was greatly in need of judicious and energetic governance, for the province was entering a critical phase in its history.
The threat looming in the south was the most dangerous that Hungary had to face since the Mongol invasion. The Ottoman Turks, having taken less than fifty years to conquer the Balkans, reached Hungary's border at the end of the 14th century. Mircea, Wallachia's voivode, put up a heroic resistance, then sought refuge in Transylvania and appealed to King Sigismund for help. In 1395, he confronted the Ottomans with the aid of a Hungarian army, but once again suffered defeat; one of the Hungarian commanders, István Losonci, fell in battle. Next, King Sigismund



The Three Feudal 'Nations' and the Ottoman Threat

personally led an army into Wallachia to confront the new voivode, who had been installed by the Ottomans; in the event, he failed to dislodge the Ottomans from Kisnikápoly (Turnu), and as he was withdrawing, his forces were savaged by the troops of the new voivode. There followed the first Turkish incursion in Transylvania, into the Barcaság district. The king's crusaders, who included Western knights as well as Balkan freedom-fighters, suffered a disastrous defeat in 1396, at Nikopol. The following year, the Hungarian diet acknowledged the extraordinary nature of the threat by decreeing an unprecedented level of conscription in case of Turkish attack: one soldier for every twenty villeins.
After a short-lived resistance, Wallachia passed into Ottoman hands, and Mircea, who had meanwhile returned, became the Ottomans' vassal. King Sigismund sympathized with his {1-502.} Wallachian vassals, and on more than one occasion his troops helped loyal voivodes to recover their throne, but to no avail. There were plenty of Romanian pretenders ready to side with the Ottomans, and as soon as the Hungarian forces left Wallachia, one of them would lead Turkish troops to drive the king's protégé back to Transylvania. At times, the king's vassal, once he had been restored to power by Hungarian military strength, would try to forestall Turkish reprisal by offering fealty to the Ottomans, only to be driven from office by the next pretender and his Hungarian backers. Wallachia thus became a permanent battle zone, and the Ottomans, usually in concert with a voivode, broke into Transylvania with increasing frequency.
In 1420, it was — exceptionally — Transylvania's voivode, Miklós Csáky, who took charge of organizing resistance to the Ottomans, but he was defeated at Hátszeg. The enemy proceeded to devastate Hunyad county and Szászváros, then withdrew, taking much of the population into slavery. The following year, the Ottomans defeated a force of Saxons and Székelys at Brassó, and only those townspeople who sought refuge in the fortress at Cenk managed to avoid enslavement; on this occasion, the Ottomans also raided the Barcaság and the Fogaras district. In 1427, King Sigismund paid a personal visit to Transylvania's southern border-zone and, following the example set two centuries earlier by Andrew II, proposed to settle Teutonic Knights in Severin Province and Northern Wallachia. This experiment brought no lasting success. In 1432, Turkish and Romanian armies once again penetrated into Hungary; Brassó and Szeben, defended by new fortifications, successfully withstood the onslaught, but the Szászföld and, for the first time, the Székelyföld suffered great material and human losses. In 1434, the Transylvanian authorities had to take stringent measures against Romanians in the Fogaras, for people in Brassó had accused the latter of negotiating with the Ottomans to facilitate an invasion.
{1-503.} In 1435, Sigismund responded to the mounting threat with a series of military measures. He reorganized the militia (telekkatonaság, militia portalis), requiring that one mounted archer be raised for every thirty-three landed villeins, and imposing a new tax to pay for the upkeep. He also set out the requirements for Transylvania's army: 500 soldiers from each of the voivode, the Székely count, and the province's bishop, 40–150 from each ecclesiastical institution and town, 3000 from the counties collectively, and a further 4000 from the Székelys and Saxons. The Diet of the Transylvanian 'nations', convened at Torda in 1420, decided that, in case of Turkish attack, every third nobleman and every tenth villein would have to take up arms to assist the Székelys and Saxons, who were the most directly threatened.

The Mongol Invasion and Its Consequences 3. FROM THE MONGOL INVASION TO THE
BATTLE OF MOHÁCS Barons and Other Nobles
The Emergence of Feudal Estates and Oligarchic Rule
Hungary, including Transylvania, underwent a major transformation in the course of the 13th century. Internal stresses had already weakened the social order of early feudalism; the Mongol invasion administered the final blow, bringing about the collapse of the old and the emergence of a new order. Royal and county estates were bestowed on powerful barons. Among those who had been tied to the royal castle system, the upper strata became the lesser nobility, while the lower strata (along with liberated slaves) became villeins who, though free to migrate, owed service to the landlords. The new social structure included barons, nobles, and villeins, as well as a distinct class of town-dwellers. The feudal upper class {1-452.} consisted of barons and prelates, the lower class of the lesser nobility and urban freemen. These strata benefited from privileges that were denied to the villeins subjected to the landlords. However, a significant number of agricultural workers enjoyed the status of free peasants. This was the case with the Jazygo-Cumanians ('Jászkunok') who lived on the Great Plain, the Saxon peasants in the Szepesség, and, in Transylvania — traditionally the home of free peasants — with the Saxons, Székelys, and, initially, the Romanians as well.
The second half of the 13th century saw rapid growth in the pace and scope of social change. The old county seats (Dés, Doboka, Kolozsvár, Torda, Gyulafehérvár, Küküllővár) had fallen to the Mongols, and although King Béla IV subsequently tried to repopulate his castle strongholds, the latter lost their military significance. As noted, their defensive function was taken over by the king's new network of mountain forts; the latter's castellans took on administrative duties, and one of them was generally designated count. Meanwhile, the former county seats found a new role as economic centres. The king resettled farmers, miners, and merchants (hospites) in Dés, Kolozsvár, Gyulafehérvár, and Torda, and to facilitate their economic activity, he gave them the right to elect magistrates, hold markets, trade free of duty, and pay lower taxes. New German immigrants revived the mining industry, some new mining towns — Offenbánya, Aranyosbánya, Torockó — were established. The new urban settlers, Hungarians and Germans, combined with earlier castle-folk who had won similar privileges to form Transylvania's Hungarian citizenry. Gyulafehérvár and Kolozsvár had been granted by the king to Transylvania's bishop in the 13th century. Kolozsvár became a royal free town in 1316, but Gyulafehérvár developed more slowly, for it remained in the bishop's domain. Doboka castle was granted to the Kökényes-Radnót family, and the fortress lost all significance, while the settlement remained a village and served as the manorial center of the Dobokai {1-453.} family estates. For a time, Küküllővár retained its military function, then, in the 15th century, it was also given away by the king. The lands belonging to Torda castle, and lying between the Aranyos and Maros rivers, were settled ca. 1270 by Székelys, who thus founded Aranyosszék. The villages that had been attached to royal castles passed into private ownership, and the royal estates were reduced to the lands around the new mountain fortresses, although this still added up to a huge area. The centre of the Transylvanian Basin, along with part of the mountain regions, became the property of aristocrats and other nobles.
Royal grants thus enlarged the scale of private property, and the landowners, facing a shortage of labour in the aftermath of the Mongol invasion, resorted to Romanian manpower, drawn either from the royal estates or recruited from abroad. As far as is known, the first derogation from the exclusive royal right to invite Romanian settlers was conceded by King Ladislas IV (1272–1290); his reign was bedeviled by constant civil strife, and he was probably hoping to win the support of a hostile Church when he allowed the canon (káptalan) of Gyulafehérvár to settle sixty Romanian families on the latter's estates at Enyed and Fülesd. Loránd, the voivode of Transylvania, may have been referring to these people when, in 1294, having invested a castle, he allowed the defenders free passage from Várad through the mountains to the Maros, and made reference to Romanians living on Church property (Olachi ecclesiae) beyond the Belényes region.
The last decades of the 13th century witnessed a steady decline in the power of the Crown at the expense of the aristocracy and the Church. The disintegration of the political system undermined central authority and control; one consequence was that more Romanians obtained property by unlawful means. King Andrew III (1290–1301) vainly attempted to stem the tide of lawlessness. In 1293, he decreed that all Romanians in Transylvania who had



The Emergence of Feudal Estates and Oligarchic Rule
https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/77.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:29:57]
settled on private land be relocated on crown lands between the two {1-454.} Székes rivers in Fehér county (thus the number could not have been very high). Yet the king soon made new concessions. He upheld the privilege granted to the canon of Gyulafehérvár, as well as the disposal of the onetime crown property of Oláhtelek (Tohán); in 1292, he gave permission to the Illyei family, in Hunyad county, to settle Romanians on their estates along the Maros at Illye, Fenes, and Szád (Olacos possit aggregare ac aggregatos retinere).
If these concessions and the ongoing practice of unlawful settlement did not produce a mass migration of Romanians, it is mainly because until the end of the 13th century, the central authority managed to keep the Romanians under control in the border-guard districts. As indicated by the above-cited case, the incidence of Romanians on private estates was essentially limited to the Southern Carpathian foothills and the southern part of the mid-Transylvanian mountains. The numbers must have been small. Sources indicate that in districts of Eastern Hungary still partly inhabited by Romanians, there were, before 1300, around a thousand Hungarian and Saxon villages, but only six clearly Romanian villages, and five of these — Enyed, Fülesd, Illye, Fenes, and Szád — had obviously Hungarian-derived names. The name of the fifth, Tohán (Oláhtelek), reveals that it was implanted in a Hungarian environment. It is evident that these Romanian settlements, the first known to have been established on private land, arose within the boundaries of older Hungarian — and perhaps also Slav — villages.
Political events spurred the spread of private estates in the second half of the 13th century. In 1257, King Béla IV tried to satisfy the ambitions of his restless son, Stephen, by giving him a share of power, much as Béla's father had done with his own son. Stephen was put in charge of the eastern half of Hungary, including Transylvania, and given the title of 'junior king', though he also styled himself Prince of Transylvania. Stephen maintained his own royal court and pursued an independent foreign policy. The {1-455.} Mongols had left Transylvania in a lamentable state, and Stephen did much to reorganize the region and its defences; nobles who volunteered their support were rewarded with generous grants of land. However, it was not long before the jealousy between father and son plunged the country into a protracted civil war. At first, Béla's army forced Stephen to retrench at Feketehalom castle, in the Barcaság. When some of Béla's forces came over to his side, Stephen counterattacked. He routed the king's army, won a decisive victory at Pest in the spring of 1265, and compelled Béla to leave him in charge of Eastern Hungary. Although this state of affairs endured until Béla's death in 1270, the reconciliation of father and son was more apparent than real; both strove to recruit supporters among the aristocracy, necessarily by landgrants that added to the latter's already huge estates.
Stephen V had reigned for only two years when he died. The great landowning families exploited the fact that his son, Ladislas IV, was a minor. Relying on private armies recruited on their estates, and exploiting their authority as counts, they became for all practical purposes the lords of their provinces. In Transylvania, however, no voivode managed to win lasting authority; between 1274 and 1284, the post changed hands each year among members of various families. When Ladislas finally took over the reins of power, he tried to secure the support of a branch of the propertied Borsa clan, which had lived in Transylvania since the conquest and also owned lands in Bihar; his choice fell on Loránd Borsa, who held the post of voivode between 1284 and 1295. However, Ladislas lacked the talent to overcome the country's internal divisions and restore order. Under the influence of his Cumanian mother, he was drawn to the recently settled, and largely pagan Cumanians: he adopted their pagan ways, turned openly against the Church, and relished playing the role of Attila. With few exceptions, Hungarian aristocrats opposed this pagan orientation. When, in 1285, the Mongols burst into Transylvania, the Hungarian barons {1-456.} accused Ladislas of having invited the invaders; they seized the king and extracted a promise that he would change his ways. The Mongols and Cumanians wrought death and destruction over a wide area, including Transylvania; finally, as the main Mongol force headed homeward, laden with booty, it was soundly trounced by the Székelys from Aranyosszék. As for Ladislas, he soon broke his promise and returned to his Cumanian friends and their ways; by exploiting the disunity among Hungarian aristocrats, he managed to prevail time and time again. In the end, his unbridled behaviour provoked even the Cumanians, who assassinated him in 1290.
His successor, Andrew III, inherited a country that was devastated and woefully lacking in order and security. During his short reign, which was also troubled by pretenders to the crown who enjoyed the support of foreign powers, Andrew proved unable to pacify the country. Shortly after he became king, he toured Transylvania in an attempt to quell the spread of anarchy, but violence and extremism prevailed. One typical instance involved the Saxons, who had been at odds with Transylvania's bishop for over a century because of the tithe. When, in 1277, the geréb of Vizakna was executed on order of the bishop, the vengeful Saxons burst into Gyulafehérvár's



The Emergence of Feudal Estates and Oligarchic Rule

cathedral during Sunday mass; they set fire to the church, carted off its treasures, ransacked the episcopal archives, and massacred many of the townsfolk. The perpetrators were excommunicated, but that did not stop the Saxons from continuing their campaign against the bishop. The decline of central authority facilitated the occurrence of many such outrages, and the king's visit brought no lasting peace. Soon afterwards, in 1294, the voivode Loránd Borsa — who, together with his brothers, ruled over much of Eastern Hungary — took up arms, first, against the Bishop of Várad, and then, against the royal forces dispatched to restrain him. A bitter campaign ended with his defeat, but his successor, László Kán, proved equally troublesome. The new voivode, who {1-457.} was also count of Szolnok, took advantage of the king's preoccupation with a rash of rebellions to treat Transylvania as his private domain: he confiscated royal revenues and seized control of the Saxon and Székely counties as well as of the mining towns. In 1307–1309, he would not allow the vacant bishopric to be filled until the Church agreed to his nominee, the Dominican friar Benedek. The voivode's entourage included a deputy voivode who came from the distinguished Ákos clan, a court magistrate (udvarbíró), and a county clerk (főjegyző) who was none other than the archdeacon of Küküllő; he filled numerous posts of castellan with his relatives and confiscated the property of those who refused to serve him.
This pattern was repeated in other parts of the country and by 1301, when Andrew III died, a dozen provincial lords ruled virtually autonomous territories. The country was on the brink of becoming a patchwork feudal state in which the king exercised only nominal authority over his vassals. The protracted struggles for succession also favoured the oligarchs. The Árpád dynasty had died out with Andrew III, and there ensued a vicious struggle for power among descendants on the female side of the family. The Pope championed Charles Robert, a scion of the French Anjou dynasty in Sicily, but initially this candidate failed to win the favour of Hungary's aristocrats. Instead, the majority of the latter opted for Bohemia's Wenceslas, and when he withdrew, offered the throne to Bavaria's Prince Otto. Transylvania's Saxons were the first to rally to Otto, and it was probably on their advice that he sought to win the support of that region's powerful voivode, László. The rapprochement was encouraged by László's wife, a German princess related to Otto, and she offered to marry her daughter to him. In the meantime, however, László had discovered the weakness of Otto's candidacy. Seeking foreign backing for his rule, László betrothed his daughter to Serbia's King Uroš II, and when Otto arrived to meet his future father-in-law, László had him arrested. In 1308, the {1-458.} Transylvanian voivode released Otto, and acknowledged Charles Robert as king, but he refused to surrender Hungary's royal crown.
The Hungarian public, on the other hand, would recognize the new ruler's legitimacy only if Charles Robert was crowned with St Stephen's crown. That crown's guardian, the voivode László, did not even attend the national diet convened to elected the king; ensconced in his mountains, he chose to wait and see. The Pope's legate, Cardinal Gentile, attempted to negotiate with László; the latter proved intractable, and in 1309 he was excommunicated by Gentile. This severe censure achieved its purpose: the following year, László handed over the coronation regalia, and he even promised to surrender the royal rights and possessions that he had usurped. Charles Robert visited Transylvania in 1310, but he spent ten years in bloody struggle against Hungary's power-hungry oligarchs, and during those ten years, László remained the master of Transylvania. He would not admit royal troops into the fortresses under his control, and when in 1315 Miklós Pok was named to succeed him as voivode, László simply refused to hand over the reins. Finally, in 1316, after László had passed away, the king's forces prevailed over his sons' armies at Déva, then defeated the sons' ally, the former palatine Kopasz Borsa, at the battle of Debrecen. The Crown thus reclaimed Transylvania, and in 1318, Dózsa Debreceni was named voivode. The consolidation of royal authority was not easy. Dózsa had to suppress a revolt by Majos, son of Majos in 1319; and even his successor Tamás Szécsényi, of the Kacsics family, who became voivode in 1321 — had to contend with the lingering power of László Kán's sons.
The voivode Tamás applied a firm hand to squash rebelliousness in Transylvania. He wrung allegiance from the supporters of László Kán and other freebooting nobles, then proceeded to deal with the Saxons. Pursuing their endless quarrel with the bishop, the latter ravaged Gyulafehérvár once again, in 1308. When, after László's death, the new voivode retained authority over the Saxon {1-459.} county, Henning, the geréb of Péterfalva, led a rebellion against him; Cumanian troops had to be summoned from the Great Plain before the Saxons were finally brought to heel in 1324. Tamás Szécsényi made a show of obeisance to the king, but in Transylvania he was as autocratic as his predecessor László. The bishop of Transylvania would repeatedly complain about Tamás's forceful attempts to obtain Church property for himself and his supporters.

Education at Home and Abroad 4. TRANSYLVANIAN CULTURE IN THE MIDDLE
AGES The Gothic and Renaissance Styles
The Romanesque Style in Transylvania
In architecture and art, as in other spheres of culture, Transylvania followed the Hungarian model. The region suffered less physical damage in the Ottoman era, and thus harbours more medieval architectural relics than most other parts of the country. The styles that prevailed differ little from those in the rest of the Kingdom of Hungary; some were adopted to a greater extent than others, and there emerged a certain differentiation that coincided with the socio-ethnic map, giving a distinctive stylistic character to Hungarian, Saxon, and Romanian districts in the counties, as well as to the Székelyföld and Szászföld. Apart from the Székely and Saxon churches that were fortified against the Ottomans, Transylvania's architecture is marked by a profound conservatism. Stylistic tendencies were more resistant to change than in Western {1-548.} Europe, or, indeed, than in the rest of Hungary. The many churches erected by parishes and monastic orders in the Middle Ages were not well adapted to the needs of Protestant rites, yet they survived the Reformation unscathed.
Thus, while Transylvania holds few outstanding monuments, it became a veritable museum of Hungarian medieval architecture. The bishopric encompassed a vast area but required substantial buildings only at the episcopal seat. Prior to the arrival of the mendicants, the religious orders erected only a few monasteries in Transylvania, and nothing is known about the style and shape of the original royal monasteries at Meszes and Kolozsmonostor. The lay aristocracy's estates were less prosperous and more dispersed than in the rest of Hungary, and their buildings were commensurately more modest. The records show 28 familial monasteries in Transdanubia, 32 on the Great Plain, and 15 in Upper Hungary, but only four in Transylvania.
Still, the oldest surviving cathedral building of Hungary is found at the episcopal seat of Gyulafehérvár. The present church is not the original structure, which, judging from excavations, was modelled on the triple-aisled basilica of St. Stephen at Székesfehérvár and had an adjoining round chapel or baptistry dating from the 10th–11th centuries. These buildings were torn down in the late 1100s, when construction started on the present cathedral. It was designed in the late French Romanesque style favoured by the royal court, as a triple-aisled basilica, with a transept and a wide arched choir; the cathedral's facade bears some similarity to that of familial monasteries, and is topped by two spires. The builders incorporated a few carved stones from the earlier, 11th century church. The damage wrought by the Mongols was repaired by stonemasons who had worked on the famous chapel at Ják; the polygonal, early Gothic chancel was built some time after 1270. The cathedral suffered more damage in 1277, when Saxon insurgents, led by Gyán of Vizakna, put it to the torch. Jean de Saint Dié {1-549.} participated in the restoration, which began in 1287; four years later, Transylvanian Saxon carpenters erected a new roof. The cathedral, with its subsequently added Gothic and Renaissance chapels and carvings, reflects a succession of Hungarian architectural and sculptural styles. It contributed to the dissemination of these styles in Transylvania, where Hungarian and Saxon churches bear its imprint.
Still within the confines of the Transylvanian bishopric, in the Kraszna county village of Ákos, stands the church of the eponymous family's monastery; built, around 1150, in pure Romanesque stye, it a has a nave flanked by aisles, an apsidal chancel, and twin towers. A church of similar, but somewhat simpler style was erected around 1200 at Harina, probably by Simon Kacsics, one of the first great landowners to move to Transylvania from Hungary proper; it was designed to serve as a family monastery, but Kacsics got involved in a plot to assassinate Queen Gertrud, and he lost his estates, including Harina, which was acquired by Transylvania's bishop. A charter from 1238 attributes the monastery at Almás to the Borsa clan; judging by a fragment from the Romanesque frame of a tower window, the church may date back to the 12th century, and it may have been built by the Borsa family. Another of the original settling clans, the Mikola family, came somewhat later (though still before the Mongol invasion) in following the fashion for family monasteries. The church at Gyerőmonostor, which bears the name of one of the clan's branches, is notable for its nobles' gallery, twin towers, and decorative sculptures; like other early churches, Hungarian and Székely, in Transylvania, it has a single nave, without aisles.
Given the absence of documentation, it is impossible to determine when the earliest stone churches — apart from



The Romanesque Style in Transylvania
https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/92.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:30:08]
the episcopal and monastic edifices noted above — were erected in Transylvania. Although it is likely that, by the 11th century, the royal county seats had stone churches, there is neither archival nor archaeological evidence {1-550.} of such a church at the oldest seats, in Doboka, Kolozs, and Torda. If the castle excavated at Malomfalva was, as is supposed, the seat of Uzd county, then the style of its church may be typical of such edifices at other county seats; it had a nave without aisles and an apsidal chancel divided off by a rounded arch. The church at Küküllővár, built around 1200, was a more elaborate structure. With its single nave, apsidal chancel, and twin spires, it resembled the church at Gyerőmonostor; its Romanesque windows followed the model of some churches in other parts of Hungary, notably at Egregy and Csaroda. After the Mongols had come and gone, Küküllővár's church was expanded by the addition of aisles, and its twin spires were combined in a huge tower that dominated the western facade. The 'hilltop church' at Segesvár underwent a similar transformation. The comitatus of Segesvár was formed after the dissolution of Fehér county, possibly prior to the Mongol invasion. The first mention of its castle (castrum Sex) dates from 1280; by 1298, it had acquired a German name, Schespurch, but there are references to 'comitatus Segusvar' as late as 1339. The king probably donated this centre to German settlers when the Székelys of Kézd moved to the Aranyosszék district, but it became a royal free town only in 1367, at which point it acquired jurisdiction over the neighbouring Saxon villages. This is how the Saxon seat of Segesvár, the latest and last of the Saxons' autonomous districts, came to be established, and its history is mirrored by that of the 'hilltop church'. The first church on the site was a typical Hungarian (Székely) edifice, with a single nave and an apsidal chancel, and it remains as the undercroft of the later basilica, which had aisles and a broad tower in its western facade. In the 14th century, the basilica was converted into a Gothic hall church. The triple-aisled church at Küküllővár may also be the work of Saxons, but Küküllő county did not become a Saxon seat; thus Küküllővár remained the administrative centre of a county whose Saxon inhabitants, like the Hungarian peasants, became villeins.
{1-551.} The remodelling of the churches at Küküllővár and Segesvár into triple-aisled edifices is linked to the northward expansion of Saxon settlement after the Mongol invasion. With the exception of Gyulafehérvár Cathedral and of the monastic churches, triple-aisled churches were built by Saxons for Saxons. The same type of church is found even in Saxon localities that are outside the main areas of Saxon settlement, at Boroskrakkó, Tövis, and Déva, which lie in predominantly Hungarian districts. These are, in Southern Transylvania, the most westerly occurrences of aisled churches, and, together with Küküllővár and Segesvár, the most northerly as well; the triple-aisled churches of Homoróddaróc and Földvár are the most easterly examples. Only single-nave churches are found north and east of this line.
Transylvania's Romanesque, single-nave {1-552.} parish churches are identical to those built prior to the Mongol invasion in other parts of Hungary, and they can be identified with the region's Hungarians and Székelys. Although some must have been raised before the Saxon settlement, the present state of research does not allow any of these village churches to be dated farther back than the end of the 12th century. One reason is that there has been little archaeological investigation of the cemeteries located — on King Ladislas's orders — next to the churches. Moreover, even those 11th–12th century churchyards that have been excavated cannot be linked conclusively in terms of chronology to the adjoining churches, for the most of the latter were rebuilt after the ravages of the Mongol invasion, generally in the shape of the original. Future research may allow the origins of stone churches to be dated farther back than 1200; until then, it can merely be assumed that at least some of them were preceded by churches constructed of wood or wattle-and-daub, the positive detection of which lies beyond the capacity of today's archaeologists.
There are nevertheless some clues to chronology. The most significant of these is the shape of the chancel in the single-nave parish churches. The apsidal chancels came first; the oblong shape appeared around the time of the Mongol invasion. The dating is complicated by the fact that in some churches, notably at Domokos and Kide, the original apsidal chancel was reconstructed in oblong form. This would indicate that the church dated from before the Mongol invasion, were it not for evidence that some of the brand new churches dating from after the event were given, out of sheer stylistic conservatism, an apsidal chancel. With that caveat, it can still be concluded that the majority of parish churches with apsidal chancels date from before the Mongol invasion. It follows that, like the toponyms, the distribution of these churches indicate the extent of areas that had a Hungarian or Székely population prior to 1241. Further clues to dating are given by identifiable, Romanesque fragments (carvings, capitals, portals, window-frames) from churches that were destroyed and subsequently reconstructed in the Gothic style. An outstanding example is the late 12th-century Romanesque, southern portal of the Gothic church at Marosszent-imre. Its rose window includes not only the characteristic motifs of that period's high art, but also, for

the first time, elements of contemporary folk art, and thus reveals the criteria for the decoration of village churches. Similar, early decorative fragments date the ruined church at Baca and Bonchida's church, which was considerably transformed after the Mongol invasion.
The earliest Transylvanian Hungarian (and Székely) village churches were small, single-nave edifices, with an apsidal chancel separated from the nave by a rounded arch. The windows, one of which was in the middle of the apse, were narrow, with rounded arches. Some of the churches had a patron's gallery, on rounded arches, situated along the western wall. Most of the churches dating from before the Mongol invasion lacked a tower; in the exceptional cases, e.g. at Tompaháza, the spire was built over this gallery. The entrance porch, below the gallery, had decorative carvings. Capitals and corbels inside the church bore modest ornamentation. {1-553.} The more ambitious patrons may well have commissioned frescoes, for the latter can be found at churches in Hungary proper, but no traces of frescoes survive in Transylvanian churches dating from the 13th century.
The early type of parish church, with single nave and apsidal chancel can be found — whether in the original shape, rebuilt, or in ruin — in almost all Hungarian-inhabited areas, and most of these can be dated on archaeological or documentary evidence to before the Mongol invasion. The northernmost occurrences are at Domokos, in the Lápos valley, and along the Nagy-Szamos River at Baca and Csicsókeresztúr. On the lower KisSzamos, in the area settled by the Hungarian clans, the best-preserved example is at Szentbenedek; the churches at Szásznyíres, Cege, Szarvaskend, and Bonchida suffered minor modifications, while a description survives of the church at Alsózsuk. In the Kolozsvár-Kalotaszeg district, the Mikola clan's five villages (Szamosfalva, Magyarkiskapus, Derite, Kalotaszentkirály, and Magyarókereke) each have a church with a rounded apse, as do Kajántó and Magyarsárd. The early style is found on county land in the Maros and Aranyos valleys, at Marosfelfalu, Abafája, Mészkő, Tompaháza, Magyarpéterfalva, Marosszentimre, and Bokaj. In the Székely seats, all but two of the churches are on the same pattern: Marosszentkirály (the only one with a spire), Harcó, Marosszentanna, Marosszentgyörgy, Nyomát, Székelyvaja, Várhegy, Karácsonfalva, Homoródszentmárton, Bibarcfalva, Oklánd, Szentlélek, Felsőboldogfalva, Bögöz, Réty, Gidófalva, Árkos, Miklósvár, Gelence, Gyergyóalfalu, Csíksomlyó, Csíkrákos, Csíkszentdomokos, and Csíkszentkirály. Quatrefoil-plan churches, which are common in Hungary proper, occur in Transylvania at Algyógy, in the west, and at Székelyudvarhely and Gyergyószentmiklós in the east.
The early churches are most numerous in the area between the Kis- and Nagy-Szamos, along the Maros, and in the Székelyföld. They are, however, noticeably less common in an area favoured by {1-554.} the original Hungarian settlers, the Mezőség, which lies between the Szamos and Maros rivers, as well as in the Nagy-Küküllő valley. Apparently, the Mezőség was slow to recover from the ravages inflicted by the Mongols. As for the Nagy-Küküllő valley, most Székelys left the district after the Mongol invasion to resettle in the Aranyosszék and, perhaps, also in the eastern seats; their former lands were occupied by Saxons, who in the 14th century erected Gothic churches. The history of the churches at Küküllővár and Segesvár has already been noted, and archaeologists will perhaps uncover the traces of other single-nave churches in the formerly Székely-inhabited area.
Reconstruction after the Mongol invasion introduced a new style: the apse was no longer rounded, but squared. Traces of the original rounded apse have been found at a few locations, such as Kide and Domokos, and others may await discovery. In some cases, the application of the new style may conceal the earlier origin of the church, but many entirely new churches were erected. The latter were distinguished not only by the squared apse, but also by the spire raised over the gallery. In a period marked by the threat of Mongol incursions and internal anarchy, these towers also served defensive purposes. Concurrently, towers were built all over Transylvania, by the king and by private individuals, to serve as fortified residences; typical examples include the round tower at Sebesvár and the square towers at Radna and Kelnek. There must have been many more than those that survive, for in 1291 King Andrew III decreed that 'any towers or fortifications built with hostile intent onto churches or in any other place must be torn down.'[25] By then, the threat of civil war was more immediate than that of the Mongols, and the king wanted to deprive his opponents of potential strongholds. His instructions were not carried out in all places, but private initiative also played a part in the destruction, and many a church tower must have been pulled down.
{1-555.} Another characteristic feature of churches built after the Mongol invasion was a greater wealth of decorative stone-carvings. Within the general area where Hungarian churches are found, two workshops are definitely known to have operated, both around Kolozsvár. One of them was probably linked in 1250 to Kolozsmonostor. Fragments

of capitals from the onetime churches at Magyarszentpál and Kolozs, and of the baptismal font from Szamosfalva, reveal that this workshop applied geometric motifs in Benedictine, late Romanesque, or Norman style; these were probably passed on by Ják's master craftsmen, some of whom worked on the cathedral at Gyulafehérvár. The other workshop, located in the town of Kolozsvár, was commissioned by the bishop of Transylvania, Péter Monoszló, sometime between 1270 and 1330 to create the portal of the church at Vista, which had a square-backed chancel. The same craftsmen decorated the portal of the subsequently-reconstructed church at Magyarnagykapus, and are responsible for the carved fragments that remain from the Romanesque churches of Türe and Gyalu. These essentially Romanesque buildings were decorated with early Gothic motifs of realistic vine-leaves, bunches of grapes, and flowers.
In the second half of the 13th century, churches with square-backed chancels began to appear in the districts where earlier churches displayed rounded apses, and also farther to the northeast, in the Sajó valley. Churches distinguished by this new style of chancel were, or are located at Sajóudvarhely, Sajószentandrás, Magyarborzás, and Szászmáté; at Kozárvár, by the Nagy-Szamos River; along the Kis-Szamos at Alsó- and Felsőtök, Magyarderzse, Bádok (with an original Romanesque tower), Kecsed (now in ruins), Ormány, Néma, Ördöngösfűzes, Szásznyíres, and Botháza; in the vicinity of Kolozsvár, at Pata, Magyarfenes, Vista, Ketesd, Sárvár, Türe and Gyalu (where only fragments remain), and Magyarkapus (a portal); along the Aranyos, at Gerend (an outstanding example), Alsójára, Várfalva, and those, known only from {1-556.} documents, at Szarkad and Mezőörke; along the Maros, at Magyarrégen (ruin), Maroskoppánd, Marosnagylak (exceptional for its twin spires), Marosújvár (ruin), Enyedszentkirály, Alsóorbó, and Borbánd; and, finally, in Hunyad county, at Őraljaboldogfalva, Zeykfalva (with a western tower), and Malomvíz-Kolcvár (with a tower over the chancel), the last two being Greek Orthodox churches. Only two churches of this type were built in the Székelyföld, at Nyárádszentmárton and Ikafalva. In the aftermath of the Mongol invasion, the Hungarian fashion for single-nave churches left its mark on the fringes of the Saxon lands, at Récse, Rosszcsűr, Szászfehéregyháza, and Homoród.
Of the 89 Transylvanian Hungarian churches — with apsidal, quatrefoil, or square-ended chancels — noted above, only 41 figure in the papal tithe-list for 1333–37, a compilation that was supposed to include every locality with a Catholic church. On the other hand, the list includes many Hungarian Catholic churches that either no longer exist or were completely rebuilt. Moreover, many villages bore the name of their church's patron saint, and probably most of these boasted of a Romanesque church dating from the 13th century. Taking all this into consideration, the real number of 13th-century Romanesque churches must have been closer to twice the above figure, i.e. around two hundred. Indeed, even that figure probably does not fully reflect the proliferation of Romanesque churches in Hungarian villages during the 12th–13th centuries, for it does not take into account all the churches totally destroyed by the Mongols, nor those that were only rebuilt in the 14th century, in Gothic style.
Church-building in Hungarian villages was directed by the landowners and Székely notables. Similarly, the fiftyfour Romanesque churches found in the Szászföld, between Szászváros and Brassó, were probably built on the initiative of the social elite, i.e. the gerébs. It is hardly likely that the first German settlers, who arrived in the mid1100s, had brought along organized builders' {1-557.} workshops from their homeland. No doubt they soon raised churches, but these were probably simple, rudimentary edifices that, by the early 1200s, no longer satisfied the needs and tastes of a growing population. Although there is no archaeological trace of these original churches, several must have been standing by 1192, when the deanery of Nagyszeben was established.
According to an earlier hypothesis, it was the Teutonic Knights who, during their brief stay in the Barcaság, gave impetus to the building of more elaborate churches by the Saxons. However, the only building activity of the Order that is attested by archival and archaeological findings involves castles. Although the Knights only had permission to build wooden forts, they chose from the outset to build of stone, and this was one of the causes of their expulsion. The location and shape of their five castles can only be deduced from archaeological findings. The ruins of a rectangular fortress, with four corner turrets, at the Tatár Pass (near the locality of Slon, in what became Wallachia) are probably those of Kreutzburg, a Teutonic fort mentioned in documents. The remains of a rounded tower, unearthed near today's Rucăr, indicate a onetime castle of similar layout. Judging from its name and shape, Marienburg (Földvár) may have been a third castle of the Knights. Similarity in shape leads to the conclusion that Feketehalom may have been a fourth. The fifth of the Order's fortresses may be the citadel, with a triangular ground plan, located on Cenk Hill at Brassó, and later known as Brassovia. Both Földvár and Brassovia had chapels, the first with a square-ended, the second with an apsidal chancel. Since there are no grounds for



The Romanesque Style in Transylvania
https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/92.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:30:08]
attributing to the Order the construction of any village churches in the Barcaság (with the possible exception of Prázsmár's church, which was originally laid out in the shape of a Greek cross), it may be concluded that the Teutonic Knights were content to have chapels in their fortresses and, owing to the short duration of their stay in the Barcaság, did not initiate the building of churches in the villages under their control.
{1-558.} When they came to build churches, the Saxon settlers had to fend for themselves, and the only models close at hand were the churches of Hungary. The oldest of their churches is believed to be the one at Kisdisznód. Its owner, Gosselin, a royal chaplain of Walloon origin, donated it in 1223 to the monks at Kerc. Of considerable size and quality, the church is in the form of a triple-aisled basilica, with a rounded apse linked by a rectangular forecourt to the nave. The design called for twin spires, in the manner of Hungarian family monasteries, but these were never completed; the porch is adorned by skilfully carved orders of arches and flanked by blind arcades. On the evidence of the western, patron's gallery alone, it can be concluded that the Kisdisznód church was commissioned by a geréb family of Walloon origin — an ancestry that distinguished more than one of Transylvania's 'Saxons'; when the head of this family entered royal service, he gave up ownership of the estate. However, this edifice was not the prototype of Romanesque churches in the Saxon territories. To be sure, all of the Saxons' Romanesque churches — with the exception of those at Prázsmár, Récse, Rosszcsűr, Szászfehéregyháza, and Homoród — were triple-aisled basilicas, in which the nave had a flat, wooden ceiling, and the aisles, lower, barrel-vaulted ceilings. They were distinguished from the Kisdisznód church by a massive tower, built into the western facade, that held a patron's gallery overlooking the nave; this was the architectural solution generally adopted by German settlers in the East for locating the gallery. In Hungary, the layout is found only in Saxon churches, although in two of the latter, at Szászorbó and Szerdahely, a different solution was adopted: instead of the gallery forming part of the tower's inner wall, the tower rests on the pillars of the gallery, which was the Hungarian method. The patron's gallery is, in itself, evidence of the leading role played by gerébs in churchbuilding. They participated in religious services from on high, distancing themselves from the commoners. The most typical tower-galleries are found at Nagysink, {1-559.} Morgonda, Brulya, Nádpatak, Homoróddaróc, Kaca, Földvár, and Kereszténysziget. The tower of the basilica at Vizakna is a unique exception: it rises over the chancel, in testimony to the exalted status of the Saxon gerébs.
The stylistic evolution of the chancel in Saxon churches followed the Hungarian pattern. While the earliest churches around Szeben (at Nagy- and Kisdisznód, Sellemberk, Nagycsűr, and Kereszténysziget) had rounded apses, there are some square-ended sanctuaries farther east, in the Nagysink seat (Nádpatak, Brulya, Morgonda), where the Saxon settlement came later. The Saxon churches' ornamented and arcuated portals follow different models. That of Kisdisznód is found at Nagydisznód, Boroskrakkó, Petres, Kaca, Nagysink, Felek, Oltszakadát, and Holcmány; the Ják portal is copied at Homoróddaróc, Szászsebes, Keresztényfalva, Kisprázsmár, and Ugra. The stylistic influence of Gyulafehérvár's portal is most clearly visible at Höltövény, but it touched, to varying degrees, all Saxon church-portals. The only Saxon church with a transept is the one at Kistorony; the inspiration probably came from Gyulafehérvár Cathedral. In sum, the plans and ornamentation of 13th-century Romanesque churches in the Szászföld followed the Hungarian pattern, the main exception being the tower-galleries projecting over the nave.

AGES Orthodox Romanians and Their Church Hierarchy
{1-567.} Romanian Greek-Orthodox Priests and Churches
Among Transylvania's Hungarians and indigenous Slavs, the Byzantine Christianity of the gyulas disappeared without trace during the reign of King St. Stephen. In the Middle Ages, Greek Orthodoxy remained the rite of Romanians, as well as of Russian, and, later, Serb immigrants, who eventually assimilated to the Romanians thanks largely to their shared religion. In the course of the formation of Romanian identity, ethnicity and religious faith became inextricably intertwined. As late as the mid-1900s, Greek Orthodox Romanians in Hunyad county would refer to the few remaining Romanian Calvinists in their neighbourhood as people 'under Hungarian law' (de lege ungurească), and to themselves as people 'under Romanian law' (de lege românească). Yet 'Romanian law' ius valachicum in medieval charters — originally denoted the civil, and not the ecclesiastical code. According to a recently-published history of Romanian jurisprudence, this was 'a system of customary law, preserved by a disintegrating community, and which an alien, feudal state, in the midst of consolidation, acknowledged and applied among indigenous Romanians and those who settled farther afield'. In Galicia, Poland, Silesia, Moravia, and in the Slovak areas, in Serbia and Croatia it had the force of statute law; in Hungary (including Transylvania), it survived as 'an early feudal legal system [...], an ineradicable Romanian tradition [...], a form of local autonomy that conferred no privileges'. It was rooted in 'shepherds' customary law, which became identified as "Vlach law" in neighbouring countries where Romanians practised transhumance.'[26] Documentary sources shed light only on the exactions and concessions of the authorities: 'sheep fiftieths' (quinquagesima ovium), the tax generally imposed on Romanians in all countries, and the rights of the leaders (katunar, cnez) of Romanian settlements throughout East-Central Europe concerning, which touched on such matters as jurisdiction and the operation of mills.
{1-568.} Apart from Thessaly, the Transylvanian borderlands were the only place where several cnezships are known to have been combined into a single administrative unit. The Romanian border-guard districts in Hungary itself and beyond the Carpathians — in the Hátszeg, Fogaras, and Máramaros regions — were each governed by a high royal official bearing the title of voivode. In the mid-1300s, the voivodes of Hátszeg and Fogaras broke away and established a separate state within the Wallachian voivodeship and the associated province of Severin. The voivode of Máramaros and Moldavia was expelled by Bogdan, a rival from Máramaros; in compensation, his descendants, the Drágffy family, were allowed to retain the title of voivode of Máramaros until the end of the 14th century, when the region became a nobiliary county. The Catholic bishops of Transylvania and Várad also appointed voivodes over their Romanian cnezes who, of course, were answerable to their ecclesiastical landlords and not to the king. Where a voivodeship lapsed, jurisdiction over the Romanian cnezes passed to a 'cnezial court' (kenézi szék) chaired by the castellan, a Hungarian nobleman appointed by the king; the earliest known cnezial court — in 1360, at Hátszeg — was composed of twelve cnezes, six priests, and six Romanian commoners (olacus populanus). In the mid-1400s, 'Romanian law' was still being applied by the cnezial courts in Hunyad county, at Hátszeg, Déva, and Jófő.
Information is scarce on the cnezes' prerogatives in the settlements under their authority, but presumably they were essentially analogous to the Hungarian 'village smoke' (falu füstje), i.e. jurisdiction over non-capital offenses. Hungarian contemporaries regarded this authority as similar to that exercised by landowners over villeins; the members of the Hátszeg cnezial court in 1360 included both the cnez Longus Bazarab and a Romanian commoner, named Mihai, who is identified in the document as the former's villein (iobagio). Similarly, a document from 1389 mentions that two cnezes from the Egerszeg estate, in Temes county, were cum {1-569.} jobagionibus suis, i.e. with their villeins, although both of the cnezes were themselves the villeins of Hungarian noble landowners. It may be that the cnezes were entitled to services as well as fines from their subordinates, although, strictly speaking, the latter could not have been their villeins if both served side by side on cnezial courts. As noted, only the ennobled cnezes had seigniorial rights over Romanian commoners, and when they became integrated into the Hungarian county system, the cnezial courts ceased to exist. From that point, cnezes who had not been ennobled would rank with the feudally-dependent Hungarian village magistrate. Originally, and contrary to the opinion cited above, 'Romanian law' had been a privilege, the legal code of a semi-autonomous district similar to that of the Székelys

https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/94.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:30:19]
and Saxons. Thus the main reason why the development of a Romanian 'nation' was held back is that the ennobled cnezes chose adhere to the nobles' nation.
The information about cnezial courts in the Hátszeg region also reveals that the Greek Orthodox Church was systematically associated with 'Romanian law', for the court had a fixed quota of priests. Many sources attest that Romanian priests generally came from cnezial families and enjoyed the attendant property rights. The Hunyad county village that now bears the name Keresztényalmás was already in existence in 1362, when it was the property of the 'comes' László, son of Musad; that year, László exercised his 'cnezial right' to establish a settlement at Zalasd. In 1387, his son János was both the owner of the village of Almás and its priest. Similarly, in Máramaros, on the northern fringe of Hungary's Romanian-inhabited area, the priest at Gyulafalva, Mirislav, belonged to the village's ennobled cnez family. There are numerous other examples in Hunyad county. In Pestenye (first mentioned in a document from 1360), the priest probably issue of a cnezial family, for that pattern still prevailed in the 15th century; indeed, in 1479, one branch of the family changed its name to Pap (meaning priest). When, in 1411, the property of the cnezial family at Borbátvíz was {1-570.} divided up among thirty-five male heirs, the first of the latter to be listed in the document was Dobrota, a priest and archdeacon of the Hátszeg district; the records show that his brother Koszta's three noble sons were all priests in 1494, and one of them bore the uncle's name, Dobrota. In 1444, one of the seven propertied cnez brothers in (Nalác)vád was identified as a parish priest, presumably of the church in that village. Others of the same ilk, mentioned in documents, include Sztojka Dalsánpataki Pap (1472) and Miklós Nadabori, son of the Romanian priest Lukács (1515). Thus there is evidence, stretching over one-and-a-half centuries, that the landed cnez families would customarily send one or two sons into the priesthood and the others into military service. To compensate for the repeated division by inheritance of their ancestral property, these prolific families sought to augment their wealth through church benefices and royal donations of land.
The landed cnezes not only provided priests but also built churches and acted as patrons of the church. The 'Romanian churches', at Osztró, Klopotiva, Pestenye, Demsus, and Tustya, that were served by priests listed in 1360 as members of the Hátszeg cnezial court (ecclesiarum sacerdotes olachales), must have been such cnezial churches. Péter, the priest at Osztró, was also an archdeacon (archidiaconus) in the Hátszeg district. Two of these churches survive in their original form. The one at Demsus is a simple Byzantine-style structure of local cut stone, some of which dates from Roman times; its spire, located in the middle, is similar to those of Transylvania's Romanesque, Catholic churches, and thus the building can be dated to the 13th century. The church at Osztró, also constructed of stone, displays Transylvanian Gothic style, and dates therefore from the 14th century. Reconstruction has obliterated the original appearance of the other three churches, but it is likely that they, too, were built of stone, much like the Romanesque, 13th-century churches at Zeykfalva, Sztrigyszentgyörgy, and Kolcvármalomvíz.
{1-571.} Thus, by the 13th century, cnezial churches in the Hátszeg region were substantial stone buildings, either of Byzantine style, or, more commonly, of a style similar to Hungarian churches in Transylvania. They testify to the comparative prosperity of the cnezes, who would continue to raise churches in the 14th–15th centuries, until they were ennobled and converted to Catholicism — at which point some of them may have transferred their churches to that rite. Although some consider the 13th-century church at Őraljaboldogfalva, a small, rural Hungarian town, to be of Vlach-Romanian origin, that is hardly likely, for the parish's Catholic priest figures in the 1332–37 tithelist. On the other hand, the Orthodox church at Borbátvíz (served, in 1411, by the cnez priest and archdeacon noted earlier) may well date back to the 13th century; the present building is not the original, which may have been built of stone. One can include in this list the trefoil-plan Byzantine church of the monastery at Priszlop (Hunyad county), which was established around 1400 by Abbot Nicodim, founder of Wallachia's first monasteries; and two churches, at Nalácvád and Dalsánpatak, of which the only trace is the recorded name of their priests. No further information is available about medieval Romanian churches in the Hátszeg district, although there must have been more than the ones noted above.
Similarly, in the Romanian districts of Déva and Jófő, there must have been more Orthodox churches than the two, known only from references to their priests, at Keresztényalmás and Rakovica. Hunyadvár came into the ownership of the Hunyadi family in 1409. The Romanian church of Vajdahunyad was built some time after 1458, in the Byzantine style, on the plan of a Greek cross. At one time, a stone church must have stood in a dependency of Hunyadvár that once bore the name of the local, ennobled cnez family, Nadabor, and is now called Nadrap

puszta; its priest was noted above for his cnez background. The Romanian voivodes of the bishops of Transylvania and Várad were considered equal in {1-572.} rank to Hungarian church nobility; they had Gothic stone churches erected, around 1400, at Lupsa, Zalatna, Kristyor, and Ribice. In 1349, the bishop of Várad permitted his voivode in Venter to appoint a priest — the earliest recorded occurrence of such an authorization. First mentioned in 1503, the archdeacon of Segesfalva, which was in the Belényes voivodeship of Várad's bishop, may have had a stone church as well. Records for 1538 and 1555 indicate that the same bishop's authority extended over Sebes, Kiskoh, Kocsuba, and Polyána, where the churches may date back to before 1526, and could have been built of stone, or perhaps of wood; all the known Orthodox churches dating from the Middle Ages and located in villages to the north of Hunyad and Alsó-Fehér counties were built of wood. Várad's bishop also owned Romanian villages on the western flanks of the Central Transylvanian Mountains. These lay beyond the confines of Transylvania, as did the Romanian districts on the western side of the Southern Carpathians, in Severin Province. There is little information regarding the latter districts' Romanian churches and priests — Glimboka's priest is mentioned in a source dating from 1493 — but, as noted, Greek Orthodox people must have settled in the area many years before. Reference has already been made to the record from 1364 indicating the presence of a Romanian priest in the Máramaros, which also lies outside Transylvania. That area's voivode and cnezes, whose ennoblement came early, must have had other stone churches in addition to the one at the monastery of Körtvélyes, which was founded before 1389. However, the only relevant sources date from 1516 and indicate the presence of wooden churches in Rozália, Visóorosz, and Havasmező.
To return to Transylvania, the records show Romanians living in the Szászföld and the Fogaras region ever since the early 13th century, but there is a dearth of information about their churches. In the second half of the 14th century, and more intermittently in the 15th century, the Wallachian voivodes were the feudal lords of {1-573.} estates in the Omlás district of Szeben and in Fogaras; they may well have initiated the construction of Orthodox churches, but no trace remains of the latter. Nor is there much trace of Orthodox churches in the Saxon seats, although the account books of (Nagy)szeben dating from around 1400 mention a Romanian priest, as does a charter from 1494, in reference to Alsóvárosvíz, in the Szászváros seat. The lack of data may be due to the fact that medieval Romanian churches were wooden buildings subject to decay and disappearance without trace. There is a suggestion that in the 14th century, a Greek Orthodox monastery stood at Szkorej, in the Fogaras region, but the data is unreliable.
The only medieval Romanian stone churches (other than monastery churches) about which reliable data exists are those in the Hátszeg district and at Lupsa, Zalatna, Ribice, and Kristyor. Some of these churches — at Demsus, Sztrigyszentgyörgy, Zeykfalva, Ribice, and Kistyor — are adorned with Byzantine frescoes dating from the early 15th century. The paintings, which bear Cyrillic inscriptions, depict saints (including, at Kristyor, Hungary's canonized Kings Stephen, Ladislas, and Prince Imre), along with the churches' founders, cnezes attired in western knightly garb. It remains a mystery whether, in the Middle Ages, Orthodox churches, of stone or wood, stood in the Romanian villages of Severin Province and of the Fogaras and Máramaros regions.
There is, on the other hand, ample evidence in medieval sources of the existence of Romanian wooden 'chapels' (capella olachorum). All but one were located on the estates of Hungarian noblemen, along the Nagy-Szamos and in the south of the Mezőség, between the Kis-Szamos and Maros rivers. The exception is the Greek Orthodox round church at Guraszáda, in Hunyad county. It was raised by the Ákos clan's Illyei family, after 1292, when King Andrew III gave them permission to settle Romanians on their estates, which bore the Hungarian names Illye, Fenes, and Szád. {1-574.} This early, seigniorial stone church lies in the same general area as the Romanian cnezes' 13th-century stone churches, which probably served as a model. A source dating from 1468 mentions another village on the same estate, Papfalva; judging from its name, which means 'priest's village', it must have had a church, though probably not of stone. Romanian settlers were allowed by their Hungarian landlords to have churches and priests, but since their cnezes were merely village judges, not privileged landowners, the settlers could afford to construct only wooden churches.
Due to the late start of Romanian settlement, documents begin to mention chapels only at the very end of the 14th century. The word 'chapel' suggests wooden construction, and this is explicitly confirmed in several sources. The earliest reference, from 1391, is to Oláhfráta, where the chapel was erected soon after neighbouring landowners had established — without permission — this 'large Romanian village' in the vicinity of Magyarfráta. The other chapels noted in early charters were also located in the Mezőség, at Rőd (1398), at Oláhpeterd (1415), where a

Romanian cross was raised on the wayside, at Bogács (1430), at Dank (1435) — the only chapel on the left bank of the Kis-Szamos —, at Gerebenes (1447), where a house was built for the Romanian priest, and at Faragó (1451). The wooden churches at Pakocsa, Keménytelke, Lekence, Ikland, and Mezőkapus (first mentioned in 1539) may also have been erected prior to 1526. Farther south, Romanian wooden chapels become scarcer. The one at Nagyalmás (1418), in Hunyad county, was also on the right bank of the Maros; the only wooden chapels on the left bank are those at Erkes (1462) and at Szélkút (1500), in Kis-Küküllő county. The chapels in the Szilágy region were concentrated in a few estates: Erked, Görcsön, Kucsó, Bosháza, Győrtelek (1450; on the same estate, there were Hungarian Catholic stone churches at Kusaly, Diósad, and Széplak), and Kertésztelek (1470). Along the upper reaches of the Nagy-Szamos, chapels were to be found at Major, Oláhszentgyörgy, and Naszód (1450). There must {1-575.} have been more Romanian wooden churches than those mentioned in the surviving medieval charters, but it cannot be assumed that chapels noted at a later date are of medieval origin, even if the reference is to a restoration. What is certain is that, from the 14th century onward, Transylvania's Romanian folk art gave rise to wooden churches whose distinctive style has disappeared without trace.
The ultimate patron of the Romanians' churches was their feudal lord, for the Catholic landowner would consider Catholic and Orthodox churches alike as part of his property. The landowners included patron's galleries in their commission for Catholic churches, and their permission was needed for the erection of Romanian Orthodox churches and chapels; László Hunyadi and Matthias Hunyadi gave such permission at Vajdahunyad in 1456 and 1458, respectively. The patron's concurrence was probably needed in the appointment of Romanian priests; at Vajdahunyad, it was the landowner, Beatrix Frangepán, who in 1516 appointed an archdeacon, Péter Szokács, to supervise Romanian priests on the estate. Thus when an estate was subdivided or sold, its valuation took into account Catholic and Orthodox churches as well as mills. When, for example, in 1450, Miklós Kémeri and László Jakcs divided up their estates in the Naszód area and in the Szilágyság (Szilágy region), they included Catholic churches and Orthodox chapels in their list of assets; and when, in 1462, Tamás Barcsai sold a part of his estate in Erkes, it was described as 'the plot of a certain Romanian priest (presbiteri volahalis) together with his chapel.'[27]

Settlements and Urbanization 3. THE ROMAN PROVINCE OF DACIA
(Endre Tóth) Collapse and Withdrawal
The Population: Dacians and Settlers
Eutropius records that 'Trajan, after defeating Dacia, brought in huge masses of people from the four corners of the empire to settle in towns and rural areas; for Decebalus's long war had left Dacia {1-101.} short of men'.[43] The historian's succinct summary of cause and effect confirms that the war had severely depleted Dacia's indigenous population, leaving Trajan with the task of repopulating the province. Rome commonly rewarded veterans with land in newly-acquired provinces, and it was equally common for soldiers' families — and for merchants who catered to the army and the local population — to settle near the camps. If this had been the extent of settlement in Dacia, Eutropius would not have bothered to mention it. It is therefore significant that the historian stressed Dacia's uncommon circumstances: the disappearance of much of the local population, and the concerted attempt to repopulate the province.
The fate of an indigenous people depended on why and how Rome conquered their land. By definition, peaceful annexation was accompanied by little if any loss of life. With Dacia, this was not the case: Trajan occupied the territory after a century and a half of animosity that culminated in two wars. The protracted struggle, the reverses suffered, Decebalus' arrogance all made the Romans hate Dacians.[44] The actions of the Dacian king after the first war only sharpened this hatred. Decebalus broke his oath by failing to respect the terms of peace. He enticed and captured a high-ranking officer of the occupation army, attempted — unsuccessfully — to make the Roman change sides, then 'had the presumption to demand territories reaching to the Istros, as well as compensation for the costs of the war, in exchange for Longinus [his hostage]'. The officer solved Trajan's dilemma by committing suicide.[45] Decebalus thereupon tried to have the Emperor murdered at his headquarters in Moesia.[46] These actions only served to infuriate the Romans, who foreseeably would show no mercy for the Dacians. The wars and broken pledges would colour the Romans' image of Dacians for centuries to come.
These immediate antecedents of the second war explain why the Romans were intent on totally annihilating their enemy. In any case, the extermination of Barbarians who dared to attack the {1-102.} Imperium Romanum raised no ethical problems. This form of retaliation had already been justified by Augustus (Res Gestae Divi Augusti 3), and put into practice. Subsequently, Marcus Aurelius wanted to exterminate the Jazyges.[47] Annihilation did not mean merely the death of enemy soldier, but also the forced conscription of the vanquished and their dispatch to distant provinces, as well as slavery for others. Thus the Dacians who stood by Decebalus to the end could not have expected mercy. This helps to explain their final act, immortalized on Trajan's column: the Dacian elite committed mass suicide by poison. Most of the 10,000 gladiators in the post-victory circus games, which lasted for 123 days,[48] must have been captured Dacians. Criton, physician at the Emperor's court, participated in the Dacian campaign and recorded its history; drawing on his work, later chroniclers said that the Romans had captured 500,000 Dacians, and that, in the end, Trajan spared the life of only forty of them.[49] Although these estimates may be excessive, they no doubt reflect the nature of Daco-Roman relations and scale of Dacian losses. Thus the wars ended not only in the destruction of Dacia's military might but also in a sudden drop in its population. Even fewer were left after many Dacians fled to escape the Romans' yoke.
Dacian men were conscripted into auxiliary units and sent to Britannia or to the east. Little is known about their fate; there is nothing to indicate that any of them returned to their homeland after demobilization. In assessing Dacia's depopulation, it is important to note that the new province coincided with the centre of Decebalus' kingdom, where much of the war had been fought; it was the region that suffered the greatest loss of life, the one where Decebalus' faithful fought to the death, be it by suicide. It was mainly this region's inhabitants who were either massacred by the Romans, sold as slaves, or forced to flee beyond Rome's reach.
When founding a new province, Rome would generally impose on the natives a self-serving, territorial structure of administration {1-103.} (civitas peregrina). The local people would be divided up by tribes, unless a tribe had shown uncommon belligerence, in which case it was broken up. Tribal elites were drawn into the civitatis, which remained initially under military supervision. This tribal aristocracy benefited from Rome's favours — for

instance, by being the first to be granted Roman citizenship — and would eventually provide leaders (princeps) for the civitatis. The latter provided the organizational framework for progressive Romanization and were the basis for future towns. It seems that the Romans suspended this practice in the case of Dacia, where there is no trace of any civitas. One reason must have been the absence of a tribal elite; already decimated under Decebalus' autocratic rule, the elite was largely eliminated along with the rest of the Dacian nobility, the pileati, as a consequence of Trajan's wars. Remarkably, only one tribal name survived, in vicus Anar(torum), a village belonging to the Anartes tribe in northern Transylvania;[50] however, the village was inhabited not by Dacians but by Celts, their former subjects. There also survives the name of a princeps: T. Aurelius Afer, a tribal leader who originated in Splonum (Dalmatia), and was thus not a Dacian either.[51] The other reason why the Romans may not have formed civitatis was that the residual population was to sparse to warrant such a vehicle for Romanization. Therefore, as noted, Dacia's towns were created not on the basis of, or alongside civitatis, but from military settlements and their satellite communities. This meant that what was left of the indigenous population did not participate in the urban experience that fostered Romanization. The epigraphs found in the province show no 'Thraco-Dacian' names in the membership of urban institutions, whether as council members or as priests of the cult.
Epigraphs and other archaeological finds provide some clues to the process of resettlement 'ex toto orbe Romano', in Eutropius' phrase. The first group to be settled, at Sarmizegethusa, consisted of veterans of the legions, who were Roman citizens. Of those {1-104.} whose names indicate Italian origins, some had served with the legions in the Rhineland, western Pannonia, or Moesia. On the basis of the geographical incidence of personal names, it can be concluded that a significant proportion of the settlers came from western Pannonia and Noricum, even though such origin is rarely indicated in epigraphs.[52] This conclusion is supported by burial rituals proper to the NoricumPannonian region, by archaeological finds, by the spread of certain domestic articles in Dacia, and, above all, by some distinctive features of northern Dacia's archaeological culture.
The other large group of Middle Danubian settlers came from Dalmatia; as numerous epigraphs attest, they arrived in tight-knit groups, almost like parts of tribes, and settled mostly in the territorium metalli, the Alburnus. Some of the newcomers had not yet acquired Roman citizenship, and were mere peregrines; there are references in epigraphs to 'Anduenna Batonis filia', 'Maximus Batonis filius', 'Liccaius Epicadi filius', 'Epicadus Plarentis filius'. Many belonged to the Pirusta tribe (e.g., 'Dasius Verzonis filius Pirusta ex k[astello] Avieretio') and lived in closed communities (Vicus Pirustarum) in Transylvania's Érc Mountains, where they had been resettled to launch mining operations. Many of the descendants of Dalmatians, Noricumians, and Pannonians rose to prominence as leaders of the municipii.
It is likely that the settlers from Pannonia and Noricum included not only Roman citizens but also the majority of those bearing Celtic names (Bonio, Bucco, Cotu, Veponius). Over time, the resettlement of people from these regions helped to strengthen trade relations between Dacia and the proximate provinces.
Many of the settlers were soldiers, not only in the case of Sarmizegethusa, but also in the communities that sprang up on the outskirts of military camps and which later grew into towns. The government probably encouraged veterans to settle in the province, if only with mixed success. The ethnic heterogeneity of the {1-105.} province's population is due in no small measure to the army. At first, only one legion, composed of Roman citizens, was stationed in Dacia. It was backed up by auxiliary forces, many of which were ethnic units, and many of the latter came from Thracian-inhabited Moesia. Some regular regiments were also Thracian (the cohors II Bessorum, the archers of the I Thracum sagittariorum, and the Thracum equitata), and they continued to recruit in the south. Others, while not of Thracian origin, replenished their ranks with Thracian recruits: the cohors I Tungrorum Frontoniana (previously stationed in Pannonia), which guarded the camp at Ilosva, and the cohors I Brittonum miliaria civium Romanorum, which performed similar duties at the Felsőkosály camp. Some Thracians moved to the new province as veterans, like the family of Sueuethes Traibithi filius, who had been discharged in 86 A.D. from the Judean army's cohors II Thracum.[53] Heptapor Isi filius of the Bessus tribe of Thracians, who was demobilized in 158, also remained in the province.[54] Despite all the soldiers of Thracian origin, and despite the Moesian settlers, the percentage of Thracian names in Dacia is surprisingly low. The reason may be sought in the very proximity of the region they came from, for this factor explains population fluctuations in other provinces. Indeed, soldiers of the legion V Macedonica at Potaissa would commonly return to familiar ground, their earlier location at Troesmis in Moesia Inferior. Discharged Thracians also tended to return home. Such was the case with Aulenus, who left Dacia Superior in 144; of Bithus, who belonged to the Bessus tribe and left Dacia Inferior in

https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/18.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:30:31]
140; and another Bessus, M. Aurelius Teres, who returned to his homeland at the end of the 2nd century. Sextus, son of Busturio, also settled in nearby Thracia after his discharge in 164, although he was of Pannonian origin.[55] Letters of discharge found south of the Danube clearly show the veterans' inclination to leave Dacia.
Many of Dacia's new inhabitants originated in the eastern provinces or the southern Balkans, where Greek was spoken; their {1-106.} ethnic units had been transferred from Asia Minor or Syria. The province's mountainous terrain was difficult to defend, and Romans liked to use specialized troops, such as Palmyrian archers, three units of whom were stationed in western Dacia. The province played host to other Syrian troops as well, including the numerus Surorum sagittariorum, which guarded Arutela (Bivolari) on the Olt fortified line, the cohors I Tyriorum sagittariorum, the cohors I sagittariorum equitata, and units from Ityrea and Commagene. After the Marcomanni wars, when Rome offered inducements to immigrants, settlers arrived from the east and Asia Minor. Syrian merchants appeared in growing numbers in the Severus era, and soon established a dominant position in the province's commercial life. These immigrants from distant lands kept their ethnic identity, for they formed separate associations (collegia). The presence in Napoca of Galatians from Asia Minor is noted in an epigraph that dates from the middle of the 2nd century, but most of collective inscriptions date from the Severus era, indicating a wave of immigration to the province at the end of that century. Late 2nd century epigraphs mention an association of people from Asia Minor in Apulum, and the presence of Galatians in Germisara. In 235, the roster of the collegium Asianorum in Napoca included Thracians from the Balkans or Asia Minor.
Some three thousand Dacian residents have been identified by name. Estimates based on the ethnic derivation of names indicate that around 2,200 were Roman, 420 were Balkan or eastern Greek, 120 were Illyrian, 70 were Celtic, 60 were Thraco-Dacian, and another 60 were Semites from Syria; there are also German, Asian, and African names among them. At two per cent, the proportion of Thraco-Dacian names is strikingly low. The Thracian-Dacian linkage is contested, but attempts to distinguish two sets of names have brought no conclusive result; most of them appear to be authentic Thracian names, borne by people who came from the region south of the Danube. Significantly, names of obvious Dacian origin {1-107.} (Bitus, Butus, Decebalus, Diurpanaeus, Sassa, Scorilo) are found outside the province, in other parts of the empire, where Dacians were transported as slaves. In Noricum, which had a hundred-year lead over Dacia in Romanization, 24 per cent of the names are those of indigenous Celts, indicating that a comparatively large number of Celts had remained in the province and been exposed to Romanization. This contrasts with the pattern in Dacia, where the indigenous population suffered a great decline in numbers and was largely excluded from Romanization.
Dacia absorbed two great waves of immigration. In the early decades following the conquest, settlers mostly came from the west, including, as noted, a significant number from Noricum and Pannonia. Dacia's active trade with Pannonia, and with Northern Italy through Aquileia, is reflected in the development of its material culture. Contact with northern Italy had a determining influence on the style of stone carving in western Pannonia and Noricum, and a similar influence can be detected in Dacia.
In Dacia, and within its Transylvanian region, three types of memorial carvings have been found. The first type, in the shape of a medallion framed by laurels, has a niche at the rear, with shell-like decoration, and bearing the carved portrait of the deceased. This design originated in northern Italy and can also be found, though less frequently, in Noricum and Pannonia. It became so popular in Dacia that it even influenced the decoration of tombal stelae: on the upper part of the upright, rectangular stone, the carved portrait of the deceased was often enclosed in a similar medallion. Tombal aediculae, in the form of three-sided enclosures, also won popularity in Dacia; a splendid example was uncovered intact in Micia. Bas-reliefs on the aediculae's walls depicted servants holding jugs, pans with handles, or cups, symbolizing purification and refreshment for the deceased. It is possible that the style reached Dacia from Pannonia, where many examples have been found. The roofs of the aediculae were carved in the shape of a pine-cone or a {1-108.} pyramid. As in the case of ornate graveyards, this design probably came from Aquileia, either directly or via Noricum, Pannonia, and Dalmatia. Another popular design, a carved pair of lions facing each other, crowned some stelae or served as graveyard decoration; it bears the stamp of western influence, although, in Dacia, it might also have had an eastern inspiration.
The presence of settlers from Noricum, Pannonia, and Illyria is indicated by the spread of tumulus burials in Dacia, principally in its Transylvanian region. After the bodies were cremated on a pyre, their ashes were covered with earth mounds of varying scale. The rite was widely practised in western Pannonia and eastern Noricum. Close

https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/18.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:30:31]
links between the regions are revealed not only by the tumuli, but also by the grave goods, some of which is pottery identified with Noricum and Pannonia. The Noricumian and Pannonian settlers' largest cemetery, with more than 300 tumuli, can be found in Hermány (Caşolţ). Similar traces are found in Kálbor (Calbor) and Magyarigen (Ighiu). Some of the earth mounds were enclosed by a stone wall. The earliest and most finest example was found at Sarmizegethusa: the Aurelius family's vast tumulus, 21 metres in diameter, covering the remains of a young girl. The tumuli in the small graveyard at Csolnakos (Cinciş) were enclosed by circular walls; the nearest equivalents were found at Carnuntum, in western Pannonia.
Apart from the burial rites, there is little trace in Dacia of the religious practices that prevailed in Noricum and Pannonia. Settlers from Celtic and German areas presumably brought with them the cults of Suleviae, Epona, and Hercules Magusanus. The spread of the Silvanus cult in Dacia may also owe something to Pannonia. An altar in honour of Iuppiter Depulsor, erected by a man with an Illyrian name, evokes the many similar altars to Jupiter 'the preventer' found in the Poetovio region of western Pannonia.
Settlers who came from the south (Moesia) and the east (principally Syria) left little trace of their personal belongings, but many {1-109.} of their religious objects survive. Tombal covers that depict a 'funeral feast' — the deceased reclining on a couch, with his wife sitting in an armchair next to him, and facing a tripodal table — are clearly of southern, Greek inspiration. Of similar derivation are cult images, fashioned in marble, of the so-called Danubian cavalier god; these are most common in the southern part of the province. A link with Moesia is also indicated by the style of southern Dacia's pottery.
The religious beliefs of settlers from the Near East are displayed in many finds, including altars and temples dedicated to the deities of their place of origin (Diis patriis). The monuments bear witness to an attachment to their homeland, and also to the organized, intimate character of their traditional beliefs. The most important of these cults is that of their principal deity, Doliche, whom they identified with Jupiter; altars and cultic images dedicated to Doliche have been found in many parts of Dacia. The Palmyrians had separate temples in Sarmizegethusa, Porolissum, and Micia. The origin and diversity of the beliefs is confirmed by the many eastern deities named in epigraphs, including Iuppiter Tavianus, Erusenus, Mater Troclimene, Iuppiter Heliopolitanus, Azizus, Bonus Puer, Balmarcades, Nabarazes, Malagbel, Bellahamon, Benefal, Iarobolas.[56]
Dacia was one of the empire's Latin provinces; official epigraphs attest that the language of administration was Latin. Legionaries and settlers from western regions who were of Italian origin and conversant with Latin contributed to the diffusion of the language. Given the early date of the resettlement of Illyrians and Celts, it cannot be assumed that they were bilingual and had been significantly Romanized. They may have known some Latin, but it would not have become their principal tongue in the first half of the 2nd century; their full Romanization would have had to occur after they moved to Dacia. The Dalmatian Pirusti are a case in point. According to the wax tablets, many of them were illiterate — 'se litteras {1-110.} scire negavit'.[57] The other major group of settlers came from the areas where the official language was Greek. Some of them were aboriginal to their province of origin, and were neither Greek nor Hellenized; they included the Galati, as well as the Palmyrians. The latter were literate, which of course facilitates the retention of a language. Provincial custom required that their epigraphs be composed in Latin, but some Palmyrian-language texts have also survived. Few in number, they are nevertheless important, for no epigraphs have been found that originate with other Syrian communities in Europe. Greek epigraphs occur in greater number, and throughout Dacia, which is somewhat surprising in light of the fact that this was a Latin-language province. The presence of these two languages is also attested by inscriptions on bricks and earthenware, and it seem evident that both were commonly spoken in many parts of the province. It is indicative that Apulum's new name, 'Golden town', was expressed not in Latin but in Greek, as Chrysopolis.
Settlers from the south came from Thrace, where the official language was Greek, or from Moesia Inferior, where it was Latin, although both languages were in general use. However, the Thracians who came to Dacia scarcely helped to disseminate the use of Latin. Although many were soldiers whose language of service was Latin, their motherland lay in a partially Greek region, and they preserved their own tongue for a long time; they clung to their original names well into the early Byzantine period. The survival of the Thraco-Bessian language was later helped by the Christian Church, which accepted it for liturgical use.
The Thracian soldiers, who came from a region that had been under Roman administration only for some sixty

https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/18.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:30:31]
years, were hardly likely to have Latin as their mother tongue. Moreover, among the empire's peoples, the Thracians were the most resistant to Romanization. If, as hypothesized, there is an ethnic link connecting Thracians and Dacians, then the example of the former suggests {1-111.} that the Romanization the latter must have been a slow process. This is only one of several reasons why it cannot be assumed that the indigenous population of Dacia — under Roman rule for only 165 years, much less than any other province — assimilated the Latin tongue.
Dacia was marked by linguistic heterogeneity. There is no evidence of a unified linguistic community; indeed, epigraphs suggest the opposite. The one potentially unifying tongue was the province's official language, Latin, but it was the mother tongue of only a fraction of the population: military and civil officials, the majority of soldiers in the one, and, after 167, two legions that were stationed there, and the settlers of Italian origin. Nor was the wider adoption of Latin helped by the essentially Greco-Thracian character of ongoing interaction with the Balkans. The second wave of immigration, after the Marcomanni wars, originated in Greek-language regions and could not help to spread the use of Latin. The emergence in Dacia of Latin-speaking communities was also hindered by the fact the local tongue, and possibly its several dialects, were challenged not simply by the administrative use of Latin, but by the empire's two official languages, Latin and Greek. As a precondition to the linguistic conversion of the indigenous population, the newcomers would have had to establish strong, Latin-speaking communities. This could not occur over the short lifespan of the province, mainly because the non-Latin speaking settlers preserved strong links with their motherland and eventually chose in some number to emigrate from Dacia. Nor was the adoption of Latin helped by the delayed and limited process of urbanization. Thus the indigenous population had limited opportunities to become Romanized. Rome, for its part, seemed to have been much less intent on Romanizing the Dacians that it had been in the case of native peoples in its other provinces.
Archaeological finds attest that part of Dacia's indigenous population stayed on after the conquest. These include a few settlements and {1-112.} cemeteries, although in some cases the dating is uncertain, and it remains to be determined whether the settlements were inhabited both before and after the conquest. The cemeteries were discovered at Obrázsa (Obreja), Maroslekence (Lechinţa de Mureş), and Locuşteni. There are reports of other old Dacian cemeteries at Iacobeni, Radnót (Iernut), and Segesvár (Sighişoara); however, the tombstones at the lastnamed location bear Illyrian names. A cemetery at Mezőszopor has been fully excavated.
The cemeteries that can be linked to the indigenous population fell into disuse after the Roman withdrawal. Most of the graves contain cremated remains; the bodies were burned at a separate location, and then the ashes were either put directly into an oval pit, or placed in urns. The urns are generally identified with Dacian burial practice, although the Roman population elsewhere used them as well. Graves of people who were cremated on the spot are rare; this custom was more commonly associated with burial in a tumulus. The various forms of burial are sometimes found in one cemetery. The practice of burying uncremated corpses began in town cemeteries around the end of the 2nd century (Apulum, Napoca).
An ethnic analysis of cemeteries must take into account that two groups of free Dacians were settled in the province at the end of the 2nd century. The silver jewellery, bearing a granular decoration, that has been found in some cemeteries can be most plausibly attributed to Dacianized Carpi who lived across the province's eastern frontier. Similar jewels have been found in the Mezőszopor cemetery. It is, therefore, arguable that at least some of the graves belong not to aboriginal Dacians, but to Carpi or free Dacians who moved into Dacia shortly before 200.
The relics of the indigenous Dacians who remained in the province are uniformly plain. Apart from the cemeteries and traces of settlements, only the surviving ceramics can throw some light on their history and culture. There is no trace of epigraphs, stone carvings, depictions of dress, or jewellery. The ceramics suggest a modest {1-113.} standard of living that might have been the legacy of the lower strata of pre-Roman, Dacian society. Only a few earlier Dacian styles were carried over into the pottery of the Roman era. They are generally hand-crafted, and examples of wheel pottery are rare. The pots were sometimes decorated by manual indentation, or by the application of ribs shaped like twisted cords. The other characteristic Dacian vessel is the so-called Dacian cup: a low, thick-walled mug that broadens towards the mouth and has one or, more rarely, two handles. No other types of pottery have been uncovered in the settlements and graves. Some examples of hand-formed pottery have also been found in Roman camps, but analysis is hampered by the uncertainty surrounding their exact provenance. The discovery of Dacian pottery mixed in with Roman provincial products does not prove that Dacians recruited from among the

https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/18.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:30:31]
indigenous population were stationed at the camp. It has to be noted that after the Roman conquest, Dacian-type pottery reveals more about the producer than about the user. Even if such pottery is a contemporaneous product, its presence in military camps merely suggests that the users may have included soldiers and settlers as well as indigenous Dacians. This explanation is all the more probable since there is no hard evidence — neither military diplomas, nor names on military epigraphs — that native Dacians were conscripted into the province's auxiliary units. Moreover, this hand-made pottery could also have belonged to Celtic and Illyrian settlers. In their places of origin, the latter had used not only wheel pottery, but also simple, hand-made vessels; and they may well have resorted to the handiwork of local potters in their new home. In a province that encompassed many peoples, the presence of Dacian-type pottery is not a reliable indicator of the local community's ethnicity.
The province's Dacian earthenware does have a bearing on Romanization. In Pannonia, the production of handmade vessels had died out by the end of the 2nd century, and was replaced by a uniform style of wheel pottery. This did not happen in Dacia, where {1-114.} there is barely any sign of mutual influence in the potting styles of natives and settlers. The prevalence of certain types of pottery confirm the survival of a native Dacian population under Roman rule; but the unchanging style of that earthenware also indicates that this population was untouched by Romanization. In all other Roman provinces, the long and complex process of Romanization is revealed in myriad detail by archaeological finds. The latter confirm that Romanization had to leave concrete traces — in epigraphs, names, and evidence of continuity and adaptation in dress. The lack of such traces in Dacia can only lead to the conclusion that the native Dacians were not Romanized.
In conquered and provincialized territories, Romanization was a long process by which the aboriginal population progressively assimilated Roman customs and culture. Their material culture was the first to be influenced and modified by Roman techniques and styles. The standard of living of part of this population also changed. Becoming a Roman was a more or less voluntary act; the provincial administration and the civitatis provided a structure for the process, which was also nurtured by urbanization and military service. Tribal communities slowly disintegrated as the society was transformed by lengthy military service, urban life, commerce, and other economic activities. Assimilation of the empire's languages was fostered by military service that lasted 25 years. The linguistic change, which spanned many generations, led first to bilingualism, then to total replacement of the mother tongue. In the empire's provinces, this process generally took at least 400 years, if not longer. Romanization was deliberately promoted by external measures, and the gradual process of assimilation can be well-traced in the archaeological finds of the province. There is no trace of such a process in Dacia.
Romanization of the indigenous people in Dacia was only impeded by the fact that most settlers were bilingual. Proximity to camps manned by soldiers from Syria, Asia Minor, and Thrace {1-115.} scarcely helped the natives to become acquainted with Latin. The framework of civitatis, which in other provinces stimulated cultural adaptation, was absent. That absence is so striking that it may be explained not just by the comparatively small number of native Dacians, but also by a Roman decision not to Romanize the latter. The Romans' usual interlocutors of choice, a tribal aristocracy, had disappeared. Urbanization progressed slowly, and then only in part of the province. Towns grew out of the vici of military camps and not out of native settlements. The only civilian settlement to become a town was the one by the Apulum military camp, but even there, native Dacians did not participate in town life. One explanation is that most Dacians were shepherds and lived in the mountains, thus excluding themselves from Romanization. There is no evidence that, decades after the conquest, native Dacians might have been recruited into local military units, as was done in other provinces. There are no references to Dacian cults or a Dacian deity on religious memorials, nor any indication that the Dacians might have worshipped a local deity who, due to interpretatio Romana, bore a Roman name. And, apparently, no native Dacians partook of the creation of epigraphs, which was an intrinsic part of Roman culture and daily life.
The province existed for 165 years, too short a time for cultural assimilation. In Pannonia, much like in the other provinces, the material culture of the native population showed little sign of Romanization in the first 160 years of Roman rule. Everyday objects and apparel began to change only after the shock of the Marcomanni wars, and after another two centuries had passed, some regions were still not fully Romanized. In Dacia, the devastating Marcomanni wars were followed by a second wave of immigration from the east, a brief period of prosperity that coincided with the Severus dynasty and spanned a generation, more wars that spanned another generation, and then the Romans withdrew.



The Population: Dacians and Settlers

{1-116.} On epigraphs found in Dacia, the names Aelius and Aurelius appear with some frequency, and it has been suggested that they identify indigenous Dacians. The hypothesis is fallacious, for these were first names, borrowed from the emperors who had granted their bearers Roman citizenship. Ethnic origin was revealed by the surname, and the surnames of the new citizens who bore these two given names do not indicate Dacian origin.
In sum, there is nothing to demonstrate that the indigenous Dacians who stayed behind after the conquest had become Romanized. The influence of Roman technology and culture cannot be detected even in pottery, which would have been the lowest level of Romanization. For the agrarian Dacians, there was no need to adopt new techniques; their tools had been developed centuries earlier and remained in general use. That the native Dacians failed to adopt Latin as their mother tongue — the highest level of Romanization — is not simply a conclusion drawn from the lack of contrary evidence; the fact is that Dacia's historical and social development did not make such a transformation possible.

Place-names and Ethnicity
1. TRANSYLVANIA'S INDIGENOUS POPULATION AT THE TIME OF THE HUNGARIAN CONQUEST
The 'Tót' Slavs of Transylvania
Toponymy and Chronology
In light of the foregoing, an approach that combines etymology, typology, and chronology should make it possible to trace the evolution of the place-names linked to the various ethnic groups in Transylvania.
However, great caution must be exercised: unless the toponyms are analyzed according strict rules, the process can degenerate into unscientific speculation. The etymological derivation {1-350.} of a toponym is crucial only in the case of words that describe natural phenomena, and even then, it must be considered in the context of comparative linguistics. For example, the Hungarian word 'bükk' (beech) comes from the Slavic 'bik', but when it appears as the toponym 'Bükk' or its derivation, 'Bükkös', it must be regarded as a Hungarian place-name, originating with a Hungarian community that had been subject to some Slavic linguistic influence. Particular care must be exercised with regard to toponyms drawn from personal names, for the latter are commonly drawn from a multitude of sources and ages. Obviously, the Hungarian medieval village called Izsák (Isaac) did not get its name from a biblical community in biblical times; Alparét is derived from the German Albrecht, but this Hungarian village did not get its name through the application of German toponymic customs; similarly, Drág is derived from a Slavic personal name, but it is not the Slavs who applied the typically Hungarian, nominative singular form to designate a village. When the toponymic typology of different ethnic groups can be clearly distinguished, typological criteria must prevail over etymological considerations. Finally, chronology must take precedence over both typology and etymology. The Hungarian place-name Csesztve (Alsó-Fehér county) is derived from the Slavic proper name 'Čestivoj', but it displays the Hungarian toponymic pattern of place names. The Romanian name of the place, Cisteiu, is clearly derived from the Hungarian toponym; had it come from the Slavic 'Čestivoj', the Romanian equivalent of which is 'Cestivoiu', then the Romanian toponym would be 'Cestivoiul' or 'Cestivoii' — like Berivoii, in the Fogarasföld, which was adapted from a Slavic proper name in keeping with Romanian toponymic custom. In the case of Csesztve, the etymological and typological analysis is complemented by the chronological aspect: the Hungarians had taken a Slavic proper name and used it for a place name. The linguistic exchange between Slavs and Hungarians preceded — and did not coincide with — the naming {1-351.} of the locality. If a Hungarian toponym is adopted and adapted by Romanians, it must have been well-established before the arrival of the latter.
A different problem — and one which is highly instructive — arises with places that have multiple names, in two or more languages. The meaning of the several names may or may not be the same: thus the Hungarian/Romanian/German toponyms of two localities in Szeben county, Veresmart/Roşia/Rotberg and Fenyőfalva/Brad/Gieresau. It might be supposed (indeed, many believed) that these are simply translations. In fact, what commonly happened was that the ethnic group which arrived later did not translate the established toponym but took it over or adapted it phonetically. On the other hand, multiple names such as those cited above generally occur when at the time of the locality's establishment, there are several ethnic groups in the vicinity, and each of them formulates a toponym in its own language. Sometimes, the pattern in uniform: in the first example, all three toponyms are inspired by the site's red soil. Alternatively, the several toponyms may focus on different characteristics; in the second example, the Hungarian and Romanian toponyms evoke the site's vegetation (pines), while the German one (which means 'Gellert's grove') indicates the proprietor. Thus in the case of such multiple names, it may be assumed that the ethnic groups which gave rise to them were cohabiting in the district.
A study of Transylvania's toponyms was conducted in accordance with the previously-noted principles and completed some time ago. Thanks to its findings, the earlier and current names of the major rivers, along with the place-names that figure in pre-1400 documents (285 of them before 1200, 602 from the first half of the 14th century, and 1120 from the second half, for a total of 2007) can be analyzed and correlated with archaeological evidence to trace the geographical and historical links between the name-giving ethnic groups and to establish the chronological order of the latter. {1-352.} Since the documentary sources are sparse and often contradictory, they will be cited only when they contribute indisputable chronological evidence.

One of these uncontested facts is that in 892, the Bulgars were shipping salt to the Moravians, and that this salt could only have come from Transylvania. Thus, at the very least, some salt-yielding districts of Transylvania must have been under Bulgar control. The graveyards at Maroskarna and Csombord and other, more scattered Bulgar traces in southern Transylvania are obviously linked to this presence, and one can therefore expect to find {1-353.} Bulgaro-Slavic toponyms.
The second chronological fact is the Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin in 895. The Hungarian pagan rituals revealed by many graves found along the river valleys of the central Transylvanian Basin survived no later than the first decade or two of the 11th century, when they were generally supplanted by Christian rites. One would expect to find in the vicinity of these 10th-century burial places toponyms that are derived from Hungarian personal names, without article or suffix. There was probably some earlier, sporadic settlement by Germans, giving rise to toponyms that included the word 'Németi', but according to a document from 1224, the massive settlement of Germans in southern Transylvania took place around the middle of the 12th century. The earliest German placenames in the region presumably date from the same period.
The earliest evocation of Transylvanian Romanians is found in a document, dating from 1222, which refers to an 'Oláh land' (terra Blacorum) in the Fogaras district. Some Romanian toponyms could date from this period, and perhaps from earlier, but it is difficult to establish their precise date of origin. Romanian shepherds may have started centuries earlier to practice transhumance and drive their flocks from the Southern Carpathians to winter pasture on the Lower Danube. Historical and archaeological sources indicate that Bulgaro-Slavic toponyms appeared in the 9th century and Hungarian ones in the 10th; German ones did not appear in any number before the middle of the 12th century. It is therefore in this context that one must attempt to date the Romanian toponyms.
The names of rivers are usually the best indicators of the language spoken by a larger area's indigenous population. In Transylvania, the names of the three largest rivers — the Szamos, Maros, and Olt — go back to ancient times. The sole reference to the Szamos that survives from Roman times names it 'Samu(s)', and the earliest Hungarian version is Zomus (1231). The Maros is first mentioned in Herodotus, then appears as 'Morisos', 'Marisus', and 'Marisia'; its name is rendered in early Hungarian sources as 'Moris' (Saint Gellért's Deliberations, ca. 1044) or 'Morus' (Anonymus' chronicle from the early 13th century). The Olt appears in Ptolemy, then as 'Alutus' on the Peutinger tablets, as 'Aluta' in Jordanes, as 'Alt' in 1211, and finally, in 1233, as 'Olt'. Two more rivers may belong to this list. One is the Abrud: the earliest reference, dating from 1271, is not specifically to a river but to a terra Obruth. Some linguists believe that this name is derived from a hypothetical Dacian word, 'obrud', meaning gold. The name of the other river, Ompoly, may have a connection with that of the town — 'Ampei(um)' — noted in a Roman inscription; in 1299, the river is referred to as the 'Ompey' or 'Ompay'.
The main difference between the ancient and the medieval form of these river-names is the vowel shift a > o, or, with Abrud, o > a. If Transylvanian Romanians had adopted and adapted the Roman names, then Romanian linguistic rules would have produced 'Sameş', 'Mareş', 'Alut', 'Aurud', and 'Împei'. In fact, the rivers' modern Romanian names are Someş, Mureş, Olt, Abrud, and Ompoi or Ampoi. Instead of coming directly from the Roman, these names must have been adapted from those applied by other ethnic groups that cohabited with the Romanians in Transylvania. The first three are derived from the likely Slavic forms, 'Somuš', {1-354.} 'Moriš', and 'Olt' (the a > o vowel shift is typical of all Slavic languages), either directly or via the Hungarian adoption of these forms. The Romanian 'Abrud' must have been borrowed from the Hungarian, for the transformation of Obruth into Abrud, which occurred in the 14th century, reflects the typically Hungarian vowel shift o > a (as in the case of the Szamos and Maros). The Ompoly is a similar case, reflecting the typically Hungarian vowel shift ej > oj (cf. 'olej' > 'olaj'). The Romanian variant 'Ampoi' is derived from the German 'Ampoj', which is an adaptation of Ompoly by the typically Transylvanian-German vowel shift o > a (cf. 'Omlás' > 'Hamlesch').
Thus these ancient names were adapted into Romanian through the linguistic mediation of the Slavs, Hungarians, or Germans. The same can be observed in the case of other Transylvanian rivers that pass through the more populated areas, where there was a greater likelihood that their names would be lodged in the collective memory. In what follows, the names of tributaries of the three major Transylvanian rivers will be traced from the Middle Ages to modern times, in three versions: (a) Hungarian, (b) Romanian, and, where applicable, (c) German. The Hungarian forms, and those borrowed from Hungarian by (b) and (c), will be written in normal characters. Slavic forms, and those borrowed by the others from Slavic, will be written in italics. German forms, and those borrowed

from German, will be marked by capital letters. Names of unidentifiable origin will indicated by question marks.
First, the Szamos river-system. The tributaries of the Kis Szamos, from its source to its confluence with the NagySzamos, are, on the right, the Fenes — Feneşul and Füzes — Fizeş; and, on the left, the Kapus — Căpuş, Nádas Nădaş, Fejérd — Feurd, Borsa — Borşa, Lóna — Luna, Lozsád — Lojardul, Ménes — Valea Chicedului. Of the nine tributary names, seven are of Hungarian, and two of Slavic origin (from Lovina and Luža), but even the latter were adapted into Romanian from the Hungarian. In the case of the {1-355.} 'Ménes', the Romanians did not adopt this medieval name but adapted, instead, the more recent Hungarian variant 'Kecsedi patak (brook)'. The tributaries of the Nagy-Szamos are, on the right side, the Rebra — Rebra, Szalva — Salva, Széples — Ţibleş, and Ilosva Ilişua; and, on the left side, the Leses — Leşes, Ilva — Ilva, Sajó — Şieu — Schogen, ?Budak — Budac Budak?, Beszterce — Bistriţa — Bistritz, Tiha — Tiha, Lekence — Lechinţa — Lechnitz, and Mélyes — Patac. In this mountainous region, some names are of Hungarian origin, but most of them are Slavic, and some of these were borrowed by the Romanians directly from their Slavic neighbours. The tributaries found between the confluence of the Kis- and Nagy-Szamos and Transylvania's western are, on the right, the Beregszó — Bîrsău, Lápos — Lăpuş, Szőcs — Suciul, and Debrek — Dobric; and on the left, the Deberke — Deberche, Hagymás — Hăşmaş, and Almás — Almaş. Thus two names are of Slavic, and the rest, of Hungarian origin; one of the Slavic names passed into Romanian via the Hungarian, while the other may have been borrowed directly by the Romanians. The more imortant fact is that not one of the Maros' significant tributaries bears a name of Romanian origin. The majority are of Hungarian origin, one comes from the German, and those of Slavic origin passed into Romanian, in roughly equal proportion, directly or via Hungarian.
The tributaries of the Maros, to the right and down to the point where the river veers south, water part of the Mezőség plain; they are toponymically similar to the tributaries of the Szamos, which water another part of the same plain. The river-names Lucs — Luci, Komlód — Comlod, Ludas — Ludoş, and Aranyos — Arieş indicate that the mountains were inhabited by Slavs and the plain by Hungarians. The pattern changes in the valley of the Aranyos, whose tributaries are the ?Abrud — Abrud? (see above), Torockó — Trăscău, Jára — Iara, Hesdát Heşdate, and Tur — Tur. These names indicate the presence of Slavs and Hungarians, who were later joined by Romanians. The same observation applies in the {1-356.} case of the tributaries farther downstream along the Maros: to the right, the Gyógy — Geoagiu (1), Ompoly — Ompoi and AMPOI (see above), Gyógy — Geoagiu (2), and to the left, the ?Görgény — Gurghiu? (a brook with the same name, in Transdanubia, is mentioned in 1211), Nyárád — Niraju, the two Székás — Secaş streams, Sebes — Sebeş, Bisztra — Bistra, Dobra — Dobra, Sztrigy — Streiu — Strehl, Farkad — Farcadin, Cserna — Cerna, and, again, Dobra — Dobra. The major tributaries are the KisKüküllő and Nagy-Küküllő, whose Hungarian appellation is of Turkic origin, and has the same meaning — 'full of blackthorns' — as the Slavic name borrowed by the Romanians, Tîrnava. When the Hungarians arrived in this region (and its southern vicinity), they encountered a mixed Slavic and Turkic population. It can be concluded (with a degree of certainty that varies by district) that the Romanians came into contact with Slavs along the middle reaches of the Maros; there, they borrowed river names from the Slavs, Hungarians, and — in one instance — from the Germans. The absence of Romanian-derived river-names confirms that the Romanians arrived after the Slavs, Hungarians, and Germans. But whereas, in the Szamos region, it is merely a possibility that the Romanians adopted some Slavic river-names without Hungarian mediation, in the Maros valley, it is a certainty. This makes it likely that the cohabitation of Romanians and Slavs began earlier and lasted longer in the south than in the north.
A different ethnic composition is revealed by the names of the Olt's tributaries. A striking proportion of the names is of unknown (i.e. definitely not of Slavic, Hungarian, German, or Romanian) origin; some are said — more or less plausibly — to be derived from a Turkic language (Barót, Tömös, Barca, Tatrang, Brassó, Zajzon). The Slavic, Hungarian, and German river-names (and those with variants in all three languages) are intermingled. The tributaries to the right of the Olt are called Árapatak — Arpatac, ?Barót — Baraolt?, Kormos — Cormoş, Vargyas — Varghiş, Homoród — {1-357.} Homorod — Hamruden, Kozd (< Kövesd, 1206) — COSDU — Kosbach, Hortobágy — HÎRTIBAV/Hîrtibaciu — Harbach, CIBIN — ŢIBIU — Zibin, Feketevíz — Cernavoda SCHWARZWASSER, Sebes — Sebeş — Schewis, and Cód — Sad — Zoodt; the ones of the left at the Feketeügy — Fechetig, Kászon — Caşin, Kovászna — Covasna, ?Tatrang — Tîrlung?, ?Zajzon — Zizin?, ?Tömös — Timiş?, ?Brassó — Braşov?, VIDOMBÁK — GHIMBAV — WEIDENBACH, ?Barca — Bîrsa — Burze?, Hamaród Hamarud — SCHELLENBACH, Sebes — Sebeş, Árpás — Arpaş, BESINBÁK — BEŞINBAV BESCHENBACH, and ?Porumbák — Porumbac?. These names suggest that the Olt region's earlier inhabitants

were Slavs and another, perhaps Turkic people (just like in the Küküllő region to the north), both of whom were still present when the Hungarians, Germans, and Romanians arrived. It appears that the Romanians were the last to arrive, for they invariably borrowed river-names from the Germans and the Hungarians.
Thus the analysis of river names confirms the message borne by archaeological finds: the Hungarians who settled in Transylvania during the 10th century encountered Slavs throughout the region, along with a small Turkic group in the southeast, near Küküllő and Olt rivers.

Early Slavic Society in Transylvania
Traces of the Transylvanian Slavs' economic and social organization are as scarce as those concerning their ethnic origins. Archaeological finds indicate that the Bulgar settlers included soldiers, salt-miners, and gold-diggers. They probably also recruited Hungarians for the latter tasks; the expanding occupational group of Slavic and Hungarian miners was joined, after 1200, by Germans. In the social system of 12th-century Hungary, where sons took up their father's trade, Transylvanian salt-miners generally worked for the king, although a few of their villages were transferred to the Church. Some time before 1138, the monastery at Dömös received, as a grant from the royal family, thirty salt-miner households (mansio) somewhere in the 'Transylvanian parts' (in {1-367.} ultrasilvanis partibus); these miners were bound to supply an annual 24,000 slabs of salt. They probably worked mines situated along the Maros, for the salt was shipped down that river. In 1075, the monastery of Garamszentbenedek was granted half of the royal salt-tax levied at the point of loading on the Aranyos River, near Torda castle. The list, in the 1138 document, of thirty heads of families includes typically Hungarian names (e.g. Wosas, Besedi, Fuglidi, Boch, Himudi, Satadi, Uza, Eulegen, and Ellu), names of Slavic origin (Kinis, Senin, Sokol, Lesin, Wasil), ethnically neutral Christian names (Martin, Simeon, Isaac), and others of indeterminate origin. These are the earliest known names of ordinary Transylvanians from the Middle Ages, and they seem to indicate that Hungarians and Slavs made up the majority of the region's population.
The same document contains a list of twenty-five salt-shippers from the village of Sahtu. Each year, they transported the aforementioned, huge quantity of salt on two vessels, in six separate shipments, down the Maros River as far as Szombathely, near Arad. From there, transport was probably assured by the carters who worked for the abbot of Dömös. Sahtu is commonly identified with Sajtény, a village that had existed in the Middle Ages near Szombathely (Csanád county); however, there is a greater likelihood that Sahtu is one and the same as Sohtteluk (Sajttelek), a site first documented in 1291, and which in the 14th century was renamed Bencenc, after its new owner. The name Sajt is derived from the word 'só' (salt), and this meaning has been preserved in 'sajtalan', the vernacular variant of 'sótlan' (saltless). The 'telek' in the toponym indicates that the place was a 'terra', i.e. a oncepopulated, but now deserted site, and the location of Sajttelek — on the banks of the Maros in the Kenyérmező was more convenient for the shipping of salt than that of Sajtény, near Szombathely, which imposed a long and pointless return journey. The inhabitants of Sajt/Bencenc had Hungarians names, including Haláldi, Maradék, {1368.} Gyökér, Farkas, Süllő, Vasas, Sima, Nyomorék, Vendég, Ajándék, Bökény. Since none had a clearly Slavic name, it can be surmised that Hungarians predominated among shippers to an even greater extent than among saltminers.
An equally important (but less well-documented) resource, gold, was generally panned from rivers in this period, and not yet mined. Transylvania also supplied furs to the royal court. The Hungarian ruling elite levied a marten tax, the so-called 'mardurina', from the Slavs who lived in the mountains and forests of Transylvania, Slavonia, and Upper Hungary. As population grew, so did the payment of tax in the form of agricultural products, and hunting became a separate and specialized occupation. The 'daróc', i.e. a hunter who worked on behalf of the king, is evoked by toponyms that are found countrywide, and notably in the Transylvanian counties of Szolnok-Doboka, Küküllő, Kolozs, and Hunyad. In the document dated 1138, the Dömös monastery was also granted 'men in the Transylvanian parts' who were bound to supply each year 20 marten-skins, 100 leather belts, one bearskin, and one bison horn. There were probably Slavs as well as Hungarians among these hunters; the word 'daróc' is of southern Slavic origin and means a 'skinner' of wild animals. Transylvania remained Hungary's richest preserve of big game throughout the Middle Ages. The largest prey were the aurochs, which became extinct in the 12th century, and the bison, which lasted until the 18th century; today, Transylvania's mountains shelter the last remaining Carpathian bears.
The importance of hunting in Transylvania is confirmed by early historical sources, and it indicates that the Slavic regions were sparsely populated. That, in turn, makes it unlikely that the transfer of Slavic expertise in agriculture



Early Slavic Society in Transylvania
https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/63.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:30:53]
and crafts to the Hungarians occurred in Transylvania. The Hungarian vocabulary is rich in Slavic words having to do with agriculture — e.g. 'rozs' (rye), 'zab' (oats), 'repce' (rapeseed), 'széna' (hay), 'szalma' (straw), 'kasza' {1-369.} (scythe), 'kazal' (rick), 'pajta' (barn) — and with crafts — e.g. 'osztováta' (loom), 'eszterga' (lathe), 'kovács' (blacksmith) and 'gerencsér' (potter). This linguistic influence reflects the tangible transfer of Slavic techniques to the Hungarians, but Transylvania could hardly have been at the forefront of the process.
Yet it would be wrong to assume that at the time of the conquest, the Transylvanian Slavs were but residual settlers totally lacking in organization. The Bulgars' military and economic structures no doubt came under Hungarian control and were transformed, but the Slavs had their own local, social organization, and this did not disappear. A Slavic settlement, or group of settlements, was headed by a 'kenéz' (from the Slavic 'kniaz'), a common figure in the Slavic world. Numerous Hungarian toponyms, such as Kinizs, Kanizsa, Kenese, preserve the memory of this type of social organization, and Kinis even figures as a personal name in the above-mentioned Transylvanian document of 1138. In his 'woeful chronicle' of the Mongol invasion, Master Rogerius refers to Transylvanian village leaders as 'canesii', i.e. 'kenéz' (cnez) — further evidence that at the time of the onslaught, Transylvanian Slavs still preserved their traditional village communities and mother tongue.
The traces of the Transylvanian Slavs' social and economic structure reflect the conditions that prevailed in the Hungarian Monarchy. However, by this time, a large proportion of the Slavs — and particularly those living in the Szamos' watershed — had been assimilated, first by the Hungarians, then by the Romanians. The decrease in the number of Slavic toponyms is but one reflection of this process. Another likely, and more important consequence was the absorption into the Hungarian ruling class of the Slavs' élites — the leaders of a Slavic population that has been identified archaeologically as the Szilágynagyfalu-Szamosfalva group, and which — in contrast to the subjugated Slavs of southern Transylvania — enjoyed an alliance of equals with the Avars and had even adopted {1-370.} Avar costume. As will be seen later, toponyms and written sources alike attest that the Hungarian elite in 10th-century Transylvania sported not only Turkic, but also Slavic names. The obvious conclusion is that they intermarried with Slavs, and the latter were not necessarily Russians from abroad. One is reminded of Anonymus' account of the events following the death of Gelou: 'The inhabitants of the land [...] freely made peace, chose Tétény as leader [and] took an oath of allegiance to him near the place known as Esküllő' (chap. 27). This is the only place in the chronicle where indigenous people offer the hand of peace, participate in an election, and take an oath. Salan's people, the Slovenes of Nyitra, and the inhabitants of 'Roman' Pannonia were all 'subjugated' (subiugaverunt) by the Hungarians, who took hostages and put them to work building forts. There is only one episode in the chronicle that bears some similarity to this one: Ménmarót, the chieftain from Bihar, feels compelled to offer his daughter's hand, and thereby his succession, to Árpád's son (chap. 51); in their war against Ménmarót, the Hungarians are joined 'voluntarily and with peaceful intent' by the Székelys, who are considered by Anonymus to be Attila's people (chap. 50). All these events occur in Transylvania. It would be rash to assume that Anonymus had culled from 13th century legend the notion that the indigenous leaders in eastern Hungary had benefited from preferential treatment at the time of the conquest; on the other hand, it is equally unlikely that his attribution of privileged status to Ménmarót, Gelou, and the Székelys, and of subjection to Hungary's other indigenous people was purely arbitrary. Perhaps he had simply projected back the exceptional autonomy enjoyed in his day by Transylvania's Székelys and Saxons. He may well have heard something about the autonomy of Transylvania's 'Blaks', though he could hardly link this with the Romanians of the Szamos region, for the latter had not yet appeared on the scene.

Orthodox Romanians and Their Church Hierarchy
The fifty-eight parish churches and the four monasteries (Priszlop, Rév, Felek, Máramaros-Körtvélyes) that were enumerated above do not account for all medieval Romanian churches in Transylvania and the rest of Eastern Hungary. Nor can the size of the Romanian population be estimated on the basis of this number, {1-576.} or by comparing the number to the hundreds of Hungarian, Székely, and Saxon churches in the Middle Ages. A somewhat more realistic base for estimating the relative size of ethnic groups is offered by the (incomplete) list of Catholic priests in the papal tithe-register for 1332–37 and by the 1461 register of sheep-fiftieths. The latter identifies 189 villages in Transylvania's counties (excluding Hunyad county, the Saxon and Székely lands, and the Fogaras area) as being subject to the sheep tax, seven of which included unspecified 'dependencies'. There are two problems with this list. First, it hints at the existence of villages whose tax was assigned by the king to the landowner, but does not name them; a few documents survive, confirming such royal grants from the 13th century onwards, but many more must have been lost. Moreover, the larger estates are listed without detail as to their constituent villages, and thus the 'dependencies' must be tracked down in other sources. Second, the reference to two landlords' refusal to pay fiftieths 'due to the absence of Romanians in the current year' (hoc anno caret Valachys)[28] indicates that some of the Romanian shepherds tended to migrate; among the villages subject to the sheep tax — most of which had some Hungarian inhabitants as well — there must have been some that did not have permanently settled Romanians, and thus lacked a Romanian church. The register names only Catholic parish priests, for the latter received a share of the taxes paid by Romanian shepherds; in one-third of the villages subject to the sheep tax, there were sixty-four such priests.
Given the evidence in other parts of Hungary, that only one in three or four Catholic villages had its own church, Transylvania must have had at least three times as many Hungarian settlements as Hungarian and Székely churches. The Romanians' mountain villages were demonstrably smaller, which would suggest that not more than one in four had a church. In 1389, the twenty-four Romanian villages on the Egerszeg estate, in the Temes region, accounted for all of 319 families, an average of thirteen families per {1-577.} village; in fact only four of the villages harboured over twenty, while thirteen had fewer than ten families. One day, when the above sources and the many unpublished charters are fully analyzed, a somewhat clearer picture may emerge of the ethnic composition of Transylvania's 2500 villages in the late Middle Ages. For now, on the basis of these registers and the number of surviving or recorded churches, it can be estimated that at the end of the Middle Ages, Transylvania (excluding the Partium) accounted for some 500,000 out of Hungary's total population of four million. Of Transylvania's population, Hungarians and Székelys may have accounted for over a half, and Romanians for over a quarter; Saxons, Russians, Serbs and other ethnic groups made up the remainder. These figures also reveal the distribution of population by religion.
Apart from a few hundred, ennobled cnezial families that converted to Catholicism, the estimated 150,000 Romanians in Transylvania belonged to the Greek Orthodox Church. The references to archdeacons confirm that this Church was possessed of a hierarchy, but the structure can only be guessed at from the fragmentary data. The first question is which Orthodox bishopric was responsible for ordination. The building of churches and appointment of priests was contingent on the approval of free or noble cnezes, or of the landowners, but in theory, and probably also in practice, the church had to be consecrated, and the priest ordained by an Orthodox bishop. In the 11th century, the bishop responsible for all Vlach-Romanians in the Byzantine empire, i.e. up to the Carpathian frontier, was subordinated to the Bulgar Archbishop of Ohrid. As late as the 16th century, the latter would try to extend his authority to areas north of the Danube. However, after the formation in 1185 of a Bulgaro-Vlach czardom, the Tirnovo patriarchate overrode the claims of both the Patriarch of Constantinople and the Archbishop of Ohrid and imposed its authority on the formerly Byzantine bishoprics of Dorostolon (today's Silistra), Branichevo, and Vidin. (The first of these had been under the metropolitan of the {1-578.} Byzantine province of Paristrion, which extended to the Danube Delta.) There is no evidence that any of these patriarchates and bishoprics succeeded in imposing its authority north of the Danube.



Orthodox Romanians and Their Church Hierarchy
https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/95.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:31:03]
The right to ordain priests north of the Lower Danube was probably exercised the Byzantine bishopric of Vicina (in the Danube Delta, perhaps on the site of today's Isaccea), which came under the authority of the Patriarchate of Constantinople. This is all the more likely because, around 1250, it took over the status of Dorostolon to become an archbishopric, thus earning the right to found bishoprics or, at least, to send out itinerant bishops. The Pope may have been referring to the latter when, in 1234, he denounced the 'false bishops' who ordained priests among the 'Walaci' (Romanians) of Cumania, priests who would then administer the sacraments according to Greek (and not Slavic or Bulgar) rite. The hypothesis is also supported by the fact that in 1359, when Wallachia was seceding from the Kingdom of Hungary, the Patriarch of Constantinople designated Jachintos of Vicina as its first metropolitan; the latter soon set up residence at the court of Wallachia's voivode. However, Romanian priests did not adopt Greek, but continued to conduct services in Church Bulgarian — a legacy of their subordination to Ohrid — right up until modern times. They were not subordinated to the Bulgar patriarch of Tirnovo, but, at the end of the 14th century, Antim, the third metropolitan of Wallachia, was still corresponding with the latter even though he himself attended the synods at Constantinople. To add to the confusion, there was also at this time a Greek Orthodox metropolitan in Severin Province (part of which, Oltenia, or Little Wallachia, reverted to the Hungarian king between 1372 and 1382, until the death of Louis the Great); this post was held by Antim, and ceased to exist when, in 1382, the latter was named metropolitan of all Wallachia. In 1401, Antim styled himself 'Metropolitan of Ungrovlachia and exarch of Hungary and the borderlands'. He was able to impose his claim only in Transylvania, for, in 1391, the {1-579.} Patriarch of Constantinople had assigned the exarchical right to ordain priests in other parts of Hungary to the Igumen (abbot) of the recently-founded monastery of Körtvélyes (Peri), in the Máramaros. Meanwhile, the Bulgar Nicodim, founder of the first monasteries in Wallachia, established one in Hunyad county, at Priszlop; it is not likely that the abbot was entitled to ordain priests, for Wallachia's metropolitan reserved this right to himself and his bishops.
To conclude, up to the end of the 15th century, Transylvania's Greek Orthodox hierarchy (apart from one monastery) consisted of the archdeacons who supervised Romanian priests in the royal castle districts, including the ones mentioned in Hátszeg and Vajdahunyad. It is not known whether the Romanian priests on nobiliary estates in the counties were answerable to an archdeacon, or what might have been the scope of the latter's authority. The situation changed significantly in 1485, when Moldavia's voivode, Ştefan cel Mare was granted the fiefs of Csicsóvár and Küküllővár. He proceeded to found monasteries at Rév (Vad), near Csicsóvár (with a church in Moldavian-Byzantine style) and at Felek, near Kolozsvár (with a church that, judging from its Gothic style, was built by craftsmen from Kolozsvár). The two monasteries had the episcopal power of ordination under the authority of the Metropolitan of Suceava, in Moldavia. Although they exercised this right primarily in the voivode's fiefs, they were free to ordain all comers, and thus qualified the hitherto exclusive right of the Metropolitan of Wallachia to ordain Greek Orthodox priests in Transylvania. The double monastic episcopacy was transformed into the Transylvanian-Romanian Metropoly in the modern age and transferred to Gyulafehérvár. The metropolitans of Wallachia and Moldavia, though often in conflict with each other, continued to serve as the ecclesiastical superiors of Transylvania's Romanian clergy until, in modern times, the two monastic episcopacies gave rise to a new metropolitan seat for Transylvania at Gyulafehérvár.

The Disintegration of the Székely Community 2. ECONOMY, SOCIETY, AND CULTURE OF THE
NEW STATE Society and Political Power
The Ruling Class
Hungary's ruling elite — aristocrats and the lesser nobles — were profoundly affected by the changes that came about in the course of the 16th century. These included the domestic and foreign wars that led to the country's partition, the loss of Hungarian sovereignty, the creation of a new country under powerful external constraints, and economic changes on the international and local level.
The assurance of their very survival demanded unprecedented effort and energy. The defence of their castles, manors, and feudal estates required more manpower and more costly weaponry. After a time-lag, the intellectual Renaissance was followed by related changes in taste and material lifestyle. This has already been noted in the case of the urban middle class, but, from the mid-16th century, an even stronger wave of transformation and expansion swept through the world of Transylvania's fortresses, castles, and manor-houses.
{1-717.} The precursor of these new constructions was the fortress raised in the 1530s, at Szamosújvár, on the orders of King John and György Fráter. The latter was also responsible for the erection in the 1540s of the ill-fated Alvinc castle. In 1543, Farkas Bethlen had a 'palace' constructed for himself at Bonyha. Around 1555, Ferenc Kendi started to modernize his castle, which stood on a splendid site at Marosvécs, as did Gergely Apafi with his at Ebesfalva. Captain Gábor Kornis undertook a major remodelling of the castle at Huszt around 1577, and Captain Ferenc Geszty did likewise a few years later at the famous Déva castle. Also modernized were the Bethlen castle at Keresd and Benedek Keresztúri's manor at Szentbenedek.
Having become the residence of princes and kings, the onetime episcopal palace at Gyulafehérvár was repeatedly expanded and remodelled. The modernization, major and minor, of fortifications was ceaselessly pursued. Italian architects drew up the plans for extensive works at Várad and Szatmár (in the 1570s) and at Fogaras (in the 1580s).
Such activities testified to the growing prosperity of the ruling class. Although this part of Hungarian society had become somewhat separated from Europe, its traditional affinities and the lure of the best that the age had to offer impelled it to follow the cultural lead of Western Europe. With the Renaissance, Western Europe acquired cultural superiority not only over Eastern Europe, always a laggard in this respect, but also over the Islamic world, which earlier had shown great cultural dynamism.
The question arises, how could the Transylvanian elite afford such costly modernization at a time when their historically poor region was suffering from commercial isolation, inflation, a shortage of money, and the mounting cost of defence? To be sure, the Renaissance had spread to other parts of Eastern Europe, but all of them enjoyed economic advantages over Transylvania. In Poland, the nobility disposed of profits from the large-scale production of {1-718.} wheat, which it had taken under its control. Rising agricultural prices had an impact in Habsburg Hungary as well; production and socage deliveries increased, and money was not as scarce as in Transylvania. The socage deliveries of wheat and livestock helped landowners to maintain domestics, estate managers, and personal guards, particularly since these dependents were still largely paid in kind, with produce and cloth. Even great estates that hitherto barely broke even began to generate profits thanks to the market towns, which paid most of their feudal dues in cash. (Their annual income was nearing the 10,000-forint mark, but historians are still debating whether much of this was generated by the marketing of agricultural products, i.e. by the Polish type of large-scale production.)
Transylvania did not have the capacity to follow these models. The Polish agricultural model remained impracticable in a region so remote from western markets. A few noblemen tried their hand at trading wine and cattle, the most marketable products, but Transylvania's economy was too small to make this profitable. Thus the nobles' only hope of accumulating wealth lay with their estates, and it was no easy task to make the latter generate greater profits.
In Western Europe, landowners resorted to leasing a good part of their lands to enterprising peasants, an innovation



The Ruling Class
https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/114.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:31:14]
that marked the beginning of the end of feudalism. Their counterparts in Transylvania did not have this option: the region was sparsely populated, there was no shortage of arable land, and thus few peasants sought to lease land. Most villeins aspired, instead, to acquire freehold plots, which would offer them and their progeny more security than leased plots. The labour shortage drove up wages, reducing the demand for tenancy and making it uneconomical to have tenants. Some landowners tried a different tack: instead of leasing out their property in small parcels, they hired wage-labourers to cultivate the land. But they, too, were soon discouraged by the high wage rates. Around 1570, a hired hand in Szatmár had to be paid {1-719.} 8–12 forints, and some as much as 27 forints a year. The prevalence of primitive farming techniques also impeded the achievement of a mutually profitable level of productivity.
The only way to increase the profitability of an estate was to restrict the villeins' right to land, and the circumstances of the time favoured this option. The peasantry's most dynamic stratum, the peasant-citizens, had been decimated. The ongoing wars required the ruling class to maintain considerable military forces, and these could be used to impose the landowners' will on the villeins. Nor could the latter count on the protection of the law. As early as 1514, the landowner's overriding right to his lands had been included in István Werbőczy's compilation of laws, the Tripartitum. At the time, this 'law' was no more than a bold new demand from the nobility, and, in any case, the compilation was not sanctioned by the king. Over time, that 'minor flaw' was lost sight of: by the second half of the 16th century, with the evolution of common law, the Tripartitum had become a fundamental part of the legal order, legitimating the repossession of villeins' lands.
Thus the legal precondition was in place both in Habsburg Hungary and in Transylvania for the creation of manorial estates. When the attempts to lease the repossessed lands, or to have them worked by wage-labourers proved uneconomical, Transylvanian society underwent a major transformation: more and more landowners imposed corvée, i.e. the provision by villeins of unpaid services.
The pattern in Transylvania was similar to that in Hungary. The landowners first priority was to make their estates self-sufficient. For better or for worse, the estates could supply whatever was necessary to sustain agricultural production and satisfy the needs of the villein households. The products of craftsmen in the domanial villages carpenters, wheelwrights, smiths, tailors, and tanners — may have been primitive and of inferior quality, but they were cheap, or, indeed, freely provided as feudal dues. The estates could {1-720.} also satisfy the basic requirements of the landowner's household for foodstuffs and clothes.
The shortage of cash and the attempts at self-sufficiency gave grain an uncommon economic function. Transylvania had never produced an abundance of wheat, and, in the second half of the 16th century, this grain became a virtual currency. Landowners amassed and stored as much wheat as possible. Only rarely, when prices were particularly high, did they sell any of it on the market; instead, they used it to pay their domestics, estate managers, soldiers, craftsmen, and labourers, and to buy wine for their taverns. Next in importance came oats, little of which (and of barley) was sold on the market.
Apart from developing their manorial farms, landowners tried to extract maximum value from the villeins' contributions in kind, especially with regard to tithes for tenancy. There was a rapid increase in the number of domanial mills and taverns (traditionally, the sale of wine was an exclusive privilege of the nobility); the revenue from these activities came mostly in the form of cash, which the landowners were hard put to obtain elsewhere.
Transylvania's ruling classes also adapted the management system of their estates to the new circumstances. Previously, according to feudal custom, the estates had been administered by 'familiars', who came from the lesser nobility or the 'low orders'. These officials were rewarded with small gratuities, privileges, the provisional assignment of villages and certain feudal dues, and their own farm on the estate. In the emerging system, the landowner's staff — including the castellan, the various stewards, the gardener, and the pantryman — became, in effect, salaried employees paid in cash or kind; there was no longer a mutual moral obligation binding master and servants. The landowner's staff expanded, as did the costs, but outcome was greater profitability, for most of the additional employees worked on the management of the estate or as soldiers; on the other hand, the number of those who served less {1-721.} essential needs, such as lackeys, domestics, cooks, and hunters, decreased.
It was not these changes that distinguished Transylvania from Habsburg Hungary but, rather, the smaller scale of production and the shortage of money. There were very few truly large domains in Transylvania proper, and most



The Ruling Class
https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/114.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:31:14]
of these, like Fogaras and Gyulafehérvár, belonged to the exchequer. The average domain would have counted in Habsburg Hungary as no more than a medium-sized estate, and the manorial estates on these domains were also smaller. As a consequence, the utilization of corvée was also different in Transylvania, with more of it assigned to cartage and construction work.
That last feature accounts for the ability of Transylvania's nobles to emulate the architectural innovations of the Renaissance. A comparison of representative building projects in the two parts of Hungary is revealing. In Habsburg Hungary, the major builders were aristocratic families well-endowed with land and money. Thus Vöröskő was modernized by the Fugger family, Sárvár by the Nádasdy family, and Sárospatak by the Perényi family. Even some of the larger fortresses in the frontier zone, such as Pál Várday's Érsekújvár, were purely private undertakings.
By contrast, in Transylvania, much of the construction activity (e.g. at Szamosújvár, Várad, Fogaras, and Kővár) was initiated by the princely authority. And of the aristocrats' castles, even the finest and most famous paled beside those of Habsburg Hungary.
The distinctive pattern in which estates evolved in Transylvania had a more important, social-political significance. In counties of the Partium where development was similar to the Hungarian pattern, there remained vast domains that included market towns. One of the most prosperous, the Szatmár domain (which belonged to the Szapolyai realm until the 1560s) generated in 1569–70 cash revenues of around 18,000 forints as well as revenues in kind worth an additional 15,000 forints. In Transylvania, {1-722.} on the other hand, the relatively productive Kolozsmonostor domain generated only 1800 forints a year around 1580.
Thus the aristocratic families whose castles and domains lay in the Partium became far wealthier than their counterparts in Transylvania proper, a disparity that would weigh heavily in the social system of the new principality.

The Population: Dacians and Settlers 3. THE ROMAN PROVINCE OF DACIA
(Endre Tóth) The Fate of the Population after the Withdrawal
Collapse and Withdrawal
The decade of the 220s were the last peaceful period in Dacia's history. In 231, when Emperor Alexander Severus's headed off with units of the Illyrian army for an ultimately unsuccessful Persian campaign, the Goths' southeasterly migration came to a stop. Earlier, the Goths had wrought havoc among the peoples who lived on the perimeter of the Roman empire in the Carpathian Basin. Now, they settled down in southern Ukraine and along the shores of the Black Sea. A short period of peace followed as the Goths gathered their strength. Beginning in the mid-230s, they renewed their attacks, and over several decades they caused unprecedented destruction on the Balkan peninsula and in Dacia. Together with their allies, the Goths confronted the empire and, {1-117.} with land and sea forces, besieged the provinces in the Balkans and Asia Minor. Concurrently, in the Near East, the Persian wars went on with occasional pauses; gaining ground as they gained strength, the Persian armies even managed to capture Emperor Valerian (258–260). In the Rhineland, too, the Romans faced a critical situation due to attacks by the Alemanni, Jutes, and Franks. The empire was ill-prepared to defend its borders from multiple, widely dispersed attacks. Constant warfare ultimately led to domestic anarchy.
The war must have reached Dacia during the reign of Emperor Maximinus (235–238), for the latter assumed the title of Dacicus Maximus in 236 to celebrate a victory. The attacks came mainly from free Dacians and Carpi, who were being pushed westwards by the Goths. Fighting continued under Gordianus III (238–244), when the Carpi attacked the Limes Transalutanus. The relentless progress of the war is indicated by the many treasures buried during these two emperor's reigns, never to be retrieved by their owners. In gratitude for Gordianus' defensive efforts, Dacia's provincial council raised an epigraph honouring the Emperor.[58] In 245–247, the Limes Transalutanus gave way under the fierce attacks of the Carpi. Pannonian troops were marshalled to Dacia to withhold the Carpi, and Emperor Philippus travelled to the battlefront; in 247, he took the title of Carpicus Maximus. Despite momentary successes, the Romans had to abandon the Limes Transalutanus. There is no archaeological evidence to indicate the date, but it must have happened by 248, when, judging from stone fortifications built around Romula by legion detachments from Moesia Superior and Germania Romula, the Olt limes had become the front line.[59]
In 246–47, after the mints in Moesia were closed, a new mint was established at Viminacium to facilitate the payment of soldiers in the lower Danubian region. This mint helped to supply Dacia's needs for some eleven years, and the province was also granted the right to strike coins.
{1-118.} There was no letup in the fighting. An epigraph in Apulum hails Traianus Decius (249–251) as restitutor Daciarum, the 'restorer of Dacia', and a bronze statue of the Emperor was erected at Sarmizegethusa. In 250, he, too, assumed the title of Dacicus Maximus, presumably because of his military successes. After occupying a southeastern strip of the province along the Limes Transalutanus, the enemy made further gains during — or shortly after — the reign of Philippus. Already greatly reduced, the circulation of coins appears to have ceased in the camps of eastern Transylvania by the middle of the 3rd century, probably indicating that the camps had been abandoned. The Tabula Peutingeriana, a map drawn in the same period, shows neither the Limes Transalutanus nor the Roman roads of eastern Transylvania, and thus also points to the evacuation of the northeastern territories. As the Carpi advance advanced, Dacia's inhabitants began to seek refuge south of the Danube, in Moesia; during Philippus' reign, one of the no doubt many who fled Dacia was the mother of Galerius, who later became emperor.[60]
Sources say little about the attacks on Dacia, for that much-tried province had already lost much of its military significance, and the crucial battles were being fought to the south, in the Balkans. A wealth of concealed treasure shows the Gothic offensive against Moesia Inferior and Thrace, where they attacked relentlessly from the 230s onwards. In or around 235, the Goths and Carpi occupied Histria and sacked the Danube delta's prosperous commercial centres, which had also served as important economic links for Moesia and Dacia. Moesia came under attack in 238, and in 244 the enemy laid siege to the town of Marcianapolis, in Moesia Inferior; that battle was won

https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/19.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:31:24]
by Decius, whose soldiers thereupon proclaimed him Emperor. Moesia was attacked again in 248, and, the following year, two towns on the right bank of the lower Danube, Iatrus and Novae (Svishtov), were sacked; the roads leading to Dacia now came under threat. Decius was unable to hold {1-119.} back the relentless pressure of the Goths, who defeated him at Abrittus (near the site of his victorious battle in 251); he lost his life in the battle, as did his son and thousands of his soldiers. Two years later, the Goths laid siege to Thessaloniki, while the Romans reinforced the defences of Macedonia's towns, of the pass at Thermopylae, and of Athens. The attacks by land and sea went on unceasingly for fifteen years.
Dacia itself is hardly mentioned; Emperor Gallienus took the title Dacicus Maximus in 257, presumably for resisting the Carpi. A final effort was made around this time to fortify some of the province's military camps, but it may have coincided with the beginning of military withdrawal. To enhance security, the broad portals of the camps at Énlaka, Barcarozsnyó, Sebesváralja, and Porolissum were partially or completely walled up. The erection of inscribed monuments in Dacia was essentially halted in 260, during Gallienus' reign.[61] The circulation of coins in western Dacia fell back; few coins of this period have been found in towns and camps, except at the military headquarters in Apulum. The shortage of coins that accompanied the crisis in the middle of the 3rd century was accentuated in 257–58 by the dismantling and removal of the regional mint at Viminacium.
The thirty-year war brought military reverses on several fronts, a catastrophic economic situation, a persistent shortage of money (partly due to the vast amount of gold expended to buy peace from the Persians), and an internal power struggle. A low point was reached towards the end of the 250s, when Rome suffered devastating setbacks at the hands of the Alemani and Franks in Germania, Rhaetia, and Gaul, and of the Sarmatians and Quads in Pannonia. Spurred by these reverses, Emperor Gallienus made a determined effort to reorganize the empire. In 260, a mobile, mounted army, formed from former legion units, helped to repulse the Alemanni, who had reached Italy's borders, and the empire's defensive line on the Rhine was consolidated.
{1-120.} To improve the defences of Italia and Illyria, Gallienus established a new military headquarters at Poetovio (Ptuj, Yugoslavia), which was situated at a key road junction. Sometime in the 260s, units of Dacia's legions (the V Macedonica and the XIII Gemina), under the command of the praepositus Flavius Aper, took up permanent quarters in Poetovio. Finds of marble epigraphs and bas-reliefs bear witness that these troops reconstructed and decorated the town's third Mithras shrine. To secure Gallienus' well-being, Flavius Aper and his officers raised altars to this sun god, who was believed to have slain the primordial bull. The altars, together with the presence of the legions' headquarters, indicate that many, or all of the two legions' units were stationed in the town. Evidently, Gallienus had withdrawn his elite troops from a Dacia encircled by Barbarians. There is no evidence that all or part of the legion V Macedonica was still stationed at its former camp in Potaissa after the end of the 250s; the coin traffic at the camp ceased at this time. In contrast, coin traffic at the camp of the other legion, the XIII Gemina, continued until Aurelianus' reign. That legion's commander remained in Dacia after 260, for he erected an altar in the southern part of the province;[62] that altar, found at Mehadia, is the last relic of Dacia's Roman defenders. As the Goths encircled and then invaded Dacia, the province lost its military importance, and Rome progressively withdrew its armies.
The reorganization of the Danubian provinces was facilitated by the fact that after their protracted offensives, the Goth armies were running out of steam. After raiding Athens, Corinth, and Sparta, they suffered a tremendous defeat in 269 at the hands of Emperor Claudius II, at Naissus (Niš, Yugoslavia). For once, the title assumed by the Emperor, Gothicus, was justified by an authentic triumph, and ever since, it has been linked to his name. The Goths' next probe, in 270, in Dobrudja, was of little consequence.
Claudius Gothicus' successor, Aurelianus, mounted a campaign against the rebellious queen of Palmyra, Zenobia, who had {1-121.} occupied Egypt, an important source of wheat for Rome. Aurelianus first cleared the rampaging Barbarians out of Illyria and Thrace, then crossed the Danube and inflicted a defeat on the Goths in their homeland; the Goths' king, Cannabaudes, fell in battle. Much to the relief of the population, the lower Danubian region could enjoy a respite from war, but the victories came too late to save Dacia. Coins minted in 270, at the beginning of Aurelianus' reign, bear the inscriptions PANNONIA and DACIA FELIX next to GENIUS ILLYRICI, testifying to Illyria's importance and to Dacia's good fortune. Although that reference may allude to the deliverance of the original Dacia founded by Trajan, it could also evoke the rescue of its population and the founding of a new Dacian province to the south of the Danube. Aurelianus, on an inspection tour of the province, had found



Collapse and Withdrawal
https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/19.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:31:24]
devastation and depopulation; concluding that the territory did not merit retention, he proceeded to have it evacuated in good order. The remaining military units were withdrawn in 271–72, and the remnants of Dacia's inhabitants were resettled in Moesia. For the sake of appearances, the Romans created a new province that bore the name Dacia and lay between Moesia Superior and Moesia Inferior; Aurelianus established a mint in its capital, Serdica (Sofia). Aurelianus also evacuated the Danube-Rhine triangle (agri decumates) and pulled back the legions in Germania and Raetia behind a more easily defensible frontier line of rivers.
The last forty years of Dacia's history confirmed what had already been evident under Hadrian's reign: the province contributed little to the defence of the empire's central and Balkan regions. Dacia had not served to prevent attacks by Jazyges and Goths on the two Moesiae and Thrace. The tens of thousands of troops stationed in Dacia were incapable of defending its long borders. By the middle of the 3rd century, the recurrent attacks, and the resulting insecurity, had induced a mounting wave of emigration. Before turning his attention to the eastern front, Aurelianus took {1-122.} steps to consolidate the situation in the lower Danubian region. He evacuated the Romans from Dacia and established a shorter and more defensible border for the empire along the Danube limes, which were once again fortified. The V Macedonica legion set up camp in Oescus, which it had left 170 years earlier, while the XIII Gemina legion returned to Ratiaria. Having shortened the front line, Aurelianus was confident that the Danubian provinces were secure, and he headed eastward, taking with him part of the Illyrian army.

Written and Archaeological Sources
An investigation of Transylvania' history in the context of the Hungarian Conquest must take into account not only archaeological and toponymic date but also the most extensive and famous written 'source': the Gesta by Anonymus. Scholarly appraisals of that work, originating in various countries, have led to diametrically opposed conclusions, and these conclusions permeate the historical consciousness of nations in the Carpathian Basin. The following is an attempt to interpret Anonymus' account in the light of archaeological evidence.
This romantic account of the Hungarian Conquest was written around 1210 by a worldly and scholarly cleric whose identity remains a mystery (P dictus magister). He was, in all respects, a man of his time, and his work evidently reflects the concerns and circumstances that marked his epoch.
The work was written three hundred years after the conquest and some ten years before the proclamation of the Aranybulla (Golden Bull, the Hungarian equivalent of the Magna Carta). P. magister was acting as spokesman of the Hungarian nobility's interests; his artful chronicle was designed to demonstrate that the clans participating in the 'original conquest' possessed rights that were as concrete and inalienable as those of the Árpád dynasty. They had earned every inch of land with their blood, and all that they possessed had been granted by Árpád.
{1-272.} The author had no information — apart from some familial and tribal legends — regarding the actual circumstances of the conquest. Thus he had to invent enemies and rivals for his heroes to vanquish. He rather casually borrowed the names of rivers (Laborc), mountains (Tarcal, and Zobor, which, derived from the Slavic 'Śobor', means 'Church' mountain!), castles (Gyalu), and villages (Glad) to conjure up knights and chieftains: the Bulgar Laborcy, the Cumanian Turzol, the Czech Zobur, the Vlach Gelou, and the Bulgar Glad of Vidin. Drawing on folk tales, he identified the principal enemies as Salán and Ménmarót.
Anonymus obviously had no knowledge of the settlers' real enemies: Svatopluk I and II, Mojmir II, the German King Arnulf, Prince Braslav of Pannonia, the Bulgar Khan Simeon, and the Bavarian Prince Liutpold. He did not know of the conquest's crucial battle, at Pozsony (Bresalauspurc); nor of the local centres of resistance (which probably included Csongrád, Mosaburg, and Belgrade). Of the settlers' actual adversaries, which included the Moravians, Slovenes, Karantans, Franks, and Bavarians, he knew only of the Bulgars. Thus he arbitrarily counted among the Hungarians' opponents the Czechs, who at the time lived exclusively in the Czech Basin; the Cumanians, who moved to Europe only in the 11th century; and the Vlachs. His choices reflect the ethnic and political realities of the 12th century. Similarly, his Hungarian heroes are ancestors — those who could be traced back to 1000 — of great landowners of the 12th century. On the other hand, his work is an invaluable guide to Hungary in his own times, revealing geographical details and the prevailing property relations.
The local 'centres' of resistance noted by Anonymus were the products not only of his fertile imagination but also of contemporary folklore. In his version, the modest Bulgar earthworks on the Tisza known as the 'Black Castle' (Chernigrad/Csongrád) were raised by the victorious chieftain Ete; he attributes the forts at Titel {1-273.} and Alpár to the Bulgar Salán, and the one at Bihar to the 'Bulgar-hearted' Ménmarót (the Moravian ruler Morout), when in fact all three earthworks dated from the Bronze Age.
The case of Alpár is particularly instructive, for it gives an accurate indication of Anonymus' 'method'. According to the Gesta, Árpád fought his decisive battle against Salán the Bulgar in the 'sands of Alpár'; by the time Salán's fleeing soldiers perish in the waters of the Tisza at 'Görögrév' ('Greek Crossing'), near Alpár, they had conveniently turned into Greeks. In fact, the portus Grecorum got its name in the 12th century, from the Basilite monks who controlled the river crossing. In 1974–77, excavations on a hill that rises above the Tisza's flood plain revealed the traces of 'castrum Olpar', an earthwork, with high ramparts, that had been constructed in the Bronze Age. There was not even a fragment of pottery to indicate that the fortification might have been occupied and used for military purposes in the 9th–11th centuries. Only around 1100 did a local potentate appropriate the site and rebuild it into a

castle, with a raised interior court and strong log walls on the raised ramparts. Thus, in Anonymus' time, an authentic, well-maintained castrum stood above the remains of the Bronze Age earthworks; and, according to local legend, this fort had been built before the conquest by the Hungarians' enemies, the Bulgars. In popular imagination, many great earthworks dating from the Bronze Age and Iron Age — notably at Bihar, Zemplén, and Titel — had been the nests of enemies who confronted the Hungarian settlers. Such popular fantasies have as little historical significance as the supposedly evocative names given to sites after the end of Turkish occupation (Töröksánc, Tatársánc, Törökdomb, Töröktorony), which were actually earthworks dating from prehistoric or Árpádian times, ancient kurgans, and the ruins of Árpádian church steeples. (In Germany, too, there are numerous prehistoric earthworks and burial mounds that bear the misnomers Schwedenschanz and Schwedenhügel.) It is hard to escape the conclusion, therefore, {1-274.} that Anonymus had drawn on such folklore in order to concoct a heroic tale about Alpár.
So far, histories of Transylvania in the age of the Hungarian Conquest have been dominated by Anonymus' legacy, and this regardless of the author's national origin. Thus settler-conquerors arrived through the 'Verecke' and, proceeding from the Tisza valley along the Szamos and Maros rivers, 'attempted' to penetrate into Transylvania. From the very beginning, they are confronted by their great enemy, Menumorout, the 'Bulgar-hearted' Khazar leader, lord of the castles at Szatmár and Bihar. When the Hungarians fail to overcome his resistance, they form an alliance with him. (Menumorout was a folkloric character who allegedly had many lovers (amica) but sired neither a daughter nor a male heir, hence his name, which is Old Hungarian for 'Moravian stallion'.) Then there was Gelou, 'some Vlach (quidam Blacus) chief', who, from his fortress on the Szamos, rallied 'the inhabitants of that land' to resist the invaders. Cumanians, Bulgars, and Vlachs, led by Glad of Vidin, fought a series of losing battles all the way from the Maros to Orsova against Kadocsa's forces. The Hungarians waged a real war of conquest, but there is no evidence of the encounters related by Anonymus.
None of these romantic characters and skirmishes are mentioned in foreign sources dating from the 10th century, nor, for that matter, in the 11th century Hungarian chronicle, the Old Gesta (Gesta Ungarorum), which does contain some more plausible information. Moreover, the findings of archaeology contradict Anonymus.
The assessment of archaeological sites and finds has evolved and changed in pace with the 150-year long development of the science of archaeology. This is particularly the case with regard to the early Middle Ages the period of the Great Migrations and the Hungarian Conquest.
{1-275.} When the sites and finds were still few in number, scholars tried to find some logical link between them. At first, graves that were isolated (or, in most cases, that only seemed isolated, for the sites were not properly searched) and contained weapons were summarily judged to be the burial places of heroes killed in some 'battle'. This predisposition remains a popular one, and it is not absent from some quasi-romantic evaluations of sites (e.g. the 'archaeological' assessment of a conquering chieftain's grave at Zemplén). As more and more isolated graves and small cemeteries were discovered, analysts would try to trace the 'invasion' route and the movements of armies; in other instances, they would conclude that the occupant of the grave had died 'defending' certain river crossings, mountain passes, and gorges. Later, when the perspective of economic history became dominant, analysts would trace trade routes on the basis of finds of similar material goods. More recently, graves holding weapons have been evaluated in terms of the progressive establishment of a Hungarian state — or, in the case of Transylvania, in terms of the 'expansion' of that state — and of the conflicts between the dominant power and local centres of resistance.
All the above are, at best, working hypotheses. The only certainty is that the graves and burial grounds indicate dwelling-places, settlements, or villages. Cemeteries of the 10th–11th century are the 'indicators' not of warfare, trade, or military policy, but rather — like other cemeteries in the world at large — of the act and pattern of settlement.
At the river Brenta, and then at Pozsony, the victorious Hungarians swept up the weapons of their fallen enemies — thousands of fine swords, with double-edged blades of damask steel, and spears with long, tempered heads; by 907, they had amassed sufficient 'western' weapons to equip an entire army. It is therefore an archaeological absurdity to claim that swords (and often horses as well) found in 10th-century graves around the Carpathian Basin {1-276.} must have belonged to 'local' warriors, on the grounds that the Hungarians 'invariably carried sabres'. The pattern of sword-finds cannot be readily identified with 'Viking' or 'Carolingian' trade routes. Nor can the swords

be considered as exclusive archaeological indicators of the state structure under kings Géza or Stephen.
For a century, Hungarian archaeologists propounded a theory that was inspired by the dominant nobility: that only a free warrior who had been buried with his horse could be regarded as one of the Hungarian conquerors, and that other graves must have belonged to their servants or their new subjects. According to this essentially distorted view of history, the authentic settlers consisted of a few thousand noble warriors, and thus the archaeological legacy of the Conquest was limited to the graves of some 150–200 knights, with swords, sabres, and horses. Seldom has nationalistic bias done more damage to the interests of a nation.
The subsequent reassessment of historical, linguistic, and archaeological data reveals that under the rule of a small elite and of a 'middle' stratum, ordinary Hungarians established hundreds of villages and cemeteries. Despite this, the old biases endure. Even today, the only sites and finds in Transylvania commonly identified with the Hungarian Conquest are those that enjoyed this status in 1896, when the Conquest's millennium was celebrated.
The facts are these: The popular culture of Hungarians who lived in Transylvania in the 10th–12th centuries has no organic antecedents in that region in the 8th–9th centuries; the same is the case with the Tisza region. (There are, on the other hand, earlier traces in foreign lands.) The archaeological evidence, though faint, is indisputable; it points to a new population, a new pattern of settlement, and a new culture. If the evidence is sparse, it is because the last excavations and published, scholarly appraisals of Transylvanian cemeteries that held Hungarian settlers of the middle and lower social strata date back to 1912. Official reports on the one more recent find, cemetery 'B' at Maroskarna, insist that it did not belong to Hungarian settlers.

Anonymus on the Hungarian Conquest of Transylvania
1. TRANSYLVANIA'S INDIGENOUS POPULATION AT THE TIME OF THE HUNGARIAN CONQUEST
Toponymy and Chronology
{1-344.} Place-names and Ethnicity
Anonymus's chronicle thus offers no reliable information regarding the people encountered in Transylvania by the Hungarians who (as is proven by archaeological evidence) belonged to the first generation of conquerors. The presence of Slavs is confirmed by modern archaeology, but no distinctive trace of Romanians had been found in the region. The presence of Bulgars, who had taken possession of Transylvanian salt mines, is attested by the source, dating from 892, that was noted earlier, as well as by archaeological finds. Partly because of the scarcity of early documentary sources, nothing more can be said about the ethnic situation in Transylvania prior to the Hungarian Conquest.
Of the known Hungarian documents drafted before 1200, only twenty-seven bear some reference to Transylvania; two date from the 11th, the rest from the 12th century. Of the latter, sixteen reveal only the name of some Transylvanian, religious or lay dignitary, such as a bishop, a dean, a voivode, or a count. In the 13th century, and particularly after 1250, the number of documents touching on Transylvania grows rapidly and reaches over four hundred. Even this is only a small fraction of the documents dealing with other parts of Hungary. As will be discussed later, Transylvania was hit particularly hard by the invasion of Mongols in 1241–42, but the major reason for the paucity of documents lies elsewhere. Transylvania was a frontier zone, and autonomous freemen made up a larger proportion of its population than that of the rest of the Hungarian Kingdom; feudal property relations were implanted rather later and less evenly than in other regions, and thus the attendant documentary records of ownership were also scarcer.
The paucity and often contradictory nature of documentary and archaeological sources compels the historian to draw complementary information from toponymy. Fortunately, the names of places and waterways reveal much that is relevant to the period of the Hungarian Conquest.
{1-345.} Although the historical study of place-names is not practised to the same extent in all countries, it is a recognized branch of historiography. It encompasses the etymology of geographical names as well as cultural and chronological variations in the naming of places. To facilitate their study of Hungarian place-names, István Kniezsa and Géza Bárczi developed an analytical framework that blends etymology, typology, and chronology. The validity of this triple approach has been amply demonstrated, thanks not only to the expertise of the two scholars but also to the peculiarity of Hungarian toponymy, which is readily distinguishable from that of any other culture. Most of the early Hungarian toponyms are derived from the names of people, clans, and ethnic groups, or from occupations, and used in the nominative case singular (e.g. Árpád, Megyer, Cseh [Czech], Ács [carpenter]). This type of toponymy appears in the earliest documents, dating from around 1000 AD. The pattern holds well into the 13th century — until the 1220s in western Hungary, and the 1270s in the eastern parts, including Transylvania — when it gives way to compound toponyms, most commonly the combination of a proper name and 'falva', meaning village (e.g. Péterfalva = Peter's village). The earliest compounds, first appearing in the 12th century, are formed with the endings 'laka', 'soka', 'népe', 'telke' (the possessive case of 'home', 'many', 'people', and 'plot'). The endings 'háza' and 'falva' (possessive case of 'house' and 'village'), which appear after 1200, eventually supplant the nominative type as well as two early variants, endings '-i' and '-d' (e.g. Petri, Peterd), which enjoyed a brief popularity from around 1100 to 1250. The pattern evolved at different rates, depending on the region, but after 1270, new place-names came in only two forms: compound toponyms, and toponyms that reflected the natural environment (e.g. Nádas, meaning reeds). Among compound toponyms, the one ending in 'telke' (possessive case of 'plot') is particularly noteworthy. 'Telek' originally signified a place suitable for animal husbandry, and this {1346.} meaning survived for a long time in Transylvania, but from the 14th century onwards the word came to denote an abandoned village on the plains; in some cases, the site retained the name even after it was repopulated.
Of the peoples who cohabited with the Hungarians, the Cumanians and Pechenegs had similar toponymic customs, but the Germans, Slavs, and Romanians followed fundamentally different customs. None of the latter used proper

names in the nominative singular; apart from the Slavic 'grad', endings that indicated the type of settlement occurred only in German (e.g. Kronstadt, Grabendorf, Leschkirch). Slavic and Romanian toponyms are typologically related but, as a rule, can be readily distinguished from each other. Some types of endings are common to Slavic and Romanian place-names: those that evoke ancestry or place of origin (e.g. the Slavic 'inci', 'jane', the Romanian 'eşti', 'eni'); diminutive suffixes (the Slavic 'ica', 'ka'; the Romanian 'ut', 'el', 'şor'); and those indicating the location or abundance of something (e.g. the Slavic 'ište', 'vec', the Romanian 'et', 'iş'). The main difference is that possessive endings, common in Slavic place names (e.g. 'ov', 'ovci', 'in', 'ici'), were not adopted in Romanian (the Romanian place-names ending in 'ăuţi', 'ov', and 'inţi' were originally Slavic). On the other hand, Romanians have made use of the Slavic diminutive suffix 'iţa' and location-indicator 'işte'.
A distinctive feature of Romanian toponyms is the incidence a nominative case without suffix, which originally was employed only with the masculine or feminine definite article, sometimes in the singular, but mostly in the plural (e.g. 'ul', 'ii', 'a', 'ele', 'oaia', 'oaiele'). This form was applied equally to the proper names, ethnic designations, and the names of plants, animals, waterways, and minerals, and the suffix did not have to accord with the gender of the basic noun (e.g. Fărcaşul — Fărcăşa — Fărcăşele, Ursul — Ursa — Ursoaia, Grecul — Greaca — Greci, Armaşul — Armăşoaia, Alunul — Aluna — Alunele, Bourul — Boura, Stînca — Stîncul, and one that {1-347.} has almost all possible variants, Găvanul, Găvani, Găvana, Găvănele, Găvăneşti). There are a few exceptions, found in Moldavia and Oltenia, where personal names have been applied to places in their nominative singular form, both with and without a definite article (e.g. Ghidion, Ghidionul). In this connection, Iorgu Iordan, the author of the classic work on Romanian toponyms observes: 'Place-names that I regard as having been formed from personal names in the original manner [...] could only have a plural form, ending either in 'i' or, more commonly, in 'eşti' (and later 'eni').'[3] In his opinion, toponyms in the plural form or in the nominative without suffix were of more recent vintage and attributable mostly to foreign influence.
Unfortunately, the chronology of different types of Romanian toponyms has yet to be worked out. Part of the problem is that Romanian place-names from north of the Danube appear only rarely in pre-1300 documents. Nevertheless, some indications of chronology can be found in Serb royal documents dating from 1198–1450, in which many Romanian settlements are noted, as well as in Balkan regions that are now inhabited by Serbs and Bulgars, but where — despite the disappearance of the Romanians — some Romanian toponyms dating from this period have survived. First, it can be observed that the Romanians who lived in Serbia and Bulgaria spoke the same dialect as today's Romanians north of the Danube, and they used the same types of toponym. There occur, both in Serbia and in Bulgaria, toponyms based on personal names and natural features, and bearing the definite article (e.g. Piscul, Ursul, Cîrnul, Creţul, Corbul, Surdul); place-names formed with the diminutive suffixes 'şor' and 'el' (e.g. Cernişor, Negrişor, Banişor, Stănişor, Nişor, Văcărel, Păsărel, Cercel — north of the Danube, such names generally have the suffix 'ul' as well); and names with the suffix 'et' (e.g. Rugulet, Cornet). The striking difference, however, is that while the suffixes 'eşti' and 'eni' became prevalent north of the Danube after the mid1300s, they are absent {1-348.} from Romanian toponyms, dating from the Middle Ages, in the Balkans. On the other hand, of the forms still prevalent in the Balkans, the masculine singular with definite article ('ul') is found only in Wallachia and Moldavia. In the case of Romanian toponyms that can be traced back to the 14th century in Transylvania, it is the feminine form that first became prevalent (the earliest documented instances, dating from 1360, are Tuştea and Peşteana, in the Hátszeg region). The masculine form was reduced to the suffix 'u' or disappeared, but the 'u' was often added to adaptations of Hungarian toponyms (e.g. Törpény > Tărpiu), and the same was done with the feminine form (e.g. Tóti > Toltia). In contrast, the suffixes 'şor', 'el' and 'et' were generally used throughout the Romanian language areas, in the Balkans as well as farther north; in Transylvania, these are among the earliest toponyms found mentioned in documents — e.g. Nucşoara (1359); Rîuşor (1377), a river in the Hátszeg region; Săscior (1464) in Alsó-Fehér county; Rîuşor (1473), Copăcel (1473), and Ludişor (1476) in the Fogarasföld; Ostrovel (1439) and Frăsinet (1482) in the Hátszeg. One of the rarer diminutive suffixes in toponyms, 'şa', was the first to occur in Transylvania, in Lupşa (1366).
Although toponyms in the Romanian-language area are fundamentally similar, it is possible to distinguish three zones. In the Balkans, the masculine and feminine singular nominative forms prevail, while the suffixes 'eni' and 'esti' are absent. In Wallachia and Moldavia, both patterns are present. In Transylvania, the dominant suffixes are 'eşti' and 'eni'. The earliest documented examples are Toteşti (1438), Luteşti (1439), Gureni (1415), and Petreni (1425) in the Hátszeg region, Mărgineni (1437) in the Fogarasföld, and Chiuleşti (1467) in Belső-Szolnok county; the masculine forms became less, and the feminine more frequent. Since Romanians largely disappeared from

Serbia and Bulgaria in the 15th century, their toponyms must have dated from earlier times; however, it is hardly conceivable that the Romanians of Wallachia and Moldavia {1-349.} disseminated one toponymic pattern (the suffixes 'eşti' and 'eni') in the north, and another (the singular form with the definite article) in the south. It is more likely that the basic form, the nominative with the article, was initially shared by all three zones, then gradually fell into disuse or, in the north, was limited to the feminine variant; and meanwhile the new forms, 'eşti' and 'eni' made their appearance. A similar evolutionary pattern can be detected in the case of Hungarian toponyms: the nominative form, without suffix, was an early and — according to some scholars — 'nomadic' phenomenon, for it identified a person rather than a site, much like the Romanian nominative with article; the subsequent, compound forms (with endings like 'falva') indicate the consolidation of settlement, which in Romanian is indicated by the suffixes 'eşti' (e.g. Bucureşti [Bucharest] = 'people of Bucur') and 'eni' (e.g. Văleni = 'people of the valley'). At any rate, the suffixes 'eşti' and 'eni' show up relatively late in the history of Romanian toponyms, at a time when the links between the Carpathian and Balkan language territories are becoming weaker. This is confirmed by the fact that the Romanian toponyms of the nominative-with-article type have no Slavic equivalent, while the suffixes 'eşti' and 'eni' do. It is possible that the latter reappeared due to Slavic influence, for some other Romanian suffixes (e.g. 'iţa' and 'işte') were clearly derived from Slavic forms.

Gyula and the Gyulas 2. FROM THE HUNGARIAN CONQUEST TO THE
MONGOL INVASION The Gyulas in Alliance with Byzantium
The Land of the Gyulas
Perhaps the most important task of gyula Bogát was to assure the supply of salt, an essential commodity for the Hungarians, who rotated their large stock of animals from pasture to pasture. When Bogát became the leader of the clans that had taken over the salt-mines north of the Maros in the first stage of the conquest, he had to cope with many dangers. Attacks could come at any time from the Pechenegs, who had occupied the Etelköz region. As archaeological finds dating from the 10th century attest (cf. the Bulgar cemeteries at Maroskarna and Csombord), the warriors, salt-miners and gold-washers of the Bulgar Czar Simeon remained in places south of the Maros. In 913, Simeon launched the first in a series of military campaigns by which he seized from the Byzantines most of the Balkan Peninsula; six years later, he exchanged his title of Great Khan for that of Czar. He was not a man to let the salt mines and gold deposits of southern Transylvania pass into Hungarian hands without a fight. In order to conquer the rest of Transylvania as well as the region between the Maros, Tisza, and Danube rivers ('Glad's' domain according to Anonymus, but {1-390.} most likely under Bulgar rule), the Hungarians would need to ally themselves with the Pechenegs against the Bulgars. The painful consequences of the alliance of Bulgars and Pechenegs in 895 were still fresh in the Hungarians' memory. As long as the Pechenegs remained hostile, the Hungarians would not dare to provoke Simeon by seizing his lands north of the Carpathians and the Danube.
Even later, the part of Transylvania lying south of the Maros had different status. Unlike the north, it was not divided up into counties but remained a single province, governed by a voivode who outranked counts and who, in 1111, became princeps ultrasilvanus; his higher rank may have been indirectly derived from that of his predecessor, the Bulgar viceroy. Around 948, Constantine Porphyrogenetos referred to the Hungarian tribal chiefs as voievoda, borrowing perhaps the term applied by Transylvanian Slavs to their new masters. The two parts of Transylvania, north and south of the Maros, differed not only in respect to administration but also in their property structure. In the north, the clans who had conquered the region remained in place after the institution of a monarchy. The south, on the other hand, was settled only during and after the reign of King St. Stephen, by families of major landowners (only the Gyógyi family may have been of a different status). There were also, as noted, significant differences between the Slavic groups that inhabited the two regions. All indications are that southern Transylvania was occupied by the Hungarians somewhat later, and in different circumstances, than the north.
The opportunity came with the formation (ca. 932) of a Pecheneg-Hungarian alliance. It is possible that the gyula Bogát had acted earlier, but if not, he must have seized this chance to occupy southern Transylvania. In breaking the Bulgars' resistance, the Hungarians were helped not only by their Pecheneg allies but also by the internal struggle — exacerbated by Byzantine meddling — over the succession to Czar Simeon, who died in 927. In {1-391.} 934, the Serbs shook off Bulgar rule and put themselves under the protection of Byzantium. This may have presented Bogát's successor, the gyula Zombor, with the opportunity to occupy the land lying between the Maros, Tisza, and Danube rivers; in that region, there is no toponymic trace of Bogát, but several place-names evoke Zombor.
Having seized southern Transylvania from the Bulgars, Bogát's warriors and their servants settled down in Slavic villages along the lower reaches of the Küküllő rivers. Three of the five toponyms (noted earlier) that preserve the Slavic nasal sound which disappeared in the 10th century occur in this district, as does Marosbogát; thus these settlements can be dated with some precision. Fewer Hungarians settled south of the Nagy-Küküllő and along the right bank of the Maros where that river turns southward. The Slavs in those areas must have retained their language at least until the arrival of the Romanians, for the latter took over Slavic place-names. In any case, the Slavic population in the region between the Nagy-Küküllő and the Olt was comparatively sparse, perhaps because some of the Bulgars had fled. Bogát had to assure the defence of the newly-conquered region's southern frontier, particularly at the southeastern mountain passes of Törcsvár, Tömös, Tatár, Bodza, and Ojtoz, which were the most vulnerable to Pecheneg and Bulgar attack. Bogát's only military outpost in southern Transylvania was located at a place still called Oltbogát; a little farther north along the Olt River, two villages bear the name of his successor,

Zsombor. Bogát evidently settled some of his Hungarian warriors in this district. Many localities in the Olt bend bear old Hungarian names, but there is no knowing which were named in the 10th century, and which later, by Székelys who preserved the early toponymic customs. At any rate, the previously-noted archaeological sites in the Székelyföld, at Eresztevény, Kézdivásárhely, Köpec, Sepsiszentgyörgy, and Székelyderzs, can safely be attributed to Bogát's Hungarians.
{1-392.} The castle of Gyulafehérvár was raised upon the ruins of Apulum by the gyula Bogát or his successor, hence the name. Archaeological finds at Maroskarna, Tinód, Gombás, and Magyarlapád testify to the settlement of Hungarians in the vicinity of the castle. Since very few toponyms south of the Maros duplicate others along the Szamos (Kend is a rare exception), it is not likely that large fragments of the northern tribes moved to the region (as happened later with the Székelys). The massive settlement of Pechenegs on Hungarian territory is generally dated after 955. However, the loose confederation of Pecheneg tribes, spread over a vast territory, was already breaking apart in the 10th century; in the 11th century, after serving as mercenaries of the Russians and Byzantines, many Pechenegs settled in Hungary and the Balkan Peninsula. The beginnings of this process can already be felt in Bogát's settlements. The toponym Besenyő (Pecheneg) occurs only once north of the Maros, near Beszterce, whereas to the south, there are five of them, and the name of a Pecheneg tribe is preserved in Talmács, at the Vöröstorony Pass. It was perhaps in this period that a larger group of Pechenegs settled in the Barcaság, around the streams whose names, as noted earlier, have a Turkic ring. The toponym Berény, in Hunyad county, may evoke another eastern ethnic group that participated in Bogát's campaign. Place-names such as Bercel, Kálóz, Oszlár, Varsány, and Várkony, which evoke other ethnic groups and occur with some frequency in Hungary, are absent in Transylvania, and it can be concluded that these groups were not represented in the army led by Bogát.
It is likely that some Bulgars stayed behind when their region was conquered by the Hungarians. Since, in the 10th century, the Hungarians still referred to Bulgars as Nándor or Lándor, the toponyms Lándor (found on the left bank of the Maros, at the confluence of that river and the Aranyos) and Nándor (in Hunyad county) presumably evoke Bulgar settlements that survived the conquest. And since these ethnic appellations fell into disuse after {1-393.} the Bulgars lost their independence, around the year 1000 (a situation that lasted for two centuries), places in southern Transylvania that have 'Bolgár' (Bulgar) in their names (e.g. Bolgárcserged, Bolgárszékes, Bolgárszeg) were probably founded only after the advent of the Hungarian monarchy. More striking is the incidence of places with 'Orosz' (Russian) in their name, such as Oroszi and Oroszfalu, in areas south of the Maros that were not inhabited originally by Eastern Slavs. Some owe their name to post-13th-century immigrants, but the older-style toponyms without suffixes may be linked to Russians who had been recruited by Bogát. There are three such localities (called Reussen, Reussmarkt and Reussdörfchen by their later German inhabitants) in the Székes valley and another, Oroszi, near Marosbogát on the left bank of the Maros. There are also villages named after Russians in the valleys of the Küküllő, Olt, and Sebes rivers in Hunyad county, and the north Transylvanian village of (Mező)kölpény can be added to this list, for its name means 'Russian mercenary',
The region between the Maros, Tisza, and Danube rivers must have come under the rule of a Hungarian gyula by 948, for that was when Emperor Constantine recorded that Orsova, Belgrade, and Sirmium (now Mitrovica) lay near Hungary's borders. What he called 'Turkia's settlement area' included the valleys of the rivers Temes (Timesos), Maros (Muresis), Körös (Krisos), and Tutis (Béga?); this region was bounded on the west by the Tisza, and in the south, next to the Bulgars, by the Istros (Danube) River. The report is confirmed by toponyms. The Hungarian localities that probably already existed at the time include Gyula (known as Gyulamonostora in the Middle Ages), by the Fehér-Körös River, the nearby Zomboregyháza (mentioned in a document from 1261), and the two places named after ethnic auxiliary troops, Besenyő and Talmács, which were located more towards the mountains; (Kis)zombor near the confluence of the Tisza and the Maros, and farther east, another Besenyő; the third Zombor, near Temesvár, {1-394.} mentioned in 1331 as having a church, and, in the same district, two more places called Besenyő. Medieval sources also mention a Zombor and a Gyula as well as a Besenyő and a Talmács in Bács county; a Zombor near Vukovár, in the onetime Valkó county; and yet another Besenyő, as well as a Kölpény (today Kupinovo) in the Szerémség (Sirmia). These place names, together with the record of Constantine Porphyrogenetos, indicate that the gyulas' domain reached from the mouth of the Drava southward to the Iron Gate on the Danube, and even beyond the Danube, for military outposts guarded the frontier with the Bulgars as far as the Sava River. Since the Transylvanian gyulas' authority now extended as far as the Eastern and Southern Carpathians, the formerly Bulgar-owned salt-mines were under their control, and they became the exclusive suppliers of salt to the Hungarian tribes on both salt routes, through Szalacs and on the Maros.

It was a sign of the gyulas' enhanced power that they launched the first Hungarian campaigns against Byzantium, cutting through the weakening defences of the Bulgars. According to Byzantine chronicles, the first campaign occurred in 934; it ended in a peace treaty. Another campaign, in 943, was terminated in similar fashion, and the Byzantines probably had to pay tribute. Thus the gyulas followed the strategy of the tribal confederation, which was to compensate Hungarian warriors for the defeat in 933 at Merseburg with booty from Byzantium. It was a sign of this unity of purpose that a village by the Küküllő bore (and still bears) the name of Fajsz, a prince of the house of Árpád, who ruled Hungary in the mid-900s. It is likely that he received this village, together with a nearby salt-mine, as a gift on the occasion of his marriage to the daughter (or one of the daughters) of the gyula Bogát. As will be seen, this was not the only marriage that served to link the families of the Árpáds and the gyulas.

The Visigoths' Peasant Economy
The areas bearing archaeological traces of the Tervingi Goths' settlement do not fully justify the appellation 'forest dwellers' — thus the Mezőség, Udvarhelyszék, the Barcaság, the Háromszék Basin, Wallachia, and the undulating plains in the valleys of the Szeret, Prut, and Dniester rivers. Over the century of Gothic rule, forests spread freely in the center of Gutthiuda, and in fact the population 'settled around' the forests. To the north and the west, the forests provided the Goths with a protective barrier. The settlements that have been discovered confirm the assertion in contemporary written sources that the Visigoths — unlike their ethnic cousins, the Ostrogoths — were predominantly farmers. In this regard, Vulfila's translation of the Bible into 4th century Visigothic is of immense value, for it reflects the contemporary Visigothic culture. This unique document reveals in detail the life of a people who would soon come to play a historic role in the Great Migrations.
Various types of fields (akrs, thaurp) were ploughed (arjan) with ploughs (hoha) drawn by oxen (auhsa) who were linked with a yoke (jukuzi). The Visigoths sowed grain (kaurn) — wheat (hwaiteis), barley (barizein), rye (kaurno) — as well as flax (saian) to make linen (lein). The result of this work were the green crops (atisk). The harvest (asans) began in the summer, reaping was done {1-158.} with sickles (giltha), crops were transported on carts (gajut) to the threshing yard (gathrask) where they were threshed (thriskan), and the grain was stored in barns (bansts). They ground (malan) the grain with a circular hand mill (quairnus), then baked raised dough (daigs) and a flat bread (hlaifs). However, Visigothic agriculture was inefficient, and yields were low. According to a declaration addressed to Emperor Valens in 366[3] the Tervingi Goths were driven to rely on Roman grain. Judging from the sparse data on horticulture (aurtigard), the Goths possessed little skill at gardening (aurtja).
Food remnants in graves confirm the Gothic Bible's reference to the animals raised by the Visigoths: cattle, pigs, sheep, and goats, as well as horses and donkeys for draught. The commonly found traces of poultry bones (hens, roosters) and eggs in graves indicate the intensive character of this ancillary animal husbandry. Indeed, only a few traces remain of ruminants and mammals in Transylvanian Gothic graves: a whole lamb, a pig's head, and a ham at Marosszentanna, cattle bones at Palatka, a lamb at Csombord, and a pig's shoulder blade at Rugonfalva. It is unlikely that the Visigoths had large herds or flocks, for otherwise they would have left traces of settlement in the area of fine pastures on mountainsides and in the narrower valleys. Indeed, Vulfila's Bible alludes to an intensive form of animal husbandry.
The herds (hairda) and flocks (wrethus) driven in from the pasture (winja) were kept near the village in cow-sheds (garda) and sheep-pens (awistr) enclosed by a wattle fence (fatha). To feed the cattle and horses tethered in the manger (uzeta), the Visigoths reaped (sneitharn) grass to make hay (hawi). It is recorded that the poor people's daily drink was milk (miluks), and that their clothes were made from the wool (wulla) of their sheep.
According to the Gothic Bible, villages had blacksmiths (smitha/aizasmitha) who forged (gasmithon) weapons and tools from iron (eisarn), carpenters (timrja) who worked with hand-axes {1-159.} (aqizi), butchers (skilja), fullers and clothiers (wullareis) who processed wool, fishermen (nuta, fiskja) who used various methods and devices, physicians-healers (lekeis), and potters (kasja) — thus all trades that are essential to a peasant society.
The Gothic potters were as skilled at fashioning (digan) smaller vessels (kas) and larger pots (katils) as they were at making the native lamps (skeimam) that replicated or substituted for Roman lamps (lucarn). However, the Latin origin (lucerna) of the latter word and archaeological finds of late-Roman earthenware and bronze lamps (several of which are decorated, according to the fashion of the time, with Old Christian patterns) indicate that the Goths preferred to use lamps of varying price mass-produced in the Roman provinces. The making of adobe (thaho) was a common skill, but bricks and tiles (skalja) required an expertise similar to that of potters. With regard to pottery, an even cursory comparison of Marosszentanna products and the remarkably similar pottery discovered at Cherniakhov, near Kiev, will confirm the Gothic Bible's account of the high-level craftsmanship of the Gothic artisans. There is no indication that the vessels found in Gothic graves in Transylvania owed in any way to the



The Visigoths' Peasant Economy
https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/27.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:32:07]
legacy of Dacia's earlier inhabitants. The Gothic pottery kilns discovered in Transylvania (SepsiszentgyörgyEprestető, Bögöz-Vízlok) undoubtedly date from the 4th century; they belong to the Late Iron Age ('La Tène') type, which was prevalent throughout the area of Marosszentanna-Cherniakhov culture as well in the proximate Barbaricum.
Judging from the archaeological finds, comb production was a flourishing craft. Some of the blacksmiths must have been able to work more precious metals, and they employed well-proven techniques to mass-produce iron and bronze fibulae for fastening clothes as well as buckles. The raw material for silver objects most probably came from Roman silver coins (silubreins), for the Goths were most aggrieved whenever Rome suspended a treaty with the foederati and withheld the promised money (gild). The gold (gulth) {1-160.} received from Rome (in the form of officially-authenticated bars) was reserved for the king and others of high rank.
When peace treaties were negotiated, the Goths' most important demand was always for free trade relations with Rome. Wine (wein) and cooking-oil (alewja), imported in amphoras, were regarded as necessities by the wealthier Goths. The grave goods testify that glass goblets, cups and tumblers, metallic vessels, and ornamental earthenware were part and parcel of the Goths' everyday life; and so were feminine adornments such as silver and bronze jewellery and beads of all sorts. The Goths also imported valued commodities, such as cotton fabric and other luxury cloths, of which no trace remains in the graves. By the 360s, their economy had come to depend so heavily on the empire that in times of war, the interruption of trade caused severe shortages of essential goods ('quod conmerciis vetitis ultima necessariorum inopia barbari stringebantur'[4]). The one means of repayment about which information has survived were slaves. People for whom the Goths had no use in Gutthiuda were sooner or later sold on the Danubian slave markets. To preserve Dacia's population from this awful fate, Aurelianus evacuated the province.

Christianity and Germanic Religious Beliefs
In recent historiography, Gothic Christianity before 376 is treated as harshly as it was by contemporary Romans, who focused on the bizarre garb of the Goths' pagan priests and priestesses, on the images of barbarian cults that adorned the clan shrines, on the coarse idols borne by carts, and on the stag-drawn holy chariot. The attempts at conversion are considered to have been isolated initiatives that may have had some temporary success only among captured Romans, the oppressed remnants of the local Roman population, {1-166.} and Goths from the lowest social strata. Archaeology is even more demanding, for it seeks in Gothic graves the kind of material evidence that before 376 is exceedingly rare even in the border provinces of the empire.
However, certain aspects of the burial sites at Marosszentanna, Tîrgşor, Spanţov, Izvorul, Mogoşani, and Bîrlad cannot be explained by the Goths' increasingly complex social stratification. In the course of the 4th century, pagan food and drink offerings become smaller and, in many graves, are notable by their absence; concurrently, more and more graves are aligned along a west-east axis and contain only clothing articles. The hands of some of the deceased are clasped on their chest — a custom that began be adopted in the same period in late-Roman burial grounds along the Danube. These phenomena seem to bear the imprint of Eastern Christian funeral rituals; they may also reflect Arian rituals, but the nature of the latter is unknown.
Having suffering defeats at the hands of the Romans in 367 and 369, Athanaric tried divert attention from the responsibility of the 'mighty' for these military disasters by launching a general campaign of persecution against Christians in his domain. Between 369 and 372, his warriors, joined by those of allied commanders, hunted down, tortured, and murdered Christians, burned their churches, and confiscated their possessions. A few Christian groups consisting of prisoners of war and destitute Goths would hardly have warranted such a vast and protracted campaign, one that gave both the Catholic and the Gothic Arian church a host of martyrs bearing Gothic names. As elsewhere, the martyrs (martwre) came mostly from the ranks of priests and other Christian notables, people who accounted for only a tiny proportion of early Christian communities.
After 332, in consequence of the crushing defeat inflicted by Constantine the Great and the dictated peace that ensued, a succession of religious missions had come to Gothia. They included {1-167.} Catholics (Eytikes), Sectarians (Audius), and Arians (Vulfila). Obviously, the Arian mission, which proselytized in Gothic, exerted the greatest influence; its historic contribution was Vulfila's translation of the Bible into Visigothic. Bishops (aipiskaupus) made their appearance: Vulfila, Silvanus, Godda (whose name, from gudja, means 'priest'), along with others whose name has not survived. The sermons (gahanseins) of the missionary-preachers (merjands) brought fruit. Monastic communities and church fellowships (aikklesjo) were founded, and 'houses of God' (gudhus: guth = 'god', hus = 'house') were erected; in the latter, the burning of incense (thoimiama) was a part of the ritual. The congregation was led by the deacon (diakanus) and the presbyter (praizbwtairei). Several Gothic terms were applied to the Christian clergy (gudjinassus). Papa(n) may have designated a presbyter, or an elderly — or senior — priest; ordinary priests were called 'holy men' (weiha) or 'men of God' (gudja). All sorts of churches must have been erected. It is known that at first, religious services were held in tents, and that during Athanaric's anti-Christian campaign, priests were immolated in one particular church, and laymen in another.
Clearly, the missions were by no means ineffectual. In the course of an earlier wave of persecution, in 347–48, many Christians, men as well as women, suffered a glorious martyrdom ('multorum servorum et ancillarum Cristi gloriosum martirium,'[5]) and Vulfila himself was forced to flee, together with a large group of believers ('cum grandi populi confessorum,'[6]). As late as the 6th century, their descendants constituted a Christian community in Moesia.
Athanaric's campaign was sharpened by domestic political tensions, but it did not reach all parts of Gothia. Thus, in the summer of 378, the Arian Fritigern could dispatch a Christian presbyter ('Christiani ritus presbyter,'[7]) as ambassador to Emperor Valens.

In light of all this, it is difficult to understand why, until recently, researchers stubbornly ruled out the possibility that by the 4th {1-168.} century there lived in Guthiuda a sizeable number of Gothic Christians belonging to various denominations. Even more extraordinary is the thesis according to which Goths became Christians (Arian Christians!) only on the territory of the Roman empire, in consequence of the foederati treaty of 382. To be sure, it was in the 390s that the Roman Church regretfully realized that the Goths were Arians. But the roots of Gothic Christianity, nourished by the blood of martyrs, reached back to the first half of the 4th century. This fact is confirmed in the most recent scholarly synthesis, according to which the overwhelming majority of the Goths who invaded the empire in 376 were Arian Christians.
The devotional articles — a bronze wash-bowl, a bronze jug, and a bronze monogram of Christ with a votive inscription — discovered in 1775 in a remote valley at Berethalom (Biertan, Birthälm), south of Medgyes, must have come from a nearby church. Judging from the shape of the donarium, they had been hidden during Athanaric's anti-Christian campaign, and thus the latter must have extended to Transylvania as well. The epigraph on the tabula ansata, EGO ZENOVIVS VOTVM POSVI, was made in Sirmium or Aquileia, in the same place as the Chrismon (Christ's monogram), for the original Illyrian customer. Neither this object nor the bronze vessels that were buried alongside owe anything to Dacia. The symbol of Christ and the ritual vessels were essential requisites of Christian religious service and kept in the churches — in this case, probably in the small chapel of a missionary who had brought with him these devotional objects. In any case, the Christian message was always inherently universal; in the 4th century, like today, it could not be regarded as the privilege of a particular linguistic or ethnic group.
The important role played in the ancient Gothic religion by meat dishes (mammo) or sacrificial meat (hunsl) — a practice that Gothic Christians considered 'unholy' (usweihs) — is evident not only from the graves but also from the Passio S. Sabae. The ritual {1-169.} consumption of the blessed meat dishes (tibr) obtained after the blood sacrifice (blotan) was a special feast (dulths); that feast evidently had its unwritten rules and a sacral significance that united the community. It follows that the absence in graves of food from the heathen (haithna) burial feast (gabaur) must signify a fundamental change in attitude. Pagan funeral chants were banned only in the 6th century, by the Council of Toledo, but it is likely that Christian psalms (psalmon) were heard more and more often at Gothic burials (usfilh, gafilh). In the pagan shrines, holy gardens (alhs), and temples (galiuge stada), the idol (Greek: xoanon) was the counterpart of the sacred symbols venerated in Christian churches. This pagan idol (galiug, galiogaguth) was from time to time paraded on a sacred chariot. The heathens (haithnano) had not only sacrificial places (hunslastaths) but also priests and high priests (ufargudja). For pagan Goths, the day of ThorDonar (Thursday) was a day of rest; the veneration of this deity is attested by bronze, silver, and bone amulets shaped like axes and maces. The runic inscription on the gold torque found at Pietroasa indicates worship of the Gothic 'God' (Gutan-Wotan); the writing itself (gameleins) was the secret (runa = 'secret') sacred science of the Gothic pagan priests. Archaeological digs have yielded no other relics of the ancient Visigothic religion.
The belief in bodily resurrection (for which there are even two Gothic terms: urrists and usstass) spread with the eastern religions and Christianity, and from the 3rd or 4th century onwards, the interment of corpses became a 'compulsory' corollary of this tenet. The practice of cremating the body (purification) was inspired by the ancient beliefs in a nether world populated by shadows. Cremation graveyards, Gothic as well as Roman (such as the first burial site at Baráthely), attest to the survival of adherents of the ancient faith.

{1-170.} The Goths Depart
Archaeological traces of the end of Gothic rule have been found in Transylvania, most of them in the region's southeastern part. In 1887, some 15–16 gold bars, with a total weight of 6 kilograms, were found in the Carpathians at Krászna (= Krasznaüveg-huta), on the Bodza River. Produced in the mint at Sirmium, they bear a series of state hallmarks. Two of the bars bear the likeness of three emperors — one child and two adults — as well as the letters DDD NNN, signifying their joint reign, evidence that dates the bars between 367 and 375 (Valentinian I, Valens, Gratian); the treasure is therefore coincidental with the Goths' great 'collapse' of 376–380, which began with their migration across the Danube and ended with Athanaric's flight. It also offers evidence of the collapse, for the Krászna trove had been most probably 'salvaged' from the Gothic treasury by someone fleeing through the Bodza pass; the refugee had hurriedly buried the gold and never found the opportunity to reclaim it. Minted in Sirmium, Thessaloniki, and Naissus, the five gold bars discovered in 1880 at Szászföldvár are part of a similar treasure; the one bar that remains also bears the image of three emperors, supposedly Valentinian II, Gratian, and Theodosius I; even if that identification is correct, the gold bars cannot date from later than 379 or 380.
The treasure unearthed at Gyergyó-Tekerőpatak-Kápolnaoldal (which was noted earlier) included not only silver jewellery but also forty silver coins and a gold solidus, the most recent coin, dating from the reign of Gratian (367383). The latter coin also coincides with the period of the collapse; it thus offers a useful guide to dating the jewels and ornaments in this trove, which were noted earlier in the analysis of Visigothic society. At Maroscsapó, a commoner buried his tiny fortune of 15 coins, the latest of which are four pieces minted under Valerian I (364375). Another, somewhat wealthier, commoner buried his life savings of 75 coins near {1-171.} Zernyest, in Törcsvár Pass (yet another case of a treasure concealed in the course of flight through a mountain pass!); the latest mintages are those of Valentinian I, Gratian, and, allegedly, Valentinian II, and all fit into the period 376–380. The 83 bronze coins buried at Szamosújvár probably constitute a fortune that a family had amassed over a long period; 56 of them are the mintage of Valerian I, Valens, and Gratian, extending up to 375, which gives an accurate indication that the catastrophe struck the Goths of northern Transylvania in the same way and at the same time as elsewhere. In southern Transylvania, a purse full of coins, minted under Valentinian I and Valens, was found buried in the Roman amphitheatre at Várhely.
The most important trove is that of Tekerőpatak, for none of the other Visigothic burial sites — some sixty in all — yielded fibulae, clasps, and pendants of a later type than those in this treasure. A sign of the generalized catastrophe is that between 376 and 381, Visigothic burial grounds fell into disuse; how many of the people who had used these cemeteries fled and scattered in the lands north of the Danube is not known. The region of the lower Danube entered a new period: that of Hun rule.
*
The Visigoths had destroyed the fortresses, towns, and villages of Roman Dacia. Worse still, during their centurylong rule, whatever survived the wars was allowed to go to ruin, including, notably the gold mines; the goldmining districts were known as an uninhabited wilderness throughout the early Middle Ages. The Goths made as little of the Roman way of life as the Alamanni, who had occupied the Agri Decumates (lying between the Rhine, Neckar, and Danube rivers) and Western Raetia at the very same time that the Goths took over Dacia. The land seized by the Alamanni projected into the rich Rhine and Danubian provinces and was no {1-172.} smaller than the Transylvanian part of Dacia occupied by the Romans. It had been conquered by the Romans a quarter of a century earlier, during the reign of the Flavii. Its border, the Raetian limes, was protected from Germanic attacks by the Roman empire's 'Great Wall'; within the province, the Romans erected a chain of fortresses almost unequalled in the whole empire. After the Alamanic invasion, the abandoned fortresses and inner settlements were overgrown by forests, and their names were not preserved by the Germans, who sought only ploughland and pasture. The tiny remnant of the 'Roman' population was assimilated by the conquerors. This contemporaneous episode may well

The Székelys' Struggle for Independence and György Székely's Peasant Rising
Although the peasant rising in Northern Transylvania, led by Antal Nagy Budai, came almost a century before the nationwide rising associated with the name of György Székely (otherwise known as Dózsa), this should not be construed to mean that Transylvania was socially more developed. On the contrary, Transylvania failed to keep pace when, in the late Middle Ages, a market economy emerged in other parts of Hungary; there, despite the efforts of landowners, peasants began to produce for the market and secure legal guarantees for this activity through the establishment of market towns. The various forms of free peasantry associated with military service went into a decline: the Jazyges, the Cumanians, and the Saxons in the Szepesség became villeins, or, in the case of their leaders, joined the nobility or the middle class. In Transylvania, development in this direction was inconsistent and {1-516.} piecemeal. The process of urbanization was truly dynamic only in Saxon areas, where it was spurred mainly by trade with the Romanian voivodeships, and only part of this commerce involved locallyproduced goods. Among the towns in the noble counties, only Kolozsvár attained the status of royal free borough; the others remained modest, rural market towns (mezőváros), as did the urban centres of the Székely seats. Monocultures adapted to the export trade, such as stock-rearing and viticulture around the market towns of the Great Plain and the Tokaj region, failed to develop around Transylvania's market towns, whose economic function was simply to serve as their district's weekly marketplace.
Only the Saxon peasantry managed to develop fruitful contact with the towns, which took up its surplus produce and manpower, without putting itself in a state of feudal dependence. Kolozsvár did exert a powerful pull on villages and market towns in the Kalotaszeg and Mezőség regions; many villeins migrated to find freedom within its walls. As noted, the result was a progressive Magyarization of Kolozsvár until, in 1458, the relations between the town's Saxons and Hungarians were codified on the model of Buda: each group elected the town magistrate in alternate years. Villagers migrated to the rural market towns as well, but the consequences were more ethnic than economic. Romanians settled to take the place of departing Hungarian villeins, and pastureland was expanded at the expense of ploughland. Due to the slow pace of urbanization in the Transylvanian counties, the villeins felt the impact of a money economy more in the growing demands of their landlords than in the opportunities of an open market. Thus it was economic backwardness that inspired a deepening discontent. Memories of the unsuccessful revolt inhibited open resistance among the villeins, and the centre of social unrest now shifted from the noble counties to the Székelyföld.
The advent of a market economy and the coincident spread of mercenary armies led to a crisis in the traditional world of the Székely free peasantry. The weakness of urbanization prevented the {1-517.} Székelys from becoming, like the Saxons, independent producers for the market, and from thus avoiding feudal dependence. The shift to a state of continuous war, waged by professional soldiers, meant that Székelys could no longer count on military service. The growing inequalities of wealth deprived more and more Székelys of the ability to enjoy their traditional liberties. The Székelys were a prolific people, and, as time went on, common lands were divided into smaller and smaller plots, leaving the majority of the peasantry in possession of an uneconomically tiny piece of land. In any case, the land was not very fertile, and many Székelys could only survive by going to work for wealthier landowners. The Székely élite, with estates in the counties as well as the Székelyföld, would have preferred that their labourers in the latter become as dependent as those in the former, i.e., to make the contractual links compulsory rather than voluntary, and to bring the Székely peasants under the landlord's legal and economic authority. By the mid-1400s, such infringements on liberty were giving rise to violent attacks on the landlords. Since Székelys who became dependent villeins were no longer eligible for military service, the Crown took steps in the interest of national defence. When he was serving as Hungary's governor and as Transylvania's voivode, János Hunyadi twice intervened on behalf of oppressed commoners, first in 1446, when he was Regent of Hungary, and again in 1453, as Transylvania's voivode. Matthias Hunyadi followed suit, and it was at his request that, in 1466, the voivode (who since 1461 also held the post of Székely count) convened Transylvanian nobles and Székely elders to help codify the Székelys' traditional freedoms. The resultant decrees made clear that Székely

commoners could enter service only of their own free will, and not under compulsion from the nobles. At the same time, the Székely commoners reached for influence in administrative and judicial affairs by adopting the rule that two-thirds of the associate judges in seat courts be chosen from among them.
{1-518.} However, this confirmation of the Székelys' freedoms did nothing to provide poorer commoners with the resources necessary for military service. By now, many of them could not afford to serve even in the light cavalry. In 1437, the king issued new regulations that had the effect of formalizing the stratification of Székely society. Székelys who could furnish at least three mounted retainers or mercenaries constituted the leading class (primores), and those who personally served in the cavalry became the lófő class (primipili), while the majority of commoners (pixidarii) could serve in the infantry without losing their personal freedom.
That last clause was clearly a concession on the part of the king, for a poorly-equipped peasant-infantryman was of limited value in battle. Still, such soldiers could be of some use against the Ottomans, who often threw into battle vast numbers of inferior troops. Moreover, King Matthias deliberately favoured the lower strata of freemen (including not only the Székelys but also the lesser nobility and the urban citizenry) in the hope that they would serve as a counterweight to the dangerously great power of the aristocracy. These measures saved many Székelys from feudal dependency, but those who could not afford to serve even as foot soldiers were now formally relegated to a state of servitude. With the elevation of some commoners to the rank of lófő, public officials and associate judges came to be selected exclusively from the two upper strata, while the rest were effectively excluded from public life.
Intent on consolidating the power of the monarchy, Matthias was determined to exact services even from those poor Székelys who no longer performed military duties. István Báthori, who became voivode in 1479 (and thus also held the office of Székely count, the two posts having been linked in 1461) decreed that these Székelys were obligated to participate in public works, beginning with the raising of a royal fortress at Udvarhely. Seeing a threat to both their autonomy and their supply of manpower, the primores {1-519.} sought legal redress in 1492 from Wladislas II. They reminded the king of their sacrifices in defence of Hungary: 'Our bones are piled high, and streams run red with our blood in Moldavia, Wallachia, Serbia, Turkey, Croatia and Bulgaria'.[23] The success of their quest owed more to the presence at court of Báthori's influential rivals, who soon engineered the recall of the heavy-handed voivode.
The Székely crisis deepened when primores and lófős began to harass the soldier-freemen. This turn was caused indirectly by development in the rest of Hungary proper, where the feudal system had evolved quite differently from that in Transylvania. Some years before the union of that province's three 'nations', Hungary's lesser nobility had fought for, and won representation in the diet, thereby coming to form a second feudal estate alongside the upper nobility; at the same time, they sought to reduce the role of the third feudal estate, the royal free boroughs. In Transylvania, on the other hand, both high and low nobles remained within one 'nation', leaving the Székely soldier-freemen to play the role of the lesser nobility. King Matthias had tried to free Hungary's lesser nobles from the oppressive power of the aristocracy, and to give them a measure of autonomy in the administrative institutions of the counties. However, after the death of this distinguished monarch, the aristocracy regained its dominant role. Some aristocrats tried to exploit the discontent of the lesser nobility for partisan purposes. The immensely wealthy Szapolyai family was particularly skilled in pursuing this tactic and securing the lesser nobles' backing without offering much in return. As diets followed each other in quick succession during the early 1500s, the lesser nobles, who would appear at the sessions fully armed, and in large numbers, obtained the right to a voice in national politics.
This movement had repercussions in Transylvania, for it encouraged the restless Székely soldier-freemen to confront the nobility. Forgoing royal assent, and they convened national assemblies — at which the royal court was not represented — in 1505 at {1-520.} Udvarhely, and the following year at Agyagfalva. There was as much sabre-rattling and clamour at these meetings as at the concurrent Hungarian diets in Rákos. Radical resolutions were passed condemning nobles and reaffirming the principle of equality for all Székelys, or, rather, for all Székely soldier-freemen. Never had the Székelys displayed such a strong sense of identity. The tradition widely-acknowledged and traceable back to the thirteenth century — that the Székelys originated from Huns who, after the break-up of Attila's empire, withdrew to Transylvania, acquired new political importance. The belief that they descended from the legendary Huns filled ordinary Székelys with pride and the conviction that they, more

than any other group, embodied the 'Scythian' (Szittya) military virtues of the Hunnish-Hungarian kindred peoples; they further believed that this distinction justified their traditional privileges. At the time, Hungary's nobility had also become enamoured of its 'Scythian ancestors'. The national chronicle was constantly rewritten, and one version, which in 1488 was the first work to be printed in Hungary, reached a wide readership with its assertion that the Hungarians and Huns were one people. The romantic evocation of the Huns — one of the most characteristic aspects of the Hungarian nobility's cultural outlook in the late Middle Ages — focused interest on the Székelys, whose 'Scythian' precedence was readily acknowledged.
The Székelys' self-esteem was fed by their sense of injustice as well as by the diets that were convened to deal with the issue. The situation was already explosive when in 1506, a son was born to the king, and the latter decreed that the Székelys should pay the ox-tax that was traditional on such occasions. The Székely military class considered itself part of the nobility and therefore felt that the tax was unfair, for Hungary's nobles had been long exempt from taxation. Moreover, the ox-tax was a heavy burden for ordinary Székelys, whose material circumstances were steadily deteriorating. Thus wounded pride combined with economic distress to drive {1-521.} the Székelys to revolt. Delegated to restore order, the captain of Fogaras, Pál Tomori, was defeated in the first clash and, wounded, fled back to his castle. (Twenty years later, the same Tomori, then Archbishop of Kalocsa, would lead the Hungarian army into defeat at the hands of the Ottomans near Mohács.) Additional royal troops had to be dispatched before the Székelys' rebellion was quelled. Saxons from Szeben had participated in the repression, and, in reprisal, the Székelys launched an attack on them the following year. On that occasion, the Székelys were led by a man from Makfalva, György Dózsa, who by some accounts bore the name György Székely when he served earlier in a frontier post, and who earned lasting fame as the leader of Hungary's great peasant rebellion in 1514.
The Székelys' desperate attempts to preserve their liberties were doomed. In 1510, the king bowed to public pressure and appointed John Szapolyai as voivode of Transylvania. Szapolyai was the nobility's preferred candidate for the throne and the most determined opponent of the royal court's pro-Habsburg faction. On the national scene, this powerful aristocrat presented himself as the spokesman of the lesser nobility, but in Transylvania he followed the example of his predecessors and acted like a despot. The Székelys soon discovered that political reality fell far short of the slogans. In 1519, after the Székelys had been driven to revolt by the arbitrary actions of their deputy count, Szapolyai personally led the reprisals. To teach them a lesson, he seized the rebels' property and transferred it to the king's domain, thus ignoring the law, which provided that even in the event of treason, Székely lands could be transferred only to other family members, and not to the king. Szapolyai's actions mark a turning point for the Székelys: the Court henceforth would deliberately aim to restrict their rights, a policy that was destined to keep the military-minded Székely commoners in ferment for centuries.
{1-522.} The common Székelys fought for their rights as nobles, and not against oppression by the nobility, which was the issue that drove the peasantry to revolt. Thus György Székely (Dózsa) — who came from the frontier zone on the Lower Danube to lead a movement that began as a crusade and ended up, in 1514, as a revolt against feudalism — is an exception; as far as is known, he and his younger brother were the only Székely soldiers to espouse the peasant's cause. The peasant rising, which originated in the Great Plain, did not touch the Székelyföld, but it did involve villeins in the Transylvanian counties. The Beszterce district, the scene of similar unrest seventyfive years earlier, once again erupted. Manor houses were put to the torch, and then two salt-mining towns, Dés and Torda, joined the uprising. The arrival of troops from the Great Plain only served to fuel the flames of rebellion in the mining district, in Abrudbánya, Zalatna, and Torockó. In the event, Szapolyai proved to be an effective defender of the feudal order, for his men succeeded in crushing all the nests of rebellion. Apprised of Dózsa's plan to thrust into Transylvania with the main peasant army, the voivode led his troops southward. On the way, on 18 June, he convened an assembly of the three 'nations' at Déva, and when he learned that Dózsa had changed course towards Temesvár, he hastened in the same direction.
One of Dózsa's lieutenants, the priest Lőrinc, had occupied Nagyvárad, and launched a diversionary attack on Kolozsvár in order to draw away the army of Transylvania's nobles. The municipal councillors did not want to repeat their earlier mistake, when on the advice of János, son of Jakab, they had sided with insurgents, but they were equally reluctant to put up any resistance. The chief judge, János Kalmár, devised a compromise, in terms of which only the peasant army's officers were allowed into the town. The peasant forces set up camp in the fields nearby, where they repelled an attack led by the deputy voivode, Lénárt Barlabássy. In the meantime, municipal guards, acting on the orders of the chief judge, slew {1-523.} the peasant captains. Father Lőrinc, who had stayed out

of town, found himself between two hostile forces and decided to withdraw from Transylvania. But the peasant uprising in other parts of Hungary was nearing its tragic end. The revolt, like the disastrous defeat in 1526 at Mohács, influenced only indirectly the course of Transylvania's history.

The Ruling Class 2. ECONOMY, SOCIETY, AND CULTURE OF THE
NEW STATE Society and Culture
Society and Political Power
Prior to 1526, Transylvania was governed by feudal estates in a system marked by legal and operational complexity. Three groups, the nobility, the Saxons, and the Székelys, had a roughly equal share of political power, which they exercised in greater or lesser harmony with the voivode, the representative of central authority.
In the decades of Transylvania's transition to independence, there occurred significant changes in the balance of political power. Due to its internal decomposition and fruitless rebellions, Székely society found itself gradually excluded from the political process, and its leaders became assimilated to the nobility. The more or less overt, proHabsburg bias of Saxon towns induced a degree of political passivity. The office of voivode was abolished.
No new social forces appeared to fill the gap left by these changes. The development of market towns that had been attached to Transylvania soon ground to a halt, and in the one exception, Debrecen, the peasant-citizens were largely excluded from political participation. The nobility, having stabilized its economic position, was left without political rivals. Thus when Transylvania became independent, it retained an archaic feudal system. The new state was founded on the somewhat deceptive notion of a feudal order of 'three nations'; in practice, political power lay in the hands of the nobility and their counterparts from the Partium.
{1-723.} As noted, the estates that generated the greatest economic and social power were located in the Partium, and thus the members of the ruling class who lived in the region east of the Tisza and the Szamos valley came to play a leading role in the construction of the new state. György Fráter's power was underpinned by the estates of the Várad bishopric. Towards the end of the 16th century, the Somlyó branch of the Báthori family became master of much of the Partium, and it contributed most of the leading statesmen of the era, including the ruling prince.
At its inception, the new state of Transylvania showed a number of typically medieval features. Its constituent elements, political, social, and feudal, enjoyed a high degree of autonomy. Thus in the protracted contest for power between György Fráter and Queen Isabella, several of these elements played an active role: the aristocracy, the pro-Habsburg Saxon Universitas, and the Székelys, the latter being potential supporters of the recurring challenges to John Sigismund.
The proliferation of Protestant sects reflected the multipolar character of Transylvanian society. The common pattern in other European countries was that either the Roman Catholic or one of the Protestant churches would eventually prevail to become the state-sanctioned religion, excluding all others. By contrast, in Transylvania, legislation enacted from the mid-1540s onwards tended to grant equal rights to the rival churches and sects. As late as 1545, the diet passed bills in defence of priests and monks and against religious reform, but only in the most general terms. By 1548, the Torda diet contented itself with prohibiting further active efforts at conversion by Catholics and Lutherans alike. This law was subsequently reaffirmed on more than one occasion, guaranteeing that Catholics and Lutherans, later joined by Calvinists and Unitarians, could coexist in comparative peace and equality, free from any threat of official reprisals.
{1-724.} Each denomination was backed by some important social element. Although the Roman Catholic Church lost its state subsidy (and with it, its old organizational structure) in 1556, the most powerful landowners in the region east of the Tisza, the Báthori family from Somlyó, remained in the fold, as did many of the Székelys in Transylvania proper. The Saxon 'nation' rallied to Lutheranism, and so did, for a time, much of the Hungarian nobility, including such leading figures as Orbán Batthyány and members of the Kendi, Perényi, Csáky, Drágffy, and Barcsai families. The Calvinist Church also got its initial backing from a powerful aristocrat, Péter Petrovics; over time, many peasant-citizens of the market towns of the region east of the Tisza converted to Calvinism, as did an even larger proportion of the Hungarian nobility. A later arrival, Unitarianism, drew its most stalwart adherents from the Hungarian urban middle classes in Transylvania.
The circumstances that led burghers and peasant-citizens to rally to Protestantism have already been noted. It is

less obvious why the feudal ruling class, so comfortable with the established Church, should have felt drawn to a new faith that had close links to urban culture. At least in Transylvania, the motive was not likely to have been any expectation of material gain arising from the expropriation of Church property, for most of that — including Kolozsmonostor and the episcopal domains of Gyulafehérvár and Várad — reverted to the crown. Only in the Upper Tisza region did some landowners, such as the Perényi family, profit from the expropriation.
It is more likely that most of the nobility was driven by spiritual motives, by a certain crisis of conscience. (After all, even among high-ranking Catholic clergymen there were many who converted to Protestantism, including Mihály Csáky, vicar of the Transylvanian diocese until 1545, as well as three canons who became noted religious reformers, Kálmáncsehi, Sebestyén Károlyi Boldi, and Péter Kolozsvári.) The tragic collapse of the Hungarian {1725.} feudal state induced doubts about traditional values. By focusing on the sins and errors of the past, the Reformation offered an explanation of that collapse, helping the new generation to distance itself from the values of its predecessors.
This not wholly predictable shift in attitudes was facilitated by the Renaissance, for, by the turn of the 16th century, humanistic ideology had already shaken some of the Hungarian nobility out of their traditional way of thinking. This cultural renewal, with its philological thrust and its cult of Antiquity, nourished a spirit of individualism. It first struck root among lawyers and jurists, people who had an essential function in the world of the nobility. Werbőczy, the author of the Tripartitum, was influenced by these ideas, and he had a great impact on the following generation. His intellectual approach was systematic, and he readily resorted to the imagery of antique mythology. Although this venerable legal scholar never abandoned Catholicism, his successors felt less bound by the old faith.
As time went on, power shifts in Transylvanian society progressively curtailed the influence of the feudal estates. Although, as noted, the process led to a reinvigoration of the old ruling class, the real winner was the central government. Considering the difficult beginnings, King John's modest means, and György Fráter's protracted struggles, this outcome begs explanation. Hungary, mortally wounded at Mohács, bequeathed a hard fate to the new state of Transylvania. Caught between two great powers, the country disposed of fewer resources than onetime Hungary, and it could survive only by making sacrifices and pursuing astute diplomacy.
On the eve of Mohács, the Hungarian Kingdom encompassed close to four million people. At the end of the 16th century, the Principality of Transylvania (including the Partium) counted slightly over one million inhabitants.

Furthermore, Transylvania's princes drew less revenue from mining than Hungary's kings had earlier. Their only significant sources were the gold mines of the Erzgebirge (Érchegység) and the salt mines in the Máramaros, at Dés, Torda, Vizakna, and in the Székelyföld. Long-distance trade declined, not least because the main customs posts were now located near Pozsony, and thus Transylvania was deprived of its profitable market in the west.
If, in these circumstances, the central government nevertheless managed to consolidate its power, it was largely thanks to the crown properties assembled by György Fráter and preserved, indeed, expanded by his successors. The domains of Gyulafehérvár, Déva, Várad, Gyalu, Fogaras, Kővár, Görgény, Kolozsmonostor, Szamosújvár, Jenő, Lugos, and Karánsebes always belonged to the exchequer, and so did, in various periods, many others, notably those of Székelytámad, Székelybánja, Zalatna, Huszt, and Törcsvár.

Although these vast domains and the other, smaller ones did not bring great revenues to the state, they nevertheless outweighed those of any potential rival for power. They encompassed some seven hundred villages, which meant that 15–20 percent of the country was directly under the administration of the princely government. This proportion only increased when the greatest aristocratic family, that of Stephen Báthori, acceded to power. The crown properties went a long way to help Transylvania's rulers stabilize {1-727.} state finances. By rough estimation, the royal treasurer could count on the following revenues in the third quarter of the 16th century:
24,000 households in the Transylvanian counties The Saxons' St. Martin's day tax The Saxons' special taxes Town taxes The Székelys' dica 17,000 households in the Partium Salt mines (Máramaros and Transylvania) Customs duties Gold exchange Tithe rents
60,000 8,500 25,000 15,000 20,000 40,000 30,000 15,000 5,000 15,000
forints
To these must be added an uncertain amount of cash profits generated by the crown estates as well as sundry administrative fees, notably for transfers of property.
By a very rough estimate, then, state revenues stood at an annual 300,000 forints — a considerable sum, even taking inflation into account. From the reign of Queen Isabella onwards, Transylvania's monarchs exercised discretionary authority to fill all official posts. The queen had reconstituted the royal chancellery, with Mihály Csáky at its head. The rulers appointed the judges on the royal court of appeal, or supreme court; the chancellor, two prothonotaries, a crown attorney known as the director causarum, and 8–10 jurymen. Other royal appointees included the commanders of the armed forces, the lord lieutenants of counties, Székely magistrates, and members of the privy council.
The monarch had unlimited authority to make foreign policy, thus to forge alliances, declare war, and negotiate peace treaties. The allocation of public expenditures was also his exclusive resort, and the treasurer was answerable only to him. (The largest budget {1-728.} items were defence, the salary of top government officials, and annual tribute to the Ottomans, which in 1575 was raised from 10,000 to 15,000 forints; the expenses of the royal court remained modest until Zsigmond Báthori became prince.) The monarch alone could grant land and titles of nobility.
As time went by, the feudal estates' supervisory and controlling function became more and more nominal. Diets were convened at least twice, and sometimes four or five times a year, but their composition underwent major changes. The practice of inviting the participation of each and every noble from the three 'nations' and the Partium lapsed after 1545. The seats, counties, and towns came to be represented by a constantly varying number of deputies. Far greater influence was wielded by a numerically smaller group consisting of leading government figures (councillors, high court judges, and other high-ranking officials) and of the 'regalists', nobles who were personally selected by the monarch. Since Transylvania had nothing comparable to Hungary's old aristocracy, there were few constraints on the ruler's choice. To be sure, the biggest landowners could not be excluded, but most of the regalists were picked for their loyalty to the sovereign.
The customary right of the feudal estates to convene diets also lapsed after 1556. The monarch alone could call the diet into session, and the agenda was dominated by his motions (propositió). The feudal estates generally limited themselves to petitions (postulatum) concerning matters of secondary importance, such as local and judicial problems. The record shows that, in contrast to the petitions, the ruler's motions were generally approved.
Only rarely was the diet strong and confident enough to defy the monarch's will; most cases date from the period of confrontation between Isabella and György Fráter. Only in 1571–72, at the beginning of the reign of Stephen Báthori, did the gentlemen of the diet dare to request from their chosen ruler that his treasurer give an accounting of state finances. More typical was their reaction to the {1-729.} murder in 1558 of Ferenc Bebek and the Kendi

brothers. At first, the feudal estates indignantly denounced the act, but when Isabella resorted to the threat of force in the person of Menyhárt Balassa and his soldiers, the diet hastened to give its ex post facto approval to the 'traitors's execution'.
Needless to say that Stephen Báthori had neither the time nor the energy to make all decisions himself. Much of the work devolved upon the chancellors. The councillors also came to play a more important role. The powers of these appointed officials — notably Ferenc Forgách, Márton Berzeviczy, Imre Sulyok, Farkas Kovacsóczy, and, during Zsigmond Báthori's reign, István Jósika — were not defined in law; in practice, this absence of constraint only enhanced the power of their master.
The power structure did not change when Stephen Báthori was elected King of Poland. As noted, the Transylvanian chancellery in Cracow, headed by Márton Berzeviczy, exercised greater authority than the one in the principality under Farkas Kovacsóczy; it has also been noted how after the death of Kristóf Báthori, the Cracow chancellery became the sole locus of decision-making.
The creation of the new state came about under external pressure, but it owed to the ruling class's instinct for selfpreservation. This ruling class was essentially Hungarian, and it preserved a consciousness of its national identity all through the stormy period of the country's disintegration. This feature was reinforced both by the assimilation of the Székely elite into the feudal social order, and by the decision of the Saxon patricians to keep their distance.
That Hungarians played the leading role was generally acknowledged in Transylvanian society, and this fact had to be accommodated by all those who aspired to social advancement. In the case of the Romanians, Transylvania's second largest ethnic group, their more ambitious leaders, as noted, could become full-fledged nobles only if they broke away from their community. A typical example is that of Miklós Oláh, the most famous Romanian {1-730.} in 16th-century Transylvania. Born in Nagyszeben of Wallachian boyar parents, he was ordained a Roman Catholic priest, and at the end of his life he was serving as Archbishop of Esztergom, Prince Primate of Hungary; for a time, he also acted as Governor of Habsburg Hungary. Oláh counted among the leading humanists of his times. He considered himself to be a Hungarus, a member of the Hungarian ruling class; his writings, which bear no trace of the author's Romanian origins, dealt with Hungary and with the glorious reigns of the Hun ruler Attila and of King Matthias Hunyadi. István Maylád, who was the first, in 1539–40, to attempt to sever Transylvania from the Hungarian crown, came from an ennobled family of boyars in Fogaras.
There are other noteworthy examples of people from a non-Hungarian ethnic background who rose to greatness. György Fráter, who pursued a quintessentially Hungarian policy as leader of Transylvania, was of CroatDalmatian origin. The leader of nobles in the region east of the Tisza and the Temesköz, Péter Petrovics, came from Slavonia.
With its strong central government, and attached to its Hungarian identity, the Principality of Transylvania gradually became the focal point of Hungarian politics. Hungary proper, consisting of the Habsburg counties, was dominated by disputes between the sovereign and the feudal estates and became ever more closely tied to the other parts of the Habsburgs' realm. At the same time, Transylvania, although nominally dependent on the Ottomans, retained a great deal of autonomy in dealing with important issues. An awareness of this situation's advantages led Stephen Báthori to seek a solution of the Hungarian problem from the starting point of Transylvania. His conception would serve as one of the pillars of Hungarian politics over the ensuing hundred years.

Commerce and the Economy: the First Growth Phase 3. THE ROMAN PROVINCE OF DACIA
(Endre Tóth) Settlements and Urbanization
The Long War, and Renewal in the Severan Era
When, in the middle of the 2nd century, Gothic tribes in the northwest began to migrate in a southeasterly direction, people on the borders of the empire, in the northern half of the Carpathian Basin reacted with mounting alarm. The outcome was a terrible, fifteen-year long war. In their quest for a new home, the Germanic tribes Goths, Langobards (Lombards), and Vandals — ultimately confronted Marcomanni, Quads, Jazyges, and Costoboci. For the latter groups, the empire's frontier was a wall that blocked escape or resettlement. Notwithstanding the occasional clash, relations between Rome and these long-established neighbours were generally peaceful and mutually beneficial, complete with alliances — to be sure, on terms dictated by the stronger party. Rome's aid consisted primarily of regular or occasional subsidies, in exchange for which the Barbarians provided military support as the need arose. In order to retain the initiative and forestall the formation of hostile coalitions, Rome forged a system of bilateral alliances. This strategy, nurtured over two centuries, succeeded in mitigating the threat of the Barbarian tribes, who lived in a broad swath along the empire's borders. When the tribes quarrelled, they often sought Rome's help or mediation. Rome's influence grew to the point that tribes would seek her permission and assistance to migrate and resettle even in areas external to the empire.
{1-86.} The Danubian region's defenses were weakened when, in 162, Marcus Aurelius had to transfer troops from the peripheral provinces, including Dacia, to fight in the Parthian War, which had broken out the previous year. As tensions mounted in the Carpathian basin, Roman governors negotiated skilfully to slow down escalation of the conflict, thus delaying by several years the outbreak of war. The prolonged negotiations revealed that the neighbouring peoples wanted to avoid war; citing the alliance commitments, they besieged Rome with requests for assistance and for a new home within the empire. (Another option, aired during the war, was to help the Marcomanni and Sarmatians defend their existing homes and turn their land into new provinces.) Disappointed with the dilatory nature of the talks and Rome's inability or unwillingness to give help, the Barbarians joined forces to wage war against the empire. However, the first attack, on Pannonia, came from new arrivals, the Germanic Langobardi and Obii. Luckily for the empire, war on the Danubian front erupted only in 167, by which time the Roman expeditionary force had returned from the Parthian War — bringing back a severe plague epidemic.
Apparently, war reached northern Dacia after 167: the last date found in the Tibód (Tibodu) treasure is 167, and that on the wax tablets (which were also hidden when an enemy attack seemed imminent) is 29 May 167. The onset of war prompted a series of administrative and military measures in Dacia, but information is too sparse to allow reconstruction of the sequence of events over the short, three-year period. Taken in the midst of military emergency, the initial measures were probably soon superseded by new ones. In late 167 or 168, the V Macedonica legion, which had returned to Troesmis after the Parthian campaign, was transferred to a camp at Potaissa (Torda, Turda), in northern Dacia; the location indicates that the military command anticipated an attack on Transylvania. Meanwhile, sometime between 167 and 170, Dacia's {1-87.} administrative structure was modified. The two-legion province once again came to be governed by a senator and former consul, replacing a governor of praetor rank. Administration of Dacia's three parts was consolidated under a single governor, who bore the title of legatus Augusti pro praetore Daciarum trium (governor of the three Daciae); the procurators of knightly rank who had ruled over the three parts were reduced to looking after economic matters. At the same time, two Dacian provinces were renamed after towns, as had happened with Dacia Porolissensis: Superior became Apulensis, and Inferior, Malvensis (after a town yet to be identified). Although the legion camp at Potaissa was attached to Dacia Apulensis, there is no concrete evidence of major boundary changes at this time. The renaming of the provinces reflected the equal status of the three parts under a single governor and did not necessarily signify territorial modifications.
Military activity reached its peak in the same period, between 167–170. Undeterred by the epidemic, Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus Caesar both travelled to the Danubian provinces, the latter probably to the battlefronts in Moesia and Dacia. Dacia, being exposed to attack on three sides, was particularly difficult to defend; and since Dacia could not halt all the attacks, the two Moesiae also came under heavy pressure from the Barbarians. Rome

dispatched several excellent officers to serve as governors and proconsuls, and some fell in battle, notably M. Claudius Fronto, who became governor of Moesia Superior in 167. In order to hold back Jazyges attacking across the Banat, Dacia's western front and Moesia Superior were administratively merged so that a single governor could direct operations by the two provinces military forces. Fronto thus acted as governor of both Dacia Apulensis and Moesia Inferior in 168; shortly thereafter, he was named governor of the Tres Daciae. Later, when Moesia Superior's army suffered a defeat, in the course of which its governor was killed, the province was attached to Dacia. The powerful offensive of combined {1-88.} Sarmatian and German forces made the military situation critical. According to the epigraph on the memorial that was raised to Fronto at Trajan's Forum, in Rome, the governor, 'after successfully fighting several battles against the Germans and Jazyges, fell in the midst of his courageous combat for the state'.[32] Another memorial honouring his accomplishments was raised at Sarmizegethusa.[33] That town also raised a memorial to Marcus Aurelius, thanking him — according to the inscription — for sending troops to save it from a great peril.[34]
Clearly, there was heavy fighting in northern and western Dacia, but no information survives regarding developments on the eastern front. It is unlikely that major battles were fought there, for the enemy's main offensive was aimed southward. Skirting Dacia, the Costoboci and Sarmatians invaded Moesia Inferior and advanced south as far as Achaia, plundering the shrines at Eleusis. They were finally defeated in 171 or 172 by Cornelius Clemens, consularis et dux trium Daciarum, who was helped by one of the Vandal tribes, the Hasdingi.[35] Rome was thus resorting to diplomatic devices to extricate itself from a critical situation. Similarly, 'a neighbouring tribal leader, Tarbus, who went to Dacia demanding annual financial aid and threatened war if his demand was not granted'[36] was dissuaded by Rome's allies. By then, Rome was allowing certain tribes to settle in Pannonia, Moesia, and Germania, as well as in Dacia; clearly, at least some of the warring Barbarians simply wished to settle behind safe borders. In later years, Rome held the military initiative and pursued the enemy on the latter's territory. When they made peace, the Jazyges returned 100,000 prisoners of war to the Romans. Eventually, Marcus Aurelius gave them permission to establish contact — across Dacia — with the eastern Roxolani, subject to the concurrence of the province's governor.[37]
The conflict had spread into the region north of Dacia, where Roman combatants included the I Italica legion from Moesia {1-89.} Inferior. Around 180, Emperor Commodus, the son of Marcus Aurelius, waged war in this region, principally against the Buri. The campaign was successful, for 'when the Buri became exhausted, a treaty was made with them and [Commodus] took away hostages as well the 15,000 prisoners-of-war. He had the rest of the Buri swear that they would not settle or graze their animals within forty stadia [approx. 7 km] of Dacia's borders. And Sabinianus offered land in our Dacia to 12,000 Dacians living beyond the border'.[38]
By the end of the long war, Rome had rebuilt its network of alliances along the border of the empire. However, Germans had begun to settle on the northern approaches to Dacia, and fighting would flare up again. There is mention in Commodus' biography of a defeat of the free Dacians. These conflicts, like the earlier ones, were triggered off by the arrival of the Goths, who were progressively moving towards the Black Sea. The turbulence of the era is attested by the many finds of buried coins east of the Carpathians, in Ukraine. Tribes that were driven back by the Goths frequently warred against Rome. Dacia's northwestern and western frontiers must have remained relatively calm: finds in Sarmatian-Jazyge areas of Roman export goods and coins indicate that the trade between Romans and Sarmatians — sanctioned originally by Marcus Aurelius — enjoyed a revival.
During Commodus's reign, unrest and disturbances were rife among the people of Dacia. The causes were many: fifteen years of devastating war, the plague, the inadequacies of military defence and public security, the slow pace of reconstruction, economic difficulties, and progress toward urban self-government that was slower than in other provinces. It is briefly noted in the Emperor's biography that a local revolt broke out in Dacia around 185.[39] There is no indication that indigenous Dacians participated in the insurrection. Similar turbulence shook Germania. In Dacia, the multiple grievances may have been exacerbated by the fact that the {1-90.} population was ethnically fragmented and socially unintegrated. It was possibly during Commodus' reign that the Dacian legions were rewarded for their loyalty with emblems inscribed 'pia fidelis, pia constans'; the legion based at Apulum raised a statue in honour of Commodus.[40]
Commodus was assassinated in 192. In March 193, at Carnuntum (Deutschaltenburg, Austria), the Pannonian governor, Septimius Severus, was proclaimed Emperor by his legions. The Dacian army (along with those of the

other Danubian provinces) rallied to the new Emperor, who named his brother governor of the province. In the ensuing civil war, Dacian troops helped Septimius Severus to prevail over his rivals. The province would thereafter benefit from the Emperor's goodwill, as well as from peaceful conditions that favoured economic development. The main evidence of Dacia's reconstruction lies in the growing level of urbanization: Severus granted autonomy to three towns, and raised another to the status of colonia. It is probably during his reign that several Dacian towns were granted the privilege of ius Italicum, a property law that exempted the recipients from land tax. This extraordinary privilege, seldom granted in other provinces, was designed to encourage settlement in Dacia. References to merchants — many of them Syrians — in contemporary epigraphs became more numerous. A provincial council was set up, as was a central organization for the Emperor's cult. A detailed account of Dacia's revival during the reign of Severus must await further archaeological finds and analysis. There is evidence, however, that the revival touched Transylvania much more than the rest of Dacia. This may be accounted for by the region's large military establishment (two legions, as well as auxiliary units), which was the principal beneficiary of the period's prosperity. The development and expansion of towns may have been the consequence of an active policy; this is suggested not by archaeological data but architectural details (decorated ledges, capitals, statues) that survive from Sarmizegethusa and Apulum.
{1-91.} Thus, in the time of the Severus emperors, the consolidation of Dacia's internal security was belatedly promoted by a series of measures and privileges. The population's gratitude is attested by numerous epigraphs, honouring Septimius Severus and his son, Caracalla, in Sarmizegethusa, Micia, Ampelum, Apulum and Germisara.
Dacia remained free of foreign attacks during Septimius Severus' reign. Damage caused by the long war to military camps was repaired; where this had not been done before, defenses were rebuilt in stone, and some experts believe that the Limes Transalutanus was constructed in this period. The first recurrence of war, in 212–213, apparently only touched northern Transylvania: the attackers were probably free Dacians, Carpi, and Vandals. When peace returned, Caracalla visited Dacia, then headed with his armies to the eastern end of the empire.
In 218, following Caracalla's assassination, the free Dacians 'laid waste part of Dacia and had the impudence of retrieving the hostages who had been taken by Caracalla in keeping with the peace treaty'.[41] Few epigraphs remain in Dacia dating from the time of the last Severus emperor, Alexander (222–235); in keeping with the cult of the emperor, the army displayed its loyalty by erecting in its camps epigraphic tributes to Alexander and his mother, Iulia Mammaea.

3. THE ROMAN PROVINCE OF DACIA
(Endre Tóth) Commerce and the Economy: the First Growth Phase
The Road Network
Judging from the milestone erected at Ajtony in 109 or 110 A.D., the construction of military roads began immediately after Dacia's occupation and was probably completed by the time of the province's reorganization, in 118. The Tabula Peutingeriana, a map drawn in the mid-200s, indicates the roads and distances between the settlements, most of them military camps. The concordance of ancient and modern place-names is often difficult to establish, for only a few traces of the road network have been discovered so far.
The Tabula traces roads leading from the two bridges on the Danube and from Dierna to Apulum and the northern borders of Dacia. The roads from Lederata and Dierna merged at Tibiscum, then proceeded through Sarmizegethusa to Apulum; before Apulum, a road branched off to head down the Maros valley toward Pannonia. A third road from the Danube, not marked in the Tabula, linked the Drobeta bridge to Sarmizegethusa by way of the Vulkán pass in the Carpathians. Another road, linking Drobeta and Apulum, headed east to the Olt River, then north along the fortified {1-74.} line before crossing the Vöröstorony pass and reaching the capital. Certain sections of this road are still clearly visible along the Olt. The Tabula indicates only one road running north from Apulum; it leads to Porolissum.
The road network in the Tabula connected strategically important river crossings with the provincial capital and the northern frontier. Since the army had left eastern Dacia by the time the map was drawn, there is little information on roads in that region. The Geographus Ravennas, which is based on the Tabula Peutingeriana and other early maps, does indicate a road in eastern Transylvania which linked Porolissum to the Black Sea; this may be part of the otherwise untraced highway to Barbaricum that was opened by Emperor Trajan.[27]
However, another road into Barbaricum, the link between Dacia and Pannonia Inferior, is well-known. It forked off the Tibiscum-Apulum road at the mouth of the Sztrigy and ran west along the Maros valley, soon reaching the westernmost defence installation in the valley at Micia (Vecel). It continued beyond the borders of Dacia, following the Maros to its junction with the Tisza, then crossing the plain between the Tisza and the Danube in the direction of Pannonia Inferior. The path along the river is not mapped, but evidence of the road and its military defence is offered by bricks bearing military seals (as well as traces of buildings that await archaeological study) found in the neighbourhood of Arad (Aradul Nou) and at Bulcs (Bulci), Nagyszentmiklós (Sînnicolaul Mare), and Németcsanád (Cenadul German). The discovery in the Danube-Tisza area of a 50-kilometre stretch of earthworks, some 5–6 metres high, demonstrates conclusively that a road ran across the Barbaricum to link the provinces of Dacia and Pannonia Inferior. This section runs from the Baja district towards Szeged, and it is still visible in the vicinity of Csávoly, Mélykút, Tompa, and Kelebia; its path is clearly an extension of the road along the Maros. The road facilitated westward travel and communication between Dacia and Pannonia.
{1-75.} The date of construction of the Roman road along the Maros has yet to be ascertained. This highway linked Apulum and central Dacia with Pannonia Inferior. It gave access, by way of the Danube River and its parallel limes road, to the empire's western provinces, and to southern Pannonia and Dalmatia by way of the Maros, Tisza, Danube, Drava, and Sava rivers. Beyond that lay the link, through the commercial hub of Aquileia, with the socalled Amber Road connecting northern Italy and the North Sea. The flow of commerce along the Maros valley road is shown by the spread of numerous southern Pannonian products in Dacia, particularly its Transylvanian region, and by the merchants' trading posts. The Maros valley facilitated not only road traffic but, since pre-Roman times, river traffic as well; this is attested by the reference to a shipmasters' association (collegium nautarum) in Apulum[28] as well as by a sailor's tombstone at Micia.
Since the road crossed Jazyge-inhabited areas, it had to be provided with military protection. Of this, little evidence survives, but finds in the Maros valley of bricks produced in the legions' brickworks indicate that the road and the stations along it were constructed by legion detachments. The stretch between the Danube and the Tisza was presumably guarded by the army of Pannonia Inferior. The road took a southwesterly turn at Baja, and

probably crossed the Danube near the military camp at Lugio (Dunaszekcső).
The finds of military significance along the Maros have a bearing on the questions of Dacia's southwestern border and the status of the Banat. There is broad agreement on the tracing — if not on the relevant dates — of much of Dacia's frontier. However, there was no need for a continuous line of camps and earthworks in the more mountainous stretches, and thus opinions differ as to the precise extent of the province in certain areas, notably the Banat, which lies between the Danube, Tisza, and Maros rivers.
According to one interpretation, the military finds along the Maros testify to a fortified frontier, and thus the Banat must have {1-76.} been part of the Roman province of Dacia. On the other hand, archaeological finds in the Banat do not support this hypothesis, for they reveal traces of military camps only in the eastern part, north of Lederata, along the road to Tibiscum. If the Banat had been part of the empire, there would have been lines of camps along the Tisza and the Maros, yet there is no sign of such fortification; the finds along the Maros are remnants of Roman military outposts that protected the highway. Roman finds do not automatically indicate that a territory was ruled by Rome: whether as booty or through trade, many Roman objects reached Pannonia's northern approaches, inhabited by Marcomanni and Quadi, as well as Sarmatian Barbaricum, yet no one claims that these areas belonged to the empire. In any case, there are no significant Roman traces in the western Banat; the few inscribed fragments found along the Maros and in the Banat (as well as in the region between the Danube and the Tisza) could easily have come from construction material brought from Dacia in the Middle Ages. The fact that the Maros road does not figure in the Tabula also indicates that it fell beyond the boundaries of the empire.
A related, contentious issue is the identity of the Banat's inhabitants. If all Banat had been part of Dacia, then no Sarmatians could have lived there prior to 271, when the Romans relinquished the province. Because of this assumption, Sarmatian finds are generally dated from the end of the 3rd century or later. However, several archaeological excavations indicate the presence of Sarmatians well before that date; the finds include enamelled brooches traded by the Romans to the Sarmatians. The frequency of Sarmatian finds increases as one moves from the southeastern part of the Banat towards the Tisza and its junction with the Maros. They clearly attest to the presence of Sarmatian Jazyges and indicate that — at least after the reorganization of 118 — the westerly, and major part of the Banat was in the hands not of Romans but of Sarmatians.
{1-77.} There has also been speculation that other roads, in addition to the Apulum-Lugio link, connected Porolissum in Dacia with Aquincum in Pannonia Inferior. Yet no trace remains, and it is unlikely that they ever existed. The highway that ran along the Maros valley and through the Danube-Tisza triangle gave the Romans easy access and rendered unnecessary the construction across Sarmatian territory of another road; the latter would have been much longer, more vulnerable to attack, and — given the multiple river crossings, forests, and marshes — difficult to build. It is, of course, entirely possible that there existed a rough path across the region, used by the Sarmatians.
The peaceable period that followed the reorganization of 118 favoured Dacia's economic development. For almost two decades, no major wars erupted in the region. Sources make only vague references to a Dacian menace during Antoninus Pius' reign (138–161). The danger came from the so-called free Dacians, who originally inhabited, or had fled to territories north and east of the province, as well as from the Carpi and the Costoboci. The absence of detailed information of the battles suggests that a major war was not anticipated at the time. In a biography of Antoninus Pius[29] there is brief mention that the Emperor, aided by his governors and legates, defeated the Germans, the Dacians, and other peoples, including Jewish rebels. The Dacian war can be dated by the addition, in 157, of the triumphal epithet 'Dacicus' to the Emperor's name. And indeed, in 156–158, two excellent soldiers, Statius Priscus and Macrinius Vindex, were serving as governors in Dacia Superior and Dacia Porolissensis, respectively. The armies in the two provinces were evidently not strong enough to repel the attacks, for they had to be reinforced with Moorish auxiliary troops from Africa. Although evidence of the war can be found only in Dacia Superior, reinforcements were sent to Dacia Inferior as well. The turbulence on the middle and lower reaches of the Danube was but a prelude to the long war that was to engulf the region a few years later.

Transylvania in the Decade of Disintegration
1. FROM THE EASTERN HUNGARIAN KINGDOM TO THE PRINCIPALITY OF TRANSYLVANIA
Downfall and Renewal
{1-606.} The Prelude to Transylvanian Statehood
The events of 1536–37 confirmed that neither of the contending factions in Hungary could prevail. King John crowned his successes in Transylvania at the beginning of 1536 (in Szeben and Szatmár) by occupying Kassa at the end of the year. Ferdinand launched a two-pronged offensive in 1537, but the results were close to catastrophic for him. After initial successes in Upper Hungary, Leonhard Vels' troops were halted at Tokaj. Meanwhile, on the Drava, an army of close to 40,000, led by Hans Katzianer, fought the biggest battle in Hungary since Mohács (and until that of Mezőkeresztes, in 1596); the victor was a comparatively small Turkish force under the bey of Bosnia and Szendrő.
After eleven years of promises, threats, and warfare, the Habsburg King's resolve began to flag. King John, for his part, had been toying for years with the option of a pact acknowledging the division of the country. The emperor sent delegates to the negotiations, which began at the end of 1537. At most of the meetings, Szapolyai was represented by György Fráter, who gave his sovereign the loyalty and support that John had vainly expected from Gritti. The Pauline friar was not only bishop of Várad but also the king's treasurer, and he soon put the royal finances in order. By taking responsibility for the necessary fiscal measures, as well as for the controversial negotiations on the country's division, he lightened the king's burden of unpopularity.
The peace treaty was signed on 24 February 1538, at Nagyvárad, by representatives of John I, Ferdinand I, and Charles V. According to its terms, the two monarchs recognized each other's sovereignty over the part of Hungary that they already controlled. Moreover, John agreed that, after his death, his realm would revert to the House of Habsburg, with the proviso that if he fathered an heir, Ferdinand would grant the latter a principality in the Szepesség and its vicinity.
{1-607.} Both parties considered that the merit of this treaty lay in the promise that the country would eventually be reunified. A few doubted John's sincerity, and questioned the value of an agreement in which one side surrendered a part of the country he did not control, while the other offered in return a non-existent principality.
Within a few months, the sceptics were vindicated. Suspecting that the sultan would disapprove, the contracting parties kept the treaty secret and counted on Charles V to rescue Hungary in case of need. However, the emperor, who had just concluded a peace — which proved to be short-lived — with the French, was disposed to confront the Ottomans only in the Mediterranean. When, in the autumn of 1538, the sultan launched an offensive in Europe, everyone believed that his target was Hungary. John called upon his new allies for help, but all that they provided, after some delay, was a few thousand mercenaries. Although the king's fears turned out to be premature Suleiman was satisfied to expel Petru Rareş and extend suzerainty over Wallachia and Moldavia — he was forced to draw the appropriate conclusions. Whatever his expectations at Nagyvárad, John now adopted a policy that clearly contravened the treaty.
György Fráter boldly pursued his difficult task. In early 1539, Ferdinand demanded that the Nagyvárad compromise be made public. The bishop-treasurer categorically rejected the request. Moreover, although the treaty required that those privy to it swear to abide by the terms, the friar prevented John's followers from complying, provoking the ire of many aristocrats and of those lesser noblemen who were well-informed. The ever-optimistic chancellor, Werbőczy, firmly believed that the peace treaty would reunify his country; he protested in the royal council and sought contacts with the Viennese court.
John's supporters and opponents debated the merits of György Fráter's manoeuvres, but the king reproved the dissenters and proceeded to take a step that would have far-reaching consequences. {1-608.} He had been seeking a wife, and his choice fell on Isabella, the younger daughter of his former brother-in-law, the elderly Polish king Sigismund I.



The Prelude to Transylvanian Statehood
https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/101.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:33:23]
Had he taken the Nagyvárad Treaty seriously, John would have seen that it was in his interest to stay unmarried. However, the ensuing events gave him reason to regard the agreement as little more than a provisional cease-fire, which he could exploit to gain time and rebuild his forces. He probably also believed — again, with some justification — that his realm needed the preservation of his Turcophile rule. Being over fifty years of age, he calculated that he should produce a son and heir, in whose name the treaty could be challenged.
The royal wedding was celebrated on 2 March 1539, at Székesfehérvár. Isabella, who was barely twenty, soon became pregnant. More and more people came to realize that the king and the bishop-treasurer were preparing to break the treaty.
At this point, Transylvania once again came to play a role in Hungary's affairs. Under the influence of the warscare of 1538, local aristocrats began secretly to organize. Their activity was directed by the voivode István Maylád, who had been appointed in 1534; his deputy, Imre Balassa, took over the post in 1536 but remained more aloof. Little is known about the aims of the 'conspirators', but one thing is clear: they wanted to detach Transylvania from Hungary, and thus shelter the province from the growing risk of a Turkish offensive. Maylád, who allegedly was of Romanian extraction, was the first Transylvanian-born, aristocratic landowner since many years to hold the post of voivode. The initiative drew a positive response from the province's nobility, including prominent aristocrats such as Ferenc Kendi, King John's treasurer. Part of the province's ruling elite reached for autonomous power to defend their vested interests.
In pursuit of their goal, Maylád and his associates sought contact with both the Ottomans and the Germans. There are indications {1-609.} that they even held talks with the feudal lords of the Austrian and Bohemian provinces. Their efforts produced dismal results. The Ottomans would not deign to speak to them. Ferdinand was prepared to offer his support only if they became his agents. As for Szapolyai, when he got wind of the initiatives, he moved quickly to take forceful reprisals.
The centuries-old tradition of Hungary's ruling elite to draw together was difficult to challenge. Nor was it easy to foresee how an autonomous Transylvania would fare in the political chaos that prevailed in the Danubian region. In such circumstances, it is scarcely surprising that this uncertain enterprise collapsed as soon as King John's forces appeared on the scene. Most of the plotters begged for mercy and were pardoned, leaving Maylád to retrench himself in Fogaras. At the end of May, Bálint Török and András Báthori laid siege to Fogaras, but they lacked the time to complete the task.
John I was already ailing when he entered Transylvania, and his health continued to deteriorate. He lived long enough to receive the happy news on 10 July, at his encampment in Szászváros: Isabella had given birth to a healthy son three days earlier at Buda. The delighted king rode out among his troops, but he suffered a malaise that evening, and, after nearly two weeks of agony, expired.
György Fráter was left with the formidable challenge of forestalling, in the name of an infant crown-prince, the disintegration of Szapolyai's realm. He set to the task with his accustomed energy, rushing to Buda to have a hastily-convened diet elect Szapolyai's son, John Sigismund, king. The bishop could scarcely prevent aristocrats who insisted on respect for the Treaty of Nagyvárad from shifting their allegiance; they included, in Hungary, Ferenc Frangepán and Péter Perényi, and, in Transylvania, István Maylád and Imre Balassa. However, the Fráter — assisted by his fellow royal guardians, Bálint Török and Péter Petrovics — managed to stave off disaster by repelling an attack on Buda led by Ferdinand's {1-610.} trustworthy old general, Leonhard Vels. Central Hungary thus remained under the control of the bishop; he dispatched the chancellor, Werbőczy, to Istanbul with the request that the sultan afford recognition and succour to the infant king.
Suleiman did not hesitate to reassure his anxious supporters, and in October 1540, the elderly chancellor reported: 'I can inform your lordships that after we had refuted our opponents' arguments, and thanks to the Good Lord's help, the almighty sultan responded according to our desires to all our proposals.'[3]
However, matters soon took a very different turn at the Sublime Porte, for no sooner had Werbőczy departed than Ferdinand I's envoy, Hieronym Łaski, arrived in Istanbul. In order to win the sultan's acquiescence to Habsburg rule in Hungary, he gave a detailed account of the Nagyvárad negotiations. The Habsburgs' diplomatic efforts were probably based on the double premise that the Hungarian ruling elite resented the country's division and that those

https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/101.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:33:23]
who opposed Vienna could persist only because they enjoyed the support of the Ottomans. Therefore, if the sultan could be manoeuvred into breaking with his onetime supporters, Szapolyai's followers would have no choice but to offer their allegiance to Ferdinand. It was in the interest of the Austrian and Bohemian provinces that their dangerous neighbour, Turcophile Hungary, should cease to exist. The flaw in this stratagem was the assumption that the 'Hungarian problem' could be solved without the involvement of Turkish power, and without inviting Turkish retaliation.
In fact, the sultan became incensed not so much by the story of past betrayals as by the evident unreliability of his Hungarian allies. He had no intention of putting at risk the results of fifteen years of expansion, notably his gains in Hungary. Łaski was put under arrest, and when he was released a year later, he was terminally ill; meanwhile, the Ottomans made preparations for a new Danubian offensive.
{1-611.} In May 1541, Ferdinand's troops once again laid siege to Buda. By the time the Ottomans' advance guard drew near, General Roggendorff and Péter Perényi were already considering the option of withdrawal, for György Fráter and his companions had been defending the capital with steadfast heroism. They drowned in blood a conspiracy organized by burghers in Buda and supported by Queen Isabella, who was totally befuddled by the political chaos and only wished to escape.
At the end of July, the attacking army was decimated in a series of ill-advised rearguard actions, and the siege collapsed. By the time Suleiman arrived, the enemy had departed from Buda. The size of the Turkish relief force made György Fráter, Bálint Török, and Péter Petrovics apprehensive, but they could scarcely afford to offend the sultan, for Buda could not have withstood another siege. On 29 August, the fifteenth anniversary of the defeat at Mohács, the Hungarian leaders left for the sultan's camp to pay their respects; in their absence, Turkish janissaries arrived to do some 'sightseeing' and occupied Buda. The sultan had Bálint Török put in chains and advised György Fráter that in exchange for an annual tribute of 10,000 forints, he would allow King John's son to rule over Transylvania and the region east of the Tisza.
This painful turn in Hungary's history was one step on the way to the creation of a Transylvanian state. Buda having become the seat of a sanjak, Fráter escorted Isabella and the young John Sigismund to Lippa. Memories of this sad affair would haunt the Hungarian protagonists, and György Fráter was frequently overcome by remorse, but there was no time for lamentation.
The year 1541 brought new and ominous signs of the Ottomans' expansionism, and also of the Habsburgs' weakness and inability to engage in effective military action in Hungary. Thus the political vice that had gripped Hungary since 1529–32 stayed. The loss of Buda was distressing, although the Ottomans proposed that the earlier 'alliance' be renewed — on only slightly stricter terms — {1-612.} with respect to what remained of Szapolyai's realm. The more realistic Hungarians could draw some comfort from the fact that the autonomous remnant of their country was no longer caught between the Turkish and Habsburg spheres of interest.
On the way to Lippa, György Fráter had to endure the reproaches of a despairing Isabella and of Hungarian aristocrats, but he was already drawing up plans for the most urgent measures. His first priority was to secure the regions assigned to him by the Ottomans. He exercised authority over the region east of the Tisza, particularly over its central part, Bihar county, and over Szapolyai's Lippa-Solymos domain in the southern district. In Transylvania, the Ottomans themselves took measures to debilitate the opposition. Moldavian and Turkish forces drove István Maylád back to Fogaras castle, then, on 20 July — before the fall of Buda — they ensnared him into a trap. The restless aristocrat joined Bálint Török in lifelong captivity. Transylvania's 'three nations' had no choice but to accommodate themselves to the new circumstances. On 18 October 1541, Fráter convened a diet in Debrecen, the first conference to draw together the feudal leaders of the future Transylvanian Principality — representing the counties, the Székelys, and the Saxons — and the nobles of the region east of the Tisza. Predictably, the diet proclaimed its loyalty to the House of Szapolyai.
The harmony proved to be short-lived, for the participants were separated by geography, traditions, and the earlier administrative divisions, and they were not keen to meet again. Still, the diet provided a legal basis for Fráter's government. A Transylvanian national assembly, held on 20 January 1542 at Marosvásárhely, acknowledged him as the province's governor (helytartó). A second assembly, convened in late March at Torda, invited Queen Isabella and her son to establish residence in the province; it further decided to assign to the queen and the

governor twenty-two councillors, representing the three nations.
{1-613.} György Fráter realized that, in the circumstances, Transylvania was best suited to serve as the political centre of the reduced realm. Giovanni Statileo, bishop of Transylvania and one of King John's leading diplomats, had died recently. That summer, Fráter and Isabella moved into the episcopal palace at Gyulafehérvár, and the governor took over the vast episcopal estates (including Gyulafehérvár, Diód, Almás, and Gyalu). They did not appoint a new Transylvanian bishop.
These state-building efforts did not proceed undisturbed. The loss of Buda caused great fright among the Austrian and Bohemian feudal estates, and this helped Ferdinand I to muster forces for a counter-attack. Since the German empire also offered assistance, expectations were rife that the offensive, planned for summer 1542, would expel the Ottomans. The scale of the preparations induced Fráter to caution. Not wanting to be on the wrong side in case the Habsburgs prevailed, he sought once again to parley with Ferdinand. On 29 December 1541, negotiators at Gyalu castle reached a tentative agreement that evoked the Nagyvárad Treaty: Hungary would be united under the Habsburgs' rule, and, in compensation, the Szapolyai family would receive Szepes castle and its dependencies.
The bishop-treasurer's caution proved to be well-founded. Although Ferdinand managed to throw into battle more than 50,000 men, the campaign of 1542 ended in disaster. After a few days of fighting around Pest, the Christian army effected a withdrawal, then virtually disintegrated.
The troubles did not end there. In July 1542, before Ferdinand's ill-fated campaign, Francis I, King of France, had once again declared war on Charles V, drawing away the empire's military forces. In 1543, the sultan sent his garrison in Hungary on the offensive, and even this modest threat was more than the isolated Ferdinand could handle; by the end of the year, Valpó, Siklós, Pécs, Esztergom, Tata, and Székesfehérvár had fallen to the Ottomans. In {1-614.} 1544, the Ottomans captured Visegrád, Nógrád, and Hatvan, creating a defensive ring around Buda.
At the end of 1544, Charles V secured yet another provisional truce with the French, but Ferdinand I decided to abandon his obviously hopeless quest. On 10 November 1545, at Adrianople, his envoys negotiated a cease-fire, leaving Hungary to her fate.
In these circumstances, the Szapolyai monarchy could hardly uphold the terms of the Gyalu agreement. The sultan took pains to impress on the Gyulafehérvár court which side was the stronger. In late 1542, Petru Rareş, who had regained his Moldavian throne, acted on Istanbul's instructions and raided Transylvania. Fráter managed to stop the Moldavians, but the defeat of the Habsburg army at Pest confirmed the validity of his reservations about the agreement, which in the meantime had been made public.
On 20 December 1542, the Transylvanian diet reconvened at Torda and passed several resolutions. It confirmed the union of the 'three nations'; overrode the Saxons' protests and abrogated the Gyalu agreement; acknowledged John Sigismund ('John II, Hungary's elected king') as the province's sovereign; advised Ferdinand I that if he was unable to protect them, he should at least let them take care of themselves; and, finally, agreed to pay the tribute demanded by the Ottomans. In early 1543, 10,000 forints, the first tribute ever paid by Transylvania, were delivered to the Sublime Porte. The battles that took place in 1543–44 confirmed the wisdom of Fráter's decision to persist in defending the interests of the House of Szapolyai.
The clarification of Hungary's foreign relations went hand in hand with the domestic consolidation of the new leadership. Beginning with the acquisition of the Gyulafehérvár episcopal estates, the number of fiscal domains in Transylvania grew steadily. Fráter retrieved Déva and Görgény from the onetime captain-general, Boldizsár Bornemissza; in reward for his services, the latter received Küküllő castle, recently the property of Petru Rareş. {1615.} The Maylád family was momentarily allowed to retain Fogaras, but Katalin Nádasdy, the wife of István Maylád (captive in Istanbul) was obliged to submit in all matters to the authority of Isabella and the governor.
The central authority's power was enhanced by the Kővár estates, in north-eastern Transylvania and by a fortress, erected by György Fráter, close by in the Szamos valley. Only a few Transylvanian estates' domains remained in the hands of local aristocrats. János Török of Enying acquired Vajdahunyad, and the ambitious Kendi family took over Marosvécs. To forestall further incursions, Csicsó was returned to Petru Rareş, but only after the castle had been torn down.



The Prelude to Transylvanian Statehood

The extension of state authority over the region east of the Tisza took longer, and brought different results. At this time, the eastern Hungarian Kingdom encompassed the counties of Máramaros, Szabolcs, Szatmár, KözépSzolnok, Bihar, Outer-Szolnok, Békés, Csongrád, Arad, and Csanád, as well as the Temesköz. Várad and Lippa were important centres of state power, guaranteing predominance over the region's magnates. For all practical purposes, Péter Petrovics was the absolute ruler of the Temesköz, but shared political goals and his loyalty to the Szapolyai family led him to cooperate with György Fráter. There were other districts ruled as private fiefs: the area from Máramaros to Kraszna by the Drágffy-Perényi family and the Báthoris of Ecsed and Somlyó; Békés by the Patócsy; the Maros valley by the Jaksics family; and Debrecen by the Török family of Enying. In the undefined border zones of Zemplén, Borsod, and Abaúj counties, the Balassa, Losonci, Bebek families, and the Drugeths of Homonna ruled with considerable autonomy.
In these circumstances, it is scarcely surprising that the region would come to challenge Fráter's authority, particularly amidst the uncertainties of 1542. In a region where the authority and traditions of the Hungarian state had only a slight impact, the local lords felt {1-616.} freer to make overtures to the Habsburgs. Habsburg defeat at Pest dampened their enthusiasm; at the Derecske diet, convened in late 1542, they acceded to György Fráter's request that they share the burden of paying tribute to the Ottomans. The military campaigns of 1543–44 left only one secure road link to Habsburg Hungary, along the Vág valley, and this further reduced the ranks of Habsburg supporters. As a result, only András Báthori of Ecsed and Kristóf Hagymásy, the castellan of Huszt, managed to preserve a certain independence. In August 1544, delegates from counties along the Tisza and in the region east of the Tisza participated as equals in the Transylvanian diet at Torda. With the entrenchment of this practice, the Transylvanian diet became the legal successor of the Hungarian diets.
Over time, property relations changed to the benefit of the friar-governor. In the queen's name, he summarily appropriated Nagylak (the seat of the Jaksics family), Csanád (the episcopal see), and the Várday family's main estate, at Kisvárda. When Gáspár Drágffy died, the family's vast estates reverted to his only son, a minor; in his capacity as the boy's guardian, Fráter laid hands on Tasnád, Erdőd, and Valkó, all important assets.
The diet of Eastern Hungary reconvened on 24 April 1545 at Torda. News of the Habsburg-Ottoman peace talks had just reached Transylvania, and György Fráter considered the moment opportune to consolidate the political system. At his request, the diet abrogated the rights that had been left — at least nominally — to Ferdinand: the power to grant property and ultimate judicial authority. It recognized John Sigismund as King John II of Hungary and prohibited his subjects from pursuing contacts with foreign powers, including Pozsony (Bratislava) and Vienna.
Fráter did suffer one setback: the diet refused to name him governor. To encourage the feudal estates in this step, Queen Isabella had evoked the precedent of Gritti. This minor clash between the queen and the mighty regent owed partly to the deterioration {1-617.} in their relations during 1540–41, but it also reflected the imbalance inherent in the political system.
As a regent and royal treasurer, Fráter exercised total control over the state's finances and crown properties. To serve these ends, a new administrative structure had to be created. Until 1541, Transylvania had been administered by the central organs of the Hungarian Kingdom, but the chancellery and high court had vanished in the political chaos of 1540–41: the expert clerks, jurists, and notaries were scattered, most of them ending up in the service of Ferdinand. As for the local apparatus of Transylvania's voivode, it was wholly inadequate to the task of administering a state. Thus György Fráter had no choice but to form a new administrative structure staffed by people, trained in law, drawn from Transylvania and other places. This single, all-purpose chancellery played no role in policy-making; only the judicial administrators enjoyed a certain — highly restricted — latitude in their sphere. There was no question of appointing a chancellor: the regent exercised direct control over his administrators, isolating the latter from Isabella's influence. As noted, in early 1542, the Transylvanians took an initiative in favour of elected councillors, but György Fráter blocked all such attempts. The provision for elected councils was never put into practice.
The feudal estates lost much of their influence over the affairs of state. Unwilling to alter their pro-Habsburg sympathies, the Saxons adopted a passive stance. Péter Haller, the royal magistrate at Szeben, was just about the only Saxon with direct access to the court at Gyulafehérvár, where he continued to be regarded as a member of the

opposition. The Székelys could occasionally defend their interests at meetings of the diet, but they had few advocates, if any, in the circles around the regent and the queen. This was all the more striking since the late King John's 'familiars' — mostly men of modest means who had no roots within the new confines of the country — and their relatives were found in great numbers {1-618.} amongst the senior officials and courtiers; they included Ferenc Kőrösy, Benedek Bajoni, Gábor Pesti, István Maticsnai, Antal Verancsics, János Glésán, and Orbán Batthyány.
The major landowning aristocrats continued to enjoy the highest degree of prestige. Only a few of them — Ferenc Kendi, Farkas Bethlen, László Mikola — were authentic Transylvanians; the most influential were Péter Petrovics, Ferenc Patócsy, Imre Balassa, Antal Losonci, Antal Homonnai, and János Török. These aristocrats not only shared in the governance of Szapolyai's realm but also continued to nurture intimate relations with their social equals many of them close relatives — living in the 'other' Hungary. Most of Hungary's ruling class harboured the hope of reuniting the country, and György Fráter constantly felt the pressure of this wish and expectation.
As long as the friar-regent and the queen pursued identical political objectives, their latent differences and the discontent within the ruling class could be held in check. To be sure, relations were often strained between the royal widow and György Fráter. The Jagiello princess, brought up in the very different world of the royal court at Cracow, had difficulty adapting herself to the violent nature of Hungarian politics, to the regent's notoriously cold manner, and, above all, to the necessary economies. Their discord mostly took the form of a covert contest for power. György Fráter made forceful efforts — ostensibly in the name of the House of Szapolyai — to consolidate central authority. His advantage lay in the power of initiative, in his political experience, and in the economic resources at his command. Isabella, however, had law and traditional royal prerogative on her side, and she had no intention of surrendering her right to rule.
In the early years of this state, the queen, affected perhaps by inexperience or a sense of injury, would attempt to constrain the regent's growing power by demanding implementation of the Gyalu Treaty. The most determined champions of the House of {1-619.} Szapolyai, including Péter Petrovics, Ferenc Kendi, and Ferenc Patócsy, were naturally disposed to challenge the power of the friar, whom they despised and envied; but in the wake of the Turkish victories in 1543–44, they — and other potential dissenters — could not take the risk of showing their true colours. Thus the Gyalu issue disappeared from the agenda, and Isabella had to battle against György Fráter within the constraints of the existing political structure. In the event, the young woman — moody, impulsive, and a novice in politics — proved to be no match for the adamant and determined friar.

'Prince' John Sigismund and 'Voivode' Stephen Báthori
1. FROM THE EASTERN HUNGARIAN KINGDOM TO THE PRINCIPALITY OF TRANSYLVANIA
Transylvania under King Stephen Báthori
A State is Born
Perhaps the most important change was that public opinion became convinced of the necessity for an independent Transylvania. There were, to be sure, some reverses after the break with the Habsburgs in 1556. In the autumn of that year, Saxons in Szeben rebelled against their leaders, who had made a deal with the Hungarians and (indirectly) with the Ottomans. The royal magistrate, Johannes Roth, died in the clash, but Péter Haller and his companions managed within a few days to end the rebellion, which had incidentally brought to the surface other, social cleavages.
Menyhárt Balassa's 'treason' in 1561 swept along into Ferdinand's camp not only the majority of aristocrats in the Tisza region but also their familiars, the rural nobility. Only a few would subsequently submit again to the authority of Gyulafehérvár. But when the Székelys, incited by Balassa, sought remedy for their grievances by rallying to Ferdinand, their 'attack' was mercilessly {1-639.} crushed by John II's troops. Neither of these rebellions had much success, for the ruler always had enough supporters to impose his will. Over a decade would elapse before Bekes managed to 'revive' the resistance of the Székelys and some hot-headed Transylvanian aristocrats. By then, Stephen Báthori was laying the foundations of a peaceful state that would last for twenty years.
A few decisive events marked this process of consolidation. These events, which otherwise fitted into what seemed to be a self-perpetuating pattern, served to clarify a whole series of thorny but crucial questions.
The first important event was young Szapolyai's visit to the sultan in 1566. There was much distress in Transylvania at the Habsburgs' diplomatic 'betrayal', and few were prepared to accompany their prince on such a dangerous visit. (In this respect, too, history was repeating itself, considering the circumstances of King John's negotiations with the Ottomans in 1528–29.)
The foregoing fifteen years had produced numerous crises (1551, 1556, 1557–59, 1561) in the relations between Szapolyai's realm and the Ottomans. Contacts between the two parties, involving meetings of minor officials or protracted diplomatic missions, had been sporadic and inconclusive. The meeting of the two rulers marked the end of this difficult period. Their countries enjoyed trouble-free relations for the next thirty years, although Transylvania was of course in a subordinate position.
The second turning point was the conclusion of the Speyer Treaty. Its significance lay less in the acknowledgment of John Sigismund as prince, which in any case was superseded by his untimely death and the extinction of the Szapolyai dynasty, than in the delineation of the Hungarian Kingdom and Transylvania. Despite intervening complications, those boundaries were put into effect.
Up to this time, the territorial extent of the principality was defined for all practical purposes by the aristocrats and noblemen {1-640.} who submitted to the authority of Gyulafehérvár. Moreover, in the Hungarian system of landholding, the nobility's estates often consisted of villages scattered over as many as three or four counties. Thus, in the Upper Tisza region, the territories of the two countries merged in mosaic fashion. The counties of Bereg, Ugocsa, Szatmár, and Szabolcs had been controlled by Habsburg supporters ever since 1561, yet they encompassed many villages that came under the authority of Transylvania. In 1571, John Sigismund gave up these 'dependencies', and Maximilian reciprocated with respect to villages and estates, belonging to his supporters, that lay within districts transferred to Transylvania. This allowed the frontier line to be drawn with some precision: Máramaros, Kraszna, Közép-Szolnok, and Bihar counties were given to the principality (except for Nagybánya and Erdőd). The agreement precluded further territorial demands by either party.
In theory, the territorial settlement was disadvantageous for Transylvania, for it had previously encompassed the whole of the region east of the Tisza. In reality, the agreement merely confirmed the results of several decades of war. Moreover, the treaty did not freeze all borders. First of all, many districts of the southern counties (including



A State is Born
https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/104.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:33:35]
Karánsebes, Lugos, and parts of Zaránd and Békés counties) were annexed to Transylvania, although they were not mentioned in the Speyer Treaty and lay outside the territory formerly under the voivode's authority. Thanks to an agreement concluded in 1585, Nagybánya and its district was returned to the principality in compensation for properties of the Báthori family, located in Hungary, .
Finally, the greatest merit of the boundary settlement was that it eliminated a chronic source of conflict between Vienna and Gyulafehérvár.
The third decisive event involving Transylvania came soon after the conclusion of the Speyer Treaty. After John Sigismund's death, the rulers of his lands were faced with a choice between two {1-641.} equally lawful possibilities. One was to implement the terms of the Speyer Treaty: the extinction of the Szapolyai dynasty presented an opportunity to unify the remnants of Hungary. The other possibility was provided by the diet that met at Gyulafehérvár in 1567. Evoking the athname issued by Suleiman in Belgrade, the feudal estates enacted a provision for the free election of a ruling prince. The Transylvanians' choice was clear. On 25 May 1571, they elected — 'without any further debate or comment' — Stephen Báthori of Somlyó as their ruler. Thus, as in 1556, they affirmed that independence was not contingent on the ruling dynasties.
The election also served to clarify the Habsburgs' claims and intentions. Emperor Maximilian decided not to dispute the feudal estates' right to choose their ruler. In confidential negotiations, he accepted the Transylvanians' concession that the new prince would formally hold the title of voivode and, accordingly, swear allegiance to Hungary's monarch. For all practical purposes, they ratified the Speyer Treaty while ignoring its essential terms. In the process, a constitutional fiction, linked to the Szapolyai family, was dispelled, for even after the dynasty's extinction, Vienna dared not to challenge the autonomy of Hungary's eastern parts.
The fourth turning-point was Gáspár Bekes's rebellion, or more precisely, its defeat. The latter contributed to the evolution of the Habsburgs' policy, for henceforth, their insistence on the new Hungarian state's subordination became purely theoretical. In practice, they would forego attempts at intervention and act as if Hungary was independent: 'His Majesty the Emperor treated the voivode and his kin with imperial indulgence [...] As before, [Rueber, the captain-general of Kassa] was instructed to maintain good-neighbourly relations.'[10]
Bekes's defeat at the battle at Kerelőszentpál had a deep impact in Transylvania as well. Báthori dealt harshly with the rebels; he had many of the enemy officers hanged right on the battlefield. Bekes managed to flee, but many of his high-ranking {1-642.} accomplices were captured by the prince, tried for a capital offense, and sentenced to death. Miklós Wesselényi, a prosecuting judge of long experience, broke down in tears when he read out the sentence. As a last resort, the defendants evoked Hungary's legal traditions in seeking to appeal to Hungary's king — i.e. Bekes's covert supporter, Maximilian. Báthori, who only a few years earlier modestly referred to himself as a simple voivode of the Habsburgs, now had the diet pass a bill declaring that the King of Hungary no longer had judicial powers over Transylvania and the Partium (the parts of Hungary recently annexed to the principality). The death sentences were carried out, while the principality secured its independence in an important constitutional area.
The fifth, and last, significant event came on 15 December 1575, when Stephen Báthori was elected King of Poland. The Habsburg monarchs could demand homage from the lawfully-appointed Szapolyais or the voivode Báthori in full consciousness of their prerogatives, but the same was not the case with regard to the crowned monarch in Cracow. When Báthori (now styled 'Prince of Transylvania') appointed a voivode to administer Transylvania in his absence (first his older brother Kristóf Báthori, named on 28 January 1576, and, from 1 May 1581, the latter's son Zsigmond), Vienna did not even attempt to reiterate its formal demands. What's more, after the death of Stephen Báthori, the Habsburgs failed to challenge Zsigmond Báthori's right of succession, thus tacitly acknowledging the Transylvanians' right to freely elect a prince.
The decades after 1556 saw the resolution of some lesser legalistic issues. Back in 1552, King Ferdinand had invalidated all grants of land made by Isabella and John II. The difficulties arising from this decision were finally erased by the Speyer Treaty. The election to the Hungarian throne of Archduke Maximilian in 1559, was the last occasion when the nobility of the counties in Hungary proper that were under Szapolyai rule (in the region, contiguous {1-643.} with Transylvania, known as the Partium, i.e. 'parts') were invited to the Hungarian Diet. Still, Vienna made attempts until the late 1570s to tax the inhabitants of the Partium.

To be sure, it was not these incremental changes that made the principality autonomous, for its secession had been accomplished earlier. But the measures served as an essential condition of the principality's external security and internal peace; without them, much energy would have been wasted in coping with external threats and domestic discord. Transylvania had won a respite, and with it the opportunity to develop and consolidate.
Thanks to cool heads and artful tactics, the opportunity was put to good use in staving off potentially disastrous dangers. A weakened Transylvania soon would have sunk to the same dismal state that marked the Balkan peoples under Ottoman rule. With the settlement of the Habsburg relationship, Transylvania's most difficult problem remained its relations with the Sublime Porte. Many power-hungry people were tempted to exploit the turbulence that accompanied the province's evolution to statehood. The initiatives that István Maylád took in 1540 could well have driven Transylvania into a state of subjection to the Ottomans; the quarrelsome Romanian nominees to voivodeships did just that in the case of Moldavia and Wallachia. When Péter Petrovics and, later, Gáspár Bekes tried to win the Ottomans' favour by offering to relinquish the country's principal frontier fortresses, there loomed the danger that a contest for power would deliver Hungary to foreign oppression. Another case in point was the lamentable role played at the Porte by Pál Márkházi.
If Transylvania managed to overcome these dangers, it was thanks to a number of factors that distinguished it from its Romanian neighbours. One differentiating factor lay in the social structure. Hungary's partition had slowed down the evolution of feudal society but did not alter the basic social structure. The rulers were backed by considerable social forces intent on protecting their {1-644.} own interests. This was not the case in Wallachia and Moldavia, where, as an indirect consequence of Turkish pressure, the middle and lesser propertied strata were ruined, leaving the voivodes with only a small boyar class to depend on.
Another factor, equally or perhaps even more important, was that the Transylvanians, being the inheritors of the Hungarian kingdom, could count on Habsburg help in times of trouble. To be sure, this assistance never proved to be truly effective, but even the appearance of Habsburg support was sometimes sufficient to ward off the Ottomans. The tragic events of 1551–56 left one positive legacy: for over twenty years, the Ottomans refrained from overt intervention. Rather than risking an attack that might drive the principality into the arms of Vienna and Prague, the Porte settled for a 'freely loyal' Transylvania.
A growing number of people, in Gyulafehérvár and elsewhere, came to an understanding of this basic fact. After 1556, a Turcophile orientation became an essential part of the policies pursued by the rulers of Eastern Hungary, despite the fact that the actors in charge of the principality's policy-making changed frequently during that decade.
The central figures in the events of 1556 soon passed from the scene. Péter Petrovics died in 1557, and Queen Isabella in 1559. The torch was carried on by the advisers of the young Prince John II, all of whom had served, or had been educated at Isabella's court. The executors of John Sigismund's testament did not challenge the diet's choice of Báthori; they were satisfied with a secret accord that amounted to another Speyer agreement. And, as noted, Gáspár Bekes's challenge may have been endorsed by Vienna but still ended in failure.
Personnel changes in the governing elite reflected the peculiarities of the structure of power. The rulers — the Szapolyais, then the Báthoris — descended from Hungarian aristocrats. The most influential advisers at Isabella's and John II's courts were aristocrats {1-645.} and nobles from the Partium and Western Hungary, such as the chancellor, Mihály Csáky, or Kristóf Hagymássy, Tamás Varkocs, Ferenc Bebek, Menyhárt Balassa, Stephen and Kristóf Báthori, and Gáspár Bekes. In the socio-political elite of the period, only the Kendi family was truly Transylvanian, and it continued to end up the loser in political battles.
The structure of power remained unchanged in another respect as well: neither the Székelys nor the Saxons enjoyed much influence in or over the government at Gyulafehérvár. The former had challenged the regime for a few months, then fell silent. In the case of the Saxons, their German consciousness only grew with the passage of time. Since their Habsburg sympathies found no political outlet, they wisely submitted to the ruler of the day, and this, without asking to share in the burden of government. They paid their taxes, and readily made further financial contributions to the state; beyond this, the Saxons' only concern was to preserve their privileges.
Indeed, one feature of the power structure was that even some foreign-born courtiers enjoyed greater influence than the leaders of these two 'nations'. Isabella and her son welcomed the advice of two Poles, Stanisław

Niezowski and Stanisław Ligęza. Later, their physician, the Italian Giorgio Biandrata (or Blandrata) became a kind of 'Grey Eminence'.
The rulers' political will was naturally reflected in the composition of the ruling elite. Fifteen years of adversity had taught Isabella not to tolerate potential rivals in her entourage. In August 1558, she ordered the assassination of three prominent aristocrats, Ferenc Bebek, Ferenc Kendi, and Sándor Kendi. The organizer of this murderous plot was Menyhárt Balassa. If, in 1561, the same Balassa chose to renege on John Sigismund, it was because as the king's wealthiest subject, he had ample reason to fear disfavour.
Thus, in the decades after 1556, the fate of the new state of Transylvania was shaped by Hungarian monarchs and Hungarian {1-646.} political leaders, a task that they accomplished with growing self-confidence. Transylvania remained what it had become in the blood-soaked era of transition: an eastern remnant of the medieval Hungarian state. The region was severed from the mother country by external forces, adopted a new form of government, and pursued a radically new foreign orientation. Yet the ruling elite, its spirit unbroken, continued to nurture a traditional outlook and Hungarian consciousness.

The Disintegration of the Székely Community

The Romanians 2. ECONOMY, SOCIETY, AND CULTURE OF THE
NEW STATE The Ruling Class
The Disintegration of the Székely Community
The situation of the bellicose peasant-soldiers settled on Transylvania's southeastern corner had long been marked by a basic anomaly. The state and the rest of society had been integrated in the process of feudal development in East-Central Europe for centuries; the Székelys, on the other hand, remained in a distinctive status, neither villein nor noble.
Viewed from the outside, this unusual ethnic group still appeared unified at the beginning of the 16th century. Their society continued to be distinguished by the village community, the bearing of arms, the strength of Székely communal traditions, and the administrative autonomy of the seats. The occasional imposition of an 'ox-roast' tax did not alter their basic freedom from state levies, for it was officially construed as a 'gift'. The power of the Székely {1-709.} elite, the primors, was effectively balanced by juries that included lower-ranked Székelys (lófő and gyalog) as well as by the Székely national assembly.
However, the persistent efforts of more prosperous families to rise socially weakened the apparently solid structure of 'Székely liberties'. More and more impoverished Székelys felt compelled to enter the service of such families. By the beginning of the 16th century, this voluntary servitude was turning into a more binding relationship, for the wealthy masters began to 'extort money', i.e. demand feudal services. Population growth led to the clearing of more and more land, and these new fields and pastures became the property not of the village community but of individuals. The landowner would try to bring cotters from the outside to settle on his lands or, failing that, to hire poor Székelys. Thus the lord-villein relationship became progressively more common in the Székely region.
A number of Székely leaders gained as Hungarian noblemen titles and property in the royal counties. Having acquired land by inheritance, through defaulted mortgages, or thanks to Székely commoners who had joined their service, these nobles proceeded to introduce feudal practices. Noble families who joined the Székely community through intermarriage and progressively expanded their property and influence were particularly inclined to adopt feudal ways.
Momentarily, such tendencies were limited to individual cases and had little impact on the social and legal system. It was the events in the aftermath of Mohács that accelerated the process of change. Szapolyai's realm was considerably smaller than the former Kingdom of Hungary, and thus the relative importance of the Székelyföld increased. The ongoing state of war required a sustained military effort from the state, and society had to bear the cost. The Székelys were called upon repeatedly to supply military manpower, and their tax-exemption inevitably drew the attention of {1-710.} the cash-strapped treasury. Szapolyai obtained that the 'exceptional' (but by now wellestablished) war-tax apply to the Székelys as well. It was first levied in 1545, György Fráter having evoked as pretext the tribute paid to the Porte since 1543. At first, he would try to ease the Székelys' burden by making advances against their levy from his treasury. The Székelys, for their part, tried to resist by refusing to register for the tax. All this merely served to delay the inevitable, although the Turkish pretext was temporarily dropped.
If the chronically rebellious Székelys ultimately accepted this blatant abrogation of their traditional privileges, it was because the dangers were clear for all to see. However, the growth of state intervention prompted a rapid transformation of Székely society. In accordance with the 1554 statutes, the Székely primors and lófős were, like Hungarian nobles, exempted from state taxes. The exemption extended to common Székelys who served, and were, in fact, becoming the villeins and cotters of these privileged families. The remaining freemen were left saddled with the full weight of the new measures, being obligated to serve as soldiers and pay the war-tax.
The erosion of the Székelys' traditional community caused a rise in social tensions. Ordinary Székelys tended to blame the state, although their own leaders, by neglecting the common interest, bore a share of responsibility for their troubles. György Fráter had enough authority to contain the discontent, and Castaldo's administration was too brief and confused to give the Székelys any idea what they might expect from Ferdinand. The best indication that the Székelys' discontent had not reached boiling point is offered by the impact of Reformation, which touched

them relatively late, and to modest effect. In the 1550s, when the Lutherans acquired their very first church, in Marosvásárhely, most Székelys continued to cling to their 'ancient institutions' and Roman Catholic faith.
The Székely problem became more acute after Transylvania's secession in 1556. Sharing the motives of their predecessors, Queen {1-711.} Isabella, and then her son and his advisers intervened more and more forcefully in the affairs of the Székely community. The 'castle-war' that raged on Transylvania's northwestern frontier demanded great military effort. At the same time, the court at Gyulafehérvár was faced with the reality that the Székely community was disintegrating. The monarch and his councillors thus had to weigh the merits preserving the increasingly illusory liberties of the Székelys.
Isabella's choice was unequivocal. The diet, meeting in 1556 at Szamosújvár, required the Székelys to do military service (specifically for the siege of Habsburg-held Várad) and to pay a tax of one forint per capita. The following year, at Gyulafehérvár, the diet entrenched both the principle of individual military obligation and that of taxability; the 'Székely nation' was assessed an annual tax of 5000 forints. What's more, the diet ruled that concurrent decisions of the other two, Hungarian and Saxon nations were binding on the Székelys even if the latter dissented. Finally, the diet declared — in clear violation of customary law — that the property of Székelys found guilty of disloyalty should lawfully revert to the crown.
These rulings were confirmed and extended by subsequent diets. The fiscal immunity of the Székely elite and the taxability of ordinary Székelys were reaffirmed in 1558, and again in 1559, when the diet also ordered the registration by 'gate' of the taxable Székely villeins.
Székely liberties were thus essentially reduced to two features. Unless they chose to serve as villeins, Székely freemen were immune to the {1-712.} authority of landowners and therefore spared of a variety of feudal burdens. As far as is known, no Székely was required to do corvée or pay feudal dues in kind prior to 1562. In addition, the civil and judicial administration of the territorial seats remained largely autonomous, although, from 1559, royal magistrates appointed by the sovereign tended in practice to claim the authority of lord lieutenants. But there was little left to distinguish a Székely notable from the Hungarian nobleman who was exempted from tax, had to do military service, and disposed of villeins.
In fact, Queen Isabella's laws did not represent a major innovation, for they essentially codified the changes that had come about in the Székelyföld over the preceding fifty years. It might even be argued that the measures amounted to a skilful compromise. They provided a legal framework for the unavoidable 'modernization', i.e. feudalization of Székely society, and the state got what it needed, while ordinary Székelys were left with some of their 'inalienable' rights.
Naturally, ordinary Székelys resented the privileges accorded to their social superiors, and it was equally understandable that Székely freemen should resent having to carry the double burden of soldiering and taxation. But the changes came too gradually to turn discontent into rebellion. The stimulus came once again from Hungarian politics: Menyhárt Balassa's revolt in 1562 against John Sigismund. The conspirators, who enjoyed the Habsburgs' support, included Moldavia's voivode, Despot. Taking note of the Székelys' problems, they promised to restore 'ancient liberties' and thereby managed to provoke an uprising by the more distressed members of that community. The young king had to make great concessions to secure peace, but none of them involved the Székelys; the Habsburgs' supporters readily abandoned those who had helped them to achieve significant successes in Transylvania.
Indeed, the Székelys had contributed a great many soldiers (by some obviously exaggerated accounts, as many as 40,000) to the rebellion against the monarch. However, the leaders of the 'attack' hesitated. The larger part of their army hovered aimlessly near Segesvár, while smaller forces rampaged through the environs of Marosvásárhely, Szászrégen, and Görgény. The sovereign thus had time to prepare his riposte, and the failure of the first attack led by the castellan of Fogaras, Gábor Maylád — on the Székelys had {1-713.} no great consequences. The army of Transylvania's feudal estates, commanded by László Radák and Gábor Pekry, defeated the smaller Székely force by the Nyárád River, near Görgény. Soon afterwards, the larger Székely army seized its own leaders and delivered them to the authorities before peacefully disbanding.
Bloody reprisals followed. The Székelys' chief commanders, György Nagy and Ambrus Gyepesi, were impaled,

and many others had their hands, nose, and ears cut off. The scale of the rebellion nevertheless gave the sovereign food for thought, and when the diet met on 20 June 1562 at Segesvár, the measures it took to prevent a recurrence were not free of ambivalence. Some of them were clearly punitive. Székely troops would no longer be commanded by their own 'lieutenant' but by royally-appointed officers. The production and marketing of salt, an important source of income for the Székelys, became a state monopoly. The ruling that the property of disloyal Székelys should revert to the crown, and not to the Székely community, was reaffirmed. The appeals court at Udvarhely was abolished, and henceforth Székelys were forced to appeal directly to the princely high court. The judicial system in the seats was reformed to favour the primors and lófős by the exclusion of ordinary Székelys from jury service. The elite's fiscal immunity and military obligation were once again confirmed.
The ordinary, 'pedestrian' (gyalog) Székelys were hit with further sanctions. The sovereign acquired the exclusive right to elevate ordinary Székelys to the higher ranks. Their obligation to pay taxes was maintained, while their military obligation was implicitly abrogated. To be sure, the latter measure lightened their burden, but it also eliminated the theoretical basis for their status of freemen. This may be why the measure was not spelled out; the authorities simply 'forgot' to include in the statute any reference to the ordinary Székelys' military obligation.
In spite of all this, the 1562 laws were not purely punitive, for John Sigismund offered some compensation for the losses. A {1-714.} clause stated that 'the Székely community is part of our free realm, and no one may compel them to perform services'; this promised to put a halt to a process that had been going on for decades, in which ordinary Székelys were falling into villeinage.
Over the next few years the sovereign took concrete steps to protect 'his Székelys' from the demands of aristocrats and nobles. However, as the castle-war dragged on, the 'primor' and 'lófő' nobles, had ample opportunity to demonstrate that Transylvania was in great need of their military prowess — and that it would be imprudent to provoke their anger.
The experiment came to an end in May 1566, when the diet of Torda summarily identified the Székely nobles with the Hungarian nobility and sacrificed the rights of the ordinary Székelys. In subsequent years, hundreds of the latter were treated as ordinary villeins and compelled to do corvée. For the poor Székelys who were thrust into servitude, life had taken a tragic turn. On the other hand, in terms of the interests of the Transylvanian state, John Sigismund's decision was both necessary and productive. For one thing, the development of feudalism had induced the socioeconomic decline of ordinary Székelys even before the enactment of oppressive measures; in the absence of state intervention, the potentially turbulent transition would have dragged on for decades. For another, the Székelys' liberties represented a powerful disruptive force that threatened Transylvania's very survival, and thereby the interests of the Hungarian people as a whole. By its action, the principality's government effectively gave the country a uniform social structure. To be sure, there remained some deviations from feudal orthodoxy, such as certain impositions on villeins, the autonomy of Saxon villages, and the emerging social stratum of guardsmen. But none of these represented an external challenge for the social order of feudalism.
The exclusion of ordinary Székelys left the Transylvanian army short of manpower, but the gap was soon filled. When the war {1-715.} with the Habsburgs flared up again in 1564–65, the Gyulafehérvár court felt compelled to restore individual conscription among villeins; however, the measure was not aimed specifically at the Székelys, for it involved all of the country's agricultural workers. Changes that were more radical came after 1566. As noted, with regard to military service, the Székely elite had been assimilated to the nobles; ordinary Székelys who had become villeins were, like other villeins, eligible for service in the local militias. The Székelys' only advantage was that their military experience made them particularly welcome in the militia, as well as in the new 'peasant units' that were formed throughout the country in the mid-1560s. The equivalent in the Székelyföld of the 'rifleman' and 'guards' detachments was known as 'red guards', after the colour of their uniform. Their obligations and privileges were the same as those of peasant soldiers elsewhere. Thus military service could no longer help to preserve traditional Székely liberties.
The rulers were aware that ancient traditions could not be erased by the stroke of a pen. John Sigismund had two fortresses raised in the Székelyföld to keep watch over the local population, 'Székelytámad' in Udvarhely and 'Székelybánja' in the Háromszék district. (The names were ominously suggestive, for támad means attack, and bánja means regret.) The precaution was well-advised, for the Székelys kept on grumbling and protesting throughout his reign. Many of the complaints were aimed at the royal magistrates, who showed typically feudal

arbitrariness in their administrative, judicial, and tax-raising activities, generally to the detriment of the village communities.
When Stephen Báthori assumed power, the Székelys' hopes were revived that their liberties would be restored. The new sovereign showed no disposition to respond to their grievances, and so, in 1571, another rebellion erupted, only to be suppressed by the government's forces. When, in 1575, rebellion flared up again, the Székelys were crushed at the Battle of Kerelőszentpál. That defeat {1-716.} deterred the Székelys for a long time from engaging in armed revolt.
The transformation of Székely society was coming to a close, and the feudal system was consolidated by direct state intervention. The destruction of their old way of life had a traumatic effect on Székelys. In the mid 1560s, the Reformation swept through that onetime bastion of Catholicism, the Székelyföld. While some smaller districts stuck to the traditional denomination, most of them shifted to Calvinism, and some of these later adopted the Unitarian faith. At the end of the century, the most radical of the Christian sects, the Sabbaticals, also drew many Székely converts. The coincidence of rapid social change and religious radicalism was not accidental. And the issue of Székely liberties did not disappear from history's agenda.

Romanian Voivodes and Cnezes, Nobles and Villeins
As late as the 13th century, Romanian settlements in Transylvania were found only in the southern mountain region. Records show that they began to proliferate around 1300, when {1-488.} Romanians settled in virtually all of Transylvania's mountain and hill districts, with the exception of the Székely region in the Eastern Carpathians. Judging from 14th-century charters, the pattern of settlement in Hungary was undergoing rapid change. Villages materialized in areas that sources had previously ignored and indicated as being uninhabited; some of them soon disappear, only to be replaced by new villages on the same sites, or nearby. There is no doubt that this dynamic pattern, accompanied by frequent changes in toponyms, owed to a massive influx of Romanians. In one Romanian district of the Severin Province, five villages were recorded in 1365, and thirteen in 1404, with only one appearing in both lists. The process of migration did not end there, for in 1510, the district encompassed 36 villages, of which only two had existed in 1404. The appearance of new toponyms confirms that Romanian settlements became stabilized only at the end of the Middle Ages.
The scale of Romanian settlements in the 14th century was far greater than in earlier times, and it cannot be attributed to natural increase in the Romanian community of southern Transylvania. Sources indicate that at least some of the settlers came from beyond Hungary's borders. When, in 1334, a certain voivode Bogdan moved to Hungary (de terra sua in Hungariam), he brought along so many people that the migration stretched over nine months; the king delegated one of Hungary's highest dignitaries, the archbishop of Kalocsa, to organize the settlement. In 1359, six members of a distinguished Romanian family from Wallachia settled in the Temesköz (relictis omnibus bonis in terra Transalpina habitis, nostre maiestati semet ipsos obtulerunt fideliter servituros), where the king had given them thirteen villages to accommodate their retinue; six years later, they received another five properties. The voivode Balk and his four brothers moved in 1365 from Moldavia to Hungary (in regnum nostrum Hungarie advenit). Their example set off a wave of immigration, and, within a few years, numerous {1-489.} Romanian settlements materialized in hitherto sparsely inhabited mountain areas of northern Transylvania; one of the brothers even led a group of Romanian settlers to Poland.
While references to Romanians in Serbian royal charters became progressively rarer, the number of Romanians in Hungary grew steadily. By the 15th century, these people, who spoke a northern Romanian dialect, had largely abandoned their Balkan homeland to settle along the Danube's left bank. Since there were too many to accommodate on the royal castle-estates in Eastern Hungary, the Crown renounced its exclusive right to receive immigrants and tolerated the theoretically unauthorized settlement of Romanians on private estates. In the event, the Romanians found that their economic and legal status was less favourable on church and private estates. Though dispensed of military obligation, they had to supply more services in kind. Moreover, the pastures on private estates were much more confined than on the vast, alpine royal estates; to reap the maximum fee for the use of pastureland, landowners made sure that 'their' Romanians did not graze their flocks on adjoining properties. Eventually, the subdivision of privatized royal estates and the avarice of landlords rendered extensive grazing so onerous that it faded away, and most Romanian shepherds began to graze their flocks within village boundaries. Transhumance survived only on the far side of the southern and eastern Carpathians. The first permanent Romanian settlements were established (as indicted by the linguistic derivation of toponyms) on the fringes of existing Hungarian, Slav, and Saxon villages, at the foot of the mountain range. Later, in the 15th–16th centuries, the process of settlement reached higher altitudes, where the Romanian way of life was not influenced by the proximity of other peoples; only these later-established villages bear names of Romanian origin.
Until the mid-1300s, the Romanian immigrants settled in and near uninhabited mountain areas, and not in the middle of the {1-490.} Transylvanian Basin populated by Hungarians and Saxons. Then came the Black Death, which swept across Europe in 1348–49 and, as both foreign and Hungarian sources confirm, decimated Hungary's population (mortalitas magna fuit in regno Ungarie, multe civitates et ville deserte habitatoribus vacuate). Short of manpower, the landowners settled Romanians — who, living in the mountains, had suffered less from the plague, and whose numbers were steadily growing through immigration — in the depopulated, Hungarian and

Saxon villages of central Transylvania. This is the origin of the 'twin villages' that characterize the central plateau and river valleys of Transylvania: their Hungarian or Saxon names were prefixed with 'Magyar' (Hungarian), 'Szász' (Saxon), or 'Oláh' (Vlach = Romanian) to distinguish the ethnic halves of the settlement. The foundation of these twin villages is easy to date, for their names lacked an ethnic prefix before the 14th or 15th century, indicating that they had been inhabited by only one ethnic group. The Romanian settlement must have occurred between the last recorded reference to a prefix-free toponym and the first reference to an ethnically-divided village.
The dual village-names also reveal that the Romanian settlements were segregated from those of the other nationalities. This segregation is explained by enduring cultural and religious differences; the Hungarians and Saxons belonged to the Roman Church, while the Romanians were Greek Orthodox (sources from the late 14th century mention 'Vlach chapels' in the Romanian half of twin villages). Although the Romanians assimilated an agrarian way of life, shepherding remained their principal occupation. In 1461, when the crown's agents came to collect the 'sheep fiftieth' tax in villages of the Mezőség, two landowners reported that 'they had delivered sheep the previous year, but this year they had no Romanians'.[21] Evidently the Romanian shepherds had tried to practice transhumance between the Mezőség and the central Transylvanian mountains; however, those thickly-forested mountains {1-491.} had no natural alpine pastures, and thus summer pastures had to be created by forest-clearance. The sheep grazed on the new saplings but avoided the thorny undergrowth, which soon spread to cover the pastures. The shepherds in this area, which came to be known as the 'Móc region' (mócvidék), grew weary of the annual chore of clearing the thorn bushes from their summer pastures, and gave up transhumance. They thus settled near the Hungarian and Saxon villages where they had previously wintered, founding the 'Oláh' part of the twin villages. Their enduring attachment to shepherding is illustrated by the fact that, in the Middle Ages, all Romanians in Hungary had to pay the 'sheep fiftieth' tax.
In the mid-1300s, the Romanian community in Transylvania underwent a major transformation. The Romanian voivodes and cnezes, whose social and legal status was similar to that of the Saxon gerébs, followed the latter's ascent into the nobility. On the other hand, the social evolution of Romanian commoners was quite different from that of their Saxon counterparts. The kings rewarded some voivodes and cnezes for their military service with noble status, but, initially, that status was circumscribed: they remained obligated to pay taxes in kind for their estates, and to provide precisely-defined military services. Voivodes and cnezes who held this semi-noble status were identified in charters as 'noble voivode' or 'noble cnez' (nobilis voivoda, nobilis kenezius). Their social status was equivalent of that of the Hungarian 'conditional noble' (conditionarius), who was also burdened with defined services. Similarly, the bishops of Várad and Transylvania rewarded Romanian voivodes who served in their military escorts with a 'church nobility' that was akin to conditional nobility. Once ennobled, the voivodes were free to manage the land that had been originally put in their care as a nobleman's estate, and to treat the free Romanians living on the estate as their villeins; but the king or bishop retained title to the land, and the Romanians came under the jurisdiction of the royal or episcopal castellan, and not of the county's nobiliary {1-492.} courts. The bishops' semi-noble voivodes remained in this state of dependence until the early modern period, when the Reformation did away with church estates. In contrast, the crown's semi-noble voivodes and cnezes soon rose to the ranks of the full-fledged, 'national nobility', winning the same rights and obligations as Hungarian nobles.
The main difference between the Székely and Saxon nobles and Romanian nobles is that while the former acquired the properties that qualified them for nobility outside their regions, in the counties, the latter were given nobiliary rights to the estate that they had previously administered. The natural consequence of this was that ordinary Romanians lost their freedom and became the villeins of the ennobled voivodes and cnezes. After some sporadic resistance, these people became resigned to their fate. The king had no interest in safeguarding the freedom of Romanian commoners who, unlike the voivodes and cnezes, performed no military service. Thus, by the end of the Middle Ages, most Romanians had become the villeins of Hungarian or Saxon noblemen, or, in some cases, of ennobled Romanians. This was the reason that Romanians did not become one of the feudal 'nations'. Villeins, whatever their nationality, were denied political rights. The nobility, on the other hand, constituted a single 'nation' irrespective of ethnic origin.
The social ascent of the Romanian elite was most rapid outside Transylvania, in the Máramaros region. The reason was that, in the 14th century, the most serious threat facing Hungary lay in the northeast, with the still-potent Mongol empire. The Romanian voivodes and cnezes of Máramaros participated in the campaigns of Charles Robert and Louis the Great — against the Mongols, then the Lithuanians, and, ultimately, against the rebellious

voivode of Moldavia, Bogdan — and thereby won the reward of nobility. 'Real' nobility, free of tax and service obligations, was granted to cnezes of Szurdok in 1326, of Bedőháza in 1336, and of Váralja and Felsőróna in 1360. In 1380, following the model of the Hungarian {1-493.} noble counties, the Romanian noblemen of Máramaros affirmed their autonomy by electing judges (judices nobilium) and jurymen from within their ranks to assist the crown-appointed count. Hungary's first landowning aristocrats of Romanian origin who came to play a role in national politics came from the Máramaros voivodes, especially from the Drágfi family, whose estate encompassed over a hundred villages.
In the 14th century, there were no Romanians in Transylvania who had full noble status. In the Romanian districts of Hunyad county and of the counties of Severin Province that still belonged to Hungary, judicial affairs were handled until the end of the 1400s by castellans, who were appointed by Transylvania's voivode or by the governor (bán) of Severin, and assisted by jurymen selected from among the cnezes. The cnezes performed personal military service and paid land-rent and sheep-tax for the villages under their administration. As the Turkish threat intensified, the cnezes of the royal castle-estates on the southern frontier performed more and more military service. As a result, many of the Romanian cnezes in the area of today's Bánság and Hunyad county won conditional nobility and, by the end of the century, attained full nobility. It is hardly coincidental that the mass ennoblement of Romanian cnezes is linked to the name of János Hunyadi, for this great general had grown up among them and understood their aspirations. When he served as Transylvania's voivode and Székely count (the first time that the two offices were held by one man), Hunyadi drew into his retinue not only Hungarian and Székely retainers but also several Romanian cnezes. The powerful voivode's followers were naturally the first to benefit from his favour, and several distinguished Transylvanian families trace their ancestry to cnezes ennobled by Hunyadi: the Nádasdi Ungor, Malomvizi Kenderesi, Kendeffi, and Csulai families of Hunyad county, and the Csornai, Bizerei, Mutnoki, Temeseli Dési, and Macskási families from Severin Province. In the second half of the 15th century, the number of {1-494.} newly-ennobled Romanians in Hunyad county compared with that of the lesser nobility in any Hungarian county: they included cnez families from the royal castle-districts at Hátszeg, Déva, and Jófő (Bajesdi, Barbátvizi, Bári, Brettyei, Csolnokosi, Farkadini, Fejérvizi, Galaci, Karulyosdi, Kernyesti, Klopotivai, Lindzsinai, Livádi, Macesdi, Oncsokfalvi, Osztrói, Pestényi, Ponori, Puji, Riusori, Szacsali, Szentpéterfalvi, Szilvási, Totesdi, Vádi, Várhelyi, Zejkányi); some of them, such as the Szálláspataki and Demsusi Muzsina families, had estates that encompassed a large number of villages. János Hunyadi's mother came from the Demsusi Muzsina family. Noble titles and demesnes were granted to the voivodes of Sebesvár, in Kolozs county, from whom descend the Meregjói Botos, Kalotai Vajda, Csicsei Vajda, and Danki Vajda families, as well as to the Lupsai Kende family in Alsó-Fehér county. In the late 14th and early 15th centuries, the Romanian elite in the Fogaras region had feudal estates granted to them by the king of Hungary, but they remained under the jurisdiction of Wallachia's voivodes; this explains why they were known not as cnezes but as boyars, a title of Bulgar origin that was used by the nobles of Wallachia. In the feudal hierarchy, the boyars of Fogaras had a status similar to that of cnezes on other royal castle-estates, although they were obligated to provide feudal services on a larger scale than the latter. Several boyar families attained full noble status, notably the Maylád family, which played an important role in the early modern period. All this is in regard to the historic territory of Transylvania; there were Romanian nobles in other parts of Hungary as well.
Ennobled Romanians not only took on the title but also adopted the legal code, administrative institutions, and lifestyle of the Hungarian nobility. Máramaros acquired, as noted, an administrative structure identical to that of Hungarian counties. In the second half of the 15th century, the cnezial court covering districts in Severin evolved into a standard county court; the official responsible for the preparation and application of the court's rulings, known {1-495.} as the krajnik, gradually assumed the role of county judge. A similar development took place in the Hátszeg area. In the 14th century, the assembly of cnezes was still convened by the royal castellan, and his word would rule the day; but by the early 1400s, the cnezes began to act as autonomous nobles, for they would at times assemble, render judgement, and issue charters without any involvement on the part of the castellan. In Hunyad county, where there was an established Hungarian nobility and nobiliary court, the ennobled Romanians espoused the existing institutions, and the cnezial court ceased to exist.
Many, but not all of the ennobled Romanian cnezes adhered to the Roman Catholic Church. In the Máramaros, a sizeable number of them stayed with the Greek Orthodox Church. Hungary's kings insisted on conversion only in the cases of nobles living in the southern frontier regions, and their motivation was mainly political, for the 'rebellious Wallachian voivodes' exploited religion to make trouble in Hungary. Only those ennobled Romanians

became linguistically assimilated who had regular contact with the Hungarians; but, following the pattern of nobles of Slovak origin, all of them assimilated a Hungarian outlook and Hungarian values. The Romanian noblemen in Hungary were forthright in declaring themselves members of the 'Hungarian nation' of nobles. While their counterparts in Wallachia and Moldavia, voivodes and boyars, adopted — with few exceptions — a conciliatory attitude towards the Ottoman Turks, Hungary's Romanian noblemen accepted the obligations that went with their privileged status and fought loyally at the side of the Hungarians.
Hungarians did not generally regard the Romanian noblemen as foreigners. In the second half of the 15th century, Hungary's kings regularly appointed Romanians to high office, and this without incurring protest from a Hungarian nobility that already had a highly developed sense of national identity. Several Romanians were appointed to the important office of governor in Severin {1-496.} Province: Mihály Csornai (1447–54), István and Mihály Mutnoki (1467–69), and, at the end of the century, Péter Macskási. János Malomvizi Kenderesi and Mihály Pestényi both served as count of the Máramaros, and Péter Temeseli Dési as count of Bereg county. János Nádasdi Ungor, whose father had taught János Hunyadi how to handle arms, was a favourite of King Matthias. Through his wife, who issued from the Lendvai Bánffy family, he had become related to some of the country's oldest aristocratic families, and his success as a military commander earned him vast estates. Another Romanian success story is that of the Csulai family, from the Hátszeg region. Vlad Csulai, a noble cnez of modest means, had seven sons, five of whom attained high public office. László Ficsor served as ban of Jajca and of Severin, Miklós Kende as ban of Sabác, György Móré as ban of Severin and of Nándorfehérvár, János Báncsa as castellan of Bálványos, and Fülöp Móré as bishop of Pécs; their wives came from the aristocratic Bethlen, Haranglábi, and Dóczi families.

Saxon Towns and Political Unity
The Saxons' new leaders came from the merchant class that had emerged and accumulated wealth in the process of urbanization. The gerébs' military aristocracy arose within the context, and under the impetus of Hungarian social development; similarly, the Saxon patrician class was the product not of a social evolution traceable to legal and economic institutions brought by the Saxons from their original homeland, but of Hungary's socio-economic transformation. The early Saxon society in Transylvania was marked by a village-based, noble-peasant lifestyle, and there is no reason to believe that it harboured the seeds of urbanization. The medieval middle class dwelt in towns, which nurtured crafts and commerce, and possessed a distinctive legal order and lifestyle. The institutions of Hungary's towns, and commerce, the lifeblood of those towns, came about as a consequence of economic development. The model was the Western European town, which was as typical of Europe's culture as knighthood, feudalism, or Romanesque and Gothic styles of architecture. Geography explains why the development of Hungarian towns resembled most closely that of German towns, although German urban culture — like other medieval institutions — was introduced to Hungary by immigrants from many parts of Western Europe. The earliest Hungarian towns, such as Esztergom, Buda, and Székesfehérvár, counted among their inhabitants not only native Hungarians but also neo-Latins (French, Walloon, and Italian) and Germans, and some towns, notably as {1479.} Pest, also harboured Eastern merchants, Arabs, and Volga Bulgars. Hungary's towns did not suddenly materialize as the result of some single founding act; they evolved from royal castles and rural settlements. In Transylvania, as noted, the towns of Dés, Kolozsvár, Torda, and Gyulafehérvár grew out of royal castles that had lost their military importance as a result of the Mongol invasion; merchants and artisans joined the earlier population of farmers and craftsmen. The original castle people were of Hungarian origin, and the newcomers (hospeses) included some Hungarians, but most of them were Germans. The development of some Saxon villages into towns owed more to political than to economic factors.
After suppressing the Saxons' rebellion in 1324, Charles Robert imposed on them a new administrative system. Previously, the Saxons had four distinct and autonomous territories (often referred to in charters as comitati or provinces) administered by a count, generally a Hungarian nobleman, who was appointed by the king. After 1224, when the king issued the Andreanum, the largest area was encompassed by Szeben province, which extended from Szászváros to Barót; the territories of Medgyes-Selyk, Brassó, and Beszterce were considerably smaller. Szeben was the Saxon powder keg: the province's gerébs quarrelled interminably with the bishop of Transylvania, and often with the voivode as well. To make supervision more effective, the king in 1324 suspended the territorial authority of the Szeben count and divided the province into judicial districts, or seats. Each seat was administered by a royal judge, directly appointed by the king, who normally picked someone from a loyal geréb family. The three other districts continued to be administered by counts, Hungarian aristocrats who would normally also be acting as counts of the Székelys, and who were assisted by their Hungarian retainers.
In 1402, the seats of Medgyes and Selyk received royal permission to elect their royal judges. This concession marked the beginning of a process of emancipation that would lead to local {1-480.} self-government for the Saxons. In 1464, King Matthias allowed the town of Szeben to elect its royal judge, and, in 1469, he extended this right to the province's seven other seats. In 1486, King Matthias extended the applicability of the Andreanum — which enshrined the privileges of the Szeben Saxons — to the districts of Brassó, Beszterce, and Medgyes-Selyk. This step had major consequences: a clause in the charter, providing that the Saxons of Szeben would be governed by a single high official, was now interpreted to include Brassó, Beszterce, and even Segesvár (founded in the 14th century). Thus the king's counts were withdrawn from these districts, and the Saxons became politically unified under a single official, the Saxon count, whose title was assumed by the mayor of Szeben. In the period of fragmented administration, the localities that served as administrative and judicial centres for the seats and districts underwent steady development. Thanks to their official status, they became market towns; by the mid-1300s, they had attracted merchants and craftsmen who exploited markets in the Wallachian and Moldavian voivodeships.
Moldavia and Wallachia, which later became principalities, were considered Cumanian lands when they were

annexed to Hungary in the early 13th century by King Béla IV. After the Mongol invasion, their link to Hungary became purely nominal. Once the Cumanians had departed, the king put Romanian voivodes in charge of these territories, officials who were appointed in the same manner as Transylvania's voivode. However, the recurrent attacks by Mongols kept the region in turmoil, and it was only in Wallachia, along a narrow stretch of the Carpathians' foothills, that two voivodes managed to exercise their rule. Until the early 1300s, Moldavia remained a sparsely populated, political no-man's-land. Exploiting the prevailing political turmoil, Wallachia's voivodes emulated the Hungarian oligarchy by trying to expand their autonomy at the expense of the Crown. In 1330, Charles Robert failed to impose his will on the voivode Basarab, and he barely escaped {1-481.} death in his disastrous military campaign. Thereafter, Hungary's kings had to be content with oaths of fealty that gave the voivodes considerable political latitude. Székely troops, led by the Székely count Endre Lackfi, finally expelled the Mongols from Moldavia in 1352; seven years later, the territory's voivode, Bogdan, rebelled against the king, and he too won a large degree of autonomy.
Although the Hungarian king suffered a reduction in his authority beyond the Carpathians, he retained considerable influence. Rich in natural resources, his two Romanian protectorates were opened up to Transylvanian commerce. The voivodeships were barely starting to get organized (the first Romanian stone church dates from the early 1300s). When, with the fading of the Mongol threat, commerce revived, they depended on Transylvanian traders to exchange their goods for Western manufactured products. The main economic beneficiaries were the Saxon towns lying close to the border, notably Szeben, Brassó, and Beszterce. Louis I the Great, who reigned from 1342 to 1382, pursued an active economic policy: he sought to restore Hungary's place in east-west trade — for centuries, merchants had avoided passing through the country — and encouraged the Saxons' commercial endeavours. In 1369, he granted Brassó a staple right, in terms of which German and Polish merchants, intent on exporting their cloth (the period's principal export commodity) to Wallachia, were compelled to sell it to Brassó's traders; the latter then traded the cloth for Wallachian agricultural products and livestock that were sold on the Brassó market. Beszterce had been granted in 1368 a similar right over the trade route that connected Moldavia and Poland, and Szeben won comparable privileges in 1378. Most of this lively commerce with the east involved Western European products, mainly textiles, for in the 14th century, the Saxons produced few manufactured goods for the market. The Saxon traders seldom concerned themselves with the actual movement of goods. They exploited the staple right in the same manner as their Viennese counterparts, by simply exchanging {1-482.} goods in their town markets with Romanian merchants. Occasionally, they would travel to the Romanian voivodeships to negotiate a major deal, but seldom ventured farther east. Saxon traders travelled more frequently to the West, particularly to fairs in Germany, after King Louis withdrew their staple right in Buda. They conveyed Wallachian and Moldavian raw materials to these fairs, and returned with spices and textiles. They had two principal routes. One led through Kassa to Bohemia, Poland, and onward to Danzig; the other passed through Buda to either Vienna, Regensburg, and Basel, or Zara (Zadar) and Venice.
It took some time for Saxon industry to win a share of this growing economic activity. Craftsmen's guilds began to appear in Transylvania in the middle of the 14th century. King Louis disbanded the guilds, then, in 1376, responded to the Saxons' request and restored them under new rules. Although there were 19 guilds, with 25 branch crafts, the regulations provided no quantitative limits on output, suggesting that the craftsmen served only local needs. Such limits appear in guild charters of the 15th century, when the craftsmen began to produce for the market or even for export; only then did the products of Transylvanian industry find their way to the east. Industry grew at such a pace that even some village-based guilds had over a hundred members. A growing variety of goods was exported to the Romanian voivodeships: 15th century customs regulations make reference to clothing, cooking utensils, knives, weapons, unfinished metal products, spices, jewellery, parchment, paper, carts, and even dried fruit and cakes. Imports from the voivodeships still consisted of unprocessed products, notably livestock, hides, wool, wax, honey, and, more rarely, grain.
The three major Saxon towns, Nagyszeben, Brassó, and Beszterce, controlled commercial access through mountain passes to the voivodeships, thereby impeding the development not only of Hungarian towns (Dés, Torda, Gyulafehérvár) and Székely centres (Marosvásárhely, Kézdivásárhely, Udvarhely, Sepsiszentgyörgy) {1-483.} but also of other Saxon towns (Szászsebes, Medgyes, Segesvár, Szászváros). Some smaller Székely towns were situated equally close to the border, but the Székelys' martial traditions retarded the emergence of a full-fledged merchant class, and by the time this began to change, the Saxons had secured an unchallengeable lead.

The Saxon towns' only serious competitor was Kolozsvár, a town that, at the time of its founding, had a mixed Hungarian-German population. Kolozsvár could draw commercial benefit from its location at the crossroads of trade between Transylvania and the rest of Hungary. Although originally its inhabitants pursued a typically noblepeasant lifestyle, the town came to play a leading role in the development of a market-based economy and society in Transylvania. Drawn by the growth of manufactures and the freedom found in town, more and more Hungarian villeins moved from the surrounding districts to Kolozsvár in the second half of the 14th century. German artisans migrated, in smaller numbers, from the Saxon lands and Germany. Before long, prosperous traders assumed leadership of the mass of craftsmen organized into guilds, and they sought a place in municipal government alongside the old commercial and propertied elite. Whereas the old elite was driven by nobiliary and military ambitions, this rising social stratum had little interest in owning land and was self-consciously German. In 1405, the new middle class won the king's support and broke the grip of the town's power elite, which consisted of a few old and wealthy families. The Germans' particularism upset the harmony between Hungarians and Saxons, who began to vie for control of the town. For a while, the Saxons prevailed; then, in 1458, the Hungarian middle class, which was in the majority, obtained — with the government's support — that the two groups share equally in appointments to the town council and the magistrature. For centuries, both parties faithfully abided by this principle, but demographics favoured the Hungarians, while the number of Saxons decreased, and Kolozsvár entered the modern era with a predominantly Hungarian population.
{1-484.} Gyulafehérvár was always a wholly Hungarian town. In the late 14th century, Hungarian peasants began to move in increasing numbers to the mining towns (Dés, Torda, Szék, Kolozs, Abrudbánya, Zalatna, Offenbánya, Torockó), where they eventually formed a majority that assimilated the earlier German population. In the Saxon towns, on the other hand, it was the Hungarians who were assimilated or otherwise disappeared. (In Szászsebes, for example, the onetime Hungarian presence is evoked by the name of Székely Street.) The growing Hungarian presence in many towns was linked to the development of crafts in the Hungarian villages. Lists of villeins, dating from the 15th century, include many surnames that evoke a variety of trades and crafts; such people already possessed the basic elements of an commercial culture when they moved into towns. Thus, at the end of the Middle Ages, Transylvania's urban middle class included not only Germans but also a large proportion of Hungarians. The Romanians, on the other hand, were absent from this early phase of urbanization, the one exception being a merchant colony in Brassó.
The Saxon walled towns that enjoyed full municipal rights included Szeben, Brassó, Beszterce, Segesvár, Szászsebes, later Szászváros, and, at the beginning of the modern age, Medgyes. Their development was strongly influenced by their function as administrative and judicial centres for the Saxon seats and districts. Each town's administration also held sway over the surrounding villages, although the inhabitants played no part in the selection of these officials. Thus the Saxon villagers found that they had merely changed masters, the gerébs being replaced by the wealthy burghers.
Szeben even tried to extend its authority over seats of similar rank. In the case of the towns of Segesvár and Szászsebes, these ambitions were frustrated, but Szeben burghers took over the office of judge in the seats of Szászváros, Újegyháza, Szerdahely, Sink, and Kőhalom. Only in the 16th century did these seats succeed in {1-485.} freeing themselves from the domination of Szeben and secure the right to elect their own judge. A middle class began to emerge in the towns around the middle of the 14th century, but initially it consisted of landowners and merchants, with the artisans remaining in a subordinate status. In 1366, when the gerébs still functioned as town judges, the office of mayor was established in Szeben, Segesvár, and Brassó, essentially to represent the interests of the increasingly prosperous merchant class. As the gerébs gradually faded in importance, so did the office of town judge, leaving the mayors in control of the towns, and therefore of the seats. At the same time, all Saxon towns except Beszterce retained the subordinate office of 'Hann', or village judge (villicus), which dated from their village origins. Beszterce had neither a mayor nor a Hann, but only a town judge. This indicates that although it existed as a Saxon settlement prior to 1241, its development — unlike that of the other Saxon towns — was interrupted by the Mongol invasion. The king therefore had to found a new town, with a fresh population, as he did in the case of Kolozsvár, where the offices of mayor and Hann were equally unknown. Obviously, in both cases the original population had been annihilated by the Mongols.
The Saxons' new ruling elite, the merchants who came to form the urban patrician class, consisted of but a few families, as was the case with the gerébs; and, like the gerébs, they jealously guarded their power. The first

challenge to their dominance came from the artisans, and the result was the introduction, in 1495, of an institution that already flourished in Kolozsvár and other Hungarian cities: the 'Board of a Hundred' (Hundertmannschaft), through which the guilds could make their voice heard in municipal affairs. However, since the board's members were appointed by the town council, which consisted exclusively of patricians, the artisans gained little from the innovation. At the beginning of the 16th century, the efforts of the Hungarian lesser nobility and the Székely commoners to win greater autonomy found an echo among ordinary {1-486.} Saxons, who felt equally oppressed. In 1520, the mayor of Segesvár was killed by disgruntled Saxon peasants. However, neither the urban, lower middle class nor the peasants succeeded in breaking the power of the new ruling elite. Although Hungary's lesser nobility registered some temporary successes, the higher social strata managed to consolidate their hold on power and win the king's support. The lot of villeins and common Székelys took a turn for the worse, and the political and economic subjection of common Saxons to the upper middle class was confirmed. Despite repeated challenges from the lower orders, the patricians invariably prevailed, though sometimes only at the price of bloodshed.
The Saxons' new social order was based on the primacy of the towns. The peasantry felt not only the power of the urban elite but also the economic pressure of the towns, and in this respect the urban lower middle class also gained at their expense. The seats' administrative centres systematically hindered the development of other settlements in their district, notably by reserving to themselves the right to hold public markets. In 1378, Brassó blocked the efforts of Földvár to hold a weekly market; Nagysink did the same to Szentágota in 1379, and Segesvár to Henndorf in 1428. Later, the town guilds also extended their authority, for their masters obtained the right to supervise guild activity in the villages.
Although reality belied the Saxons' principle of equal rights, the lot of the Saxon peasants was still far better than that of villeins in the noble counties or that of the poorer Székelys. The main reason for this was the progressive demilitarization of Saxon society after the withdrawal of the gerébs; the Saxons no longer faced the danger of seeing their society divided between nobles and villeins. Until the end of the Middle Ages, Saxon units continued to serve in the Transylvanian army, but middle-class values spread at the expense of a martial spirit. Fewer and fewer Saxons performed military service; they preferred to commute their obligation, or to pay for Székely and Romanian mercenaries. They walled their towns, {1-487.} fortified their village churches, and preferred, in case of danger, to retrench rather than to engage in open battle. An astute observer of Transylvania, Antal Verancsics, observed in the mid-1500s that the Saxons were anything but a warlike people (militia a maioribus ... degeneravere, pedestres exercent arma, iuxta muros fortissimi, in campo facile cedunt).[20]
The shift from a noble/peasant way of life to a middle-class/peasant pattern coincided with the awakening of Saxon nationalism. The gerébs, as noted, lost their sense of German identity, and the lower orders were also free of such sentiments, but the efforts at emancipation of the urban middle class in the 15th century were accompanied by a rise in national consciousness. To be sure, the Saxons, like the Hungarians, had a sense of community, and that sense was based in part on mother-tongue, but it had more to do with shared social circumstances than with their origins or language, and it did not have a political edge directed at other ethnic groups. By the end of the Middle Ages, however, the Saxon middle class — like the Hungarian lesser nobility — had adopted a passionate and exclusive form of ethnic chauvinism. An early, practical manifestation was the exclusion of non-Saxons from their guilds and towns. The first such measure was taken in 1474, when the town council of Szeben ruled that a Dominican monastery, established in a suburb, could move within the town walls only if and when Germans made up the majority of friars. The Saxon middle class's deepening sense of ethnic identity was instrumental, along with King Matthias's sympathetic support, in the political unification of the Saxons.

NEW STATE The Villeins
{1-675.} The Market Towns of the Region East of the Tisza and the Entrenchment of Calvinism
In the late Middle Ages, Hungary had become integrated into the European trading economy mainly through its agricultural exports. Cattle and wine became the most profitable exports of countries in the Carpathian Basin, and demand for these commodities continued to grow. At the same time, the life of Hungarian villeins underwent significant alteration.
Thanks to favourable economic changes in the second half of the 15th century, villeins found that they could sell their surplus product on the open market. Indeed, as the practice of paying rent in money to landowners became generalized, villeins were driven to produce for the market. The changes put a premium on skill and adaptability, and the result was growing social differentiation among villeins. In the heart of Hungary, on the Great Plain, there were vast areas, devoid of genuine towns, where resourceful villeins turned to crafts and trade; although the products of distant towns were brought to the region's markets, these local producers could sell their simpler goods at a lower price. Other villeins became cattle and wine traders. Since noblemen traditionally despised the world of commerce, and since merchants in distant towns showed little interest in such rustic activities, it was the more prosperous villeins who seized the opportunities presented by the growth in Western demand.
More and more of the ambitious farmer-merchants and villein-craftsmen — along with cotters looking for work moved to market villages, and over time the latter grew into a new type of settlement known as market towns (mezőváros, or, in Latin, oppidum). Under law, the inhabitants remained villeins, obligated to provide services for their landlords and subject to the jurisdiction of the nobiliary courts. However, they were progressively allowed to discharge their obligations by cash payment and to have their internal affairs {1-676.} managed by their own leaders; their economic freedom was protected by the landowners, for it generated greater income for the latter. Handicrafts and the wine and cattle trade enriched these peasant-citizens (civíses). Their cattle herds in the vast hinterland the Great Plains' market towns grew ever larger, and their wines produced in the Hegyalja (Tokaj) region found an eager market.
The participation of these villeins in Europe's agricultural trade was a phenomenon unique in Eastern Europe. In most of the countries of that region, the nobility not only preserved its social eminence but also turned the strong demand for agricultural products to its exclusive advantage. Poland's grain exports came from noblemen's estates that had been adapted to mass production. Villeins were progressively dispossessed of their land, which was turned into noblemen's possessions (allodiums or manors), and the latter's heavy demand for manpower was satisfied by substantial increases in socage service. The nobility thus consolidated its dominant position, which was based on non-economic, master-servant relations. This social pattern was typical of Eastern Europe, and it would remain frozen until the 19th century.
By contrast, the economic consolidation of Hungary's market towns pointed to an alternative model, one in which production for the market was the resort of villeins and not only of nobles. Indeed, the changes in the pattern of vine-growing and cattle-breeding shared some features of the disintegration of the feudal estates in the West. The land left untended by impoverished villeins was leased by the prosperous peasant-citizens; the latter did not have to pay feudal dues to the landlord for such plots.
To be sure, these market towns began to encounter new difficulties after 1500. The nobles of lesser property, who had no market towns, took umbrage when many of their villeins migrated to the market towns of the great landowners. They tried to reverse this tendency and diminish the appeal of the market towns by resorting to new laws, including one that compelled each villein to pay in {1-677.} kind one ninth of his production. They also tried to abrogate the traditional right to free movement. The resulting tensions contributed to the outbreak of the Peasants' War in 1514, and the punitive laws that were passed after that conflict seemingly confirmed the nobility's triumph. However, that war had little practical effect on life in the market towns, which until 1526 continued to grow and

prosper.
When, at the end of the 1520s, Hungary was divided into two parts, the Great Plain, with its prosperous market towns, came under King John's rule, as did — after some minor disturbances — the Hegyalja vine-growing region. Only the southernmost market towns, Szerémújlak and Kamanc, ended up in the Ottoman zone.
When the Szapolyai part of Hungary progressively lost control over many towns and mines, the development of the market towns became a matter of economic urgency. Some data survived regarding a few of the major market towns in the Great Plain to indicate that they continued to develop. The three important market towns belonging to the Gyula estate, Gyula, Simánd, and Békés, were still flourishing in the mid-1500s. The villeins in these towns had no difficulty in paying to their landlord the annual tax of three gold forints (which included both the census tax and commuted deliveries). Socage services remained well below the level enacted in 1514, i.e. one day a week, and the 'ninth' was still payable in cash. The income derived by peasant-citizens from cattle-breeding must have been considerable: estate officials estimated that while the average annual value of the 'ninth' was 1200 forints, the expansion of cattle- and horse-breeding would generate an annual profit of 3000 forints.
Cattle-markets were held with some frequency, and even after the fall of Buda and Szeged, people on the Gyula estate would continue to trade actively with their western neighbours. The Pozsony registers show that around 1540, many cattle-traders from Gyula conducted cross-border business. Crafts were also pursued actively in the market towns, engaging the activity of 28 percent of the population in Gyula, 27 percent in Békés, and 37 per cent in Simánd.
{1-678.} Even in the absence of similar hard data, it is clear that Debrecen's economic development was even more spectacular, and this despite the fact that within fifteen years, the town passed through the hands of four successive landlords (the Szapolyai family, Laski, Gritti, and Bálint Török). Cattle was the town's main source of wealth; this was the period when herds began to proliferate in the Hortobágy and other nearby pastures. Handicraft and trades also flourished, and Debrecen's commercial links reached to Cracow, Vienna, Brünn, and Boroszló.
The major market centres were Debrecen, Gyula, Békés, Simánd, Lippa (which John I elevated to the status of royal free borough), Szatmár, and, more peripherally, Kecskemét, Nagykőrös, and Szeged. Their lead was followed by the many smaller market towns located between the Danube and the Tisza, and east of the Tisza. Collectively, the numerous peasant-citizens of these towns constituted a considerable economic force, and it is scarcely surprising that Szapolyai tried to win their support.
Hungary's disintegration accelerated after King John's death, taking its toll of the network of market towns. In the 1540s, the emerging Principality of Transylvania lost the entire region between the Danube and the Tisza, as well as the counties of Arad, Békés, Csanád, and Csongrád. It retained, in the Temesköz, only the small towns of Lugos and Karánsebes, which were reduced to serve as frontier forts, and in Zaránd county, only the westernmost settlements. The Hegyalja region changed hands several times before being definitively incorporated into the Habsburgs' part of Hungary.
The peasant-citizens had no political rights, and their power was derived from their considerable numbers. The boundaries that were set in 1540–45 divided those numbers into three fragments, each of which was forced to adapt to a different set of circumstances. The most important districts — Kecskemét, Szeged, and Lippa incurred the greatest damage. In the Ottomans' domain, {1-679.} Islamic law took precedence over the traditional Hungarian legal order. It would no longer be possible to fight off tax collectors and other officials by manoeuvring between the king and the landlords: all significant settlements became estates of the Turkish Padishah. The Great Plain bore the brunt of the battles over frontier lines and, when a semblance of peace had returned, of the devastating raids that ensued. Moreover, since the region adjoined the more contested borders, peasant-citizens of its market towns were the most exposed to the burden of double taxation. Debrecen, for instance, was officially part of the Principality of Transylvania, but it lay at the junction of three state borders, and thus, from 1567 onwards, it had to pay an annual tax to Gyulafehérvár (3200 forints) and Istanbul (2000 forints) as well as Pozsony (1000 forints).
The market towns suffered from additional problems, such as insecure trading routes, the multiplication of customs zones, and the commercial reorientation of the West. Coincidentally, tax-rates were raised by the governments and,

https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/110.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:34:18]
at an even faster rate and with greater determination, by the landlords.
Nevertheless, it appears that all these changes did not have a deep impact on the life of the market towns. In the Turkish zone, the market towns' population continued to grow, and their economic activity, notably with regard to cattle, did not decline. This was due in part to the surprising circumstance that the decrease of trade with the West had no palpable effect on the demand for livestock. However, there was another, more important factor helping to sustain the development of many market towns during the second half of the 16th century: the prevailing atmosphere of threat and insecurity.
The unending war, sometimes overt, at other times latent, and the hardship caused by double taxation drove more and more Hungarians to flee the countryside and find refuge in the comparatively secure market towns. This accounts for much of the population growth in such peasant centres as Kecskemét, Nagykőrös, {1-680.} Debrecen, Ráckeve, and Tolna. At the same time, some of the emerging communities of peasant-citizens were themselves preparing to flee if Turkish oppression proved unendurable. This happened in the case of Szeged, a market town recently elevated to the rank of 'royal borough'; after 1552, its population fled to Nagyszombat, Kassa, and Debrecen. Where the people stayed put, as in Gyula, Kecskemét, and Debrecen, they nurtured close contacts with the towns of Upper Hungary, from Pozsony to Kassa; and when they came on visits, it was clear to their welcoming hosts that they were assessing the possibility of moving there. In the process, the market towns lost their wealthiest inhabitants, and neither migrants from the countryside, nor Southern Slav refugees from Serbia, Bosnia, and the former Southern Hungary could fill the gap.
This complex situation had a rather negative impact on Transylvania beyond the Királyhágó, where circumstances did not favour the emergence of large market towns. Negative factors included distance from Western and Polish markets; pastures smaller than on the Great Plain; wines inferior to those of the Hegyalja; the comparative economic backwardness of the region; and, the dense network of Saxon towns. There was little scope for expanding the markets for agricultural produce, and the Saxons did all in their power to constrain initiatives in this direction. For example, in the early 1500s, Brassó engaged in lengthy litigation until it obtained a royal decision abrogating the right of Sepsiszentgyörgy to hold public markets.
To be sure, a few localities managed to exploit their competitive advantage. Thanks to their profitable salt-mines, Torda and Dés consolidated their local economies and gained the status, first, of market towns, and then, in the era of the principality, of full-fledged towns. But these small towns all belonged to the king, and later to the prince; authentic villein settlements never managed to rise to their level. (One of the major marketplaces in non-Saxon Transylvania was Marosvásárhely, a quasi-market town inhabited by people who enjoyed Székely rights.)
{1-681.} The attrition of market towns on the Great Plain and the gradual flight northward of their peasant-citizens deprived the new principality of its economically strongest element, which was perhaps also the most likely to advance socially. Of the market towns that remained under the authority of Gyulafehérvár, only Debrecen could show steady growth. In the mid-1500s, that town, located at a featureless spot in the region east of the Tisza and devoid of fort or river, had close to 1300 tax-paying households, or as many as 20,000 inhabitants. The other market towns that depended on the principality also grew, but remained of little consequence. The two largest were Tasnád and Kraszna; the first had 319 tax-paying family heads in 1569, and the second, 281 in 1594, which indicated that both towns had populations in excess of four thousand.
The decline of the market towns had long-term effects on Transylvania: financial loss, in terms of taxes as well as of investment capital. And there was a cultural loss as well: the intellectual ferment that had accompanied the religious revival gradually waned.
The first, Lutheran wave of the Reformation had swiftly conquered the Saxon towns, where it was linked to the name of Honterus; soon afterwards, it spread to the region east of the Tisza. The civic consciousness of the peasantry had manifested itself in 1514, and it was given new impetus by the trials and tribulations of the 1530s. The more promising sons of peasant-citizens in the prosperous market towns were once sent to pursue their studies at Cracow, Vienna, and Bologna; by the end of the 1530s, they were being directed to Luther's university at Wittenberg.
The returning students helped to propagate the ideas of the Reformation. A remarkable number of the early

Hungarian preachers of Lutheranism were former 'Observant' Franciscans, an order that had played a significant role in the market towns' rebellion in 1514; they included András Szkhárosi Horvát, Imre Ozorai, Mihály Sztárai, and István Benczédi Székely. They had intimate links with {1-682.} the market towns, where most of them were serving as parish priests. The most illustrious of these early preachers, Mátyás Dévai Bíró, began with his ministry at Kassa and Buda, then was a preacher at Debrecen, where he died in ca. 1545; Imre Ozorai came from Tolna; János Gálszécsi preached his last sermon, at Gyula, around 1540; Szkhárosi was active in the same period at Tállya; András Batizi worked at Szikszó, Sátoraljaújhely, and Tokaj; as for István Benczédi Székely, he lived and worked successively in Szikszó, Olaszliszka, and Gönc.
These were years of civil war, when the fate of districts was largely in the hands of their feudal lords. The Reformation could have made no headway among Hungarians without the support of these lords. The master of the Temesköz, Péter Petrovics, established the Lutherans' second diocese in Hungary, after that of the Saxons; and Lutheran ministers from Temesvár, Arad, Makó, and Szeged held synods at Torony in 1549 and 1550. The Lutherans' first Hungarian superintendent, the bishop of the Temesköz, was Máté Gönczi; his name suggests that came from a peasant-citizen family. The Perényi and Drágffy families, whose seats were at Ugocsa and Béltek, and whose estates stretched from Ugocsa to the Szilágyság, offered a refuge from persecution to Ozorai. Hungary's second Lutheran community (after that founded by Honterus) was formed under the auspices of the same families, and particularly of Anna Báthori, the widow of Gáspár Drágffy. The shift to the new doctrine was confirmed by the priests from Szabolcs, Szatmár, Szilágy, and Ugocsa, meeting in a synod on 20 September 1555 at the market town of Erdőd. In the Gyula district, the Patócsy family, who had inherited the Czibak properties, backed the proselytizing work of preachers such as István Szegedi Kis.
The aristocrats' support was undoubtedly an important factor, but it does not account for the popularity of Luther's teachings among peasant-citizens. The reasons obviously included accessibility, for Hungarian was the operative language; the gradual discarding {1-683.} of the pomp and ceremony intrinsic to the feudal world; and a more critical attitude toward secular authority. Another reason was the misery inflicted on Hungary by war, which could be blamed on the 'old world'; Lutherans were disposed to regard such suffering as God's punishment for their forerunners' sinful deviation from true Christianity.
By the end of the 1540s, a good many of the Hungarian peasant-citizens on the Great Plain had converted to Lutheranism. Under John I, the state made little effort to resist the Reformation. György Fráter did not feel secure enough to employ force in defence of his Catholic faith. And the Ottomans, for their part, cared little about the religious disputes of their Christian subjects. If Luther's teachings were nevertheless challenged, it is because the prevailing freedom of thought facilitated further religious reform.
Around 1550, proselytizers for the second, Swiss wave of the Reformation began to appear in Hungary. The ideas of Zwingli and Calvin first reached the region east of the Tisza, and within it, Debrecen, which was then attached to Transylvania. The new doctrine was propagated in Transdanubia by Gál Huszár, in Abaúj and Zemplén counties by Gáspár Károlyi, and in the Turkish-ruled regions by István Szegedi Kis.
In Debrecen, the beginnings of Calvinism may be traced to the final years of the life of Mátyás Dévai Bíró, when the veteran religious reformer dissented from the Wittenberg Theses on some minor theological questions. In 1551, a synod, held at Ladány, of Lutheran preachers in the region east of the Tisza dismissed his successor, Márton Kálmáncsehi Sánta, on grounds of heresy. The latter fled to Ung county, where Péter Petrovics, who had moved to Munkács, offered him safe refuge. In Petrovics's former domain, the Temesköz, the Protestant Church suffered stresses, then disintegrated when the Ottomans took over in 1552. At Munkács, Petrovics continued to back religious innovation, if only in order to give new impetus to his battle against the Habsburgs. In early {1-684.} December 1552, the synod at Beregszász issued the first declaration of Calvinist faith in Hungary.
The proselytizing work of Kálmáncsehi and his friends was greatly facilitated by Petrovics's active support as well as by the country's continuing troubles under Habsburg rule. When Transylvania seceded in 1556, those who were still known as 'Sacramentarians' quickly prevailed throughout the region east of the Tisza. The diocese was reorganized, and Kálmáncsehi became Hungary's first Calvinist bishop, based at Debrecen. The peasant-citizens were attracted by the autonomy of the new Church, and they readily took to the soberly simple Calvinist service. The Lutheran superintendent of the Szatmár district, Demeter Tordai, showed some disposition to favour Sacramentarian doctrine as early as 1555, but he was pressured by his synod, and particularly by the landowner

György Báthori, to repudiate the new bishop. Within a few years, Báthori had followed the example of Petrovics, and churchmen of the Szatmár rallied to the new creed.
Kálmáncsehi's untimely death brought no break in the triumphal spread of Calvinism in the region east of the Tisza. Debrecen's new pastor (later to become superintendent in the region east of the Tisza), Péter Melius Juhász, was young and energetic. Born with a talent for organization, he was also a highly effective preacher and a painstakingly methodical theologian. It was during his tenure that Gál Huszár arrived in Debrecen and established, in the early 1560s, the first printing press in the region east of the Tisza. Gergely Szegedi, Melius's fellow pastor in Debrecen, was perhaps the most poetically-inspired of the era's hymnists and translators of psalms, who also included Sztárai and Szkhárosi. Even Melius produced a few hymns which, while heavy on theology, had some merit.
To be sure, poetry was a minor concern of Melius, whose literary achievement lay more in the realm of sermons, polemical essays, and Biblical exegesis. His often abstruse theses are lightened {1-685.} by a few finely turned phrases, but they are most striking for their intensity. Religious debates in the age of the Reformation were notoriously vehement, but few surpassed Melius's ardent hatred, abusiveness, sarcasm, and fanaticism.
Melius's life was one long struggle against multiple enemies. He fought to eliminate what remained of the Catholic clergy's influence in the districts of Eger and Kassa, he argued with Luther's Hungarian and Saxon followers; and he engaged in spiteful quarrels with the first Anti-Trinitarians who reached Debrecen, then with Ferenc Dávid. Melius wanted to bring an end to the proliferation of doctrines that marked the first thirty years of the Reformation, for he did not wish to transgress the Apostles' Creed, a step that, in his view, had already been taken by Ferenc Dávid and his followers. Wherever he was given authority, he managed to achieve his ends. In 1561, while serving as superintendent in Debrecen, Melius wrote a treatise known as the Debreceni és egervölgyi hitvallás [The Creed of Debrecen and the Eger Valley], and which was essentially adopted six years later at the synod of the region east of the Tisza. Designed to regulate all aspects of life, marked by a thoroughness that was rare in Reformation Europe, the creed regulated not only liturgy, dogma, and Church organization, but also personal and public morality as well as political and economic behaviour of individuals and families.
Although the peasant-citizens of Debrecen wavered at times in their convictions, they never withdrew support from their chief pastor, the man whom his enemies derided as 'Pope Péter'. The seat of the bishop of the region east of the Tisza dominated its region, and the smaller market towns that stretched from Szabolcs to the southern confines of Bihar all followed its lead in matters of religion.
The phase of religious reform in the region east of the Tisza culminated with the synod's ratification of Melius's rigorous doctrines in 1567. Debrecen's desire for order and extensive regulation reflected its sense of isolation, which grew as the region encompassing {1-686.} the market towns became fragmented, as well as the oppressive effect of ongoing wars. The light dimmed to some extent after Melius's death. The great bishop was not only a theologian, a founder of the Church, and a poet and writer; he also translated parts of the Bible and edited the first Hungarian work on herbalism, a contribution noted in the history of medicine. The light dimmed after his death, which came on 15 December 1572. It would be a long time before the region east of the Tisza had another bishop as talented as Melius. The writers and hymnists of the succeeding generation were not without literary merit, but they were mere epigones of Szkhárosi, Gergely Szegedi, and Melius.
This slowdown and turning inward occurred principally in the case of the market towns in the region annexed to Transylvania. At least in the 1560s and 1570s, the area under Turkish occupation displayed a different pattern. There, if only for a short time, the Ottomans' military preponderance offered greater security, and their indifference to Christianity greater latitude for the pursuit of religious reform. The seedlings of Anti-Trinitarianism (which came to be known as Unitarianism) spread from Transylvania and took root in a region stretching from Békés county to Baranya county.
The unsettled atmosphere in the region east of the Tisza gave rise in 1569–70 to a peculiar peasant revolt near Debrecen. Its leader, György Karácsony, was passionate and fanciful demagogue who declared himself to be the new 'black man'. With an unarmed 'holy army', he attacked the Ottomans' fortified position at Balaszentmiklós (Törökszentmiklós). Driven back, Karácsony proceeded to Debrecen, where he tried to incite the poorer strata to challenge higher authority. In the end, the chief magistrate had to appeal for help to Bálint Prépostvári, who led

mounted troops from the Szatmár garrison to disperse the rebellious peasants. Karácsony was executed in Debrecen. The ill-conceived rising, which resulted in needless slaughter, occurred when Péter Melius was at the height of his power, two years before the death of this great reformer.

2. ECONOMY, SOCIETY, AND CULTURE OF THE
NEW STATE The Romanians
{1-687.} The Villeins
Society evolved more slowly in Transylvania than in Hungary, and the class of villeins that had emerged by 1500 displayed a more complex structure. This complexity grew greater when the socially distinctive counties of the Partium were annexed to the new principality.
Transylvania's peasantry encompassed four major and clearly distinguishable strata. Most of the top economic stratum, consisting of the peasant-citizens, became part of Transylvanian society when the region east of the Tisza was annexed. Next on the socioeconomic ladder came the free Saxon peasants and the Székely soldier-peasants. The fourth stratum was the villeins proper, who accounted for the largest share of the agricultural population, and whose numbers increased when the borders were redrawn; this stratum, in turn, was differentiated internally in several important respects.
The law provided for three basic categories of villeinage: villeins with a smallholding or plot (telkes jobbágy), free villeins (szabados), and cotters (zsellér). This did not mean, however, that all people within a category enjoyed the same circumstances of life.
Over time, the variations in family size, quality of land, and agricultural skills (along with the vagaries of fortune) had produced considerable social differentiation among the landed villeins. Although this tendency was reinforced by the market economy that emerged in the latter half of the 15th century, socioeconomic conditions in the former Eastern Hungary, and particularly in Transylvania, did not match the average level in Hungary. By the 15th century, the typical villein in the more developed Hungarian counties disposed of a half-plot of land. In contrast, the proportion of villeins disposing of a whole plot remained high in the new principality's villages well into the mid-1500s. Their proportion stood at 35 percent on the Szamosújvár domain in 1551; 65 percent in the Kővár district in 1556; and at the Erdőd castle estates, in the {1-688.} Partium, 88 percent in 1556, 90 percent in 1569, and 60 percent as late as 1578. It must be noted that since the density of population in Transylvania stood below Hungarian average, the availability of additional cultivable land may have helped to delay the process of subdivision. In any case, animal husbandry (cattle and sheep) played a major role in the economy of this mountainous region, and thus the classification of villeins by plot size cannot serve as the only measure of agricultural activity. Unfortunately, little is known about the villeins' share of animal stock.
As before, the category of freemen included peasants who had been relieved by landowners of all or most of their feudal service obligations. Their case is more complex in Transylvania than in the rest of Hungary. By general custom, the families of villeins who had been selected to serve the landowner as domestics and guards fell into the liber and libertinus categories, as did the families of those who, like butchers and fishermen, practised certain essential skills. For the most part, the magistrates in Hungarian and Saxon villages were granted the same liberties. The leaders (voivodes, krainiks, cnezes) also belonged to the category of freemen, but, as will be noted later, this was a localized phenomenon.
Cotters, the third group, also divided into many types. On most estates, the appellation inquilinus was used in the traditional sense to denote the poor, recent settlers. Elsewhere, especially in the market towns of the Partium, it was often the wealthier villeins who gave up their plots, with the result that many tradesmen and craftsmen who had risen from villeinage to become peasant-citizens remained categorized as cotters. The same was the case with the growing number of peasant intellectuals, the educated deák and literátus or honoratior.
Wealth did not serve as the key dividing line between villeins and cotters any more than it did in the case of smallholders (telkes jobbágy) and freemen. Indeed, the feudal duties borne by the cotters {1-689.} were generally lighter than average. Their services were defined by contract, and their tithes were paid mostly in the form of an agreed tax. At this time, Transylvania had more arable land than skilled cultivators; this not only eased the lot of cotters who sought to work for landowners but also reduced the number of people who actually became cotters. In the 16th century, in Hungary proper, some 25 percent of villeins fell into the inquilinus category, while in the

principality, the proportion hovered between 5 and 20 percent; moreover, the figures for Transylvania included citizen-cotters who lived in the market towns of the Great Plain, some of whom were far different from real cotters.
An examination of the feudal and state dues borne by the villeins reveals even greater differentiation. For example, the tax quota (cenzus) was assigned by village, and individual contributions were determined by the local magistrates, who followed a variety of formulas. The most common basis for tax-assessment was the villein's land; another was the number of draught-oxen, and yet another the size of the plot in the far reaches of the village's hinterland, which was assigned to villeins more or less in accordance with their wealth. Typically, the first two assessment formulas were both in use in districts of Bihar, Szatmár, and Szilágy counties. For example, the land criterion was applied at Szalacs, Margitta, Bogyoszló, and Oláhapáti, and the draught-oxen one at Albis, Ottomány, Újszékely, and Tulogd. The plot-size criterion was adopted first on the Csicsó domain.
In some places, a tax, separate from the cenzus, had to be paid directly to the landowner. In the villages of the Gyalu domain, a 'synod tax' (zsinatadó) or 'whip tax' (ostoradó) had to be paid in cash and cattle. On the Somlyó estate, the landowner levied a tax (fertonpénz) to cover the salary of the counts. People in the Kővár district had to pay 'garden tax' (kertadó) or 'ako money' (akopénz).
{1-690.} The Gyalu 'whip tax' may have involved payment in kind, but the basic cenzus tax had been and remained a cash levy. The amounts varied by district, and even by village, but they consistently fell below the level prescribed in a 1514 law, one forint per villein family.
This situation was not altered by the currency's depreciation in the second half of the century. In fact, since most districts saw little change in the nominal amount of the cenzus tax, the villeins' real tax burden grew lighter. Nagybánya, a princely mining town, paid 150 forints in 1566, and the figure was the same in 1578; the market town of Tasnád was assessed some 1000 forints in both 1569 and 1589; and the villages on Kolozsmonostor estate collectively paid 180 forints in 1580 and 1599 alike. What's more, the diverse supplementary levies gradually disappeared in the last decades of the 16th century.
There was similar diversity in the system of payment in kind (munera) applied to the villeins of the emerging state. All landowners demanded oats, and some took wheat as well. The compulsory delivery of poultry, swine, sheep, eggs, honey, vegetables, fruit, and firewood varied in pattern and amounts from place to place. Like the cenzus, these levies were relatively modest, although they showed a slow but steady increase up to the end of the 16th century.
There was less flexibility and local variation in the 'ninth' (which actually meant the ninth tenth, and therefore amounted to a tenth) of agricultural output that had to be delivered to the landowner. The anti-villein laws of 1514 made this levy general and compulsory, a provision confirmed in 1549 by the Transylvanian diet, but the practical application took some time. Up until the 1550s, the 'ninth' was collected only on some estates in the Partium, notably those belonging to the Báthori family at Csehi, Kővár, and Somlyó, where the amount of grain to be delivered was far less than the prescribed one tenth. On the vast and rich domain of Gyula, the total {1-691.} value of the 'ninth' collected around 1526–27 amounted to no more than 450–460 forints. Over time, the collection of the 'ninth' became more generalized and systematic. In 1562, the 'ninth' accruing to the landowner at Gyula amounted to close to 2000 forints, although this probably covered more than twelve months.
The tax most widely levied in earlier times, the tithe (dézsma), remained in effect over the period of Hungary's dismemberment. As before, it served to finance the Church, and it was applied to virtually all agricultural products, such as grain, fruit, wine, and swine. The exemption of non-Catholic Romanians remained in force. The first changes owed not to the Reformation but to political necessity. When János Statileo, bishop of Gyulafehérvár, died in 1542, György Fráter directed that the tithes of the diocese revert to the state. The tithes of Fráter's bishopric, at Várad, also went to the public purse. Although the Habsburgs restored the status quo ante after Martinuzzi's death, the tithes were permanently assigned to the state after the 1556 secession. The measure fell readily to hand, for as noted — the birth of the Transylvanian state coincided with the triumph of the Reformation.
The change in beneficiary scarcely affected the villeins, for the method of collection remained unaltered. The local landowners contracted to pay the tithe to the state, much as they had done earlier with the bishops, and then raised the set amount from their peasants.



The Villeins
https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/111.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:34:29]
Landowners in the Partium and Transylvania adopted a variety of approaches to socage (robot). This practice was also regulated by an 1514 law, which specified that one day a week, or 52 days a year were to devoted to the 'lord's work'. However, practice did not follow prescription even in pre-partition Hungary. In the turbulent era of Ottoman expansion, the socage service demanded by a landlord was influenced by tradition, the circumstances of the moment, and the growing disposition of villeins to migrate — an act that was now officially termed escape.
{1-692.} Transylvanian diets never tried to regulated socage or other villein services, for the legislators hewed to the traditional view that landlord and villein should work out their relations without state interference. They were so wedded to this principle that they never applied the 1514 legislation, although theoretically it continued to apply to them as well.
Thus, up to the mid-1500s, the practice of socage was as varied as that of the other burdens of villeinage. On some estates and domains, socage was assigned on the basis of family heads; on others, ploughs or draught animals served as the measure. Socage in villages was different from that in market towns, where villeins tended to commute their obligation. The obligation was variously measured in terms of the size of ploughland, vineyard, and hayfield, or of working days. The following data, taken from the register of the Gyula domain, serve to illustrate the prevailing practice.
In ca. 1525, the villeins were obligated to cut hay twice a year and to harvest grain crops — together with the cotters — for one day. In addition, they had to provide eight men each night to guard the castle. Villagers in the four settlements closest to Gyula had to look after transporting the produce, and the merchants in Gyula were responsible for the ferrying of wine.
In 1554, on the same domain, many villages were required to take full responsibility for cultivating one to two hectares and delivering the produce. In certain other villages, the prescribed socage work lasted two to four days a year. In yet others, it was specified that villeins who owned a plough had to till a quarter hectare of land, sow it with seed provided by the landowner, and harvest the crop; in addition, they had to cut hay seven days each year.
This relatively favourable situation began to change rapidly in the mid-1500s. At the domain of Fogaras, back in 1508, villeins were only required to deliver two cart-loads of firewood, and to cut and deliver hay for two days; by 1570, they were also required to do three days of harvesting. In addition to their other complaints, {1-693.} the villeins protested in 1596 at being required to do additional work, notably sowing, for the landowner. The market town of Csehi, in the Szilágyság, is a case in point. In 1556, when the landowner was the last of the Drágffy family, villeins were only expected to provide cartage for the castles of Erdőd and Kővár; then Gáspár Drágffy began to demand ploughing and harvesting services. His successor as landowner, György Báthori, introduced a more radical change: he sold Drágffy's ploughs and had his fields ploughed by villeins for no pay.
Peasants on Báthori's other estates also voiced protests. At Béltek, another property inherited from the Drágffy family, the villeins complained that he expected all the cultivation of his lands to be done as socage service, a departure from earlier practice, and that he even required them to tend his vineyards, a task that under Drágffy had been done by wage-labour. Moreover, Báthori did not define the extent of corvée; instead, he insisted that the villeins perform services 'according to ability' (pro facultate), which in practice meant at his pleasure.
If György Báthori was a hard taskmaster, he did not present an exception. His social peers, the barons and common nobles, acted likewise, though it took a few years for some of them to adopt his methods. Throughout the country, socage service, once precisely delimited, was transmuted into compulsory work, 'according to ability', at the lord's discretion. The former restriction of corvée to specific tasks, such as ploughing, harvesting, and cartage, was progressively eliminated. The setting of time limits to corvée also became less common; instead, the landowners would prescribe the amount of work, or the area of land to be cultivated. By the end of the century, many landowners demanded that villeins devote one third of their time to unpaid service. The most common practice was to have the villeins work for their landowner every third week — twice the amount of corvée that Werbőczy had vainly tried to impose.
{1-694.} The pattern was far from uniform, for while feudal services were generally increased, the practical application varied from estate to estate. The extent of corvée was adapted to the size of cultivable land, the quality of the soil, the variety of grain, and even the capability of the villeins. And there was an additional factor, one that



The Villeins
https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/111.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:34:29]
had nothing to do with the necessities of agricultural production: the constant danger of war, which required consolidation of Transylvania's borders and strategic defences.
The 16th century was the age of castle-building in Hungary, and Transylvania followed suit. The manpower for raising the forts, castles, and palaces could only be drawn from the peasantry. Thus, particularly along the fortified frontier zone, corvée came to encompass not only cultivation and cartage but also construction work. This was one of the grievances raised by villeins against György Báthori; in the 1560s, complaints at compulsory construction work also surfaced on the Gyula domain and in the Fogarasföld.
Concurrently with the increases in corvée, the villeins' freedom to migrate also came under constraints. The first step had come with the 1514 statute, which imposed a general prohibition of migration, but the provision remained a dead letter during the fifteen years or so before the disintegration of Hungary. In 1530, King John I had the act rescinded by the diet, and the diet of the Habsburg kingdom followed suit in 1550.
In 1536, the diet in Várad had reconfirmed Szapolyai's statute, but his successors paid no heed. After 1556, it was the act nullifying the 1514 prohibition that became a dead letter. The landowners considered that villeins were bound to the land and refused to let the state interfere in such private matters.
Even the resort to force could not erase traditions favouring the peasantry in the areas of Transylvania that bordered on the Romanian principalities. These districts, bounded by mountains, had considerable reserves of arable land, and their local administrative {1-695.} structures were comparatively primitive. There, peasants were traditionally free to migrate and to sell or exchange their land. (As elsewhere, permission had to be obtained from the landowner, who retained the ultimate right of disposal over the villeins' land; the only exceptions to this rule were lands for clearing, which had always been considered freely disposable, and lands that had been freely purchased.)
The most uniformly applied of the villein's burdens was the basic state tax (the dica), and, for a long time, the basic operation of this levy remained unaltered. Villeins whose assets reached a certain level (three forints in 1543, and six forints in 1552) were entered on tax rolls. At first, the tax rate per 'gate' (kapu, porta, rovás) was rather low, 60 denars in 1545, and around one forint after 1550. By all accounts, draught animals served as the basic measure of assets. In 1552, a pair of oxen were valued at six forints; this served as the benchmark for evaluating other breeds, so that, for example, a villein would have to own at least fifty sheep before he was made liable to the tax.
The state also imposed various special levies. The old war-tax (subsidium) was mostly abandoned or merged with the dica; in its place, the government instituted levies to pay for its mercenary troops, the operation of border forts, and the tribute to the Ottomans. These taxes were paid both in cash and in kind; for the sultan's tribute, each 'gate' was levied a half measure (ejtel) of butter and half a butt (köböl) of flour. These extra levies amounted to 2.50–3 forints, the price of an ox around 1550, and considerably less than the value of the services provided to the landowners.
In the last third of the 16th century, the fiscal burden imposed on villeins began to get heavier. The rate set in 1552 — one forint, collected twice a year — remained in effect until 1578, but in the interim, the number of taxpayers fell off, for only villeins whose assets were equivalent to four or more oxen came to be put on the tax rolls. Concurrently, the government imposed numerous supplementary {1-696.} levies. A new war-tax initially added 1520 denars to the one-forint dica, but this surtax rose to 50 denars in 1575, 75 denars in 1590, and in 1592–93, on the eve of the Fifteen Years' War, to one forint. The additional 'sultan's tax' was collected irregularly; between 1577 and 1588, the cash value of each contribution by a 'gate' was never less than 50 denars. Finally, the state launched several major building projects in this period, and it repeatedly resorted to special levies, e.g., in 1571, 70 denars for Várad and 30 denars for Szászsebes.
Hungary's customary law, requiring villeins to keep arms and, according to certain ratios, to serve as soldiers, not only remained in force but was further refined. The 1514 laws prescribed a partial disarmament of the villeinage, but this clause, like the others, was widely disregarded. The Transylvanian diets subsequently restored the earlier provision for general conscription. In 1545, one taxpaying villein in ten, and from 1551, one in sixteen, could be recruited, armed and mounted, for military service. Sources indicate that these villein soldiers ended up in their landowner's military unit (bandérium), much as they had once served in the local militia.



The Villeins
https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/111.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:34:29]
In 1575, the ratio of military service was raised to two out of sixteen villeins, one mounted, the other a foot soldier. The cost of equipping and maintaining these soldiers was borne by the villeins collectively. In 1578, the diet slightly reduced this heavy burden, changing the ratio to two soldiers for every twenty taxpaying 'gates'.
The villeins' other form of military service was participation in a 'national rising'. According to common law, every able-bodied man had to take up arms when circumstances demanded it, and Transylvania's diets repeatedly reinforced this prescription. At its meeting at Torda in March 1542, the diet ruled that in the event of a national rising, only one peasant in ten could stay home. Another regulation, enacted in 1552, required that each twenty villein-soldiers bring along a cartful of food. Moving in the other direction, {1-697.} the diet in 1557 ruled that only one villein in two was obliged to participate in a national rising. In 1562, John Sigismund abrogated the law on national risings and required, instead, that the three 'nations' maintain mercenary forces; but two years later, he reinstituted the requirement for mass participation, and, in 1565, detailed regulations were issued regarding the equipment of such troops. At its 1566, 1568, 1573, and 1578 sessions, the diet did not deal with the question of mass conscription, and when war with the Ottomans erupted in 1594, it merely recommended that the peasants be armed.
The reasons for the gradual disappearance of the policy of 'national rising' are evident. The century had seen demonstration of the superiority of trained and experienced, professional soldiers. Their efficacy in combat far surpassed that of the untrained and generally ill-equipped peasant conscripts.
However, the resulting changes in Transylvania did not eliminate the villeins' military obligation, for the local militias proved to be a handy and useful adjunct to the regular forces. Indeed, when Prince Stephen Báthori introduced a series of reforms in 1575, he prescribed that conscripts don green uniforms, that militiamen be kept in a constant state of readiness, and that the units be inspected twice a year. Predictably, the villeins in these units were reluctant to resume their feudal duties, and preferred to try their luck as professional soldiers in a castle garrison, or in the guards regiment of the prince or some magnate.
Transylvania's rulers understood that only professional soldiers could constitute an effective army, and that the local militias were, at best, a semi-professional force. John Sigismund already had chosen to maintain a permanent armed complement by his side, a decision that led to the war-levy known as the subsidium. In those days, European armies were full of German, Moravian, Swiss, Spanish, Walloon, and Italian professional soldiers, but since few of them strayed as far as Transylvania, the principality's rulers had {1-698.} to find mercenaries closer to home, primarily among the nobility, Székelys and Serbs, and the villeins. The local militias served as a good training ground for peasants who aspired to join the mercenary forces.
Through these adaptations, the villeins' tradition of armed service led to the emergence of a new category of freeman. By century's end, the units where peasant soldiers, progressively freed of feudal obligations, were serving acquired the distinctive names 'guardsmen' (darabontok) and 'riflemen' [puskások]. The government saw this as a positive development. The peasant soldiers had severed their links with the villeins but had no access to the nobility. They provided the principality with a cheap fighting force, one that, thanks to its lack of social ties, would obey their sovereign in all circumstances.
In sum, the only aspect of the villeins' burden that grew lighter in real terms was the cash contribution to landowners, and this was largely counter-balanced by heavier state taxes. All the other feudal services increased slowly in the case of payments in kind, rapidly in the case of corvée. The prohibition of migration added to the vicissitudes of villeins. This was also a period in which attempts were made to expand the manorial lands, and while the tendency was short-lived, the villeins did lose some of their most productive land.
In some cases, traditions that were peculiar to Transylvania and the Partium made the picture less dismal. It is clear that despite a worsening of conditions, the villeins were not reduced to misery. A parallel may be drawn between their situation and one of the innovations of the times, the 'tavern monopolies'. The landowner could impose his exclusive right to operate taverns, but his own vineyards could not supply sufficient wine; most of the taverns' wine had to be purchased from the villeins, who thus lost only the retailer's profit margin.
It remains that from the mid-1500s, the villeins' life became more difficult and more vulnerable to the landowners interference. {1-699.} The typical Transylvanian villein had not been able to enter the emerging market economy, and

the possibility of such participation had only dimmed. To a growing extent, his surplus produce, tiny cash revenue, and labour were expended in meeting the demands of landowner and state. There was no apparent escape from his deepening dilemma. The alienation of the more soldierly villeins from their agricultural society only reduced the possibility of a non-economic challenge to the status quo.
Mired in backwardness and facing growing problems, Transylvania's villeins were victims and passive observers when, in the second quarter of the 16th century, Transylvania suffered catastrophe and was reborn as a new state. Peasants had no political function in the feudal society, and the activity of peasant-citizens in the market towns of the region east of the Tisza remained an isolated exception to this rule. Nor did Transylvania's villeins play a spontaneous or active part in religious reform; they were drawn to the Reformation by the example or forceful measures of landowners and towns. Even the Transylvanian market towns that won full town status (Dés, Torda, Marosvásárhely, and Nagybánya) accepted preachers only after some delay, in the 1550s.

Prelude: The Disintegration of Medieval Hungary
1. FROM THE EASTERN HUNGARIAN KINGDOM TO THE PRINCIPALITY OF TRANSYLVANIA
The Prelude to Transylvanian Statehood
{1-601.} Transylvania in the Decade of Disintegration
King John ruled over a state with uncertain borders, and one that was beset with chronic domestic problems. Transylvania was no better equipped to strengthen central authority than the other counties that remained under King John's rule.
Although the new king had once served as Transylvania's voivode, this scarcely enhanced the province's role in the new situation. In 1526–27, during the transitional period of consolidation, Transylvania's three 'nations' readily accepted the new ruler and his government. The Saxon towns and the Székelys may have made some tentative overtures to the Habsburgs, but this was of no immediate consequence. Although Szapolyai transferred a few of his underlings from the voivode's chancellery to Buda — the onetime treasurer, Miklós Kőrösy, became the king's secretary — he left most of them in their former posts. Perhaps he wanted these trusted followers to keep an eye on Péter Perényi, the influential aristocrat whom he had appointed as voivode (1526–29). The fact is that Szapolyai's reform of the Transylvanian chancellery — in terms of which the secretary performed administrative functions, and the prothonotary, juridical functions — was preserved unaltered. There is no evidence that King John ever gave preference to the province; his policy was that of the unified Hungarian ruling elite, and he aimed to serve the interests of the whole country.
The impact of the king's campaigns on Transylvania in 1527–28 has already been noted. The resurgence of war in late 1528 also had repercussions beyond Királyhágó. Ferdinand I's efforts to impose his rule were no more effective here than elsewhere in Hungary. The agents of his envoy, Reicherstorffer, instituted a reign of terror in the Saxon towns to squash any sign of disobedience. They even threatened the royal judge at Szeben, Markus Pemflinger, who was unflinchingly loyal to the Habsburgs. Péter Perényi, who retained the post of voivode, could get along with neither {1-602.} the Saxons nor the province's nobility. To make matters worse, Ferdinand intended to settle German mercenaries in the province, with the cost to be borne by the local population. The only significant military action by Transylvanians against the party of King John, in the fall of 1528 near Lippa, had no lasting consequence.
By that time, Szapolyai had returned from Tarnów and taken under his control the roads linking Buda to Transylvania. Acting on instructions from the Ottomans, the Moldavian ruler Petru Rareş launched attacks on the Székelyföld. In May 1529, the count of Temes, Bálint Török, arrived with his troops to lend a hand to the Habsburg supporters, but on 22 June, at Földvár (near Brassó), he was defeated by the Moldavians. In a series of minor battles, and through negotiation, John I's governor (and, in 1530–34, voivode), István Báthori of Somlyó, put an end to the resistance of Ferdinand's followers. The majority of Székelys changed sides and rallied to King John at the time of the battle at Földvár. The forces of Báthori and of his Transylvanian lieutenant, Gotthárd Kun, compelled the towns of Gyulafehérvár, Kolozsvár, and Beszterce to pledge allegiance to King John. Only the Saxons stood by King Ferdinand, and in late 1529, they held out against an offensive launched from the two Romanian principalities. However, in the summer of 1530, a Hungarian-Romanian-Turkish force laid siege and obtained the surrender of Brassó, and Segesvár surrendered the following January, leaving Nagyszeben as the last locus of Saxon resistance. The last Transylvanian magnate to support the Habsburgs, István Maylád, rallied to King John in early 1532, but the Saxons of Szeben continued to hold out; only on 1 March 1536 did they finally offer allegiance to King John. After 1529, Ferdinand could do little to assist his supporters in Transylvania. His one major initiative, in January 1536, was an offensive directed at Szatmár and led by Kristóf Kávásy, the castellan of Huszt, and Boldizsár Tallóci Bánffy; the campaign did precipitate the death of Gotthárd Kun, but it ended in utter defeat.
{1-603.} In these protracted battles, the various social forces in Transylvania essentially neutralized each other. The war against the Saxons was led mainly by Transylvanian-Hungarian nobles loyal to King John. The Székelys wavered in their allegiance; since 1519–21, Szapolyai had not enjoyed much popularity among them, and some

Székelys remained ever ready to turn against the Hungarian king. Although Transylvania was the part of onetime Hungary most remote from Vienna, and although its borders were relatively easy to defend, its society was too divided to allow the province to become a power-base for King John. The domestic troubles that beset Transylvania had a feudal character, yet in the end they culminated in a generally pro-Szapolyai orientation. This process was similar to that in other areas of Hungary, where feudal lords vied for local power. The pattern was revealed most vividly in a series of events that occurred in 1534, and which at the time were considered to be highly significant.
When, in 1528–29, King John attempted to restore his rule in Hungary, he found himself burdened by many liabilities: dependence on the Ottomans, a divided country, the unreliability of the political elite, and personal guilt at having miscalculated the balance of forces. His actions only deepened the divisions. On 25 December 1530, at a hastily convened diet in Buda (the same meeting that restored the right of free migration), he appointed as governor a Venetian-Turkish financier named Alvise (Lodovico) Gritti. The latter, a confidant of Grand Vizier Ibrahim, was a major supplier of the Turkish armies and a veteran of Hungarian-Turkish negotiations. The choice was probably driven by a mixture of motives. The king wanted to share his heavy burden of responsibility and hoped that the Italian would facilitate negotiation with the Sublime Porte. He also counted on the wealthy Gritti to contribute to the royal treasury and to lease and revive the faltering mining industry.
{1-604.} In the event, Gritti's ambitions surpassed the king's expectations. He wanted to become the master of Hungary, initially by drawing on the sultan's support, and then by playing off Vienna against the Porte. In the spring of 1534, after a longer stay in Istanbul that left him politically weakened, Gritti headed back to Hungary with a Turkish army. When he entered Transylvania at Brassó, those of King John's supporters who had been preparing to oppose Gritti took fright, and some of them defected to Ferdinand, but Transylvania remained generally calm.
This mood of apprehensive calm was soon disturbed by the governor, and even more by his Hungarian followers, notably Orbán Batthyány and János Dóczy. At their instigation, Imre Czibak, Bishop of Várad and one of King John's most respected and popular followers, was murdered on 12 August 1534 near Brassó.
The nobility of Transylvania and Bihar county reacted in fury. Czibak's nephew, Ferenc Patócsy, called for a popular rising. At this moment, the post of voivode was vacant; Báthori had died, and his associate Hieronym Łaski, appointed in 1532, had been imprisoned on charges of being in Gritti's camp. The feudal orders chose King John's faithful soldier, Gotthárd Kun, as captain general, and after some hesitation, he led an army to confront Gritti. Soldiers from all parts of Transylvania (except Szeben, still in opposition) rallied to his army, which encircled the advancing forces of Gritti at Medgyes. Gritti sent a plea for help to the Voivode of Moldavia, Peter (who, following his intervention in 1529, had acquired Csicsó, Bálványos, and Beszterce); instead, Peter shifted allegiance and joined the Hungarians who were besieging Gritti's camp.
King John was now in a dilemma. If he disowned his governor, he would invite the wrath of the Ottomans; but if he lent assistance to Gritti, he would enrage his own supporters. Upon reflection, he decided that discretion was the better part of valour. Accompanied by a small force of cavalry, he waited in Várad until, {1-605.} on September 28, the Hungarians overwhelmed the defenders of Medgyes, putting the governor and most of his Turkish troops to the sword.
These events in Transylvania promised to influence Hungary's future, for everyone thought that after Gritti's demise, the sultan and the grand vizier would sever ties with their Hungarian partisans. King John, for his part, expected the worst, and he sent emissaries to Emperor Charles V with an offer to relinquish the throne. But the danger did not materialize. At first, the sultan was disposed to investigate the fate of his questionably loyal subordinate, Gritti; but once the Grand Vizier Ibrahim had fallen from favour and been executed (15 March 1536), the matter was dropped. The significant consequences of the Medgyes affair lay elsewhere. First, Imre Czibak's bishopric was assigned to the Pauline friar Utiešenović, otherwise known as György Martinuzzi, or, simply, Friar György (György Fráter), who was to become Szapolyai's chief adviser. Second, it had become clear that the Emperor was not prepared to help Hungary against the Ottomans even if King John himself requested it. The latter's offer of resignation has been conditional on the provision by the empire of adequate garrisons for the country's key fortresses; but Charles V, embroiled in recurrent wars with the French, understandably refused to take on this responsibility. Negotiations with the imperial court came to an inconclusive end in the summer of

1536.
If Transylvanians played a leading role in the events of 1534, this did not reflect the emergence of a sense of regional identity. There were few signs of such consciousness over the preceding hundred years, and even as the country was torn apart, it would be years before such particularistic sentiments materialized. The disintegration of medieval Hungary gathered speed and reached a critical point in 1538. Much as in 1534, Transylvania would play a prominent role without determining the course of events.

Kolozsvár and the Anti-Trinitarians
Only one town in Transylvania, Kolozsvár, managed to escape stagnation. Having ceased long before to be part of the Saxon community, Kolozsvár had a predominantly Hungarian-speaking population by the beginning of the 1500s. By the end of the century, the town, with its 8000 inhabitants, was rivalling Brassó in population. It was home to thirty active guilds and over sixty different crafts. Kolozsvár's exceptionally rapid development can be attributed in the main to three factors. The first two have to do with economic geography. Northern Transylvania's urban network was less dense as that of the Szászföld, and thus Kolozsvár enjoyed a greater home market than did its rivals in the south. Moreover, the town was situated at the junction of the roads from Várad and Kassa, the principal trade routes between the principality and the West. Although {1-671.} that trade was in decline, the town nevertheless derived significant benefit from its strategic location.
The third factor was rooted in politics. In 1558, Kolozsvár was granted staple rights by Queen Isabella. This predominantly Hungarian town's support for the Szapolyai cause probably helped to earn the privilege. Thus trade with the West came largely under the control of Kolozsvár's burghers. The town's astute merchants also managed to take advantage of the appearance in Transylvania of Balkan traders — the same people who provoked the ire of Saxon. Kolozsvár helped these traders to get around the staple rights of Szeben, Brassó, and Beszterce, and this naturally induced the foreigners to conduct business in the city.
Thus Kolozsvár enjoyed a stronger and more sustained economic revival than that of the Saxon towns, and this was reflected in its physical transformation. Wealthy patricians raised palatial residences in the inner city. The town also benefited from the fact that the prince's court often took up residence within its walls, or at nearby Kolozsmonostor and Gyalu; the buildings erected for this purpose served as models and training ground for the town's architects, whose designs would come to display distinctive, local motifs.
The evolution of public tastes is visible even today in such splendid edifices as the Wolphard-Kakas house and in internal furnishings that, like those in the Saxon region, were gaining in elegance. Kolozsvár's goldsmiths also began to rival their Saxon counterparts.
Predictably, the flowering of material culture spurred a new dynamism in the realm of ideas. The first winds of the Reformation reached bilingual Kolozsvár not long after Honterus's return to Transylvania. In 1544, one of the town's parishes was taken over by Kaspar Helth, a Saxon and enthusiastic disciple of Luther. He married within the year, and soon succeeded in attracting many of the townsfolk to the new faith. Since the majority of his congregation {1-672.} was Hungarian, Helth delivered most of his sermons in Hungarian. His works were published exclusively in that language, and he even Magyarized his name, to Gáspár Heltai.
Two smaller, nearby towns, Torda and Dés, soon followed Kolozsvár's lead in welcoming the Reformation. Saxon and Hungarian towns were so powerfully affected by the Reformation that, in May 1548, the diet at Torda enacted a bill confirming the right of all Transylvanians to freely chose their religion, be it Roman Catholic or Lutheran. That was, in the context of contemporary Europe, an uncommonly tolerant edict, and one that gave new impetus to religious reform among Hungarians as well as Saxons. In 1550, Heltai, assisted by the printer György Hoffgreff, established a printing press in Kolozsvár — the third in the principality, and the first to produce books in the Hungarian language. He published numerous important books on religious reform, including his own writings. His biggest project, a Hungarian translation of the Bible, drew many young and enthusiastic pastors to this clergyman. A notable disciple, though not one of the Bible translators, was a young preacher, also of German origin, who also wrote and preached mostly in Hungarian: Franz Hertel, or, by his Hungarian name, Ferenc Dávid.
One milestone in this religious revival came in 1554, when Hungarian Lutherans established a separate Church. Its first superintendent was a onetime monk named Tamás, but two years later he was succeeded as bishop by Ferenc Dávid. The Reformation made slower progress among Hungarians than among Saxons. At Kolozsvár, the Franciscans' monastery was still in operation in 1556, and many of the townsfolk remained true Roman Catholics.



Kolozsvár and the Anti-Trinitarians
https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/109.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:34:52]
However, while, in 1553, the Saxon Universitas had opted definitively for Lutheranism, the Hungarian citizens of Kolozsvár followed with growing interest the successive waves of the Reformation.
{1-673.} By the time Ferenc Dávid was chosen bishop, the 'Sacramentarians', followers of Calvin and Zwingli, had appeared in Transylvania. For a few years, Dávid ardently defended his Lutheran convictions. Then, in the course of a heated debate with Péter Melius Juhász, a leading Sacramentarian who had made many converts in the region east of the Tisza, Dávid had a change of heart; in 1559, he resigned as superintendent and joined the Calvinists. Always receptive to new religious ideas, Kolozsvár's Hungarians soon followed the example of their favourite preacher. Heltai, too, joined the Sacramentarians, and in 1564, at Nagyenyed, the synod of Transylvania's Hungarian preachers once again elected Dávid as bishop.
Motivated partly by a personal interest in religious matters, and partly by the importance he attached to the Transylvanian Hungarians' church, the 'elected king' John Sigismund appointed Dávid, the Hungarian Bishop of Kolozsvár, as his court chaplain. It was at the royal court that Dávid made the acquaintance of John Sigismund's physician, Giorgio Blandrata (Biandrata). The latter was an exponent of the latest manifestation of religious innovation: in emulation of Miguel Servet, a Spanish natural scientist, and his followers, Blandrata denied that God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit were consubstantial. The Anti-Trinitarians were also distinguished by a strong disposition to use scientific tools — logic and the critical analysis of texts — in their study of the Bible.
His debates with Blandrata had a profound influence on Dávid's religious outlook. In around 1568, he came to deny that Jesus was God's equal, and soon the people of Kolozsvár followed suit, as did John Sigismund. Transylvania became a gathering ground, and Kolozsvár, a key stronghold of this newest sect. Prominent AntiTrinitarians from across Europe would make the journey to the town, notably the Germans Johannes Sommer and Christian Francken, and the Greek Jacobus Palaeologus.
{1-674.} Thus Kolozsvár emerged as one of Europe's cultural centres. Heltai's publishing activities reached a high level by the end of the 1550s. When Hoffgreff died in 1559, he took sole charge of the uniquely productive press; until 1565, he would continue to publish (along with other religious works) translated fragments of the Bible, although unfortunately the project was not completed. Most of Ferenc Dávid's theoretical and polemical works, which also had some literary merits, were published by Heltai. Meanwhile, secular literature was also being published, winning a growing readership. Heltai printed some of Sebestyén Tinódi's poems, as well as the Hungarian translation of Werbőczy's Tripartitum, which had been published earlier in Debrecen. He himself wrote some secular works, notably Száz fabula [A Hundred Fables]; 1566, which counts as the first major piece of narrative prose published in Hungarian. Heltai's last work, Chronica, published posthumously in 1574, is the first true work of history in Hungarian. One of the earliest examples of Hungarian drama also dates from the emergence of Anti-Trinitarianism in Transylvania: Válaszúti komédia [A Comedy at the Crossroads], a literary pearl, inspired by religious debates, and suffused with the spirit of Ferenc Dávid.
By the 1560s, the effervescence in the Hungarian towns contrasted sharply with the stagnation that prevailed in Saxon towns. However, Kolozsvár's remarkable revival was soon dampened by economic and social factors. The troubles started during the reign of Stephen Báthori, a Catholic, when measures were taken against the AntiTrinitarians. In the 1580s, Kolozsvár began to turn inward, much like Szeben, Brassó, and the other Saxon towns had done two or three decades earlier. The economy slowed, then was dealt a devastating blow by the 'long war' that began in 1593. Those events were the prelude of another era.

The Villeins 2. ECONOMY, SOCIETY, AND CULTURE OF THE
NEW STATE The Disintegration of the Székely Community
The Romanians
As a result of the fortunes of war against the Ottomans and Habsburgs, the new state of Transylvania came to encompass all the Romanian-inhabited regions of the former Kingdom of Hungary. These included, in addition to the original Transylvanian districts (the Southern Carpathian valleys, the Fogaras, and the Hátszeg), the southern part of Máramaros county, the mountains of Bihar, Zaránd, and Arad counties, and the eastern part of the Temesköz.
The progressive shift from seasonal migration to permanent settlement, from shepherding to farming, and from the mountains to the plain continued into the 16th century. These changes in {1-700.} ifestyle were actively facilitated by the powerful landlords, and in some cases they led to a change of language and religion. Since this process of assimilation occurred free of any compulsion, it is difficult to trace the fate of Romanians who settled among Saxons or Hungarians and adopted the life of villeins.
If this internal movement reduced the number of identifiable Romanians, the strong wave of immigration from the Romanian principalities that began in the last third of the 16th century had the opposite effect. However, the details of this second movement are equally difficult to reconstruct.
The expansion of the Ottoman empire after 1526 brought about not only Hungary's fragmentation but also the lasting subjection of Moldavia and Wallachia. The outward form of subjection did not change, for Romanian rulers continued as vassals who paid tribute, but Turkish interference acquired a different character. When Hungary collapsed, the principalities lost a neighbour which, while also demanding fealty, served to counterbalance the ambitions of the Sublime Porte. Poland, too, had entertained designs on Moldavia, but Turkish arms prevailed.
The principalities would find no rulers who measured up to the impetuous Petru Rareş, or to Radul (Radu de la Afumaţi), who devised anti-Ottoman strategies with Louis II and his successors.
In the contest for the Moldavian and Wallachian thrones, ambitious boyars foolishly vied for Istanbul's support by promising to increase the tribute. The Porte took advantage of these internal rivalries to tighten its grip on the principalities, where it already had permanently-stationed garrisons. The posts of voivode were given to the most submissive boyars, and even they were replaced every few years to forestall a consolidation of their power. In the 16th century, there was a 64-year period when Wallachia was ruled in succession by nineteen boyars, only two of whom died of natural causes. Meanwhile, the tribute paid to the Porte kept getting larger and larger.
{1-701.} Misery is always a strong inducement to migrate, but the peasants of the two principalities were uncommonly susceptible to the lure of distant refuge. Although a majority of them lived off agriculture, their shift to cultivation and permanent settlement was of recent date. (The original name given by Hungarians to the Romanians, the now rather pejorative oláh, was derived from 'walach', which also came to denote a semi-nomadic shepherd.) Many others remained in the mountains with their flocks, and even those who chose permanent settlement continued to raise sheep, a distinctively Romanian practice in Eastern Europe.
Thus the disastrous economic effects of Turkish oppression prompted a massive emigration of smallholders and of their peasants. Some of them remained beyond the Carpathians and attempted to reach Galicia, but the majority headed for Transylvania, partly because it was readily accessible from Wallachia, and partly because of the lure of its communities of earlier Romanian settlers.
The migrant Romanians took the well-trodden route through the forests and pastures of Transylvania's mountains. Their first choice was to settle in the existing Romanian communities, but these could not accommodate all of the newcomers, for the population had grown considerably over the preceding centuries; there was no pastureland to spare, and ploughland could only be expanded by onerous forest-clearing. The new settlers greatly increased the density of population. Around Belényes, in the south-eastern corner of Bihar county, the population was greater in



The Romanians
https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/112.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:35:02]
the late 1500s than a century later.
Thus many in the latest wave of immigrants had to seek land elsewhere. They settled on pastures that had been used only intermittently and proceeded to clear more and more land. Romanian-inhabited areas came to form an unbroken strip from the Máramaros, through the Belényes Basin and the Gyalu Alps, to Fogaras, Hunyad county, and the Severin Province. This transformation drew the attention of officials at the turn of the century. {1-702.} Zacharias Geizkoffler, the Habsburg army's paymaster, reported after a visit to Transylvania that 'previously there were few Romanian villages, but now they are numerous in the mountains, for, in contrast to the devastation in the lowlands, there has been much development in highland areas.'[14]
The quest for land and the resettlement was generally orderly. Villeins from the principalities would follow a leader, still known as a 'voivode' or cnez, who contacted the owner of their chosen place of settlement. Since landowners were delighted to find new workers, there was normally little difficulty in reaching an agreement. When a new village was founded, both landowners and state tried to ease the villeins' burden by tax concessions and the provisional suspension of feudal services.
Despite these initial inducements, Transylvania's Romanians remained poorer and more wretched than their Hungarian and Saxon neighbours. Shepherding was less profitable than farming. The landowners did all in their power to convert their new villeins to agriculture, and shortage of pastureland drove them in the same direction. But the ploughlands assigned to the villeins were available precisely because of their poor quality; nor were the newly-cleared lands as productive as those long-cultivated on the plain. Moreover, the villeins from Moldavia and Wallachia had fewer agricultural skills than their contemporaries in Transylvania, and hence their productivity was also inferior. (The practice of using land alternately for cultivation and grazing continued to prevail in the principalities at a time when Transylvania's agriculture was shifting to three-course rotation.) And feudal services only added to the problems of the Romanian peasantry.
To be sure, the ethnic identity of villeins was of little consequence in the Middle Ages. There was a differentiation of Hungarian, Saxons, and Romanian villages in the former Hungarian kingdom (possessio hungaricalis, saxonicalis, or walachicalis), but it denoted differences in feudal obligations and {1-703.} legal status, not in ethnicity. However, feudal obligations were determined on the basis of the villeins' 'status', one aspect of which was their ethnic origin. Thus there can be no doubt that villages identified as 'Romanian' actually had a predominantly Romanian population.
With regard to the feudal burdens of 16th century Romanian villages, it was common practice in medieval Hungary the give new settlements a temporary exemption from the normal obligations. A typical case is that of the Romanians who settled around Kővár in 1566, and received a fourteen-year exemption from the basic state tax. The most common exception to the general rule was that the Romanians, not being Roman Catholic, were exempted from tithes. Only those who became assimilated and converted could be compelled to pay this Church tax. However, in 1559, the Transylvanian diet overrode this traditional principle and ruled that when Romanians settled in a locality that was registered on the tithe rolls, they too would have to pay this tax, which had meanwhile become a source of state revenue.
Some Romanian villages ended up having to deliver feudal services that were greater than the general norm. Thus, according to 1554 data, the annual corvée of Romanian villeins on the Gyalu estates included two to three days of ploughing, two days of harvesting and hay-cutting, as well as the collection and delivery of the produce — all of which amounted to at least one or two days' more work than was demanded from Hungarian villages.
The biggest difference lay in the special services that only Romanians had to provide. Thus at the Világos domain (and no doubt in many other places), Romanian villeins who had an entire plot of land owed half a day of harvesting and half a day of hay-cutting to their voivodes; those who had ten plots owed an additional half a day of ploughing. Romanians were the sole providers of cottage-cheese (brînză). The tradition of keeping sheep bore its own cost, for Romanians had to pay a special sheep-tax. In some places, {1-704.} notably in the Hátszeg district and on the Csicsó estate, this was known as the 'fiftieth' (ötvened); in the districts of Solymos, Szatmár, and Kővár, the term was 'sheepfold' (sztronga). In some of Csicsó's villages, the villeins paid what continued to be called a sheeptax in pigs and honey. Those owning cattle incurred another tax, called tretina in Romanian, which required them to hand over a certain proportion of their stock.



The Romanians
https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/112.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:35:02]
The situation of Romanian villeins on the Fogaras castle domain showed some distinctive features. They did not have to pay the sheep tax, an exemption that probably originated in the period when Wallachia's voivodes controlled the district. The local terms for the tax they did have to pay were 'fish money' (halpénz) and 'silver money' (ezüstpénz). Even the term applied to villeins was different; instead of the normal colonus or iobagio, they were called vecin, just as in Wallachia.
As in the case of the Hungarians, local custom determined the manner in which Romanians' feudal dues were collected. As was noted in the case of the sheep tax at Csicsó, the distinction among the various dues began to fade. However, there was little blurring of the distinction between feudal obligations of Hungarian and Saxon settlements and those of the Romanian ones. The changes that occurred before the end of the 16th century did not alter the fundamentals. Although the traditional sheep tax disappeared, the tretina and similar taxes on other animals remained in effect.
The social status of the Romanians' leaders remained unaltered. Village officially designated as Romanian were headed by voivodes, krainiks, or, less commonly, cnezes. On several estates, notably at Világos, Csicsó, Kővár, Erdőd, and Somlyó, Romanian settlements were grouped into districts, and the titles came to signify differences in rank: the voivode was the head of the district, while the krainik denoted his deputy or the magistrate of a village. In other places, such as the Gyula domain, it was the village magistrate who bore the title voivode.
{1-705.} These leaders stood above the common villeins, but they could not rise higher than freeman-villein (szabados). Their office entitled them to demand produce and work from the villeins, but they too owed dues, however symbolic, to the landowner, in the form of deer and sparrowhawks. Even Orthodox priests had to pay a tax, called lazsnak or pokróc ('blanket').
Only in a few districts did Romanian leaders manage to join the ranks of the nobility: in Transylvania proper, in the Hátszeg region of Hunyad county, and in the Partium, in the Temesköz and parts of the Máramaros and Bihar county. However, most cases of ennoblement had occurred prior to the 16th century, and while not all of the beneficiaries gave up their language and Orthodox religion, they totally assimilated the lifestyle and outlook of the Hungarian ruling class. Thus a distinctively Romanian feudal society never materialized.
The best illustration of the limitations on social development within the Romanian communities is offered by the boyars of the Fogaras district. They enjoyed the same freedom as Hungarian nobles, and had links to the noble families of Wallachia; yet their lack of full noble status kept them out of the Hungarian ruling class, as did their language and religion, which they preserved partly because of their Trans-Carpathian links. This exclusion from the Hungarian nobility persisted in the 16th century; the only change was that they came to be called, like the Székelys, serény (agilis).
The Romanian people were excluded from politics and comparatively backward; they were farthest removed from urban culture. In these circumstances, it is understandable that the Reformation aroused little interest in their ranks. At a time when the Protestant denominations were becoming channels for feudal and social interests, and also the bearers of a burgeoning national consciousness, Transylvania's Romanians still lacked any organized church. The Orthodox priests lived as villeins, their activities supervised variously by a dean or by the abbot (igumen) of a {1706.} monastery. Though some of the igumens also bore the title of a bishop (vlădică), neither their powers nor their districts were clearly delineated. (Some of these districts dated back to the 15th century, but most of them were created in the first half of the 16th century by the voivodes of Wallachia and Moldavia on their Transylvanian domains.) The main problem was a lack of central authority, for Transylvania's Orthodox believers would had to wait until 1574 before their Church acquired a leader.
The Reformation could have brought important benefits for the Romanians. The Orthodox religion had GreekSlavonic roots, used the Cyrillic alphabet, and had rites and rituals that differed greatly from Western Christianity; this ostensibly poor and backward denomination could be easily dismissed as 'superstitious' and excluded from the religions recognized by the feudal state. (Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that notwithstanding John Sigismund's 1566 legislation, which in any case was never put in force, the Orthodox suffered very little persecution.) In contrast, Protestant doctrines were intimately linked to Western Europe, and those who adopted them were granted equal rights. Such recognition in the sphere of religion would no doubt have facilitated the Romanians' political integration — and what is more, an integration that would have given scope for their mother tongue.

https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/112.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:35:02]
The first attempts by Protestant Saxons in Szeben to proselytize among the Romanians showed some success. Szeben's printing press, which had lain idle for fifteen years, was equipped with Cyrillic letters and entrusted in 1544 to the town's Romanian interpreter, Filip Moldoveanul. Over the next decade, Moldoveanul published Romanian-language versions of the catechism and other religious material. At the end of the 1550s, Brassó followed the example of Szeben and established a Romanian-language publishing house directed by Coresi, a clergyman who came from the Wallachian town of Tîrgovişte. By 1581, this press had published a whole series Lutheran- and Calvinist-inspired works that enriched {1-707.} Romanian culture and represented, in fact, the beginning of Romanian book-publishing in Eastern Europe.
The fact that the publications in Brassó included works of Calvinist inspiration indicated that Transylvania's Hungarians had joined the attempts to proselytize among Romanians. The efforts of both Lutherans and Calvinists soon won the sovereign's approval and, from John Sigismund's reign onwards, overt support. The results were not long in coming. Together with his priests, a former Romanian vlădica, György Szentgyörgyi, converted to Calvinism. Other Orthodox priests followed their example and, in 1566–67, Szentgyörgyi convened the first synod of Romanian Calvinists in Transylvania. They founded their own Church, adopted Romanian for their liturgy, and elected their first superintendent in the person of Szentgyörgyi.
For a while, the Reformation continued to make inroads among Romanians. More towns provided publishing facilities to spur the religious renewal. A Romanian hymnal comprising works by Péter Melius, Gergely Szegedi, and Ferenc Dávid was published at Kolozsvár around 1570–73. In the early 1580s, part of the Old Testament published in Romanian at Szászváros.
However, by the beginning of the 1590s, the religious reform process among Romanians was losing its momentum. The state's policy on religion changed when Báthori came to power. Prince Stephen remained true to the Roman faith, and he tried to constrain Romanian Calvinists. The activities of Bishop György's successors Pál Tordasi, who came from a noble family in Hunyad county, and, from 1577, his relative Mihály Tordasi were essentially limited to Hunyad county and the district encompassing Lugos and Karánsebes.
Prince Stephen turned his attention to the reorganization of the Greek Orthodox Church. Thanks to his efforts, two new vlădicas were consecrated, in 1572 and 1574, and, in October 1574, the diet, meeting in Torda, recognized the right of Orthodox believers to elect {1-708.} their bishops. That same year, the Romanians of Transylvania elected Ghenadie as their first full-fledged bishop (episcop). The seat of new Transylvania-Nagyvárad bishopric was at Gyulafehérvár; a second bishopric was soon established for northern Transylvania and the Partium, with its seat at Rév. These bishops' consecration in Serbia or Wallachia maintained the links with the Orthodox Church hierarchy in Eastern Europe.
While the ruling prince was helping to provide Transylvania's Romanians with an organized Church, the ranks of the faithful were swollen by the new wave of immigrants from the principalities, people who had no knowledge of the Reformation. Thus a religious reform that promised to draw the Romanians closer to Transylvania's other peoples was ultimately undermined by state intervention and by immigration. The mass of Romanians stuck to the Orthodox faith. The organization of their church owed much to the ruling prince, yet their denomination did not win equal status with the others but remained merely a 'tolerated' religion.

The Emergence of Feudal Estates and Oligarchic Rule
The Mongol Invasion and Its Consequences
The conflict between Hungary and the Bulgarian-Romanian state was rudely interrupted by the invasion of Mongols and their Tartar allies. In 1235, after having conquered northern China, the Mongol hordes turned westward. In quick succession, they defeated the Volga Bulgars, the Hungarians of Bashkiria, and the North Russian principalities, and, in 1239, the forces of Kötöny, king of the Eastern Cumanians. Hungary's king, Béla IV, gave shelter to the fleeing Cumanians, but he could not prevent the Mongols from following up their capture of Kiev in 1240 with a direct attack on his land.
In the spring of 1241, the armies of Batu Khan crossed into Hungary at three separate points. The main Mongol force overwhelmed the king's army in the Sajó valley; Béla and the remnants of his troops escaped to make a last stand in Transdanubia. Two other Mongol armies invaded Transylvania. The first, led by Kadan, crossed the Radna Pass and laid siege to Radna, a prosperous mining town inhabited by Germans. Using the conquered Germans as an advance guard, the Mongols proceeded to devastate Beszterce, then Kolozsvár, where — according to contemporary reports — they slaughtered 'countless Hungarians'.[16] Bereft of defenders, Northern Transylvania was ravaged by the Mongols, who finally left the region by way of the Meszes Pass to join up with Batu's main force in the Great Plain. The other Mongol army, led by Bogutaj, entered Transylvania through the Ojtoz Pass, the {1-443.} traditional route taken by eastern invaders. The Mongols prevailed over the Transylvanian army and killed its commander, the voivode Pósa, then pressed on down the Olt valley into the heart of the region. Küküllővár, Nagyszeben, and Gyulafehérvár fell in quick succession; the invaders moved westward along the Maros, crushing all resistance and bringing death and destruction to villages and towns. Meanwhile, a detachment, led by Bedzsak, crossed the Szeret River and conquered the land of the western, Christianized Cumanians; fifteen years of painstaking work by the Hungarian state and Church to develop this region were swept away by the Mongol invasion.
Hungary east of the Danube fell under Mongol rule; only the larger fortresses of Western Hungary managed to hold out against the onslaught. The advancing Mongols purposely sowed terror by slaughtering not only their armed opponents but also masses of defenceless civilians; some of the latter survived by hiding in forests or in remote mountain regions. However, the Mongols failed to accomplish their goal, which was to conquer all of Hungary in one swift offensive. They had to regroup and prepare for the attack on Transdanubia. Needing food for the troops, the Mongols promised to spare the lives of civilian survivors who would leave their refuges and resume agricultural work. After the harvest, the poor wretches were mercilessly slaughtered so that they would present no risk at the rear when, early in the new year, the Mongols crossed the frozen surface of the Danube to attack Transdanubia. They still failed to capture Hungary's king and to invest the more important fortresses. Then came news of the Great Khan's death: eager to share in the division of the latter's domain, Batu led his armies homeward, once again plundering and devastating the land on their way out of the country.
Master Rogerius, the canon of Nagyvárad, managed to escape from captivity and has left an eyewitness report of the appalling bloodshed and destruction wrought by the Mongols. In truth, {1-444.} Hungary presented a lamentable picture after the departure of the Mongols. For several days, as he proceeded up the Maros valley, Rogerius did not meet a living soul. Roads and byways were overgrown; Gyulafehérvár, which not long before stood as the political and ecclesiastical center of a flourishing region of Hungary, was now a place of ruined churches and palaces littered with human bones. On his sorrowful journey, Rogerius oriented himself by a succession of ruined church steeples and scrounged for food in deserted fields. The first survivors that he encountered were hiding on a wooded hill near Fráta, a village in Kolozs county; they were in a state of near-starvation, and Rogerius shared the bread that they made from bark. The population had been greatly reduced by the slaughter and famine, as well as by the loss of thousands who had been carried off into captivity by the Mongols. Gradually, the survivors moved back to rebuild their devastated villages. Years later, Transylvania's bishop would still bemoan the depopulation of his diocese and that fact that only a few thousand people lived on the episcopal estates.



The Mongol Invasion and Its Consequences
https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/76.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:35:14]
Indeed, the Mongol invasion had major consequences for Transylvania's demography. The surplus of population that once sustained settlement beyond the Carpathians was no more; the movement of Hungarian and Saxon settlers into Cumania would not be resumed for a long time. Transylvania could not be made fully secure from Mongol incursion. As for the regions beyond the mountain frontier, they suffered from frequent Mongol raids for at least another century, and thus could not be properly reorganized even if people could have been found to settle there. Milkó became a phantom bishopric; periodically, a new bishop was appointed, but the incumbent could not exercise his duties in a diocese that was short of population as well as of security.
The ethnic map of the region between the Carpathians and the Danube underwent a marked change. The Cumanian nation had been largely annihilated by the Mongols; the survivors, together {1-445.} with the Eastern Cumanians, resettled on the Great Plain of Hungary. Although Cumania kept its name, the remaining Slavs and Cumanians were gradually absorbed into a growing population of Romanians, who increasingly shifted from shepherding to farming. Hungary's king remained the region's nominal master, but he no longer exercised his rule through Hungarian officials; instead, he assigned this task to the voivodes who had been appointed over the cnezes of the Romanian border-guard districts in Southern Transylvania. The recourse offered little guarantee of security against the Mongols, and thus, in 1247, King Béla IV granted Severin Province and the Cumanian Country to the Knights of St John of Jerusalem (Knights Hospitallers), conferring on them rights similar to those granted by his father to the Teutonic Knights in the Barcaság. This experiment was not a success, for the Knights failed to repopulate their domain — not least because the King would not allow them to receive Hungarian or German settlers from Hungary — and lacked the military strength to withstand Mongol attacks; since the grant of land was tied to strict conditions, the Knights chose to renounce the endowment. For the time being, the King had to content himself with the reorganization of Transylvania. His task was facilitated by some exceptionally competent voivodes, selected from among Hungary's feudal lords, who now held office for longer terms: Lőrinc (who held the post from 1242 to 1252), Ernye Ákos (1252–60), László Kán (1260–67), and Máté Csák (1267–70).
The Székelys embodied the major military resource, and those still in the interior were now resettled closer to the frontier, from the lower reaches of the Nagy-Küküllő to the Kézdi seat and along the Aranyos River. Their former lands were transferred to the Saxons, whose numbers were swollen by new arrivals, and who thus established settlements that were later incorporated into the Medgyes and Nagysejk seats. The formerly Székely character of these localities is indicated by the Hungarian origin of most toponyms, as well {1-446.} as by the fact that for a long time, and despite the change in population, the villages were administered not by the Szeben count but by the Székely count. The Segesvár seat, established later, did not acquire its Saxon population until the 14th century. However, the succeeding waves of German immigrants spread beyond the boundaries of even the enlarged Szászföld. Saxon settlements were founded in counties contiguous with the Szászföld, but since they could not be linked administratively to the latter, the social development of their inhabitants followed a course closer to that of the Hungarian agrarian class.
The Mongols' devastating invasion had another important consequence, large-scale immigration by Romanians. The military catastrophe led Hungary's king to conclude that due to their location, the castles that served as the counties' administrative centres were ill-suited to resist a determined attack. He therefore relinquished these castles to the Church or private individuals, and proceeded to have forts built with adequate defences on more isolated hills and mountains throughout the country. The hilly surroundings of these new forts were not suitable for agriculture, and were thus largely deserted; the subsequent attempts to settle Hungarian and Saxon farmers succeeded in only a few locations, where forest-clearance had provided some small areas of cultivable land. In any case, even if the natural environment had been more welcoming, the Crown would have had a hard time finding settlers; the population was so depleted by the Mongol invasion that it was difficult to revive even the older settled areas, never mind colonise mountainous regions with Saxons and Hungarians. On the other hand, the new forts needed people, and not only for military service or maintenance, but also to put the surrounding, royal estates to productive use and replenish the royal coffers; having transferred into private hands most of its holdings in inner Transylvania, the Crown needed an alternative source of revenue. The rich mountain pastures could best be exploited by pastoral people, and thus Hungary's {1-447.} kings invited into the fortress districts Romanian shepherds who were pressing northward from Bulgaria and Serbia, as well as others who were left free to migrate after the collapse of Cumanian rule. This is how some Romanians came to settle around the Transylvanian castles at Déva, Hunyad, Salgó, Talmács, Törcs, Kecskés, Szádkő, Léta, Sebes, Almás, Csicsó, Bálványos, and Görgény. A much larger number of Romanians settled, not in Transylvania proper, but on the far side of its western mountain

The immigration of Romanians did not happen all at once; indeed, the process of settlement in the mountain districts stretched over several centuries. The settlement was planned and backed by positive inducements; in the words of a later statute, 'at the invitation, and with all the assurances of his royal majesty, as well as of the voivodes, barons, and other officials who administer the kingdom's borderlands' (ad vocationem et assecurationem regie maiestatis ac vaivodarum, baronum et ceterorum officialium ista confinia regni tenentium).[17] Initially, the king exploited his exclusive right to invite immigrants, and made sure that the newcomers all settled on his estates.
The Romanian immigrants are invariably characterized in Hungarian sources as mountain shepherds. As late as the 16th century, an official report referred to Romanians as people who kept many animals in the forests and mountains (Walachi, qui tantum in silvis et montibus non contemnendum pecorum numerum alunt).[18] Antal Verancsics (later Archbishop of Esztergom), a man who had a thorough knowledge of Transylvania, made a similar observation, adding that Romanians were seldom found in the open spaces (rari in apertis locis incolae, montibus ac silvis plerumque cum suo pecore pariter obditi).[19] The intimate link between the Romanian {1-448.} pastoral culture in Hungary and that in the Balkans is indicated by a 'sheep tax' (known in Hungary as the juhötvened, or quinquagesima ovium, meaning 'sheep fiftieth', and in the Balkans as travnina) which in both Hungary and Serbia was paid only by the Romanians — a people closely identified with sheep-breeding. The tax required the delivery of one sheep and one lamb for every fifty sheep held. Since the mountain-dwelling Romanians practised but subsistence farming, they were not taxed on their agricultural output.
The royal estates' natural setting contributed to the survival of this pastoral way of life. The people directly employed at the castle were generally Hungarians (along with a few Slavs) who lived in the valleys. The Romanians helped to sustain the castle system with their taxes. Their leaders, the cnezes and voivodes, were answerable to the castellan: they were responsible for the punctual delivery of the 'fiftieth' and had to perform military service. The majority of Romanians stayed on their mountain pastures, and even their leaders often lacked a fixed abode. Hence a story, dating from 1363, that is often cited as the first documented reference to seasonal shepherding by Romanians in Hungary: the cnezes of the royal castle at Illyéd, in Krassó county, could not be summoned to judicial hearings because of uncertainty about their place of residence (propter eorundem mansionis seu residencie incertitudinem). In March, when the document was drafted, the cnezes could not be found on their properties, for they and their flocks were still away at distant winter pastures. To be sure, this absence may have been as much a reflection of nomadism as of transhumance, since it is not known whether the shepherds' families followed them. In any case, it can be assumed that the leaders of this pastoral people devoted progressively less time to shepherding and more to soldiering.
In the Balkans, the most common word to designate the leader of a pastoral community of Romanians was cselnik (read: chelnik), {1-449.} though there were also other designations (sudce, premikjur, knez, vladika, katunar). In Hungary, on the other hand, the term that came into general use was kenéz (kenezius), the magyarized form of the Slavic knez (cnez). The Romanians themselves turned kenéz into chinez, a term in sporadic use even today. Hungarian administrators referred to the Romanian leaders as kenéz, a term long applied to the local Slavic leaders. The Romanian leaders' former titles had not become institutionalized, and they had no compunction about accepting the new one, for it symbolized recognition of their status by the Hungarian royal authorities; with regard to their own people, their status was already firmly rooted in wealth and inheritance.
Voivode (vojvoda), the title of a leader who held authority over sever cnezes, was probably adopted by the Romanians in similar fashion. Commonly used in the lands of the Hungarian king, it does not occur among Romanians in the Balkans. The term, of Slavic origin, was adopted by the conquering Hungarians and used to designate Transylvanian leaders, then applied to the Romanian leaders of the semi-autonomous groups of Romanian border guards. Sources dating from the 14th century confirm that whereas cnez was a hereditary title, the voivodes were initially elected by the Romanians — a practice consistent with Hungarian customary law, which provided that immigrant groups elect a leader from their ranks. (Thus Saxons elected the magistrates who worked alongside the royal count, and Székelys their captains and judges). However, the voivodes soon followed the example of the cnezes and obtained that their status and attendant privileges be passed on to their heirs. On the other hand, the hereditary status of voivodes and cnezes did not deprive ordinary Romanians of their legal and

economic rights, for those rights were recognized by the Hungarian castellans: when, in accordance with Hungarian administrative practice, the latter formed district courts, they appointed to the bench not only cnezes but also Romanian priests and commoners, and the courts followed Romanian customary law in rendering judgment.
{1-450.} As noted in connection with Severin Province, the Romanians — like other migrant, pastoral, and mounted peoples — had their own military organization. In practice, only the cnezes performed regular military service; in peacetime, they guarded the mountain frontier, and in wartime, they fought in the royal army. Each and every Székely was committed to military duty, but the majority of Romanians and Saxons were exempt. Thus, right from the start, the cnezes enjoyed a high social status, and this status was only reinforced when the Romanians adopted a more settled way of life.
The shift to that way of life was actively encouraged by the Hungarian overseers of the royal castles and estates, for they considered stable settlement to be the best guarantee of an organized and economically productive Romanian community. Their efforts were seconded by the cnezes, who soon realized that landed property offered a better foundation for social status than did livestock, which was subject to uncontrollable changes in quality and number. In the 14th–15th centuries, many of the Slavic villages on royal estates were in the charge of Romanian cnezes; Hungarian castellans, with an eye on military priorities, appointed the latter in preference to Slavs, who had little or no military training. These cnezes received a share of the Slav farmers' output and, discovering the advantages of steady agricultural production, tried to persuade Romanians to shift shepherding to farming. In all likelihood, the cnezes were the first to adopt a settled, village existence, followed by members of the shepherds' families. Over time, the practice of transhumance became limited to one group of shepherds, while others grazed their flocks in the vicinity of the villages. The pattern varied by region, but the number of settled Romanians grew steadily.
Being eager to accelerate the pace of permanent settlement, castle officials favoured cnezes who were disposed to draw Romanians into agricultural communities. The pastoral Romanians {1-451.} also engaged in forest-clearing, mainly to carve out new pastures; however, if the cnez claimed the cleared land for cultivation, the castellans designated the new agricultural settlements as 'free villages' (villa libera), granted long-term tax concessions, and guaranteed that the cnez and his descendants would get a share of the revenues. The cnezes settled Slavs as well as Romanians in these villages, a fact confirmed by the prevalence of another, Slavic term, ohaba, to designate free villages on both sides of the Southern Carpathians. However, the Romanians were the principal settlers; by the end of the Middle Ages, they predominated in these villages, and the Slavs became linguistically assimilated. The social status of the cnezes came to be rooted in their hereditary rights over the free villages, and the title itself acquired a new meaning. Originally, the cnez was the leader of a group of Romanian shepherds, entrusted by royal castellans with minor, judicial and administrative tasks. However, by the 14th century, the cnez was regarded principally as an entrepreneur who established agricultural settlements on newly-cleared land, and the 'cnez right' (ius keneziale) became synonymous with the ownership in perpetuity of privileged 'free villages'.

The Avar Occupation of Transylvania 4. THE PERIOD OF AVAR RULE The Early Coexistence of Avars and Slavs
Avar Rule before 630
The historical record indicates that in the last third of the 6th century, the Avars had yet to decide whether the Carpathian Basin should be their permanent home. They maintained their claim to the region between the Lower Danube and the Balkan mountains, where, in 584–86, they occupied Moesia and part of Scythia Minor, and began to implant their political and economic structure. However, between 593 and 598, Eastern Roman troops that had been transferred from the Persian front put an end to Avar rule in the northern Balkans, and they followed this up in 600–601 with successful counterattacks in the Temes region. The Avars' pattern of settlement reflects the 'transitional' character of this period: drawn to the south, the Avars had little interest in the northern third {1-228.} of the Carpathian Basin. Their area of settlement extended in the northwest to the Danube (with only a military bridgehead lying beyond this line, at Dévény), and, in the north, to the onetime Sarmatian rampart at the periphery of the forest belt in Pest-Heves-Borsod counties (of today), a line that they crossed only in one or two places in the northeasterly Nyírség. In the south, the settlements extended roughly to the stretch of the Danube in Sirmia. They dwelt at the centres of marked-off pastures, in so-called auls; the latter's traces — single graves and small burial grounds holding 10–20 graves — are difficult to assess. From the perspective of archaeology, Avars became more 'visible' only after the defeats they suffered in 600–601, when they began to systematize their rule in the occupied territories. Larger cemeteries, many of which remained in use for generations, appeared first at their winter quarters (e.g. Dunaújváros, Kölked), then near their villages. In Transylvania, it is difficult to separate the archaeological legacy of the pre-601 generation from that of the later ones.
In the first decades of the Avar period, the section of the Maros valley between Arad and the Tisza River was supervised by the Prince of Kunágota — one of the highest dignitaries in the Bayan period — and his retinue. The prince's aul was situated in the valley, between Pécska and Arad; he presumably travelled along the northern bank of the Maros to reach his other residences. When the prince died, he was buried secretly at a location far from the Maros, in the northern puszta. The pattern of burial was similar in the case of the lords of the 'Kagan's' ordus, on the left bank of the Danube, whose hidden graves lay on the periphery of a region of marshlands and sand dunes between the Danube and the Tisza (Bábony, Bócsa, Kecel), or of a contemporary of the prince of Kunágota in the Tisza region, east of the river at Kunmadaras. The Kunágota prince's grave, which yielded much gold, can be dated back to the 590s by a gold solidus, in almost mint condition, and dating from the end of Justinian I's life, as well as by his sword, which has Byzantine gilded {1-229.} reliefs typical of that emperor's era. The graves of his military escort and those of his successor or successors hold horses and weapons, and are located along the Maros — on the northern bank at Németpereg (several rich graves from the early period, with horses) and Apátfalva, and on the southern bank at Fönlak (two remarkable, 7th-century graves), Németszentpéter, Nagyszentmiklós-Bukova-puszta (two graves with horses and arms), Óbesenyő, Kiszombor O., Deszk G. All of the grave goods are of Asian origin: the weapons (swords with long, straight blades, which were typical of mounted warriors, strong, armour-piercing lances, large bows with reinforcing plates made of bone, and heavy arrows with triple-edged heads) as well as the harnesses (iron stirrups, bridles, and ornamented saddles). There are fewer traces of buried women: a grave at Temeskenéz yielded some early beads, and handmade pots indicative of the early Avar period were unearthed at Széphely, Temeskenéz, Temesság and Temesremete. Splendid big earrings, consisting of silver spheres, were found in the early 1800s at Oravicabánya, in Krassó-Severin county; along with other finds, they confirm that the early Avar settlement area extended to the Lower Danube. Traces have been found of frontier posts facing the Byzantines: a Byzantine bronze buckle with a cruciform perforation, along with parts of a pinked belt, at Orsova, and an early Avar war axe and pikehead at Szőlőtelep.
One outstanding find is the grave of an ironsmith, buried with his horse, at Fönlak, on the edge of the Maros' flood plain. Although it had been partially plundered, the grave yielded one of the most extensive sets (44 pieces) of bronze press-moulds ever to be discovered in the Carpathian Basin; the set is a treasury of Persian/Byzantine-style moulds of belt, harness, and saddle ornaments. The fact that the deceased was buried with his moulds and tools indicates that goldsmiths and ironsmiths enjoyed an exalted social status. Of comparable importance is the grave of an ironsmith (with horse) discovered at Kunszentmárton. In addition to a {1-230.} sword, a pike with staff, and a 41

piece set of press-moulds, the grave also yielded a costly and elegant example of the early Avars' combat wear: a corselet of linked iron plates.
The grave (with horse) discovered on the southern bank of the Aranka, near Németszentpéter, is noteworthy not only because of its unusual, north-south alignment, but also because of the folded horsehide at the feet of the corpse. Its age is indicated by a solidus, minted between 615–25, during the reign of Emperor Heraclius, and used as a pendant or other ornament; such coins are known as 'light' solidi, for they were 'official counterfeits' used to pay tribute to the Avars. The deceased Avar lord's helmet, made of linked iron plates, is a unique find; it could be identified from 6th–7th century frescos at Afrasiab (Old-Samarkand), in Central Asia. The grave goods included, in addition to the common weapons (long single-edged sword, pikehead, heavy, triple-edged arrowheads) and harness, a remarkable weapon-belt that had five side-straps and pressed-silver strap tips made in the Fönlak smithy. A Heraclius solidus found at Sajtény, on the northern bank of the Maros, was of similar quality, while the silver coins from the age of Heraclius and Heraclius Constantinus, unearthed at Nagyszentmiklós, on the southern bank, indicate more modest burials. The Pécska and Orsova grave-finds (including 6–7th century Byzantine buckles), the graves at Kispereg, and the pot from a grave at Zádorlak belong to the early Avar period, but they have yet to be dated more precisely. Similarly, the dwellings unearthed at Barra, and holding stone ovens, spindle buttons, and spindle discs, can be dated back to the early Avar period only by a rough estimate.
The graves and objects uncovered in the Ér valley, Érmihályfalva, Érkeserű, Székelyhíd, and Iriny testify to early Avar settlements. The Érmihályfalva find includes handmade, narrow-necked mugs, mugs with handles (cf. Küküllővár), and other vessels. These objects may have originally come from Rétalja, where a more recently discovered grave (with horse) contained a straight sword {1-231.} with a ringed hilt, triple-edged arrowheads, a pair of hook-eared stirrups, bridles decorated with hemispheric buttons in early Avar style, and a 'szalu' — a distinctive tool found in Avar and Turk graves that also held a horse. A handmade dish of Central Asian type, with a fourcornered rim, identifies and dates the Avar grave at Székelyhíd-Horó-tanya (cf. Marosnagylak); a grey pot that reflects Central Asian technique and style does the same for the grave at Iriny. Other early Avar graves have been found in the area where the Sebes-Körös reaches the Great Plain, in the vicinity of the rich 6th century grave (with a horse) at Ártánd, and at Köröstarján-Csordás-domb.
Traces of early Avar auls or ordus, similar to those found at the mouth of the Maros, have been discovered in the Transylvanian Basin as well. A reference point is the site at Szentendre, north of Budapest, where noblemen's graves are dated from 578–610 on the evidence of a gold tremissis of Iustinus II and a solidus of Fokas; the two large, 'Szentendre-type' gold earrings, with pyramidical and spherical pendants, that were unearthed 'somewhere in Transylvania' (and must have come from graves), are presumably relics from an ordu of the same period. Another fine piece of jewellery from 'somewhere in Transylvania', a 'Deszk-type' pair of gold earrings with pyramidical pendants, dates already from the first half of the 7th century. Thus Transylvania must have received its share of Byzantine tribute to the Avars: of the 'light' solidi of Mauricius (582–602) (found at Szegvár, Tiszakeszi, Csősztelek, Kőhalom, and in the vicinity of Marosvásárhely), and the "light" solidi of Fokás (602–610) (at Kula, Szilágypér, Körtéd/Krušica, and Mezőszabad), coins that became the almost exclusive form of tribute from Fokas' successor, Heraclius (Hajdúdorog, Szeghegy, Szentes-Jaksor, Sajtény, Németszentpéter).
An early Avar aul may also be indicated by an earring, with a gold setting, of Italo-Byzantine origin, that probably comes from Kolozsvár (and not, as previously recorded, from Abrudbánya). {1-232.} This jewel is the only Transylvanian trace of the Italian contacts nurtured by many Avars who had settled in Pannonia and along the Tisza.
Judging from the press-moulds found at Erzsébetváros (Nagy-Küküllő valley) and Korond-Firtos (Kis-Küküllő valley), the demand in Transylvanian auls for fancy belts and harnesses was met by highly esteemed smiths whose tools and methods were similar to those at Fönlak. A fine example of their craftsmanship was found — evidently on the site of a plundered grave with horse — at Gyulafehérvár: a bronze, Maltese-cross shaped belt link of the Fönlak type and size, with, at its rounded centre, the outline of a moustached face.
The valley of the Küküllő rivers was in all probability the site of an early Avar settlement; the graves (with horses and weapons) of this district's garrison have been found at Nagyenyed, in the nearby Maros valley. The grave (with a horse) uncovered at Diód may also be linked to this centre, as may an intact, early Avar 'nomadic' dish that must have come from a grave and was found at Szászsebes. The settlement of Avars in the Gepidic-Germanic village at

https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/44.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:35:25]
Mezőbánd probably originates dates from the period of consolidation, after 600. The Avar graves (with horses) uncovered at both ends of the Mezőbánd cemetery indicate that — perhaps after a brief period of cohabitation the Gepid inhabitants were expelled. An exquisitely-wrought gold ring, decorated in a serrated, Germanic II 'animal pattern', and unearthed in one of these graves resembles one, made of silver, that was found at KeszthelyFenékpuszta; after exhaustive analysis, it has been dated to the 580–630 period. The ring's decorative style is congruent with that of objects identified with the earliest Avar princes (the 'Jankovich golds' and Kunmadaras); these have been dated by the gold solidi (found at Kölked) from the age of Iustinus II (565–572) and Mauricius (582–602). A pressed belt ornament, similar to the one from Mezőbánd, was found in a grave in Nyíregyháza-{1233.} Kertgazdaság, along with a worn Mauricius solidus that had been sewn on a garment. On the basis of available evidence, it can be estimated that the Avar graves at Mezőbánd date from 600–630.
In 626, at Constantinople, the Bayan dynasty's army of Avars, Bulgars, Gepids, and Slavs suffered at great defeat. In the aftermath, the subject peoples in the Avar empire turned rebellious; the Slavic tribes in Dalmatia threw off the Avar yoke and sought the protection of Byzantium (629–30). The internal wars that shook the whole Avar empire left observable traces: villages and cemeteries fell into disuse, and many graveyards dating from before 630 — including the Avar graves at Mezőbánd — were devastated and plundered. The Bayan dynasty ultimately regained control, but as a consequence of the internal conflict, the Avars lost a precious ally, the Bulgars, and they were compelled to take defensive measures against the Slavic peoples in the west and southwest.
There is no clearer sign of these events than the devastation suffered by the graves of Gepids and Avars at Mezőbánd, and the sole dated and positive piece of evidence also comes from Transylvania: a trove of 237 gold coins (some reports put the number at over 300, and even 5,000) that was discovered in 1831 at KorondFirtosváralja. The most recent coins in the treasure, which obviously had been accumulated through many decades of extortion, were solidi minted around 625, at the time of Heraclius and Heraclius Constantinus; thus the concealment of the treasure (and the flight or death of the owner) must have occurred around 630. The treasure also serves to buttress the conclusion that the early Avars' central area of settlement in Transylvania lay in the valley of the Kis-Küküllő.

1. FROM THE EASTERN HUNGARIAN KINGDOM TO THE PRINCIPALITY OF TRANSYLVANIA
Transylvania in the Decade of Disintegration
Prelude: The Disintegration of Medieval Hungary
On 29 August 1526, at Mohács, Sultan Suleiman's army inflicted a decisive defeat on the Hungarian forces. Hungary's youthful king, Louis II (Jagiello), fell in battle, as did many of his soldiers. The Ottomans proceeded to invest and ransack the royal capital of Buda and occupied the Szerémség, then withdrew from Hungary. The last three months of the year were marked by a vacuum of power: political authority was in a state of collapse, yet the victors chose not to impose their rule.
Two candidates stepped into the breech. One was John Szapolyai, Transylvania's voivode, and Hungary's most prominent aristocrat; the other, the Austrian Archduke Ferdinand Habsburg, who was the late king's brother-in-law and the brother of the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V. Their contest for power would determine the course of Hungary's history, and that of Transylvania as well, for the region's fate was intimately tied in these crucial decades to that of the mother country.
The majority of Hungary's ruling elite backed Szapolyai, who for fifteen years had been playing a leading role in Hungarian political life. Part of the aristocracy acknowledged his leadership, and he enjoyed the enthusiastic support — not always reciprocated — of the lesser nobility. Most of his opponents succumbed at Mohács: the Hungarian branch of the Jagiello dynasty became defunct, and its pro-Habsburg following was decimated.
{1-594.} A small minority of aristocrats sided with Ferdinand. The German dynasty's main argument — one that many historians would judge to be decisive — was that it could assist Hungary against the Ottomans, although, in 1526, the promise rang empty. Hungary had been fighting the Ottomans for over a century, during which time the German Empire and the Habsburg dynasty had offered much encouragement but no tangible help. The likelihood of assistance was further reduced by the conflict of Ferdinand's older brother, Emperor Charles V and the French King Francis I that once again flared into open war in the summer of 1526. This circumstance led the voivode to discount the threat lurking behind the Habsburgs' candidacy: that Hungary would have to contend not only with the Ottomans, but also with an attack from the west.
Thus Szapolyai took no notice of his rival's protests, nor of those voiced by the few Hungarians who rallied to Ferdinand. On 10 November 1526, Szapolyai had himself proclaimed king by the diet at Székesfehérvár, and he was duly crowned the next day.
Profiting from nine months of relative calm, King John I strove to restore state authority. He drew on his vast private wealth, the unconditional support of the lesser nobility, and the assistance of some aristocrats to impose his policies in domestic affairs. However, in the crucial sphere of foreign relations, success eluded him. He sought an entente with the Habsburgs, proposing to form an alliance against the Ottomans, but Archduke Ferdinand, who had himself elected king by a rump diet in December 1526, rejected all attempts at reconciliation. Hungary's envoys fanned out across Europe in quest of support. Only in France did they find a positive response, but even that was ineffective since Francis I was intent not on reconciling Hungary and the Habsburgs, but on drawing Hungary into a war against Charles V and his family.
Europe's political balance underwent a major shift in the summer of 1527, when, in a somewhat unplanned operation, mercenary forces of the emperor occupied Rome and drove the Pope, one of {1-595.} France's principal allies, to capitulate. This development freed Ferdinand — who also acquired the Czech throne in late 1526 — from the burden of assisting his brother. By then, Ferdinand had developed a Hungarian policy that was fully in keeping with the interests of his realms. He judged that if Hungary, unable to resist the Ottomans, took action independently of Austria and Bohemia, it might well enter into an alliance with the preponderant Ottoman empire against its western neighbours. It was therefore in the interest of the Austrian hereditary provinces and of the Czech crown lands that the Habsburgs gain control of Hungary, by force if necessary.



Prelude: The Disintegration of Medieval Hungary
https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/99.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:35:37]
In July 1527, an army of German mercenaries invaded Hungary. The moment was well chosen, for the forces of King John I were tied up in the southern counties, where Slavonic peasants, incited by Ferdinand, had rebelled; the revolt was led by the 'Black Man', Jován Cserni. In one sweep, the invaders captured Buda. Szapolyai hurriedly redeployed his army, but on 27 September, near Tokaj, it suffered a bloody defeat.
King John fled across the Tisza and sought refuge in his home province of Transylvania. The support that he had hoped to find there did not materialize. Indeed, by early winter, what he had believed would be a secure stronghold turned against him. Georg Reicherstorffer, Ferdinand's clever and resourceful emissary, incited the people of Brassó, and then those of other Saxon towns to rise against the beleaguered monarch. Another agent, Gáspár Vingárti Horvát, manipulated the nobility in the same direction; under his encouragement, the voivode Péter Perényi, who was guardian of the crown, delivered that symbol of royal authority to Ferdinand, who managed to have himself crowned King of Hungary at Székesfehérvár on 3 November 1527.
Szapolyai's remaining followers in Transylvania put up a stubborn resistance; István Tomori held out until July 1528 in the fortress at Fogaras. To avoid being trapped in his mountainous {1-596.} province, King John prepared to cross the Királyhágó (Kings' Pass) and spend the winter in the Tisza region, but, before he did so, he took a decision that was to prove fateful for Hungary as well as for Transylvania.
The preceding year's setbacks convinced King John that, at the time of his coronation, he had miscalculated his rival's chances and intentions. His major mistake was to have believed that the German Empire's European war would keep Ferdinand from attacking Hungary. Had he been equally mistaken in believing that the Habsburgs could not protect Hungary from the Ottomans? The sight of the triumphant Germans led many Hungarians to opine — sincerely or out of calculation — that such help could be effective, but John I disagreed. From the end of 1526 onwards, the Ottomans had made repeated offers of 'friendship', but once Ferdinand had seized power, they renewed their attacks on Hungary's southern frontier. All this reinforced Szapolyai's conviction that the Ottomans would not peacefully assent to the installation of Habsburg power in Hungary. Experience told him that of the two, the Ottomans were the stronger power.
Thus King John dispatched an envoy from Kolozsvár, bearing an offer of alliance, to the sultan in Istanbul. The decision had been difficult, for Hungarian policy was traditionally hostile to the Ottomans, and it went against the Hungarians' Christian conscience. The decisive factor was probably the rebellion in Transylvania; in this increasingly hopeless situation, Szapolyai finally made his fateful choice. The envoy, the Polish nobleman Hieronym Łaski, soon accomplished his mission. On 29 February 1528, the sultan assented to an alliance with John I and gave written assurance of his support:
'To His Majesty, John, by the grace of God King of Hungary, Dalmatia, Croatia, and Moravia: I, Sultan Suleiman shah, invincible lord of the Ottomans, swear upon the almightiness, holiness, and glory of God on high [...] upon the strength of Heaven and the {1-597.} colour of the Earth, upon the Sun, the Moon, the Stars, upon the Earth and the holy and mighty Mohammed [...] upon my father, and my mother's milk, upon my bread and my sabre, my life and my soul, I swear to thee, my illustrious kinsman, that I shall never ignore your call for help, not even if I am dispossessed of my empire and realms [...] And even if I were abandoned by all, it would be my duty to find thee and say: here I am, ready to respond to all your wishes. Should I or my descendants fail to keep this promise, let the anger of Almighty God and his truth be called down on my head, and let me perish by it ... let the Earth not bear my steps but open up and swallow my body and soul forever'.[1]
By that time, Szapolyai had rallied his troops east of the Tisza for a counterattack directed at Kassa. On 8 March, in a battle near Szina (Abaúj county), he once again suffered defeat. Along with a small retinue, he found shelter in Poland, at Tarnów Castle.
However, John's assumption, that the Ottomans would intervene in Hungary, proved correct. In the autumn of 1528, Suleiman I had declared that he would drive the Habsburgs out of Hungary. Meanwhile, the Hungarian aristocrats and lesser nobles who had readily rallied to King Ferdinand grew disillusioned. The new government showed signs of bankruptcy and impotence; it failed to muster strength not only against the Ottomans, but even against John's scattered followers.
When Szapolyai learned of the sultan's preparations for war, he made another attempt to reconquer his homeland.



Prelude: The Disintegration of Medieval Hungary
https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/99.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:35:37]
The risk was well calculated, for by the end of 1528, after a series of minor battles, his forces controlled most of the Great Plain. The following year, Suleiman launched an offensive that took the Ottomans' horsetail standard as far as the gates of Vienna. There, his military successes came to an end, and when he drew his army out of Hungary, the forces of King Ferdinand I recaptured most of Transdanubia. Untouched by war, Upper Hungary remained under the control of Ferdinand's followers, but King John held on to the {1-598.} southern and eastern counties of Transdanubia to the Great Plain, and he soon prevailed in Transylvania as well.
The period that followed was marked by chaos and war. The Ottomans launched periodic attacks, including, in 1532, another unsuccessful attempt to take Vienna; the Habsburgs mounted minor counter-offensives, including a fruitless siege of Buda in late 1530. The opposing forces were well matched, and the front line that materialized in 1529 remained essentially stable. Three years after the battle of Mohács, and despite the desperate attempts of Hungarian politicians in both camps to reunite the country, Hungary remained divided into two parts.
The Ottomans benefited the most from this situation, for much of Hungary, formerly their most powerful enemy in Europe, had fallen into their sphere of influence. However, their success was qualified, for the Habsburgs had secured a foothold in western Hungary, there to build a seemingly impregnable line of defence. King Ferdinand's success was equally qualified: although Austria and Bohemia were secured by the strong defensive positions he had established in Hungary, the original goal, to impose his rule over all Hungary, remained a dream. Nor could King John claim victory. To be sure, he had made a comeback, but he had been compelled to ally himself with Hungary's traditional enemy, the Ottomans.
The biggest losers in the wars that followed the battle of Mohács were the principal defenders of the medieval Hungarian state, the ruling aristocracy; their country stood divided and ruled by foreign powers. Both kings' followers lamented this catastrophe and blamed the other side. King John had erred in assuming that the Habsburgs would not intervene; his opponents, for their part, had overestimated the scope and impact of the intervention. The two parties accepted the creation of separate state administrations in the divided country only as a temporary expedient; they retained the hope that the division could be ended by the 'conversion' or elimination of their opponents.
{1-599.} Royal authority suffered a precipitous decline, particularly in the east. In 1528, Szapolyai lost much of his family estate, and he failed to regain any of it. Only Buda, Solymos, and Lippa remained crown lands. The lesser nobility's support proved to be of little value in the war. State revenues plummeted, for the royal treasury no longer disposed of the taxes paid by the counties, including the mines, under Ferdinand's control, nor of the related customs duties.
John I made some efforts to resolve these problems. He tried to win over the inhabitants of large market towns on the Great Plain, people who had enriched themselves in the cattle and wine trade and were — despite their nominal villein status — regarded as cívises (peasant-citizens). Lippa was raised to the status of a free royal borough in 1528. In 1529, peasant-citizens were settled in Buda to take the place of expelled German burghers. The villeins' right to free movement, abrogated in 1514, was restored in 1530. In 1537, Hungarian peasant-burghers were settled in Kassa.
However, the royalist sympathies of the peasant-citizens and their material support was not sufficient to compensate for the attrition in the king's power. The rule of aristocratic landowners, which had caused many problems in the period before Mohács, was blatantly reimposed in King John's part of the country — by Bálint Török in Veszprém and Somogy counties, by Péter Perényi in Baranya and Zemplén counties, by Imre Czibak (until his death in 1534) in Bihar county, by István Werbőczy in Tolna and Nógrád counties, by the voivode Maylád (1534–40) in Fogaras, by Péter Petrovics in Temes county, and by the Kosztkas, Podmaniczkys, Bebeks and Ráskays in other parts of the country. They ruled in the king's name, but pursued their individual interests. There was no question of restricting their activities, for the more powerful a landlord, the more likely he was to defect to the other side in the event of some 'insult'. One of Ferdinand's Hungarian advisers reported bitterly: 'As long as the country remains divided, Your Majesty will not be able to exercise your royal prestige and power. Anyone who {1-600.} feels that his interests are at risk, or who is worried about incurring legal proceedings and punishment, will join the enemy. The countless malefactors will seek to escape punishment by changing sides. There will be a proliferation of illegal activity on both sides, giving rise to further disorder and wars'.[2]

https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/99.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:35:37]
Neither side could offer a remedy for the country's ills, and it is scarcely surprising that in such a political climate, personal unreliability and duplicity should be common. The spreading sense of hopelessness was well reflected in the ideological poverty of the two sides. The Habsburg camp professed the medieval belief in Christian unity, while Szapolyai's followers manifested the anti-German aspect of the nobility's patriotism. Both sides remained ineffectual. When, in 1529, King John hastened to Mohács to greet the sultan, his followers refused to accompany him, although at other times they would loudly proclaim their friendship for the Ottomans.
Another riddle is why King John failed to seize upon the Reformation, which at this time was emerging as an antiHabsburg force in the German Empire. This cannot be fully accounted for by the personal convictions and enduring attachment to the Catholic faith and his closest associates (Imre Czibak, István Werbőczy, István Brodarics, Ferenc Frangepán, and, later, György Fráter). The spread of the Reformation in Hungary was not helped by the fact that it was mediated by the Germans, initially by the wife of Louis II, Mary Habsburg. Nor did it help that King John formed enduring links with Rome, which at times was overtly hostile to the Habsburgs. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, it would have been difficult for Hungary to break way from its traditional religious community at a time when its accommodation with the Ottomans inspired charges that it was betraying Christianity.

Settlements and Villages in Transylvania at the Time of the Conquest and in the early Árpádian Period
{1-315.} Monasteries, Churches, and Churchyards
In 1092, the synod at Szabolcs ordained that people bury their dead in the proximity of the newly-founded churches, and most of the 'pagan' cemeteries were closed down. This third phase in the development of popular culture was mentioned earlier in reference to Biharvár, Kolozsmonostor, and Gyulafehérvár. The transition is vividly illustrated at Várfalva, where a church (now in the centre of the village, and used by the Unitarians) and its cemetery were founded at the time of Ladislas I; the oldest graves held coins dating from Coloman and Béla II. In Szászfehéregyháza (where the original inhabitants had not been Szász, i.e. Saxons), the first burials date from Coloman's time, when a church was erected.
A number of other churchyards that date from around 1100 have been excavated — mostly under professional supervision — in Transylvania, and graves have yielded hair-rings and coins. The sites include Doboka-Váralja, with three churches and churchyards, and some 800 excavated graves; Kide (where the finds include coins dating from Béla II and Ladislas II); Konop, Malomfalva- Csittfalva (hair-rings, hairpins with flat, round heads, and coins from the time of Stephen II and Béla II), Marosszentmihály, Torda (obuli of Béla II and Géza II), Székelykeresztúr, Székelyudvarhely, Székelydálya, Marosvásárhely (hairpins with flat, round heads), Marosszentgyörgy, Györgyfalva, Almaszeg, Csapószentgyörgy, Váralmás (coins dating from Béla III), and Nagybánya, where a golden hair-ring with S-shaped tip — of a type that is specific to this period — was found. One could add to this list the graves at the 12th century wood-and-stone church (dated by coins from the time of Béla II) in Sztrigyszentgyörgy, and the graveyard indicated by some finds (large hair-rings with S-shaped tips) at Fogaras. In the Temes region, some noteworthy traces have been found at Temeskenéz (obulus of Stephen II) and Illyéd-Vártemplom (a small church with an early, double-pillared choir). Early monasteries, {1-316.} linked to clans, naturally had their own cemeteries, as can be seen at Kaplonymonostor as well as at Ó-(Hódos-)Bodrogmonostor, where the settlement dates back to the time of Ladislas I. At Mojgrád, next to a chapel that had been built upon Roman ruins, there is a graveyard that was in use from the time of Béla II until that of Ladislas IV; one of the finds at Mojgrád is a 'Kiev type' bronze reliquary cross.
These churches were all founded by the Western, 'Latin' church. The proximate grave-finds — late-period hairrings, fibulae, rings, obuli, and crosses — are similar to those in Hungary's other Árpádian churchyards.
In southern Transylvania, a number of Hungarian and Székely (Orbó, Kézd, Sebes!) graveyards have been found under or near Saxon churches that had been erected around 1200. They are of importance in tracing the history of settlement: the older graves, dated by coins and hair-rings, must have formed part of the cemeteries of wood or stone churches dating from the 11th–12th centuries, antedating the settlement of Saxons. This is the case at Szászsebes/Mühlbach, Medgyes/Mediasch, Szászorbó/Urwegen (early veil-pins), Szászkézd/Keisd (bronze reliquary cross), Nádpatak/Rohrbach, Kelnek/Kelling, and Szászfehéregyháza/ Weisskirchen/Deutschweisskirch. In the last-named locality, the remnants of an earlier stone church (the so-called chapel) and its extensive cemetery were found under the Gothic church; the graves yielded hair-rings with S- shaped tips, as well obuli from the time of Coloman (found placed in the deceased's mouth) and other early 12th-century coins. The stone foundations of an earlier Romanesque church have been uncovered by the north wall of a large Saxon church at Homoróddaróc/Draas. The graves (nearly 100) that were excavated in its churchyard yielded funeral obuli dating from Géza II and Stephen III, as well as 12th-century jewels (hair-rings with S-shaped tips, a double lyre-shaped bronze clip, a lead disk pendant with a Latin inscription, twisted and headed {1-317.} rings) that match those found in other Hungarian churchyards dating from the 12th century. (The jewels also bear relevance to the cemeteries in the Háromszék, which will be noted below.) The pattern in the Szászföld (the Saxons' region) is repeated along the Nagy-Szamos, at Ó-Radna/Rodna, where traces of a Hungarian church were found under the German church; the find of a coin dating from Stephen III indicates that the same may be the case at Kisdisznód/Michelsberg.

problem, for there is no trace of a church near the cemetery. Judging from the coins found in the graves, the cemetery may have been opened during the reign of Géza II, and remained in use no later than that of Béla III. However, some of the finds (a late copy of a Conquest-period ring, and a lyre-shaped clip) may date from an earlier period. Other finds, such as some fine headed rings dating from the 12th–13th century, bore the signs of prolonged use. A very similar community must have been served by the cemetery uncovered at nearby SzékelyPetőfalva-Alsóhatár; again, there is no trace of a church. A quantity of coins dating from the time of Géza II, Stephen III, and Béla III were found in the 238 excavated graves. The burials are uncommonly rich for the period: the graves yielded gold jewellery as well as several beautiful, Árpádian headed rings from the 12th century. These relics testify to an affluent, free community that clung to traditional dress and customs. The above finds and observations point to villages of Hungarian border-guards (late-period arrowheads in iron-bound quivers!), who were dispatched to these western and southern border zones in the 12th century. These are the earliest traces of Székelys in the Orbaiszék region.

Barons and Other Nobles 3. FROM THE MONGOL INVASION TO THE
BATTLE OF MOHÁCS Saxon Towns and Political Unity
{1-471.} Székelys and Gerébs in the Nobility
Székely society had always displayed features that came to be associated with the nobility, notably individual liberty and the obligation to perform military service. Thus, by the 14th century, the Székely was considered even outside his home turf to be equivalent to a nobleman; for instance, in 1346, Pál Sényői merely had to prove his Székely ancestry in order to be allowed to live as a freeman anywhere in the country. In the Székelyföld, on the other hand, the traditions of common property and equality inhibited individual self-assertion, a quality fully displayed by county nobility. The drive to acquire great estates and exploit the labour of villeins was notably lacking among Székelys. Early on, the more enterprising Székelys sought their fortune in the service of the king, who rewarded them with shares in the former royal estates. Not wishing to give up their share of the Székelys' common inheritance, they tried to obtain grants in the Székelyföld, or in adjoining counties. The royal estates that had been wedged in among Székely lands were the first lands to be transferred to this new, Székely nobility. In 1252, the king donated to his Székely follower Bencenc, son of Akadás, a property called Szék; situated on the periphery of the Barcaság and Háromszék, it had probably formed part of the lands attached to the royal castle of Miklósvár. Bencenc — an ancestor of the distinguished Nemes, Mikó, and Kálnoki families — settled Hungarians and Székelys in a number of newly-founded villages. However, they wanted to treat villages that had Székely rights — including Zsombor, Gerebenc, Málnás, and Oltszem — in the manner of feudal nobles, and between 1342 and 1366 they were pitted in fierce battle against the Székelys of Sepsi. In the end, the latter prevailed, and the villages remained attached to the Székelyföld, although the Székelys failed to gain control over the territory of Szék. Also in the 13th century, the king granted Bálványos castle and the attached villages of Hungarians and {1472.} Magyarized Slavs to the Székely ancestor of the Kézdi and Apor families. The new owners brought in Hungarian and Russian settlers as villeins and had the area put under county administration, but their claim to the district of Kászon was successfully challenged in 1324 by the Székelys of Csík. The Törcsvár estate, situated between Saxon and Székely territories, was granted, first to the Bölöni Forró, then to the Uzoni Béldi family. Towards the end of the Middle Ages, the Béldis also received the royal estate at Kézdiszentlélek, which was surrounded by Székely lands. Thanks to their other county estates, they had earlier risen to the ranks of Transylvanian aristocracy; at the same time, they still owned lands with Székely rights.
In the course of the Middle Ages, many other prominent Székely families acquired noble estates — partly from royal donations, party from intermarriage with county nobility — in the eastern parts of counties around the Székelyföld, namely, Fehér, Küküllő, Torda, Kolozs, and Doboka counties. They bore such 'Székely surnames' as Szentkirályi Semjén, Tuzsoni Bolgár, Meggyesfalvi Alárd, Szentgyörgyi Bicsak, Lázár, Nyujtódi, Damokos, Sepsi-Baconi, Teremi, Backamadarasi, Dobai, and Fiátfalvi Náznán. It was hardly coincidental that the leading offices in the Székely clan structure, those of judge and lieutenant, were held by members of these families: only Székelys of established wealth and distinction could aspire to serve as armoured warriors of noble rank, which was an obligation for all landowners in the counties. Naturally, they received the material benefits tied to these offices, notably a share of the Székelys' communal property. Many of these families enjoyed a privileged economic status in the Székelyföld as well as the counties, and consequently played a leading role in both areas, with one member serving as a county judge and another as a Székelyföld official.
However, most Székelys lacked the means to purchase armoured and served, instead, in the light cavalry. In Western {1-473.} Hungary, this traditional military arm was fast disappearing, for contemporary European warfare required troops in armour. After the Mongol invasion, a king would no longer call to arms all those eligible by virtue of their social status; instead, he demanded a fixed number of soldiers equipped to the highest standard. As a result, the men who were no longer required were reduced to providing for the equipment and other needs of those on active service, and in effect they became villeins subjected to the economic and legal authority of the latter. Such was the lot of the Cumanians and Jazyges, who had settled during the 13th century in the Danube-Tisza corridor. Initially, all of their menfolk were obligated to perform military service for the king; when the requirement was changed to 600 soldiers, the latter drove the common folk into feudal servitude, breaking up the

social homogeneity of these communities. In Transylvania, on the other hand, the external threat throughout the Middle Ages came from Mongols, Lithuanians, Romanians, and then the Ottomans, peoples who used light cavalry in warfare, and the Székelys' similar, traditional military style remained appropriate for defence. Since even Székelys of modest means could afford equipment for light cavalry, they retained both the right and obligation to personal military service, and the attendant personal liberty.
As noted, the settlement of Saxons considerably reduced the size of the Székelys' own territory and their freedom to graze stock — especially horses — on open pastures. They therefore turned from horse-breeding to cattlebreeding, a shift reflected in the spread of the tax known as 'ox-roasting'. As the Székely population grew in numbers, agriculture came to match stock-breeding in importance. However, since the Székelyföld was short of cultivable land, the change upset the economic balance that had propped up their social system. Land, rather than stock, became the measure of social status. The clans redistributed the jointly-held land each year by the ostensibly equitable device of drawing arrows, but the more {1-474.} prominent families received a larger share. Moreover, the latter added to their holdings by having woodlands cleared by the labour of prisoners of war — a practice that was dying out in the rest of Hungary, but prevalent in this region as late as the 15th century. In Hungarian customary law, arable lands obtained by clearing were not redistributed each year, as was the case with common land, but became the freehold of the individual responsible for the clearing. The practice led to the emergence of a Székely landowning aristocracy, a class that would acquire economic predominance and fill official posts. In principle, the offices of lieutenant and judge were filled in rotation by each clan and family branch of free Székelys; in practice, the wealthier families enjoyed a marked advantage, for their property bestowed on them the prestige necessary for selection. Property became a precondition for appointment to public office, and the heir to the estate would inherit the office as well. This is probably how the practice arose, that when a property was sold, the office linked to it would be assumed by the buyer. Thus, by the end of the Middle Ages, several branches of non-Székely, Hungarian families (e.g. the Barcsai and Apafi families) would lay claim to Székely offices.
The tight link between property and public office is related to the rigidity of the Székely social system. The establishment of Székely administrative districts, the széks, at the beginning of the 14th century marked the end of the era of settlement. As the name suggests, a seat corresponded to an area under the jurisdiction of a judge (sedes judiciaria). The first seat in rank was Udvarhely; the others were Maros, Csík, Aranyos, Sepsi, Kézdi and Orbai. (In modern times, the last three were also known collectively as Háromszék.) At the end of the Middle Ages, some new seats were formed from fragments of the original ones: thus Keresztúr and Bardóc were carved out of Udvarhelyszék, Szereda from Marosszék, and Gyergyó as well as Kászon from Csíkszék. Since both Saxon and Romanian seats appeared around the same period, {1-475.} it is safe to assume that the creation of seats was part of an administrative reorganization conducted by Charles Robert. The precedents can be found in Western Hungary, where the term 'seat' was applied earlier to county districts as well as to the judicial and administrative districts of privileged groups — the noble lancers of Szepes, the Cumanians, and the Jazyges. In the courts of the Székely seats, justice was administered by clan lieutenants and seat judges (székbírák), under the supervision of the Székely count's deputy. The influence of the noble counties soon made itself felt in the Székely seats, probably by way of these deputies, the latter being mainly Hungarian noble retainers of the Hungarian aristocrat who served as count. The deputies were initially called sub-counts (alispán, vicecomes), the title used in the counties. Their title was subsequently changed to that borne by the king's representatives in Saxon seats, to royal judges (királybíró, iudex regius). The counties' influence was also evident in the institution of associate judges (bírótárs, iurati assessores), of which there were twelve in the seats, just like in the counties.
The transformation of Saxon society was as painful as that of the Székelys, but it went in a wholly different direction. Here, as elsewhere, military considerations predominated in the general shift to feudalism. The Saxons, unlike the Székelys, had no personal obligation to perform military service. Instead, their community was bound to provide a certain number of soldiers. Thus, from the start, the social advantages linked to military service accrued to only a small group, principally to the gerébs; as noted, the latter had the king's mandate to administer the German settlers. The office of geréb, which combined the functions of judge, administrative authority, and military commander, was passed on by right of inheritance. Thus, much as in the case of the Székelys, the office and the attendant property became inseparable; it could be sold or mortgaged. The geréb was bound by the interests of his community: he had to abide by the Saxons' laws and bear his share of communal {1-476.} taxes. And he, like the wealthier Székelys, would have to seek opportunities beyond his district, in the noble counties. That was where the gerébs obtained estates in reward for their military service, estates that they proceeded to people with Saxons.

They treated these settlers not as free and equal compatriots, but as villeins. Thus did Saxon villeinage appear, in the 13th century, on lands beyond the confines of the Szászföld.
The gerébs administered their county villages in the style of nobles, according to the nobility's laws. Indeed, many of them were ennobled by the king; the first known case, that of the comes (count) János Latin, a man of Walloon origin who lived in Voldorf, dates from 1206. Otherwise, they were still regarded as noblemen but were distinguished from fully-entitled nobles (hence the reference in 1358 to nobiles et alii comites). The main reason for this distinction was that the gerébs (again, like Székely notables) did not renounce their property in the Szászföld; indeed, they used the power derived from their county holdings to buttress their preeminence in the Szászföld. The evolution of Saxon society in the 13th and 14th centuries is marked by the growing entrenchment of the dominant geréb families. The latter held all the posts in local self-government and came to symbolize the military and economic power. Their lifestyle, which imitated that of the propertied Hungarian nobles, made a deep impact on all aspects of Saxon culture.
In the 14th century, the Saxons' society and economy was based on the agricultural village. (Indeed, this continued to apply to the majority of Saxons even in modern times.) The pattern of local power was the same throughout medieval Europe: the village's natural leader was the noble landowner-warrior. For the Saxons, the geréb was this indispensable leader. To be sure, his power undermined the principle of equal rights, but the geréb families were uniquely endowed with administrative and judicial experience and authority, qualities that were nurtured and passed on from generation {1-477.} to generation. Although they would resist the occasional abuse of power, ordinary Saxons yielded voluntarily to the authority of the gerébs, and thereby acknowledged the ruling status of the Hungarian nobility. With their county estates, and by way of intermarriage, the Saxon gerébs forged intimate links with the Hungarian nobility. They aspired to the latter's way of life and made every effort at assimilation. Adopting the nobles' custom, they took on the name of an estate, preferably the one, outside the Szászföld, that gave rise to their own noble status. Sometimes only a German given name or the surname Geréb would betray the Saxon origin of a noble family. Thus, over time, the geréb families became wholly Magyarized. As noted, the wealthiest among them — the Talmácsi, Kelneki, Alvinci, Kentelki, and Vingárti Geréb families — became assimilated on the female line to the Hungarians. The less wealthy families broke with their Saxon roots to became assimilated on the male line as well; such was the case with the Apoldi, Nádasdi, Hidegvizi, Pókafalvi, Alcinai, Dályai, Vizaknai Geréb, Balázsfalvi, Hosszútelki, and Kisenyedi families in Fehér county, and with the Drági, Zsombori, and Kajlai families in Doboka county. Several of their members ended up as county officials, as sub-counts or county magistrates. In the fifteenth century, a member of the Vizaknai Geréb family became deputy voivode of Transylvania, and then Székely count. These talented Saxons, endowed with qualities of leadership, were a valuable addition to Transylvania's nobility, but they scarcely transformed that caste: the vast majority of nobles were of Hungarian origin, and it was the non-Hungarian recruits who became fully assimilated.
At the end of the 15th century, there were still some gerébs who played a prominent role in Saxon society, but their number was steadily falling. In the meantime, the Saxon community had been evolving in a direction that did not match the interests of the gerébs. Partly due to pressure from the Saxon middle classes, who were intent on preserving equality of rights and social cohesion, partly of {1-478.} their own free will, the gerébs gave up the lands and offices that they had held in the Szászföld and moved to the noble counties, where they lived on as noblemen. Thus, in the end, the principle of equal rights prevailed: a Saxon nobility did not become entrenched in the Szászföld, and the Saxon peasants did not sink into villeinage.

The Saxon Towns and the First (Lutheran) Wave of the Reformation in Transylvania
The New State and Its External Environment in the mid-1500s
The state that emerged from the ruins of the medieval Hungarian kingdom, and which by century's end was officially known as the Principality of Transylvania, was not favoured by historical circumstances. It was buffeted by irresistible, external forces that were anything but beneficial to its peaceful development.
The harshest and most immediate of these factors was the perpetual state of war induced by Ottoman expansion. It brought significant territorial losses to the fledgling state. The fragment of Hungary ruled by King John had extended from Lake Balaton to Brassó, and from Titel and Karánsebes to Kassa. Turkish conquests in the 1540s and 1550s moved the frontiers to east of the Tisza and north of Temesvár, and many of the remaining Hungarian counties — including the Partium — became permanent war-zones.
Successive armistices and peace treaties failed to guarantee lasting tranquillity along the frontier. Even when the major military campaigns came to an end, a 'little war' of attrition would rage without respite. Even at its height, Turkish power could not preserve its Hungarian domain from raids by light cavalry coming from the royal (or Transylvanian) border forts; and the Ottomans, too, would conduct raids behind enemy lines. Thanks to the marauding hussars, the Hungarian nobility was able to keep watch over the lands it had lost, and this was to have important consequences when the Ottomans were eventually driven out. Moreover, {1-658.} the Hungarian border forts could survive only by launching raids that brought plunder and weakened the enemy's front-line defences.
An inevitable consequence of this type of warfare was the emergence and expansion of a zone that paid taxes to both sides. A large part of this zone consisted of the principality's 'parts' east of the Tisza. In the early 1550s, some 53 per cent of the manors in Bihar county paid taxes to Turkish landlords and the Turkish treasury, and this despite the fact that the Porte acknowledged John Sigismund's rule over the county. Even some of Hunyad county's eastern villages ended up in Halil bey's defter (the Turkish tax register).
The new line of demarcation resulting from the Turkish advances also led to creation of a new customs border. By the 1550s, Transylvania had established a network of customs posts (for collection of the 'thirtieth') on the western perimeter of the Partium, at Várad, Debrecen, Bajom, Székelyhíd, Margitta, Nagyfalu, Hídvég, Zilah, and Zsibó. The system underwent frequent modification; for a time, Kolozsvár also had a customs house. By 1586, customs duties were collected also at Karánsebes, Szászváros, Hunyad, Magyarzsombor, Varadia, Dés, Körösbánya, and Zilah, and, four years later, at Déva and Nagybánya as well. The Hungarian and royal parts of Hungary imposed their own customs duties, at Tokaj, Vác, and other points. Thus merchants moving between Transylvania and Italy or Austria, within the territory of the former Hungary, had to cross two additional frontiers, and pay duty four times; those trading with Poland needed to pay duty twice.
That brings up the second consequence for Transylvania of the changed external environment, the decline in her foreign trade. Inevitably, trade suffered from the unending war and the multiplication of customs duties. The principal trading route, which linked Transylvania to central Hungary and Vienna (Vienna — Vác — {1-659.} Szolnok — Debrecen/Nagyvárad — Kolozsvár) remained busy even after the Turkish occupation, but it came to serve mainly the region east of the Tisza. Traders from beyond the Királyhágó, in Transylvania proper, preferred the more secure, northern route, from Kolozsvár to Kassa and westward along the Vág valley. Due to this shift, Cracow joined Vienna as the principal destination of Transylvanian trade.
Trade with the south also declined. The trading routes along the Maros valley toward Italy and Dalmatia fell into disuse. Trade between Saxon towns and their traditional markets, the Romanian principalities, stagnated, first because of the recurrent wars, then because of the policies pursued by the Turkish administration. In 1568, the Porte prohibited Moldavia and Wallachia from selling their principal products — mainly comestibles, such as grain, livestock, butter, and wine — to any country other than Turkey. The intention was to reserve the rich agricultural output of the nearby vassal states for Istanbul, which had grown into a metropolis of several hundred thousand people. In the event, the effectiveness of the measure was undermined by the Turkish economy's

backwardness and the covert resistance of the Romanian principalities. To be sure, Transylvania had never imported much grain from south of the Carpathians, but the Turkish restrictions had a generally dampening effect on its trade.
Most of the trade with Moldavia and Wallachia originated in Beszterce, Brassó, and Szeben, towns that had long enjoyed staple rights. Of these, Beszterce was the least important: in 1552, its customs office was leased out for 200 forints, which suggests that the duties normally collected were something in excess of that sum. In 1569, the cost of the lease fell to 70 forints, then rose to 100–120 forints around 1574. The statistics on customs duties collected at Brassó reveal similar decline and stagnation. In 1503, the turnover in foreign trade at Brassó was valued at some 167,000 forints. In 1530, at the height of the domestic wars in Transylvania, it stood at {1-660.} around 33,000 forints, but even at the time of the short lived economic boom after 1550, the turnover amounted to no more than 80,000 forints, and another decline set in at the end of century. The turnover in trade at Nagyszeben seldom amounted to more than half of that at Brassó, and it underwent similar fluctuations.
The fate of the province's prized mines (salt, gold, and non-ferrous metals) gave further evidence of Transylvania's economic isolation from western and eastern markets. In the 1520s, the salt-deposits were leased by one of Europe's biggest entrepreneurs, the Fugger family; to negotiate with them, King John called on no less a man than Gritti, the Italian-Turkish agent of the Istanbul government. When, in the mid-1530, the salt-mines momentarily had no owner, some Bavarian businessmen took up the challenge, but they were the last foreigners to show any interest. In 1541, and for some years thereafter, local interests with little capital made attempts to operate the mines. After the advent of the principality, the efforts of government and those of transplanted Italians (including the famous physician Biandrata) brought no substantial improvement.
The erosion of foreign interest in Transylvania cannot be wholly attributed to the geopolitical circumstances of the new state. The 'encirclement' of Transylvania coincided with a major shift in the world economy, which may be regarded as the third external factor influencing the region's development. It was not only prudence that kept Western European investors away from the war-torn Carpathian Basin. (After pulling out of Transylvania, the Fuggers, in 1546, also gave up their copper mines in Upper Hungary.) In the mid-1500s, Europe turned to economic exploitation of the lands that its adventurous seamen had discovered a few decades earlier. Sailing around the Horn, Portuguese ships brought back silk from China and other rare and precious goods from India and the Spice Islands. Arabian traders recovered from the naval defeat inflicted by the Portuguese and once again plied their traditional route through the Persian Gulf or the Red Sea to the Levant {1-661.} and thence to Venice. However, the Arabs failed to regain their predominance, and the Europeans kept the lion's share of trade with the East, which produced immense profits for traders and entrepreneurs. Thus the wealthy burghers of Western Europe preferred to invest their energy and resources in developing trade with the distant East, and to neglect the less rewarding and more risky markets of the Levant and of eastern and southeastern Europe.
Spain's conquests in the Americas also had important consequences. Unprecedented amounts of precious metals, especially silver, began to flow from Mexico and Peru into Europe, and the trade grew at an astonishing rate: in the early 1540s, Mexico's mines were producing 3,400 kg of silver a year; the output reached 15,000 kg in the 1560s, 50,000 kg in the 1570s, and 74,000 kg at the end of the century. Peru's silver mines (the major one being at Potosi, in today's Bolivia) had an annual yield of 183,000 kg in the 1550s, 151,000 kg in the 1570s, and 255,000 kg at century's end. All these dwarfed the average output of some 5,000–6,000 kg a year in Hungary, previously one of Europe's principal producers of silver.
The development of transatlantic trade was accompanied by dynamic growth in Western Europe's industries. As towns expanded, they could no longer rely for their food supply on their overpopulated hinterlands. In any case, the agricultural sector had greater difficulty than industry in adapting to rising demand. Over the last sixty-odd years of the 16th century, the price of grain rose by a factor of 4–6, while the price of manufactured goods barely trebled. The growing need for money was met by imported gold and silver, and the result was steadily rising inflation.
These changes were eventually felt in the Carpathian Basin. The price changes in royal Hungary (which, by all indications, were reflected in Transylvania as well) are illustrative. Between the 1520s and the 1580s, the price of cattle grew threefold, of grain fivefold, and of wine, fourfold. The economic boom in the west brought a rise in the standard of living and induced population {1-662.} growth; the consequent, growing demand for foodstuffs could

only be satisfied through imports, and eastern Europe became a major supplier. Polish grain and Hungarian cattle found a ready, and highly profitable market.
Transylvania, a small and distant land, experienced only the adverse side of this development. The principality's agriculture was generally less developed than that of Hungary proper. There was no shortage of land, but the climate was less clement, and distance hampered the transmission of new methods of cultivation from Western Hungary. The Saxons were the most advanced in agriculture; by contrast, in the Székelyföld, the first attempts at three-course rotation date from the 1590s. The cultivation of vegetables and fruit also had late beginnings. Livestock was a major product, but the practice of open grazing remained predominant; only at the end of the century did the growth in livestock spur experiments in storing fodder and stabling the animals.
The exporting of Transylvania's grain to western Europe had never been profitable, and this situation did not change; in any case, the difficulties of transportation were insurmountable. In the wine trade, Transylvania could not compete with the nearby Hegyalja (the Tokaj wine-growing region). Hungarian cattle-breeding was concentrated in the Great Plain, of which only a small part belonged to the principality. Salt was a potentially valuable export commodity, but Poland also had salt-pits, and its major ones happened to be located along the Kassa-Cracow road, at Wieliczka and Bochnia.
Thus Transylvania continued to suffer from an unfavourable balance of trade. The decreasing exports of cattle could not compensate for even the lower volume of imports, which included textiles, manufactured goods, arms, and luxury goods. Precious metals helped somewhat to reduce the trade gap, but the lodes were not particularly rich, and the cost of labour was far higher than in the mines of Spanish America, which were worked mainly by enslaved {1-663.} natives. The competition was too strong, and production began to fall at Transylvania's mines. The trade deficit led to a shortage of money, and this at a time when the value of money in Transylvania, as in the rest of Europe, was being eroded by inflation.
This economic revolution laid the foundations of global trade and made Europe the world's richest and most rapidly developing region. It also gave great stimulus to Europe's cultural life. Renaissance culture, which had been nurtured in Italian towns made prosperous by trade with the Levant, spread to Flanders, then to Burgundy, France, and the rest of Europe. The abundance of money promoted expensive lifestyles and new artistic creations. In the late 1400s and early 1500s, some parts of eastern Europe profited sufficiently from the growth in trade and agricultural exports to partake in this cultural Renaissance. To be sure, the less 'expensive' aspect of this revival, intellectual humanism, had reached eastern Europe earlier. The impact of the Renaissance in Hungary went back to the age of the Hunyadis, and it reached a glittering peak during the reign of King Matthias, with the remarkably early introduction of new styles of art and architecture.
Although Transylvania did welcome a few early bearers of humanistic thought, its comparative poverty and remoteness delayed the arrival of the Renaissance. That delay had a significant consequence: the Reformation, that late and arguably most radical emanation of the Renaissance, reached the principality at about the same time as the earlier innovations in art, architecture, and lifestyle. Transylvania had suffered much in the course of the 16th century, and it was an open question how its economy might serve these new criteria of modernity. Transylvania's future, indeed, its very survival were at stake. An examination of how society evolved in the new state will throw some light on these issues.

The Gepids in the Period of Merovingian Culture
The relative political and economic stability that followed the Great Migrations contributed to the emergence in the early 6th century of a new 'culture' which spread from the Atlantic to Transylvania {1-204.} and the Carpathians. In Gaul, Clovis (Chlodvig), son of Childeric I, broke the power of the last 'Roman' sovereign and of the Frankish petty kings, and, having defeated the Alamanni (before 505) and ousted the Visigoths (507), he unified Gaul and the Rhenish region. This new, Merovingian dynasty allied itself with the Roman Catholic Church, and it created a secure environment for the functioning of latifundia as well as of larger and smaller manufactures in the towns. By the 530s, the Merovingians had extended their rule as far as the Saale (Thuringia), Bavaria, and the Alps.
The countries under Merovingian rule enjoyed a steady growth in economic prosperity. Estates and villages multiplied in an increasingly feudal context; in their vicinity, there appeared cemeteries of the 'lined' type, which would remain in use for centuries. The prosperity was only relative, but it benefited all social strata. The period of Great Migrations had been characterized by an immensely rich military aristocracy flaunting a luxurious attire, a small and wealthy military retinue, and a mass of poor warriors and labourers. In the 6th century, clothing styles became more elaborate, and graves with burial objects more common. People had clothes, ornaments, and weapons specific to their social rank or class, and they were buried with these objects. The unity of these styles owed not only to the 'fashion of the times' but also to the new, or newly flourishing jewellery and weapons crafts, and the makers and peddlers of beads. Pottery-making centres, glassworks, and bronze-casting workshops generated a uniformity in everyday goods.
The 'Western Merovingian' or 'Lined Graveyard' culture emerged on territories that were under direct Frankish rule. Farther east, the 'Eastern Merovingian/Lined Graveyard' culture spread in Thuringia, Bohemia, Moravia, Lower Austria, Burgenland, Transdanubia, the region east of the Tisza, and, lastly, in Transylvania. There are no traces of this culture beyond the Carpathian Basin. {1-205.} Indeed, even the Carpathian Basin was touched only to a limited degree by Frankish and Alamannic influences, and remained largely independent of the Merovingian world. Other political and economic centres had a greater impact on its culture: the Ostrogothic empire of Theodoric the Great which, between 493 and 535, exerted a major influence (through the neighbouring region between the Sava and Drava rivers, as well as Inner Noricum and Dalmatia), especially with regard to certain luxury articles (e.g. jewellery and goldsmith's work), and the Eastern Roman empire, which underpinned other aspects of the economy.
On the eastern fringe of the Merovingian world, the only people of Eastern Germanic origin and language to be touched by the new European culture were the Gepids, and theirs is a special case. As noted, the Gepids' jewellery, weapons, and pottery were crafted in accordance with their own independent traditions and roots. These influences did not disappear, and the onset of Merovingian influence did not induce a sharp cultural break. From the start, the Gepids' material culture had been enriched by a succession of external forces: by economic and political relations with the Eastern Roman empire, which brought Byzantine merchandise and techniques along the trade route of the Lower Danube; after 504, by Sirmia's Ostrogothic workshops and commerce; after 536, by the late antique-Italian Gothic legacy of Pannonia Sirmiensis, which again passed under Gepidic rule; and, after 538, even by the handicrafts of the Roman border zone on the other side of the Lower Danube. There are also traces of contacts between Gepids on both the Maros and the Tisza, and the Crimean Goths, until Slav migration began to threaten the connecting roads (that is, until 518, when Iustinus I ascended to the throne); and, in the region east of the Tisza, of direct and reciprocal contacts with Scandinavia (southern Sweden) until around 540–50. Among the three, 6thcentury centres of Gepidic settlement (the region east of the Tisza, Sirmia, and Transylvania), Transylvania had a certain distinctiveness that can {1-206.} be perceived in its local iron crafts and, to some extent in its goldsmith's art as well.

The Szilágynagyfalu Group
A group of archaeological finds that seems to bear no relation to others in the Carpathian basin is located around the upper reaches of the Szamos, Berettyó, and Kraszna rivers, on both sides of the Meszes mountains.
Two groups of tumulus cemeteries were discovered near Szilágy-Nagyfalu (as it was called in the 19th century), in the Berettyó valley. The larger one, overlooking the Rákos creek, consists of 43 mounds. The largest, the 'Nagyhalom' ('Big Mound', no. 7) had a diameter of 38 metres, while the others had a diameter of 6–10 metres. The height of the Nagyhalom was over six metres, that of the others between one and four metres. A second group, consisting of ten mounds, was discovered west of the Berettyó, on a plateau overlooking the 'Halmosd' stream, but it has yet to be fully excavated.
On the first site, mound no. 12 was excavated by Jakab Mattyasovszky in 1878, and mound no. 11 by Károly Torma in 1879. Mounds 2, 7, 10, and 13 were excavated in August-September 1880 by Flóris Rómer, Ferenc Pulszky, and József Hampel. Three other tumuli (mounds I–III) were explored by Maria Chişvasi-Comşa in 1958.
The funeral rites revealed by the mounds, or kurgans, had one common element, cremation. The tombs, which had been constructed on the surface before being buried under a mound, vary in structure. The first type had square vaults, built of interlocking beams or thick planks, and covered by boards. The vaults of the {1-259.} second type were smaller — indeed, more like large coffins — but of similar construction, and covered with stone slabs. The third type, without vault, held the ashes of one or more persons, along with pots, and a separately buried horse. All three types contained numerous vessels. Each group held from three to six urns, and mound 7 yielded four sets of vessels, or 20–22 dishes in all. Neither the early nor the more recent excavations give a clear indication of the number of persons buried under each kurgan. According to some accounts, all of the vessels contained ashes; others indicate that the ashes were scattered amidst the dishes. The ceramics that were found are generally alike: pots, made on a wheel, and decorated with bunched, horizontal lines over which come bunches of slanted, wavy lines. Mounds 10 and 11, on the other hand, yielded pots of the 'Medgyes type', made on a wheel.
The metal objects found (apart from Roman coins that had been placed, according to Avar custom, in the graves) provide a rough dating of the mounds. The earliest, from the first half of the 8th century, is a late Avar, cast-bronze belt ornament with a griffin-patterned pendant (no. 2, 'Rómer mound'). Of slightly later date is a piece of burnt strap-tip, of the same type as that found in grave 44 at Érsekújvár/Nové Zámky (mound 12). Another find in that mound is a buckle bearing tendril-patterned decoration on a worked background; it dates from the late 8th century, and is similar to pieces unearthed at Győr, Bozsok, Zimony, Tatárszentgyörgy, Tiszafüred, and Komárom. Kurgan III yielded a silver strap-tip (?), with filigreed decoration, that appears to be from the 9th century.
Traces of cooked meat confirm the 'pagan' character of the burials, as do the iron-hooped, wooden buckets that held drink. According to reports, only mound 12 held 'weapons'; the others yielded only iron knives of varying size. Two iron scythes were found next to the horse's skeleton.
Little evidence has surfaced regarding the homes of the Slav group in the Szilágyság. The settlement linked to the mound cemetery {1-260.} at Szilágynagyfalu was on the Nagyrét, where the finds consist mostly of tiles collected at the Benedek brickyard. More recently, a fairly large, sunken-floor house with a regular plan was excavated at Érszakácsi-Csobánkút, near Tasnád; the site yielded not only decorated tiles (fashioned on a wheel) and spindlewhorls of the Szilágynagyfalu type, but a number of hand-formed baking pans as well. However, those pans do not alter the conclusion that the site dates back to the 8th–9th century. The similar finds at Paptelek can be linked to the main settlement of the Szilágy group, at Mojgrád.
New light was thrown on the age and significance of the Szilágynagyfalu kurgans by a similar tumulus cemetery discovered at Kolozsvár-Szamosfalva, on the upper terrace of the Kis-Szamos River. Six of the seven burial mounds (with a diameter between 12 and 16 metres) have been excavated, and the initial reports concern four of

them. The structure of the vaults was essentially the same as that of the first type at Szilágynagyfalu; the only difference was that the rectangular 'log-houses' had been set in grave pits of varying depth. In vault no. I, urns holding the ashes stood in orderly groups, although ashes were also found scattered amidst the urns in the middle of the vault. Tumulus IV contained mainly scattered ashes. The urns are of an earlier type than those at Szilágynagyfalu: they have an 8th century, Slavic-Avar shape and style of decoration. The late 8th century dating is confirmed by a splendid set of silver(?) Avar belt ornaments from tumulus I; the iron-hooped wooden bucket found in that grave also dates from the Avar period. Some time back, vandals despoiled a similar tumulus, with a vault made of wood, that was located at Apahida; other sites in that district, in the Kolozsvár-(Monostor-)Pap valley and at Nagyiklód, have been identified as belonging to this culture and period.
The dating of the Szilágynagyfalu-Szamosfalva group is quite clear. Its beginnings lie in the Avar period, no earlier than the second third of the 8th century. The pots found at Szamosfalva are of the same age as some of the urns in an older group of Slavic urn {1-261.} cemeteries at Tordas, Mezőszopor, and Vizakna. The Avar rulers acknowledged the leader of the people responsible for the Szamosfalva mounds as equal in rank to distinguished chiefs of Avar clans. The silver-studded belt symbolizes the Slav chieftain's freedom, dignity, and 'Avarness'. The collapse of Avar power probably caused only minor disturbance in the lives of the mound people. It may well have led to the plunder of Szamosfalva's kurgan II (which ultimately yielded 8th century tiles), and of the odd mound at Szilágynagyfalu as well. There is no sign of interruption in the group's development at the beginning of the 9th century. The pots of Szilágynagyfalu, with their distinctive shape and decoration, are mere 'visitors' in Transylvania's other regions, just as the late Medgyes-type urn pots are 'visitors' in Szilágynagyfalu. Moreover, not a single example of the Maroskarna 'A'-type of Bulgar ceramics seems to have reached the Szilágy region.
The 19th-century excavations had already made clear that in light of the cremation rites, these mounds were linked to Eastern Slavs. The question remains, where did these Slavs come from, and when did they settle in the region? The answer lies not only in the funeral rite (which, as noted, was rather varied) but in the finds yielded by the mound group.
The practice of burial under kurgans became widespread among Western and Eastern Slavs, but only later, at the beginning of the 9th century. In contrast, some Eastern Slav tribes (notably the Krivičes, Poljans, and Dulebs) began to follow this practice as early as the 6th–7th centuries, although their rites — except in the case of the kurgans at Borševo, on the Dnieper — differed from those in Transylvania. Even in Transylvania, there is no assurance that this group used kurgans to the exclusion of all other forms of burial. For instance, there is no assurance that the fine, Szilágynagyfalu-type urn (containing an iron knife among the ashes) found at Iriny came from a mound.
{1-262.} The Slav cremation tumuli that are closest in age — 8th–9th century — and proximity were found in Laborca-Latorca-Bodrog (Királyhelmec) region. However, the grave finds there are far more modest than those in Transylvania: the only Avar belt ornament found was a single cast-metal tip from a small strap. Such is also the case with the cremation kurgans found in the region the Prut and the Dniester rivers, and which can probably be grouped together with the mounds in eastern Slovakia. The decorative technique of the Szilágynagyfalu pottery (which shows considerable local development) points to the same conclusion: in all likelihood, this Slavic group, which buried its cremated dead under mounds, crossed the northeastern Carpathians and settled in the Szilágy and Szamos regions around the middle of the 8th century — at roughly the same time as another Slavic group, one that also left a legacy of mounds, settled in the Bodrog region. Conclusive archaeological evidence is furnished by the finds at Mojgrád, which are of Eastern Slav origin. The tumuli at Mojgrád have yielded four different, cast-bronze earrings, each of distinctive half-moon shape and decorated with stars; one at least clearly came from a grave, for it was found together with blue glass beads and fragments of Szilágynagyfalu-type dishes. Similar jewels have surfaced at Karcsa (in the Bodrog region) and in a tumulus at Királyhelmec, and further finds, at Kassa-Zsebes and Felsőremete, point in the direction of Galicia and Ukraine. The Eastern Slavic group that settled in the Szamos valley probably did so as allies, rather than as subjects, of the Avars. Their material culture, the chiefs' apparel, and even their funeral rites (horse burials) show clear signs of Avar influence.
One of the few settlements of mound Slavs in the Tisza-Szamos region was uncovered at Karcsa, in the Bodrog region. A similar site was discovered in 1979 on the Lázári-Lubi field at Szatmár. On this site, a hut, equipped with a fireplace, yielded tiles made on a wheel, hand-fashioned baking pans, a bronze ear pendant, {1-263.} with star

shaped decoration, of the same type as those found at Karcsa (and Mojgrád), and, perhaps most importantly, the first material proof of Slav agriculture in the Carpathian Basin: the small, iron sole of a plough.
During the 9th century, those among this group of Slavs who lived east of the Meszes drew back to the western side of the mountains — presumably to avoid the Bulgars' advance into the Carpathian Basin. A surprisingly large number of mound cemeteries have been found in the Szilágy region, and a fair proportion of them can be linked to this particular group. One noteworthy example is Érkávás, which, though far from the Avar settlement area, lies at the very heart of this Slavic group's territory: the site yielded several cast-metal belt ornaments decorated in a griffin pattern. So far, only a few archaeological finds (such as the 9th–10 century vessels yielded by kurgans 1011 at Szilágynagyfalu) point clearly to the continued presence of Eastern Slavs at the time of the Hungarian Settlement. Yet the many Slavic toponyms in the Szilágy region, around the Kraszna and Berettyó valleys, are just as indicative of the group's survival as the arrowhead of a Hungarian conqueror that was found in one of the tumuli at Királyhelmec.

The Avar Occupation of Transylvania
In the context of the period of Great Migrations, the archaeological finds relating to the earliest Avar dwellings and military outposts are truly of exceptional quality. A burial rite, dating from the 6th–7th centuries, of the Avars and early Turks was discovered in Central Asia (in the former Tuva ASSR and Mongolia) some thirty years ago. The mounted warriors and armed clan chiefs had been buried fully dressed and armed, and generally at some distance from the graves of other members of their family and clan. Shortly after the funeral, their horses were sacrificed near the grave for a funeral feast; the remains of the feast were then burned on a pyre, and the residue, along with the harnessed hide of the horse, was buried in a shallow grave. This custom was still present among the first generation of the Avars who invaded the Carpathian Basin, and then, for reasons unknown, it apparently died out after 600. {1-226.} Another important indication of the Asian connection is that the stirrups — rectangular or looped shape, with a round footrest for soft-soled boots — and pony bridles discovered in early Avar firepits in the Carpathian Basin matched those found in Central Asia. The earliest Avar iron stirrups (which were also the first in Europe!) were brought by these people from their former homeland — a fact proven not only by the perfectly matching shapes, but also by the material, which contained nickel, a metal unknown in the Carpathian Basin. Traces of funeral pyres, including iron stirrups marked by fire, have been found in some 35–40 locations, all the way from the Dévény Gate to the banks of the Küküllő River; there can be little doubt that they indicate the initial pattern of Avar settlement. Their easternmost outpost was situated in a gorge leading out of the Barcaság (Barzenland) region. Gold coins of the Persian King Chosrau I (531–579), found in the Brassó (Kronstadt) district, could have been brought there only by the Avars.
Given what is known about the historic events of 567–68, it seems logical that the Maros and Küküllő valleys should have been among the first areas to be occupied and settled by the Avars. This settlement's farthest point along the Kis-Küküllő River, at Dicsőszentmárton, is indicated by a pair of stirrups marked by fire.
A typical early Avar pot, hand-made and with a narrow neck, was discovered in a grave at a nearby village, Küküllővár. A pair of elongated stirrups, twisted by the heat of a funeral pyre, was found at NémetszentpéterGóliát, on the Maros River south of Arad, along with a bridle bearing fire marks and an armour-piercing pike of the type that Avars used to kill the sacrificial horse and then bury with the remains of the feast; these objects are the unmistakable signs of Avar presence. It appears, then, that Gepidia's two principal arteries, the Maros and Tisza valleys, came under Avar rule at the very beginning of the period. That the road along the Olt and Sebes rivers continued to serve as the link with the eastern regions of the Avar domain is indicated by coins found near Nagyszeben {1-227.} and Sebes: a gold solidus and a bronze coin from the age of Iustinus II (with markings that indicate they were minted around 570); a Mauricius solidus (a pierced jewel) found in the former county of MarosTorda; and a Mauricius (582–602) solidus obulus found between Kőhalom and Olthévíz. Most of the Byzantine coins — in fact, all of the authenticated ones — that can be linked to the early Avar empire were found in graves, and this is probably the provenance of the above-noted coins as well.
If relatively few traces have surfaced of the sparse occupation of the Transylvanian Basin by the early Avars, this is not simply a reflection of insufficient archaeological research. The process that started in the 3rd–4th centuries, and then slowed down in the 6th century, during the period of Gepid rule, reached its final phase in the first sixty years of Avar domination: Dacia became Erdőelve, Silvania, then Transsilvania. In terms of human settlement, this was the low point, compared to which the situation in the 8th and 9th centuries already foreshadowed a process of development that would mature in the Middle Ages.

{1-144.} The Onetime Inhabitants of Transylvania
There is no written record beyond 270 of the population of the province of Dacia. Without exception, the names of onetime Roman towns, settlements, and fortresses fell into oblivion; not one language or early medieval written record handed them down to the Middle Ages. What remained was a prehistoric heritage of unknown linguistic origin: the names of several great rivers — Temes, Maros, Körös, Szamos, Olt. The river names Ampelus/Ompoly and Tierna/Cserna also date from the pre-Roman period.
As far as is known, the regular circulation of currency — indicative of soldiers' pay — ended in the fortified border camps of northern, northeastern and eastern Dacia with the coins of Philippus Arabs or Decius, and, in the castellum of Micia (Vecel), which guarded the province's western approaches along the Maros River, with the coins of Valerianus (260). The Dacian coins engraved PROV[INCIA] DACIA were minted from 246 to 257 and served to pay soldiers during this period. As late as 268, more than a few people in the province's interior buried their coins in the hope that peaceful times would return; this is attested by the hoards discovered at Apulum in 1902 and 1963, and at Galacs in Krassó-Severin. Their miscalculation may well have cost them their lives.
So far, there has been little systematic excavation of the burial grounds at Roman castella in Transylvania, and thus the date of the last burials is not known. What is evident is that the Goths found no use for these border fortifications, most of which lack any sign of Gothic presence. There are, in the province's interior, 3rd century Roman or Romano-Dacian burial grounds with traces of ritual cremation, but the unearthed objects all date from before 270. The most recent urn grave, uncovered at Radnót, contained a Severina Augusta coin and could not have been dug much later than 269–71.
{1-145.} Among urban cemeteries, the sections that have been unearthed so far at Potaissa (Torda) extend in time to the reign of Gordianus III; by the 5th century, eastern Barbarians were burying their dead on the site of the destroyed principia (headquarters) of the legio-castrum. In the cemeteries of Napoca (Kolozsvár, Petőfi Street, etc.), numerous 'late-Roman' sarcophagi of eastern, Hellenistic origin, grave pits lined with stone slabs, and coffins made of 'tegula' (roof-bricks) — the last with no grave furniture — date back to the 3rd century; some of these may date from after 270. The most important site is at Apulum (Gyulafehérvár), where graves of earth, brick, and stone, found in three separate cemeteries, bear the mark of the 'imperial' burial customs prevalent in the 2nd and 3rd centuries; these graves date from before the 270s. Under the Tetrarchy, a new 'burial culture' emerged and became common from Scythia Minor (Dobrudja) to Britain, along the Rhine and the Danubian limes. Its distinctive features were the setting of graves on an east-west axis; official emblems (cruciform fibulae with bulb-shaped ends, belts), worn by men, that signified various compulsory functions; and women's jewellery that reflected typically 'provincial' affluence. There is no trace of this culture in Transylvania or elsewhere on the 'barbarian' side of the Danube.
The cruciform fibula with bulb-shaped ends was prescribed and awarded as a badge by the late-Roman state to its own subjects. The only 'classic' bulb-shaped fibula, dating {1-146.} from the 4th century, that was discovered in a certified excavation in Transylvania came to light at Obrázsa, on the banks of the Székás, a small tributary of the Küküllő River; a coin minted under Crispus puts the date of that village site to some time after 317. In that period, some of these fibulae came into the possession of neighbouring barbarians, as testified by finds in the graves and sites of Gepids, Sarmatians, Vandals, and Quads. There is little doubt that these fibulae were obtained as booty, and the find at Obrázsa is probably of the same provenance, for in the village's Roman-period graveyard, dating from the 2nd–3rd century, there are no late-Roman graves dating from the 4th century (that is, from the period of the Tetrarchy).
Apulum is the only Transylvanian town where a few finds — women's ornaments and one or two coins (Constantine the Great and Constantinopolis) — are of late-Roman character. They came to light, allegedly in graves, in the course of excavations on the site of the legate's palace. Since the ornaments — and the way they



The Onetime Inhabitants of Transylvania

were worn, with several bracelets on one arm — are characteristic of the Roman provinces, it can be surmised that the graves held the remains of women carried off by the Goths.
The sole village graveyard that was still in use in the 4th century — a unique quality confirmed in the process of analysis — is the 1st burial site at Baráthely. The graves, containing cremated remains, are undoubtedly of the Roman provincial type; in Pannonia, the most recent graves of this type, judging by Probus' coins (276–282), date from the late 290s. The chronology of the close to 350 graves in the cemetery is difficult to establish. Most of them were dug on a north-south axis, but they occasionally overlap, indicating that the burial ground dates back to the period of Roman rule. Later arrivals who practised cremation and laid out their dead on an east-west axis made free use of this old burial ground. If the three identifiable coins found on the site actually came from graves, they indicate that the earlier burial ground fell into disuse in ca. 353 (coin minted under Constantius II), while the more recent was in use from after 338 (Caesar Constantius II) and to the time of Valens' coinage in 373. The people who used the burial ground were extremely poor; the only objects found in the graves were a few iron and bronze fibulae. The remains of houses and trenches within the burial ground yielded objects associated with the Goths: combs made of bone, with a rounded back, clasps, fibulae, as well as agricultural implements that had been hidden: iron plates for spades, sickles, and carriage fittings. Most of the pottery discovered in the graves (?), in the houses (?), and on the surface (?) is a product {1-147.} of the Gothic Marosszentanna culture; the rest consists of 4th-century provincial products from the southern bank of the Danube, examples of which turn up on almost all the sites and burial grounds of the Marosszentanna-Cherniakhov culture. There are no appreciable finds that reflect the indigenous population's material civilization in the 4th century. If the people who used this burial ground were still present in the second half of the 4th century, they must have constituted a closed and isolated village community that clung to its pagan traditions; this is indicated by the practice of cremation, the large number of animal bones, and the remnants of sacrificial meat in the graves.
Two centuries' worth of archaeological research in Transylvania has failed to produce conclusive evidence that a significant part of Dacia's 'Roman' population survived Roman evacuation. The finds in Dacia that originated with natives or colonists and evoke imperial Rome can be dated between 107 and 270, and obviously they also date the sites and the burial grounds where they turned up. So far, no authenticated trace has been found in Transylvania of the 'late-Roman' culture that emerged in the Tetrarchy period, and thus of the survival of isolated local communities. To be sure, a few urban burial grounds continued to be used for a time after the evacuation of the province, and it is likely that prisoners captured by the Barbarians lived in some of the ruined towns, but this flickering flame is but a reflection of Gothic domination. The only trace of the continuing presence — for an indeterminate time — of elements of the pre-270 population was found at Baráthely, on the south bank of the Nagy-Küküllő River, and it presents a rather forlorn picture: the people who buried their dead there after 270 were exploited and, in material terms, reduced to slavery by the Goths. In Dacia's Gothic period, their village disappeared and their burial ground fell into disuse.

Gothic Settlements and Cemeteries in Transylvania
The fragment of a burial site discovered along the former Mikszáth Kálmán Street in Marosvásárhely bears archaeological importance because it allowed archaeologists for the first time to distinguish within one cemetery 4th century Gothic finds and 6th-century Gepidic finds. Most of the graves are contemporary with the middle period (first half of the 4th century) of the burial site of Marosszentanna; a set of six vessels was found only in one grave, while the rest contained one or two. The analysis of the graves is complicated by the fact that they were despoiled by Gepids(?), who subsequently also used the site for burials. A tomb made of bricks indicates local(?) Roman cultural influences. More recently, similar graveyards of varying size have been discovered at Újős-Rét (16 graves, including one of a woman wearing fibulae with a half-moon shaped end); Mező(Szász)erked (15 graves); Medgyes (9 graves on either east-west or north-south axes, and therefore belonging to different periods); Mezőakna-Faluvég (3 graves, including one, that of a wealthy woman, that held a fibula with a half-moon shaped plate, diverse Gothic vessels, and a Roman jug of Moesian origin with a pinched spout).
Objects that evoke the Marosszentanna culture — fibulae distinguished by the downward curve of the pin, bone combs with rounded backs, oval bronze and iron buckles, distinctive beads, plates and pots — have been discovered in graveyards at Kolozsvár (December 30 Street), Erdőszentgyörgy, Csombord, MezőaknaFarkasvölgy, Vermes, Marosújvár, Betlenszentmiklós, and (Magyar)szovát. Various typical ornaments belonging to women are found in other Germanic graves from the Gothic period: silver {1-154.} or bronze fibulae with halfmoon shaped plates, worn in pairs (at Kolozsvár [1870], around Marosvásárhely, between Baráthely and Ecel, and at Vajdakamarás, where the finds included a bronze clasp and earrings); ordinary fibulae from the 4th century (Apahida, Nagyernye, Szászsebes); an ornamented bone comb (Medgyes); beads and a comb with rounded back (Vajdaszentivány); and intact vessels and combs (Sövényfalva, Kissolymos, Bátos, Szászsebes). A superb set of late-Roman ornamental military belts (from the second half or the end of the 4th century), unique in the Gothic world, was discovered on the banks of the Szamos at Szamosújvár (Németi); presumably it came as booty, or was a rare souvenir brought back by a Germanic mercenary discharged from the Roman army. At the heart of the Transylvanian Basin, in the 'central' settlement area of the Goths, archaeological finds — mainly fragments of pottery, identifiable by period, and bone combs with a rounded back — testify to Gothic settlements (Marosszentanna- Cherniakhov) at Cege, Csákó, Bálványosváralja, Mezőerked, Dedrádszéplak, SzászfenesTarisznyapart, Vajdaszentivány (where graves were found as well), the castle at Marosvásárhely, Marosnagylak, Gernyeszeg, and Vermes. The westernmost site of the Marosszentanna type in the Maros valley, at Déva, indicates the approximate boundary of Gothic settlement. As early as 1911, a settlement was partially excavated at Kolozsmonostor — István Kovács dug up a pottery kiln — but its dating is problematical, partly because Germanic people settled there in later times as well.
In the Gyergyó Basin, near the headwaters of the Maros River, the only relevant find is of a thinly-populated settlement of the Marosszentanna type, on the grounds of the Lázár castle at Gyergyószárhegy; however, an important Gothic silver hoard (to be assessed more fully below) was found not too far away, at GyergyóTekerőpatak.
There must have been significant Gothic settlements in the valley of the Küküllő rivers, west of the Gyergyó and Hargita mountains. Huts, partly sunken, and equipped with stone fireplaces, have {1-155.} been discovered at BözödLóc, in the Kis-Küküllő valley. They yielded ornamented bone combs with rounded backs, spindle whorls, plates, pots, and Roman amphoras; it appears that the residents had left in a hurry. This settlement is contemporary with that at Székelyszállás. Huts similar to those at Bözöd were uncovered in the valley of the Nagy-Küküllő at Segesvár-Szőlők (where the finds included bone combs, buckles, and vessels), not far from site of graves, holding skeletons, at Fehéregyháza; at Kisekemező; and at Székelykeresztúr-Lok. Traces of dwellings and settlements were also found at Székelyudvarhely (Szabadság Square) and at Kisgalambfalva-Galath-tető. At Rugonfalva, in the valley of the Nyikó, two elaborate graves were found, indicating the proximity of a Gothic homestead or village. Oriented on a north-south axis, these graves were originally covered with stone slabs, but they were subsequently

despoiled; they yielded bone combs with rounded backs, numerous vessels, spindle whorls, fibulae, and beads. Their former richness is reflected in what the grave robbers left behind: fragments of late-Roman glasses and a metallic mirror. Another Gothic site along the Nagy-Küküllő, at Bögöz-Vízlok, yielded a pottery kiln and fragments of fine, smooth pottery with channelled decoration; huts dating from the Marosszentanna culture have also been found at Baráthely (site 1) and at Siménfalva, in the Nyikó valley.
The Háromszék Basin and the Barcaság/Burzenland comprise the third, and perhaps the richest and most important area of settlement of the Tervingi Goths in Transylvania. The largest Visigothic site to date was unearthed at Sepsiszentgyörgy-Eprestető; it includes semi-sunken dwellings that measure 2.5 by 3 metres at the base, as well as a pottery kiln. The houses and kiln yielded not only the usual pottery and bone combs with rounded backs of the Marosszentanna type, but also rich late-Roman imports: an ornamental, amphora-like vessel resembling an amphora as well as pinched-spout Moesian jugs and their replicas. The settlement's burial ground was also discovered: among the burial objects found {1-156.} in the east-west oriented graves were fibulae with halfmoon plates. A cremation grave remains from an earlier period. A dwelling from the same period was discovered at Réty-Telek, along with a grave holding a skeleton; the house had a fireplace and contained a bone comb with curved back as well as coins minted in 345, under Constantine II. The sixteen skeletons unearthed more recently at Réty are probably connected with the settlement. Houses of the Marosszentanna culture, found at Gidófalva and Brassó, have yielded bone combs with rounded backs as well as other objects. Traces of Gothic settlements have been found westward along the Olt valley, at Alsókomána and as far as Sárkány; the 4th-century Roman cruciform fibula with bulb-shaped end found at Halmágy may indicate a settlement there as well.
A semi-sunken floor dwelling was discovered at Szászhermány-Pénzesgödör. At its narrower ends, the roof was supported by pairs of posts. This site yielded ornamented fibulae with half-moon shaped plates and bone pendants, as well as bone combs with curved backs, ordinary fibulae, and fragments of vessels; since such objects were normally found in graves, their presence confirmed the organic links between settlements and burial sites. At Felsőcsernáton, traces of a settlement were found by the Kereszt, and 4th-century graves with skeletons in the Mihács park. The six intact vessels — including a splendid earthenware jug with channelled decoration that resembles a Roman bronze jug — discovered near Kézdivásárhely probably came from graves. Other finds in the settlement zone of southeastern Transylvania include vessels at Dálnok-Kisvölgy, Kézdiszentlélek, and Hévízugra, and turned plates of the Marosszentanna type at Sepsiszentgyörgy-Bedeháza and Köpec.
One of the few settlements of the Marosszentanna culture that were located on the site of an abandoned or destroyed Roman castellum is found at Komolló. The finest Visigothic vessel known, an ornamented plate, was found near the castellum of Bereck, {1-157.} which once defended the Ojtoz Pass; plates of a similar type have been unearthed near Kiev, the area of this culture's Cherniakhov branch.
Outside Transylvania, the largest number — around 30 — of Gothic burial sites are found in Muntenia, where over half of them lie within a 20–30 kilometre-wide strip of land on the left bank of the Danube. It is evident that some of the Gothic settlements were purposely located close to river crossing-points and Roman trading posts.

TRANSYLVANIA The Burial Site at Marosszentanna
{1-148.} The Visigoths and the Marosszentanna Culture
The Gothic burial site of Marosszentanna is of crucial significance in the archaeology of the period of Great Migrations. It was the first burial ground to be discovered that was identified with a people who played an important role in late-Roman and early medieval history, and the first to benefit from fully professional assessment in archaeological publications (1903–1912). It is not surprising, then, that for some fifty years, Marosszentanna/Maros-Szentanna/Maros-Szent-Anna was synonymous with Gothic culture in the eyes of archaeologists and historians who studied the Visigoths.
It is difficult to trace the advance of the Tervingi Goths into Transylvania, for their burial grounds and dwellings indicate their settlements, not the path of their conquest. In light of the wars that prevailed initially, one can scarcely expect to find significant archaeological traces of permanent settlement dating from before the last decade of the 3rd century. Contemporary Roman coins are seldom found in Gothic graves of the 3rd and 4th centuries (an absence that is linked to the Goths' religious beliefs and not to their economic conditions), and thus it is difficult to date these graves. On the basis of their vast Moldavian burial grounds and the early burial grounds in Muntenia, it can be established that at the time of the conquest their religious beliefs underwent a certain change under the influence of 'Mediterranean' ideas. This influence probably resulted from interaction with their subjects, the ancient rural and urban population on the northern coast of the Black Sea, and with the thousands of captives that they had brought back from the empire. At the beginning of the 3rd century, the Goths were still cremating their dead, but by the second half of the century the practice of entombment was increasingly common. The practice of cremation, which, at the time of the conquest, accounted for at least half of burials, declined steadily during the 4th century, and in some {1-149.} places it disappeared. At the same time, the Goths began to adopt the custom of burial on an east-west axis, which in the circumstances reflected a Christian influence.
The material culture observable in all the burial grounds and settlements shows greater uniformity than the funeral rites. The original Gothic heritage survived in elements of costume (the combs and fibulae worn by women, the buckled belt, with purse attached, worn by men) and some forms of pottery. Some elements of their material culture (fibulae, beads) had been modified under the influence of the Pontic Greco-Sarmatian culture; after they had settled in Gutthiuda, their material culture was moulded by Roman merchandise and influences originating from south of the Danube. For instance, a common type of Visigothic pottery replicates contemporary Roman earthenware from the Danubian provinces. Visigothic graves — especially those in Muntenia — were found replete with glasses and glassware cups, jugs, and glazed or unglazed amphoras originating in the Lower Danubian provinces. The 'masterpieces' of Visigothic pottery are mostly clay copies of Roman bronze and glassware jugs or drinking vessels, and the bone combs with half-moon shaped or rounded backs so typical of Visigothic women's costume are mere replicas of the combs fashionable with the Romans in the 3rd and 4th centuries. Roman influence manifests itself in the ongoing adoption of the empire's late-antique provincial culture. The incidence of Roman products in burial grounds and settlements wanes as one progresses from the lower Danube toward the Carpathians. In Transylvania, most of these imports were found at the north end of the major mountain passes, in the Háromszék Basin, while in the interior of the former Dacia they are exceedingly scarce.
Gothic settlement was concentrated in two regions of Transylvania. The largest, or at any rate the better-known, lay at the center of the erstwhile province of Dacia, within the former limes; it covered an area with a radius of about fifty kilometres, between {1-150.} the Kis-Szamos River, the middle reaches of the Maros valley, and the branches of the Küküllő rivers. It might be expected that the earliest cremation graves would be found here, among the urn graves of Maroslaka/Péterlaka-Csortos, Maroscsapó, Marosgezse, Sóvárad, Maroslekence, Medgyes, and Sepsiszentgyörgy-Eprestető. In fact, such is not the case; the sole possible exception is Maroslaka. At Maroscsapó, for instance, coins minted under Constantius I and Constantius II date the urn graves at the first half of the 4th century. The silver fibula with a half-moon shaped end, found in a cremation grave at Maroslekence, is a typical Gothic ornament that seldom occurs before the middle third of the 4th century. The 'urn' in that 4th century Gothic grave, a pot of the Mithras cult with handles bearing serpentine decoration, was made in the 2nd or 3rd century,

and thus it must have been a 'found' vessel; Roman vessels, bronze objects, and fibulae, dating from the 2nd to 4th centuries, were similarly recycled and found in Langobard and Avar graves of the 6th–7th century in Pannonia. At Sóvárad, 4th-century cremation graves of the {1-151.} Marosszentanna type were found inserted amidst the ruins of a Roman castellum. Only a few Gothic cremation graves have been unearthed so far in Transylvania, but this does not prove that no others existed. At Marosszentanna, for instance, the burial site had suffered so much from erosion that the urn graves must have been destroyed by the time of the excavation. Their earlier presence is attested by the burned bronze ornaments found with the displaced 56th skeleton.
The burial site at Magyarpalatka is as significant as the graves at Sóvárad with regard to the links between the Goths and former Dacia. The deep Gothic graves in the field at (Magyar-)Palatka-Tag were dug by cutting through the very foundation walls of a ruined Roman building (a former villa rustica). The rich grave objects (silver fibulae with half-moon shaped ends, Gothic and 4th-century Roman vessels, combs with curved backs) and the funeral rite are consistent with the second period of the burial site at Marosszentanna. One find, a large bronze pendant with hammered ornamentation, is considered unique in the Gothic area; significantly, a similar, Roman pendant, dating from the 4th century, was unearthed in the 1723rd grave at Intercisa. In these circumstances, the pendant can hardly be attributed to the craftsmanship of 'Roman Christians' in Dacia.

4. TRANSYLVANIAN CULTURE IN THE MIDDLE AGES
4. TRANSYLVANIAN CULTURE IN THE MIDDLE
AGES The Cultural Role of the Catholic Clergy
Between Two Worlds
Europe's Christian culture of the Middle Ages had two fountainheads, Rome and Byzantium, and the formal schism in 1054 made their divergence irrevocable. In Hungary, the Roman and Greek churches had always coexisted. The former predominated and occasionally made vigorous attempts to proselytize, but the latter survived and even increased its flock. Its growth was facilitated by the ongoing process of immigration from the northeast and southeast, and by the official settlement policy, which dictated an expedient and reluctant religious tolerance.
Transylvania lay at the meeting point — and thus at the periphery — of the two Christian worlds. Ethnic Hungarians and Germans adhered to the Roman rite, Romanians and Ruthenians to the Byzantine. These Christian cultures were superimposed over at least four pre-Christian belief systems, vestiges of which remain present in contemporary folklore. One must say at least four, because the pre-Christian traditions of Transylvania's peoples came from multiple sources: Finno-Ugrian and Turkic elements in the case of the Hungarians, ancient Balkanic, Roman, and Slavic elements in the case of the Romanians, Celtic, Roman, and Teutonic in the case of the Germans, and probably several, untraceable elements in the case of Transylvania's Slavs, whose cultural identity had become submerged by the end of the Middle Ages.
The peripheral situation is significant, for due to the distance from their respective centres, the two cultures were subject to each {1-525.} other's influence and evolved in a distinctive fashion. Western cultural influences extended to Transylvania's eastern limits, and were carried even farther, into Wallachia and Moldavia, by Hungarian and Saxon settlers. The Orthodox Church spread as far as the western mountains of Transylvania and no further than the upper reaches of the rivers that watered the Hungarian Plain. As the multi-ethnic population of Transylvania became progressively integrated thanks to the spread of an agrarian economy, the two religious cultures became similarly intertwined. Long before the Reformation, villages in which the two faiths each had their own church could be found throughout the country. People of different faiths lived and worshipped in close proximity to each other, and came to share some of their distinctive traditional and religious values; the outcome was a composite popular culture unique to Transylvania.
In the field of East European folklore, a common research objective has been the original belief-system and distinctive cultural features of specific ethnic groups. In the case of Transylvania's Hungarians (including the Székelys), Romanians, and Saxons, such attempts are bound to fail, for the magical myths and rites in their folklore long antedate the emergence of modern ethnicity and only differ outwardly. Spells that bind or liberate, heal or harm, fertilize or lay waste are part of the folklore of all Transylvanian — and, indeed, Eurasian peoples. The differences are superficial, lying mainly in the language and gestures employed to conjure up the magic powers and figures. Thus the Hungarian word boszorkány (of Turkic origin), the Romanian vrăjitoară (of Slavic origin), and the Saxon Häch (from the German Hexe) all denote the same imaginary figure, a witch; the image of a dragon is evoked by the Hungarian sárkány (of Turkic origin), the Romanian balaur (of ancient Balkanic origin), and the Saxon-German Drache. Rooted in prehistory, such mythical beliefs were embroidered, then shared with other groups, and so far, it has not proven possible to differentiate with any precision the beliefsystems of the three Transylvanian peoples prior to their cohabitation.
{1-526.} Nevertheless, a few cultural threads can be traced back to the distant past, producing a rough outline of each group's distinctive features. Thus the Indo-European world-outlook of Romanians and Saxons can be readily differentiated from the Hungarian (and Székely) heritage of shamanism. According to the latter, ancestors' spirits resided in the tree of life; the shaman conjured them up by climbing up the tree, by chanting in a trance, or by engaging in ritual combat with other shamans who, like him, were disguised as animals. Shamanism considered the nether world to be a mirror-image of reality and prescribed appropriate funeral rites, e.g. girding the sword on the right side of the body. These customs and beliefs can be traced in archaeological finds dating from the Hungarian conquest as well as in surviving folk traditions of the Hungarians (Székelys) in Transylvania and Moldavia. This



Between Two Worlds
https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/87.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:37:30]
ancient heritage was transmitted orally in dirges and heroic ballads, with tunes on the Finno-Ugrian tritonic and tetratonic or the Turkic pentatonic scale, which were only rediscovered and recorded in the 20th century. The oral tradition was once linked to an embryonic literacy, a runic script of Turkic origin which survived mainly among Székelys; sounds unknown in the Turkic tongue were subsequently noted in Glagolitic letters, either by the Székelys, who gave up bilingualism for Hungarian monolingualism, or by the Hungarians in general — if the hypothesis is valid that runic writing belonged to the Hungarians' common cultural heritage. Formed when the Székelys were a pastoral people who kept herds of large animals, their social structure was subsequently adapted to an agro-pastoral, village-based existence. The survival of this archaic society of free peasant-warriors, with its distinctive customary law, was both cause and effect of the Székelys' settlement on the country's periphery. In other respects, the Székelys' value-system and their culture — as revealed in tales, ballads, music, dance, shapes, and colours — constitute simply a regional variant of the popular culture of Hungary.
{1-527.} The homogeneity of Hungarian popular culture is illustrated by the fact that certain ancient beliefs found in Transylvania also appear on the Great Hungarian Plain, e.g. identification of the weasel with a malevolent 'beautiful lady' who hates spinning and could therefore be driven off by the display of a spinning wheel. Bishop Thietmar recorded that his contemporary Sarolt — daughter of Transylvania's gyula and wife of Prince Géza behaved like a man, and did not shrink from slaying people, instead of sticking to her spinning wheel like a good wife and mother. Since the name Sarolt means 'weasel' in Old Turkic, she was obviously one and the same as the beleknegini — 'beautiful lady' — mentioned by Thietmar. Thus Sarolt became a mythical figure in popular lore, giving rise to so many folk tales that in the late 1600s, the Calvinist bishop in the region east of the Tisza, István Diószegi Kis, would include 'tying spinning wheels to weasels' in his list of superstitious customs.
The homogeneity of Hungarian culture in the Middle Ages is best illustrated by popular ballads. The latter incorporated Hungarian and other East European motifs, but they were principally derived from French — or, according to an alternative hypothesis, Greek-Byzantine — roots. Out of the eighty-three Hungarian ballads that have been identified so far as being of medieval origin, sixty-nine were also known in Transylvania; indeed, many of the latter also appeared in Moldavia, and twenty had Romanian variants. Thus Hungarian folk poetry in Transylvania mediated between Hungary's general popular culture and that of the Romanians, transmitting such masterpieces as Kelemen Kőműves' — in the Romanian variant, of Master Manole's — ballad, which was of Balkan-Greek origin.
Romanian popular culture in Transylvania incorporated and preserved a magical world-view that had been nurtured in the successively Hellenic, Roman, and Christian Balkans, and which combined the festive aspects of mysticism and Orthodoxy. The celebration {1-528.} of feast-days with processions, often in costume and mask, and by singing and dancing, was also adopted by the Balkan Slavs. The Hungarian custom of singing 'kolindas' (kolindálás) derives from this source, as do some characteristic features of Romanian tales and narrative poems, the personification of natural forces and celestial bodies and the attribution of speech to animals. In the most beautiful of all Romanian ballads, the 'Miorica', a lamb that is able to communicate with humans warns his shepherd of a deadly peril.
Romanian folklore, like the Hungarian, depicts an ethnic culture that was formed in a given historical period and environment and is remarkably uniform throughout the area of settlement. The Romanian culture's defining figure is the mountain shepherd, and although it also reflects agrarian influences, its customary law (the 'Vlach law', or Oláh jog) — which appeared all along the Carpathians, as far as Moravia — was typical of pastoral societies; the earliest references to this law are found in Serbian royal charters of the 12th century.
The popular culture of the Transylvanian Saxons was generally of an agrarian-peasant nature, but even in the Middle Ages it reflected urban influences. The Saxons shared the Germanic world's superstitious beliefs in a multitude of variegated monsters from marshes and forests, of giants, goblins, imps, and articulate animals. They took over other mythical figures from Romanian folklore, such as a monster, known also to Hungarians, called the prikulics. Transylvania's Saxons, like the Hungarians and Romanians, enjoyed local autonomy under their customary laws, and thus they were able to preserve their ethnic identity and culture. Although the Saxons lived in a comparatively closed society and maintained strong links with the German homeland, they had significant cultural interaction with the Hungarians and Romanians. At the same time, their culture preserved its distinctiveness and did not absorb, for instance, the medieval legends nurtured in Hungarian folk tales or the

moralistic Byzantine stories so characteristic of Romanian folklore.
{1-529.} Despite their differences, the popular cultures of the three groups had common roots in superstition and were more open to each others' influence than the two principal religious cultures. However, it was the latter that played the more decisive role in defining the cultural profile and interaction of Transylvania's peoples. It is therefore essential to assess the impact on Transylvania of the Roman and Byzantine religious cultures.

The Last Century of Avar Rule
https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/46.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:37:41]
The Early Coexistence of Avars and Slavs 4. THE PERIOD OF AVAR RULE 5. THE SLAVS
The Last Century of Avar Rule
In the early 8th century, there emerged a new 'culture' to which archaeologists gave the name 'griffin and tendril', after the motifs of its cast bronze belt ornaments. At the turn of the 20th century, and again in recent decades, archaeologists applied techniques of art history-typology to associate this 'culture' with a distinctive, autonomous society, or, alternatively, a new group of immigrants. Since there was absolutely no evidence of a new wave of immigration, originating in the eastern steppes, after 700, the appearance (more accurately, evolution) of the 'griffin and tendril' civilization was arbitrarily dated back by several decades. However, it is now clear that the sole catalysts of major cultural change in the Avar empire were the Eastern ethnic groups who arrived in the 670s; the material culture — art, clothing, equipment, weapons — of the late Avar period evolved autonomously from these new foundations. This process spanned two generations, and many of the villages and cemeteries that embodied the new culture were founded only after 700.
Few cemeteries remained in continuous use all the way from the first half of the 7th century to the collapse of the Avar empire. Of the cemeteries discovered in Transylvania, only the partially explored one at Tövis may be assigned to this category, on the basis of a cast bronze strap-tip from the late period. The new wave of immigration had a dramatic impact on the pattern of settlement: most of the villages and cemeteries that existed at the end of the 7th century had been either reconstructed, or newly founded in the preceding {1-241.} twenty-five years. Rich and varied grave finds at Aranyosgyéres (where the previously noted burial with horse signalled the transformation) testify to a large, late Avar cemetery. The objects, all typical of the late Avar period, include both the earlier, solid type and later, pierced type of cast strap-tips and buckles with a tendril design; round and pendant belt ornaments with flowery tendril and lion motifs; diverse stirrups with flat footrests: pikeheads and war axes of diverse shape; as well as women's apparel, notably round and oval earrings with bead pendants, melon seed beads, and hair clasps. Some cemeteries, such as the one at Baráthely (no. 2), only came into use in the late Avar period.
On the western periphery of the Transylvanian Basin, around the junction of the Maros and Küküllő rivers, the graves of Avar military chiefs — containing horses and weapons — suddenly appear in the late Avar period, at sites that bear no earlier traces. Graves (with a horse) at Baráthely, Hari, and Muzsnaháza, have yielded stirrups from the late period, as well as bridles with curved sticks, cast strap-ornaments, and spearheads of a late type objects associated with the Avar military class of the 8th century. At Magyarlapád, a grave with horse was unearthed at a spot between the Gorgány River and the castle; the grave-goods — stirrups with footrests that curve upwards, large, round, rose-shaped bridle ornaments (falera), four-arc harness decorations, a spear, and a war axe — date its origins to the last decades of the Avar empire. The grave is the only one of its kind discovered in Transylvania. Other traces of late Avars have been found in the lateral valleys of the Maros valley, areas that were suitable for pasturing and stock-breeding but had been sparsely settled. The traces include the contents of a grave at Lesnyek (Hunyad county) — a cast-bronze strap-tip, gilded in a floral tendril pattern, gilded bronze harness ornaments, and a silver brooch — as well as a belt ornament, with pendants, found at Szentgyörgyválya, in the Strigy-Zsil valley. Judging from these finds, the late Avars lived in an area only half as large as that of the early Avars.
{1-242.} By the 8th century, many of the regions that once enjoyed a central importance in the Avar empire (such as Fejér and Tolna counties) had lost their significance. Thus, in the Temes region, which in earlier times was densely populated, only a few finds testify to the late Avar period: griffin and tendril patterned belt ornaments at Denta and the Temesvár-Módosi bridge (five graves that also yielded horses, sabres with tendril-design belt ornaments, distinctive mask- and pendant-design belt ornaments, and a ceramic vessel, fashioned on the wheel, that dates from the late period); a turned-bone container for needles, indicative of a woman's grave (Perjámos-Sánchalom); and a few grave dishes made on a potter's wheel (Lovrin, Radna). The eastern part of the Great Plain, between the Maros and Fehér-Körös rivers, presents a similar picture: only the cemetery at Székudvar — where a grave (with horse) yielded stirrups and a fine, pierced strap-tip of cast bronze — betrays the presence of late Avars. The date of two Avar graves at Simánd is not known.

Apparently, the Ér valley remained an important Avar district. The two late Avar graves, found in a despoiled state at Székelyhíd-Veres-domb, date back to the turn of the 8th century, for their contents reflect the period of change. The first grave yielded remarkable, Oriental-style cast and pressed belt-ornaments and strap-tips, part of a wooden dish with copper straps, and a stick-shaped braid clip; the second, a distinctive stirrup and a straight sabre. An intact, 8th century grave at Érdengeleg-Újtemető yielded a sabre and a weapon-belt with a tendril-design, cast strap-tip. Sunken-floor dwellings that date from the late Avar period have been discovered at Biharvár; they contained horseshoe-shaped stoves made of stone or clay and fragments of mainly handcrafted vessels.
Concurrently, Szatmár, Szilágy, and the Szatmár districts of Szabolcs-Szatmár county — areas which had been uninhabited for close to 150 years — suddenly gained in importance. A number of finds attest to this change: at Sikárló a cast-bronze strap-tip, decorated {1-243.} in a tendril pattern; at Zilah, a large, silver-plated bronze strap-tip, with a unique decoration depicting a griffin as well as a big-toothed beast of prey falling upon a stag; from a grave (with horse) at Érkávás, a large, cast-bronze strap-tip (bearing, once again, the depiction of a griffin attacking a stag) and harness decorations; from the onetime Szilágy county, and now in a museum, cast buckles and belt ornaments with griffin decoration; and at Doboka, a belt ornament with a 'flat tendril' type, disc-shaped pendant. In the case of some of these sites (such as 'Szilágy county' and Doboka), it cannot be determined whether they are of Avar origin, or whether they are linked to the Slavic population represented by the 'mound' cemeteries at Szilágynagyfalu-Szamosfalva. Ornaments dating from the same period (8th–9th century) and found at Mátészalka and Záhony came from territories inhabited by Slavs.
In the 8th century, the material culture (especially pottery) of Transylvania's Avars and Slavs became so intertwined that the two groups can be distinguished, if at all, by the burial rites revealed in their graveyards. The fact that a Slav settlement may show traces of Avar influence does not prove that Avars had been present; it merely indicates that the Slavs had occasionally adopted the Avars' metal and ceramic products, objects that now identify a specific historical period.
*
The second half of the Avar period, like the first, can only be assessed in terms of changing patterns of settlement. Cemeteries must be excavated, and their size, composition, and stratification studied if one wants to gain insight into the structure of society. The different types of burials — with horse, with horse and weapons, with weapons and decorated belts — can all be found throughout the Avar territory, but the social status that they indicate will vary {1-244.} greatly, for the graves may hold members of the military escort of regional rulers, people from military frontier posts, village or other community leaders, heads of family or chiefs of clan. It is not possible yet to determine which of these social strata predominates in the graveyards discovered so far in Transylvania. The only firm conclusion that can be drawn from the archaeological sites is that at the end of the 8th century, the Avars were still present in the western Transylvanian Basin, around the middle Maros valley and the lower reaches of the Küküllő rivers; thus their area of settlement had become reduced to salt-mining districts of Torda, Marosújvár, and Kisakna. There are also Avar traces, dating from the second half of the 8th century, in southern Transylvania and the Szamos valley. Although these traces might indicate that the Avars had begun to exploit the rich pastures of these more mountainous regions, it is more likely that they were left by Slavic chiefs who had assimilated Avar ways.
The name of the Küküllő rivers is probably a toponymical legacy of the Avars, derived from the Turkish 'kökeleg' (in Hungarian: 'kökényes', in English: 'sloe, blackthorn'). Archaeological finds attest that the valley of the Küküllő rivers was a key area of Avar settlement all the way from 567 to the 9th century, and the centre of Avar power in the 6th–7th centuries; it is also the site of largest late-Avar cemetery, dating from the 8th century, to be discovered in Transylvania (Baráthely cemetery no. 2).

Gepidic Burial Grounds 3. THE KINGDOM OF THE GEPIDS 4. THE PERIOD OF AVAR RULE
Gepidic Society in the 6th Century
Although traces of the Merovingian culture have been found in many settlements and graves in Transylvania, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions. Only a few gold coins — tokens of the alliance {1-214.} with Byzantium indicate the existence of a small class of nobles in the 6th century: a solidus of Iustinus I (518–527), found at Mezőcsávás, and those of Justinian I (527–565) from Nagysomkút, Abafája, Uzdiszentgyörgy, Csáklya, Vecel, Pécska, and the outskirts of Marosvásárhely. These coins were probably funeral oboluses from graves that were despoiled in modern times. The burial grounds were despoiled or ravaged, in some cases repeatedly, at various points in time, and there is insufficient evidence to say when and by whom. One likely period was the 540s, when turmoil and internal opposition must have marked the overthrow of Elemund's dynasty by Thorisind; the pretender, Ostrogotha, and his followers sought refuge with the Langobards. As noted earlier, Mezőbánd was found in a thoroughly plundered state; the first act of despoliation must have taken place around, or soon after 567. The sites at Beszterce, Marosvásárhely, and Marosveresmart fared better only in so far as looters left behind the apparently worthless iron weapons. At Malomfalva, only half of the graves can throw some light on social history.
Despite the devastation, it can be established that Gepids in Transylvania were garbed in a manner similar to their fellows on the Hungarian Plain. Women and girls wore fine-tooth combs in their bun, as well as necklaces of glass beads, although these were slightly more common in Transylvania. Both sexes wore belts fastened with bronze, iron, or — more rarely — silver clasps. On their belt, at the back, men wore a leather purse that contained flint, scissors, tweezers, and a knife. Women used ornamental fibulae of cast bronze (which, in rare cases, was gilded) or, if they were less affluent, iron or bronze pins to fasten their clothes at the front. The iron draw-knife was a distinctive status symbol throughout the area of Merovingian culture, and examples have been found only in the graves of wealthy freewomen. A woman's tool, the clay knob from the spindle, has surfaced on many sites.
{1-215.} In the 6th century, the free warriors of Merovingian culture were buried fully armed, with sword, spear, and iron-bound shield, yet such weapons are found even more rarely in Transylvania than in the Gepidic graves of the Hungarian Plain. Contemporary sources indicate that the Gepids had few 'heavily-armed warriors': in 552, they contributed only 400 such soldiers to Narses' war against Totila, while the Pannonian Langobards sent 3,000.
In Transylvania, sets of swords and spears are scarce, and shield bosses from iron-bound shields even scarcer. It may be surmised, therefore, that the Gepidic military class was small in number, and that the Transylvanian Gepids felt secure. Free warriors equipped with only a spear are more numerous. Some of the sword- and spear-bearing soldiers also had a bow and arrows. The bow alone was the common equipment of 'semi-free' people, who were obliged to serve as archers. Generally speaking, social stratification was more pronounced among the Gepids of Transylvania than among those of the Hungarian Plain, for the remains of armed men, free and semi-free, were found in only 10–15 per cent of the graves. If the despoiled graves of women are also taken into account, it appears that women buried with jewels account for a similar proportion. Seventy per cent of the population was made up of unarmed paupers and domestics, a fact that foreshadows the emergence of the early feudal Gepidic state.
In terms of social rank, the goldsmith who was buried with his tools at Mezőbánd belonged to the nobility; this was the case with Germanic goldsmiths in Barbarian Europe, and indeed with the goldsmiths of the forthcoming, Avar period. Looters had taken his ornaments and weapons, but his iron helmet, which they left behind, indicated that in life as well as in death, he was a man worthy of protection.
In the course of the 6th century, the Gepidic society in Transylvania became a pale reflection of its counterparts in the Hungarian Plain and Sirmia. There are no longer any traces of the {1-216.} 'petty kings' who used to lead them, although, until the end of the century, lesser chieftains may have continued to enjoy a certain autonomy and pretend at independence from the mother country. The sole 'inner' coin treasure found in Gepidia dates from this period — the 50 (or, according to some sources, 80 to 140) gold solidi buried at Kisselyk, which lies across from Mikeszásza in the Nagy-Küküllő valley. The owner's family had been accumulating this fortune ever since the 440s, the era of 'Hun prosperity,' and thus the trove includes gold coins of all the Eastern Roman emperors from

Theodosius II to Iustinus I. The man who concealed the treasure may well have lost his life soon after the reign of Iustinus I (518–527), thus missing the 'new age of prosperity' that began under Justinian I. It may be inferred from the treasure that at some point in the late 520s or early 530s, Elemund put an end to the rule of one of Transylvania's petty kings. This would explain the destruction of some other early nobiliary manor houses and the abandonment of their burial grounds (Kolozsvár-Kardosfalva, Magyarvalkó) and, perhaps, the first wave of looting as well.
Beginning in the 530s, the Transylvanian Gepids were led by a nobility that was neither numerous nor particularly wealthy. The women who wore 'eagle clasps' (Szamosjenő [formerly Kisjenő], Maroscsapó) belonged to this class. In the smaller villages, only one noble family had an estate, and it appears that this family acted as leader of the community of freemen (Malomfalva); few localities bear traces of more numerous armed nobles or of several generations of nobles (Marosveresmart, Baráthely no. 3). The greater number of warriors in some locations (as revealed by graves at Marosvásárhely and Beszterce) may be explained by the borderguard function of the inhabitants.
A chain of villages and farmsteads, most of them populated by semi-free people and servants engaged in farming and stock-breeding, stretched from the middle reaches of the Szamos across the valleys of the Maros and Küküllő rivers to the Háromszék Basin. {1-217.} Little is known about the villagers' way of life, far less than about similar aspects of the Visigothic era. However, it is clear that the Gepids' settlement generated an improvement over the dismal conditions that prevailed in the Hun period. Although the area of habitable and cultivable land shrank even in comparison to the Visigothic age, the Gepids bear no blame. To the contrary, it was thanks to their labour that the Transylvanian Plain as well as the more important valleys and basins remained at all habitable.
*
Driven by 'foreign policy' considerations, the political and military activities of the Gepidic kingdom before 567 were concentrated in the Danube valley, far from Transylvania. At the time of Justinian the Great, the Gepids occasionally gave assistance to Slavic raiders in the Lower Danube region, but momentarily these attacks were not aimed at Transylvania's borders. According to an uncorroborated source, the Gepidic king Kunimund, who had reverted to a pro-Byzantine policy, waged war in ca. 565 against the Slavs of the Lower Danube region. In all probability, Kunimund and his army traversed the Vöröstorony Pass to attack the Slavs in the Olt valley; the latter had been harassing the Gepids' onetime 'Olt limes', and, by then, they had won the support of the Avars. The retaliation against this futile campaign would lead to the collapse of Gepidic power.

{1-664.} The Saxon Towns and the First (Lutheran) Wave of the Reformation in Transylvania
As western Europe entered a phase of development in the 1500s, the urban middle classes emerged as the key agents of change. The future of states, old and new, would be determined in large measure by what happened in the towns.
Compared to the rest of Hungary, Transylvania proper had many towns and quasi-urban settlements, and when the principality's new frontiers were stabilized after the mid-1500s, Nagyvárad, Szatmár, Nagybánya, and the mining settlements of the Máramaros joined the ranks of Saxon towns. To be sure, of Transylvania's 'towns', only Brassó, Szeben, Beszterce, Medgyes, Segesvár, Kolozsvár fully deserved the name, for the rest were modest settlements with no more than one or two thousand inhabitants. (On the periphery of the Great Plain, settlements — controlled by landowners — that were much more populous continued to be regarded as villages and were officially classed as 'market-towns'.)
These changes might have been expected to enhance the political and economic influence of the 'Saxon nation', i.e. the German community in Transylvania. Their right to local autonomy, of only marginal significance in the old Hungarian Kingdom, became one of the founding stones of the new state, for the union of the 'three nations' was an integral part of the legal framework underpinning Transylvania's feudal society.
Although the majority of Saxons were still peasants, the urban minority had risen over time to a position of leadership over the German community. The political and economic affairs of the Saxons came under the authority of the Saxon 'count' (comes), who combined the posts of royal magistrate and mayor of Szeben. The periodic national assembly of Saxons carried less weight than the councils of the larger towns. The royal magistrates of the several districts (seats) came from the urban patrician class. The extension {1-665.} of craft guilds to villages, and the restriction of market rights to the towns relegated the Saxon peasantry to a subordinate position.
Yet this comparatively modern society failed to exploit the opportunities inherent in the reduced size of the state. The process of self-isolation, which had emerged in the late 1400s, became more pronounced in the 1530s, and its effect was anything but beneficial.
The Saxons had sought to protect themselves against competition from Hungarian craftsmen and merchants by prohibiting settlement in their districts and by keeping their contacts within a circle of German-inhabited towns in Hungary and the German Empire. An early corollary of this retrenchment was the development of a certain 'national consciousness'. For a long time, that outlook remained free of political content, but it acquired new significance in the turbulent period leading up the Battle of Mohács. The hatred that Queen Mary bore for the Hungarian 'nation of nobles' owed much to the influence of her German courtiers, notably Markus Pemflinger and Georg Reicherstorffer, who came from Szászföld and played a leading role in civil war of 1527–35. After 1526, and except in the brief period of transition, Transylvania's Germans became steadfast supporters of the Habsburgs; meanwhile, the rest of the population gave its allegiance to the Szapolyai dynasty. The Saxons' defeat in the civil war, along with the bitter lessons of 1552–55, compelled them to come to terms with reality, but their sympathies continued to lie with the Habsburgs.
This faintly irrational attitude was nurtured by the economic and family links between Transylvania's Saxon towns and the German Empire. As Hungary disintegrated, these links gave new impetus to the growing German national consciousness of the Saxons.
In the period before Mohács, Queen Mary's court at Buda served Hungary's Germans as a training ground for political autonomy. At the same time, the court was a centre of humanistic learning. {1-666.} It was there that Reicherstorffer acquired a love of writing, which in a calmer phase of his life led him to produce one of the earliest geographical descriptions of Transylvania. It was also there that German harbingers of the Lutheran reformation notably János Henckel, from Kassa, and Johannes Kresling, who came from Germany — made their first



The Saxon Towns and the First (Lutheran) Wave of the Reformation in Transylvania
https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/108.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:38:03]
influential converts.
Around 1522–23, the first signs of the Reformation in Hungary began to appear in such German-inhabited towns as Sopron, Besztercebánya, and Bártfa. The new ideas reached Transylvania somewhat later, in the early 1530s. The Brassó-born Johannes Honterus pursued studies in Vienna, Cracow, and Basel before he returned in 1532 to Transylvania, imbued with the ideas learned from Luther's supporters in Switzerland. In 1538–39, he opened Transylvania's second printing-shop, in Brassó (the first, in Szeben, dated from 1529), and proceeded to publish his geographic and religious monographs, which became popular readings.
The turbulent period of Hungary's disintegration was propitious for the spread of new ideas. King John, and, later, György Fráter both tried to defend Catholicism, but they soon concluded that it made no sense to alienate the already hostile patricians of Brassó, Szeben, and Beszterce over questions of religion. In 1542–43, Honterus drafted the basic principles of the Saxons' rising Lutheran denomination and its Church. The last Catholic mass in Brassó was celebrated in October 1542. The following year, the diet at Gyulafehérvár dismissed charges of heresy against Brassó's Lutheran preachers. On 22 April 1544, Honterus was chosen as the town's Lutheran pastor, and his first initiatives were to reorganize the local school and establish a library.
The example of the largest town was soon followed in other Saxon settlements. In order to put an end to the initial disputes, the Saxon Universitas, meeting at Szeben on 28 November 1545, ruled that the Lutheran creed must be generally adopted. The Saxons realized that in the tense period following György Fráter's assassination, {1-667.} the Habsburg government was not likely to pick a quarrel with its most loyal supporters; seizing this opportunity, their Lutheran synod, meeting on 6 February 1553, took the step of naming a bishop ('superintendent') and chose Paul Wiener. The transformation was accomplished. Although the years of war that followed brought some organizational problems for the Saxon Lutheran Church, the latter's foundations proved to be solid and enduring.
The civil war and the resulting preoccupation of the government went a long way to explain the ease with which the Reformation conquered the Szászföld, but other factors helped as well. Europe's rapid economic transformation and the emergence of a world market also stood behind the spiritual renewal, and this linkage was present even in Transylvania.
By 1500, the guild crafts had developed considerable strength in the towns of Transylvania. Before Hungary was partitioned, craftsmen had to compete not only with their domestic counterparts in other towns but also with growing imports from Germany, Bohemia, and Silesia. The creation of the principality led to isolation from the earlier domestic competitors and a drop in imports from the west; on the other hand, the counties of the region east of the Tisza (Partium) attached to the principality saw a shift in their commercial links and became more open to Transylvanian products.
In fact, the principality's commercial isolation greatly enhanced the domestic economic influence of its towns. Saxon craftsmen were particularly energetic in exploiting the new opportunities. By the mid-1500s, there were nineteen craft guilds operating in Brassó, and, in the 1570s, the town became home to southeastern Europe's first broadcloth manufacture. Szeben had 28 guilds, representing some 30 different crafts, and at least forty crafts were practised in the towns of the Saxon region.
{1-668.} The towns expanded rapidly, and their appearance improved. At the beginning of the 16th century, Brassó consisted of 50 stone buildings and 1490 wooden ones; in 1550, the corresponding figures were 270 and 760, and, by 1600, there were 580 stone buildings but only 500 wooden houses listed in the town. Beszterce followed a similar pattern: 130 stone buildings and 450 wooden houses around 1500, 180 and 630 in 1550, and 350 stone vs. 450 wooden houses in 1600. Szeben and other towns no doubt underwent the same sweeping transformation, which not only served safety and comfort but also reflected a greater attention to style. In this period of war and economic recovery, the most noteworthy products of Saxon artisanship were those of the goldsmiths.
Amidst these signs of progress, there was little population growth in the major Saxon towns during the 16th century. Brassó counted some 7000 inhabitants in 1500, and 8000–9000 at century's end, when Szeben's population reached 6000 and that of Beszterce, 4000. The population of Segesvár and Medgyes did not exceed 2500.
Thus the cultural and economic revival that emerged in the mid-1500s was rather limited in scope, for the



The Saxon Towns and the First (Lutheran) Wave of the Reformation in Transylvania

comparatively dense network of towns in Transylvania had a sparsely populated and economically backward hinterland. Local artisans soon filled the gap left by the decline in long-distance trade, but the initial recovery could not long conceal the inherent disadvantages of economic isolation. Access to the crucially important markets of Wallachia and Moldavia became increasingly difficult, and there was little scope for boosting trade within Transylvania. The towns were too small to nurture major handicrafts, while the rural economy suffered from a chronic shortage of money.
New difficulties arose when in the latter part of the century, foreigners arrived in quest of commercial opportunities: Greek, Turkish, Serbian, Romanian, and Armenian merchants who had previously crossed Transylvania to reach other markets, but who {1-669.} now sought to sell their cheap consumer goods within the principality. The 'Saxon nation' would regularly raise complaints about these 'newcomers' who bypassed the marketplaces protected by the staple right. In 1585, a law was enacted prohibiting Greek and Italian merchants from taking money out of the country. However, competition from foreigners could not be regulated out of existence, if only because the government realized that imports helped to satisfy consumer needs.
The principality's government acted against the Saxons' economic interests in other ways as well. The feudal estates were badly hit by the shortage of money coupled with inflation, and they reacted, in characteristic fashion, by blaming producers and merchants. Exploiting their political power, they got the diet to pass a series of laws (notably in 1556, 1560, 1571, and 1591) regulating prices. This state intervention seldom produced the desired results, but it did serve to hamper the economic development of the towns.
All in all, the economic revival of the mid-1500s brought little change in the circumstances of the urban middle classes. To be sure, lifestyles came to reflect the Renaissance: homes and the urban environment gained in elegance, and people read more. But the medieval structures of municipal administration, and Saxon rights grew stronger, and craft guilds survived unscathed. (The one attempt to establish a manufacture proved premature and failed before the end of the century.) The patrician-merchant class preserved the predominance it had gained in the 15th century. The leading merchant dynasties (Haller, Rapolt, Armbruster, Offner, and Lulay) continued to control the Saxon Universitas and suppress occasional rebellions, notably one, in 1556, at Szeben, which also had an antiHungarian thrust.
The brief phase of development in the 1530s and 1540s was reflected in the success of Honterus's life-work: the reformation, the foundation of a school at Brassó, his publications on language, astronomy, and geography. But as the economic revival faltered at {1-670.} mid-century, so did the cultural development of Saxon towns. Honterus, Pemflinger, Reicherstorffer had no successors in the spheres of religion, politics, and literature. The printing presses of Brassó and Szeben had less and less business; not a single German- or Latin-language work was published in Szeben between 1530 and 1575. It was emblematic of the Saxons' defensive retrenchment that their most significant achievement in these critical times was the publication of a legal work outlining their rights and privileges. After the royal magistrate of Szeben, Albert Huet ('Albert Süveg'), had secured official confirmation of the Saxons' privileges, Brassó's Mathias Fronius conscientiously collated the material into a comprehensive code. In order to publish the work, in 1583, the printing presses from Brassó and Szeben were brought together, with the result that the two firms once again found themselves on the brink of bankruptcy. Publishing in the Saxon lands began to revive only in the 1590s, when the demand for books became wide-spread.

Gepidic Sites and Settlements 3. THE KINGDOM OF THE GEPIDS Gepidic Society in the 6th Century
Gepidic Burial Grounds
Burial grounds reflect the true extent and significance of Gepidic settlement in Transylvania. The large number and varying size of the settlements and graveyards on the Hungarian Great Plain — the Gepids' 'motherland' — point to a distinction between two types: substantial villages, with large graveyards, and farmsteads or manorial estates that consisted of a few houses and had small burial grounds. Traces of as many as four or five of the latter type have been found on the outskirts of some present-day villages on the Hungarian Plain.
The graves discovered at Érkeserű, Csomaköz, and Székudvar are typical of homestead burial grounds on the eastern Hungarian Plain, while the grave (complete with weapons) on Mogila hill at Óbesenyő is probably that of the master of the manor. At Nagyvárad, on the site of the one-time Guttman brick factory, the scattered and despoiled graves must have belonged to an exceptionally rich manor house; the finds, stretching over a long period of time, include the graves of a man, of several rich women, and of a few poor servants. The manor house dated back to the middle third of the 5th century. The three or four earliest graves yielded a jewelled ornament from a dagger hilt of the Hun era, a gold bracelet with expanded ends, a cloisonné earring with a disc-shaped decoration, a solid silver bracelet, and a jewelled clasp. A woman's grave, dating from the last third of the century, included a metallic mirror {1-210.} with radial ornaments on the reverse, late-antique gold beads, and a fibula whose end had been broken in the funeral ritual — this East German custom died out with the advent of the Merovingian culture. A pair of cast silver fibulae represents the transition from the 5th to the early 6th century, when elegant funerals still prevailed, complete with cloisonné fibulae. A gold pendant, decorated with precious stones and granules, was yielded either by one of these graves or by a grave at Biharudvari (now Sárrétudvari); this crescent-shaped jewel, of the 'Gáva type', links the most recent nobiliary graves of the Upper Tisza region to those, mostly of a later date, at Nagyvárad. The Nagyvárad graveyard also yielded two gold-framed, disc-shaped fibulae; 4th-century Roman silver coins were set in the frames, and a praying figure with raised arms (orans) was scratched on the worn reverse of one of the coins. This is one of the few material traces of Gepidic Christianity. The latest finds at Nagyvárad are jewels from a rich woman's grave that dates from the middle third of the 6th century: a gold fibula, with filigreed decoration (made by soldering thin gold wire) representing a quadruped, another fibula covered with filigree work and precious stones, and the gold brocade hem of a garment's collar. These clothes and jewels were made in Frankish Gaul, and their owner was probably a Frankish noblewoman who had come to this remote land when the Gepids and the Franks formed an alliance in 539.
In the Maros valley, homestead graveyards have been discovered at Marosvásárhely near the county hall, at Maroscsapó, Mezőceked-Hosszúmező, and Felvég; and by the Kis-Szamos at Nagyiklód-Malomhíd (burial site C). The site at Magyarkapus-Kenderáj is more difficult to assess, for the rows of graves indicate the presence of a sizeable burial ground that has yet to be fully uncovered. The twenty graves recently uncovered at Mező(Szász-) erked also appear to belong to a large burial ground, as do those at Marosveresmart-Bethlen-csűröskert and the 43 graves (whose early origin is indicated by an earring with a solid polyhedric button) at {1-211.} Betlenszentmiklós, near the Kis-Küküllő. Nor can the ten graves discovered at Csapószentgyörgy, in the vicinity of the eleven 'houses' noted previously, add up to the entire graveyard of the village; they date from both early (deformed skulls) and late interments (a pair of fibulae with circular punched decoration, a drawing knife, and arrowheads).
The graveyard — only partially uncovered — of the best-known site, at Malomfalva-Hula, is representative of the Merovingian culture in Transylvania. Its use coincided with the lifespan of the nearby village: from the turn of the 6th century (earrings with solid polyhedric buttons) to around 567, when the Gepids ceased to rule over Transylvania. The costumes, rites, and material culture revealed by the graveyard match so closely those of the Tisza region that it might as well have been discovered on the outskirts of Szentes. Only the 'leader' of the local community, a warrior with a sword and shield, was equipped in a 'Transylvanian style'. His shield boss is locally made, possibly by the smith who was buried in the nearby village of Mezőbánd. A bird-shaped fibula, crafted in a Rhenish workshop, is a rarity, for genuine Frankish-Merovingian ornaments seldom came into the Gepids' possession; no other jewel of this type has come to light in Gepidia.



Gepidic Burial Grounds
https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/39.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:38:14]
The social status of the people buried at Malomfalva is as difficult to determine as that of the occupants of most of the Gepidic burial grounds on the Hungarian Plain. Of its 83 graves, 23 had been despoiled and devastated; moreover, 22 others held children, and the Gepids seldom placed significant burial objects into children's graves. What is left does not give a clear picture of the structure and costume of the upper social strata. The provision of food and drink for the afterlife does not appear to have been a general custom at Malomfalva, for only three graves yielded vessels. Most of the similar burial grounds on the Hungarian Plain belonged to Arian Christian communities.
{1-212.} More recently, sections of burial grounds, consisting mainly of despoiled graves, have been discovered in Beszterce-Naszód county (Beszterce-Csiger, Galacfalva-Vermek). On the evidence of a deformed skull, vessels with smoothed and stamped ornaments, and a bronze buckle with a shielded tongue, it has been estimated that the 31 graves date from before 568. The two graveyards yielded a variety of fine ceramics, including pear-shaped vessels; they are decorated in a distinctive, punched style that had been previously found only in the Tisza region. The graves also held spear-heads, arrowheads (three-edged, laurel-leaf shaped, and barbed), and iron wool-shears.
The third burial ground at Baráthely belongs to a different type. Its origins lie in the period of Gepidic rule (a bronze coin of Justinian I was found in grave no. 190), and, as noted earlier, most of the jewels (e.g., a fibula with circular punched ornaments, and Gepidic as well as Byzantine belt buckles), vessels (e.g., a pot with spout, and mugs with smoothed and stamped decoration), and weapons (double-edged swords, spears, and arrowheads) found in the close to 300 graves are typically Gepidic. Nevertheless, the age and character of the graveyard place it in the later, 'Mezőbánd' category.
With its 178 graves, the burial ground at Mezőbánd-Felhágó-dűlő remains the biggest Gepidic find in Transylvania. Since all the graves, except for that of a poor domestic servant, were found despoiled and devastated, it is difficult to date the cemetery. Its origins probably date back to around 550, towards the end of the Gepidic era. In contrast to the graveyard at Malomfalva, over one third of the graves contained vessels, but there were no animal bones to indicate meat dishes. This suggests that the burial ground served a partly pagan, partly Christian community. The larger part of the Marosnagylak site, which holds 125 graves, also belongs to the late, 'Mezőbánd' type of graveyard.
{1-213.} In many places, the existence of a 6th-century Gepidic burial ground is merely suggested by the discovery of one or two graves (Maroscsapó, Somkerék-Hágó, Mezőakna, Apanagyfalu-Csorba-híd [where a fine vessel with stamped decoration was found along with a spear-head], Segesvár-Baierndorf, and Oláhgorbó-Lányfalu). The few graves discovered near Rozsos, between Baráthely and Ecel, are noteworthy for a fine jug with handles, a smoothed cup, and an ornamented fine-tooth bone comb. In other places, graves are merely evoked by finds of what appear to be burial objects, such as intact vessels (at Vasasszentgotthárd, Mezőköbölkút, Gyulatelke, Nagyernye, Erdőszentgyörgy, Nagyenyed, Marosvásárhely, Dés-Szamos-híd [with widely-spaced punched decoration], Dedrádszéplak, Maroskarna, Gyulafehérvár, Beszterce, and Szamosújvár-Szamos-part [typical, fine vessels with stamped and smoothed decoration]) or an intact double-row, fine-tooth comb (Tompaháza). A large ornamental clasp, decorated with an eagle head, has been unearthed at Szamosjenő, and another of the same type at Maroscsapó. These quintessentially Gepidic ornaments were products of Transylvanian goldsmiths, and only distantly related to the 'eagle clasps' crafted at a workshop in the Tisza region. Other finds that may be considered grave objects include oval bronze clasps of the type work by Gepids in the 6th century (Nagyvárad-Szalka terrace, Szilágysomlyó, Torda, Szászkeresztúr, and Kraszna), a double-edged sword (Décsfalva), a spear-head (Bábolna Hill). The arrowheads found at Vingárd, Gyertyános, and — with a quiver — at Csáklya may have come from a grave or, like at Betlenszentmiklós, from a settlement.

The Romanesque Style in Transylvania 4. TRANSYLVANIAN CULTURE IN THE MIDDLE
AGES Romanian Greek-Orthodox Priests and Churches
The Gothic and Renaissance Styles
Although the Romanesque tradition lived on in the architecture of both Hungarians and Saxons in Transylvania until the end of the 13th century, it was soon joined by the Gothic style. The main source of Gothic influence was the church at Kerc. The Cistercian monastery had been founded in 1200, and construction on the church began some time after 1230. The builders followed a traditional Cistercian layout, but they incorporated early Gothic elements modelled on those in and around Paris. The church took the {1-560.} form of a towerless basilica, with a nave, two aisles, and a transept. The basically rectangular chancel was closed off by pentagonal space with a sexpartite, vaulted ceiling; it was lit by sextofoil rosettes higher up, and by lancet windows lower down on the walls. The nave was separated from the chancel by a low arch. The interior of the church, in which nave and aisles were marked off by rectangular columns, was also lit by sextofoil rosettes. The western portal had several orders of slightly pointed arches and was topped by a triangular pediment. The church has since fallen into ruin, and only its chancel remains intact.
The carvers and stonemasons took decades to complete the building of the church at Kerc. The project must have been commissioned by the king, for its builders left their mark on many other constructions located in areas of Transylvania under direct royal authority, and this until 1270. Their earliest similar project was probably the Church of Szent Bertalan (St Bartholomew) at Brassó. The apse of that church (which also has a transept) is a replica of the one at Kerc. Kerc also served as model for a church on the royal estate at Halmágy, outside the Szászföld, although that version had, in a style evocative of Benedictine tradition, two towers on the western facade, much like the church in Brassó. Kerc's layout and chancel were also replicated at the more distant royal domains of Óradna and Bálványosváralja. In the royal salt-mining town of Szék, the church is a smaller-scale, simplified version of the one at Kerc; most of its rosette windows are only trefoil, only the side-walls have lancet windows. The Kerc workshop's last project was Beszterce's Franciscan church, which, in accordance with the tradition of mendicant orders, had a single nave.
The comparable, but far from identical churches raised in the 13th century at Kerc and Gyulafehérvár incorporated a few elements of the emerging Gothic style, chiefly chancels with cross-vaulting and polygonal ends, as well as foliate carvings, lancet arches, and rose windows. In the late 13th and early 14th centuries, {1-561.} these elements began to appear not only in other projects of the Kerc workshop but also as modifications to earlier, Romanesque churches. First to appear, thanks to its ease of application, was foliate decoration. The linkage of a cross-vaulted, polygonal-ended chancel by way of a Gothic arch to a Romanesque nave came later, for it was a more costly alteration. This blending of styles can be found in churches at Borberek, Szászfenes and Magyarlóna (the latter two with a 'conservative', inset tower), as well as in single-nave churches of the nobility (Szovát, Pókakeresztúr, Noszoly, Cegőtelke, Teke) and of the Székelys (Gyulakuta, Nyárádszentlászló, Kövend, Gelence, Bögöz). The polygonal chancel of Kolozsmonostor, with finely-traced windows, might have formed part of an earlier basilica. This type of chancel is also found in the Saxons' basilicas at Medgyes, Segesvár, and Lekence, and in their transeptal churches at Riomfalva, Szászváros, and Ecel. The church at Nagyszeben, the Saxon 'capital', preserved the basic layout of a basilica, but it received, at an early date, a Gothic chancel and transept; in the later 1300s, its nave was modified, with Gothic vaulting, decoration, and windows.
The early Gothic portals of Gyulafehérvár and Kerc, with their orders of pointed arches, multiple columns, and triangular pediments, exerted a lasting influence on church-building. They were replicated in a basilica that had been raised ca. 1330 at Szászrégen, centre of the estates of the Székely count, Tamás Losonci (in other respects, the church followed a conservative pattern, with a nave and two aisles, and a patron's gallery in its inset tower); in the churches at Nagybánya and Abrudbánya, both with Gothic chancels; and in the castle church at Marosvásárhely, which was constructed some time after 1350. Portals that were similar but lacked a triangular pediment were incorporated in the churches at Ótorda, Ecel, Szászbogács (on the southern side), and Höltövény (with rounded instead of pointed arches) in the later 1300s, and at Buzd, Riomfalva, Szászivánfalva, Darlac, Baráthely, and Küküllőkörös {1-562.} in the early 1400s. The Saxons who belatedly settled along the Küküllő River

were particularly disposed to include this early Gothic feature in their new churches.
The triumph of the mature Gothic over Romanesque and early Gothic styles owed much to the mendicant orders, which were popular in Transylvania and favoured a unified space suitable for preaching. They therefore built single-nave churches and, beginning in the later 1400s, triple-aisled hall churches in which aisles and chancel were of the same height as the nave. The latter layout required, in place of cross vaulting, a reticulated vaulting that extended over the entire interior without cramping the Gothic's soaring thrust; far from being oppressive, this ceiling gives an impression of infinite lightness. The mendicant orders established themselves in the towns, where they had a decisive influence on the style of parish churches. The latter represent the finest examples of mature Gothic. As noted, the first dynamic phase of urban development in Transylvania occurred in the mid-1300s, generating the wealth and aesthetic demand that allowed mature Gothic to flourish.
The nave of the church at Nagyszeben is already in mature Gothic style, although the basilican tradition is preserved in the aisles. In other churches, the latter were raised to the same height as the nave. This was the case with the hilltop church at Segesvár, as well as at Szászsebes, whose church is remarkable for the rich sculptures that denote mature Gothic; the Anjou coat-of-arms, statues of kings, and the generally high standard of stonecarving testify to the spirit, if not the actual involvement of the royal court. The outstanding example of mature Gothic architecture in Transylvania is the parish church of Szent Mihály (St Michael), in Kolozsvár. The original design called for a triple-aisled basilica. However, the example of Kassa Cathedral, which reflected the flowering of South German art, came to prevail in the latter third of the 14th century, and Szent Mihály Church was completed in the {1-563.} form of a triple-aisled hall church. Its awesome sense of space is enhanced by splendid vaulting and richly-carved ornamentation; its exterior, which once had a tall spire in the northwest corner, is noteworthy for a harmonious unity. The church was a fitting symbol of Transylvania's economic and spiritual centre, of a place that nurtured the cooperative coexistence of Hungarians and Saxons.
If, in the construction of churches, Kolozsvár followed German models, the inspiration in painting and sculpture generally commissioned for churches — came more from Italy. This was attributable in part to the Anjou kings' close links to that country, and in part to the initiative of Hungarian artists in Kolozsvár, for the latter (unlike those in the Saxon lands) were drawn to a late Gothic-early Renaissance style that was emerging in Florence and Siena; with its dynamism, realism, and greater emotional quality, this new style transcended Byzantine rigidity. Of these artists, only Miklós Kolozsvári is known by name, but art historians have reason to believe that the 'Hungarian' school of painting included at least four others whose works reveal individual characteristics. Creations of this school survive in churches at Magyarfenes, Almakerék, Marosszentanna, and Barcaszentpéter. Some of the frescoes in the first two of these churches are generally attributed to Miklós Kolozsvári. The Madonna at Marosszentanna — with Mongoloid features, and holding an oriental Infant Jesus in Hungarian garb — is the work of another master. The gifted sons of Miklós Kolozsvári, Márton and György, produced a large number of early Renaissance sculptures that compare with any in the rest of Europe; they include the statue of St George in Prague, the royal statues of Várad (destroyed in the 17th century), and the original, now lost, herma of St Ladislas that can be seen in Győr. Art historians once believed that these works displayed direct Italian influence; more recently, they have revised this opinion and consider that Italian influence was but a contributing element in the emergence of a stronger and more self-conscious art form in East-Central Europe.
{1-564.} This flowering of culture, signalled also by the foundation of universities across East-Central Europe, was made possible by political and economic consolidation. Hungary found itself not in some peripheral position, but fully within the sphere of the expanding market economies of Southern Germany and Venice. Prosperity reached a peak around 1400, and, in Transylvania, one of its consequences was the emergence of Kolozsvár as a centre of the arts. In 1427, at Garamszentbenedek, Tamás Kolozsvári painted what would be the most beautiful triptych created in Hungary during that century. Its panels depict the Calvary and the miracles of St Nicholas and illustrate in rich detail the material culture of the period; the work combines and brings to life the finest traditions of the Italian Trecento and Burgundian-North German Gothic. The multi-faceted nature of Transylvanian culture is illustrated by the fact that at the very time when these works of modern, Western inspiration were being created, close by, in a number of the Székelyföld's churches, artists were painting frescoes in traditional Eastern, Byzantine style. These frescoes depict St Ladislas's fight against the pagans — a legend that embodies the spirit of the borderlands — in a local, naive style; some scholars believe that motifs from Eastern, nomadic epic songs are woven into the representation of the saintly knight's legendary deeds. The 14th-century frescoes at Bögöz and Gelence depict the



The Gothic and Renaissance Styles
https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/93.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:38:24]
Last Judgment and events from the life of St Margaret of Antioch along with the legend of St Ladislas. That theme, represented in Byzantine style, would recur in numerous Székely churches, at Maksa, Csíkszentmihály, Erdőfüle, Bibarcfalva, Homoródszentmárton, and Sepsibesenyő, in 1419 at Székelyderzs, and, at the end of the 15th century, in (Sepsi)kilyén. Some suspected that these were all copies of an archetype in Várad, but art historians now tend to the view that the frescoes were independent illustrations of a legend that was part of the local oral tradition.
{1-565.} The finest piece of architecture in the Szászföld is Brassó's 'Black Church', which was begun at the end of the 1300s and completed in the following century. The design followed the model in Kassa, mediated by Kolozsvár, and adapted to local tastes, producing a stately, 89-metre long edifice — one of the largest Gothic churches not only in Transylvania but in all of East-Central Europe. Its ornamentation, leaning to late Gothic, was applied in the same period that triptychs began to spread from the Szászföld to other parts of Transylvania, including the Székelyföld. Of the 1,981 triptychs that survive from those created in Hungary during the 15th and 16th centuries, 324 originated in Transylvania, including one at Csíkménaság that dates from 1543 and is believed to be the latest of the lot. The most beautiful triptychs, at Segesvár, Medgyes, and Szászsebes, had such an impact that they induced a revival in the creation of Gothic frescoes in the mid-1400s. Among the outstanding results were a Calvary, painted by Master János Rozsnyai in 1445 at Szeben, and another Calvary in the southwestern chapel of Kolozsvár's parish church.
In the realm of secular architecture and painting, little of significance was created in Transylvania prior to the 15th century. The great landowners' castles, such as the five built, or received from the king, by the Losonci Bánffy family, were rather plain and sombre edifices. However, by the mid-1400s, a splendid Gothic castle stood at Vajdahunyad; its interior was decorated with a series of Renaissance frescoes, commissioned by King Matthias, depicting courtly games (or, according to some, the raven-legend of the Hunyadi family). The first Gothic townhouses, including Matthias's birthplace in Kolozsvár, also date from this period.
In the course of the 15th century, the Saxons' churches, and then those of the Székelys in Csík, were fortified in anticipation of Turkish attack, giving rise of a distinctive feature of Transylvanian architecture. The most picturesque were churches whose chancels were topped by one, sometimes two additional stories, and whose {1-566.} ambulatories were equipped with arrow slits and machicolations. The chancel thus became in effect a second tower, facing the original spire, which was similarly converted into a strong tower. Of the 230 surviving Saxon churches, thirty are fortified in this fashion. They are located between the Maros, Kis-Küküllő, Olt, and Homoród rivers, at Szászbogács (the northernmost site), Bolkács, Buzd, Nagydisznód, Mártonhegy, Nagysink, Szászfehéregyháza, Magyarkapus, Berethalom, and Ecel, as well as within the perimeter marked by these villages. Most of them also had a peripheral wall equipped with turrets. The other churches were not fortified in themselves, but were given a peripheral wall that had a walkway with arrow slits and incorporated storerooms. Somewhat later, when the threat arose of Turkish attack from the direction of Moldavia, the Székely churches in Csík began to be fortified. These too, notably at Csíkkarcfalva and Csíkrákos, displayed distinctive local features.
The end of the 15th century saw an upsurge in church-building by the mendicant orders and in the smaller towns. The hall churches at Torda, Dés, and Kolozsvár (Farkas Street) bear the stylistic hallmarks of the ones found in Debrecen, Nyírbátor, and Szeged, and represent an East Hungarian variant of the late Gothic. The earliest ceiling frescoes, at Gogánváralja (begun in 1503) and on the vault of the chancel (which bears a coat-of-arms) at Székelydálya, blend late Gothic motifs with decorative elements of the Tuscan Renaissance. The artistry of the Italian and South German Renaissance is admirably reflected in Gyulafehérvár's Lázói Chapel and in the vestry door that was commissioned by Kolozsvár's parish priest, János Klein. The Renaissance thus reached Transylvania, where it would come into full flower after the Battle of Mohács.

4. THE PERIOD OF AVAR RULE 4. THE PERIOD OF AVAR RULE The Avar Occupation of Transylvania
Gepidia's Destruction, Gepidic Traces
The historical account of the war's catastrophic outcome for the Gepids is consistent with archaeological finds. Of the Gepidic cemeteries (and settlements) that have been uncovered so far on the Great Plain and in the TiszaMaros-Körös region, not a single one bears clear traces of having been in use after 567. Most of the few sites that reveal some continued use in the Avar period are located in the Temes region, where more Gepids survived. These observations confirm that during the war, the Avars devastated the region between the Körös and Maros rivers, and illuminate why the Avars {1-223.} chose these lowlands, 'empty' and well-suited to stockbreeding, as one of their principal areas of settlement.
The situation was rather different in the Temes region, where — according to contemporary Byzantine sources Gepidic villages existed around 600; the sources also indicate the presence of Gepids as late as the 9th century in parts of the Sirmia and Slavonia along the Danube and Drava rivers. In the new, 'Avar' cemeteries that emerged at the turn of the 6th century, with the stabilization of Avar settlement, there are scarcely any distinctive traces of Gepids; the latter could not avoid assimilation into the Avars' social order and culture — a culture that was dominated, in turn, by Persian-Byzantine costume and fashion.
These facts help to illuminate the situation in Transylvania, where the Gepids' fate was equally catastrophic. Out of 30 assessable cemeteries of Gepids dating from the 6th century, at least 25 — along with the proximate villages fell into disuse after 567–68. What cannot be determined is whether this break was due to the marshalling of forces against Langobard attack (i.e. to the fact that all men capable of bearing arms had been marched off to the Tisza and never returned), or to the defensive battle against Avars advancing along the Maros, and the reprisals suffered by the Gepids after their defeat.
The total abandonment of the Gepids' settlement and cemetery at Malomfalva-Moreşti can be attributed to the Avar invasion, for there remains no trace of Gepids after 567–68. That Avar settlers supplanted the Gepids is confirmed by an early Avar pit-dwelling ('house no. 9') found on the site of the devastated Gepid village, as well as by a similar pit (house no. 35) uncovered at Borsóföld.
In Transylvania, unlike in the Great Plain, some Gepidic cemeteries remained in use: several along the Maros River (Marosnagylak, Marosveresmart), one in the Mezőség (Mezőbánd), and one by the Nagy-Küküllő River (cemetery no. 3 at Baráthely-Bratei). Most of these are large, with as many as several hundred {1-224.} graves, and are situated east and north of the area that was settled by the first Avars to arrive; all of them lie a considerable distance from the presumed Transylvanian site of the clash between Avars and Gepids. The people of the peripheral Gepid villages linked to the cemeteries presumably bowed to the inevitable and voluntarily submitted to their new rulers. The villages underwent a peculiar transformation after the turn of the 7th century. The native Gepids continued to form the core population; this is evident from the techniques, shapes, the smoothed or stamped decoration of pottery, from the comb-makers' products, and from women's apparel. However, in the 7th century, the Gepids' traditional fashions became mixed with features of the Avar culture (interment with horses, harnesses, eastern vessels, pike-heads, belt-ornaments — including buckles of German II style, and beads) as well as of the Avar-Slavic culture (half-moon shaped earrings, earrings with star-shaped pendants, bracelets with horn-shaped ends, hair-clasps with spiral tips, Byzantine buckles, and buckets with ironwork), and the bearers of these cultures evidently mingled with the Gepids. However, certain finds in these cemeteries, dating from around 600, cannot be identified either with the Gepids or with the culture of the early Avar period: the traces of armed men who came from the area of Western Merovingian culture. These people buried their dead with heavy shields, fitted with distinctive bosses; long, double-edged swords (indicated, in despoiled graves, by silver or bronze buttons that had fastened a sword-belt); assault knives (sax); spears with long, willow-leaf shaped blades; and arrows with a twisted shaft and feathered head. Their weapon belts, also of obviously foreign origin, had ball-headed iron studs, triangular plated buckles, and, in many instances, iron ornament encrusted with silver. The foreign weapons and belts belonged to males buried in coffins, most of them iron-bound, that testified to a distinctive funeral rite. There are only a few traces of women who might have accompanied these warriors: reliquaries of undoubted Western

Merovingian {1-225.} origin were found in the graves of two women at Mezőbánd, while a woman's grave at Marosnagylak and another at Baráthely yielded brooches of the same provenance.
These observations point to the conclusion that the first deliberate settlement in Transylvania of 'SouthernGermans' was the work of the Avars. They provided a haven in this remote corner of their domain for Danubian and Rhenish Alamanni and Bavarians who had been put to flight by the internecine quarrels of Merovingian kings and princes. (The graves of Avar refugees in Bavarian cemeteries indicate that the flow moved in both directions.) The refugees had evidently borne arms for various factions in their homeland, and they preserved their independent status in the Avars' country; they remained professional warriors, and married local Gepids. The assessment of the cemeteries at Marosnagylak and Baráthely (no. 3) will throw more light on the question.

The 'Tót' Slavs of Transylvania
https://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/62.html[2020. 11. 02. 12:38:46]
Toponymy and Chronology
1. TRANSYLVANIA'S INDIGENOUS POPULATION AT THE TIME OF THE HUNGARIAN CONQUEST
Early Slavic Society in Transylvania
The 'Tót' Slavs of Transylvania
Judging from river-names and archaeological finds, at the time of the Hungarian Conquest, a population that spoke a Slavic language and had a Slavic material culture could be found where the mountains met the plains and in most other regions of Transylvania. By that time, three great Slavic language-groups had emerged — the eastern (Russian), western (Polish, Czech-Moravian, Wendish-Sorbian), and the southern (Bulgar, Serbo-Croatian, Slovene). Hungarian settlers encountered all of the linguistically-differentiated Slav groups, except for the Serbs, who still lived in {1-358.} isolation from the Hungarians, and the Elbe Slavs. The Hungarians called these people by their own names, and in accordance with their current political status: Orosz (Russian), Lengyel (Pole), Cseh (Czech), Marót (Moravian), Nándor or Lándor (Onogundur Turkic names for Bulgaro-Slavs), and Horvát (Croat). Such names figure among the 10th–13th century toponyms in several regions of Hungary (e.g. Orosz, Oroszi), where they identify the presence among the Hungarians of a residual ethnic settlement.
This type of place-name, indicating the scattered creation of Slav settlements soon after the arrival of the Hungarians, is less common in Transylvania than in the rest of Hungary: there is a village in the Szamos region called (Páncél)cseh, while along the Maros, two villages are called Nándor, and two others bear the name Oroszi. These five Slavic settlements are of such early origin that by the time the Romanians arrived, their inhabitants had become assimilated to the Hungarians. This is clearly indicated by the fact that, in Romanian, the two places bearing the name Oroszi are called Urisiu and Orăsîia, while Páncélcseh is called Panticeu; thus the Hungarian names were adapted, without regard for their original meaning, into toponyms that have no Romanian meaning. Normally, when Romanian settlers encountered Russian or Czech communities, they devised a toponym that designated the ethnic group (e.g. Rusul, Ruşii), but evidently they found no community that was overtly Slavic in these villages. The case of the two villages called Nándor is even more instructive. In Old Hungarian, the word 'Nándor' signified 'Bulgar', but it fell into disuse, probably soon after 1000 AD), when the Bulgar realm fell under Byzantine rule. The word survived only in place-names. The two Transylvanian settlements are located in a region which, according to archaeological and historical sources, had been under Bulgar rule around the year 900. The Hungarian name of the two villages may have indicated residual Bulgar settlements, or, alternatively, communities established by Bulgars who had fled Byzantine occupation. {1-359.} Evidently, the inhabitants no longer spoke Bulgaro-Slavic when the Romanians came to call these villages Nandru and Nandra; there is no word akin to 'nándor' in the Romanian language, and if the newcomers had wanted to evoke Slavs, they would have used the word 'şchiau', which is derived from the Balkan-Latin 'sclavus'.
In earlier times, the Romanian word 'şchiau' probably designated all southern Slavs, but today, the toponym Şchei, borne by many villages in Wallachia and Moldavia, refers exclusively to Bulgars. Around the middle of the 13th century, when Bulgar power waned and most Balkan Romanians fell under Serbian rule, Romanians living north of the Danube began to use the word 'Sîrb'(= Serb) in reference to all Balkan Slavs. Only two Transylvanian toponyms approximate the Romanian name 'Şchei'. One is Şchei (Hungarian name: Bolgárszeg), a suburb of Brassó, where the name probably evokes Bulgar, or simply Slavic merchants. The other is Şteiu (Stejvaspatak) in Hunyad county. The derivation of that toponym is revealed by the mention of Zkey in a medieval document: having lost its original, ethnic significance, the name evolved into a form that has no inherent meaning. Beginning in the mid-13th century, Transylvanian Romanians followed suit in calling Slavs 'Sîrb'; thus Tótfalu (see below for the Hungarian use of 'Tót'), a village in Hunyad county mentioned in documents as far back as 1484, came to be called Sîrbi by the Romanians.
In short, toponymic and archaeological evidence indicates the presence of Slavs in Transylvania. But where were their settlements, and were they present in large numbers at the time of the Hungarian Conquest? The time-frame of the most relevant archaeological sites is some four centuries, and there are only twelve of them, a tiny number from which to draw conclusions concerning such a vast area. The sites do indicate that prior to the arrival of the Hungarians, the main concentrations of Slav settlement were in the {1-360.} Nagy-Szamos valley, along the middle

reaches of the Maros, and along the upper reaches of the Olt (including the vicinity of the Kis-Küküllő and NagyKüküllő rivers). They also serve to distinguish three cultures: the first, in the north, was probably of eastern Slav origin; the second, in the southwest, was a culture of uncertain origin, marked by a primitive economy, and belonging to a mixed population that included Avars; the third culture, in the centre, consisted of a few Bulgar communities that were established rather late and appear to have been well-organized. As noted earlier, the Transylvanian Slavs adopted and passed on only a few ancient river-names; Abrud and Ompoly, both in the economically-important goldmining region, as well as Szamos, Maros, and Olt, the three major waterways. The land that they settled was almost deserted, and they gave Slavic names only to mountain streams. The written sources that date from, or before the 13th century corroborate these highly general observations but offer no additional information concerning the Slavs in Transylvania. The only source of further enlightenment is a toponymic analysis that reaches beyond river-names to encompass place-names.
Apart from the five localities noted earlier, there is only one place-name that may be linked to the presence of Slavs before the 13th century: Nagytóti, in Hunyad county. The name is of an early type. Moreover, the Romanians who settled there in the 13th century could not have encountered Slavic-speakers, for otherwise they would have probably named the place 'Şchei' or 'Sîrbi' (as in the case of Tótfalu) and not converted the Hungarian name into the Romanian Toltia. The toponym 'Tóti' contains the word which Hungarians generally applied to Slavs. To be sure, in the Middle Ages the Hungarians referred to Slavonia as Tótország (country of the 'Tóts'), but at the time of the Conquest, they already called all the Slavs living within their frontiers 'Tót'. The word is probably derived from the German 'teut', meaning 'people', and it may have been the Gepids' assumed name, for they retained it after they {1-361.} became Slavicized. This hypothesis is reinforced by the fact that the latest reference in historical sources to the Gepids indicates that in the 9th century, they lived in the region between the Drava and the Sava, the very land which came to be called 'Tótország'. Although the continuity of Gepid burial sites in Transylvania extends no further than the 7th century, they survived as assimilated Slavs to witness the Hungarian Conquest, and perhaps they continued to refer to themselves as 'Tóts'.
There is every indication that the Transylvanian Hungarians used the word 'Tót' to refer to the non-Bulgar Slavs in their region. The fact that in all of Transylvania there is only one place called Tóti, in the peripheral Hunyad county, indicates that there was no scattered immigration of 'Tóts' into the region's interior over the three centuries following the Conquest. Since the names of neighbouring Slavic peoples can be found in local toponyms (e.g. Nándor, Oroszi), it is likely that the Slavs native to Transylvania were known as 'Tóts'. This conclusion is also supported by the fact that localities came to be named Tótfalu, Tótháza, and Tóttelek as late as the 13th and 14th centuries. The Romanians sometimes adapted these names, producing Totfalău, Tothaza, and Totelec. In other instances, they substituted either Sîrbi, which generally denoted 'Slav' (examples are found, as noted, in Hunyad county, and also beyond Transylvania's borders, in Bihar, Szatmár, and Szilágy counties), or Tăuţi (in the case of Tótfalud, in Alsó-Fehér county, and of Tótfalu in Kolozs county); the toponym Tăuţi was derived from 'tăut', a Hungarian loan-word in the Romanian language, and one that came to serve as a personal name in both Transylvania and Moldavia.
The use of 'Tót' to denote Slavs in general lingered on in Transylvania through the 13th century, and possible as late as the 14th or 15th centuries; only later did it come to mean exclusively Slovak. The 'Tót' toponyms do not contradict this observation, for there lived scattered groups of indigenous Slavs under Hungarian {1-362.} rule, and the collective term was handy for naming their settlements. What is more surprising is that the Transylvanian Slavs, whose presence is attested to by archaeological, toponymic, and historic sources, did not spread out to create new settlements that might have borne names like Tóti and Tótfalu. The likely explanations are that their number at the time of the Hungarian conquest was very small, and that they were rapidly assimilated. Of the 2056 placenames found in documents dating before 1400, some 102 (5 percent) are of Slavic origin, and a further eighteen indicate Slavic inhabitants; but it cannot be ascertained in every case whether the village had existed before the Hungarian conquest or had appeared much later, perhaps only a few decades before its first citation in a document.
There are, however, a few linguistic features and historical indices that throw some light on the problem. A certain nasal speech sound, which disappeared in the 10th century from the language of the Carpathian Basin's Slavs, has been preserved to this day in five toponyms: Gerend and Dombró (situated between the Maros and the Aranyos), as well as Gambuc, Csongva and Dombó (between the Maros and the Kis-Küküllő). Thus the Slavs must have been present in the area between the Aranyos and the Kis-Küküllő at the time of the Hungarian conquest; yet these

same Slavs were among the first to become assimilated to the Hungarians, for when Romanians settled in the region during the 14th century, they invariably adapted Hungarian versions of the Slavic toponyms (including the above-noted five, as well as Torockó, Polyán, Mohács, Lóna, Lekence, Herepe, Pacalka, Akna (2), Zsitve, and Bázna). Thus the early, Slavic population of this region can be identified with those who lived under Avar and Bulgar rule and left archaeological traces.
There is no reliable evidence to indicate what language was spoken by these Slavs, or by their ancestors, who settled in the area before the Bulgar conquest, i.e. prior to 800. One clue is the name {1-363.} of a locality north of the Aranyos River, in the Mezőség: Szelicse, which cannot come from Bulgarian, for then it would have been Szelistye. Since there is a total absence of Slavic traces in a broad swath between Szelicse and the Aranyos, it is likely that the northern boundary of the Bulgars' domain followed the same course. The five Slavic villages whose names retain the nasal lie along this swath, but it is likely that the Slavs living to the north of Szelicse belonged to a different cultural and linguistic group.
The Slavic population in the Szamos watershed must have been even sparser than in the rest of Transylvania, for the pre-1400 documents reveal only 38 toponyms of Slavic origin. Most of these are in the northern, mountainous region, where one also finds Slavic river-names. However, there is nothing to indicate when these settlements were founded; the only certainty is that Slavs lived in the region prior to the settlement of Germans in the late 12th century around Radna and Beszterce, for these new arrivals adapted Slavic toponyms, and called Beszterce, Radna, and the river Lekence, Bistritz, Rodna, and Lechnitz respectively. The present form of the Slavic place names in Romanian are of little help for almost all of them were adopted from Hungarian (Sălicea, two places called Gîrbău and two called Lona, Dorna, Ielciu, Cernuc, Zalha, Şimişna, Jeica, Lechinţa, Jelna, Luşca, Tărpiu, Năsăud, Vălcău, Băbiu, Călian, Pălatca, Sumurduc, Năoiu, and perhaps also Prislop, Rebra, Iurca, Lozna, Calna, Bistriţa, and Rodna, though the last two might have been borrowed from German). Only two place names, Stoiana and Rogna, were adapted directly from the Slavic. Interestingly enough, the Romanian names of three localities, Ardeova, Nearşova, and Vlaha, were obviously adapted from the Slavic variants of the Hungarian toponyms Erdőfalva, Nyárszó, and Oláhfenes. These villages (along with five others whose names reflect the same phenomenon) lie in a perennially Hungarian-inhabited district near Kolozsvár. What is even more remarkable is that in the case of Erdőfalva and Nyárszó, the Slavs arrived after the {1-364.} Hungarians, adapted the Hungarian toponyms, and then passed them on to even later arrivals, the Romanians. The third name, Oláhfenes, is clearly of Slavic origin, and although 'Oláh' means Vlach, the Romanians adapted the toponym without translating it. Since this village was first mentioned (along with its Roman Catholic church) as Oláhfenes in 1332, and since it was always inhabited by Hungarians, the possibility arises that 'Oláh' in its name refers not to Romanians but to another neo-Latin ethnic group, and that its original Hungarian name may have been Olaszfenes (cf. Olaszliszka, Olasztelek).
In light of the foregoing, great caution must be exercised in dating the Slavs' settlement in the region, for toponymic hints of their presence in the mid-1100s can be found only in the German settlement areas around Beszterce and Radna. It must be borne in mind that there were probably fewer Slavs (and thus Slavic toponyms) north of the Maros and the Aranyos at the time of the Hungarian conquest than the number suggested by the pre1400 documents; and that a large proportion of the latter number immigrated — as did Romanians — into a Transylvania depopulated by the devastating Mongol invasion of 1241-42. There is no doubt that this new wave of Slavic immigration consisted of Russians. The latter must have settled down amidst Hungarians, Germans, and Romanians, for their localities bore Hungarian, Hungarian- Romanian, or, in one case, Hungarian-RomanianGerman names: Oroszfája — Orosfaia in Kolozs county (1297); Szeretfalva — Sărătel — Reussen (1296), Oroszfalu — Rusu (1305), and Oroszmező — Rusu (1315) in Beszterce-Naszód county; and Oroszfalu — Ruşii (1319) in Marostorda county. The Russian immigration probably touched the Kolozsvár district, giving rise to the three villages noted earlier; it reached as far the southern borderlands of Transylvania, where the relevant toponyms include, in Nagyküküllő county, Kund — Cund — Reussdorf (1332); in Szeben county, Szerdahely Mercurea — Reussmarkt (1290), Rosszcsőr — {1-365.} Ruşciori — Reussdörflein (1380), and Rusz — Ruşi Reussen (1424); and, in Hunyad county, Oroszfalu — Ruseşti (1367) and Oroszfalu — Ruşi (1453).
Toponymic investigation reveals a radically different ethnic mix in the mountains between the Maros and the Aranyos, and south of the Nagy-Küküllő. Some 51, or fully half of all the Slavic place-names noted in the pre1400 documents are found in this area, which accounts for around one third of Transylvania. In terms of the SlavHungarian nexus, the Székelyföld stands out, for all eighteen place-names of Slavic origin were converted to



The 'Tót' Slavs of Transylvania

Romanian via the Hungarian version, whereas to the west of the Székelyföld, only three (Bábolna, Doborka, Pród) followed this pattern, the remaining thirty being adapted straight from the Slavic original. The northern borderline of the region, where cohabited large numbers of Romanians, Slavs, and — judging from the toponyms — Germans and Hungarians as well, stretches from Szolcsva, on the Aranyos, through Orbó and Gyulafehérvár/Bălgrad (to the north of the Maros) and Sztrázsa, Drassó, Zalatna, Lemnek, and Ugra (to the south of the Maros and NagyKüküllő), then turns sharply southward to end at Törcsvár (Bran). The toponyms reveal little about the beginning and duration of this cohabitation beyond the fact that when the Germans arrived in the 12th century, they made direct contact with the Slavs; the name of Szeben, the locality that would become the principal German centre, was derived from the Slavic-named Zibin stream. The relatively close relationship between Slavs and the Romanians is attested by the fact that in the case of localities with Hungarian as well as Slavic names, the Romanians generally adapted the Slavic variant (e.g. [Gyula]fehérvár — Bălgrad, Őregyház — Straja). The Romanian choice of a Slavic name for Gyulafehérvár suggests, however, that when this Transylvanian capital was founded, upon Roman ruins, in the 10th century, the Slavs may have been present, but the Romanians were not; otherwise, the Romanian name of Gyulafehérvár would have been Cetatea Albă.
{1-366.} The linguistic identity of southern Transylvania's Slavic communities — apart from a few pockets of Russian settlement — cannot be ascertained. The ending, 'inci/inţi', that was attached to some Hungarian toponyms in the late Middle Ages (as in Bokaj — Băcăinţi, Lozsád — Jeledinţi, Piski — Pischinţi, and similar names in the Banat and Oltenia)) led some to suspect the presence of southern Slavs; but this Slavic suffix also occurs in northern Moldavia, where it can only be of Russian derivation. As noted, since the words 'Tót' (in Hungarian), and 'Sîrb' as well as 'Tăut' (in Romanian), were applied in the 14th and 15th centuries to all Slavs, they do not serve to identify specific ethnic groups. Thus the only certainty is that there were Bulgaro-Slavic elements, and later some Russians, among the numerous Slavs of southern Transylvania in the Middle Ages. This Slavic population retained its language at least until the mid-1200s, may have replenished its numbers through immigration after the Mongol invasion, and became assimilated — partly into Hungarian, but mainly into the Romanian culture — only towards the end of the Middle Ages.

The Burial Site at Marosszentanna

TRANSYLVANIA Gothic Settlements and Cemeteries in Transylvania
The Burial Site at Marosszentanna
Some seventy years after its discovery, this Visigothic burial ground still offers the best, and indeed, the only penetrating look into the Goths' religious beliefs, society, and ethnic relationships, as well as into the Gothic material culture that reflects all these aspects.
The bodies of the dead were laid out in two directions, perpendicular to each other. Most of the graves are aligned along an approximate north-south axis. In the northern half and the northwestern quarter of the cemetery, amidst and, in the case of the fourth and ninth graves, above the former, twelve graves were found inserted on an westeast axis. The latter graves, with the exception of two that held the remains of women (one wealthy, the other poor) in Gothic costume, contained no grave goods, and there were neither vessels nor traces of food in any of them. The hands of two of the corpses were clasped in a Christian manner; these were the most recent graves in the graveyard (phase 3).
The core of the burial site had been obliterated by a sandpit. Its oldest and largest part (dating from the end of the 3rd century or first half of the 4th century, phase 1) lies northeast of the pit; here, only one or two peripheral graves are of a more recent date. It was on top of this older section that the latest east-west graves were placed.
Bronze and silver fibulae with half-moon shaped ends were found to the south and west of the sandpit. Since these objects did {1-152.} not appear before the middle third of the 4th century, and came to be worn mainly in the second half of the century, they identify the more recent section of the burial ground (phase 2). It is striking that neither the pagan sacrificial meat — pork, goat's meat, mutton, and poultry — nor the cooked eggs that were commonly placed in graves were found in the more recent Gothic graves or in the graves without burial objects. Also noteworthy is the small number of vessels indicating ritualistic offerings of drink. In the older part of the burial ground, entire sets of vessels were placed in the graves. Sets of vessels for the storage and comsumption of food and drink (pots and mugs, plates and glasses respectively) were found in some twelve graves; there were, on average, five or six vessels per grave, with 9–12 in the case of some lavish graves of boys and girls. The profusion of vessels — i.e., of provisions for the other world, stored in pots or on plates — also characterizes other early 4th century, Gothic burial grounds in Transylvania (e.g. those at Rugonfalva, Csombord, Marosújvár, and Mezőerked). In the more recent section of the burial site, graves contain only one vessel, or none. This reflects not social differences — the buried ornaments are richer — but an evolution of the Goths' religious beliefs.
Objects worn by both poorer and wealthier Gothic women, such as fibulae, clasps, combs, bead necklaces, and pendants of Roman origin were found in graves, as were objects associated with their daily work, such as the clay spindle-whorls, the bone receptacles of sewing needles, and knives. The grave goods of the men were modest: a bronze or iron buckle, flint and steel, a few knives, vessels, and the occasional iron fibula. In at least four or five graves, bodies were laid down in a supine position, on a north-south axis, without grave goods; it is possible that these had been poor but free Goths.
Only a few goods of Roman provincial provenance — an earthenware jug, two or three cheap glasses — were unearthed at Marosszentanna. Even copies of Roman vessels are absent at this {1-153.} burial site. No other Visigothic burial ground displays as little Roman merchandise and 'influence' as this one, the greatest burial site discovered in the heart of Dacia.
