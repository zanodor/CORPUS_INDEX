Mythical Beasts: The White Stag
ztevetevans April 26, 2014
The white stag, like many other mythical creatures, wanders through
the tangled forests and wild moorlands of our distant past. Elusive
and rare, our forefathers may have caught a glimpse in some hidden
glade in the woods, or seen it moving ghost-like across the wild
moors, or maybe stood high on a rocky outcrop crowned against the
sky. The white stag was always something to be desired yet always
out of reach. Always leading the hunt onwards, ever onwards, to a
destiny ordained by the gods. From the dark, distant memories of
the Wild Hunt have grown the very stuff of legends.

Encounters with the White Stag
For those humans who encountered a white stag, there were often
profound consequences, sometimes stimulating great spiritual
changes within a person. Sometimes these encounters have been



the trigger of great events leading to the creation of nations and
kingdoms. Even to this day the consequences of legendary
encounters of the remote past are still visible and can be seen in
action.
The White Stag in Mythology and Folklore
Traditionally the white stag has often been interchangeable with the
unicorn and appears in the folklore and mythology of many different
cultures around the world. In ancient times deer were hunted for
food but they also supplied leather, bone and gut which had many
uses and were an important resource in hunter gatherer and early
agricultural societies. So when a rare white stag was chanced upon,
maybe it is no surprise that legends and myths grew up around the
sightings of this unusual and mysterious beast.
Many of the legends can be traced back through European and
Asian culture. From Mesopotamia, Babylon, and Assyria and from
Mongolia, and China and even in Japanese mythology, the white stag
can be found depicted in art, in records and in legends.
Celtic Mythology
In Celtic mythology, the White Stag symbolises the existence of the
Otherworld and that forces from the Otherworld are present and in
action. The Celtic god Cernunnos was depicted zoomorphically as a
man with horns growing from his head.
In earlier times the Celts believed that the white stag was an agent
from the ‘Other worldʼ and a bringer of great changes to those it
encountered. The white stag often appeared when something
sacred, or a law or code, was being broken.
The Legend of the Wondrous Stag in Hungarian Mytholgy



One of the oldest and most revered legends of the Hungarian people
is the Legend of the Wondrous Stag (sometimes Hind, or Doe) and
Fred Hámori provides one of the best renditions of the legend.
The story goes that Hunor and Magor the sons of Nimrod, the great
hunter king, gave chase to a white stag that led them to a new
country and the establishing of the Huns and Magar peoples in
Scythia. In some versions, the sex of the creature is ambiguous.
Sometimes it is it is a horned doe, or hind that is chased.
The cosmos was considered the mother of the sun and was
represented by a horned female doe, or hind. Being a symbol of the
cosmos she also carried the stars and the moon as well as the sun
between her horns. Just as the cosmos was her mother she was the
mother of the stag who symbolised the sun.
White Stag Leadership Development
In a speech at the end of the Fourth World Wide Jamboree of the
Scouting movement, founder Sir Robert Bade-Powell said, ‘You may
look on that White Stag as the pure spirit of Scouting, springing
forward and upward, ever leading you onward and upward to leap
over difficulties.ʼ Later in 1958 the White Stag leadership and
development program was born from this speech which today is
known worldwide.
Scottish Folklore
In Scottish folklore around 1128, the King of Scotland was David I
who was the son of Malcolm Canmore and St Margaret. The legend
goes that on the day of the Feast of the Holy Rood he went out
hunting despite advice given to him by his priest who had warned
him against it.



Ignoring this advice, King David I had ridden out and came across a
white stag. He immediately gave chase but became unsaddled from
his horse who threw him. The White Stag turned to attack.
Helpless, David fell on his knees and cried out to God to protect
him. The Stag charged full on at David with its antlers down. Just
as the antlers were about to strike he managed to grab them. As he
did so the antlers turned into a cross and the stag stopped dead in
its tracks, lifted its head high and simply disappeared into thin air.
To give thanks to God for saving him, David built and dedicated a
shrine to the Holy Rood which later became Holyrood Abbey leading
to the development of Holyrood Palace. Holy Rood means Holy
Cross.
Arthurian Legend
In many of the legends of King Arthur, the white stag is elusive and
hard to catch. It is the pursuit of the beast that represents
humanityʼs spiritual quest, always searching for something just out of
reach. Its entrance or discovery is often the stimulus for his knights
to begin a high and noble quest.

The White Hart in Heraldry
Richard II of England chose the White Hart for his own heraldic
symbol. In Heraldry in England as well as many parts of Europe it
became an important symbol.
The magnificent work of art, the Wilton Diptych, depicts Richard
wearing a gold and enamel jewel and an image of a white hart. The
Virgin Mary is present and the angels also are wearing white hart
images. The work of art is actually an alter piece and on the outside
is also an emblem of a white hart.



As a Christian symbol
In Christian symbolism the white stag can sometimes be seen as a
symbol of Jesus. The Roman soldier St. Eustace converts to
Christianity at the beckoning of a white stag with a cross between its
horns that he encounters.
The stag talks to him revealing that he was Jesus and that he had
been hunting him. Eustace was told that though he did not yet know
it, he had great faith in Christ that he and his familyʼs faith would be
greatly tested and so it proved to be.
World Mythology
Versions of the legend appear in many different parts of the globe
including Mayan Indian and Japanese versions. In Japanese
mythology a stag is hunted by twin brothers but the beast eludes
them. The twins argue about which way to take and finally split up
in different direction. One goes east and one goes west. The twin
that takes to the east eventually discovers Japan.
Purity, Divinity, and Awakening
In many traditions white is the colour of divinity and purity and white
can also be the color of peace or of truce. In Celtic tradition white is
associated with the Other-world and After-life. The role of the white
stag is often to lead the hunters to new beginnings, new places, and
new insights and to new knowledge. It was something that could
never be captured. Always keeping just a little bit ahead of the
hunters and drawing them ever onwards to new places as it did with
the sons of Nimrod leading them to a new land, or as with David,
King of Scots, to new spiritual awakening.
A Natural Phenomenon



There is plenty of evidence with sightings, videos and photographs
that prove that the white stag is not just a supernatural beast but
natural phenomenon. White stags and deer are often wrongly
thought of as being albino. In fact they inherited a rare genetic
condition called leucism.
In the USA when a small herd of White-tailed deer became isolated
from the outside world in what was once the Seneca Army Depot,
Seneca County, New York, the resulting inbreeding produced a high
number of white deer making it the largest known herd of white deer
in the world. Also in the US, the Argonne National Laboratory also
has white deer in its grounds.
Recent Sightings of White Stags
A report by the BBC and updated on 11 February 2008 has a sighting
of a white stag captured on video. This shows a white stag moving
among a group of does over open moorland somewhere on the west
coast of the Scottish Highlands. The exact location is being kept
secret to protect the stag from hunters and trophy seekers.
The Daily Mail also reported in an update on the 7th December 2009
of the discovery of a white stag in the Forest of Dean, in
Gloucestershire, England by photographer Ken Grindle who
managed to photograph it.
Protection from Trophy Hunters
Most sightings are now kept secret or their locations are not
revealed. The head of a full grown white stag with a full set of
antlers would fetch many thousands of pounds. One recent sighting
in the Scottish Lowlands attracted such bids from hunters soon after
its location was revealed but the landowner is refusing all offers.
Hopefully these wonderful animals will be far better protected than



the one that was killed by trophy hunters around the county
boundaries of Cornwall and Devon in October 2007.
The Stuff of Legends
These photographs and videos reveal a beast of mystery and
majesty. For those who are close to nature as our ancestors were
and those of us today who have a deep affinity with the natural world
to encounter one in hidden forest glades or moving ghost-like
through the mists of the moors, must be an unusual and
unforgettable experience. Indeed, the very stuff legends are made
from.
