There is also little doubt that Mundigak site precedes the height of
Indus civilization. "The Early Harappan (c. 3200-2600 B.C.) is made
up of four regional phases," writes Gregory Possehl "that are thought to
be generally contemporary: the Amri-Nal [Sindh-Balochistan], Kot Diji
[Sindh], Damb Sadaat [Balochistan], and Sothi-Siswal [Gujarat]" (The
Indus Civilization A Contemporary Perspective, 2002, p. 40).
The so-called Mundigak III period (3400-2900 BCE) corresponds with
this most closely, and follows a Mundigak I [c. 4000-3500 BCE] and
Mundigak II [c. 3500-3400 BCE] periods. There are many similarities
both with these Early Harappan cultures to the east and south, and
traditions in the north and west, putting Mundigak at the crossroads of
different emerging regional pre-Bronze Age cultures.

Aṃśumatī अंशुमती the river lit.' full of aṃśu, Soma', ancu 'iron' (Tocharian) and Kr̥ṣṇa कृ ष् ण the demon in RV

Aṃśumatī (अंशुमती):—[=aṃśu-matī] [from aṃśu-mat > aṃśu] f. Name of a river
(Yamunā?), [Ṛg-veda viii, 96, 13-15] The association with Yamuna is suggested because the river is associated with Kr̥ṣṇa कृ ष् ण the demon in the three r̥ca-s.
I suggest that Aṃśumatī may refer to a river in Tocharia since ancu, ams'u is
associated with iron, metalwork and Soma was procured from the traders of Mt
Mujavant. One speculation is that Mt. Mujavant may be Mushtagh Ata in Kyrgystan.
Muztagh Ata (7546 m.) is the second summit of Tian-Shan according to the altitude
and situated in Kun-Lun range on the territory of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region
of China.
Aṃśumatī may refer to Aksu river which joins Kashgar river.

"Mundigak (Pashto: مونډي ګاګ ), in Kandahar, Afghanistan, is an archaeological site in Kandahar province in Afghanistan. It's
situated approximately 55 km northwest of Kandahar near Shāh Maqsūd, on the upper drainage of the Kushk-i Nakhud
River. Mundigak was a large prehistoric town with an important cultural sequence from the 5th-2nd millennia BC. The mound
was nine meters tall at the time of excavation. Pottery and other artifacts of the later 3rd millennium BC, when this became a
major urban center, indicate interaction with Turkmenistan, Baluchistan, and the Early Harappan Indus region. Mundigak
flourished during the culture of Helmand Basin (Seistan), also known as Helmand Culture (Helmand Province). With 21 hectare
area, this was the second largest centre of Helmand Culture, the first being Shahr-i-Sokhta which was as large as 150 acres, by
2400 BCE. Bampur, in Iran, is a closely related site. Around 2200 BCE, both Shahr-i-Sokhta and Mundigak started declining,
with considerable shrinkage in area and with brief occupation at later dates. Mundigak has some Indus Valley Civilization
related material. This material consists in part of ceramic figurines of snakes and humped bulls, and other items, similar to those
found at other Indus valley sites. Pottery found at Mundigak had number of similarities with such material found at Kot Diji.
This material shows up at the earliest layer of Kot Diji. Remains of a "palace" is found in one mound. Another mound revealed
a large "temple", indicating urban life.Mundigak and Deh Morasi provide early developments in what may be now called
religious activities. A white-washed, pillared large building with its door way outlined with red, dating around 3,000 BC is
related to religious activities. Apart from pottery and painted pottery, other artifacts found include crude humped bulls, human
figures, shaft hole axes,adzes of bronze and terrecotta drains. Painting on pots include pictures of Sacred Fig leaves (ficus
religiosa) and tiger like animal. Several stone button seals were also found at Mundigak. Disk Beads and faience barrel
beads, copper stamp seals, copper pins with spiral loops were also found.The female looking human figurines (5 c.m.height)
found at Mundigak are very similar to such figurines found at another archeological site in Afghanistan, Deh Morasi Ghundai.
