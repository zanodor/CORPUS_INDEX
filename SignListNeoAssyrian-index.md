List of Neo-Assyrian Cuneiform Signs
A practical and critical guide to the Unicode blocks »Cuneiform« and »Cuneiform Numbers« of Unicode Standard Version 5.0
Version 1.2 – 14. 10. 2007 (codepoint in Nr. 588 fixed)
Introduction (by R. Borger)
November 2 and 3, 2000 the Initiative for Cuneiform Encoding (ICE) was founded in Baltimore. The initiator was D. Snyder, Baltimore. The name was a misnomer. It should have been ICUE = Initiative for Cuneiform Unicode Encoding. The real initiative for cuneiform encoding had been taken 1987 by Paul Li. Rev. Li’s pioneer font had been replaced by Borger’s fonts Akkadian RB, 1996. Akkadian RB had been vectorized and released under the name Laser Akkadian by Linguist’s Sostware, Edmonds WA, 1999/2000. Also elsewhere cuneiform fonts had been written with various encodings.
Sign lists with Unicode encoding were written and published in the Internet by M. Everson (N2297, November 20, 2000, based on Li’s original font), by Snyder & S. Tinney (N2664, to which a revision N2664r was added), and by Everson & Tinney & K. Feuerherm (N2698). June 8, 2004, Everson & Feuerherm & Tinney offered their »Final proposal to encode the cuneiform script« (N2786) to the Unicode Consortium.
Meantime, Akkadian RB had enabled Borger to write his rather voluminous MesZL = Mesopotamisches Zeichenlexikon (Münster, March 2004), with relative ease. The sophisticated and very full Hardegsen font NeoAssyrian (F. Ellermeier, with highly competent technical support by M. Studt) enabled Ellermeier to write his Kurzglossar, likewise with relative ease.
More details about the history of cuneiform electronic fonts are given in Borger’s article UgaritForschungen 35 (2003/04) 79–102 (and in MesZL chapter I).
2006, aster some more changes (not always corrections), the »final proposal« was canonized by the Unicode Consortium as part of The Unicode Standard, Version 5.0. It consists of the hexadecimal numbers 12000–1236e, 12400–12462, and 12470–12473.
The code charts of Unicode Standard 5.0 are a frame that can be filled with several special fonts. Hitherto the Tinney/Everson Font »Cuneiform Classic«, mainly based on the signs of the Ur III period in Southern Mesopotamia, is the sole »canonized« Unicode font with cuneiform signs in existence. IC(U)E expected that several other fonts would be prepared by cuneiformists interested in font architecture and delivered in Baltimore. For that reason codepoint numbers have been assigned providently to Hittite/Hurrite signs, a few Neo-Assyrian signs, and even one Elamite sign. However, in order to introduce the important fonts for other periods and regions, hundreds of additional provident codepoints could and should have been inserted into the »final proposal«, before offering it for Unicode »canonization«. MesZL was accessible to IC(U)E when the final proposal was written,

chapters I and II in preliminary printout even long before the book was published. Borger’s work should have inspired and enabled IC(U)E to tackle this task.
Cuneiform sign lists are traditionally based on the Neo-Assyrian signs and arranged according to the position of the basic elements of cuneiform writing. This traditional arrangement has been thoroughly revised by Borger in his MesZL. The Neo-Assyrian script is the best and most regular version of cuneiform writing. Of course, all cuneiformists must be well acquainted with this classical script, including Sumerologists. Regrettably, it is practically impossible to arrange other versions of cuneiform writing (including the Ur III signs) by the shape of their signs in a consistent and unequivocal way.
In the Unicode Standard the characters are transliterated into, and arranged according to our Latin alphabet. The method chosen by IC(U)E is described as »a variant of simply ordering the characters according to their transliteration«: »alphabetical by primary sign name with complex signs based on the primary sign organized according to graphic principles; in some cases, these correspond to the native analyses« — whatever that may mean in detail.
Cuneiformists under given circumstances use a »conventional reading« for every sign, as described e.g. in chapter II of MesZL. The Unicode Standard introduces a new set of conventional readings, without offering any explanation. It also makes extensive use of the principle of »splittability«, again without explanations or cross references. In order to find out how in the Unicode Standard characters may have been decomposed, the user must consult Chapter II of MesZL and/or Y. GONG, Die Namen der Keilschristzeichen. In many cases the user must write characters missing in the IC(U)E font by combining two or three other signs (14 and 21 key strokes respectively!), and he must find out the codepoints of these shorter signs himself. Some signs are »splittable« in the third millennium, but not in all other periods; so they should by all means have got codepoints of their own. It is not to be expected that Assyriologists will ever replace their ways of transliterating cuneiform texts by the system of the Unicode Standard of 5.0. The codes of Unicode are complicated and susceptible to errors. The impracticable (or even bad) »conventional readings« and the rather thoughtless splitting of characters are obstacles for users, even if they are qualified Assyriologists.
Users of the present Tinney/ Everson Unicode font will very quickly be confronted with its shortcomings. The linguist D. A. Bachmann (Zürich) tried to help users of the Unicode font with its cuneiform blocks by publishing a »List of cuneiform signs« in the Wikipedia (October 2006). He organized and numbered the cuneiform signs in agreement with MesZL. Aster the first column of his list he mentions the traditional Deimel numbers, the numbers of the Hethitisches Zeichenlexikon, the Unicode codepoint numbers according to the »Standard 5.0«, and the Unicode »conventional readings«. When this list became known to Mrs. Studt (Hardegsen), she contacted Borger about the pros and cons of Bachmann’s list. Borger had in course of time succeeded in deciphering most of the secret lore of the Unicodists. He had discovered several errors, mainly in N2664 (see Ugarit-Forschungen 35 96ff.), but also in the later proposals. Supported by Borger’s notes, Mrs. Studt wrote a thoroughly revised version of Bachmann’s list.
Her revised Bachmann list contains: Col. 1) The sign numbers of MesZL; Col. 2) The traditional numbers of Deimel etc., completed and adapted in Ellermeier and Studt, HA (see Col. 5); Col. 3) The numbers of Mittermayer, aBZL = Altbabylonische Zeichenliste der sumerischliterarischen Texte, Fribourg and Göttingen 2006 (a very useful contribution to Sumerian paleography);



3
Col. 4) The numbers of Rüster and Neu, Hethitisches Zeichenlexikon; Col. 5) The Neo-Assyrian signs, from the Ellermeier and Studt font NeoAssyrian.ttf (see Ellermeier and Studt, Sumerisches Glossar, Band 3 Teil 6, Hardegsen 2003, Handbuch Assur, together with CD-ROM; with the aid of AutoText circa 9000 Sumerian and Akkadian transliterations can be converted into cuneiform signs, bitmaps as well as TrueTypes). A few signs were additionally digitized especially for this sign list; Col. 6) The sign names (conventional readings) according to MesZL, HA etc.; Col. 7) The Unicode codepoint numbers (here the entries »A & B« and »A & B & C« indicate the numerous characters that can only be written by combining two or three shorter signs); Col. 8) The Unicode sign names (conventional readings); Col. 9) Comments.
According to the IC(U)E proposals, including N2786 (June 2004, the »final proposal«, where MesZL is quoted and used a few times) all existing non-Unicode cuneiform fonts are failures. For the Hardegsen font the reader may simply have a look at column 5 of the revised Bachmann list, and he will immediately recognize that the Hardegsen Font is an excellent tool. As to my own »Akkadian RB«, let me state that the users of MesZL (and Babylonisch-Assyrische Lesestücke3, 2006) did not yet rebuke the aged author (*1929) for the bad quality of his fonts and for not having waited till a superior Neo-Assyrian font would have been standardized by IC(U)E and the Unicode Consortium. For the Helsinki font in its actual form see Ph. Talon, Enūma eliš (Helsinki 2005, with forthcoming review by Borger in Orientalia NS).
The dogma »There is no Code but Unicode and Unicode is the Standard« is not valid for cuneiform studies!
It is difficult to believe that Unicode 5.0 will ever be a starting point for a generally acceptable comprehensive set of cuneiform fonts for other periods and regions.
Presently the only publication using the signs of a Unicode cuneiform font (based on proposal N2698, January 29, 2004; not yet on N2786, June 8, 2004) is Tinney’s electronic »ePSD« (July 31, 2004). Printouts are present in several libraries. The cuneiform signs in this »provisional drast« are clear, but their use leaves much to be desired. Characters not found in N2698 are simply silently omitted. The enlarged version »PSD drast – not for citation« (April, 2005) in the printout known to me has no cuneiform signs at all. To this enlarged version four electronically prepared indices have been added. The second index of the PSD drast, comprising 66 pages, is arranged according to the IC(U)E conventional readings. Apparently the users were supposed to make themselves perfectly acquainted with all conventional readings used by IC(U)E, in order to profit by the blessings of the Unicode standard.
The list of Bachmann & Studt may be helpful for students who would like to find references to Unicode codepoints and conventional readings on the basis of MesZL Chapter II. A printout of this list combined with a printout of • http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U12000.pdf and • http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U12400.pdf may pave the way to Tinney’s »Cuneiform Classic«. It should, however, be kept in mind that Tinney’s font, which contains numerous signs reconstructed from later sources, is not a real paleographical tool on the level of Mittermayer, aBZL and Fossey, Manuel II.
Very recently Mrs. Studt discovered in the inexhaustible Internet an open type font by George Douros, called »Akkadian.otf« (2007). The cuneiform signs of »Akkadian.otf« are identical with the



4
signs of Tinney’s »Cuneiform Classic« as represented in the charts of Unicode Standard 5.0. Douros added to the Supplementary Private Use Plane two new blocks: F2000–F208B = Names of the extra glyphs, and F2400–F2418 = Cuneiform numbers and punctuation. In Snyder’s Proposal N2664 a large number of signs have been changed, corrected or omitted in the later proposals N2698 and N2786, and Tinney cum suis had good reasons to do so. The supplement of Douros is simply a collection of errors etc. committed in N2664! So the so-called extra glyphs must nearly completely be deleted. The list of the cuneiform numbers has some signs not found in the canonized version, but here all new entries should be checked carefully. See http://users.teilar.gr/~g1951d/Akkadian.pdf
As shown by the Internet documents on cuneiformsigns.org of Lloyd B. Anderson (Ecological Linguistics, Washington DC; participant in the Baltimore ICE congress of November 2000), Dr. Anderson during the first months of 2004 made serious efforts and adduced strong arguments in order to convince the Unicode Technical Committee that the project was on the wrong track. 2002 I had sent him the first two chapters of my MesZL on floppy disks. So he was able to use my new sign order and numbering, which he kindly called »a real improvement«, in his discussion with IC(U)E and Unicode a few months before MesZL was published. The UTC, however, neglected Anderson’s valuable suggestions. So important practical guidelines of the project were decided by persons, who were no cuneiformists at all. If the UTC had taken Anderson’s suggestions seriously, many entries of our new list would not have had to be written.
Cuneiformists who must use the present imperfect »standard« Tinney font may feel grateful for support given by specialists who, though not belonging to the select inner circle of Unicode and ICE, are well acquainted with the development of studies on cuneiform up to the present time. Users of Mrs. Studt’s document will enjoy its practical layout - and even its aesthetical quality.
