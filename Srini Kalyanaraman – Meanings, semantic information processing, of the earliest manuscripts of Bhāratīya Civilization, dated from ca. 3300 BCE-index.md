# Index for Srini Kalyanaraman – Meanings, semantic information processing, of the earliest manuscripts of Bhāratīya Civilization, dated from ca. 3300 BCE.pdf

Meanings, semantic information processing, of the
earliest manuscripts of Bhāratīya Civilization, dated from
ca. 3300 BCE
The monograph explains meanings of select inscriptions from SarasvatiSindhu Civilization. An explanation is provided on how hieroglyphs are recognized and how Meluhha meanings are derived from Deśī, deśa
bhāṣā called Meluhha; Deśi means ‘guild of merchants’; Deśī ( is one of the arieties of the r rta dialect; see K ya literature 1.33. Meluhha is attested as Mleccha language in ā ha parvan of the Great Epic, Mahābhā a a-- Vidura, Mine-worker-artisan
Khanaka and Y dhiṣṭi a converse in this language to understand the metallic weaponry and devices of the lac fort, designed by Duryodhana to kill the ṇḍa a and Draupadi.

Conclusion: Ancient Bh ratam of Saras ati-Sindhu Civilization, ca. 4th millennium BCE is exemplifed by semantic, cultural unity of ALL Bh ratīya bh ṣ , falsifying the recei ed wisdom of Indo-Aryan, Dravidian, Mundarica
language-family divide. Meluhha of artisans and seafaring merchants unified the nation making it the richest nation on the globe by 1 Comon Era (pace Angus Maddison), accounting for over 33% of World Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
The ośa establishes unified Deśī, deśa bhāṣā called Mel hha -
Bhā a īya सं कपर्भाषा , sprachbund,lingua franca, of the Civilization. The
received wisdom of so-called Indo-Aryan, Dravidian, Austro-asiatic divide of languages is FALSIFIED by the evidence of inscriptions, dated from ca. 3300 BCE and a unified semantic structure and essential semantic UNITY of ALL the ancient spoken forms of over 25 ancient dialects (Prakrtam) of Sarasvati Sindhu Civilization is demonstrated.

Author: Kania Bench: Kania
JUDGMENT Kania, J.
1. This case, which involves a sum of three thousand rupees only, has been contested as a test case to determine certain points in the diamond trade in Bombay. Plaintiffs, a firm dealing in diamonds, handed over to defendant No. 1 173 diamonds on or about November 8, 1934, on terms signed by him in the plaintiffs' book. That document runs in the following terms:...29. At this stage Mr. Desai for the plaintiffs states that he does not press for a decree against defendants Nos. 1, 2 and 3. There will, therefore, be a decree for the plaintiffs against defendant No. 4 in terms of prayer (a) of the plaint. In due course the diamonds, exhibit F, would be handed over to the plaintiffs.

Update on the reading and meaning of zebu seals.
Mohenjo-daro Seals m1118 and Kalibangan 032



Harappa rchaeological Project (HARP) Source of image: https://www.harappa.com/indus/27.html This is the report of JM Kenoyer for the HARP project:"The majestic zebu bull, with its heavy dewlap and wide curving horns is perhaps the most impressive motif found on the Indus seals. Generally carved on large seals with relatively short inscriptions, the zebu motif is found almost exclusively at the largest cities of Mohenjo-daro and Harappa.The rarity of zebu seals is curious because the humped bull is a recurring theme in many of the ritual and decorative arts of the Indus region, appearing on painted pottery and as figurines long before the rise of cities and continuing on into later historical times. The zebu bull may symbolize the leader of the herd, whose strength and virility protects the herd and ensures the procreation of the species or it stands for a sacrificial animal. When carved in stone, the zebu bull probably represents the most powerful clan or top officials of Mohenjo-daro and Harappa. Harappa Archaeological Research Project."-- JM Kenoyer
The thorny hieroglyph on the pōḷī 'dewlap' (Marathi) of zebu, bos indicus is: * aṇṭ la ʻ thorny ʼ. [ aṇṭa -- 1] Gypsy. eur. karalo ʻ thorny ʼ, H. k ṭā , Gujarati. k ṭā .(CDIAL 2678) Rebus:† aṇṭh la -- m. ʻ boat ʼ lex. [ aṇṭhá -] Gujarati k ṭhā ʻ maritime ʼ.(CDIAL 2682 . This is emphatic evidence of maritime trade by artisans, seafaring merchants of Sarasvati-Sindhu Civilization. Rebus of pōḷī 'dewlap'; pōḷa m A bull dedicated to the gods, and set at large is pōl da n. steel (Marathi); pōḷa 'magnetite,
ferrite ore' (Mundari). The zebu, bos indicus is also called in Kathiawar
(Gujarati) hunt, hūṭ Brahmani bull (Kathiawar G. ; hūṭṛo entire bull used for agriculture, not for breeding (G. (CDIAL 3899 . Decoded rebus: hūṭ  ̃community (Guild . Cf. hūṭ a community, sect, society, division, clique, schism, stock (Santali)
(Santali). Thus, the zebu, bos indicus taurus, is the signifier of a socio-economic organization of artificers working with iron/steel smelters. The signified are the GUILD of iron, steel smelters. Thus, zebu inscriptions constitute the professional calling cards of Members ofGuild iron/steel artisans. Inscriptions also detail wealth accounting ledgers of cargo produced for maritime trade.
The hieroglyphs on a Mohenjodaro seal



have been recognized -- ayaskāṇḍa ‘a quantity of iron, excellent iron’
( ṇini. gaṇap ṭha Thus, the message of the inscription of the Seal signifies excellent magnetite ore equipment (for) maritime trade transaction. The circumscript hieroglyph on the second seal is a synonym for the arrow-head hieroglyph Sign 211.
Jumping tigers are repeated on scores of inscriptions.
kul, kola 'tiger' Rebus: kol, kollan 'working in iron, smith' + cāl 'jumping' Rebus: sal 'workshop'
Three hieroglyphs in a sequence cluster This clustered sequence occurs on 100+46+75+5 = 226 inscriptions of Mahadevan 1977 Concordance of ASI; since 1977, the Concordance/Corpora of inscriptions has grown from about 2000 inscriptions to over 9000 (as of 2022).
This sequence of three hieroglyphs reads, from r. to l. a) spine or backbone, b) rim of jar, c) currycomb. The readings are:



a) aṇ , n ‘The spine or bac -bone'; synonym with a different
pictorial representation: ṇá 'one-eye' Rebus Meluhha ṇ 'wealth, goods, possessions'
b) ká ṇa, ká ṇikā 'handle of a vessel, round protuberance' Rebus: ká ṇa 'scribe', kā aṇī 'supercargo of a ship'; kanahā 'helmsman' ká ṇasāla 'writers' workshop' ká aṇa 'accounting' This meaning is attested
in Tolkāppiyam: ப ொய் யும் வழுவும் த ொன்றியபின்னர்அய் யர் யொ ்
னர் கரணம் என் (ப ொருள் அதிகொரம்:கற்பியல் ,4). When
falsehood and deception came into vogue, the Brahmin scholars codified the accounting system.
c) Currycomb, scraper: kha eḍo = a currycomb (Gujarati) [ har r ] m ( H) A currycomb. 2 Currying a horse. (Marathi) र haraḍy a ( ) That writes or shaves rudely and roughly; a mere quill-driver; a very scraper. Rebus: 1. [ araḍ ] Hard from alloy--iron, silver &c. (Marathi) 2. har dī ‘ turner’ (Gujarati 3. wealth-accounting ledgers -kharada 'daybooks'.
Together the hypertext of three hieroglyphs provides the message, meaning:
a) kāṇā 'wealth, goods, possessions'
b) ká aṇa 'accounting'
c) kharada 'daybook'. Thus, together, the sequence of three hieroglyphs as hypertext signifies the message: wealth accounting daybook (ledger).
The prefix hieroglyphs of rimless pot Sign 328 baṭa 'rimless pot' rebus: baṭa 'iron' bhaṭa 'furnace' + II, III, IIII two, three, four linear strokes signify the following rebus readings:
II dula 'two' rebus: dul 'metal casting'
III kolom 'three' rebus; kolimi 'smithy, forge'
IIII aṇḍa 'four' rebus: kaṇḍa, khaṇḍa '(metal) equipment'
Thus, read together with Sign 328 'rimless pot' the readings for the composite message hypertext are



Wealth accounting daybook (ledger) of: a) metalcasting iron furnace; b) smithy, forge iron furnace; c) metal equipment (from) iron furnace. The word baṭa 'iron' (Gujarati) may signify 'metal in general'. This semantics of 'metal' is attested in the following vocabularies of a number of languages from Kannada and IndoAryan lexicons:
Signified: vartaka -- ʻ bell -- metal, brass ' Signifier: vartaka 'quail' *vartakara ʻ ma ing turns (of the quail ʼ.

It may be necessary to add explanatory notes for the variant spellings or pronunciations for the SAME word, SAME semantics because of the nature of evolution of phonetic forms in 25+ languages of the Sampark bhasha or lingua franca. What we are working on is a construct of the spoken forms of words by artisans and seafaring merchants as distinct from grammatically correct forms derived from padapatha of Panini. We are dealing with Prakrtam des'i 'language of artisan and merchant guilds' best presented in Prakrtam and Hemacandra lexicons. What we are achieving with this spreadsheet creation is an explanation for the essential semantic and cultural unity of ALL Bharatiya languages during the days of Sarasvati Sindhu Civilization when the River Sarasvati was a NAVIGABLE WATERWAY for maritime trade activity.
Explanatory notes explain the process for identifying hieroglyphs, hypertext compositions; providing READINGS in Meluhha samparka bhasha and MEANINGS of the inscriptions (in English). It may be necessary to translate the spreadsheet work and documentation into HINDI for a wider reach. We



are dealing with English to identify the des'i words of periods earlier than 4th millennium BCE of a semantically unified, vibrant, economically resurgent nation of Bharatam Janam, called Bharatam. This is provision of economicsocial roots of the Bharatiya civilization.
Artifact Id. includes Excavation Number, e.g. m278 Excavation number DK8473 NMI134 (Shown in Reference cell of the spreadsheet).
Rhombus or oval are orthographic variants of the same pattern. There is a clear lexical entry which explains the shape of a metal ingot
(iron): Bihari. m h ʻ opening or hole (in a sto e for sto ing, in a handmill for filling, in a grainstore for withdrawing ʼ(CDIAL 10158 m h = the quantity of iron produced at one time in a native smelting furnace of the Kolhes; iron produced by the Kolhes and formed like a four-cornered piece a little pointed at each end (Santali)
Thus, rhombus or o al are interpreted as m h 'ingot' OR iron produced by
the Kolhes and formed like a four-cornered piece a little pointed at each end Such a shape constitutes an castiron ingot.
Sprout is different from a harrow which is duplicated and distinguished from Sign 162 'rice plant' in a composition hypertext Sign 347/348. Sign 162 is distinct from Sign 167. Sign 167 is a sprout. A variant hypertext occurs including this hieroglyph four times. Paul Yule has provided archaeological evidence of koru 'bar of metal' used as ingot. Ta. koru bar of metal, ploughshare. Ma. koru ploughshare. Ko. kov iron point of plough. To. ku· ploughshare (< Badaga gü·, Language 15.47; the word occurs only in one passage and the meaning is arrived at by etymology). Ka. kura, kuru, gura, guru ploughshare, iron used in cauterizing. Tu. koru a bar of metal. (DEDR 2147)
This sign 167 occurs in contexts of hieroglyph sequences comparable to the Sign 162 which signifie kolmo 'rice plant' rebus: kolimi 'smithy, forge'. Thus,Sign 167 is used to signify a bar of metal (ingot), while Sign 162 is used to signify a smithy/forge.

See the use of Sign 162 to create a hypertext of Sign 347.
Sign 328 'rimless pot'



Sign 347 is sign 328 ligature with two sign 162 hieroglyphs: dula 'two' rebus: dul 'metal casting' PLUS kolmo 'rice plant' rebus: kolimi 'smithy, forge' PLUS Sign 328 baṭa 'rimless pot' rebus: baṭa 'iron' bhaṭa 'furnace'. Thus the hypertext of Sign 347 reads: dul kolimi bhaṭa 'metalcasting smithy/forge furnace'
Sign 190 is a hypertext composed of 1. count of four; 2. sprout (Variant of Sign 169). Thus, the message is: bar of metal & equipment.

Ayagapatta, Kankali Tila, Mathura. "Jain homage tablet. The tablet was set up by the wife of Bhadranadi, and it was found in December 1890 near the centre of the mound of the Jain stupa at Kankali Tila. Mathura has extensive archaeological remains as it was a large and important city from the middle of the first millennium onwards. It rose to particular prominence under the Kushans as the town was their southern capital. The Buddhist, Brahmanical and Jain faiths all thrived at Mathura, and we find deities and motifs from all three and others represented in sculpture. In reference to this photograph in the list of photographic negatives, Bloch wrote that, "The technical name of such a panel was ayagapata [homage panel]." The figure in the centre is described as a Tirthamkara, a Jain prophet." http://www.cristoraul.com/ENGLISH/readinghall/UniversalHistory/INDIA/Cambridge/I/CH APTER_XXVI.html
khambhaṛā 'fish-fin' rebus: kammaṭa 'mint, coiner, coinage' PLUS dula 'pair' rebus: dul 'metalcasting' PLUS aya 'fish' rebus: aya 'iron' ayas 'alloy metal'. Thus, metalcasting, alloy metal mint.



Mahavamsa XXV,28 (5th cent. Pali text) uses two words from this Indus Script text: ayo kammaṭa dvā a.’gateway of alloy metal mint’. This is an apparent allusion to the Sanchi, Bharhut stupa gateways.
Bharhut gateway ayo kammaṭa dvā a
Sanchi stupa gateway showing ayo kammaṭa dvā a Note on Indian Lexicon by s. Kalyanaraman (1978). The work covers over 8,300 semantic clusters which span and bind the Indian languages. The basic finding is that thousands of terms of the Vedas, the Munda languages (e.g., Santali, Mundarica, Sora; cf. Munda lexemes in Sanskrit)(37 kb.), the so-called Dravidian languages and the socalled Indo-Aryan languages have common roots. This belies the received wisdom of clea age between, for example, the Dra idian or Munda and the Aryan languages.’

Lexemes of Epigraphy (281kb.)
It may be necessary to add explanatory notes for the variant spellings or pronunciations for the SAME word, SAME semantics because of the nature of evolution of phonetic forms in 25+ languages of the Sampark bhasha or lingua franca. What we are working on is a construct of the spoken forms of words by artisans and seafaring merchants as distinct from grammatically correct forms derived from padapatha of Panini. We are dealing with Prakrtam des'i 'language of artisan and merchant guilds' best presented in Prakrtam and Hemacandra lexicons. What we are achieving with this spreadsheet creation is an explanation for the essential semantic and cultural unity of ALL Bharatiya languages during the days of Sarasvati Sindhu Civilization when the River Sarasvati was a NAVIGABLE WATERWAY for maritime trade activity.
These are explanatory notes explaining the process for identifying hieroglyphs, hypertext compositions; providing READINGS in Meluhha samparka bhasha and MEANINGS of the inscriptions (in English). It may be necessary to translate the spreadsheet work and documentation into HINDI for a wider reach. We are dealing with English to identify the des'i words of periods earlier than 4th millennium BCE of a semantically unified, vibrant, economically resurgent nation of Bharatam Janam, called Bharatam. This is provision of economic-social roots of the Bharatiya civilization.

Sign 403 MEANING-- cast iron ingot.



Sign 403 is a duplication of
bun-ingot shape. This shape is signified on a zebu terracotta pratim found at Harappa and is consistent with mūhā mẽṛhẽ process of making unique bun-shaped ingots (See Santali expression and meaning described below):



Slide 33. Early Harappan zebu figurine with incised spots from Harappa. Some of the Early Harappan zebu figurines were decorated. One example has incised oval spots. It is also stained a deep red, an extreme example of the types of stains often found on figurines that are usually found in trash and waste deposits. Approximate dimensions (W x H(L) x D): 1.8 x 4.6 x 3.5 cm. (Photograph by Richard H. Meadow) http://www.harappa.com/figurines/33.html I submit that these oval spots signify pōlāda, 'crucible steel cake' explained also as mūhā mẽṛhẽ = iron smelted by the Kolhes and formed into an equilateral lump a little pointed at each of four ends (Santali)
Sign 403 is read: dul mūhā mẽṛhẽ 'cast iron ingot'. mūhā mẽṛhẽ = iron smelted by the Kolhes and formed into an equilateral lump a little pointed at each of four ends (Santali)
Thus, rhombus or o al are interpreted as m h 'ingot' OR iron produced by
the Kolhes and formed like a four-cornered piece a little pointed at each end Such a shape constitutes an castiron ingot.
Sprout is different from a harrow which is duplicated and distinguished from Sign 162 'rice plant' in a composition hypertext Sign 347/348. Sign 162 is distinct from Sign 167. Sign 167 is a sprout. A variant hypertext occurs



including this hieroglyph four times. Paul Yule has provided archaeological evidence of koru 'bar of metal' used as ingot. Ta. koru bar of metal, ploughshare. Ma. koru ploughshare. Ko. kov iron point of plough. To. ku· ploughshare (< Badaga gü·, Language 15.47; the word occurs only in one passage and the meaning is arrived at by etymology). Ka. kura, kuru, gura, guru ploughshare, iron used in cauterizing. Tu. koru a bar of metal. (DEDR 2147)
This sign 167 occurs in contexts of hieroglyph sequences comparable to the Sign 162 which signifie kolmo 'rice plant' rebus: kolimi 'smithy, forge'. Thus,Sign 167 is used to signify a bar of metal (ingot), while Sign 162 is used to signify a smithy/forge.
