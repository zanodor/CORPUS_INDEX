This is a Sumerian door plaque. It served as a backplate for a door handle.
The handle fit into the square hole in the middle.
There are many similar examples of Sumerian door plaques. They all have
the same motif.
In the top register, a king and queen enjoy a feast while being attended by
their servants.
In the lower registers, the servants bring food and drink. Animals are led
to the sacrifice, meaning this is a religious festival.

The king and queen hold date clusters.
On all the plaques shown on this page, every king and queen has a date
cluster.
Holding a date cluster while eating dinner is highly unusual behavior, to
say the least. This isn't something that people normally do, so it clearly has
a symbolic or ceremonial meaning.
It has been suggested that the date cluster was a symbol of fertility, but
this is not correct,
for the simple reason that Inanna is sometimes shown holding a date
cluster. She was not
a goddess of love, marriage, childbearing, or fertility. She was the goddess
of lust and war
(the very opposite of fertility) and she had no children. So far as Inanna is
concerned,
a date cluster has nothing to do with fertility.
Inanna holds a date cluster while her brother the sun god rises above the
mountains.
Inanna was the most important goddess in Sumer. She was “The Queen of
Heaven”,

and in her role as a goddess of war, she was often praised in connection
with royal power
and military might.
I therefore suggest that the date cluster is a symbol of power and royalty.
In Sumerian art,
the date cluster tells us two things about the men and women who hold it.
First of all, they are royals. They are members of the kingdom's ruling
family, meaning
they are kings and queens, and not just lords and ladies. There are several
examples of
known kings and queens holding a date cluster. Ever conscious of their
rank, they would not use this unique symbol of power if it also represented
mere lords and ladies.
Second, and more important, the date cluster associates the king and
queen with Inanna
and it thus symbolizes their divine right to rule.
The date cluster means the king and queen have been ordained by the
goddess herself.
By extension, their right to rule is sanctioned by all the other gods of
heaven.
This means that the king and queen were also divine (or semi-divine).
They were deified
monarchs. They were regarded and treated as gods, whether or not they
were actually worshiped as gods in temples. These are some of the earliest
known examples of the
divine right to rule, which became the royal tradition throughout most of
the world until the modern era
Sumerian monarchs had many other symbols of royalty, such as crowns,
robes, and
scepters, but only the date cluster of Inanna symbolized their divine right
to rule.
Sumerian door plaques showing kings and queens holding date
clusters:
These are followed by other examples in Sumerian and Akkadian art.

In the top register, the servant standing before the queen has his right
hand tucked under his left armpit. This is a gesture of submission and
obedience. The king is on the left.
In the missing portion of the bottom register, the chariot of Inanna, the
goddess of war,
is drawn by mythic animals (griffins?).

On some of the plaques, the date cluster looks like a leaf frond. That's
because the cluster was often simplified to make it easier to carve on a
small scale.
At the lower left, a musician plays a harp.
On all of the plaques, various animals are brought in to be sacrificed,
emphasizing the religious nature of the festivities.

In the bottom register, two men have their hands folded in prayer. The
lion at the lower left is the "animal familiar" of Inanna.
In the upper register, the man standing before the king has his hands
folded in prayer, suggesting the king was deified as a living god, worshiped
in his lifetime.

gesture of obedience.
Kings and queens holding date clusters also appear in other examples of
Sumerian art.
This woman is a Sumerian queen. She sits on a throne that has carved
animal legs.
She wears a kaunakes, a flounced dress with woolen leaf petals, the official
attire of royals. She also wears a polos, the headdress of a Sumerian queen
in her role as a high-priestess. On her lap she holds a date cluster.
The polos, the kaunakes, and the throne, are enough to show that the
woman is a queen.
The date cluster is added to show that she was also ordained by Inanna.
The statue was found in the temple of Ishtar in the Akkadian city of Mari.
It was placed there during the Sumerian occupation, after the city was
conquered by a Sumerian King of Kish. See the page about Sumerian
Queens.
Ishtar is is the Akkadian name for Inanna. The Sumerians and the
Akkadians practiced the same religion.

This is the king on the Standard of Ur. He wears a royal kaunakes. He sits
on a throne
at his victory banquet (notice that it is the same kind of throne as the one
shown above).
He holds something in his hand. Part of the object is missing due to
damage. It may be a
royal scepter. Then again, it may be a date cluster. It has a slight bend, it
tapers
in thickness, and the bottom is cut at a slight angle. Click here to enlarge
the picture
so you can decide for yourself whether it is a date cluster or a royal
scepter.
When this king was buried in the Royal Tombs of Ur, men and women
were sacrificed to
serve him in the afterlife. The same is true for some other kings who were
buried in the
royal tombs during the Early Dynastic III period of history. Many people

were sacrificed
to serve them for all eternity.
This means the kings were deified monarchs. People weren't sacrificed for
mortal kings.
This honor was reserved only for divine kings who were chosen by the
gods.

This is Queen Pu-abi. She wears a regal robe, she sits on a throne, and she
holds
a date cluster. See the page about Queen Pu-abi on this website.
Like the king shown above, Pu-abi was buried with human sacrifices to
serve her in the afterlife. She was a deified monarch, ordained by Inanna
with the divine right to rule.
Akkadian Kings and Queens
Since the Sumerians and the Akkadians practiced the same religion,
Inanna/Ishtar also bestowed her blessings on Akkadian kings and queens.

This is part of a door seal. It resembles one of the cylinder seals of Queen
Pu-abi.
The inscription is difficult to read. Part of it says, "... Wife of... King of
Mari". In other words, she is the queen of Mari. She appears in the top
register. She wears a ceremonial shawl draped over her head. It is similar
to the kind worn by Sumerian queens.
Like Queen Pu-abi, this Akkadian queen is holding a date cluster.
Lamgi-Mari, otherwise known as Ishqi-Mari:

This is Lamgi-Mari, the king of Mari in Akkad. He wears the royal
kaunakes. This statute is dedicated to Ishtar.
He wears his hair in a knotted bun, the hairstyle of Akkadian royals.

Lamgi-Mari appears at the top right. On this seal, he is young and
beardless.

Lamgi-Mari appears at the top left. He is older and he wears a beard.

On each seal, Lamgi-Mari sits on a throne. He wears the royal kaunakes.
His hair is worn in the knotted bun of Akkadian royals. He holds a royal
scepter, symbolizing his right to rule.
In both cases, King Lamgi-Mari also holds a date cluster.
The throne, the kaunakes, the knotted bun, and the royal scepter − all of
these are secular symbols of royalty. The date cluster shows that Ishtar has
also bestowed upon Lamgi-Mari
the divine right to rule.
