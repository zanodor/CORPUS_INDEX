What was Miriam's husband's name?
Chana Weisberg
Miriam's husband was Caleb son of Yefuneh of the tribe of Judah.1
Caleb was one of the twelve spies sent to reconnoiter the Land of
Canaan, in preparation for the Israelites' impending invasion of Israel.
He and Joshua were the only two scouts who did not go along with
the negative and pessimistic report provided by the other ten scouts.
Instead they encouraged the people to have faith in G-d's ability to
deliver Canaan's inhabitants into their hands. Caleb famously told
the Jews: "Didn't Moses split the sea, bring down the manna, and
cause the quails to fly down to us? We can surely go up!... We will
succeed in whatever Moses says!"
Caleb's role is even more remarkable than Joshua's. Before
embarking on their mission, Moses prayed on behalf of his trusted
assistant Joshua, which explains why he didn't succumb to the
scouts' nefarious plot. Caleb, however, was "on his own." As soon as
he reached Canaan he headed for the Cave of Machpelah where the
Patriarchs and Matriarchs are interred, and pleaded with them to
intercede with G-d to give him the necessary courage and strength
to remain faithful to his mission.
Obviously, Caleb was a man of great caliber. His upright character
and actions in the incident with the spies is discussed at great length
in the Torah (Numbers 13-14).
In the aftermath of the spy debacle, G-d decreed that all the adult,
male Israelites would perish before the nation entered the Promised
Land. Only Joshua and Caleb were given immunity from this decree,



due to their courage and faith.
And they were both handsomely rewarded. Joshua succeeded
Moses as the next Jewish leader, and Caleb was given the city of
Hebron as his personal inheritance — not incidentally, the city which
houses the Cave of Machpelah.
Miriam and Caleb were two courageous leaders who were eminently
suited for each other. Miriam "earned her stripes" in Egypt, when as
a Jewish midwife she stood up to Pharaoh's demand that she
murder Jewish babies.
According to Jewish tradition, Caleb was also one of the two scouts
sent by Joshua to Jericho immediately before the Jews crossed the
Jordan River and entered Canaan.
