m 304. Mohenjo-daro seal. DK 5175, now in the National Museum of India, New Delhi. Seated person with buffalo horns.
Head gear: Hieroglyph: taTThAr 'buffalo horn' Rebus: taTTAr 'brass worker'; Hieroglyph: goṇḍe ʻ cluster ʼ (Kannada) Rebus: kuṇḍi-a = village headman; leader of a village (Prakritam)

Person seated in penance on Gundestrup cauldron surrounded by animals. The yogic posture of penance is comparable to the Oseberg Buddha on a brass handle of a bucket in a Viking shipwreck/burial.
1. Ship's prow shaped like a serpent's hood
2. Person seated in penance in a yogic posture (on the brass handle of the bucket)
3. Four svastika hieroglyphs surrounding the + hieroglyph depicted on the ship of the person in yogic posture.
The Meluhha rebus readings of these hieroglyphs are:
1. फडा phaḍā f (फटा S) The hood of Coluber Nága Rebus: phaḍa फड
'manufactory; paṭṭaḍa -- metals manufactory; pāṭroṛo pattar పట్ర paṭra, pāṭan 'smith guild, hamlet, maritime port town, market'.
2. kamaḍha 'penance' rebus kammaṭa 'mint' kammaṭi a coiner (Ka.); kampaṭṭam coinage, coin, mint (Ta.) kammaṭa = mint, gold furnace (Te.) kamaṭa = portable furnace for melting precious metals (Telugu); kampaṭṭam = mint (Tamil)
3. + hieroglyph:
The + hieroglyph signifies kaṇḍ 'a fire-altar' with the indications of dotted circles on four corners which signify dhã̄ ī 'strand' rebus: dhatu 'mineral ore'. kaṇḍ ‘furnace, fire-altar, consecrated fire’. Rebus: khaṇḍā ‘tools, pots and pans and metalware’; 3.(CDIAL 3790)

4 Four svastika hieroglyphs: sattva 'svastika symbol' rebus: sattva, jasta 'pewter, zinc' PLUS gaṇḍa 'four' Rebus: khaṇḍā 'equipment'.
'Taxila cross' "In Lahore Cathedral, there hangs on the wall,
at the upper end of the nave in the recess to the right, a small cross in a glass frame. The inscription below records that it was found in 1935 and donated to the church by Mrs Cuthbert King (Mr King then being the Deputy Commissioner at Rawalpindi). Nothing surprising about a cross in a church, except that this particular relic goes by the name of the Taxila Cross. Because it was found just outside the fortification wall of Sirkap (one of the ruined cities of Taxila), it is taken by believers as a sign of the arrival of Christianity in our part of the world at the time that Sirkap lived."http://odysseuslahori.blogspot.com/2014/07/TaxilaCross.html
Stamp seals from the Late
period levels. Such seals appear to be products of the waning years of the Indus civilization. After Figure in George F. Dales, 1965, Civilisation and floods in the Indus Valley, Expedition, Vol. 7, Issue 4. https://www.penn.museum/sites/expedition/civilizationand-floods-in-the-indus-valley/
It is clear that the 'Taxila Cross' is a hoax. A + symbol, together with svastika symbol are hieroglyphs of Indus Script. The + symbol signifies a fire-altar with the indications of dotted circles on four corners which signify dhã̄ ī 'strand' rebus: dhatu 'mineral ore'. Svastika symbol signifies hieroglyph sattva 'svastika symbol' rebus: sattva, jasta 'pewter, zinc'.
Another example of Indus Script seal is presented with a decipherment.

m0352 cdef
The + glyph of Sibri evidence is comparable to the large-sized 'dot',
dotted circles and + glyph shown on this Mohenjo-daro seal m0352 with dotted circles repeated on 5 sides A to F. Mohenjo-daro Seal m0352 shows dotted circles in the four corners of a fire-altar and at the centre of the altar together with four raised 'bun' ingot-type rounded features. Rebus readings of m0352 hieroglyphs:
dhātu 'layer, strand'; dhāv 'strand, string' Rebus: dhāu, dhātu 'ore'
Round dot like a blob -- . Glyph: raised large-sized dot -- (gōṭī ‘round pebble);goTa 'laterite (ferrite ore)A (गोटा) gōṭā Spherical or spheroidal, pebble-form. (Marathi) goTa 'laterite ferrite ore'.
Spiral-shaped prow of Oseberg ship, is carved in the form of a serpent’s head.
One object found is a wooden bucket with a brass handle and image of a person seated in penance.
I submit that this person is comparable to the boatman shown on Paris Pillar of Boatmen (ca. 1st cent. BCE) and the person seated in penance in Gundestrup cauldron.
The chest of the person seated in penance on the Oseberg bucket handle is decorated with a + hieroglph and four svastika hieroglyphs.

Oseberg bucket (© Museum of Cultural History, University of Oslo, Norway)
This bucket was one of several found on on the ship. Made out of yew wood it is surrounded by decorative brass fittings and held together with iron hoops. A wooden ladle and 6-7 wild apples were found inside it.
The famous Oseburg ‘Buddha’. Sitting in the lotus position this stylised human figure is found on another bucket from the ship. This bucket most likely originated in Ireland as the decorative motifs on the ‘Buddha’ are paralleled in Irish art work most noticeably The Book of Durrow. This suggests that bucket may represent booty captured during a Viking raid on Ireland. Five of these zoomorphic posts, all carved with different animal heads, were found in the Oseberg burial. They are fashioned out of maple wood and are of similar size. The posts contain slots for handles suggesting that they were originally carried and it is likely they had some sort of magical or religious significance.

The Oseberg ship is on display in the Viking Ship Museum in Oslo. Built of oak around A.D. 820, the craft is especially noteworthy for its spiral-shaped prow, carved in the form of a serpent’s head. There are no signs that the vessel ever went to sea, so it is believed that its sole use was funereal.

S L O W R E V E A L PROFESSOR GUSTAFSON AND HIS TEAM CAREFULLY EXCAVATED THE SHIP FROM THE OSEBERG BURIAL MOUND IN 1904.
P H O T O G R A P H B Y I M A G E C O L L E C T I O N Apart from the ship itself, the grave goods that had been left undisturbed included objects for everyday use: beds, tapestries, clothes, combs, farming tools, and tents. There was also a cart, along with the remains of 15 horses, 6 dogs, and 2 cows. The tomb was furnished with everything the deceased might need as they boarded their richly carved vessel for its last, mysterious voyage into the world of the dead.

Radiocarbon analysis of the women’s bones indicated that they died c. 1220±40 and 1230±40 before present[iv] and this ties in with the dendrochronology dates from the burial tent timbers, which indicate it was constructed in 834 AD (Bonde N, and Christensen AE. 1993. Dendrochronological dating of the Viking Age ship burials at

Oseberg, Gokstad and Tune, Norway. Antiquity 67:575-583.)Other skeletal remains found on the ship included 13 horses, 4 dogs and 2 oxen. It is likely that these represent animals that were sacrificed to accompany the female burials into the afterlife.
