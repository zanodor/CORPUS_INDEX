'goldsmith workshop' and insciptions (424) of Mundigak, Nausharo, Sibri, Dauda-Damb, Shahr-i-Soktha Corpus 3.2 of metalwork catalogues
This monograph demonstrates that many of the 'geometric designs' used on the inscriptions of the sites of Shahr-i-Sokhta, Mundigak, Mehrgarh,Nausharo, Sibri,Dauda-damb relate to metalwork.

In particular, a hypothesis is posited that the mineral resources processed as ingots from these sites constitute a network of supply routes of mineral ingots to other sites such as Chanhudaro, Mohenjodaro, Harappa,Kalibangan, Dholavira, Lothal, with smithy/forge workshops and hence, deemed to be manufacturing hubs of the Sarasvati-Sindhu Civilization.

Introduction
Thanks to Asko Parpola's team which has been consistent in their efforts to document inscriptions from Sarasvati-Sindhu Civilization.
A total of 1347 inscribed artifacts with many clearly identifiable hieroglyphs of Indus Script are demonstrated to be catalogues of minerals and metals worked in the sites of the Sarasvati-Sindhu Civilization.
The latest publication (2019) is titled: Asko Parpola, BM Pande and Petteri Koskikallio eds., 2019, Corpus of Indus Seals and Inscriptions Volume 3: New material, untraced objects, and collections outside India and Pakistan, Part 2 Shahr-i-Sokhta, Mundigak, Mehrgarh, Nausharo, Sibri, Daudadamb, Chanhu-daro; Ahar, Balathal, Gilund; Kalibangan; Rojdi, Helsinki, Suomalainen Tiedeakatemia (in collaboration with Massimo Vidale & Alessandra Lazzari;Catherine & Jean-Francois Jarrige, Gonzague Quivron & Helene Tromparent; Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; Marta Ameri; and Gregory L. Possehl.
The details of new material are as follows:
Shahr-i Sokhta: SiS-1 to 184 184 Mundigak Mgk-1 to 62 62 Mehrgarh Mr-19 to 110 92 Nausharo Ns-11 to 88 78 Sibri Sb-4 to 10 7 Dauda-damb Da-1 1 Chanhu-daro C-51 to 120 70 Ahar Ahar-1 to 19 19 Balathal Btl 1-9 9 Gilund Gld-1 to 113 113 Kalibangan K-123 to 476 354 Rojdi Rjd-1 to 361 361
Total 1347
Note: Most of the Rojdi material are graffiti marks, and many of these marks cannot be precisely identified in the context of the sign lists of Indus Script Corpora. However, some are very vivid Indus Scipt Inscriptions confirming the continuum of Indus Script Tradition during the period from 2000 BCE to 1700 BCE at Rojdi.

Mehrgarh (Hindi:मेहरगढ़ , Urdu: مہرگڑھ ), one of the most important Neolithic (7000 BCE to c. 2500 BCE) sites in archaeology, lies on the "Kachi plain" of now Balochistan, Pakistan. Mehrgarh is now seen as a precursor to the Indus Valley Civilization, displaying the whole sequence from earliest settlement and the start of agriculture, to the mature Harappan Civilisation. https://www.jatland.com/home/Mehrgarh
I submit that the earliest Indus Script hieroglyph occurs on cire perdue castings of potters' wheels found in Mehrgarh. The hieroglyph is a spoked wheel.
Sign 391
These remarkable artifacts of potters' wheels made using cire perdue (lost-wax technique) casting is dated to ca. 6000 BCE. This becomes a repeatedly occurring hieroglyph on Indus Script Corpora including four occurrences on a 10-sign Dholavira Sign Board. This spoked-wheel hieroglyph has been deciphered as the local language word in Pashto.

"Early Mehrgarh residents lived in mud brick houses, stored their grain in granaries, fashioned tools with local copper ore, and lined their large basket containers with bitumen. They cultivated six-row barley, einkorn and emmer wheat, jujubes and dates, and herded sheep, goats and cattle. Residents of the later period (5500 BCE to 2600 BCE) put much effort into crafts, including flint knapping, tanning, bead production, and metal working. The site was occupied continuously until about 2600 BCE."(Possehl, Gregory L. 1996. "Mehrgarh." Oxford Companion to Archaeology, edited by Brian Fagan. Oxford University Press). The report, based on C-14 radiodating, the mounds at Bhirrana village, on the banks of Ghaggar river, in Fatehabad district date

back to 7570-6200 BC. The previous Pakistan-French study had put Mehrgarh site in Pakistan as the oldest in the bracket of 6400-7000 BC. Mehrgarh is located near the Bolan Pass, to the west of the Indus River Valley and between the Pakistani cities of Quetta, Kalat and Sibri.
Similarly, the sites of Mundigak, Nausharo, Sibri, Dauda-Damb and Shahr-i-Soktha are also Sarasvati-Sindhu Civilization sites attesting use of fire-altars and producing metal artifacts using primarily copper as the mineral resource.
Hence, there are some seals which show a lotus with petals read rebus: tāmarasa 'lotus' rebus: tāmra 'copper'.
The + hieroglyph is repeated on a number of seals and seal impressions signifying a sacred firealtar, of the shape found in Malhar in Ganga Basin.
There are also seals with Indus Script hieroglyphs all of which relate to cataloguing of metalwork artifacts and resources.
