Astronomers make a travesty of Itihāsa. What language do astronomers understand? Does Vyāsa fail to convey skymap info to astronomers?
I am sorry I have to report on this tragic tale of Bhāratīya Itihāsa of quarrels between astronomers and language scholars.
I have traversed through field-mines created by astronomers with varying interpretations of same Mahābhārata text. Was Vyāsa so illiterate that he could not convey precisely the sky map positions observed AND recorded? Or, are astronomers such geniuses that language of poetry is but a mere metaphocial/poetic hindrance to view the majesty of the skymaps?
Can we reach a day when grammarians and language pundits sit with astronomers to reach a consensus on what Vyāsa conveys in poetry?
With great vinayam, Vyasa notes: imāṃ tu nābhijānāmi amāvāsyāṃ trayodaśīm This is a
clear reference to an eclipse occurring in thirteen tithi phases of the moon. See Kisari Mohan Ganguly's translation below.
"This, however, I never knew that the day of new-moon would be on the thirteenth day from the first lunation, or the day of full-moon on the thirteenth day from the same. And yet in course of the same month both the Moon and the Sun have undergone eclipses on the thirteenth days from the day of the first lunation." (Kisari Mohan Ganguly's translation)
Do astronomers have the freedom to read and interpret the texts to suit their mathematical genius and astronomical repertoire?
I will cite an instance of an astronomer's 2002 article.

RN IYengar, 2002, Internal Consistency of Eclipses and Planetary Positions in
Mahābhārata.
Moon and Sun were eclipsed in the same month at thirteen days (interval).
There are astronomer geniuses who convolute and state that the line does NOT refer to an eclipse at all.
Let us take a look at the context of this line referring to a pair of planets in eclipse 'grastau'.

The effulgence of the constellation known by the name of the seven high-souled Rishis, hath been dimmed. Those two blazing planets, viz., Vrihaspati and Sani, having approached the constellation called Visakha, have become stationary there for a whole year. Three lunations twice meeting together in course of the same lunar fortnight, the duration of the latter is shortened by two days. On the thirteenth day therefore, from the first lunation, according as it is the day of the full moon or the new moon, the moon and the sun are afflicted by Rahu. Such strange eclipses, both lunar and solar, forebode a great slaughter. All the quarters of the earth, being overwhelmed by showers of dust, look inauspicious. Fierce clouds, portentous of danger, drop bloody showers during the night. Rahu of fierce deeds is also, O monarch, afflicting the constellation Kirtika. Rough winds, portending fierce danger, are constantly blowing. All these beget a war characterised by many sad incidents.The constellations are divided into three classes. Upon one or another of each class, a planet of evil omen has shed its influence, foreboding terrible dangers. A lunar fortnight had hitherto consisted of fourteen days, or fifteen days (as usual), or sixteen days. This, however, I never knew that the day of new-moon would be on the thirteenth day from the first lunation, or the day of full-moon on the thirteenth day from the same. And yet in course of the same month both the Moon and the Sun have undergone eclipses on the thirteenth days from the day of the first lunation. The Sun and the Moon therefore, by undergoing eclipses on unusual days, will cause a great slaughter of the creatures of the earth.

One astronomer observes:
there is this clear reference to pair of eclipses occurring on 13th day as shown below.

Fourteenth day, Fifteenth day and in past sixteenth day, but I have never known the Amavasya (New Moon day) to occur on the thirteenth day. Lunar eclipse followed by solar eclipse on thirteenth day is in a single month etc.....
This astronomical reference "thirteen day" eclipse pair appears to be a unique astronomical observation. One interpretation is that a lunar eclipse occurred first followed by a solar eclipse on the 13th day after lunar eclipse. It also states that two eclipses occurred in one lunar month.
Further, during the war Jayadhrata was killed during evening of 13th day of war in an evening dark episode, on a clear day, which may have been a short solar eclipse occurring and concluding before sunset. This is detailed in Drona Parva. The war occurred over a period of 18 days in a place called Kurukshethra.
