Layers of the Oldest Egyptian Lexicon I
Abstract
The paper re-examines the controversies of P. Lacau’s old observation on a binary opposition of the anatomical terminology of Ancient Egyptian in the context of many new results issuing from current progress in Afro-Asiatic (Semito-Hamitic) comparative linguistics. The presented etymological examination of the Ancient Egyptian anatomical terminology corroborated a surprising distribution: one member of the synonymous pairs is usually a Semitic word, whereas the other one(s) have non-Semitic cognate(s) solely attested in some of the African branches of our language macrofamily. A relatively deeper presence of the extra-Semitic vocabulary in Egyptian has also become apparent.
Introduction
Already P. Lacau (1970, 30, fn. 2) has observed in the Egyptian lexicon „une série d’organes qui on eu ainsi un double nom: ‘le cæur’: jb et ḥ3.tj ...; ‘les sourcils’: smd. wj et jnḥ.wj ...; ‘la tempe’: m3— et sm3 ...; ‘le poumon’ zm3 et wf3.w ...; ‘le poing’: 3mm.t et ḫf— ...; ‘l’ongle’: 3b et —n.t ...”. Elsewhere (o.c., p. 92): „Quant à l’existence simultanée de deux désignations pour un même organe, nous en avons d’autres exemples en égyptien” such as tp vs. d3d3, zm3 vs. wf3, jnḥ vs. smd etc. and „un des deux noms devient alors une survivrance d’une appellation primitivement différente de l’autre nom”. Lacau has already put the unanswered question I am venturing here to examine below: „Bien d’autres parellélismes entre mots pratiquement équivalents demanderaient à être étudiés. Quels sont les sens premiers et la différence qui peut subsister encore entre d.t et nḥḥ; —3 et wr?” Working on the introductory chapter of the „Etymological Dictionary of Egyptian” (cf. esp. EDE I 36-38) surveying the diverse segments of the ancient Egyptian lexical

stock 15 years ago, I was also impressed – to be frank, not yet aware of Lacau’s above cited observation – to see the mostly binary opposition of the anatomical terminology in a surprising distribution: one member of these synonymous pairs was usually clearly reflecting a Semitic word, whereas the other one, on the contrary, appeared to have a non-Semitic cognate solely attested in some of the African branches of the AfroAsiatic (Semito-Hamitic) language family. This phenomenon is worth being thoroughly examined as it might also shed light on the prehistory of the Egyptian language. It is now high time that this research be done in the frames of my current project (ongoing since 2012) aiming at mapping linguistic aspects of the Egyptian linguo- and ethnogenesis.1 Below, in this first part, I am going to scan all these pairs from upper torso to the hair of head with an extensive etymological analysis, eager to elucidate the question whether my impression fifteen years ago was right. Finally, I try to sum up the distribution of „Semitic” vs. „African” segments of these pairs and venture to outline what is to be deduced thereof. Later, it should also be checked in some other segments of the primary or basic (i.e., inherited, not borrowed) lexicon, e.g. that of the natural phenomena, where, e.g., we have two basic words for the „sun” (r— having an Arabic cognate vs. jtn with non-Semitic parallels). Or, e.g., why do we have two synonymous terms for „eternity” (non-Semitic ḥḥ vs. d.t with an Akkadian cognate)2 used parallel throughout the millennia?
„Hair”
Eg. sr „1. (Lit. MK, LP) vom Haar einer Frau (wohl von der künstlichen Perrücke im Gegs. zum natürlichen Haar, 2. (Med., GR) Haar eines Tieres” (Wb IV 191, 3-4) = „1. tress, wig, 2. hide (of animal)” (FD 235) > Cpt. (S) cir „Haar, Streifen” (NBÄ),3. A fem. form of this word is also attested: sr.t „Haar (des Rindes)” (LP, Wb IV 191, 5). These words were arbitrarily explained J. Osing from a far-fetched deverbal root etymology.4
1 The project has been supported by a Bolyai research fellowship of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences since autumn 2012, which the author gratefully acknowledges. The lexical-etymological data issue from the author’s long-range project for an Etymological Dictionary of Egyptian (EDE, whose first 3 volumes have already been published, Leiden with Brill, 1999-2008), which were accumulated for the present paper in spring 2014 in Székesfehérvár. The data were evaluated and the ideas to be deduced thereof were formulated in summer 2014 at Balatonederics. 2 Eg. d.t „Ewigkeit” (OK-, Wb), which J. Osing (NBÄ 760, n. 919) erroneously tried to derive from Eg. dwj (hapax of obscure meaning, pSmith 18:3, v. supra) referring to an unconvincing semantical parallel not fitting the case (Eg. q3j „hoch sein” > q3.w „Höhe” → „lange Zeit”), has long been successfully identified by a few authors (Hommel 1904, 110, fn. 1; Holma 1919, 47; GÄSW #931; Vycichl 1958, 383) with Sem.: Akk. ṣiātu > ṣâtu „ferne Zukunft, Ewigkeit” [Holma] = „ferne Zeit” [AHW] = „ferne Zukunft” [Vycichl] = „distant time, far-off days (with reference to past and future)” [CAD]. The synonymous Eg. (n)ḥḥ, in turn, appears to be an innovative derivation from the basic sense „high number”, cf. ḥḥ „Million, große Zahl” (I-, Wb III 152-3). 3 Which may have passed into Nubian, cf. Kunuzi, Mahassi sīr “Haar” as suggested by E. Zyhlarz (1934-5, 172). 4 The nominal forms were ultimately derived by him (NBÄ 250) from Eg. srj “ausbreiten” (GR, Wb 191, 15), i.e., from a verbal root attested almost two millennia later than its supposed nominal derivative. On the top of this, Osing (NBÄ 823, n. 1097) tried to justify this with a forced typological parallel, German Strähne < IE *str-ei- “ausbreiten” (Kluge 1999, 800, 802), although either this root or its two sporadic Germanic reflexes with

Instead of such an artificial Wurzeletymologie5 forced upon Eg. sr, one might consider its comparison with Sem. *√ŝ—r „hair” suggested by C.T. Hodge (1976, 12, #45) as phonologically not entirely impossible, albeit it looks prima vista to be hindered by two fundamental obstacles.6 Further Afro-Asiatic cognates, however, may complicate the question, cf. Brb. *√zr „hair” (primary noun) and hence: „to pluck hair” (denom. verb) [GT] > NBrb.: Tamazight a-zzar „cheveux, chevelure”, ta-mzur-t, pl. ti-mzur-in „1. mèche de cheveux tombant sur les joues, 2. crête de cheveux au milieu du crâne”, zzer „1. épiler, 2. débarrasser une peau de sa laine, 3. déplumer, 4. arracher (herbe, cheveux, poils)” [Taïfi 1991, 811] || SBrb.: ETawllemmet & Ayr ə-zər „1. être dépouillé de ses cheveux / poils / sa laine (par maladie, grattage, arrachage), être dépilé, 2. être plumé (avoir ses plumes enlevées)”, ETawllemmet i-zəzar (nomen instr.) „poils, laines provenant de peaux d’animaux morts qu’on a dépouillées de leurs poils, 2. poils rasés ou arrachées” [PAM 2003, 897] ||| NOm.: Dizoid *sār- „hair” [GT] > Dizi sar [Flm.] = sár-u [Keefer] = sárú [Bender] = sãr-ʊ [Bender],7 Maji sāru „hair of head” [Bender 1971, #35] (Dizoid: Bender 2003, 211, #65) ||| WCh.: Hausa cṑrṓ ≈ túkkú „1. plait of hair on crown of head, 2. bird’s crest or cock’s comb” [Abr. 1962, 890, 896] = „1. a cock’s comb, 2. a small tuft of hair on the front of head” [Brg. 1934, 1043].8 All these reflexes – except for Sem. – appear to suggest a PAA *√cr „hair” [GT].9 Hausa c- (ts-) can regularly derive from PAA *c-, but not from a lateral. Brb. *z is equally regular < both PAA *c and *ĉ, whereas Eg. s- is a direct match of AA *c-, although its rare correspondence with
the basic sense “strip” have clearly nothing to do with the notion “hair, hide” in general. The same is the case with the Swedish stripa “herabhängender Haarbüschel” < *str-ei-b- (IEW 1028-9). 5 Unfortunately, Osing’s NBÄ abounds in this kind of „etymologies”, many of which – through a more thorough examination with careful outlook at the AA data – have eventually turned out to be but pure fancy, cf. Takács 2005. 6 C.T. Hodge’s (1976, 12, #45) direct equation of Eg. sr with Sem. *√ŝ—r „hair” fails, since (1) Eg. s- vs. Sem. *ŝ- are not regular and (2) Sem. *-—- is not reflected in Eg. (where the expected reflex *š—r/3 would not have been incompatible). There are, however, several instances of an irregular correspondence of Eg. s- to Sem. *ŝ-, cf. Eg. sr „Vornehmer, Fürst” (PT, Wb IV 188-9) vs. Sem. *ŝarr- „king, chief” [Djk.] (cf. Hommel 1883, 440, fn. 30; GB 795; Djk. 1965, 43; 1970, 472, fn. 89; Conti 1978, 28, fn. 2) or Eg. srf „warm sein” (PT-, Wb IV 195) vs. Sem. *ŝrp „to burn” [GT] (cf. Hommel 1883, 440, fn. 30; GÄSW 103-4; WUS #2690; Conti 1978, 28, fn. 1). As for the *-—- not reflected in Egyptian and Berber, it might perhaps be a Semitic innovation as root extension. 7 The Dizi-Eg. comparison was first suggested by A.Ju. Militarev (1991, 264, #38.11). Militarev, however, also compared NBrb.: Iznasen ə-ŝŝar „вoлocы, шepcть” provided it is not a late loan from Ar. –aš-ša—r- (in that case, though, when borrowed into NBrb., its -—- would have been retained). 8 O.V. Stolbova (1987, 201, #520) erroneously equated the Hausa term with Bokkos syah “hair” (misquoted as syaḥ and assuming hence the regular shift of ḥ/— < *r, which, however, does not apply for h), which is rather akin to its closest cognates Fyer-Tambas so and Daffo-Butura swé „Haar” [Jng. 1970, 387] indicating Ron *swah ~ *syah, which can have nothing to do with Stolbova’s artificial WCh. *ĉAHAr- „hair” (motivated by her equally false comparison with Sem. *ŝ—r). Note that Hausa šaari (sic) „hair on the chest of a ram” quoted by Orel (HSED l.c.) in comparison with Bokkos syaḥ (sic, -ḥ), Dizoid *sār-, and Sem. *ŝ—r is not recorded in Brg. 1934, 930 and Abr. 1962, 808. 9 It is to be noted that SAgaw: Awngi cərí „hair of tail” [Hetzron 1978, 138] does not belong here. Its Cushitic cognates indicate a proto-form * ̃Vr- „tail” (cf. Leslau 1979 III 187), which, by the way, might correspond to Sem. *Àahr- „back”.

the initial Sem. lateral *ŝ- < AA *ĉ- has also been observed. Sem. *ŝ-, in turn, seems to originate from PAA *ĉ-. Therefore, if we accept the relatedness of the Hausa form, there seem to emerge two diverse PAA root varieties, namely *√cr vs. *√ĉr „hair”. The lautgeschichtliche situation in NOm. is not yet as clear so the data thereof are of no evidence value in this matter as yet. In any case, Eg. sr „hair” has presumably a Sem. cognate, whereas its synonym (below) has not.
Eg. šn > šnw ~ šnj „Haar” (PT-, Wb IV 499-501), whose old equation with Sem. *√ŝ—r „hair”10 is evidently untenable for phonological reasons, may be better affiliated with a set of cognates ultimately deriving from an old PAA stem *Sin-11 „hair” [GT] which is only attested outside Semitic – with diverse C3 root extensions: (1) AA *Sink- [GT] > NOm. *isink- „hair” [GT]: Basketo išinč, Zergula & Zayse isiŋke (NOm. data quoted from Mkr. and Blz.v.s) ||| CCh.: Gude cinkína (ts-) [Str.] = šinkân [Meek] = šiŋkin [Krf.] = šinkin [IL]. (2) AA *SinT- [GT] > NBrb.: Shilh-Sus a-šentūf „hair” [Dst. 1938, 62] = a-šäntuf „chevelure” [Laoust], Senhazha senÏef „arracher (cheveux, poils, alfa)” [Rns. 1932, 350] ||| Bed. šinḍáw (m) „fine head of hair, esp. on young girl” [Roper 1928] ||| CCh.: PHigi *čint- > *šint- „hair”12 [GT] = *√sn [JS]: Fali-Kiria šìnči [Krf.], Higi čenti [Str.], Higi-Ghye šinÏi [Krf.], Higi-Futu čìnši [Krf.], Higi-Nkafa šânti [Meek], HigiKamale čânči [Meek], Higi-Nkafa, -Baza, -Kamale šìnti „hair” [Krf.], Kapsiki šinti [Str. 1922-3, 113].13 Which of these two AA stems is reflected by Eg. šntj „Haar” (Med., Wb IV 518, 12-13) is uncertain. It is clearly an extension of the simplex still and solely14 preserved by Eg. šn, although its -tj was originally not necessarily a dental plosive, but may very well be explained – with the well-known shift of old t > tj in the NK – from an older Eg. *šnt (unattested from the OK and MK), which would be a perfect match of AA *√Snk.
Eg. f— (or f—3)15 ~ f—j (hair det.) „lock of hair” (NE, Pap. Turin 1983, vo. I 47-48, Černý 1958, 210, #6 after I.E.S. Edwards) = „cheveux” (AL 77.1544) = „lock of hair”
10 Suggested by A. Ember (1926, 301-2, n. 10), W. F. Albright (1927, 230), and M. Cohen (1947, 138), but rightly doubted by F. von Calice (GÄSW 206, #852) and C.T. Hodge (1976, 20, #45). 11 Its *S- stands for an unknown sibilant. Eg. š- evidently speaks for an initial lateral fricative or affricate, but the rest of the comparanda from NBrb., NOm. and Ch. seem to derive from some other sibilant (*s- or *č-?), although the data from the latter two subbranches are unfortunately not too helpful in deciding about which sort of the PAA sibilants is to be reconstructed. 12 Rather than **sint- > *šint- via palatalization of the initial sibilant. 13 For the comparison of the AA data see Wölfel 1955, 49 (Eg.-NBrb.); Mukarovsky 1989 MS, 3 (NOm.-CCh.); Blažek 1994 MS Bed., 35 (Bed.-NOm.-CCh.). 14 It is to be noted that CCh.: Bata-Garwa ssĕōnè „Haar” [Str.] cannot belong here as cognate reflecting the same biradical root, since it is to be analyzed via a quite different segmentation < *sew-ne. 15 Can be read either f—3 or f— (group writing). The suggested Afro-Asiatic etymology of the word indicates that the Old Egyptian root was either *f—3 < *f3— (met.) or *f— < *f3— („lost” -3-). I prefer the second scenario.

Eg. d3d3 „Kopf” (OK, Wb V 530-531), whose Coptic reflex (S) jwj is to be deduced from *dád < **dắ3dă3, has long been convincingly19 equated with Sem. *gulgul-(at-) „cranio” [Frz. 1964, 268, #2.43] = *gulgul-at-/*galgal-at- „skull” [Kogan] > Akk. gulgullu ~ gulgullatu „Schädel” [AHW 297] = „1. skull, 2. container shaped like a human skull” [CAD g 127-8] || Hbr. gulgolet (≈ Gk. κρανίον τοπος) „Schädel, Kopf” [GB 139] = „skull” [KB 191] = gulgṓlet „Schädelstätte” [Eilers 1987, 513] (hence Gk.

Aram. glgh [DRS], Syr. gāgoltā „cranium” [Brk. 1928, 103b] | Ar. ğalağ-at- [Kogan: < *ğalğal-at-?]
16 S. Sauneron (1964, 20) pointed out the word for GR, namely in the Abaton Decree, which prohibited to approach the holy place for z nb hr f— „everyone with hair”. Beside this occurrence, Sauneron (1968, 10) proved the phonetic value f of the hair hrgl. in Esna (GR), supposedly created on the basis of the acrophonic principle from LEg. f— „hair”. 17 Attested in Akk. pērtu ~ pēretu “Haupthaar” [AHW 856] = pirtu „Haupthaar” [Holma 1911, 34] = pirtu “Kopfhaar” [Torczyner 1912, 770] || Hbr. pera— „das volle Haupthaar” [GB 660] = „loosely hanging and unplaited hair on the head” [KB] || Ar. far—- „das volle Haupthaar” [GB] = „chevelure” [BK] = „hair of women, shag of hair (космы волос)” [SISAJa] (Sem.: Holma 1911, 34; Frz. 1964, 268, #2.46; SISAJa I, #46; Belova 1992, 16; SED I 192, #218). The inner Semitic etymology (if any) of Sem. *par—- has been debated. Connected to Sem. *√pr— „to grow” [GT] (as suggested in GB 660; Frz. 1964, 268, #2.46; WUS #2277)? Cf. esp. Hbr. √pr— III qal „das Haar wachsen lassen, es nicht stutzen und pflegen” [GB]. S.D. Ricks (1982, 298), in turn, associated Hbr. pera— „hairs of the head” with OSA: Qatabanian fr—-m „top, summit of”, Ar. far—- „top”, fara—a „to excel”. Torczyner (1912, 770) attached Akk. pirtu to Ar. farw-at- „Kopfhaut samt Haaren”. 18 Any connection to Sem.: Ar. —ufr-at- „crinière”, —ifr-at- „cheveux du milieu de la tête” [Belova] ||| ECu.: Dullay-Gollango ufur-kó „Körperhaar” [AMS 1980, 246] as suggested by A.G.

„1. crâne, 2. tête” [BK I 311]20 (Sem.: Holma 1911, 11; DRS 118; SED I 74-75, §79). The exclusively Semito-Egyptian isogloss *√glgl was in fact the reduplication of AA *√gl „head, skull” [GT]. Following the old view expressed frequently both in Sem. and Eg. linguistics (lit. infra), I have examined elsewhere (Takács 1994 and 1998) the etymological connection of the reflexes of Eg.-Sem. *ga/ulga/ul- „head” [GT] with other derivatives of AA *√gl „round” [GT].21
Eg. tp „Kopf, Spitze” (PT-, Wb V 263-8): this synonymous term, interestingly, has again no match in Semitic. On the contrary, its cognate has so far been only found in HECu.: Burji tīp-ṓ „skull” [Sasse 1982, 177] as V. Blažek (1994 MS Elam, 5, #13) correctly suggested. Interestingly, the vocalism in the 1st root syllable of the Eg. word was also *-́ĭ- as Eg. fem. tp.t, i.e. *t́ĭp.ăt > Cpt. (S) Ape (abstraction from *tape, in which initial t- was falsely regarded and isolated in the pre-Coptic fem. form as the fem. definite article) indicates. One might perhaps extend this etymology onto CCh.: Daba t ̧p „to wear a cap” [Brt. 1995, 226].
„Brain”
Eg. 3js [regular < *r–s] „Gehirn” (Med., Wb I 2, 10-11) = „viscera”, 3js n dnn.t „the viscera of the skull, i.e.: brain” (FD 1) ||| Sem. *ra–š- „head” [Frz. 1964, 268, #2.42] = *ra–iš- [Dlg. 1986, 78] = *ra–(i)š- [SED I 198-9, #225]. The Egypto-Semitic match (observed first by O. Rössler 1966, 227 and then C.T. Hodge 1976, 12, #35) is certain, while the presence of the same Afro-Asiatic root in the Chadic daughter languages, as suggested by O.V. Stolbova (1991 MS, 7), seems to me phonologically dubious, cf. CCh. *√rŝ (?) „brain” [GT]: PMandara *γurŝ- (?) [Krf.] > Glavda γùrŝà (-fl-) [Krf.] = rurŝà [Stl.], Nakatsa γərŝa (-fl-) [Krf.], Zeghwana (Dghwede) γùnza [Krf.] | PMafa-Mada (or PMatakam) *haN-liŝ „brains” [Rsg.] = *-riŝ (?) [GT] > Matakam (Mafa) màŋgə»áŝ (-fl-) [Krf.], Mada Énèŝ (-tl) [Rsg.], Muyang àndíŝ [Rsg.], Muktele àríŝ [Rsg.], Moloko èléŝ [Rsg.], Gisiga –eleŝ [Lukas 1970, 117] = léŝ [Rsg.] (CCh.: Rossing 1978, 216, #88; Kraft 1981, #37). The sibilant C3 may well indeed be due to the phenomenon of secondary laterals (i.e. *-s > *-ŝ) so typical in Central Chadic, but the Lautgeschichte of its C2 (perhaps -r- < *-n- due to Central Chadic rhotacism?) and the origin of the Anlaut (r- ~ γ- < *ḥ-, i.e., the well-known root extension occurring in the names of body parts?) are highly questionable. In any case, the Semitic and Egyptian roots are in a fully regular agreement.
Eg. tbn „Gehirn” (Med., Wb V 262, 1) = „bone-marrow” (FD 296) = „Knochenmark” (GHWb 922): its Chadic etymology is not yet fully certain in spite of the multitude of the attractive parallels, which are, however, not necessarily mutually interrelated:
20 Note that the Ar. forms like ğulğul-at- [Holma] and ğalğal-at- [KB] – as Kogan (SED l.c.) rightly remarked – „are not found in the available dictionaries”.
21 As L. Kogan (SED l.c.) too has recently admitted, “Sem. *gll/*glgl ‘to be round’ ... may eventually be the source of Sem. ‘skull’”.

(1) V. Orel and O. Stolbova (1992, 185; HSED #2393) identified Eg. tbn with CCh.: Gabin tìḅìn-de „brains” [Kraft],22 where the final syllable could in principle be taken from *tiḅin-indV (lit. *„brain of head”) via haplology (cf. Gabin indè „head”). The ultimate pre-Central Chadic root might have thus been **√ṭbn → *√tḅn via the metathesis of the glottalization well-known in the Chadic Lautgeschichte. This is how our attention might be grasped by Ar. ṭabana „entendre bien, savoir bien une chose”, ṭabin- „habile, intelligent” [BK II 58], which has a variety in Ar. tabina „2. être intelligent, fin et rusé”, tabin- „habile, intelligent” [BK I 192]. If the above chain of assumptions is right, we have here an exclusive Egypto-Chadic isogloss with a possible verbal root background retained in Arabic. (2) H.G. Mukarovsky (1987, 108) combined the Gabin word with the reflexes of
WCh.: Angas-Sura *tabur ~ *tabuγur ~ *tabuk „brain” [GT 2004, 20] attested both
in Angas and Suroid.23 One would be tempted to assume that *tubuk was originally due to a contraction of a compound *tubun-kā „marrow of head” (cf. Angas-Sura *kā2
„head”). But the difference of the vowels in the 1st vs. 2nd syllables is atypical of original triconsonantal Angas-Sura roots and one has a priori the impression of having to do with a prefix ta- here, which seems to be reaffirmed by the isolated Goemay goebûr [gəbǖr]
„the brain” [Srl. 1937, 62], in which the same stem *-bur (or *buγur) seems to appear, only with a different prefix (gə- < *kə-?).

(3) A noteworthy extra-Afro-Asiatic parallel to Eg. tbn appears in PBantu *-dùbí „brain” [Guthrie 1971, 126, #682]. But whether this is related with the Chadic data is highly unlikely.

Since these parallels reflect merely AA *√ml „temple of head”
30 Several authors (Mukarovsky, Dolgopol’skij, Blažek) extended this comparison also onto CCh.: Fali-Jilbu šìmčìn, Fali-Muchella šìmki, Fali-Bwagira šımkın „hair” | Banana ŝimità, Musey ŝimit „hair” (CCh.: Kraft 1981). They assumed a secondary ŝ- < *š-, which is, in principle, possible. One would be tempted to identify the suffix -k with the C3 root complement of Eg. smk „mit langer Locke (?)” (PT, Wb IV 144, 2). But the cognacy of the CCh. term (of a significantly different vocalism) with Eg. šntj „hair” (above) seems more likely at the moment. 31 Literature for this Afro-Asiatic root comparison: Dolgopolsky 1990, 215; Blažek 1989 MS Om., 15, #47 (MSA-Eg.-Cu.-Ch.); Mukarovsky 1989 MS, 3 (SCu.-NOm.-Ch.); Orel and Stolbova 1992, 170 (NOm.-Eg.-WCh.); Skinner 1992, 350 (WCh.-Cu.-Eg.); Orel 1995, 109, #135 (Ch.-Eg.-Cu.). 32 P. Lacau (1970, 53, #125) explained the phonetic value m3— of the feather hieroglyph (originally „la plume de la tempe”) from Eg. m3— „temple” as related to m3— „côté, bord”. 33 H. Grapow (1954, 29) renders it literally „die Seite des Kopfes” (so also Walker l.c.) assuming it to be etymologically related to Eg. m3— „Ufer des Flußes” (MK, Wb, above). G. Jéquier (1911, 64-65, §23), in turn, followed by P. Lacau (1970, 53-54, §125) proposed a derivation from Eg. m3— „côté, bord”.

[GT] (without any trace of a third radical -—), one is disposed to asssume in Eg. m3— < *ml— an additional root extension *-— of anatomical terms (attested in East Cushitic).
Eg. ssk3 „Schläfe, Locke” (BD, Wb IV 279, 1) has been equated by V. Orel and O. Stolbova (HSED #125) with Sem.: Akk. usukku ~ sukku „Schläfe, Oberteil der Wange” [AHW 1439], which, interestingly, yields a further case of an additional -3 in the Egyptian match for an Afro-Asiatic root denoting the „temple of head” (cf. Eg. gm3 and sm3 above), which one might only render as an additional root extension.
„Ear”
Eg. *jdn „Ohr: nur noch aus der Schreibung der folgenden Worte zu erschließen” (Wb I 154), cf., e.g., jdn „jem. vertreten” (Lit. MK-, Wb I 154, 1) written with an ear determinative/logogram. As J. Zeidler (1984, 43-44, §3.2) pointed out, this ear determinative (EG3 455, F21) appears also in the writing of a number of words spelled jd (Wb I 151-2) without the -n, which led him to „eine teilphonographische Schreibung jd nahelegen” assuming that „das Kuhohr ... hat demzufolge als Phonogramm wohl in erster Linie Lautwert jd (sem. „s), der mit [akk.] uznu ... nichts zu tun hat”. If this were true, one might wonder whether the association of the ear sign with the phonetic value was due to Eg. jdj „taub sein” (OK-, Wb I 151, 13). Unfortunately, however, Zeidler ignored the paper by M. Gilula (1975, 251), where the word jdn „ear” was pointed out as a real word attested in CT VII 30k: jdn ggwj „attentive ear”.34 This suggestion was later corroborated also by W. Vycichl (1985, 172, §1; 1990, 45), C.T. Hodge (1977, 933), and by R. van der Molen (in her DCT 62 referring even to Hbr. –ozen „ear”) etc., who correctly maintain the widely known35 equation with Sem. *–udn- „ear” [Frz. 1964,
255] = *Hədn- [Djk. 1970, 468] = *–úd(O)n- [Dlg. 1982, 36, #1; 1994, 271, #4].36 The correspondence of Eg. d vs. Sem. *d is rare, although attested. Moreover, strangely, also the Ugaritic reflex of this word displays -d- instead of the expected -d-.37 One might also ponder whether Eg. -d- is here due to an influence of Eg. jdj „to be deaf”,38 which,
34 The rendering of jdn gg „attentive ear” is not commonly accepted. R.O. Faulkner (AECT III 18, spell 829), for instance, interprets this place as „he who was deaf (?) and who stared”. P. Barguet (1986, 556, spell 829), in turn, has here „celui qui remplace celui qui regarde (?)”, whereas R. Hannig (ÄWb II 455b) supposed here the occurrence of jdn „vertreten”. 35 Erman 1892, 108 (after Brugsch and Steindorff); Ember 1911, 92; Holma 1911, x; Wb I 154; Albright 1927, 208, fn. 8; ESS §4.a.2 and §26.c.2; GÄSW 51, #128; Cohen 1947, #16; Vycichl 1953, 43; 1953, 112-113; Hodge 1981, 234. Note that N. Skinner’s (1992, 348; 1995, 30) comparanda (namely Brb. *udm „face”, Eg. wšm „ear of grain”, SCu.: Qwadza wat-o „ear” < AA *√wfl/ẑm „ear”) cannot be accepted for phonological reasons. 36 For Sem. cf. e.g. Leslau 1945, 233; Rabin 1975, 87, #21. n. 37 Cf. Ug. –udn „Ohr” [WUS 8, #89] = ủdn „ear” [DUL 20].
38 The etymology of Eg. jdj is still obscure – unless it directly originates (via semantic opposition) from AA *√wÏ „to hear” [GT]. A.B. Dolgopol’skij (1966, 70, #5.7) rightly found its equation with Agaw *ded- „deaf” [GT] || ECu. *dūd- „dumb, deaf” [Sasse 1982, 58-59] little convincing as he regarded PCu. *√dd as an onomatopoetic root. Equally untenable is P. Lacau’s (1954, 300, n. 1) direct derivation from Eg. *jdn via the erosion of its final -n:



LAYERS OF THE OLDEST EGYPTIAN LEXICON I 95
besides, C.T. Hodge (1976, 12, #37) even directly affiliated with the Eg.-Sem. isogloss *√–dn for „ear”, outside which no evident cognates are found with this triliteral root structure.39 The Russian scholars, headed by I.M. Diakonoff (1981, 27, fn. 9; 1986, 47), and their followers40 isolated the third radical in Eg. and Sem. as a nomen instr./loci attached to an AA root *√wÏ „to hear”. Also A.B. Dolgopolsky (1994, 271, #4) speaks of a „nominal suffix” here. This supposition has, however, no evidence on the Egyptian side.
Eg. msdr „Ohr” (PT, Wb II 154, 13-16): its derivation as the m- prefix nomen loci form of Eg. sdr „die Nacht zubringen, schlafen, liegen” (PT, Wb IV 390-2) has been widely accepted.41 This view has been expressed by most of the authors in the field of Eg. linguistics.42 The alternative comparison of Eg. msdr with common Brb. *√mẓg „ear” [GT] (first established by Rochemonteix) is almost as old as its derivation from Eg. sdr and has also been maintained by numerous specialists.43 Accepting the Brb. parallel of Eg. msdr, Ch. Rabin surmised the Eg. final -r to be an additional element that „occurs occasionally in HS as a suffix, cf. Hbr. -l”. But no such suffix -r has otherwise been observed in Egyptian – to the best of my knowledge. Another way of explaining the 4th Eg. -r would be assuming a secondary popular etymology of the Middle Kingdom: our word was still written in the Old Kingdom solely as msd, which was perhaps no longer
„il passe à –í ou î qui ne s’est conservé que dans jdj ‘être sourd’; l’infirmité exprimée par le radical du membre infirme”.
39 W.W. Müller (1975, 64, #5), followed by A. Militarev and O. Stolbova (1990, 66) and HSED #126, compared the Sem. word with WCh.: Karekare ḍéŋgei || ECh.: Jegu –údúŋê „Ohr”. But the ECh. comparanda are not even with one another interrelated. On the one hand, Mubi-Toram *–uduŋ- „ear” [GT] > Jegu –údúŋê, pl. –ùdáŋ „Ohr” [Jng. 1961, 117], Birgit –údúŋgì (f), pl. –údúŋgà [Jng. 2004, 359] might well be in fact a late Ar. borrowing, whereas, on the other hand, H. Jungraithmayr and D. Ibriszimow (1994 I 53C) were disposed to compare ECh.: Dangla ḍéŋgei, ḍeŋgíŋko [Lks.] = ḍéngé [Fédry] (ECh. data: JI 1994 II 115) with PCu. *sVg(g)- „to hear” [Dlg. 1973]. 40 I.M. Diakonoff (1981, 27, fn. 9; 1984, 7), A. Militarev and O. Stolbova (1990, 66), V. Orel and Stolbova (1992, 170), Dolgopolsky (1973, 187-8, 301; 1994, 271, #4), followed by V. Blažek (1989 MS, 11, #28) and C.T. Hodge (1990, 647, #23.C), assumed an etymological connection to Cu.-Om. *waÏ(i)- [Djk.] = *wVÏ[Ï]- [Dlg. 1973, 187-8, 301] > Agaw *was- „to hear” [Apl. 1984, 44] ||| NOm. *wayz-/*Hwayz- „ear” [Blz.] = *–wāÎ- [OS] = *wayÏ- [Dlg.]. Note that neither F. Hintze’s (1951, 77) PCu.-Om. *was- nor M.L. Bender’s (1988, 146) Om. *way „ear” can be accepted regarding the fact that the Omotic reflexes are indicating an *-Ï-.
41 The original sense of Eg. msdr has been rendered as „la partie de la tête sur laquelle on s’appuie pour dormir” (Lacau) = „endroit où l’on dort” (Vycichl: „it is on the ear that one sleeps”) = „место, на котором спят” (Ol’derogge) = „l’endroit sur lequel on dort” (Vergote) = „Stelle bzw.

understood as something resembling a noun deducable from a „native” triconsonantal verbal root, while the derivation from Eg. sdr „to lie (down)” was maybe at hand and this commonly conceivable reinterpretation led to a new form msdr. If the underlying PBrb. root contained *-g as supposed by M. Cohen, C. Brockelmann, P. Lacau, and A.Ju. Militarev (cf. below),44 the equation of this hypothetic OEg. *msd and PBrb. *√mẓg might be in principle established by the shift of AA *c/ ̃/∫- + *g > pre-Eg. *s- + *-g- > Eg. s- + -d- (loss of glottalization due to incompatibility, cf. EDE I 327-9). Does the Eg.Brb. isogloss represent the nomen instrumenti of PAA * ̃ug- „to hear” [Mlt.] = *√ ̃g [GT]?
Eg. —nḫ.wj „die zwei Ohren (als Körperteil des Menschen)” (MK, Wb I 204-5): its root, √—nḫ (which has no reasonable verbal source in Eg.)45 may well be derived from AA *√—Q ~ *√—nQ (with an epenthetic nasal) „to listen, hear” [GT], which is only attested in Cushitic46 and Chadic47, but – again – not in Semitic. The Eg.-Cu. (sine SCu.) etymology has been known since the article by E.

equation with Sem. *—ayn- „eye”49 has widely been accepted,50 whereas this Eg.-Sem. word as a noun has only dubious attestation outside Sem.-Eg. Quite a lot of scholars51 preferred to equate the Eg.-Sem. isogloss with LECu.: i.a.

The ECh. forms, however, may well be due to an Arabic influence, whereas the reconstruction and external etymology of the Chadic word are hardly supporting any connection to Eg.-Sem. *—ayn-.53 The suggestion by O.V.

been divided in two groups concerning its origin, although, phonologically, neither of these solutions is perfectly satisfying: (1) As a noun, it could be prima vista neatly identified with NBrb. *allen, the pl. of sg. *tiṭṭ [< **t-il-t?] „eye” [Zhl.]57 ||| Agaw *—əll- „eye” [Dlg. pace Apl. 1984, 57] = *[—]íl- [Apl. 1991, 20, 23] || ECu. *–il- „eye” and denom. *–ilāl- „to look at” [Sasse 1979, 5, 22, 1982, 104-5] || SCu. *–ila „eye” and (denom.?) *–iley- „to know” [Ehret 1980, 291-2].58 Here, however attractive this comparison may seem, neither of the root consonants in fact corresponds: Eg. j- (here, „real” *y-) ≠ AA *–-, whereas Eg. -r- (here, in fact, „real” *-r-) ≠ AA *-l-. (2) As a verbal root of dubious existence, the supposedly underlying Eg. *jrj „sehen”59 might be affiliated with Bed. iray „wissen, erfahren” [Rn. 1895, 30] || ECu.: Dullay *–ar„to know” [Orel] || SCu. *–ar- „to (fore)see” [Ehret 1980, 286] ||| NOm. *ar- „to know” [Bender 1988, 147] (Cu.-Om.: Fleming 1969, 22, Dlg. 1973, 170-1; Bender 1988, 155; Zaborski 1989, 587-8; HSED #75; Orel 1995, 119). This etymology, however, does not take into account that Eg. j- is reflecting here a „real” *y-, not a glottal stop as the Coptic reflexes evidently indicate. Many authors are inclined to equate Eg. jr.t with Sem. *√r–y (met.?) „to see”.60 Equally ambiguous is others’ suggestion to affiliate Eg. jr.t with some sporadic Chadic forms for „eye” like ir (and sim.).61 Some authors even confused these diverse roots.62

→ Cpt. (SB) bal, (ALFO) bel „eye” (CD 31b; CED 22; KHW 22): in this case, the word for „eye” apparently developed semantically pars pro toto from a basic sense „ball”, so it is presumably to be regarded as an inner Egyptian innovation. This is why the resemblance of Eg. br „sehen, erblicken” (GR, Wb I 465, 6), evidently a denominal derivative from the same root, to the reflexes of AA *√bl „to look at” [GT],64 with which the GR word has been usually equated,65 may be due to pure chance. The same may well pertain to Meroitic *bel „eye” [Zhl. 1956, 25].66 In any case, our Eg. word may have been a native innovation and not an inherited item of the common Eg.-Sem. anatomical terminology.
Eg. mr.t „Auge (einer Gottheit)”, dual mr.tj „die beiden Augen” (BD 1x, GR frequently, Wb II 107, 10-15) = „l’oeil (du dieu)”, dual „les deux yeux” (Lefébvre 1952, 16, §17; El-Sayed 1987, 64) = „Auge des Königs” (Edfu, Kurth 1994, 13, §52).67 W. Helck (1954, 76-77), followed by A. Volten (1959, 27), demonstrated the early existence of the word attested by an unusual writing (m + two eye signs) of the title mr „Vorsteher” (Wb) from Dyn. III on. If this is correct, we have here the fourth old Egyptian term for „eye”. Etymology disputed: (1) In the view of W. Vycichl (1951, 72) and G. Takács (1995, 159), this is ultimately cognate with Eg. m33 „to see” (with an interchange of 3 ~ r). Cf. also LEg. m3.tj dual. „die Augen (Sonne und Mond als Augen des Himmels)” (LP, Wb II 11). (2) P. Lacau (1970, 150, §406) derived it via m- prefix from Eg. jr.t „eye”, which was approved by W.A. Ward (1978, 144-6, §287): „attractive suggestion and would strengthen the idea of a late dialectal variant” (specific for the Ptolemaic lexicon). Unconvincing. None of the functions of m- seems to fit here. (3) W. Westendorf (KHW 22) and W. Guglielmi (1991, 16 & fn. 92 with lit.) suggested a connection between Eg. mr.t ~ OEg. b33 > NEg. bnr > GR br.wj (dual) „eye(ball)”,
the trace of an OEg. *b3.t „eye” in the toponym of modern Ar. Hurbeyṭ < Cpt. (B) Varbait < Φαρβαιθος < LEg. *p3-ḥr-b3.tj [*p-ḥar-baitĕj/*-bi3taj] „Horus mit den beiden Augen”. More recently, however, A. Czapkiewicz (1971, 20, #23) rendered Hurbeyṭ as *pr-ḥr-j3btj „the eastern residence of Horus”. Others derived Ar. Horbeit ~ Horbēt from the Eg. toponym pr-ḥr-mr.tj, lit. „Haus des Horus der beiden Augen” (KHW 479; PL 446). G. Roeder (ZÄS 61, 1926, 58) was sceptical about this derivation (esp. as for LEg. ḥ- > Ar. h- and Gk. -βαιθ- < Eg. mr.tj), but K.

„Nose”
Eg. fnd „Nase” (OK, Wb I 577, 10-15): its etymology has not yet been unambiguously settled. In any case, most probable seems a Semitic connection (solution 1 below): (1) It has often been equated with ES: Amharic and Argobba afən ̃a „nose”, Tigrinya –âfən ̃a „nose” (ES: Leslau 1949, 48).68 Phonologically, it would be plausible, but the etymology of the Ethio-Semitic word is also heavily debated.69 (2) Frequently affiliated70 also with the derivatives of AA *√fn (perhaps *fun-) „nose” [GT]71 and the underlying verbal root, PAA *√fn „1. to blow, breathe, 2. smell” [GT],72

„hand” [GT] (cf. below), whereas its *-z- is a regular correspondence of Eg. š- < AA *Ŝ- (Militarev 1991).79 All other attempts at solving the etymology of Eg. šr.t have remained vain.80
„Tooth”
Eg. jbḥ „Zahn, besonders des Menschen, auch der Tiere, sogar Stoßzahn des Elefanten” (OK, Wb I 64, 2-4) > (S) obhe „orig. Schneidezahn (?)” (KHW 137, fn. 7): origin obscure, all attempts until now have remained unconvincing.81 I only can put forward two weak, albeit plausible approaches: (1) On the one hand, a basic meaning „white” and an etymological connection with Sem. *ḥalab- „milk” [Lsl. 1987, 229] are in principle not to be ruled out. (2) One the other hand, the final -ḥ is suspicious as it used to occur in body parts’ names (Takács 1997). But I have been so far unable to find any external match for *jb „tooth”, which signifies the little chances of a non-Semitic etymology.

79 It is to be distinguished from WBrb.: Zenaga u-nžer “se moucher” [Bst. 1909, 247] < Brb. *√nsr “se moucher” [GT] ||| ECh.: Mubi ŋèsér “(se) moucher” [Jng. 1990 MS], distinct from Brb. *√nzr. The former might perhaps correspond to Eg. nz3 “to blow out (of one’s nose)” (CT III 100d, AECT I 159), which, however, R. van der Molen (DCT 245) considered to be merely a false writing for nf3. 80 W.F. Albright (1918, 239) and A. Ember (ESS §12.a.39, cf. GÄSW 208, #860) combined Eg. šr.t with Ar. ḫarra „to snore” and also nuḫr-at- „snout, tip of nose”, while N. Skinner (1992, 353) did it directly with Sem. *naḫir- „nostril”, cf. Akk. naḫēru „nostril”, Hbr. n‹-irayim „nostrils”, Syr. nəḥīrā „nose” (Sem.: Leslau 1945, 236; 1969, 21; Rabin 1975, 88, #62). The correspondence of Eg. š vs. Sem. ḫ is, however, only admitted in the Rösslerian theory, not in the traditional system of the Egypto-Semitic comparison. C.T. Hodge (1961, 36), in turn, combined the Eg. noun with NOm.: Mocha šiṭ-ó „nose”, although Eg. -r- = Mocha -ṭ- has not been demonstrated. V. Orel and O. Stolbova (1992, 186) equated Eg. šr.t with their CCh. *cir- „nose”, where, however, the ultimate Chadic root contained an *-n- (hence -r- in CCh. via rhotacism). 81 A. Ember (ESS §4.f.11) figured a primary sense „chewer” on the one hand, but simultaneously (!), he affiliated it with Ar. labaḥa „vieillir, être très-âgé (se dit d’un homme)” [BK II 956] and even NAgaw forms like Qwara labak-ā, Bilin labak-á „heart”, on the other hand. Naturally, all this cannot be valid at the same time. His idea on the relationship of Hbr. šēn and Ar. sinn- „tooth” vs. Ar. san-at- „year”, Hbr. √yšn and Ar. wasina (also wašina) „to sleep, be putrfying (of water)”, primarily „to become old, stale”, is however, noteworthy just like his argument that „the age of someone is determined by the teeth”. His apprentice, W.F. Albright added here Ar. laḥaba „stricken in years” (sic) recorded in fact as laḥiba „être très-maigre, amaigri de vieillesse” [BK II 971]. F. von Calice (GÄSW 116, #489) regarded Ember’s idea on the etymological „tooth” vs. „old” „unwahrscheinlich”, because, in his view, „die Begriffsverwandtschaft von ‘Zahn’ und ‘Alter, aetas’ ist unbekannt”. He rightly pointed to that the Agaw words belong to Eg. jb „heart”. C.T. Hodge (1992, 202-206), in turn, assumed an unattested Eg. *j3bḥ akin to 3b.w „tusk, ivory”, *3b (attested 3b.t) „chisel”, and 3b „fingernail”, extended with a suffix -ḥ.



LAYERS OF THE OLDEST EGYPTIAN LEXICON I 103
here too, even after deleting the phonologically evidently false ones,82 one is disturbed by the multitude of the diverse and quite attractive equipotential etymological proposals: (1) A. Ember (1921, 177; 1926, 302, fn. 10; ESS §24.b.3), whose suggestion was quoted in GÄSW 169, #685 with doubt, identified it with Ar. naḥaḍa „to sharpen (a lance), loosen (flesh from bone)”, naḥīḍ- „sharp, pointed (spear-head)” [Ember] = naḥaḍa I „3. rendre mince et effilé (le fer d’une lance, etc.)”, naḥīḍ- „effilé, rendu mince, réduit dans sa largeur (fer d’une lance, etc.)”.83 (2) I. Teitelbaum (quoted and approved by C.H. Gordon 1955, 294, #1206) associated it with Ug. ngḥ N „mit Hörnern stossen” [Aistleitner 1948, 211] = „to gore” [Gordon] = „aneinanderstossen” [WUS #1745], Hbr. √ngḥ qal „stossen (v. gehörnten Tieren)”, piel „stossen (m. d. Hörnern)” [GB 483],84 which is possible as Eg. *√ndḥ may indeed derive from AA *√ngḥ. (3) E. Edel (AÄG xxxix, lxiv, §256.A), followed by G. Fecht (1960, §374), J. Vergote (1973 Ib, 156), J. Osing (NBÄ 211), and W. Westendorf (KHW 137, fn. 8; LÄ VI 1319) saw in it an n-Bildung from Eg. ḥd „white”. Most of them also supposed a deverbal origin, namely from a lost Eg. *nḥd verb Iae n-, which was opposed by J. Osing (NBÄ 748-9, n. 908) arguing that there is no reason to assume *√nḥd. Th Bardinet (1990, 43-44, 279), in turn, reconstructed *nj-ḥd.t „la blanche” (sic, etymological rendering not given) supported by late puns. (4) A.Ju. Militarev (MM 1983, 228-229) too surmised here an n- prefix formation comparing it with Sem. *ḥVÀ- „arrow” [Mlt.], PCu. *HV ̃- „ocтpиe” [Dlg. 1973, 303-4], and WCh. *hwaCV „tooth” [Stl.]. (5) S. Cauville (1987, 183) equally applied a prefix n-, but she affiliated the word for „tooth” with Eg. pḥd „couper, séparer” derived by her (via an alleged p- prefix!) from Eg. ḥd (sic, in fact a verb IIIae inf.) „détruire”. (6) V. Orel and O. Stolbova (HSED #1235) combined it with PRift *ḥunĉ- „to chew” [Ehret 1980, 302] via metathesis and explained both from their AA *ḥanV∫-. This is the most tempting Afro-Asiatic etymology that has been so far offered. (7) GT: or perhaps related to Sem. *nṣḥ „to shine” [Leslau 1969, 60; KB 716] ||| NOm.: Kefoid (PGonga) *ne ̃ ̃-/*nē ̃- „white” [GT]: Bworo nec-a (-ts’-), Beke neč-o, Anfillo nēc-o (-ts’-), Bosha ne ̃-/ne ̃ ̃-o, Kaffa na ̃ ̃-o, Mocha ne ̃ ̃-o (Crl. 1951, 478; Fleming 1987, 148, #5)? E. Cerulli (l.c.) supposed the Kaffa to have been the source of
82 L. Reinisch (1895, 180) and E. Zyhlarz (1932-33, 169; 1934, 59) equated Eg. ndḥ.t with Bed. nad „Zahn” [Rn.], which was apparently supported by F. von Calice (GÄSW 169, #685) and reaffirmed by M. Cohen (1947, 186, #449), although it is clearly wrong (because Bed. d has nothing to do with Eg. d) as it has been pointed out already W. Vycichl (1960, 262). On the other hand, C.T. Hodge (1969, 108, #8) affiliated the Egyptian term with Sem.: Ar. naṭaḥa „to butt” (phonologically false, since Sem. *-ṭ- ≠ Eg. -d-) and LECu.: Somali ḍԧḥ „marrow” [Abr.] (semantically baseless). Later Hodge (1992, 205-6) derived Eg. ndḥ.t from Eg. nd „grind” with an affix -ḥ. 83 Ch. Ehret (1995, 330, #644) extended this Arabo-Egyptian match to Ar. √nḥt „to shave, plane, scratch, saw off, carve wood or stone” ||| ECu. *ñi/uḥ- „to shape to a point” ||| WCh. *ñaw „horn”, all these derived by him from his AA *-ñiḥ- „to shape to a point”. Baseless. 84 Strangely, A. Guillaume (1965 IV 16) equated Hbr. √ngḥ with Ar. naṭaḥa „to butt” (!), which is phonologically unacceptable.

Amh. nä ̃ (henceforth, not root inherited from Semitic), whereas W. Leslau (l.c.), on the contrary, supposed in Kafa and other Kefoid reflexes too an Amharic borrowing. (8) GT: since our term suspiciously has no cognates meaning „tooth” on Afro-Asiatic grounds, it is impossible not to take ESudanic *ñig-t- „tooth” [Bnd. 2005, 31, #59] and thus also Nilo-Saharan *nī ̆kh „tooth” [Ehret 2001, 317, #267] into account as extra-AfroAsiatic areal parallels with regard to their strikingly identical root vocalism. The Coptic data suggest an Eg. *ńĭḥd. ̆t > *ńĭ—d. ̆t (Edel, Vergote, Osing). I.e., we may project a pre-OEg. *níg-ḥ.at carrying the marker *-ḥ- of the nominal class of anatomical terms (Takács 1997). Acually, this scenario seems most convincing at the moment, i.e., we may have here a non-Afro-Asiatic word.
Eg. tz „Zahn” (MK-, Wb V 401, 1), fem. tz.t „Zahn” (XVIII., Wb V 409, 9-12): here we have a large scale of Afro-Asiatic nominal root varieties for „tooth” that are phonologically to be distinguished even if ultimately they may be perhaps interrelated (and are henceforth frequently compared in the literature including Eg. tz):85 (1) AA *√ks [GT] > WBrb.: Zenaga ūkš ~ ukši, pl. ūkš-ən „dent (canine)” [Ncl. 1953, 96, 335] ||| Bed. kōs „Horn, Zahn” [Rn. 1895, 148] || SCu.: Qwadza ko–os-iko „molar tooth” [Ehret 1980, 264].

As for the verbal background of these varieties, one of them really has it, cf. Sem. *√-ksus- „masticare” [Frz. 1971, 631, #7.20] = *√kc „жeвaть, гpызть, кpoшить зyбaми” [Blv. 1993, 39, #121] > i.a.

regard to Sem. *√kss, especially noteworthy is the OEg. hapax tss written with the same tusk determinative that is used also with Eg. jbḥ and nḥd.t „tooth” (EG1 454, F18). This obscure and otherwise unknown verbal root only occurs in PT 118a „in Verbindung mit šnb.t ‘Brust’ von Personen” (Wb V 410, 10), which R.O. Faulkner ventured to render (as a pure „guess”) as „to tear (breast)” (AEPT 330).88 It was G. Roquet (1984, 367) who has already surmised that PT tss – albeit under a quite different translation not really compatible with the tusk determinative89 – is probably be related with Eg. tz.t. All this might only be possible if Eg. tz.t from the New Kingdom does not reflect the historical writing of the word, which has unfortunately not yet been attested from the Old Kingdom. It is to be noted here that A.G. Belova (1989, 13), in turn, equated NK tz.t with a modern dialectal Ar. √kzz „cжимaть, cтиcкивaть зyбы, cкpeжeтaть зyбaми”. My suggestion for PT tss would be „to picken”, which – along with the tusk sign – would be well understandable from a hypothetic Eg. *tss „to bite” or the like.

G.

This line of thoughts resulted a rendering „qu’exalté soit le coeur des [rapaces] au jabot durci”, The text continues as —m-n=sn jr.t ḥr.w „parce qu’ils ont avalé l’Oeil d'Horus ...” and Roquet was thinking here of „la voracité des prédateurs entraînant la dilatatio croissante de leur gésier ou de leur jabot ..., qui devient alors de plus en plus ferme et dur du fait de la saturation”.
89 He forced a derivation of the PT form (recognized by him as t(-)ss.w „participe passif masculin pluriel”) from his hypothetic Eg. tjs „1. rendre compact, consistent, coalescent, homogène, 2. (se) solidifier, (s’)affermir, (se) durcir, (s’)épaisser, prendre de la cohésion, former une masse uniforme”, hence specially „(en boulangerie) fra(i) ser une pâte”, which, however, has little in common with the tusk determinative in spite of Roquet’s ex cathedra statement that „le signe F18 ... semble retenu ici en fonction de symbole de ce qui est ‘dur, résistant’ ...”
90 A. Roccati (1988, 118) attributes a value *nis (i.e., njs) to the tongue hieroglyph on the basis of the phonogrammatical plene writing njs in PT 383 with a complement -j- (cf. Wb II 324, 12) and also because of the application of the tongue sign in the writing of nj-sw „he belongs to” (Wb II 197, 4).

1990, 90, #48a; Mlt. 2005]. A widely know (almost) common Afro-Asiatic root with abundant literature.91 The question to be addressed here is whether the Egyptian term was of Semitic etymology. Convinced of that this was the case, W.A. Ward (1972, 20, §155-159) forced a far-fetched theory that „it seems better to assume that the final -n has dropped out in Egyptian and Berber rather tham that it has been added in Semitic”. But it is quite obvious that the Semitic triliteral stem is due to an innovation, while the Berber and Chadic reflexes as well as Egyptian have retained the older biliteral root. There is a communis opinio on that the final Sem. *-ān- was not part of the original root.92 All this implies that Eg. *lís cannot be rendered as coming directly from Semitic.
Eg. sn.w „Zunge” (GR, Wb IV 155, 15) = „tongue” (PL 854): as – among others P. Wilson (PL 854) concludes (quite naturally), it may well be the late metathesis of Eg. ns, but this supposition seems to be disproven by Eg. snk „Bez. für die Zunge (mit der die göttliche Kuh Hathor das Königskind leckt)” (XVIII., Wb IV 177, 1), which may be an extended form of a much earlier Eg. *sn „tongue”. Moreover, both Eg. sn and snk, as pointed out by V. Orel and O. Stolbova (HSED #2248), may be akin to SAgaw *caŋ- < **cank- (?) „tongue” [GT]93 ||| WCh.: NBauchi *s/šə/iŋḳ- „tongue” [Skn. 1977, 45] = *sinaḳA [Stl. 1987, 253] = *šin-(ḍ/k)- [Skn. 1987, 81] > i.a.

94 Namely C. Ebert (1978, 50); C. Gouffé (1971-2, 105, §1); H. Jungraithmayr and K. Shimizu (1981, 272A); H. Jungraithmayr and D. Ibriszimow (1994 I 169). 95 Attested (pace Spiegel l.c.) in nt-bs „Flammenzunge” (PT 396c) and supposedly also in the divine name ḥr.wḥr-nt=f (PT 1088b-c, Wb II 357, 9). Reluctant to accept it as a distinct lexeme on its own, K. Sethe (ÜKAPT VI 145) tried to render it as a „Nebenform zu” (!) Eg. ns „Zunge” (phonologically impossible) or ntt „die Fesselnde”. L.H. Lesko (1972, 110, 111, n. j) rendered nt in CT VII 422b-c too as „tongue” referring to PT 1088c, which was objected by R.O. Faulkner (AECT III 158, spell 1101, n. 5) as no tongue determinative is used in the CT exx.: „my impression is that 422b-c is quite corrupt”. R. van der Molen (DCT 256) too saw in these CT instances just a variety of ntnt „secretion, saliva”. Similarly, D. Meeks (2005, 248, #669a) viewed that the writing in CT VII 422b and 435c „déterminé par la bouche qui crache suggère plutôt ‘sécréstion, crachet’. La référence à PT 396c est sans doute à comprendre ntb=s comme dans CT VI 270e”. Also B. Backes (2005, 395, 456) gives for CT VII (Zweiwegebuch) nt „Gewölle (?), das Ausgespuckte”. 96 Misquoted as Tsamay laeke by N. Skinner (1987, 81). 97 H. Jungraithmayr and D. Ibriszimow (1994 I 169), in turn, suppose that the West Chadic root (referred to by them as ly-g forms) stems from Benue-Congo *-lake (De Wolff), which is hardly probable in the light of the Afro-Asiatic cognates. 98 Cf. Geji leka, Zul and Booluu (Migang) lÚka, Zaranda lÚgà, Zeem ləgə, Tule, Chaari, and Dokshi lyaaga (SBauchi: Smz. 1978, 32, #50). 99 Attested in Glavda árəḫà [Rapp] = έrεḫa [Büchner], Guduf ÒṛÚḫÚ [IL] = Òrḫè [Wolff 1971, 70, #20], Gava rəḫε [Büchner], Yaghwatadaxa rəḫə [Wolff], Dghwede (Truade) rέḫὲ [Frick 1976 MS, 1, #9] = rÒḫè [Frick in JI] = áṛḫài [IL] = rəḫə [Büchner], Gvoko έrəḫε [Büchner], Ngwshe ṛúḫì [IL] = έrεḫa [Büchner], Bokwa árεḫε [Büchner] (Mandara: Büchner 1964, 43-44). Searching for possible cognates of this CCh. root, C. Gouffé (1971-2, 106, #3) suggested either Ch. *√ns „tongue” or „rather” Sem. *√lḳḳ, *√lḥk, *√lḥš „to lick” and even Brb. (sic) əlləγ „to lick” and LECu.: Oromo lagā „language”. Naturally, all these forms may not be interrelated but preserve diverse AA roots. 100 As O. Stolbova (2005, 59-60, #152) insisted. In order to derive both the West (with *l-) and the Central Chadic (*n- and C2 < *-ḫ-/*-k-?) forms, she created an artificial PCh. *n-lV[ḫ]-k- „tongue”. By the way, Stolbova’s derivation of ECh.: Toram liho „tongue” [Alio] from the same root is a rude error as this is merely a reflex of Ch. *lis- with a regular shift of *-s- > -h-.



108 GÁBOR TAKÁCS
Chadic root variety *√nk „tongue” [GT]. It cannot be decided which variety the Eg. word is directly cognate with. L. Reinisch (1884, 386; 1887, 257) and H.G. Mukarovsky (1987, 28 and 266) combined the Chadic root with Sem.: Ar. laqlaq- „langue” [BK II 1016]101 ||| NAgaw *lanq- „tongue” [Apl. 1991, 20] || LECu.: Oromo lag-á „Zunge” [Rn.]102 (which seems to be isolated in ECu.).103
„Lung”
Eg. zm3 „Lunge” (PT-, Wb III 445-446)104 was correctly equated by C.T. Hodge (1990, 646, §15.B) with Sem. *√zmr „to blow, make music” [Hodge],105 among whose reflexes especially noteworthy are Ar. zamara „jouer de l’instrument à vent appelé zammār-at-, remplir une outre, crier etc.”, zammār-at- „espèce de flûte composée de deux tuyaux, sorte de collier en bois” [BK I 1010] = zamara „souffler dans un roseau, jouer de la flûte”, zammār-at- „espèce de flûte” [DRS] = „to pipe, play upon a reed, blow in a mizmār- (a musical reed or pipe, now called flute)” [Lane 1250] = zamara „embouche (cor, trompette), chanter, gronder, remplir une outre” [Dozy I 602] (Sem.: DRS 751).106 In addition, Hispanian Ar. zummāra „gosier, panse des ruminants” as well as zamara „remplir une outre” [DRS] represent one step even further than „flute”107 does on the way towards how the sense „lung” developed in Egyptian.
101 Ch. Ehret (1989, 180-1, #50) reconstructed Ar. biconsonantal *√lq- “to lap” on the basis of √lqq “to lick, lap” √lqlq “to move the jaws tremulously and put out the tongue (snake), smack with the tongue” etc. 102 Oromo g can only derive from ECu. *g, but not from *k or *ḳ (Sasse 1979, 55). This is why it cannot be directly identified with WCh. *√lk „tongue”. 103 Note that SCu.: Dahalo lúga „language” [Eld. 1973 MS, 3, #138; EEN 1989, 43] is a borrowed from Swahili. 104 Its old equation (proposed in Holma 1919, 43 and GÄSW 191, #778) with Sem.: Akk. (jB) šammāḫu „Dickdarm” [AHW 1156] (misquoted in these works as šamaḫḫu „Magen”) and Geez səmāḫ ~ səmāḥ „spleen” [Lsl.] is certainly excluded. F. von Calice (GÄSW l.c.) is right that „man könnte Erweichung v. zm3 < *sm3 annehmen, doch bliebe der Wandel des ḫ → 3 auffällig”. Moreover, Akk./Sem. š- is simply ≠ Eg. z- (only Akk./Sem. s- vs. Eg. z- is attested). The Akk. word is in the AHW l.c. treated as a Sumerian loan (uzušà-maḫ, lit. „big entrail”), while the Geez one has been affiliated by L. Reinisch (1887, 308) rather with Agaw: Bilin zanqi ~ sanqi „liver”, although recently L. Kogan (SED I 217-8, #247) sides with the cognacy of the Akk.-Eth. parallel acknowledging that, „in any case, the coincidence of apparently independent Sem. ... and Sum. terms is fascinating”. P. Lacau (1970, 94-95, §246), in turn, explained Eg. zm3 internally from the homoradical verb zm3 „to unite” as „le poumon est le type bien net de l’organe composé de deux parties identiques, les deux poumons”. Alternatively, he was pondering „si le nom de l’organe vient du verbe dénominatif: —lier comme sont liés les deux poumons». Presque tous les organes du corps ont engendré des verbes dénominatifs.”
105 The Semitic root has been usually combined rather with Eg. zb3 “Flöte blasen” (OK-, Wb III 433), see Ember 1913, 111, #9; GÄSW 1936, #291; Vergote 1945, 129; Vycichl 1958, 371; DRS 572. 106 Ar. zamr- quoted by F. von Calice (GÄSW l.c.) and W. Vycichl (l.c.) with the sense „Flöte” has been in fact attested as „chalumeau, flageolet, hautbois, trompette” [Dozy I 602]. In other lexicons of Classical Arabic it occurs solely as „chant” [BK I]. 107 SCu. *Îumar- [GT]: Ma’a izumarí „flute” [Ehret 1980, 201, #6] may be either a borrowing from Arabic or a cognate ultimately deriving from AA *√Îmr „to blow (a flute)” [GT]. By the way, Ch. Ehret (l.c.) identified the Ma’a word with ERift: Qwadza cemaliko (ts-) „straw” to reconstruct a common SCu. *ncōmari „straw”,



LAYERS OF THE OLDEST EGYPTIAN LEXICON I 109
Eg. wf3 „Lunge” (BD, Wb I 306, 3): following Belova’s Law (cf. EDE I 394-400), we may safely presume Eg. wf3 to have originated in AA *ful-, i.e. w- was part of the original biconsonantal root reflecting the ultimate AA root vowel *-u-,108 which is now corroborated by cognates like WCh.: Angas-Sura *folok ~ *felek → *fəlok (or perhaps *fw-?)109 „lung” [GT 2004, 109]110 | Bokkos fòlòk „Lunge” [Jng. 1970, 141] || CCh.: Bachama fàfulàwεy „lungs” [Krf.]. The underlying AA *ful-/*fwal- „lung” [GT],111 which finds an areal parallel in PWNigritic *phul-, *-phulphul- „lungs” [Smz. 1981, 16, #70], may eventually have been derived from AA *√fwl „to blow” [GT].112
but this is both semantically („straw” ≠ „flute”) and phonologically (Ma’a z- = Qwadza Î-, Takács 2011, 121) problematic. 108 P. Lacau (1970, 95, #248), however, supposed in it a w- prefix (Lacau: “suffixe formant les instrumentaux”) derivation from an unattested *f3, whose „nifal” stem he figured in Eg. nf3 [reg. < *nfr] „ausniesen, (aus)schnauben” (CT, Wb II 252, 3; Osing 1986, 209, n. a) = „respirer, souffler” (Lacau 1972, 36, §43, #5) = „expirer, expulser (du nez)” (Cannuyer 1983, 26) = „to blow, exhale” (DCT 222). But, unfortunately, Lacau ignored the external evidence, cf. Sem.: JNAram. npr „to blow the nose” [Sabar 2002, 234] ||| NBrb. *√nfr „to exhale” [GT]: Nefusa e-nfer „se moucher” [Mtl. 1904, 138] | Tamazight (Zemmur) nfer „se moucher”, a-nfur, pl. a-nfur-n „1. (gros) nez, 2. narine” [Taifi 1991, 473] | Qabyle neffeṛ „1. exhaler, expirer, souffler (l’air, fumée, vapeur), 2. fumer” [Dlt. 1982, 551] || SBrb.: Ahaggar e-nfer [Fcd. 1951-2, 1319-21], ETawllemmet & Ayr ə-nfər „renâcler (cheval, âne, chèvre, personne)”, nəfərnəfər „1. ronfler longuement par le nez (personne, animal), renâcler, s’ébrouer, frémir, expulser l’air avec bruit, 2. inspirer l’air avec bruit par le nez” [PAM 2003, 595-6], which suggest an AA *√nfr „to blow the nose” [GT], a fully distinct origin with initial *n- as part of the ultimate triconsonantal root. V. Orel (1995, 103, #43), in turn, explained Eg. wf3 from his AA *fi/u–- (sic, with *-–-) „lungs, stomach”, a product of pure fancy, based on a phonologically unacceptable comparison with Bed. fi– and LECu. *fi—-, which is certainly false as Eg. -3 has nothing on common with LECu. *-—-. 109 Since the only evidence for *fw- is one single Angas record [Flk.] (which can be secondary labialization as well), the reflexes could be alternatively explained from AS *folok ~ *felek. 110 Attested in Angas (hill) fwŏlŏk (so, fw-!) „the lungs” [Flk. 1915, 182], Sura fÚlÓk „Lungen” [Jng. 1963, 65] = fìlòk [fǜlòk < *fəlok] „lungs” [Krf.], Mupun flòk ~ fùlfúk „lung” [Frj. 1991, 18], Mushere folok „lungs” [Dkl. 1997 MS], Goemay felek „the lungs” [Srl. 1937, 48] = fílíl (so! error for *fílík?) „lungs” [Krf.] = fəlek [-ə- < -e-] „lungs” [Hlw. 2000 MS, 9]. 111 The Chadic words for “lung” were erroneously affiliated in HSED #775 with HECu. *afale “liver” [Hds. 1989, 404] and NOm.: Kefoid (PGonga) *afar-o “liver” [Bnd. 2003, 168, #81] = *afār- [GT]. But as H.G. Mukarovsky (1987, 103; 1989 MS, 5) rightly pointed out, this HECu.-Kefoid parallel represents a distinct AA root with different Chadic cognates such as WCh.: Angas-Sura *falak ~ *folok „liver” [GT 2004, 104]: Chip fílÓk [fülk < *fəlok?] „liver” [Krf.], Tal fÓlÓk [Krf.], Montol fəlÓk [Krf.], Goemay falak „the liver” [Srl. 1937, 47] = fəlÚ (so, no 3rd consonant) „liver” [Krf.] = falak „liver” [Hlw. 2000 MS, 9] || CCh.: Fali-Bwagira farən „liver” [Krf.] | Gisiga me-vel (prefix me-) „Leber” [Lukas 1970, 129]. The final *-k in Angas-Sura might be the suffix *-k of body parts. 112 Cf. LECu.: Afar fult-o „blowing, puffing” [PH 1985, 105] | Oromo fōl-ā „odore” [Crl. 1938 II 200] = fōl-ī „odor”, fōll-awa „to have odor, give scent” [Gragg 1982, 148] | HECu. *fōl- „to breathe”, *fōl-e „breath, odor, smell” [Hds. 1989, 106-7, 409] ||| NOm.: Gimirra-Benesho pel „to blow (e.g., on fire)” [Wdk. 1990, 109] ||| WCh.: Daffo-Butura fòl „Pfeife” [Jng. 1970, 214] | Burma fwale „to blow” [Krf.], Kir fwale „to blow (mouth)” [Csp. 1994, 42], Guruntum fali „to blow” [Jaggar 1989, 183] || CCh.: Musgu-Puss fili „vanner au vent” [Trn. 1991, 88] | Zime fòl „to blow” [Krf.] || ECh.: Kera fúulí „blasen, wehen” [Ebert 1976, 46].

This is a widely known common Afro-Asiatic word with abundant literature.114 Whether Eg. jb is a „Semitic” word is hard to answer. In any case, the palatalization of the Anlaut *l- > j- speaks for a subsequent *-i-. It is also to be researched, to what extent the Cushito-Omotic reflexes represent sg. inherited directly from Proto-Afro-Asiatic or old loans from Ethio-Semitic as it is the case with Kefoid in the opinion of H.C. Fleming (l.c. supra). Not being aware of the extra-Semitic parallels, H. Grapow (1954, 63-64) was convinced of a special Semitic cognacy of Eg. jb: „Das Wort jb ist urverwandt mit dem Semitischen, ist im Koptischen nicht mehr vorhanden, in welchem es, und dieser Vorgang hat im Spätägyptischen begonnen, durch das Wort ḥ3.tj verdrängt und ersetzt ist”.

by several specialists of Egyptian philology, is nothing else but a nisbe of Eg. 3.t „front part” and so – as H. Grapow (1954, 64) writes – it „bezeichnet das Organ augenscheinlich als das ‘vorn’ im Körper befindliche”. Discussing this nisbe rendered as „celui du devant”, P. Lacau (1970, 93-94) was correctly concluding that „ce nom du cæur est une dérivation égyptienne; le mot n’a pas de correspondant en sémitique, il est relativement récent”.
Eg. jdr „Herz” (LP, Wb I 155, 1) was affiliated by V. Orel and O. Stolbova (1992, 186; HSED #127) with a number of attractive parallels, which, however, represent two distinct AA roots:
(1) PAngas *ḍūr (from *ḍuγur?) „heart” [GT 2004, 97],116 which stands apparently isolated even within Angas-Sura.117 If there is a West Chadic cognate, it is perhaps AngasSura *ḍuγur „kidney” [GT 2004, 96],118 which – strangely – has no reflex in Angas with the sense „kidney”, where *ḍūr is regularly derivable from **ḍuγur. (2) SCu. *dūr- „intestines” [Ehret 1980, 167]119 ||| ECh.: Lele dùrè ~ dùrò „1. centre, milieu, 2. quartier (village)” [WP 1982, 18].120
„Hand”
Eg. *d (Osing: *jắd) „die Hand, als Hieroglyphe für d, nur im Schriftzeichen belegt” (Wb V 414, 3), hence dj.w (m), dj.t (f) „5” (OK-, Wb V 420, 9-12),121 reflected in Coptic as *dô(j.ă)w (m) → (S) ]ou, *dôj.ăt (f) → (S) ]e,122 which is usually regared to have
not specified) a-gad „intérieur de la poitrine”. W. Leslau (1949, 314) assumed it to be better to be connected with Eth. –əngəd–a or –əngəd—a „breast”. V. Orel and O. Stolbova (1992, 186) CCh. *ḫay- „heart”.
116 Attested only in Angas duur „heart” [Ormsby 1914, 209] = duur „heart, breast” [Flk. 1915, 174] = ḍúúr „Herz” [Jng. 1962 MS] = ḍur „heart” [ALC 1978, 14] = dur [-»] „heart” [Kraft] = ḍur „heart” [Gochal 1994, app.]. 117 A.B. Dolgopolsky (1982, 33) mistakenly identified the Angas word for “heart” (misleadingly rendered by him also as “chest”) with Sura túgúr “chest”, which is, however, to be derived from Common Angas-Sura *ṭuγur ~ *ṭoγor „1. side/trunk of body, 2. chest, breast” [GT 2004, 386], which was followed by V. Orel and O. Stolbova (l.c.), who forged a false WCh. *–V-dur- „heart” with an unattested *d and a short *-u-. Dolgopolsky’s external comparson with Ar. zawr- „upper part of the breast” is equally unacceptable for phonological reasons (Angas ḍ- ≠ Sem. z-). 118 Attested in Sura ḍúgúr „Niere” [Jng. 1963, 65] = ḍugur „kidney” [Krf.], Mupun ḍúur „kidney” [Frj. 1991, 17], Chip dùgur (so, plain d-! error) „kidney” [Krf.], perhaps Goemay ḍââr [ḍr, *ḍā3r < *ḍwaγar or *ḍoγor?] „the perineum” [Srl. 1937, 23]. 119 Based by Ch. Ehret (l.c.) on the comparison of Iraqw durumi „first stomach”, Burunge durumiya „large intestines”, and Dahalo d�ra „intestines”, which he later (Ehret 1987, 55, #203) affiliated with Agaw *źir- „intestines”. This latter etymology is, nevertheless, incorrect as the first radicals do not correspond. 120 This isolated form is, naturally, insufficient for assuming an ECh. *dur- “middle” as Orel and Stolbova (l.c.) suggested.

originated in a nisbe **jăd.¢y (Osing, Loprieno) rendered as *”belonging to hand” (GT) = „die zu einer Hand Gehörigen” (Osing) or „hand, pentad (of fingers)” (Albright pace Sethe). This derivation, paralleled by a number of analogical instances,123 is actually based on the commonly accepted124 comparison of Eg. *d with Common Sem. *yad„hand”,125 which was denied by Rösslerian E.A. Knauf (1982, 31, 34) unconvincingly combining the Eg. word with Akk. ūṭu „Spanne”.
Eg. dr.t ~ d3.t126 „Hand” (PT-, Wb V 580-9 vs. 516, 5-8) = „palm of the hand” (Müller 1909, 191) has no Semitic background. On the contrary, some researchers (e.g., Kaplony in KBIÄF 160, n. 208, presented by A. Loprieno in LÄ V 1212 as the „communis opinio”) suppose here an Egyptian innovation literally signifying *”Greiferin” derived from a hypothetic Eg. *√dr, whose root variety with an extension n- is attested as ndrj „fassen, packen” (OK, Wb V 382-3). Not necessarily contradicting this theory, I have elsewhere (EDE I ) suggested a cognacy with CCh. *√ngr [GT]: Daba ngra „Arm” [Str. 1910, 453] = ngər ~ ngra „bras, main, doigt” [Mch. 1966, 143], Musgoy wúri ŋgra „hand” [Mch.], Kola ŋgrá „hand” [Schubert] | Musgum ŋgraŋge „arm” [Roeder] | Buduma ngəru „shoulder” [Grb.] (CCh.: JI 1994 II 179) ||| ECh. *√grN „hand, wing, shoulder” [Skn. 1992, 346]: Karbo goreny „shoulder” [Grb. 1963, 62]. In A. Loprieno’s (LÄ V 1214, n. 31) opinion, however, „besser wäre m.E. in einer Sprachtabu-Perspektive die Interpretation ’die Fernhaltende’ bzw. ’Fernzuhaltende’”, i.e., a derivation from Eg. dr „fernhalten von jem., (einen Zustand) beseitigen, (Fuss, Schreiten) aufhalten” (PT-, Wb V 595, 5-7). It is a pity that he was unable to establish this semantical development in the light of convincing parallels. All other proposals for the etymology of Eg. dr/3.t are out of the question. The very old comparison with Hebrew zeret and Aram. zartā „span”127 fails because Eg. d = Sem. *z can only occur in loans, but not genetic cognates. The same pertains to the frequent equation of Eg. dr.t with Sem. *dirā—- „shoulder” [Frz.

Vycichl (1990, 40, 196) rightly pointed out – to that of the status absolutus *dár. ̆t > Cpt. (S) twre vs. status pronominalis *dắr.t= > *dắ3.t= > Cpt. (S) toot=. G. Farina (1926, 17) noted also a pl. d3.wt. 127 Sethe 1912, 94; Albright 1918, 90; Farina 1924, 324; 1926, 16; ESS §24.c.1; Yeivin 1932, 73, fn. 6; GÄSW 227, #946; Brunner 1969, 88, #483; Ward 1972, 22, #293, Conti 1976, 267, fn. 18. A cognacy was correctly rejected already by W. M. Müller (1909, 191) due semantical considerations. Following Bondi (1894, 132 and fn. 1), who established Hbr. mēzaḥ as a loan from Eg. mdḥ, Th. Lambdin (1953, 149-150) did not rule out a borrowing into Semitic in the MK or even before „when a *ğart- was current” in Egyptian. This hypothesis is in full accordance with the rules of Canaanite nomina segolata (Dolgopolsky 1986).

1964, 259],128 where the Sem. C3 would not even be reflected in Egyptian.129 Also C.T. Hodge’s (1979, 497) comparanda displaying an initial *ṭ-130 are evidently out of question as Eg. d- ≠ Sem. *ṭ-. In the opinion of E.A. Knauf (1982, 37, n. 19), „zweifellos gehört äg. / ̃rt/ mit akk. qātu zusammen”, whose „mittlere Liquide wurde im Akkadischen an den Vokal assimiliert” (!). One cannot be surprised enough at this astonishing suggestion contradicting the elementary rules of the Akkadian historical phonology.131 Th. Schneider (1997, 208, #116), in turn, projected a nowhere attested pre-Eg. *qaltu (sic) wishing to equate it with NBrb.: Tamazight i-γil „Arm, Vorderarm, Elle” | Qabyle i-γil „Arm, Elle” || Tuareg a-γil „(ganzer) Arm”, which lautgeschichtlich represents another mistake.132
Eg. gd (NK)133 ~ qd.t (XXII.)134 ~ qd (4th cent. BC)135 – all vars. are feminine and in group-writing typical (albeit not in absolute terms) of loans – „hand” (Černý 1958, 212, #10; CED 340) = „Hand(rücken)” (GHWb 870) = „back of the hand” (DLE IV 28) > Dem. gjd ~ gd ~ kjd „Hand” (DG 595:4) > Cpt. (SALF) [ij, (BF) jij, (F) jijh,136 (pBodmer VI) kij, (MF) [i[ (f) „Hand, Vorderfuß (bei Tieren), Handvoll (als Maß), Handgriff, Bügel, Handarbeit, Tätigkeit, Führung, Handschrift” (KHW 472): as an anatomical term, i.e., part of the core lexicon (not typical to be borrowed), it must be rather an item of the Volkssprache with no Older Egyptian etymon attested in written form (henceforth, with no graphemic tradition) prior to the New Kingdom, which is why syllabic orthography was applied here. V. Blažek (1990, 30; 1991, 210) affiliated it with NOm. *ḳwiCi „5” [Blz.] and NOm. *√k ̃ „pукa” [IS 1971, #80] = *kuc-/*kis- „hand or arm” [Bnd.-Flm. 1976, 38] = *kuc „hand” [Bnd. 1988, 147]. This correspondence may be correct provided the C2 of the Omotic root was a glottal affricate.

Blažek 1989 MS Om., 16, #52 also NOm.: Janjero zerum “hand” and some Chadic forms. 129 Where, by the way, one would expect a reflex like **z3— > *z3ḫ (for the shift of *— > ḫ in the proximity of dentals see EDE I 326-7). 130 Sem.: Ar. ṭarr-at- „flank” ||| SBrb. (Tuareg) a-ḍer „leg” ||| LECu.: Somali ḍarṓr-ayya „to bank up” ||| WCh.: Hausa caaráá „to arrange”. 131 His two pieces of “evidence” (namely Mehri qôn “Horn” < *√qrn and Aram. y·hâk “er geht” < *√hlk), however, do not prove a bit about his ad hoc supposition about the alleged loss of *-r- in Akkadian. 132 An apparent cognate appears in LECu.: Galab gíl, pl. gill-ù “hand” [Sasse 1974, 416], which – as I have demonstrated it elsewhere (Takács 2011, 148-150) – speaks in favour of an AA *γ in this root, i.e., AA *√γl „hand” [GT] as it had long been surmised by W. Vycichl (1934, 69, 84; 1951, 68). 133 Attested in the Leipzig NK stela no. 122, in a (fem.?) PN ndm-gd „one with a tender hand”, recorded in PN I 215:20 and by Spiegelberg in his KHW 212, n. 12. 134 Occurs in pTorino 1984, vs. 20-21, in the enumeration of body parts listed between dr.t „hand” and k3p „hollow of the hand”, which led J. Černý (l.c.) to assuming our word to be „in the XXIInd Dynasty not quite synonymous with dr.t as the meaning of [ij might lead us to believe”.
135 Cf. pBM 10252 (Urk. VI 83:6): t3j=k qd 2, rendered by dr.tj=k(j) „your two hands” in pLouvre 3129. 136 Is the additional -h a trace of the AA marker *-- of the nominal class of anatomical terminology (described in Takács 1997)?

„Left”
Eg. j3b.j „links, linke Seite, die Linke” (OK-, Wb I 30) > j3b.t „1. linke Seite, 2. Osten” (OK-, Wb I 30, 14-15): its etymology has not yet been definitely settled due to the plurality of attractive solutions: (1) F. Hommel (1894, 346, 1904, 109), followed by G.R. Castellino (1984, 17), surmised here an old loan-word from Sumerian gùb, but Hommel’s supposition on the Sumerian term becoming „später etwa jib” as well as the lack of reflection (or source?) of the Eg. -3- in Sumerian hinder such an equation. (2) W. Vycichl (1990, 91) affiliated it with Sem.: Ar. wa–aba and ya–iba „avoir honte, être en colère” arguing that „la main gauche” was „considérée comme étant de mauvaise augure, avec la quelle on ne mange pas et qu’on ne tend pas aux amis”. Phonologically possible, albeit semantically far-fetched. (3) H.G. Mukarovsky (1994, 148) found surprising correspondences in the languages of Central Chadic, where a proto-form *Íaḅ(a) „zur linken Hand” > „Norden” [GT]137 emerges in the Higi and Mandara groups with a variety *laḅ-, which may regularly be traced back to an older **la–b-, i.e., a proto-form fully plausible for Eg. √j3b too. Similarly, V. Orel and O. Stolbova (1992, 200; HSED #1821) compared Eg. j3bj with WCh.: Seya (Zar) nàḅi „left” [Krf. 1981, #330], which is perhaps the reflex of the same **la–b-. But their supposition on an eventual etymological link to AA *li/ub- „heart” [OS] is dubious because of the anomaly of *-ḅ- in root for „left” vs. *-b- in that of „heart”. (4) H.G. Mukarovsky (1994, 152, §4.2) suggested, at the same time, a semantically possible138 cognacy with NAgaw: Bilin arέbā „schwarz”, which is, however, phonologically dubious.139 (5) Another path has been opened by C.T. Hodge (1966, 44, #9; 1968, 26, #50; 1981, 375) pointing to a possible connection to WCh.: Hausa –árèèwáá „northwards” [Abr. 1962, 36] (actually *„to the left”), but whether Eg. -b- and Hausa -w- can be equated is obscure. (6) In my opinion, the root meaning of Eg. *√j3b might be better understood in the light of Eg. j3b „(Adjektiv und Verbum übler Bedeutung) vom Geruch der Leiche” (OK, Wb I 29, 19) = „übel riechen, krank sein” (NBÄ 84) = „übelriechend, stinkend sein” (GHWb 24), hence *jè/́ĭ3b. ̆Vt „Krankheit u.ä.” (NBÄ) > Cpt.

Ember (1926, 312, #7) rightly stated, the Semitic stem might be segmented into *ŝa–m- + *-al-, a „secondary addition”.144 This opinion has been expressed also in the work by S.S. Majzel’ and A.Ju. Militarev (1983, 236), who, however, mistakenly supposed a quite different original sense.145 F. von Calice (GÄSW 197-8, #809) saw in both Sem. *ŝa–mal- and Eg. smḥj „verschiedene Weiterbildungen einer Wurzel šm (sic), die aber nicht der Urschicht angehören können, da das s im Ägyptischen westsemitischen Lautstand zeigt”. Nevertheless, Eg. smḥj can by no means be regarded as a loan from Canaanite (or whatsoever) due to the differing C3 in Egyptian, which may not be explained the same way as Sem. *-al-. Is it identical with the suffix -ḥ occurring in Egyptian
140 Erman 1892, 119; Holma 1911, x, Ember 1926, 312, #7; Farina 1926, 20; GÄSW 197-8, #809. Nevertheless, W.A. Ward (1961, 38, #21) remarked that the Semitic word „doesn’t appear in Eg. or Dem.”, just on a Coptic ostracon as smoul ”left/east (?)” (CD 565b), which is evidently a Semitic loan.

142 A. Ember (l.c. supra) assumed an irreal chain of smḫj (sic, -ḫ-) < *šmḥj < **šm3j without any comparative evidence. The only way out to explain this anomalous match would be assuming an equally striking connection between Eg. mḥ and Sem. *ml– „to fill”. 143 Cf. stem I: ša–ama „1. être de mauvais augure, sinistre, malencontreux, porter malheur à qqn.”, šu–ima „1. être sinistre, de mauvais augure, porter malheur, 2. être à gauche, se présenter du côté gauche”, šā–im- „1. (qui est à) gauche, 2. sinistre, de mauvais augure, qui porte malheur, 3. méchant”, šu–m- „malheur, infortune, adversité, 2. malheureux, 3. (qui est à) gauche” [BK I 1178-9]. 144 Whether CCh.: Fali-Muchella mà-ŝìmbÓru „left” [Krf.] is related and whether the same historical analysis can be made here too, is not yet clear (as long as as further Chadic cognates are not at our disposal). 145 S.S. Majzel’ and A.Ju. Militarev (1983, 236 and fn. 36), followed by A. Gluhak (1987, 163, fn. 11), assumed an etymological connection with Soqotri šé–emet „courbé, qui penche d’un côté” [Lsl. 1938, 409], but the initial sibilants differ (the term for „left” has ŝ- and lacks -–-). In addition, as W. Leslau (l.c.) points out, the Soqotri term is extended from –amt „côté” akin to Geez –ǝnta „à côté de, vers” cf. Sem. *–amm-at„Elle” [GT after GB 47; WUS 24, #272; AHW 44] ||| Eg. jm „1. (OK) ein Körperteil: ob Rippe (?), 2.

Dem. gbjr „links” (DG 578:3) > (SL) [bour, (SMF) hbour, (AL) [bir, (pBodmer VI) kbir (f) „left hand” (CED 275) = „linke Hand, linke Seite, links” (KHW 446). Its pre-Demotic history is obscure just like its external ties. At the moment just guesses can be made: (1) W. Vycichl (DELC 336) tried to affiliate it with Sem.: Ar. √ğbr I „1. panser, bander et remboîter, remettre (un os démis, cassé), 3. forcer, contraindre à qqch.” [BK I 247]. Semantically far-fetched. (2) A comparison with Sem. *√grb „north” [GT]147 would be not better either because of the metathesis, although the association between „left” and „north” is well attested both in Semitic and Chadic (instances above). (3) From a phonological viewpoint, it is still difficult to understand whether and – if yes – how LEg. *găb¢r might be related to ECu. *gur- „left” [GT]148 (which was borrowed into Ethio-Semitic)149 ||| CCh. *g(w)ur- „left” [GT].150 This would only be possible if we assume an earlier Eg. **gwr, for which we only have scanty support.151
„Right”
Eg. jmn „rechts (Adj.), rechte Seite (Subst.)” (PT-, Wb I 85, 11-14) > jmn.t „rechte Seite, Westen” (OK-, Wb I 86) is evidently cognate with Sem. *yamin- „destro, mano

Cerulli (1936, 204), cf. Tigrinya gəraw „left-handed”, Gurage *gura „left (direction)”, ancient Harari gura, Amharic and Argobba gəra, Gafat gərä „left” (ES: Leslau 1979 III 288-9). By the way, W. Leslau (1956, 203) erroneously suggested a derivation from Sem. *√γrb „to set (of sun)” becoming in his view gr with the loss of -b under Cushitic influence.
150 Cf. Higi-Kamale (kw)gwùlà „left” [Krf.] | Lame bà-gù»ú „left” [Krf.], Lame-Peve ḅa-gur „left” [Krf.], ZimeBatna gúrā „gauche” [Scn. 1982, 498], Misme (Zime) gour „left” [Krf.] (Ch.: Krf. 1981, #330; Stl. 1996, 67). The reconstruction of PCh. *gulu/a „left” [Stl. l.c.] is not corroborated by the inner and external evidence. 151 Cf. Cpt. (S) lwbs „to be hot, glow” (CD 137b), which J. Černý (CED 70) derived from Eg. nwḫ „1. verbrannt, versengt werden, 2. sich erwärmen, kochen” (CT, Med., XIX., Wb II 224, 10-12), but at the same time J. Osing (NBÄ 244, 814, n. 1062, cf. KHW 514) preferred to take it from Eg. 3bḫ „verbrennen” (CT VII 263c, GHWb 7; ÄWb II 12c), although the latter etymon has recently been rendered „to join” (AECT III 129, spell 1033) = „to unite” (DCT 3). Cf. also SBrb.: Ayr ǝ-lbǝg „se réchauffer, se rallumer (dispute)” [PAM 2003, 447].

destra” [Frz. 1965, 265, #4.26] = *yamīn- „прaвый, южный” [Djk., Hodge].152 The Sem.-Eg. match has been usually extended to WCh.: Hausa yàmmáá „westwards” [Abr. 1962, 944],153 which might only be accepted provided this form were assimilated from *yamn-, for which I see no proof.154 Otherwise hardly, as the segmentation *yam- + *-ī ̆n-155 seems unlikely. On the contrary, if one is to isolate here the ultimate biconsonantal root (if any), it is the first radical that might well turn out to be a *y- mobile, cf. AA *√mn „right” [GT] > NOm.: Sezo 1 mànnέ, 2 màni „right (side)” [Sbr.-Wdk. 1994, 15] ||| WCh.: Maha monay „right (side)” [Nwm. 1965, 58, #89]. Or should we assume here a metathesis of the AA root varieties *√ymn ~ *√mny? In any case, Eg. jmn finds its closest match in Sem. *√ymn.
Eg. wnm.j „rechts (Adj.), rechte Seite (Subst.)” (OK-, Wb I 322, 1-12), actually *w ̆ńĭm. ̆j in the light of Cpt. (S) ounam. In spite of its misleading similarity, an alleged connection to Eg. jmn is excluded.156 Most probably we are dealing here with an inner Egyptian innovation. F.L. Griffith (1898, 60) was the first to point out a possible derivation from Eg. wnm „eat”, which was later corroborated by W. Vycichl (1959, 71; 1972, 178) rendering the right hand as „Eß-Hand” or „celle qui mange” in the light of numerous parallels in the African languages, cf. CCh.: Logone zĕm „manger” zĕmi „main droite”,157
152 See Stern in ZÄS 22 (1884), 74, fn. 1; Erman 1892, 107; Hommel 1894, 345, n. ***; Jahn 1906, 377, fn. 1; Holma 1911, x; Farina 1924, 316, 318; 1926, 13, 21; ESS §4.b.8 and §10.a.3; GÄSW #8; Vycichl 1958, 376; D’jakonov 1965, 47; Hodge 1976, 12, #48; 1977, 933; 1981, 404. F. Hommel (1904, 117-8, fn. 2) surprisingly changed his mind and explained Eg. jmn as the „ältere Form” of wnm (sic, for wnm.j) „rechts”, which, in turn, he derived from hnm.w „widderköpfig wie ... Amon” implying an ultimate kinship with the theonym jmn „Amon”! 153 See Vycichl 1934; Vergote 1945, 131, §2.a.2; Cohen 1947, #495; Pilszczikowa 1960, 123, #126; Olderogge 1960, 800; D’jakonov 1967, 187; Mukarovsky 1994, 146. The meaning „Westen, Abend” associated to the Hausa word by J. Vergote (l.c.) is false. Similarly, M. Cohen (uncritically followed by N. Pilszczikowa, l.c. supra) misquoted Hausa yamma „right” (sic), which was disproved by D. Ol’derogge (1952, 34 and fn. 27) pointing to the fact that for that notion Hausa has a different word, viz. dáámá „right (hand, side)” [Abr. 1962, 178]. 154 Let alone that no further parallels from the Chadic daughter languages are known to corroborate such a historical reconstruction.
155 N. Skinner (1995, 34) affiliated the Egypto-Semitic and Hausa isogloss with Sem. *yamm- „sea” (> LEg. jm) and Cu. *yam(m)- „water, river”! This suggestion, not argued for by Skinner, remains baseless. How to render the signification of the C3 in Sem. *√ymn?
156 F. Hommel (1904, 117-8, fn. 2) assumed in Eg. √wnm the older form of √jmn and then eventually took both words from hnm.w „Chnum”! W.F. Albright (1923, 67) too related both roots via a „transposition of m and n”. 157 This term is cognate to a number parallel expressions for „right”, cf. WCh.: SBauchi *šəm- (or sim.) [GT]: Dira (Zul) šιmli, Burma nè-šipì, Geji à-šὶ nti, Buli a-š ̀âm, Dwot to-šìm, Polchi šímlí || CCh.: PTera *səm- (or sim.)

The underlying root may be identical to PCh *√zm „to eat” [JI 1994 I 56B].

Ful nyāmo „droite” < nyām- „1. manger, 2. viande”, Ewhe ḍu „manger” → nu-ḍu-si „main pour manger → droite”, Swahili kula „manger” ~ mkono wa kulia „la main pour manger = main droite”. One might add that WCh.: Ngizim mà-tá „right (hand)” also derives from táu „to eat” (which is akin, by the way, to Sem. *√twy „to eat”). All other suggestions on the origin of Eg. wnm.j158 are, therefore, to be considered with much more reservation.
Directions
D. Olderogge (1960, 800) critically – and rightly – assessed K. Sethe’s hypothesis on an Asiatic origin of ancient Egyptians, whose ancestors – in the latter’s view – had penetrated into the Nile Valley from the North Delta and moved up the river facing the south with the west on the right side. But as the Russian Africanist argued, in those predynastic times, when the Proto-Egyptians are supposed to have invaded the Delta, it was merely a swamp impossible to open up. Is it necessary at all to identify the northern orientation with the supposed direction of the wandering? For Proto-Egyptians, such a point of orientation must have been the supposed source of Nile. This must be
the reason why the notion „South” may have originated in the primary sense „head”159,
whereas that for „North” may be associated with „back”.160

158 There are a few further tempting solutions. (1) V. Orel and O. Stolbova (1992, 201; cf. also Orel 1995, 127, #53; HSED #2522) equated Eg. wnm.j with the apparently isolated ECh.: Kabalay uólema „rechts” [Lukas 1937, 93], which Orel took from a Nostratic *wal(e)m- „right (side)”. Naturally, one would need much more Chadic data before venturing such a daring reconstruction. (2) With regard to the association of the notions „right” vs. „direct”, an etymological link to NBrb.: Tamazight √nm: nem „être droit, direct, (re)dressé” [Taïfi 1991, 491] might in principle be conceivable (assuming a w- mobile in Egyptian). (3) Even less probable seems a connection to WCh.: Bade àanÚm „south” CCh.: Margi àním „north”, WMargi bwr-–ànuw aním „south”, Wamdiu ànum „north” | Mandara –ànum „south”, Glavda (Ch.: Kraft 1981). 159 Eg. rs.w “der Süden” (OK-, WB II 453) > (SBA) ryc, rendered by W.F. Albright literally as *„what belongs to the head-waters (of the Nile)”, has been usually affiliated with Sem. *ra–š- „head” (cf. Hommel 1894, 345-6; Müller 1909, 188, fn. 3; Holma 1911, x, 10; 1919, 39; Ember 1918, 31; Albright 1918, 90; 1923, 67; Farina 1924, 314, 324; ESS §12.a.24; GÄSW 27, #20). 160 For Eg. mḥ.w „Unterägypten” (OK-, Wb II 123) cf.

Conclusion
As we can see from the synopsis, the core lexicon of anatomical terminology, in its not insignificant part, is in fact a mostly binary (or simetimes triadic) system of synonyms, which have either Semitic cognacy or an African (non-Semitic) etymological background in its origins. Sometimes – as normally it is the case in the history of a language – an inner Egyptian innovation also appears as a third synonym. It is also apparent from the table above by what degree Semitic words are outnumbered in this domain as compared to those attested only in the African branches. What is more, scanning through – etymologically – all basic terms for „tongue” and „throat” (quite numberous, in addition), we have to state that none of them were Semitic. Thi seems to betray, at least in the examined field of human anatomy, a deeper presence of the extra-Semitic vocabulary in Egyptian, where the equivalent Semitic components may have perhaps been due to a subsequent cohabitation. The subsequent parts of this series are planned to survey the rest of anatomical terminology and numerals.

Layers of the oldest Egyptian lexicon II
Gábor Takács
Abstract
The papers of this series examine various domains of the Egyptian core lexicon in order to evidence to what degree the basic vocabulary is of clearly Semitic vs. African cognacy. The second part focuses on the Ancient Egyptian anatomical terminology from the head to the upper torso not yet examined in the first issue.
Introduction
The first paper of this series1 was generated by the controversies of P. Lacau’s (1970) old observation on a binary opposition of the Ancient Egyptian anatomical terminology, the much-quoted and thus examplified basic terms of which I re-examined from the head to the upper torso in the context of many new results issuing from current progress in Afro-Asiatic (Semito-Hamitic) comparative linguistics in order to see to what degree this segment of the lexicon is shared by lexemes of clearly Semitic cognacy vs. those evidently relating to African parallels. The etymological examination of the Ancient Egyptian anatomical terminology presented therein has corroborated a surprising distribution: one member of the synonymous pairs is usually a Semitic word, whereas the other one(s) have non-Semitic cognate(s) solely attested in some of the African branches of our language macrofamily. A relatively deeper presence of the extra-Semitic vocabulary in Egyptian has become apparent. As the introductory part only contained the classical instances, the famous pairs like „eye”, „ear”, „hand”, extended onto some further items where the binary opposition is also to observed like the basic terms „head”, „hair”, it was already then obvious that the rest of the anatomical terminology and other domains of the core vocabulary are also to be examined. This second part of the series „Layers of the oldest Egyptian lexicon” is devoted to an etymological research in the field of body parts on the head and the upper torso, i.e., the same area as what was targeted in the first part. The difference is that – leaving the well-known Semitic vs. African pairs for the basic terms behind – here, we study rather the origins of either the specific anatomical terms or those for body parts not yet set in this context the aim being the same: to clear if the binary opposition of Semitic vs. African cognates worked here too, or, if not, whether the Semitic or African component is overwhelming in this domain of the Egyptian core lexicon.
„Hair”
Eg. j3r.t (hair det.) „1. (XII.) *Haare (vom Tierfell), 2. (CT VII 156f) Seitenlocken (des Gottes)” (GHWb 25; ÄWb II 77b) = j3r.tj (dual) „side-whiskers (?)” (CT VII 156f, DCT 14) > „Stirnschlange des Re” (LP, Wb I 32, 3), cf. perhaps also 3r.t „*Perücke, Kopftuch” (LP, Wb I 11, 17-18), hence denominative *3r „to prepare wig” (unattested), whose nomen actoris might be j3r.tj „*Perückenmacher (nur in Personennamen belegt)” (OK, GHWb 25, cf. PN I 7:1) ||| CCh.: Musgu yiir na mada „Kopfhaar” [Krause] = air vs. áiir vs. iir, pl. yirái ~ yirakái „Haar” (cf. yir „Wolle”, and also: hir na máge-ni „Stirnhaar”, i.e., lit. „Haar seines Kopfes”) [Rohlfs] = ayiir „Haar” [Barth] = auyír [Overweg] = ayír [Roeder] = Fyẹr „cheveux” [Mch. 1950, 31] || ECh.: Mubi álèè, pl. àlè “Haar, Federn, Wolle” [Lks. 1937, 180] = "álìyò, pl.

Eg. wpr.t “Seitenlocke des Kindes” (GR, Wb I 305, 6), attested already in the Coffin Texts (II 119e, II 122123c, VI 131g contra AECT) as wpr.tj (dual) „la double tresse, les deux tresses” (Barguet 1986, 144-145, 541, spell 533 + fn. 216) = „Seitenlocken” (GHWb 193; ÄWb II 660a) = „hair” (DCT 991), has the closest parallels in Sem.: Ar. √wfr I „être abondant, copieux, se trouver en grand nombre” > wafr-at- „2. chevelure abondante, tresse artificielle” (hence Maghrebi wafra „mèche de cheveux”), wāfir-at- „queue grasse des moutons d’une certaine espèce” [DRS 589 pace BK II 1574-5] = wafr-at- „hair collected together upon the head, hair hanging down upon the ears, hair extending beyond/to the lobe of the ear or to the ears” [Lane 2956b], Maroccan Ar. wuf0a „chevelure abondante, chevelure d’homme longue et abondante, mais qui ne descend qu’au niveau de l’oreille, les beaux cheveux noirs abondants d’une femme qui retombent sur le front”, mūfūr (adj., poet.) „dotée d’une belle et abondante chevelure qui retombe sur le devant de la tête (femme)” [Premare et al.

It is with gratitude that I acknowledge the support of the Bolyai research fellowship (Hungarian Academy of Sciences, reg. no.: BO / 00360 / 12) facilitating my project on Egyptian linguogenesis. 2 It would be tempting to connect the Dullay word with Ar. «ufr-at- "2. crinière (du lion), long poil du cou (qui se hérisse chez certains animaux, quand ils sont en colère), 3. plumes du cou du coq, qui se dressent quand il est irrité)", «ifr-āt- "2.

metathesis) hides also in Ar. farw-at- „1. une pelisse, une robe fourrée, 2. peau de la tête, 3. vêtement fait de poil de chameau” [BK II 588] = „Kopfhaut samt Haaren” [Torczyner]3 ||| NBrb.: Mzab √fr > tu-frə-t, pl. tu-fra-t-in „mèche bouclée de cheveux” [Dlh. 1984, 50] || EBrb.: Ghadames √fr > ta-fri-t, pl. ta-fra-t-īn „1. mèche de cheveux qui s’arrondit sur le front, 2. languette de chausson ou de chaussure qui recouvre le dessus du pied, ornée ou non de broderies de soie” [Lanfry 1973, 94, #140].
Eg. nzk.t „Haarflechte” (PT-, Wb III 116, 4-8) = „1. Haarzopf, Flechte (der Frau, der Asiaten, der Götter), 2.
*Stachelschwanz” (CT, ÄWb II 1715b) > (via metathesis) * nkz.t reflected by nks.tj „die Haarflechte (der
Göttin, des Kindes, des fktj Priesters, als Bez. der Schlange)” (GR, WB III 120, 12-14 and 121, 2), nks.t „Frau mit einer Haarflechte” (GR, Wb III 120, 15−121, 1) = „woman with braided hair” (PL 656). The suggestion by W. Vycichl (1938, 134) about the original reading of the Old Egyptian root as nk.t (without root medial -z-) has
recently been followed by R. Hannig (ÄWb I 850b and II 1715-6) even in those exx. where -z- was alphabetically written out. There are, however, indeed sporadic instances where -z- was in fact missing during the Middle Kingdom and later, cf. nk.t „seltene Nebenform zu nsk.t ’Haarflechte’” (MK, Wb III 120, 10) = „plait of hair” (CED 279) = „braided lock of hair” (CT, DCT 341), hence nk.tj.w „als Nebenform zu nsk.tjw die mit einer Haarflechte Versehenen” (BD, WB III 120, 11). Strangely, it is this latter root and not the older one with -z- that Eg. nk „*festbinden” (CT III 378d, ÄWb II 1715b) = „to enwrap (with sheets of linen?)” (AECT I 199, also n. 3 ad spell 260) = „habiller (?)” (Barguet 1986, 224) plus old nk „Papyrusfloß” (V., ÄWb I 850b) =
„Art Floss” (OK and XX., Wb III 220, 7) as well as the late evidence confirm in the form of *√ lk „to plait” (or sim.) [GT] > Dem. hlk „Art Geflecht” (DG 281) vs. hrg ~ hrk „Art Geflecht: Perücke (?)” (DG 280) = „object made in wicker work, wig (?)” (CED)4 > Cpt. (SBF) hwlk „to twist, roll, braid” (CD 668b; CED 279) = „flechten, wi/enden, drehen, wickeln”, also used as a noun (m) in the sense „Flechte, Geflecht, Locke” (KHW 366) = „concinnus comae” (Rn.). It is very difficult at the moment to pass any judgement also among the problematic etymologies proposed for the Egyptian root: (1) C. Brockelmann (1932, 109, #44) equated it with Ar. azaka „1. serrer, presser, comprimer, 2. entourer et
serrer (d’une corde)” [BK I 420] = „zusammenbinden” [Brk.], whose Semitic background is, however, not clear. In addition, this comparison ignores Eg. -n- < *-l-. (2) E. Zyhlarz (1932-1933, 171), in turn, affiliated it with Bed. hánkŭli „der Tituskopf der Beduan, die herabhängenden geflochtenen Haarlocken” [Rn. 1895, 123-4] = hankwíli „long hair that hangs to the shoulder” [Roper 1928, 198] = hankuli „Haarflechtenfrisur” [Zhl.], whose deverbal Ableitung is disputed. L. Reinisch (l.c.) derived it from Bed. hankŭl „verstricken, flechten, binden”, while E.-M. Roper (l.c.) assumed a connection to Bed. hankwil „youth”. The etymology offered by Reinisch, however, is neatly in accordance with the deverbal derivation of the Egyptian word from *√ lk „to plait” (above). (3) W. Vycichl (1959, 146, #3; 1990, 17) surmised a relationship with Ar. √qnz«: I qanza«a „avoir les cheveux dispersés autour de la tête” > qunzu«-(at)- „cheveux dispersés autour de la tête” vs. √qz« II „2. raser la tête en y laissant des mèches de cheveux çà et là” > qaz«- „4. flocons de laine, poil, que les animaux à laine ou à poil laissent tomber au printemps”, quz«-at- „1. mèche de cheveux qu’on a laissée sur la tête d’un petit garçon en la lui rasant, 2. mèche de cheveux laissée sur le sommet de la tête, 3. mèche de cheveux qui descend sur les tempes, boucle”, qazī«-at- „mèche de cheveux laissée au sommet de la tête”, "aqza«u „qui mue, qui a mué et perdu de la
cheveux du milieu de la tête", «afran „1. plumes du cou chez le coq qui se dressent et s’ébouriffent quand il est irrité, 2.
cheveux du derrière ou du sommet de la tête (chez l’homme), 3. toupet, crins ou poils qui qui descendent sur le front (chez les bestiaux)” [BK II 297-298], but this comparison is certainly out of the question for phonological reasons, since Sem. *«- = ECu. *«- (EDE I 270) > Dullay *«- (Sasse 1979, 56), which has been neatly preserved as «- in Gollango (AMS 1980, 195). Besides, A. G. Belova (1992, 16; 1998, 14) was disposed rather to see in the Arabic root metathesis to Ar. «urf- „12. crinière (du cheval)” and also Sem. *par«- „capelli fluenti” [Frz.] = *par(a) «- „hair (on top of the head)” [Blv. etc. 1994 MS, #77] = *par«- „(loose) hair of the head” [SED I ]. In addition, I have (EDE II 564-565) related the Semitic roots with LEg. f« ~ f«3 ~ f«j (hair det.) "lock of hair" (NE, Pap. Turin 1983, vo. I 47-48, Černý 1958, 210, #6 after I. E. S. Edwards) = „cheveux” (AL 77.1544) = „lock of hair” (DLE I 190) = „Haarlocke” (GHWb 305) – provided it derived from an earlier (*)f«3 (as is in fact written) < *√f«r or *f3« < *√fr«.
3 H. Torczyner (1912, 770) linked the Arabic word to Akk. pirtu „Kopfhaar”, which has recently been, however, explained rather from PSem. *par«- „(loose) hair of the head” [SED I 192, #218]. 4 Due to a merger of > h in Late Egyptian, Roman Demotic and hieroglyphic texts confuse and h (cf. Lacau 1965, 12f.; Vergote 1973 Ib, §28h). For the weakening of old pharyngeal to laryngeal h beginning from the end of the New Kingdom (Ramesside) cf. NBÄ 367f., n. 47.

garçon quand on la rase ou bien cheveux longs, reste de plumes, coccyx, crête du coq, crête huppe, coiffure de femme” [Dozy II 411] = quz«-at- ~ qunzu«-at- ~ qundu«-at- „lock of hair” [Vcl., Lsl.] = qurzu/a«-at- ~ qunzu/a«at- ~ qurzul- „la touffe de cheveux au ilieu de la tête rasée” [Landberg 1923, 1331], Modern Lit. Ar. qunzu«a ~ qanza«a ~ qinzi«a „Haarbüschel, Hahnenkamm” [Wehr 1953, 706], Yemeni qunza«ah „knot of hair peculiar to little boys” [Piamenta 1990-1, 414] || Geez qwənzā«t „lock/tuft of hair, ringlet, braid, plaited hairdo” [Lsl.] (Sem. data: Leslau 1987, 438). But Sem. *√"nz« is little compatible with Eg. √ nzk. Secondly, the basic sense of the Arabic root („top, peak”) is hardly equal to that of our Egyptian root („to plait”). (4) G. Takács (2000, 152, #174; 2000, 335, #1.9) ventured a comparison of the supposed Eg. *√ lzk „to plait” with SBrb. *√zlnk „peigner” [GT]: Ahaggar hələnk-ət, ETawllemet šələnk-ət ~ šərənk-ət ~ s-, Ayr s/šərənk-ət, Ghat žələnk-ət (SBrb. data: Prasse 1969, 55, #256). As a rule, AA * has in Berber either become *h (Militarev 1991, 243) or it has been lost (EDE I 270).
Eg. sw.t ~ zj.t “Zopf (?), Locke (?), Haarlocke (?)” (GHWb 664, 674; ÄWb II 2099 and 2131) = sw.t „lock of hair” vs. zj.t „var. of sw.t (?)” (DCT 459) ||| NBrb. *zaw5 „cheveux” [GT]: Mzab and Wargla a-zau „cheveux” [Lst.] = zaw „cheveu, chevelure, poil” [Dlh. 1984, 255; 1987, 399] | Nefusa zâu “capelli (coll.)” [Bgn. 1942, 222, 321] || EBrb. *zaw „hair” [GT]: Sokna zâu „cheveux” [Lst., Prd.], Sened zâu „cheveux” [Lst.], Fogaha azâu „capelli” [Prd. 1961, 297], Ghadames a-zau „cheveux” [Lst.] = a-zaw „cheveu, chevelure, poil, crin” [Lanfry 1973, 433, #1850] (EBrb.: Laoust 1931, 214; 1920, 111, fn. 2) ||| WCh.: Ron *swV ~ *syV “hair” [GT]: Fyer so, Bokkos syah [secondary -h?], Daffo-Butura swé (Ron: Jng. 1970, 387) | Bole-Tangale *sow- “hair” [GT]: Bole šowQ [Gowers] = sôwu [Krf.] = šowv (?)

These external parallels seems to justify that Eg. šnbj is not merely a miswritten form of šn “hair” (see part I of this series).
Eg. d3f (m) and d3f.t (f), both attested with "hair" determinative as a personal name (MK, PN I 405:5 and 405:8, resp.; Wb V 523, 1). With regard to the hair determinative, we may account for a word root √d3f connected with hair, for which the following possible alternative parallels might be considered (due to the dubious origin of OEg. d < either AA *g or AA *@/*E*/H, whereas OEg. 3 < AA *r or *l or seldom *"):

Eg. whnn „der Scheitel des Kopfes” (Med., Wb I 346, 1-2) = „Schädeldecke, Scheitel” (WMT I 203) = „crown of head” (FD 65), apparently a C1C2C3C3 diminutive or intensive form (NBÄ 295-301), has so far lacked any etymology, which seems now to appear in Berber, cf. EBrb.: Ghadames ā-wən „1. monter, gravir, 2. partir” [Lanfry 1973, 391, #1672] || SBrb.: Ahaggar a-wn „monter sur: se transporter, en montant, sur, gravir, aller en montant” [Fcd. 1951-2, 1502], ETawllemmet ə-wəz „monter sur/à (cheval etc.)” [PAM 2003, 826] ||| WCh.: perhaps Goemai haan, pl. hûan „to go up, climb, mount” [Srl. 1937, 72] = haan, pl. h‹γan „aufsteigen, (be)steigen” [Jng. 1962 MS, 8] = ni han „to mount” [Krf.] = haan, pl. hıan „to climb” [Hlw. 2000 MS, 13] < AA *√hwn „to mount” [GT]. The reflection of a mediae hollow *-w- root as Iae w- in Egyptian is regular (Law of Belova, cf. EDE I 394-400). K.-G. Prasse (PAM l.c.) postulated a PBrb. *ă-hwĭ/ŭn on the basis of the Berber data, which, by the way, J. Bynon (1984) combined with WCh. *√ wm, which, however, seems to reflect a distinct (albeit perhaps eventually related PAA var.) root.11
Eg. sm3 "1. behaarter Teil des Kopfes, Schläfengegend (mit Augenpartie, Haaransatz), Haare am Kopf, *Skalp, 2. Haarsträhne, 3.

cmau (pl., originally a dual < sm3.wj) "Schläfen, Augenlider, Wimpern" (KHW 187): as the listed renderings (including the Coptic evidence) indicate, its primary sense was „temporal region” and only in the late period it shifted secondarily to denote „top of head”. This root was discussed in my preceding paper „Layers of the oldest Egyptian lexicon I”.12 Here, may we only remark that among the cognates, highly noteworthy is HECu. *samm-o "top of head" [Hds. 1989, 420].
Eg. q3b.t ~ qb3.t „Scheitel des Kopfes” (MK-, Wb V 11, 10; GHWb 849, 853; ÄWb II 2511c) = qb3.t „crown of head” (FD 277): so far no acceptable etymology has been offered except for combining Eg. qb3.t with Sem.: Ar. qubl- “front, face” suggested by C. T. Hodge (1966, 46), which is phonologically perfect, but semantically less convincing (albeit not impossible, cf. the case of Eg. wp.t above).13 At the moment, both semantically and

The Chadic comparanda are WCh.: Hausa háú [-au < *-am?] „to mount” [Abr. 1962, 381] | NBauchi * wum- ~ * wun- (dissim.?) → * ‹m- „to mount, climb” [GT]: Pa’a wun "to climb, mount (animal)" [M.

phonologically, most attractive seems a connection with Sem.: Ar. √q(n)br,14 cf. qunbar-at- „2. crête au haut de la tête (chez certains animaux)”, qunburiyy- „qui a une crête au haut de la tête (oiseau)”, cf. also qibirr-āt- „gland de la verge” [BK II 659] = qanbūr- ~ qambūr- „bossu” [Dozy II 408], Syrian dial. qánbar I „hérisser (le coq les plumes de con cou pour se jeter sur la poule)”, tqámbar II „se montrer fier, hautain avec (qqn.), propr.: relever la crête, dresser la huppe”, qambūra and q‘mbara „crête de coq, 2. huppe, bosse”, qamb r „bossu et nain, petit bossu” [Barthélemy 1935, 683], Dathina √qnbr I „dresser la queue”, V „être hautain, lever la crête”, qunbar-at„crête de coq” [Landberg, GD 2531], Yemeni qanbūr „hunchback (also a surname)” [Piamenta 1990-1, 414] ||| SBrb.: Ghat γəbber, pl. γəbber-ăn „bosse postérieure (du chameau à deux bosses)” [PAM 2003, 269], cf. Ahaggar γubber „être écorché sur le dos en arrière de la bosse (le sujet étant un chameau)” [Fcd. 1951-2, 1690] < NAA *√"br „peak of a body part” [GT].
Earlier, I (Takács 2004, 70, #375) was disposed to assume in Eg. qb3.t ~ q3b.t an earlier *√qb" ~ *√q"b, a likely cognate − in spite of the irregular Eg. 3 vs. Sem. *« − to Sem. *quba«- „hood” [Mlt.-Sts. 1984, 37]15 ||| SCu.:
perhaps Iraqw qubu “hair” [Dempwolff, not attested in MQK 2002] ||| CCh.: PHigi *kwa0a" [< *"waba"] “brains” [GT]16 < presumably AA *"waba«- „top of head” [GT]. Although now this alternative seems significantly less convincing than that described above, we may, however, not exclude a remote relationship of both roots (*√"br „peak of a body part” vs. *√"wb« „top of head”) in the Afro-Asiatic parental language.
Eg. *qf3 „horn or top of head (?)” (GT, cf. Wb V 31) preserved by the hieroglyph depicting „the head and forepart of a ram” (PL) = „the head of a ram with horns” (GT) used as a (phonetic) determinative from Dynasty XXII on in Eg. qf3.t ~ qf3.w (from XXII.) “Ansehn” (XVIII.-GR, Wb V 31-32) = „dignity, awe, respect (it is a quality of gods, something frightening for foreigners to experience)” (PL 1055).17 It was C. T. Hodge (1966, 46) who has already ingeniously equated this hypothetic form with WCh.: Hausa "àfóó "horn" [Abr. 1962, 448], to
which now further cognates can be extended from a couple of Afro-Asiatic branches: Brb. *√γf(y) "head" [GT]18 ||| WCh. *"afa → *"afu "horn" [Stl. 1987, 211]19 || ECh.: Mubi-Toram *kōP- "1. top of head, 2. occiput" [GT].20 A special isogloss with a substantially shifted semantics (opposing the Egypto-Chadic match) is represented by Sem. *"apy- “occiput, back of the head” [Mlt.]21 ||| ECh.: Dangla- Migama *kUp- „neck” (originally < *„back of
and PCu. *"ar- „peak, top” [Ehret 1987, 43, #150]. (3) Later, Hodge (1981, 374, #47) changed his mind and affiliated Eg.
qb3.t with Ar. qubl- „front, face” (semantically uncertain) and even IE *ghebh-el- „head, gable”. 14 Following Dozy’s lexicon (l.c.), M. Piamenta (l.c.) also noted the connection of Ar. qanbūr- with Turkish kambur „bossu” [Dozy] = „1. Buckel (eines Menschen), 2. Buckel, Höcker, Erhöhung, Ausbuchtung, Beule, Wölbung, 3. bucklig, 4. gekrümmt, krumm, herausgewölbt, ausgebaucht, 5. was sich geworfen hat (spez. Holz)” [Steuerwald 1972, 478], which, in my view, can only be due to a borrowing from Arabic, not vice versa (as Prof. R. M. Voigt suggests now in his kind p.c., August 2015), given the Arabic background root, let alone the secondary nature of -mb- < -nb-. Biberstein Kazimirsky, in addition, derived all Arabic terms listed above from Ar. √qbr, which can only corroborate a native Arabic nature of the root. 15 Attested in Hbr. qōba« „helmet” | Aram. qubb‹«ā ~ qub«ā “hood” || Ar. qubba«-at- “cap, hat” || Geez qob« “monk’s hood,
headband, skullcap (under a turban) etc.” (Sem.: GB 705; Leslau 1987, 418). The Semitic term was, however, supposed to be a loan of ultimately Hittite origin (see Leslau 1987, 418). If, however, it comes from the Afro-Asiatic heritage, we should assume that its *-« (shared apparently with Chadic parallels) was a secondary root complement. 16 Cf. Higi-Nkafa kwà0ε, Higi-Baza kwàba, Higi Kamale ŋkwa0ε, Higi-Ghye kwà0a, Higi-Futu kwò0o", Fali-Kiria kwa0a, Fali-Gili gwR0wu, Fali-Jilbu gwR0àkũ, Fali-Muchella gwŒ0à, Fali-Bwagira gwQ0Œn (CCh.: Kraft 1981, #37).
17 It is possible, however, that the ram head determinative of qf3 was borrowed from Dynasty XXII on from the synonymous bfj.t as suggested in Wb l.c. In this case that above external etymology is to be given up. Besides, Eg. qf3.t [< *√qfr] is perhaps identical with WCh.: Hausa "árfíí “strength”, "árfáfá “to strengthen, encourage, urge, force, emphasize; become
strong” [Abr. 1962, 486-487]. 18 Reconstructed also as *a-γfi [IS] = *γpp [Rsl.] = *ī-γef [Vcl.] = *e-γrif (sic: *-r-, certainly an error) [Zhl. 1932-1933, 98] = *yV-γ[a]f [Mlt. 1991] = *i-γaf [Mlt. 1999].

the head”?) [GT].22 One might assume an AA *"afa"- ~ *"afay- "1. top of the head, horn, 2. back of the head,
occiput" [GT]23 to underlie with an areal parallel in PKoman *kup “head” [Bnd. 1983, 270, #38]. Noteworthy is that here too, the Egyptian term stands semantically the closest to the Chadic reflexes, which is in striking parallelism with PAA *"waba"-/*"waba«- “top of head” [GT] (cf. the preceding entry in this paper). Do these both reflect remote Proto-Afro-Asiatic root varieties?
„Skull”
Eg. dnn.t „Schädel, Kopf” (Med., Wb V 576, 13-17) is clearly identical with Sem.: Gurage *gunnän „head, hair of head, *top, summit” [Lsl.] = *gunnān/r „tête, chevelure” [DRS 148, GN" #21],24 which stands isolated in
Semitic. H. G. Mukarovsky (1987, 202-203) combined the Gurage word with ECh.: Sokoro gón-du „mein Kopf” [AF apud Lukas 1937, 33] = gón-di „mein Kopf” [Barth] = gon, pl. gòné „head” [Saxon 1977 MS, 3, #1, cf. JI 1994 II 183], but also with a number of parallels, which, however, reflect AA *√"n ~ *√ ̄n „head” [GT].25
Eventually, the latter may be regarded in the Afro-Asiatic Ursprache as a root variety of AA *√gnn „head” [GT] preserved by the Gurage-Egyptian (and -Sokoro?) isogloss. Any other eymology proposed so far for Eg. dnn.t is less convincing.26
„Forehead, face”
Eg. jn ~ OK-MK var. «n „Augenbraue” (Wb I 99, 1) = „eyebrow” (FD 23): the only etymology has so far been offered by W. F. Albright (1927, 206), who, along with a number of other (sometimes not even interrelated) Egyptian words, including Eg. jn “umgeben” (XVIII., Wb I 99) = “to surround, enclose” (FD 24), traced it back to his hypothetic *√n „to stretch”, which rightly evoked F. Calice’s (GÄSW 119, #499) objection: „wenn auch
diese Zusammenhänge wenigstens zum Teil durchaus möglich sind, so greifen sie doch m.E. über das von uns gegenwärtig Erfassbare hinaus”. Following the old tradition,27 most recently, J. Osing (2001, 576) was also convinced that for Eg. “jn Augenbraue (zusammen mit dem zugehörigen Verb jn umgeben, umranden) ... die
ältere, sicherlich ursprüngliche Form ist «n ”, which he, however, has tried to justify by ill-founded arguments. First, in support of the older «n Osing (l.c., fn. 99) cited a number of CT places28 that altogether comprise 23
occurences of our word, where «n is only attested 6 times, while j«n only twice, but the “younger” jn occurs
opinion of L. Kogan (SED l.c.), „’occiput, back of the head’ ... is the only one [GT: i.e., meaning] to account for such semantic shifts as ’back of the head’ > ’head’ > ’forehead’ and ’back of the head’ > ’back’ ...”
22 Cf. Dangla kòpò “nuque” [Fédry 1971, 295], Migama kúpó, pl. kòppìppá “nuque” [Jng.-Adams 1992, 102]. 23 For the Semito-Berbero-Chadic comparison see Müller 1975, 64; Rössler 1952, 139; IS 1971, #195; Militarev 1991, 264; 1999 MS, 6, #165; Blazek 1994, 428; HSED #1548; SED I 149, #164. If the Egyptian etymology is correct, we should modify the reconstruction of A. Ju. Militarev’s (1999 MS, #165 and SED I 149) PAA *-p- in this root (he figured as PAA *"apay-) to PAA *-f-. 24 Attested in Muher, Mäsqän, Gogot, Soddo gunnän, Chaha gunär, Ezha gunnär, Endegeny gutnor, Ennemor, Gyeto gun"är
(Gurage: Lsl. 1979 III 284). 25 NOm.: SEOmeto *"in- „head” [GT] Koyra (Badditu) qin-ē/ō [Crl.] = "in-e/o [Corlett, Bnd.] = "ín-e [Hyw.] = gín-ō ~ qín-ō [Mkr.], Haruro (Gats’ame) qin-o [CR] and (pace Müller 1975, 64) the Chadic reflexes of *√Qn „head” [GT] = *√kn [NM 1966, 236] = „Biu-Mandara” (CCh.) *√gn [Newman 1977, 27]. V. Blažek (1989 MS Om., 17, #55) correctly affiliated the NOm.-CCh. root with Ar. qunn-at- „1. sommet d’une montagne, 2. petite montagne ou montagne isolée du reste de la chaîne et noire vers la sommet” [BK II 817]. A root variety is presumably present in Ar. ma- ̄ann-at- „1. bout du nez, 2. col d’une
vallée, 4. tête, issue, entrée d’un chemin” [BK I 636]. 26 Thus, W. A. Ward (1963, 419, #4 and fn. 3; 1972, 19) assumed a semantically a priori doubtful connection with Hbr. [innā „shield”, [in[enet „jar”, which he derived from the basic sense carried by Ar. √[wn I „to protect”, II „to surround with, enclose”, [awn-at- „a kind of jar or bowl” remarking that it is „impossible to prove” whether Eg. dnn.t is a Semitic loan (which is, of course, out of the question for semanticalreasons) or represents a common Egypto-Semitic root. On the other hand, the comparison with Sem. *√gnn „to cover” suggested by C. T. Hodge (1981, 407) was labelled as „uncertain” by himself. Elsewhere, Hodge (1978, 2, #67; 1981, 372, #20) extended to Egypto-Semitic compariso onto Brb. *a-gyenna „sky” (where he mistakenly rendered the first radical as *γ) and CCh. *√gn „head” (in which, however, the *g- may not be reconstructed, but rather *"- or * ̄-, discussed above) and even IE *gen- „balled”. 27 Spiegelberg (in his KHW 84 pace K. Sethe), similarly Calice (l.c.: „ältere Schreibung «n ”), Fecht (1960, 177, #364). 28 Osing (l.c.): “S. CT IV 298/299b, 301c, 313bT2B3, V 32d, VI 123k = 124b, VII 159g” (sic).

in 15 instances (!).29 Surprisingly, Osing even quoted whole CT passages for «n , (!) which do not have even one
single (!) instance of «n (cf. CT IV 299b, IV 301c, IV 313b, VI 124b). One cannot be astonished enough at this kind of „presentation” of data. Secondly, since most forms display jn , it is no wonder that CT vars. are glossed as jn even most recently in DCT 41 – similarly to the one single instance of OEg. «n “Augenbraue” (V., ÄWb
I 156: glossed as jn !), which, Osing left unnoticed. Thirdly, the fact that there is one single OK var. with «- does
not alter a bit the Lautgeschichte of PEg. *jn > OEg. «n ~ *jn (together with PEg. *jn ̄ > OK «n ̄ ~ jn ̄ “to live”, below) as an early example of the change PEg. *j- > OEg. «- (hence later j-) in the proximity of and  ̄.
Moreover, the metathetic change of OEg. roots containing and a nasal (m, n) is known in a number of examples30. For all these reasons, I have to maintain (pace EDE I 91) the derivation of Eg. jn < *√rn < **√n r (via metathesis) from AA *√n r ~ *√nyr “eyebrow” [GT] attested in SBrb. *a-nhar “eyebrows, sourcil” [GT] = *a-enēr [Ajh.]31 ||| ECu. *nyār- „1. eyebrow, 2. forehead” [GT]32 ||| ECh.: Mokilko nyÄny"rÄ (pl.) “Augenbrauen” [Lukas 1977, 219].

[Bst.],34 and Lowland East Cushitic *na Zr „breast” [GT].35 In addition, the alleged “Ableitungsverbum”, i.e., Eg. jn „to surround”, which is only attested from the NK onwards with no trace of an earlier «n at all (as one might expect following Osing’s theory),36 and is, henceforth, hardly fitting as the direct derivational source of Eg. jn „eyebrow”37, suspiciously displays in fact the very same Lautgeschichte as Eg. jn ~ «n “eyebrow” (i.e.,

Basic sense dubious. Etymology disputed:40 (1) D. Meeks (1977, 81, fn. 1, cf. AL l.c.) explained it from a certain Eg. *mnd meaning "sg. round", whence he derived also Eg. mnd "breast" (q.v.), mndj "la panse (?)" (which presumably stems from the preceding). Following him, P. Wilson (PL 440) also maintains that Eg. *√mnd "seems to refer to sg. spherical in shape and thus to parts of the body such as the breasts, cheeks, eyeball". Improbable. The rendering "globe oculaire" is somewhat dubious in the light of Eg. bnr "ball of eye" (NK, CED 22; DLE I 156) < OK b33 (cf. EDE II 232). Eg. mndj, in turn, may be rather identical with Eg. mnd "breast" (q.v. above, cf. also DCT 170), which certainly represents a distinct Afro-Asiatic root. (2) G. Takács (1997, 229, #11; 2004, 61, #351): perhaps < *√mng related with the Ethiopian Wanderwort *mangāg- "jaw, chin" [GT]?41 The ultimate etymology of these forms is, however, obscure. As H.-J. Sasse (l.c.) remarked: "the ultimate source ... is hard to determine".42 At the first glance, *mangāg- resembles an m- prefix formation like *ma-ngag- < *√ngg, for which cf. SCu.: Dahalo n ̧a ̧e „jaw” [EEN 1989, 46]? If this derivation were true, we would have to give up the comparison with Eg. mnd.t.

E.g., L. Homburger (1931, 252) and E. Zyhlarz (1934-35, 173) combined it with Nubian: Kunuzi missi, Mahassi mańi "oeil". Absurd. In addition, Zyhlarz (1936, 444, fn. 1) ultimately connected this false parallel with Brb. (sic) mníd-ak "vor dir" < *emnīd-a-ka "in Bezug auf deine Vorderseite" < *mnid "nach vorne schauen" (sic). A.M. Lam (1993, 379), in turn, combined it with Ful (Pulaar) ma ̧nata "qui fait sourciller", which was rightly rejected by H.

Sasse (l.c.) thought of a borrowing either from Ethio-Semitic or Oromo, while G. Hudson (1989, 85) pondered a connection with HECu. *gānge "molars" [Hds.]. M.

Later, he (LS 1997, 461) combined the East Cushitic root with his PCu.-Om. *marg- > Wolayta morgiy-a "shoulder, hump", which is impossible.

(3) Alternatively, we might assume a root *mn- extended with an affix (?) -d occuring as C3 in a number of Egyptian anatomical terms (cf. Eg. psd, fnd, n d.t,  ̄nd), which would lead us to AA *ma/in- "forehead" [Blz.] = *√mn "front of head" [GT].43
Eg. 3.t "Vorderteil, A. eigtl. als Körperteil I. des Menschen, selten allgemein: Vorderseite, zumeist: Antlitz,
Stirn; II. eines Tieres: der Vorderkörper, Brust; B. Anfang von etwas" (PT-, Wb III 19-20) was, beside a nubmer of unsuccesful efforts,44 fairly convincingly connected by W. F. Albright (1918, 224 pace Ember) to Hbr. √ ll hifil „2. anfangen”, hofal „angefangen werden” [GB 233-4] = hifil „to begin”, hofal „to be begun” [KB 320], hence Hbr. tə illā „Anfang” [GB 875] = „beginning” [KB 1717]. This attractive suggestion, however, fails because of the entirely different semantic background of Sem. *√ ll „to untie” [KB]. Therefore, the etymology by G. Takács (2013, 162) remains at the moment as the only plausible one both semantically and phonologically, cf. Sem.: Geez √ wr: ora "to go forth, proceed etc." [Lsl. 1987, 249] ||| ECu. *hor- (with a different laryngeal)

Antlitz, Oberfläche, Seite, Gegend” (KHW 351) has up to now remained void of a convincing etymology.: (1) A. Ember (1913, 117, #64; 1917, 89, #141), followed by G. Thausing (1932, 292, fn. 1), F. von Calice (GÄSW 178, #723), and W. Leslau (1962, 66-67), assumed a (nowhere attested) original sense *„head” and equated it with Sem.: Mehri erê „head” [Jahn, Ember] = ere [Lsl.] = ə-rōh ~ ə-róh, pl. ə-r‘h [Jns. 1987, 310], cf. also Qishn erú „Kopf, Spitze, Höhe, Vorbgebirge” [Jahn]. Ember even quoted Bittner, who, just like W. Leslau (1945, 235) half of a century later, had already correctly analyzed in the Modern South Arabian word a prefix - + *reh < *res (displaying the SArabian shift of h < Sem. *š), which is identical with Sem. *ra"š„head”. Following this chain of derivation, Leslau (1962, l.c.) was undisturbed to even expressis verbis project the same segmentation onto Eg. r, „where - is also a prefix” (!), which, if this were true, would imply pure
anachronism as the shift of Sem. *š > h in certain Semitic languages is not at all to be observed in Egyptian, let alone that the common Afro-Asiatic nominal class marker * (Takács 1997) does not occur as prefix (only as
suffix) in Egyptian. By the way, the closest cognate of Sem. *ra"š- appears in Eg. 3js (cf. part I of „Layers ...”). (2) W. F. Albright (1927, 224) combined it with Ar. urr-at- „cheek (the name refers to the bright color of the cheek)” [Alb.] = „Wange (von der blühenden Farbe)” [Clc.], which, however, literally means only „3. franche, pure, intacte, vierge” [BK I 401] from the verbal root √ rr „devenir homme de condition libre” [BK I 400]. Albright arbitrarily isolated the Arabic word from urru-l-wağhi „what appears of the face or what appears of the
elevated part of the cheek, i.e., the ball, or most prominent place, of the cheek” hence "al- urr-at-u signifies „the

The ECu.Hina etymology is due to V. Blazek (2000, 182-3, §7), who compared this Afro-Asiatic root also with IE *mein- "face" [Blz.] (IE data: Jucquois, Orbis 16, 1967, 177-9; Tischler, HEG 1990, 197) and PDravidian *mun- "front" [DED #5020a]. 44 H. Holma (1919, 40) identified it with Akk. irtu „Brust” explained from Sem. * ir-t- (labelled „unsicher”), which was
listed by F. von Calice (GÄSW #703) among the dubious comparisons. As noted by Holma (l.c., fn. 1) himself, the Akkadian term was combined by C. Brockelmann (via metathesis) with Ar. ri"-at- „lung”, which rules out any connection with Eg. 3.t.
In order to avoid this, Holma arbitrarily considered the Arabic word as a loanword from Akkadian. Th. Schneider (1997, 201, #60), in turn, supposed a relationship with Ar. γurr-at- „1. weißer Stirnfleck bei Pferden, 2. Blesse, 3. Bestes, Schönstes (von einer Sache)”, although its basic sense is rather far from that of Eg. 3.t: „1. whiteness, cleraness of a colour or complexion,
2. a star or blaze or white mark on the forehead of a horse, the space itself of the face that is occupied by whiteness, (in a dog) a white speck or a small white spot above each of the eyes” [Lane 2238b], cf. also Bed. êra ~  ́la „1. weiße Farbe, 2. licht, rein, weiß” [Rn. 1895, 27] || ECu. *«a/irr- „white, grey hair” [Sasse 1982, 28].

He even included Eg. rr.t „blossom” in this (probably wrong)
comparison, which, in F. von Calice’s (GÄSW 178, #723) view, „ist abzulehnen, da das äg. Wort primär ’Kopf’ heisst”. This argumentation (inspired by Ember’s etymology above) is unacceptable. Albright’s proposal is false, since he disregarded the basic sense of the Arabic root. (3) V. Orel and O. Stolbova (1992, 185), in turn, equated Eg. r with their CCh. *hir- „face”, which was based,
in fact, solely on Daba hìrrra „1. eye, 2. face” [Kraft], for which, however, many more cognates are know, cf. still CCh.: Muyang er „1. eye, 2. face” [Smith], Mada èrè „œil” [Nkoumou], Zulgo aré „eye” [Haller], Gemzek ere „eye” [Sabatai], Mbazla "aray „eye” [Trn.] = àráy [IL] | Hide iri „eye” [Bramlett] | Zina ìrì „eye” [Odden] |
Vulum aray „yeux” [Trn.], Mbara ree „1. eyes, 2. face” [Trn.] | Gidar hara/a „eye” [Schuh] = hara [Hungerford] | Masa ira-no „1. eye, 2. face” [Kraft], Misme (Zime) ir „1. eye, 2. face” [Kraft], Banana irà „eye” [Kraft], Museye írí ~ íř „eye” [Kraft] || WCh.: Dera yerò „eye” [Kraft] | Burma yâr „1. eye, 2. face” [Kraft], Polchi yir „eye” [Kraft], Dwot "ir „eye” [Kraft], Seya y ̆r „eye” [Kraft], Buli "âr „eye” [Kraft]. The common source of all
these (and many further) Chadic cognates has been diversely reconstructed and is still a matter of controversies. R. Ma and P. Newman (1966, 234, #29) isolated a monoradical PCh. *-d- „eye”. Later, P. Newman (1977, 26) set up PCh. *idə „eye”. V. Orel and O. Stolbova (1990, 90, #47; HSED #112), in turn, reconstructed PCh. *"ir
„eye”, which they identified with Eg. jr.t „eye”. H. Jungraithmayr (JI 1994 I 60A) postulated PCh. *√ydn „eye”. R. Gravina (2014 MS, 61) has CCh. *haday. That is, most of the authors assumed a rhotacism in the parallels with -r- < *-d-. Consequently, the Afro-Asiatic parallels thereof are also disputed. In any case, there is little proof for an initial * -. All in all, so far only dubious suggestions have been published, neither of which is acceptable. I suspect Eg. r
therefore to derive ultimately from the same Afro-Asiatic root as Eg. h3.t „front” (above), i.e., AA *√ r „front” [GT]. Only their root derivational nominal stems were vocalized otherwise, which may have resulted in -r-/-3-.
Eg.  ̄nt "Gesicht, Vorderseite des Kopfes" (PT, Wb III 302, 1-5) is, as pointed out by G. Takács (2004, 193f.;
EDE III 511), akin to Sem.: MSA *√ ̄ns „to be in front (?)” [GT]: Harsusi  ̄ensī „one of the fore-teats of a camel” [Jns. 1977, 141], Jibbali  ̄ansí „front, front part of anything”,  ̄uns "outside", a ̄nís "to take, put out, go out in spring, etc." [Jns. 1981, 303], Mehri  ̄‹nsáy „front udder of a camel” [Jns. 1987, 445]. This root apparently stands isolated not only in Semitic, but the entire Afro-Asiatic family also.45 Thus, here, we may speak of an exclusive Egypto-Semitic isogloss. Formerly, besides, for Eg.  ̄nt, there had been suggested a great number of controversial etymologies, which are all problematic.46
45 As a remote root variety (with metathesis + different dental plosive) cp. perhaps also SBrb.: ETawllemmet & Ayr ə-nkəd "1. aller au devant de, 2. prévenir (par des mesures préventives)" [PAM 2003, 609]. 46 Neither of the suggested solutions is satisfactory: (1) H. Holma (1911, x; 1919, 42) treated it falsely as a fem. * ̄n.t (!) in order to equate it (via met.) with Akk. na ̄na ̄atu "Nasenscheidewand" [AHW 715] = na ̄na ̄ūti ša appi "die Nasenknorpel" [Holma], for which cp. rather Syr. na na tā "die
Mandeln im Halse", Ar. nuγnuγ- "Rachenmandel" (Sem.: AHW l.c.). (2) A. Ember 1918, 31; 1921, 177; 1926, 310, #6.2; ESS §11.d.2, §15.a.16, §25.b.8; W. F. Albright 1918, 90; 1918, 239, #74; F. Behnk 1928, 140, #38; HSED #1340: Eg.  ̄nt < * ̄mt via partial assim. of the labial *-m- to dental -t and the met. of * ̄tm ~ Akk.  ̄ussimmu "snout" [AHW 362] || PBHbr. ōsām "the distinctive feature of the face, nose, nostril" [Jastrow 1950, 431] | Ar.  ̄asm- "bec, museau" [BK I 596] = "snout, muzzle" [Alb.]. (3) There is a long tradition of comparing Eg.  ̄nt with WCh.: Hausa hánčí, pl. hántú-nà „nose” [Abr. 1962, 369] supported
by F. Behnk (1928, 140, #38), W. Vycichl (1934, 71), D. Ol’derogge (1952, 38; 1956, 12; 1960, 800), V. M. Illič-Svityč (1966, 336, #8.4), C. T. Hodge (1968, 20; 1981, 373, #30; 1983, 37; 1985, 18; 1990, 646, #13A; 1991, 160, §18). False, because (as pointed out in JI 1994 I, 129) the Hausa form can be divided into the ha- prefix of body parts + Ch. *-ntin/r „nose”. This Eg.-Hausa comparison was rightly rejected already by N. Pilszczikowa (1958, 99), who identified in Hausa hánčí the well-known Hausa prefix ha- occuring in Ch. names of body parts. (4) C. T. Hodge (1981, 373, #30; 1983, 37; 1985, 18; 1990, 646, #13A; 1991, 160, §18) combined the alleged Eg.-Hausa parallel with Ar.  ̄nn "to speak nasally", which contains no match for the Eg. C3. In addition, the basic sense of Eg.  ̄nt is
"front", not „nose”. (5) C. T. Hodge (1985, 18; 1990, 646, #13A): Eg. & Hausa ~ SCu. *ntse "in front" [Ehret]. (6) V. Blažek (1994 MS Bed., 19): ~ Bed. *hanat "before" [Blz.] attested in hánat-"āwi "forenoon", cf. "āwi "noon".
(7) Its long-range (Nostratic) comparison (often with the inclusion of Hausa hantii) with PIE *Hant- "Vorderseite, Stirn", loc. *Hanti "im Angesicht, Gegenüber" [IEW 48-49] has been maintained by several scholars (Forrer 1930, 243, #3; Ivanov 1965, 15-16; 1966, 106-107, fn. 9; Illič-Svityč 1966, 336, #8.4; Hodge 1968, 20; 1981, 373, #30; 1983, 37; 1991, 160, §18; Bomhard 1988, 446; Shevoroshkin 1988, 541; Ray 1992, 134, n. 15).

Eg. dhn.t „Stirn” (MK-, Wb V 478, 6-10; ÄWb II 2796) = „1. forehead” (FD 315) = „peak of brow” (pChester Beatty VII, Walker 1996, 321), metaphorically also used as dhn.t „Felswand, Bergvosprung, Bergspitze” (NK, Wb V 478, 11) = „mountain-top” (Amarna, FD 315), in fact *dĭ́hn.at (Vergote 1973 I b, 44, §37 and 147, §85; Vycichl 1990, 221) = *dĕ́hn. ̆t (NBÄ 400, n. 84) > Cpt. (S) tehne, (B) tehni „front” (CD 460b), hence denominative dhn „(den Boden) mit der Stirn berühren” (MK, Wb V 478-9) = „1. lit. Touch with the forehead, to bow to, 2. appoint, order” (FD 315): the underlying primary sense was figured by W. F. Albright (1918, 255, #130-133, cf. also ESS §11.a.60) as properly *„the lofty part” just like it is the case with Ar. ğabh-at-, and so he equated the deduced Eg. *√dhn „be high” (via metathesis) with Ar. √nhd „to be swollen and rounded (of breasts, skin-bottles)”, nahd- „female breast” (≈ wasb- „skin-bottle, big breast”), which represent by-form of Sem. *√n"d.
This suggestion was received by F. von Calice (GÄSW 223, #925) with right doubts. During my Afro-Asiatic etymological research I have found no cognates with the sense „forehead” either. The only thing I have to agree with Albright in any case is that the sense of Eg. dhn.t as an anatomical term must necessarily be secondary due to an Egyptian innovation from a primary PEg. *√dhn „be high”, the only acceptable cognates of which I have so far detected in West Chadic, cf. Angas-Sura *Tyeŋ ~ *Tya2ŋ (or *ƒy
2eŋ ~ *ƒy
2a2ŋ) “1. upper part, 2. up” [GT],47
which has a possible root variety in Angas-Sura *siŋ (var. *suŋ?) > *s‹ŋ “1. high, 2. upper part, 3. sky” [GT].48 Chadic *ŋ has been known as a possible result of an earlier plain nasal (*m or *n) + lost pharyngeal or laryngeal (cf. IS 1966, 33, fn. 11; CLD I 10).
„Chin, jaw”
Eg. jn« „Kinn” (PT 1308a-, Wb I 94, 12; ÄWb I 153b) = „chin” (FD 23), occuring also as fem. jn«.t „menton”
(5x in pSmith, FD 23; Lacau 1970, 64; HAM 168), was later transformed via reduplication and metathesis also into «n«n „Kinn” (NK, Wb I 191, 13) = „chin” (FD 43). Its origin is not yet evidently clear, although it has been
much disputed in the etymological literature. We know a couple of tempting proposals:49 (1) A. Ember (1926, 7, §10) combined it at a time (!) with both OHbr. (hapax) *loă« (only attested in st. cstr.) „jaw-bone” [Ember] (with the remark that it „appears also as” Eg. «r at the same time ..., cf. below) and Ar. nī«
„palais (partie supérieure du dedans de la bouche)” [Dozy II 742, not in BK or Lane] = „jaw, mandible” [Ember], which, of course, cannot be true in this form at the same time. A connection with OHbr. *loă« seems rather dubious due to Eg. j- ≠ Sem. *-w-/*-Ø-, whereas the phonological agreement between Eg. jn« vs. Ar. √ny« is perfect in the light of the law of Belova, i.e., Eg. Iae j- = Sem. IIae *-y-/*-ī- (cf. EDE I 394-400). Following the suggestion by G. Takács (EDE I 39), in addition to the Arabic root, WCh.: Boghom ŋa [GT: possible < *n«a] „chin” [Gowers in JI 1994 II 76] || CCh.: Zime-Dari nyan [partial redupl. < *nya«-n(ya«)?] „chin” [Str. in JI 1994 II 77] might also be included here < AA *√ny« „chin (?)” [GT]. Noteworthily, the Egyptian term forms special isogloss with the Chadic parallels, whereas the Semitic counterpart seems to have undergone a semantical shift. (2) C. T. Hodge (1968, 22), in turn, compared the later Eg. metathetic «n«n with LECu.: Somali «an ~ «ān „Kinnbacken, -lade, Backe, Wange”, labáda «an „beide Kiefer” [Rn. 1902, 59] = «án, pl. «ám-án „cheek” [Abr. 1964, 13] = „chin” [Hodge] = «an „cheek, Backe, Wange” [Farah & Heck 1993, 187] = „inside of mouth next to

Lacau (1970, 64) on a connection with Ar. daqan- „menton, barbe du menton”, which was rightly questioned by himself („Mais il s’agirait là de concordances phonétiques actuellement isolées; on doit laisser de côté cette hypothèse.”) and definitely excluded by W. A. Ward (1972, 20, #161) with full right „as the phonetic shifts involved are impossible”.

cheek” [Blz.] and WCh.: Sura g‹n „Wange” [Jng. 1963, 66], which is not void of problems. First of all, Hodge ignored that Somali Auslaut -n# may well originate in *-m#, which used to be revealed by the nominal plural forms. This the case here too: L. Reinisch (l.c.) recorded Somali pl. «am-án, which he (probably mistakenly)
connected with NOm.: Kafa gam-o „guancia” [Cecchi] = gám-ō „Wange, Backe” [Rn. 1888, 285] and Kunama ggm-ā „Kiefer, Backen, Kinn” [Rn. 1890, 49], which lead us to a phonologically certainly entirely distinct AfroAsiatic root (cf. Eg. gm3 and gm .t). For semantical reasons, it is difficult to agree with V. Blažek’s (1994 MS Bed., 26) ill-founded ECu. *«an- „cheek” combined by him with SCu.: Dahalo « ́na „tongue”, which, besides,
Ch. Ehret (1980, 274) set in a quite different South Cushitic context. Secondly, one can hardly ignore the oldest form of our Egyptian term as attested in PT 1308a. (3) A. Ju. Militarev (MM 1983, 255) envisaged Eg. jn« < *√yl« and affiliated it with Akk. lē/ītu „1. cheek, 2. side” [CAD l 148] = „Backe, Wange, Seite” [AHW 546]50 || Hbr. mətallə«ōt (pl.) and metathetic var. *maltə«ōt (hapax in st. cstr., Ps. 58:7) „jawbones” [KB 654] = malte«ōt (sic) and metal«ōt (sic) „tooth” [MM] | JAram. lū«ā ~ lō«ā „jaw” [Jastrow 1940, 700] = lw« „jaw” [Sokoloff 1990, 280] = „чeлюcть” [MM], Syr. lū«ā „maxilla”
[Brk. 1928, 361] = „чeлюcть” [MM] < Sem. *lV«- [MM], which he regarded as a var. to his Sem. *lV y„чeлюcть” [Mlt.] = *li (a)y-(at)- „cheek, jaw” [SED I 161, #178]. Excluding Akk. lē/ītu from the reflexes of
this root set up as Sem. *lVγ- „jaw”, L. Kogan (SED I 160, #177) included also Akk. la ̄û [Kogan 1995: - ̄possible < i.a. *-γ-] „jaw” [CAD l 44] = „Kinnbacken, Kinnlade” [AHW 528]51 || OT Hbr. hapax (Pr 23:2) *loă« (attested in st. pron.: lo«e-kā) „Kinnbacke (Delitzsch, Strack et al.: Kehle, Schlund)” [GB 388] = „jaw-bone” [Ember] = „gullet” [KB 532] = „gullet or jaw” [Kogan] || Mehri-Qishn lγənôn „double chin” [SSL 1985-6, 281]. Eventually, Kogan did not exclude a remote connection of Sem. *lVγ- „jaw” and *li (a)y-(at)- „cheek, jaw”. (4) G. Takács (EDE I 39) supposed an extra-Afro-Asiatic affiliation, cf. PCKhoisan *!ani „chin” [Baucom 1972, 19], which, however, does not exclude the derivation from AA *√ny« „chin (?)” [GT] (described above, #1).
Eg. «r.t „der Unterkiefer, die Kinnbacken” (OK, Wb I 209, 2) = „jaw(bone)” (FD 45) = „jaw” (DCT 175), which was later transformed (just like Eg. jn« above) via reduplication into «r«r „ein Körperteil” (BD, Wb I 210, 6) =
„chin (?)” (FD 45), has also been controversially evaluated in the etymological literature. So its origin is still dubious: (1) A. Ember (1918, 31; 1926, 7, #10; 1926, 302, #10), followed by W. F. Albright (1918, 85) and F. von Calice (GÄSW #138) combined it (assuming a metathesis) with the OT Hbr. hapax *loă« (only attested in st. cstr.)
„Kinnbacke (Delitzsch, Strack et al.: Kehle, Schlund)” [GB 388] = „jaw-bone” [Ember] = „throat” [Ward pace Dahood] = „gullet” [KB 532] = „gullet or jaw” [Kogan], which was declined by W. A. Ward (1972, 19, #138). (2) F. Behnk (1927, 81, #7), in turn, searched its cognates in a semantically close homorganic Semitic root, cf. Hbr. lə ī „chin, jawbone, cheek” [KB 525] = „Kinnbacken” [Behnk] and Ar. la y- „jaw(bone), jowl” [WKAS II
401], which is certainly to be abandoned as the irregular Eg. «- vs. Sem. *- - plus the metathesis at a time are to be rightly considered as hardly credible. (3) P. Lacau (1970, 77, §196), whom W. A. Ward (l.c.) also sided with, explained it from Eg. √«rj „to go up”
arguing that „c’est la mâchoire inférieure, celle qui est mobile, qui monte et qui descend”. A bit far-fetched of a name for the lower jawbone. Following Lacau’s way, one might expect it to have been named just as well from Eg. h3j „to descend”. (4) It seems tempting at the first glance to connect the Eg. root with PCu. *«al- „cheek” [Ehret 1987, 78, #324]
based by Ch. Ehret (l.c.) and N. Skinner (1995, 29) on the comparison of ECu.: Oromo ill-ē ~ hill-ē „cheekbone, cheek” [Gragg 1982, 224], Oromo-Bitima ill-ē „temple (of forehead)” [Stroomer 2000, 155] | Yaaku εl, pl. εlmô" „cheek” [Heine 1975, 123] || SCu. *«oŝ- (sic: *-ŝ-) „cheekbone” [Ehret] and some further (certainly false) comparanda.52 The problem is, however, that, on the one hand, the reconstruction of PCu. *«- (lost in the quoted
50 The etymological position of the Akkadian term has long been disputed. H. Holma (1911, 33) equated it with OTHbr. (hapax) *loă«. W. von Soden (AHW 546, 565) assumed it to share the same Semitic root with Akk. lu"u „Schlund” combined by him with Aram. and MHbr. lō/ū«ā, which were then disconnected by L. Kogan (1995, 160) maintaining that our Akkadian term is unrelated with OTHbr. (hapax) *loă« „гopтaнь”, PBHbr. loă« and JAram. lū«ā , which are better to be related, in his view, with Akk. lu""u ~ lu ̄ ̄u „throat” [CAD l 258] = „Schlund” [AHW 565] = „гopтaнь” [Kogan]. Later, Kogan (SED I 161, #178) derived it from his Sem. *li (a)y-(at)- „cheek, jaw”. 51 Equated by W. von Soden (AHW l.c.) rather with the reflexes of Sem. *√l y. 52 Ch. Ehret’s comparanda were merely Yaaku + Bed. "ali „calf of leg” [Roper 1928], which is semantically untenable. N. Skinner (1995, 29) added Oromo and South Cushitic (misquoted from Ehret 1980, 278).

East Cushitic languages) is solely pending on the South Cushitic data, which reflect *-ĉ- (not *-ŝ-) and this is speaking for a quite different Afro-Asiatic origin.53 On the other hand, one may not ignore the stubborn semantic difference between Cushitic „cheek” (attested quite uniformly with not one instance for „jaw) vs. Egyptian „jaw” even when these sense are sometimes related. (5) Most inspring appears a possible cognacy with LECu. *√«ll „пepeжёвывaть жвaчкy” [Dlg. 1972, 141] = *«alal- „to chew” [OS] based on Somali «álal „Kropf der Vögel, der erste Magen wiederkäuender Tiere, chymus, das Wiederkäuen”, caus. «alal-ī „das Kauen verrichten, (wieder)kauen” [Rn. 1902, 57] = «alal-inayya „to chew” [Abr. 1964, 10] and Oromo alal-a „ruminazione, rimasticazione” [Thiene 1939, 15] = alZl-ā „chymus, das aus dem Magen Wiederkäuer aufgestoßene Gras”, alāl-fad „wiederkäuen” [Rn.], which V. Orel and O. Stolbova (HSED #1063) affiliated with Ar. √«ll I: «alla „1. donner à boire à qqn. une seconde fois peu de tempts après la première, et métaph.: frapper, battre une seconde fois, réitérer ses coups”, pass. «ulla „être mangé, consommé;
avoir déjà servi à manger” [BK II 334]. The semantic motivation in this case might be the same as with Eg. wgj.t ~ wgw.t discussed in the following entry.
Eg. wgj.t (PT 686 var. wgw.t)54 „Unterkiefer, Kinnlade” (OK-, Wb I 376, 3-5) = „jaw” (FD 71), act. *wắgw. ̆t (NBÄ 187) = *wagya.t, hence *wayga.t and *wagga.t, later *wa3ga.t (DELC 242) > Dem. wggj „Unterkiefer” (DG 103:1) = > (S) ouo(o)[e, ouoi[e etc. „jaw, cheek” (CD 512b) = „Kinnbacken, Unterkiefer, Wange” (KHW 287) = „mâchoire, joue” (DELC 242). Its deverbal derivation from Eg. wgj „kauen” (OK-, Wb I 376, 1-2) has been commonly accepted.55 Nevertheless (having checked DRS and DRB), the IIIae inf. verbal root, which did not survive into Coptic in this form, has apparently no cognates in North Afro-Asiatic with the sense „to chew”.56 All this makes the impression that we are dealing here with a reverse, i.e., denominal derivation. This may formerly have been the conviction of A. Ember (1913, 118, #71) and M. Cohen (1947, #501) too, who equated Eg. wgj.t with Ar. wağh- „face, side” [Ember] = „Gesicht, Seite, Fassade, Richtung” [Calice] with special regard to Eg. wgj „rib (or side) of a ship” (Ember, FD 71), which, however, was righly objected already by F. von Calice (GÄSW #577) regarding this etymology as „unwahrscheinlich, da die Grundbedeutung verschieden scheint”, let alone that Ar. -h- is not reflected in the supposed Egyptian cognate at all. The same criticism was expressed by P. Lacau (1970, 59, §145) too: „En réalité le sens est trop différent et le redoublement de la voyelle exige que le radical ait comporté un j ou un 3 final.” The right path towards the true external cognates of Eg. wgj.t was discovered by D. J. Wölfel (1955, 42), when he affiliated it with some of the reflexes of NBrb. *-ggay „1. jaw, 2. face” [GT]: medieval Shilh a-gžay-en (or a-kšay-en) „parties inférieures des joues” [Ksm.], Shilh a-gža „mâchoire”, a-gži-wn ~ a-lži-wn (sic: -lž-) „1. (les deux) côtés du visage, 2. le bas des joues” [DRB 753] = a-gžay „molaire” [Ksm.], Ntifa ta-gžay-t „joue” [DRB] | Tamazight a-ggay ~ a-gga, pl. aggay-n „joue, bajoue, mâchoire”, ta-ggay-t, pl. ta-ggay-in „(petite) joue” [Taïfi 1991, 172], Zayan, Sgugu a-ggai, pl. a-ggai, also fem. ta-ggai-t „joue” [Lbg. 1924, 546], Ndir, Ishqern, Zemmur, Warain a-ggay, pl. a-ggay-n „joue” [Wölfel], Izdeg a-ggay ~ a-ˆ ̧ay, pl. a-ggay-n ~ a-ˆ ̧ay-n „joue, mâchoire” [Mercier 1937, 147, 282] = a
gžay „joue, mâchoire” [Ksm.] | Figig a-ggay ~ a-kkay „joue” [Ksm., DRB], Rif a-ggai ta-ggaš-t „joue” [Justinard 1926, 135], Iboqqoyen and Uriaghel (t)a-ggay-(t) „joue” [Rns. 1932, 354] | Iznasen (t)a-ggay-(t) „joue” [Rns. 1932, 354] = (t)a-ggay-(t) „joue” [DRB], Mzab a- ̧ ̧ay, pl. i- ̧ ̧ay-ən ~ a- ̧ ̧ay-ən „joue” [Dlh. 1984, 71], Wargla a-ggay, pl. a-ggay-ən „pommette des joues” [Dlh. 1987, 107], Shawya a-ggay „joue” [DRB] | Nefusa a- ̧ ̧ay „mâchoire” [Wölfel, DRB] etc. (Brb. data: Kossmann 1999, 166, #449 and 228, #698; DRB 917). Then, V. Orel and O. Stolbova (1992, 185; HSED #990) made the second step exploring the Chadic cognates they reconstructed as CCh. *guy(i)- „chin, beard” [OS], which was based, in fact, on Lamang (Hitkala) góyó „Kinn” [Lukas 1964, 107] | PMandara *gwVy- „1. chin, 2. beard” [GT] > Dghwede gẁyé „beard” [Frick/JI 1994
53 Correctly, this is SCu. *«oĉ- „cheekbone” [Ehret 1980, 278], in which, in this case, *-ĉ- has nothing in common with *-l-, cf.

54 J. Osing (NBÄ 187) regarded this PT var. as the older form. P. Lacau (1970, 59, §145), however, set up the root as √wgj. 55 See Grapow 1954, 43 (lit. „Kauknochen”); Vergote 1965, 60; Lacau 1970, 59, §145; NBÄ 187; KHW 288 (lit. „Kauer”); DELC 242 (lit. „celle qui mâche” conceived by W. Vycichl as an „ancien participe actif”). 56 Strangely, it is only attested in Coptic in its late reduplication, cf. (S) ouo{oue{, ou{b{, (L) oua{oue{ etc. „to chew, crush” (CD 513b) = „kauen, nagen, zerfressen, zermalmen, zerstümmern” (KHW 288) = „mâcher, ronger, broyer” (DELC 243). In principle, the Coptic reflex, esp. in its late sense „to crush”, might be forced together with Sem. *√wg" > Ar. wağa"a „frapper (avec un couteau ou la pomme de la main), taper, donner une tape, 3. écraser, châtrer (un bélier par écrasement, en lui comprimant les testicules)” [BK II 1486-7] || Soqotri "oge „to hit” [Lsl.] = "ege „frapper” [DRS] || Geez wag"a ~ wag«a „to pierce, prick, butt, gore, beat, hit, strike, make turbid, etc.” [Lsl.] = „frapper (de la corne), percer, écraser” [DRS] (Sem.: Lsl. 1987, 607; DRS WG"/«), but regarding its original sense „to push, strike”, the Semitic root stands substantially distinct etymologically from Eg. wgj „to chew”.

Most recently, G. Takács (2004, 52, #333) has identified the Cushitic relatives of Eg. wgj.t, namely ECu. (actually, PKonso-Dullay) *gaw- „jaw” [Lmb.] = *gawgaww- [GT] > Konso kawk-á (m), pl. kawkaww-á „jaw” [Lmb.] | Dullay: Harso and Dobase káwkaww-o (pl. káwkaww-e) „Backenzahn” [AMS 1980, 167], Gawwada kawkaww-o „Kiefer” [AMS 1980, 252] = kawkaww-e „jaw” [Lmb.] (ECu.: Lamberti 1987, 533). All these cognates speak for a PAA *√gwy, whence one may derive − in the light of Belova’s law (i.e., Eg. Iae w- < AA IIae *-w/u-, cf. EDE I 394-400) − absolutely regulary also Eg. wgj.t ~ wgw.t.
Eg. *bj3 “tusk (?)” may be deduced from the phonetic value bj3 of the sign depicting a tusk (Wb I 436-442). Following the suggestion by G. Möller (1900, 151) to render this sign in bj3 as „der Schnabel der Gußgefäßes”, A. H. Gardiner (1927, 454: F18), too, assumed that the tusk hieroglyph „in words reading bj3 ... is possibly not a tooth, but a metal spout”, the existence of which, however, has not yet been satisfactorily corroborated in a lexicoraphical context, whereas the Afro-Asiatic data, on the contrary, seem to confirm the existence of an Eg. *bj3 “tusk” reflecting sg. like *√b"l, cf.

Eg. d "Kinnbacken" (XVIII. in a very old text, Wb III 210, 11; GHWb 574) could be, of course, following an
often misleading egyptological tradition,62 explained from the homophonous Eg. d „white” provided one had parallel evidence for this semantic shift.

bite, chew” [GT], cf. Ar. «TT „mordre à qqch., saisir avec les dents, et y enfoncer les dents” [BK II 276] ||| WCh. *H/«aH- „to bite, chew” [Stl. 1991 MS, 7; 1995, 61]. A remotely related root variety (with a different pharyngeal
as C1 and a nasal root extension as C2) is represented by SCu.: Dahalo unH- [ - < *«- irregular] „to chew” [EEN 1989, 27] || HECu. *inE- „to chew” [Hds. 1989, 413] < PCu. *√ nH „to chew” [GT]. Alternatively, if one works with the basic sense „lower (jaw)”, Eg. d might be perhaps affiliated with Ar. aTīT
„1. bas, partie ou point extrême ou bas d’une chose, 2. abîme, 3. pied d’une montagne” [BK II 445] = „périgée, lieu d’une planète le plus proche de la terre” [Dozy II 297]. One wonders whether Eg. n d.t “tooth” (OK, Wb II 304, 5-8) conceals the same root as Eg. d. Should we treat it as identical with PCu. *√ nH „to chew” [GT], its C2 extension -n- becoming a C1 prefix n-? Or was it perhaps a nisba nj “which belongs to”? In this latter case, one might render it as *nj- d.t as *“which belongs to the jaw”.
„Throat”
Eg. jw3j.t "Kehle (des Gegners, der durchbohrt wird) (?)" (GR, WB I 49, 19) = "encolure (d'un bovin)" (Ramses II, cf. KRI II 318:15, AL 79.0125) = "throat" (Edfu, PL 49): for P. Wilson (PL l.c.) the sense of the Ramesside occurence "seems to be the 'neck and throat' of a bull' ... in origin the term may be connected with Õw3 'bull'", i.e., one should accept here a nisbe form *jw3.j.t „belonging to ox”, which appears to be rather far-fetched. More realistic would be to assume pace Belova’s Law (described most recently in EDE I 394-399) a shift from *wiry-, which O.V. Stolbova (1996, 90-91; OS 1992, 186) has long convincingly affiliated with PCh. *√wr "neck" [NM 1966] = *w‹ra [Nwm.] = * a-wuyar [Stl.] = *( V)-wurya(t) [Blz. 2001, 499, #10] (Ch.: JI 1994 II 252-3), which represent a good Egypto-Chadic match.

É. Orel and O. V. Stolbova (1992, 186) have compared Eg. jz.t “gullet” to their hypothetic WCh. *raμ- “neck”, but from their article it is not clear before me which WCh. word (perhaps Tangale?) is meant by this reconstruction. Any connection to NBrb.: Qabyle √rz > ruz „être creux (arbre)”, u-riz „creux du tronc d’un arbre” [Dallet 1982, 746]?

LECu.: Oromo boqq-ū “1. neck, 2. back of neck, 3. stubborn” [Gragg 1982, 59] ||| WCh.: Fyer 0àgyì, "e-0àgyì, pl. 0agìgyí “neck (Hals, Nacken)” [Jng. 1968, 7, #50; 1970, 84, cf. JI 1994 II, 252].
Eg. bb.wj (dual) "die Schlüsselbeine (claviculae)" (Med., Wb I 455, 3; GHWb 251) = „collar-bones” (FD 82), hence bbj.t "die Schlüsselbeinregion am Körper, Kehle" (Med., Wb I 455, 4; GHWb 251) = „region of throat”

for „tooth”, whose etymological position is, however, disputable. Cf.

These reflexes speak for PAngas-Sura *ha3γa3s → *aγas “tooth” [GT] = *agas [Stl.] = *haγas “tooth” [Dlg.] with the typical medial *-γ- (cf. Dolgopolsky 1982), which seems to point to two different scenarios of segmentation. Thus, our word might be either traced back to *√hs (or sim., but this is hardly equal with AA *√«H, since Angas-Sura *-s# is not compatible with AA *-H > *-T > Angas-Sura *-t#) with an infixed *-γ- < **- - or to prefixed AA * - + *gas (or sim., which is, however, a distinct root). In either cases we are dealing with the
common AA affix attested in body part names (cf. Takács 1997). Henceforth, the Angas-Sura word is irrelevant here. 67 H. G. Mukarovsky (1987, 271) derives the Chara word from AA *√br “neck” [GT]. Suffix -k-?

(FD 82) → bb.t "Kehle, Kehlkopf" (GR, Wb I 455, 6). There is no evident etymology as yet. A number of plausible alternatives may be considered: (1) Semantically, most tempting is an equation with Sem.: Akk. (a/jB) bubūtu „(Wagen-)Achse” [AHW 135] ||| WCh.: Kofyar bàb „shoulders, horizontal part” [Ntg. 1967, 1]. Was Eg. *bb (sg.) „collar-bone” orig. considered as *„horizonatal axis (of the body)”? Any connection to CCh.: Bachama baapa "wing" [Carnochan 1975, 466] | Buduma bībi "Oberarm" [Lukas 1939, 92]? Areal parallel: PBantu *-bàbá "wing" [Guthrie 1971, 118]. (2) With special regard to Med. bbj.t and LEg. bb.t, cp. alternatively LECu.: Somali-Jabarti babául-ä, pl. babaulayZl-ki "Luftröhre" [Rn. 1904, 52]. (3) If Eg. bb.t primarily denoted the cavity between the clavicula and the throat, it would be tempting to identify it with PCu. *bab- „armpit” [GT] = *bob- "armpit" [Ehret]68 as suggested by a number of authors,69 which seems to be the most convincing etymology for Eg. bb.wj. (4) G. Takács (2000, 72, #1.3) related Eg. bb.wj to AA *bub- „breast” [GT].70 In addition, he (Takács 1996, 46, #9; 1996, 136, #30; 1997, 254-255, #5.4) suggested an ultimate relationship of PCu. *bab- „armpit” [GT] and AA *bub- „breast” [GT], which is semantically problematic.
Eg. mr.t "Kehle o.ä. eines Gottes (von der m3«.t 'Wahrheit' gebraucht, die ihm gereicht wird)" (GR, Wb II 107,
7) = "gorge" (Lefébvre 1952, 22) = "gorge, gosier" (Berlandini, LÄ IV 85; AL II 167, #1786; cf. Blackman, JEA 22, 1936, 105; Fairman, ZÄS 91, 1964, 8, vii) = "throat, voicebox, larynx" (Walker 1996, 269) = "throat, gullet (associated with Hathor and Maat regarded as the throat of god by which air and food were given to him)" (PL 445):71 its meaning and etymology are to be treated with reservations due to the very late attestation: (1) G. Lefébvre (1952, 22 & fn. 9), J. Berlandini (LÄ IV 85), W. Guglielmi (1991, 14), and P. Wilson (PL 445) identified it with OK mr.t "songstress" (PL) as an "incarnation de la chanteuse-chironome antique, officiante ..." (Berlandini) = "organ over which the songstress had particular authority" (Wilson), although Wilson seems to be undetermined whether the association of both lexemes with Eg. m3«.t was because "the three concepts make a
potent pun" being interchangeable as they "may have sounded the same in sounding" in the GR era.
(2) GT: both LEg. mr.t "throat" and OK "songstress" are perhaps connected with WCh.: Hausa múryà "1. voice, 5. throat extracted from chicken" [Abr. 1962, 687], Gwandara murya "voice" [Skn. 1992, 356], which would not exclude the first etymological option above.72 (3) I have combined it elsewhere (Takács 1996, 136, #30; 1997, 226, #3 2004, 61-62, #353) alternatively with ECu. *marmar- "neck" [Sasse],73 to which a great number of extra-Afro-Asiatic areal parallels may be adduced

D. Meeks (2000, 239, n. l) observed a certain mr.t (?) (flesh det.) in Ostr. Petrie 36 = Ostr. DeM 1696, rt. 1 "désignant une pièce de boucherie ou une partie du corps (humain ou animal)" (not listed in the standard lexicons, cf. also Grandet 1999, 15, n. 68), although he regarded "un rapprochement avec mr.t 'gorge' ..." as "très hasardeux" in spite of "des graphies de ce mot" (listed in Guglielmi 1991, 113) that are "assez proches de celles de nos ostraca".
72 It is to be borne in mind that, in theory, there "could" be an etymological connection between Hausa murya 'voice' and wúyà 'neck' [Abr. 1962, 937] as confirmed to me by P. Newman (p.c., 13 Nov. 2006), although he has "never been able to find good internal or comparative evidence to show that this is so. Semantically, there is no problem. Phonologically, however, the connection is problematic. Murya comes from *muri (the ya being a feminative suffix and not part of the stem) whereas wuya (where the /y/ is part of the stem) comes from *wura (or some such), the *r to y change being well documented. Initial /m/ in Chadic is generally quite stable, and so it would be hard to explain an *m to /w/ change that would be required if wuya went back to the same proto-form. And then, contrary to common practice among certain Chadicists, one cannot simply ignore vowels, i.e., the final -i in one case, final -a in the other". Cf.

as suggested already by M.L. Bender (1975, 177, §56.12) and H.C. Fleming (1983, 456), cf. Nilo-Saharan *mor(??) "neck" [Bnd. 1994, 1161, #56] > PKuliak *morok "throat" [Ehret 1981, 92; Flm. 1983, 470], ESudanic *mur(u)t "neck" [GT], ENilotic *-murut- "neck" [Vossen 1982, 455].74 In the light of H.-J. Sasse’s (l.c.) theory on the internal (innovative) derivation of the East Cushitic word,75 one wonders if there may be any connection to WBrb.: Zenaga a-marti "nuque" [Bst. 1909, 242] ||| ECh.: Sokoro mórol-dxm "dein Schlund" [Lks. 1937, 36]. Here too, no cognates emerge in Semitic.76
Eg. tj.t "die Kehle" (PT, Wb III 181): in his unpublished etymological files,77 P. Behrens (in the early 1980s?)
compared it with HECu.: Burji kúE-ō "nape of neck" ||| NOm.: Zala "oTiy-ā "neck", Wolamo and Gofa "oT-e "neck" | Kafa "ess-ō "neck", Mocha "äss-ó "throat". Phonologically, it is not to be excluded in the light of a few convincing instances of the irregular correspondence of Eg. * vs. AA *".78 Later, however, Behrens (1987, 243,
§9) identified Eg. tj with Afar «adey-ta "larynx" [PH 1985, 50], in which too, both the An- and Inlaut consonant would be irregular.
Eg.  ̄«m "der Hals (vorn an der Speiseröhre), Kehle" (MK, Med., Wb III 243, 19-20) ||| NOm.: Dizi-Jeba kùm
"neck" [Flm. 1990, 28]. No Semitic cognates here either. On the contrary, E. Zyhlarz (1934-35, 172) assumed an extra-Afro-Asiatic origin combining the Egyptian word with Kunuzi komkom "Halsknorpel, Kehle".
Eg.  ̄ ̄ "1. (PT-) der Hals des Menschen, 2. (Lit. MK-) die Kehle" (Wb III 331) = „neck, throat” (FD 197), act.

ECu. *marmar- was borrowed into Eth.-Sem.: Harari märmär "shoulder", Gurage *märmär [Lsl.]: Chaha, Ennemor, Gyeto mämär etc. "nape of neck", Zway marmara "hump of the neck" (ES: Leslau 1963, 111; 1979 III, 406; 1988, 195). 74 SOm.: Galila murut "neck" derives (pace Fleming 1983, 456) probably from Nilotic. 75 He derived ECu. *marmar- "neck" from ECu. *mar- "round, to roll up" via the mediator meaning *"to turn around", which is possible, cf. PIE *kwol-so- "Hals" > Lat. collum "Hals, Bergjoch", Germ. Hals < PIE *kwel- "drehen" [IEW 639-640]. 76 Note that Ar. "amri"-at- "oesophage" [BK II 1086] = mari"- "oesophage, conduit alimentaire" [Dozy II 577] derives internally from Ar. mara"a "2. manger qqch." [BK], whereas Yemeni Ar. marīn "gullet" from √mr" II "to whet an appetite"
[Piamenta 1990, 463]. 77 I owe thanks to V. Blažek (Brno, Czechia) for passing over this precious collection of files he obtained in Cologne as a Humboldt research fellow in 1994. P. Behrens seems to have collected Afro-Asiatic parallels to Egyptian roots. 78 Cf. (1) Eg. tj "Rauch" (PT, Wb III 182, 9-11) ||| Sem. *√"sr "Rauch" [WUS #2404], (2) Eg. pt "to create " (XVIII., FD

The parallel forms with *k- vs. *"in East Cushitic are still to be explained. In the view of H.-J. Sasse (1982, 116), perhaps ECu. *k- is to be set, not *"-. According to W. Leslau (1988, 197), the HECu. forms with "-/q- are loans from Oromo, whereas those with k- were
borrowed into Gurage kokke, kokki "throat, Adam's apple". 80 Cf. (?) Iraqw -qunqu [nasal infix?] *"throat (?)" deduced from ala-qunqu "nape" ala- "behind" [Ehret] vs. gugi "throat" [Flm.] | Ma'a mkokéra ~ m ̄o ̄éra "throat" [Ehret] | Dahalo "ò"o "neck" [Flm.] = "o"o "throat" [Ehret & EEN 1989, 19]
(SCu.: Ehret 1980, 253). 81 In the opinion of H.C. Flmeing, this is possibly a loan from Burji.

Eg. *d3d „throat (or sim.)” is only to be deduced from its denominal verb, namely d3d (throat determinative) "(Schlachtopfer) abkehlen" (PT 402a-, Wb V 527, 10) = „entkehlen” (ÜKAPT II 138, 158) = „to kill, strangle” (Ember) = „to strangle” (AEPT 131) = „abstechen (Schlachtopfer), ’abkehlen’” (ÄWb I 1493a) = „to cut throat” (CT II 240b, DCT 818), for which so far just a phonologically ill-founded false etymology has been proposed.84 Only recently has G.

82 For this Afro-Asiatic etymology of Eg.  ̄ ̄ see OS 1990, 87, #8; 1992, 186 (Hausa-Eg.); Skinner 1992, 355 (ECu.-Ma'a
Eg.); HSED #2069 (Eg.-Hausa-Dhl.). 83 W.F. Albright (1918, 90; 1918, 240, #76, cf. GÄSW #757) and M. Cohen (1947, #151) figured PEg. * ̄j ̄j < ** ̄r ̄r to be equated with Sem.: Akk.  ̄arurtu "Hals", while H. Holma (1919, 42) combined Eg.  ̄ ̄ with Akk.  ̄â ̄u "husten"  ̄a ̄ ̄u ~  ̄u ̄ītu "Auswurf", which is, however an onomatopoiea having no etymological connection with the „throat” words. V. Blažek (1991, 364), in turn, identified Eg.  ̄ ̄ directly with Sem. * ̄aw- vs. * ̄aw ̄(aw)- "empty space, mouth, entrance, gate" [Blz.] = * ̄aw ̄- „hollow” [TG]: Hbr. ăwā īm ~ o īm (pl.) [< * aw -] „hole, crevice” [KB 296] = „das Felsspalten” [GB 217] = „hollows, recesses” [Lsl.] || Ar.  ̄aw ̄-at- „aperture in a wall, small doorway between houses” [Lsl.] || Geez  ̄o ̄‹t „door(way)” [Lsl. 1987, 260] =  ̄ō ̄t „hole in the wall” [KB]. This Semitic root has, however, reliably a quite different AfroAsiatic background, cf. SCu.: WRift ** ̄o ̄ > sg. * ̄o ̄ōŋw „hollow form”, pl. * ̄o ̄ēri [Kießling & Mous 2004, 323] || ECu.: Dullay * ̄o ̄- "hole" [GT] > Dobase  ̄o ̄r-o & Gollango hóhn-o „Loch” (Dullay: AMS 1980, 192) ||| WCh.: Angas-Sura *"uk ~ *"ok „(i.a.) be empty” [GT 2004, 207] > cf. especially Angas kok „empty” [Ormsby 1914, 209], Montol ku (so, without -k) „empty” [Ftp. 1911, 216] | Sha guk, pl. gukak "Tür" [Jng. 1970, 285]. The non-reduplicated root appears in Sem. *√ ̄wy „empty” [GT].
84 Since Eg. d- does not regularly correspond to Sem. *z-, the traditional equation of Eg. d3d with Sem. *√zrd: Syr. √zrd "erdrosseln" [Vrg.] || Ar. zarada "erdrosseln", zarida "schlucken", ma-zrad- "Kehle" [Vrg.] suggested by A. Ember (1913, 114, #37; ESS §24.c.4, §3.b.43) and J. Vergote (1945, 130) has to be given up. 85 This variety is also reflected by NBrb. *a-géržum „gorge” [Destaing 1920, 143] > e.g. Shilh a-geržum „gorge” [Cid Kaoui 1907, 119] | Tamazight ta-geržum-t „gorge” [Cid Kaoui] ||| Bed. gírguma (m) „Halsknorpel, Adamsapfel, Schlund, Kehle, Rachen” [Rn. 1895, 101] || Agaw *gurgum „neck” [GT] (Cu.: Blazek 1994 MS Bed., 16), which all carry the suffix *-um-. The etymons *gurd-um- vs. *gurg-um- may well have been rhyme-words. 86 G. Takács (1997 l.c.) treated its first radical as the trace of the AA prefix * - (occuring in the names of body parts). K. Naït-Zerrad (DRB 869), in turn, regarded as „un dérivé expressif” hardly fitting for comparing.

In addition, AA *√grμ „throat, neck” [GT] represents a third variety, cf. Sem. *√grz > Ar. ğaruza „être vorace” || Tigrinya gärzäw/yä „dépecer un animal égorgé” (Sem.: DRS 194-185) ||| NBrb.: Beni Snus a-gūrzi ~ a-yerzi, also á-yẹržum „gorge” [Destaing 1914, 154-155] Shawya i-gerzi „gorge, gosier, pharynx” [Huyghe 1907, 272] | Qabyle a-gurz „goitre” [DRB, not in Dallet 1982] || SBrb. *a-gur‹z “larynx” [GT] (Tuareg data: Prasse 1969, 42, 110; Brb.: DRB 899) ||| SOm.: Ari g rz-i „neck, throat” [Bnd.], Galila gurž-i „throat” [Flm.] (SOm.: Bnd. 1994, ; 2003, 214). It is noteworthy in the history of all these roots that the (presumably primary) nominal reflexes were as a rule lost in Semitic, just like in Egyptian, where they survived in denominally derived verbal roots with shifts into the semantic domain „gluttonous” (cf. its Hungarian synonym torkos < torok „throat”).
„Shoulder, arm”
Eg. «nd (determinative of wing)87 "Teil des Flügels" (Wb I 207, 6; GHWb 148; ÄWb I 279b) = „Teil (Spitz) des Flügels oder Flügel” (ÜKAPT) = „(tip of) wing” (AEPT), which is attested solely twice in the Pyramid Texts, namely in PT 1377b: dj NN tp «nd dn =k „setze den N. auf der Spitze deines Flügels” (ÜKAPT V 305) = „put me on the top of your wing” (AEPT 215), and in PT 1429b, in the expression d3j sw d wtj m tp dn =k „setz ihn
über, Thot, auf der Spitze deines Flügels” (ÜKAPT V, 353) = „ferry me over, o Thot, on the tip of your wing“ (AEPT 221). Among those rendering these texts, this puzzling word was paid at least some attention only by K. Sethe (ÜKAPT V 312, cf. also 354), who rightly stated that whereas in PT 1377b it „wie ein Teil des Flügels erscheint”, so in PT 1429b it seems „alsob «nd allein ’Flügel’ und erst tp-«nd ’Flügelspitze’ bedeutete”. The
word apparently does not occur later. Its reflex in Coptic supposed by W. Vycichl88 is most probably unrelated for phonological reasons. This is typically the case when only external evidence may bring us closer to the solution, which has so far been examined perhaps solely by G. Takács (1997, 238, #39; 2004, 51, #331). He suggested a cognacy with HECu. *ang-a "hand, arm" [Hds. 1989, 75, 404; Sasse 1982, 26]89 ||| WCh.: SBauchi *āŋ “hand, arm” [GT]90 || CCh.: Gisiga (Dogba dialect) haŋ "ganzer Arm, Hand" [Lukas 1970, 123] = hán (sic: n) „hand” [Rsg.]91 (Ch.: JI 1994 II, 178-179). The underlying AA *«ang- “hand, arm” [GT] may perhaps
87 In some publications (e.g., ÄWb l.c.), this hieroglyph is reproduced rather a finger horizontally (D51). 88 In his Coptic etymological dictionary (DELC 9), W. Vycichl derived Cpt. (S) alo[, (B) aloj "1. thigh, 2. (pl.) knees, 3. (pl.) arms, shoulders" (CD 7a) = „1. Schenkel, 2. (im Plural) Knie, Arme, Schultern” (KHW 5) from Eg. «nd, i.e., *«ld, which is rather problematic given the fact that (S) [ reflects an older Egyptian palatalized velar, not an affricate (Vergote 1973 Ib 20, §21 and 22, §23; Peust 1999, 121, §3.9.4.1; Allen 2013, 52). Therefore, more realistic seems W. E. Crum’s (l.c. infra) proposal to relate the Coptic word to (B) alok „corner, angle” and (SALB) wlk „to be(come) bent”, which reflect Eg. «rq
„krümmen” (OK-, Wb I 211). E. Dévaud’s (Muséon 36, 14) comparison of the Coptic forms to Hbr. yārēk "cuisse, hanche" etc. can be safely excluded (pace Vycichl l.c. supra) because of the phonological difficulties (Cpt. Ø- ≠ Hbr. y- and Eg. *-l- ≠ Sem. *-r-). Following F. Hintze, W. Westendorf (KHW 5) connected the Coptic word to SBrb.: Ahaggar ě-leγ "foot", which is only possible if the underlying Afro-Asiatic root had *-"# in the Auslaut. J. Černý (CED 5) saw the etymon of (S) alo[, (B) aloj and Dem. 3lg attested in «.wj n 3lg “cover of the thigh (made of silver)” (CED pace BiOr 13, 222) = „Futteral von 3lg (Gegenstand aus getriebenem Silber)” (DG 8) in Eg. «rq „Gelenk der Füße (?)” (LP, Wb I 211, 18) = "joint of leg (?)"
(CED), which seems indeed correct and satisfactory both phonologically and semantically. 89 The etymological position of the Highland East Cushitic forms has been debated. H. C. Fleming (l.c.) connected them with phonologically unacceptable parallels reflecting *√HrK. On the other hand, H.-J. Sasse (l.c.) and A. Zaborski (1989, 582) saw in them metathesis of ECu. *gan«- „hand”.
90 Cf. Guruntum aa(ng) “hand” [Gowers], Geji ang “hand” [Gowers] = ’âŋ "hand" [IL in JI] = aŋ „arm” [Krf.], Megang aŋ „arm” [Smz.], Gyaanzi áŋ „arm” [Smz. 1978, 20, #1]. The etymology of these forms is, however, not yet evident as in the same group forms like aa, am, and wam are also attested and their interrelation is obscure. H. Jungraithmayr (in JI 1994 I 8687 A) derived all these forms of South Bauchi from his PCh. *√"mn „hand”, the reconstruction of which appears for me equally problematic, possibly a result of a modern „contamination” of diverse distinct Chadic roots. 91 The background of the Gisiga word is also unclear. First of all, the shift of Gisiga h- < AA *«- is not yet attested. On the
conrary, I have so far only observed Gisiga h- < AA *h- (cf. Takács 2013, 158-159, fn. 11) and *s- (cf. JI 1994 I xxvii). But it is also difficult to agree with M. O. Rossing (1978, 266, #343), who traced the Gisiga word back to his PMafa-Mada (PMatakam) *ahal „hand”, because of the irregular Auslaut.

eventually be related to AA *√«ng „to hold” [GT].92 In the light of PT 377b and the possible relationship to AA *«ang-, we may venture, in agreement with K. Sethe, that Eg. «nd denoted some part of the wing or was a
synonym to dn for the whole wing, but by far not "tip" in general.

3) = *m ̆ C3 ̆C4 (Vcl.) = perhaps *m 3.w (GHWb; ÄWb). Perhaps akin, as pointed out in EDE III 474, to EthioSem.: Harari mi i "vicinity, near, beside", ān mi iye-be "at my side", Gurage: Chaha, Gyeto, and Masqan meyä "rib", Wolane miyamo "side of ribs" || MSA: Soqotri mi«eh [irreg. -«-] "side" (Sem.: Leslau 1963, 105) ||| WCh.:
Ngamo mà "arm", màa "wing" [Alio 1988 MS] || CCh.: Bata mę "bras" [Mch. 1950, 31] | Sao (Sso) mwa "Arm" [Duisburg 1914, 41]. Semantically, here too, the closest cognates appear in Chadic. Other suggestions are unconvincing.93
Eg. rmn „1. Oberarm, Schulter, 2. Seite, Hälfte” (PT-, Wb II 418), whence we have a denominal IVae inf. verb √rmnj „to support, carry on the shoulder” (PT-, Müller) = „tragen” (Wb II 419)94 and whose Coptic reflex is also highly debated,95 has been so far not yet unambiguously identified in its Afro-Asiatic kinship. (1) A. Erman (1892, 113, also 127, fn. 3) equated it with Hbr. √"mn qal „auf dem Arm tragen”, nifal „fest sein” and Ar. √"mn „vertrauen”, which H. Brugsch (l.c.) attached (correctly) rather to Eg. mn „bleiben”, which was opposed by Erman arguing that „bei dieser Gleichung bleibt das " unerklärt und zudem pass die Bedeutung von
rmn m.E. besser zu "mn als die von mn”.
92 Cf. Ar. «anağa I „1. retenir, arrêter (sa monture), en tirant la bride à soi avec force; ramener sa monture dans la direction que l’on vent”, IV „2. raffermir, rendre plus solide, 3. éprouver des douleurs dans les vertèbres”, «ināğ- „1. corde dont un but est attaché au bas du seau ou aux deux anses et l’autre au bois, 2. douleur dans les vertèbres”, «anğ-at- (pl.) „morceaux de bois verticaux qui forment comme des poteaux à l’entrée d’une litière portée à dos de chameau” [BK II 381] || Geez «anaga „to tie, bind”, «ang „ear-, nosering, chain for the neck” [Lsl. 1987, 64] ||| ECu.: Yaaku (Mogogodo) in ̧-ān "to take hold of" [Flm.] = -inE-am- “to hold (tr.)” [Heine 1975, 127]. The Yaaku verb was first connected with HECu. *ang-a (above) by H. C.
Fleming (1969, 25). 93 (1) L. Reinisch (1873, 246-7): ~ Teda tī, tihi "Ellbogen", tumma, tuŋga "Hand" (!). Absurd. (2) P. Lacau (1970, 107, #281) considered Eg. m to be an m- prefix form related to Akk. a ̄u "arm, side", which W.A. Ward (1972, 22, §279-282) rightly declined as Eg. does not regularly correspond to Akk.  ̄ (but cf. Kogan 1995). In addition, the function of m- in this case has not been explained. (3) Instead, he (Ward l.c.) derived Eg. m "forearm" from m "to seize, hold". A semantic connection
between "fist" and "to grasp, seize" is understandable, but this is not the case here. 94 Naturally, J. Osing (NBÄ 185) derived the noun deverbally, although already K. Sethe (1912, 103) had pointed to a denominal origin „des von rmn abgeleiteten Verbums rmnw ’tragen’”, which was corroborated by P. Lacau (1970, 104, §273): lit. „épauler, porter à l’épaule”. 95 H. Brugsch (1881 Wb Suppl. 727), followed by K. Sethe (1912, 103), P. Lacau (1970, 104-5, §273 and §275), and J. Černý (CED 6), suggested that PT √rmnw was continued by Cpt. (B) amoni „to be strong, possess” (CD 8a) = „ergreifen, verpflichten” (KHW 6), with (a nowhere attested) original sense „to hold”, where K. Sethe (l.c.) assumed the „Wegfall bzw. Übergang des r in Õ” just like P. Lacau (1970, 105, fn. 6): „Le r initial est passé à j et c’est ce Ô qui a changé en a le ə, voyelle prothétique, devant deux consonnes en contect direct”. This derivation was rightly queried by W. M. Müller (1909, 186: „it does not agree with early rmn”), W. Spiegelberg (1921, 5), the authors of Wb (l.c.), and W. Westendorf (KHW 486, fn. 2: "entspricht nicht der Struktur der IV. inf. Verben"). Indeed, there are worries both semantically („to carry on shoulder” vs. „to grasp”) and phonologically (syllable-initial r- is not supposed to shift in j-). W. M. Müller (1909, 186), who knew of no certain ex. of initial ŗ- (i.e., where r- was palatalized into j-),95 risked stating that „I only doubt an ŗ here” because of MEg. mnj3 „shoulder” (Illahun), which „suggests some hidden orthographic trick” guessed -j3 for r- defective treatment of the r- in rmn.wj written also as mn.wj (RT 4, 25, l. 7). Instead, W. Westendorf (l.c.) and W. Vycichl (DELC 9) affiliated the Coptic verb with Eg. mn (?) "1. (GR) in Empfang nehmen, 2. (gewöhnlich seit Pyr. in Ritualformeln) nimm in Empfang!" (PT, Wb II 60, 1-4) = "prendre" (AL 79.1188 with KRI exx.). I (EDE III 221) was disposed to see in the Coptic inf. a form reflecting in fact the NK j.mn imperative with the prothetic j- (XVIII-XIX., cf. Wb II 60). Then, W: Westendorf (KHW 6) changed his mind and assumed in (B) amoni merely a "besondere Verwendung" of (B) (a)moni "eig. anpflocken: 1. weiden (Vieh), 2. landen" (KHW 486).

(2) W. F. Albright (1927, 223) connected it with Ar. "amrān- (pl.) „nerfs du bras” [BK II 1096] = „Sehnen des
Armes” [GÄSW] = „tendons of the arm” [Alb.] and √mrn I „être en peu dur (se dit d’un corps habituellement tendre au toucher)” [BK II 1096] = „to tighten, make flexible” [Alb.] = „zäh, widerstandsfähig, biegsam” [GÄSW], which was received by F. von Calice (GÄSW 169-170, #688) with doubts („Sehr fraglich”), albeit so far this . (3) G. R. Castellino (1984, 13), in turn, assumed in Eg. rmn an instance of the „poss. infiltrazioni di indoeuropeo in egiziano”, cf. OIndic īrma- (m) „Bug, Arm, Vorderschenkel”, Avestan arəma- „Arm”, Armenian armuku „Ellenbogen”, Latin armus „der oberste Teil des Oberarms, Schulterblatt, Vorderbug der Tiere” etc. (IE data: LEW I 69). Here, one might object that anatomic terminology was hardly borrowed, let alone that Eg. -n was part of a triradical root not reflected on the Indo-European side.
Eg. tt.t ~ tt ~ t.t ~ t „aisselle” (MK, NK, Dévaud 1921, 161-163 with older lit.) = „shoulder” (Med., Breasted 1930, 417) = "1. Achsel, auch als Achselhöhle unter dem Arm, 2. Schulter, als Körperteil des Rindes: Schulterstück", cf. šn n tt.t “Achselhaar” (Wb III 204, 15-17; Grapow 1954, 50, §iv.3; GHWb 572; ÄWb II 1816) = “armpit (not shoulder)” (Caminos 1956, 15, fn. 1; FD 181; Ward 1972, 22, #276; DCT 367), act. *  ̆tt ̆́.t
(Dévaud 1921, 162) = * attắt < * at ̆tắt (Fecht 1960, 197, fn. 553) = * tygwĕt or * ttōwĕt (Lacau 1970, 106,
§277) = *  ̆tt.ắt > *  ̆tắ" (NBÄ 122, 596, n. 540)96 = *  ̆t(t)ắ.t (Schenkel 1983, 232) reflected by Cpt. (S) jo,
jw, pl. jwou, (B) a{o (m) „Achsel, Achselhöhle, Schulter” (KHW 18, 412) = „arm-pit” (CED 309).97 Most of the authors a priori agree that Eg. tt.t would be deverbal noun deriving from Eg. tt (hapax only attested in
PT 2171b) "jem. hochheben (zum Himmel), tragen unter dem Arm" (Wb III 204, 14; GHWb 572) = „to shoulder, carry on the shoulder” (Breasted 1930, 417) = „to carry (something) under one’s arm” (Caminos 1956, 15, fn. 1, declined by J. Osing in NBÄ 596, n. 540) = „prendre sous ses aisselles” (Lacau 1970, 106, §276). The verbal root was conceived − pace Wb l.c. etc. − by W. Schenkel (l.c.) as IIae gem.: √ tt, while P. Lacau (l.c.) figured it as IIIae inf. (√ tj) assuming that „ce verbe serait un dénominatif d’un mot * t perdu. Plus tard nous avons le substantif ... ttt.” One is disposed to side with the assumption of P. Lacau as the external evidence seems to confirm the Afro-Asiatic background of the noun, but not that of Eg. tt, which indeed seems to be an
(ad hoc?) denominative verb. Since t originated solely from a palatalized *k, we may safely project a PEg. * kk.t. This is why the etymology of A. B. Dolgopolsky (1998, 83, #107), who equated this Eg. term with Sem.: Modern South Arabian *γatq-at “back of the knee” [GT]98, can by no means be accepted.99 Instead, G. Takács (2004, 63, #358) ventured comparing PEg. * kk.t with WCh.: Kulere haw [< *kaw] “Achselhöhle” [Jng. 1970, 352]100 | Pero yyágèw [< *yakaw?] “armpit” [Frj. 1985, 55]101 || CCh.: Muktele hàháw [< * akaw?] „armpit”
96 W. Vycichl (DELC 323) firmly objected J. Osing’s (NBÄ l.c.) reconstruction of this word: „Il n’y a pas le moindre doute que les deux ... t étaient séparés par une voyelle. OSING dérive la forme copte de ... de reconstruction inadmissible qui n’explique pas la disparition du ... . Il prétend que la dittographie ... exprime en égyptien une gémination, opinion
reconnue depuis longtemps comme erronnée. Il compte dans ce cas avec une terminaison du féminin -at accentuée, pour un mot de genre masculin.” 97 In P. Lacau’s (1970, 106, §277) opinion, „le h initial devant voyelle atone tombe régulièrement en bohaïrique” (as it has been confirmed also for Sahidic by C. Peust 1999, 158, §3.14.7 and fn. 200 with further literature), but one can hardly agree with him in that „en shaidique nous devons attendre *ha{o ou *ha{w” as Eg. t did become j or t (but not {). For the loss of - in Coptic, cf., e.g., (B) a,w, (S) hako „magician, wizard” < Eg. k3.w (CED 277). Further exx. apud Peust l.c. 98 Attested as Jibbali γasqét “back of the knee” [Jns. 1981, 90] = "popliteal space" [Dlg.], Mehri γ‹tqáyt "hollow at the back of the knee" [Jns. 1987, 144]. 99 These roots are phonologically “incomparable” (none of the underlying root consonants corresponds: Eg. - ≠ Sem. *γ-, Eg. t ≠ Sem. *t, Eg. t ≠ Sem. *"). Besides, MSA *γat"-at [assim. < **γas"-at?] might be eventually related to ECu.: Konso quTittá “armpit” [Lamberti 1987, 536, #28.a]. 100 The first root consonant and its syllable was lost in Ron. Or was it a * - mobile, perhaps identical with the common Afro
Asiatic marker of the semantical category of anatomical terms (studied by G. Takács 1997)? Interesting is the unusual lack of the first syllable also in the supposed Coptic Sahidic reflexes of MEg. tt.t, jo and jw. The shift of Ron *h- < Ch./AA *kis just as regular as Ron *k- < AA *"- as shown by G. Takács (2000, 96-97). 101 AA * -, as a rule, was lost as such in the Bole-Tangale group or shifted to h- (Stolbova 1987, 61, table 1.7), but its
syllabic trace was preserved by Pero yya-. The medial *-k- in Pero might have been subject to a regular voicing in intervocalic position (-VgV- < *-VkV-).

[Rsg. 1978, 202, #24].102 In the light of this Chadic etymology, it cannot be excluded that Ch. *( a)[k]aw (or similar) “armpit” [GT] has an Egyptian cognate. At least, this seems to be by far the most hopeful Afro-Asiatic etymology of MEg. tt.t at the present. But we should wait until further Chadic parallels become available to be
able to judge whether the underlying Chadic root was in fact *√ kw (neatly fitting Eg. * tygwĕt projected by P. Lacau 1970, 106, §277) or represents perhaps a quite distinct Afro-Asiatic root, something like *√ ̄w „hollow” [GT].103
Eg.  ̄pš „1. (PT-) (Vorder)schenkel, 2. (early MK-) der Arm, Kraft, eigtl. körperlich der Arm; schon sehr früh
(seit D. 12) im Sinne von Kraft gebraucht” (Wb III 268-269) = "1. foreleg, thigh, 2. (strong) arm" (FD 189): after a couple of untenable etymological proposals,104 the correct Cushito-Chadic parallels of the Egypian noun have only recently been discovered by O. Stolbova105 and G. Takács (EDE I 162), cf. ECu. *kafš-/*kefš- "1. shoulder → 2. chest" [Sasse 1982, 112] = *kesf- „chest” [Sasse 1979, 54] = *ke(s)p- „armpit, chest, shoulder” [Lmb. 1987, 536, fn. 4]106 ||| WCh.: Hausa kààfáTà107 [Abr. 1962, 446], Buli gàpuŝà [Kraft] || CCh. *paŝ( ̄)-,108 probably a metathesis < ** ̄apš-"shoulder" [GT] > Bura-Margi *paĉVk- (metathesis) „shoulder” [GT]: Bura paĉaha ~

The etymological position of ECh.: Somray bússomo „Schulter” [Lukas 1937, 77] is not yet clear. Do we have here perhaps *bus- + the common AA (Sem., Brb., Cu.) suffix *-um of anatomical terms? The isogloss of CCh.: Gisiga kərpeŝ „Achselhöhle” [Lukas 1970, 125], Balda kĕ́rpăss „Arm” [Str. 1922-3, 116] | Musgu kérpeθ [*-ŝ] „Schulter” [Müller 1886, 398] = kérpex „Schulter” [Lukas 1941, 62], Musgu-Puss kerpeŝ
102 The Muktele parallel has been added for this paper. Since the M. O. Rossing’s (1978) Mafa-Mada reconstruction as well as the most recent Central Chadic phonology by R. Gravina (2014) provide little about the history of Muktele h-, it would be difficult to say anything. If, however, we look at the Pero parallel, it appears likely that we have here an etymon * a-kaw.
103 Cf. Takács 2010, 140. 104 On the one hand, Ju. N. Zavadovskij (1974, 108; 1975, 48) equated it with Sem.: Ar. √ ̄bs „saisir, prendre avec la main”
and √hbš „soulever, ramasser à la main”, Brb. *(h)a-fus „hand”, and, in his paper from 1975, even with Ar. √hms (sic, h-) „5”. The latter absurd idea was two decades later extended by E. Lipiński (1997, 287, §35.10) to a comparison of Eg.  ̄pš with Sem. * ̄amš- „5” ||| Brb. *səmmus „5” ||| Bed. asa *”5” (only attested in: asa-gwir „6”, act. *”5 + 1”, asa-rama „7”, act. *”5 + 2”) explained by him via *assa < * ̄assa < * ̄amsa. All this was, on the top of it, was concluded by his absurd remark: „In the quinary system ... in Libyco-Berber, ... afus ’hand’, related directly (!) to Eg.  ̄pš, may be used instead of səmmus”.
On the other hand, V. Orel and O. Stolbova (1992, 185; HSED #1390): ~ WCh.: Montol pəγas “Wade” [Jng. 1965, 171] = “calf of leg” [OS] < *pVHaĉ/s, but as demonstrated by G. Takács (2004, 302), the Anlaut p‹γ- of Montol p‹γas regularly derives from *pw-, and so it is cognate with Goemay 3aas “calf of the leg” [Srl. 1937, 171] < Angas-Sura *3wā2s ~ *3ā2s “calf of leg”, for which cf. also Angas-Sura *0ā2s “shinbone” [GT] || ECh.: Mubi-Toram *būsaw- "lower leg" [GT]: Jegu busawo
“calf of leg” [Jng. 1961, 111], Kofa búusó (m), pl. búusàw "Unterschenkel" [Jng. 1977 MS, 4]. 105 Stolbova 1995, 60, 62; 1996, 19; Orel 1995, 145. The Eg.-Buli match was also discussed in OS 1992, 186; HSED #2034. O. V. Stolbova (l.c.) included in this comparison also ECh.: Mubi fósó (f), pl. fóósás "Arm, Hand" [Lukas 1937, 182] = *fósó "hand" [Doornbos-Bender] = fòósó (m), pl. fòosús ~ fóosàs "main" [Jng. 1990 MS, 15], which, however, represents a fully distinct Afro-Asiatic root. 106 Cf. LECu.: Somali šaf „chest” [Abr. 1964, 229], Konso  ̄ašš-ittá „shoulder” [Lmb.] (borrowed from Dullay?) vs. kess-a
“chest” [Sasse] | HECu.: Burji káčč-ō “shoulder” [Sasse: from *kafš-] | Harso hešš-é and Gollango haš-itto „Schulter”, Gawwada  ̄aš-ito “Schulterblatt” (Dullay data: AMS 1980, 267) | Yaaku kehp-en “shoulder” [Sasse: old *kesp-] = kεhp-en
[Lmb.] etc. (ECu.: data: Sasse 1982, 112). For most of these forms, M. Lamberti (1987, 536, #25a) presented a different etymological analysis. Ch. Ehret (1987, #173), in turn, equated ECu. *kafš- with Bed. sikba „pastern joint” and Sagaw: Awngi cəgfi „palm of hand”, which V. Blažek (1994 MS Bed., 31) rightly considered as uncertain. 107 The Hausa word with its deviant -T < AA *-H (instead of the expected -l < AA *-ŝ) in the Auslaut represents a reflex of AA *√ ̄pH, a root variety to AA *√ ̄pŝ, which underlies the rest of the Chadic parallels.
108 The reconstruction of the Proto-Chadic stem has been disputed: J. Mouchet (1950, 33) has CCh. *√kps "épaule" based solely on the comparison of the Mandara and Muzuk exx., whereas O. Stolbova (1991 MS, 5; 1995, 60) suggested CCh. *HapaĉV "shoulder", which appears to be more realistic. Later, she (Stolbova 1996, 19) set up PCh. *Ha-paŝ- > CCh. *papaŝ- "shoulder". The latter, however does not fit all the Central Chadic parallels.

„épaule” [Trn. 1991, 98] reflects *kerpeŝ (or sim.) [GT], which may eventually represent the same triconsonantal root extended with a parasitic -r-. Another ultimately related isogloss (an old root variety inherited from the Afro-Asiatic parental language) reflecting AA *√b–μ "shoulder" [GT] is attested in SCu. (possibly) *bV ̄/gVs/μ- (?) [GT]109: Qwadza be"es-iko "shoulders" (the suppletive pl. to belendayo) [Ehret 1980 MS, 1; 1980, 142, #74] ||| CCh.: Zeghwana bəgədza “shoulder” [Kraft] | Lamang-Hide (Hitkala) ba ̧aga (metathesis < *baga ̧a) „épaule” [Eguchi 1971, 197]. No reflexes in Semitic, Berber, and Omotic are known for the time being. In South Berber, perhaps a possible cognate appears in Ahaggar ă-kāsuf „bâton (de moyenne ou faible grosseur et d’environ 1m,50c à 2m de long)” [Fcd. 1951-2, 915], ETawllemmet a-"asuf „1. bâton court et gros, 2. cravache fouet, 3. p. ext. coup de bâton,
fouet” [PAM 2003, 418] with a semantic shift suspiciously similar to that preserved by Eg.  ̄pš „das sogenannte ’Sichelschwert’ als Waffe” (MK-, Wb III 270, 1). All in all, Eg.  ̄pš, as an anatomical term, seems to only have Cushitic and Chadic cognates. The Egyptian word has thence only South Afro-Asiatic cognacy.
Eg. *sqr, an old word for „elbow (?)”, not attested in Egyptian texts, only reconstructed from the hieroglyph depicts apparently a bent arm with the phonetic value sqr. As stated by A. H. Gardiner (1927, 524, Aa7), in the inscriptions of Dynasty VI, “it looks like an arm”. The existence of OEg. *sqr seems to be supported also by AA *√[@]"l “elbow” [GT] based on ECu. *T1i"l- "elbow" [Sasse 1979, 26, 30; 1982, 176, 105]110 ||| CCh.: Mofu méckùlék [-ts-] (prefix me-?) “elbow” [Rsg. 1978, 244, #232]. The Mofu-East Cushitic comparison is due to N. Skinner (1992, 348). Eg. *sqr issues regularly from an incompatiblePEg. *√dql due to the obligatory loss of glottalization in the proximity of a velar, i.e., the combination of an AA glottalized affricate *@/*E/*H + *k/*g/*"/*q becomes, as a rule, PEg. *sk/*sg/*sq/*s ̄ (cf. EDE I 327-329).
Eg. q« „1. Oberarm, Schulter, 2. (selten auch vom) Arm (allgemein)” (MK-, Wb V 19, 6-13) = "(upper) arm,
shoulder, elbow" (FD 276; DCT 649), whose ultimate etymology is debatable, is, with its typical -« , certainly the result of a dissimilative reduplication of one single pharyngeal (i.e., « < either *«« < **« or * < ** , cf. EDE I 329-332). In addition, perhaps we must also take into account a possible shift of an incompatible PEg. *k« → OEg. q« . Accordingly, one has to count with at least three promising alternative (almost equipotential) etymological possibilities: (1) A. Ember (ESS 1930, §5.c) has already surmised Eg. q- < *k- to be due to medial -«- (possibly rightly) and a
also change of -« to - due to q- or *k- in our word (i.e., pre-PEg. **k«« > *k« > OEg. q« ), which he regarded as cognate with Ar. kā«- ~ kū«- „1. condyle, surtout os de la main qui touche au pouce ou au doigt articulaire, 2. os de la cheville du pied” [BK II 944] = kū«- „the extremity of the radius or bone of the fore-arm, next the thumb
or the protuberance formed thereby” [Lane 3004] = „Handgelenk, genauer: Kopf des Unterarmknochens” [GÄSW 210, #867] = „vorspringendes Ende d. Unterarmknochens an d. Handwurzel, Knöchel d.

[Ember]. Following C. Brockelmann (l.c. infra), L. Kogan (SED I 125-6, #140) affiliated the Arabic noun with Syr. kō«ā „articulus” [Brk. 1928, 323] || Ethio-Sem. *kwätt- „foot, hoof” [Kogan] > e.g. Amhara kotte „foot, hoof
(of a horse)” [Kane 1990, 1426], Gurage-Soddo kotte „hoof” [Lsl. 1979 I 1075] etc., which he derived via **kwa«-at < **ku«-at- from his Sem. *ku/a«-at- „joint, ankle, foot”. Ember’s etymology was declined by F. von Calice (GÄSW 210, #867) arguing that Eg. q« „shoulder” derives (as suggested later in NBÄ 228 too)
internally from Eg. q« „Ecke, Winkel, Seite” (OK-, Wb V 19-20). But these ideas are eventually not necessarily excluding one another. It is highly noteworthy to observe the parallelism between Eg. q« „1. (PT) vom Stier,
der sein Horn zur Seite wendet um dem Toten den Weg frei zu geben, 2. (CT/BD-) die Hand, den Arm beugen” (Wb V 18-19) = „to bend (arm, hand)” (FD 276-277; DCT 649) and Ar. kawi«a I „e-n verkrümmten,
verkrüppelten Knöchel d. Handgelenks haben, e-n hervorstehenden Knöchel d. Handgelenks haben”, II „j-m d. Knöchel d. Handgelenks verkrümmen, verkrüppeln”, kawa«- „Verkrümmung, Verkrüppelung d. Knöchels d. Handgelenks, Hervorstehen d. Knöchels d. Handgelenks” [WKAS I 437b-438b], which is evidently the denominative verb of Ar. kū«-. Ultimately, can the underlying AA *√k« „elbow, wrist” [GT] be related to the medially irregular isogloss of Sem.: Hbr. √yq« qal „1. to turn away in disgust, 2. dislocate (a thigh)” and √nq« qal „1. to free oneself (from lovesickness), 2. turn away in disgust” [KB 431, 722] ||| SCu. *ki«- „to turn aside,

(2) V. Orel and O. Stolbova (HSED #1622), in turn, equated it SCu.: WRift *kwā a „shoulder blade”, pl. kwa u [KM] = *kwa - "shoulder" [OS]: Iraqw and Gorowa kwā a „shoulder blade” [KM] = kwa a „1. shoulder blade, 2. stick for scraping dung” [Ehret], Alagwa kwā a „shoulder (blade)”, pl. kwa u „shoulders” [KM] = kwa u „shoulder” [Ehret], Burunge kwā a „shoulder (blade)”, pl. kwa u „shoulders” [KM] = kwa a „shoulder”, kwa i „wrist” [Ehret] (WRift data: Ehret 1980, 269, #17 with a different SCu. etymology; KM 2004, 186). This may only be true if we assume an equally plausible chain of changes in Eg. q« < *k« < **k . (3) A. Ju. Militarev (in Starostin et al. 1995 MS, 15), in turn, affiliated it with Bed. hárka ~ hérka „der Arm Oberarm, Schulter, Achsel” [Rn. 1895, 126] = herka "upper arm, shoulder" [Roper 1928, 198] || ECu. * ark/""arm, hand" [GT]111 > i.a. Dullay * ark/q-o „Arm, Hand” [TG]: Harso, Dobase, Gawwada ark-ó, pl. árq-e,
Gollango arq-ó (Dullay: AMS 1980, 230, 247; ECu. data: Dlg. 1973, 159; Lmb. 1987, 536, #27.a) || SCu.: Ma'a (Mbugu) mu-hăJēγa ~ mu-hăJ ́ka „Arm” [Meinhof] = mharéga ~ mharéγa < *-haraka- "arm" [Ehret] (Ma’a
LECu.: Meinhof 1906, 314; Ehret 1980, 335; 1987, #524). This comparison is, in principle, also plausible if one assumes here an interchange of -«- < *-r- (sporadically attested in older Egyptian),112 i.e., Eg. q« < PEg.
*qr *√ r" [GT] via metathesis.
Eg. *gr is possibly a lost word for „forearm” or „elbow” reconstructible from the fact that the words deriving
from Eg. √gr „1. fertig machen, 4. aufhören” (Wb V 182-183) have a determinative representing the "forearm
with palm of hand downwards", which A. H. Gardiner (EG 1927, 447, D41) explained, not too convincingly, as the determinative of „cessation of movement” only because the same sign appears in Eg. nj „ab-, zurückweisen” (MK-, Wb II 204), although one finds little in common. A much more reasonable explanation is to assume here a lost word originating from AA *gul - ~ *gu l- “1. knob on limb, 2. (hence extended to) forearm” [GT]113 being akin to Brb. *√gly [regular < **√gl ] „nouer” [DRB] > (GT: or vice versa: denominal root?) i.a.

111 M. Lamberti (l.c.) erroneously set up an ECu. * ̄arg-, although the Dullay reflexes clearly indicate ECu. * -and *-"- (for
the underlying sound laws see Sasse 1979, 56). In addition, the Eth.-Sem. loans borrowed from ECu. corroborate the same: Harari aräq, Gurage-Ennemor haräq "arm above elbow", cf. Leslau 1963, 86.
112 Observed by K. Sethe (1899-1902 I §148), W. Czermak (1931-4, 117f., 135f.), J. Vergote (1948, 65f.), W. Westendorf (1962, §31.7), C. Peust (1999, 105-6, §3.6.4.4). 113 The * in these forms may eventually be identical with the common Afro-Asiatic affix (pre- or infix or suffix) * occuring
in body parts’ names (see Takács 1997). 114 L. Reinisch (l.c.) equated the Bilin word with Bed. kélib and Hedareb (Barka) tū-klüb [Almkvist] = kelíb (mit dem Artikel t -klib, -klüb) „Knöchel” [Rn. 1895, 140]. 115 The etymology of the quoted Iraqw word is highly dubious. Did it originally designate a knobly club resembling the shape of the body part in question? 116 The South Cushitic words were first affiliated by Ch. Ehret (1980, 365). For the common Cushitic comparison (Beja, Agaw, Qwadza) cf. Ehret 1987, 124, #534. 117 Attested in Gerka gan-gwal (so, gan-) [act. *gaŋ-gwal] „elbow” [Ftp. 1911, 216], Kofyar kong-gógól „elbow” [Netting 1967 MS, 20], Montol gwad-gwal (sic: -d, misprint for *gwan-?) „elbow” [Ftp. 1911, 216] (Angas-Sura data: Stl. 1987, 219, #692; Takács 2004, 135). The first component is identical with Angas-Sura *"wam > *"waŋ „elbow” [GT].

etymological connection between Bed. gwinhZl and gúlhe (above). L. Reinisch (1895, 98), in turn, supposed that we have here „sichtlich ein compos(itum). aus” a hypothetic **gwenh > *gŭnh ~ *gŭlh + suffix *-āl. The first component has been affiliated by him with Bed. gán"a „Hand(fläche), Fußfläche/-sohle”. The problem is that the root underlying the latter was √gn«, which hardly explains the medial -h-. For me, more convincing seems an
older pre-PBed. etymon *gwan-(gw)a al, whose both components might be identified with those of Angas-Sura *"waŋ- vs. *-gwaγal, resp. In this case too, in addition, we may semantically indeed hardly speak of a cognacy between the first part of this compound term and PCu. *gan«- „palm of hand” [Ehret 1987, 118, #498].
„Breast”
Eg. p "Euter" (GR with a possible PT attestation,119 Wb I 533, 9), which occurs also extended with diverse
prefixes,120 was derived by W. Westendorf (1966, 143) and R. O. Faulkner (AEPT 1969, 235, fn. 4) from Eg. p .wj "hinder parts" through the intermediate sense *"Unterleibs(region), Beckenraum", which is plausible. But,
as G. Takács (1999, 81; 1999, 367; EDE II 491-2) has demonstrated, might be alternatively cognate to EthioSem. (no Sem. etymology, borrowed from Cu.?): Amharic fäyä "to suck the breast, drink milk by suckling", Gafat fawatä (1945) vs. əfwatä (1956) „milk”, Gurage: Muher fwat, Soddo äfat, Gogot äfwat "milk" (ES: Leslau 1945, 154; 1956, 172; 1979 III 247) ||| Brb. *iff < **if < **fi (?) „breast, teat” [GT pace DRB 508-9, √f, #5] >
e.g. NBrb.: Shilh & Tamazight if, pl. iff-an „sein, mamelle” [Cid Kaoui 1907, 217] ||| LECu.: perhaps Afar ifu121 „nipple” [PH 1985, 134] || SCu.: Ma'a ma-fwáha [fw- irregular < *pw-] "fresh milk" [Ehret 1980, 151] ||| Ch. *√py „1. breast, 2. milk” [GT] = *ph(Ã)jÃw „milk” [IS]: WCh.: NBauchi *-pi "milk, breast" [Skn.] = *pī [GT]122 || CCh.: Musgu fôau „milk” [Krause in Müller 1886, 395] = fiáu „milk” [Rohlfs in Lukas 1941, 54] = fyaw ~ fyáw "milk, breast" [Mouchet 1950, 26/38], Pus fiyaw "sein, lait" [Trn. 1991, 88] | PMasa *pa" „breast” [GT]123 || ECh.: Sokoro paió „milk” [Lks. 1937, 37] (Ch.: IS 1966, 22, #2.14; JI 1994 II, 46-47). If the Egyptian term is cognate, we may derive these parallels from PAA *√p „1. breast, 2. milk” [GT]. Extra-Afro-Asiatic areal
parallels appear in PCKhoisan *pī „breast”, *pī „milk”, *pī „to suck” [Baucom 1972, 19, 24, 27] and Ubangi: PMundu-Ndogo *pī „to milk” [Saxon 1982, 77]. An ancient root variety with a voiced Anlaut can also be pointed out, cf. AA *√b „1. breast, 2. milk” [GT] is attested in NBrb.: e.g., Shilh-Tazerwalt ti-bbi-t, pl. ti-bb\-t-in „Zitze” [Stumme 1899, 234] = „sein, mamelle” [DRB] | CAlgerian a-bebbu „sein (femelle), mamelle (animal)” [DRB] || EBrb.: Ghadames ba ~ end-ba „sein” [Lanfry 1973, 7, #40] (Brb. data: DRB I 41, 144)124 ||| WCh.: Dera 0íyá „milk” [Nwm. 1974, 122] || CCh.: Hitkala (Lamang) úu0á „milk, breast” [Lks. 1964, 109] = wu«wa wu«ba „breast” [Meek] | PMandara *ū0a
[metathesis < **0uw-?] „breast” [GT]125 || ECh. *buw- (?) "milk" [GT]126.
118 Cf. Kwami kùngìlì, Kupto gùnkúllì, Kushi gùŋùl, Piya gùlí, Widala gùgùl (Bole-Tangale data: Jng. & Leger 1993, 167). 119 Occurs perhaps already in PT 1548a (with an udder determinative), although both its reading and rendering are debated: p "Bez. der Eingweide als Abfall beim Schlachten (?)" (Wb I 533, 8) = p "hinterer Teil oder Bauchhöhle" (Westendorf 1966, 143) = mp "udder" (Faulkner 1969, 235, fn. 4) = mp "Euter" (ÄWb I 526b). In my view, the reading mp with m- as
a radical is rather unlikely the co-occurence of m and p in the same root being excluded by the consonant incompatibility laws (cf. EDE I 323 with further literature). K. Sethe (ÜKAPT V 500), in turn, saw in p the sg. of p .wj „das Hinterteil”. 120 From the same root: (1) mnp .t "1. Brust (NE), 2. Euter der Kuh (GR)" (Wb II 79, 14-15) = „Euter der Kuh” (NE, GHWb 339), (2) np .wj "Euter der Kuh" (GR, Wb II 249, 15-17) = np .w „*Beckenraum” (NE, GHWb 407). 121 According to H.-J. Sasse (1979, 56), PECu. * was reflected in Saho and Afar both as and zero. He (Sasse 1979, 37)
was speculating about a possible explanation of a common pharyngeal loss in these languages. 122 Attested in Warji píí-na [Skn.] = píy‘-ná [IL], Kariya, Miya àpí [Skn.], Pa’a ápi [MSkn.] = api [IL], Suri ípí [IL, Skn.], Diri yàpú [Skn.] = ya:phú [IL], Mburku piì-hú [Skn.], Tsagu ipən [Skn.] = éépŒ-n [IL], Jimbin ifi (irreg. -f-) [Skn.] (NBauchi: Skinner 1977, 14; Stolbova 1987, 248, #2; JI 1994 II 46). 123 Cf.

Note that - is unusual in inherited Berber roots. K. Naït-Zerrad (p.c. on 7 March 2001) considers the unusual - in Ghadames as an extension (suffix), not part of the root, typical for expressive words or
Kinderwörter in Berber. Naït-Zerrad suggests a comparison to NBrb.: Shilh ta-bubb-at & ti-bbi-t | Tamazight ta-bubb-ut „sein” (cf.

A remote areal (?) parallel may appear in IE *melĝ- "Milch geben" as suggested by H. Möller (1911, 163-4). The AraboEgyptian comparison was rightly queried by I.M. Diakonoff and L.E.

(2) Already H. Grapow (1914, 4) and P. Lacau (1970, 71, #178) has ingeniously surmised (without any extra-Eg. evidence) that Eg. mnd may be a nomen loci or instrumenti (prefix m-) of an unattested Eg. *wnd "to suckle (allaiter)".130 As pointed out by G.

128 These are: (1) L. Homburger (1930, 286): ~ Ful (Peul) endu "sein". (4) E. Zyhlarz (1936, 444 & fn. 1) identified it with Brb. (sic) mníd-ak "vor Dir" < *emnīd-a-ka "in Bezug auf Deine Vorderseite" < *mnid "nach vorne schauen" (sic), which he ultimately connected with Eg. mnd "breast" (q.v.) and even Nub.: Kunuzi missi, Mahassi mańi "oeil" (sic). (5) W. M. Müller (1907, 303) and F. Hommel (1915, 16, fn. 3) proposed an etymological connection with Eg. mn« "to suckle" (above). But Eg. mn« represents a distinct AA root. (6) D. Meeks (1977, 81), pace E. Zyhlarz (l.c., fn. 1), assumed a relationship with Eg.
mnd.t "Teil des Gesichst am Auge" (BD, Wb, below) = "vordere Augenpartie" (Zhl.) = "globe oculaire" (Meeks) < Eg. *mnd "to be round". Baseless. (7) V. Blažek (1982, 246, #16) compared it with PCu. *mVn- "entrails" [Dlg. 1973, 182]. Rejected by G. Takács (1999, 48). (8) A.R. Bomhard (1984, 274, #287) derived from a certain AA *mə/ansy- "breast" (sic, otherwise unattested) ~ IE *mə/ansy- "breast, to suckle" (cf. IEW 729; WP II 232). Similarly, F.

hence *pV-zuŋ135 „heart” [GT]136 | PRon * ̧iŋ „breast, chest” [GT],137 in which the final *-ŋ is a natural merger of an earlier Auslaut **-nH (including **-n«). The only anomaly is that of Eg. š- vs. WCh. *Z-, behind which
one is disposed to surmise a voiced lateral (*Á- or *o-), the existence of which in the consonant inventory of the Proto-Afro-Asiatic parental language, however, has not yet been sufficiently demonstrated.

[PAM 2003, 728, 731-732]?138 All other suggestions are much less convincing: (1) V. Blažek (1989 MS Om., 19, #64) has derived it from his AA *ŝ/ĉan«- on the basis of the comparison with Om. *ši/un- „heart, belly” [Blz.] = *šVn- „heart” [Bnd. 1994, 1156, #40] > NOm.: Dizi-Maji cōnu „heart, belly” [Bnd.], Nao šunus „belly” [Bnd.], Sheko šun „heart, liver” [Flm.] = šQn (?) „belly” [Bnd.] = šon „heart” [Mkr.]139 = šön „heart” [Blz.] | Mao šin „belly” [Flm.] || SOm.: Dime šīne „belly” [Flm.] (Om.: Flm. 1976, 317), although these parallels do not reflect the trace of the *-« let alone the semantical difference.
(2) A. B. Dolgopolsky (1989, 94, #16) affiliated it with Sem.: Akk. šūlu „ein Totengeist (?)” [AHW 1269] < Sem. *[ŝ]u[«]l- or *[ŝ]ul[«]- (baseless) and ECu. *saz«- „heart” [Sasse], which he explained from PCu. *[ŝ]VÁ«(otherwise unattested), an assimilation from a hypothetic **ŝVl«- (not supported by any of the Cushitic data).
(3) O. V. Stolbova (1994 MS, 1), in turn, saw in it a cognate of WCh.: Mupun Téŋ “1. upper part, top, 2. sky, heaven”, cf. also Tēŋ (adv.) “on, about (Jipaari)” [Frj. 1991, 15], which, however, derives from Angas-Sura *Tyeŋ ~ *Tya2ŋ (or *ƒy

Ch. F. A. Dillmann (1865, col. 370) assumed an extinct,
135 O. V. Stolbova (1987, 151, #68) considered the final *-k in her arbitrary proto-AS reconstruction *zum-k (erroneously derived from her WCh. *mbA-mAH1i ~ *mbA-H1ami “breast, heart”) as an indicator of the nominal class of body parts,

otherwise unattested ES *√nb«146 or *√nb"147 (which he related to Sem. √nf ̄, still in active use) that the Geez and the other Ethio-Semitic forms may have derived by a caus. prefix *sa-. Alternatively, he did not exclude a derivation from an equally hypothetic ES *√sb"/*√sb« via epenthetic nasal, which Dillmann affiliated with Hbr. nšb qal „wehen” [GB 526]. Similarly, W. Leslau (1938, 312; 1945, 240) too supported the idea of a caus. formation originating from a hypothetic ES *√nb« „to blow”, which he connected with Soqotri «amb „poumon”
[Lsl.] with metathesis. Both of these scholars eventually meant this way a Semitic origin of the Cushito-Omotic parallels. This is well conceivable regarding both the Old Ethiopic quadriliteral root and the ES «ayin (lost until
the word entered Cushitic from some more recently eroded Ethio-Semitic source/es). This is why it is very difficult to accept others’ position maintaining a reverse way of borrowing. from HECu. A. B. Dolgopol’skij (1973, 94) set up PCu.-Om. *s(y)Vm3- „гpyдь (chest)” on the basis of comparing the above listed Cu.-Om.
parallels for „lung” with NWOmeto *šenp- „to breathe” [GT] > Wolaita šemp- „1. to breathe, 2. rest” [Lmb.], Dawro šenf-o „heart” [CR] = „soul, breeze, breath” [Lmb.], Gamu šemp-o „life, breath, genital parts of body” [Lmb.], Dache, Zayse šemp-o „life” [Lmb.], Male šêmp-i „soul” [Flm.],148 which neither semantically nor phonologically look like as cognates to the former. Dolgopol’skij regarded Kefoid „lung” as the source (!) of HECu. „lung”, whereas he derived the Ethio-Semitic words for „lung” from Cushitic. His idea was followed by M. Lamberti (LS 1997, 508), who assumed Common Cu.-Om. *šanb- „1. to breathe, 2. lung” on the basis of Dolgopol’skij’s and his additional comparanda (above) remarking that in the meaning „lung”, „this stem has also entered” Ethio-Semitic. Similarly, D. Appleyard (1977, 16/58) explained Ethio-Semitic „lung” as a loan either from Agaw or from East Cushitic. H.-J. Sasse (1982, 72) also derived Amhara „lung” from East Cushitic. Later, changing his mind (as expressed in his works from 1938 and 1945, quoted above), W. Leslau (1987, 505) too saw in Ethio-Semitic „lung” borrowing from Agaw. Breaking the domination of the view on the Cushitic origin of Eth.-Sem. *sanbu"/« „lung” [GT] in the second half of the 20th century, V. Blažek (1994 MS Bed., 34
35) claimed the latter to be a native Semitic word akin to Akk. (Standard Bab.) sinib/ptu „eine Haut auf der Lunge” [AHW 1047] = „part of sheep’s lung” [CAD s 285], whereas he regarded North Omotic „lung” as a loan borrowed from Highland East Cushitic. Following him, L. Kogan (SED I 207-209, #235), reconstructing PSem. *si/an3- „lung”, extended the underlying equation of Eth.-Sem. *sanbu"/« „lung” [GT] and Akk. sinip/btu onto
PBHbr. simpōn and JAram. simpōnā „Blutader der Lunge” [Krauss] = „Röhre (PBHbr.: bes. oft die Blutader), Vene (der Lunge)” [Levy 1924 III 513] = „1. Röhre, 2. Bronchie, 3. Bronchialverzweigung” [Dalman 1922, 294] = „ramified blood-vessel, artery, bronchiae” [Jastrow 1960, 982] = „bronchial tube” [Klein] > NHbr. simpōnōn (dimin. suffix -ōn) „bronchial tube (smaller ramifications)” [Klein], which, however, S. Krauss (1898-99 II 389), R. Růžička (1909, 130), and − pace J. Levy (l.c.) and G. H. Dalman (l.c.) − E. Klein (1987, 450) all rendered as a loanword borrowed from Greek σίφων „siphon pour pomper un liquide, trompe des insectes suceurs, conduite d’eau, engin à feu” [Boisacq] = „pipe, tube” [Klein] < PIE *twībh- „röhrenartig hohl” [Boisacq 1916, 867; IEW 1102].149 Nevertheless, L. Kogan and A. Militarev (SED l.c.) figured their PSem. *si/an3- „lung” as cognate (!)
with the Cushito-Omotic words for „lung” and Eg. šnb.t in spite of the semantical and phonological differences (e.g., PBHbr. -p- ≠ ES *-b-, while Eg. š- ≠ Sem. *s-). Whether Semitic "lung" has anything to do with or this similarity is purely accidental, should be still investigated. All in all, the facts discussed above yield several arguments sufficient for considering ES *sanbu"/« „lung” [GT] as inherited from Semitic (within which it stands
146 This view is supported recently by Prof. R. M. Voigt (Berlin, FU, kind p.c. on the 21st July 2015): „Die Verknüpfung mit der Wurzel √nb« gefällt mir sehr. Das s wäre dann das Kausativelement”. He conceives „die Lunge” as „das, was blasen
läßt/verursacht'” and supposes a connection with Ar. naba«a „entströmen”. 147 For Prof. G. Hudson (East Lansing, MSU, kind p.c. on the 21st July 2015), „the Cushitic words generally look more like corrupted borrowings from Ethiosem., often Amharic.” He too is „willing to imagine (the) G(ee)z(.) (form) with final " rather than « (the « secondary) and suppose the root nb" 'gush out, flow' (as in 'tear (of eye)') and the s- a preservation of the Sem.
s- causative (Amharic prefix a-s-; the a- perhaps not prothetic as Lipinski suggests but secondarily extended from the acausative).”
148 To the best of my knowledge, the very first scholar to combine the Cushitic words for „lung” and Male √šmp was H. C. Fleming (1969, 24), who thus preceded in that Dolgopol’skij 4 years. 149 As a third etymology for PBHbr. simpōn, one might also compare Gurage: Muher čəmbilla, Wolane čəmbillä, Chaha čəmbina, Ezha čəmbinna, Selti šəbbinnä, Endegeny šəppitnä, Gyeto šəmpəna, Ennemor šəmpən"a etc. "vein of the leaf of the
äsät" [Leslau 1979 III 173], the underlying proto-form of which L. Kogan (SEC l.c.) reconstructed as PGurage *šəmpill/nn-, which he alternatively equated with Syr. sabbōlā „arteria trachealis” [Brk. 1928, 455] = såbôlå oder sābōlā [Voigt, kind p.c. on 29 July 2015], which, however, C. Brockelmann (l.c.) rendered as *”portator” < √sbl „portare”, and if he was right doing so, the Syriac term vs. Gurage forms are hardly related. There are doubts due to their formal difference (Syr. -ō- vs. Gurage i- in the 2nd syllable) either. But R. M. Voigt (kind p.c. on 29 July 2015) does not exclude this comparison: „Die Gleichung überzeugt aber”. For the Gurage word, highly noteworthy is in this context, however, SBrb.: ETawllemmet sənbub-ăn (pl.) „tuberculose”, sənbub-ət „aspirer au moyen d’un tuyau (liquide)”, ta-sănbab-út, pl. ši-sənbuba „tuyau” [PAM 2003, 728729]. There is no indication apud K.-G. Prasse (PAM l.c.) that it is an s- prefix nomen instrumenti form.

isolated), which suggests that the Cushito-Omotic words for „lung” can only be late loans from diverse EthioSemitic sources as well as that Eg. šnb.t can by no means be related with these. All other etymologies suggested in the Fachliteratur for our Egyptian word150 are only worse than that discussed above. At the moment, the only plausible candidate for being its cognate is represented by the isolated CCh.: Gude acembá (-ts-) „Brust” [Str.] || ECh.: WDangla tyàmbììnà [regular < *čamb-] (pl.) "poumons" [Fdr. 1971, 221],151 which seem to stand close to the equally sporadic biconsonantal root (sine -b) carried by CCh.: BataGarwa man-šumé (GT: compound?) vs. Bata ma:sŭmčĕ́ (-ā-, -tsch-) „Brust” [Str.], Bata-Demsa šumšé „Brust” [Str.] | Gidar ssimiá „Brust” [Str.] (CCh.: Str. 1910, 452; 1922-23, 115 quoted also in JI 1994 II 46-47).152 Was the -b an additional C3 in Gude perhaps like in Egyptian? Even more interesting is that the Central Chadic
biconsonantal root finds its hopeful cognates in SCu. *-sa"am- „breast” [GT]153, which, besides, H. C. Fleming
(1969, 24) erroneously combined just with the Cushitic word for „lung” and Male √šmp (above). With regard to the South Cushitic attestation, the underlying Afro-Asiatic root can only be reconstructed with *s-, which, however, does not correspond regularly to the Eg. š- (cf. Takács 1999, 397-401 or 2000, 81-85, §12 and §14). Henceforth, at the moment, one can only conclude that Eg. šnb.t was only akin to the Gude-WDangla isogloss *čVmb- (or *c-?), whereas SAA *√sm „breast” [GT] is presumably not related at all.
Eg. q3b.t „die Brust (als Ganzes, nie im Dual)” (MK, Wb V 11, 2-8) = „nipple, breast” (Ember l.c. infra) = „sternum, toute la poitrine” (Lacau), act. *q ̆3ĕ́b. ̆t (Vergote, BIFAO 58, 1959, 17) = *qa3īb.at > *aq/"ība
(Vergote 1973 Ib 29, §28 and 148, §85) = *q ̆3ôb. ̆t (NBÄ 232) > Cpt. (S) ekibe, kibe, (A) k(e)ibe, (B) kifi, (F) ekibi (f) „weibl. Brust, Brustwarze” (KHW 33) has no unambiguous etymology. Only different (not always equipotential) alternatives can be considered: (1) An inner Egyptian deverbal Wurzeletymologie has been proposed by a few egyptologists. Thus, J. Vergote (1973 Ib 148, §85) explained it from Eg. *q3b (always written qb) „1. verdoppeln, 2. zumeist allgemein: vermehren” (XVIII. Math.-, Wb V 8-9) as the *„doubled” body part. Impressive, albeit there are a few further body parts in pair that could also have been named this way. Why just this term for „breast”? This etymology does not clarify it. J. Osing (NBÄ 232, 796-7, n. 1013), in turn, derived it as a „pass. Ableitung” from Eg. q3b „zusammenfalten (von einem Polster, das zwischen die Schulterblätter gelegt werden soll)” (Med., Wb V 8, 6) = „zusammenfalten, wickeln (Stoff)” (CT, ÄWb II 2506-7) with the Grundbedeutung *„das Gefaltete”, which, frankly, I find hard to follow. W. Westendorf (KHW 33 with hint on Vergote in BIFAO 61, 1962, 73) took Cpt. (S) ekibe directly (!) from Cpt. (S) kwb „falten” (in fact, < Eg. q3b „wickeln, falten”), although such a derivation can only be projected to older Egyptian. (2) Most widespread154 is its equation with Ar. ku«b- „Brustwarze” [Vrg.], which poses a serious phonological question that W. F. Albright (1918, 220) and A. Ember (1926, 303, #11) thought to be able to answer by assuming a partial dissimilation in *q"b < *√q«b < **√k«b, but they missed to detail which ruled governed these
150 W. F. Albright (1918, 250, #106) − with right doubts − Sem. *baŝar- „peau, chair” [DRS] supported by A. Ember (1926, 301, fn. 10) with instances for Eg. n vs. Sem. *r. This etymology was adopted also in GÄSW 207, #856 (with due criticism); Cohen 1947, #395; DRS 88. F. von Calice (GÄSW l.c.) correctly stressed his semantical reservations: „Das äg. Wort scheint tatsächlich urspr. ’Brust’, und nicht, wie vielfach früher übersetzt wurde, ’Haut’ zu bedeuten.” Th. Schneider (1997, 207, #100), in turn, identified Eg. šnb.t „breast” with Sem. * alab- "milk" [Lsl. 1987, 229]. Elegant, but certainly incorrect. First, Eg. š- does not regularly correspond to Sem. * - except for a few instances of Eg. h > secondary (mostly purely orthographic)
š, which, however, evidently, not the case here. Secondly, we have to account for that the Semitic word is connected (perhaps via metathesis) with Eg. jb "Zahn, besonders des Menschen, auch der Tiere, sogar Stoßzahn des Elefanten" (OK, Wb I 64, 2-4) Eg. b3h [< *bl ?] „das Weisse (des Auges)” (NK, GHWb 241), cf. also b3h „hell glänzen (von der Milch)” (GR, Wb I
423, 2). 151 Its coincidence with ES *sanbu"/« „lung” [GT] < *√nb"/« may be due to pure chance. 152 There is a variety with voiced sibilant in the Anlaut, cf. LECu.: (?) PSomali ** azam- [GT: * a- prefix of body parts]

"isa"amēri „breast, nipple” [KM] | Ma’a ma-sému „breasts” [Flm.]. Interestingly, Ch. Ehret (1980, 183, #40) assumed a SCu.
*sūm- „nipple, teat” on the basis of fully different comparanda, víz. Iraqw suma „shoulder” (GT: semantically vague) and Ma’a ki-sú [-Ø < *-m# possible] „udder”, which are certainly unrelated, whereas at the ame time, on the same page, Ehret (1980, 183, #41) forced a possible cognate, Dahalo sùma „1. forehead, 2. in front” [Ehret] = suma „face, forehead” [EEN 1989, 25] under SCu. *sumba „peak, top (esp. of head)”. 154 See Ember 1917, 88, #140; 1918, 31; 1926, 303, #11; Albright 1918, 90; 1918, 220; Behnk 1927, 81, #4; ESS 23, §20.b.2; Vergote 1945, 128, §1.b.4

processes. Where is the rule for the shift of -3- < *-«- in the proximity of q attested? Why should we accept the ad hoc change of *k- > q- under the influence of b or «? A. Ember (1917, 88, fn. 3; ESS 23, §20.b.2) quoted K. Sethe and E. Littmann, who labelled this Egypto-Arabic match as „sicher richtig” having found a parallelism between ES *√k«b > Tigrinya ka«bō „doppeltes me«rō"”, ka«bī „doppeltes entalām” (cf. ZA 18, 369) and Eg. q3b „verdoppeln”, which, in principle, could corroborate Vergote’s suggestion (described above, #1) if one were able to justify the correspondence of Sem. *k« vs. Eg. q3, which Sethe and Littmann rendered „mit Wechsel der Emphase”. But what kind of emphasis shifted from *-«- onto *k-, and where are the parallel instance thereof? Undisturbed by these unexplained controversies, and ex cathedra having discarded the equation with both Sem. *√"rb and *√"lb (#4 and #5, resp., below), W. A. Ward (1972, 20-21, ad §§193-195) eventually accepted this solution: „Ember’s equation with Ar. ku«b may be right after all”. Ember (1926, 303, fn. 10) extended his
Egypto-Arabic comparison onto WCh.: Hausa gaba „breast” [Mischlich 1906, 143] = gábá ~ gàbáá „1. in front of the body, 2. (euphemism) genital organs (male/fem.), 3. fathom”, gàbá (adv.) „in front” [Abr. 1962, 277-278], which is, once again, impressive, but phonologically problematic: as a rule, Hausa g- < PCh. *g-, * ̄-, * -, *«
(Stolbova 1996, 59, §i.5, table 5, 68, §i.6, table 6, and 74, §i.7, table 7, resp.). More promising seems the idea of V. Orel and O. Stolbova (1992, 185) who affiliated Eg. q3b.t with their ECh. *k[u]b- „breast” [OS] presumably based on Kabalai kùbà „breast” [Cpr.] | Sokoro kùpé „breast” [Saxon] (ECh. data: JI 1994 II 47). There are further cognates in WCh.: Bade kúv-àn „Brust” [Lukas 1968, 222], Ngizim kûvá „chest” [Schuh 1981, 271]. These Chadic parallels (whose proto-form would be premature to reconstruct) may well be akin to Ar. ku«b-, although one is disturbed seeing no reflex of Ar. -«- in Chadic *kuP-, i.e., **kuv- or **kub- [GT] (as metathesis
of glottalization, i.e., e.g., as *ku0-). But there can be no talk of its cognacy with Eg. q3b.t due to the lacking
reflex of -C2-. (3) M. Cohen (1947, #230 bis), followed by V. M. Illič-Svityč (1966, 28), connected Eg. q3b.t with WCh.: Hausa kwíí0ì „côté du corps” [Cohen], which is hardly plausible from the standpoint of comparative phonology as the Hausa word can derive either < *kwi"b- (then, one is to work with an irregular k- vs. Eg. q-) or < *"wīb
(then, in turn, we have no trace of the -C2- = Eg. -3-). (4) W. Leslau (1949, 314, ad #230 bis) related Eg. q3b.t „breast” (!) better with his PSem. *qirb- „interior” (sic: *-i-!) „rather than” with Sem. qebā (sic) „stomach”. The idea was rightly declined by W. A. Ward (1972 l.c.) for semantical considerations. (5) P. Lacau (1970, 77, §195) connected it with Ar. qalb- „4. coeur (viscère), 5. coeur: esprit, âme, intérieur, pensée intime, 6. coeur, partie qui occupe le centre, 7. centre de l’armée, 8. moelle de tout arbre (et surtout de palmier), 9. noyau milieu, 10. la partie la plus pure, la plus essentielle, le coeur, la moelle, l’essence” [BK II 796], albeit with right doubts: „Ces cascades de dérivations ne comportent aucune évidence. ... Il faudrait retrouver les mêmes dérivations sémantiques entre mots analogues dans des domaines différents.” In the view of W. A. Ward (1972 l.c.), „it is not likely” and instead, he derived the Arabic term from Sem. *√"lb „to turn upside
down, reverse” ex cathedra, which is, however, semantically not at all evident. I am disposed to leave Lacau’s attractive idea among the most likely cognate candidates. (6) C. T. Hodge (1976, 14, #107) affiliated strangely both (!) this and Eg. q3b „interior” with Sem. *√"rb „to
draw near” without any attaempt at justifying the semantical motivation. To be refuted. (7) The coincidence of PEg. *qărīb.ăt (GT) with ECu.: Gawwada kerp-e „Brust” [AMS 1980, 236] seems very tempting at the first glance, but Dullay k- only derives from ECu. *k- and *g-, but not *"- (Sasse 1979, 56). In
addition, the isolated Dullay word (8) If we figure Eg. q3b.t (from *qlb.t?) „breast” with the basic sense *„front part”, we will find certain reflexes of Sem. *√"bl „gegenüberstehen, entgegengehen, entgegegennehmen, aufnehmen, empfangen” [GB] = „to face,
anticipate, confront” [GT] highly noteworthy, cf. Akk. qablu „Kampf, Schlacht”, qitbulu Gt „kämpfen”, muqtablu „Kämpfer” [AHW 675, 888, 924] || Ug. qbl „battle (?)” [DUL 692], Hbr. qbl piel 1. nehmen, empfangen, 2. annehmen, 3. aufnehmen”, hifil „einander gegenüberstehen”, *qəbol „1.

Addition to „lung”
A third synonym for „lung” appears in Egyptian, which, contrary to Eg. wf3 and *zm3, was not discussed in the first part of my series „Layers ...”.
Eg. ffj ~ fjfj „part of an ox, listed among the viscera” (NE, AEO I, 17 & II, 249*) = „les poumons” (AL 77.1545) = "ein Organ des Rindes: *Lunge (jwf n ffj ’Fleisch des ffj-Organs)" (GHWb 305) is presumably distinct from Eg. wf3 ’lung’ (Wb I 306, 3) as suggested by A. H. Gardiner (AEO ll.c.),156 which is corroborated by the assumption proposed by myself (Takács 1999, 26; 2003, 192-193, #316; EDE II 567) that it is identical with SCu.: Ma’a ifofo-tá „lung” [Ehret 1980, 151, #15] ||| PCh. *√ff "lung" [GT]157 deriving from a common SAA *√ff (presumably *fuf-) „lung” [GT].158 An areal parallel occurs in PBantu *papu "Lunge" [Mkr.].159 The underlying verbal root (of onomatop. origin) is preserved by PCu. *√ff (presumably *fūf) "lung" [GT].160 Cf. also AA *√wf(f) (or sim.) „to blow” [GT].161 No Semitic parallels. Cp., however, Sem.: Ar. fūf- „3. pellicule très-mince et pellicule qui enveloppe le grain” [BK II 647] = „peel, membrane (of grain)” [Baranov 1976, 613] and fawf- „vessie de bœuf” [BK II 647] = "bull's bladder" [HSED] ||| Bed. fūfáne ~ fūfánne "bladder" [Rpr. 1928, 179] || LECu.: Oromo buf-a „Blasebalg” [Rn. 1887, 117] ||| WCh.: PAngas *fūp “membrane” [Takács 2004, 111].162 Were Bedawye, Oromo, and Angas all borrowed from Arabic or do they stem from a common Afro-Asiatic heritage?

In the semantic domain „hair” (including those items, i.e., both lexemes most commonly used, I examined in the first issue of my series „Layers ...”), only synonym (Eg. wpr.t with a specific nuance „side lock”) has evident match in Semitic.

„Crown of head”, noteworthily, represents a domain of the Egyptian lexicon where Semitic cognates are present in a relatively higher degree (possibly three instances out of the five) than elsewhere. The same is the case with the Egypto-Berber matches here. Apparently, Northern vs. Southern Afro-Asiatic terms were in this domain actually equally represented in the Egyptian lexicon.

For „skull”, Egyptian had just one inherited term, whose cognates are solely attested in Ethio-Semitic (Gurage). This reminds us of Eg. d3d3 „head” (discussed in the preceding part of „Layers ...”), which is only paralleled with this reduplicated structure by Sem. *gulgul-.

In the first issue of the series „Layers ...”, I have demonstrated the binary (and sometimes trinary) system of layers (with Semitic cognacy vs. „African” origin as well as inner Egyptian innovation, respectively) in certain segments of the ancient Egyptian anatomical terminology („head”, „hair”, „ear”, „eye”, hand”, etc.). As we have seen throughout this second paper, the overwhelming majority of the Egyptian anatomical terms for the upper torso does not display such a binary system of synonymous terms of Semitic vs. „African” etymology, since in most of them, we can solely observe an extra-Semitic affiliation, where, usually the Berber element is also lacking and the relative distribution of the Cushitic vs. Chadic and, sometimes, the extra-Afro-Asiatic parallels is the only question. The tentative results of my research in further domains of Egyptian anatomical terminology fundamentally corroborate this picture.

Layers of the oldest Egyptian lexicon VIII: Numerals*
This paper belongs to a series of publications whose goal is to survey the most ancient part of Egyptian basic lexicon, classified by semantical domains, in order to stratify the different lexical layers (wherever they are present) in the light of Semitic vs. African Afro-Asiatic dichotomy, which was already suggested by P. Lacau several decades ago. The current paper focuses on the etymologies of Egyptian numerals.
Keywords: Ancient Egyptian, Afro-Asiatic languages, etymology, historical phonology, numerals.

Introduction
The first part of my series “Layers of the oldest Egyptian lexicon”1 re-examined the controversies of P. Lacau’s (1970) old observation on a binary opposition of certain items of Ancient Egyptian anatomical terminology in the context of many new results issuing from current progress in Afro-Asiatic (Semito-Hamitic) comparative linguistics. The etymological examination of Ancient Egyptian anatomical terminology presented therein has corroborated a surprising distribution: one member of the synonymous pairs is usually a Semitic word, whereas the other one(s) has/ve non-Semitic cognate(s) solely attested in some of the African branches of our language macrofamily. A relatively deeper presence of the extra-Semitic vocabulary in Egyptian has also become apparent. The subsequent papers in this series (“Layers of the oldest Egyptian lexicon II–VII”) focused on the rest of the Ancient Egyptian anatomical terminology,2 led by the wish to see to what degree this etymological dichotomy was characteristic there,
* It is here that I have to express my thanks to the Bolyai research fellowship (Hungarian Academy of Sciences, reg. no.: BO / 00360 / 12) facilitating my project on Egyptian linguogenesis, which resulted, inter alia, in a number of papers including this and the preceding parts of my series “Layers of the oldest Egyptian lexicon”. I am pleased to express my gratitude to both Prof. W. G. E. Watson (Morpeth, UK) and Prof. G. Hudson (East Lansing, USA) for unselfishly devoting some of their precious time to correct the English of this text. This paper is a farewell to my dear senior Semito-Hamiticist fellow, my unforgettable Doktor- and Habilitationsvater (ELTE, Hungary, June 1998 and October 2003, resp.), whose tragical premature passing away (autumn 2014) I cannot comprehend, to whom I owe so much. His famous studies on the Omotic and Cushitic numerals (1983 and 1987, resp.) are also considered here. 1 Takács, G.: Layers of the Oldest Egyptian Lexicon I. Rocznik Orientalistyczny 68/1 (2015), 85–139. 2 Part II deals with the Egyptian anatomical terminology for parts of the head and the neck, which is published in Rocznik Orientalistyczny 69/1 (2016), 59–124. Part III (with an etymological study on the upper torso) is planned to appear in Rocznik Orientalistyczny 69/2 (2016). Part IV (terms for the lower torso), V (parts of the foot), VI (back parts of the body and below), and VII (terms pertaining to the body in general, e.g., skin, flesh, blood etc.) are still being prepared, but not yet ready for publication, although the relevant raw lexical materials have already been accumulated and so certain preliminary impressions are already available.

with the outcome that the overwhelming majority of Egyptian body part names was merely South Afro-Asiatic. Now, as in my previous communications, the Egyptian numerals, as part of the basic vocabulary, are examined from the same standpoint so that we can see these diverse (South vs. North Afro-Asiatic) layers of our numeralia. May this paper express my high esteem and affection for our great Master in comparative Afro-Asiatic (Semito-Hamitic) studies, whose department at the Jagellonian University of Kraków was the only one in the world devoted to Afro-Asiatic linguistics in the recent decades.
Eg. √w “eins” (OK–, Wb I 273–276): in spite of the many unsuccesful attempts at its AfroAsiatic etymology made over the past one and a half of a century,3 only recently has W. Vycichl (DELC 518), followed by A. Ju. Militarev (in Starostin et al. 1995, 23), found its phonologically completely satisfactory cognates, which only appear in Semitic, where the latter scholar reconstructed the underlying root as *√w y “to sweep together”, cf. OT Hbr. √y y qal (hapax, Is. 28:17) “wegraffen”, hence yā īm (pl.) “Schaufeln” [GB 306–7] = √y y “to sweep away (hail)”, hence *yā or *yā e(h) “shovel to clean the altar” [KB 419] = √y y “to sweep toegther and carry away” [Klein 1987, 261a] | OSA √y y “to snatch away” [Müller quoted in KB], Ar. √w y I: wa ā “1. rassembler, ramasser, réunir sur un seul point, 5. s’amasser sur un seul point (se dit, p.ex., du pus dans la plaie), 6. être guéri (se dit d’un os fracturé dont les éclats se réunissent)” [BK II 1570] = “sammeln” [GB] = “to collect, hold” [KB] = “umfassen, enthalten” [Lsl.]. Besides, it is this root that, following F. Rundgren (1961, 121–127) and W. Leslau (1987, 23), also the Semitic term for “Eingeweide” (usually taken from *√m y), is derived from an assumed primary stem **mi w ay- “(etwa) Sammlungsort, Gefäß”.
Eg. √sn (hence masc. dual sn.wj, fem. sn.tj) “zwei” (OK–, Wb IV 148) is identical with Sem. *ṯin- “2” [Djk.] = *√ṯny [Vcl.] ||| Brb. *sin “2” [Mlt. 1991, 167],4 i.e., this numeral root is only at
3 The most widespread etymology was its combination with Ar. √wḥd and its Semitic kindred, cf. Sethe 1916, 21, §1; Ember 1917, 87, #134; 1926, 305, #3.4; Albright 1918, 90; 1927, 200; Behnk 1927, 81, #7; ESS §5.c; Dolgopol’skij 1967, 300, #5; Schenkel 1997, 114. In addition to this Eg.-Sem. comparison, which was rightly declined already by V. Blažek (1999, 30, §4.1), several scholars, e.g., L. Reinisch (1874, xii, fn. 3), F. Behnk (1928, 139, #18), E. Zyhlarz (1931, 134–135; 1950, 407), Ju. Zavadovskij (1967, 43; 1974, 105; 1975, 45), and then E. Lipiński (1997, 284, §35.3.e) suggested further cognates in NBrb. y n (m), y t (f) and SBrb. iyen (m), iyet (f) “1” [Zhl.] derived by E. Zyhlarz from *√wgy (1931) and later even from an artificial *√w y (1950) or most surprisingly by E. Lipiński (l.c.) from a *wa (n). V. Blažek (1987 MS, §1.2; 1990, 34; 1999, 30, §4.1), in turn, identified both Sem. *√w y and Eg. w (in 1990, strangely, only Eg. w ) with the Berber numeral for “1”, whose Proto-Berber etymon has been recently reconstructed as *yīw-ān/-at [Prs.] = *ya-N/T [Zvd.] = *iyyaw-an/at (m/f) [Mlt.]. L. Homburger (1928, 335 along with many other untenable non-AA parallels) and H. Abel (1933–34, 305) connected Eg. w to Common Nubian *wēr “1”. Similarly, W. Leslau (1962, 47, #27, cf. Conti 1978, 43, fn. 5) assumed a relationship with ES: Tigre woro “1”. Both suggestions suffer from the fact that the correspondence of r to Eg. is irregular. M. L. Bender (1975, 179), in turn, affiliated the Eg. numeral with SCu.: WRift *wak- “1” [GT pace Zbr. 1987, 343], in which, however, there is no trace of the * . In addition, as Ch. Ehret (1980, 312) pointed out, the WRift term is “probably” juxtaposed from two demonstrative roots (*wa + *ka), which is certainly not the case of Eg. w . V. Blažek (1990, 34; 1993 MS, 3, §1.9) too, beside the Berber parallels (above), could not resist comparing SCu.: Ma’a (Mbugu) wé “1” [Green, Wtl.] and WCh.: Karekare wàiké “each, all” [Krf.], where he singled out an “element” *wV “1”. 4 See Hommel 1883, 96, §11; Erman 1892, 118; Sethe 1916, 19, §2; Albright 1918, 91; 1926, 189; 1923, 68; 1927, 200; Ember 1926, 305, n. 7; Farina 1926, 15; Behnk 1928, 140, #44; ESS §11.a.50; Zyhlarz 1931, 135, §2; Vycichl 1955, 310; 1958, 378, 399; 1974, 62, §5; D’jakonov 1965, 46; 1974, 742; 1986, 61; Hodge 1968, 27, #113; 1981, 410; 1990, 646, §9.A; Zavadovskij 1967, 43; 1974, 106, §6.1; 1975, 45–46; Dolgopol’skij 1973, 111; Bender 1975, 194; Belova 1989, 14; Militarev & Stolbova 1990, 56; Militarev 1991, 75; Dombrowski & Dombrowski 1991, 343; Lipiński 1997, 284, §35.4; Blažek 1999, 30–31, §4.2.

tested in the northern branches of the Afro-Asiatic macrofamily of languages. Elsewhere, it is unattested with *n. The Semitic root has, howeve r, also a heteroclitic variety with *r, which may be traced back even on the Proto-Afro-Asiatic level, cf. AA *čir- ~ *čar- “two” [GT] > Sem. **ṯir- > *ṯ r- “two” [GT]5 ||| presumably SCu.: WRift *čar- (unless < *čad) “two” [GT] 6 ||| PCh. *√čr “two” [GT].7 The Sem.-SCu.-Ch. etymology was first suggested by V. Blažek (1987 MS, 8–9, #2.2; 1990, 36). Which of these root varieties (AA *√čn vs. *√čr “2”) is to be considered as the primary one is not to be answered here. It is, however, noteworthy that only Semitic has both of them.
Eg. √ mt (hence occuring as masc. pl. mt.w, fem. mt.t) “drei” (OK–, Wb III 283): the mystery of its origins has sometimes led to sometimes to absurd etymologies.8 In his prestigious LÄ article on Egyptian numerals, A. Loprieno (1986, 1308), however, all too hastingly and carelessly remarked that “eine überzeugende Etymologie liegt nicht vor”, which was by far not true even in his day. Surprisingly, he overlooked and did not even quote the most hopeful approach suggested at that time by a number of outstanding comparatist authors like A. Trombetti (1902, 196, §3), C. Meinhof (1912, 233), and M. L. Bender (1975, 192), who all combined the Egyptian numeral with NOm.: Kafa kämō “3” [Rn. 1888, 56] = kémō [Mnh.] = kēmō [Crl. 1951, 461] = keymo [Bnd. 1971, 259], a numeral apparently standing totally isolated within Omotic. Whether the similarly isolated WCh.: Karekare kumu (sic, m) “3” [IL apud JI 1994 II 326]9 is, in fact, also cognate, is hard to determine as elsewhere in the West Chadic daughter

M. Müller 1907, 303, fn. 1; Sethe 1916, 21, §3; Albright 1918, 91; 1927, 199; Farina 1926, 14; ESS §10.a.33: Eg. mt < * nt < *šnt < *šlt < *ṯlṯ ~ Sem. *ṯalāṯ- “3”. K. Sethe (l.c.) remained neutral with hesitation: “... aber m mit sem. l, t mit ṯ zu identifizieren, fehlt mir vorläufig doch der Mut”. M. M. Bravmann (1933, 148–149) assumed Eg. mt < * lt < *flt < *ṯlt allowing even that “there is no problem with m < *l in Egyptian” without further evidence. Even W. Westendorf (1962, 27, fn. 1) mentioned the alleged cognacy of Eg. mt vs. Sem. *ṯalāṯ- among the instances of the interchange of Eg. m ~ n (sic). A. Ember (1917, 88, fn. 1), in turn, was “inclined to believe” in its cognacy with Sem. *√ mš “5”. K. Sethe (1916, 23, fn. 2), following this idea, assumed that there “war bei der Trennung der beiden Sprachzweige noch ein unbestimmter Vielheitsausdruck, den der erste Zweig dann für das eine, der andere für das andere absterbende Zahlwort einsetzte, which A. Loprieno (1986, 1315–1316, n. 18) rightly doubted: “vermag ich weder phonologisch noch semantisch zu verstehen”. L. Homburger’s (1928, 336) African parallels (outside AA, such as, e.g., Bantu satu, Agni nsâ) are evidently out of the question equally for phonetic reasons. Ju.N. Zavadovskij (1967, 43; 1974, 107, §7; 1975, 47, §7.0) put forward his strange idea that Brb. √krḍ “3” “cooтвeтcтвyeт дo нeкoтopoй cтeпeни” to Eg. mt (1967 l.c.: “пapaллeлизм здecь выpaжeн цeпoчкoй ‘гopтaнный + coнaнт + зyбнoй’”; 1974 l.c.: both roots are of parallel structure: post-palatal + sonant + dental), which V. Blažek (1999, 63, §3.1) has already correctly rejected as it “does not respect any known phonetic law”.
9 Note that J. Lukas (1966, 202) recorded Karekare kúúnù (sic, with n), which is, contrary to the record made by the IL with the unexpected anomalous m, in accordance with the rest of the comparative evidence usually gained from West Chadic.

language groups (Angas-Sura, Ron, Bole-Tangale), there seems to emerge a proto-form *ḳun“3” [GT] = *kunu [Stl. 1987, 209, #595].10 But where is the trace of a dental plosive C3 in Kafa and Karekare? Nowhere, in fact. This lack of the third radical makes me doubt this EgyptoChatic comparison and search further. The West Chadic biradical root was handled, e.g., by H. Jungraithmayr and D. Ibriszimow (1994 I 168A) as a remnant of their triradical PCh. *√knḍ “3” via apocopy. Interestingly and astonishingly, this is precisely the very same sequence of those root consonants that Eg. √ mt also represents, i.e., velar + nasal + dental! All three radicals of this Proto-Chadic triradical root have been preserved until now, with the necessary Lautverschiebungen, of course, by the following daughter languages: WCh.: Jimbin k ndí [Skn.], Diri hyíinzù [IL] = hìnzù [Skn.] < *kind- [GT] || CCh.: PMasa *ḥindi, regular < *Kindi “three” [GT]: Banana yìntì(di) [Krf.] = yìnti [Zima], Musey hindi [Krf.], Gizey/Wina, Ham, Musey, Lew, Marba ḥìndì [Ajl. et al. 2001, 56], Lame hinzi [Lks. 1937, 139] = hínčìʔi [Krf.] = hínʒìʔì [Scn. 1982, 516], Zime-Batna hídì [Jng.] = híndzìʔì [Scn.], Peve hínǯī [Krf.], Zime-Dari hinyi < *hinǯi < *hindi [Str.] = hinyi [Lks. 1937, 139] = hinǯiʔ [Venberg 1975, 41], Zime-Misme hindi [Krf.] (Masa group: Zima 1990, 268; Ch. data: JI 1994 II 326–7). In the light of these data, the reconstruction of PCh. *√knḍ “3” [JI] might be modified on two points. First, the correspondence of k- in the majority of the Chadic daughter languages to h- in the Masa group speaks for a PCh. fricative * - (cf. Stolbova 1996, 68, §I.6, table 6) and not a plosive *k. Secondly, the glo ttalized *ḍ is not really supported by any of the reflexes listed above, where we mostly find either plain d or its palatalized sequence (ǯ > y), which is not at all a typical phenomenon with a glottalized dental plosive and evidently indicates *d. All in all, if the cognacy between PCh. *√ nd ||| Eg. √ mt “3” is true, it is to be explained by the circumstance that the cluster C 2C3 of PCh. * ind- resulted from a voicing process (influenced by *n) 11 and an assimilation ultimately from ** imt- [GT]. To the best of my knowledge, so far nobody (not even V. Blažek in his exhaustive 1999 book on the numerals in Afro-Asiatic and Indo-European) has suggested this Ch.-Eg. comparison. In a number of Chadic reflexes of this (?) root, the medial nasal radical is not reflected, only a velar C1 (*k) and a dental C 2 (possibly *d), i.e. *√kd or sim. 12 These Chadic forms may be akin to ECu.: Yaaku āt “3” [Heine quoted by Zbr. 1987, 342], regularly derivable from a hypothetical ECu. **kād- [GT], which is completely isolated within the whole Cushitic family. Does the underlying etymon, in fact, represent the ultimate biconsonantal root? In addition, H. G. Mukarovsky (1987, 35) combined these reflexes with NOm. *√kd/z “3” [Mkr.] = *√hʒ [Zima] = *Kaʒu > *Kawʒ- > *Kayǯ- [Blz. 1990, 39] < * ayd- [GT],13 which only confirms the sup
10 O. V. Stolbova (l.c.) was unaware of the Tal and Goemay data, which betray a glottalized *ḳ- instead of plain *k. 11 The same voicing effect of the nasal has been observed in the cluster nC- throughout the whole Egyptian Sprachgeschichte, cf. the shift of Cpt. (S) nc > nz attested in Eg. .t-n.(t)-sbꜣ “school” > (SF) ancybe, (SL) ancyb, (S) anZybe, (B) anZyb, etc. (KHW 8); cf. already the OEg. alphabetic writing nzw for nsw “king”, which was certainly vocalized as *j/ʔinsiw with a cluster *ns- as cuneiform evidence from the 13th century BC also indicates (Wb II 3259; Sethe 1911, 16–30; 1912, 98; Farina 1926, 16; ÜKAPT IV 54, ad PT 814c; AÄG 51–52, §116). 12 Cf.

position of an ancient biliteral root. If this latter scenario is true, we would have to assume a PAA *√ d [GT], which, however, contradicts the development of PCh. * ind- < ** int- < ** imt- [GT] outlined above and possibly also the equation with Eg. √ mt. It is very probable that CCh.: PDaba *makad “3” [GT]14 represents merely the same biconsonantal root (*√kd or sim.) extended by an m- prefix instead of being the reflex of a hypothetical AA *√m T, i.e., the metathetic cognate of Eg. √ mt “3”, however tempting this may seem prima vista.
Eg. √ mt “3” was identified by C. Meinhof (1907, 123; 1912, 233),15 E. Zyhlarz (1931, 135136, §3), W. Vycichl (1959, 33), H. G. Mukarovsky (1987, 45), and V. Blažek (1987 MS, 14–15, §3.1; 1990, 38; 1993 MS, 5, §3.1; 1999, 32, §3)16 with the Bed. numeral “3”, which was apparently constructed on the root √mhy.17 Although J. D. Wölfel (1954, 5; 1965, 617) voiced only his reservations against this Eg.-Bed. comparison and in A. Zaborski’s (1987, 319) view too, “this is phonologically rather improbable”, one is tempted to ponder whether Zyhlarz (l.c. supra) was correct, having ingeniously envisaged a PBed. *măhádi (or sim.) on the basis of the supposed shift of Bed. y from an earlier palatalized dental, which is in fact valid for Bed. y = ECu. *z, cf. Bed. hay k “Stern” [Rn. 1895, 133] || LECu.: Somali haḍig [Rn.] = ḥiddig [Sasse] = hadig [Zhl.] < ECu. *ḥizk-/*ḥuzk- “star” [Sasse 1979, 35 etc.]. Following this scenario, one might be inclined to surmise in both PBed. *mahadi “3” [Zhl.] and CCh.: PDaba *makad “3” [GT] (above) the same m- prefix extension of the same root. On the other hand, it is equally inspiring to observe — together with H. G. Mukarovsky (1987, 45) — the closeness of Bed. √mhy to WCh.: SBauchi *√mKy (perhaps *m( )ā[ ]ay?) “3” [GT],18 since the latter can by no means be explained from *ma- ad (or sim.) the same way as in Bedawye, and — even more interestingly — the common

biradical root *√ y that might in principle be singled out by assuming an m- prefix here, also finds a surprising match in the southernmost extremity of Cushitic, namely SCu.: Ma’a kaí ~ aí “3” [Ehret], which is similarly attested with a prefix mi- (this, in turn, being from Bantu), cf. Ma’a mi- ai “3” [Mnh. 1906, 314]. As for the Southern Cushitic background of the Ma’a numeral, Ch. Ehret (1980, 249, #C2) suggests a comparison with Dahalo ḳáßa “3”. The loss of final consonants is indeed an attested feature of Ma’a Lautgeschichte. The problem is, however, that in the Ma’a Auslaut we have a y (and not zero as expecte d) that can hardly be regarded as a trace of a former *b. 19 In any case, Blažek’s (1990, 38) AA * ami (?) “3” based on the comparison between Eg. and Bed. “3” (including also the Guanche numeral “3”, cf. below) is not well-founded even if Bed. √mhy and SBauchi *√mKy were related to Eg. mt via metathesis. But this − as correctly stated by A. Zaborski (l.c. supra) − is at the moment quite improbable. Another difficult question is how to evaluate CCh.: Mandara *√ krd “3” [GT]20, where, in principle, we may account for the regular shift of r- < PCh. *n- and for a prefix * - (of numerals???), which eventually leads to assuming ** V-kind. The cognacy of the Mandara numeral seems thus phonologically fully possible, although it might just as well be combined with Brb. *kraḍ “3” [Zvd. 1974, 107, §7; 1975, 47, §7.0] as suggested in JI 1994 I 168A, which, however, would lead to a completely distinct AA root. Furthermore, the dental radical is apparently additional, cf. CCh. *ma-/ga- -k r < *k n [GT]. 21 Another surprising coincidence is represented by the isogloss of SOm. *makan “3” [Blz. 1990, 38] = *mākan > *makkan (hence *m by assimilation) [GT] 22 ||| WCh.: Dira miya k n “3” [Krf.] | SBauchi *mak an “3” [Blz. 1990, 38] = *mya (k)an [GT]23 || CCh. *ma-kanu “3” [Blz. 1990, 38] = *m ā kan (?) [GT].24 As far as I know, H. G. Mukarovsky (1987, 36) was probably the first to point to the connection of the Ch. m-( )-k-n/r/d forms, Bed. √mhy, and SOm. *√mkn. V. Blažek (1990, 38) unified all the extended varieties of PCh. *√kn “3” (prefix *m, postfix *d) with SOm. *makan under Comm on AA *(ma)-kanu-(di) “3”. Similarly, M. Lamberti (1993, 70) equated the South Omotic stem with the Chadic m-k-n forms under a South Afro-Asiatic *mVkkVn- “3”, which can only be true if we accept a prefix m- in both branches, which is certainly the case with PCh. *√kn “3”, but we do not yet know anything about SOm. *mākan in this respect, whereas Bed. √mhy can hardly be related as the ultimate root cannot be isolated as **√m .

Three scholars, E. Zyhlarz (1931, 135–136, §3), followed by O. Rössler (1966, 228; 1971, 284, 299) and V. Blažek (1987 MS, 14–15, §3.1; 1990, 38; 1993 MS, 5, §3.1; 1999, 32, §3) supposed a cognacy of Eg. √ mt with the Guanche word for “3” recorded as (Gran Canaria?) amelotti (cf. amierat-marava “13”) [Niccoloso da Recco], (Tenerife?) amiat [Pseudo-Sosa, Marín y Cubas, Berthelot] = amiet [Cedeño de Chil] (Guanche: Wölfel 1954, 4 and 14–18; 1965, 616 and 626630), in which they (except for Rössler) included also Bed. √mhy. What the ultimate root of the Guanche forms (known to us only through imperfect late medieval records and fully isolated in the whole Berber language family using a totally different root for “three”) is, has been answered in different ways. E. Zyhlarz (l.c.) assumed √ʔmrt ~ √ʔmlt (with t as part of the root), which he regarded as a correspondence of Eg. *√ mꜣt (???), but he failed to present any proofs for the hypothetical –3 in the latter root, let alone the enigma as to how the Guanche Anlaut = Eg. and where the reflex of the Guanche r/l- is in the Bedawye root. Later, however, Zyhlarz (1950, 407) offered a completely different analysis of the Guanche word: *ameli-h ḍn “der andere Zeiger” = “Mittelfinger”. J. D. Wölfel (1954, 4; 1965, 616), in turn, singled out the stems *amel(o), *amier- in the Gran Canaria records, but how these could be compatible with Tenerife (?) amia/et, he failed to answer definitively: “Deux explications possibles: ou bien le t appartient au radical, ou bien le t de amiat est là à la place de r- de amierat.” Wölfel (1954, 6; 1965, 618) was convinced “que le mot canarien pour « trois » n’a rien à faire ni avec l’égyptien, ni avec le mot bedja. ... ce mot reste inexpliqué et complètement isolé.” O. Rössler (l.c.) defined the root of the Guanche numeral as √ʔmt and derived it from an earlier AA *√ mt, which theoretically might indeed be a possible source for Eg. √ mt may have originated from (due the incompatibility rule of AA * t > Eg. t, cf. EDE I 326–7). But he failed to answer why the Gran Canaria records have r- and l. V. Blažek (1999 l.c.) has equally failed to explain both the anomaly of the Anlaut in Eg. vs. Guanche25 and the traceless l-/-r- in Egyptian. So his (Blažek 1990, 38) hypothetic AA * ami (?) “3”, which is supposed to underlie the Egyptian, Guanche, and Bedawye parallels, remains ill-founded.
Eg. √fd (masc. pl. fd.w, fem. fd.t) “vier” (OK, Wb I 582): no Semitic cognates at all, although there were attempts at forcing it together with the numeral “4” in Semitic26 and Berber.27 Instead, its cognates are to be found in Cushito-Omotic and they are especially wide
25 He solely relied upon an outline of Guanche vs. Berber consonantal correspondences (where Berber *γ/ - > Guanche , h, g, but also @- is admitted) by A. Ju. Mil itarev (1991, 167–168, more precisely §7 on p. 168), who, however, did not present any etymological evidence either for the case of Guanche @. 26 Several linguists (A. Trombetti 1902, 197, #4; K. Sethe 1916, 21–22; W. F. Albright 1918, 91 [with reservation]; A. Ember 1926, 302, fn. 10; ESS §4.a.13; recently A. B. Dolgopol’skij 1973, 231–232; 1983, 125; O. Rössler, followed by W. Schenkel 1990, 56; F. Kammerzell 1994, 170, 180 etc.) tried to demonstrate a relationship of Eg. fd (and/or LECu. *afar) to Sem. *ʔarba - “4”. The phonologic al anomalies were explained various unlikely ways through unjustified steps in the suggested hypothetic chain of phonological changes, e.g. Eg. jfd < *rfd < *rbḏ < *rb or Eg. jfd < *jfr < *jrf < *ʔrb ! The Eg.-Sem. equation was rejected already by numerous authors: W. F. Albright (1927, 201), E. Zyhlarz (1931, 136, #4), W. Vycichl (1934, 70, fn. 1; 1959, 33), W. A. Ward (1985, 239), V. Blažek (1999, 235–241; 1999, 32–38), H. C. Fleming (2000 MS, 6–7). As pointed out already by Zyhlarz (1931 l.c.), the expected correspondence of Sem. *ʔarba - would be Eg. *ꜣf (or *rf ) on the analogy of Eg. sf = Sem. *šab - “7”. Besides, Stolbova (1987, 68) linked Sem. *ʔarba - to WCh. *rabu “2”, while Blažek (1997, 8; 1999, 235–241; 1999, 31–38) compared it to LECu.: Orm. (Wellega) barʔū “palm of hand” [Gragg 1982] and possibly NOm. *biraḍ- (sic) “finger” [Blz.]. 27 No evident cognates in Berber. The common Brb. root for “four” can by no means be related to Bed.-Eg.Ch. *√fṭ “four” as proposed by Ju. N. Zavadovskij (1967, 43; 1974, 110; 1975, 50), H. Jungraithmayr (1982, 8; JI 1994 I, 73), cf. e.g. NBrb.: Shilh: Sus qq^ẓ [Dst. 1938, 237] | Nefusa okkoz [Lst. 1931, 285] || EBrb.: Ghadames aqqiz [Lst.] || SBrb.: Ahaggar okkoẓ [Lst.], Ghat okkoz [Nhl. 1909, 195].

Berber “4” to Eg. fd was rightly rejected already by M. G. Mercier (1933, 309) and recently by V. Blažek (ll.c.). V. Brugnatelli (1982, 76), followed by V. Blažek (1997, 9; 1999, 235–241, #4; 1999, 32–38, #4) compared SBrb.: Ahaggar ê-feḍ, pl. ê-fḍ-en “quantité innombrable (nombre qui dépasse tout ce qu’on peut compter)” [Fcd. 1951–2, 305, cf.

Blažek (ll.c.) suggested alternatively NBrb.: Iznasen, Ait Ammart, Iboqqoyen, Ait Tuzin ṯa-fḍėn-t “orteil” [Rns. 1932, 298] | Qabyle ti-fden-t “orteil” [Dlt. 1982, 191] = (dial.) ṯi-f dn-in “orteils, doigts de pied” [Zvd.] || EBrb.: Ghadames ta-fad n-t “toe” [Lanfry], which is semantically dubious. 28 Attested as Bed. faḍḍeg [Kremer] = fardik [Krockow] = ferdik [Lucas] = faḍíg [Rn. 1894, 10; 1895, 76] = fáḍig [Rn. 1890, 7; Roper 1928, 179] = faḍìg [Hds.], Bed. of Beni Amer farig [Rn.] (Bed. records: Dlg. 1966, 60; Blz. 1993 MS, 6–7, #4.1; 1999, 235ff.; 1999, 32ff.). 29 There are controversial theories on the etymological analysis of Bed. “4”. A. Trombetti (1902, 197) explained it from PCu. *afar-dig. E. Zyhlarz (1932–1933, 167): Bed. *faḍí-g extended by “ein Numeral zusammenfassendes Suffix *ga”, cf. Bed. ga “a dual and plural endi ng” [Roper 1928, 183]. I. M. D’jakonov (1965, 47), did not exclude even an archetype *šaḍig (sic). Acc. to W. Vycichl (1960, 255, 262; 1978, 75), Eg. fd and Bed. “4” are not at all cognates (Vycichl explained Bed. ḍ- from an ancient *ǯ or *g!). V. Blažek (1993 MS, 6–7, #4.1; 1997, 5; 1999, 235241, #; 1999, 32–38, #4) supposed PBed. *fa[rd]ig, derived from a compound *fari-da-g(a), where Bed. g would be identical with Bed. ga “a dual and plural ending” [Roper 1928, 183] and the prefix *g- of numerals (presumed already by V. Ja. Porhomovskij in PKotoko *gVḍV “four” < *g-fVḍV?). Ch. Ehret (1995, #93), in turn, derived Bed. ḍfrom PAA *dl- [i.e. * ʒ]! 30 Attested in Janjero hē`-a [h- < *p ] “quarter (fraction)” [Flm.] | Mocha ḕ`-o [` < *ṭ possible] “quarter” [Lsl. 1959, 44] = βḕ`-o “quarter, fourth” [Flm.] | Mao (sic) be -e ~ me -e [-ts’] “four” [Flm.], Hozo bεc- [-ts] “four”, Sezo bεṣ-έ ~ bèṣ-έ “four” (Mao: Sbr.-Wdk. 1994, 13; NOm.: Flm. 2000 MS, 6–7). 31 The underlying root for “4” has been exceptionally well preserved nearly in all Chadic languages. This apparent uniformity cannot be found in the case of other Chadic numerals. For a very detailed presentation and analysis of the reflexes in the Chadic daughter languages see EDE II 600–602. D. Ibriszomow (1988, 68–69) supposed an old quadrinary counting system in Chadic. The PCh. etymon has been set up in various forms: *p wVḍV [IS 1966, 21] = *f-ḍ- [NM 1966, 235, #38] = *f aḍ [Nwm. 1977, 26] = *fwVḍV/*VfwVḍV [Dlg. 1983, 125] = *p-ḍ [JS 1981, 113; JI 1994 I, 73] = *(m)-p-ḍ-(w/y) [JS 1981, 113A] = *fid-oḍ- (sic) [Stl. 1996, 29]. O. V. Stolbova (1987, 160, §136) has WCh. *firadu based on Bole pórdo [Koelle] = p’ordo (sic) [Stl.], attested elsewhere as poḍḍo [Nwm., Lks.] = podo [Grb.] = poḍḍau ~ poḍḍo [Schuh 1982] = foḍo [IS, NM, Haruna] = fòḍḍó [Schuh 1984] = f ḍḍ [IL]. The PCh. etymon suggested by P. Newman (1977 l.c.) and A. Dolgopolsky (1983, l.c.) seems most convincing. 32 For the LECu. data see Rn. 1886, 845; PB 1963, 469; Black 1974, 104; Heine 1976, 215; Dlg. 1973, 231; Zbr. 1987, 328–340. The etymological connection of LECu. *ʔafar- “4” to the Chado-Egyptian isogloss is debatable. E. Cerulli (1938 III, 153) traced back LECu. *afr to “common Cushitic” (i.e., Cu.-Om.) *aft. A. B. Dolgopolsky (1973, 231; 1983, 125; 1988, 629, #6), in turn, with special regard to LECu. met. var. *ʔarf- (above), connected LECu. *ʔafarto Sem. *ʔarba - “4”, which he explained as a met. of an earlier *√br . Dolgopolsky’s theory was queried by F. A. Dombrowski & B. W. W. Dombrowski (1991, 341). At the same time, Dolgopolsky (1983, 125) compared Sem.LECu. “4” also to Bed.-Eg.-Ch. “4”, although the LECu.-Sem. comparison excludes an equation of LECu. “4” with the Eg.-Ch. root. For the time being, most probable seems a common origin with LECu. *afar- from PAA *√fr. 33 For the Angas-Sura data see Grb. 1958, 300, #1; Jng. 1965, 166, 168, 180–181; Stl. 1972, 182; Hfm. 1975 MS, 18, #35; GT 2004, 105. Contrary to O. V. Stolbova (1996, 29), who maintained AS *r < Ch. *CVdVC (while PCh. *CVḍ→ AS *CVt), I see no justification for explaining AS *r = PLay *r from common Ch. *ḍ. 34 Cf.

These data, according to our present knowledge, can by no means be explained from AA *√fṭ.35
Eg. √dj (masc. dj.w, fem. dj.t) “fünf” (OK–, WB V 420) is in fact not a word root at all as it has for a long time been unequivocally regarded as a nisbe of the extinct Eg. word *d or *jd “hand” (Osing: *d y.aw *“die zu einer Hand Gehörigen”), akin to Sem. *yad- “hand”.36 A similar semantic shift is attested in SCu.: Dahalo dáwàṯṯe “5”, act. *daßa-waṯṯe, lit. *“one hand”, cf. WRift-Dahalo *daba “hand” (SCu.: Ehret 1980, 162, §ii.a.3). But for phonological and etymological reasons, H. G. Mukarovsky (1987, 45) and V. Blažek (1990, 30; 1991, 210) are presumably wrong in assuming a direct cognacy between the Dahalo and Ancient Egyptian numerals for “5”.
Eg. *√srs37 > √sjs (occuring as masc. pl. sjs.w, fem. sjs.t) “sechs” (OK–, Wb IV 40) is, according to communis opinio,38 in the light of a few other instances of rhotacism of *d > Eg. r39 (attested
35 The underlying PAA form has been heavily debated. Ju. N. Zavadovskij (1974, 110; 1975, 50): PAA *√fd (incorrect, since AA plain *d > Bed. d ~ t = Ch. *d). I. M. D’jakonov (1986, 61; 1988, 67): PAA *fVdC/*fVrC (where C denotes an unclear weak consonant in final position). V. Blažek (1987 MS, #4.2, 1990, 29; 1993 MS, 6–7, #4.1; 1999, 235–241, #; 1999, 32–38, #4) suggested PAA *fira-du/*fari-du/*faru-di. He explained Eg. & Om. *d- vs. Bed. & Ch. *ḍ- from a cluster *rd, i.e. PEg. *fida[r]wa.t < *faridwa.t (?) ||| PBed. *faridaga > *fa[rd]ig, still preserved in some old records as fardik [Krockow] = ferdik [Lucas], quoted after Almkvist (1883–1887) ||| POm. *aḇurd- or sim. ||| PCh. *faridu/*farudi (cf. Stolbova 1987, 160, #136: WCh. *firadu). This reasoning might be valid at least in Bed., cf. Bed. f ḍa ~ furda “Molo, Ankerplatz” < Ar. furḍ-at- “anchorage, sea-port” [Rn. 1895, 82]. In Eg. too (Eg. fd < *fꜣd = *frd would be plausible). The case of Chadic is more problematic, where we would need to collect sufficient and convincing evidence for common Chadic *ḍ- = Angas-Sura and PLay *r < AA *rd. F. Kammerzell (1994, 22–26; 1994, 180), in turn, proposed a development of Eg. fd = *fiṭṭá- < *firṭá- < *firdá- to set up PAA *√PrD, var. *√PrG “four” (though *G is not justified by the reflexes), based on Eg ., Bed., LECu., NOm., Ch. “four” and Sem. *ʔarba - (!). 36 Müller 1909, 191, fn. 2; Sethe 1916, 22, §5; 1927, 60–61; NBÄ 313; Brunner-Traut in LÄ II 582; Loprieno in LÄ V 1213, n. 26 and in VI 1308. Ultimately, the same idea was accepted by L. Homburger (1928, 336–337), albeit in a chaotic form (misquoting the Eg. word as d.t pace Lexa 1922, 176, a rudimentary mistake!) and along with a number of dubious African parallels. 37 The older Eg. root *√srs was still preserved by srs ~ sjs “Art Leinen: Sechsgewebe” (MK, Wb IV 40, 8 and 200, 17). 38 For the Eg.-AA etymology see Erman 1892, 117 and 127, fn. 1; Ember 1911, 89; 1912, 90, fn. 4; 1914, 303; Sethe 1916, 19–20; Albright 1918, 90, fn. 2 and 91; 1926, 188–189; Farina 1926, 21; Behnk 1927, 82, #16; ESS §4.i; Zyhlarz 1931, 134, 137; Vycichl 1934, 42, 77; 1953, 42; 1957, 21; 1958, 378; Greenberg 1955, 60; 1963, 62; D’jakonov 1965, 47 (with doubts about Eg. srs); Rössler 1966, 227; Zavadovskij 1974, 108, #9; 1975, 48; Hodge 1975, 15 and 24, #161; Loprieno 1986, 1308 and 1316, n. 25–26; Blažek 1987 MS, 31; 1999, 39–42, §6; Bomhard 1988, 446–447; OS 1988, 79, #64 (excluding Eg. srs); Dombrowski-Dombrowski 1991, 342; Lipiński 1997, 287, §35.11; Schenkel 1997, 114, Abb. 4, n. 4. Apparently ignoring the fact of an occasional development of Eg. r < *d (below), V. Blažek (1990, 3940) surprisingly denied the cognacy of Egyptian and Semitic “6” and, instead, he preferred the phonologically naturally more comfortable equation of Eg. *srs with Sem. *ṯalāṯ- “3”, which he even extended to ECu. *šazḥ-, *šizḥ-, *saziḥ - “3” explaining its *z- with a shift of *z- < *ls- < *lč, which is attested nowhere. 39 Cf. (1) Eg. rj.t “Farbe zum Schreiben und Zeichnen, Tinte” (MK, Wb II 399, 9–12) equated by Th. O. Lambdin (1953, 149) and O. Rössler (1966, 227) with NWSem. *√dy: OT Hbr. (hapax) d yō, Aram. d yūtā, Syr. d yōtā, d yūtā “ink”, which is suggested to be an early loan from MEg. But even so, the change r ~ d is highly remarkable. Contrary to Rössler, Lambdin explained OT Hbr. d yō as a graphemic error for *r yō, which contradicts the rest of the Canaanite evidence. (2) Eg. ẖrd “child” (PT, Wb III 396–398) equated by O. Rössler (1971, 296, 306) with Sem.: Geez dāṭ “a small amount, little, a little while, few in number ...” [Lsl.], cf. Geez √ ṭṭ “to be small” etc. (Sem.: Lsl. 1987, 269). (3) Eg. srq “öffnen” (PT, Wb IV 201–203) compared by O.

Among the derivatives of Common Afro-Asiatic “6”, the above listed forms, including Egyptian, undoubtedly represent reflexes of a NAA *√sds, whereas the related Southern Afro-Asiatic daughter languages display the original biconsonantal *√sd, which apparently had a rhotacistic variety *√sr, cf. NOm. (hardly borrowed from Ethio-Sem.): Sheko šir-itt-o “6” [Lmb.] | PKefoid (PGonga) *šir-itt- “6” [GT]41 ||| WCh. *sidu “6” [Stl. 1987, 176, #288]: Hausa *sidda [Grb., Djk.] > šídà, Sokoto dial. šíddà [Abr. 1962, 809],42 Gwandara šídà [Mts. 1972, 108] | Ngizim sedu [Koelle] = z ̀dù [Schuh 1981, 179] = zìdù [Krf.], Bade ̀zdù [Krf.] || CCh.: Gidar sĕrrĕ́ [Str. 1910, 457] = ṯirre (θ) ~ šire [Mch.] | PMusgu *ŝār- ~ *ŝir- [GT]43 || ECh.: Kwang-Modgel sidee [Lks. 1937, 96].44 Especially noteworthy from the standpoint of SAA *√sr, is the suggestion by V. Blažek (1987 MS, 31) about a possible ancient areal parallel like PDravidian *caṟu “6” [DED §2051].
Eg. √sf (masc. sf .w, fem. sf .t) “sieben” (OK, Wb IV 115) is identical with Sem. *šib [Conti l.c.] = *šáb - “7” [Dlg. 1986, 79, #16], as has long been commonly accepted.45 The
stead, he preferred to equate Eg. *srs with Sem. *ṯalāṯ- “3”, which he even extended to ECu. *šazḥ, *šizḥ, *saziḥ“3” [Sasse 1976, 138] explaining its *z- with a shift of *z- < *ls- < *lč (attested nowhere). 40 Most reflexes in the Semitic daughter languages reflect the third radical as *š, only Old South Arabian has ṯ (cf. SD 175: Sabaic s 1dṯ), which, following Garbini (1972), Loprieno (1986, 1316, n. 25–26) considered as a result of a dissimilation. The Ugaritic evidence, in turn, speaks for √ṯdṯ (DUL 900), which G. del Olmo Lete and J. Sanmartín (l.c.) explained from *√šdṯ via assimilation. For the Semitic derivatives with the assimilation of the 2nd and 3rd radicals see Brockelmann 1907, 170–171, §60.a; Moscati et al. 1964, 119, §14.8; Grande 1972, 107. Attractive is V. Blažek’s (1990, 30; 1999, 41) approach towards the partially reduplicative root structure of the Sem.-Eg.-Brb. isogloss: he supposed in PSem. an older *šid-šid- “3+3” or *šid-ṯin- “3×2” and so assumed a hypothetical PSem. **šid(with an earlier *ḏ) “3”, which he identified with the is ogloss of Akk. šīzum, later šizû “Drittel-Elle” [AHW 1254] ||| ECu. *šazḥ, *šizḥ, *saziḥ- “3” [Sasse 1976, 138]. The problem is, however, that the Afro-Asiatic evidence does not in any way support the reconstruction of Sem. **šiḏš- à la Blažek, whose 2nd redical must certainly have been *d. 41 Attested in Kafa šír-itt-ō [Crl. 1951, 307] = širr-it-o [Bnd. 1971, 259] = širr-it-o [Lmb.], Mocha šīr-ítt-o [Lsl. 1959, 52] = šir-ítt-o [Bnd. 1971, 260], Shinasha sīr-t-a [Schuver in Grottanelli 1940, 103] = šir-t-a [Grottanelli 1940, 103; 1941, 266] = (Bworo) šir-ítt-ĕ [Brauner 1950, 70; Bnd. 1971, 259] = širr ́tà [Lmb.], Anfillo šir-t-o [Grottanelli 1940, 103; Bnd. 1971, 258; so also Lmb.] (Kefoid data: PB 1963, 468; Zbr. 1987, 384; Lmb. 1993, 379). Following E. Cerulli (1951, 309, §xxiv.1), M. Lamberti (1993, 379) and V. Blažek (1987 MS, 31; 1999, 40) too explained the Kefoid forms as loans from Ethio-Semitic *√sds, but among its reflexes he referred to (Leslau 1963, 137) there is not one single with r- < *d, let alone that the Northern Omotic re flexes do not at all reflect the semi-reduplicative root *√sds. The way W. Leslau (1959, 52) argued for a borrowing (“the Semitic Ethiopic s dd st was taken over in a modified form”) did not answer any of the phonological questions. It remains thus but to accept the genetically inherited nature of Kefoid “6”. 42 Earlier, when the rest of the Chadic data was unknown to the compartaive linguists, the Hausa word was explained as an Arabic loan (e.g., Greenberg 1945, 94 with the understandable note “derivation doubtful”), but the wide range of Chadic cognates (impossible to be regarded as coming from Arabic) has made it evident that the Chadic numeral is genetically inherited from the Common Afro-Asiatic lexical stock. 43 Attested as Musgu saara (sic, s, probably for sl) [Roeder] = ŝáára ( s) [Krause] = taara (sic, t, probably for tl) [Overweg] = tará (sic, t, probably for tl) [Rohlfs], Mbar a ŝírá (ɬ) [TSL 1986, 270], Kad’a ŝírè (sl) [Brt.-Jng. 1993, 133], Munjuk ŝaara [Trn. 1991, 117] = ŝààrà [Brt.-Jng. 1993, 133] (Musgu group data: Lukas 1941, 76). 44 Strangely, H. G. Mukarovsky (1987, 38), equated the Chadic numeral (instead of the Sem.-Eg.-Brb. isogloss < AA *√sds) with the ECu. numeral for “3”, which he reconstructed as *√sdḥ, although H.-J. Sasse (1976, 138–139, 135) assumed ECu. *šaziḥ-/*šVzḥ- “3”. 45 See Reinisch 1874, XII; Erman 1892, 118; Ember 1911, 91; 1912, 90, fn. 4; 1926, 308, #2; Sethe 1916, 20, §7; ESS §9.b.2; Albright 1918, 91; 1923, 68, fn. 1; 1926, 189; 1927, 199–201; Lang 1923–1924, 552; Farina 1924, 316; 1926, 14;

Amarna cuneiform evidence (šap a) and Coptic, cf., e.g., (S) cas=f, corroborate the vocalization *saf .aw (m) vs. *saf .at (f). The Lautverschiebung of Eg. * > was explained by K. Sethe (1916, 20, §7), F. Behnk (1927, 82), and A. Loprieno (1986, 1316, n. 27) − correctly − on the basis of the analogy of Eg. ws vs. Sem. *√wš “wide”, although they did not realize the reason for this.46 In fact, here we have — instead of an the influence of the Anlaut on the following numeral (Eg. mn, cf. Blažek 1999, 43) — rather a Lautverschiebung generated by the incompatibilty of s + in the same Eg. root (EDE I 326). As for the anomalous Eg. f, W. Vycichl (1958, 398) postulated a combinatory change due to the cluster f - < *fγ- < *pγ- < *bγ- (?). 47 Whether the Berber numeral for “7” is also related as it was suggested by a number of scholars,48 is, presumably, hardly a question itself, but the disturbingly anomalous loss of *ḇ- even in the East Berber and Tuareg reflexes has to be explained,49 cf. NBrb.: Tazerwalt ssa (m), ssa-t (f) [Prasse] || EBrb.: Ghadames sā (m), sā-t (f) [Lanfry 1973, 327, #1410] || SBrb.: Ahaggar e-ssa (m), e-ssāhet (f) [Fcd. 1951–2, 1798] = -ssa (m), -ssāh- t (f) etc. [Prasse 1969, 89, #620], Ghat sah-et (f) [Nhl. 1909, 66, 205]. The underlying PBrb. root is thus debatable.50 The attestation of this root for “7” in Southern Afro-Asiatic is sporadic and not without uncertainty, cf. LECu.: Elmolo s′ápa “7” [Heine 1980, 209] = sapa [Lmb.]51 ||| NOm.

Ember (1926, 308, fn. 4–6) was, in turn, inclined to explain the change by “partial assimilation” of to f and that of b to s, for which he, however, failed to provide any parallel evidence. A. Loprieno (1994, 120) arbitrarily extracted the Egypto-Semitic parallel from a common *√s γ, but he failed to demonstrate the evidence for its * - and *γ, which is attested nowhere. 47 Where V. Blažek (l.c.) attributed the presence of s- also some importance with a hint on Eg. sb (PT 448c W), an occasional variety of standard sf “abwehren” (OK–, AÄG 51, §114). 48 Zyhlarz 1931, 137, §7; Rössler 1952, 142, #66; 1966, 228; D’jakonov 1965, 47; Vycichl 1966, 269; 1974, 63; 1992, 385; Zavadovskij 1967, 43; 1974, 109, #10; 1975, 49; Blazek 1990, 31; Lipiński 1997, 287, §35.12 49 There is a small number of Ghadames and Augila words, where PBrb. *ḇ is not reflected as expected (namely, as ḇ), cf. Kossmann 1999, 79–80, §3.11; also Blažek 1999, 43 (discussing the case of the word for “heart”). 50 PBrb. *√swḥ > Tuareg *saḥ [Zhl.] = *assaʔu < **asbaʔu [Rsl. 1952 l.c.] = *sa (sic, ) < *sah < **sab (?)

Zavadovskij (1967, 43), the “бepбepcкaя фopмa пpeдcтaвляeтcя aпoкoпиpoвaннoй”. M. Kossmann (1999, 76, §3.7, #106), in addition, who did not even list Brb. “7” among the instances of *ḇ, conceived the h- appearing in Tuareg fem. forms (Ahaggar e-ssāh-et, Ghat sah-et) as intrusive in certain fem. numerals whose stem ends in long vowel. 51 B. Heine (1973, 282), however, recorded Elmolo t paʔ “sieben”, which continues ECu. *tVzb. 52 Attested as Kafa šabáttō (cf. šábo “70”) [Crl. 1951, 307] = šabatto [Lmb.], Mocha šabátto (cf. šáb/ḇo “70”) [Lsl. 1959, 49], Shinasha sawáte [Schuver] = šawata [Grottanelli 1940, 103; 1941, 266] = šâwatta [PB] = šawāta [Lmb.], Bworo šawátĕ [Brauner 1950, 70; Bnd. 1971, 259], Anfillo šabattó [Grottanelli 1940, 103; Bnd. 1971, 258] (Kefoid data: PB 1963, 468, 478; Zbr. 1983, 384; Lmb. 1993, 385). Generally in Ethio-Semitic and Omotic studies (e.g., Cerulli 1951, 309, §xxiv.1; Leslau 1959, 49; Lamberti 1993, 385), the Kefoid numeral is supposed to have been borrowed from Ethio-Semitic, cf. Amh. säbatt. But what explains the anomalous Anlaut in a loan? 53 L. Bender (l.c.) suspected (with a question-mark) in these Southern Omotic forms borrowing from Arabic. 54 Some of the Mafa-Mada group forms were first compared with Sem. *šab - by V. Blažek (1990, 31, 38), who, however, included in this equation also his ECh. *caḅu “3” (although the evidence suggests rather *sūb, cf. JI 1994 II 327), for which cf. rather LECu.: Elmolo sḗpe “3” [Heine 1980, 209].

It remains for later research to clarify whether the isogloss of ECu. *tVzb- “7” [Sasse 1976, 139]55 ||| POm. *tabz- “7” [GT]56 is eventually also related with a prefix t- (?) and a secondary voicing of **s- in the cluster with *b, i.e., **tasb( )- > *tazb- (hence POm. *tabz- via metathesis < **tazb-?). The lack of any trace * is, in any case, a not too supportive a circumstance.
Eg. √ mn (masc. mn.w, fem. mn.t) “acht” (OK–, WB III 282) is to be vocalized on the basis of its Amarna cuneiform reflex aman (Albright 1926, 188–189) and the Coptic evidence, e.g., (S) smoun as * ămQn.[ă]w, which almost perfectly coincides with Sem. *ṯamāniy- “8”.57 This comparison has been commonly accepted58 in spite of the disturbingly anomalous Anlaut. After several vain attempts at resolving this mystery,59 the most natural reason is easy to be found, namely the influence of the Auslaut of the preceding numeral (√sf ), a quite natural factor leading to phonologically irregular numerals,60 i.e., analogy, which V. Blažek (1999, 45, §8) in this case avoided even to mention as an alternative. Whether Brb. *tam “8” [Djk.] = *tām/*hittām “8” [Prasse] belongs to the firmly established triconsonantal Sem.-Eg. *ṯmn, is heavily debated as both the lack of the C3 and the Anlaut are anomalous.61 Turning against the conventionally accepted equation of the Egyptian, Semitic, and Berber roots mentioned above, step by step, V. Blažek (1991, 210; 1993 MS, 6, §3.5; 1999, 45, §8) excluded every single of the

Loprieno (1986, 1308, n. 28), also here, misinterpreted Ar. ṯ- as a reflex of Sem. *š- (as in the case of Ar. √sdṯ < Sem. *šdš) and misleadingly presented it as a communis opinio, which is naturally not at all the case (cf., e.g., Moscati et al. 1964, 43, §8.59). 58 Hommel 1883, 96, #11; Erman 1892, 116; Ember 1911, 91; ESS §10.a.32, §11.a.46; Albright 1918, 92; 1926, 188189; 1927, 200–201; Farina 1924, 324; 1926, 20; Behnk 1928, 82, #28; Zyhlarz 1931, 137–138; Bravmann 1933, 147; Lexa 1938, 224; Rössler 1952, 146, #73; 1966, 228; Vycichl 1959, 33; 1966, 269; 1974, 63; 1992, 385; D’jakonov 1965, 47; Zavadovskij 1967, 43; 1974, 109, #11; 1975, 47; Hodge 1976, 15, #163; Loprieno 1986, 1308, cf. fn. 28; Belova 1989, 14; Blazek 1990, 31; Schenkel 1991, 116; Dombrowski-Dombrowski 1991, 347. 59 So, for instance, K. Sethe (1916, 20, §8) correctly stated that Eg. vs. Sem. *ṯ are “sonst nicht belegt”, but because of m + n, such a shift may undoubtedly have taken place, and, in addition “vergegnwärtigt man sich” assuming that Eg. > Cpt. S worked “ebenso wie” Sem. *ṯ > Hbr. š, which, however, is an error and does not prove a anything about Eg. - vs. Sem. *ṯ. Sethe concluded that “ So wird man auf die Vermutung geführt, daß in diesem š nahestehender Laut das Ursprüngliche gewesen sei, und daß das äg. nur eine unvollkommene Wiedergabe desselben darstelle”. W. F. Albright (1918, 92 and fn. 2), in turn, assumed a chain of shifts (Eg. mn < *šmn < *ṯmn), where, in his view, “š for θ arises by dissimilation from the dental n”, although, pro primo, OK - has not been known as a phoneme issuing from older *š, and, pro secundo, the expected Egyptian reflex of Sem. *√ṯmn is not at all *šmn but *smn! Of course, a shift of Eg. - < *s- is otherwise unkown. Later Albright (1927, 200–201) worked with the Lautverschiebung of Eg. mn < *fmn < *ṯmn, which he equally failed to justify. 60 Cf., e.g., Old Church Slavonic devętь “9” < IE *new under the influence of *desętь “10”. 61 The Sem.-Eg.-Brb. comparison was supported by O. Rössler (1952, 146, #73; 1966, 228); W. Vycichl (1959, 33; 1966, 269; 1974, 63; 1992, 385); I. M. D’jakonov (1965, 47); Ju. N. Zavadovskij (1967, 43; 1974, 109, #11; 1975, 47). Rössler (1952, 146, #73) assumed PLibyan *tamnu(m), *tanatu (f), hence *tam (m), *tam t and regarded *t- as regular (!) for Sem. *ṯ. Later, in turn, Rössler (1966, 228) considered the Anlaut of the Berber numeral “mit t für lautgesetzliches s” as being due to assimiliation to “9” (Brb. *√tẓh). The change of m < *mn was explained by D’jakonov (1965, 47) via assimilation < *tamn. Similarly, for Zavadovskij (1967, 43) too, the Berber “фopмa кaжeтcя aпoкoпиpoвaннoй” from the triconsonantal PAA root.

three comparanda. For him, Brb. *t- vs. Sem. *ṯ- was an otherwise unattested match, which is, however, not entirely true.62 Therefore, he proposed a completely new etymology for Berber “8”, namely SCu.: PRift *tam- “3” [Ehret],63 where he assumed a pattern of (5 +) 3 = 8 to have worked just as in the case of ECu. *ša/izḥ- “3” vs. *ša/izzet- “8”. This sugestion seems indeed attractive. But Blažek also found (pace Holmer 1966, 35) it evident that Eg. mn is “deriving quite naturally from” Eg. mt “3” (!) in the same way, although he did not explain this derivation, e.g., how did the t of “3” disappear in “8”, or, what was the function of n of the latter numeral. Thirdly, in Sem. *ṯamāniy- “8”, instead of a genetically inherited root *√ṯmn, he saw an inner Semitic innovation from the contraction of a hypothetic compound **tāniy-mā/**ṯanīy-mā “the second one no”, or alternatively from **tāniy-/ṯanīy-min-( aŝar) “the second from (ten)”. All this fails, however, due to the fact that the same PAA biconsonantal root *√čm for “8” appears also in NOm.: PKefoid (Gonga) *šim-itt- “8” [GT].64 A borrowing from Ethio-Semitic65 is hardly the case with the Kefoid numeral (isolated within Omotic) for several reasons.66 It is here to be remarked that the Egyptian, Semitic, and Berber numerals “8” were compared by W. Vycichl (1959, 33) also with Bed. asemháy ~ asumhay “acht” [Rn. 1895, 31] = asimhέi [Roper 1928, 155] in spite of its analysis as a compound commonly accepted since L. Reinisch (1894, 7).67
Eg. √psḏ “nine (9)” (OK, Wb I 558) is a word with a very difficult etymology,68 traditionally identified with Semitic *tiš(a) - “9” [GT] (Semitic data: Moscati et al. 1964,

Besides, A. Ju. Militarev (1991, 242) admitted AA *č > Brb. *s, (?) *š, and also *t (no question-mark), although he did not provide the lexical evidence. 63 Which was combined by Ch.

Cerulli (1951, 309, §xxiv.1) and M. Lamberti (1993, 376). 66 Hardly to be explained from *šimin-t- to have the 3rd radical of ES *√smn (as suggested by W. Leslau 1959, 51 with a hint on some Gurage dialects, where n- was not preserved, cf. Chaha sumut, Muher, Selti s mmut, the vocalization of which do not fit, however), since, suspiciously, Kefoid 6, 7, 8 all have this suffix Vtt. In addition, how could ES *s- have become Kefoid *š- if it was a borrowing? 67 The Bedawye numeral is evidently not an Arabic loan. According to the usually accepted segmentation, the Beja numerals from “6” to “9” are formed on the basis of the pattern of Bed. asa “growing” + “1”, “2”, “3”, “4” (cf. Bed. √mhy “3”). 68 Any inner Egyptian derivation is vain here. Declining its commonly accepted Semitic etymology, V. Blažek (1999, 251) tried to explain Eg. psḏ “9” on the basis of Eg. psḏ “sich entfernen von, sich abwenden von (r)” (PT, ÄWb I 479; Wb I 556), i.e., “9” < psḏ{-mḏ.w} “[one] removed away from {ten}”. However, Blažek ignored that the latter is a denominative verb of Eg. psḏ “back”, and so it may literally have denoted *“den Rücken wenden” (Wb).

116),69 which may seem impossible at the first glance as, in fact, only the second radicals correspond. The initial p- in Eg. instead of an expected *t- is unusual, which, after a few vain attempts,70 W. F. Albright,71 followed by others,72 correctly explained by the incompatibility of OEg. *ts.73 But they never discussed the question as to why this sequence turned into Eg. ps. It is due to another incompatibility law, namely that of OEg. *s , which had to turn either to *s (cf. EDE I 326) or *sḏ (the irregular correspondence of Eg. ḏ vs. Sem. * occurs in a number of convincing examples, among which there are also roots devoid of s).74 In either cases, we get a third radical which is compatible with p- only, the other possible voiceless stop to replace tbeing k, which is incompatible with both and ḏ. The choice between s vs. sḏ was probably decided under the influence of Eg. mḏ “10”. Whether and how Berber “9” (usually bearing the consonants √tẓ or √tz), reconstructed in various forms,75 and frequently included in the Egypto-Semitic etymology above,76 can be related, is disputed. It is evident, that the medial radicals (Brb. *ẓ- vs. Sem. *š) are not at all in agreement. In addition, V. Blažek (1999, 47) excluded the relationship of the Egypto-Semitic isogloss to Berber “9”, which he explained as a contraction of *t(V)-[k]ūẓah “[5] + 4”, cf. Brb. *hakkūẓ “4” [Prasse]. The Southern Afro-Asiatic evidence of the root for “9” reflected in Semitic and Egyptian is scarce. It occurs in fact only in ECh. *√tgs ~ *√gst “9” [GT]77 as suggested by A. Trombetti
69 This Semito-Egyptian equation was accepted by A. Erman (1892, 111); W. M. Müller (1907, 303); A. Ember (1911, 91; 1912, 90, fn. 4; ESS §8.c, 112, §18.a.9, §24.d.4); F. Hommel (1915, 16, #2); K.

The same comparison was declined by C. T. Hodge (1976, 15, #164), V. Blažek (1997, 16; 1999, 250–251, #9; 1999, 46–47, #9), and E. Lipinski (1997, 288, §35.14). 70 E.g., K. Sethe (1916, 20) compared this phenomenon to the regular change of PIE *k a/o- → Gk. πα/o- vs. PIE *k e- → Gk. τε, which has, however , not been established in the Egyptian Lautgeschichte as a regular shift. 71 Cf. Albright 1918, 92; 1923, 68; 1926, 189; 1927, 201. 72 O. Rössler (1966, 228; 1971, 302, 307), W. Schenkel (1990, 52, 57). 73 This reasoning seems acceptable, since the sequence of word initial *ts- is not attested in Old and Middle Egyptian (cf. Wb I 328). Similarly, J. H. Greenberg (1950, 176) observed no instance of a dental followed by a sibilant in the Semitic root stock either except for Sem. *√tš “9”.

(1977, 53) and G. Takács (1999, 141; 2000, 343–344, #8.3). The phonological correspondence of ECh. *g- < AA * is not yet proven, however. As for the metathesis in East Chadic, it is noteworthy that V. Blažek (1990, 32; 1991, 210) supposes Sem. *tiš - “9” to reverse the order of Sem. * ašt- “1”. Leaving aside the equation with Semitic “9”, G. Takács (EDE II 517–518) discussed all other alternatives (q.v.), and among others he ventured an alternatively a comparison of Eg. psḏ < *√ps with NOm. *√bz (stem vowel *i) “1” and “9” [GT], 78 which apparently stands isolated in Afro-Asiatic.
Eg. √mḏ (masc. mḏ.w, fem. mḏ.t) “zehn” (OK, Wb II 184): in spite of the abundance of various etymologies suggested until very recently a completely satisfactory solution has not been found.

Leaving aside the evidently untenable etymologies,80 we may only describe all the considerable solutions: (1) F. Behnk (1928, 139, #33) saw in Eg. mḏ [possibly < *mg] a metathesis of WCh.: Hausa góómà “10” [Brg. 1934, 397; Abr. 1962, 332] = góómàà [JI]. I.e., Eg. *m ḏ. ̆w < **ḏ m. ̆w < preOEg. **g m. ̆w? It is highly noteworthy that the sequence ḏm- was not typical in Egyptian. Regarded as “possible” also by V. Blažek (1989, 215–216; 1997, 17; 1999, 251–3, §10; 1999, 4749, §10) and Ju. N.

(2) There is a long tradition of comparing Eg. mḏ with the reflexes of PBrb. *meraw “10” [Zhl. 1934–35, 185] = *marāw [Prs. 1974, 403, 405] = *mra (m), *mra-ut (f) [Zvd. 1975, 50–51, §14.0] = *märäw (sic) [Vernus] = *maraw [Mlt., GT], cf., e.g., Gabelentz (1894, 99); Meinhof (1912, 240); Zyhlarz (1931, 137–138, #8; 1932–1933, 104; 1934, 104, 106, 111, fn. 1); Mercier (1933, 314); Wölfel (1954, 58); Lefebvre (1955, 276) and Korostovcev (1963, 14): both misquoting the Brb. root as mzu (sic!); Rössler (1966, 227; 1971, 317); Zavadovskij (1967, 43; 1974, 111–112; 1975, 50–51, §14.0); Loprieno (1986, 1309); Blažek (1989, 215–216; 1990, 41; 1997, 17–18); Dombrowski and Dombrowski (1991, 344); Vernus (2000, 180, 192): Eg. mdw (sic) “a un cognat possible avec le berbère"! Rejected by W. Vycichl (DELC 124) and G. Takács (1995 MS, 4, #7; 1996, 139, #35; 1996, 442, #2.3) as there is no evidence for Eg. ḏ ~ Brb. *r, while Brb. *w is part of the root (contrary to Eg. masc. mḏ.w vs. fem. mḏ.t). (3) K. Sethe (1916, 17) and A. Loprieno (1986, 1309): Eg. mḏ “10” < mḏ “deep”, but they failed to demonstrate the odd semantic shift with typological parallels. V. Blažek (1997, 17; 1999, 251–3, §10; 1999, 47–49, §10) excluded a direct connection. (4) Ju. N. Zavadovskij (1974, 112; 1975, 44) and A. Loprieno (1986, 1316, n. 32): metathesis of PCu. *√tmn “10”. Absolutely unlikely. Eg. ḏ ≠ Cu. *t. Cu. *n not reflected in Eg. (5) I. M. D’jakonov (1986, 61; 1988, 67): ~ Sem. *maʔd- “many”, but Eg. ḏ ≠ Sem. *d. Declined already by V. Blažek (1989, 215–216; 1997, 17) and G. Takács (1994, 217; 1996, 139–140, #35; 1996, 442, #4; 1999, 136; 1999, 203). (6) A. Loprieno (1986, 1309, 1316, n. 33) suspected the ultimate common origin of Eg. mḏ “10” and mḏ “deep” with Sem. *√mṣṣ “aufsaugen”(!), *√mdd (!) “lang ziehen, ausdehnen”, *√mṭṭ (!) “lang ziehen, ausdehnen”. Impossible. E.g., how should one figure a relationship between “aufsaugen” vs. “10”? Rejected already by V. Blažek (1999, 251–3, §10; 1999, 47–49, §10).

of PCh. *g am- “10” [Nwm. 1977, 32] = *√g m [JS 1981, 263; JI 1994 I, 165].81 C. Hoffmann (1970, 12–14) and H. Jungraithmayr & D. Ibriszimow (1994 I, 165) considered PCh. *√g m “10” to be an old Niger-Congo loan (cf. Benue-Congo *kumi “10”), which would exclude its equation with Eg. mḏ. However, a genuine AA etymology of PCh. *√g m is also possible, cf. AA *√gm “complete (or sim.)” [GT]. V. Blažek (1987 MS, 41), in turn, combined the PCh.-Eg. parallel with SBrb.: Ahaggar a-gyim (ġ- apud Fcd.) “millier” [Fcd. 1951–2, 444], Ghat a-ǯim (a-djim apud Nehlil) [ǯ- < *g y] “mille” [Nhl. 1909, 179]. (2) V. Blažek (1987 MS, 41; 1990, 41) equated Eg. mḏ with CCh.: Higi gr. *muŋ- “10” [GT],82 which might only be valid if Eg. *m ḏ. ̆w < **mŭ́nḏ. ̆w (nowhere attested) and if the Higi numeral < **mung. Mentioned also by G. Takács (1994, 217) in the context of further AA parallels. The etymology of Higi gr. *muŋ- “10” is uncertain.83 (3) C. T. Hodge (kind p.c. on 4 September 1994) has not excluded a connection with PBrb. *tē-mihḍay, pl. *tī-muhāḍ “100” [Prasse 1974, 406].84 Since PBrb. *ḍ < PAA *} (cf. Mlt. 1991, 242; Takács 2006, 57–59, 62), the phonological correspondence of Eg. ḏ ~ PBrb. *ḍ is regular, although PBrb. *h- has no match in Eg. mḏ. Th e etymology of the Berber numeral is obscure.85 (4) V. Orel & O. Stolbova (1992, 202) identified it with their ECh. *m aǯ- “10” (no reflexes mentioned), which is certainly a false reconstruction.

In theory, there could be a small chance that the Somrai form derives from an earlier *√m(w)g,86 but this is surely not the case here due to the firm evidence for that Somray moǯ [Nct.] reflects *√mwd.87 The Afro-Asiatic background of the ECh. numeral is disputed. V. Blažek (1997, 18; 1999, 251–3, §10; 1999, 47–49, §10): < *mVḍV ~ Eg. mḏ and even PBrb. *tē-mihḍay “100” [Prasse 1974, 406]. In principle, Somray ǯ < ECh. *ḍ < AA * /* /*} is plausible,88 but we have insufficient evidence for *ḍ- in the East Chadic numeral against *d. Consequently, the available records provide hardly anything for equating Eg. and ECh. “10”. G.

If this comparison proves to be valid, the East Chadic numeral can have nothing in common with Eg. mḏ. (5) G. Takács (1994, 217–218; 1995 MS, 5–6, #7; 1996, 140, #35; 1996, 443, #7; 1999, 40, 50–51, 143) affiliated Eg. mḏ “10” with ECu. *mig-/*mug- “fullness”, *mg- (prefix verb) “to fill” [Sasse 1979, 25] = *meg- “to be full” [HL 1988, 1 27; Lmb. 1993, 353] = *mig- “to be full” [Ehret 1997 MS, 196, #1771] = *mVg- “many, full” [GT].89 This Egypto-East Cushitic equation was as

Summary
The results of the etymological analyses presented above lead us to the following table. Note that (+) in brackets signifies an existing, albeit indirect, correspondence of an Egyptian numeral, displaying some deviation in form. E.g., North Afro-Asiatic “two” (*√čn) is ultimately related to South Cushitic and Chadic “two” (*√čr), but only as ancient heteroclitic root varieties in Proto-Afro-Asiatic.

Conclusion
The first two, i.e., the most elementary and primary numerals, are evidently North AfroAsiatic with no match in the southern block of the phylum, which clearly suggests an aboriginal northern affiliation of Egyptian just like the common North Afro-Asiatic apophony penetrating Semitic, Egyptian, and Berber morphology. But the obvious South Afro-Asiatic nature of Egyptian “three” and “four” seems to testify to later renewed ties of Proto-Egyptian with the southern block, i.e., a secondary areal cohabitation, which agrees quite neatly with the lack of the prefix conjugation, an isogloss in the whole phylum shared by both Egyptian and Chadic grammar, which is paralleled by the undeniable domination of South Afro-Asiatic items in the overwhelming majority of Egyptian anatomical terminology, let alone the multitude of exclusively Egypto-Chadic lexical isoglosses. Egyptian “five” must be an Egyptian innovation based on an extinct Eg. *jd “hand” = Sem. *yad- “hand” as a nisbe form, which was to render “5” only on the Egyptian side. This innovation was either very late having ousted Semito-Berber *√ ms “5”, or was simply much earlier than the latter. The former scenario seems more likely in the light of the separation of Egyptian from the Northern Afro-Asiatic block earlier than that of Semitic and Berber (cf. Takács 2015). Once again the set of Egyptian numerals from “six” to “nine” comprises Semitic (and Berber) words (only “seven” seems to be sporadically attested in South Afro-Asiatic too), but, for some suspicious reason, all of them suffer from some fundamental phonological irregularity in Egyptian atypical of genetically inherited Egypto-Semitic cognates, cf. Eg. r- vs. Sem. *d- in “6”, Eg. f vs. Sem. *b in “7”, Eg . - vs. Sem. *ṯ- in “8”, Eg. p-/-ḏ vs. Sem. *t-/* in “9”. Does this puzzle speak for a borrowed and not inherited nature of these higher numerals during a later secondary areal contact with Semitic, perhaps in the neolithic Nile valley (5th mill. BC?)? Finally, Egyptian “ten” is a South Afro-Asiatic word exclusively attested in Chadic (although the underlying verbal root is Common Afro-Asiatic), which may indicate a common decimal system created (together with SAA “3” and “4”) during the above mentioned secondary areal cohabitation of Proto-Egyptian and Chadic (or South Afro-Asiatic).

Габор Такач. Древнейшие лексические слои египетского языка VIII: числительные.
Статья продолжает серию публикаций автора, объединенных общей целью проанализировать древнейшие слои базисной лексики древнеегипетского языка, расклассифицированные по семантическим полям, и разделить их на «семитский» и «африканский» пласты, существование которых было предположено П. Лако несколько десятилетий тому назад. В данной статье анализу подвергаются числительные древнеегипетского языка.
Ключевые слова: древнеегипетский язык, афразийские (афроазиатские) языки, этимология, сравнительно-историческая фонетика, числительные.
