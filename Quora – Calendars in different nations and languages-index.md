We use the Syro-Mesopotamian months names of the Assyrian calendar, They are
derived from the Syriac Aramaic names of the Assyrian calendar. These names are
cognate with some of the names of the Babylonian and Hebrew calendars.
The Hijri calendar.
كانون الاول /الثاني -Kanun Al-Awal/thani. Used for December and January
respectively. It's derived from the Akkadian root (kan) which means stability
and subsidence, referring to the agriculture status during winter as farmers
stay in their homes in a stable state.
شباط - Shibatt. Used for February. It's derived from the Syriac and Akkadian root
(shabat) which means whipping a skin, referring to the cold wind.
آذار - Aathar. Used for March, derived from the Akkadian root (Hadar) which
means roaring as for the roaring storms during this month.
نيسان - Nisan. Used for April. An Akkadian word for the start of spring or
“blooming“
ار
ّ
أي - Ayyar. Used for May. It's also an Akkadian word for light and warmth.
حزيران - Huzeyran. Used for June. A Syriac word for “Harvest”
تموز - Tammuz. Used for July. The etymology of this word is a Babylonian
Sumerian of “Du” which means son and “Zi” which means life.
آب - Aab. Used for August. Aab has an Akkadian meaning “planting” and a
Syriac meaning “Ripe fruits”, which refers to collecting ripe fruits during
August.

means “shouting” due to the sacrifices that were given during this month.

month.

freeze) as winter occured during these two months.

Jawad Yuwono, Javanese passive user
Since Indonesian names of the months are based on boring Latin-derived Dutch
names, I will talk about Javanese months here.
Sultan Agung of Mataram (who led the last “unified” Javanese kingdom) adopted a
system based on Islamic lunar calendar in 1633 CE. While the months are equivalent to
the Islamic ones, it didn’t adopt the Hijri year, instead, it continued the count of
Shalivahana era, resulting in a 512-year difference between Javanese calendar and
Islamic calendar proper.
Another difference is that each Javanese month has a fixed number of days (altering
between 29 and 30 days), with one leap day added in the last month of years Ehe, Je,
and Jimakir (years 2nd, 4th, and 8th of the windu 8-year cycle).

I'm a native speaker of Tamil, which is the language of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu.
It is also an official language of Sri Lanka and Singapore.
The names of the months in Tamil are mostly derived from Sanskrit with some
exceptions (marked with an asterisk in the list below). While it is possible that native
Tamil names were used for all the months originally (as can be guessed from the couple
of pure Tamil month names in the calendar), over the last couple of thousand years the
Sanskrit names became more and more ingrained in common usage. This can be seen
from the fact that the names are heavily Tamilized, beyond just adding suffixes or slight
spelling modifications to suit Tamil grammar rules.

Some of the month names are derived from archaic Sanskrit month names (such as
Puraṭṭāsi from Prauṣṭhapada and Tai from Taiṣya) which perhaps indicates that the

Sanskrit names came into vogue. I couldn't find a lot of references to the old Sanskrit

shows that Sanskrit influence in Tamil was already in place more than 2300 years ago.

Not my native language, but German would be too easy (given that it uses the Roman
names). Slavic languages have a tendency to use their own names for all or most of the
months and so does Czech.
January - Leden
An easy name, as it’s clearly derived from led, meaning ice. Probably because this is the
month where ice is most commonly covering the ground.
February - Únor
This one was not immediately clear to me. Apparently it derives from the word nořit,
meaning to submerge. One could interpret it in a way that the ground slowly starts to
mix with water and mud in February.
March - Březen
Probably comes from bříza - birch - and would fit wiht the next month’s name, which
is...
April - Duben
Dub means oak, which is why I would go with bříza for the etymology of Březen.
May - Květen
This one is kind of funny for me, as the Polish month called “Kwiecień” is actually
April. Just slightly confusing. Anyway, both have the same etymology, coming from
květ - which is a blossom or simply flower. Easy to explain, since the flowers start
blooming again around May.
June - Červen
This one is kind of curious to me. It clearly stems from červený, meaning red. However,
what is red here? What could it refer to? Maybe it’s about all the red fruits that grow
during summer? Is it about the summer sun burning people’s skin and turning it red? I
have no idea.
July - Červenec
Same etymology as Červen.
August - Srpen
Srpen stems from srp, meaning sickle. Probably named like this because of the harvests
taking place in August. The Polish month August is called the same.
September -Září

Září looks like it stems from zářit - to glow, to shine - but that’s only coincidence. It
actually stems from řije meaning rutting. So it’s about the period when the forest
animals are in heat and prepared to mate. Why it’s ZAří then is beyond me, though (za
is usually used as a prefix to mean ‘after’.
October - Řijen
Same etymology as Září.
November - Listopad
Literally: “leaf-fall” (list meaning leaf and pad meaning (the) fall)
December - Prosinec
I’d say this one is most probably from siný, meaning blue with a greyish hue, which
would make sense due to the color of the sky in winter.
Interestingly, the closely related Slovak language uses the Roman names of the months,
which gives us:
Január

Tammikuu — January — ‘Oak Month’
The Finnish word tammi nowadays means almost exclusively ‘oak’, but it used to mean
also ‘pole’, ‘axis’, or ‘middle wood’. It’s based on the Swedish word stam. That’s where
the name tammikuu comes from: January was considered the milestone that divided
the winter time loaded with hardships, the centre of winter.
Helmikuu — February — ‘Pearl Month’
In February the darkness begins to fade away, and the Sun shines more brightly,
occasionally melting the snow. Frost in turn freezes the water again, resulting in ice
pearls. That’s what apparently gave February its Finnish name.
Maaliskuu — March — ‘Earth Month’
In Finnish, ‘earth’ is maa. In March the snow starts to melt and you can find the first
snowless spots in sunny places. That’s why the month is called maaliskuu. There is an
old Finnish proverb about this: Maaliskuu maata näyttää, ‘March shows the ground’.
Huhtikuu — April — ‘Month of Burn-Beaten Land’
Burning down forest in order to make the soil more fertile used to be an important part
of Finnish agriculture. In April it was the habit to chop down the trees in the area that
was going to be burned later. The word describing this is huhta, and April still carries
its name.
Toukokuu — May — ‘Month of the Spring Sowing’
May is the month in which the fields are plowed and the grain is sowed. So, toukokuu.
Kesäkuu — June — ‘Fallow Month’
In modern Finnish, kesä means ‘summer’. However, the original meaning has to do
with kesanto, which means ‘fallow’. June was the month when the fields that had been
left lying fallow had to be plowed. It was called kesänajo.
Heinäkuu — July — ‘Hay Month’
July is the month when the hay is harvested; thus the name ‘Hay Month’.
Elokuu — August — ‘Life Month’
Elo is a beautiful word that means both ‘harvest’ and ‘life’. The connection is clear, I
think. August is the time when harvesting begins. The month has also had the name
mätäkuu (‘Rotting Month’) because wounds infect more easily when it’s warm. I’m glad
we ended up calling it ‘Life Month’ instead!



Syyskuu — September — ‘Autumn Month’
This one is pretty obvious; September is the time when autumn begins.
Lokakuu — October — ‘Mud Month’
It usually rains a lot in October (about 2/3 of the days), so roads tend to be muddy. Other
names of the month have been likakuu (‘Dirt Month’) and ruojakuu (‘Villain Month’). I
think it’s a pity; after all it’s also a very beautiful month with all the autumn colours.
Marraskuu — Novermber — ‘Death Month’
It’s the time of the year when maa on martaana, the earth is ‘dead’ under the frost. The
modern Finnish word for ‘death’ is kuolema, but the word marras is still used in the
context of nature. Etymologically it has the same origin as the Latin word mors.
Joulukuu — December — ‘Christmas Month’
In Finnish, Christmas is joulu, a word based on the Swedish word jul (which in turn is
based in the Old Norse word jól; Middle English has the equivalent yole, and in Old
English it’s ġeōl). Until 17th and even 18th century, however, the name of December was
talvikuu (‘Winter Month’) in Finnish, since that’s when winter begins. As the
importance of Christmas increased, the month was renamed accordingly.

The Persian/Iranian calendar, also known as the Jalali Calendar , was the most
advanced calendar in the world in its advent around 1000 AC. It was developed by
Omar Khayyam , a great astrologist and mathematician of the Islamic Golden Age. It’s
called Jalali calendar in honor of the Seljuk king of that time, called Jalal al-Din. The
development of the calendar required 20 years of effort by the astrologists of that time
in their observatories.
It is the most accurate calendar ever devised by mankind (What makes the

vernal equinox , i.e., the first day of the year is the first day of Spring. Then there is 3
months of Spring, called Bahaar بهار in Farsi, 3 months of Summer, called Taabestaan
تابستان in Farsi, 3 months of Fall called Paeez پاییز in Farsi, and 3 months of Winter
called Zemestaan زمستان in Farsi.
So for people used to this organized calendar, it usually takes a long time to get used to
other calendars such as lunar or Gregorian/Julian.
Here comes the names and their etymology:
1. Spring (Bahaar بهار )
It means blossom, shine, and is a Middle Persian word.
فروردین a. Farvardin
The first month of the year, it’s an Avestan word with no clear etymology.
اردیبهشت b. Ordibehesht
From old Avestan “Asa Vahista”, which is the second characteristic of the
creator, in charge of sustaining the world.
خرداد c. Xordad
From the Pahlavi Persian “Haurvtat” meaning health and perfection.
2. Summer (Taabestaan تابستان )
Literally meaning “Patience Grabber” (Taab Setaan), it refers to the hot months
of the year!
تیر a. Tir
From Middle Persian “Tistar”, the god of rain.
مرداد b. Mordad
From Avestan “Amaratat” meaning immortal. The etymology is contested
because the word is only available in Elamite, not in Persian.
شهریور c. Shahrivar
Pretty much means Utopia, i.e. the ideal country (Shahr + rivar)

4. Winter (Zemestaan زمستان )

simply mean Winter!
a. Dey دی
Means creation.
بهمن b. Bahman

Q: What's the etymology of the names of the months in your native language?
I am a Zoroastrian (Mazdean). Since Zoroastrians started as an archaic Iranian
ethnoreligious community, we have our own specific calendar with months which do
not correspond to the Gregorian calendar months nor to any other calendary system (to
make it even more complicated, three different variants of the Zoroastrian calendar do
currently exist simultaneously). However, the modern Iranian Solar Hijri calendar of
the non-Zoroastrian Iranian majority was inspired in a few aspects by the Zoroastrian
calendar, so it has the same Persian names of the months as the Zoroastrian calendar,
although it is not identical to the Zoroastrian calendar in other aspects. All these
Persian names of the months are originally based on the Avestan terminology:

* The Old Persian equivalent of Avestan Asha was Arta.
** The name of this month is also commonly pronounced as Mordad among Iranians,
which, however, linguistically implies the opposite meaning, “dyingness”. Many
Zoroastrians therefore prefer Amordad.
*** Esfand is technically a standardized shortened version of the linguistically more
suitable “Esfandarmaz”.
2. Ordibehesht* - based on Asha Vahishta - the best order
3. Khordad - based on Haurvatat - intactness, healthiness
4. Tir - based on Tishtrya - stellar guardian (Mazdean angel)
5. Amordad** - based on Ameretat - undyingness, immortality
6. Shahrivar - based on Khshathra Vairya - desirable reign
7. Mehr - based on Mithra - bond
8. Aban - based on Apas - waters
9. Azar - based on Atar - fire
10. Dey - based on Dadvah - creator (i. e. God, Ahura Mazda)
11. Bahman - based on Vohu Manah - right thinking
12. Esfand*** - based on Spenta Armaiti - beneficial devotion



Angel Tishtrya, stellar guardian (Picture from: Tishtrya )
Every Zoroastrian month has exactly 30 days, and each of these 30 days has also his
own name (unlike in the Iranian Solar Hijri calendar), because the traditional
Zoroastrian calendary system did not divide time into the 7-day periods. Since 12x30 is
360, the 12 Zoroastrian months do not correspond to the Solar year unless intercalary
days are added. The differences in the usage (or nonusage) of the intercalary days are

In Albanian almost all of the name of the months are similar to English, and all of them
are from Latin (except July), or just translations or adaptation from its Latin equivalent.
Shqip → English
January
The word for January (Janar) comes from Latin ianuarius , which was the month of
the Roman deity “Janus”.

Janar → January
Shkurt → February

In the past we used also “djegqerrës”, which is a union of “djeg" (burn) and “qerre”
(wagon), why we called it as “the month where wagons burns” is unknown, btw, both
“djeg” and “qerre” are properly Albanian and have Indo-European roots.
See:
djeg - Wiktionary



February
qerre - Wiktionary



Shkurt means both “February” and “short”, is uncertain if it comes from Latin curtus or
Proto-Germanic *skurtaz, but both are from PIE *(s)ker- , “shkurt” is a cognate of
English “short”, Italian “corto”, Danish “skort” and French “court”.
We call February as “short” because is the shortest month of the year.



March
In Albanian is mars and is another Latin borrowing, from Martius, the month of the god
of war Mārs, it's the same root of its English equivalent.



April
Prill comes from Latin “Aprilis” and the Romans themselves borrowed it from Greek
through Etruscan , it was originally referred to the Greek goddess “Aphroditis”
(Aphrodite).
[1]



May
Maj is another Latin borrowing, from “Maius", the month of “Māia", daughter of Atlas
and mother of Mercury.



June
“Qershor” was “çershinar” In Old Albanian, and is a cognate of Romanian “cireşar”
(now obsolete and replaced by “iunie"), both comes from “qershi” and “cireaşă”
respectively, and are from Latin “cerasium”, all of them means “cherry”, and yes, the
English equivalent comes from the same Latin root, but it's not Latin either, but a Greek
borrowing and the Greeks themselves brought it from an Anatolian language (maybe
Luwian).
“Qershor” is practically the month of the cherries.



July
Korrik seems to be the only Albanian month name that wasn't borrowed, it derives from
the Albanian verb “korr” (to harvest), it is a cognate of Lithuanian kasti (to dig), both
have PIE origin.



August
“Gusht” comes from the Latin Augustus, the same root of the English “August”, that
month was initially called sextīlis , the emperor Augustus changed the name, and I
guess you can imagine why.



September, October, November and December
The last four month aren't exactly borrowings but translations from Latin.
In the Roman calendar, the first month wasn't January (ianuarius) but March (martius),
so, that why September, October, November and December are called the 7th, the 8th,
the 9th and the 10th respectively, Albanians didn't just maintain the names like the
others, they also translated them.
Shtatë → Septem (7)
Tetë → Octō (8)
Nëntë → Novem (9)
Dhjetë → Decem (10)

Polish language is one of those which do not use Roman nomenclature, with
exceptions. The months that are etymologically Slavic generally describe something
typical to that month.
January - Styczeń
The most common explanation is that it refers to the word “styk”, which can be
translated as a joint or connection. This way it would mean that this month connects
two years. The linguists, however, mention the word “tyczeń”, which refers to “tyka” - a
pieces of wood cut in winter so they can be used later.
February - Luty
This word used to be used as an adjective, also in other Slavic languages. It meant
“merciless, terrible, harsh”, which eventually was probably very often used in relation
to the weather and possibly that’s how the month got its name.

March - Marzec
This one comes from the Latin “Martius” and refers to Mars.
April - Kwiecień
It is derived from kwiat, which means “flower”, and kwitnąć - “blossom”.
May - Maj
And that’s another month that refers to the Roman mythology; is named after goddess
Maia.
June - Czerwiec
It is similar to the adjective “czerwony” or noun “czerwień” which means “red”. Both
terms are derived from the same little bug, here known as “czerwiec polski”. In English
it is “Polish cochineal”, which was used to produce the red dye. It was gathered by
people in June, hence the name.
July - Lipiec
Refers to “lipa”, which is “linden”. At this time the lindens were blossoming, and the
tree was sacred for the Slavic people.
August - Sierpień
It’s a month of harvest, to which sickles were used. A sickle in Polish is “sierp”, so the
month’s name refers to that tool.
September - Wrzesień
It is derived from “wrzos”, which means “heather”. Heathers are quite visible in late
summer.
October - Październik
It comes from the noun “paździerz”, which were parts of linen’s or hemp’s stem. People
were working with these plants in this month, and “paździerz” was often a result of
such work, therefore the connotation.
November - Listopad
It basically says “the leaves are falling”, or something similar. So that’s the month of
falling leaves.
December - Grudzień



In the last month the soil becomes harder, and in result some lumps are being formed.
A lump is “gruda” in Polish.
The month itself is called miesiąc. In the past this term was also used for the Moon
(currently “Księżyc”), so the name for a month is certainly derived from the Moon.

My native language is Turkish. Our names of the months are an etymological mess,
which you will see now.
Answered Sep 6
Ata Göloğlu, interested in linguistics
Ocak (January): From Turkish ocak, meaning oven or furnace. Literal
translation from the old name for the month, kanun, oven in Arabic. The word
ocak itself derives from ot (fire) + -CAk (place noun).
Şubat (February): From Arabic شباط (shubat), the name for the month, which
is from te same root as Aramaic שבט (shebat).
Mart (March): From Greek μάρτιος (martios), March. It's pretty obvious that
this word is borrowed, as it's similar to the name of the month in English and
other European languages.
Nisan (April): According to Nişanyan Etymological Dictionary, it's from
Arabic نيسان (nīsān) [Aramaic: נסן ], which is from Akkadian nisannu, meaning
"fresh crops."
Mayıs (May): Again, a Greek borrowing from μάιος (maios). First seen used in
1330 by Aşık Paşa.
Haziran (June): From Arabic حزيران (ḥazīrān) with the same meaning.
Temmuz (July): From Arabic وز
ّ
تم (tammūz) [Aramaic: תמוז ], which is related to
Akkadian Tammūz, the name of a Babylonian god.
Ağustos (August): From Greek αύγουστος (augustos). This is a relatively new
borrowing, considering it was first seen used in 1521, nearly 200 years after the
first usage of Mayıs.

Eylül (September): From Arabic أيلول (aylūl) [Aramaic: אלול ]. Related to
Akkadian elūlu or elūnu, meaning harvest festival.
Ekim (October): From Turkish ekim (planting, sowing, culture), derived from
the Turkish verb ek- (to plant, to sow) + -İm (noun suffix). Other words from
this root include: ekmek (bread) and ekin (crop).
Kasım (November): From Arabic قاسم (qāsim), from the triconsonantal root q
s-m, to divide, distribute, separate. Other borrowings from this root in Arabic
are kısım (part) and taksim (partition) and surprisingly kısmet (destiny). The
meaning for the last one is from "the part [of something] that one is allowed to
get," something being the future.
Aralık (December): From Turkish aralık (interval, gap), derived from ara
(interim, break, the space between) + -lİk (-ness, noun maker). The meaning
developed from "the time between two festivals."

Kashmiri Hindus). Muslims especially older generation are also well versed in it. I
learned it from my Grandmother as she regularly keeps track of it.
Since overwhelming majority of Kashmiris are Muslims thus they use traditional
Islamic calendar. For most religious functions this calendar is used.
Kashmiri celebrate Navroz due to Iranian influence and since Navroz is new year in
Persian world therefore Kashmiris ( mostly older people) have knowledge of that
calendar.
However to balance it all out Kashmiris use modern Gregorian calendar which is what

The names of five of the months in Irish are derived from the Latin names, and because
the etymology of these has already been discussed in several other answers, I will not
repeat it here. These are:
Eanáir — January
Feabhra — February
Márta — March
Aibreán — April
Iuíl — July
Six months preserve their old, pre-Christian names:
Bealtaine (May) — named for one of the four great annual festivals in the Druidic
calendar, Bealtaine means “bright fire.” Traditionally celebrated halfway between the
spring equinox and summer solstice (or May 1), it marked the time when cattle were
driven out to summer pastures. The celebration included the lighting of a purifying
bonfire, hence the name.
Meitheamh (June) — the name means “midsummer.”
Lughnasa (August) — named for another of the great Druidic festivals, held midway
between the summer solstice and autumnal equinox (or August 1), it marked the
beginning of the harvest. The name derives from the important god Lugh + nasad, an
Old Irish word for “assembly.”
Meán Fómhair (September) — simply, “the middle of the harvest.”

Deireadh Fómhair (October) — “the end of the harvest.”
Samhain (November) — named for another of the great Druidic festivals. Marking the
end of the harvest and beginning of winter, Samhain was held halfway between the
autumnal equinox and winter solstice. The etymology is a bit obscure: some hold it
means “end of summer” (which makes little sense), and others believe it derives from
an Insular Celtic word for “assembly.”
Finally, there is:
Nollaig (December) — the name derives from the Latin natalicia, “birthday,” referring
to Christmas, the birth of Christ. Cf. Noël.

In modern Greek, my native language, the names of all months are basically Latin in
origin. Many have derived from ordinal adjectives: e.g. Septemvrios (7th), Oktovrios
(8th), Noemvrios (9th), Dekemvrios (10th). By the way, okto & deka are of Greek origin,
and mean eight and ten, respectively. Some have derived from the name of gods: e.g,
Martios (Mars), Ianouarios (Janus). Some from the names of Roman political leaders or
emperors: Ioulios, Augustos. Februarios has been derived from Februa, the name of a
Roman purification festivity. Aprilios from the verb aprire, which means to open — the
month when most flowers bloom, ie. open. As for Maios and Iounios, their names
probably derive from the Latin words Maiores (majors, elders) and Iuniores (juniors).

The natural Hungarian month names referring season and weather, like revolutionary
French, Czech and Polish have not survived the 19th century. The currently used
Hungarian month names are of Latin origin.
They have not lost the -os, -es, -is, -us suffixes just like the names of famous Greek and
Latin poets. These final -s letters pronounced as “s” in “sugar”.
Január, február, március, április, május, június, július, augusztus, szeptember, október,
november, december.

What is the etymology of the names of the months in your native language?
Bānglā. (‘Bengali’ for English-speakers.)
The first day of the first month (!"#$ %&'$( — pôẏlā bōiśākh) falls on the 14th of April.
The length of the months vary from 29 to 32 days.

Titles for months are so easy to memorize in Chinese.
Chinese number characters from 1 to 12 are 一,二,三,四,五,六,七,八,九,十,
十一,十二.
January - 一月 (Literally the first month)
February - 二月 (Literally the second month)
...
December - 十二 (Literally the twelfth month)
So you just need to put number before month(月) to show which month it is.
It is worth mentioning that 月 means moon as well in Chinese.

The months in Vietnamese are ‘Tháng Một' (January), ‘Tháng hai' (February), so forth
until ‘Tháng Mười hai' (December).
(Just look up the numbers in Vietnamese up to 12, and you will get the idea.)
Yeah. The months are just ‘first month’, ‘second month’, and so forth until ‘twelfth
month’.
