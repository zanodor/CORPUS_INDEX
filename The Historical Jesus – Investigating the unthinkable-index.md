# Index for The Historical Jesus – Investigating the unthinkable.pdf

ABSTRACT
A question important to Christology today is one that, potentially, could spell the end of Christianity as we know it. Did the historical Jesus exist? Was there a man called Jesus who lived in 1st century Palestine, preached a unique message of compassion and love, gathered a following of faithful disciples, was arrested and then later crucified by Roman authorities. Is this so called Jesus of history genuine and easily supported by historical evidence? The purpose of this study is to look at the available evidence, both biblical and non-biblical, presenting original manuscripts, commentary and current scholarship. What does come through strongly is the inability to make a water tight case for the existence of an historical Jesus. Furthermore, the possibility that the Jesus story may be a reworking of ancient pagan mythologies is particularly challenging.
The Historical Jesus:
Investigating the unthinkable
INTRODUCTION
question important to Christology today is one that, potentially, could spell the end of Christianity as we know it. This question suggests the unthinkable. Did the historical Jesus exist at all? Was there a man called Jesus who lived in 1st century Palestine, preached a unique message of compassion and love, gathered a small coterie of faithful disciples, was arrested and then later crucified by Roman authorities on trumped up charges. Is this ‘Jesus of history’ genuine and easily supported by historical evidence? The purpose of this study is to look at the available evidence and see where it leads. What one may discover is that to believe in the Jesus of History requires a leap of faith akin to believing in the Christ of Faith. This is because conclusive evidence is not forthcoming.
EXAMINING THE SOURCES 1
Non-biblical Sources
The plausibility of any historical argument lies in whether or not the sources at one’s disposal are reliable and trustworthy. When identifying the key non-biblical sources for determining the case for the historical Jesus, three prominent founts of information emerge: the writings of Josephus, Eusebius and other Pagan and Roman documents. For example, the epistle penned by Pliny the Younger to Emperor Trajan and the writings of Cornelius Tacitus, an acclaimed Roman historian of the 1st century CE. These sources and others will now be presented and examined in some detail.
Josephus
Josephus was born Joseph ben Mattathias in 37 C.E in Jerusalem and studied with the Sadducees, Pharisees, and the Essenes, eventually aligning himself with the Pharisees. In 62 C.E. he went to Rome and successfully negotiated the release of several imprisoned priests being held hostage by Emperor Nero. He returned to Jerusalem in 65 C.E to find the country in revolt against Rome. Although Josephus had deep misgivings about the revolt, in 66 CE he was drafted into becoming a commander of the revolutionary forces in Galilee. In 67 C.E
A



Josephus and other rebels were cornered in a cave during the siege of Jotapata and he was taken hostage by the Romans under the command of Emperor Vespasian.1
Josephus shrewdly reinterpreted the Messianic prophecies and predicted that his captor, Vespasian was the long awaited Messiah of Jewish prophecy and would become the ruler of the 'entire world'. Josephus joined the Romans, for which he was branded a traitor. He acted as consultant and a go-between with the revolutionaries. Unable to convince the rebels to surrender, Josephus ended up watching the second destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem 70 CE, along with the defeat of the Jewish nation.2
In 68 C.E when Nero committed suicide and Vespasian became Caesar, Vespasian considered that Josephus’ prophecy had come to pass. As a result, Josephus was rewarded handsomely eventually being adopted by Vespasian into the Royal family as one of the Flavians. Josephus thus became Flavius Josephus. Vespasian commissioned Josephus to write a history of the war, entitled the Jewish War, which he finished in 78 C.E. “The work, while apparently factually correct, also served to flatter his patron and to warn other provinces against the folly of opposing the Romans.”3 His second major work, the Antiquities of the Jews, was completed in 93 C.E.4
Given his close affiliation with the Flavians, Josephus’ writings are overtly pro-Roman. This is obvious in his recount of the campaigns of Vespasian. He talks of Vespasian’s “great exploits” against the “brutish rage of their antagonists [the Jews]” commending the Roman legions for their “ready obedience” and “valour.”5 Josephus writes about the historical Jesus and acknowledges him as a real person in his Testimonium Flavianum. However, it is more in the realm of an aside that could just as easily have been omitted. Secondly, the fact that this reference is included at all is interesting, given that the Christians were part of a Messianic movement that Vespasian had spent four years quashing. To speak glowingly of a Messianic revolutionary who was executed by the Roman state could have been interpreted as sedition. In Book XVIII of the Antiquities of the Jews the Testimonium is as follows:
About this time there lived Jesus, a wise man, if indeed one ought to call him a man. For he was one who performed surprising deeds and was a teacher of such people as accept the truth gladly. He won over many Jews and many of the Greeks. He was the Messiah. And when, upon the accusation of the principal men among us, Pilate had condemned him to a cross, those who had first come to love him did not cease. He appeared to them spending a third day restored to life, for the prophets of God had foretold these things and a thousand other marvels about him. And the tribe of the Christians, so called after him, has still to this day not disappeared.6
In the context of this section of the book it is arguably a later addition as, to remove it, does not affect the integrity or meaning of the preceding or proceeding paragraphs. The only thing

that connects it with these other two paragraphs is the reference to Pilate.7 The question that remains is why this reference to Jesus was later added to this document and by whom was it added? This particular inclusion in the writings of Josephus has been seized upon by Christian historians for many centuries as conclusive proof that Jesus was an historical figure. Critical scholarship however, renders this piece of evidence tenuous.
Vespasian had become emperor while conducting his military campaigns in Judea and fitted the criteria of a long awaited Messiah arising out of Palestine. While this was counter to what his fellow Jews believed it appears to have been the position Josephus adopted.8 Consequently, this substantive break with his pro-Roman stance and the prophecy that Vespasian was the long awaited messianic figure of Jewish prophecy casts serious doubt over this inclusion being authentically the work of Josephus.
Josephus also refers to Jesus in The Jewish War. It is stated that as Jesus had miraculously cured Pilate's wife of a sickness, Pilate let him go. However, the Jewish priests later bribed Pilate to allow them to crucify Jesus. As for the resurrection, Josephus' alleged writings state that Jesus' body could not have been stolen by his disciples, since "guards were posted around his tomb, 30 Romans and 1,000 Jews"9 These writings are a Christian apologetic for the resurrection and suggest pro-Christian authorship rather than that of a Jew in the employ of Rome who did not overtly subscribe to Christian ideology.
It is noteworthy that early Christians in the first four centuries, preceding Eusebius, do not mention this or other references to Jesus by Josephus. In fact “Origen, whom modern authorities regard as one of the most conscientious scholars of the ancient Church, tells us that there is no mention of Jesus in Josephus and that Josephus did not believe that Jesus was the Christ.”10 Why then would Josephus put forward a case to substantiate the bodily resurrection of Jesus?
Quite conveniently, Bishop Eusebius of Caesarea in the 4th century suddenly produced a version of Josephus’ writings which contained the Testimonium Flavianum. Therefore, one is led to at least question the authenticity of this evidence. Mythologists, Timothy Freke and Peter Gandy claim that early literalist Christians, led by their chief propagandist, Pamphilius Eusebius forged the Testimonium Flavianum in order to shore up a position that Jesus actually existed. This was because Gnostic Christianity, which deemed the Jesus story to be symbolic and allegorical, rather than historic, was competing for recognition as the orthodox Jesus tradition. Consequently, the Christian Church was divided along the lines of those who literally believed the Jesus story to be actual history and those who considered it a myth containing only spiritual truths.11
Eusebius
Born c. 260 CE Eusebius presumably grew up in Caesarea of Palestine, where he came under the influence of Pamphilius, a learned teacher from Alexandria. When Pamphilius died as a martyr, Eusebius, in gratitude, added to his name Pamphilii, becoming Eusebius (son or

disciple) of Pamphilius.12 Eusebius's moderate stance on Arianism (a Christology denounced as heresy at Nicaea in 325 CE) earned him temporary excommunication by a synod at Antioch in 324.13 Later. Eusebius would enjoy the emperor's confidence and become the family's chronicler. He also became Bishop of Caesarea in 313 CE and was offered the more prominent episcopacy of Antioch, but he chose to stay in Caesarea.14
Eusebius, who is held to be Christianity’s chief guide for the early history of the Church, confessed that he was by no means scrupulous (giving careful attention to what is right or proper) in recording the whole truth concerning the early Christians in the various works that he has left behind him.15 In the book: Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire, "Eusebius indirectly confesses that he had included stories that would do credit to the glory of Christianity and suppressed all that could tend to discredit Christianity.”16 Consequently, it becomes very doubtful that what we are reading in the writings of Eusebius resemble anything like the type of history that is written today. Rather than evaluating competing discourses it presents just one.
The writings of Eusebius are largely a Christian apologetic privileging what is complimentary to Christianity and omitting what is not. Thus, it is not history in the modern and post-modern sense but a glorified account of events in the style of an imperial panegyric.
In ancient and modern times Eusebius of Caesarea has found severe critics of his historical reliability, but there is a question whether or not these critics have gone as far as they should go. It seems highly probable that under the influence of his apologetic purposes Eusebius suppressed, neglected or falsified a good deal of the information available to him.17
In his Church History Eusebius approaches the life of Jesus with the presupposition that he was the divine Son of God. 18 However, he does not mention any of the miracles of Jesus, his crucifixion or resurrection except in regard to extra-biblical sources. Furthermore, Josephus appears to be one of his principal sources. Eusebius copies more information from Antiquities of the Jews and the Jewish War than he does from the New Testament including the highly controverted Testimonium Flavianum.19
Being the first author of antiquity to cite the Testimonium, he quotes it three times in the hope of defending the historicity of the Gospels.20 According to Jonathan Armstrong, Eusebius used this passage to affirm the essential correctness of the evangelists in reaction to a spurious account of Jesus’ life entitled the Acts of Pilate.21 The Acts of Pilate was a work of imperial

propaganda that denied the divinity and resurrection of Jesus.22 It posed as an official document written by Pilate and was disseminated as a student textbook during the great persecution of Christianity by the Roman emperor, Diocletian (303-311 CE). It was designed to undermine the credibility of the four evangelists.23
Eusebius reconstructed his life of Jesus in a way that challenged this counter tradition and reasserted the beliefs inherent in the Gospels. Evidently, there is little to recommend the writings of Eusebius as serious historical annals supporting the case for an historical Jesus. Unlike the Acts of Pilate there do exist other, less spurious Roman sources that may cast further light on the question at hand.
Roman Records
It is interesting to note that, traditionally, the Romans kept very detailed records of all legal proceedings occurring throughout the empire. “Rome was one of the most bureaucratic civilisations in history. The Romans kept records about every detail of life – births, marriages, adoptions, taxes, olive production, and legal documents.”24 However, there appears to be no references in any legal record of the time to the arrest and execution under Roman law of a man named Jesus. What Roman records do reveal however, are several references to the Christian Religious cult and general references to Christus, the founder of the cult. Cornelius Tacitus (55-120 CE) was considered, by his contemporaries, to be the greatest historian of ancient Rome. In the Roman Annals 15.44, he speaks of Emperor Nero going after Christians, in hopes to draw away attention from himself after Rome's fire of 64 CE.
“[Nero] falsely charged [the Christians] with the guilt [fire in Rome], and punished Christians, who were hated for their enormities...25
Evan’s refer to this source stating that it firmly established, in the minds of many, a nonChristian confirmation of the crucifixion of Jesus.26 However, Richard Carrier argues that the following line from the same source is a later Christian interpolation: Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberias.27 Hence, Tacitus’ writings confirming the existence of an historical Jesus are unreliable. This excerpt is dated approximately 50 years after the event. Tacitus calls Pilate the "procurator" of Judea, when he was in fact a "prefect," indicating the influence of hearsay information from his own day.28
Again, there is no incontrovertible proof that a historical Jesus ever existed. What does exist is strong evidence for a Jesus cult and a set of doctrines associated with a figure referred to as Christus. Important to note, hearsay or the oral tradition regarding Jesus is not without its value. The fact that this hearsay existed at all suggests some Christians believed that there was a real person to whom the appellation, Christus belonged. Thus, there is certainly evidence for a

tradition, affirming belief in the historical Jesus. Other Roman sources corroborate this and require examination.
At different periods throughout the first four centuries CE, Rome had cause to be concerned about the activities of Christians within the provinces. Pliny’s letter to emperor Trajan is a prime example. Pliny the Younger, a Roman governor of Bithynia in Asia Minor around c.112 CE, drafted a Letter to Trajan expressing his concerns about the Christian movement.
I have asked them in person if they are Christians, and if they admit it, I repeat the questions a second and third time, with a warning of the punishment awaiting them. If they persist, I order them to be led away to execution ... There have been others similarly fanatical who have been Roman citizens. I have entered them on the list of persons to be sent to Rome for trial...
They also declared that the sum total of their guilt or error amounted to no more than this: that they had met regularly before dawn on a fixed day to chant verses alternately among themselves in honour of Christ as if to a god.29
This epistle does not prove the existence of an historical Christ but that there were Christians, which is not in question here. Notice that it never mentions an alleged historical figure named "Jesus" but refers to a Christ figure. Similarly, writings by the Roman historian Gaius Suetonius Tranquillas do little more to advance a strong case for an historical Jesus.
Gaius Suetonius Tranquillas, a contemporary of Tacitus and chief secretary of Emperor Hadrian (117-138 CE), records in his Life of Claudius (XXv.4):
As the Jews were making constant disturbances at the instigation of Chrestus, he expelled them from Rome.30
Chrestus was a generic term for "Messiah." Josephus, in his last Book of Antiquities of the Jews (Book XX) mentions numerous would-be Messiah or Christ figures in Judea who were part of a general Messianic movement, yet none of them are described as the alleged Jesus of Christianity.31 So we have come to a juncture whereby there appears to be very little, if no real evidence for an historical Jesus. Does this mean Jesus did not exist? Not necessarily; what it suggests is that historical evidence is very scarce when it comes to making this case. Other evidence, such as the letters by Clement of Rome have been submitted as additional evidence; however, they have been shown in more recent times to be elaborate forgeries.
Clement of Rome was said by Eusebius to have been the fourth Bishop of Rome around 90 C.E. However, scholars now know that numerous letters attributed to this "Clement of Rome" were forged in the fourth and fifth centuries.32 For instance, the First Epistle to the Corinthians c. 96 CE included in Eusebius’ Church History.33 Eusebius in the 4th century claimed that these

letters had appeared recently, thus calling into question their authenticity.34 If secular sources are inconclusive, then, perhaps scriptural sources can provide more certainty.
EXAMINING THE SOURCES 2
Biblical Sources and other Sacred Texts
The Letters of Paul
The earliest recorded writings in the New Testament are the Letters of St Paul. These epistles were written before 70 CE and pre-date the four canonical Gospels. Written c. 50 CE, not all of the letters attributed to Paul were composed by him. Of the 13 letters attributed to Paul, only seven were written by him: 1Thessalonians, Galatians, 1-2 Corinthians, Romans, Philemon and Philippians. Thus, the Pastorals (1-2 Timothy and Titus) and other letters ascribed to Paul are deemed to be the work of others (non-Pauline). In addition, the letters attributed to Peter, James and Jude were more than likely written by others and credited to them.35
Freke and Gandy postulate that these non-Pauline epistles were written in the second century CE to combat internal divisions.36 They were a response to a strong tradition of Christian Gnosticism and sought to reassert the authority of the institutional Church along with a literal understanding of the Jesus story. Fascinatingly, in all of the genuine Pauline epistles there is not a single clear reference to an historical Jesus. Paul relates to his audience a mystical figure and not a real historical person. In Romans 6: 8 Paul speaks of Jesus in an allegorical manner: “Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him.” His focus is the crucified and resurrected Christ whose significance is entirely mystical.
Raymond Brown states that Paul was a theologian and that he did not write his theology within the framework of Jesus’ earthly ministry.37 He makes no mention of Nazareth, Jerusalem, Pilate or any so called historical events relating to the life of Jesus. He does refer to John, James and Cephas (commonly thought to refer to Peter) but there is no direct indication from these references that they correlate to the disciples mentioned in the Gospels. For example, Paul gives no suggestion that the Cephas he meets in Jerusalem or Antioch is the same as the Peter of the Gospels who personally knew Jesus.
In fact, Paul is extremely hostile toward Cephas: “When Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he stood condemned” (Galatians 2: 11). This statement does not reflect that Paul considered Cephas the right hand man of an historical Messiah. Even references to James being the brother of Jesus in Galatians 1: 19 is not conclusive evidence either. The word “brother,” as used in this context, could equally refer to a common Christian practice whereby fellow Christians referred to each other as brothers and sisters (adelphoi) in Christ.38
Interestingly, Paul only quotes Jesus once and this is in relation to the Eucharist (1Corinthians 11:24).39 There is no mention of his parables and teachings or his healing ministry. The Jesus of Pauline literature is primarily an inner spiritual experience that one has rather than a

historical person whose teachings one follows: “Examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith; test yourselves. Do you not realise that Christ Jesus is in you--unless, of course, you fail the test?” (2Corinthians 13:5). Conversely, in the Pastorals we encounter a very different Paul.
Instead of a Paul concerned with inner transformation we discover him more focussed on Church law and ecclesiastical structures. For example, 1Timothy 1-3 outlines the roles of Bishops and Deacons and Chapters 4-6 describe the role and duty of all believers clearly delineating a hierarchical structure. Historically, these Christian institutions were not in place in any highly organised way in the 40s and 50s when Paul was writing and appear anachronistic. It would seem that this level of Church organisation did not evolve until c. 110 CE, primarily in Antioch, then developing further from there.40
The letter of 1Timothy attributed to Paul is an attempt to write in the perceived style of Paul by an anonymous author. The Gospels emerge later and arguably give to the mystical Jesus of Paul an historical setting. The four canonical Gospels of Mark, Matthew, Luke and John were purportedly written between 70-100 CE, with Mark being the earliest. Traditionally, it has been considered that the events surrounding the historical Jesus gave rise to an oral tradition that was later written down and edited.41 However, the opposite may be true. It appears that any sort of historical context for the life of Jesus was born with the written tradition – the Gospels, which debatably predate the non-Pauline epistles.
The Gospels
In the four Gospels attributed to the evangelists the mystical Jesus of Paul is given a geographical and historical context. Nevertheless, while situated within an historical context the Gospels betray a number of inaccuracies and contradictions. In Mark the author seems to possess a lamentable knowledge of Palestinian geography. For instance, in Mark 7: 31 Jesus is reported as going through Sidon on his way to Tyre and the Sea of Galilee. The only problem is, Sidon is in the opposite direction to the Sea of Galilee. Furthermore, there was no road connecting the two locations in the 1st century CE.42
Regarding the Synoptic Gospels, it is generally accepted that the authors of Matthew and Luke used Mark as a basis for their Gospels adding the infancy narratives (Matthew 1:18-2: 18; Luke 2: 1-38), genealogies (Matthew 1: 1-17; Luke 3: 23-38) and other passages, as well as their own theological slant.43 Interestingly, the genealogies in Matthew and Luke disagree. Matthew names Jacob (Matthew 1: 16) as the father of Joseph (husband of Mary) whereas Luke names Heli (Luke: 3: 23) as Joseph’s father. Also, after Joseph’s father Matthan (also Matthat) is named, the genealogies are completely different from each other. Furthermore, the date of Jesus’ birth, as given in Luke and Matthew, contradict one another.
Luke states that Jesus was born at the time of the census when Quirinius was Governor of Syria (Luke 2: 1-2). This took place in 6 CE. Yet Matthew reports that Jesus was born during the reign of King Herod who died in 4 BCE (Matthew 2:1). Matthew even contradicts himself and

states that Jesus and his cousin John were born six months apart during the reign of Herod; however, he portrays Mary with child at the time of the census in 6 CE (Jesus is born in Bethlehem). Mark, on the other hand, does not mention Bethlehem, the virgin birth or Jesus’ Davidic descent. Alternatively, John’s Gospel is quite unique and stands apart from the Synoptics.
The Gospel of John reflects more a theological discourse than anything truly historical. It does not borrow from the Synoptics and presents extended metaphorical discourses, such as the bread of heaven (6:25-59), and a long, one-on-one dialogue with the religious leader Nicodemus about deep theological truths (3:1-15). What is noteworthy is that many of the places cited in John’s Gospel are real places and demonstrates an impressive level of topographical accuracy.44 For example, in John 5 there is very accurate information given in regard to the pool at Bethesda. It is perfectly accurate as to name, location and construction. In addition, details about Jerusalem are extremely accurate such as the reference to the pool of Siloam in John 9: 7, Solomon’s Portico in John 10: 22-23 and the stone pavement of Pilate’s Praetorium in John 19: 13. This reflects a precise knowledge of Palestine before the destruction of the Temple in 70 CE.45
Of course, the topographical accuracy of John is not tantamount to proof of an historical Jesus. What it does suggest is that at least the setting in which Jesus is situated is authentic. When one compares John with the Synoptics, inconsistencies become apparent. For example, John’s Jesus preaches mainly in Jerusalem with occasional visits to Galilee unlike the Synoptics who have Jesus primarily in Galilee (Mark and Matthew) and in Judea (Luke).46 Raymond Brown would argue that John “is an attempt to prevent the kerygmatic preaching of the Church from being mythologised and divorced from [an alleged] history of Jesus of Nazareth.”47 Thus, it indicates an attempt (c. 90-100 CE) to recast the story of Jesus within an historical setting due to the original story clearly lacking one.
Whether one contends the historical Jesus existed or not, does not remove the fact that there are numerous historical discrepancies across the four Gospels. Luke\Acts which purportedly recounts the activities of the apostles – eyewitnesses to the historical Jesus – is equally unreliable when it comes to making a case for the historical Jesus.
The Acts of the Apostles
A traditional understanding of early Church history is that the 12 apostles, hand-picked by Jesus, played a decisive role in establishing the Church following the resurrection. These are supposedly recorded in the Acts of the Apostles. However, of the 12 Apostles, Acts concerns itself only with Peter who disappears altogether after Chapter 15. Then we hear only of Paul who was not one of the 12 and certainly not an eyewitness to the historical Jesus. When analysing this text there do appear many internal inconsistencies and these require some attention.
In Chapter 9 it is said that during Paul’s vision on the road to Damascus his companions heard a voice but saw no one. However, in Chapter 22: 9 Paul states “[that his] companions saw the

light, but they did not understand the voice ... who was speaking to [him].” In addition, Acts seems to contradict Galatians in identifying Ananias in Damascus as the one who assisted Paul following his vision. Paul does not mention Ananias in recounting the same event in his epistle to the Galatians. Moreover, he is located by Galatians as being in Syria and Cilicia following his vision and conversion and not Jerusalem as stated by Acts (cf. Acts 9: 17; 26-30 and Galatians 1: 18-24).
In dating this book, Acts is identified by Irenaeus and Tertullian in the 2nd century CE. as authentically sacred scripture but just one generation earlier, it is not mentioned at all by Justin Martyr. This suggests that the book may have appeared between 150 and 177 CE as there is no mention of it prior to 177 CE. 48 Consequently, we are dealing with a source that is not proximate to the historical Jesus rendering historical accuracy as doubtful.
Apocryphal Gospel of Thomas
There were many writings which did not make it into the final canon of Christian scripture. Among these are the Gospel of Mary Magdalene, The Gospel of Judas, the Gospel of Peter and the Shepherd of Hermes. The Gospel of Thomas, discovered at Nag Hammadi in Upper Egypt in 1945, is believed to have originated as early as 50 CE. A general date given for the Gospel of Thomas is c. 50-140 CE.49 This would mean that the possibility exists for this Gospel to be among the closest writings to the alleged life of an historical Jesus.
The Gospel of Thomas is largely a collection of sayings and does not include an infancy, passion or resurrection narrative. The authorship of this Gospel is attributed to Didymos Judas Thomas, the twin. There are no historical references of any note and what we are presented with is a series of pithy sayings in the form of 114 verses. Some bear a close resemblance to the words of Jesus in the Synoptics. For example, in Verse 5 it reads “Jesus said, "Know what is in front of your face, and what is hidden from you will be disclosed to you. For there is nothing hidden that will not be revealed"50 (cf. Matthew 10: 26; Luke 8:17).
The fact that this Gospel consists only of sayings supports a thesis that the infancy, death and resurrection narratives may have been later additions betraying the influence of various Mystery cults.51 Many Mystery cults presented a virgin birth, while at their core were narratives concerning a dying and resurrecting God-man. In Egypt he was called Osiris, in Greece Dionysus, in Asia Minor Attis, in Syria Adonis, in Italy Bacchus and in Persia Mithras. All of these figures were essentially the same mythical being reinterpreted to make sense in a particular socio-historical and cultural milieu.52 Greek mythology, for example, would have filtered through into the local cultures of Palestine and made its presence felt. Greek was the spoken language of the day and was used for writing the Gospels. Local cultures in Palestine would have been influenced by Greek mythology as a result.53 Syncretism was a common

phenomenon during this period and the appropriating of symbols, icons and mythology from other cults was not unusual.54
The myths of Dionysus, Mithras and Attis, would in all probability have been syncretised with elements of the Jesus story. For example, the infant Jesus was said to have been visited by three Magi. The Magi were followers of the Persian God-man Mithras (the Persian equivalent of Dionysus). His birthday was celebrated on December 25th, the same day selected by the Church for the celebration of Jesus’ birthday. Mithras’ birth was even said to have been witnessed by three shepherds.55 Furthermore, it was held by followers of Mithras that he was born of a virgin.56 Another key religious tradition, Judaism, attests to the existence of an historical Jesus.
The Talmud
Although there is arguably no strong evidence for the historical Jesus among Jewish historians, there is a handful of references from within the Jewish Talmud that are sometimes enlisted as evidence for the historical Jesus. The Babylonian Talmud Sanhedrin 43a, compiled between 70 and 200 CE, speaks of Jesus' crucifixion, saying: “On the eve of the Passover Yeshu was hanged.”57
In the Jewish Talmud (written in Hebrew) the word Yeshu is a shortened form of Yehoshua or "Joshua," which in Greek becomes "Jesus" (English transliteration of the Greek form, Iesous). The fact that the Talmud mentions the word Yeshu is not extraordinary. Yeshu was an extremely common name that could refer to any number of people. In fact, Josephus mentions at least 10 different Yeshus. Even if the above reference to Yeshu does refer to the Christian Jesus and not some other Yeshu, it cannot be taken as proof of Jesus' existence. This is because it was written so late.
Although based on older writings, the Talmud was not written until 200 C.E. and we do not know whether these were early passages or based on later traditions. The rabbis cited in the Talmud are so vague in their chronology of Jesus that they differ by as much as 200 years in the dates they assign. For example, over 20 Yeshus are cited by Rabbis in the Talmud and some, like Yeshu ben Stada (sometimes equated with Yeshu ben Pandira) lived in the second century BCE.58 As well as Judaism, Greek philosophers expressed belief in an historical Jesus.

Celsus
Celsus was a second century Greek Philosopher and critic of early Christianity. He wrote The True Doctrine in c. 170 CE, a critique of emerging Christianity of which 70% survives in the

writings of Origen as quotations in Contra Celsum (Against Celsus). What is interesting about the writings of Celsus is not that he opposed the idea of an historical Jesus but that he strongly reacted to a belief in an historical Jesus being divine. Celsus, it seems, believed there was an historical Jesus, however, this person was not the divine Son of God.
Indeed it is preposterous that the works of a craftsmen [often the worst sort of person] should be considered a god.59
Celsus wrote that Jesus' father was a Roman soldier named Pandira (transliterated as Pantera). This is consistent with the Talmud reference to Yeshu ben ‘son of’ Pandira which was shown to refer to a whole other Yeshu, not the Christian Yeshu. The views of Celsus drew responses from Origen who considered it a fabricated story. Raymond Brown states that the story of Pandira is a fanciful explanation of the birth of Jesus which includes very little historical evidence.60 Consequently, we are confronted with an ancient claim for the historical existence of Jesus that is unreliable. Given the paucity of evidence, there could be levelled the argument that the teachings of Jesus were so unique and unfamiliar to anything previously heard that this might strengthen a case for an historical Jesus, the source of that teaching.
The Message of Jesus
Jesus message of love is recognised by many as quite revolutionary in 1st century Palestine; however, upon closer analysis it is apparent that the ethic of love was central to many of the Mystery cults. St Paul in Romans 12: 10 states: “Love one another with brotherly affection. Outdo one another in showing honour.” However, this Christian sentiment of fraternal love was well and truly alive six centuries prior to Paul in the various Mystery Religions peppering the ancient Mediterranean world. Initiates at Eleusis were called adelphoi (brother) while the followers of Mithras were called brothers also. The disciples of the Mysteries of Jupiter Dolichenus were referred to as fratres carissimi or “most loving brothers.”61
If one had to single out one paramount feature that distinguished all the Mystery cults from other religions of their period, it would be that they sought a personal relationship with their gods. Consequently, the attitude of their devotees to the gods was one of love rather than fear or indifferent manipulation.62
Some might then argue that Jesus extended the ethic of love not just to those within the ingroup, so to speak, but to all humanity. For example, a saying that arguably most defines Jesus is Luke 6: 31: “Do to others as you would have them do to you.” However, this saying was not a new one either. Among the followers of the pagan philosopher Sextus we discover a similar saying: “Such as you wish your neighbour to be to you, such also be to your neighbour.”63 It might then be said that Jesus went even further than this and instructed his disciples to “Love [their] enemies” (Matthew 5: 43-48). This teaching attributed to Jesus was deemed quite revolutionary and identified as a radical shift from the teachings of the Jewish law of “an eye for an eye” (Exodus 21: 24). Nevertheless, these sayings appear to have had an earlier provenance than Jesus. Quoting Sextus once again, we find the following: “Wish that you may be able to benefit your enemies.”64

Complementing the sayings of Sextus, these same sentiments had been expressed by Plato 500 years earlier. In one of Plato’s dialogues Socrates leads Critto to exactly the same profound understanding.
Soc. Again, Crito, may we do evil?
Cr. Surely not, Socrates.
Soc. And what of doing evil in return for evil, which is the morality of the many-is that just or not?
Cr. Not just.
Soc. For doing evil to another is the same as injuring him?
Cr. Very true.
Soc. Then we ought not to retaliate or render evil for evil to anyone, whatever evil we may have suffered from him...65
It could successfully be argued that the ‘unique’ teachings of Jesus were ancient, having their origin, not in a Palestinian Messiah figure of the 1st century, but in a long history of Greek philosophical thought stretching back centuries before. Consequently, one is no nearer to producing evidence that could conclusively persuade regarding the existence of an historical Jesus.
CONCLUSION
When one closely examines the available evidence gleaned from a variety of ancient sources and manuscripts, it appears incontrovertible that one cannot make a strong case for the existence of an historical Jesus. At best, it can be postulated there was a strong Christian cult that claimed the existence of a man called Jesus and this claim helped forge a whole new religious tradition in the ancient world. This religious tradition borrowed from Greek philosophical thought and from many of the Mystery cults, certain ideas and motifs and used these to help formulate its own unique mythology.
Some scholars would suggest that while there may be uncertainty around the evidence, this does not discount the strong possibility that Jesus was a real historical figure. Others would argue that the Jesus we encounter in the Gospels did not literally exist but is a composite character of various figures, some real and some mythological. Yet others might contend that Jesus is purely a mythological figure modelled on various deities and demigods prevalent in the Mediterranean of ancient times.
It is not the purpose of this study to definitively prove one position over the other. Nonetheless, it is the purpose of this study to consider the various possibilities and to allow the evidence to speak for itself. Ultimately, it becomes a decision that requires faith as the evidence does not persuade one to adopt absolutely any single position. The available evidence affords only relative levels of certainty by which one is left to adopt the position that most makes sense to

them. Whether one is defending the Jesus of History or the Christ of faith both require an act of personal faith in order to be judged real.
