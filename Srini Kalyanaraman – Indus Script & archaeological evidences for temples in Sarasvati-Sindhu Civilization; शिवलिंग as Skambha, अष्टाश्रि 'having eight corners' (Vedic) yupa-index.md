Indus Script & archaeological evidences for temples in
Sarasvati-Sindhu Civilization; शिवश िंग as Skambha,
अष्टाशि 'having eight corners' (Vedic) yupa
The शिवश िंग discovered in MySon, Vietnam reported on May 27 by Dr. S. Jaishanker, Hon'ble Minister MEA is unique since the linga presents a Skambha, yupa on the Rudra Bhaga in lieu of a mukha 'face'. This Yupa is a ketu, a proclamation of the performance of a Soma yajna.
This Yupa is archaeologically evidenced and dated to Sarasvati-Sindhu civilization, thanks to archaeological evidence of अष्टाशि 'having eight corners' (Vedic) yupa discoverred from the site of Binjor, Anupgarh, on the banks of River Sarasvati. At Anupgarh, the LANDSAT image shows the palaeo-channel of River Sarasvati forking into two streams, one stream flows southwards towards Jaisalmer and another flows westwards towards Ganweriwala, Cholistan which is 7 kms. from the site of Anupgarh across the Indo-Pakistan border.

The Skambha is described in Veda texts as a fiery pillar of light and flame. The uniqueness of the eight-angled yupa is explained together with चषा ः caṣāla top ring on Yupa, made of wheat straw, to infuse carbon element into molten iron metal in the fire-altar, to produce steel.
Such a yupa, शिवश िंग is venerated from the days of Sarasvati-Sindhu Civilization. That the
presence of शिवश िंग signifies a temple is explained by the following Indus Script hieroglyphs, Sign 242 and Sign 243:
kole.l 'temple' rebus: kole.l 'smithy, forge'
kole.l 'temple'rebus: kole.l 'smithy, forge' PLUS baṭa 'rimless pot' rebus: baṭa 'iron'; bhaṭa 'furnace'. Thus Sign 243 signifies a smithy, forge with a furnace. The word for a temple is kole.l. The word for a smithy, forge is also kole.l. Thus, kole.l 'smithy, forge' is a kole.l 'temple'. And this temple, this smithy, forge is embellished with a furnace.
This temple is at a home or workplace level. For the settlement of people as a whole,there is also a larger structure called the ziggurat which is archaeologically evidenced by what is called 'stupa' or 'dagoba, dhatugarbha' in Mohenjo-daro. This ziggurat is an accumulated mound of earth and stone rising upto the hesvens. Thus womb of elements, mineral ores is called dhatugarbha and venerated as a representation of a cosmic phenomenon to link up the earth and heaven. The Mohenjo-daro ziggurat temple compares with Ur ziggurat.

Relief with Ekamukha linga. Mathura. 1st cent. CE shows a gaNa, dwarf with tuft of hair in front, a unique tradition followed by Dikshitar in Chidambaram. The gaNa is next to the smelter identified by the ekamukha sivalinga. mũ h 'face' (Hindi) rebus: mũ he 'ingot' (Santali) mũh ã̄ = the quantity of iron produced at one time in a native smelting furnace of the Kolhes; iron produced by the Kolhes and formed like a four-cornered piece a little pointed at
each end; mūhā mẽṛhẽt = iron smelted by the Kolhes and formed into an equilateral lump a little pointed at each of four ends;kolhe tehen mẽṛhẽt ko mūhā akata = the Kolhes have to-day produced pig iron (Santali). kharva is a dwarf; kharva is a nidhi of Kubera. karba'iron' (Tulu)
shrI-sUktam of Rigveda explains the purport of the yaSTi to signify a baton of divine authority:
ArdrAm yaHkariNIm yaShTim suvarNAm padmamAlinIm |
sUryAm hiraNmayIm lakSmIm jAtavedo ma Avaha || 14
Trans. Oh, Ritual-fire, I pray you to invite shrI-devi to me, an alter-ego of everyone, who makes the environ holy let alone worship-environ, wielder of a baton symbolizing divine authority, brilliant in her hue, adorned with golden garlands, motivator of everybody to their respective duties like dawning sun, and who is manifestly self-resplendent in her mien.
http://sanskritdocuments.org/sites/giirvaani/giirvaani/ss/ss.htm
A remarkable discovery is the octoganal brick which is a yaṣṭi.in a fire-altar of Bijnor site on the banks of Vedic River Sarasvati. Thi yaṣṭi attests to the continuum of the Vedic tradition of firealtars venerating the yaṣṭi as a baton, skambha of divine authority which transforms mere stone and earth into metal ingots, a manifestation of the cosmic dance enacted in the furnace/smelter of a smith. Bhuteswar sculptural friezes provide evidence to reinforce this divine dispensation by describing the nature of the smelting process displaying a tree to signify kuTi rebus: kuThi 'smelter' with kharva 'dwarf' adorning the structure with a garland to signify kharva 'a nidhi or wealth' of Kubera.
Why is a Skambha venerated? Atharva Veda explains in Skambha Suktam. शिवश िंग have been found in Harappa, dated to ca. 2500 BCE. cf. MS Vats Archaeological report.

Atharva Veda Skambha Sukta predates archaeology of Sarasvati Sindhu civilization. The civilization dates from ca. 8th millennium BCE (pace BR Mani's article) https://friendsofasi.wordpress.com/writings/the-8th-millennium-bc-in-the-lost-rivervalley/ There is no mention of linga in Rigveda. S'is'nadeva is wrongly interpreted as phallus worshipper. Yaska's and Sayana's seems to be the correct interpretation. Gopinatha Rao and RS Bisht ar in error when they deduce phallus-worship. What is worshipped is the temple which is the smithy-forge-- kole.l This is consistent with the decipherment of the entire Indus Script Corpora ascatalogus catalogorum of metalwork. and the veneration of skambha as sivalinga in Bhuteswar and Mathura and in Amaravati
http://bharatkalyan97.blogspot.in/2015/09/indus-script-cipher-and.html
“The Dhruvaberas in all Siva temples is the Linga surmounted upon the Yoni or the piNDikA (pedestal)...Int he praise of Skambha, we meet with the following passages, namely, 'Where Skambha, generating brought PurANapurusha into existence' and 'Skambha in the beginning shed forth that gold (hiraNya, out of which HiraNyagarbha arose) in the midst of the world' and lastly 'He who knows the golden reed standing in the waters is the mysterious PrajApati.' From the first two of the three passages quoted above, we see that one of the functions of Skambha is to beget HiraNyagarbha, or PurANapurusha, the god of reproduction. He pours forth his golden seed in begetting PrajApati. The original of the third passage runs thus: Yo vetasam hiraNyayam tishThantam salile veda sa vai guhyah PrajApatih.”(pp.56-57)
“...a brief account contributed by Mr. RD Banerji to the Annual of the Director General of
Archaeology for 1909-1910. About the linga of Bhita Mr. Banerji writes, 'The top of it is shaped as the bust of a male holding a vase in his left hand, while the right is raised in the abhaya mudrA posture. Below this bust, where the waist of the figure should have been, are four human heads, one at each corner. From the mode of dressing the hair and the large rings worn in the lobes of the ears, it appears that these are the busts of females. They are more or less defaced, but still retain sufficient detail to admit of identification. The upper part of the hed of the male is broken, only the portion below the nose being extant. The male figure wears a loth which is thrown over the left shoulder, the folds being shown by a double line running over the breast. The vase held in the left hand resembles to some extent, the ointment vessel found in the figures of Bodhisatvas of the Gandhara school. The left ear of the male figure bears the circular pendants, which may be earrings. In front, immediately below the heads of two females, the phallus is marked by deeply drawn lines. To the upper left of this is the inscription...The lower part of the tsone is shaped as a tenon to be fitted in a mortice. The inscription is in a good state of preservation, and with the exception of the last three letters, can be deciphered very easily.' The translation of the inscription is given by Mr. Banerji as follows: 'The lings of the sons of Khajahuti, was dedicated by Nagasiri, the son of VaseThi. May the deity be pleased.' (The text of this inscription reads as follows: Khajahuti putanam l[im]go patiThApito vAseThi-putena NagasirinA piyayta[m] d[e]vatA.). From the description given by Mr. Banerji it is evident that it is a Mukhalinga having five faces corresponding to the Is'Ana, Tatpurusha, Aghora, Vamadeva and Sadyojata aspects of Siva. In the description of Mukhalingas given...the face representing Is'Ana should be on the top, while the other four should face the east, south, west and north respectively. The four faces of the



12
four cornes which Mr. Banerji believes may be of females are really those of male figures...With the help of the (inscription) characters, Mr. RD Banerji has correctly guessed the age of the Linga to be the first century BCE. The second most ancient Linga is the one discovered by me (T Gopinatha Rao) at Gudimallam.”(pp.63-65)

Ekamukhalinga from Vat Sak Sampou
“The JaiyA ekamukhalinga is divided into three parts in accordance with the prescriptions in the Siva Agamas. The base, BrahmabhAga, is cubic in form and is 47.8 cms. High. The middle section, the ViSNubhAga, is octagonal in shape and is approximately 43 cm. High. The topmost section, the RudrabhAga, is cylindrical and is approximately 51 cms high, while the superimposed face measures 29.5 cms from the bottom of the chin to the top of the jaTA. The two lower sections of the linga would not normally be visible, since they would be enclosed in the pedestal (pIThikA)...One of the singular features of these pre-Angkorian mukhalingas is the fusing of the jaTA with the filet on the gland of the RudrabhAga (fig.2)...There is, however, an ekamukhalinga from Vat Sak Sampou (fig. 3) which displays a coiffure which is very muh like that worn on the JaiyA linga.” (O'Connor, SJ, 1961, An ekamukhalinga from Peninsular Siam, The Journal of the Siam Society. The Siam Society. pp. 43-49).

Octagonal form of ViSNubhAga and the occurrence of pancamukhalinga is consistent with the tradition of pancaloha 'five dhAtu or five mineral alloy' images as utsavaberas.
I suggest that the mukha on the linga is read rebus from the hieroglyph:
mũh 'a face' Rebus: mũh,muhã 'ingot' or muhã 'quantity of metal produced at one time in a native smelting furnace.' This reaffirms the association of the octagonal brick of Binjor fire-altar with the Skambha as linga or vajra which participates in the process of smelting dhAtu, 'ores'.

I submit that there is abundant archaeological attestation of Veda tradition in many archaeological sites of Greater India. One site of Binjor (near Anupgarh) has yielded stunning evidence of a Yupa and an associated inscription on an Indus Script Seal which documents a metalwork catalogue.
The earliest evidence of Veda archaeology (ca. 2500 BCE) comes from Binjor (near Anupgarh) --where an aṣṭāśri octoganal pillar was found in situ, on the banks of River Sarasvati.
Shapes of Yupa: A. Commemorative stone yupa, Isapur – from Vogel, 1910-11, plate 23; drawing based on Vedic texts – from Madeleine Biardeau, 1988, 108, fig. 1; cf. 1989, fig. 2); C. Miniature wooden yupa and caSAla from Vaidika Samsodana Mandala Museum of Vedic sacrificial utensils – from Dharmadhikari 1989, 70) (After Fig. 5 in Alf Hiltebeitel, 1988, The Cult of Draupadi, Vol. 2, Univ. of Chicago Press, p.22).
Almost all yupa inscriptions, all are aṣṭāśri octoganal pillars (19 including 5 of Mulavarman in Borneo) refer to performance of a Soma Samsthā yajña. One Mulavarman inscription cites from Rāmāyaṇa the expression bahusuvarṇaka..,.There is also archaeological evidence of śyena citi from Purola, Uttarakhand. Most emphatic veda continuum.
See: Binjor Indus Script Seal & Mulavarman yupa inscription, relate to yajna for बहुसवणर्क , bahusuvarṇaka, 'to possess many gold
pieces' Mirror: http://tinyurl.com/z2q2rk6 http://bharatkalyan97.blogspot.com/2015/12/binjorindus-script-seal-mulavarman.html
बहुसुवणर्क , bahusuvarṇaka, is a metaphor for the creation of wealth using fire, fire-altars as furnaces/smelters and yupa as invocations to Cosmic pillar to the Cosmic Dancer, the Paramatman to transmute mere earth and stones into metal, a form of wealth. The entire Vedic corpus is in nuce (nutshell) in the processing of Soma, which is NOT a herbal but a mineral. A synonym for Soma is ams'u with the cognate ancu 'iron' (Tocharian).
The key expressions on the Mulavarman Yupa inscription (D.175) are in Samskritam and one fragment reads: yaṣṭvā bahusuvarṇakam; tasya yajñasya yūpo ‘yam. This means "from yaṣṭi to possess many gold pieces; this Yupa is a commemoration of that yajna." The interpretation is comparable to the Indus Script seal found in Binjor in the context of a fire-altar with an



21
octagonal brick, yaṣṭi. The seal can be seen as an inscription detailing metalwork catalogue of the bahusuvarṇnakam 'to possess many gold pieces' that was produced by the smelter/furnace operations using the fire-altar.
Prof. Kern identified the expression with bahuhiraNya, a particular Soma yajna. Balakanda of Ramayana has this citation: nityam pramuditAh sarve yatha kRitayuge tathA as'vamedha s'atair ishTvA tathA bahusuvarNakaih (Balakanda I,95) The referene is to the as'vamedha sattra desirous of possessing many pieces of gold. In reference to Meghanada's yajna, the reference reads:
agniSTomo 's'vamedha ca yajno bahusuvarNakah
rAjasUyas tathA yajno gomedho vaishNavas tathA mahes'vare
(UttrakANDa, XXV, 87-9) A rajasuya yajna with prayers to mahesvara is also linked to many pieces of gold.
Another translation: "Thereupon that foremost of twice born ones Usanas of austere penances, wishing the prosperity of the sacrifice, said to Ravana the Rakshasa chief "Hear,I shall relate to thee everything, O king ;thy son hath met with the fruits of many a sacrifice Agnistoma, Asvamedha,
Bahusuvarnaka." (vrm 7.30)
(B.Ch. Chhabra, Yupa Inscriptions, in: Jean Ph. Vogel, 1947,India antiqua, Brill Archive, p.82).
Generosity associated with the performance of yajna is referenced in a yupa inscription. “Let the foremost amongst the priests and whatsoever pious men (there be) hear of the generous deed of Mulavarman, let them hear of his great gift, his gift of cattle, his gift of a kalpavRkSam, his gift of land'.”
Thus, Yupa inscriptions of Mulavarma are delineation of an economic institution. Vogel also notes: “Both the scholarship and the workmanship of our yupa inscriptions bear testimony of a considerable degree of Hindu culture in Eastern Borneo during the period to which they
belong.” Mulavarman's grandfather KuNDungga had the cooperation of Hindu priests 'who had come here from different parts' (Vogel, 1918, pp. 167-232).
The names of yajnas are clearly related to the 'fruits of the yajna' which is to yield बहुसवणर्क , bahusuvarṇaka, 'many pieces of gold'. That this is recognized as a Soma yajna reaffirms Soma not as a herbal but a mineral smelted, furnaced through fire-altars, yajñakuṇḍa.

Indus Script Cipher and Jyotirlinga,aniconic Skambha, fiery pillar of light Mirror: http://tinyurl.com/pgorkyo
Some scholars have advanced erroneous arguments suggesting non-Aryan phallus worship to explain the traditions of linga worship. Such arguments run counter to the references to jyotirlinga temples for worship of Sivalinga as fiery pillar of light as detailed in the Atharva Veda Skambha Sukta. Archaeological evidence, iconograhic evidence from scores of temples and evidence from Indus Script cipher to decipher the Candi Suku Sivalinga are presented to counter such fallacious arguments.
The chronology of Hindu tradition from the days of Atharva Veda is that iconic form of Mahesvara Siva emerges out of the aniconic Skambha (linga) or pillar of light and fire. What we find in the seven Sivalingas of Harappa is the aniconic form. Sivalinga appeared as a flame. Brahma, as hamsa, searches for the end in the heavens. Vishnu, as Varaha, searches for the beginning in the bowels of the earth. This Lingodbhava narrative is in many Puranas.
Appar, Shaiva saint of the 7th century, provides a similar narrative for this Lingodbhava. Tirugnana Sambandar refers to Brahma and Vishnu who set out on a search and comprehend Siva as the nature of light.
I submit that the most abiding form of worship is that which is displayed architecurally in Amaravati where Naga venerate the Skambha, the fiery pillar of light with the adornment of Srivatsa as the capital. The Srivatsa is a Indus Script hieroglyph of a pair of fish-tails: dula 'pair' Rebus: dul 'cast metal' Kur. xolā tail. Malt. qoli id. (DEDR 2135) The hooded snake which adorns as headgear is also read rebus: kula 'hooded snake' M. khoḷ f. ʻ hooded cloak ʼ(CDIAL 3942) A. kulā ʻ winnowing fan, hood of a snake ʼ(CDIAL 3350) Rebus: kol 'working in iron' kolle 'blacksmith' kolhe 'smelters'.

The iconographic signifiers of linga are consistent with the early semantics of linga which relate to: श ङ्ग [p= 901,3] n. (once m. in Nr2isUp.; ifc. f(आ)., f(ई).
only in शवष्ण -श ङ्ग ; prob. fr. √ ग् ; cf. क्ष , क्षर् ) a mark , spot , sign , token , badge ,
emblem , characteristic (ifc. = त ्-श ङ्ग , " having anything for a mark or sign ") Up. MBh. &c. Linga as meaning 'organ of generation' occurs in Mn. Hariv. Pur. &c. The context of Atharva Veda Skambha Sukta is NOT in reference to linga but as a pillar of light, jyotis or a क्षर् of light or fire. The linga as an Indus Script hieroglyph has been explained in the context of Candi Suku iconography of four balls at the tip of a 6 ft. tall linga as a cipher for lokhāṇḍā, 'metal tools, pots and pans of copper'.
http://bharatkalyan97.blogspot.in/2015/09/bronze-age-lokhnda-metal-tools-pots.html Some scholars cite RV 7.21.5 and RV 10.99.3 references to s'is'nadeva as a reference to 'phallus worshippers'. This view is in error and will be explained based on Sayana's translations of the Rigvedic rica-s.



24
RV 7.021.05 Let not th ra_ks.asas, Indra, do us harm; let not the evil spirits do harm to our progeny, most powerful (Indra); let the sovereign lord, (Indra), exert himself (in the restraint) of disorderly beings, so that the unchaste may not disturb our rite. [Let not the ra_ks.asas: na vandana vedyabhih = vandana_ni, ra_ks.a_m.si, prajabhyah; the unchaste: s'is'nadevah, abrahmacharya ityarthah (Yaska 4.19)].
RV 10.099.03 Going to the battle, marching with easy gait, desiring the spoil, he set himself to the acquisition of all (wealth). Invincible, destroying the licentious, he won by his prowess whatever wealth (was concealed in the city) with the hundred gates. [s'is'nadeva_n is a tatpurus.a compound; hence, the meaning would perhaps be: incontinent or licentious].
Gopinatha Rao erroneously interprets s'is'na as non-aryans, phallus-worshippers "The worship of the Phallus which the non-Aryans of India shared with other nations who inhabited on the borders of the Mediterranean sea, has survived in India to this day. The Dhruvaberas in all Siva temples is the Linga surmounted upon the Yoni or the piNDika (pedestal). It is only in very rare instances we meet with the anthropomorphic representations of Siva set up as the principal deity in Siva temples. This non-Aryan phallic emblem seems to have been identified at a later period with Skambha of the Vedas, wherein Skambha is conceived as co-extensive with the universe and comprehends in him the various parts of the material universe, as also the abstract qualities, such as tapas, faith, truth and divisions of time. He is distinct from Prajapati, who founds the universe upon him...The gods who form part of him do homage to him."(pp.55-56 opcit.) This interpretation is based on the meaning given to s'is'na: शिश्न [p=
1076,3] m. n. (cf. शििन् ; said to be fr. √ श्नथ् , " to pierce ") a tail , (esp.) the male generative organRV. &c.
Gopinatha Rao has erred because, following Yaska, Sayana interprets s'is'nadeva of both these ricas as unchaste men. Durgacharya also applies the word to those who dally carnally with prostitutes, forsaking Vedic observances. The veneration of Skambha an aniconic form of Mahesvara is NOT related to Skambha as a शिश्न but the jyotirlinga, the pillar of fire and light as the primordial explanation for the phenomena of the Universe like an axis Mundi linking earth and heaven.
'Skambha in the beginning shed forth that gold (hiraNya, out of which HiraNyagarbha arose) in the midst of the world.' This passage in the Skambha Sukta of Atharva Veda DOES NOT 'pour forth his golden seen in begetting Prajapati' as interpreted wrongly by Gopinatha Rao but explains the term HiraNyagarbha in relation to Skambha. The word vetasa used in the Sukta refers to a reed and NOT to a membrum virile, vetasa does NOT refer to an identity of the Linga, as wrongly interpreted by Gopinatha Rao who further adds: "At a later time a sort of philosophical clothing is given to the primitive Linga: by a section of scholars the LInga and its pedestal are viewed, with some justification, as the representation of the araNis, the two pieces of wood which were rubbed together by the Vedic Indian in making fire." I submit that this view of Gopinatha Rao is speculative with no basis in philology or tradition. Skambha is a pillar of light and fire and hence, the appellation Jyotirlinga given to the 12 holy sites of Siva temples in ancient India.

Why do Hindus Worship Shiva Linga? Kanchi Paramacharya’s Talk

Compiled by London Swaminathan Post No. 870 dated 26th February 2014
“ God is Omnipresent and All-pervasive. By the very nature of these qualities, He cannot have any form. He is, therefore, formless (Arupa). But in order to bless us, He assumes innumerable forms (Rupa). The Linga form in which we worship Isvara is symbolic of both His formlessness and form. It is symbolic of form because it has a particular shape; It is symbolic of formlessness because it has neither head nor limbs. The very conception of a Linga denotes something which has neither beginning nor end; the literal meaning of Linga is symbol. Banalinga, part of Panchayatana Puja, is egg shaped. It serves to remind us Isvara(God) has neither beginning nor end. The shape of the sky is another example. Looking at the horizon we feel that the sky and the earth meet at a particular point. We may circle the earth and return to the point from which we started, without coming to the point where the sky and the earth meet. If we go into the significance of the symbol of Linga, we will realise that it is intended to bring the Unknown within our mental comprehension.
Lingodbhava Moorthi Isvara assumes various forms in pursuance of His Divine Leela. The prime manifestation with a form of the formless Isvara, is known as the Lingodbhava Moorthi, and He made his appearance in that form exactly at midnight on Sivaratri. That is why all devotees keep vigil during the night of Sivaratri, and worship Isvara at midnight. If we go to any important Siva temple, we will find a niche, in the outer wall of the sanctum sanctorum, exactly behind the spot where the deity is installed. In that niche we can find a representation of the Lingodbhava Moorthi—a form emerging out of a linga. We can see neither the top half of the head nor the bottom half of the legs of that form. All the other attributes of Siva, like the axe, the deer etc.



45
will be found sculptured. We will find also depicted a swan in flight at the top of the linga, and a boar burrowing the earth at the bottom. According to tradition, Brahma took the form of a swan to find the crown of Siva’s head and failed. Similarly Vishnu took the form of a varaha/ boar and burrowed deep into the bowels of the earth to locate the feet of Siva and failed. Thus in Lingodbhava Moorthi, we find the unique combination of Brahma, Vishnu and Siva, impressing in our minds the Advaitic tatva that God is One, Full and All Pervasive. Both the Arupa and Rupa aspects of Isvara are thus depicted. (Significance of Sivaratri, Talk delivered by Kanchi Shankaracharya Sri Chandra Sekarendra Sarasvati on 16th February 1958 in Madras.)

Hindu Gods in Japan Interview between Paramacharya and Hajme Nakamura, Professor of Philosophy, University of Tokyo His Holiness: Is Shiva Linga found anywhere in Japan Professor Hajme Nakamura: No. there is neither Shiva Linga nor images of Vishnu. But there is Ganapathi, Saraswathi, Indra, Brahma and even Varuna. But also there is a crocodile, which is regarded as the vehicle (Vahana) of the Ganges. The meaning of the Japanese names of Ganapathi = Arya deva Saraswathi = Goddess of eloquence Indra = Chakra deva Varuna = God of water

“We Hindus regard both Siva and Vishnu as the same and this is evident from the fact that in the ecstasy of our devotion, when we are alone or in groups, we exclaim Haro-Hara and Govinda Govinda which names come to our lips spontaneously. The holy days of Sivaratri and Janmashtami, are divided from each other by exactly 180 days, and this seems to indicate that god in his aspect as Siva protects us during one half of the year and his aspect as Vishnu , in the other half. The traditional practice of boys and girls collecting oil for their vigil on Sivaratri and Janmashtami nights , singing in chorus a song which means Sivaratri and Sri Jayanthi/Janmashtami are the same, is another pointer to the identity of these two manifestations of the divine.” (Paramacharya has pointed out in another talk that only two stars out of 27 stars has the honorific prefix “Thiru=Sri” in Tamil. They are Arudra and Onam. Both of them are associated with Shiva and Vishnu respectively. Big celebrations are held in Siva and Vishnu temples on those days.

From Binjor (4MSR) on the banks of Vedic River Sarasvati, a yajña kuNDa with an अष्टाशि 'having eight corners' (Vedic) yupa (brick pillar) was discovered in April 2015 by a young team of students from Institute of Arcaheology, National Museum, New Delhi led by Dr. Sanjay Manjul.

The yupa is a conclusive evidence of Veda culture in the Binjor (4MSR) site on the banks of Vedic River Sarasvati. This is specially described in Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa & Rigveda. The key expressions on the Mulavarman Yupa inscription (D.175) are in Samskritam and one fragment reads: yaṣṭvā bahusuvarṇakam; tasya yajñasya yūpo ‘yam. This means "from yaṣṭi to possess many gold pieces; this Yupa is a commemoration of that yajna." In exposition by Sadhashiv A Dange: “the yūpa is described as being the emblem of the sacrifice (RV III.8.8 yajñasya ketu). Though it is fixed on the terrestrial plane at the sacrifice, it is expected to reach the path of the gods. Thus, about the many sacrificial poles (fixed in the Paśubandha, or at the Horse-sacrifice) it is said that they actually provide the path for reaching the gods (ib., 9 devānām api yanti pāthah). They are invoked to carry the oferings to the gods (ib., 7 te no vyantu vāryam devatrā), which is the prerogative of the fire-god who is acclaiemd as ‘messenger’ (dūta); cf. RV I.12.1 agrim dūtam vṛṇimahe). In what way is the yūpa expected to carry the chosen offering to the gods? It is when the victim is tied to the sacrificial pole. The prallelism between the sacrificial fire and the yūpa is clear. The fire carries it through the smoke and flames; the yūpa is believed to carry it before that, when the victim is tied to it, as its upper end is believed to touch heaven. A more vivid picture obtains at the yajapeya. Here the yūpa is eight-angled, corresponding to the eight qurters. (śat. Br. V.2.1.5 aṣṭāśrir yūpo bhavati; the reason given is that the metre Gayatri has eight letters in one foot; not applicable here, as it is just hackneyed. At Taitt.Sam. I.7.9.1, in this context a four-angled yūpa is prescribed.) The one yūpa is conceived as touching three worlds: Heaven, Earth and the nether subterranean. The portion that is above the caṣāla (ring) made of wheat-dough (cf.śat. Br. V.2.1.6 gaudhūmam caṣālam bhavati) represents Heaven. This is clear from the rite of ascending to the caṣāla, made of wheat-dough, in the Vajapeya sacrifice. The sarificer ascends to it with the help of a ladder (niśrayaṇī); and, while doing so, calls upon his wife, ‘Wife, come; let us ascend to Heaven’. As soon as he ascends and touches the caṣāla, he utters, ‘We have reached Heavven, O gods’ (ib., 12). According to Sāyaṇa on the Taiit.Sam. I.7.9.1, the sacrificer stretches his hands upwards when he reaches the caṣāla and says, ‘We have reached the gods that stay in heaven’ (udgṛhītābhyām bāhubhyām). Even out of the context of the Vajapeya, when the yūpa is erected (say in the Paśubandha), it is addressed, ‘For the earth you, for the mid-region you, for heaven you (do we hoist you)’ (Taitt. Sam. I.3.6.1-3; cf. śat. Br. III.7.1.5-6). The chiselled portion of the yūpa is above the earth. So, from the earth to heaven, through the mid-region the yūpa represents the three-regions. The un-chiselled portion of the yūpa is fixed in the pit (avaṭa) and the avaṭa, which represents the subterranean regions, is the region of the ancestors (ib.4).The yūpa, thus, is the axis mundi...Then, it gave rise to various myths, one of them being that of the stūpa of Varuṇa, developing further into Aśvattha tree, which is nothing but a symbol of a tree standing with roots in the sun conceived as the horse (aśva-stha = aśvattha), a symbol obtaining at varius places in the Hindu tradition. It further developed into the myth of the churning staff of the mountain (Amṛta-manthana); and yet further, into the myth of Vasu Uparicara, whom Indra is said to have given his yaṣṭi (Mb.Adi. 6y3.12-19). This myth of the yaṣṭi was perpetuated in the ritual of the Indra-dhvaja in the secular practice (Brhatsamhita, Chapter XLII), while in the s’rauta practice the original concept of the axis mundi was transformed into the yūpa that reached all regions, including the under-earth. There is another important angle to the yūpa. As the axis mundi it stands erect to the east of the Uttaravedi and indicates the upward move to heaven. This position is unique. If one takes into account the position of the Gārhapatya and the āhavaniya fireplaces, it gets clear that the march is from the earth to heaven; because, the Gārhapatya is associated with this



50
earth and it is the household fire (cf. gṛhā vai gārhapatyah, a very common saying in the ritual texts), and the seat of the sacrificer’s wife is just near it, along with the wives of the gods, conceptually. From this fire a portion is led to the east, in the quarter of the rising sun (which is in tune with such expressions as prāñcam yajñam pra nayatā sahāyah, RV X.101.2); where the Ahavaniya fireplace is structured. As the offerings for the gods are cast in the Ahavaniya, this fire is the very gate of heaven. And, here stands, the yūpa to its east taking a rise heavenwards. This is, by far, the upward rise. But, on the horizontal plane, the yūpa is posted half-inside, half-outside the altar. The reason is, that thereby it controls the sacred region and also the secular, i.e. both heaven and earth, a belief attested by the ritual texts. (Tait. Sam. VI.6.4.1; Mait. Sam. III.9.4).”(Dange, SA, 2002, Gleanings from Vedic to Puranic age, New Delhi, Aryan Books International, pp. 20-24). The Sukta RV X.101 reads, explaining the entire yajña as a metaphor of golden-tinted soma poured into a wooden bowl, a smelting process yielding weapons of war and transport and implements of daily life (Translation of RV X.101): 10.101.01 Awake, friends, being all agreed; many in number, abiding in one dwelling, kindle Agni. I invoke you, Dadhikra, Agni, and the divine Us.as, who are associated with Indra, for our protection. [In one dwelling: lit., in one nest; in one hall]. 10.101.02 Construct exhilarating (hymns), spread forth praises, construct the ship which is propelled by oars, prepare your weapons, make ready, lead forth, O friends, the herald, the adorable (Agni). 10.101.03 Harness the ploughs, fit on the yokes, now that the womb of earth is ready, sow the seed therein, and through our praise may there be abundant food; may (the grain) fall ripe towards the sickle. [Through our praise: sow the seed with praise, with a prayer of the Veda; s’rus.t.i = rice and other different kinds of food]. 10.101.04 The wise (priests) harness the ploughs, they lay the yokes apart, firmly devoted through the desire of happiness. [Happiness: sumnaya_ = to give pleasure to the gods]. 10.101.05 Set up the cattle-troughs, bind the straps to it; let us pour out (the water of) the well, which is full of water, fit to be poured out, and not easily exhausted. 10.101.06 I pour out (the water of) the well, whose cattle troughs are prepared, well fitted with straps, fit to be poured out, full of water, inexhaustible. 10.101.07 Satisfy the horses, accomplish the good work (of ploughing), equip a car laden with good fortune, pour out (the water of) the well, having wooden cattle-troughs having a stone rim, having a receptable like armour, fit for the drinking of men. 10.101.08 Construct the cow-stall, for that is the drinking place of your leaders (the gods), fabricate armour, manifold and ample; make cities of metal and impregnable; let not the ladle leak, make it strong. 10.101.09 I attract, O gods, for my protection, your adorable, divine mine, which is deserving of sacrifice and worship here; may it milk forth for us, like a large cow with milk, giving a thousand strreams, (having eaten) fodder and returned. 10.101.10 Pour out the golden-tinted Soma into the bowl of the wooden cup, fabricate it with the stone axes, gird it with ten bands, harness the beast of burden to the two poles (of the cart). 10.101.11 The beast of burden pressed with the two cart-poles, moves as if on the womb of sacrifice having two wives. Place the chariot in the wood, without digging store up the Soma. 10.101.12 Indra, you leaders, is the giver of happiness; excite the giver of happiness, stimulate him, sport with him for the acquisition of food, bring down here, O priests, Indra, the son of

Nis.t.igri_, to drink the Soma. [Nis.t.igri_ = a name of Aditi: nis.t.im ditim svasapatni_m girati_ti nis.t.igri_raditih]. Thus, what has been discovered in Binjor is in Rigveda tradition of a yupa topped by caṣāla (godhuma, wheat chaff smoke) to carburize metal in furnace, fire-altar. The yupa is RV III.8.8 yajñasya ketu, the signature tune of the prayer, the signifier. Hieroglyph for caṣāla is the snout of varāha, the Veda Purusha. caṣāla and yupa are the vajra, which yield the adamantine glue, sanghgāta which is signified by the hieroglyphs: sangaDa, 'chain, lathe-portable furnace' in Indus Script tradition of data archiving. The Binjor seal with inscription is a data archive of metalwork by the artisans of Binjor (4MSR) who are engaged in a Cosmic process of creating wealth out of mere stone and rock mediated by fire and yaj, 'prayer'.
