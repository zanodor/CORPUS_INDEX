DEAR READER,
THE TWO JUANS
Flamenco is a wonderful artistic form of mankind and UNESCO in 2010 justifiably declared it one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity. Combining singing (cante), dance (baile), guitar (toque), and handclapping and finger snapping (jaleo) it is an art form that can invoke the deepest human feelings. Born and evolved in Andalusia, it was nurtured in a traditional and organic way by people belonging to different cultures. In the 20th century it became popular all around the world, which is a positive side of globalization.
In the same time, beginning with the 1960s flamenco came under commercial pressure as practically every art form. Interestingly, mainly the artists in Spain gave in to the pressure of commercialization. Some went so far as to alter its basic tenets so much that flamenco lost all its characteristics in the artistic output of these people.
Luckily, there are always a handful of serious artists who despite all commercial pressure maintain their artistic integrity. I would like to highlight this using the example of the flamenco guitarists. Toque the flamenco guitar - was in the beginning primarily an accompanying instrument to flamenco dancers and singers. During the 19th and 20th centuries though it evolved into an almost individual art form to such an extent that for many people the flamenco guitar is par excellence the flamenco art. Though this is in reality not true, the flamenco guitar made indeed a great journey. As I said previously, unfortunately the commercial pressure takes its toll and most of the output since the 1960s is junk or such a distorted flamenco that the question arises whether it can be called flamenco at all.
However, by God ́s grace, we have two Juans, namely Juan Martín (1948) and Juan Serrano (1935). Both were born in Andalusia, where they received their flamenco guitar training starting at an early age. Then they became acknowledged performers and what is really interesting to note is that both settled abroad, outside of Spain. Juan Martín settled in London (though also spending a considerable amount of time in his native town Málaga) and Juan Serrano in Florida, where he developed a flamenco guitar program at the California State University, where he also headed the guitar department until his retirement.
Both developed a wide range of repertoire with countless live concerts and recordings. I can recommend you all of them. What is common in the artistic output of both of them is that they significantly enlarged and widened the scope of flamenco guitar without breaking its structure. This is the apex of true art!
If this were the only achievement of these two gentlemen, that would be already far above average. However, they created in another field something that is at least as valuable as their artistic output. They are both great teachers as well! They created countless books with DVDs, CDs that can be used to learn flamenco guitar. Naturally, the ideal way is to learn from a master directly (preferably in Andalusia), but for all those who cannot afford that, learning from the great material of Juan Martín and Juan Serrano is the second best option. For the sake of completeness I need to mention a third great teacher, Gerhard

Graf-Martinez, who also created excellent books with videos and other supporting material. His case only reinforces the rule: he is based in Germany – also outside Spain.
As flamenco has become available globally, I think we are more than fortunate that the great artists who took the path of teaching a global audience in flamenco guitar, are those who enriched the art itself without destroying it. Juan Martín, Juan Serrano, and Gerhard Graf-Martinez, imbued with great humility have proved that the real artist is who also shares freely his talents, knowledge, and experience. Real art does not only mean producing one CD after the other but also educating the next generation of professional and amateur musicians, because it is community building. It is in their interest and in the interest of all of us.
Personally, as I took up flamenco guitar on my own this year, I am very thankful to these gentlemen. Despite living remotely from them I can attest that I have the greatest flamenco teachers in the world!

Traces of Buddhist Architecture in Gupta and post-Gupta Bengal:
Evidence from Inscriptions and Literature
Abstract: This paper discusses the development of Buddhism in Bengal during the Gupta period and their traces in architecture found during the Gupta and post-Gupta periods by considering references made in inscriptions and literature from the period To do so, religious history of the pre-Gupta, Gupta and post-Gupta periods have been reviewed in the light of the development of Buddhism in Bengal and the related regions. Most probably Bengal came in touch with Buddhism during Buddha’s lifetime (c. 563 to 483 BCE). During the time between Buddha and Asoka (ruled 269 to 232 BCE) Buddhism became firmly rooted at the heart of this region so much so that hostile attitudes of some later dynasties could not wipe it out of Bengal. Tolerant outlook of local and regional Brahmin kings during the Guptas allowed Buddhism to flourish which was further boosted in the post-Gupta period by devout followers like the emperor, Harsavardhana, Devakhadga and his son Rajabhata. They supported Buddhist practices in the Samatata area of Bengal. Further, Deva kings enormously contributed towards Buddhist monasteries.
Keywords: architecture, inscriptions, literary studies, Buddhist architecture, Bengal
History of Bengal before the Palas is obscure and archaeological evidences from this period are so scant that academics are struggling to resolve the issues arising from different ideas of the chronology of later Gupta and post Gupta rulers. On the other hand, patronage of the Pala kings towards Buddhism is well known, for which it has become almost customary to assign any medieval Buddhist architectural contributions to the Pala kings to keep those beyond contradiction. As a result, contributions towards Buddhism by other medieval dynasties are rarely expressed or discussed. Though Gupta kings were Hindus, they had a tolerant outlook which allowed Buddhism to flourish. Such a tendency may have continued or even have gained in strength during the post Gupta period. If this was indeed the case, the extant Buddhist architecture and remnants – especially the vihāras – could contain traces of these early footsteps. However, given the state of preservation of the remains, we must look elsewhere. This paper aims to trace indications of continued patronage of the Buddhist vihāras of Bengal during Gupta and post Gupta times with reference of extant literature and inscriptions.

Map: Ancient Bengal (Reza 2012)
Bengal before the Guptas
To know about the religious state of Bengal during the Guptas, it is important to understand the conditions that existed from the ancient period. The reconstruction of the religious history of Bengal in the ancient period down to the beginning of the Imperial Guptas is again difficult due to paucity of sources. In most cases we have to depend on very scanty references in the Vedic epic and Puranic literature, where Bengal was known to be inhabited by different groups of people whose names were associated with the area they inhabited. Thus ancient Vanga, Pundra, Radha and Gauda came to be recognised as those inhabited by non-Aryan ethnic groups bearing those names. In addition the existence of Samatata and Harikela is known from later Vedic literature as areas also inhabited by nonAryan people (Chowdhury 2008).
Most probably these non-Aryan people came in touch with Buddhism during Buddha’s life (c. 563 to 483 BCE). Buddha is said to have delivered his first sermon at Saranath and then moved to different places within India including Majjhimadesha or Madhyadesha, and according to Divyavadana the

eastern boundary of the Majjhimadesha had extended as far as Pundravardhana (Chakma 2008). Hiuentsang1 confirmed that Asoka (ruled 269 to 232 BCE), the great Mauryan2 king, had erected stūpas at various places in Bengal and Orissa to commemorate these visits.
Post-Mauryan epigraphic Asokavadana3, discovery of a Mauryan inscription in Brahmi characters at Mahasthan bearing the name ‘Pudanagala’ (Pundranagara) and the recovery of Mauryan coins with other artefacts bear testimony that Buddhism had established a powerful footing in Bengal during Asoka's reign. Chinese traveller I-tsing4 is said to have noticed Asoka's stūpas in Tamralipti, Karnasuvarna, Pundravardhana and Samatata. These Chinese sources give a clear view about Asoka’s patronization of Buddhism in Bengal.
After the Maurya, with advent of the Sungas (c. 185 to 73 BCE) Buddhism lost its royal patronage. The once thriving religion went into decline because of the hostile attitude of the Sunga kings towards Buddhism and the Sangha.5 However, a terracotta tablet found at Tamralipti referred to the continued existence of Buddhism in Bengal during the Sunga period. The continued existence of Buddhism during the Sungas is plausible given the well-known situation that from Buddha to Asoka the religion became so deeply rooted within the non-Aryan population that the hostile attitude of some of the Sunga kings could not have possibly wiped it out of Bengal. Some scholars have also opined that the orthodox Sunga kings were not as intolerant towards Buddhism as many historians have made it appear. Whatever the attitude of the Sungas, the dormant persistence of Buddhism received a further impetus from the Kushanas in the first century AD when Kaniska raised Buddhism once again to the status of a state religion. Discovery of images of Buddha, and coins and inscriptions throw light on the flourishing condition of Buddhism in Bengal during his reign. Like Asoka, he is said to have erected stūpas and chaityas, built vihāras (monasteries) and sent missions abroad (Chakma 2008).

Buddhism in Bengal during Gupta and post-Gupta periods
From the Gupta period onwards we get written records in the form of epigraphic material and literature which contain specific information regarding the religious pattern of Bengal. From these sources it is known that although Gupta emperors were ‘Parama-Bhagavatas’6, devout adherents of Bhagabata Vaishnava, and they revived Brahmanism, they had a tolerant outlook towards Buddhism and that allowed Buddhism to flourish. Testament to the thriving state of Buddhism is present in different sources, including Fa Huen’s account. At the same time, the rise of Saivism and Vaisnavism7 brought Buddhism closer to Hinduism and injected a new impetus into Buddhism.
The Gupta patronization towards Buddhism can be identified from Maharaja Shri Gupta (c. 240 to 280 CE) – the first ruler of the Gupta dynasty - who built a Buddhist temple and offered it to Buddhist monks from China along with a gift of twenty-four villages, according to Chinese sources. Though the location of this temple cannot yet be identified, many scholars believe that this suggests the rise of Guptas from Bengal; according to this opinion, as well as from the calculations of Mookerji (Mookerji 2007), there is a great chance that the temple was built within Bengal territory.
Another prominent Gupta king, Samudragupta (ruled 335 to 380 CE), despite being a devout worshipper of Vishnu, had proved to be a great patron of Buddhism. His teacher and guide, the celebrated Buddhist scholar Vasubandhu, was appointed minister, and with the permission of the Ceylonese King Meghavanna, a monastery was built at Bodh-Gaya during his reign. It is likely that on the eve of the Gupta expansion under Samudragupta, Bengal remained divided into independent states. By about the middle of the fourth century CE most independent states came under Samudragupta's rule, except Samatata. His well-structured local administration gave the local representatives authority to play an important role in their development, which helped Buddhism to thrive within the tolerant atmosphere he championed. Chandra Gupta I (c. 319 to 335 CE), who like his father Sri Gupta, was a devout Vaisnava by faith, also gave full freedom to the practice of other faiths in his empire.
Chandragupta II Vikramaditya (ruled 375 to 414 CE) was Vaishnava and took the title of Paramabhagavata (sincerest devotee of Vishnu). A prominent minister of Chandragupta gifted land and a sum of money to the community of Buddhist monks called Arya-Samgha, who belonged to the great vihāra at Kakanadabota (Sanchi). One of the Udaygiri caves bear an inscription of another minster who was a devotee Shiva (Mookerji 2007).
Kumaragupta I Mahendraditya (ruled AD 414 to 455) founded the great monastery of Nalanda, which in the course of time turned into a university and became the greatest centre of Buddhist learning in Asia. Both Hsuan-tsang and the Korean traveller Prajnavarman confirmed the story of its origin (Ramaswami 1971). Though it was situated out of Bengal territory, from an early date the Buddhists of Bengal were closely linked with this great institution. Acharya Dharmapala had been the high priest of this monastery, who was succeeded by his disciple Acharya Shilabhadra, a scion of a Brahmana king of
6 ''Bhagavat'' means 'the Adorable One', and ''Bhagabata'' is 'a worshiper of the Adorable One', In traditional Hinduism ''Bhagabata'' refers 'worshiper of Krishna' where as Vaishnavas refers it as 'worshiper of Vishnu'.
7 Saivism and Vaisnavism have accepted many aspects of Buddhism, a reason why the rise of these two powerful Hindu cults brought Buddhism closer to Hinduism. In its spiritual nihilism, Buddhism approximated the Bhakti movements, so much so that, by the middle of the sixth century CE, the Buddha was accepted as an avatar of Vishnu.

Samatata. Not only scholars from Bengal but also its kings contributed to the development of the great institutions.
Though the foundation of Nalanda monastery was laid at the time of Kumaragupta I, several kings of Gupta dynasty built monasteries of their own flanking the original structure and made it the largest Mahavihāra. Hsuan-tsang mentioned four of these - Buddhagupta, Tathagatagupta, Baladitya and Vajra. According to Heras, Buddhagupta is Skanda Gupta, Tathagatagupta is Pura Gupta, Baladitya is Narasimhagupta and Vajra is Kumaragupta II (Heras 1928).
Skandagupta (ruled 455 to 467 CE) continued the policy of his father Kumaragupta I, as patronage towards Nalanda as well as Buddhism was continued. He built another sangharama8 to the south of the previous one to enlarge the university. Puragupta also followed his ancestors’ practice and built another sangharama east of the previous one. Probably his favour for Nalanda was even more than his deceased brother.
Narasimhagupta Baladitya (ruled c. 487 to 540 CE) built another sangharama to the northeast side of the one built by his father. Hiuen-tsang resembles it to the great vihāra built under the Bodhi tree (Heras 1928). Although the kings of the Gupta dynasty professed the Brahmanical faith, Narasimhagupta is said to have received training in his youth under the great Mahayanist philosopher, Vasubandhu (Dutt 2008). According to Arya-Manjusri-Mulakalpa Bala (Narasimhagupta) was a Buddhist and he decorated his kingdom with chaityas as far as the Bay of Bengal (Jayaswal 1934). When the Huna king, Mihirakula from Malwa declared his purpose to destroy the entire Buddhist priests through the region of the five Indies and to overthrow the law of Buddha, Narshimha strictly guarded the frontiers of his kingdom and refused to pay tribute which led to war. The Huna king entered the kingdom of Magadha and pursued Narasimhagupta till the Bay of Bengal (Beal 1844). In the course of this campaign Mihirakula undoubtedly marched on Pataliputra and continued till the Bay of Bengal. He destroyed all Buddhist buildings that he found in his way and killed all its priests. But Mihirakula was finally defeated by the Gupta army and Narasimhagupta did restore the university to its glory through rebuilding. After restoration was done and construction of his vihāra was finished, Narasimha commemorated the event with a great assembly where 10,000 priests flocked to Nalanda from every corner of India and even two monks came from far-off China. At his later age, Narasimha resigned the crown in favour of his son, retiring to the sangha (Heras 1928).
Kumaragupta III (ruled around 543 CE), son of Narasimha, again built a sangharama on the west side of the previous one (Beal 1844). Although there is controversy over his religion, in all likelihood he also followed his father. Gunaigarh copper plate records a gift of land by Maharaja Vainya Gupta in favour of the Buddhist Sangha of the Mahayana sect.
In the post-Gupta period, according to Hiuen-tsang, Shashanka (ruled c. 600 to 625 CE) was hostile to Buddhism, who ordered the extermination of the Buddhist monks in and around Kushinagara, cut down the holy Bodhi tree of Gaya and threw a sacred stone footprint of the Buddha into the Ganges. He is also said to have removed a Buddha image from a temple close to the Bodhi tree and replaced it with that of
8 Sangharama (सँघाराम) is a Sanskrit word means "where the sangha (Buddhist monastic community) dwells"; generally, the
term, sangharama refers to the Buddhist monastery.

Shiva (Heras 1928). Arya-Manjusri-Mulakalpa also describes him as a characterless Brahmin king and an enemy of Harsavardhana (Jayaswal 1934). In sharp contrast to Shashanka's alleged persecution of Buddhists and antagonism towards Buddhism, the flourishing condition of the Buddhist University at Nalanda during this period, the existence of a number of monasteries within Shashanka's kingdom including the Raktamrttika-Mahavihāra near Karnasuvarna (the capital city of Shashanka), provides indication of his tolerant attitude towards Buddhism (Bhattacharyya 2008).9
The reign of Emperor Harsavardhana (590 to 647 CE) was one of resurgence and renewed progress and development of Buddhism. Despite being a worshipper of Shiva and Surya, Harsa had great leanings towards Buddhism from his elder brother (Rajyavardhana) and sister Rajyashri, who were both devout Buddhists. Gradually he became a great patron of Buddhism, at first becoming a devotee of the Hinayana sect and in later life an ardent follower of the Mahayana path. As a devout Buddhist he gave Buddhism a new impetus; his somewhat anti-Brahmanical attitude despaired the followers of the Brahmanical religion, who began to migrate to eastern India in large numbers. Hiuen-tsang mentioned a large influx of learned Brahmanas into Kamarupa, who were granted land by the king, Bhaskaravarman for their settlement. The Kulaji texts also noted the influx of Kanauji Brahmanas into Bengal, possibly at the invitation of Shashanka (Bhattacharyya 2008).
Some of Harsa’s notable contributions towards Buddhism include erecting stupas on the banks of the Ganges, building monasteries at places sacred to Buddhism, and forbidding the slaying of animals. Another of his important contributions to Buddhism was his convening regularly the convocation. Harsa used to summon Buddhist monks once a year for religious discussions. He was especially attached to Nalanda and extended help liberally. Hiuen-tsang also enjoyed the patronage of Harsa during his visit to India (Chakma 2008).
The Kailan copper plate supplies a variety of interesting information regarding Rata dynasty of ancient Samatata. Shridharana Rata, the second ruler of the dynasty, issued land for charitable purposes to Buddhist organisations as well as Brahmins (Rashid 2008). The inscription also mentions that the ruling king, Shridharana Rata was Parama-Vaisnava. But his contribution towards Buddhist organization proves not only his religious tolerance, but also his actual devotion towards Buddhist development (Khan 2004).
After Harsavardhana, the Khadga dynasty is said to be the first Buddhist dynasty to rule an independent Bengal between the seventh and the eighth centuries CE. The Chinese monk Sheng-chi, who visited Samatata in the latter half of the seventh century CE, mentions Rajabhata as its king and describes him as an ardent worshipper of the three gems (triratna, i.e., the Buddha, dhamma and the sangha). During his pilgrimage visits he founded monasteries, supporting monks in the Samatata. Further, he stated that the king gave to the monks and nuns offerings for their maintenance; every morning on behalf of the king an officer was sent to the monastery to ask after the welfare of the resident monks, including Sheng-che.
9 According to Banabhatta’s Harsha Charita, Sasanka entered Magadha as a friend of Rajyavardhana, but in secret alliance with the Malwa King he murdered Rajyavardhana. Most probably on this occasion he destroyed the sacred places of Buddhism in Magadha as referred to by Hiuen tsang. Although the Arya-Manjusri-Mulakalpa describes him as an enemy of Harsavardhana, it does not mention any destruction of Buddhist shrines by him.

The copper plate of Balabhata, another son of Devakhadga, describes land grants towards the maintenance and renovation of vihāras and stupas. Two Ashrafpur copperplate inscriptions also describe land donations by both Devakhadga and his son, Rajabhata towards Buddhist development (Islam 2008). These suggest that during the reign of the Khadga kings Buddhism continued to flourish in Bengal in the seventh century CE.
However, the presence of the left facing bull and absence of the dharmachakra (the Wheel of Law) in Ashrafpur copper-plate also furnishes an indication of Shaiva leanings of the dynasty. Contributions by Devakhadga's queen, Prabhavati towards providing a cover of gold leaves for the goddess, Shavani, and Balabhatta’s title, paramashesvara (an epithet of Siva) on Deulbadi image inscription, also indicates them as worshiper of Siva. Probably, the overt Shaiva leanings of this dynasty was an act towards stabilising Khadga royal power in the newly conquered area of Samatata (Ray 2008).
As yet the four identified inscriptions of the Deva dynasty does not provide any information regarding religious inclination of Shantideva and Bhirdeva, the first and second rulers of the Deva dynasty. However, their presence in their ancestor, Anandadeva & Bhavadeva’s Salban vihāra copperplate inscription indicates their religious affiliation.
Anandadeva & Bhavadeva’s Salban vihāra copperplate refers to the former as ‘Paramasaugata’ meaning a devotee of Buddha, the first king of Bengal to assum the title. His seal attached to this copperplate bear the ‘dharmachakramudra’ (the Wheel of Law flanked by two seated bear). He was the first king of Bengal who attached such a seal to his copperplate, which was also adopted by his successor. Anandadeva is also credited with the issuing of coins titling himself as ‘Bangal-Mriganka’, and to publicise Buddhist religion and culture to the peoples of his country (Khan 2003).
Anandadeva & Bhavadeva’s Salban vihāra copperplate further refers contribution of Bhavadeva towards a Buddhist viharika. His title, ‘Avinaba-Mriganka’ indicates his religious devotion towards Buddhism. He followed his father to attach ‘dharmachakramudra’ seal to his copperplates. Ananda vihāra copperplate provides proof of his contribution towards Vendamoti Viharika. His ‘Shri-Bhavadeva Maha Vihāra arya-bhiksusangghasya’ proves continuation of Buddhist religious and cultural development during Deva dynasty.
Buddhist inscriptions, seals, images and manuscripts in Gupta characters, discovered from different archaeological excavations, testify that both Hinayana and Mahayana sects continued to flourish simultaneously during the Gupta period. The flourishing state of the early Hinayana schools, namely Sarvastivadins, Sammatiyas or Vatsiputriyas and Sthavirvadins, were present at the early period; however, Hinayana gradually lost its hold and gave way to Mahayana. Scope for devotion and worship as well as the laity of Mahayana practice began to capture the imagination of the common people and became an important religious movement. With the development of Mahayana, the worship of Bodhisattva images along with the image of the Buddha turned into a common practice (Chakma 2008).

Traces of Buddhist architecture in Gupta and post-Gupta Bengal
Chinese travellers’ accounts are a major source which provide many traces of Gupta and post-Gupta vihāras in Bengal. Fa-hien (ca. 337 – 422 CE), who visited India around 399-414 CE, described that, while some of the old Buddhist centres, like Kapilavastu and Saraswati, were in a neglected and ruinous state, Pataliputra, Mathura, Bodh-gaya, Sarnath and Nalanda were flourishing as active centres of Buddhism (Chakma 2008). Fa-hien’s account suggests that none of the sites in Bengal were flourishing as well as Nalanda did during this period to be considered an active centre of Buddhism. Fa-hien, however, is said to have travelled eastward from Pataliputra along the course of the Ganges, coming across Buddhist stupas and monks at various locations. In Tamralipti, in Bengal, he is said to have spent two years and visited twenty-two monasteries (Legge 1886) inhabited by monks who lived in accordance with the Buddhist vinaya (Ramachandran 1951).
Hiuen-tsang (ca. 602- 664 CE), visited India around 630-645 CE, visited almost all the major centres associated with Buddhism in India. At Pundravardhana he is said to have found twenty Buddhist monasteries with more than 3,000 monks who practised both Hinayana and Mahayana paths. The magnificent Po-shi-po was occupied by over 700 monks and was located in the vicinity of the capital of Pundravardhana. He describes its court as light and roomy, its towers and pavilions as very lofty. There is also mention of another vihāra with an image of Kwan-tsz’-tsai Avalokitesvara not far from this establishment, which attracted visitors from far and near (Beal 1844). In Samatata he found more than thirty Buddhist monasteries with about 2,000 priests of the Sthavira School. In the vicinity of the capital of Samatata, he describes the existence of a stupa built by king Ashok and a vihāra which contained a figure of Buddha in green Jade of eight feet height. At Tamralipti he found ten Buddhist monasteries with about 1,000 monks, while at Karnasuvarna he found more than ten Buddhist monasteries with about 2,000 priests; three of these vihāras were followers of Devadatta. In the vicinity of the capital there was a vihāra named Lo-to-wei-chi (Raktaviti). He also described its halls as light and spacious and its multi-storeyed towers as very lofty. A stupa built by king Ashok was not far from it and another vihāra was adjacent to that stupa.
I-tsing, who visit India during 673-693 CE, remained in Tamralipti for five months to learn Sanskrit and the science of word. I-tsing's account notes that as many as fifty-six Buddhist priests from China and its neighbouring areas visited India in the latter half of the seventh century CE. While at Tamralipti he met Ta-cheng-teng, another distinguished Chinese scholar, in a vihāra called Po-lo-ho. Ta-cheng-teng lived at Tamralipti for twelve years to study Sanskrit Buddhist texts (Ramachandran 1951). Another monk, Sheng-chi, who visited Samatata, mentions that there were 30 monasteries with more than 4,000 monks in Samatata alone during his pilgrimage (Chakma 2008).
Chinese sources also give us the first trace of a vihāra built by any Gupta king. Fa-hien informs that, Maharaja Sri Gupta, the first ruler of the Gupta dynasty, built a Buddhist temple near Mrigasikhavana and offered it to Buddhist monks from China along with a gift of twenty-four villages. I-tsing further reports that the aforesaid park was about 50 stages east of Nalanda down the Ganges. Counting I-tsing’s each stage as 5 or 6 miles, the aforesaid temple would have been a distance of 250 to 300 miles from Nalanda (Mookerji 2007), and probably within Bengal. This temple is believed to have remained a sacred place until the seventh century AD. Arya-Manjusri-Mulakalpa records that Narasimhagupta Baladitya

decorated his kingdom with chaityas up to the Bay of Bengal as well as he built monasteries all over his empire (Jayaswal 1934).
Inscriptions are also another source to trace vihāras of Gupta and post-Gupta periods. The Paharpur copper plate inscription from the Gupta year 159 (479 CE) records a land grant for Vatoguhali Vihāra. The plate records the purchase and grant of a piece of land by a Brahmana couple in the fifth century AD for the maintenance and the worship of Arhats under a Jaina teacher, Guhanandin and a resting place at the vihāra which was situated at Vatagohali. Probably the vihāra was a locally reputed establishment of Pundravardhana (Dasgupta 2005).
Gunaigarh copper plate records a gift of land by Maharaja Vainya Gupta in favour of the Buddhist Avaivarttika Sangha of the Mahayana sect. The Sangha, founded by the Acharya Shantideva, was housed in a monastery called, Ashrama Vihāra, dedicated to Avalokiteshvara. The inscription also refers to other Buddhist monasteries, one of which was known as Raja Vihāra, which can be literally translated as the Royal Vihāra (Chakma 2008).
The Kailan copper plate inscription of Sridharan Rata supplies information regarding land donation towards Buddhist organization in Guptinatana (in or near Mainamati) and Patalyika visayas of Samatat. That is the only sign which shows any Rata kings participation toward Buddhist vihāra.
Salban Vihāra copper plate of Balabhata, son of Devakhadga, describes him as having granted land in the area of Dhanalaksmipataka (unidentified) for maintenance and renovation of vihāras and stupas. The plate refers to a mahabhogashrama, probably suggesting an asrama where grand religious festivals were held. The vihāras were apparently eight in number and in them the Parimitamatam and Danachandrika were discussed (Islam 2008).
The Chinese monk, Sheng-Che visited Samatata during the reign of Rajabhata, son of Devakhadga; the vihāra where Sheng- Che lived was Rajavihāra. The king is said to have given to the monks and nuns, including Sheng-che, offerings for their maintenance. It has been suggested that this Rajavihāra may have been the one mentioned also in the Gunaighar Copper plate of Vainyagupta (Ray 2008). Ashrafpur copper plates of Devakhadga throws light on more vihāras. According to these, Devakhadga and his son Rajabhata both donated land to Sanghamitra in favour of four vihāras and viharikas. Probably they did not get new monasteries constructed; rather brought existing establishments within a single campus to make it a sacred landscape (Islam 2008).
The Salban vihāra copperplate of Anandadeva and Bhavadeva describes land grant towards a temple in Samatata. Although no other indications are provided to identify it as a Buddhist temple (Khan 2003), Anandadevas known devotion towards Buddhism increases the possibility of it being a Buddhist vihāra.
Three seals from Salban Vihāra refers to it as ‘Shri-Bhavadeva Maha Vihāra arya-bhiksusangghasya’ (Hossain and Dewan 2004) . Bhavadeva, the third ruler of the Deva dynasty, was also a donor of land for another viharika according to the Salban vihāra copperplate. Anandavihar copperplate refers to Bhavadeva’s contribution towards another viharika at Vendamoti.

Conclusion
This short discussion regarding the traces of Gupta and post-Gupta vihāras of Bengal through inscriptions and literature is certainly inadequate to provide a comprehensive picture. However, it leaves little doubt that there were numerous vihāras in Bengal during the centuries spanning the Gupta rule and the subsequent rulers of Bengal, both the important and less significant ones. It is important to note that, contrary to generally held views, significant contributions towards Buddhist vihāras by post-Gupta regional and local rulers shows a remarkable and continued presence of Buddhism in Bengal. In conclusion, it can be said that Bengal during the Gupta and the post-Gupta period had seen the maintenance – and even construction of many notable vihāras.

HORVÁTH, Izabella
Confucius and Laozi at a Formal Chinese Dinner Party
Perhaps more than any other people, Chinese consider giving and receiving food more important than anything else in life. I would go as far as to say they are obsessed with eating. There is a Chinese saying—and there are thousands of them: “People have three emergencies,” and the first of the emergencies, of course, is eating. I let my readers guess what the other two emergencies are
An outsider in a new culture has to be a patient observer to find answers to questions. Often even asking direct questions to gain answers will not produce explanations. At least this has been my experience living in China for over ten years as a western wife of a Chinese man. I have to confess in all honesty, that I spent a lot of time being confused and befuddled by the habits, customs and just everyday life in China. But as every ethnographer knows, asking direct questions from ‘informants’ is not the only, or the most effective way to find answers. Therefore, there was nothing for it but to sharpen my observation faculties, which was often an exhausting endeavor. I could not have acquired any of the understanding without the patience and forbearance of my husband, Du Yaxiong, specialist and National Expert of traditional Chinese folk music. For this I give him my most sincere thanks.
This paper is about delving into the deeper meaning behind one of the most common customs in China: the formal dinner party. I wish to recount it, since I am sure among the readers there will be those who have had, or will have, an opportunity to attend a formal Chinese dinner party. It behooves us westerners to gain a better understanding of Chinese culture, and learn why one seemingly simple activity is not so simple. Chinese do not correct mistakes made by westerners; they only smile politely and keep their own council. However, they notice and remember.
Brief background of Chinese eating customs
Sharing food is probably one of the most universal activities in all societies. It is a great social binder. In China, however food preparation and eating has really taken center stage in daily life. Nothing can illustrate this more eloquently than the fact that in dynastic times the most important person in the land after the emperor was the imperial chef!! According to the record by Sima Qian - who is honored in China as the father of Chinese historiography--Yi Yin, a slave and a cook, was instrumental in helping prince Tang of Shang (1766-1760 BC) overthrow the corrupt Xia emperor by engaging Tang in conversation while demonstrating him his cooking skills (Sima: Vol. 1, p. 11). We can but surmise that prince Tang was a connoisseur. When with the advice of Yi Yin, Tang became the first Shang emperor, he appointed Yin to be prime minister.

The traditional expression da shifu 大师傅 (grand master) always means cook. In other words, the greatest master, possessor of knowledge, is a person who knows how to prepare food.
Thus, from times immemorial, formal dinner parties in China have been considered to be most important and common social occasions. On the surface, there seems to be nothing special about this. However, in China not many decisions get made without first sitting around a big table with good food while engaged in lively discussions. Eating is also closely connected to economy and politics. Here I am specifically referring to the “economy’ and ‘politics,’ among those who are attending a particular dinner party. This is the occasion where new information is exchanged, old relationships rekindled, decisions made, and most importantly, new connections—or as the Chinese say-- guanxi, are established.
Probably the most prolific business in a Chinese city is the restaurant business. These range from the hole-in-the-wall small fast food dumpling-seller’s place to entire buildings dedicated to the ritual of eating. One cannot take many steps in the streets without bumping into a place that sells food. In Hangzhou and Beijing, the two cities in which I spent most of my 10 years, as well as in most of the other cities I had visited, there are buildings of three to five floors used as a single restaurant. The ground floor has the main common dining area, and the other floors have elaborate private rooms and banquet halls, each room complete with its own restroom and lounge, where private dinner parties are held. It is not rare for a restaurant hall to be the size of quarter of a football field—and this is just on the main floor.
These huge restaurants are always busy, and the dishes can be ordered in advance. In Hangzhou Lou Wai Lou (Building Beyond the Building), Shan Wai Shan (Mountain Beyond the Mountain), Waipo Jia (Grandma’s Kitchen), and (Lu Cha Canting) Green Tea Restaurant are my favorite restaurants. All are

huge, with pleasant interiors, good service, and great food, with many specialties. Hangzhou is famous not only historically, but also for its lovely West Lake1, on which there are multi-storied ‘floating restaurants’ (figs. 1 and 2). On these ‘restaurant ships’ customers can enjoy the view of the city-lights at night while leisurely floating on the waves.

Chinese people are very sociable and rarely eat alone. Consequently, restaurants have only one or two tables for two, and most tables are rather big, usually round, seating between 6-12 people (figs. 3 and 4).

The table size varies in Chinese restaurants in the west, since Chinese restaurant owners have adapted themselves to the common western customs of couples eating alone. Formal Chinese dinner parties, however, take place mostly in restaurants, often in their private rooms, and rarely at anyone’s home. Of course, some family celebrations are exceptions. Yet, because even today most homes are too small for a party of 10-12 diners, birthdays, New Year celebrations, and spring and autumn festivals are most conveniently celebrated by the extended family in a private dining room in a restaurant. Families can number anywhere between four to as many as fifty, depending on the occasion.

Confucius and Laozi at a formal dinner
Westerners have very limited knowledge about China. There are many reasons for this, not the least of which are the distance between China and most western countries, the Chinese language, and the fact that until about twenty-five years ago, the country was rather inaccessible to the rest of the world. That said, it is an understatement that Chinese society is subtle and not easy to understand for a westerner. Jacques Martin in his book, When China Rules the World points out features of Chinese society which are diametrically the opposite to those in the west. Martin probably gives one of the best descriptions of Chinese culture written by a western expert (Martin: 2012). Among other things, he clearly points out the tremendous influence that people’s attitude toward history and ancient philosophy had on Chinese society (Martin: 2012; 247-248). The book is a milestone toward westerners’ better understanding of China.
Having said the above, we can safely say that as far as China is concerned, “what you see is not what you think you saw” — as it were. Also, at this point it is a perfectly appropriate question to ask, “Just what do the two great Chinese philosophers, Confucius and Laozi, have to do with formal Chinese dinners?” Actually, the two philosophiesm— Confucianism and Daoism have permeated the entire social fabric of Chinese society and that includes the Chinese concept of food and eating etiquette. Not only is the formal dinner a social event, it is also an event that takes place according to norms and beliefs which are the basis of these two philosophies. Yet, at first glance these are not obvious, least of all to a foreigner. Only after careful observation and not a little bit of studying, can we get an inkling of what takes place at a dinner party, but most importantly -- why.
The most important function of any, but mostly of a formal dinner party is to establish and maintain guanxi, (pronounced gwen-shi), between a host and an honored guest. It is an intricate, though informal system of relationships based on the indispensible and understood principle of reciprocity. Guanxi lasts a lifetime. Confucius has this to say:
Tse Kung asked, saying, ‘is there one word which may serve as a rule of practice for all one’s life? The master said, ‘is not RECIPROCITY (caps in original text) such a word? What you do not want done to yourself, do not do to others (Analects 15.23.)

Not only is guanxi a basic value in Chinese society, but it is also conducted properly, according to Confucian teachings. Chinese today are not always conscious of the depth of influence of Confucius, save for those who are better educated, yet they all follow these customs. Chinese respect history, tried-and-true tradition, and generally subscribe to maintaining peaceful relationships. According to Confucius, proper behavior among people leads to a harmonious society (Analects 6.27). It is also the way of the Dao, the main theme of the Dao De Jing -- a small but influential book by Laozi — to live in balance and harmony with everything and everybody.

Proper behavior results in establishing good relationship with everybody we meet. This unsaid rule of behavior is the basis of guanxi. In other words, thoughtfulness and unselfishness allows one to discover and provide the need of another.
Having many friends is extremely important in Chinese society. An extended network of family, friends, and acquaintances is the insurance of reciprocal benefits, and often survival. I call this ‘doing things in committee.’ This results in making decisions in groups, most often, though not exclusively, while sharing a meal. In other words, decisions are made by first “discussing” an issue with family and those members of guanxi who may be able to help in a particular situation. In China the idea of “two heads are better than one” is truly practiced and has been expanded to “the more heads the better.” It is understood that the guanxi will try hard to find a solution to a person’s problem. This concept is ingrained in every person from babyhood.
And this brings us to the formal dinner parties. Big dinners are generally given by a host of whom help is required. The one who has a need is the guest of honor 2 but has an elevated social status that gives the host ‘face.’ The other guests are the guanxi and friends of the host, and depending on the particular situation, it could include anyone from the director of a museum to the driver of the company car. Each of the other attendees are carefully chosen because they will be directly or indirectly involved with fulfilling the need of the guest of honor. In turn, the guest of honor will become the member of the guanxi of those attending -- including the chauffeur. These reciprocal relationships are powerful, all pervasive, and extremely effective channels though which business and social affairs have been conducted in China since time immemorial. It is rarely talked about, but this well-oiled mechanism is well understood and continuously employed. Dinner parties are especially well suited to keep this network running smoothly.
I remember one of the first big dinner parties I attended in 1995 in Hailar, Inner Mongolia, where my husband and I were invited to give lectures by the Hailar Culture Bureau. Our host, Mr. Chen, who at that time was the head of the Culture Bureau’s history department, was the host, and he arranged the

dinner to welcome us. About 10 people sat around the big round table, and the dinner lasted for about three hours.
At that time I did not know why there were so many guests. Only afterwards did I discover that the other guests invited by our host were a number of his guanxi and included writers, poets, journalists, students, and chauffeurs, who came to ‘look at’ us, discover who we were, and what we were going to lecture about. The next day these guests — having noted our expertise and status — brought others their guanxi -- to the lectures. Other guests at the table were other friends, one of whom knew the best watermelon vendor for the picnic the following day, the man who was to lend the minibus to take the group on the picnic, and another who knew the best way to reach the immense Mongolian grassland’s most scenic areas where the picnic was to be held. They were all there to ‘take care of’ us, the guests of honor, to the best of their ability. It was Mr. Chen’s job as host to arrange the lectures, the hotel, the travel, and the picnic by calling on his guanxi.
In 2013 I wanted to visit Anyang, the capital city of the ancient Shang Dynasty (1675-1050 BC), its archeological sites and the museums, all of which are important sources for my research. When we arrived, our host, Mr. Zhang, the father of my husband’s student, arranged a welcome dinner party for us. We were the guests of honor. That evening Mr. Zhang’s guanxi included his three brothers-in-law and his sister-in-law (fig. 8). The brothers-in-law represented Mr. Zhang’s wife who was unable to attend, the dinner, though she came to meet us the next day.

When Mr. Zhang, who is the chief of police in Anyang, and we arrived at the restaurant, we were led to a small private dining room and waited until the other guests arrived. In a big private dining rooms for a big party, seats along the wall are provided for chatting or waiting until all the guests arrive. No one sits down until the host points out the seat for each guest. The arrangement is according to tradition and is the privilege of the host. For any guest to choose his or her own seat at the table, even if tired,

without the invitation of the host would be very impolite. Politeness and consideration for others is a Confucian value of proper behavior (Analects 7.17).
The guests of honor — in this case my husband and I -- always sit facing the entrance — the place of honor -- and the host often sits opposite. The host chooses to sit close to the door, so as to manage the smooth arrival of the courses, and ensure that all the food is the best quality. This shows his respect for the guest of honor. If the host also has a high social status (in this case Mr. Zhang who is a local government official), he can sit next to the guest of honor. To the right and left from the host are the more important (honored) guest, that is, those from his quanxi who have important social status, or may have major roles in taking care of the needs for the guest(s) of honor. In a big dinner party of ten guests to a table, those farthest from the host are the guests who have least contact or less important roles in relation to the guest of honor.
The procedure of the seating always goes with a little deferential ceremony when the guest of honor profusely thanks the host for his kindness, and demurs to sit at the place of honor. However, eventually he accepts and only then will the host continue to appoint the seats of the other guests. Ritual, according to Confucian ethics, and humility according to Daoist philosophy, is in operation here.
Each person must be treated publicly according to his/her social station, which is actually the acknowledgement of his achievements. Though today Chinese society is focused more on socially elevating workers and farmers for their contributions, in many respects learning and knowledge have remained paramount values since the times of Confucius (Analects 7. 21). Because we were academics, the host showed us extra respect by ordering the most famous and expensive local dishes.
Although western Communism has been embraced by China in the past sixty years, even today, Confucius is not only honored (and worshipped, see fig.11) as a philosopher, but also as a great teacher and advocate for education. Long ignored officially, today, he has been ‘rehabilitated’ for his views regarding knowledge and learning. This value is reflected in his Analects (Analects 2.15):
The Master said, ‘Learning without thought is labor lost; Thought without learning is perilous.’
'He was the first teacher in ancient China who accepted students from every walks of life, without social rank. This was an unusual practice, since in his time only nobles and royalty were entitled to education:
The Master said, 'From the man bringing his bundle of dried flesh for my teaching upwards, I have never refused instruction to any one.' (Analects 7.7)
and,
The Master said, 'In teaching there should be no distinction of classes.' (Analects 15-38)

The only requirement was that the student show a genuine desire to learn:
The Master said, 'I do not open up the truth to one who is not eager to get knowledge, nor help out any one who is not anxious to explain himself. When I have presented one corner of a subject to any one, and he cannot from it learn the other three, I do not repeat my lesson.' (Analects 7.8)
The influence of Confucius on Chinese society cannot be overrated. This is clearly demonstrated by the fact that his tomb and the surrounding cemetery where his descendants are buried, as well as the extensive memorial palace. These are locations of pilgrimage for millions of people each year. The extensive cemetery, the palace, and his tomb are in Qufu city, Shandong province (fig. 9).

At a formal dinner party the hosts of high social standing may delegate the chores of looking after the timely arrival and quality of the food to one of his or her quanxi who then sits closest to the entrance of the dining room. In this case, the sister-in-law of Mr. Zhang was appointed to fulfill this position. This delegation of a duty is also a sign to the guest of honor (my husband and me) that the host, Mr. Zhang, has a rather high social standing in society.
All the food was ordered by Mr. Zhang ahead of time, and the cooks and waiters who were to take care of the dinner were standing outside the private dining room. They were all smiling as we filed into the room. This was also a demonstration, that the host is an important customer at the restaurant. The staff knew it, acknowledged it, and was doing their best to make the dinner a success. The staff thus belongs to Mr. Zhang’s guanxi, and a successful dinner would give him “face” in front of his guests, at the same time ensuring that Mr. Zhang could be counted on for his continued patronage of the restaurant.
In China if more than four people eat together they prefer a round rather than a square table. Dinner parties can have as many as twelve people around a huge round table. The shape of the table is also significant. A round table provides an egalitarian arrangement of diners, and actually ensures that the dishes that are placed in the center on a turntable are equally accessible to all. This is something that cannot be achieved if the table is long. The equal accessibility of all the dishes by all the diners is an important aspect in Chinese society. Food is considered the source of life, which sounds obvious, but nothing is as important in China as the act of eating. In a country where historically famine was by no means a stranger, people learned to appreciate the value of food. They have a certain reverence for it, which for westerners can be a little mystifying.
Since the host chooses whom to invite, he shows his respect for the guests by sharing food with them equally. At the same time, all the guests are face-to-face with each other, and all can take part, or listen to, the conversations. This allows for comfortable flow of information and relationship building. This becomes an ‘equal opportunity’ dining experience, where the guests have the chance to get to know each other, taking mental notes of each others’ character, status, and circumstances for future reference. In other words, building guanxi.
The dinner usually begins with a number of cold dishes as small appetizers. Hot dishes follow, and last comes the soup. Chinese usually eat fruit at the end of a meal, and sweet deserts or coffee are not part of dinner. However, beer, wine, liquor, juices and tea flow freely — often all at the same time. Hosts often pour out the first glass of hard liquor and offer it to the guest of honor in the gesture of welcome. When he pours, he usually pours in such a way that the liquid overflows onto the floor or tabletop. This also signifies his largesse, specifically that he is not stingy with expensive liquor, and does not mind wasting some of it. There are several welcoming toasts to the guest of honor by other diners all through dinner. These range from thanking the guest of honor for accepting an invitation or coming for a visit, and invite the guests to return soon. This is no idle talk. If the guest may be ungracious, this invitation will not be voiced.
At an elaborate dinner party the number of courses served can be between twenty to thirty. But the law of Dao rules, which means that there are no set numbers of dishes to be ordered. The number depends on the pocketbook and ‘face’ of the host. All hosts want to outdo themselves in quality and

generosity. A host can ‘lose face’ in front of the guests for being stingy if the table does not have enough food on it. Stinginess would also mean, by Confucian standards, the lack of respect and improper behavior toward the guest, losing face, perpetrating ill will, which is to be avoided at all cost. Ill will is not a way to build good guanxi, and would place harmonious situations in jeopardy.
At a formal dinner party it would be a great faux pas to order food only for oneself separately. The ordering is done by the host ahead of time. Depending on the occasion and if the host knows the guests, he sometimes asks the guests what their preference or favorite dishes are so he can order them. Though the rules of Confucianism are always in operation, the Chinese are grand masters of flexibility and ‘thinking on their feet,’ elegantly adjusting to situations. Going with the flow is Daoism in practice:
What is and what is not give birth to one another, What is difficult and what is easy complete one another, Long and short complement one another, High and low incline towards one another, Note and noise harmonize with one another, Before and after follow one another (Eno: Chapter 2).
In Anyang, Mr. Zhang, our host, could not ordered according to our taste since he had never met us, and as we travelled all day from Hangzhou to Anyang, he wanted to show extra thoughtfulness with a readily prepared, sumptuous dinner of choice delicacies and locally famous northern dishes. I must say that they were some of the best food I have ever tasted.
The dishes were placed in the center of the table for all to partake, and throughout dinner the waiters continually removed the empty dishes replacing them with new courses. As the dishes arrived, they were placed in front of us, as the guest of honor, and we were expected to be first to eat from them before the others touched the foods. All throughout the dinner the host paid close attention to make sure the new dishes are always placed first in front of the guests of honor.
I remember a Chinese friend recalling an incident with a western European visitor who clearly was not aware of her role as a guest of honor. At dinner, as the dishes arrived in front of her, she said, “Ah, these are all for me!” and did not share them with the others around the table. The Chinese, being polite, did not say anything, but were shocked, and quietly ordered more food.
Mr. Zhang, wanting to be a gracious host, and demonstrating his gesture of respect, generosity, and taste, described each dish as to its fame, rarity, and preparation. A man’s status can be enhanced by his knowledge of good cuisine. Connoisseurship has always been highly respected in China, as we noted above in the case of Yi Yin. Though for some dishes there is a common big spoon or ladle for soups and sauces, each guest uses his own chopstick to pick a mouthful of food from the common plate and place it on the small plate in front of him. At this point, we must examine the role of the chopstick.
Chopsticks are used not only in China but also in Korea, Japan and Southeast Asia as well as in Mongolia and Tibet. These are all societies that have been influenced to some extent by Confucianism

and Daoism. The flag of Korea clearly shows this connection. The Daoist yin-yang sign is in the center of the flag, surrounded by the four black bagua (eight symbols of Taoist cosmology) of the Yijing (Book of Changes) (fig. 12).
(fig. 12) Flag of South Korea, with the center blue-red Daoist yin-yang symbol and the black bagua.
The chopstick, which many westerners consider a ‘primitive eating tool,’ is by no means primitive. It was already in use 5000 years ago, and Shang emperors ordered theirs to be made from ivory. Confucius also preferred chopsticks to knives at table (Needham: 2000; 104). It is a utensil thoughtfully put in the service of carefully developed eating ethics, following Confucian propriety, in this case politeness and consideration for others. The chopstick ensures that any one diner can, and should, take only one mouthful of food at one time. This way no one can grab all the most expensive, or his favorite delicacies for himself, leaving nothing for the others around the table. Of course, throughout the meal, everybody can take food repeatedly with his chopstick from the common dishes. Guests also demonstrate politeness by making sure to taste all the delicacies while moving the turntable around slowly, so all can reach all the plates. The chopstick therefore is also the symbol of good fellowship, sharing, demonstrating polite behavior of self-denial, temperance, and thoughtfulness for others.
At the many dinner parties my husband and I attended, sometimes the host or his wife would take choice morsels with their chopstick and place them on my plate. With this gesture they showed their respect and largesse. However, by giving me only one morsel she also demonstrated to the others that though she wanted to favor me with her attention, it does not mean the other guests have to go without. The use of the round table, the commonly available dishes placed in the center on a turntable, and the use of chopsticks all demonstrate the Chinese idea of good will and sharing — and especially sharing food, the source of life -- as a vehicle of polite harmonious behavior. People who do not share or offer food to friends are considered to be supremely impolite, stingy, selfish, and thoughtless. Indeed, I have never met such a Chinese person.
It is quite a job to be a good host. Mr. Zhang, while having a lively conversation and eating himself, was paying close attention to what the guests of honor were eating. He noticed if I took more than once from a dish, and asked if I would like him to order more. At another dinner party, I was amazed to see one of my favorite dishes on the table. As I savored the dish, the host said he remembered that some months earlier I had praised this dish, and this time he ordered it especially for me. This was a demonstration of the epitome of thoughtfulness.

Proper Confucian behavior is also expected from the guest of honor who has now become a part of the host’s guanxi. Actually, they become each other’s guanxi. A guest shows proper behavior by not usurping the role of the host. As mentioned above, seating, ordering, and managing the details of the dishes are the prerogative of the host. A polite guest does not ask for special drinks, or dishes, but waits until his host will notice if his wineglass is empty and have it refilled.
A polite guest does not complain about the food, but takes a bit of every dish on the table, even if he might not like it. A guest who would make demands or orders extra food for himself from the waiter risks loosing his own face and insulting the host. A properly behaved guest also praises the dishes, inquires about the preparation and history of special foods, and repeatedly thanks the host for his kindness and attention by saying “Ah, hen mafan ni!! (Oh, you went though so much trouble!). The guest of honor also has the opportunity to evaluate the behavior of the host and knows that they are now members of their mutual guanxi.
After all this, it is probably needless to say that if an invitation is made for a formal dinner party, the host foots the bill. Often the host already paid the bill in advance, and if the dinner is of especially high quality the guests take due notice and will esteem him for his generosity. It would be considered an insult to him if the guest of honor offered to pay for the dinner, and even more of an insult if the guest were to offer to pay for his own share only.
If someone wants the help from one of his guanxi, with whom he has not had contact for a long time, he generally offers a gift. The message is “I am offering you something for the trouble of asking you for help.” It is not a bribe, since the help given is often substantial and much more in value than the initial ‘offering.’
Friends who ask for his opinion often visit my husband, an expert in music. Years ago one friend we have not seen for a long time invited us to an elaborate dinner party, and gave us some expensive tea and to me a pearl necklace. I later discovered that the friend wanted my husband to listen to his twelve year old daughter play the pipa, an ancient stringed instrument, and give his opinion weather the girl had talent or not. The father’s spending money on her music education, and pushing her to apply to the music high school attached to the prestigious China Conservatory of Music in Beijing, depended on my husband’s evaluation. After listening to her, my husband told him that she was very talented and if she should apply, she would be accepted. That is what happened, and four years later she auditioned and was accepted to the China Conservatory of Music.
Today she is one of the best pipa players in China and is a professor at the China Conservatory of Music. The family considers my husband’s evaluation of her abilities a critical turning point in the career of their daughter. Thus, whenever they discover we are in Beijing, they roll out the red carpet, so to speak.
While a dinner party seems like a casual affair — people rarely dress up for the occasion -- it is governed by old tried-and-true customs that have been in practice for thousands of years. According to Dao and Confucius one must always keep in mind that in any human interaction a win-win solution should be the aim. Favors and help are first given, and at some time in the future the debt can be called in.

The network of guanxi is alive and well in China, and is not in danger of being dismantled any time soon. The system works very well. The building of these lifelong relationships is continuous and also takes place during times of sharing food together.
Formal dinners have time-honored rituals that establish status, familiarity, new guanxi, and solidify old connections between the host and his guests, as well as among the guests themselves. Guanxi would not work if the concepts of Laozi and Confucius had not been absorbed -- but most essentially subscribed to and practiced -- in Chinese society, focusing on benevolence and reciprocity in order to get on in life and maintain a harmonious existence. The 81st Chapter of the Dao De Jing eloquently illustrates the underlying value of guanxi, which is the main, though by no means the only aim of the formal Chinese dinners:
Sages do not accumulate; The more they assist others, the more they possess, The more they give to others, the more they gain (Lin: 2007).

Les Juifs d ́Istanbul
Découverte d'une communauté ancestrale
Depuis 1987, c'est la troisième fois que je me trouve réinstallée à Istanbul pour y travailler. Le premier séjour fut l'occasion de découvrir l'incroyable diversité des communautés qui vivent dans cette cité toute empreinte d'histoire.
La chrétienne catholique que j'étais découvrit là trente-cinq Eglises différentes, des communautés de Grecs, d'Arméniens orthodoxes1, de catholiques et de protestants, de Chaldéens alors sur les routes d'un long exode depuis le sud est de la Turquie (autour de Mardin, Mydiat ...), en passant par Istanbul pour parfois émigrer jusqu'en Suède ou en France2, les Syriaques et encore tant d'autres. Je fréquentais assidûment l'Eglise orthodoxe arménienne pendant ces cinq premières années de séjour. J'aimais la liturgie, les voix graves et puissantes de la chorale, l'accueil chaleureux que Nişan, un Arménien émigré de Russie dont le livre de chevet était Le Pélerin russe, réservait toujours à ma petite famille. J'étais fascinée en observant cet intense espace de socialisation qui se déployait et dont le centre était l'Eglise. Je découvrais ce qu'était une communauté minoritaire dans un Etat laïc, la Turquie, qui n'avait pu se
1 Les Arméniens orthodoxes sont appelés par les Latins grégoriens ; quant à eux, ils ne reconnaissent pas cette dénomination récente, le mot orthodoxe dénote leur ancienneté, égale à celle des Byzantins orthodoxes.

résoudre à abolir complètement dans ses gestes quotidiens la dhimmitude, ce statut particulier réservé aux minorités religieuses dans les pays islamiques, qui à la fois protégeait les minoritaires et les stigmatisait, en faisant d'eux d'éternels citoyens de seconde zone. Venant de France, je connaissais des phénomènes comme le racisme, l'exclusion économique, sociale, mais certainement pas ce type de rapports qui liait un peuple gouvernant des minorités qui coexistaient sur la même terre depuis aussi longtemps, voire plus longtemps que leurs dirigeants. Ni les réformes abolissant officiellement la dhimmitude en 1856, ni la Constitution de la République turque fondée par Mustafa Kemal Atatürk ne vinrent à bout des traditions. A y regarder de près, je restai frappée par les contradictions de l'Histoire : des tentatives réitérées d'intégrer un modèle moderne de citoyenneté dont la clé de voûte était l'égalité des droits, et la constatation que cette République s'était de fait établie sur l'identité entre le Turc et le Musulman, rejetant sans appel tous les non Musulmans dans une zone de tolérance fragile, exerçant sur eux une pression non dite, les réduisant à une non existence politique, les obligeant à éternellement complaire au pouvoir en place pour acheter leur droit de vivre sur une terre que leurs ancêtres habitaient depuis toujours.
Toutes ces découvertes furent bien assez pour couvrir ces cinq années alors que nos pas nous menaient ailleurs dans le vaste monde.
Sur la route itinérante des épopées du monde qu'étudiait mon mari, nous quittâmes la Turquie pour l'Inde, puis la Chine, et ce n'est que treize ans plus tard, en 2005, que je revins à Istanbul. Entretemps, j'avais commencé des études d'hébreu, de pensée et d'Histoire juives. Ce faisant, mon regard adopta le point de vue de minorité juive. Ce point de vue marginal me révélait toute une autre face de l'Histoire, et de ma religion, le catholicisme. Pendant ces années, l'interreligieux, le « vivre-ensemble » étaient devenus à la mode, du fait du resurgissement des revendications communautaires en France dues à l'exclusion sociale d'un certain pourcentage de la population issue de l'immigration (environ 10%), à leurs difficultés d'intégration. La Révolution Française pensait avoir débarrassé le monde de ces problématiques « arriérées », réduit les conflits à des luttes de classes, des idéologies nationalistes. Et l'on découvrait soudain, à la fin du XX° siècle que l'identité religieuse n'était qu'en sommeil, mais certainement pas effacée. Ainsi les juifs avaient payé fort cher en Europe leur particularité religieuse (ghettos, expulsions, persécutions, pogroms ...), le point culminant de leur rejet et de la haine deux fois millénaires à leur égard avait explosé dans l'horreur de la Shoah.
C'est pourquoi en revenant à Istanbul, je découvris naturellement l'histoire des Juifs de Turquie. Je ne restais là qu'une année, mais pour y revenir en 2011. Ce troisième séjour me laissa plus de temps pour explorer cette facette de l'Histoire turque.
Au fil des rencontres, des lectures, mes observations se structurèrent afin d'évoquer la présence des Juifs à Istanbul à travers l'Histoire.
C'est au travers de mes activités à Istanbul que j'ai approfondi quelques points ayant trait à l'Histoire juive en cette partie du monde. Comme membre du Comité interreligieux du vicariat apostolique d'Istanbul, j'organise des rencontres régulières avec des chrétiens pendant lesquelles nous

travaillons le texte biblique dans la perspective de développer la connaissance de nos racines théologiques juives et l'estime du peuple juif afin d'inciter à des relations fraternelles, de sortir, conformément aux recommandations du Concile Vatican II de « l'enseignement du mépris »3 envers les Juifs à la pleine reconnaissance de leur identité religieuse. S'il est une chose dont l'Eglise catholique peut être fière, c'est de son revirement complet dans sa relation au judaïsme et aux autres religions, d'avoir compris qu'il était incongru, parfaitement contradictoire de prétendre être disciple de Jésus de Nazareth et d'imposer violemment sa croyance, de mépriser des hommes qui appartenaient à d'autres religions.
Nous évoquons souvent dans le groupe la réciprocité des points de vue, les valeurs communes et les spécificités de chaque religion dans le respect des uns et des autres, sans aucun syncrétisme. Et chaque année nous finissons notre étude par une sortie à la rencontre du monde juif à Istanbul. C'est ainsi que nous avons visité plusieurs synagogues, le musée juif, des quartiers où la population juive fut largement représentée dans les siècles passés. C'est à chaque fois l'occasion de rencontres, de découvertes, l'occasion de faire connaître notre démarche, notre intérêt envers le judaïsme, notre désir de fraternité. Il me semble que tant pour les chrétiens qui sortent de leur égocentrisme que pour les Juifs qui ont besoin du soutien moral et affectif des non Juifs alors que trop souvent l'actualité les stigmatise dans un pays ou un autre, ce modeste travail est une petite pierre pour concourir à édifier la paix, le shalom entre les peuples et les hommes.
Un témoin engagé de l'Histoire juive à Istanbul
Il y a peu, je rencontrai Monsieur Naïm Güleryüz, octogénaire toujours en pleine activité intellectuelle et militante, je l'interrogeai sur son histoire et son parcours personnel.
Séfarade, son arrière-grand-père était d'Edirne (1850), sa mère d'Istanbul. En 1936, son père dut changer de nom lors de l'enregistrement des états civils en mairie, car on autorisait qu'un seul même nom par district. Déconcerté, comme tant d'autres, par ce changement d'identité imposé, au lieu de contester il sourit de ce qui lui apparaissait comme un non sens ; l'employé de l'état-civil l'affubla alors du nom de Güleryüz « le visage qui rit ». Son fils, qui vit actuellement en Angleterre, a repris le nom de ses ancêtres, Avigdor.
Le père de Naïm apprit le français à l'école de l'Alliance Israélite Universelle, et à la maison on parlait aussi le français. Lui-même fit ses études au Lycée francophone Saint Michel.
Monsieur Güleryüz est devenu l'historien de la communauté juive de Turquie, consignant les archives sur la vie juive à partir tant des documents juifs que des documents byzantins, ottomans ou de la République. Il a écrit sur les synagogues encore existantes, les synagogues disparues en Anatolie, l'Histoire juive de l'époque byzantine à aujourd'hui, la presse juive (les journaux publiés par les Juifs et
3 Expression utilisée pour la première fois par l'historien juif Jules Isaac qui perdit sa femme et ses deux filles dans la Shoah et rencontra après-guerre la Pape Jean XXIII. Il fit 18 propositions pour arrêter l'enseignement du mépris des Juifs jusqu'alors transmis par l'Eglise.

les Juifs dans la presse)... Il fut aussi le coordinateur du projet du Musée juif qui ouvrit pour les célébrations du cinq-centenaire de l'accueil des Juifs sépharades en Turquie, suite à leur expulsion d'Espagne et du Portugal, en 1492 et 1497. C'est encore lui qui prit l'initiative de rédiger le dernier journal juif d'Istanbul (Shalom) en turc, en 1984, et de ne conserver qu'une page en judéo-espagnol afin de sauver le journal tout en préservant quelque chose de la langue et de la culture judéo-espagnoles4.
Il faut encore préciser que Monsieur Güleryüz fut aussi conseiller du Grand Rabbin pendant une trentaine d'années et qu'il parcourt le monde pour donner des conférences en diverses langues et participer à des colloques afin de faire connaître les Juifs de Turquie et leur histoire. Il est l'une des figures très actives de la communauté juive d'Istanbul.
Un des premiers points qu'il m'expliqua, ce fut la différence des Juifs de Turquie, dont la communauté répond à certaines spécificités.
Il existe deux mots en turc pour désigner les Juifs : 1. Musevi5 désigne l'appartenance religieuse, s'applique aux Juifs observants, aux prosélytes ; le mot apparut lors de la nouvelle République, au moment du traité de Lausanne (1921), c'est un mot administratif qui inscrit les Juifs dans la catégorie des minorités avec les Arméniens, les Grecs .... 2. Yahudi6 désigne les Juifs ancestraux, l'origine ; le mot a des connotations péjoratives, est associé à des qualificatifs dépréciatifs comme pis « sale ». On reste Yahudi même si on change de religion
L'Empire Ottoman était organisé selon des milletim « nations, communautés ». Avec le Traité de Lauzanne, le principe de millet disparut, les minorités bénéficièrent de certains droits. Les Juifs refusèrent ces droits qui les différenciaient des citoyens turcs musulmans, leur souhait était d'être des citoyens turcs, ordinaires, à part entière, d'avoir les mêmes droits et les mêmes devoirs. Ils n'obtinrent pas gain de cause et restèrent classés dans la catégorie des minorités. L'Etat turc leur accorda seulement que les affaires civiles, comme le mariage le divorce et aussi l'héritage, dépendissent du code civil. Ainsi un juif en Turquie ne peut se marier religieusement qu'après s'être marié civilement. Les écoles, quant à elles, sont considérées comme des écoles minoritaires.
La communauté juive actuelle
La communauté juive actuelle de Turquie comprend 96% de Séfarades, les autres sont pour la plupart des Ashkénazes, leur nombre ne cesse de diminuer. On compte également quelques Italiens qui descendent des marranes (Juifs convertis de force au christianisme en Espagne ou au Portugal mais qui
4 En effet, de moins en moins de personnes lisant le judéo-espagnol, le journal n'aurait pas tardé à disparaître faute d'abonnés. En turc, il redevint un lien communautaire fort, informant et stimulant l'intérêt pour la culture et l'histoire des Juifs de Turquie.

continuent à pratiquer secrètement leur religion d’origine), un petit cercle de Loubavitch récemment implantés, une quarantaine de Caraïtes. L'ensemble de la communauté s'élève à environ 15 000 personnes à Istanbul. Il existe de très petites communautés à Izmir, Bursa, Kushadasi, Ankara, Antioche ou Adana.
Il n'existe plus de quartier spécifiquement juif, comme sous l'Empire ottoman. Beaucoup de Juifs habitent à Nişantaşı, Ettiler où l'on a construit l'actuel lycée juif Ulus, Yeniköy, Kemerburgaz, ou sur la rive asiatique sur la riche avenue, Cadde Bostan.
Il y a à Istanbul 18 synagogues en service, beaucoup d’autres sont fermées ou n'ouvrent qu'occasionnellement afin de conserver la mémoire des lieux, des anciens quartiers juifs et de l'histoire communautaire. On y organise des célébrations auxquelles se rendent des Juifs dont les ascendants habitaient là mais qui eux-mêmes ont migré vers des quartiers plus modernes et plus dynamiques.
Si, comme dans les communautés du monde entier, du point de vue de la pratique religieuse, on distingue le Juif des trois prières très observant, et celui dit « de Kippour » qui se contente d'aller à la synagogue à l'occasion des grandes fêtes et qui se sent surtout juif de culture, les Juifs ne se rattachent pas, en Turquie, aux divers courants orthodoxe, libéral ou massorti. Le Grand Rabbin est orthodoxe, la communauté suit son rabbin. Individuellement, on trouve des juifs plus ou moins conservateurs, plus ou moins libéraux, plus ou moins pratiquants ou tout à fait laïcs, mais la communauté se rassemble, unifiée, pour les grands événements. Il n'empêche que des points de vue divergents peuvent se rencontrer, par exemple entre l'attitude traditionnelle et officielle qui affiche une grande entente avec les dirigeants, n'a aucune revendication politique, négocie les difficultés de la communauté au cas par cas, et une autre attitude, plus moderne et directe, qui revendique sur la base d'une constitution démocratique et de la citoyenneté turque le respect de ses droits, l'adoption d'un profil bas n'attirant qu'un empiétement toujours plus grand des droits. Nous avons là deux positions opposées qui se réfèrent à deux périodes de l'Histoire, ottomane et contemporaine, et qui soulignent la difficulté pour le gouvernement à traiter ses minorités selon sa constitution. Etre Juif ou Chrétien n'équivaut pas de facto à être Musulman. Le facteur religieux reste un paramètre politique et social dans la Turquie moderne. Il faudrait encore introduire des nuances dans cette analyse car au sein même de l'islam turc, il existe des minorités, comme par exemple les Alévis qui souffrent aussi de discriminations et de persécutions.
Le lycée juif, installé dans le quartier d'Ulus, assure la scolarité des élèves du jardin d'enfant au lycée. Aujourd'hui, suite au petit nombre de juifs en Turquie, pour inscrire un élève, on accepte qu'un seul parent, la mère ou le père, soit juif. Comme bien des lycées juifs dans le monde, celui d'Istanbul entretient des relations continues avec Israël, organisant des programmes d'étude sur l'histoire d'Israël, sur la Shoah, ... Des voyages sont organisés, tant en Israël que vers les lieux de mémoire, en Pologne ou ailleurs. Certaines familles font le choix d'autres écoles, tout en assurant parfois parallèlement l'apprentissage de la langue hébraïque.
Il y a évidemment des mariages entre les diverses communautés, sépharades, ashkénazes et même caraïtes, et environ 35%, 40% de mariages mixtes entre Juifs et Musulmans. Quand un Musulman et une

Juive se marient, à quelle communauté les enfants appartiennent-ils ? En général, selon Monsieur Güleryüz, il s'agit de familles très tolérantes, dans lesquelles on célèbre les fêtes des deux communautés et on laisse les enfants choisir plus tard une religion. Mais c'est évidemment la porte ouverte à une assimilation douce vers l'islam.
La langue des Juifs de Turquie était majoritairement depuis l'arrivée des Sépharades, le judéoespagnol7, un judéo-espagnol mâtiné de mots turcs sous l'influence du nouvel environnement. On trouve un exemplaire du Me'am Loez8 au Musée juif en écriture Rachi. Les écoles de L'Alliance Israélité Universelle ont promu le français comme langue de culture et de promotion sociale, et le turc afin de permettre des échanges avec la population turque. Puis la République turque a rendu obligatoire l'apprentissage du turc. Le judéo-espagnol s'est trouvé dévalorisé, langue d'une communauté repliée sur elle-même, indigente, sans éducation, alors que les élites apprenaient des langues étrangères. Peu à peu les Juifs de Turquie ont arrêté d'apprendre cette langue. Il est difficile aujourd'hui d'en trouver des locuteurs, quelques personnes âgées le parlent encore plus ou moins bien. Les linguistes ont évidemment commencé à trouver la situation préoccupante, et on étudie aujourd'hui le judéo-espagnol de façon académique afin de le sauver de la disparition, de préserver l'accès aux nombreux documents et ouvrages qui attestent de l'histoire d'une communauté importante du monde juif. Ainsi, dans les années 1980 on pense faire au judéo-espagnol un enterrement de 3ème classe. Presque plus personne ne peut lire Shalom, le dernier journal juif publié à Istanbul, écrit en judéo-espagnol ; Monsieur Güleryüz réorganise l'édition en turc, en conservant une page en judéo-espagnol afin que la connaissance de la langue se transmette, ainsi que toute la vie culturelle associée à cette langue et à l'époque où elle fut parlée en Turquie. Le journal Shalom est aussi diffusé à l'étranger et lu par environ 400 000 Juifs dans le monde. Il existe aussi, depuis mars 2005, un supplément mensuel, El Amaneser, entièrement rédigé en judéo-espagnol.
7 Le judéo-espagnol, langue parlée des communautés juives originaires d'Espagne, est à distinguer du ladino, langue liturgique écrite à l'époque médiévale espagnole.
8 Le Meam Loaz est un commentaire de la Bible rédigé en judéo-espagnol.

Une page de Shalom : titre en turc et en hébreu, texte en judéo-espagnol
C'est par une petite analyse9 des numéros de Shalom que nous jaugeons le processus d'assimilation linguistique des Juifs d'Istanbul en Turquie : premièrement, les phrases rédigées en judéo-espagnol sont de plus en plus émaillées de mots et d'expressions soit calqués du turc ou bien empruntés avec des modifications phonétiques. Par exemple : 'las mujeres hitch no saliyan de kuaza'10 où l'etymon 'hitch' ( hiç en turc) a remplacé 'nunca'. Nous lisons, également, des locutions comme 'un alay de kozas'11 où le mot 'alay' 'groupe, procession' provient du turc. Voici le turc 'mahalle' (quartier) qui fait office de 'barrio', ou bien 'kazal' pour 'pueblo', sans doute du turc 'kasaba' (village), 'miskin' pour 'pobre' repris directement du turc 'miskin' (pauvre, misérable, abject), 'hazinura' (trésor) du 'hazine', 'meşe' au lieu de 'roble' (chêne),12 et cet étymon curieux 'mavas' qui indique une 'barque de pêcheurs', peut-être du mot turc 'mavi' qui signifie à la fois 'bleu' et 'la mer'. Nous lisons aussi la locution adverbiale 'mas mejor', agrammaticale en espagnol (plus meilleur!), vraisemblablement calquée du turc 'daha iyi'.
L'assimilation linguistique et donc culturelle joue aussi à un autre niveau lorsque nous observons l'évolution de Shalom : maints mots écrits en judéo-espagnol nécessitent une précision sémantique en turc ; on lit entre parenthèses à la suite du mot en question l'équivalent turc. Par exemple, 'borar' (silmek) qui signifie 'effacer' ; 'astusia' (kurnazlık) 'ruse', 'ramo' (demet) 'bouquet' ;13 'pisina' (havuz) 'piscine' ; 'gruta' (mağara) 'grotte' ; adneanos (köylü) 'villageois' ; 'fortaleza' (kale) 'forteresse' ; 'prejuisios' (ön yargı), la locution adverbiale 'de medio' (vasıta) 'au moyen de', etc., la liste est très longue.14
Voici quelques exemple d'articles pour entretenir et développer la connaissance du judéo-espagnol, et un article en turc, reflet de la communauté d'Istanbul.
9 Merci à Paul MIRABILE, mon mari, pour m'avoir apporté ses précieuses connaissances en judéo-espagnol afin de rédiger ce paragraphe.
10 'Les femmes ne sortent jamais (hitch) de la maison.' (Notre traduction)
11 'Un tas (alay) de choses'.
12 Il est curieux de remarquer que l'éditeur a mis entre parenthèses le mot en français 'chêne' pour faire comprendre le mot turc 'meşe' !
13 Mais 'ramo' en judéo-espagnol veut dire 'branche'.

La communauté juive de Turquie ne cesse de voir le nombre de ses membres diminuer, les départs des jeunes se poursuivre inexorablement. On a fêté avec grand faste en 1992 le cinq-centenaire de l'accueil des Sépaharades dans la capitale ottomane, et à cette occasion, un musée juif, régulièrement visité par des groupes de touristes, a été ouvert dans l'ancienne synagogue Zulfaris, à Karaköy, qui date du XVI°siècle et a été restaurée au XIX°par le comte de Camondo, riche banquier et grand mécène de la communauté juive. La synagogue Zulfaris, sépharade, ne servait plus au culte depuis que la synagogue de Neve Shalom est entrée en fonctionnement au début des années 50. L'ouverture du musée lui a redonné une fonction et une vie nouvelle. Les groupes de touristes juifs en visite à Istanbul, en règle générale, ne manquent pas d'y passer.

Dans le musée sont exposés des documents, textes et objets, des journaux qui témoignent de l’histoire de la communauté, des personnalités qui ont marqué son histoire, grands rabbins ou grandes familles, des photos de rencontres officielles attestant la bonne entente avec les autorités turques. Un étage est consacré à la reconstitution ethnographique de costumes et scènes évoquant la vie traditionnelle de la fin du XVIII° siècle. Il est aujourd'hui question de transférer, pour des raisons économiques et aussi de sécurité, les collections du musées dans dans l'enceinte de la Synagogue Neve Shalom, beaucoup plus difficile d'accès et moins intéressante architecturalement parlant, mais mieux sécurisée à la suite des trois attentats qui ont tragiquement marqués son histoire en 1986, 1992 et 2003. Neve shalom est désormais le lieu des rassemblements de l'ensemble de la communauté.

Après les années 40 et le terrible impôt sur la fortune15 qui frappa les minorités du pays, beaucoup de Juifs quittèrent la Turquie pour le nouvel Etat d’Israël, l’Amérique du Sud, l’Amérique Centrale ou encore la France. C’est aussi l’époque où certains changèrent à nouveau de quartier migrant vers Şişli ou Kadiköy.
Diversité des communautés juives de Turquie
Avant de considérer plus en détails l'histoire de chaque communauté voici, par ordre chronologique, les noms des diverses communautés juives présentes dans l'Histoire en Asie Mineure, dont chacune apporta de sa terre et de sa culture d'origines, constituant un paysage ethnique et culturel tout en nuances.
 Les Romaniotes  Les Caraïtes  Les Ashkénazes  les Sépharades  Les Sabbatéens  Les Loubavitch
Les Juifs ont connu une très ancienne implantation à Istanbul et en Asie Mineure. Dès la destruction du Premier Temple, en 586 avant notre ère, des Juifs émigrèrent vers l'Asie Mineure. Cette Histoire reste à l'heure actuelle très lacunaire, incertaine, du fait du manque de documents. Il existait des communautés juives, à Smyrne (Izmir), en Galatie, à Antioche ou Ephèse, à Istanbul. C'est là que les Premiers Chrétiens, comme Paul et ses compagnons, au premier siècle, s'arrêtèrent pour y prêcher la Bonne Nouvelle, avant tout en milieu juif, dans des communautés de commerçants et de réfugiés qui avaient fui la Terre d'Israël lors de conflits régionaux.

Les Romaniotes
En l'an 70, Titus, l’empereur romain, prit la ville de Jérusalem et détruisit le Second Temple. Il amena beaucoup de Juifs en Asie mineure, on les appela les Romaniotes16. Ils formaient une importante communauté juive qui parlait la langue locale, le rum ou grec de l'Empire Romain oriental. Ils assimilèrent les communautés antérieures. On connaît, par certains textes des Pères de l’Eglise, les mesures discriminatoires que les Byzantins leur firent subir afin de les humilier et de les inciter à se convertir. Ainsi, l'empereur Justinien leur interdit de témoigner en justice contre les Chrétiens ; ils étaient aussi exclus de toutes les dignités. Au niveau religieux, alors qu'ils pratiquaient jusque-là librement leur religion, Justinien fit promulguer plusieurs édits contraignants : interdiction pour les Juifs de célébrer leur Pâque avant les Pâques chrétiennes, obligation de lire pendant les offices le texte biblique dans une traduction grecque17, ce qui, pensait l'empereur, faciliterait leur conversion ; interdiction également de réciter le Shema qui proclame l'unité de Dieu et le lien d'élection entre Dieu et le peuple d'Israël. Cette prière essentielle du judaïsme fut considérée par Justinien comme une polémique déguisée du dogme de la Trinité. Ces interdictions multiples forment la base de la plupart des mesures discriminatoires qu’on retrouvera dans le Moyen Age chrétien, sous la domination musulmane ou celle des nazis. Les Romaniotes parlaient le grec, résidaient dans les quartiers de Sirkeci et d'Eminönü, au confluent de la Corne d'Or et du Bosphore.
Les Caraïtes
Un prince hébreu en Israël refusa l'autorité du Talmud et des Sages d'Israël, et partit vivre en Egypte avec ses fidèles, donnant naissance à un nouveau courant du judaïsme. Le roi Khazar, dont le territoire était entouré de Chrétiens et de Musulmans, et qui subissait leurs pressions, se convertit au judaïsme (version caraïte) dont il fit la religion d'Etat de son royaume; la population du Royaume Khazar devint musevi, juive par conversion, et non yahudi, juive d'origine comme les descendants des patriarches, des douze tribus d'Israël. Ce détail eut une grande importance en diverses périodes très troublées de l'Histoire juive. Aujourd'hui, la plus grande communauté de Caraïtes (environ 25 000) vit en Israël où ils immigrèrent après 1948, fuyant les pays musulmans où ils ne se sentaient plus en sécurité. Certains partirent aux Etats-Unis en Californie, c'est la deuxième communauté. Une petite minorité, francophone, s'installa en France. En Lituanie, vit encore une ancienne communauté d'environ 400 Caraïtes. Ceux de Turquie vinrent de Crimée au IX°siècle. Ils s'implantèrent solidement, durablement.
Les Caraïtes d'Istanbul donnèrent, dit la Tradition, leur nom au village de Karakoÿ. Puisqu'ils ne reconnaissent pas la Torah orale, on les dit souvent, sans pouvoir le prouver, descendants des Sadducéens18, la caste des prêtres responsables de la liturgie au Temple de Jérusalem. Les Caraïtes
16 Romaniotes du mot Rum, habitants de l'Empire Romain d'Orient, ou Grecs byzantins installés en Asie mineure, dont la capitale, Constantinople, est appelée la Nouvelle Rome.
17 A l'imitation des Byzantins dont la liturgie et les études religieuses utilisaient la Septante, la version grecque de la Bible.
18 A l'époque du Second Temple, les Sadducéens s'opposent aux Pharisiens, les maîtres de la Torah Orale, et refusent les décisions juridiques qu'ils tirent de leurs interprétations du texte biblique.

parlent le gréco-caraïte, ils ont leurs propres synagogues. Aujourd’hui, il n'en reste qu'une en service dans le quartier d' Hasköy.
L'an passé, j'ai rencontré deux Juifs caraïtes, M. Leon Çoşkun et M. Ilya Abramoğlu, afin d'amener le groupe biblique dans le quartier d'Hasköy et de visiter la synagogue. Je leur ai demandé de nous informer sur l'histoire et l'état de la toute petite communauté qui n'est hélas, pas loin de disparaître puisqu'elle ne compte plus qu'une quarantaine de membres, tous relativement âgés.
Ilya, Juif caraïte, notre guide lors de la visite de la synagogue souterraine à Hasköy
Ilya, un des derniers Juifs caraïtes d'Istanbul, tient un petit magasin qui jouxte l'église Sainte Marie Draperis dans Istiklal Caddesi, la célèbre avenue du quartier européen, le long de laquelle s'égrènent les consulats, les tavernes, les pâtisseries de luxe, non loin du Lycée Galatasaray. C'est Frère Gwénolé qui nous l'a présenté et lui a fait part de notre souhait de visiter la synagogue d'Hasköy où quatre ou cinq Caraïtes se réunissent encore parfois pour la prière, et tiennent à célébrer, jusqu'à la fin, les grandes fêtes, le Nouvel An Juif, Pâques, la Pentecôte. Des amis, Juifs séfarades, viennent parfois les soutenir et compléter l'indispensable miniane19 pour dire la prière communautaire.
C'est la voix chargée de tristesse qu'Ilya nous parle de ce qu'il appelle « la fin ». Ses parents sont francophones, son père a étudié au Lycée Saint-Benoît, sa mère au Lycée Notre-Dame de Sion. Lui, il est allé deux années à l'Ecole Française, puis il a fait l'école primaire à l'Ecole Juive de Şişli, et le collège dans un établissement turc. Ensuite, il a commencé à travailler avec son père.
En chemin, on demande à Ilya ce qu'il connaît de l'Histoire des Caraïtes à Istanbul. Ils seraient venus de Bagdad il y a 1200 années, à l'époque de l'Empire Byzantin, c'est pourquoi jusqu'à aujourd'hui ils parlent le gréco-caraïte, un grec byzantin mêlé de vocables juifs, vocabulaire de leurs fêtes spécifiques et de leurs particularités culturelles. La plupart des archives ont disparu dans les multiples incendies qui dévastèrent les quartiers d'Istanbul, ce qui explique bon nombre d'incertitudes sur leur histoire ancienne.

Il y avait dans Istanbul douze synagogues caraïtes, l'une à Karaköy, une autre à l'emplacement actuel de Yeni Cami, de l'autre côté du Pont Galata.
La mosquée Yeni Camii fut construite au XVII°s sur l'emplacement d'une synagogue caraïte
Dans le quartier de Hasköy, au bord de la Corne d'Or, où la population dominait largement, il reste cinq synagogues séfarades, ashkénaze, caraïte, dont deux occasionnellement en activité, une école juive transformée en maison de retraite, et le cimetière juif comprenant une section proprement caraïte. Aujourd'hui, l'ensemble de la communauté juive a déserté Hasköy pour d'autres quartiers.
Les Caraïtes représentent un courant du judaïsme tout à fait marginal, qui ne dépend pas du Consistoire. Eu égard à l'orthodoxie juive, ils sont considérés comme des hérétiques, ne respectant pas exactement les mêmes observances.
Nous arrivons à la Synagogue des Enfants de la Torah Ecrite, nom courant des synagogues caraïtes: aucun signe extérieur n'indique un bâtiment juif, mais les hauts murs, comme souvent autour des églises grecques ou arméniennes, sont surmontés de grillages pour en rendre l'accès difficile aux curieux mal intentionnés.

Ilya nous ouvre la porte, coupe le système d'alarme et nous voici dans la cour. La porte principale à deux battants reste fermée, elle est surmontée d'inscriptions en hébreu.
Porte d'entrée côté intérieur – inscriptions en hébreu
A gauche de cette porte, 3 grandes pierres couvertes d'inscriptions, en remerciement aux Juifs caraïtes de Crimée et d'Egypte qui, à deux reprises, aidèrent à reconstruire la synagogue, en grande partie détruite par des incendies.
Puis, Ilya nous montre la vasque de marbre où l'on a immolé un agneau en 1981, alors qu'un groupe de Juifs caraïtes était venu d'Israël, avec un sacrificateur pour accomplir le rite de l'immolation pour la viande cachère, rite légèrement différent de celui des Juifs rabbanites20.
20 Les Juifs rabbanites appartiennent au courant majoritaire du judaïsme, suivent et reconnaissent les enseignements et commentaires des rabbins de la tradition qu'on appelle aussi les Sages d'Israël.

Nous entrons, défaisons nos chaussures à l'entrée et mettons des chaussons. Une entrée vestibule assez large, précède la salle principale au centre de laquelle se dresse la tevah, la chaire d'où l'on fait les lectures, et où se tient la personne qui dirige la prière.

Le sol est recouvert de moquette et de tapis. Des bancs de bois courent le long des murs, comme dans les synagogues antiques. Quelques-uns, mobiles, ont été rajoutés pour les jours, désormais anciens, d'affluence. De larges fenêtres font de cette salle une pièce lumineuse.
Des lustres, des lampes suspendues et des globes encadrent la chaire. Sur le mur du fond, un rideau, appelé en hébreu parokhèt, indique l'emplacement de l'armoire sainte, l'Aron ha-Qodesh, où l'on dépose les rouleaux de la Torah, que l'on vient prendre cérémonieusement avant l'office et avec lesquels on fait une procession autour de la salle et de la tevah.

Armoire sainte recouverte du parokhèt
Ilya nous ouvre l'armoire, elle est vide, par crainte des voleurs. Un rouleau de Torah est non seulement sacré, mais aussi onéreux, et celui de cette synagogue sans doute ancien aussi, on le cache. L'armoire sainte est surmontée d'un médaillon, au centre duquel est inscrit le tétragramme, les quatre consonnes imprononçables du Nom de Dieu. Le tétragramme est aussi inscrit sur la paroi intérieure de l'armoire sainte.
Notre ami nous a réservé une surprise. Il a demandé à Avram et Julien qui sont séfarades de se joindre à nous : ils vont ce matin dire avec lui la prière. Ils se couvrent d'un talit21, d'une kippa22 que les Caraïtes ne portent que lors des offices, et lisent le rituel caraïte de la prière du jeudi matin. Julien me confiera ensuite que ce rituel est différent de celui des autres communautés, et effectivement je regarde le livre de prières : il y est écrit « rituel caraïte ». Si l'agencement d'ensemble est différent, on y retrouve des bénédictions, des prières entremêlées de versets des psaumes et de la Torah. L'office est entrecoupé de passages lus en turc, car la plupart des juifs d'Istanbul ne comprennent pas l'hébreu, ils récitent par coeur, ou lisent une transcription en lettres latines. Chaque fin de partie de la prière, est ponctuée de Amen et de prosternations, front à terre. Les chaussures retirées à l'entrée, les tapis qui couvrent le sol, les prosternations, voici un ensemble de détails qui nous font penser à l'islam, mais ces pratiques s'appuient en fait sur des passages de la Torah, par exemple Exode 3 où Dieu demande à Moïse de retirer ses chaussures devant la théophanie du Buisson ardent, ou le livre de Daniel pour les prosternations.
Nous ne sommes pas dans une grande synagogue avec la voix mélodieuse d'un chantre qui mettrait en valeur chaque subtilité du texte. Nous assistons au quotidien de la prière d'une communauté au bout de sa course, sans ressources, qui tente de survivre jusqu'à ce que les derniers anciens disparaissent. La plupart des hommes ont plus de quatre-vingt ans, Ilya avec sa cinquantaine fait figure de jeunot. Sa femme est séfarade, et leurs enfants vont à la synagogue séfarade, là où ils rencontrent d'autres familles, d'autres enfants, là où la vie continue. Comme il le dit, c'est fini, il n'y a rien à faire.

Beaucoup de Caraïtes se sont mariés avec des juifs étrangers, ont quitté le pays, sont partis en Israël, et ici, leur histoire est en train de rentrer dans les livres, de refermer doucement la porte de la vie. Leur accordera-t-on seulement quelque intérêt sur un panneau de musée ou dans un livre retraçant la vie des juifs à Istanbul ?
Après la visite de la synagogue caraïte, nous nous promenons dans le quartier.
Dans un périmètre réduit, on y trouve les traces de quatre synagogues : la synagogue séfarade Maalem, la synagogue Mayor qui abritait des juifs séfarades de Majorque, transformée en atelier, qui fut ouverte en 2010 à l'occasion des célébrations d'Istanbul ville européenne comme lieu d'exposition, et dont il est question de faire un centre culturel ; enfin la synagogue Eshger, au bord de la Corne d'Or, transformée depuis 2001 en café.
C'est là que nous faisons halte autour d'un thé et que je présente à mes très patients et curieux auditeurs une petite histoire des Juifs caraïtes mettant en lumière leurs principaux centres (Israël, la Crimée, Byzance, l'Egypte), les spécificités de leur doctrine et de leurs rites, en comparaison au judaïsme rabbinique. Cette histoire nous révèle un aspect peu connu du monde juif, les polémiques virulentes qui le traversèrent, les paradoxes d'une communauté qui alla parfois jusqu'à 'oublier' son identité juive pour survivre, comme dans l'Empire russe au 19ème siècle, où les Caraïtes démontrèrent qu'ils étaient originaires de Crimée, descendants de tribus tatares, et sans lien aucun avec les Juifs. Cette stratégie, élaborée par Abraham Firkovitch, leur permit de se distinguer et d'échapper aux pogroms et taxes diverses qui écrasaient alors la population juive de cette partie du monde ; selon le même raisonnement, ils furent épargnés par les persécutions nazies.
Quant à leur arrivée en Israël, elle ne se fit pas non plus sans remous. Si les sionistes les accueillirent sans restriction, le Grand Rabbinat fit d'abord opposition à leur venue, eu égard à certaines différences doctrinales. Une attitude plus bienveillante se fit peu à peu jour, même s'ils ne sont toujours pas officiellement reconnus comme Juifs par le Grand Rabbinat. Cela étant, ils trouvèrent leur place en Israël, la communauté actuelle se monte à environ 20 000 personnes.

Les Juifs Ashkénazes
Depuis le XIV° et au fil des siècles arrivèrent aussi d’Europe centrale des Ashkénazes : venus de Pologne, de Lituanie, d’Allemagne, au gré des pogroms et autres difficultés. A Istanbul on les appelait les Allemands. Leurs relations avec les autres communautés juives étant parfois houleuses, les Ottomans les placèrent sous la protection de l’Autriche-Hongrie, ce qui évita leur assimilation sous la vague déferlante des Sépharades. Ils parlaient yiddish. La communauté Ashkénaze se développa autour du monastère Saint Georges et de la Tour Galata.
La Galip Dede Caddesi, l'Avenue de Dede Galip, où se trouvent tous les magasins de musique et le Tekke des derviches tourneurs, est l’ancienne rue juive ashkénaze ; la synagogue ashkénaze

Au XIX° siècle, le quartier Galata était devenu surpeuplé et beaucoup partirent vers les villages de Kuzguncuk ou d'Ortaköy. Cette population ashkénaze était majoritairement pauvre, soutenue économiquement par les autres communautés, minoritaires parmi les minoritaires.
A noter que pendant la Seconde Guerre Mondiale, une quarantaine d’intellectuels allemands juifs fuyant le nazisme furent invités en 1933 par Atatürk pour enseigner dans les universités turques où ils furent grandement appréciés.
Par ailleurs, les Juifs n'oublieront pas les gestes de protection remarquables pendant la Seconde Guerre mondiale des consuls turcs en Europe qui accordèrent des passeports et organisèrent des trains pour amener les Juifs turcs en Turquie. M.Necdet Kent, consul à Marseille, et son adjoint montèrent avec les Juifs dans un wagon à bestiaux, obligeant ainsi les Allemands à libérer les ressortissants turcs. La Turquie, également pays de transit pour beaucoup de Juifs dans cette période, fut à nouveau un pays refuge pour beaucoup de Juifs.
Les Sépharades
L'année 1492 sonna le glas de la présence juive en Espagne, et en 1497 c'est le Portugal qui expulsa ses Juifs. Cette expulsion fut commandée par les souverains très catholiques, Isabelle et Ferdinand. La Reconquête sur l’occupation musulmane était achevée et la volonté de purification du pays, de la race espagnole catholique était à l’ordre du jour.
Cette expulsion mettait un terme à ce qu'on appela rétrospectivement l'« âge d’or » de l’Espagne médiévale sous la houlette des Musulmans, période globalement heureuse d’une coexistence pacifique entre les trois religions du Livre, période d’intense production scientifique, littéraire et artistique,

pendant laquelle les Juifs écrivirent en arabe aussi bien qu’en hébreu, et furent les passeurs de bien des oeuvres classiques vers l’Europe chrétienne comme celles d'Aristote ou d'Avicenne. L'expulsion de 1492 prit aux yeux des Juifs la dimension d’une catastrophe apocalyptique et fut d’ailleurs à l’origine de leurs attentes messianiques dans les siècles qui suivirent. La brutalité de cette expulsion (les chiffres dans les textes, sans doute exagérés, évoquent 400 000 personnes obligées de se convertir ou de fuir l’Espagne), le contraste avec la forte intégration de la communauté juive dans la péninsule ibérique, l’importance numérique de cette communauté, tout cela concourut à faire de cette expulsion une tragédie mise en parallèle avec la destruction des deux premiers Temples de Jérusalem. L’Angleterre ayant elle-même expulsé ses juifs en 1291 et la France en 1394, les destinations des exilés furent la Hollande, l’Italie, l’Afrique du Nord et bien sûr pour beaucoup (environ 150 000) le vaste Empire ottoman qui les accueillit à bras ouverts. Le sultan d’alors, Bajazet II envoya même des bateaux pour les amener dans l’Empire. Les Juifs seront toujours, jusqu’à ce jour, infiniment reconnaissants aux Ottomans, puis aux Turcs de cette si généreuse hospitalité.
La communauté sépharade connut donc un décentrage géographique, passant de l'Europe aux portes de l'Asie.
Pourquoi les Ottomans furent-ils, au XV°siècle, si favorables à l'accueil des Sépharades, les Juifs de la Péninsule ibérique? La prise de Constantinople était encore toute récente, les Grecs avaient fui la ville qu’il fallait repeupler: on commença par déplacer des communautés, par exemple la communauté juive de Salonique ou d’Andrinople (Edirne) vers Istanbul. Puis les Sépharades arrivèrent en deux vagues à la fin du XV° siècle. Ils s'installèrent dans les villages de Balat et de Hasköy.
Les plus fortunés, ceux qui travaillaient dans les banques, le grand commerce international, en relation avec les étrangers qui vivaient à Pera, s’installèrent au XIX° siècle à Galata. A leur arrivée, fin XV°, le sultan diminua leurs impôts un certain temps, encourageant leur installation. Les sources juives rapportent un mot du sultan Bajazet II qui résume le bon arrangement tant pour les Ottomans que pour les Sépharades et qui souligne les fortes attentes des Juifs « Pouvez-vous appeler sage et intelligent un tel souverain23 qui appauvrit son pays et enrichit le mien ? ».

Les Sépharades allaient rapidement dominer les autres communautés, pas seulement par le nombre. Contrairement à la règle d’usage dans la diaspora juive, ils refusèrent d’adopter la loi religieuse, les us et coutumes des juifs locaux et s’attachèrent à conserver leurs traditions. Conscients de la richesse de leur culture, de leur liturgie, ils assimilèrent progressivement les Romaniotes.

C'était une communauté très dynamique qui apportait des capitaux, un savoir faire et des connaissances, qui avait de nombreux contacts en Europe : ils brillèrent au XVI° et XVII° siècles, même s’ils avaient, comme tous les non Musulmans, le statut de dhimmis24, qui marquait clairement leur infériorité sociale par rapport aux Musulmans. La communauté négociait avec les autorités la construction de synagogues, la fondation de cimetières. Le système ottoman laissait à chaque communauté religieuse l’autonomie de ses affaires internes (mariages, conflits, jugements, écoles,

hôpital,...). Les responsables de la communauté étaient les interlocuteurs du pouvoir ottoman et se chargeaient par exemple de collecter les divers impôts.
Le XVIII° siècle marqua la fin de l'expansion de l’Empire Ottoman. Le judaïsme turc entra lui aussi dans sa phase de déclin, la communauté juive commença à rencontrer des difficultés : la rivalité avec les autres minorités, arménienne et surtout grecque, fut féroce, par exemple dans le domaine de la finance.
Le XVIII° siècle fut aussi marqué par l’arrivée des Francos, Juifs d’Italie, aux mœurs très européanisées qui s’assurèrent la protection des consuls étrangers et finirent par se séparer pour constituer la communauté juive italienne ; c'est pourquoi on trouve à Galata une synagogue italienne.

De nouveaux d’axes d’échanges se développèrent pour le commerce international, des emprunts immodérés du sultan aux puissances européennes, une mauvaise gestion de la finance fit peu à peu de l’Empire une semi-colonie. Pour tenter de sortir de la crise, le Pouvoir eut recours à la fiscalité qui devint écrasante.
Puis ce furent les réformes25, la disparition des janissaires auxquels marchands et banquiers juifs étaient très liés, tout le processus d’occidentalisation qui favorisa les communautés chrétiennes aux dépens des Juifs. qui ne bénéficiaient d'aucune protection étrangère, comme c'était le cas des Grecs, Arméniens ou Levantins. A la fin du XVIII° siècle, la condition d'une grande partie de la communauté juive se dégrada fortement: la précarité, l'indigence, le manque d'éducation régnaient. Une majorité de Juifs exerçaient des petits métiers des rues ou demeuraient dans l'oisiveté26.

Le XIX° siècle: droits et éducation
C'est à cette situation que L'Alliance Israélite Universelle avait décidé, comme dans d'autres pays du bassin méditerranéen, de porter remède en ouvrant des écoles et des ateliers d'apprentissage, pour les garçons et pour les filles. Programme de régénération par l'éducation et le travail qui devait amener à une responsabilisation progressive de l'ensemble de la communauté.
L’Alliance Israélite Universelle avait été fondée27 à Paris, alors qu'une ère de liberté et de développement nouveaux s’était ouverte pour les Juifs, suite à la Révolution Française. Les Juifs avaient obtenu l’égalité des droits, la citoyenneté en France, puis dans les pays conquis par Napoléon Bonaparte. L'Alliance Israélite Universelle se donna deux missions : défendre le droit des juifs persécutés dans le monde, et lancer un vaste programme d’éducation en français autour du Bassin méditerranéen. De Paris à Jérusalem, en passant par l’Afrique du Nord des dizaines d’écoles s’ouvrirent qui devaient inculquer les valeurs de liberté, d’égalité, de démocratie, issues du siècle des Lumières et de la Révolution.
Les riches familles comme les Montefiore, les Rotschild ou les Camondo en Turquie firent de la philanthropie, devinrent les relais du projet de l'Alliance Israélite Universelle. Ces philanthropes firent construire des hôpitaux, ouvrir des écoles, soutinrent leur programme éducatif par l'octroi de nombreuses bourses. Ils voulaient sortir les Juifs modestes des communautés orientales de leur ignorance, les éduquer pour leur permettre d’exercer de meilleurs métiers, mieux s’intégrer là où ils vivaient, s'élever socialement. Le modèle dominant était français. Les élèves les plus doués étaient envoyés au moyen de bourses en France et devinrent souvent les enseignants de ces écoles.
Jusqu'alors, c'étaient les rabbins qui enseignaient aux enfants à lire, à écrire en judéo-espagnol, leur langue maternelle, et donnaient des rudiments d’hébreu pour apprendre par coeur les prières communautaires, connaître quelques éléments d'histoire sainte, et respecter les autorités en place dans la communauté. La plupart des Juifs de l’Empire ne parlaient pas le turc. A Istanbul, le judéo-espagnol était la langue courante de la communauté juive. C'était donc une révolution éducative et langagière qui s'engageait.
L’intention était louable de vouloir introduire d’une part le turc, pour que les jeunes fussent plus intégrés dans la société ottomane, et d’autre part une langue étrangère, le français, afin d’ouvrir la communauté à des échanges extérieurs, ce qui fut avec constance un point fort chez les élites de l'histoire juive. Les écoles de l’Alliance scolarisant des enfants des familles modestes, les familles fortunées envoyaient leurs enfants dans les écoles étrangères française, allemande, autrichienne, italienne ou américaine.
Parler français devint un nouveau trait distinctif de l’identité juive sépharade, une attestation de bonne éducation, et le judéo-espagnol se trouva dévalorisé, langue de la rue sans aucun raffinement, pensait-on.
27 L»Alliance Israélite Universelle ou AIU fut fondée en 1860.

L’Alliance Israélite Universelle finit par s’imposer dans toute la Turquie et fut finalement de plus en plus populaire, des centaines d’enfants profitèrent de son enseignement. Pour la première fois, dans les communautés sépharades, les filles allèrent à l’école, ce qui les ouvrit au monde du travail, plus dans les milieux populaires que dans la bourgeoisie où travailler restait mal vu.
Mais ce modèle extérieur d'émancipation à la française ne fut pas accepté unanimement, la société ottomane reposait sur des particularismes ethniques et religieux bien enracinés. Il remettait aussi en question des pouvoirs en place. Ainsi, les rabbins n'accueillirent pas cette ingérence dans la culture traditionnelle locale favorablement : ils perdaient leur influence, leur pouvoir et leur gagne-pain. Par ailleurs, modernité rimait avec laïcisation, rejet du religieux. A Istanbul, Abraham Camondo dut renoncer à gérer l’école que, généreusement, il avait offert à sa communauté ; il finit par être excommunié, et c’est le gouvernement ottoman qui dut intervenir pour apaiser le conflit intracommunautaire28.
La minorité juive avait une place bien particulière dans l'Empire ottoman : d'un côté bien accueillie, toujours reconnaissante envers les Ottomans qui pouvaient compter sur sa fidélité, son soutien indéfectible ; de l'autre côté, la présence de l'Alliance Israélite Universelle à Istanbul ou Izmir ouvrait des perspectives sur un monde moderne, importé d'Europe. Cette présence de l'Alliance fut à la fois une réussite et un échec. Une réussite dans la mesure où elle forma nombre d'élèves et transmit avec efficacité l'amour de la connaissance, en particulier de la langue et de la culture françaises, et ce faisant impulsa la prise de conscience des droits des citoyens dans un monde moderne et démocratique qui reposaient sur les piliers de l'égalité et de la liberté politique. Les valeurs véhiculées par Alliance rencontraient les aspirations de certains notables de la communauté juive, souvent déjà largement occidentalisés et laïcisés. Mais le contexte n'était pas celui de la France, et le projet d'autonomie, de liberté allait progressivement se heurter à de multiples résistances.
Alliancistes et sionistes en conflit29
Nous voyons, à la fin de l'Empire ottoman, un même espoir animer les diverses minorités, chrétiennes ou juives, celui d'intégrer enfin politiquement une nation nouvelle qui se calquerait sur le modèle occidental, par exemple celui de la France dite des Lumières. Un front commun se dessine après la Révolution des Jeunes Turcs, appuyé en 1917 par les 14 points du Président Wilson. Cet espoir fut balayé dès les débuts de la République turque, les minorités comprirent alors que rien ne changerait fondamentalement dans leur situation.
Mais, alors que le monde juif connaissait de son côté aussi, de grands bouleversements, que l'idéologie sioniste se renforçait au fil des années, que Herzel avait pris conscience, lui qui venait de

l'Allemagne où les Juifs étaient sans doute le mieux et le plus assimilé dans la culture et la société du pays, de la nécessité de fonder un Etat juif afin de prévenir les dangers d'un antisémitisme toujours renaissant ou perdurant, et qu'une politique juive internationale se mettait en place, en particulier dans l'Empire ottoman qui comprenait dans son territoire le point central pour les Juifs de Jérusalem, il eut été bien étonnant qu'Istanbul, alors Constantinople, restât à l'écart de toute cette agitation. Une antenne sioniste s'implanta donc à Constantinople, dont la mission était de négocier avec les Ottomans la question de la Palestine. Les sionistes firent propagande dans les quartiers populaires de la communauté, créèrent une association de sport pour la jeunesse, la Makaba. L'Alliance, trop préoccupée de s'allier les élites influentes, dont les cadres résidaient à Paris, bien loin des réalités du terrain à Istanbul, était restée idéologiquement coupée de cette population très modeste qui habitait les quartiers de Hasköy et de Balat chez qui les sionistes faisaient campagne.
A Balat, la mémoire des quartiers populaires (comme le quartier de Karabaş au bord de la Corne d'Or où vivaient les bateliers, les petits vendeurs des rues) s'est effacée. Les dernières maisons précaires ont été rasées pour aménager un espace vert de promenade qui court d'Eyüp à Eminönü. Plus on s'enfonçait dans les quartiers hauts, plus la population était aisée et vivait dans de belles maisons dont il reste quelques exemples30 :

Quelques motifs parmi lesquels des étoiles stylisées :
Pour s'imposer face aux partisans de l'Alliance, les sionistes s'allièrent aux conservateurs religieux. En effet, le projet sioniste tendait à l'émigration en Palestine, soutenait l'étude de l'hébreu, alors que l'Alliance défendait un projet assimilationniste dans lequel les Juifs devaient trouver leur place comme citoyens à part entière dans les divers pays où ils vivaient ; ils devaient en connaître la langue et la culture afin de se hisser socialement à des places dignes et enviables. Les deux projets, sioniste et allianciste, ne concordaient pas, et logiquement les deux partis s'affrontèrent. Pour contrecarrer l'avancée des alliancistes soutenu par des personnalités juives extérieures au pays, les sionistes firent aussi front commun avec le Hilfwerein qui, à Istanbul, tendait à développer un projet similaire à celui de l'Alliance Israélite Universelle, mais en langue allemande, avec le soutien de l'ambassade d'Allemagne.
Si les religieux soutinrent les sionistes, c'était parce-que l'Alliance incarnait à leurs yeux une dangereuse modernité, assimilant religion et obscurantisme, une modernité qui entendait leur arracher le pouvoir, modeler d'une manière nouvelle les jeunes esprits en leur inculquant des valeurs subversives.
La famille Camondo
Les multiples initiatives de la famille Camondo31 et les réactions d'hostilité qu'elles suscitèrent illustrent la férocité de l'affrontement intracommunautaire, exacerbé par les acteurs de l'extérieur, alliancistes ou sionistes.
Les Camondo étaient une des familles très en vue dans la communauté juive du XIX° siècle réussite dans la finance (fondation en 1864 de la Société Générale de l’Empire Ottoman), propriétés immobilières (surtout à Galata et Pera). Ils firent rénover le quartier Galata pour en assurer la sécurité et l'agrément (éclairage, ramassage des chiens errants ...).

La maison Camondo au 6 rue Camondo, en haut de l'escalier Camondo, construit dans le style Art Nouveau où les touristes aiment aujourd'hui se prendre en photo, fut louée à l’Alliance Israélite Universelle qui y installa une école de garçons. Au 8 rue Camondo, la famille ouvrit une maison d’Edition, ha-mizra’h, qui publiait des livres d’études hébraïques.
A la fin des années 1860, les Camondo possédaient aussi l’Alcazar d’Amérique à Pera, des immeubles d’habitations et des magasins, un yalı32 à Yeniköy.
On a souvent dit des Camondo qu'ils étaient les Rotschild de l’Est : par leur fortune, leur influence, leurs multiples actions de bienfaisance au sein de la communauté, les bonnes relations qu'ils entretenaient avec le pouvoir. Ainsi, Abraham-Salomon créa deux maisons de refuge, des fonds de secours, fit construire une synagogue à Büyükdere, finança la construction d’une école et d’une synagogue sur Rhodes, la réimpression du Me’am Loez. En 1870, Abraham-Salomon créa un séminaire, la Yechiva Maguen Abraham, à Hasköy. Il demanda qu’après sa mort, on y récita des prières pour le repos de son âme.
Alfred de Rotschild soutenait l'action des Camondo de toute son influence, qui était grande, et souhaitait qu'Abraham-Salomon et les « Francos » fussent responsables des affaires juives d’Istanbul afin de propager l'esprit des Lumières, d'ouvrir une communauté qui jusqu'alors restait encore très repliée sur elle-même.
La scission de la communauté juive s'aggrava, modernistes contre rabbins traditionalistes. L’école de Hasköy et les Camondo devinrent leur cible. Le rabbin Akresh excommunia Abraham-Salomon Camondo. Il fit irruption dans son yalı où le vizir était en visite et fut arrêté. S'ensuivirent des nominations et des destitutions de grands rabbins.
Les Camondo, fatigués, se retirèrent du consistoire. La Sublime Porte ratifia la victoire du parti traditionnel, interdit aux corporations juives de prendre pour dirigeant un sujet étranger. Les Camondo créèrent une nouvelle communauté, la Comunita israelitica-italiana di Istanbul, en 1862.

Alors que les Sépharades avaient au XV° siècle apporté avec eux leur modernité, ils se coupèrent peu à peu de l’Europe, apprirent à évoluer dans les structures de l’empire ottoman mais s’adaptèrent difficilement aux nouvelles conditions du marché (chemins de fer, produits manufacturés ...). La modernisation leur revint comme une force extérieure qui les contraignit violemment, déchirant les communautés.
La République turque: incertitudes pour les minorités
Au début du XX°siècle, alors que l'Empire ottoman s'acheminait bien malgré lui vers une évolution politique qui allait passer par la prise de pouvoir des Jeunes Turcs (1908) et le renvoi du sultan, puis vers la République turque fondée par Mustafa Kemal Atatürk en 1923, les minorités vécurent des temps d'incertitudes, de remise en question et bien évidemment s'accentuèrent les luttes de pouvoir internes.
A l’avènement de la République turque, les citoyens, selon la constitution devinrent théoriquement tous égaux, sans distinction de race ni de religion. Dans la réalité, les discriminations demeurèrent : les minorités perdirent les avantages de leur autonomie passée et ne gagnèrent rien en échange. Elles furent sommées d'accélérer le processus de 'turquification' déjà amorcé dans les années 1880 sous le sultan Abdül Hamîd II. Tous les sujets, puis citoyens turcs sous la République à partir de 1923, devaient entrer dans le moule national turc. Dans les années 20 et 30, un slogan fameux fut « Citoyen, parle turc ! ». Qui parlait dans la rue une autre langue était facilement agressé, humilié. Les écoles de l’Alliance furent fermées, l’école turque devint obligatoire. Dans les écoles des minorités et les écoles étrangères, la présence d'un directeur turc, l'apprentissage de la langue turque, les cours d'histoire de la République turque étaient désormais obligatoires. Les minorités étaient tolérées mais, parce qu'ethniquement non turques, leur présence ne pesait d'aucun poids dans l'espace politique, elles étaient ignorées. On encouragea autant qu’on le put le départ des minorités, on les renvoya des administrations ... enfin le rêve d’émancipation s’enfuit et la juste place devint pour ces minorités difficile à trouver. Mais les Ottomans avaient si généreusement accueilli les Juifs au XV° siècle, que toute contestation ne pouvait être interprétée que comme une marque d’ingratitude inacceptable, d’ailleurs les Juifs eux-mêmes avaient intériorisé le message et, jusqu'à aujourd'hui, la majorité n’a jamais le moindre discours critique sur la politique turque à leur égard. Ils expriment à chaque occasion leur gratitude envers un Etat qui fut, historiquement, plus bienveillant que les Etats européens ou les pays arabes. Quand des difficultés surgissent, ils les règlent en négociant en privé, au cas par cas, sans essayer d’améliorer leur statut. Ils ont bien compris qu'un dialogue sur des bases égalitaires n’est pas de mise avec la République turque, ils la prennent comme elle est, la quittent ou la supportent. En 1927 il y avait 81 872 juifs en Turquie. En 1935, 24% travaillaient dans le commerce, 20% dans l’industrie et l’artisanat, 4,4% dans les services, 46% étaient sans profession connue et vivaient d’expédients.
A partir de 1949, une large partie de la communauté (environ 40%) partit vivre en Israël, ceux qui n’avaient pu trouver une situation leur permettant de survivre dignement, les plus pauvres. Resta une classe moyenne et supérieure.

Les Juifs sabbatéens
Ce sont les disciples de Sabbataï Tsevi, faux-messie juif qui au XVII°siècle, après les terribles massacres de Bogfan Khmielnitski en Pologne et en Ukraine, rassembla autour de lui des Juifs de tous pays qui quittèrent tout pour le suivre jusqu'à Izmir. A Istanbul, il prêcha dans la Synagogue Ahrida, dans le quartier de Balat. Alors que ses prédications et son charisme commençaient à être cause de troubles dans la ville, la Sublime Porte somma Sabbataï Tsevi de se convertir, faute de quoi, il serait décapité. Il se convertit donc à l'islam suivi de nombreux disciples.
Les Sabbatéens sont environ 2 millions. Ils sont musulmans puisque leur « messie » s'est converti à l'islam. On les appelle en Turquie des dönme ou apostats ; certains se considèrent comme des crypto-juifs, d'autres musulmans à part entière, selon tout l'éventail des possibilités. Tous restent méfiants à leur égard. Les Musulmans refusent de leur donner leurs filles en mariage, traitent difficilement affaire avec eux, les laissent à l'écart. Ils ont leur mosquée,Teşvikiye Camii, à Şişli, un cimetière à Feriköy et un autre sur la rive asiatique à Üsküdar ; sur leurs tombes on trouve des symboles cabbalistiques Yakin et Boaz, les noms de deux colonnes du Temple de Jérusalem. Ils n'ont pas une pratique religieuse développée. Récemment, l'un d'eux a demandé au Grand Rabbinat à redevenir juif, cela lui a été refusé ; il a alors déposé une demande auprès des tribunaux turcs qui ont reconnu son droit à être juif.
Les Juifs Loubavitch
Depuis 5 ou 6 ans, on note aussi la présence de Juifs Loubavitch, à qui on a cédé pour officier la synagogue Ashkénaze de Galata. Ils ne font pas partie du conseil religieux mais ont des liens avec la communauté juive. Le rabbin Loubavitch a acheté une grande maison sur Büyük Ada, avec piscine, où il accueille des enfants en été. Prosélytisme habituel qui commence à poser de petits problèmes, par

exemple quand les enfants de retour d'un séjour chez lui refusent le manger le plat turc traditionnel de viande au yaourt.
Conclusion
Comme bien des gouvernements, les Ottomans n’ont été ni bons, ni méchants : ils ont accueilli les Juifs à un moment où cette émigration « choisie » leur était profitable, et la République turque qui leur succéda les discrimina sans état d’âme dans le cadre d’une politique nationaliste dure et intolérante estimée nécessaire pour construire un sentiment d'identité et d'unité nationale qui n'allait pas de soi dans l'histoire bouleversée de la fin de l'Empire ottoman, de sa réorganisation politique mais aussi géographique en un Etat moderne et républicain.
L’image d’une grande amitié entre les Juifs et les Turcs est une carte de visite internationale qui contrebalance l’image le plus souvent très négative que ce pays a à l’étranger. Beaucoup de Juifs turcs mettent en avant cette coexistence pacifique et harmonieuse, comme le Président de la fondation du cinq-centenaire, Monsieur Naïm Güleryüz qui veut faire connaître l'esprit de tolérance des Turcs, symbolisé par une « forêt de tolérance » plantée sur les rives du Bosphore à la fin des années 1990.
Mais on ne peut taire que, comme les autres minorités, les Juifs vivent aujourd'hui dans la crainte. La rhétorique anti-israélienne, les campagnes de presse, les manifestations où l’on voit des groupuscules nationalistes brandir des pancartes « Entrée libre aux chiens. Interdit aux Juifs et aux Arméniens. », travaillent les esprits et développent un très réel antisémitisme. Après les incidents diplomatiques créés entre Israël et la Turquie en 2009 par l'envoi d'un bateau turc avec des vivres (mais aussi des armes) pour forcer le blocus de Gaza, le Maviyolculu, les Juifs, pris à partie en Turquie, adressèrent au Premier Ministre Erdoğan une déclaration dont voici un extrait « Vivant dans ce pays depuis des siècles, nous sommes des citoyens égaux et à ce titre nous remplissons nos obligations, nous parlons et nous pensons en turc, la culture turque nous a modelés ... Nous, les Juifs turcs, nous sommes une partie inséparable de la République turque ... Nous savons que les dirigeants de notre pays, les intellectuels ainsi que les gens emplis de bon sens sont attentifs à nos inquiétudes ... » Cette citation exprime clairement l'angoisse des Juifs qui sentent bien qu'on ne reconnaît pas, malgré les déclarations de convenance, la légitimité de leur pleine et entière place dans la République turque. Leyla Navaro, psychologue et enseignante à l'université du Bosphore pose la question : « Est-ce que je suis toujours redevable, matériellement et moralement, du fait que le sultan ottoman ait accueilli mes ancêtres ? Est-ce que je suis toujours considérée comme une invitée sur ces terres où je suis née et où j'ai grandi, où je remplis mes devoirs en tant que citoyenne, et au développement desquelles je contribue de facto. Dois-je continuer à être soumise ? Suis-je obligée de vivre dans la menace ? Dois-je accepter cette situation ? »33
Le moindre événement en Israël (par exemple l'assassinat d'un jeune Palestinien par un Juif et les bombardements sur Gaza pendant l'été 2014) entraîne à Istanbul des manifestations anti-israéliennes

devant le consulat d'Israël. Les personnes de la communauté sentent cette hostilité grandissante. Les nationalistes comme les islamistes les rejettent et tentent de les stigmatiser comme citoyens traîtres. Comme partout dans le monde, sauf aujourd'hui en Israël, la présence juive reste fragile, avec le paradoxe d'être une communauté historique ancestrale très enracinée dans la culture locale et toujours « invitée », considérée avec méfiance par la population dominante. La forte diminution de sa population à Istanbul fait tendre un peu plus vers l'uniformisation un monde qui aurait pourtant besoin de cultiver sa diversité, ses altérités, de se poser la question du comment vivre ensemble plutôt que de recherche une fantasmatique pureté nationale, ethnique ou religieuse. Mais ceci ouvrirait un autre débat.

The author presents the Jewish population of Istanbul since Byzantinum to the Republic of Turkey, succintly retracing the historical evolution of Karaite, Sephardi and Ashkenazi Jews, and the relationship amongst them and between the Muslim Turks, both Ottoman and Republican. The article draws its inspiration from twelve years of working in Istanbul, studying Hebrew and Judeo-Spanish, the Jewish religion and its History. The author's official participation as a member of the inter-religious committee of Istanbul has proffered her many opportunities to meet representatives of the Jewish community and discuss with them the cultural and religious divergences and convergences either between Christians or Muslims.

To retrace this long and fruitful History, the author interviews and cites Mister Ilya Abrahamoğlu, the youngest of the remaining forty Karaite Jews of Istanbul, who recounts the settling of his ancestors from Bagdad some 1,200 years ago, or those migrating from the Crimea in the IX° century, whose language was Greek. Mister Abrahamoğlu laments the fact that the majority of the Karaite Jews immigrated to Israel or to the United States, and that only one Karaite synagogue remains open today for ceremony in the district of Hasköy.
To retrace the History of the Sephardi Jews, the author interviews and cites one of the more eminent historians of the Istanbulite Jewish community, Mr. Naïm Güleryüz, who by recalling his own family story, recalls that History of the Sephardi Jews expulsed from mediaeval Spain in 1492, and welcomed warmly by Sultan Bejazet.
Mister Abrahamoğlu and Mister Güleryüz resume the immigration of the Ashkenazi Jews from Central Europe and Germany in the XIV° century, they who spoke Yiddish and built their first synagogues near the Tower of Galata, together with the Jews immigrating from Italy, the Francos, who also settled at Galata during the XVIII° century.
This being said, the author concentrates most of her experience on the Sephardi community, it being the largest and by far the most culturally active in Turkey. Their language, the Judeo-Spanish, is exposed as well as their literature. A language spoken by the mediaeval Jewish-Spanish community upon their arrival to Istanbul until the founding of the Universal Israelite Alliance in the XIX° century which discouraged many Judeo-Spanish speakers to continue speaking the language of their ancestors, and adopt the language of the 'cultivated' European, French ! Hence, the Sephardi Jew spoke Turkish, the language of their country, and French, the language of the educated European. Many Sephardi Jews, because they spoke both Turkish and French, established diplomatic, commercial, cultural and religious ties with France.
The author also points out that certain wealthy families of the Sephardi Jewish community of Istanbul, such as the Camondos, were solicited by the Universal Israelite Alliance to help finance schools, banks and many philanthropic projects for the Jewish community. Thanks to these opulent and distinguished families, the educational, economic and cultural bonds between Istanbul and France grew stronger.
The densely populated districts of Istanbul by the Sephardi Jews such as Balat and Hasköy, little by little emptied of their inhabitants principally because of the devastating fires, but also due to the Muslim migrants from the Balkans or from Anatolia, and to a lesser extent because of those cultural bonds between Turkish Jews and France, which caused many educated Jews either to immigrate to France or to better districts of Istanbul like Ettiler or Ulus. Today there are no longer any Jews living in Balat or in Hasköy, the ancestral homeland of the first Sephardi Jews from Spain...
During the Second World War, although the Jews were indeed protected under the laws of the Republic from Nazi anti-semitism, they did, however, suffer under the 'varlık vergisi' ; the 'wealth tax',

which drove many Jews to sell their homes in Balat and in Hasköy and to move to other areas of Istanbul. With the founding of Israel in 1948, forty percent, or 81,872 Jews from Istanbul and Izmir immigrated to Israel. There are presently fifteen thousand Jews living in Istanbul and Izmir, perfectly integrated in the Turkish social tissue.
This being said, the Jews of Turkey today are merely 'tolerated' by the Turkish government, and often anti-Israelian journalistic rhetoric assimilates them with the Jews of Israel, and thus associates the Turkish Jew with the on-going conflict against the Palestinians. This assimilating journalistic and political rhetoric stigmatizes the Turkish Jew as a defender of Israel, and hence an enemy of the Muslims. It goes without saying that the Turkish Jew treats this stigmatization as a political and religious interloper, alien to his or her commitment to Turkey as a Turkish citizen...
The 2009 incident between Israel and Turkey when the Turkish relief ship, the Maviyolculu, was boarded and taken by Israelian paratroopers, is a perfect example of the deepening mistrust between Turkish Muslim and Jew ; newspaper articles in Turkey lashed out at the Jewish population of Turkey as if they had been directly responsible for Israelian military intervention. It is in light of these sad and oversimplified events that the Jews of Turkey ask themselves the same question over and over again : are we full Turkish citizens or simply the same foreigners 'invited' by Sultan Bajazet ? Should we still feel indebted to the 1492 Sultan of the Ottoman Empire although we have lived and thrived in Turkey for centuries, and today, according to our identity cards, are citizens of a Republic ? These existential questions in fact reflect a much deeper ontological discrepancy between Turkish Muslim and Jew, whose long-century relationship seems not to have evolved beyond the invited foreign from an intolerant Spain ; beyond the status of the 'tolerated'...
The article posits thus a dialectics of the ups and downs of this five-hundred year relationship between Turkish Jew and Muslim...

MIRABILE, Paul
Enquête sur les Peuples Naxis dans le Sud-Ouest de la Chine
L'Archaïque et le Moderne
Hommage à Joseph Rock
Introduction
L'écriture des peuples naxis, la dernière écriture pictographique en usage dans le monde, quoique circonscrite aux 300.000 sujets-parlants,1 est l'une des écritures que j'examinais lors de mes cinq ans en Chine dans les années 1990. Une écriture dont les sons restaient pour moi muets, vu que je ne connaissais aucun locuteur dans la région du Yunnan. Une écriture muette, certes, mais dont l'éclat des formes pictographiques parlait d'une manière éloquente! Et puisque mon travail s'attache essentiellement aux formes: langues, architecture, poétique, cette petite plongée dans l'écriture naxie m'emplit d'une joie sans borne, d'une passion philologique silencieuse mais captivante par tant de splendeur et de fougue de ses formes 'pictoresques'?
Ma femme Françoise et moi, nous promenions dans le Dongba Culture Museum à Lijiang dans la région Sud-ouest de la Chine où demeurent la plupart des 58 minorités ethniques de la République de Chine : Yi, Bai, Dai, Naxi, chacune pratiquant sa langue, voire son écriture, surtout les Dai dans la région autonome de Xishuangbanna. En visite dans ce petit musée, j'aperçus derrière une vitrine un numéro du National Geographic, daté de 1924, ouvert aux pages d'un article rédigé par un certain Joseph Rock, et qui parlait des us et coutumes des peuples naxis de la Chine. Evidemment, l'accès de cet objet de musée, m'était interdit, ses pages, donc intouchables...
Deux mois plus tard, dans la petite ville sympathique de Dalien, toujours dans la même région du Yunnan, non loin des villages naxis, un libraire, connaisseur de publications sur les langues et les peuples de la Chine, me sortit le numéro que je cherchais, XLVI, N° 5 novembre, 1924, comme un magicien sort un lapin de son chapeau melon ! Hélas, malgré notre relation amicale, il m'interdit de photocopier l'article en question car ce numéro était ancien, et d'une certaine valeur, il craignait que la photocopieuse brisât la tranche du mensuel. Déçu, mais comprenant son appréhension, j'abandonnai la quête de ce numéro récalcitrant...
1 Certains ethnologues chinois mettent le chiffre à 260.000.

Dix ans s'écoulèrent. Un jour chez Dominique, propriétaire de la librairie Ulysses sur l'île Saint Louis à Paris, je le vis monter l'escalier de sa réserve, là où il avait pioché l'introuvable revue, qu'il me tendit pour faire une photocopie de l'article recherché...
Muni donc de l'article de Joseph Rock, de mes deux années d'études des pictographes naxis en Chine, j'étais prêt à faire à nouveau le saut dans ce monde lointain des Naxis, monde en déclin certes, mais refusant de se laisser effacer par les prétendus décideurs de l'Histoire moderne.
Pour procéder textuellement, je traduisis l'article de l'Américain Joseph Rock. cette traduction apparaît en caractères gras, alors que mes propres commentaires et recherches qui émaillent l'article demeurent en caractères Times afin de créer un mouvement entre le passé de Rock et le présent de mon commentaire; un mouvement parallèle à plusieurs voix, celles de Rock et la mienne, cette dernière appuyée par tant d'autres voix des chercheurs contemporains, suivant un mouvement polyphonique, de parole errante dans le Temps et l'Espace sous deux formes distinctes -gras et Times-, complémentaires dans l'écoulement lent et sûr depuis leur source commune : l'amour des langues...des formes...des hommes; bref, de la Sagesse et de la Philologie...

Le Bannissement du Diable, de la Maladie parmi les Naxis
Cérémonies insolites exécutées par une tribu aborigène au cœur de la Province du Yunnan, Chine
Au milieu des profondes gorges et pentes des chaînes enneigées qui atteignent une altitude de plus de 20,000 pieds, à l'entrée occidentale de la Chine et du Tibet, habite une tribu aborigène appelée Moso par les Chinois. Très isolés de l'influence de la civilisation du Nord et orientale chinoise, les Mosos ont vécu écartés, retranchés du reste du monde, n'entrant en contact avec aucune tribu antérieure, hormis peut-être les Tibétains.
Alors que les premiers avaient adopté le bouddhisme, ce qui a dégénéré en démonolâtrie, les Mosos ou les Nashis, ainsi s'appellent-ils, ont maintenu leur religion aborigène de sorcellerie, laquelle, sans doute, avait dû prédominer au Tibet, avant qu'elle fût repoussée par la puissance ecclésiale lamiste. Les Nashis, tels que, désormais, nous les nommerons à présent, une tribu en déclin de la famille tibéto-birmane, étaient il y a maints siècles un peuple puissant, dont le roi siégeait dans sa capitale à Yigku, aujourd'hui la ville préfectorale de Likiang, dans la province chinoise du Yunnan.
2 Il va sans dire que je ne reproduis pas les photos prises par Joseph Rock, ni les légendes qui accompagnent celles-ci. Nous maintenons l'orthographe des toponymes et des onomastiques de Rock dans notre traduction. En revanche, notre ponctuation ne suit pas celle du texte original.

Tout comme les châteaux étaient les forteresses des clans chevaleresques du Moyen Age en Europe, ainsi pourrions-nous considérer la grande chaîne enneigée au centre du royaume naxi, berceau et point de ralliement d'une tribu en voie de disparition. Comme un dragon, cette vaste chaîne, percée par le Yangtze comme par l'épée d'un géant, s'étend vers les frontières du Sichuan, couronnée par trois sommets dont les tourelles ne connaissent que les neiges hivernales sur les flancs, et sur les plaines miniatures -jadis des lacs de glace- sont éparpillés les hameaux des Naxis, qui vivent heureux comme à l'époque de pierre, car le silex et l'édelweiss, utilisés comme bois à brûler, font office d'allumettes, de même que la torche à pin sert de lampe.
Les premières observations de Joseph Rock nous plongent dans un monde archaïque, primordiale, où la puissante Nature assujettit ces peuples miniaturisés. Sa description nous projette également dans la fascination d'un monde très différent du sien, les Etats-Unis, mais aussi Européen viennois, d'une famille bourgeoise, fréquentant l'opéra et le théâtre! Entre Vienne, l'Amérique et le milieu féerique d'une Nature gigantesque et d'un peuple primitif, la distance dans le Temps et l'Espace s'est rétréci pour Rock d'une manière si accélérée qu'il lui fallut 24 ans de vécu chez les Naxis pour s'accommoder à ce rétrécissement et en glaner les fruits. Dépasser la fascination des fulgurations archaïques ou l'émerveillement envoûtant signifie sortir de soi-même pour rencontrer l'Autre ; un processus long et parfois douloureux qui pourrait s'éterniser, voire n'aboutir jamais...Loin des forces conquérantes du progrès, sans allumettes ni électricité, Rock s'accommode et se met sinon à aimer ce peuple, du moins à le regarder, l'apprécier, l'estimer pour ce qu'il est...
J'ai séjourné à deux reprises dans la même région entre les années 1997 et 2000. Il va sans dire que ces peuples naxis ont 'profité' du progrès matérialiste du communisme de Mao Zedong avec tant de bonds en avant et périodes de cent fleurs vers le Grand Eveil, puis avec la poussée du marché libre dans la Chine Moderne, aujourd'hui première puissance productrice du monde. Ainsi, notre aperçu des peuples naxis, à cause ou grâce à cette évolution politique et économique, s'est réduit soit à une curiosité linguistique pour sa langue écrite, soit à celle folklorique du voyeur, ébahi devant les spectacles organisés pour touristes chinois ou étrangers. Les musées des 'arts traditionnels' pré-communistes qui amoindrissent les Naxis à un petit peuple sympathique, 'traditionnel', mais tout de même moderne grâce aux efforts de la Chine pour sortir tout le monde des affres du féodalisme, les exposent à la lumière scientifique de la Chine moderne salvatrice, communiste ou capitaliste. Il ne s'agit nullement d'un peuple surveillé; mais d'un peuple orienté dans le choix de la représentation qu'ils donnent de leur culture à travers le prisme, à présent, chinois. Cela étant dit, ce prisme compte parmi les plus transparents des minorités en Chine aujourd'hui avec son Association d'Artistes folkloriques du Yunnan, avec ses musées et instituts de recherche, avec ses équipes de chercheurs, tant naxis que chinoises, sur l'écriture et la culture dongba à Lijiang, sans oublier les départements de langues universitaires à Shanghai, Kunming et Beijing où l'étude de la langue et de l'écriture naxie sont proposées. Bref, depuis 70 ans, c'est-à-dire depuis le séjour de Joseph Rock en Chine dans les années 1920, 30 et 40, l'évolution du peuple naxi a semblé suivre une pente tant ascendante que descendante: objet d'étude scientifique de son écriture, objet de spectacle folklorique de son peuple! Ce destin s'avère celui de la majorité des minorités qui vivent en Chine. Ceci étant dit, ces peuples exposés aux microscopes et aux regards curieux des touristes

ont échappé à tout génocide ou anéantissement, contrairement à d'autres peuples qui se trouvaient sur les sols des régimes moins scientifiques, moins matérialistes...
Les Naxis apparurent pour la première foi en 796 après Christ
Peuple uniquement agricole, les Naxis vivent une existence précaire, de jour à jour. Leur existence est attestée pour la première fois dans les annales de la dynastie Tang, autour de 796 après Christ, mais des références imprécises ont été faites dans les livres chinois du XVI° siècle avant notre ère d'une tribu qui apparut sur la frontière occidentale de la Chine, appelée Nung, Jung ou Njung. Aujourd'hui les Tibétains appellent les Naxis, le Djong ou le Djung, ce qui signifie vulgaire, grossier, impoli, probablement un reste du nom général, représenté aussi dans le nom Nu ou Nung des Lutzu, qui habitent dans la Gorge Salwin, juste au sud de la frontière du Tibet.
Les Naxis furent assujettis pour la première fois en 778 après notre ère; ils regagnèrent leur indépendance un siècle plus tard, mais la perdirent aux mains des hordes de Kublai Khan en 1253.
Les princes mongols régnèrent dans le Yunnan de père en fils, bien longtemps après avoir été repoussés du reste de la Chine. Ils furent finalement refoulés par les Ming, le dernier prince mongol mettant fin à sa vie en 1381.
Au fond du village de Ngulukö, se dresse un mur en pierre à chaux sur lequel est inscrite la date d'arrivée des Chinois à Likiang et dans le royaume des Naxis, sous le dernier roi indigène, Mu en larges caractères chinois. La date 1724 s'avère la deuxième année du règne de l'Empereur Yungcheng de la dynastie Manchu.
Tout Naxi vrai se nomme Ho ou Mu
Tout vrai Naxi est nommé Ho ou Mu, mais par intermariage plusieurs Naxis possèdent le nom de famille Lee ou Chou, qui sont d'origine minchine, une tribu qui habite dans le sud.
Aujourd'hui non-violents, mais jadis de grands guerriers, habiles à l'arbalète, qu'ils utilisent toujours; craints par les Tibétains dont ils envahirent le territoire; les Naxis sont devenus un peuple indolent. Ce constant n'est pas applicable aux femmes, cependant; c'est elles qui font tout le travail.
L'opium a trouvé son chemin parmi les Naxis, et s'ils ne sont pas des fumeurs invétérés comme les Chinois, le pavot est cultivé comme source de revenus si les percepteurs chinois leur en laissent quelque jouissance.

A Ngulukö, charmant village presqu' excessivement propre, situé sur les pentes de la grand chaîne enneigée de Likiang, avec le Mont Satseto comme protecteur gardien, se trouve le siège de la Société National Geographic, qui a organisé l'Expédition dans la Province du Yunnan. Pendant deux ans de contacts intimes avec les Naxis, je gagnais leur confidence en traitant leurs indispositions simples, réelles ou imaginaires; pour les troubles plus graves, ils faisaient toujours appel à leurs prêtres, connus sous le nom de Tong-ba ou Tomba, les sorciers chamanes, qui maintiennent que les esprits maléfiques impurs, qui choisissent un homme ou une bête comme demeure, provoquent la maladie du corps.
Le Tong-ba ou Tomba dont parle Joseph Rock sont les prêtres chamanes naxis: Les Dongbas. Selon Ge Agan, 'dongba' dans la langue naxie signifie « l'écriture-chanteur dans un village de montagne »3 Ce sont des sages, détenteurs de l'écriture des pictogrammes, prêtres de la religion des chamanes, d'où l'appellation 'hiéroglyphes dongba' qu'on lit dans certains documents de recherche, appellation qui rappelle celles des Egyptiens ou des Mayas. Quant à moi, je me demande si ce nom n'est pas un emprunt du mot des peuples tamangs chamanes aux Népal, où 'tongba' signifie 'vide' dans le sens d'un monde vide qui n'a pas de réalité propre et dont l'esprit humain qui tente de la saisir s'égare et se trompe à travers les rets de l'illusion. En fait, le mot 'tongba' devint le nom du 'guide' ou du 'prêtre' chez les Tamangs, du conteur qui incarnait la mémoire communautaire. Et comme Brigitte Steinmann le dit dans son article 'Les Pouvoirs du Tamba Tamang: comment l'usage a trouvé son prêtre' (Collection Purşartha N° 12, Paris 1989, pp. 127-143), le donga est le 'maître essentiel' (page 128). Ce guide ou prêtre est-il à l'origine des dongbas naxis ou est-ce l'inverse? Remarquons aussi que Rock emploie la forme Tong-ba ou Tomba dans son article.
Chaque pictogramme se charge donc d'une force tant divine que mondaine, s'inspirant du monde sacré, représentant cependant la vie quotidienne des Naxis. Pour tracer les pictogrammes, les Dongbas écrivent avec les pinceaux en bambou, comme les Chinois, qu'ils appellent 'meinbei', sur le papier qu'ils fabriquent eux-mêmes.4 Les pictogrammes brillent de couleurs très vives, couleurs issues des pierres trouvées dans les fleuves, concassées, puis mélangées avec du vin et de la colle faite de peau de vache.
L'écriture pictographique se lit a deux niveaux: concret et figuratif ou symbolique. La technique d'associative compounds'5 démontre le génie linguistique des Dongbas. Par exemple, la jambe d'un homme jointe au soleil signifie la 'lumière qui bouge'; le cœur séparé du corps d'un homme signifie la tristesse ou le chagrin, ainsi que le foie, la maladie ou la douleur. Une montagne dessinée dans les bras d'un homme montre sa tolérance, et un fleuve coulant de sa bouche, sa soif désaltérée. Les déités (il y en a une cinquantaine!) portent souvent des cornes ou des crêtes, tel Charelion, le créateur de la nation naxie.

Charelion, le dieu créateur des peuples naxis
Or, les cornes représentent l'abondance,
6
voire la lumière qui aide à faire pousser la moisson, sans oublier que les cornes des bœufs sont une synecdoque dont le symbole exprime la richesse; le bétail à l'époque agricole des Naxis, comptait une des sources de revenus et de subsistance.
7
La notion d'apprendre est rendue par des yeux dessinés au-dessus d'un livre. La notion de penser est très complexe: un sceau est d'abord dessiné, puis à partir du sceau, une ligne courbe, entourée de points se vide dans un carré à l'intérieur duquel sont dessinés cinq points dont l'interprétation se résume à un grand nombre de points (nos idées) qui s'épanchent ou débordent le sceau (notre cerveau) et s'étalent en tant que points d'activité humaine à l'extérieur dans le monde.
L'amour est dépeint comme une figurine entourée de lignes tourbillonnantes pour faire voir la tempête que cette émotion remue en nous. Pour décrire un village des croix sont marquées à l'intérieur d'une grande hutte, procédé spatial que nous retrouvons également dans les caractères chinois.
En effet, l'ordre de l'écriture suit une démarche analogue à celle de l'écriture chinoise : pour dépeindre un homme ou une bête, par exemple, les yeux sont d'abord peints, puis sont tracés le nez, les lèvres, les cornes (ou les oreilles), le cou, les mains ou les ailes, les orteils ou les pattes.
8
Selon Zhao Shihang, chercheur à l'Institut de Culture des Naxis, l'écriture des Dongbas reste la dernière des écritures pictographiques, mais peu de prêtres ou dongas continuent à l'écrire.
9
Dans ce même article informatif, Chen Ya constate qu'il ne reste que 280.000 Naxis en Chine. Dans un recensement en 2000, cependant, le nombre est à la hausse : 310.000 parlent la langue naxie, dont 100.000 mono-langues et 170.000 parlent deux, voire trois langues, soit le chinois ou le bai, soit le tibétain. Avant de plonger dans le monde archaïque, chamane des Naxis, revenons aux observations de Joseph Rock, car celles-ci dévoilent les mystères de cette religion ancienne, éveillent l'étonnement de notre botaniste et géologue, rationaliste et pragmatiste...
6 Pensons aux 'cornes' de Moïse / קרן /qeren/.
7 Tout comme le bétail chez les Hindous védiques, à la fois richesse spirituelle et matérielle.
8 Ge Agan, op. cit. pp. 10-15.

Un cadre majesteux pour une cérémonie remarquable
Parmi maintes cérémonies religieuses chez les Naxis que j'ai eues le privilège d'observer, il en y a une d'un intérêt extraordinaire. Elle a eu lieu lors d'une nuit maussade de juillet. Les nuages noirs s'étaient amoncelés au-dessus des gorges du Yangtze, et le grondement du tonnerre me fit accélérer mes pas à travers les plaines de Likiang pour arriver au hameau avant que la tempête se déchaînât.
Arrivé fatigué, à la suite d'une journée épuisante à Likiang, je me jetai sur mon lit de camp pliant pour me détendre. Le ciel devint plus obscur, et les nuages sombres s'accumulèrent denses et lourds sur la chaîne de pierre à chaux, en face des sommets enneigés; un silence régna avant la tempête.
Tandis que je m'allongeai, observant les éclairs de foudre illuminant les strates des nuages, le bruit assourdi d'un tambour survint à mes oreilles. D'abord, les battements creux et singuliers, qui semblaient lointains, lents dans leur cadence successive, mais qui, très bientôt, s'accélérèrent et prirent plus d'intensité.
Il me semble que Rock crée une mise en scène narrative pour nous préparer aux événements insolites à venir...Le texte de Rock s'anime de détails inquiétants dont il est un protagoniste choisi, comme si son avenir était rattaché à celui des Naxis : La Nature déchaînée joue un rôle au-delà de la figuration ; c'est elle qui prépare la mise en scène, qui éveille l'esprit de Rock et l'invite à pénétrer les nappes d'oubli qui revêtent ce peuple ancien, qui l'accompagne dans les abîmes du Temps pour sonder la Mémoire collective de l'Humanité...
La victime d'une maladie douloureuse
Je demandai la raison de cette perturbation et fut informé que plusieurs Tombas s'étaient rassemblés à la maison d'un voisin pour chasser un diable qui possédait le chef de famille, et le faisait souffrir horriblement des gencives enflammées et d'une ulcération du palais. Je me rappelai que quelques jours auparavant, ce même homme était venu me voir pour avoir des médicaments. J'avais constaté que ses douleurs émanaient d'une dent ulcérée, si je puis me permettre cette appellation, car il n'en restait qu'un trou noir dans sa mâchoire inférieure. Ses gencives étaient gonflées et extrêmement rouges, et du pus s'accumulait autour du palais ; il ne pouvait ni avaler ni fermer sa bouche, et chaque mouvement de ses lèvres devrait lui provoquer une douleur atroce. Je le renvoyai, n'ayant ni les moyens ni l'habilité de le guérir ou de l'aider.
Etant donné que je l'avais laissé tomber, il avait fait appel aux Tombas, aux prêtres naxis, et leur avait demandé de chasser le mauvais esprit qui amène toute maladie.
Le battement des tambours annonça que les Tombas déclaraient la guerre contre l'ennemi, qui bientôt serait coincé, évincé et banni. Et puisqu'on me permettait d'observer toutes les cérémonies et danses sauvages, voici comment celle-ci se déroulaient.

La mise en scène est à remarquer. Il était dix heures. La tempête s'approchait, et avec chaque éclair de foudre successif à l'Est au-dessus de la Gorge du Yangtze, le roulement de tonnerre grondait de plus en plus fort, résonnant sur les énormes parois de pierre à chaux et sur les escarpements du Satseto, couronnées de glace.
Le botaniste Rock nous promène dans une Nature enragée, qui par prolepse, annonce la cérémonie chamane. En même temps, il fait montre d'une rationalité récitive en nous fournissant une explication médicale de la douleur dont souffre l'homme malade! Cette triade -[Nature-Rationalité-chamanisme]sert de trame narrative à Joseph Rock parce qu'elle lui servit de point de repère durant ses 24 ans d'existence chez les Naxis. Cette Nature metteuse en scène, ce Chamanisme appelé pour chasser le Mal, et cette Rationalité, interlope, qui tente de comprendre, de construire un schème logique, qui cherche à tempérer les deux forces organiques, incréées de cette société enveloppée dans l'épaisseur sauvage et magique du monde végétal et animal, primitive, exhume un passé irrationnel, archaïque, non pas pour le rejeter, mais pour le 'situer' dans le présent, là où il coexiste avec Rock dans son présent. Rock, me semble-t-il, fut happé par une émotion saisissante dont il était lui-même témoin, et qu'il essaie de nous communiquer par le recours à une écriture sinon poétique du moins mélodramatique. Combien Rock aurait-il dû s'ébahir devant cette religion 'naturelle', la plus ancienne du monde de par ces rites, ces cérémonies, et la langue, orale et écrite, dont elle était enrobée. Rock qui ployait aux normes prescrites dans sa société occidentale, chez les Naxis s'exposait aux forces violentes, dont seule la rationalité sut le ramener aux lisières de l'imagination réceptive...
Le chamanisme pratiqué par les Naxis était de nature polythéiste avec une pléthore de divinités10 peuplant l'espace cosmologique et la vie quotidienne. Les prêtres ou les dongbas divisent les divinités en deux catégories: endogamiques, d'origine naxie, et exogamique, celles qui furent juxtaposées aux divinités naxies à travers les rapports avec les Hans, les Hindous, les Perses et les Tibétains. Zilaopu est une divinité centrale des Naxis, ainsi que le créateur Charelien, tous deux originaires du système primitif naxi.
Cependant, une divinité telle que Youma, le gardien, écrasant sous son pied (ou sa patte!) gauche un homme, renvoie au Shiva dansant, trépignant le nain, Muyalagan ou Apasmara. S'agit-il d'un emprunt aux Hindous par le biais des bouddhistes tibétains, ou bien d'un concept cosmologique parallèle ?
10 Sans parler des variantes iconographiques de la même divinité selon la région. Par exemple, nous avons compté quatre Youma, la divinité gardienne.

Youma-Shiva ?
De même avec la divinité Shu du Nord, une figure avec le corps d'un homme et la queue d'un serpent, dont la ressemblance avec Vishnu assis sur le serpent Shesha ou Adishesha, le serpent ou cobra primordial ou énergie primordiale divine, s'avère étonnante.
Shu-Vishnu ?
Le diable Danchuciguzi nous fait penser à Mahakala, le 'grand noir', protecteur du dharma des bouddhistes, surtout tibétains, mais aussi à un attribut du Shiva des Hindous, une tête et un couteau dans ses mains:

Danchuiciguzi-Mahakala?
Et voici une autre figure du diable, Ron, dont la forme dépeinte semble s'apparenter au Skanda védique ou Murugan, ou au Rudra des Sivaïtes, sur son véhicule-oiseau, chef des armées célestes qui anéantit des démons, car il est le descendant du feu Agni ou Skanda, selon le Mahabhârata, ou le fils de Shiva, Murugan ou Rudra, selon les Puranas dravidiennes, le Guerrier Rouge!
Ron-Rudra-Skanda?

Kaoraoniujiu, le guerrier-divinité porte trois têtes : est-ce un emprunt à la figure centrale du Brahmâ hindou, l'une de ses têtes ayant été coupée par Shiva à cause du désir de Brahmâ qui s'éveillait au regard de sa fille, Sarasvatî, et dont la décapitation servit de punition pour sa pensée incestueuse...
Kaoraoniujiu-Brahmâ ?
Remarquons, également, une variante de Youma, chevauchant un tigre ou un dragon: est-il monté sur l'âme et l'esprit, tel que les Chinois interprètent ces figures animalières, souvent peintes ensemble ? Or, pour les Chinois, le tigre maîtrise la Terre alors que le dragon, le Ciel...

Que ces divinités soient issues de la religion chamane des Naxis ou empruntées aux religions hindoue ou bouddhiste (tibétaine ou han), nous rappelle que le chamanisme était une 'religion asiatique', répandue parmi maintes nations de l'Asie Centrale et du Sud, qui construisirent une koiné culturelle, rituelle dont les représentations iconographiques reflètent le partage de fonctions, de dogmes théologiques et de cérémonies communes, bien que chaque culture circonscrite dans son espace géographique, exprimât ces fonctions communes dans une langue distincte. Or, si les Mongols, les Hans, les Bais, les Yis, les Tibétains, les Kham-Magars, les Naxis, les Yakuts, les Bourriates, les Manchous et d'autres peuples parlaient leurs langues respectives, la pratique du Chamanisme s'exécutait d'une manière très analogue, les représentations des divinités servant de support autant psychologique que visuel. Ce Chamanisme asiatique puisait à une théologique et rituelle comme au bouddhisme tibétain, surtout lamaïste, source à l'islam soufi de l'Asie Centrale et à l'hindouisme, surtout sivaïte, dont le bön chamaniste chez les Tibétains semble être le précurseur, tant chez eux que chez les Indiens, voire les Chinois.
Le chamane sert d'intermédiaire entre sa communauté et ses dieux, sert aussi de guérisseur en cas de maladie physique et 'psychologique', de psychopompe, porteur de l'âme du défunt dans l'outre-monde. Ceci dit, le chamane mène une vie parfaitement ordinaire en dehors de ses attributs 'officiels' dans sa communauté. Il se marie, a des enfants, et vaque aux activités agricole ou artisanale lorsqu'il ne se penche pas sur les livres sacrés, soit pour les lire soit pour les copier. Quant aux prêtres ou dongas naxis, leur ministère ne hérite pas, mais des novices sont choisis par un prêtre pour leur intelligence, expérience, diligence et surtout pour leur savoir sur la langue naxie des Dongbas. He Kaixiang, l'un des derniers Dongbas des Naxis (78 ans), servait son maître dans sa maison en préparant sa nourriture et en faisant le ménage. Lors des cérémonies, le maître amène avec lui plusieurs novices, afin de les évaluer durant le déroulement en tant qu'apprenti. L'importance du ministère d'un futur dongba repose aussi sur le fait d'être 'vu' par les villageois dont la relation se tisse par le visuel, la présence. Sans cette présence lors des cérémonies exercées par le maître dongba, le novice, aussi préparé soit-il, n'accédera pas au rang d'un dongba. Quant à He Kaixiang, il atteignit le ministère d'un prêtre, exécutant ses propres cérémonies à l'âge de vingt ans.11
Néanmoins, chez d'autres ethnies de l'Asie où la communauté dépend d'un chamane, la transmission de chamane en chamane se fait par métempsychose, l'âme du chamane mort se passe dans l'âme du novice et futur chamane, de la même manière que la lignée des Dalai Lama, cas selon lequel l'élection d'un chamane s'avère inutile. Par exemple, chez les Kham-Magar, le futur chamane est choisi par l'esprit d'un ancêtre chamane qui se réincarne en lui lors d'une danse de sacrifice initiatique.12
Le chamane est souvent décrit avec des ailes et ou avec une tête d'oiseau...la créature qui s'envole avec l'âme du défunt vers les dieux. Les divinités ailées ou à tête ou à corps d'oiseau sont nombreuses chez les Naxis, et pour cause, les chamanes se métamorphosent en oiseaux pour atteindre les divinités dont ils convoitent les attributs!

Les pratiques des chamanes ont toujours été considérées comme maléfiques, inspirées des mauvais esprits, voire du diable lui-même, selon les chrétiens et les musulmans. Leurs danses enflamment. Leurs boissons enivrent. Leurs atours enfièvrent. Leurs chants ensorcellent. Leurs gestes ouvrent la voie à « la chaleur du soleil, la joie de la lumière, la limpidité de l'eau. »13 Avant que je ne poursuive mes commentaires sur ce sujet, voici ce que le botaniste Rock nous rapporte dans les années 40 :
Une image en pâte d'un diable sur l'autel
Dans une cour carrelée de grosses pierres à chaux, un dispositif circulaire posé sur des pieds en bambou avait été érigé. Cet autel pis-allé était fait de canne, ou d'une sorte de bambou, décoré de paille tressée, de branchettes d'un pêcher et de papier jaune perforé. Il avait à peu près trois pieds de diamètre et se dressait à deux pieds du sol. Dans une bande de paille des bâtons étaient placés verticalement, alors qu'au centre était placé une branche plus grande de pêcher, dans la fourche de laquelle un bol gris était posé, semblait-il, à l'image d'un diable, fabriqué de pâte, trônant entre deux bâtons d'encens allumés. Tout près, était assis un Tomba, tambourinant un rythme avec un chant bizarre, tandis que ses pairs Tombas continuaient leurs préparatifs pour la cérémonie.
Le tambour émettait des grondements bizarres ; on sonnait des gongs, et les Tombas maintenant se montraient coiffés de couronnes ou de diadèmes fantastiques, dont les segments ressemblaient aux flammes jaillissantes. Puis l'homme malade s'avançait avec un grand coq, la tête et la bouche ayant été lavées. Les battements creux du tambour devenaient de plus en plus espacés, et au chant se mêlait un requiem d'accents plaintifs.
L'offrande aux esprits des ancêtres
L'offrande aux esprits des ancêtres maintenant s'en suivait. Un cercueil miniature en bois de pin fut posé par terre au pied de l'autel, tandis que le chef Tomba produisit un petit poussin, qu'il tint fermement. Le Tomba et l'homme malade, tous deux, s'agenouillèrent, et celui-ci jeta copieusement des grains de riz et de petits pois sur le poussin, quelques-unes furent enfoncées dans la gorge de l'oiseau.
Finalement les ailes du poussin furent barbouillées de farine,14 puis on lui en enfonça dans la gorge une grande quantité jusqu'à ce qu'il s'en étouffât.
La mort fut annoncée par un requiem naxi. Après avoir lavé le poussin et peigné ses plumes, il fut allongé dans le petit cercueil et couvert de riz, de papier rouge et de papier jaune perforé pour le conserver dans le monde des ombres.15 Puis le couvercle fut cérémonieusement posé sur le cercueil et
13 Voir Marchand, Valère-Marie, Les Alphabets de l'Oubli, éd. Altérnatives 2012, page 139.
14 Barbouiller un animal avec une matière culinaire était une pratique par des Turcs chamanes sur les chevaux avant leur strangulation, c'est l'huile qui servait de substance organique et comestible.
15 En anglais 'the world of shadows'.

l'homme malade prétendit le clouer avec une énorme hache. Etant donné que les Naxis ignorent les clous, l'herbe fut utilisée pour ligoter le couvercle.
Les tambours maintenant battent une cadence animée
Tout le monde à présent se leva et pour dix minutes psalmodia le plus bizarre des requiems, la musique s'amplifiant par les coups de tonnerre. Les offrandes de vin, ensuite, furent placées devant le cercueil et le riz et des pommes de terre bouillies placées sur le couvercle.
L'homme malade, agenouillé, à présent dévorait toute l'offrande. On pourrait appeler ceci le premier acte.
Le deuxième acte fut amorcé par une cadence animée du tambour et des gongs. Un feu fut allumé près de l'autel, et un soc de charrue y fut chauffé au rouge. Devant le mince autel une branchette fut posée, et à travers elle, une épée. Un Tomba maintenant apparut avec de petits arbres -un chêne et un pin-. Il tint ceux-ci droit sur le sol, chantant sans répit. Puis, à l'accompagnement du battement ardent et des gongs, le petit chêne fut brandi comme un coup d'épée, après avoir été touché neuf fois16 par la lame de l'épée.
Ceci accompli, toutes les mélodies cessèrent, et un silence régna pour quelques secondes.
Ensuite, le Tomba saisit le pin et le donna à l'homme malade agenouillé, qui le coupa en deux avec neuf coups légers, au milieu des discours bruyants et chamailleurs.
Le chef des Tombas, à présent, entrait dans la salle centrale de la maison sur les murs de laquelle furent accrochées des bannières religieuses naxies. Ici, sur le côté gauche d'une table, près d'une lampe à huile de pavot, des tas de livres naxis furent empilés.
Toute l'attention de l'assemblée se concentra sur les dieux représentés sur les bannières. Le chef des Tombas échangea son manteau noir pour un bleu17, sa couronne, appelée khöbyu en naxi, pour un turban écarlate ; dans sa ceinture, derrière, il fourra quatre drapeaux perforés, dont deux blancs et deux rouges, lui donnant l'image crachée des ailes d'une chauve-souris si bien que son apparence fut diabolique.
16 Le nombre neuf chez maintes communautés possède un symbolisme puissant. Chez les bouddhistes le nombre neuf indique les neuf vertus que l'homme doit acquérir pour avancer dans son éveil : être doté d'intelligence, parler bien, connaître les mondes, être un guide impeccable pour les novices, etc. Chez les Chinois, le nombre neuf renvoie aux neuf fils du dragon, lesquels englobent les attributs ontologiques et existentiels de l'homme parfait, comme l'amateur de musique, d'armes, de cloches, d'encensoirs, de littérature, etc. Il doit être aussi courageux qu'un lion, aussi sage qu'un tigre, aussi discipliné qu'un dragon, aussi persévérant qu'une tortue...
17 La couleur bleue chez les Turcs chamanes représentait le dieu Tengri, divinité principale, dont le corps bleu irradie et enduit le Ciel éternel (möngke tengri)...

Les tambours et les gongs se mirent à jouer des rythmes sataniques, qui s'accélèrent violemment, tandis que le Tomba, l'épée brandie, maintenant dans sa main, maintenant entre ses dents, la lançait contre le plafond d'entre ses jambes, dansait comme s'il était lui-même possédé par le diable.
Alors survint encore sur la scène le pauvre coq. Sa tête trempée dans du vin, son cou et ses pattes tendus simultanément aux rythmes d'une musique diabolique jamais composée. Le Tomba, tournoyant et transpirant, jetant des coups d'oeil effarants aux cieux, tira brusquement une dernière fois le cou du coq, tandis que le roulement du tambour annonça que sa vie s'éteignait.
L'importance des créatures 'ailées' dans cette cérémonie met en valeur les ailes qui 'enlèvent' l'âme malade ou morte aux dieux de l'outre-monde. Le coq et le poussin sont tantôt les victimes expiatoires, tantôt les rédempteurs qui rachètent et emportent le mal. Ils sont les 'véhicules' qui conduisent le mal hors du corps dont le prêtre-chamane s'avère le conducteur ; un démi-dieu chevauchant entre Terre et Cieux, dans un état extatique, intoxiqué de chant et de vin, d'une mission à accomplir ; psychopompe entre les mondes de vie et de mort, traversant les ponts aussi effilés que les crêtes,
18
montant dans les nappes stratosphériques aussi denses que la soufflerie d'une forge...Cette conduite de la communion, celle traversée et celle montée, s'effectue sans tache de sang ;
19
sans impureté ni souillure, la victimerédempteur, l'expiant-sauveur, étouffé par des produits naturels, cultivés et travaillés par les hommes : farine, graines, vin, riz, petits pois. Les produits qui 'nourrisent' la victime pour qu'elle soit rachetée...
Le prêtre-chamane des Indiens aux plaines de l'Amérique du Nord ne se coiffent-ils pas des plumes des oiseaux lors de leurs danses autour du totem? Les Turcs chamanes n'ont-ils pas leurs racines dans le faucon blanc: 'Ak sungur kuşunun erkeğinde bir kökün var', se vante Kazan dans la onzième légende du Livre de Dede Korkut.
20
Et le jeune prince Boğaç, fils de Dirse Khan, n'est-il pas revêtu d'un manteau aux motifs ornithologiques dans la première légende du même livre: 'Omuzu kuşlu cübbe elbise ver bu oğlana.'
21
En effet, les oiseaux possèdent les énergies cosmologiques: les guerriers oghuz sont 'rapides commes des faucons' (şahbaz), les sultans, sages comme des 'alouettes' (cayır kuşlu). Les Soufis mystiques ne doivent-ils pas apprendre 'la langue des oiseaux, tout comme Salomon l'enjoint dans le Coran, XXVII, 16 : 'Et Salomon hérita de David et dit : « ô hommes ! On nous a appris le langage des oiseaux, et on nous a donné part de toutes choses. C'est là vraiment la grâce évidente. »
22
18 Le 'sırat köprüsü' chez les Turcs chamanes.
19 Chez les Turcs chamanes, le sacrifice du cheval lors du décès de son maître, se fait par strangulation sans effusion de sang, lui accordant une mort honorable. Cette cérémonie s'appelle 'ıdık' ou 'ıduk' ' ; en turc moderne 'kansız kurban' : 'sacrifice sans effusion de sang'.
20 'J'ai mes racines dans la virilité du faucon blanc.' (notre traduction)
21 'Donne un manteau aux oiseaux sur les épaules à ce garçon' dit Dede Korkut à Dirse Khan, le père de Boğaç.

Le livre de Farid al-Din Atar 'Mantiq el-tayr' La Langue des Oiseaux, nous offre un témoignage de ces imagettes23 de Dieu, de ces âmes qui s'envolent vers le Mont Qâf à leurs risques et périls, à la quête de Simorg (trente oiseaux en perse), le Seigneur de la création, notre essence absolue.
Ô combien perdent leur vie dans cette traversée de vallées et de montagnes ! Seulement trente y parviennent, et lorsque le Simorg leur accorde audience, les trente comprennent qu'ils ne sont que Lui, tranformés peu à peu en Lui, par Lui pendant leur longues et douloureuses tribulations. Les trente, ne sont qu'Un (tawhid), L'Unité dans le nombreux, le nombreux par l'Unité...
Chaque oiseau-âme diffère selon son existence, mais s'accorde selon leur essence absolue et leur désir d'Unité en Dieu, miroir de cette essence absolue. Ibn Sina voit dans l'âme un oiseau enfermé dans une cage du corps, limite de l'existence humaine, corporelle. Ce piège qui est le corps, doit être défait pour que l'oiseau-âme s'envole -'can kuşu uçtu'- pour chercher et retrouver son Créateur, car elle est l'imagette de Dieu-Créateur.
Hacı Bektaşi n'est-il pas l'incarnation d'Ali, premier Imam des chi'ites, dont l'âme est revêtue d'une grue cendrée, oiseau voyageur depuis les déserts du Moyen Orient jusqu'aux plaines anatoliennes pour fonder la sagesse des Alévites des Bektaşi ? Enfin, Sham-i Tabrazi écrit dans le Dîwan-e-Kabir que les voix des oiseaux confèrent l'immortalité, et son disciple, Djalâl-od-Dîn Rûmi (1207-1273) psalmodiait que :
« Corps comme l'oiseau, vers ton séjour natal, car le voilà, échappa de la cage et les ailes sont déployées. »24
En effet, la danse libère l'âme de son corps, tout comme l'oiseau libéré de sa cage...
Chez les tribus chamanes dravidiennes des montagnes de Nilgiri dans le Tamil Nadu au Sud de l'Inde, les guerriers de la tribu de Kannappa, telle qu'elle nous est décrite dans la Periyapuranam, lors de leurs danses extatiques, gazouillent comme des oiseaux avant les chasses.25
Une danse fanatique est exécutée par le chef-chamane
La forme plumée, inanimée fut alors posée sur l'autel, la cadence de la musique accéléra son rythme, alors que le prêtre-exécuteur, qui agissait comme possédé du Mal, exécutait une danse fanatique, roulant ses yeux étrangement, lesquels reflétaient son état ému. Dans sa main gauche, il brandit un anneau en fer avec des disques du même métal, tandis que dans sa main droite, il frappa un gong à toute vitesse.
23 Mot médiéval qui signifie les créatures façonnées à l'image de Dieu.

Les villageois qui s'étaient rassemblés dans la cour demeuraient les spectateurs silencieux, mais visiblement touchés par les rites mystérieux.
Un pot avec de l'huile fut alors placé sur un brasero devant la porte, tandis que le Tomba dansa frénétiquement avec les bandelettes du papier flamboyantes dans sa main droite. Tout à coup, il bondit dans le feu, et pieds-nus dispersa les bûches brûlantes aux quatre coins de la cour. Ceci fut accompagné des tambours et des gongs, des coups de tonnerre et des éclairs de foudre.
Le prêtre met sa langue sur le soc de charrue échauffé
Avec son épée il soulève le soc de charrue ardent du feu, le pose par terre et danse autour de lui frénétiquement, tantôt l'effleurant avec ses pieds nus, tantôt se mettant debout sur lui ; et finalement, après l'avoir mis debout, le bout en haut, il le lèche avec sa langue, le son d'un sifflement se produisant par le contact de la langue sur le soc brûlant, clairement audible.
Puis il trempe sa main droite dans l'huile bouillante, tenant le pot dans sa main gauche, nue, entre dans la pièce où se trouvent les bannières, et émerge avec le pot plein de flammes bleues, qu'il remue avec son épée ; puis il trempe sa main dans le pot embrasé.
Avec le pot brûlant et ses doigts dégoulinant de flammes, il se précipite de pièce en pièce, l'épée entre ses dents, de chaque coin de la maison, chassant le diable, qui pourrait se recroquevillier quelque part dans un recoin.
La foule de spectateurs maintenant s'excite et dirige son attention dans un coin qui reste à être purifié. D'une manière obéissante, le Tomba se précipite avec le pot embrasé et ses doigts lance des flammes aux endroits désignés, jusqu'à ce que, finalement, il asperge l'autel circulaire avec du feu, lequel est aussitôt soulevé et apporté dans la cour et brûlé au milieu des pan pan des pétards.
Le Tomba enflammé suit l'autel dehors, accompagné des battements de gongs et de tambours et des anneaux en fer.
Les femmes maintenant se hâtent à chercher les balais et balayent chaque coin de la cour, étant sûres que rien n'y reste, puis toutes les portes sont fermées, et l'homme malade est censé être débarrassé du Mal, et par conséquent de sa maladie.
Il va sans dire que la cérémonie à laquelle le botaniste Rock assistait aurait dû empreindre son esprit profondément et d'une manière indélébile, car les détails affleurent sous sa plume comme autant d'imagettes ou petits tableaux vivants. Comme si lui-même s'abîmait dans le tourbillon de cette danse, inspirant un respect mêlé d'effrois ! Rock n'est pas le premier occidental à avoir assisté à une danse chamanique, mais l'effet produit sur lui, et l'expression de son témoignage, correspondent à un vrai désir de partage émotionnel.

Voici dans le Tamil Nadu les prêtres jésuites ou les Révérends anglicans et protestants, témoins des danses des tribus des montagnes des Nilgiri, qui reculaient avec horreur devant ces scènes bombastiques, et employaient des mots comme 'ébriété' ou 'ivrognerie produit par l'alcool' pour décrire les gesticulations et cris des chamanes. Certains attestent même que ces chamanes étaient possédés du diable, vu la manière dont ils gesticulaient tête, yeux, bras et jambes ! Bref, les cérémonies étaient qualifiées d'orgiaque ou de bachique, dépassant la rationalité dont ces religieux avaient été dotés grâce à leur éducation occidentale, et surtout leur christianisme raisonné...
De même pour les danses soufies des Alévites bektaşi (ou d'autres confessions chi'ites) qui ont été décriées comme lubriques, arrosées d'alcool, enflammées par la présence des femmes, et donc malsaines, hérétiques aux goûts et aux normes des sunnites conservateurs.26 Quant à moi, lorsque l'autel est emporté en dehors de la maison et brûlé dans la cour, selon les dires de Rock, ce geste me rappelle la mise à feu de Mahakala à la fin du festival de Cham chez les bouddhistes du Sikim, où l'effigie de la divinité dansante, Nagpo ou Chenpo chez les Tibétains, fut amenée hors du temple après douze jours de prières et de danses, puis brûlée devant la foule, alors que les moines dansaient autour du feu, geste ou acte qui clôturait la fête. Les douze ou quinze jours de fête de Cham sont accompagnés de cymbales, triangles, cors et tambours sans répit. En effet, la danse signifie méditation ou prière, et la mise à feu finale n'est que le signe du feu divin de la joie. Hodja Ahmet Yesevî (1093-1166), fondateur du soufisme turcophone en Asie Centrale, nous psalmodie dans ses Hikmets (strophes de sagesse) le chant et la danse :
« Şiblî âşık semâ urdı pertev körüp[...] andağ kullar raks u semâ urdı döstlar. »
'Şibli dansa la danse de l'Amour et vit la Lumière[...] Amis, chant (semâ) et danse (raks) comme font les serviteurs'27
Şibli, le sage, demanda permission d'Allah de chanter et de danser :
« ruhsat tilep raks u semâ urdı döstlar »
'Il mourait d'envie de demander permission de chanter et de danser.'28
La danse est une prière, instituée par Djalâl-od-Dînî Rûmi dont le samâ imprime le corps et l'esprit dans un lieu fixe, le temple ou le tekke. Les moines tournent, tournent comme les planètes autour du soleil, le Maître danseur, comme des atomes dans l'Univers, aux mélodies du ney 'flûte', du tambourin, des tambours et du psaltérion oriental, le kanun ! La danse est cultuelle, d'où les rites prescrits selon l'acte
26 Cérémonies appelées chez les Alévites 'mum söndü' 'les bougies éteintes'.

à accomplir, dont musique et chant suivent une chorégraphie rigoureuse selon les besoins du chamane, qui lui dirige, conduit, règle.
La danse est thérapeutique: elle exauce pour faire renaître, purge pour guérir, anime pour susciter une intercession. La danse dit de Saint-Guy ou chorée se voulait une 'méthode' pour purger l'air des épidémies, attribuées au diable ; danse exécutée surtout en Alsace et en Allemagne à la fin du Moyen Age et tout au long de la Renaissance, à laquelle homme, femme et enfant participaient.
Les chamanes Kham-Magars alternent entre danser autour du feu et psalmodier des chants chamaniques, accompagnés des battements du tambour lors des cérémonies de purgation de l'air des épidémies qui déciment le bétail.29 Chose étonnante, l'un des accessoires chamaniques, utilisés dans ce rite s'avère le soc de charrue, que les chamanes plantent dans le sol !30 En revanche, si les poulets sont sacrifiés pour une âme malade, égorgés, le sang et l'alcool sont bus par les chamanes, interdit chez les chamanes turco-mongols.
Enfin, chez les Juifs hassidiques de l'Ukraine, depuis le XVII° siècle, la danse et le chant, surtout pendant l'accueil du shabbat, ont animé les fidèles bien plus que la rigoureuse étude talmudique ou de la Torah ; activité corporelle plus qu'intellectuelle qui unit la communauté autour de la Torah par la très joyeuse danse de la Simhat Torah, laquelle attise le bonheur collectif dans l'union entre corps et esprit...entre corps communautaire et esprit divin, enveloppant chacune et chacun...
L'homme malade ne souffre plus
La cérémonie à peine terminée, une tempête éclata pour le bon, et tout le village fut ébranlé jusqu'en ses fondations par des coups de tonnerre terrifiants, mettant ainsi fin à cette diablerie31 avec un point culminant opportun.
Tôt le matin suivant, j'appelai l'homme malade, qui était le principal participant dans cette cérémonie étrange. A mon étonnement, il ne montra aucun signe de n'avoir jamais eu un palais ou des gencives malades, bien que la mauvaise dent demeurât. Il va sans dire qu'il apprêtait l'efficacité de sa guérison au Tomba, qui reçut comme remerciement du grain, de la farine, du lard et l'équivalent de deux dollars américains.32
Cette cérémonie s'appelle Dzu dü. Comme c'était impossible de prendre des photos de cette exécution particulière, qui durait jusqu'à deux heures du matin, j'arrangeai qu'une autre cérémonie eût lieu dans m cour, sous prétexte de pouvoir prendre des photos. Le Tomba y consentit. La

31 Notez la qualification!
32 Les chamanes mongol-turcs étaient dotés aussi du pouvoir de voir les esprits taquineurs, provocateurs de maladies et de désordres corporels et mentaux.

cérémonie impressionnante dura des heures, et finalement termina lorsque l'un des Tombas prit le soc de charrue ardent dans sa bouche et le tint entre ses dents.
Toute maladie est due aux esprits malfaisants
Quelques jours plus tard, je reçus une invitation de plusieurs Tombas du village voisin de Pösha Leai pour assister à une cérémonie tout à fait différente. Etant donné que la superstition règne parmi les Naxis, ils sont incapables d'attribuer des causes naturelles aux troubles ou aux maladies, mais voient toujours dans le malheur la main des esprits maléfiques ou des esprits des défunts qui ont besoin d'aide, et dans leur désir de l'emporter, font du mal à leurs parents et à leur famille, sans répit.
C'était le cas avec un Naxi chez qui j'étais invité pour assister à la cérémonie. Il n'avait pas de chance avec son bétail, et vu que les vétérinaires n'existaient pas, il fit appel aux Tombas, qui imputaient tout son malheur à son père, qui s'était suicidé il y a 30 ans, et qui avait toujours grand besoin d'assistance dans le monde des ombres. Un autel, donc, fut dressé, consistant en une tourbe verte posée sur des tables.
Le bambou ou la canne fut planté sur la tourbe, et des baguettes d'arbre de pin (Pinus yünnanensis) furent dressées derrière l'autel, alors que deux peupliers (Populus tibethicus), couverts de papier décoratif, furent mis derrière le tout. Les brindilles du peuplier furent posées sur la tourbe.
Quand j'arrivai, la cérémonie avait commencé. Cinq Tombas dansaient autour de l'autel avec des épées, des cymbales et des gongs, tandis qu'un sixième battait un tambour. Le propriétaire faisait une offrande aux esprits en jetant du vin de petits bols sur le toit de sa maison, puis à la fin, prit lui-même une bouchée d'alcool et la cracha dans l'air au-dessus des avant toits.
Pendant deux heures, voire plus, la danse continua, augmentant en violence quand les épées étaient lancées dans l'air, et des batailles simulées étaient menées contre les esprits invisibles autour de l'autel.33
A midi, la cérémonie fut suspendue, et la danse recommença dans l'après-midi avec une cérémonie de clôture durant laquelle les esprits maléfiques furent évincés à la manière naxie, comme déjà décrit ci-dessus. La journée suivante, les deux peupliers criards furent apportés dehors dans une prairie, et une dernière danse fut exécutée devant eux, avant qu'ils fussent brûlés.
Si le bétail du propriétaire fût guéri de leur maladie, je ne suis pas capable de le dire...
33 Pendant le mois de Muharrem, les chi'ites, pour commémorer le martyre de Hüseyin, fils d'Ali et deuxième Imam, font procession dans les rues de leur voisinage, feignant les combats avec les épées, en bois, en plastique ou réelles !

Chez les Naxis une littérature religieuse a survécu, écrite avec des symboles pictographes très particuliers. L'écriture est sans aucun doute d'origine tibétaine,34 et la date nous est inconnue. Elle ressemble à certains dessins dans les livres religieux d'une secte pré-bouddhiste, les Bonpo. Seuls les Tombas savent lire l'écriture, et ils transmettent leur savoir à leurs fils pour qu'ils accèdent au ministère de la prêtrise.35 Il existe, cependant, deux formes d'écriture en usage -les symboles pictographes et une écriture de signes, laquelle ressemble tant soit peu aux signes chinois- en fait, certains de ces symboles s'avèrent simplement chinois. Je crois que ce dernier n'est qu'une évolution tardive, l'écriture pictographe, étant beaucoup plus ancienne.
Dans un des livres naxis, on dit que le Lör gyŏ gki gyŏ, qui est, paraît-il, le shikia-fu des Chinois, représenté par les Naxis comme une figure dansante avec un trident sur sa tête,36 apprit aux Naxis à écrire ces livres.
Que l'histoire du Déluge ne soit pas inconnue des Naxis est mise en évidence par la traduction d'un livre, un feuillet que voici reproduit en naxi et traduit en anglais.
Le récit naxi que Rock a transcrit et traduit37
34 Comme déjà dit, la langue naxie est apparentée à la famille linguistique sino-tibétaine.
35 Qui semble contredire les propos de He Kaixang, mais en accord avec d'autres formes de transmission du savoir sacré chez les chamanes dont les Khama-Marga et les Mongols-Turcs.
36 Dont l'origine pourrait être les représentations du Shiva Natarâja, dansant avec son trident (à la main) ou Mahakala, l'avatar tibéto-bouddiste, ou bien le Shikla-Fa chinois!

Traduction d'une Page de l'un des Livres des Nashis
La traduction semble claire. Le livre en question traite de la Création du monde; plus tard le récit sera le sujet d'un article plus technique.
Voici donc la transcription et traduction. Le texte se lit de gauche à droite, commençant par la rubrique à gauche:
(1)Nluo sse khö dku dje – Nluo et ssē : mâle et femelle (lesquels correspondent à notre Adam et Eve) vinent vivre ensemble.
(2)Sz dzu ngi gku dje – Tous deux partirent couper du bois à brûler dans la montagne: après l'avoir coupé, le bois à brûler partit au village.38
(3)Lu gku ta gku dje – Les pierres commencèrent à parler.
(4)Dsh(Dj) Lu ngü dje – Le monde remuait de sorte que personne ne savait où se trouvait la terre.
(5+6)Sz ne lu nyi gku (6) n'gi pär mua ngio la gkü dzu mua shä cho – Les pierres et les arbres voulurent descendre dans les plaines et commencèrent à se disputer avec les gens de la terre, alors l'eau devint furieuse et la vapeur monta aux cieux qui rendit les astres et la lune visibles.
(7)Gyi pär dü ngio la – Après que l'eau (vapeur) fut montée aux cieux, elle retourna à la terre dans des quantités énormes, couvrant le monde, ce qui fit tout pousser.
(8)Gyi pär lŏ ngio la – Après la descente de l'eau, les fleuves se formèrent aussi bien que les lacs.
(9)Gyi yi lö shā cho gyi pär wua ngio la dzi yü wua shä cho – Après que l'eau se fut retirée, une maison devint visible qui n'existait pas auparavant. Quand ils virent la maison, ils l'imitèrent et en construisirent plus.
(10)Ta pür lŏ nü dŏ – Ils (Nluo et Ssĕ) apprirent au peuple à parler.
(11)Tshü pür sse nü do - - Ils (Nluo et Ssĕ) apprirent au peuple ce qui est bon à manger et à boire.
(12)Ör pür pö nü dŏ – Shikia-fa apparut et apprit au peuple à écrire ces livres.
38 (note de Rock): Peut-être s'agit-il de la paresse du peuple, mais plus tard on s'arrangerait pour que les femmes apportassent le bois à brûler de la montagne au village.

Comme j'ai dit dans mon introduction, mon rapport à la langue naxie se limite à la lecture des pictogrammes. Contrairement à Rock ou à des amateurs ou professionnels de la langue naxie, je ne l'ai jamais entendu parler, la langue chinoise étant la langue intermédiaire entre moi et les Naxis que j'ai rencontrés dans le Yunnan.
Par conséquent, pour étudier la langue écrite, je suis allé à l'Institut de Recherche de la Culture dongba à Lijiang, fondé en 1981, où 6,500 manuscrits peuvent être consultés, et autant, plus ou moins, photocopiés en fac-similés, mais en noir et blanc. Il existe une autre manière de se procurer un manuscrit original ; il suffit de rencontrer un prêtre naxi -chose facile- autour des temples, feindre un grand intérêt pour sa langue et sa culture, et il vous proposera l'achat de l'un de ses manuscrits précieux. C'est, en effet, tentant, surtout pour un prix dérisoire; à l'époque, même pas 1,000 yuan ! Bien que la tentation fût grande, je m'en abstins...
Ainsi me trouvai-je à l'Institut où j'achetai quelques fac-similés avec leur traduction (interprétation?) chinoise. J'achetai également un dictionnaire pictographique naxi39 et un petit glossaire pour supplémenter le dictionnaire. Par ailleurs, en visite dans un temple tout près de Lijiang, mais dont le nom m'échappe, j'achetai de l'artiste du temple un rouleau en symboles naxis, aux couleurs vives, qui raconte le récit de la Création des peuples naxis, et que je reproduis et traduis ici. J'ai traduit, également, trois récits à partir des fac-similés de l'Institut, en m'appuyant sur les interprétations chinoises, récits que je travaillais pendant un an et demi en Chine.
Fasciné par ces pictogrammes hauts en couleur, par leur loquacité muette, par mes voyages dans cette belle région de la Chine, voici les fruits de cette fascination. La lecture du rouleau se fait de droite à gauche, comme les anciens rouleaux chinois.

dans la nuit
Le deuxième fils était un Naxi en cinq jours.
Le petit fils était un Bai 40 .
La population s'accrut comme des étoiles au ciel
La population se reproduit ccomme l'herbe sur la terre .
Selon ce récit de la Création, les peuples naxis se trouvent entre une grande nation tibétaine et une plus petite, bai ou dai, une position géographique entre l'Ouest et l'Est, et un peuple, symboliquement, qui reconnaît les Tibétains comme une nation plus puissante qu'elle, mais dans le même temps, respectueuse du benjamin ! Le récit de la Création semble donc, avoir un air de famille avec le grand frère, Tibet, respecté pour sa place dans cette famille. Le deuxième, Naxi, place généologique plus difficile à assumer entre un grand, qui est l'héritier et un troisième, choyé, parce que le dernier. Le récit place les Naxis dans une configuration ardue, compliquée...agonique dont la lutte a lieu tant pour un héritage équilibré que pour une reconnaissance historique juste. En somme, les luttes des Naxis restent 'internes', 'familiales', non forcément pour la terre, mais pour maintenir son nom dans l'Histoire : désir de tout Homme....de toute Nation...
Quelques remarques sur les pictogrammes. Mes lecteurs ont certainement remarqué le signe du
swastika, écrit deux fois dans le récit, signe abject depuis les abominations nazies, mais
qui signifie dans la tradition culturelle des peuples de l'Asie 'fertilité', 'auspices' dont les deux lignes, mâle et femelle, se joignent au centre pour produire, reproduire...s'étendre.41 Il est regrettable que ce
40 Ou Dai.
41 Dans certaines communautés asiatiques, le swastika signifie aussi 'la puissance solaire'.

signe si fécond soit devenu le signe de l'abominable dans les pays occidentaux.42 En ce qui concerne la forme
d'un animal en rose, aussi reproduit deux fois, c'est un marqueur d'aspect du temps du passé. Quant aux autres pictogrammes, la plupart s'avèrent assez parlants, mais on peut s'arrêter un moment sur le premier pictogramme du rouleau que j'ai traduit par 'création', mais qui signifie plus banalement 'sortir', et ressemble assez étrangement au sinogramme ' 出' /ču/ 'sortir, sortie'. De même, le symbole , 'l'herbe', fait penser au chinois '米' /mi/ 'riz non décortiqué'. Ceci dit, les possibles emprunts à l'écriture chinoise sont tardifs dans l'évolution de la langue naxie.
Voici maintenant mon deuxième récit, traduit à partir d'une fac-similé des textes naxis photocopiés de l'Institut. Cette fois-ci, je lis le récit de gauche à droite. Les phrases mises entre crochets indiquent les 'espaces syntaxico-narratologique' du récit. Espaces qui n'équivalent pas à notre notion de phrase, mais qui délimitent un 'segment de récit', une image scénique, comme autant de photogrammes sur une bande cinématographique.
Deuxième récit naxi (photocopié)
42 En effet, Bernard Marillier, adhérent de la pensée d'extrême droite en France, considère le swastika comme symbole d'une « race-souche primordiale et, au-delà, d'une humanité originelle blanche vivant en contact direct avec le pur principe divin. ». Cette définition pose la base aryenne qui oriente les synergies européennes vers le phantasme d'un avenir du monde blanc avec pour support topographique l'Eurosibérie... Voir Marillier, Bernard, Le Svastika, éd. Puisseaux Pardès 'Bibliothèque des Symboles' 1997.

[Il y a longtemps apparurent dans le ciel et sur la terre le soleil, la lune, et les étoiles, et les étoiles filantes aussi apparurent] [des arbres, des pierres et des montagnes(?)apparurent aussi) [Puis apparurent les magiciens, le dieu de victoire, Sans-Do et Wo, le dieu de la guerre, Heng et Du le dieu et la déesse] [Les ancêtres de l'homme étaient sans [leur dieu] Gao et l'ennemi naquit] [Les prêtres et magiciens Dongbas naquirent] [Gao et ses générations naquirent] [Gao mangeait de la viande, travaillait les champs avec prospérité] [Un jour il fit paître son bétail sur les prairies où épanouissaient les fleurs. Il aimait (cette vie) et y vivait] [Un jour, à l'aube, Gao emmena son chien de chasse dans les prairies de la chaîne des montagnes].
Voici le troisième récit :
Troisième récit naxi (photocopie)
[A l'aube sur la montagne] [il n'y avait pas de nuages, de pluie, d'arbres, de vie (homme)] [Gao lutta contre la vie pour une maison, des arbres] [Il coupa des feuilles de bouleau pour bâtir une maison][Il fit habiller des hommes et leur fait faire le labeur] [L'homme laboura des années, il avait peur des épreuves] [Gao partait la nuit pour la maison et travaillait jour et nuit très dur] [entre le ciel et la terre le dieu de la maisonnée vint] [Il envoya un messager qui exerçait la divination avec les outils, Gao vola les outils] [Gao et Luo étaient dans la maison et le messager alla voir le grand Dongba].
Il semble que dans ce récit, la divinité Gao (?) apprenne aux Naxis comment agir une fois sur terre : s'habiller, labourer la terre, bâtir les maisons. Mais pour accomplir ces rites quotidiens, l'homme a besoin

de bons outils, et non ceux ensorcelés par les esprits malfaisants. Alors, Gao vole ces outils ensorcelés pour les rendre utiles aux hommes; c'est-à-dire, afin qu'ils soient des instruments au service de l'homme et non leur maître ! L'outil est le serviteur de l'homme. Peut-être pour cette raison-ci, le messager sorcier doit-il voir le prêtre Dongba afin d'apprendre l'usage correct des outils dans la vie. Ce récit, s'il s'agit, effectivement, de cette interprétation, fournit un excellent exemple (exemplum!) pour notre époque où la technologie n'est plus au service des hommes, mais s'assujettit l'homme! Comment? Par divination? Par ensorcellement? Peut-être...
Et voici le quatrième récit:
Quatrième récit naxi (photocopié)
[La déesse sorcière créa du jade, des pins, de l'argent, de l'or et des perles] [créa des arbres dont neuf furent abattus pour fabriquer l'homme coiffé d'un chapeau, habillé d'une veste et de chaussures] [Il créa le ciel et les neuf villages aux palissades, sept greniers et cinq autres] [Il utilisa l'or pour faire le corps, les pins verts pour les yeux, les coquillages pour les dents, les perles pour le cœur] [l'homme de saule se mit debout et dansa] [mais quand il regarda à gauche un mauvais sort lui échut] [ ainsi qu'au centre] [Gao vint habillé d'un chapeau et d'une veste] [ habillé aussi de chaussures] [ douze années de malheur, encore douze années de calamités et trente années de catastrophe, l'homme fit de la soie et de la laine] [Un grand tambour fut battu et un grand clocher sonné, la terre entière trembla].

L'intervention des dieux organisent la vie des hommes parce qu'ils fabriquent l'homme ; une fabrication de matériaux organiques de la terre, et donc précieux. La répartition relève d'un souci hiérarchique : le corps en or, celui qui brille ; les yeux en pin vert pour leur couleur de jade, suave et claire, mais aussi parce que le pin sert à fabriquer l'encre pour le prêtre naxi ; le bois est brûlé puis la suie est ramassée puis mélangée avec de l'eau et de la colle. De plus, il faut à peu près six mois pour fabriquer un livre à un prêtre, donc cette encre était particulièrement précieuse. Les dents se fabriquent en coquillage, certes, fragile, mais éclatantes et résonnant de la marine ; et pour le cœur les belles perles, tant admirées à la fois pour leur beauté lisse et leur valeur inestimable, car cachées dans le for intérieur de l'homme océanique...
Est-ce la danse de l'homme de saule qui provoqua la misère du monde ? Ou bien est-ce Gao, le dieu puissant, fabriquant de l'homme qui se fâcha à cause du manque de perspicacité du danseur qui regarda à gauche au lieu de regarder tout droit, vers son destin ? Ainsi, la terre s'ébranla aux sons calamiteux des tambours et des clochers...
Nous voyons par ces quelques récits que la vie des Naxis gît entre les dieux créateurs, mais colériques, et une vie sur terre, difficile à assumer, pleine de labeur quotidien, baignée de magie noire contre laquelle il doit se défendre s'il veut survivre. Entre les dieux et cette terre, parfois ingrate, dure à labourer, les Naxis coincés entre le grand frère héritier de tout et le petit benjamin, dorloté, voire gâté ? Entre Ciel et Terre, voici le destin que les dieux ont réservé pour le peuple naxi, une place amère, disgracieuse...voire oublieuse...
Dans chaque village naxi vit un ou deux Tombas, et chaque Tomba possède son propre lieu de sacrifice aux alentours du village. Un tel lieu est appelé 'Muang bö dà', ce qui signifie littéralement, lieu d'adoration divine. Il consiste en un trou oblong qui se donne au sud. L'autel, une plate-forme43 en pierre, se trouve au nord.
Au cinquième jour du Nouvel An, les Tombas se réunissent avec les hommes du village pour accomplir les offrandes annuelles aux dieux, mais surtout aux esprits responsables pour tous les maux qui accablent les hommes du ciel – tels que les inondations, les tempêtes de grêle, les coups de tonnerre, les éclairs- et aux bêtes sauvages et aux voleurs.
Sur l'autel trois arbres sont érigés, un chêne sur chaque côté et un peuplier au centre. L'arbre à gauche représente le ciel, celui au centre, Dieu, et celui à droite, la terre. Les arbres se nomment dans cet ordre : Muang, Dö et Khä. Un œuf éclaté44 est posé sur un trépied en bambou. Un grand panier d'orge représente le père de la famille, le petit panier, le premier enfant mâle.
43 Nous retrouvons l'autel situé sur « une plate-forme à mi-hauteur d'un arbre » chez les Kham-Magar. Voir Anne de Sales, op. cit. page 118.
44 L'oeuf du culte du sacrifice pourrait représenter l'Oeuf cosmique, né des eaux primordiales. Chez les Tibétains, il est l'origine de la lignée généalogique des hommes ; l'essence des cinq sens. L'oeuf représente aussi le repos, la maisonnée ou le nid, tout ce

Des pierres, des bâtons d'encens et des bols du vin sont placés sur l'autel comme des offrandes, devant lesquels trois grands bâtons d'encens, appelés 'chü men', sont placés, décorés vivement de papier couleur orange. Quand on allume les bâtons d'encens, un cochon et un coq sont placés au milieu d'eux par terre. Le sang du cochon sacrifié est étalé sur la pierre au centre et aussi sur les tiges des arbres dont l'écorce a été enlevée.
D'abord le prêtre chante des livres religieux. Puis, après avoir purifié et béni l'autel et l'offrande, le cochon est nettoyé dans le trou vers le bas et allongé sur l'autel. La vésicule biliaire est suspendue sur l'arbre du ciel, le rein sur l'arbre qui représente Dieu, et le foie, ou une partie, sur l'arbre qui représente la terre.45 Le chant continue, les esprits maléfiques, sont sollicité d'entrer dans l'oeuf.
La cérémonie se termine lorsque les hommes du village dévorent les offrandes.
Les femmes sont interdites de visiter le lieu de sacrifice
Les femmes sont exclues du lieu du sacrifice et n'ont même pas le droit d'approcher du trou. On ne leur permet pas d'écouter les chants religieux ni de prendre part au festin qui dure plusieurs jours.
Le sort des femmes naxies s'avère très difficile, et puisque les livres religieux racontent le bonheur dans le monde des ombres, on craint qu'elles se suicident si les hommes leur donnent le droit d'écouter les récits religieux.
Comme des esprits maléfiques sont censés être entrés dans l'oeuf après la cérémonie, il semble normal qu'un Naxi malade ne mange pas d'oeufs. J'ai souvent tâché de persuader les malades de se nourrir d'œufs dans du lait pendant plusieurs jours, mais ils refusent catégoriquement et déclarent : « si nous mangeons des œufs, nous mourrons sûrement. »
Les peuples naxis exécutent maintes cérémonies en plus que celles-ci décrites, et chaque maladie requiert un autel différent. La danse, néanmoins, s'avère la même dans tous les cas.
C'est la première fois qu'une tentative de décrire les cérémonies religieuses des Naxis a été entreprise ; une tribu à peine connue qui perd rapidement son identité à cause de l'assimilation46 des Chinois.
qui est élément maternel. Cette représentation d'un intérieur produit la tension entre le poussin qui cherche à faire éclater la coquille, et le désir de rester 'au chaud', d'où, peut-être l'interdiction aux femmes d'assister à la cérémonie, assistance qui aurait pu engendrer des réactions psychologiquement hostiles au déroulement du rite étant donné que l'oeuf éclaté exprime ou symbolise l'énergie féminine libérée.
45 Rite que nous retrouvons chez certains peuples africains, où le placenta de la femme après son accouchement est suspendu dans un Baobab.
46 Le mot en anglais est 'absorption'.

Conclusion: Etre/Lettre
Joseph Rock, géologue, botaniste, voire docteur improvisé, passa 24 ans chez les peuples naxis dans les années 1920, 30 et 40, dans les régions du Yunnan, du Tibet, du Sichuan et dans le Gansu. Il fut le premier à rédiger un dictionnaire naxi, et grâce à lui, le musée provinçal du Yunnan put acheter des manuscrits précieux de sa propre collection à la suite de son décès en 1962. Ces manuscrits sont d'autant plus précieux que traditionnellement, lorsque un prêtre naxi meurt, les livres sacrés sont enterrés avec lui, voire parfois brûlés.47 La bibliothèque contient 3,038 manuscrits, la plus grande collection de manuscrits naxis dans le monde.
Le monde naxi aujourd'hui a été réduit considérablement, mais sa culture, tenace, a survécu aux affres du communisme fervent ; survivra-t-elle à la frénésie consummatrice ? Selon certaines sources exactes ou inexactes, il reste soixante prêtres dont trois ont moins de 30 ans ! De plus, même si la population lettrée s'est accrue parmi les Naxis, la transcription des pictographes en lettres latines, s'est généralisée, son aboutissement 'encourageant' pour certains, corrobore une totale ignorance culturelle eu égard à la langue écrite, qui peu à peu, disparaît sous l'assaut de ces bonnes intentions simplificatrices, lesquelles ne cherchent pas à éduquer une personne 'dans sa langue', mais à l'endoctriner dans 'la forme ou robe d'une autre'. L'argument que l'alphabet latin rend une lecture, donc un enseignement plus facile pour les enfants n'est qu'un mensonge idéologique. Un 'raisonnement' engourdi pour ne pas dire sot émit par Atatürk lors de la transition de l'alphabet ottoman (arabe!) en lettres latinisées en 1927, suite à la fondation de la République turque, et uniquement motivé par les orientations occidentales d'Atatürk. Le 'père des Turcs' se tournait vers l'Europe du progrès, tournant le dos aux pays 'arriérés' du monde musulman, arabe ou perse. Cette orientation politique n'a aucun sens linguistique ni pédagogique. Un enfant en Iraq, en Syrie ou en Iran apprend aussi bien sa langue arabe ou perse écrite qu'en enfant turc avec ses lettres latines, soi-disant plus commodes !
En outre, il n'existe que 1,400 pictogrammes, facile à mémoriser, surtout quand on les compare aux 3,000 sinogrammes qu'un élève chinois doit avoir mémorisé avant d'enter au collège, et les 15,000 qu'un étudiant chinois est censé connaître à l'université ! On dit qu'il faut un Dongba 15 ans pour lire couramment l'écriture naxie ; peut-être. Mais si c'est le cas, la façon de l'enseigner semble pédagogiquement aberrante, car les alphabets arabe et perse, avec les lettres changeantes selon leur position initiale, médiane ou finale, les alphabets tamoul ou sanscrit/hindou avec leur coalescence dont le heurt des lettres provoque des transformations,48 n'ont jamais empêché un enfant d'apprendre le chinois, le tamoul, l'hindi, l'arabe, le perse, etc.
Néa nmoins, le problème que pose l'écriture naxie est le pictogramme proprement dit ! En effet, faut-il être un dessinateur ou un artiste pour les reproduire sur papier dans une classe d'enfants pour pouvoir les écrire assez rapidement lors d'une dictée, par exemple ? Un système de simplification serait
47 Mi Chu Wiens, Living Pictographs : Asian Scholar Unlocks Secrets of the Naxi Manuscripts. Ajoutons que pendant la Révolution Culturelle des Cent Fleurs, les gardiens zélés de la révolution glorieuse brûlèrent des milliers des manuscrits naxis malsains et réactionnaires aux idées du bonheur dans le progrès infini.
48 Que les linguistes appellent 'sandhi'.

envisageable sans, néanmoins, déformer les pictogrammes. Au vrai, selon moi, une simplification des pictographes serait complètement inutile. Car voici la preuve que cette écriture naxi vit et vivra tant que la volonté et le désir des Naxis la feront vivre ! En 1999, dans le Yunnan à Lijiang, s'ouvrit la première école primaire de langue naxie, appelée le Huangshan Primary School, d'après ses fondateurs, Huang et son mari Guo, tous deux enseignants du système scolaire chinois. Saturés d'expérience dans les deux langues, après 13 ans de fonctionnement, Huang et Guo ont constaté qu' en trois à six ans d'enseignement bilingue, les enfants naxis et chinois apprennent à peu près 1,000 pictographes ! Tous, à la fin des six années d'apprentissage, étaient capables de lire la genèse de la Création naxie, une centaine d'aphorismes et de traduire la poésie chinoise en naxi ! De cette école pilote, les élèves continuent leurs études naxies dans le lycée bilingue naxi de Lijiang, puis à l'Université du Yunnan pour les Langues des Minorités, 217 d'entr'eux ont préparé des mémoires ou des thèses sur la langue ou la culture naxies. Par ailleurs, depuis 2006, l'école primaire de Xingren dans le district de Yulong (Yunnan) propose des cursus bilingues chinois-naxis, et l'enseignement de l'écriture naxie, en particulier.49 En outre, avec les programmes d'ordinateurs contemporains, des pictogrammes naxis seront parfaitement reproduisibles d'une manière fluide et rapide, voire en couleur ! Préparer un programme de pictogrammes naxi est faisable et même souhaitable et pour les enfants naxis et pour les chercheurs naxis ou étrangers. Et nous voilà parfaitement dans les accents de modernité...Est-il besoin d'avoir recours à l'alphabet latin pour 'éduquer les masses' ?
Quoi qu'il en soit, un autre problème, plus aigu, se pose : l'assimilation par le haut et non par le bas, à savoir la colonisation. C'est vrai que les Chinois s'occupent magistralement de la culture naxie ; ils collectionnent les manuscrits, aident dans les traductions, font construire des bibliothèques, instituts et musées ; cependant, cette aide, certes inestimable, crée également une dépendance anémique : la proximité de la culture chinoise, dominante par sa taille et son Histoire, a tendance à maîtriser le (les) naxi (Naxi), et par conséquent, le/les assujettit. L'identité des Naxis ne doit passer ni par le prisme des Chinois ni du chinois. Et à ce sujet délicat, le titre du livre de Haibo Yu s'avère révélateur : Becoming Chinese with Naxi Identity ! Est-on Naxi parce qu'on est Chinois ? Ou bien est-on Chinois parce qu'on est Naxi ?..L'identité ontologique et existentielle passe par la lettre, miroir de l'être...
Comme parallèle, voici la langue hébreu, renée des cendres d'une Europe anti-sémite, véhiculée par les Sionistes émigrant en Terre Sainte, avant la fondation d'Israël, puis en 1948, officialisée par le gouvernement israélien, car garantie d'une tradition religieuse, donc identitaire depuis la Traversée du Désert.
La langue des Maoris en Nouvelle-Zélande renaquit après des siècles d'oubli d'une administration anglaise, chauvine et supérieure, devenue officielle en 1987 avec l'anglais (et la langue des signes). Il en va de même pour le quechua au Pérou et le nahuatl au Méxique. Il suffit qu'une langue soit enseignée aux enfants pour qu'elle vive vraiment, c'est-à-dire, quotidiennement. Les pictographes naxis, parce que simples à identifier et agréables aux yeux, plaisent aux enfants, et leur offrent un apprentissage aussi routinier qu'aux enfants qui apprennent l'arabe, l'hindi, le chinois ou le tamoul. Ces écoles 'pilotes'
49 Voir à ce sujet, Yu, Haibo, Identity and Schooling among the Naxi : Becoming Chinese with Naxi Identity, éd. Lexington Books, United Kingdom 2010, surtout des chapitres six et sept.

doivent pointer le chemin aux autres écoles primaires, collèges et lycées pour qu'elles deviennent aussi 'routinières' que les écoles publiques ou privées chinoises...
La langue des Cherokie aux Etat-Unis nous en fournit un autre exemple. Son alphabet syllabique, inventé par Sequoyah au début du XIX° siècle, à partir des alphabets cyrillique, latin et grec, non seulement pourvut les Indiens d'une écriture pour apprendre à lire, mais l'élève chérokie apprend à lire en quelques semaines alors que l'Américain apprend à lire avec l'alphabet latin en deux ans !50 De plus, avec cette écriture syllabique l'ensemble de la nation cherokie était désormais capable de communiquer et d'écrire depuis l'Est des Etats-Unis (Caroline du Nord) jusqu'à Arkansaw...Son statut aujourd'hui reste stable et solide : 15 à 20 % de la population chérokie sait lire sa langue, 5 % l'écrit. Il existe des écoles primaires dont la langue d'enseignement est le cherokie, surtout dans la Caroline du Nord. Par ailleurs, elle compte parmi toutes les langues amérindiennes en Amérique du Nord la plus parlée...
Citons aussi la langue vai de la Libérie en Afrique occidentale, fondée en 1832 dont les formes de l'alphabet ressemblent à celles de l'alphabet cherokie. Cette langue est officielle et son alphabet enseigné dans les écoles. De même pour l'écriture Ge'ez en Ethiopie, Erithrea et Amharique, ainsi que l'osmanya dans la Corne d'Afrique et le bamum aux Camérouns, alphabet non-latin fondé en 1918 et le mende kikakui en Sierre Léone, depuis 1850, toutes deux toujours en vigueur dans les écoles primaires.
Quelle que soit l'écriture, si elle est enseignée aux enfants à l'école primaire, leur apprentissage ne pose aucun problème particulier ; ni de quantité de lettres (télégou) ou de signes (chinois), ni les voyelles manquantes (arabe, hébreu, perse) ou l'abondance de consonnes (nahuatl), ni les digraphes ou trigraphes coalescés (tamoul, hindi), ni la direction (hébreu, arabe), etc. Avec toute réserve, l'écriture naxie semble bien plus facile que d'autres formes d'écriture, d'alphabet ou de signes.
Il se peut aussi qu'un deuxième problème se pose ; peut-être le peuple naxi, à cause du monde moderne consumériste, areligieux, ne croit-il plus à ses petits pictographes, imbus de divinité (ou de folklore?)! La fonction du prêtre dongba a perdu son importance, si bien que l'écriture qui reflète cette fonction a aussi affaibli (l'intérêt à l'apprendre). En effet, le jour où tous les Dongbas auront disparu, la langue certes, sera toujours parlée, mais son écriture ? Les quelques écoles citées ci-dessus seront-elles suffisantes pour conserver son intérêt, ou bien faudra-il chercher d'autres fonctions pour réanimer l'écriture dans les écoles ou à la maison, opérer un déplacement d'une fonction du 'sage' au 'peuple', quelle soit communiste ou démocratique ? La calligraphie, réservée à l'élite ne résoud rien : c'est un simple passe-temps. Des milliers et des milliers de manuscrits attestent d'une écriture capable d'exprimer tout aspect de temps, tout concept abstrait et concret, donc toute vision du monde ! Cette écriture alors n'a ni besoin d'une transcription en lettres latines pour les enfants dans leur apprentissage, ni d'une considération objective, institutionnelle, claquemurée dans une bibliothèque, là où sous le regard d'une poignée de spécialistes, l'écriture pâlissant par manque de « chaleur du soleil », de 'joie de la lumière » et de « limpidité de l'eau »51 mourra d'enfermement, de froideur, de taxinomie linguistique,
50 L'alphabet cherokie comprend 85 lettres alors que l'alphabet anglais n'en a que 26.

car sans discours, et ceci en dépit du timide mouvement des enseignants courageux, mais marginalisés dans leurs efforts pédagogiques et linguistiques.
Peut-être aussi, Joseph Rock, malgré son éducation européenne acceptait de comprendre ce que la civilisation occidentale a toujours refusé d'accepter : l'irrationnel ! Cette émotion, intimement liée au passé archaïque, ne devrait pas être confondue avec une simple éjaculation émotive ! Sa présence parmi ce peuple, son vécu dans le présent avec eux, lui fit comprendre que l'irrationnel, tout comme le passé archaïque, devait être intégré par le présent, et non pas marginalisé pour le rendre superficiel, caduc. Il s'agissait d'une véritable Révélation ! Rock fit l'expérience du peuple archaïque, expérience ontologique parce qu'il sut que rien en nous n'est effacé, et qu'en nous coexiste passé et présent...archaïque et moderne. Et c'est l'expérience de la Présence qui nous apprend cela ; expérience qui ouvre l'Etre à l'Autre, qui prépare le terrain à un Partage authentique...Or, l'écran n'est pas aussi épais entre Rock et nous ; il suffit de jauger le Passé à l'aune du Présent, et pour cela la Présence est requise...
Le patrimoine des Naxis n'est ni exclusivement dans les mains des Chinois ni dans celles des opportunistes Occidentaux, mais dans les leurs pour organiser leur écriture ancienne et vivante, selon une société qu'ils doivent construire par et pour eux-mêmes. Si les puissances technocrates conviennent les Naxis à la passivité, ils devront rejeter cette invitation honteuse. Or il n'existe aucune écriture 'dépassée', incapable de s'adapter aux besoins d'une société moderne.52 L'identité naxie en dépend, sinon cette identité deviendra ce qu'elle n'est pas, à savoir, un objet de musée, semblable à ce que deviennent certaines traitées par les linguistes formalistes...
Il suffit d'un peu d'imagination, et surtout d'une saine autonomie culturelle pour pouvoir procéder à cette adaptation nécessaire, à cette identité ontologique et existentielle. Que les Naxis aient survécu à la destruction des nations sans Etat relève d'un miracle : désormais, c'est leur écriture, mémoire et vision du monde, qui doivent échapper aux leurres d'une ouverture au 'monde moderne' par l'adaptation à des signes ou des alphabets plus maniables sur le marché du travail, plus appropriés aux besoins globaux, plus assortis aux exigences mondiales qui rejettent les micro-économies, la politique autonome...les ghettos linguistiques...
Rester sujet maître de sa langue-écriture, et non sujet-servile, créé par des concepts extérieurs au sujetconcept, par exemple, folklorique, scientifique ou pseudo-scientifique, arriéré, ghetto-linguistique,53 etc., s'exprime par l'investissement ou engagement des Naxis à tracer leur propre destin. Ce destin requiert un discours sur leur propre langue-écriture ; un discours ni chinois ni occidental : religieux : dongba,
52 Il est intéressant de constater que dans le monde, c'est la Chine, la Russie, l'Inde et d'une manière plus timide, l'Iran qui ont entamé une dynamique économique,culturelle et militaire. Ces quatre civilisations écrivent avec des lettres ou signes non-latins! Il n'y a aucune corrélation entre un système d'écriture et le progrès éducatif, économique ou social...
53 Ainsi le judéo-espagnol fut-il conceptualisé à Istanbul, d'abord à la fin du XIX° siècle par les enseignants du français de l'Alliance Israëlite dont la langue française fit office d'échappatoire aux juifs du ghetto linguistique ; puis tout au long du XX° siècle par le poids de la langue turque, de l'inertie de la communauté juive d'Istanbul, des exigences de la langue anglaise, et pour ceux qui émigraient en Israël, de l'hébreu. Aujourd'hui, le judéo-espagnol à Istanbul reste une sorte de langue nostalgique, un souvenir historique d'une communauté dynamique, exilée de l'Espagne médiévale, et replantée sur le sol ottoman au XV° siècle, où peu à peu, elle fana sous le poids de la rose enivrante ottomane...

athée, bouddhiste...lequel ? Economique : communiste, autarcique, capitaliste...globaliste...lequel ? Politique : assimilé ou autonome...lequel ? Sociologique : masse agraire pauvre, immigré dans les grandes villes...lequel ?
De même qu'une langue ne se réalise que dans et par son discours, un peuple ne se réalise pleinement que dans et par son écriture qu'il assume et non qu'il subit ; une écriture qui lui est propre ! Or tout Naxi...tout homme, est un sujet du sens, un sujet en relation avec d'autres hommes-sujets, non réductible aux réseaux globalisants d'objet vide, de statistique commerciale, d'être aliéné parce qu'inconscient de son propre destin.
Revenir à la langue-écriture, à sa langue-forme, c'est revenir aux hommes et non à l'Homme, concept vide, vidé des hommes...
MIRABILE, Paul: Inquiry into the Naxi People of Southwest China
The Archaic and the Modern
Homage to Joseph Rock
During his five-year sojourn in China, the author, travelling through Southern China along the borders of Laos and Burma, discovered the existence of the Naxi people in the region of Xishuangbanna in the Province of Yunnan. There he came to realize that the Naxi people, although Sinoized, still wrote with their pictographic scripture, the last in use in the world. The author also discovered that an American botaniste, Joseph Rock, working for the National Geographic Magazine had lived with the Naxi people in the 1920's, 30's and 40's, and had learnt their languge and customs, had translated their prayer and storybooks.
The author's curiosity, stirred by this ancient and marvellous scripture, and by Rock's extraordinary adventure, decided to study the pictographic scripture, which he did for two years at Beijing. Having found Joseph Rock's article written for National Geographic in 1924, after ten years of relentless searching, in the present article he has combined Rock's ethnologic and linguistic research with his own by alternating between Rock's report translated from the English and his own analyses of Rock's writings gauged by two years of work on the Naxi scripture. By this alternating rhythm between the Past and the Present, between Rock's fascinating account and the author's observations of the Naxi scripture, conjoined, too, with recent research and pedagogical experimentation by today's scholars of the Naxi people, both Chinese and Western, the author hopes to convince his readers of the vital necessity to conserve this dangerously declining scripture, not, however, as some museum showcase trinket or bibelot, nor as a quaint or odd option on a syllabus of folklore studies, but as a modern, living scripture that must be taught to Naxi children in public schools, supported by bilingual programmes which, academically structured, lead students to university levels where further research, lecturing and

translation can be carried out, where the Naxi scripture, uncontaminated by 'pin-yin' ruse or 'latinized' subterfuge, will continue to bloom, written in more wider circles than religious, in more expansive fields than agrarian or environmental.
To accomplish this an alert and steady consciousness or awareness is required, linguistic and ethnic...historical and didactic. It is, thus, up to the Naxi people themselves to determine their Destiny ; a Naxi Destiny that does indeed favour Chinese aid and assistance. Advocates who labour to forge a solid Naxi scriptural future, be they Naxi or Chinese, who if they indeed condemn assimilation on the grounds of causing monolingualism, and consequently the slow but steady disappearance of the Naxi scripture, do, however, support integration as a means to promote bilingualism, and hence biculturalism. It is not contradictory to comprehend the integration of the Naxi people into the Chinese social fabric, and there found their identity with the Chinese by learning both the Naxi and the Chinese scriptures and languages. Bilingual schools have been founded on this very basic existential principle.
Integration may then be the Royal Road to biculturalism between Naxi and Chinese, a road that hopefully will enlarge the users of the Naxi scripture, the readers and writers of Naxi literature. In his conclusion, the author compares other non-Latinized scriptures of Africa, North America and Asia taught to millions of children today to defend the linguistic right of scriptural difference ; a right that cannot be severed from the ontic make-up of an individual within his or her community.
Scriptural identity is a means to existence because scriptural identity springs and flows from the Fount of Being...
