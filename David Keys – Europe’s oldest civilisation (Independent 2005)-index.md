Europe’s oldest civilisation
di David Keys | ⋮ 5-6 minutes ⋮ 2000. 01. 01.
Archaeologists have discovered Europe’s oldest civilisation, a network of dozens of temples, 2,000 years older
than Stonehenge and the Pyramids.
More than 150 gigantic monuments have been located beneath the fields and cities of modern-day Germany,
Austria and Slovakia. They were built 7,000 years ago, between 4800BC and 4600BC. Their discovery, revealed
today by The Independent, will revolutionise the study of prehistoric Europe, where an appetite for monumental
architecture was thought to have developed later than in Mesopotamia and Egypt.
In all, more than 150 temples have been identified. Constructed of earth and wood, they had ramparts and
palisades that stretched for up to half a mile. They were built by a religious people who lived in communal
longhouses up to 50 metres long, grouped around substantial villages. Evidence suggests their economy was
based on cattle, sheep, goat and pig farming.
Their civilisation seems to have died out after about 200 years and the recent archaeological discoveries are so
new that the temple building culture does not even have a name yet.
Excavations have been taking place over the past few years – and have triggered a re-evaluation of similar,
though hitherto mostly undated, complexes identified from aerial photographs throughout central Europe.
Archaeologists are now beginning to suspect that hundreds of these very early monumental religious centres,
each up to 150 metres across, were constructed across a 400-mile swath of land in what is now Austria, the
Czech Republic, Slovakia, and eastern Germany.
The most complex excavated so far – located inside the city of Dresden – consisted of an apparently sacred
internal space surrounded by two palisades, three earthen banks and four ditches.
The monuments seem to be a phenomenon associated exclusively with a period of consolidation and growth that
followed the initial establishment of farming cultures in the centre of the continent.
It is possible that the newly revealed early Neolithic monument phenomenon was the consequence of an
increase in the size of – and competition between – emerging Neolithic tribal or pan-tribal groups, arguably
Europe’s earliest mini-states.
After a relatively brief period – perhaps just one or two hundred years – either the need or the socio-political
ability to build them disappeared, and monuments of this scale were not built again until the Middle Bronze Age,
3,000 years later. Why this monumental culture collapsed is a mystery.
The archaeological investigation into these vast Stone Age temples over the past three years has also
revealed several other mysteries. First, each complex was only used for a few generations – perhaps 100 years
maximum. Second, the central sacred area was nearly always the same size, about a third of a hectare. Third,
each circular enclosure ditch – irrespective of diameter – involved the removal of the same volume of earth. In
other words, the builders reduced the depth and/or width of each ditch in inverse proportion to its diameter, so as
to always keep volume (and thus time spent) constant.



Archaeologists are speculating that this may have been in order to allow each earthwork to be dug by a set
number of special status workers in a set number of days – perhaps to satisfy the ritual requirements of some
sort of religious calendar.
The multiple bank, ditch and palisade systems “protecting” the inner space seem not to have been built for
defensive purposes – and were instead probably designed to prevent ordinary tribespeople from seeing the
sacred and presumably secret rituals which were performed in the “inner sanctum“.
The investigation so far suggests that each religious complex was ritually decommissioned at the end of its life,
with the ditches, each of which had been dug successively, being deliberately filled in.
“Our excavations have revealed the degree of monumental vision and sophistication used by these early farming
communities to create Europe’s first truly large scale earthwork complexes,” said the senior archaeologist, Harald
Staeuble of the Saxony state government’s heritage department, who has been directing the archaeological
investigations. Scientific investigations into the recently excavated material are taking place in Dresden.
The people who built the huge circular temples were the descendants of migrants who arrived many centuries
earlier from the Danube plain in what is now northern Serbia and Hungary. The temple-builders were pastoralists,
controlling large herds of cattle, sheep and goats as well as pigs. They made tools of stone, bone and wood, and
small ceramic statues of humans and animals. They manufactured substantial amounts of geometrically
decorated pottery, and they lived in large longhouses in substantial villages.
One village complex and temple at Aythra, near Leipzig, covers an area of 25 hectares. Two hundred
longhouses have been found there. The population would have been up to 300 people living in a highly
organised settlement of 15 to 20 very large communal buildings.
