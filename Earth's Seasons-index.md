The table below provides the computed times of the beginning of the seasons as well as Earth's perihelion and aphelion. The times of the equinoxes mark the beginning of spring and fall. The times of the solstices mark the beginning of summer and winter. Definitions of these terms can be found in The Astronomical Almanac Online glossary.
Variation in Times of Perihelion and Aphelion explains why the times of these events appear to vary more than those of the others while The Seasons and the Earth's Orbit discusses how all of these phenomena relate.
NOTE: In the tables, d, h, m indicate day, hour, and minute, respectively, of Universal Time.
