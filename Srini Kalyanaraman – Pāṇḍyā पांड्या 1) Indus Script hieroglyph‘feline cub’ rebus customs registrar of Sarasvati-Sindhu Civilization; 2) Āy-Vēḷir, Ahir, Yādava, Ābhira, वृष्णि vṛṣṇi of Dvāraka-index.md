The guardian king belongs to one of the eight catagories of Buddhist beings: that of the heavenly musicians (gandharva). One can identify this statue as such because of its wild beast headdress. Technically perfect, this bronze Korean statue is unique today. The inscription on the base dates it to the "Rooster Year," without specifying the reference era. Comparing it to paintings featuring the same style and theme found in the Turfan Oasis of China's Xinjiang Province, experts can date it to the end of Unified Silla (668-918 CE) or the 9th century CE.

Rekha Rao notes: “Vratyas were distinguished by their black turbans (Krishnam Ushnisham Dharayanti) worn in a slanting manner, displaying long matted hair (Kesi). This is depicted in seals as long Snake like head decoration. Atop was the buds of plants attached; a set of round ornaments for the ears (Pravartau). Varieties of neck ornaments were hanging by the neck across the chest with rows of long necklaces of Strange beads (mani) Swinging. Two (dvi) deer-skins were tied together for lower garment, (displayed as a long piece of skin tied around the waist, that was extracted from the animal), and sandals for the feet (Upanahau). They carried a lance called Pra-toda. A white blanket was thrown across the shoulders. The Vratyas spoke the dialect of Prachya, the source of the languages of ancient Eastern India. It is also said; the Vratyas also spoke the language of the initiated (Dikshita – vac), though not themselves initiated (Adikshita), however, also used that which is easy to utter (a- durukta) and difficult to utter. (Panchavinsa Brahmana 17.1.9). This may mean that the Vratyas were familiar and comfortable both in Sanskrit and in Prakrit. Vratyas did not use refined Vedic dialect in their speech nor hired a priest of evolved class to guide their rituals. They lived alone or in groups, away from populated areas. They followed their own Cult rules and practises... Panchavinsh Brahmana 17.1.9-15 further states that the Vratya leader wore a turban (usinisha), carried a whip (Pratoda), a kind of bow (Jyadroda, also called Pinaka), was clothed in a black (Krsnasa) garment and two skins (Ajina), black and white (Krishna-Valaksa), and owned a rough wagon (Vipatha) covered with planks (Phalakastirna). The others, followers of the group or subordinate to the leader, had garments with fringes of red (Valukantani Dam Atusam)... The Atharvaveda 15.2 makes a very ambiguous statement: “Of him in the eastern quarter, faith is the harlot, Mitra the Magadha, discrimination is the garment, etc”. Probably, it is taken to mean that the Magadha tribes (The area of present day Bihar, South of Ganges) were friends, advisers, and thunder (strong Supporters) of the Vratyas. The implication of this is rather interesting. The breakaway group, the Vratyas from among the Vedic people, left their main land of the basin of Indus river and moved away eastwards.” – Rekha Rao
If garments worn defined the identity of groups of people, it is reasonable to infer that the
word पाांड्या pāṇḍyā refers to a particular type of garment worn by the group who were
referred to as पाांड्या pāṇḍyā. Gardez MahāVināyaka pratimā wears a पाांड्या pāṇḍyā garment
signified by पाांड्या pāṇḍyā ‘feline cub’.

These are the artisans of alloy metalwork and cire perdue (lostwax) casting who moved from the Sarasvati-Sindhu River basins to continue their cire perdue technology in Swamimalai where the presiding divinity is called Eraka Subrahmanya. Eraka means ‘metal infusion, moltencast’ method used to make bronze and pancaloha alloy metal Pratima of divinities like Ganesa, Krsna, Nataraja.

If you ask who they are, they are his daughters, he who granted cities to those who came in need and earned great fame for gifting a chariot to the jasmine vine to climb, he who owned elephants with jingling bells, the lord of Parampu, the great king Pāri.

Irunkovel is supposed to be 49th generation of a king from (Thuvarai) Dwaraka. It can mean two things. Assuming about 30 years per generation, 1500 years earlier Dwaraka which had walls made of copper. Dating the early phase of Sarasvati-Sindhu civilization to ca. 3500 BCE, and the submergence of Dwaraka to ca. 1900 BCE (a date indicative of the drying up of Vedic River Sarasvati due to migrations of Sutlej and Yamuna rivers which were tributaries bringing in glacier waters), which necessitated the movements of Sarasvati's children down the coastline to Kerala, this text places Sangam literature text of Purananuru to ca. 400 BCE.

Migration from Tuvarai (Dwaraka) is attested in a 12th century inscription (Pudukottai State inscriptions, No. 120) cited by Avvai S. Turaicaami in Puranaanuru, II (SISSW Publishing Soc., Madras, 1951).

Āyar kolundu ‘the tender sprout of the cowherd clan’ Inscription of Kulottunga CholaI, dated to 1085 CE in Srirangam temple registers gift of lands by an army commander Āyar kolundu Cakrapani to recite Tiruppavai and Tiruvāymoli in the temple.
Another expression used in inscriptions is: Āyar kula anivilakku, ‘the leading light of the cowherd community’.
Parthivasekarapuram inscription of Kokkurunandakkan – the Āy ruler -- claims that he belonged to the line of the Yādavas or Āyar. People of mullai region were called āyars, koyalars and idayars. Tolkappiyam names the presiding deity of mullai region as Māyon, i.e. Kṛṣṇa or visnu. Āyars were also called pothuvar, i.e. common people.
“Āy-Vēḷirs and Kṛṣṇa. Another important line of chieftains of Tamilnadu during the Sangam period with whom Kṛṣṇa was intimately associated was the Āy-Vēḷir. The cowherds were known as āyar in Tamil even as they are known as Ahirs and Abhiras in North India. Tradition sāys that the Ahirs in the Pandya country came to Tamilakam along with the ancestors of the Pandyas (KLT, verse 104:4-6). Potiya mountain region was known as Āykuḍi. The capital of that region is also called Āy-kkuḍi. In his commentary on the prefatory sutra to the Tolkappiyam, Nacchinarkiniyar describes a tradition relating to the migration of the Yādava race as follows: The sage Agastya repaired to Dwaraka and taking with him 18 kings of the line of Kṛṣṇa, 18 families of Vēḷs or Vēḷirs and others, moved to the South with the Aruvalar tribes. There, he had the forests cleared and built up kingdoms settling therein all the people had brought with him. Kapila, a poet probably of the 2nd century CE, addresses the reigning Vēḷir chief as the 49th in descendance from the original founder of that dynasty. M. Srinivasa Iyengar points out that allowing the usual 25 years for each generation, the above kingdom must have been established about BCE 1075 and this māy be assumed as the probable date of the migration of the Āy Vēḷirs to South India. There are many Vēḷir chiefs in the Tamil country during the Sangam period. They had ‘Āy’ as a prefix or a suffix to their names, such as ‘Āy-andiran’ and ‘Vēḷ-Āy’. The latter had his capital in Āy-kuḍi and ruled the Potiya region. Many Sangam poets have glorified his bravery and charitable qualities...M. Raghava Iyengar held that the popularity of the worship of Kṛṣṇa in the ancient Tamilakam might be partly due to the influence of the Vēḷirs who are often referred to in the Sangam works. He has clearly shown that the Vēḷirs referred to in the Sangam works belonged to the 18 kuḍi-Vēḷirs of the descendants of the Yadu-kula to which Kṛṣṇa also belonged, and that the Vēḷirs migrated from Dw ḍrapati, and settled in different parts of South India. The Āy-Vēḷir kings of later period also mention in their copper plate charters that they belonged to the Yadu-kula of Kṛṣṇa (pp.33-34). Excerpts Source: https://tinyurl.com/y2hssc5k from T.

"Seated male sculpture, or "Priest King" from Mohenjo-daro. Fillet or ribbon headband with
circular inlay ornament on the forehead and similar but smaller ornament on the right upper
arm. The two ends of the fillet fall along the back and though the hair is carefully combed

towards the back of the head, no bun is present. The flat back of the head may have held a
separately carved bun as is traditional on the other seated figures, or it could have held a more
elaborate horn and plumed headdress. Two holes beneath the highly stylized ears suggest that
a necklace or other head ornament was attached to the sculpture. The left shoulder is covered
with a cloak decorated with trefoil, double circle and single circle designs that were originally
filled with red pigment. Drill holes in the center of each circle indicate they were made with a
specialized drill and then touched up with a chisel. Eyes are deeply incised and may have
held inlay. The upper lip is shaved and a short combed beard frames the face. The large crack
in the face is the result of weathering or it may be due to original firing of this
object.Material: white, low fired steatite

The Bactrian vase shows floating figures of seated men wearing tārpya garment which signifies the seated men to be manes. The presence of a fire-altar and an octagonal pillar in Binjor (Anupgarh) on the banks of River Sarasvati signifies the performance of a yajna. The presence of a seal with Indus Script signifying metalwork catalogues, wealth-accounting ledger attests to this archaeological site to be a Veda cultural site of ca. 2500 BCE. (तृपा f.

“Ardeeeleanu-Jansen’s Reconstruction. Ardeleanu-Jansen has recreated an interesting reconstruction of the priest-king as a statue of a seated man with his left leg raised and bent at the knee...This is a posture assumed by other statuary found at Mohenjo-daro; one of which I have named the ‘Seated Man’, another, the ‘Sad Man’, as well as figures from Bactria... Parpola's thoughts. A. Parpola attempts to demonstrate that the robe of the priest-king is something called the tārpya, found in Vedic ritual and said to be the garment of the divine king Varuna. Parpola postulates that this statue is a representation of a seated deity, which had an elaborate, changeable headdress of the type he proposes is found on the Mahayogi seal...The Seated Man (L-950). A headless seated male statue made of gray alabaster was found by Mackay at L Area on the southern half of the mound of the Great Bath. It has been attributed to the Late Period ...This is the one statue from Mohenjo-daro that clearly is seated and costumed in the same manner as those seen in Bactrian art (Figure 8), and the pose has been proposed by Ardeleanu-Jansen for the priest-king. This admits the possibility that the Mohenjo-daro representations are of Bactrians. The men on the Bactrian vase are ‘floating’ in the sky above other men behind plows being pulled by Bos Taurus, not the Indian zebu. Everyone looks perfectly at home. Of course, the dress could be Harappan and the Bactrian vase could represent ‘Harappans’ floating in the sky above the plowmen. But nowhere else in the art of the Mature Harappan do we find this form of dress, so the balance tips a bit toward the notion that the Seated Man from L Area, and the priest-king, if Ardeleanu-Jansen is correct, represent Bactrians at Mohenjo-daro in the Late Period there. This might be late enough to somehow figure in the contacts between the Indus Civilization and the BactriaMargiana-Archaeological Complex, and the Middle Asian Interaction sphere.” (Gregory L. Possehl, 2002,The Indus Civilization: A Contemporary Perspective, Rowman Altamira, 11Nov-2002, pp.115-116).

Significant contributions made by Pāṇṭiya kings and scholars
One of the early coins of the Pandyas showing their emblem of the two fishes.
A modern illustration of the Pandya flag (early historic, approximate)” Epic poem Silappatikaram mentions that the emblem of the Pandyas was that of a fish.”( Nākacāmi, Irāmaccantiran̲ (1978). Studies in Ancient Tamil Law and Society. Institute of Epigraphy, State Department of Archaeology, Government of Tamilnadu. p. 52.) North Indian traditions such as the Great Epics and the Puranas often associate southern India with Sage Agastya (who crossed the Vindhyas and travelled south). Agastya appears prominently in medieval Tamil literature also. (Karashima, Noburu. 2014. 'Beginnings of South Indian History', in A Concise History of South India: Issues and Interpretations, ed. Noburu Karashmia, pp. 25–26. New Delhi: Oxford University Press.)
Fish is a dominant hieroglyph on Indus Script Corpora and signified a wealth resource of metalwork. Ayo ‘fish’ rebus: ayas ‘alloy metal’ aya ‘iron’.
Pandya kings claimed Pururavas and Nahusha as ancestors.(Irā Nākacāmi, Irāmaccantiran̲ Nākacāmi. Art and Culture of Tamil Nadu. Sundeep Prakashan, 1980. p. 2.) Pururavas is listed as one of the ancestors in the Velvikudi inscription of Nedunchadaiyan Varagunavarman.(H. K. Sastri (1983). "Velvikudi Grant of Nedunjadaiyan". Epigraphia Indica. 17. Archaeological Survey of India. p. 305.)

Pāṇṭiya Empire (12th–14th century CE) “The country of the Pandyas finds mention in a number of Graeco-Roman sources (as early as 4th century BCE... and the edicts Maurya emperor Asoka (3rd century BCE).”( Vincent, William (1805). The Periplus of the Erythrean Sea. Cadell and Davies. p. 403.) ...
In his inscriptions (2nd and 13th Major Rock Edict-- Karashima, Noburu. 2014. 'Beginnings of South Indian History', in A Concise History of South India: Issues and Interpretations, ed. Noburu Karashmia, pp. 26–27. New Delhi: Oxford University Press) -- Asoka refers to the peoples of south India – the Cholas, Keralaputras, Pandyas and Satiyaputras. These polities, although not part of the Maurya empire, were on friendly terms with Asoka:
The conquest by dharma has been won here, on the borders, and even six hundred yojanas (5,400–9,600 km) away, where the Greek king Antiochos rules, beyond there where the four kings named Ptolemy, Antigonos, Magas and Alexander rule, likewise in the south among the Cholas, the Pandyas, and as far as Tamraparni river. (S. Dhammika, The Edicts of King Ashoka: An English Rendering Buddhist Publication Society, Kandy (1994)
The earliest Pandya to be found in epigraph is Nedunjeliyan, figuring in the TamilBrahmi Mangulam inscription (near Madurai) assigned to 3rd and 2nd centuries BCE.
“Mangulam inscription (3rd and 2nd centuries BCE). The record documents a gift of rock-cut beds, to a Jain ascetic. It is assumed that the people found in the Mangulam inscription, Nedunjeliyan, Kadalan, and Izhanchadikan predates rulers such as Talaiyanganam Nedunjelyan and Palyaga-salai Mudukudimi Peruvaludi. Kharavela, the Kalinga king who ruled during c. 1st century BCE, in his Hathigumpha inscription, claims to have destroyed an old confederacy of Tamil countries ("the tamira–desa–sanghata") which had lasted 132 years, and to have acquired a large quantity of pearls from the Pandyas.
“The famous inscription of king Kharavela at Hathigumpha (mid-first century BCE[8]) mentions the defeat of a confederacy of the "Tramira" countries which had been a threat to Kalinga. It also remembers the precious pearls brought to the capital as booty from the "Pandya" realm. The Pandya chiefdom was famous for its pearl fisheries and silk



18
industry.Korkai and Alagankulam are believed to have been the exchange centres of the Pandyas. Korkai, a port at the mouth of the river Tambraparni, was linked to the famous pearl fisheries and Alagankulam was also developed as a port.
“Silver punch-marked coins with the fish symbol of the Pandyas dating from around the same time have also been found. (Champakalakshmi, Radha (1996). Trade, ideology, and urbanization: South India 300 BC to AD 1300. Oxford University Press. p. 123; Subbarayalu, Y. 2014. 'Early Tamil Polity', in A Concise History of South India: Issues and Interpretations, ed. Noburu Karashmia, pp. 48–49. New Delhi: Oxford University Press.)
“Early Tamil poems refers to about twelve Pandya rulers.(Subbarayalu, Y. 2014. 'Early Tamil Polity', in A Concise History of South India: Issues and Interpretations, ed. Noburu Karashmia, pp. 47–48. New Delhi: Oxford University Press.) Sangams ("the Academies") were held in Madurai under the patronage of the Pandyas. Several Tamil literary works, such as Iraiyanar Agapporul, mention the legend of three separate Sangams and ascribe their patronage to the Pandyas. The Pandyas are also celebrated in the earliest available Tamil poetry ("the Sangam literature"). Greek and Latin accounts (early centuries CE), coins with legends in Tamil-Brahmi script, and Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions suggest the continuity of the Pandya dynasty from the 3rd century BCE to early centuries CE... Pandya rulers – such as Nedunjeliyan, the Victor of Talaiyalanganam, and Mudukudimi Peruvaludi, the Patron of Several Sacrificial Halls ("the Palyaga-salai") – find mention in a number of poems (such as Mathuraikkanci). (Subbarayalu, Y. 2014. 'Early Tamil Polity', in A Concise History of South India: Issues and Interpretations, ed. Noburu Karashmia, pp. 47–48. New Delhi: Oxford University Press) ... “Beside several short poems found in the Akananuru and the Purananuru collections, there are two major works – Mathuraikkanci and Netunalvatai which give a glimpse into the society and commercial activities in the Pandya country during the early historic period.
“The Purananuru and Akananuru collections contain poems sung in praise of various Pandya rulers and also poems that were claimed to be composed by the rulers themselves. Besides the poems, king Peruvaludi is also mentioned in later copper-plate grant (8th–9th century CE). In the work Mathuraikkanci, the author Mankudi Maruthanar, refers to his patron, Talaihalanganum Nedunjeliyan, as the Lord of Korkai and the Warlord of the Southern Parathavar People (Then Parathavar por yere). It contains a full-length description of Madurai and the Pandya country under the rule of Nedunjeliyan. In the famous battle of Talaiyalanganam (in east Tanjore), the Pandya is said to have defeated his enemies (which included the Chera and the Chola). He is also praised for his victory of Mizhalai and Mutturu, two "vel" centres along the ocean (in Pudukkottai). The Netunalvatai (in the collection of Pattupattu) by Nakkirar contains a description of king Nedunjeliyan's palace.” https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandya_dynasty

• “Foreign source. Pandyas are also mentioned by Greek author Megasthenes (4th century BCE) where he writes about south Indian kingdom being ruled by women. He described the Pandya country in Indika as "occupying the portion of India which lies southward and extends to the sea". According to his account, the kingdom had 365 villages, each of which was expected to meet the needs of the royal household for one day in the year. He described the Pandya queen at the time, Pandaia as the daughter of Herakles. • Pliny the Elder refers to the Pandya ruler of Madurai in general terms (first century CE). • The author of the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea (first century CE) describes the riches of a "Pandian kingdom" ...Nelcynda is distant from Muziris by river and sea about five hundred stadia, and is of another kingdom, the Pandian. This place [Nelcynda] also is situated on a river, about one hundred and twenty stadia from the [Arabian] sea....
• The country of the Pandyas was described as Pandya Mediterranea and Modura Regia Pandionis by Ptolemy (c. 140 CE). • Strabo states that an Indian king called Pandion sent Augustus Caesar "presents and gifts of honour". The 1st-century Greek historian Nicolaus of Damascus met, at Antioch, the ambassador sent by a king from India "named Pandion or, according to others, Porus" to Caesar Augustus around 13 CE (Strabo XV.4 and 73). • The Roman emperor Julian received an embassy from a Pandya about 361 CE.[7] • Chinese historian Yu Huan in his 3rd-century CE text, the Weilüe, mentions the Panyue kingdom: ...the kingdom of Panyue is also called Hanyuewang. It is several thousand li to the southeast of Tianzhu (northern India)...The inhabitants are small; they are the same height as the Chinese...
Scholar John E. Hill identified Panyue as Pandya kingdom. However, others have identified it with an ancient state located in modern Burma or Assam.
• The Chinese traveler Xuanzang mentions a kingdom further south from Kanchipuram, a kingdom named Malakutta, identified with Madurai described by his Buddhist friends at Kanchipuram. • In the later part of the 13th century (in 1288 and 1293 CE) Venetian traveller Marco Polo visited the Pandya kingdom and left a vivid description of the land and its people.
The darkest man is here the most highly esteemed and considered better than the others who are not so dark. Let me add that in very truth these people portray and depict their gods and their idols black and their devils white as snow. For they say that god and all the saints are black and the devils are all white. That is why they portray them as I have described. (Layers of blackness: colourism in the African diaspora, Deborah Gabriel) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandya_dynasty
”The Pandyas were very close allies of the Sinhalese and they often deposited their crowns and other royal insignia with the Sinhalese king for safe-keeping.The Pandyas (1216–1345) entered their "golden age" under Maravarman Sundara I and Jatavarman Sundara I (c. 1251), who expanded the empire into the Telugu country (as far north as Nellore), south Kerala and conquered Sri Lanka. The Pandyas of Ucchangi (9th–13th century), in the Tungabhadra
Valley were related to the Pandyas of Madurai.( Karashima, Noburu. 2014. 'The Fall of the Old States', in A Concise History of South India: Issues and Interpretations, ed. Noburu
Karashima, pp. 172–73. New Delhi: Oxford University Press.)... According to tradition, the



20
legendary Sangams ("the Academies") were held in Madurai under the patronage of the Pandyas, and some of the Pandya rulers claim to be poets themselves. The Pandya country was home to a number of renowned temples including Meenakshi Temple in Madurai. After the revival of the Pandya power by Kadungon, the Shaivite nayanars and the Vaishnavite alvars rose to prominence. It is known that the Pandya rulers followed Jainism for a short period of time in history.( A. Soundaram (2011). "The Characteristic Features of Early Medieval Tamil Society". In S. Ganeshram; C.

Rekha Rao has suggested (29 April 2019) that Mohenjo-Daro priest was Performing Raajasooya Yajna. She also notes that he can be identified as a king by the distinct ornament



23
on his forehead and arm symbolizing his kingly status and the blanket or Kambala, also called “Pandva” in Sanskrit at unction ceremony (Katyayana Srauta sutra (KŚS), XV.5.12) that is worn over his lower Tarpya dress.
KŚS XV.5.7 tārpyam paridhāpayati ‘he maked (the king) put on the tārpya garment
Kaṭha-Samhitā 12.3: utsange pātrāṇi opyaitadrūpam k ̥rtvā yat tārpyāṇi viṣīvyanti ‘The yajna ran away from the Asuras. After having put the (yajna) vessels into the pouched fold (of his garment) and (thereby) having made (for himself) that form into which they embroider the tārpya garments’.
Maitrāyaṇi Samhitā 2.4.5 also says: yat tārpyāṇi viṣīvyanti, yajuṣām tad rūpam “(cloth) In that they embroider tārpya garments, that is the symbol of the muttered prayers (of the Yajurveda, pronounced by the adhvaryu, the priest who mainly performs the yajna: the other two other kinds of gifts are identified with the sacrificial songs and recitations of the Vedas.” Root sīv ‘to sew or stitch (onto or together), embroider’; root vi ‘apart’; this signifies that the embroidery is done with decorations apart from each other. (vigrathitam bhavati ‘tied, joined’ – Āpasthamba Śrauta Sūtra 22.16.3)
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 5.3.5.20 to 24: ‘He then makes him (the king) put on garments. There is that one called tārpya; therein are wrought all forms of yajna: that he makes him put on, with (the mantra VS 10.8). ‘Thou art the inner caul of knighthood (kṣatra)!’ He thus causes him to be born from out of what is the inner caul (amnion) of knighthood (athainam vāsāmsi paridhāpayati; tat tārpyam iti vāso bhavati; tasmin sarvāṇi yajnarupāṇi niṣyutāni bhavanti; tad enam paridhāpayati kṣatrsyolbam asiti; tad yad eva kṣatrasylbam tata evainam etaj janayati). 21. He then makes him put on one of undyed wool (pāṇḍvā), with, ‘Thou art the outer caul of knighthood!’ He thus causes him to be born from what is the outer caul (chorion) of knighthood. 22. He then throws over the mantle (adhivāsa), with, ‘Thou art the womb of knighthood!’ He thus causes him to be born from what is the womb of knighthood. 23. He then draws the head-band (uṣṇīṣa) together, and conceals it (tucks it under) in front, with ‘Thou art the navel of knighthood!’ He thus places him in what is the navel of knighthood. 24. Now some wind it quite round about (the navel) saying, ‘that (band) is his navel, and this navel goes all round.’ But let him not do this, but let him merely tuck it under in front, for this navel is in front. And as to why he makes him put on the garments; - he thereby causes him to be born, thinking, ‘I will anoint him when born’: that is why he makes him put on the garments.’ (Trans. Eggeling 1894: III, 85-87). Thus, tārpya was an undergarment worn next to the skin; this tārpya was beneath a dress called pāṇḍvā or pāṇḍara (MS 4.4.3: 360,17) ‘ (made of) whitish (wool)’. Above pāṇḍvā was an ‘overcloth’ (adhivāsas); on the head was a turban.
Thus, Gardez MahāVināyaka is wearing a pāṇḍvā worn over the hip and upper thighs.
HŚS = Hlranyakeśi-Śrautasūtra (= Satyãṣãḍha-Śrautasūtra) 17.6.31 specifies the meaning ‘circles’ by adding the expression: tasmin tārpye dhiṣṇiyānām rūpam vigrathitam bhavati ‘tārpya garment is decorated with images of the dhiṣṇyas (i.e. probably a series of circles’ is the explanatory translation (provided by Heesterman, J.C., 1957, The ancient Indian royal

Thus trefoil made up of three dotted circles, represents three dhiṣṇya-s. What are the three dhiṣṇya-s ‘fires’? The three dhiṣṇya-s are three vedi-s dedicated to the purification of tridhātu, 'three minerals': each of the three dedicated to purify gold, silver, copper. Hence, the circles metal disks used to embroider the garment of the investiture ceremony signify the purified dhatu produced in three dhiṣṇya-s. धिांष्ण्य अतिः । इत्यमरः । ३ । ३ । १५४ ॥ (यथा अथयर्व् -वेदे । २ । ३५ । १ ।“ये भक्षयन्तो न वसून्यानृधुय्यायनियो अन्वतन्तर्प् तधष्ण्ाः ॥”)शष्णक्तः । इतत मेतदनी । ये, ३४ ॥ (उल्का -भेदः । यथा, बृहांत्सतहतायाम् । ३३ । १ ।“तदतवभुक्तशुभफलानाां पतताां रपातण यातन ताुन्यल्काः ।तधष्ण्ोल्काशतनतवद् युिारा इतत पञ्चधा तभन्नाः ॥”प्राणातभमानी देवः । यथा, ऋेग्वदे । ३ । २२ । ३ ।“अिे ! तदवो अणयमच्छा तजगाच्छस्या देवाऊतचषे तधष्ण्ा ये ॥”“तधयां बुुद्ध्यपतहतां देहां उिन्तष्ण उिीकु यर्व् -न्तीतत तधष्ण्ाः प्राणातभमातननो देवाः ।”इतत तद्भाेष्य सायनः ॥) --शब्द कल्प द्र ुमः

KŚS XV.5.11 yajnarūpasyūtam ‘it is sewed (embroidered) with forms of the yajna’. Thus, read with the ŚBr. (5.3.5.20) reference, the sewing of the discs of gold, copper and silver are forms of the yajna which purified these three dhatu: gold, copper and silver.

I suggest that this fillet (dotted circle with a connecting strand or tape is the hieroglyph which signifies धातु (Rigveda) dhāu (Prakrtam) 'a strand' rebus: element, mineral ore. This
