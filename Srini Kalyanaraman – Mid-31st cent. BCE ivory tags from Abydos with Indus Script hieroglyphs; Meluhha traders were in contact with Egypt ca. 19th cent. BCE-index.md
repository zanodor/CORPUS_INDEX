Mid-31st cent. BCE ivory tags from Abydos with Indus Script hieroglyphs; Meluhha traders were in contact with Egypt ca. 19th cent. BCE
Ivory tag from Abydos from Tomb of King Djer ca. 3049-3008 BCE, 41 years Palermo Stone
Label from Tomb of King Djer, Abydos (Note: The ivory tag may signify Meluhha readings of Indus Script hieroglyphs). I submit that this ivory tag is a token which signify wealth resources related to iron ore metalwork.This monograph reads the hieroglyphs on this tag using Indus Script Meluhha cipher. I do not know if the hieroglyphs have been identified and read in Coptic, Ancient Egyptian. The tag seems to be a signifier of some products/place name. Is it possible that the hieroglyphs were Indus Script hieroglyphs in Meluhha language? If so, the readings are: Hieroglyphs: 1. kul, kola 'tiger' rebus: kol 'working in iron'; kolhe 'smelter'; kul, kole.l 'temple, smithy/forge' 2. dāntā 'tooth, tusk' rebus: dhāˊtu 'ore of red colour' (ferrite ores, copper ores). Or. ḍhāu ʻ red chalk, red ochre ʼ (whence ḍhāuā ʻ reddish ʼ; M. dhāū, dhāv m.f.ʻ a partic. soft red stone ʼ (whence dhā̆ vaḍ m. ʻ a caste of iron -- smelters ʼ, dhāvḍī ʻ composed of or relating to iron ʼ) 3. dotted circle: dhātu 'layer, strand'; dhāv 'strand, string' Rebus: dhāu, dhātu 'ore' PLUS पोत pōta 'gold bead', rebus pōta 'metal casting' PLUS Pk. vaṭṭa -- , vatta -- , vitta -- , vutta -ʻroundʼ rebus: vatti, brath, vrtti 'trade, business'; वृत्त vṛtta n (S) Conduct, practice, course, customary procedure. 2 Profession, occupation, practice pursued as a means of subsistence; वृत्त vṛtti f (S) A profession, practice, occupation (as a means of subsistence); any office, situation, or business as a livelihood or maintenance (Marathi)
The tag clearly does not signify the name of the King Djer since alternative hieroglyphs are used as discussed in the following sections of the monograph.
Egyptian hieroglyphs and Indus Script Meluhha hieroglyphs -- both writing systems are logographic and use picture words to signify substantive similar sounding (homonymous) words, say, to signify wealth resources.
Indus Script cipher evolved ca. 3300 BCE; Egyptian hieroglyph cipher evolved ca. 3200 BCE, exemplified by Ivory tags of Abydos with Egyptiabn hieroglyphs.
Egyptian hieroglyph cipher ignored the vowels of the words and created syllabic signifiers in rebus renderings. Indus Script hieroglyph cipher uses the ENTIRE WORD signified by the



2
picture and identifies similar sounding ENTIRE WORD to signify in Meluhha; for e.g. karibha 'elephant' picture hieroglyph signifies a similar sounding karba 'iron'.
Possible Mesopotamia-Egypt trade routes from the 4th millennium BCE (Redford, Donald B. Egypt, Canaan, and Israel in Ancient Times. (Princeton: University Press, 1992), p.
22; Hartwig, Melinda K. (2014). A Companion to Ancient Egyptian Art. John Wiley & Sons. p. 427.)
Egypt had contacts with Meluhha (Ancient India) ca. 19th cent. BCE evidenced by a sewn boat (using coconut fibre as coir for sewing the planks of स ांगड sāṅgaḍa (Marathi) Catamaran [kaṭṭumaram, 'planks sewn' (Ta.Ma.)\ from Herala?) found in Ayn Soukhna, Red Sea, north of Suez Canal.
I submit that ivory tags found in Abydos which pre-date the use of Egyptian hieroglyphs are tokens containing info. about products (resource place names or product names). The hieroglyphs on many of these ivory tags closely resemble the hieroglyphs of Indus Script Corpora, hieroglyphs such as 'tusk', 'tiger', 'dotted circle', 'elephant', 'aquatic bird' 'tree' 'mountain range'.

"A long-necked bird appears on a tag in Tomb U-j at Abydos, as once of the earliest examples of proto-hieroglyphic script (O’Connor 2009: 145, fig. 78). This bird stands on or above an elephant on the tag, forming a pair of symbols that has been interpreted as the first true writing in Egypt..."(Indus Script & More: Striped Signs in the Indus Script)
I submit that the tag is written as Indus Script hieroglyphs read rebus in Meluhha Indian sprachbund 'language union'.
Hieroglyphs on tag deciphered: ibha 'elephant' rebus: ib 'iron' (Kota)karaṛa 'a very large aquatic bird' (Sindhi)akrandava 'aquatic bird' Rebus: करड [karaḍā] Hard from alloy-iron, silver &c. (Marathi) Alternative: pōlaḍu 'black drongo' rebus: pōlaḍ 'steel'
The aquatic bird hieroglyph is seen on Indus Script inscritions; for e.g.
Paul Kjaerum, 1983, Failaka/Dilmun: the second millennium settlements, I.1: the stamp and cylinder seals, Jutland Archaeological Society Publications, 17.1, Aarhus: no. 26, p.37). karaṇḍa 'duck' (Sanskrit) karaṛa 'a very large aquatic bird' (Sindhi) Rebus: करड [karaḍā] Hard from alloy--iron, silver &c. (Marathi) bicha 'scorpiion' rebus: bicha 'haematite ore' kaNDa 'divisions' rebus: kaNDa 'implements' muh 'face' rebus: muhA 'quantity of smelted metal taken out of a furnace'; mūhā mẽṛhẽt = iron smelted by the Kolhes and formed into an equilateral lump a little pointed at each end; mẽṛhẽt, meḍ ‘iron’ (Mu.Ho.)

A tag from the pre-dynastic period (after O’Connor, D. 2009. Abydos: Egypt’s First Pharaohs and the Cult of Osiris. London: Thames & Hudson. p.145). Archeologist G. Dreyer reads these two hieroglyphs, the elephant 3b and the triple mountain peaks dw, thus spelling the name of Abydos. O'Connor suggests that this may represents the name of a town, which may not be Abydos. Neither seems to address the third element, a schematic tree. (The circle upper left is a hole). This comment is excerpted from Diwiyana's blogpost: http://indusscriptmore.blogspot.com/2012/03/indus-syntax.html
"In 1988 Dreyer and his colleague Werner Kaiser excavated in Abydos (Umm el-Qaab) on the cemetery "U" the burial site of the king (U-j), which is dated to the Naquada period IIIa2, known as king Scorpion I. Currently, this is the earliest known large royal tomb of old Egypt. The most important finds were about 400 large wine jars being inscribed resp. having tags showing phonetically readable characters of a script, the first of its kind in Egypt. They identify the person laid into the grave, as the inscription says "plantation of (king) Scorpion." Script also name his successor, a king Double Falcon I. The scientific importance lies in the fact of finding Egyptian hieroglyphs which predate cuneiform script. The mentioned hierogylphs are on small wooden tags applied to the jars probably marking their origin and "are fully developed", as Dreyer stated. In 1998 Dreyer found another writing on small ivory labels, he concluded that these support the challenge to the prevailing view that the first people to write were the Sumerians of Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq) sometime before 3000 BCE" http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/235724.stm

Macehead of Scorpion II.; Scorpion II on the macehead (drawing).
Clay mark with the name of king Scorpion II (after Dietrich Wildung)
Pharaoh Scorpion II on the Scorpion Macehead, Ashmolean Museum."The Scorpion Macehead depicts a single, large figure wearing the White Crown of Upper Egypt. He holds a hoe, which has been interpreted as a ritual either involving the pharaoh ceremonially cutting the first furrow in the fields, or opening the dikes to flood them. The use and placement of the iconography is similar to the depiction of the pharaoh Narmer on the obverse side of the Narmer Palette. The king is preceded by servants, the first in row seems to throw seeds from a basket into the freshly hacked ground. A second servant (his depiction is partially damaged) wears a huge bundle of grain sheafs, which strengthens the interpretation of a seed sowing ceremony, possibly connected to the Sed festival or a founding ceremony. Maybe Scorpion II was the founder of Nekhen or Buto, which would explain why the macehead was found in Hierakonpolis. Above the servants, a row of standard bearers, who carry the same standards as seen on the Narmer palette, precede the king. Below the royal servants, a road and a landscape with people and houses is preserved...Ivory tags Numerous small ivory tags showing the depiction of a scorpion were found. They come from Abydos, Minshat Abu Omar and Tarkhan. Some of them show the scorpion holding the hieroglyphic sign for "nome/garden/land" (Gardiner sign N24) and it is disputed, if this clear sign combination has a deeper meaning: the scorpion could represent King Scorpion II in his role as a ruler of a certain (but unnamed) nome. Some other tags show the scorpion close over a swallow sign,

which reads 'the scorpion is great'. One unique tag shows the scorpion holding a long stick, smiting an enemy. Since many of the tags show a shrine with a heron on the roof at the backsite, it is thought that Scorpion II originated from Buto."(Krzysztof Marek Ciałowicz: La naissance d'un royaume: L’Egypte dès la période prédynastique à la fin de la Ière

Excerpt from: https://www.crystalinks.com/dynasty1.html
Narmer
Narmer (Ancient Egyptian - "Striker") was an Egyptian pharaoh who ruled in the 32nd century BC. Thought to be the successor to the pre-dynastic Serket, he is considered by some to be the founder of the First dynasty. It is thought by many archaeologists that Serket is actually identical with Narmer.
Narmer's name is represented phonetically by the hieroglyphic symbol for a catfish (n'r) and that of a chisel (mr). Other modern variants of his name include "Narmeru" or "Merunar", but convention uses "Narmer". Like other First Dynasty Kings, his name is a single word ("The Striker") and may be shorthand for "Horus is the Striker".



13
Narmer's Palette
The southern king Narmer (perhaps the legendary Menes) wins a victory over the northern king which is immortalized by Narmer's Palette. The famous Narmer Palette, discovered in 1898 in Hierakonpolis, shows Narmer displaying the insignia of both Upper and Lower Egypt, giving rise to the theory that he unified the two kingdoms. Hieroglyphic symbol for a catfish (n'r) and that of a chisel (mr) composes the name 'Narmer, striker' in Coptic language.
Similar cipher is used in Indus Script hieroglyphs where picture words signify substantive, similar sounding words to signify metalwork wealth resources. For e.g., ibha 'elephant' is read Meluhha rebus: ib 'iron' karibha 'elephant' rebus: karba 'iron'.
Palermo Stone

The Palermo Stone, the fragment of the Egyptian Royal Annals housed in Palermo, Italy."The Palermo Stone is one of seven surviving fragments of a stele known as the Royal Annals of the Old Kingdom of Ancient Egypt. The stele contained a list of the kings of Egypt from the First Dynasty (c. 31502890 BCE) through to the early part of the Fifth Dynasty (c. 23922283 BCE) and noted significant events in each year of their reigns. It was probably made during the Fifth Dynasty. The Palermo Stone is held in the Regional Archeological Museum Antonio Salinas in the city of Palermo, Italy, from which it derives its name."

Copper Axe
Axes of copper were status symbols in the First Dynasty. Several were found with retainers buried around the king's funerary temples, who may have served as special guards. On this axe an inscription includes a drawing of an elephant, probably giving the name of the owner, but the reading is uncertain.
Broad rectangular axe-head with concave butt and gently convex sides, which turn out slightly at the corners of the cutting edge. As one of the sides is more convex and shorter than the other, the cutting end, which is moderately convex, is a little lop-sided. The blade has been cleaned since its acquisition; previously it was thickly corroded on one face, where the surface is now pitted. The same face has a number of fine cracks, which are probably the result of the process of manufacture. Except for small surface imperfections and a gash on one side, the other face is in excellent condition.
Marks of the original hammering are plainly visible on the cutting edge, which is quite sharp and shows distinct signs of wear. The better-preserved face of the axe bears a motif or inscription in hieroglyphs, executed in a punched pointille technique, consisting of three separate elements.
Length 153 mm, width 108 mm, thickness 11 mm, weight 1243 grams.
