Marty Matz, akashic wizard and shamanic warrior, gives us a master
piece in song and saga. .. . A revelation for all time!”
IRA COHEN, poet and author of
Poems from the Akashic Record
“Like a shaman throwing light into the deepest recesses of night, John Major Jenkins and Martin Matz poetically illuminate the secret knowledge contained in the Pyramid of Fire. Jenkins and Matz are elucidators and keepers of the rarest flame.”
LAKI VAZAKAS, director of the video documentaries
Huncke and Louis and Burma: Traces ofthe Buddha
“Marty Matz is the lost Beat genius and Pyramid of Fire is everything from his spiritual autobiography to a classic world text of enlightenment, letting the wisdom of the Aztecs unfold alongside Marty’s epic and torturous quest to find meaning in his own life. The juxtaposition of the wisdom of the Aztecs and Marty’s stories and memoirs and the commentary of scholar John Major Jenkins gives us a map of the inner resources by which we all may find our way to the same light that guided Marty through such a splendidly fulfilled life.”
GERALD NICOSIA, poet and author of

‘Time Waits
Time waits
A sometimes mossy line
Between November and the sea
Time watts
For me alone
Turning slowly from sound ofbass and neon solitude
To the two oclock ache ofwarm green on the mountain
Time watts
And somewhere
Out beyond the Mexico City blues
Two bird-like hearts
Beat their way
From dream to dream
Searching
For a field ofmusic
In the restless palm ofeternity

Foreword
“In this world I chose to wander from miracle to marvel to wonder I learned all things open and life indeed unfolds”
Marty Matz, “A FUNNY THING HAPPENED ON
My Way TO ENLIGHTENMENT”
With Marty miracles were just bound to happen, if for no other reason than he believed in them. One rainy night in New York City sometime in 1993 a friend of ours said, “You must come with me to hear a lecture by Terence McKenna and | will introduce you to him. I think he has some knowledge of the Mayans and Aztecs. He might be interested in the Pyramid of Fire codex. I know he spent quite some time in the Amazon jungles doing medicinal plant research.” We were a bit skeptical about an American “shaman” but were nevertheless curious and went to the lecture with our friend. Once properly
introduced, Marty described for Terence the Pyramid of Fire codex and told him how he had acquired it through his friendship with a Mazatec Indian who was a keeper of the ancient wisdom. Terence gave us his home address and phone number in Hawaii and said to be sure to send him a copy of the codex, which we did immediately.

FOREWORD
viii
We didn’t hear from Terence for quite some time, but then one day sometime in late 1994 he called. He said he had received the codex and found it very interesting and unusual but felt it went beyond his knowledge of such things. He suggested we contact John Major Jenkins, whom he said was quite an expert on Mayan and Aztec history and philosophy. Marty then called John and, indeed, the miracle happened. Here was someone who was a Mayan and Aztec scholar, as well as a mystic, metaphysician, poet, philosopher, and a very talented published author. After his first conversations with John, Marty was just thrilled. John was the person who at last truly understood the meaning and value of the Pyramid of Fire. The two spent many hours on the phone together talking about the codex and developed a bond such as only like-minded people can. At John’s suggestion, we saw that the codex could become a published reality. Sometime around 1961 Marty was initiated into the secret knowledge contained in the Pyramid of Fire by don Daniel, a Mazatec shaman well up in his years, and then immediately went about making an English transla
tion of it. After transcribing the original pictographic form of the codex, he spent many years guarding it. He read it to a number of poets, but the Pyramid of Fire requires some study, and its wisdom simply cannot be grasped in its entirety in a single reading. I remember some of Marty’s fel
low poets saying, “Well, that sounds interesting . . . ,” but basically they were mystified. The time had not yet come for them to have a genuine interest in a document dealing with such profound spiritual insights. It is another miracle that Marty managed to hold on to a copy of the codex for such a long time and through so many relocations—some thirty-three years from the time he transcribed it until the time he sent a copy to John. But he knew what was worth saving. As he said in his poem “A Funny Thing Happened on My Way to Enlightenment,”
I have never hesitated
to throw away my wallet

Luckily, during his extensive research John was able to locate a very early recording of Marty reading the codex, including the lost thirteenth page. It is a very important page because it culminates with the New Fire ceremony, a finale to the initiatory spiritual journey encoded into in the codex. The reinstatement of the thirteenth page occurred in the summer of 2000, while Marty was living his final days in Brooklyn, the town of his birth. He was just delighted that John was able to transcribe the final page
from such a poor recording, and with that, was content that the codex was completely restored and ready to be tossed into the winds of posterity. As John suggests in chapter 1, the Pyramid of Fire should be called officially the Codex Matz-Ayauhtla, and deservedly so. Marty devoted an extreme amount of effort to receiving and preserving its sacred pages, and he refused all criticism from anthropologists, archaeologists, scholars, and anyone else who had discouraging words for his work. He was determined

that the value of the codex be understood and recognized for its profound knowledge and emphasized time and again that realizations on many levels will come to those who study it. He never gave up. As this book is now in your hands, I hope that you too will study it until some special realizations sink in, for they surely will. In giving this brief background it is my humble hope to offer a personal glimpse of Marty that will enrich your enjoyment and appreciation of the knowledge contained herein. I dedicate this book in loving memory of Marty and with deepest gratitude to John Major Jenkins for his commitment to bringing this book to fruition and presenting it to the public.

Preface:
A Note on the Contents
2 Ze)
The somewhat unusual structure of this book has been conceived to allow for incorporating Marty Matz’s unpublished writings relating to the Aztec codex called the Pyramid of Fire. In 1995 Marty and I began working together on a book about this
previously unknown codex, and the introduction he wrote for that text appears here. In it he emphasizes that the Pyramid of Fire belongs to the perennial tradition—that is, the wisdom it contains is universal and eternal. Following the introduction, in chapter 1 readers will find both a brief biography of Marty Matz and a discussion of the codex’s authenticity and origin. Chapter 2 consists of an autobiographical short story by Marty, “In
Search of Paititi,” in which he recounts his arrival and early adventures in Mexico in the late 1950s up to the time just before he finds the village of
the codex, where his search for Paititi ends. Paititi, sought by seekers from time immemorial, is the legendary paradise city that ends the spiritual quest. Chapter 3 comprises an unfinished novella by Marty structured upon all thirteen pages of the Pyramid of Fire. It reads much like an initiatory experience, and though it is incomplete, we can determine the general contents of its final chapter by extrapolating from the events detailed on the thirteenth (and final) page of the codex. All of Marty’s writings found here, including the poem “Time Waits” (see page vi), supply clues to help

us better understand the nature of the codex as well as his interpretation of it. Following the novella, the text of the codex itself appears in chapter 4, with standardized pages and line numbers. In 1995 I produced a detailed explication of and commentary on the first five pages of the codex, identifying some embedded cosmological points of interest that Marty himself was unaware of (a good indication that he did not create the codex). My own evolving understanding of and experience with the Pyramid of Fire derives from working with it as a profound initiatory text and guidebook rather than from studying it objectively from an academic perspective. In chapter 5 I share a threepart commentary on the codex, consisting of a page-by-page exegesis, a summary of Marty’s own observations, and a dialogue between Marty and me that conveys a glimpse of our relationship. Some of Marty’s com
ments are so succinct that I have transcribed them directly, while I have taken this opportunity to expand upon others, such as those relating to astronomy and certain teachings of mystic philosopher G. I. Gurdjieff. As for tackling the codex itself, I can testify that reading it aloud helps in understanding its deeper meanings and that learning to pronounce the often tongue-twisting names of the Nahuatl deities is essen
tial to feeling their mantric power. (To this end, a brief pronunciation guide precedes chapter 4 and phonetic pronunciations of all Nahuatl deities in the codex are given in appendix 2.) To develop a relationship with the Pyramid of Fire is to develop a relationship with the perennial philosophy. While I hope to convey some of what I have gleaned from it, most important is that the text is now available for all to read and study according to their own lights—guided, it is hoped, by the mystic spirit of the Nahuatl t/amatinime, the poetphilosophers. Finally, and importantly, chapter 6 compares the Pyramid of Fire to other examples of visionary ascent literature—most notably Hebrew Scripture and Gnostic sources—and compares its concepts to those of Taoism and Hinduism. The interwoven themes in this chapter include
that of the ekpyrosis (universal conflagration at the end of an age), death as an ascent, apocalypse imagery, tantric sublimation yoga, the culmina

tion of the New Fire tradition as a precession-based World Age doctrine, and personal sacrifice as a necessary precursor to spiritual growth. The very fact that these universal themes are expressed in an Aztec codex is significant and supports Marty’s assertion (pioneered by Nahuatl transla
tor Miguel Leon-Portilla) that Aztec religion belongs to the perennial philosophy. As I explain in chapter 6, the presence of Gnostic elements does not mean that Nahuatl religion was body- and world-denying (a common
criticism of Gnosticism) but instead that it regarded all things on earth as impermanent, transitory, and subject to the laws of birth, growth, and death. In this view a great truth of Buddhist teachings is found in the codex, that of impermanence—the only constant is change. Like the Zen
philosophers of Asia, the Nahuatl poet-philosophers (the tlamatinime) searched for and found a higher source and ground of being that, like the perennial wisdom itself, is undying.

INTRODUCTION
Nahuatl Poetry and ES
In Vedanta and Hebrew prophecy, in the Tao Teh King and the Platonic dialogues, in the Gospel according to St. John and Mahayana theology, in Plotinus and the Areopagite, among the Persian Sufis and the Christian Mystics of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance—the Perennial Philosophy has spoken almost all the languages of Asia and Europe and has made use of the terminology and traditions of every one of the higher religions. But under all this confusion of tongues and myths, of local histories and particularist doctrines, there remains the Highest Common Factor, which is the Perennial Philosophy in what may be called its chemically pure state.
ALDOUS HUXLEY, INTRODUCTION TO
THE SONG OF GOD, BHAGAVAD-GITA
The following introduction was written by Martin Matz in Healdsburg,
California, in September 1997.
The Pyramid of Fire is a previously unknown Aztec codex (hieroglyphic manuscript) which was most probably painted in the last half of the fif teenth century. The content of Aztec codices was very likely more varied
than the existing examples seem to indicate, with the great majority being

ritualistic and divinatory. The Pyramid of Fire belongs to this group of divinatory works, which were called in Nahuatl (the language of the Aztecs) tonalamatl or tonalpohualli, “the book of the days.” These books were all calendars consisting of 260 days, a number that was arrived at by sequentially combining twenty day signs with thirteen numbers. The tonalpohualli guidebook was used to determine whether a day would be fortunate or unfortunate. We will return to this subject in greater detail in chapter 3. The Pyramid of Fire, however, is much more than just a divinatory calendar. It is an American version of the perennial philosophy that can be compared to the Kabbalah, alchemy, Western astrology, Hermetic philosophy, the teachings of Gurdjieff, and the tarot in order to show that all occult knowledge stems from a single source. Because Asia and Europe are a contiguous landmass, no one disputes the idea that by means of
travel, trade, and conquest the great civilizations of the ancient and classical world influenced each other. Therefore, it is not so surprising to find the perennial philosophy expressed in various forms even in such geo
graphically distant locations as China, India, Egypt, the Middle East,
Greece, and Rome. The situation in the Americas was supposedly entirely different. Archaeologists have steadfastly insisted that each of the high cultures and great civilizations of the New World developed independently—that is to say, without contact or influence from outside people. This completely erroneous theory of independent development has been taught as absolute truth throughout the twentieth century. Before proceeding with the text of the codex, I would like to offer some background on the philosophy and metaphysical concepts of the Aztecs. The codices were mnemonic devices (memory aids) for recording all the sciences and wisdom of which the Aztecs had knowledge. The tla
matinime (knowers of things) were wise men, those initiated into occult knowledge, and were responsible for composing, painting books, and knowing and teaching the songs and poems in which were preserved the Aztec sciences, wisdom, and mysteries. The Aztecs found in the rhythm of poetry an easy and accurate way of remembering the meaning of the hieroglyphs inscribed in their manuscripts.



INTRODUCTION: NAHUATL POETRY AND METAPHYSICS

It is impossible to overemphasize the importance of poetry in shaping the forms and thoughts expressed by the high cultures and great civilizations of ancient America. Without knowledge of what the Aztecs called “flower and song” (poetry), we can neither understand nor appreciate the true greatness of their achievements. Only the Mexican scholar and Nahuatl translator Miguel Leén-Portilla has seriously studied this subject and written about it. I feel indebted to him and wish to express my deep gratitude for his pioneering work.! The perennial philosophy has appeared and reappeared in various guises and been expressed in numberless ways throughout the ages. Nowhere, however, has the secret knowledge been presented in so aesthetically pleasing a manner or reached so high an artistic level as it has in the Pyramid of Fire. The power of the poetry used to express the perennial philosophy in the codex makes this work unique in the realm of occult literature. The tlamatinime recognized as clearly as most ancient philosophers and wise men the transitory nature of earthly things. The great Aztec king Nezahualcoyotl of Texcoco captures this quality of evanescence in
the following lines:
Is it true that on earth one lives?
Not forever on earth, only a little while. Though jade it may be, it breaks; though gold it may be, it is crushed; though it be quetzal plumes, it shall not last. Not forever on earth, only a little while.’
If everything is transitory, if the world in which we live is fated to end in cataclysm, as preceding ages have done, then it is inevitable that we ask ourselves if life is a kind of unreal dream, if we can be certain of knowing anything. In the last quarter of the fifteenth century this search for
answers led to a gathering of wise men in the house of Tecoyehuatzin, king of Huexotzinco. The purpose of this meeting, given in their own words, was to discuss the meaning of poetry, flower, and song in the deepest sense. The opinions of those present were diverse. For some,



INTRODUCTION: NAHUATL POETRY AND METAPHYSICS
—_—__—Ci
“flower and song” provided a means for drawing closer to the deity; for
others it signified only that which makes friendship and understanding
possible among human beings. For King Ayocuan, poetry was the only
thing of value that man could leave behind on earth as a remembrance. For other tlamatinime, it was the best creative outlet for consoling
princes and wise men. Finally, King Tecoyehuatzin offered his perspective. He saw poetry as the only means of speaking words that can bring the truth to humans in a world that is like a dream, a world in which everything is transitory and that, like a quetzal feather, ultimately falls apart. These are King Tecoye
huatzin’s words:
Now do I hear the words ofthe coyolli bird
as he makes answer to the Giver ofLife. He goes his way singing, offering flowers.
And his words rain down like jade and quetzal plumes. Is that what pleases the Giver ofLife? Is that the only truth on earth?
In spite of the universal evanescence of existence, the tlamatinime concluded that there is a way to know the truth and that way is poetry, for which “flower and song” is both symbol and metaphor. Juan Garcia Bacca noted in his comments on Martin Heidegger's Holderlin and the Essence ofPoetry: “meta-phor and meta-physics have basically and fundamentally one and the same function: to put things ‘beyond.’”* Thus, poetry, as a vehicle of metaphysical expression relying on metaphors, is an attempt to vitiate the transitory nature of earthly things. The wise men of Mexico did not believe they could form rational images of what is beyond, but they were convinced that through metaphors, by means of poetry, truth was attainable. This attitude was rooted in their beliefin the divine origin of poetry, that it comes from above. Poetry intoxicates, enraptures, and by intensifying the emotions and the perceptual powers, it enables the poet to perceive what would ordinarily be undetectable. Real or authentic poetry is born ofinspiration emanating from beyond



INTRODUCTION: NAHUATL POETRY AND METAPHYSICS

from what is above. And it is this inspiration that enables man to speak the only truth on earth. In referring to the Aztecs and other Mesoamericans, the French archaeologist Jacques Soustelle hit the nail on the head when he wrote that theirs was one of the few cultures of which “mankind can be proud.” Given that the Pyramid of Fire, like other central Mexican hieroglyphic books, was intended to be a device for recalling the poetry and song that conveyed the truths of Aztec cosmology, the fact that a Mazatec shaman read me its contents makes this codex unique. It is like a book with a voice in a field of other books containing mute pictures. There are many such surviving Nahuatl books, and scholars have attempted to reconstruct the content of each based upon their own interpretations and
efforts. Confusions, conceptual biases, and erroneous assumptions can be
expected with this approach. The Pyramid of Fire, however, comes
straight from the mouth, so to speak, and therefore provides an unambiguous window into the ancient Aztec mind and a record of the perennial philosophy as it manifested among the ancient Aztecs. It is the longawaited key to unlocking the secrets of Aztec philosophy, calendar science, and mythology.



Marty Matz and
the Lost Codex
It is a fallacia consequentis to equate a polyglot with a translator, a scholar with a writer. Apart from the mere circumstance that they all deal with words, there is no necessity to suppose they have anything in common. Translations must have poets at both ends ofthe process.
JOHN GREENWAY,
A History OF ANCIENT MEXICO
Marty Matz: The Mystic Nomad Forever Moving
Martin Matz was born in Brooklyn in 1934 and grew up in an Italian and Jewish neighborhood in Bensonhurst. His father died when he was ten years old, and he relocated with his mother to Omaha, Nebraska, when she remarried a short time later. Marty said in an interview in Goodie Magazine: “| hated it. Oh boy, man, terrible. The wasteland of all the world. You know, I come from New York. My father used to take me to museums and concerts and art galleries, and in Nebraska there wasn’t anything like that.”! Marty survived his high school years in the Midwest, graduating as a wrestling champion, and then studied art for a year at the nearby University of Nebraska. When the Korean War needed recruits, he volunteered to be an Army Reserve alpine ski instructor (even though he'd never been on
skis) and trained in Colorado. During this time a car accident left him with

a neck broken in three places and a broken back. While laid up in an army hospital for a year, he picked up his liking for drugs. After being discharged fate found him in New York City, hanging out in Greenwich Village and ingratiating himself with those in the emerging
Beat scene. At this time Marty started writing poetry. It was 1955, before
Jack Kerouac published On the Road and before Allen Ginsberg published Howl. Ironically, Marty didn’t meet any of these incipient Beat luminaries until he crossed the country in 1956 and landed in San Francisco. Along the way, in Amarillo, Texas, he gave a poetry reading accompanied by Dizzie Gillespie—probably one of the first jazz-poetry performances that eventually came to define Beat poetics. (The “Bird” in the poem excerpt below refers to jazz musician Charlie “Bird” Parker.) On his first day in San Francisco he met local poet Bob Kaufman. Together they found rooms at the Swiss American Hotel and wrote poetry deep into the night. Soon after, for $35 a month they rented a seven-room railroad flat, which became a kind of West Coast annex of the Village. The kings of the Beats came and went—Jack Kerouac, Neal Cassady, Gregory Corso, Allen Ginsberg. Marty became particularly close to Corso and Bob Kaufman. Years later, he would be “a thoughtful and
comforting presence” during Corso’s final months battling cancer, and his words were “among the most moving at the memorial service for Corso.”* Marty often dedicated poems to his close friends, and his poem
for Bob Kaufman, entitled “I Know Where Rainbows Go to Die,” has
been called a “poignant, original, and beautiful tribute that has to be one
of the great poems of our time.”’ It reads in part:
Together we walked through a fabled city ofhallucinating green
And talked away a thousand smoking nights As your aching heart beat its bones
in time to Bird’ brilliant sounds
over the neon streets ofmurdered schemes‘

Marty is the unknown Beat poet who followed the beat of a different drum even within the progressive milieu of the late-1950s Beat scene itself, Just a few months before Ginsberg’s Howl was published and called
attention to the doings of all his cronies and colleagues, Marty went south to Mexico, and over the next twenty-one years he returned to the Bay Area only for brief visits. We can catch a glimpse of his Mexican adventures in his short story “In Search of Paititi” (see chapter 2) and can also refer to stories he told to friends and interviewers.
In 1957 he first went to Yalapa, near Puerto Vallarta on the west coast of Mexico. At that time this little village was still a remote enclave of artists and pot-smoking rebels; it took days to get there from Mexico City, though today it is a popular tourist resort. Marty and his friends rented a stone house in Yalapa for the equivalent of $4 a month. On a visit to nearby Puerto Vallarta he met film director John Huston and invited him out to
the house. For three days straight they told stories, drank, and got high.
Before long, with a letter of recommendation from Huston, Marty was taking some classes in anthropology and pre-Columbian art in Guadalajara. He worked for Huston for about a year, collecting pre-Columbian antiq
uities, which required long forays into remote mountain areas in the states of Guerrero and Oaxaca. Such activity was dangerous, involving making deals with shady local officials and hiring local peasants to dig into mounds in search of artifacts. It was also ethically dubious and Marty knew it, but he found it amusingly ironic that several well-known academic scholars from the United States hired him to locate objects. Marty’s fame as an independent antiquities expert grew to the extent that he was used as a consultant for an article appearing in National Geographic. During his wanderings in the state of Oaxaca, Marty made frequent trips into Mazatec country. By 1960 he was busy compiling a five-hundredword Mazatec language dictionary and had become quite close to the Mazatec shaman who eventually showed him the codex that would become the Pyramid of Fire. Recognizing the importance of such a find, Marty returned briefly to the Bay Area in 1961, where he fine-tuned the translation of the codex and performed it in poetry clubs. It is at this time that he and Kerouac were recorded reading their poetry, and Marty’s early reading of the codex has survived.



MARTY MATZ AND THE LOST CODEX
Fig. 1.1. Marty Matz in Mexico, circa 1960
In the early 1960s Marty married a Mexican woman, and when her father died, they ran his ice factory together in the state of Veracruz. While Marty was away collecting pre-Columbian art, tragedy struck: his wife was killed in an accident at the factory. They had been married almost nine years. Eventually Marty expanded his wanderings from Mexico to South America. Always seeking the least trodden path, he passed the years in long marijuana-drenched poetry idylls, drug dealing, and art collecting. Once he was bitten by a snake in Mexico while crossing a river, and though his lower leg turned an ugly purple, he kept going. In one of his
own poems he characterizes himself as “forever moving”:
L am the perpetual wanderer
the insatiable traveler
the mystic nomad
forever moving
towards some strange horizon
oftwisted dimensions
and chaotic dreams.

On another occasion he was stricken by a flesh-eating parasite, and doctors told him that they would need to amputate his infected arm. Ignoring them, he instead found a shaman who for two weeks administered preparations of the potent visionary and psychoactive vine known as ayahuasca and cured him by “throwing light” into the darkness.° Marty was brilliant and resourceful in many ways. His friends tell of a five-step extraction process he developed to dissolve cocaine into a liquid form that could be dried onto souvenir plates and shipped to the United States, where the white powder was reclaimed by reversing the process. Stories are legion of Marty hosting great parties, renting lavish properties for months at a time, and buying property in various locations. But all the while, the poetry kept flowing. In the wild fortunes of such living, the money that is made is largely an inconsequential side benefit; Marty squandered it as soon as it appeared. His drug dealing eventually got him into trouble, but before it did, he was in serious danger of becoming rich. The roaming of the “insatiable wanderer” was brought to a halt when Marty was arrested in Mexico in 1974 for possession of a small amount of cocaine and grass. Thus a new chapter in his adventurous life was launched, one that he reveled in recounting but that often evokes cringing tears from those who hear it. He spent almost four years in Mexico's infamous Lecumberi prison, a corrupt, dingy, horrendously violent place where, during his first months ofincarceration, he saw fifty-seven people killed. In Lecumberi everything, including survival, had to be bargained and bribed for on a daily basis. In a detailed interview in Goodie Magazine, Marty recounts many aborted escape attempts, including the end game
that almost cost him his life: After hiding in a tunnel for three days, he and an accomplice were discovered and almost shot, but were saved at the last moment by a fluke of fate. As they were being escorted by their captors to certain doom, reporters arrived for a tour of the prison. In order to avoid a media fiasco, Marty and his accomplice were spirited away to relative safety. After the Lecumberi prison was shut down, Marty served another year in Santa Marta prison—certainly no rose garden—until finally, in
1978, he succeeded in winning release in an amnesty program. According

In 1988, when Marty and Barbara were invited to attend the Tenth World Congress of Poets in Bangkok, Thailand, they decided to go six months early to tour the country at a casual traveler’s pace. After only three days in Bangkok, Marty was hit by a truck while crossing a street and broke his collarbone. He was hospitalized briefly, after which the couple caught a train as soon as they could to the town of Chiang Mai, near the poppy fields of northern Thailand. Upon hearing there of the Lahu hill tribe to the north, they ventured by truck into the Golden Triangle, where they stayed in a bamboo hut for a very nominal sum. They walked the final six mountainous miles to the remote Lahu village, briefly stopping only to cook a few pipes full of opium. They stayed in the village until the World Congress of Poets began and afterward returned to the Lahu hills with an entourage of poets in tow.
There they lingered for several years, living off Barbara’s inheritance in a languid and lavish opium-filled lifestyle. During this time Marty's beautiful Oriental visions were immortalized in his poetry collection Pipe Dreams, designed and published by Barbara in 1991 and including an introduction by his friend and Beat storyteller Herbert Huncke.
Marty and Barbara also traveled in China, Burma, Hong Kong,
Laos, Cambodia, Malaysia, Vietnam, and India to buy tribal art and antiquities while enjoying the scenery. By 1993 the money was run
ning out, which led them to relocate to northern California, where

Marty again began trying to interest people in the Pyramid of Fire. In 1994, having been given my phone number by writer and explorer
Terence McKenna, Marty contacted me and told me about the Aztec codex he'd received. At first I was skeptical: an unknown Aztec codex? Oh, not the original, he asserted, just a transcription of one. My doubts continued: The drawings of the original pictographs were now lost? . . . Who was Marty Matz, after all? He was an expatriot Beat poet who had
danced with Allen Ginsberg, read poetry with Jack Kerouac, and spent most of the past thirty-seven years living in Third World countries—and now he was back in the States, seeking to interest scholars and poets in the Pyramid of Fire. I soon realized that Marty’s codex was indeed a rare and valuable contribution to understanding Nahuatl cosmology and metaphysics. Together we worked up an outline for a proposed book, which included Marty’s
introduction (see pages 1-5). I recorded phone interviews with him in late 1995 and submitted the book proposal to several publishers, but as
it happened, none were interested. As 1997 wore on the insatiable wanderer once again heard the call. Marty left again for Mexico. We exchanged letters while he was living in
Oaxaca in 1998, then he disappeared. Two years later he contacted me again. He had come full circle and was back in Brooklyn with good news to share: He had found a warm following for his poetry in Italy after joining a group of poets including Ira Cohen, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, and Anne Waldman. He had stayed with friends in Rome for a year, where he enjoyed praise and recognition for his poetic gifts. His wife, Barbara, joined him there for the 1999-2000 Millennium Ceremony. Marty was calling to ask me to set up an official Web site for him and to reissue Pipe Dreams, which now included his recent poem “The Alchemist’s Song” and an introduction by Peter Lee. By November 2000 I had completed this task, redesigning both the book’s cover and interior.’ In his city of birth at the turn of the millennium Marty was busy recording with Church of Betty, an avant-garde musical group led by sitar player Chris Rael. In the last summer of his life he made two important recordings: a CD entitled “A Sky of Fractured Feathers” and a soon-tobe-released complete reading of Pipe Dreams.’ Marty and Church of

Betty also performed live together at the Brooklyn Museum of Art and the Gershwin Hotel, with Marty reading his poetry. I sent him $20 bills and spoke with him on the phone often during the winter of 2000-2001. We talked about life, liberty, and the pursuit of poetry. One problem with Marty’s translation of the codex, I noticed from my copy, was that the thirteenth page was missing. So he had his friend Bobby Yarra send me an old recording of Marty himself reading the Pyramid of Fire, from which I was able to recover and transcribe the missing thirteenth page. At the time I was deeply mired in commuting fifty-five miles a day to an unfulfilling dot-com position, and Marty’s oftrepeated advice was to “quit that fuckin’ job!” By May of 2001 I was a
free man, and in June, due to a car snafu, I just barely missed seeing him read at the Spaghetti Factory in New York City. Marty had often mentioned his increasing physical distress and difficulty walking. By then (mid-2001) he weighed more than three hundred pounds. He had made a difficult journey west to visit with his dying friend Gregory Corso, who called Marty “my Matzoh Ball.” In Marty’s final months in an apartment on the Lower East Side, he received old friends and a new generation of admirers while watching the San Francisco 49ers and the Yankee playoffs. He told a friend that he regret
“
ted nothing and bragged with characteristic humor that he “was the laziest man in the world—and getting better at it every day,” a statement that
captures his self-effacing humor but detracts from the truth: he was a master word weaver, a luminous though overshadowed voice in Beat
poetics, and an instrumental force in the recovery and elucidation of a lost document of Nahuatl cosmological poetry. Marty died just after sundown on October 28, 2001.
The Authenticity of the Codex
Marty’s devotion to being a wandering bhiku-bum poet was the preeminent guiding force of his life—and who is to say that this is detrimental to finding truth? The boon-bestowing goddess opens spiritual secrets to the seeker who is unfettered by the chains of worldly ambition. For
Marty, finding the Pyramid of Fire was the answer to his search for

Paititi. This much shines through in his writings. But our suspicions about this codex may still linger; in the end, how do we know the Pyramid of Fire is an authentic text and not just a poetic fantasy? The question may simply be impossible to answer conclusively.
However, an objective assessment of several factors might help to solidify
the case for its authenticity. As I have mentioned, I myself was suspicious at first but was convinced by two sets of information: the consistencies encoded within the codex itself—a patterning beyond the conscious machinations of anyone perpetrating a hoax—and Marty’s behavior and responses when I confronted him with my doubts. Marty testified that he himself could not have created the codex, and his friends and wife concur. In fact, in surveying the style of his writings, we find many very beautiful and striking visionary poems, but nothing with the cosmological intricacy of the Pyramid of Fire.
In addition, some of the themes I was able to reconstruct in my initial commentary on the first five pages of the codex took Marty by surprise. In order to have created the text himself, he would have to have been a poet, cosmologist, and a clever encryption artist. In two volumes of The Handbook ofMiddle American Indians we find detailed studies of central Mexican codices and a reference to an ancient picture book from Ayauhtla, reportedly viewed there in the 1700s but now missing.” Initially, I believed that this could indeed be the codex Marty had transcribed. When I pointed this out to him, however, he did not jump to embrace the potential evidence, as a huckster who had fabricated the codex might have done. Instead, he highly doubted my suggestion because of the extremely reticent nature of the Ayauhtla Mazatecs and don Daniel’s fam
ily mission of guardianship over the codex. According to don Daniel, the Pyramid of Fire had remained hidden since the Conquest. Marty surmised
that the “lost” /enzo (painted canvas) referred to was probably a native his
tory that, like so many others, had been taken out of hiding to be shown or copied but eventually decayed beyond salvation or was itself lost. To this evidence of the authenticity of the codex is added the text’s content, the depth of which suggests that Marty could not have created it. Certainly it’s reasonable to suspect that some potentially important features do get lost in the process of transcribing and translating an orig

Yet of course he left his mark on the Pyramid of Fire. The echoes of
his verbiage, which we can hear at certain spots in the codex, are undeniably his imprint as translator of the Mazatec and Spanish. While he may have taken both poetic license in labeling deities that are difficult to identify and liberties in fleshing out the mathematics on page 5, and while he might have added a few lines of contextual segue, none of this means the codex itself is his work. Elias Lénnrot, the great compiler of
backwoods oral tradition that became the Finnish national epic, the Kalevala, was once accused of largely devising it himself. Careful exami
nation, however, showed that of the 22,850 verses of the Kalevala only a
very small amount were attributable to Lénnrot, and most of those were irrelevant transitions between chapters.!” Marty was trusted with the responsibility of translating the codex and preserving its inner meaning. In translating any text we run the risk of generating ambiguities or even errors. Once I realized how profoundly the contents of the codex spoke for its own authenticity, I felt no need to crossexamine Marty relentlessly on how he undertook the transcription and translation process. I have always had the sense that he resisted adding his own elaborations to the text. Questions may remain about how much he improvised or added while making the English translation of the codex, but at some point we simply must trust that Marty did his best and was as faithful as humanly possible to the teaching that was read to him. Marty himself was a shaman of sorts, a visionary poet who could see and understand the deep metaphysical teachings within the Pyramid of Fire and transmit them to others. Due to the modern world’s uncanny knack for ignoring authentic information and celebrating sensationalized falsehood, the task of transmitting is very often thankless and disappointing—evidenced by the fact that it has taken more than forty years for the translation to finally come into print while blatant fantasy/allegory books easily skyrocket to the top of the bestseller lists. Granted, suspicions about the text’s authenticity may have been at the root of Marty's decades-long fruitless quest for publication of the codex, but it is

unfortunate that no one was intrigued enough to take the time to carefully assess what he was trying to share. Perhaps because there was no treasure trove of gold artifacts involved the pursuit was deemed not worthwhile. Yet the real treasures in the Pyramid of Fire are not external riches but inner gnosis—a gnosis that cannot be reached without personal sacrifice. The relationship between personal sacrifice and the experience of gnosis, or divine wisdom, is a central teaching of the Pyramid of Fire that will be explored more deeply in later chapters. There exists a recording of the Pyramid of Fire made by Marty and Jack Kerouac on a wire recorder in the early 1960s. From it we can conclude that the text was completed by then, but it has been difficult to pin down the precise time the codex was shown to Marty. He himself said he received it over several sessions in 1961. In the phone conversations I recorded with Marty in 1995 and 1996, the details he supplied about his time in Mexico make it plausible that the Pyramid of Fire was read to him in early 1961. He told me that he studied and drew sketches of the pictures from the codex that was shown to him on several occasions, and he was later able to identify similar images in Aztec codices that were already known. Marty copied some of these images and placed them alongside the text of the Pyramid of Fire that he sent to me. I’ve located other relevant pictures based on Marty’s direction and from my own comparative study of the known codices. When he returned to the States briefly in 1961, Marty carefully identified the correct spellings of the various deities mentioned in the Pyramid of Fire, mainly using Leén-Portilla’s in-depth study of central Mexican mythology.'' We also know that Marty performed the text in the San Francisco poetry scene of the early 1960s, as well as in the late 1970s: In the introduction to this book (see page 1), Marty notes three important themes found in or relating to the codex: the Nahuatl appreciation of the concept of impermanence, the Nahuatl understanding of the spiritually transforming power of poetry and song, and the codex itself existing as a rare artifact of contemporary Native dramaturgy (dramatic performance of
religious teachings). The first theme—the Nahuatl appreciation for the philosophical concept of impermanence—will be treated in more detail in



MARTY MATZ AND THE LOST CODEX
—_—=—_—_s >

chapter 6. The second theme, that of the power of poetry and song to transport the poet—and the audience—into an altered, spiritual state in which hidden realities are perceived, is something Marty could appreciate
as a poet and is a defining characteristic of Nahuatl poetry and metaphysics. Such a perspective emphasizes that sacred texts like the Pyramid of
Fire must be performed (or read aloud) in order to evoke a true understanding, or gnostic/inner transmutation, of their contents.
Finally, the third theme that Marty notes—the unique value of the Pyramid of Fire as a text that was read and interpreted by an authentic
holder of its lineage—deserves a bit of explanation. The village shaman named don Daniel was descended from a family of Mazatec nobility, adjuncts to the Aztec throne at the time of the Conquest. After the
Conquest Franciscan missionaries, such as Bernardino de Sahagun, desired to learn more about their conquered subjects. Likewise, the Central
Mexican people, including the surviving Aztecs, Mazatecs, Mixtecs, and
other Nahuatl (central Mexican) groups, wished to preserve their sciences
and histories and began producing picture books after the pre-Conquest style.
Some of these books, now in museums, were appropriated by the Spanish and were in fact created before the Conquest. Some were simple
maps of villages, showing trade relations with neighboring communities. Some were pictographic histories of recent battles and events. Many,
however, were filled with complicated cosmogonic diagrams, creation myths, and calendar charts and contained spiritual lessons for those human beings who wished to be initiated into the eternal mysteries of life and death. The codices referred to as Nuttall, Borgia, and Borbonicus are perhaps the best known in this category. They come down to us today as mute sentinels of a grand cosmic vision that, in lieu of an informed interpreter, are endlessly puzzled over by scholars and experts. There are academic commentaries and analyses, of course, but they are after the fashion of analytical guesswork and lack the depth a native teacher might bring to the interpretation of these texts.
In eastern Mesoamerica, where the Maya live, surviving hieroglyphic books are even more rare than the picture books of central Mexico. In
fact, there are only four surviving Mayan books—the Paris, Dresden,



MARTY MATZ AND THE LOST CODEX

Madrid, and Grolier codices. It is believed, however, that the Popol Vuh, the great creation myth of the Quiché Maya, was rendered into alphabetic script by a group of Quiché elders reading directly from a hieroelyphic book in the 1550s.'* That book was never found, though it may still be held in secret or may be buried somewhere in the environs of Chichicastenango, Guatemala. The hieroglyphic books, like the central Mexican picture books, were memory devices that enabled initiated lineage keepers or teachers to “perform” the contents of the book for an audience or for selected initiates. Thus, the text of the Quiché Popol Vuh,
now translated into many languages, is unique in that it represents one of the only known examples of a native picture book read, interpreted, and transcribed by members of an authentic teaching lineage. This is very
significant; because it is an initiatory text, much would be lost if only the pictures remained and there was no key to its interpretation. The Pyramid of Fire can now be placed alongside the Popol Vuh as a rare example of a native picture book interpreted by an authentic native teacher. As with the Popol Vuh, we do not have the original text of the Pyramid of Fire. But more important, we have a transcription of it that was “performed” with the “key” of initiatory knowledge. Marty’s role in bringing forth the Pyramid of Fire was twofold: First, after years of friendship, don Daniel chose him to be the one to share the knowledge with the outer
world. Second, Marty’s skill as a poet and speaker of Mazatec, English, and Spanish allowed him to faithfully render the text into an English version that beautifully preserves hidden meanings, which we can reconstruct through careful study. Out of respect for the reticence of the Ayauhtla Mazatecs and to preserve their land from anything resembling the 1960s hippie invasion of nearby Huatla de Jimenez, travel to Ayauhtla in the pursuit of finding the codex is strongly discouraged. Marty believed it was still there, but it would be virtually impossible for any outsider to win the confidence required to see it. In addition, a contact of mine who lives in Huatla has himself—because he is an outsider—been the subject of what can politely be called “Mazatec witchcraft.” He advises that shamanic witchcraft is serious business, and the Mazatecs of Ayauhtla are notorious for protecting their secrets. In order for the Mazatecs to reveal the codex to him, it took Marty years of friendship building, not a little personal sacri

fice, the enduring of initiations, and the gift of a special providence known only to the Aztec deities. A very ancient adage is appropriate here: Treasure hunters should beware the dangers of seeking external riches and instead turn inward for the real gold. Cerro Rabon is a sacred cave-riddled mountain not far from Ayauhtla. It has been visited by many spelunkers and might be a good destination for adventurous souls wishing to enter the environs where the codex was found. Strange mysteries orbit Cerro Rabon, as is suggested by its use in J. J. Hurtak’s The Keys ofEnoch and in some interpretations of the Book of Mormon.* It should also be mentioned that the cave in Cerro Rabon that is featured in the novella Te Pyramid ofFire (see chapter 3) is a place
where Marty has said he was brought for ceremonies, although it might not actually appear as he describes it in the story.
To honor Marty’s indispensable role in bringing the codex to light, and in recognition of where it comes from and the fact that Marty was chosen by the codex’s keeper as the one to present it to the world, I propose the codex be officially called the Codex Matz-Ayauhtla. Informally we may still refer to it as the Pyramid of Fire.

When the dust of Mexico covers the intestines of my dreams, I shall return. When maguey spines burn the wind and the skulls of dogs pierce the dawn, I will be there. Broken bottles and crooked graves disturb the adobe sky. Indians dressed in the horns of icicles dance on the roots of July. Mexico—the smell of rancid grease and sunlight sticks to the armpits of my tortured serape. Mexico—the stones of Palenque transfix my navel. Mexico! And I am lost in a liquorish afternoon, stuck to the sun's side where barrels of moss sing in the ruins of ancient dreams. This is the way it was, is, shall always be, with one foot stuck in a pool of burning mirrors and the other spinning a frenzy of microscopes as clocks rape the frozen ash of rivers and turn hummingbirds to brass on a mountain covered with teeth.* Call me John X or, if you prefer, Mr. Anonymous. Who I am is not important, but the story is. I first went to Mexico in 1957. At the time I didn’t realize that when I crossed the border, I also passed to the other side of Alice’s looking glass, into a place far stranger than any Wonderland. The Pan-American Highway that would eventually run from the U.S. border all the way to Tierra del Fuego at the southern tip of South America was then a two-lane road that ended on the outskirts of the Federal District, Mexico City. It took a professional optimist with a vivid
* This paragraph is a modified prose version of Marty’s poem “When Maguey Spines Burn the Wind,” from Time Waits: Selected Poems 1956-1986 (San Francisco: JMF Publishing, 1987). Barbara Matz Alexander reports that Marty’s original intention was to make “In Search of Paititi” a novel, beginning each chapter with one ofhis poems, but later he considered it a short story. He seemed to have taken up the idea of a novel with his writing of the first three chapters of the novella Zhe Pyramid ofFire (see chapter 3). —/M/

At some point during my early years of wandering Mexico, the PanAmerican Highway turned into a psychedelic green-cactus road and | learned to look for the things that were not there in order to see what was. I sought for a secret existence that I felt through the pores of my skin. | learned to recognize the fragility of a situation and in that instant of recognition convert it without emphasis into a fatal alternative, a decisive manifestation. I thought of destinies, not acts, and thereby decided without sentimentality the course of my life.
Listen friends, if you live in Mexico for long stretches of time, it can make you wise or it can kill you, but I can guarantee that whatever happens, it will never be the thing you expected. Over the years my feelings
about Mexico shifted from love to hatred and back to love. Once, when
I was living in Mexico City, I woke in the morning with the overpowering urge to fly away from all danger, but I was capable only of attempting a ludicrous shuffle while stumbling through the exotic flowers that grew on the top of a hard Mexican wall, unable to tear my eyes away from the rusty fender of an onrushing truck. On another day I wanted to ride away from the stench that arises from slum alleys—the peculiar stink that comes from the mingling of stale pulgue, dried blood, frijole farts and piss, from the strange odors only found in the tropics of lava dust carried by the wind across old sex and decomposing corpses. Chilies and sunburnt flesh, volcanoes surrounding the city and always threatening cataclysm, the blood-drenched soil of that tortured, long-suffering nationone thinks that even Mexico’s history stinks. In 1957 I was twenty-three years old, a wandering, pot-smoking poet on a quest. I wanted to discover unknown places, find a remote spot, go

an area free from all contamination by Western culture, Western people, Western things. I was filled with the spirit of adventure, and I had a plan. I believed that missionaries were the first people to reach the
uncharted regions, so I thought all I had to do was find out where the most remote missionary outpost was and from there begin my journey into the unknown. It turned out that in the 1950s there were a number of cases reported of missionaries being killed by Indians in South and Central America. The missionaries responded by becoming more cau
tious. Now, before entering any area considered dangerous, they would
flood the region with transistor radios and flashlights, using converted Indians to distribute these gifts. They hoped that these things would tranquilize the hostile savages so that when they entered the area to evangelize they would not be killed. I soon discovered that the palliative tran

sistor radios and flashlights were ubiquitous. It was difficult indeed to find any place where these symbols of Western ways had not yet made their appearance. After long trial and error I devised a method for reaching the most remote areas that still remained. I was in the state of Oaxaca when one day I decided to take a second-class bus to the end of the line. On the outskirts of the last town I found a road that apparently led into the mountains and I walked that road for seven days and then returned to where I had started. For two years I pursued this method of travel. Each of the towns at the end of the second-class bus line would always have a narrow road on its outskirts and each and every one of these roads had one thing in common. They all led nowhere. I found this method of travel exhilarating. I was freed from the need of choosing a destination. I would know where I was going when I got _ there. Every road I traveled was a new adventure. | always asked the people living in these last-stop towns where the road went, and invariably they answered, “Nowhere.” So then I asked if anyone in town had ever
traveled on that road and they would answer, “No one travels the road. No one ever has a reason to go to such a godforsaken place. Only Indians
use those roads, and damn few of them.” And I found it was true; the roads were very lightly traveled. Sometimes I would pass an Indian walking in the opposite direction and occasionally they would ask me where I was heading. It was the only question they ever asked. To every one of
them I gave the same reply, “I'll know where I’m going when I get there.” And the beautiful thing is I never met an Indian who thought that answer strange. To the Indians it made good sense. Eventually I would arrive at some isolated house, some ranch or village baking beneath a late-afternoon tropical sun. I would always be treated kindly by the people, offered food and a mat to sleep on for the night. In the morning I would arise early, thank my hosts for their generosity, and tell them I was leaving to continue on that road that went nowhere. They were always surprised but much too polite to ask why. When they saw I was serious about leaving on my journey, they would stop me and give me this advice: “It is always good to go in peace, but not without a gun.” And so I asked them what lay beyond their village

24
on this endless mountain path I was following. They would assure me
that the next two villages were quite all right, inhabited by decent people
like themselves. But beyond the second village lived evil people with bad
intentions. Bandits and assassins, all. No one ever ventured there without a guide who had strong connections through friends or family to those thieving murderers. And even then they insisted that no sane man, even if he went in peace, should go without a gun. Against the well-intentioned warnings of these kindly Indians I continued walking the road. When I passed the second village and contin
ued onward into the land of the supposed killers and thieves, I found the people to be as kindly and generous as the people who warned me not to
go there. The farther I walked on the road that went nowhere the more I saw that it was not only distance that separated me from the great urban cen
ters but, more important, time. Walking those roads was like moving backwards through the centuries. In those places nothing had changed for hundreds of years. So onward I marched past ranches and villages and sometimes again I would be warned about the people ahead and those people ahead would always be just like the people behind me. No matter how far I traveled these roads, I never managed to reach the end of the line. One day while walking it occurred to me that I must be somewhere since I was aware of both myself and my surroundings. But if I had to tell someone else who had never been there where I was, the best description I could think of would be to say that it was nowhere. And yes, I did reach places free from flashlights and transistor radios, but there were three things I could never get beyond: Coca-Cola, Singer sewing machines, and pool tables. It was maddening. These three things penetrated everywhere. I called them the Unholy Trinity and I vowed that no matter how far I had to go or how difficult the trail might be, I would reach some place beyond that horrible trio. A town or a village still
free from Coca-Cola, sewing machines, and pool tables. But was it possible? Was there anyplace left within the borders of the Mexican republic that still remained uncontaminated? Or was it a fantasy, a dream, like Ponce de Leén seeking the fountain of youth or Spanish conquistadors searching everywhere for the seven lost cities of Cibola? Whether it was

real or not didn’t matter. I would go on looking until I walked off the edge of the earth, till my face turned cherry red. I must find it. It was like a pain in the foundation of my being, like the maddening sensation of an unscratchable itch. To make it a concrete reality in my mind, I must give ita name. I called it Paititi, after the legendary living city of the Incas that fearless explorers still search for in Peru. In search of Paititi my soul must go. Beyond the last known port of call, along a coast of deserted seasons under unrecorded skies. Outside the ancient realm of time, past the last unconquered border in the undiscovered mountains ofthe mind. A journey for life that sometimes begins at the instant of death as infinity collapses upon itself, relinquishing sovereignty over flesh. In a system within a system within a system, in a dream that spirals toward the light as the universal energy transforms and is refined, I move freely beyond the edge of macrocosmic limitations and am aware that orange is but the brilliance of blue made incandescent in a pig iron crucible of magnetized constellations reflecting no eternal can
cer, exposing no galactic destination, no horizon of perfect truth. Wisdom speaks by the green light of hummingbirds, in the archaic tongue of trees. And many who seek it are forever lost in the lustrous ache of forgotten
sensations, in childhood Decembers, in the bittersweet taste of yesterday's disheveled rains. Lost without exit and lost without hope under a shadow
of fractured eclipses, in the winter’s unharvested shade, in some marinated angle, some secret perspective, some hidden trapezoid, some mechanized equator or occulted wrinkle on the invisible longitude of madness in money’s frozen smile. Lost in explosions of endless expansions . . . in the gullies and canyons of time.* I opened my large map of Oaxaca. I must choose a region that had the greatest possibility. Three areas looked promising. On the eastern side of the state lay the Sierra Mazateca, in the center is the Mixteca Alta, and in the northwest a large region bordering Guerrero state called the Ex District of Putla. Putla was my choice. I couldn't resist the name.

Running through the district were high mountains I called the Sierra de Putla Madre. I set out.*
For me those were times when life was filled with rich flavor. I still recall scenes from nights heavy with magic as if I were still there. Evenings, perhaps when the moon was rising, lying in a hammock under
a sky filled with more stars than grains of sand in the ocean, cradling a good bottle of Mescal in which one could see the embalmed carcass of a fat cactus worm. From some invisible jackal would come the sound of a well-strummed guitar filling the air with its pulsating rhythm, and the
skeletal village mongrels would begin howling their canine lamentations.
* The fact that Marty’s description can be reconstructed and mapped indicates his ability to remember details many years after being first introduced to them and invites intrepid explorers to reconstruct his steps.

If
When the moon goddess Metztli cleared the horizon and became a fat luminous eye looking down upon her dark dominion, even the most logical minds, those skeptics trained in the latest scientific methods and techniques, could not state with certainty that out there just beyond vision there were no shapeshifters, no duendes, no tloques, no enchanted dwarfs or, just perhaps, more sinister powers. For the night was their time and only the greatest of fools would deny it. As the hours passed and the bottle slowly emptied down my throat into my stomach, my mind became clear. The fermented cactus unshackled my poetic spirit and nurtured my soul. Ah, the mystery of the Soul! I heard a voice in the night call out, “Como Mexico no hay dos” (Oh Mexico, there aren't two). Under my breath I whispered, “Gracias a Dios” (Thanks be to God). And in my mind I wondered if there was really even one. At the turn of the century when the cacique of all caciques, don
Porfirio Diaz, ruled Mexico with his paternal smile and his iron fist, he was asked what Mexico's biggest problem was. He replied, “Poor Mexico. So far
from God and so close to the United States!” For me, however, the old dictator, though not lacking in wit, had it completely backwards. To my way of thinking, Mexico is closer to God by far than it is to the U.S. border. I shall put aside these pleasant ruminations and return to the tale of my travels. The more I studied my map of Oaxaca the more certain | became in my mind that there, in the district of Putla, I would find my Paititi. I would at last reach a village beyond Coca-Cola, sewing machines, and pool tables. And for a change I had chosen a destination in advance even if it was a large area and not a specific town. Now economics also began to play a part in my travels. In my life I have known only two economic situations—rapidly running out of money and completely out of money. At this point I was rapidly running out of money but I thought I could hold out long enough to reach my goal. I felt that Paititi was within my grasp. To be poor in Mexico was no shame; to be in a state of poverty was to be one among many millions. As rapidly as I could, I walked to a town where a second-class bus made its last stop. From there I rode on a series of buses until I reached
Pinotepa National, a virtual metropolis of 4,000 souls. In Pinotepa
National I was fortunate to make contact with a rancher who agreed to



IN SEARCH OF PAITITI
28
rent me a horse for four days at ten pesos a day, payable in advance. He showed me a trail and told me four days’ ride would bring me to a cattle ranch owned by a friend of his, don Rodrigo Arnulfo Boza, the richest and most powerful cacique in that area of the Sierra. He wrote a letter of introduction to don Rodrigo for me and told me to leave the horse I was renting at Rodrigo’s when I left to continue onward. He explained that from that point onward I would have to continue by foot because a river ran through his friend’s ranch that could only be crossed by a hammock
bridge which no animal, be it horse, mule, or burro, could pass over. My ten-peso-a-day transportation was a small, brown, stupid mountain horse I called Pendejo (coward) when I found it necessary to call him anything. The saddle was nothing more than unpadded wood. The stir
rups could not be adjusted and were, of course, much too short. These things resulted in a locked knee and a very sore ass. And need I add that when I finally arrived at don Rodrigo’s ranch my letter of introduction was totally useless because Rodrigo couldn't read a word? Viva México! I loved it. Upon my arrival at Rodrigo’s I was exhausted, sore, stiff, and starving. I decided to rest and recuperate before continuing. A short time after introducing myself and exchanging the minimal pleasantries required by polite Spanish custom, I excused myself and retreated to the shade of a Zapote tree outside the ranch house. I carefully trickled the languid afternoon through my fingers. I looked at the Mexican sky, which was always filled with buzzards, just as the Mexican land is always drenched in death, always well adorned with
carcasses and corpses. In this nation where hunger is endemic, the scavenger feeds best. The vulture never needs to look far for a meal, for Dr. Death not only resides in Mexico, he spends most of his time there too. Life seems thin and has a frail hold where so many die in so many ways
without apparent reason, without justice or cause, by whim or luck, by God's will or by stray bullets. So death transcends itself, becomes art, philosophy, celebration, and a ritual as well as an escape from the prison where those sentenced by birth spend their time. In Mexico wealth and
property have far greater value than life. “La vida no vale una chingada,” as they say. Life ain’t worth a fuck.

If the people were literally starving, imagine the condition of domes
tic animals. Mangy skeletal dogs without hair, skin covered with sores erupting pus, slinked through the shadows, searching for any edible morsel. They had stiff competition from even uglier pigs who somehow retained the strength to remain bad tempered and hostile and dangerous to all other living things. The adults were extremely large and almost hairless, with gray, leprous skin. They looked more reptilian than mammalian. Only their tusks looked healthy. Taking a shit when they were nearby required cunning, planning, dexterity, and agility. They were so hungry they would charge a squatting man to get at the stool before it even hit the ground. This meant you had to find a mound or a boulder to protect your back while relieving yourself. It was also necessary to gather a large number of stones to hurl at the pigs to keep them at bay
until you finished. Nothing that came from the human asshole, from iron-hard constipated turds to liquid pools of diarrhea, remained on the ground for even sixty seconds. Those porkers ate it all. In fact, those
swine ate feces of all kinds. They would eat anything they could swallow, and I mean anything, with only one exception. They wouldn't eat their own shit. Who could blame them? Nothing would. After two days of restful recuperation I crossed the swinging hammock bridge, leaving the ranch behind. On the river's far side the path climbed steeply and continued to rise for two and a half more days until just before the summit I reached another village. Along that trail were
places so narrow, so steep, so difficult to pass, it seemed only a mountain goat with miraculous luck could negotiate them and manage to reach that tiny town. It was small. It had no store. Nothing was sold there. Nonetheless, the first house I entered had not only some empty Coke
bottles, but an antique treadle-powered Singer sewing machine that no

longer worked. In a hut where no one lived, an ancient pool table sat. I
was beaten, unable to even imagine any means by which that table had gotten to where I had barely managed to climb. I bowed my head in sur
render. I refused to speculate further. I refused to ask anyone how it had arrived where it was. Only a magic carpet or an act of God could have
transported that table to that hut. This was the end. I was now completely out of money and bone tired.
I would have to continue without finding my Paititi, the place beyond the reach of the Unholy Trio. Coke, Foot Treadle, and Eight Ball went where no explorer, no missionary, no angel had ever gone before. So be it.
The following morning, as I was leaving, an old white-haired Indian joined me on the path. His wrinkled face seemed coffee stained, his eyes luminous and wise. After greeting each other formally, he introduced
himself.
“Onofre Sandoval, a su servicio.” (At your service.) I told him my name in return and asked if he was walking far. “Tm going to the store of Antonio, the one-eyed Spaniard.”
“Store?” I asked, amazed. “Is it far?” “Only about four hours’ easy walking,” Onofre replied. We proceeded in silence for a while, but curiosity prompted me to ask what Antonio, the one-eyed Spaniard, sold in his establishment. “Aguardiente, cigarros, refrescos, y cerveza cuando hay, lata de sardina
y galletas salados. Nada mas.” (Cane alcohol, cigarettes, soft drinks and
beer when he has them, cans of sardines and salt crackers. Nothing else.) “How can he make enough to live on with so little for sale in such a remote location?”
“He grows his corn, of course, and a few other things. His house is conveniently located about equal distance from three tiny villages. So he sells a bit now and then. But up here, those of us who have been blessed with good fortune live in poverty most of the time and there is little money to spend. I myself have been poor most of my life, but not for
long. No,” he repeated, “not for long.” I had been saving my last cigarettes carefully and still had almost half a pack. I offered one to Onofre, which he accepted with gratitude, and I took one myself. I thought about what he said about being poor most of



IN SEARCH OF PAITITI

his life but “not for long.” And I wondered what he meant. To question him on such a short acquaintanceship would have been rude and ex
tremely ill-mannered. The curious mind, however, will not remain still but insists on being satisfied in some fashion. Even ifIcould not ask what I wished, my mind considered possibilities as we walked. Could he have children who worked in a city, or even in the United States, who made money that he expected them to send? Could he have discovered some buried treasure in his cornfield, hidden during the revolution? Did he have dreams about winning the national lottery? And so on and so forth. My speculations ran on, hand in hand with my imagination, producing increasingly ingenious solutions. The sun had not yet reached its zenith when we arrived at the little store of Antonio, the one-eyed Spaniard. It was none too soon. I was tired, hungry, and needed to rest. Suddenly a gloomy cloud seemed to descend. I was overcome with a feeling of deep depression. My long quest had failed when I had been sure it would succeed. Furthermore, I was about to enter the only store I had seen for many days and I was not likely to see another for many more. And I didn’t even have money to buy a can
of sardines and some salt crackers, which at that moment seemed like a royal banquet that I desperately wanted to eat.
As we entered Antonio’s hut, Onofre pulled a large bandana out of
his pocket, the corners tied together to make a bag. “Good morning don Antonio,” said Onofre. “Give me a pack of
Farolitos” (“little lighthouses,” Mexico's cheapest brand of cigarettes). He untied his bandana on the counter. Within it lay three copper coins—a twenty, a ten, and a five centavo piece. It was obviously the only money in the world that was his. And as he handed over his last thirty-five centavos, I understood what he had meant when he said he was poor but not for long. Truly, he
spoke for both of us when he said as he paid, “Sacavo la pobreza, empieza la miseria’—Good-bye poverty, here comes misery.
And so ends the tale of Marty's search for Paititi. It seems unfinished, but then again, it ends definitively enough. The last anecdote indicates that



IN SEARCH OF PAITITI
32
beyond poverty lies misery. In a spiritual sense, when we give away our last valuable thing, poverty is gone and misery, the beginning of spiritual suffering, truly sets in. The quest inevitably leads to a full desertion of every last possession of selfhood, including our illusions about the real nature of the quest, and this is the prelude to being filled with something beyond the concerns and possessions of the ego. This is a major theme in the spiritual meaning of the Pyramid of Fire. Although Marty's story ends
here, we can presume that Paititi was not found in the Sierra de Putla Madre. A realization occurred to Marty, however, that he carried with him on his later adventures into the Sierra Madre de Mazateca: the realization that after our final illusion is unveiled, our journey really begins. In our conversations Marty referred to the region of Ayauhtla as a paradise. We can rightly conclude that the discovery of the Pyramid of Fire was the culmination of his Mexican quest, of his search for Paititi, the realm beyond the touch of Westernization. For the Pyramid of Fire comes from a time before the invaders from the east arrived. We have already sketched Marty’s activities in Mexico, and this short story has provided an autobiographical picture of his first years there. For continuity in preserving Marty’s vision of what the Pyramid of Fire
means, we can now move directly to a more fictional narrative, an unfinished novella that Marty wrote in 1995. It will prepare us for a full reading of the text of the codex in chapter 4.



) The Pyramid of Fire
A Novella
Whereas the short story “In Search of Paititi” can be considered autobiographical, Marty’s unfinished novella is in the fiction-allegory genre (Marty called it a “fantasy-adventure”). Despite this fictional basis, how
ever, deeper meanings regarding the teachings in the Pyramid of Fire can be gleaned from this work.

PYRAMID OF FIRE, 2:14—17
My name is Mark Stevens, and the story I am about to relate will be believed by few. For many years I was an archaeologist and student of magic. I traveled extensively in South and Central America, especially in
Mexico, where I made my living dealing in Pre-Columbian art objects. Adventures too numerous to relate here occurred over many years, during which I rambled down hidden trails and lived in remote villages for months at a time. I learned some of the local Indian dialects, and fate brought me to a Mazatec Indian village called Ayauhtla in the state of Oaxaca. I had been hired by a collector in Mexico City to search for some
33

clay figures associated with the Mazatec mushroom cult, and upon arriving in the village a series of connections eventually led me to the house of Daniel Flores Flores, a local brujo, a medicine shaman. Daniel Flores
Flores was a true man of power, a healer, a finder, a caster of spells, a shape changer, and a seer of extraordinary reputation able to see into both the past and future.* After I had been visiting Ayauhtla for three years running, don
Daniel showed me the ancient Nahuatl codex called the Pyramid of Fire, and gave me a necklace of rock crystal skulls. He told me that I was the one he had been waiting for and that ifIchose to, I could travel back in time almost five hundred years. He told me that this must be accomplished through a combination of his Indian magic and the magic of my own culture. One thing was essential for the plan to go forward: I would need a
wand of power. Now, based on my own studies in the magical arts—from medieval books known as grimoires—I knew a wand of power should be manufactured in the following way: On the night of a full moon a goat is sacrificed and the blood of the animal is allowed to stay on the sacrifi
cial knife. Next, a fresh, virgin hazel branch must be found (virgin in the sense that the tree is less than a year old and has never been cut). The branch is set aside and is not touched during the day it is found. The next morning at sunrise the branch is cut with the sacrificial knife, and its length must be exactly nineteen and one-half inches. As the branch is cut an invocation is spoken, such as this one from Great Albert’s Grimoirium Verum:
I invoke Thee, O great Adonai, Eloim, Ariel, and Jehovam, grant Thy beneficence and endow this rod I am cutting with the power and virtue of Jacob, Moses, and the great Joshua. I invoke you to
place in this wand the strength of Samson, the anger of Emmanuel,
and the thunder and lightning of Zariatnakmek—he who will
* If this sounds eerily like the don Juan of Castaneda, we should recall that Castaneda modeled his shaman on the ethnographic accounts of Myerhoff’s don Ramon (recounted in her book Peyote Hunt, 44-49). In other words, the similarity derives from a common archetypal
vocation, that of apan-Nagualism stretching from the Yaqui desert of northern Mexico into Honduras. —/M/

Finally, using gilt or golden ink the magician paints a number of words, Hebrew letters, and esoteric symbols on the wand. Toward the handle he writes Ego and Alpha et Omega, and on the opposite side
Adonai; in the middle write Tetragrammaton; at the tip Agla. That is how it needed to be done. Working with a priest-magician whom I had located after careful searches, I forged my magic wand, and this was my contribution to the journey that don Daniel invited me to take. The Hebrew letters and symbols that I used must remain my secret.t
* Marty wrote both this and the following invocations. They are loosely based upon but not quoted verbatim from the Grimoirium Verum, often attributed to Albertus Magnus and available for viewing online at: www.hermetics.org/pdf/Grimoirium_Verumpd.f.
+ Because Daniel asked “Mark Stevens” to contribute something from “his own culture,” the implication here is that Stevens is Jewish. Marty himself was of Jewish background, and it is probable that Marty indicates here that the Pyramid of Fire, being an expression ofthe perennial philosophy, parallels esoteric teachings found everywhere, including even elements of popular magic in medieval grimoires. Marty repeatedly emphasized that the Pyramid of Fire codex contains tarot and Kabbalah symbolism, the Kabbalah being the best-known expression of Jewish mysticism. —/M/

The end ofJanuary approached. Soon it would be time for the journey to begin. Don Daniel had been spending the evenings going forth as
a jaguar, his Nagual. A Nagual is a guardian spirit that takes the form of an animal or bird and presides over a man’s fate. It is believed that the animal spirit companion is joined with a newborn baby and stays with it
throughout its life. If the Nagual is lost, it is seen as a soul loss and the person will soon die unless a shaman can retrieve the lost spirit. The belief in Nagualism is ancient and was found throughout the Americas at the time of the Spanish conquest of Mexico. Unfortunately, Nagualism was quickly demonized by the newcomers.
Antonio de Herrera, in his general history, wrote of Honduran
Nagualists active in 1530, “The devil deluded them, and appeared in the shape of a crocodile, a serpent, or a bird, which they called Naguales, signifying guardians, and when the animal or bird died the Indian who was in league with them also died, which often happened.” The contract with a Nagual could be initiated at birth or in the following way:
... the Indian went into the wilderness and called upon the devils they worshipped as Gods, and talked to the river, the rocks, or
the woods, and sacrificed a dog or a cock to them. He then went
to sleep, and either in a dream or when he awoke he would see
one of the before mentioned creatures or birds and would beg of
it to grant an alliance, drawing blood with a thorn from his own
tongue, ears, or other parts of the body, thereby sealing a contract
with the beast. And this animal in a dream or awake would tell him, “On such a day you shall go walking, and I shall be the first
bird or animal you will encounter, and from that day on I shall
be your Nagual and companion at all times.” Whereupon such
friendship was contracted between them, such that when one of
them died the other did not survive.
Another example of Nagualism is given by Francisco Fuentes y Guzman in his history of Guatemala, written about 1690. He relates a
story of a sorcerer from Totonicapan in the western highlands of

pany it through life.”?
The Popol Vuh, sometimes called the Mayan Bible, speaks of one of
the great musician kings of the Quiché Maya, stating that Gucumatz, the wizard monarch, could transform himself into a serpent, an eagle, a jaguar, and even lower forms of life. This indicates that a magician could transform himself into the form of his Nagual or other animals, an ability called shapeshifting.
But shapeshifting was not the only magical resource of a true shaman such as don Daniel. The Nagualist’s arts were manifold. They could become invisible and walk unseen among their enemies. They could transport themselves to distant places and return, reporting all that they had witnessed. Before the eyes of spectators they could create rivers, trees,
houses, animals, and other objects. To all appearances they could rip
themselves open, cut a limb from the body of another person and replace it, or pierce themselves with knives without bleeding. They could handle poisonous snakes without being bitten or invoke spirits who would
instantly appear. But by transforming himself into a Nagual, a shaman leaves himself vulnerable to his enemies. Traveling in this form can be very dangerous. When a Nagual dies, so does the man. Yet only certain
men, true men, men of power, can transform themselves into their Naguals. And as don Daniel himself has said, “What man of power has
no enemies?” It was late afternoon. Daniel and I were sitting in front of his house,



THE PYRAMID OF FIRE

smoking and watching the shadows fall across the mushroom meadows. I looked down the steep slopes of the rich green mountainside to where it fell away among the tumbled rocks and the roaring Santa Domingo River disappeared into the mist on its rushing journey to join the Great River of Butterflies (Rio Papaloapan) in Veracruz State. “Don Daniel,” I asked, “why go out tonight as a jaguar? You have been taking many chances lately.”
“The time is at hand,” he replied, “and I must speak with the ances
tors. I must enlist their aid and ask for certain instructions. This I can do only in my Nagual form. Also, I must find where the derrumbes (sacred
mushrooms) grow, for this is not their season and they are essential. I may
have to look far and move fast, and this too is best done in the jaguar
form. Tomorrow, Marco, you must begin to fast in preparation and at dawn we leave for the sacred mushroom journey-caves on Cerro Rabon.
There, certain things must be done before we proceed further. Now ask no more questions; | must concentrate to be ready for this evening.” And don Daniel must have ventured far and wide that evening while I slept in a dreamless deep. On the following morning, just before the break of day, don Daniel roused me from the sleeping mat. “It is time,” he said, “we must go.” I followed him out of the hut and into the chill obsidian dark. It was about five o'clock. I looked up at the stars, brilliant chips of pulsating ice,
and then toward the east where fingers of deep purple were beginning to stain the tops of the mountains. Daniel picked up a large costal (woven
sack) and threw it over his shoulder as I followed him through the winding streets of Ayauhtla. In a few minutes the light became stronger. The Morning Star seemed to flee before an invisible wind, then disappear like a crystal dropped into clear water. The houses began to show up, scattered haphazardly across the mountain’s shoulder—strong oblongs of adobe roofed with thatch, bowed at the top and overhanging the edges in such a way that they resembled Chinese pagodas. Some seemed to rise ghostlike from the early morning mist.
We climbed along the steep dirt path. Wildflowers grew in magnificent clusters. Waterfalls raced down the mountainside and splashed
across the trail at our feet, then continued on downward into what



THE PYRAMID OF FIRE
e 5e 9
seemed like the fields of infinity itself. Rainbow-colored rocks were everywhere. I felt wonderful. I was walking on air, as if through the pages of a fairy tale. At any moment I expected to round a bend and see a turreted castle or a dragon. On we marched, higher and higher, and as the day wore on it became hotter. Don Daniel never paused and even though he was carrying his large costal, I was hard put to keep up with him. At about two o'clock in the afternoon we reached the pass at the top, where we stopped to catch our breath. A cool breeze was blowing, drying our sweat. From this pass it is possible to see a long way, and the view was incredible. In front of us, down below, the tropical vegetation grew luxuriant and thick. On the far side of the pass was a mountain shaped like a hunchback, easily distinguished from all the others nearby. At the top
of this curious mountain was another pass, guarded by two giant stone
eagles. Don Daniel, who had been silent the whole trip, pointed to the hunchback mountain and said, “Cerro Rabon. There lies the sacred mushroom caves.” And without another word, he picked up his burden and off we went again. It was about eight o'clock in the evening when we finally reached the cave, about three quarters of the way up Cerro Rabon. It was already dark, but even in daylight it would have been almost impossible to spot the entrance. Obscured by two trees growing a few yards in front of it, the portal was just large enough to crawl into. Yet this was the entrance into an inner world of huge dimension, larger than I could even suspect at that moment. Just inside, where the diffuse starlight mingled with cool
breezes, we set out our blankets and drank some water. I was exhausted and went to sleep at once. In the morning don Daniel took me deeper into the cave, where it opened into a great chamber. At the far side of the chamber a tunnel opening led directly into the heart of the mountain. With two old miner's
lamps fastened to our heads, we ventured into the tunnel. | could see a
series of petroglyphs on the left—very archaic looking. As we continued onward, we began to gradually descend. On the right-hand side of the tunnel wall I saw a series of seven heads, each with a mushroom sprouting from the top. The passageway descended for perhaps two hundred
yards, until it opened into another large chamber at the rear of which I



THE PYRAMID OF FIRE
40
could see openings to three more tunnels. Don Daniel went straight to the tunnel on the left-hand side, and I heard him begin to say a prayer.
He then chanted words that echoed the same teachings in the ancient
picture book he had shown me:
Man climbs the tree oflife between Tonatiuh, the Sun,
and Mictlantecuhtli, Lord of the Hells and of Death. At the foot of the tree that grows between the symbols
that represent earth, air, water, and fire,
the constituent parts that intervened in his conception
are reunited: the semen with which his parents engendered him, the pig of personality, the eagle of spirit, and in a basket spotted with stars, the bones of mortality
and the wings of the soul.
The summit of the tree is Death where shines the Sun itself, the Midnight Sun from which radiate the four paths or ways. From here surge the wings of the soul finally liberated,
while above, each of his various parts, separated by death, runs to its destiny. To the left, to the fields of Death, goes the corpse draped in flesh,
the beast that returns to the root of the tree.
To the right, to the side of Life, goes the serpent of consciousness
that came from the sun and to the sun returns,
the spirit by which man is transfigured in the stellar world. And over all, the Milky Way of innumerable suns.
We crawled into the tunnel and very soon, just before it opened into the largest of all the chambers we had yet encountered, I saw the twenty day signs of the Aztec calendar carved into the solid stone of the cave. The table on page 41 indicates what these signs look like and provides their Aztec and English names. At this point I should briefly sketch the workings of the Aztec calendar so that the reader will understand what is to follow. There are two different calendar cycles that intermesh with each other. The solar calendar consists of eighteen months of twenty days

each, equaling 360 days, plus a five-day month at the end to make a total of 365 days. This is the secular or mundane calendar. Then there is the sacred or divinatory calendar, the Tonalamatl (Book of Days), consisting of thirteen periods of twenty days, totaling 260 days. The intermeshing of
these two cycles, one sacred and one mundane, generates a period called a Calendar Round, which is just a little less than 52 solar years. During this
time, no date ever repeats. Here is the math:
260 * 73 /=365:%/52 =115,980 days
Due to the peculiarities of the interworkings of these two calendars, each year can begin on one of only four of the sacred day signs. In the Aztec
system they are: Calli (House), Tochtli (Rabbit), Acatl (Reed), and Tecpatl (Flint Knife). Each one of these four day signs is associated with one of the four quarters of the world, or cardinal points of the compass: Acatl is East,
Tecpatl is North, Calli is West, and Tochtli is South. Colors, gods, and elements are also associated with the four world quarters. In the East we find
the color yellow, the Goddess of Terrestrial Waters (Chalchiuhtlicue), and
the element water. In the North we have the God of Death (Mictlan
tecuhtli), the color white, and the element earth. West is associated with the
color red, the element air, and the Goddess Itzpapdlotl, who, as the Obsidian Butterfly, is an aspect of Venus. Finally, in the South we find the
color blue, the element fire, and Itzpalpotec, the God of Sacrifice.*
The Ancients believed that the supreme divinity, Tloque Nahuaque, manifests as Ometecuhtli, the God of Duality, and functions through a principle of dynamic dualism or polarity. We call the two forces of this principle active and passive, or masculine and feminine, but this duality can function only by interacting against a neutral background and thus the two become three. This trinity then produces the four prime elements: air,
earth, fire, and water (symbolizing space, energy, time, and matter), and through them the whole material world is engendered. Such was the cos
movision of the ancient Aztecs and Mazatecs, don Daniel’s ancestors.
* Marty took these associations directly from the Pyramid of Fire; there were regional variations in deity associations that occurred during the dispersion of the calendar systems. —/MJ

It was now the last day in January. Through the manipulation of the sacred symbols, by the magical blessing of the sacred mushrooms and with the aid of the wand of power, we hoped to travel back in time. Our launch date—or as it turned out, my launch date—was set for February 2 for two reasons: First, it was New Year’s Day in the Aztec calendar. Second, it was Candlemas Eve, a seasonal cross-quarter, one of the four nights of the year when the powers of sorcery and magical invocation were strongest, according to Western witchcraft. As we entered the large chamber just beyond the day glyphs at the end of the last tunnel, don Daniel put down his costal and looked at me. “Marco,” he said, “at the far side of this chamber is an abyss which in ancient days was crossed bya log bridge. On the other side you will find a rope ladder that descends ninety meters to the opening of another tunnel. This tunnel leads to another exit that overlooks a huge space in which you will see a moon pyramid. Remember, you must leave only by that exit. This is the first part of the initiation into the sacred mushroom mysteries. Go into that space and approach the moon pyramid. There you will be met. I have already spoken with the ancestors, and they will be waiting.
“Now, Marco, we must make plans. You must continue your fast and
later today, when we leave these chambers, you will ritually purify your
self in the temizcal (steam bath). Use the one located a short distance
from where we first entered the cave. Now, pay attention! Here is the date
you must concentrate on: 1 Reed, 7 Movement. While I am chanting, you must focus all your thoughts on that date, 1 Reed, 7Movement. This will send you to the right time. Now explain to me your magic circle.” In addition to my wand of power, the magic circle was my other contribution to the ceremony. Since ancient times the circle has been one of the primary tools of Western magic. “The shape of the circle is perfect,” I explained. “It is the only shape in nature in which every point along the perimeter is an equal distance from the center. It represents the oneness of all things in relation to their source. Within itself it contains both the beginning and the end, and is thus a graphic symbol of the cyclic nature of time and of resurrection or rebirth. At the same time it also represents the ever-grinding wheel of existence and the endless chain of birth and death to which man is



THE PYRAMID OF FIRE

bound. All other primary symbols—the square, the triangle, the point, the line—fit into the circle and may be enclosed there, as in a womb.
Clearly the circle is a mother matrix, the Alpha and Omega, the
Beginning and End, of universal design.” Don Daniel was listening intently. I continued, “In the world of
Western magic, this all-encompassing symbol has a practical as well as symbolic application. Its circumference describes a closed circuit, making
it both useful to protect from what is without or entrap what is within. Inside it the magician is invulnerable. The only time danger can threaten is when part of the circle is broken or accidentally destroyed. The utmost caution must be taken when drawing the magic circle. The magician can
use chalk, or it may be outlined in the sand, arranged with stones, con
structed with flour, sacrificial goat skin, crushed shells or human bones. In this case, I would like to use shells. Don Daniel, are there any at hand?”
“Yes,” he replied. “I heard of this need in a dream, and I will have a bagful placed by the outer chamber.” “Good,” I said. “The outer circle is drawn first, then an inner circle about a hand’s breadth from the first is made. Next, a miniature model
of the cosmos is arranged by dividing the circle into four equal sections, each representing one of the four quarters of the universe. Hebrew names
are written in each quadrant for divine protection. They are: Jehovah, Tetragrammaton, Adonai, and Sadai. Further inscriptions are added along the periphery, along with mystic emblems and sayings from the Bible. I will then place whatever magic implements I need within the circle.
Outside the circle a charcoal fire is kindled and incense is burned. At the end I will walk around the circle, checking to see that everything is properly prepared, then step through the ring by means of a small opening left
in the circumference for this purpose. After I seal this door from within, the ritual can begin.” “All right,” don Daniel said. “I see how your tradition of magic and mine will work together. They are both based on the four directions united by the central portal into the heart of time. We will begin at once to draw the circle. You wait here and I will get the shells and my costal.” After a little while don Daniel returned with all that we needed.



THE PYRAMID OF FIRE
45
From one large bag he spilled a large quantity of shells and began crushing them with a rock against the floor of the cave. I took out my wand, which I had been carrying in an embroidered case slung over my shoulder by a linen strap. Using the point of the wand, I scraped the outline of the outer circle about nine feet in diameter, being careful to leave a small opening for entering and exiting. I then repeated the process for the inner circle. The sound of the wand scraping the floor made a strange counterpoint to the crunching of the shells. After about four hours, all was complete. Using the crushed shells, don Daniel had drawn on the inside of the double circle a cross aligned to the points of the compass. At the end of each arm he drew a circle and filled them with colored mineral earth according to the cardinal direction color scheme previously explained. Using the end of my wand, I then proceeded to draw the hieroglyphic sign for each direction in the colored circles. Don Daniel then placed four ceramic figures representing
Chalchiuhtlicue, Mictlantecuhtli, Itzpapdlotl, and Itzpalpotec over the appropriate year signs. Now we were almost ready. We went outside and I spent the remain
der of the day in the temizcal (steam bath). I emerged much refreshed, but feeling very weak. I slept well. The following day was February 1, and we planned to start the cere
monies at about 9 o'clock in the evening with their culmination, if all went well, at midnight—the moment that Candlemas Eve entered. Don
Daniel went off by himself and I spent the rest of the day relaxing, breathing deeply the fresh mountain air and drinking water as I continued my fast. Don Daniel returned shortly before 9 o'clock carrying with him a large quantity of derrumbes wrapped in leaves. We proceeded immediately to the inner chamber, where the sacred circle was set up. Once again don Daniel retrieved things from his costal—a brazier with charcoal, some beeswax candles, and four tripod incense burners with copal. He was in a jovial mood. We joked and laughed, and I knew he was trying to relax me. It really wasn’t necessary. I felt good, really loose. He lit a charcoal fire in the brazier and I rolled a couple of marijuana cigarettes



THE PYRAMID OF FIRE
46
mixed with two other leaves, Oja de Pastora and San Pablo, both good for precipitating and intensifying the mushroom high. I then chewed and swallowed a quantity of a leaf I knew as San Pedro, another preparatory compliment to the mushrooms. At this point don Daniel lit the incense burners, took out the package of freshly picked derrumbes, and began shaking out the clumped up
soil from between the stalks over the copal fire. While doing this, he
made a rhythmic hissing sound over the mushrooms: “Shh, shh, shh, la,
shh, shh,” and so on. I put out my hands, forming a bowl, and he filled them full of mushrooms. I ate them slowly. They were fresh and almost
tasteless, just slightly acrid or metallic. I took off all my clothing. Don Daniel placed the necklace of rock crystal skulls over my head. Naked, carrying the magic wand of power and a supply of candles and flint, I stepped into the ring, closed the circle, and lay down. My head pointed north and my feet to the south, with my arms extended to the sides in the crucifix position. Don Daniel seated himself cross-legged outside the circle near the brazier. He started singing softly while hitting two sticks together:
Click, click, click, shh, shh, shh, la, la, shh, shh, shh, click, click, click,
East, the place where the light emerges. Shh, shh, shh.
South, the place where death comes. Click, click, click.
West, the region ofthe holy seed ground. Shh, shh, shh.
North, the land ofthorns. Click, Click, Click.
In the year and in the day
ofobscurity and utter darkness,
before there were days and years, the world in deep obscurity,
all was chaos and confusion.
Shh, shh, shh, click, click, click.

Awaken! Already the sky is tinged with red,
already the dawn has come,
already the flame-colored pheasants are singing, the fire-colored swallows.
Already butterflies are on the wing.
Shh, shh, shh, clack, clack.
The singing went on and on. At first I felt nothing but the cold. Then I became aware of a tingling electric sensation running along my skin, and my hair stood on end. I focused my mind, concentrating. . . 1 Reed, 7 Movement. The chanting picked me up like an ocean tide of bursting, colored bubbles, carrying me along to I knew not where. My inner mind resonated with the chant: 1 Reed, 7Movement. The cold and the singing faded in and out... 1 Reed, 7 Movement . . . 1 Reed, 7 Movement... 1 Reed, 7 Movement. Don Daniel’s voice shifted key:
In the place ofauthority, in the place ofauthority we command;
it is the mandate ofour principle lord,
Smoking Mirror, who makes things shine forth.
They are already on the way; they are prepared.
Intoxicate yourselves, intoxicate yourselves,
Ometecuhtli, God ofDuality, is acting.
The Inventor ofMan, Tezcatlipoca, Smoking Mirror, who makes things shine forth.
Deeper stirrings welled up within me, while don Daniel continued:
Mother ofthe gods, Father ofthe gods, the old god, distended in the navel ofthe earth, engaged in the enclosure ofturquoise. He who dwells in waters the color ofthe bluebird, He who dwells in the clouds, the old god. He who inhabits the shadows ofthe region ofthe dead,
the Lord offire and the year.

I could still clearly see the roof and walls of the cave. But then they
slowly became translucent, filling with the silence of stone, fire agates and opals. They expanded, pulsing and contracting. Don Daniel’s face began
running like molten wax, lit by an inner glow. Age and youth, age and
youth, alternately flickered. Click, click, click, 1 Reed, 7 Movement .. .
1 Reed, 7 Movement. On the walls the face of an old woman, dry, des
iccated—a mummy’s face showing through the bark of a tree, then jungle vegetation pushed through into focus. Softly lit abstract patterns floated through an infinity of changing forms. I saw rivers of javelins transfix the chain of time, allowing the anguished years to pause momentarily in their shackled progression. My eye opened to multitudes of hours sobbing on the broad shoulders of the rain. Even Death plays tru
ant in the mist, secure in his mantle of gray. Click, click, click... 1 Reed,
7 Movement. The music went on and on...
Not in vain did I take the raiment ofyellow plumage, for it is Iwho made the sun appear.
O, portentous one, who inhabits the region ofthe clouds, you have but one foot.
Inhabitor ofthe cold region of wings, you have opened your hand!
Near the wall ofthe region that burns, feathers come forth,
the sun spreads out, there is a cry...
My God is called Protector ofMen.
Oh, now he advances, comes well adorned with paper, He who inhabits the region that burns,
in the dust, in the dust, He gyrates.

Each world is the play ofthree gods, three forces and their field ofaction. As one or another god guides, as one or another god follows, as one or another god concludes, there can be gotten six classes ofgames, six processes that create all which occurs or may occur. These six classes ofdivine game decide the growth, the decadence, the purification, the infirmity, the curation, and the regeneration ofthe world.

It was cold, very cold. I was naked, I was alone, and if our calculations were correct, I was back in the year 1467, one Calendar Round before the arrival of Cortés. Montezuma the First was chief speaker in Tenochtitlan. I felt tremendously exhilarated, clearheaded, and filled with adrenaline and a fiery energy. It was pitch black, however. As I sat and sensed the world coalescing around me, I began to see, as if illuminated from my own eyes, the dim outlines of the chamber. It was empty. Gone was the magic circle, gone were the brazier, the fire, the incense, and gone was don Daniel. Gone too was my world with everything and everyone I had known. Gone was I, and cut off I would remain from all things familiar until the rain dies on the shining faces of the hours as they lift to savor the freedom of the cycle broken. Well, I was here for a reason and the purpose of it all would shortly be
made manifest. I felt it in my bones. Even now, if don Daniel was correct,

someone was awaiting me at the exit from the cave. I went to the far end of the chamber, to the edge of the abyss. The log bridge was there as prom
ised. It was nothing more than a tree trunk spanning the chasm, however. I hated the idea of walking across it, and I decided to cross by straddling it and pulling myself forward with my hands and forearms.
As I reached the other side, a blackness enveloped me just after I saw the ladder descending down the side of the bottomless pit. Over my shoulder I had my wand in its case, in which a few pieces of flint were preserved. I could light a fire but there would be no way to descend and carry the light. Iwould have to descend in complete darkness. In a curious way the symbolism was appropriate. I told myself to have faith and go into the inkiness of ignorance to emerge in a new light of revelation on the other side. Grabbing the ladder firmly, I slid myself over the ledge and descended slowly. One step at a time . . . it seemed to take forever. The ladder itself twisted in my hands and entangled between my feet like some living thing; the pit felt like some petrified intestine of a long extinct prehistoric beast. At last I reached the tunnel opening. Climbing in and groping my way forward, keeping my left hand in contact with the wall of the tunnel, I made slow progress. Soon I felt a vibration in the stone which I quickly recognized as the distant booming of drums, and then I could barely hear the music of flutes and conch shells. Best of all, as Irounded a bend, in the distance I saw light.
Aztec pendulums and abandoned hoot owls inhabit a corner of my mind
where clockwork galaxies derail unscheduled time frames
and electric arches drill the ashes ofAntarctica
into a foxless Mexican sky.
Reaching the end of the tunnel, I stood on a stone-faced ledge overlooking a valley open to the big sky and dominated by a pyramid—the moon pyramid that don Daniel spoke of. At first sight it was exotic, marvelous, splendorous, and barbaric. I remembered a line from Lao Tzu’s
Way of Life: “from wonder into wonder, existence opens.”



THE PYRAMID OF FIRE

Fig. 3.2. ‘At first sight it was exotic, marvelous, splendorous, and barbaric.”
The pyramid was constructed of translucent white alabaster. As I
would learn later, the site itself was laid out as a rectangle about 380 by 330 yards. The complex was surrounded by a stone wall decorated with painted seashells. Three broad avenues led to and converged upon this enclosure, where they ended in fortified gates at the wall of shells. The central gate was sculpted in a rich baroque motif and was surmounted by the carved figure of Tecciztécatl, the moon god. Beyond this gate stood a
court for the ritual ball game, which in turn was surrounded by lesser buildings, including store rooms, priest’s quarters, and rooms for fasting and penance. The pyramid measured 120 yards by 90 yards at its base, not including the platform on which it stood. It rose in five tiers to a
height of 90 feet, and the face angle of the first slope was 43.35 degrees. On the south side was a staircase 15 yards wide, flanked by balustrades in the form of huge snakes whose open mouths ended at the foot of the staircase. These balustrades were painted blue, black, and white. Toward the upper end of the staircase, they changed inclination and became



THE PYRAMID OF FIRE
52
almost vertical, each topped with two platforms. A figure of a stone rab
bit, used as a standard-bearer, was seated on each platform. From the back of each rabbit rose a banner plume made of feathers. The top of the pyramid was leveled to form a terrace on which stood
the twin temples of the two moon goddesses, Metztli and Coyolxauhqui. The main body of each temple was a boxlike structure with no windows and only a single door. Each temple was surmounted by high, sloping roofs in the shape of truncated pyramids made of wood and faced with stucco. The lower part of each roof was decorated and painted in alter
nate vertical stripes of blue, black, and white. The tops of the roofs were crested and shaped in the form of seashells and copper bells. On the terrace outside the temples stood two stone blocks covered with hieroglyphs on which men were sometimes sacrificed. Beside these altars burned great braziers as tall as a man. The other temples and courtyards were filled with sculptures and the walls of the buildings were
adorned with frescoes and bas-reliefs. Priests on top of the pyramid were dancing, chanting, playing drums,
gongs, flutes, whistles, and conch shells. The courtyards, plaza, and avenues were packed with dancing people. Painted, adorned, bejeweled, they moved in sensuous serpentine rhythm. They were dressed in loin
cloths, embroidered cloaks, and feathered headdresses. This was New Year’s Day. The celebration of the Festival of the Stopping of the Waters, dedicated to Tlaloc, the rain god and Chalchiuhtlicue, Goddess of Terrestrial Waters. In the Nahuatl tongue this festival is called Atlcaualo or Quauitleua. I stood on the ledge looking down on the scene and was filled with a rush of enormous pleasure verging on poetic ecstasy . . . Aloneness flows. A chill, dry wine on the tongue. Even time, the inseparable companion, will not follow here. One is left unchaperoned to explore this island of hours and miles that spreads to infinity in glowing darkness. The soft, red earth caresses the feet and strokes between the toes like a lover's fingers bent upon the ancient quest. Now, in this place, living is real and whole. Forever burns with a white shouting flame, searching unquenchably through luminous eons of grass. I heard a sound to my left and turned just in time to see an Indian

climbing onto the ledge from the trail below. I was immediately struck by his resemblance to don Daniel, only he looked much younger. He was dressed simply in a cotton loincloth and plain cloak. He wore a headpiece of small, polished obsidian mirrors and yellow feathers. He was about 5'4" in height and had a barrel chest and short legs. His black hair was shoulder length and he had clear black eyes and a large hooked nose. He
greeted me in a musical Nahuatl, the tongue of the Aztecs, a language in
which I was fluent, and even allowing for the changes that occur in language idioms over five hundred years, I knew that in a short time I would be comfortable with the language here too.
“You are the awaited one,” he said. “My name is Ballcourt Smoke and I am your guide. How are you called?” “Mark,” I replied.
“Here, dress yourself,” he said, handing me a loincloth, cloak, feathered headdress, and leather sandals. He helped me put on the loincloth, which went around the waist and between the legs and was knotted so that one end hung down in front and the other behind. The rectangular cloak was of rich cotton worked exquisitely with metallic-colored hummingbird feathers in the form of a wind-jewel—a symbol of Quetzalcoatl. It wound around the body under the left armpit and then knotted over the right shoulder. The headdress was of green feathers and the sandals had straps that wound around the leg from the ankle to the
knee. “Where to?” I asked.
“Look,” he said, pointing below. “Do you see the ball court? That first building to the left is the palace of Jade Eagle, master of the red and black, keeper of the sacred count of days, and high priest of the moon. He is waiting for us and will answer all your questions.” In about twenty minutes we had reached the valley and were standing outside the palace. It stood on a platform about 15 feet high and its stone walls were covered with lime. It was a self-contained, inward-looking complex. The walls facing the street were blank. We were admitted, and as we entered, I saw that all the principal rooms opened onto interior courtyards. The floor was of white stucco and the roof was supported by
elaborately carved wooden pillars resting on stone blocks.

Ballcourt Smoke took me on a tour of the premises, which included
an anteroom, an audience chamber, dining and reception rooms, separate
quarters for men and women, store rooms, a kitchen, and a servant's hall. The palace itself was surrounded by a walled garden. Awnings of dyed cotton cloth shaded the patios, and the doorways were closed by curtains
sewn with silver bells. We then went to the dining room, where we feasted on wild boar, turkey, fish with green chile and tomatoes, tortillas, and chocolate. After the meal Ballcourt Smoke took me to the audience chamber where I met Jade Eagle for the first time. He was seated on an icpalli, a kind of legless chair made of wickerwork with the base resting directly on the floor and the backrest reaching higher than his head. I followed Ballcourt Smoke’s lead and sat down cross-legged on a woven mat at Jade Eagle’s feet. “Welcome, Mark, my son. I know you must have many questions
and I will try to answer them all, but first let us smoke.” He pulled out an ornate pipe made of silver and tortoiseshell and
filled it with a rich mixture of tobacco, marijuana, powdered charcoal,
flowers, pulverized amber, bitumen, and other aromatic substances. We passed the pipe back and forth. Jade Eagle and Ballcourt Smoke would pinch their nostrils as they began to inhale, so I did the same. The smoke was savory and pungent, not at all harsh, and in a few moments I was feeling very good indeed. Jade Eagle spoke: “Mark, my son, there is much to tell and not much time to tell it. As you know, we are able to see clearly into the future, the days that are to come, and we can communicate with our descendants in those far distant times. We know that the end of this next fifty-two-year cycle will see the arrival of the pale ones and the fall and total destruction of our culture. This is ordained, this must be, and we are reconciled to it. It will be the passing away of this cycle of time, which is under the influence of our Lord Tezcatlipoca, Smoking Mirror. The next cycle of time,
in which the pale ones rule, will be under the influence of our Lord Quetzalcoatl, Feathered Serpent. In your day it is believed that the cycles of time dominated by Tezcatlipoca were all evil, and those cycles under the influence of Quetzalcoatl were all good and benevolent. This is not so, and I shall explain why presently. What neither you nor the people of



THE PYRAMID OF FIRE
Se
your time know, and this is of supreme importance, is the date for the end of the Quetzalcoatl cycle. The cycle begins with the arrival of the man called Cortés in the year of your calendar 1519, and will last 468 years. This means that the end of that time cycle will occur in your year L987s* “These cycles of time are the ways of fate, natural events not to be regretted. I must now explain to you the true meaning of the name Quetzalcoatl. The outward meaning is the one generally known, ‘feath
ered serpent.’ The inner meaning, known only to the initiated brothers of the priesthood, is ‘precious twin.’ This refers to his nature as the planetary god of Venus in his dual aspects of morning and evening star. Of
these two, the morning star is the Quetzal, or precious one. In his other
aspect as the evening star, he is the evil one, Xolotl, the animal, the dispenser of ill fortune. He is a monstrosity with backward-turned feet. It is this aspect that rules the cycle of Quetzalcoatl that runs from your years 1519 to 1987. It is a period of evil magic during which humankind
becomes inhuman; a time of fierce beasts, general misfortune, and increasing viciousness. During this cycle nothing can be made of life and nothing will remain. People will be incapable in all the things of the earth. They will become like wanderers driven by the wind. In all things failures. They wish to be important, but in the end they become simply nothing. This cycle also ends the Period of the Fourth Sun. “Let me explain the Suns and the forces that rule them. First there was the Fire Sun, when all things ended in fire. Then there was the Wind Sun, when all things were destroyed by storms and hurricanes. Next came
the Water Sun, which ended in the Great Flood. This present sun is the fourth creation. It is in effect the Earth Sun of Movement and will finally close in 2012 with great earthquakes. The period from 1987 to 2012 will be one of increasing calamity. In all this can be seen a grand mandala of time. At the completion of the Fourth Sun, a terrible earthquake will tear down all human structures and destroy most or all of humanity. Beyond

this we cannot see. No one knows for certain whether the end to come will be a final destruction or whether a Fifth Age will develop. Yet we who are your friends hope for the best. We look upon the last Quetzalcoatl cycle as a time of fertilization, when manure for a garden is spread upon the earth, from which will spring the beautiful flowers of a Fifth Age or Sun. For this hope and reason you are here now, to receive a solid knowledge of the wisdom of the Ancients—wise sages ancient even to us. This knowledge can be found in the sacred book called the Pyramid of Fire. A copy of the drawings in this sacred book, and readings from it, were given to you in your own time by don Daniel. Here, if you are willing, you will be initiated into its secret esoteric meaning so that you can pass it on or carry it forward yourself into the new age if there be one. What you must know is that there are men here in this time and place who do not want this knowledge passed on. They are men who work with the powers of
darkness, who do not wish for the continuation oflife in a new Fifth Age. They are powerful men—intelligent, crafty, and masters of black magic. They will stop at nothing to prevent you from gaining initiation and carrying this wisdom forward, and they know you are here now. For this reason time is short.” “But, Jade Eagle,” I interrupted, “if you initiate me here and now, how can they stop us?” “Ifitwere only that simple, Mark, my son, there would be no problem. You see, there are thirteen pages to the sacred codex. For each page you must be initiated by a different master, and each master lives in a dif ferent location at his own temple. I myself will give you the first page freely, for it describes the origin and structure of the universe and can be understood easily with a little meditation. But for the others you must travel to each location that is appropriate to the teaching in each page and receive instruction from the masters firsthand. This is cosmic law. Nothing this valuable can be obtained so easily. Only through knowledge, reflection, effort, sacrifice, and love can you overcome the obstacles and achieve your goal. Will you undertake this task?” “Yes I will,” I replied. “Good. Then this is what we shall do. Shortly I will show you how to read the pictures on the first page. Then tomorrow you will leave for

“Iam on my way,” he said, and left us. Jade Eagle did not speak for some time. He then got up and went to a wooden chest against the far wall and removed a deerskin parchment painted in brilliant colors. It was the first page of the Pyramid of Fire. He placed it in front of me and said, “The reason why the men of your day cannot interpret the hieroglyphs and picture writings is that they do not understand how they function. Even if they did, there is almost no one left who knows the oral traditions. You see, the pictographs are part of an oral tradition and are in reality based upon a system of mnemonics, aids to the memory. The initiated brother looks at each symbol and character and notes its positional relationship to the
others, and this triggers his memory of the true esoteric meaning of the
glyphs. This book, the Pyramid of Fire, contains encapsulated in short
form our knowledge of the universe, its function, and man’s relationship to it; systems of astrology and yoga; events of the end times; the meaning of sacrifice; and the paths to enlightenment. Now listen carefully . . .” Jade Eagle stood at my shoulder, pointed at the picture-glyphs and interpreted them in the following manner: [Read pages 1 and 2 of the codex, found in chapter 4 on pages 65-67. —/M/]
The reading was intensive. “Now it is time to rest,” said Jade Eagle, “for the journey is long and hazardous. If you manage to overcome the
obstacles and succeed in realizing each of the pages, we shall meet here

again, coming full circle for the final initiation. Good luck to you, and may Tonatiuh, our Lord the Sun, keep you safe.” At the break of dawn Ballcourt Smoke and I mingled with the crowds of revelers and made our way easily past the eastern gate and out onto the trail. We were off to the shore of the True Cross and the rising sun at New Year. What a grand adventure! A vast panorama spread out before us. In
the dreamtime of the quest we passed waterfalls of pearls, fangs, and
arrows splashing in sun-drenched pools. This is the dream that comes crawling forth from the lizard tyrant’s bed, to trail the bloodless comet's tail in a thousand buzzing ways and spill open upon a blue beach with no tongue. To heart speak in your own cloud emptied of fishes and pass through the narrow reef of time where armless Olmecs with no moss dance, where three chance to play on the beach of creation, and where I
heard stone growing in a cliff.

Burning water in a parrot green sky, a magician’s tower moldering over an afternoon of golden dwarfs and hourglass highs. Show me how to measure the falcon’s frozen flight, the meadow’s obsidian cry, my own deaf shadow shouldering the wind, or show me the dream’s shore instantly obeyed, boxed to fit the mathematics of an insect’s eye. On the fourth day after leaving Jade Eagle’s palace, Ballcourt Smoke pulled me off the trail and we hid behind a boulder. We watched silently as a band of twenty warriors trotted two abreast in a line, moving past our vantage point. They were coming from behind us and heading toward the coast of the True Cross, just as we were. They wore the battle dress of Jaguar Knights—tightly fitting cat skins that covered their bod
ies, arms, and legs, and were pulled up over their heads so that their faces showed through the animal’s open jaws. Their shields bore the glyph for
the date 3 Cipactli (3 Crocodile).

“Trouble,” said Ballcourt Smoke. “I don’t think they're looking for
us now, but they are probably responding to word of our coming, and shortly all the roads will be watched. They're in the employ of 3
Crocodile—no one knows his other name, but he is pure evil, one of the vilest and most potent sorcerers of our time. He runs a school of black magic near Lake Catemaco that is famous throughout the empire. He is greatly feared and is left strictly alone. He pays no tribute to Tenochtitlan.
He is also the absolute ruler of a fortified city-state called Cipactlan, near the lake where the school is located.”
“How long will we be safe on the road?” I asked. “For a little while, but not much longer. I know this region well, and in any case I have many friends and relatives in this area. We will go now to a safe house and make further plans. I think that shortly we will have to take to the rivers, but for now we will stay on the trail.” We moved on warily. The wind’s antlered tongue dusted my ears with mossy forests and unzipped the music of flowers. I watched two hawks do a mating dance across the sky. “Look at those birds,” exclaimed Ballcourt Smoke, “The omen is
plain to see!”
“How do you read it?” I asked, puzzled. “Danger at a distance, trouble from the left. We must pick up the
pace.”
And so the text ends after Marty (a.k.a. Mark/Marco) is given the first page* and embarks on a journey to receive the initiatory lesson/meaning of the next page. The whole underworld journey, accessed through the famous Cerro Rabon in Mazatec country that is indeed crisscrossed with
deep caves, takes place five hundred years ago and is a metaphor for the
* There is some ambiguity as to whether or not the first two pages were at one time considered one page in Marty’s thinking. The content of the pages seems of a piece, though they existed as separate pages in the copy of the text sent to me in 1995. Here in the novella they are considered to be “the first page.” (The manuscript of the novella was labeled “11/14/1995, rough draft.”) Was the codex actually twelve or thirteen pages? In most instances it seems
there are thirteen.

thirteen-step program of initiation into ekpyrosis, ascension at death and the end of time. In his novella Marty draws heavily from the text of the Pyramid of Fire, but we also find chants and prayers that may come from actual ceremonies with don Daniel. Some of the flowery prose is clearly adapted from Marty's poems from his collection Time Waits; these admirable lines provide alter
native, embellished, versions of those poems. Marty began working on this
novella in 1995, after we began discussing publishing options for his work. It is likely that some of the events in this story did occur: the trip to
caves in Cerro Rabon, the mushroom ceremony. And who is to say that some of the inner visionary states recounted in the story were not elimpsed by Marty? Stranger experiences have been reported. Regardless
of whether the story is taken as absolute truth, it does illustrate some important features of the Pyramid of Fire and the character of don Daniel, as well as Marty’s relationship to both.
Regarding the time scheme in the novella, the year 1467 was fifty
two years before 1519, which, according to the work of Tony Shearer, ini
tiated the countdown to 1987, a journey of nine “hell realm” periods of fifty-two years each. The thirteen stages of the initiatory journey of the Pyramid of Fire do not, strictly speaking, correspond to fifty-two-year periods. Marty echoes a popular conception that ties 1987 into the Mayan Long Count end date of 2012 by generalizing the end-time’s dynamic into a twenty-six-year countdown.* Without trying to guess the details of Marty’s unfinished novella, we can at least summarize each page concisely and thereby divine the lesson or teaching of each page, which would have defined the story that Marty
wanted to tell:
Page 1 Creation and the Celestial Hierarchy Page 2. Harmony of the Spheres; “As above, so below”; and the Limited Vision of Man
Page 3. The Trinity Principle and the Domains of the Universe
* This is perfectly appropriate for a fictional allegory, but the actual relationship between the Nahuatl/Toltec end-date and the Maya end-date is more complicated. See chapters 6, 7, and 12 in my book Maya Cosmogenesis 2012 (Rochester, Vt.: Bear and Company, 1998).

Finally, we can do the same for page 13 and even guess what the final
events in the novella would have been, for they would involve the sacrifice at the end of mortal life paralleled to the New Fire sacrifice:
Page 13. End Time Conflagration and the Visionary Ascent
A very significant and profound metaphysical teaching is presented here: the end of time is equated with the visionary ascent, the mystic initiation. It is this insight that defines this book’s subtitle: Spiritual Ascent at
the End ofTime. We have a clue in the novella that after completing his ini
tiations, Mark would return to the palace of Jade Eagle for the final initia
tion, corresponding to the thirteenth page. This would result in the ultimate self-sacrifice that is the ritual death attending the mystic initiation
into divine life. Thus, we may imagine the final section of Marty’s story to
be about his (or his protagonist’s) ascent of the stairs of the “pyramid of fire” (the Hill of the Star in the New Fire ceremony). At the top the fire priests await his willing sacrifice of his ego in order to merge with Quetzalcoatl, which according to my reconstruction of the New Fire cere
mony represents the Pleiades in the zenith with sun at nadir.? The axis runs



THE PYRAMID OF FIRE
Seay eee

from the nadir sun (in November = in Scorpio) through the ascending stairs of the pyramid to the Pleiades in Taurus (as the highest center of con
sciousness) in the zenith. This is a Kundalini chakra axis, otherwise known
as the Evolutionary Axis. With this ascension axis activated, the door of deity is opened and it only takes a consciously willing sacrifice of self in order to merge. The metaphysical meaning of this ceremony is central to the Vedic soma rite and is discussed by Ananda Coomaraswamy in his discussion of “self-naughting.”* The New Fire ritual is largely regarded as a literal heart sacrifice, but
as the text of the Pyramid of Fire will reveal, this literal practice was a late degradation of the original spiritual meaning (which probably came from
Toltec teachings). The dissolution of the ego-self, to be reabsorbed back into the solar light of Tonatiuh, is what Mark would have to experience on a visionary or spiritual level. We can only guess as to how Marty would have painted this picture.* We will discuss this in greater detail when we look more closely at the last page of the codex in chapter 6. Many of the diagrams accompanying the codex in the following chapter were located by Marty in the known codices and were added to the text he sent me in 1995. I have located others, primarily images of individual deities, based upon names and descriptions in the text. Repeated readings and a meditative state of mind are most helpful in deepening your under
standing of the perennial principles this sacred text encodes. As you read, imagine the words being read aloud or performed—as in a dramaturgical performance. Be open to the secret whispers of things not visible to the eye that is focused upon only surface appearances. And remember, as it says in another great work of poetic wisdom tradition:
Knowledge cannot stay concealed,
Hidden in some secret burrow;
Words of wisdom never vanish,
Though the wise men pass away.
* This may have been very much like the mystic initiation that I describe for the initiatory center of Izapa in chapter 23 of my book Maya Cosmogenesis 2012.



We are now nearly ready to read the text. But before we begin it is essential to develop some facility with Nahuatl pronunciation. This is easier than the forbidding look of the words might suggest.
The consonant combinations ¢z and #/ are perhaps the most difficult to master. The ¢z sounds more like dz. The #/ is softly exploded off the tip of the tongue. If it occurs at the end of a word, as in Nahuatl, it sounds
the same as in bottle. Practice this sound slowly at first, and then more quickly. Vowels are almost always sounded as in Spanish usage, which follows consistent rules of pronunciation: a as in father, e as in way, i as in feet, 0 as in toe, was in too. The letter c is hard unless it comes before 7.
For cc, the first c is hard, the second c sounds like an s. For example: Tecciztécatl = Tek-seez-tay-cottle. Syllables with accent marks are emphasized. In the absence of an
accent mark somewhere in a word, emphasis falls on the next to last syl
lable. If no accent mark is found, which is rare, there is no emphasis on any particular syllable and the word is pronounced with uniform emphasis throughout.' The suffixes -a¢/ and -o¢/ at the end of names refer to gen
der, male and female respectively, with -at/ rhyming with bottle and-orl
pronounced as in boatle. Perhaps in the future an audio recording of Nahuatl will be available. See appendix 2 for more phonetic spellings of Nahuatl words. As for the physical appearance of the Pyramid of Fire, I have modified many of the line breaks (the transcription I received was written in paragraph form) and have implemented a system of line numbering for ease of reference in discussion of the text: 3:2—6 refers to Pyramid of Fire page 3, lines 2 through 6.

THE TEXT
Se ee
64
Throughout the codex deity names appear in bold upon first use and
their functions, qualities, and/or areas of governance are italicized. In rare
instances I have added a comma, exchanged a colon for a comma, or added a clarifying adverb for easier reading. According to Marty, during his various moves the thirteenth page of
the codex and the drawings he made were lost. The drawings were never found, but fortunately, after resurfacing in 2000, Marty had a friend of
his send me a tape of one of his earliest readings of the codex. Originally recorded on a wire recorder in the early 1960s, the sound quality was
fairly good but faint. After boosting the signal, I was able to transcribe the lost thirteenth page and then read my transcription to Marty over the phone for confirmation.
The footnotes include a minimum number of relevant comments
referenced to the text of the codex in this chapter, but more in-depth commentary can be found in chapter 5.

1 These eight levels of divinity, each one of which is nothing for him from whom they issue forth and infinite for him to whom it gives life,
resemble the eight notes of the cosmic musical scale:
5 Tonatiuh, Mixcéatl, Tezcatlipoca, Paynal, and Metztli,*
6 as the Sun, the planets, and the Moon,
sound the eight notes of the solar musical scale.
8 The eight notes of the music of nature
sound as heroes, men, animals, insects, plants,
soil, rock, and metals.
11 The eight notes of human music
sound as spirit, heart, head, semen, blood,
viscera, nerves, and bone.
14 Because that which is above created that which is below
and that which is low reflects that which is high,
the Universe is Tezcatlipoca, Smoking Mirror, in which man still does not see clearly.
* To complete the sun, moon, and planets, this list should also include Huitzilopochtli, Itzpapdlotl, and Tlaltecuhtli. Marty told me, however, that the list was given to him without
these three included.

Each world is the play of three gods, three forces and their field of action. As one or another god guides, as one or another god follows,
as one or another god concludes,
there can be gotten six classes of games, six processes that create all that occurs or may occur. These six classes of divine games decide the growth,
the decadence, the purification, the infirmity, the curation, and the regeneration of the world.
And as three forces create everything in all which is made,
there are four states of matter and four deities that govern them:
Xiuhtecuhtli, Lord of the Year, governs active masculine matter, fire. Chalchiuhtlicue, She of the Jeweled Gown,
governs passive, feminine matter, water.
Ehécatl, God of the Wind, governs impartial unifying mediating matter, wind.
Cihuacéatl, the Woman Serpent,
governs matter that is inert, current of all forces, earth.
As three forces create everything, there are four states of time, four seasons of the year, and four deities govern them:
Xipe Totec, the Skinned One, governs the ardent season
when the earth becomes naked, spring.

| Man does not will when he wars, loves, and reaps; it is the rhythms of the great gods, the planets, that act over him and make him do. When man comprehends that by himself he can do nothing, then he can learn to serve the gods; so, he must become conscious of the rhythms of the gods.
7 The calendar that governs the life of man, the Tonalpohualli, is based on the rites of the planets that turn closest to the Earth:
Paynal, Mercury; Quetzalcéatl, Venus; and Huitzilopochtli, Mars.

And as the sun lights the Earth in the same form every 365 days, every 117 days Paynal shines over the earth in the same form, every 585 days shines Quetzalcéatl in the same form, every 780 days shines Huitzilopochtli in the same form.
So the week has 13 days, factor of the cycles of Paynal and Quetzalcédatl. The month has 20 days, factor of the cycle of Huitzilopochtli.
And the Tonalpohualli, this Holy Year of the Planets,
has 13 times 20 or 260 days.
And parallel to this Holy Year of the Planets occurs the Year of the Sun
by which man plants, reaps, and recognizes the stations.
And the two years represent the double play
of divinity in the heavens, one the Play of the Divine Many and the other the Play of the Divine One.
So one Tonalpohualli measures 2'/4 cycles of Paynal. One Tonalpohualli measures 4/9 of a cycle of Quetzalcéatl. One Tonalpohualli measures '/3 of a cycle of Huitzilopochtli. One Tonalpohualli measures */3 of a cycle of Mixcédatl. The Tonalpohualli measures the cycles of all the planets.
After 9 Tonalpohualli, Paynal, Quetzalcéatl,
and Huitzilopochtli all shine over the Earth in the same form; everything begins again. A new opportunity is given.

40 After 73 Tonalpohualli (52 solar years), this Holy Year of the Planets coincides with the year of Tonatiuh, the Sun. During five days all fires are put out and a new fire is lit at the sacred mountain, a fire taken directly from the solar source. And with great ceremony all fires are lit again
from this one Son of the Sun.
46 After 108 Tonalpohualli, the rhythms of the minor planets unite with the rhythms of the greater planets; all the planets that give form and character to man shine together in the same form.
Such is the duration of the life of man.
51 After 657* Tonalpohualli (468 solar years), the cycles of the minor planets and the cycles of the Sun end together.
Tonatiuh, Quetzalcéatl, Huitzilopochtli, and Paynal shine again at the same time in the same form. This is an Age, the duration of the life of a culture.
* While Marty's original text states this as 767 Tonalpohualli, it is 657 Tonalpohualli on the recording—and, given the context, 657 is mathematically correct.

In the heavens over the Earth sails Tecciztécatl,
He of the Marine Conch (the Moon), and Tonatiuh, the Sun. The Earth and all its creatures are under their power.
On the Earth exists the worlds of nature:
the informal life of waters, trees, insects, animals, and two classes of men.
One class is the ordinary man, naked, inert, always menaced by death’s darts.
The other class is the superior man. In the shade of the altar the maguey spines of penance become for him the wings of the soul
and in his hands he harmonizes the four states of matter. He has achieved consciousness.
He has achieved the power of Truth and can act.
He is!
The other man is like an agonized animal tied to the tree from which he eats.
He gives his vital energy to Tecciztécatl, the Moon,
while his body is eaten by Tlaltecuhtli, the Earth.
So everything devours and is devoured, eats and is eaten in the cosmic hierarchy. Plants eat from minerals and are eaten by animals.
The animals eat plants and in their turn are eaten by the Earth.
So does man, as animal organism, devour plants
and is devoured by Earth in due time.
And if he is only body, he has no other destiny. But the superior man feeds on sacrifice; he develops his soul and his soul becomes food for Tonatiuh, the Sun.
So, as the maguey spines rest on the straw bed, the soul of the liberated man rests on the Hill of Heaven.

And between the Mother Earth and the Herald of Heaven is found the symbol of the dual nature of man: the earthly centipede of his spinal column interlaced
with the celestial serpent of consciousness that can inhabit him.
And again, under to the left, we see that which remains
when the wings of the serpent have flown:
the heart of the dead warrior, his head over the altar, and the skull of the dead prisoner on the cranium stake,

that came from the Sun and to the Sun returns, the spirit by which man is transfigured in the stellar world. And over all, the Milky Way of innumerable suns.

But in their hearts and in their semen, each man /as his own coatl,

16 In the ordinary man the serpent has but one head—hurting and
cruel,
and lacking control of the energy of Tonatiuh and its gift of consciousness.
The energy spits from her, becomes venomous. The ordinary man cannot conserve it or utilize it.
But he who searches learns to turn the serpent inward
and the serpent wounds the enemy that it carries within itself.
*The 1995 text reverses pages 10 and 11 as they are presented on the 1961 recording. Because the order of the pages on the recording seems more consistent with the flow of concepts and because it represents the earliest arrangement we have, I opted to follow it in this version.

Commentary
Introduction
My intention in this chapter is to share, through line-by-line analysis, some pointers to a deeper understanding of the text of the Pyramid of Fire. Of course, my own exegetical elucidations might not correspond
with the insights perceived by readers on their own. This, however, is to be expected with any multidimensional initiatory text from which insights of many different kinds may be gleaned by its readers. But whatever the differences in our discoveries, we can certainly agree upon some general points. For example, page 1 and page 13 involve creation and apocalypse (or more precisely, ekpyrosis, universal dissolution by fire), respectively. This frames the alpha and the omega of a grand cycle of manifestation and final re-absorption into the unmanifest godhead (Tloque Nahuaque). To elucidate the codex, clear and discerning analysis is important, but to put analysis in its proper place, we should remember Marty’s own emphasis on the power of poetry and the dramatic performance of the Pyramid of Fire. It is this evocation of gnosis that plants the seeds of wisdom into receptive souls for future flowering. We should also recall that the text of the Pyramid of Fire is based on an authentic pre-Conquest-era picture book. In the same way that ancient performers of the dramaturgy used picture books as memory devices, so too did Marty's Mazatec friend. Daniel, who descended from a noble family that hid this codex and passed it down through the generations, is the modern-day dramaturgist. We might expect, however,
89



COMMENTARY

that more than 450 years of retelling would result in some adaptations and alterations, though given that performance of sacred texts is essentially a conservative religious art and that each generation had the benefit of the pictures to provide the story’s standard form, any changes that may have occurred were probably minimal. It should be noted that the Pyramid of Fire is unique in one important respect when compared to other Nahuatl picture books analyzed by scholars: It has been told by one in the lineage who is thereby privy to inner nuances and subtleties that can so easily escape an outsider’s analysis.
The cosmology, however, that can be reconstructed from the Pyramid of Fire is generally consistent with that found in other Central Mexican codices' and appears in the text on many levels. First—and entirely serendipitously—after applying line breaks to the text, my transcription of the Pyramid of Fire resulted in 365 lines. This suggests a theme patterned on astronomical cycles, a meaning already inherent in the codex,
given that it has 13 pages (13 is a numerological symbol for the moon’s
waxing from new to full), and is also consistent with a visionary recital and cyclical dramaturgy. We can also observe that the number 13 corresponds to the number of phases of the moon, and that the number of lines—365—also refers to the days in a solar year. Add to these observations the fact that, from creation to conflagration, the codex leads us through all stages in cosmogonic time. Thus it weaves solar and lunar rhythms, an interlacing that is the function of the 52-haab Calendar Round cycle that defines the timing of the New Fire ceremony as well as the end-of-age conflagration. The codex calls it the weaving of the One and the Many. Such patterning is in good company, for the Mexican poet Octavio Paz intentionally gave his poem “Sun Stone” 584 lines to evoke the period of Venus.
It has been valuable for me, as the modern redactor of the Pyramid of Fire, to base my commentary largely on my initiatory relationship with
the text, rather than citing supportive academic source material. In fol
lowing this method I do not claim to be a Nahuatl tlamatinime; I am
more of a visiting perennialist, seeking Sophia in her multifarious forms.



COMMENTARY
91
Marty especially wanted to emphasize the ways in which the Pyramid of Fire paralleled concepts in other traditions in order to illustrate how it is that the codex belongs to the perennial philosophy. In many ways Marty was a westerner who went native both internally
and externally. In his unique process of studying, living within, and being transformed by native traditions in different parts of the world, he developed a deep grasp of the metaphysical principles and spiritual truths shared by all perennial philosophies, including those found in the Pyramid of Fire. This deep understanding along with his skill at speaking Mazatec (and his fluency in Spanish enabled him to accurately transcribe and translate the readings offered by Daniel. Marty himself had many specific insights into how the Pyramid of Fire was related to other esoteric traditions. He saw parallels to Chinese ‘Taoism, tarot, and to ideas explored in G. I. Gurdjieff’s philosophy called the New Way. Taoist philosophy is based upon the dualism of yin and yang in relation to a third “pole”’—the neutral background. Marty mentioned that Ometeotl is the “One God” of the Aztecs, and a king of Texcoco
(Nezahuacoyotl) was the first Aztec who had the idea of a single godhead from whom comes physical manifestation. In the codex such a cosmoge
nesis proceeds not from | (unity) to 2 (duality), but directly from 1 to 3. There is a comparable Chinese saying: “From 1 to 3; from that the
10,000 things.” This philosophical notion is equivalent to the Taoist conception that duality must interact against a neutral background—there cannot be only two; a neutral third must immediately exist, implying a trinity of creative forces. Marty recommended some passages in Fortune- Telling by Mah Jongg by
Derek Walters (a rare book he sent me) for connections between Chinese oracles and the Pole Star or Big Dipper. (Also see Eva Hunt's Transformations ofthe Hummingbird.) “Spinning the spoon” in Chinese divination is analogous to the imagery of the four Tezcatlipocas spinning with one foot on the Pole Star. The first part of Walters’s book describes the astronomy and astrology of ancient China, which Marty found very similar to the system in the Pyramid of Fire. Comparisons can be made to other Eastern systems, including Sufi mysticism, Zoroastrianism (Gnosticism's



COMMENTARY
92
and Manichaeism’s e&pyrosis doctrine), and Hindu and Buddhist philosophy. Another connection between Eastern philosophy and the Pyramid of
Fire is the idea of worldly impermanence, which Marty mentions in his introduction to this book and which we will discuss further in chapter 6. Marty also pointed out a relationship between the Pyramid of Fire and tarot, emphasizing that Aztec calendar cosmology could be mapped onto tarot cards. The general connections are obvious: In Aztec cosmol
ogy there are 13 heavens and 9 hell realms, a total of 22, which is the number of tarot images in some versions of the deck. There are 52 years in a Calendar Round, which corresponds to the total number of cards used in some tarot decks and in modern playing-card decks today. Although Marty suggested that several tarot archetypes (The Fool, High Priestess, Emperor, and so forth) compare to Aztec day signs, it is difficult to project the entire sequence of analogies because of the problem of the correspondence between Aztec deities and the regular day-sign symbols. One set of deity and day sign correspondences is evident in Codex Borbonicus and Codex Telleriano-Remensis and is discussed by Bruce Scofield in his book Signs of Time.’ Marty also perceived a relationship between the Pyramid of Fire and the ideas of G. I. Gurdjieff, an enigmatic philosopher from the Caucasus who traveled widely throughout the Near East and Asia in the early 1900s and became a teacher of consciousness-expanding techniques that are largely based on ancient spiritual beliefs. His work became available to the English-speaking West through books written by one of his stu
dents, P. D. Ouspensky. Tertium Organum, A New Model ofthe Universe, and In Search ofthe Miraculous explore progressive ideas in a field of spirituality that can best be called Gurdjieffian, or New Way. Marty pointed out that A New Model ofthe Universe (English translation, 1949) contains a cosmogonic system, called by Gurdjieff the Ray of Creation, that is strikingly similar to the multileveled and tripartite cosmology described on pages 1—3 of the Pyramid of Fire. The parallel is less surprising than we might initially assume, because, as Gurdjieff himself stated, such teachings are “at the root of all ancient systems.” Gurdjieff introduces the Ray of Creation by first explaining why three
forces are required for all phenomenon in the world to exist. The Law of



COMMENTARY
25
Three explains how the Unity of the Absolute transforms into Plurality: From the One emerge the Three. This insight is echoed in the ancient Chinese teaching mentioned earlier: “From 1 to 3; from that the 10,000 things.” Gurdjieff also finds in Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva the idea of three forces unified in the Absolute.‘ The Ray of Creation is a multidimensional conception of the universe, a holographic model in which smaller scales of existence are nestled
inside larger dimensions, all of which follow a law of correspondence that is compared to the eight-toned musical octave. The seven levels or dimen
sions, according to Gurdjieff, are: the Absolute, All Worlds, All Suns (the Milky Way), the Sun, All Planets, the Earth, and the Moon.? This, of course, is strikingly similar to the cosmogonic model found on the first page of the codex. The Pyramid of Fire goes further to elaborate
microsystems on the earth, including nature music and human music, which each consist of eight levels.
In the codex (6:17—19), we read that the Moon eats the departed vital
energy of un-actualized men; in a similar way the idea that the Moon feeds on earth’s organic life is discussed in Ouspensky’s book.® Apart from these
and other specific comparisons, the general idea that the codex shares with
Gurdjieff’s Ray of Creation is that of “as above, so below,” the so-called Hermetic adage that many ancient traditions took to be self-evident. Such a principle operates in conjunction with nested scales of manifestation in worldly processes. On page 1 of the codex the repeated phrase “within him is born” suggests that each level emerges from the previous one, like a set
of nested dolls or fractal manifestations, as shown below.

This is exactly the same as the Law of Octaves that operates in the Ray ofCreation teaching. Gurdjieff drew many of his teachings from his encounters with various Sufi masters throughout the Middle East, and Marty asserted that Sufi mysticism is “remarkably similar” to the teach
ing in the codex.
Commentary
Pages 1—5 of the Pyramid of Fire enumerate the many worlds and their processes, including the calendar cycles of the planets and the three cos
mic principles, best described as male, female, and a neutral mediator.
Page 1: Creation and the Celestial Hierarchy
1:1-29. The entire first page describes a celestial hierarchy that can be
distilled into the following chart.
TABLE 1: THE EIGHT SUBDIVISIONS OF THE HIGHEST COSMOGONIC REALM
1. Tloque Nahuaque Lord of Intimate Vicinity
2. Tonacatecuhtli Lord of Our Sustainment
3. Tzitzimime Giants from Milky Way
4. Tonatiuh The Sun
5. Sons and Daughters of Tonatiuh the planets
6. Xochiquetzal Nature
7. Metztli the Moon; Earth + nature
8. Mictlantecuhtli (from 3:30-33) Hell Worlds or Underworld
These are the eight subdivisions of the cosmos. In principle, each level can be further subdivided into micro-scale systems of eight subdivisions, although page 2 details only the subdivisions of the lowest three levels.

Page 2: Harmony of the Spheres; “As above, so below”. and the Limited Vision of Man
Each level of the cosmos can be thought of as a domain or, following
Neo-platonic terminology, a sphere. In this page we see that the structure of the individual spheres reflects the eight-level structure of the larger cos
mos. Thus, a “Harmony of the Spheres” concept is implicit, referred to in the codex as a “cosmic musical scale” (2:4).
2:1-13. The eight subdivisions of each of the three lower levels of the cosmogonic realm are compared to the eight tones of the musical scale,
suggesting a harmonic (or octave) relationship between the lowest and highest levels. We may call the eight cosmic divisions on page 1 the
Cosmic Music. On page 2 we find further details about three other

music’ levels:

Thus, there are four cosmogonic levels that mirror each other, fol
lowing the principle of “As above, so below”:
I. Cosmic Music II. Solar Music
III. Nature Music
IV. Human Music
2:14-17. Because it follows this principle, the universe “is Tezcatlipoca, Smoking Mirror” (2:16), a place where humans don’t see clearly. Human
beings are incarnated, living, and thus subject to the laws of birth and death. The world is a finite manifestation, a limited reflection of the infi
nite godhead, Tloque Nahauque, and therefore normal human vision and understanding is diminished like smoke on a mirror. In the Popol
Vuh, the Quiché Maya creation myth, the same situation is described as “breath on a mirror.””
Page 3: The Trinity Principle and the Domains of the Universe
Page 3 explicates the three phases of the deities of each of the subdivisions
of the Cosmic Music (except for the subdivisions 1 and 4, which have only one deity each).
3:1-33. The first line on this page defines a perennial principle: all things of heaven and earth are created by three forces. The following lines expand on the operation of this principle, illustrating how the deity that rules each subdivision of the Cosmic Music consists of three phases or
aspects (excepting subdivisions | and 4, which are stated to have only one deity each). The three “forces” or aspects are defined in two ways:
.. one masculine, one feminine, and one mediator;
one active, one passive, one impartial. (3:6-—7)
The three lowest “music” levels can also fit into this scheme: Solar (masculine), Nature (feminine), and Human (mediator).

When we codify the arrangement of table 3A into a number
sequence using the numbering to the right if the deity names, the fol
lowing arrangement results:

The triplicities can be correlated by moving counterclockwise around the chart. The example shown indicates the trinary deities of 7, 14, and
20: Teoyaomiqui (7), Mictecacihuatl (14), and Mictlantecuhtli (20).
These three deities are the masculine, mediating, and feminine aspects of the eighth subdivision, as can be seen by referring back to table 3A. Of the eight subdivisions, only six partake of the tripartite scheme. If we thereby disregard levels 1 and 4 (because they are “only One”) levels 2 and 3 appear paired. Consequently, by structural analogy we can likewise pair levels 5 and 6, as well as levels 7 and 8, and derive three paired levels as in the following table:

The point of this structural analysis is to show how the topic explored on
page 4 of the codex, the six classes of divine game, is a logical outgrowth of the text on page 3. It is helpful to visualize the encoded information
with the aid of these diagrams, for they reveal a structural evolution char
acteristic of the unfolding cosmos itself. We are thus led to see not only
a tripartite division of six of the eight subdivisions, but also the pairing of the six tripartite subdivisions into three groups. (Note: The phrase “six classes of divine game” is used here in the same sense that we use “five aspects of Hindu religion”: divine game [singular] is subdivided into six
classes.)

Page 4: Six Classes, Four States of Matter, and Four Seasons of Time
Each world is the play of three gods,
three forces and their field of action. (4:1—2)
4:1-9. Combining the three forces in all their permutations gives rise to
six classes of divine game. The order of the three forces—masculine (A in
Table 4), mediator (B), feminine (C)—defines the six classes that the
codex lists as growth, decadence, purification, infirmity, curation, and
regeneration (4:7—9). The classes can be paired to reveal three primary types of activity, as shown in the following table.
TABLE 4: THE SIX CLASSES OF DIVINE GAME
FORCE (MASCULINE DIVINE GAME TYPE OF ACTIVITY MEDIATOR, FEMININE)
ABC Growth Growth and regeneration
CBA Regeneration
BAC Decadence Decadence and infirmity
GAB Infirmity
ACB Curing Curing and purification
BCA Purification
Notice that the order of the three forces in each pair are mirror images of
each other. For example, A-B-C (Growth) is paired with C-B-A (Regenera
tion). The importance of this patterning is that it reveals a self-consistent and logical, yet deeply hidden, structure of the codex. The lines on page 4 that imply this interpretation seem poetically inspired and we wouldn't suspect them to contain such a coherent cosmological structure, and yet a careful parsing out of each line reveals important insights. The six classes, grouped into three paired phrases, can further be distilled into three terms:

The six processes create “all which occurs or may occur.” These permutations are finer divisions of a trinary cosmology that we might compare to the three principles of Egyptian sacred science, which are based
on the square roots of 2, 3, and 5.8
4:10-19. The three forces are governed by four states of matter, four deities, and four seasons or time divisions. Table 5 clearly illustrates the deity/matter governance relationships.

4. Cihuacoatl, Woman Serpent Inert, current matter: Earth
Notice in the table that the elemental states of fire, water, and
wind/air are dynamic matter states, whereas earth is called an inert cur
rent (or conduit) of all forces (4:18—19).

and the four deities who govern them.

Let us recall how valuable it was to combine, in table 4, the three
forces (A, B, and C) in all their different combinations. We diagrammed
the permutations (or total combinations) to reveal the construction of the six classes of divine game. Here, in tables 5 and 6, the three forces
combine with the four seasons and the four elemental states of matter.
Earth (corresponding to winter) is designated an inert state of matter,
however, so earth’s combination with the three forces yields three passive states. Consequently, we can diagram the permutation of the three forces
with the remaining three dynamic seasons/states, to generate a total of nine active states. Thus, nine active states, plus three inert states, total twelve states.

Fig. 5.3. The interaction ofelements, seasons, and space
This representation depicts how the three forces (masculine, mediator, and feminine) combine with four temporal quarters and the four states of matter. Also, we may presume that spatial considerations are
implicit in this model, since the four temporal seasons always correspond
to the four cardinal directions in Mesoamerican cosmology. The text can thereby be understood as providing insight into the interrelatedness of
space and time, a profound viewpoint that Western science attributes to the theories of Albert Einstein. Table 7 and figure 5.2 generate important visual illustrations of how
space and time are interwoven on page 4 of the codex. In addition, the integration of this “unified space-time” model with the four elements and the three forces suggests a profound understanding of natural processes, including those affecting Earth cycles and the inner life of humanity. This
connection between natural processes in the environment and the inner, spiritual, unfolding of humanity can be explained only by the presence of universal principles, and is the basis of oracular systems such as the Chinese I Ching.

Page 5: The Calendar and World Ages: Consciousness of the Rhythms of the Gods
Tonalpohualli is the Aztec name for the 260-day sacred calendar, which the Maya call the tzo/kin (count of days). According to the text of the codex, the 260-day cycle is based upon the cycles of Mercury, Venus, and
Mars, which are as follows:
Mercury: 117 days Venus: 585 days Mars: 780 days
Parallel to this runs the solar year (365 days). The planets are the Divine Many and the solar cycle is the Divine One. Just how the 260day cycle is the key to the other planetary cycles becomes clear when we look at their numerical relationships:
260 = 225x117 260 = 44x 585 260 = “x 780 260 = %%x 390 (Mixcdatl)
The 390-day period in the last equation above probably refers to Saturn. The synodic cycle of Saturn is actually 378 days while Jupiter is 399 days; perhaps this 390-day cycle represents an average of the two?
Or, more likely, the Saturn period was approximated in order to allow a simple mathematical relationship with 260. We know that the Maya approximated the four phases of the Venus cycle for the same reason. The codex tells us that after 9 x 260 days, Mercury, Venus, and Mars
unite (5:36—37). After 73 x 260 days, the Holy Year of the Planets (5:40-41) coincides with the Sun (this is the Calendar Round period of just under 52 years). After 108 x 260 days (roughly 77 years), the rhythm of the inner
planets unite with the outer planets (Saturn and Jupiter). Such is the duration of a person's life (28,080 days). Here we see an important con

It is easy to see how all the smaller cycles fit into the period of 468 years, which equals 170,820 days:
468 years = 170,820 days 170,820 days = 117 (Mercury) x 1,460 = 260 (the tonalpohualli) x 657 = 585 (Venus) x 292 = 780 (Mars) x 219 = 365 (Sun) x 468
This period of 468 years is 9 Calendar Rounds, the period of an age of civilization. Such an accounting is found in other Central Mexican picture books. Tony Shearer, the author who is responsible for dating the
famous Harmonic Convergence event of August 1987, identified 1987 as the year when the nine hell realms would end, because 1987 is 468 years
after the year that Cortés arrived (1519).? However, the tracking of a Calendar Round should begin with a known New Fire ceremony, because New Fire ceremonies always occurred at the end of a Calendar Round.
We have it on record that the last New Fire was performed in 1507; thus 1975 would have been the end of the nine hell realms. The calendar portion of page 5 shows that celestial cycles and human
cycles are related, and the key that unites the celestial and human realms is the 260-day tonalpohualli. In understanding these rhythms, we understand the rhythms of the gods—the divine principles that guide human spiritual unfolding. Now we can engage in some philosophical reflections on the contents of page 5.



COMMENTARY

5:1-6. We are compelled to war, love, and do what we do by the “thythm of the great gods.” This is presented as a truth: First, seekers must understand that they accomplish nothing by themselves, that they owe all they are and do to a greater being and are intimately related to
everything through higher cycles and larger forces. With this admission, they can learn to serve “the gods,” (i.e., the planetary energies that inform the Earth). Human beings can become conscious of the rhythms
of the planets.
5:7-23. The sacred calendar of 260 days is the key to the astrological mirroring of the celestial and human realms. The 365-day solar cycle is the mundane agricultural calendar that structures the exoteric dimension
of human experience. Together, however, these two cycles form the One and the Many and combine to generate a union of the sacred and the sec
ular, the esoteric and the exoteric, in the 52-year Calendar Round.
5:24-30. The 365-day Year of the Sun operates “parallel” to the 260-day tonalpohualli; together they represent a double play of divinity, one secular and one sacred, one the play of the Many, one the play of the One.
The fact that these two realities, the Many and the One, are seen to operate in tandem is a profound conception in Nahuatl metaphysics. It reconciles a logical contradiction that troubles many philosophies. The
Many are fragments of the One, but even in a fragmented state they retain a solidarity of intent and action with the primal state of Unity. A closely related conception may be found in the Tzutujil paradigm of Jaloj Kexoj (hah-low kay-show). In my book Mayan Sacred Science (Boulder,
Colo.: Four Ahau Press, 1994) I explain this concept as a combination of two processes of change, one based on “flowering” or replications of a primal unity at successive scales of unfolding, and one characterized by “multiplicity” or the binary expansion/fragmentation of a system’s elements as it evolves. The entire conception is based on the Tzutujil creation myth called “Flowering Mountain Earth.”'®

5:36—39. It is somewhat unusual in Mesoamerican calendars to point out that 9 tonalpohuallis (2,340 days) allow a commensuration of the cycles of Mercury, Venus, and Mars. The period is 6.41 years.
5:40-45. The New Fire is kindled at the end of every 52-year Calendar Round period. This is consistent with the New Fire tradition, and according to the chronicler Sahaguin, it involved rekindling fire from the
chest of a sacrificial victim when the Pleiades passed through the zenith
precisely at midnight. At this moment the sun is at nadir, thus the solar fire is pulled up from under the earth while the Pleiadian light is brought
down, creating a kind of axis of energy running from nadir to zenith. The
codex refers to the New Fire as the “son of the Sun,” which makes sense because it initiates a new Calendar Round cycle and all the fires in the city and outlying regions are relit from it.
5:46—50. It is stated that 108 tonalpohualli is the duration of a man’s life. The number 108 is sacred to Buddhists and Hindus as well. The period of 108 tonalpohualli is almost 77 years.
5:51—55. Here we learn the duration of an age, the life of a culture. It is equal to 468 years or 9 Calendar Rounds, when all the planets and cycles shine together in the same form, that is, meet again at their beginnings. This period is found in other Central Mexican World Age accountings. The idea that planetary cycles combine to make a large cycle—a World
Age—is the preferred perspective of the Central Mexicans, who favored the Calendar Round and its attendant New Fire Ceremony as the way to track and calculate World Ages. This method began with the Teotihuacanos around 312 C.E. and continued to be used by the ninthcentury Toltecs of Tula and the fifteenth-century Aztecs. The last reported New Fire ceremony occurred in 1507.'' By comparison, the Maya used the Long Count calendar and considered the precession of the equinoxes to be the determining factor in calculating World Ages. The first five pages of the Pyramid of Fire have a certain completeness unto themselves. With page 6, the narrative shifts, and we find that pages 6-8 teach the esoteric, yogic secrets of spiritual awakening and ascent.

Page 6: Sun and Moon, Two Classes of Men, and the Meaning of Sacrifice
6:1-—6. The Sun and the Moon rule over Earth. The various domains of nature include owo classes of humans, which can be described simply as
“conscious” and “unconscious,” or “internally oriented” and “externally oriented.” The externally oriented human is lost in the world of appear
ances and cannot see the essence within that connects all phenomena and defines all relations. The superior (internally oriented) human is on a
path of deepening insight and utilizes penance and sacrifice to open the
‘wings of the soul.” For cultures that value hedonism (modern American
consumer culture, for example), this teaching sounds highly undesirable. Such a teaching, however, is found in many spiritual traditions: Spiritual growth requires a sacrifice. Psychologically speaking, personal sacrifice involves transcending or “putting into perspective” self-interest, so that a
higher truth can be served. It is all about letting go, transcending the ego, and dissolving boundaries. It is not about feeling guilty or being “holier than thou” or seeking penitential pain, although disentangling ourselves trom our addictions and immature desires can give rise to suffering. This is, however, a divine suffering that unfolds the “wings of the soul,” a metaphor often found in Nahuatl religious poetry.
6:13—16. The man who makes offerings to the gods is in touch with the root and origin of all; he can act consciously and “truly is*—that is, he can become self-realized. In any person we can distinguish two selves called the lower self, and the higher self. The lower self is the ego identity consisting of all that relates to personality and identity. The higher self (sometimes referred to in the writings of Carl Jung as the Self) refers to the center and source of the individual being. The Self archetype, in Jungs terminology, is the center and totality of the psyche that continuously urges us to achieve wholeness. Mesoamerican Indians would call it the first ancestor, and through ceremonial offerings a two-way channel of communication could be opened with it, as well as with more immediate ancestors such as grandmothers and grandfathers.

6:17~26. The man who is attached to his lower nature, to his physical
being that dies and is therefore time-bound and limited, will be devoured by the arth in due time, This view is not unlike a profound text called The Secret ofGolden Flower sro Vaoist secret teachings. In this human life we have a rare opportunity to develop a spiritual body through perfecting certain practices, The initiate is taught to conserve the vital fluid (sexual energy) and turn it inward to feed the creation of an immortal diamond body that will survive body death.’
6:27—31. The superior man develops his soul to become good food for
Jonatiuh, the Sun. In other words, his soul is developed to be free and conscious 60 that it can be liberated by being fed to or dissolved into the unmanifest ground of being or unqualified light of Tonatiuh, The eating metaphor is a poetic way of referring to the dissolution of the incarnated being back into the unmanifest, eternal, and infinite ground of all manifestation—the “light” ofTonatiuh, Thus, like the maguey spines resting on their bed, the liberated soul can find its true resting place, the Hill of Heaven, Shis image suggests a high point of the sky, a cosmic center, the top of a mountain or pyramid, In addition, because Mesoamerican cultures saw the night sky as the underworld, the Hill of Heaven might also be seen as the deepest point of the underworld, which is the “deathdoor’ —the portal into and out ofthe Earth realm. In this sense it can be equated with the “cave of creation” or the mother’s birth canal.

Pages 7 and % have excellent pictographs associated with them. In this case they are taken from the Codex Borbonicus. Studying the pictures while reading the text can help to clarify just how the picture books were used as memory devices for performing the contents of the codex.

with the Pole Star or the polar axis, but here we see him connected with other celestial features that point to a different part of the sky. Mesoamerican astronomy recognized three cosmic centers: the Pole Star, the zenith (the center of the sky, directly overhead), and the Galactic
Center.!3 What can be said briefly is that the dark rift in the Milky Way, which is near the Galactic Center, was considered to be a portal to the Otherworld—that is, a birthplace in the sky. It also happens to be located at the crossroads formed by the Milky Way and the ecliptic; for Mesoamerican cosmologists such celestial crosses symbolized the concept of center. Without even emphasizing the Galactic Center, we can look at how the text describes Tezcatlipoca as a Falcon Herald of the Gods, wearing solar and Milky Way symbols. The only places where the sun and the Milky Way can join are at the two crossing points of Milky Way and the
ecliptic, one in Sagittarius and one in Gemini. The one in Sagittarius
where the dark rift is located (the “entrance to the Kingdom of Matter”)is surmounted by the Hawk constellation called Aquila (the Eagle) in European astronomy. It is recognized as the Xic (Hawk) constellation by the Maya. The Falcon Herald, Tezcatlipoca, offers the (latent) wings of the soul to the newborn as a gift from the gods. In other words, the place in the sky pointed to by these features is the place of escape and spiritual freedom, the celestial Sun Door at World’s End."
7:14-17. These lines suggest that the human spinal column is a microcosmic reflection of the World Tree, a centipede that can sprout the wings
of liberation. Another related metaphor, found in other Nahuatl poems, is the butterfly emerging from the cocoon. We see this portrayed on the beautiful Aztec statue of Xochipilli, the prince of flowers, and is symbolized by the statue's spiritual meaning.
7:18—23. The skull (bones), heart (viscera), and head (personality) are left to decay on earth after the soul (life force) has flown, returning to its source. This depiction can be stated simply as: though bodies die, life does not.

Page 9: Descending and Ascending Processes and the Wings of the Soul
This page presents several spiritual images within the metaphor of the hydrological cycle of water: Water evaporates and returns to the celestial realm of the clouds, then pours down again to begin the cycle anew. In all realms where ascent and descent occurs, Chalchiuhtlicue oversees the downward flow, while Tlaloc rules the upward ascent. Evaporation is an apt image for the dissolution and return of the soul into unity with the
unmanifest ground of being, the transcendent light of Tonatiuh. In the text the down-up process is equated with man’s forgetting and remembering, the divergence from (down) and return to (up) the celestial source. Pulque, an alcoholic beverage specified as the cause of man’s forgetting, is used as a poetic device in the story of the fall and redemption
of Quetzalcoatl. (See appendix | for a brief retelling of the myth.) Time is the downward flow. The upward return to the source, on the
wings of the soul, is a fight against time’s current. The wings of the soul hide in the past because they were given at the beginning oflife and must
be reanimated; time’s downward decay has eroded them. A regeneration or “backward flowing method” must be implemented, which is the method employed in the Taoist sacred book The Secret of the Golden Flower. This energy sublimation is taken up further on page 10.

Page 10: Energy Sublimation and the Awakening of the Divine Life
10:1—5. Quetzalcoatl is the redeemed or regenerated man, one who has experienced the apotheosis or visionary ascent/initiation into the divine
light.
10:6—7. The inner circle is made up of those who are ascending the axis of spiritual unfolding, those who thereby link the mundane and transcendent realms through having opened or awakened the vertical conduit. This vertical conduit provides release from the horizontal flow of time and the vicissitudes of the cycle of reincarnation.
10:8—-15. By activating the solar germ of consciousness (coatl) within his semen, man grows his spiritual wings. The lowly centipede transforms into a Plumed Serpent who can touch (or fly to) the spiritual heights.
10:16—30. Here we have uncompromising sublimation imagery. The
energy that normally flows outward into material manifestation can be turned inward to fuel an involution of the spirit. It is consistent with Nahuatl spiritual philosophy to portray the outward flow of vital energy
as spitting and cruel, because it is inimical to the re-absorption into light and the ultimate peace sought by those training to be Quetzalcoatls. Such a perspective is also found in Hindu, Buddhist, and Gnostic spirituality, and is often criticized as being world-denying. But the Bodhisattva vow
of the enlightened being who chooses to remain in the world for the benefit of all beings implies that an enlightened being can exist in the world while transcending it in spirit. This is actually the natural state of a fully actualized being and is not world denying, but instead is simultaneously world embracing and world transcending. Contrary to popular (and even
doctrinal) misconceptions, transcendence is inclusive of, not separated from, that which it transcends.
Through effort, sacrifice, and love, man turns his own “poison” inward and digests it and transforms it into spiritual vision. Celibacy is presented
as an essential component of this path, a view that is shared in the true

10:31—36. These lines are somewhat obscure. Quetzalcoatl is “also” the planet Venus and is part of a trinity of deities associated with Venus. The
text tells us (10:34-36) that Itzpapdlotl (Obsidian Butterfly; Venus as
evening star) governs the growth, death, and rebirth of creatures, while Quetzalcoatl governs the growth, death, and rebirth of the souls of human beings. This indicates that Quetzalcoatl is a spiritual redeemer who, like Christ, knows how to resurrect/regenerate himself and thus can guide other souls to do the same. He oversees the second birth, the birth of the soul into a divine existence beyond dualities and the endless wheel of animal propagation. Upon meditating on these lines I believe I’ve discerned what this distinction implies: Quetzalcoatl represents a higher aspect of Venus and may represent the Pleiades (or perhaps the Pleiades in conjunction with Venus). Although he later came to be identified with Venus, Quetzalcoatl’s earliest association was with the Pleiades. He is first found at Teotihuacan in the third century C.E.!° His role in the New Fire ceremony (such as at the



COMMENTARY
= Vege
Pyramid of Kukulcan-Quetzalcoatl at Chichen Itza) and the central role of
the Pleiades in the New Fire tradition support such a view. While his astro
nomical identification here is speculative, his archetypal role is clear: Quetzalcoatl oversees the spiritual rebirth of humankind.
Page 11: Solar Fire Purification and Sacrifice
This page is essential to clarifying the Nahuatl understanding of sacrifice.
11:1-7. Occult here simply means “hidden’—a hidden solar/soul energy buried (imprisoned) by illusion and the impermanence of the body. The
solar soul energy originates in the Sun—that is, in Tonatiuh, which is the
visible conduit of the Unmanifest Being above the Sun, Tloque Nahuaque.
Man can liberate his soul energy, but sacrifice is necessary. In becoming a
Quetzalcoatl, the man “must sacrifice the desires and habits that he adores”
(11:5) in order to finally return to his immaterial and absolute source, cen
ter, or origin. He must separate or differentiate the eternal heart/soul from
the imprisoning matrix of impermanence that encases it. The sacrifice is a consciously willed, personal, inner sacrifice of the false identity that masks or obscures the true self, “keeping it a prisoner” (11:7).
11:8-13. These lines seem almost like an aside, but provide a clue to dating the codex. “In recent times . . .” must refer to a period just preceding the barbaric sacrifices of the terminal pre-Conquest Aztecs (some time in the late 1400s). For don Daniel to include this, he must be reading a mnemonic device in the codex itself that was specifically intended to warn of the danger of taking literally the doctrine of heart sacrifice, which would lead to “superstition” and “degeneration.” Such a message in pictographic form might appear to be to the uninitiated eye an affirmation of literal heart sacrifice, rather than a warning to avoid it. We may wonder if the codices already interpreted by scholars portray a similar warning, and how it can be distinguished from an affirmation of literal sacrifice. I have always felt that the criticism of Aztec sacrifice rituals as intolerable examples of human barbarity is hypocritical. In the late 1400s the Inquisition in Europe was headed by the ambitious Dominican prior Fray

Tomas de Torquemada. The Inquisition, founded and authorized by the Pope's decree, used paid informers, armed enforcers, and a reign of terror to mount a campaign of annihilation against Jews and other “heretical groups” in Spain and Portugal. Thousands of people died, including wo
men, the elderly, and children. Hundreds of thousands were dispersed to marginalized domains on the Continent.'” And this was only one chapter in the Inquisition’s 200-year love affair with torturing and murdering Europes undesirables. The Catholic Church sponsored similar atrocities against Native Americans after Europeans arrived in the New World. In Nahuatl religious poetry we often find a distinction between good magic and bad magic. Even during the phase of Aztec civilization when
human hearts were being torn out without any spiritual intent, we can
suspect that the true teachings were still known and practiced in some sectors. Any high culture—including our own—engages simultaneously in the full range of human activities, from the grossest debaucheries to
the highest epiphanies. Modern scholars and the media, often following
the well-known journalistic motto “if it bleeds, it leads,” have focused overmuch on one aspect of the Aztec and Mayan cultures and thereby continue to promulgate stereotypes of these cultures. Such limited perspectives prevent an accurate understanding of the deep and profound teachings of the Aztec and Maya, teachings that are subtle enough to require more focus and attention than the average person today is willing to muster. This situation speaks more for the degradation of modern civ
ilization than for the degeneration of Aztec civilization.
11:14. As the Pyramid of Fire suggests, the result of such degeneration and
superstition is “terrible,” especially when “fear unites with knowledge.” Here we are provided with a warning that knowledge and power can be used to provoke fear to control the masses. When such a practice arises
among a civilization’s leaders, as it did, for example, in Nazi Germany, tyranny runs rampant while freedoms are curtailed. This degenerate state
signals the end-game of a culture on the brink of self-destruction.
11:15-17. These lines reiterate the impassioned refrain: The true, eternal
heart made of the energy of Tonatiuh must be “torn out” of the false being

and offered (sacrificed/returned) “to the light.” This is followed by an invocation that presages the dramaturgy of page 13: “Lord of Fire, burn my
false self” In other words, “purify me to be a channel of the divine light!”
11:18-19. Reading carefully these two lines—‘Itztli, Obsidian Knife, liberate my heart’—we can note that they reveal a distinct difference between real sacrifice, for which only an obsidian knife would be used, and the description of sacrifice in the condemnations of lines 8-13. In chapter 6 we will explore in more depth this distinction between literal and metaphorical sacrifice. Here in the codex these meditations on sacrifice are precursors to the New Fire sacrifice at the end of time that is the focus of page 13.
Page 12: Universal Uniting Energy, Sacrifice, and Transcending Death
12:1-13. Marvelous and terrible indeed! “The sacrificial knife” of lines 1-2 must have a larger meaning here, because following in lines 4—13 is a long litany of things from which it liberates “blood” or soul essence
including the deer, the criminals, the lance of power, the incense burner, the soul, the solar system, and even “every star.” The sacrificial knife might be the scythe of death itself, but not a normal death, for in lines 20-25 we are told to “defraud death by sacrificing life.” In other words, a conscious sacrificial death 7s the sacrificial knife and yields a different result from a normal death, which is the destiny of all things on earth and in the universe that have been born and embodied but have not experi
enced the second birth ofthe spirit.
12:14-18. These lines are profound, revealing that “the blood” referred to here is not normal blood, but something like chi or shakti: “the universal unity, the one creative principle crystallizing into myriad forms.” In other words, like the tonalpohualli and the year cycle (the combined calendars of 260 and 365 days), this blood is the One and the Many. The Maya call it chulel—blood as a kind of universal chi flowing through everything. And it returns to Unity (to the unmanifest ground of being)

Page 13: End Time Conflagration and the Visionary Ascent
As mentioned earlier, this page was lost until Marty's friend sent me a tape of Marty’s reading from the early 1960s. A remaining mystery, how
ever, is the identity of the place-name in line 2: Cauhlacan. The subject of page 13 is the New Fire ceremony and the ultimate sacrifice that must be made upon ascending the pyramid of fire and meeting with Divinity (Quetzalcoatl, God of Renewal). The fire is the fire of purification that burns the dross of all mortal desire and illusion. By consciously
entering into the fire of death and transfiguration, death is defrauded.
13:1-3. Here we see the conflation or parallel meaning of the personal visionary ascent (in which death is a reabsorption into the unmanifest
ground of being) and the universal conflagration at “the end of time.” In keeping with the fiery conflagration imagery, the personal ascent is also described as a burning of a person's constituent parts. This page is basically a description of the New Fire ceremony. The



COMMENTARY
P20 ae
World Age doctrine of the Aztecs required that the New Fire ceremony
be performed at the end of every 52-year Calendar Round, timed by the Pleiades passing through the zenith at midnight. At this moment the sun is at nadir. In Aztec eschatology the world would come to an end if the
Pleiades did not reach the zenith precisely at midnight.*
13:49. Here, the cycle of time has ended, and the fire of dissolution is spreading. This is the universal conflagration or ekpyrosis that is heavily emphasized in Gnostic eschatology and Jewish apocalypse literature.
“Twelve steps” (13:8) implies thirteen stations, from “the cave of the womb” to the “final conflagration” (13:8—9). In fact a system of caves was found under one of the main pyramids at Teotihuacan, which is proba
bly the womb-cave referred to here.
13:10-19. Now the process of disrobing/dissolution/sacrifice begins—all the mortal parts of the incarnate being are thrown into the fire, and it is the seven planetary gods, like some Mesoamerican Annunaki, that “throw my constituent parts into the fire” (13:12). This process is exactly like that which occurs in the Gnostic ascent, a connection we will explore more closely in chapter 6.
Marty long ago mentioned to me that page 13 involved the New Fire, as suggest by the use of the Hill of the Star and the context of ultimate world-renewal at the end of time—the end of the “period of waiting.” The metaphysical connection of the seven planetary gods making the sacrifice is to the seven chakras being opened up by the “fire” of Kundalini (which, in the Mesoamerican ideology, is ruled by Quetzalcoatl-Kukulcan).
13:20-27. The tenor of the dramaturgy increases: “[T]he flames ragé in consummation!” And finally, “obscurity disappears” (the obscurity of the
* The New Fire ceremony was performed more than two dozen times beginning around 312 c.£., and yet the world did not end. The Pleiades failed to reach the zenith at midnight on the projected day as a result of precession, but this was adjusted for many times. In Maya Cosmogenesis 2012 | explain the true nature of the New Fire as a tradition for tracking precession. A precession-based connection between the Calendar Round and Long Count might be evident in the fact that 73 tun equal 72 haab.

Smoking Mirror in which “man does not see clearly’—see 2:16-17). The occluded vision is purified “as the flames rise to the throne of Tonatiuh” (i.e., as the soul returns to its source)—the place of “the purest light.” What a beautiful expression of the eschatological apotheosis of soul and world! It is quite a dramatic vision of the New Fire ceremony—not just any New Fire ceremony (of which there were many without the world actually ending) but the final one.* It marks the end of time, the end of the world, the end of the soul’s endless round of reincarnationthe beginning of a higher life. As a dramaturgy, or dramatic performance, the reading of the Pyramid of Fire is intended to transport the initiate into the experience described. This may be too much to ask for in the modern-day context, but in our reading of the Pyramid of Fire we can at least open up to the Nahuatl understanding of cosmology, astrology, yoga, calendar cycles, spiritual ascent, sacrifice, worldly impermanence—and our ability to connect with the transcendent and absolute Source of All. Such a pursuit is a central concern of all traditions that represent the perennial philosophy. Simply stated: all true knowledge comes from an ecstatic connection
to the transcendent.!”
Conversations with Marty
In late 1995, I recorded my phone conversations with Marty. In our discussions he clarified certain passages in the Pyramid of Fire and commented on ancient Mesoamerican methods of teaching sacred knowledge. He also shared difficulties in his work of transcribing and translating the text and some details about his relationship with don Daniel.
When I asked Marty why both Tloque Nahuaque and Tonatiuh were “One,” he said “because they are both centers of complete systems.” He
* The details of what this means require a careful reconstruction of the astronomical dimensions of the New Fire ceremony, which can be found in my book Maya Cosmogenesis 2012. Suffice it to say that the New Fire timing was successfully adapted, at least at Chichén Itza, to correlate with the Mayan end-date of 2012.

preferred Tloque Nahuaque to be identified as the “Lord of the [Intimate
Vicinity” rather than “Lord of the Close Vicinity,” as most academic
sources have it. /ntimate implies an immanence, an all-pervading quality
that Marty saw in Tloque Nahuaque, whereas for him close retained too much of a spatial bias. His insight here is that transcendence is inclu
sive—that is, the transcendent being is not above or apart from the world.
Although infinite and immaterial, it pervades all finite manifestation,
thus the term intimate is more appropriate. Divination was a topic that interested Marty a great deal. His travels
in Mesoamerica and Asia allowed him to see parallels between oracles used in both places. In one of the Aztec myths Tezcatlipoca is the onefooted deity who dances around the Pole Star. Marty pointed to a similar Chinese interest in the Pole Star by reading a passage from a book entitled Fortune-Telling by Mah Jonge:
At some stage in the development of the Shih it became a custom to spin a spoon round on its bowl, and observe the direction in
which the handle pointed. No doubt generations of parents have before and since been irritated by their children discovering this lit
tle trick for themselves. The reasons for spinning the spoon on the
Shih, however, were much more profound. The ancient Chinese
astronomers used a quite different method of observation to that of the astronomers of Babylonian times. Of paramount impor
tance in the Chinese celestial sphere was the Pole Star, and the con
stellation Ursa Major which pointed to it. To the Chinese this con
stellation, known in the West as the Great Bear, was known, and
still is, as the Ladle. The configuration of the seven stars which
make up the Ladle therefore had considerable significance; it was
at least one of the most recognizable constellations in the night sky,
and for this reason it was often found depicted on religious flags.
It was natural, therefore, for this group of stars to be depicted at
the centre of the Shih. The next step was the inclusion of an actual
ladle as a spinning pointer—a tangible representation of a heavenly, and therefore mystical, phenomenon. .. . Then there came a
dramatic innovation. The spinning spoon was replaced by a very

Marty's criticism of education in Western cultures seemed right on target: “In Western schooling we take children and make them respond to authority, and this teaches you everything about the superficial aspects of things—weights and measures and the like— but none of that is really important. Understanding is what is really important—inner knowingbut that is not offered in Western education.”
I asked Marty about teaching methods in ancient Mesoamerica, and his response related directly to the Pyramid of Fire. He said, “That question relates to Mystery Schools and initiation, which you had in Mesoamerica and in many other parts of the ancient world. Education in Mesoamerica involved going through a death in order to be born into
knowledge. Symbolic death is the beginning of education, and this is a key to understanding the Pyramid of Fire codex.” Because the Mesoamerican approach to knowledge was so different
from the basic assumptions of Western education, problems would clearly arise from Western scholars trying to interpret Aztec and Mayan docu
ments. Marty was well aware of these issues, saying, “If you follow the academics you'll get confused because they all are offering different interpretations. For lack of native sources, you have to go to Spanish sources and to the histories of the Spanish monks. But the problem there is that they come from a cultural tradition that was so judgmental, and actually quite primitive intellectually. They had no ability to understand the philosophi
cal importance of the native ideas.”

Marty further observed that scholars can label something a “ceremonial object” and then everyone nods their heads and believes they know what it is. According to Marty, this was an example of scholars “using overconfident language,” which leads to them “peddling erroneous ideas.” Given these problems, it seemed to me that what was so important about the Pyramid of Fire was that it was a direct reading of the pictographs. Marty said Daniel was “a quite different source for the knowledge of what the document is about. Daniel got his interpretation on a direct line from his grandfather—memorized on a straight descent from the Conquest period.” Marty was well acquainted with the academic literature and was quick to credit some scholars with being more tuned in than others. For example, he especially appreciated the work of Miguel Leén-Portilla, and said that the studies of Henry Nicholson were good for understanding some aspects of the Aztec deities.” He also appreciated the views of a scholarly translator named John
Greenway, who wrote an introductory essay to A History ofAncient Mexico: The Religion and Ceremonies ofthe Aztec Indians. Marty read a lengthy passage from Greenway’s introduction that lamented a major problem in the transcription of Aztec literacy into English, taking as an example the Aztec word amatlacuilolitquitcatlaxtlahuitl.*” Marty laughed, “How can you transcribe that into English?” His own work to transcribe the Pyramid of Fire must have met with similar difficulties. The feeling in Greenway’s commentary is that English is not as subtle or sophisticated as the Aztec language,” a claim that has also been made for ancient Sanskrit, which contains many more words, tenses, and inflections than modern English. ‘The idea that Marty found so fascinating, and which resonated with his own convictions, is that modern languages are less complex and less capable of subtle conceptual distinctions than ancient languages. [his of course also implies that the modern mind is less refined than the ancient mind—a heretical suggestion that challenges the myth of progress (the belief that modern man is in all ways more advanced and
refined than ancient man). According to Marty’s belief, the Aztecs, Tibetans, the Eskimos, the
Chinese—in essence, most of the ancient cultures—were “close to nature”

and derived their wisdom by “learning about things directly,” by having a
gnostic approach to acquiring wisdom through direct inner experience. Such direct inner knowing can dawn through reading the Pyramid of Fire out loud repeatedly, pronouncing all the Aztec words clearly. The deeper
meanings and interconnections of multivalent concepts will come alive,
and realizations will occur. These are realizations about the universal, eternal principles that create, sustain, and devour life in all its myriad manifes
tations through time. Such inner realization confirms the universal teach
ings and insights of the codex.



)) Gnostic and Perennial
‘Parallels to the
Pyramid of Fire
Marty begins his introduction to this book with a quote from Aldous Huxley that defines the perennial philosophy as a universal wisdom that can be identified in many of the world’s traditions. The quote comes from an introduction Huxley wrote to the Bhagavad Gita, in which he also listed the following four principles shared by all perennial philosophies:!
1. The entire world of phenomenal manifestation (including individ
ualized consciousness) arises from an unmanifest, immaterial, Divine Ground.
2. Human beings are capable of a direct experience of the Divine Ground, and such an experience is a way of knowing superior to
discursive reasoning. 3. Human beings possess a double nature made up of a finite ego self and an eternal divine self.
4. The purpose of human life is to reunite with the higher divine self, and that Supreme Identity is equivalent to the Divine Ground of all manifestation.
The Pyramid of Fire, representing Nahuatl cosmology and religion, fulfills all of these criteria. Thus, we must expand the Euro-Asian focus of Traditionalist studies to include Nahuatl metaphysics as a legitimate perennial paradigm.

Two topics that we have explored include the oracular Aztec divinatory calendar and the Aztec eight-level cosmogonic scheme. Much has already been written about the Mesoamerican invention and use of divinatory calendars,* and divination with calendrical overtones is a universal tradition in and of itself (perhaps best formulated in the Taoist I Ching). In addition, we have examined the Mesoamerican eight-level cosmology in the context of Gurdjieff’s Ray of Creation, and can draw
parallels from it to other Neo-Platonic, Islamic, and Gnostic models of
the celestial spheres, which usually have eight spheres, but sometimes have as many as ten or twelve. We could even discuss Dante’s model in The Divine Comedy and Johannes Kepler’s Harmony of the Spheres as examples of late applications of the same type of celestial cosmology. The word cosmology should be emphasized, for it differentiates a primordial appreciation for cosmos-logos (cosmic knowledge) from the later scientific obsession with cosmography (cosmos graphing), which seeks only to map
the cosmos, not to understand it. In fact, the very title of Kepler's early seventeenth-century work Mysterium Cosmographicum set the stage for an unfortunate shift to a more limited scientific perception of the universe. There are many parallels between the Pyramid of Fire and major and minor points identifiable in traditional cosmologies. As Marty himself said, the problem with examining the codex’s parallels to other traditions
is knowing where to stop. Those we will look at more closely here are:
1. The Hermetic principle of “As above, so below” (the foundation of
astrology) and the holographic principle, “The microcosm reflects
the macrocosm”



GNOSTIC AND PERENNIAL PARALLELS TO THE PYRAMID OF FIRE
128
2. The notion that the Transcendent Deity is inclusive: the Lord of the Intimate (instead of Close) Vicinity highlights the idea that tran
scendence is inclusive of that which it transcends
3. The World Age doctrine and precession (e.g., the Vedic Yugas, and
the New Fire/Calendar Round tracking method) 4. The three sacred science principles in Egyptian, Mayan, Taoist, and
Finnish traditions 5. Impermanence (Taoism/The Book of Changes) vs. Gnostic
nihilism; the non-dualistic (non-mutually exclusive) relationship
between the finite and the infinite
6. Sublimation yoga (becoming a Quetzalcoatl) 7. The notion of sacrifice: self-naughting and self-sacrifice as drawn from Ananda Coomaraswamy's essays
8. Gnostic eschatology, including (a) Ekpyrosis (reference Tzmaeus,
Berossus, and Seneca’s Naturales Quaestiones) and (b) The visionary
ascent (as a dissolution/disrobing), as in the context of Ezekial,
Poimandres, and Innana
1. “As above, so below.” This is a fundamental insight into the structural organization of the universe. Oddly, this principle is quite
often dismissed as a primitive astrological superstition, but its meaning is simple: The processes and patterns in the sky parallel (or reflect) the pat
terns and processes on Earth. Life on Earth has evolved in a field of uni
versal energy, is embedded within it, and the sky and Earth are intimately
connected.
The principle “As above, so below” also involves pattern correlations between seemingly disparate dimensions of the natural world. For exam
ple, the branching patterns in lung tissue (the alveoli) are exactly the same
as those found in leaves and those observed in the satellite imagery of river deltas. This example, however, may be better expressed as “The
microcosm reflects the macrocosm.” In other words, smaller scales reflect
larger scales in the natural order. In modern mathematical theory this idea is in vogue in fractal geometries that can be graphically illustrated. The reason why astronomical processes are believed to reflect processes experienced on Earth, including the subjective experiences of human

“As above, so below” is called the Hermetic dictum because it is usually attributed to the Egyptian-Hellenistic prophet Hermes. Almost all ancient civilizations as well as traditional cultures surviving today assume that the processes of the sky and Earth are connected.
2. Transcendence is inclusive. In some theological circles, particularly in Christian discourse, the idea of a transcendent deity is quite often thought to mean a deity that is completely “other” or “above” or “outside” the created world. The stereotype comes to mind of a bearded Jehovah sitting on a cloud, occasionally deigning to glance down on His Creation to sling judgment. Or there is the more scientific notion of a creative impetus or force that jump-started the world (e.g., the Big Bang), which then has no influence while the world unfolds. This “clockwork universe” conception also speaks for a creative force, a prime mover, that exists outside the realm of the created world. Nahuatl theology and metaphysics identified the highest creator deity as Tloque Nahuaque, who is the unmanifest Ground of all Being. This deity is the Lord of the Intimate Vicinity, meaning that it is always present, in all possible interstices of phenomenal existence, as well as

being the ground or wellspring from which all manifestation arises. To transcend, then, is not simply to rise above or “go beyond” that which is transcended. Transcendence is inclusive of what is transcended; in other words, that which is transcended continues to be a part of the larger field
within which all smaller orders of organization continue to be included. Such a clarification helps us to understand that higher dimensional beings
do not exist in an altogether other order of existence; a five-dimensioned
being contains within it the beings of the fourth and third dimensions. Some metaphysical teachings suggest that the three-dimensional world of
Earth will cease to exist after human beings collectively ascend. Considering the principle of inclusive transcendence, these teachings are mistaken and are likely to generate fear. The basic message of transcendence involves the relationship between
the unmanifest ground of being and the manifest creation. This is the relationship between the infinite and the finite. It is very important to understand that these are not polarized, mutually exclusive opposites. On the contrary, the finite is embedded within the infinite as a latent possibility. In other words, finitude is one of the possible states that infinity can choose to be—if it were otherwise, it could not be considered infinite. The strict
dualism of matter (outwardly finite) and spirit (essentially infinite) that is
often ascribed to Gnosticism can thus be understood in the deeper sense that is taught in Nahuatl metaphysics. On a mythological level this teaching is encoded within the story of Quetzalcoatl’s redemption (see appendix
1), in which consciousness loses itself (the infinite becomes finite) and then regains awareness of its essential ground, which is infinity or eternity. Infinity contains within it all finite manifestations. Although we are elucidating here a teaching from the Pyramid of Fire, we again encounter an essentially Gnostic idea, that of the pleroma,
the infinite plenum that holds within it all latent potentialities and underlies all manifestation. 3. The World Age doctrine. This concept, almost always found in perennial philosophies, is the idea that time moves in cycles and all
processes in nature follow a cyclic pattern: birth, growth, decline, death, rebirth. It unavoidably has an astronomical basis and is closely related to
the creation of calendars in ancient cultures. Given that the scale of

In previous studies I have argued that the New Fire tradition of Central Mexico, tracked with the Calendar Round, keeps track of a pre
cessional shifting involving the Pleiades and the Sun.’ As such, the eschatology we find on page 13 of the codex, because it depicts the New Fire
ceremony, must ultimately be rooted in this large-scale celestial shifting. Generally, to find precessional knowledge in ancient Mesoamerican cultures is neither radical nor surprising, and has been discussed by various Mesoamerican scholars.* Without a doubt, eschatological theologies are linked to certain types of alignments that occur within the 26,000-year precessional cycle (see number 8, below).
4. The three sacred science principles in Egyptian, Mayan, Taoist, and Finnish traditions. In considering these we must first recall that in the Pyramid of Fire all things occur via three forces or principles. Egyptian sacred science was explored by R. A. Schwaller de Lubicz
(Sacred Science) and Robert Lawlor (Sacred Geometry). While this subject is enormously complex, it is sufficient for this overview to state that Egyptian sacred science is based upon the three square-root principles
(the square roots of 2, 3, and 5), which are believed in Egyptian cosmol
ogy to be responsible for the creation, maintenance, and dissolution of
the world. In his introduction to the Taoist Secret ofthe Golden Flower, Richard
Wilhelm associates Hsing (human nature) with Logos and Ming (life) with Eros. These are the first two emergent principles and they correlate with yin and yang. We can assume that the Tao is the overarching primal Unity corresponding to dios (continuing the terminology we have used to identify the three principles). These same three root principles operate within Mayan cosmology
and calendars. In fact, a modern Tzutujil Maya paradigm of change called Jaloj Kexoj (hah-low kay-show), represents two of the three sacred root



GNOSTIC AND PERENNIAL PARALLELS TO THE PYRAMID OF FIRE
132
principles.» The key words for understanding this paradigm are multi
plicity and flowering and, as | mentioned before, these two concepts can be equated with the codex’s idea of the One and the Many united by the Calendar Round’s two cycles: the 260-day sacred cycle and the 365-day year cycle. The third principle in Mayan time philosophy is the squareroot 3 (1.733), which encodes the dynamic of the lunar eclipse rhythm
(173.3 days) and all its philosophical overtones (such as the union of Sun
and Moon, the union of opposites). The trinity of principles found in Mayan sacred science is found in many different forms and can be identified by recognizing cognate symbols and translating parallel metaphors. Other traditions encompass these same principles. In Finland, for example, an ancient epic called the Kalevala tells of the adventures of three heroes. A Finnish mystic named Pekka Ervast interpreted the three Kalevala heroes as exemplars of three evolutionary principles in nature: Intellect, Emotion, and Will.° When we connect these anthropomorphized expressions of the three sacred science principles with the large body of Greek and Christian writings, they
become Logos, Eros, and Dios—none other than the three principles of Mayan and Egyptian sacred science. It is startling to discover that such widely disparate traditions speak at their cores the same universal language of sacred science. 5. Impermanence. In the laments of Nahuatl poetry and song, it is recognized that everything on Earth is impermanent; everything must pass away. Nahuatl literature celebrates the beauty of flowers, the wondrous processes of nature, and yet does not ignore the insight that everything will eventually die or change into something else. This is the doctrine of impermanence that we also find in the Taoist Book of Changes, the I Ching. The world is a field of birth and death, of constant elemental transmutation, and the Nahuatl tlamatinime (poet-philosophers) were hungry for finding some eternal ground. The famous poet from Texcoco named Nezahualcoyotl (Hungry Coyote) lamented over having been born into the world of death and illusion’ and wondered if a higher reality could be found. His hunger was satisfied with the nectar of cosmic vision born of poetry.
This Nahuatl worldview is not, however, nihilistic or world-denying,

6. Sublimation yoga (becoming a Quetzalcoatl). Pages 10 and 11 of the codex describe this method by which the Mesoamerican initiate
can become a fully actualized human being, a Quetzalcoatl, one whose spiritual wings are fully opened. Sublimation yoga requires “turning inwards the serpent energy” that resides within the semen. And by the inner digestion of this “venom” the wings of the spirit grow. Without a doubt these pages describe the same method given in the
Taoist Tai I Chin Hua Tsung Chih (The Secret of the Golden Flower)
and the Hui Ming Ching (The Book of Consciousness and Life). These sacred Taoist texts teach that an immortal spirit body can be generated by
conserving the outward flow of seed energy (in the sperm) and sublimating it inward and upward through breathing and meditation. In this way a circulation of spirit energy creates a subtle “diamond body” that allows the spirit to fly to higher heavens at bodily death. According to tradition, this teaching originated in the eighth century C.E. when Lii Yeng (who
folklore counts as one of the eight immortals) founded the Religion of the Golden Elixir of Life. The ancient oral teachings of this school were not recorded until many centuries later and became well known in Peking (Beijing). Lii Yeng attributes the esoteric teaching of The Secret of
the Golden Flower to Kuan Yin-hsi, the same legendary master of Han-ku Pass for whom Lao-Tzu wrote down the Tao Te Ching. Sublimation has taken on a slightly pejorative connotation through



GNOSTIC AND PERENNIAL PARALLELS TO THE PYRAMID OF FIRE
ies
Freudian sexual theories, in which nervous disorders are blamed on the backing up of unreleased sexual tension. Such a view is typical of early Western psychology, which had difficulty appreciating and integrating teachings like those in The Secret of the Golden Flower. Even Carl Jung, who wrote a commentary on Wilhelm’s translation of The Secret of the Golden Flower, noted that many scholars mentally unravel upon encoun
tering Eastern teachings, and warned that Westerners should not embrace The Secret ofthe Golden Flower as a viable practice. This is perhaps overly cautious and might apply more to the era when Eastern teachings first
broke into Western consciousness. (Jung was writing in the 1920s.) Then again, Jung’s warning might be even more appropriate today because Western civilization is so obsessed with instant sexual gratification and sexual imagery is everywhere; it would be difficult to sustain the sublimation techniques taught in the sacred Taoist books. The West is more likely to pervert such teachings as a way to heighten or prolong sexual pleasure, as it has done with Tantric practices, which never intended the sacred couple to sexually consummate their /ieros gamos (sacred marriage). Sublimation as a way of unfolding the spirit is perhaps better known in the Hindu and Tibetan system of Kundalini yoga, which envisions the spine as a channel for the upward flow of evolutionary energy (kundalini
shakti). This main conduit is flanked by two other channels (or nadis) on the left and right, and the sublimated energy must circulate freely, as is
suggested in The Secret ofthe Golden Flower. Interestingly, the Kundalini energy is called the “serpent power” and is presided over by a female deity, much like the teaching in the Pyramid of Fire:
. .. he who searches learns to turn the serpent inward and the serpent wounds the enemy that it carries within itself.
It shoots within and without and creates the two-headed serpent. The hero learns a great secret by knowledge,
effort, sacrifice, and love.
He sheathes his serpent incisors
and makes her swallow her own venom. (10:21—27)

In Nahuatl sublimation yoga, the state of a fully actualized human being is imaged as a snake who has spread its latent wings. The Plumed Serpent, Quetzalcoatl, is a symbol uniting Heaven and Earth, bird and serpent, and can be considered equivalent to the union of Shiva and Shakti (avian and ophidian symbols) in Kundalini yoga.
7. Sacrifice or self-naughting. On page 11 of the codex, we find the
line “Itztli, Obsidian Knife, liberate my heart” (11:19). As mentioned in the previous chapter, a literal reading of this line reveals a contradiction
with the metaphorical meaning of sacrifice that we have identified (sac
rifice your selfish attachments, give your “heart” to a higher purpose, and
so on) because an obsidian knife could be used only for a real sacrifice. How can we understand this apparent contradiction? The distinction is that one form of sacrifice, the form that is rightfully criticized, is inspired by a fear-based projection—rounding up unwilling enemies to kill and offering their hearts to the sun. The form of sacrifice that is noble and indispensable for personal ascent into the



GNOSTIC AND PERENNIAL PARALLELS TO THE PYRAMID OF FIRE
136
light and to feed the gods is a willing, conscious choice. And here is the hardest part for the modern mind not to reject instinctively: Both the noble and the fear-based forms of sacrifice can involve the actual sacrifice. In other words, in principle a successful sacrifice depends on the inner state, and the outer events are secondary. Whether the heart is literally or metaphorically offered is ultimately irrelevant; union with the divine is contingent only upon the inner state of the seeker. This goes completely against the grain of our moral teachings. But let’s look more closely at this practice and our own culture’s assumptions regarding it. Our civilization condemns the consciously planned and expected
sacrifice of lives—unless, of course, it is in service to a “higher cause” that
our leaders deem worthy, such as a war. This “noble cause” is actually the same rationale that a willing Aztec initiate might employ. The intention
behind our civilization’s motivations, however, is often dubious, with pri
vate interest lurking behind the call to sacrifice. The Aztec cause, in its purest intention, is for the embracing of spiritual truth and a higher
existence—that is, to feed the deity (the Sun, the source of life). As such,
the intention is to feed the source of life rather than the deities of death,
as when a call to war is made (no matter what kind of acceptable loss
ratios are expected). In other words, our civilization accepts the sacrifice of life grudgingly with resistance, as a necessary evil in order to protect
the agendas of capitalist materialism, whereas the Aztec sacrifice occurs
with the conscious recognition of the interrelation of life and death.
Which stance reveals the more conscious and advanced civilization? In
the Aztec scenario, life and death are accepted as two poles of a higher
unity. Modern Western civilization denies and resists death as an unwanted intruder and thereby ineluctably entangles itself more deeply
in being in service to the deities of death (the shadow rather than the
light gets the sacrificial offering). Such is the more extreme degeneration
of any civilization on the decline, and it appears that the Aztecs themselves eventually debased their original teachings. Our culture could learn from this mistake. The Mesoamerican ball game reveals a perplexing sacrifice tradition.
In one version of the game, the winner was sacrificed. And the winner

Huxley refers to such a willful and willing self-sacrifice as self abnegation. Ananda Coomaraswamy calls it “self-naughting” and offers a great deal of insight by anchoring the discussion to this idea’s clear expression in Hindu and Vedic thought while constantly comparing it to theological statements and practices in Christianity and other major religions. In his article “Self-Naughting,” Coomaraswamy references the Satapatha Brahmana (III.8.1.2—3) to understand the inner meaning of
self-sacrifice. In order to take possession of his “whole self” (sarvatmanan) the initiated one who sacrifices “is emptied out of himself... Man thus
has two selves, lives or souls.”® According to Coomaraswamy, the person who sacrifices and the sacrificial offering are one and the same, and fire rituals were the preferred rites used by the ancient Vedic and Hindu sages. The self-sacrifice (naughting or abnegation) must be a self-willed act. It must be something a person chooses to do, and herein lies a paradox, for choosing to relinquish control is a willful act, and thus associated with the ego’s desire. The true basis of the self-sacrificial act is to assert our
willingness to let go, be absorbed (or subsumed or translated) into the
higher self, which is the Self of All. A great truth of Eastern religions is



GNOSTIC AND PERENNIAL PARALLELS TO THE PYRAMID OF FIRE
ia ie
that the individual soul (Atman) is equivalent to the universal soul
(Brahman). The self-sacrifice is a willing plunge into the fire to disentangle karmic knots and is sustained by action through nonaction. This is another paradoxical teaching also found in The Secret of the Golden
Flower: we dissolve the bonds of attachment to the results of our actions by not being the results that require the causes to continue existing. In
other words, if the karmic results disappear (in the fire of self-sacrifice)
there is no need for the karmic causes ever to have existed. Voila! This is a bird’s-eye view of the karmic Wheel of Becoming in which the fruit contains the seed of the future tree; the end result creates (or justifies) the
causative agent. Alpha and Omega are one; the end is the beginning, and when we realize the end, we enter the timeless. And the end is complete
re-absorption into the unmanifest divine ground.
Thus, seek the death and self-naughting that initiation into the
perennial vision offers! Burn the dross of illusion in the fires of sacrifice, release your mortal attachments and spread the wings of the soul to fly upward and unite with the unmanifest root of the sacred tree of being! 8. Gnostic Eschatology. Page 13 of the Pyramid of Fire describes a universal conflagration, the final dissolution of the world by fire, which
is quite similar to Gnostic eschatology. We can see that fire is a metaphor
for the light of Tonatiuh, the divine ground that reclaims all manifestations, including individualized souls, which are like sparks of the primal Unity. And the process occurs in ever-repeating World Age cycles. Such
a scenario is mentioned in Plato’s 7zmaeus. In the same section of this book that relates the famous Atlantis myth, we read of an old Egyptian priest trying to convey a sense of the ancient teachings to Solon, who, as
a visiting Greek, belongs to a culture that thinks “like children” and is not aware of the true age of the world. The priest recounts the Egyptian doctrine that the world has been destroyed by flood or fire many times in the
past. The discussion moves to consider the Babylonian World Age tradi

Apart from literalist interpretations that expect the world to be burned to a cinder, the metaphysical idea implicit in ekpyrosis is that the eternal light of the divine ground occasionally flashes forth to incinerate illusion and free souls from the grip of physical matter. There is still room for a Gnostic dualism in this view, that of spirit and matter being irrec
oncilable opposites, but following the Pyramid of Fire, we have to remember that the transcendent divine ground pervades material existence and illuminates it from within (transcendence is inclusive). Thus, the incineration of every particle of matter is likened to a sublimation or transformation of gross material into its finest essence, thereby returning it to its original state of undifferentiated “light” within the unmanifest
* Rather than grouping all the planets in one sign, this scenario probably encodes (though fragmentarily) an astronomical alignment of one of the seasonal quarters—probably the spring equinox—with the cusp of Capricorn or Cancer. The spring equinox has long been used in the Old World as the tracking point for precession. Such a distinction is required because a mere grouping of planets does not involve precession, and yet precession is the cause of the Great Year. Popular stories derived from precessional mythology can be expected to result in distortions such as this. We see it, for example, in the popular 1960s song “The Age of Aquarius,” in which a rare but random planetary alignment in a certain sign is thought to signal the dawn of a new precessional age. Such imagery works well for a song or a popular myth, but in actuality, an alignment caused by precession underlies all of these World Age shifts.
+ Some scholars do not equate Plato’s 36,000-year Great Year with precession (which involves 26,000 years), but an awareness of the shifting skies most certainly would have been rumored during the time that Plato lived through Babylonian astronomical knowledge. The indispensable book on this topic is Godefroid de Callatay, Annus Platonicus: A Study ofWorld Cycles in Greek, Latin and Arabic Sources (Louvain-Paris: Institut Orientaliste and Peeters Press, 1996).

godhead. In this view the apparent opposition of matter and spirit is not a mutually exclusive opposition (as a pure Gnostic dualism would have it). Rather, this “opposition” is really the two poles of a continuum that defines a higher unity, in the same way that finitude rests within the bosom ofinfinity as one ofinfinity’s potential states.
In Gnostic, Hebrew Scripture, and early Christian literature, the return of a soul to the divine source via a universal ekpyrosis is likened to a visionary ascent. This upward (and inward) journey attends the sublimation process noted earlier in The Secret of the Golden Flower and in Indian Kundalini yoga. The Ascension of Isaiah is an apocryphal firstcentury document that describes Isaiah’s ascent to the throne of God. It is of a genre known as apocalypse literature, to which the testimonials of
Ezekial, Daniel, and St. John (Revelation) also belong, because the macrocosmic end of the world is seen to be conceptually identical to the micro
cosmic (or personal) visionary ascent. Here again, the microcosm reflects the macrocosm. The Poimandres is a Hermetic document that influenced Gnostic thought and yet was much like the earlier apocalypses of Daniel and Ezekial. Here we encounter that tumultuous milieu of the first and second centuries in which ideas were shared by both the Gnostic and early Christian movements—very profound metaphysical concepts that were eventually abandoned or edited out of official Church dogma. In the Poimandres we find a striking description, similar to the passage on page 13 of the Pyramid of Fire (13:10-19), of how the visionary’s mortal coils are stripped away. According to the Poimandres, as the ascending visionary “thrusts upward through the Harmony” (the celestial spheres), he surrenders the power to grow and decay; his evil cunning is rendered
powerless; deceit, concupiscence and arrogance are dissolved; impulsive acquisitiveness, appetite for wealth, and lying are all stripped away.'° This is the soul’s purification so that in its original state it can meet the unmanifest divine ground. Such a purification is often described as a burning away of the dross of individualized identity. These descriptions in ascension literature are symbolic of an inward movement—a turning within for an inward (and upward) ascension. The
profound association to be made here is that the personal visionary ascent

Sacrifice, Sublimation, Ascension, and Apocalypse
Sublimation yoga and sacrifice are closely linked. In fact, sacrifice of outward attachments (and the consequent allegiance to a false ego identity that is reinforced by those attachments) is the prerequisite for sublima
tion, which involves the pointing inward of the seed energy of sexual reproduction. Jnward thereafter transforms into upward as the seed
energy is consumed within (burns) and rises higher through the inner spiritual physiology (the chakras).
The seed energy contains the latent power of creation—which the Pyramid of Fire identifies as being solar in origin—but when it is con
served and offered (burned) or sacrificed to a higher purpose, it trans
forms into light and illuminates a higher wisdom.* The sublimating, sacrificing seeker thereby becomes a Quetzalcoatl—an awakened seer who
has activated the “two-headed serpent.” He can act outwardly with the wisdom of an awakened transcendent viewpoint.
The sublimation of creative energy that is possible through sacrifice
is equivalent to what in Hindu parlance is called a Kundalini awakening. As we have already sketched, in Hebrew Scripture and Gnostic visionary literature such an awakening experience is characterized as an ascension. Often in this apocalypse literature—in the Gnostic Poimandres, for example—the ascension is attended by the stripping away of the seeker’s false self-identifications and attachments. This Gnostic doctrine of the anagogical (upward-leading) journey has a precedent in the Sumerian “descent” of Inanna, who must disrobe at each successive level until she
stands naked before the Annunaki judges in the deepest level of the Underworld. (In this instance Inanna’s “descent” is equivalent to the
* It should be mentioned that there is a yoga of self-actualization intended for women. However, it is by nature a very different path, for men seek to transcend phenomena, whereas women by nature seek to wear phenomena as ornaments—that is to say, to embody the energies of the universe. One form of yoga for women teaches how to embody (channel or “download”) the goddess energies of evolutionary transmutation through sacred dance. See Rose, 2001 and 2003.

Gnostic “ascent.” In the Poimandres the soul’s ascent is the reversal of the process by which the soul descends or falls into material incarnation.) And of course, the Pyramid of Fire likewise requires the discarding of mortal attachments (the “clothes” of individualized identity) as shown in
the following excerpt (13:11-19):
Now Cihuacéatl, Ehécatl, Chalciuhtlicue, and Xiuhtecuhtli
incendiate the four elements.
The seven planetary gods throw my constituent parts into
the fire: Tlaltecuhtli, my bones
Metztli, my viscera Paynal, my members
Itzpapdlotl, my sweet flesh Huitzilopochtli adds my passion Tezcatlipoca, my sorrow
Mixcéatl, my fragile mind.
Both sacrifice and sublimation lead to the visionary ascent, which, as we have seen, is memorialized in the apocalypse literature of various religious traditions that were in vogue in the Near East just after the Crucifixion. But why is such ascent literature characterized as “apocalyptic’? The reason is that the visionary ascends to a realm that transcends the temporal flow. This ascent provides a direct ecstatic immersion in the eternal wisdom (the Sophia perennis) at the root and source of all phenomenal manifestation. This source is the “nowhere” place that endures throughout all the vicissitudes of World Ages coming and going. It is that which
remains after the Apocalypse (the “unveiling”) strips away all separating distinctions and dissolves all manifestations into the divine ground from which they came. It is a glimpse of the end of time and the end of the world. This end place is also the place of origin. These ideas are recognized by Dead Sea Scroll scholars as a paradigm called realized eschatology. At the hermitage of Qumran—the society that followed a secret teaching of Jesus and whose documents, the Nag Hammadi library, were unearthed in the 1940s—the quest for afterlife salvation was irrelevant. They were more

concerned with creating a society of people based upon practicing immersion in the transcendent divine ground. The direct experience of the godhead was seen to be a nectar useful for creating an authentic spiritually based paradigm on Earth. They had realized their eschatology—they knew how to access the transcendent divine ground and could do so on a regular basis. In other words, they had made manifest the New Jerusalem or Heavenly Kingdom that the New Testament (fixated upon linear time concepts) puts off until after the Apocalypse and Last Judgment.* What they sought to manifest on Earth was the eschaton, the end state." Thus, the personal visionary ascent is a death-to-ego initiation into
gnostic (direct) experience of the transcendent divine ground, leading to
the second birth that begins a new spiritualized existence (even while still on Earth). This is actually what it means to be truly human or, said another way, such a state is the fully actualized potential of all human beings—the immediate awareness of true nature unconditioned by artificial distinctions and the attachment to becoming. That true nature is eternal and infinite. The ecstatic exaltation of immersion in such a state is what Seyyed Hossein Nasr described in his book Knowledge and the Sacred, implying that all true knowledge comes from an ecstatic connection with (experience of) the transcendent.'* Such an experience is time
less, and even if not sustained, it imprints the seeker with a conviction that his true nature is eternal and infinite. He has been to the end of the world; he has seen the apocalypse; he has been burned (initiated, purified) in the fires of a universal ekpyrosis that all manifested beings will eventually undergo. According to the Pyramid of Fire, we can go willingly to our destiny or resist it until what appear to be the demonic minions of death’s destiny strip away the ego-illusion. We may witness the difficult struggle of resisting dissolution as a loved one dies, the irony (and possibility) of choice while being catapulted through a process beyond human control. Without presuming to peer beyond the veil of death, it is possible to
* Such historical locating of the end of time is an absurdity from the higher viewpoint of realized eschatology (see Henry Corbin’s 7emple and Contemplation). Realized eschatology is criticized as a dangerous heresy in mainstream theological discourse today.



GNOSTIC AND PERENNIAL PARALLELS TO THE PYRAMID OF FIRE
144
observe that in the death process, we can let go and thereby smooth the
experience of dissolution, or we can hold on, resist the inevitable, and
thereby oblige death to take all by force. Such a “pay the piper” imperative may seem harsh, but it does speak
a truth—that of free will within the limits of karma. Much has been written about the death process, and many believe that 2012 (the end of the Mayan calendar) is about the end of the world. Visionary philosopher Terence McKenna often emphasized in public addresses that the psychedelic state of consciousness was something to be experienced; it isn’t a
doctrine or set of beliefs in some culturally relative system. It is, first and foremost—and above all—an experience. The overly flogged “end of the world” in 2012 should be viewed in a similar vein. Let’s all experience the end of the world before we pass judgment on it. It would be difficult to talk about the end of time and the end of the world unless it was with
someone who had been there. The end of the world is cognate with (or equivalent to) the visionary
ascent and the death/rebirth initiation. This inner experience casts us out of the flow of mundane time to glimpse the realm beyond time, beyond the end of time, which is not to be identified with any point on the historical continuum but is found when the consciousness shifts to a verti
cal movement or ascent above the horizontal plane of historical flow.
Thus, what 2012 is about (as the end-of-time archetype) is an experience of no time, an experience of the perspective achieved when time is tran
scended (ended). The root of time is the timeless. That experience, as we find it reflected in the Gnostic Poimandres, can certainly be documented
and added to the corpus of testimonials, but even though the human reflex is to make a model, no resulting dogmas should define the experience for others. Apocalypse literature intriguingly points the way to an experience that can be achieved at any point within the historical continuum, and according to the Nahuatl philosophers (and possibly the eschaton seers of Qumran themselves) is best achieved with sacred plants, flower and
song combined with self-sacrifice and commitment to nonattachment.
In fact, self-sacrifice and nonattachment are the teachings that Huxley observes in all perennial philosophies as the means to achieve the

ultimate purpose of human life: the soul’s reunion with the higher divine self.'° And so the actual temporal location of the end-time is a moot question, for the emphasis in the Pyramid of Fire is on personal transcendence and ascent to “the end of time.” A ritual or symbolic death—an ecstatic visionary experience of the after-death state, the state that is above or beyond (transcendent to) the linear flow of time—has always been a central feature of initiation rituals. What this means is obvious but not often thought about clearly: Many initiates and spiritual seekers have already been to the end oftime, and to try to locate “the end of time” somewhere within the temporal flow simply misses the point. Identifying the endtime date is certainly useful for anchoring a World Age doctrine or as something upon which to hang prophetic utterances, but the transcendental metaphysics of ascension do not require that anyone must wait
until a future time to experience the timeless.



APPENDIX 1
Quetzalcoatl’s
Ascension
The vision of Venus rising as morning star, powerful and accessible to people even today, is at the core of an important Aztec teaching. It is the metaphor of the spirit breaking free from the bonds of ego. The cycles of the stars and planets mirror perfectly the cycles of human culture. Themes and patterns repeat themselves on various levels of reality; for
example, the sun sets in the western sky and, likewise, as cultures evolve, the spirit descends into matter to animate, be molded by, and become lost in it. And the dark night of the soul ensues. But the occluded souls know the “sun” is down there somewhere, untouched by the dark fact
that they can no longer see their origin. And when the time comes, the source emerges to enlighten the body of the earth, and green growing things rejoice. Venus plays an important part in the story of Quetzalcoatl, the Plumed Serpent. Here again, the Aztecs have seen in the complexities of astronomical cycles the journey of the soul toward enlightenment. In this sense “myth” is not a time-worn legend to be considered the fantasy of a dead people. The meaning behind the legend of Quetzalcoatl’s death and rebirth is a meaning shared by cultures all around the world. The Tibetan Book of the Dead tells of the soul’s journey through the Underworld after death. The soul experiences various benevolent and frightful deities that we are encouraged to remember as mere projections of the mind. The goal is to reach the highest Bardo, or plane of con

sciousness, where we are liberated from the illusory creations of the mind,
where we experience pure awareness. If we are unable to transcend mind
created desires, we swoon into unconsciousness to be reborn on Earth.
During the soul’s new incarnation on Earth, it is hoped that we will achieve a deeper understanding of the nature of reality. Prank Waters, in his book Mexico Mystique, commented on the story of Quetzalcoatl and found it is reflected in the movement of Venus through the sky. It symbolizes the redemption of the spirit after a down
fall and suggests that a fall, or the loss of consciousness into matter, is part of the great cycles of time. Inevitably we arrive at an era of regeneration and rebirth of the spirit—the end of an age—which for the Maya is December 21, 2012 C.E. Here is a brief recounting of the myth of Quetzalcoatl, paraphrased from the Anales de Cuauhtitlan.
As the ruler of the City of the Gods established after the creation of the Fifth Sun, Quetzalcoatl was good, wise, and chaste. Then his old heavenly rival and dual antithesis, Tezcatlipoca, contrived his downfall. Tezcatlipoca brought him a mirror and said to him, “Ce
Acatl Quetzalcoatl, I greet thee and come to give thee thy body.” Quetzalcoatl, conscious of his divine origin, was perplexed. “My body? What is this concerning my body? Let me see.” And seeing his earthly body for the first time reflected in the
mirror, he was very frightened. Tezcatlipoca then tempted him with a drink of pulque.
Quelzatcoatl refused.
“Just taste it,” insisted Tezcatlipoca. Quetzalcoatl tasted it with his little finger and found it to be good. So he took a drink. He took four drinks and a fifth, after which he called for his sister, Xochiquetzal, goddess of love and beauty. She too drank the pulque and in the end they slept
together. Upon awakening, Quetzalcoatl realized he had been induced
to become drunk, forget his chastity, and commit incest. “Woe is me!” he wailed, singing a sad song of departure. “Acolytes, this is it. I shall go away. Have a stone box made for me.”



APPENDIX 1: QUETZALCOATL’S ASCENSION
148
A stone coffin was made at once. In it Quetzalcoatl immured
himself for four days. He then disposed of all his material riches,
and went to /a orilla celeste del agua divina, the shore of the divine
sea. During his pilgrimage, necromancers kept asking him, “Why have you left your people? Where are you going?”
“T go to Tlillan Tlapallan. The sun is calling me.” Arriving at the seacoast, he put on his feathers and mask and
built a great fire. Then he cast himself into the flames. When he
burned, all the rare birds gathered to watch his ashes rise. And
then eight days later his heart rose like a flaming star. After his mortal manifestation died in the funeral pyre, Quetzalcoatl went underground to Mictlan, the Land of the
Dead. He was accompanied by his twin or double, Xolotl, who
took the shape of a dog. From Mictlantecuhtli, the Lord of the
Dead, he took the bones of a man and a woman and escaped after many trials. He then sprinkled the bones with his own
blood, thus redeeming them so that they could inhabit the earth.
Four days more he spent making arrows and on the eighth day
he made his ascent, being transformed into the Lord of the
Dawn, the morning star. Thereafter, as the planet Venus he astronomically repeats his ritual journey, first appearing in the west
ern sky as the evening star, disappearing underground, and then reappearing in the eastern sky as the morning star to unite with
the rising sun.'
What is the transcendental meaning of this myth? It expresses the universal theme of sin and redemption, of death and resurrection, the transfiguration of human into God. But if Quetzalcoatl, one of the four sons of the supreme creator, Ometeotl, was already divine, how could he have succumbed to mortal sin? Simply because the myth enunciates the principle of all creation: the incarnation of divine light, purity, and spirituality into gross matter, followed by the agonizing redemption of matter by spirituality. This is the immortal theme of all religions: the movement of the unconscious into consciousness. The self-illumination of con
sciousness by consciousness, the source of all true transformation.

Each synodical revolution of Venus was observed to consist of four phases. The first phase is the eight-day period when Venus crosses in front of the sun. This is called inferior conjunction. The first annual
predawn appearance of Venus (west of the rising sun) is called its heliacal rising. During this early-morning viewing period Venus is fantastically brilliant because of its proximity to Earth. As the days of this second phase advance, Venus progresses farther away from Earth, becoming visible as a morning star for a longer period each day. At its greatest “west
ern elongation” from the Sun, Venus rises three hours ahead of it, then as the weeks progress, it closes in on the Sun and disappears behind the glare of the Sun for about eight weeks. This is superior conjunction, phase
three. As this period of invisibility ends, Venus appears briefly in the western sky right after sunset, and as the days of phase four progress, is eventually visible for as much as three hours after sunset. This is the point of maximum eastern elongation, after which Venus closes in on the Sun very quickly to repeat the cycle in inferior conjunction. The eight days of inferior conjunction represent the time that Quetzalcoatl spends in the Underworld, the Land of the Dead, after which he is redeemed and rises triumphant as the morning star.

MESOAMERICAN STUDIES/METAPHYSICS
_ “Ancient Mexico lives again in this amazing retrieval of an Aztec pictorial and oral tradition. Marty and John lead the reader to places undiscovered by archaeologists and cthnologists.” _ BRUCE SCOFIELD, author of Day-Signs: Native American Astrology From Ancient Mexico
“The Pyramid of Fire ispart of the highest esoteric tradition of mankind. . . . a luciadnd insightful commentary born of a sound grasp of the Perennial Philosophy.” ry EsTeFAN LAMBERT, author of The Solar Body and The Cleaving ofthe Moon
“Marty Matz isthelost Beat genius and Pyramid ofFire iseverything from hisspiritual auto- _
bi to a classic world text of enlightenment.”
oe GERALD NICOSIA, poet and author of Memory Babe: A Critical Biography of Jack Kerouac
In 1961 an unknown Aztec codex was revealed to Beat poet and explorer Marty Matz bya © Mazatec shaman in the mountains of Oaxaca, Mexico. Originally intended for dramatic performance, this codex presents a profound metaphysical teaching describing how the end of time will bring about a visionary ascent and mystic initiation. At the behest of his Mazatec teacher, Matz transcribed this pictorial codex into a literary form that would preserve its initiatory teachings and reveal its secret meanings to a wider audience. The Pyramid of Fire codex (Codex Matz-Ayauhtla) is an epic poem that provides a vehicle to transport the initiate into the higher realms of consciousness. It represents a barely surviving thread of teachings that have been passed down in secret since the time of the Spanish Conquest. Revealed are the techniques by which human beings are transported to the stellar realm after death via the solar energy within what the ancients called the “serpent of consciousness.” Line-by-line commentary by John Major Jenkins provides insights into the perennial philosophy and Matz, in his introduction and through the inclusion of his poetry and fiction and an interview he conducted with Jenkins, offers his understanding of its relevance to our time.
JOHN MAJOR JENKINS has taught at Esalen and Naropa and appeared on the Discovery Channel’s Places of Mystery and National Public Radio’s Spirit and Mind.
