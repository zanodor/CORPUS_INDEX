Antler signs on Indus seals
M-1296 a
This sign appears on many Indus seals and in my opinion it is an antler.
M-673a
The seal depicts this antler which looks similar to the one of a Swamp Deer.
K-19 a Taxila (Bhir Mound)
And the antler on the square seal looks like to the one of a stag depicted on the round seal.
So, it is not unreasonable to think that the Indus sign is an antler, which of course indicates a stag or a deer.



H95-2485 Trois Freres France
On this tablet a deity carries an antler on his head and in this way he looks like the Paleolithic figure carved into a ceiling chamber, called Trois Freres, in southern France.
In de Rigveda storm gods like Indra and the Maruts are compared to stags:
Rigveda 1-16 called: ‘Indra’
5 ‘Come thou to this our song of praise, to the libation poured for thee Drink of it like a stag athirst’.
Rigveda 10-77 called: ‘Maruts’
2 ‘The youths have wrought their ornaments for glory through many nights, -this noble band of Maruts. Like stags the Sons of Dyatis have striven onward, the Sons of Aditi grown strong like pillars’.
Number 1
And this 7th-9th century sculpture shows the wind god Vayu with a deer and in pictures he is represented like a white man riding on a deer carrying a white flag in his hand.
(Hindu Gods and Goddesses; W. J. Wilkins)
So it appears that stags and deer are related to storm or wind deities and on Indus seals they indicate the storm goddess Devasena. Besides that, they also indicate Kartikeya, because one of his names is Naigamesha, a goatheaded or deer-headed deity.

On the right is a figure with a bow and arrow standing next to an antler. This archer is Devasena and like Indra she is a warrior who defeats the drought. She stands close to this antler which shows her relationship with this sign.
M-328 a
On this seal a deity carries two water skins and waers a U-sign with four dashes instead of a head. As said before, these four dashes symbolize the four powers of the sun god Kartikeya: in the Tolkāppiyam he is identical with four different gods:
1. Māyōṉ ‘the dark one’ (identified with Vishnu), 2. Vēntaṉ ‘the sovereign’ (identified with Indra) 3. And Korravai ‘the victorious’ (identified with Kali)
4. And Varunan ‘the sea god’.

The U symbolizes Shashthi, the goddess of the crescent. Thogether this U sign with the four dashes symbolize that Shashthi and Kartikeya are united.
When this sign is placed on the body of a deity it looks like antlers and this twofold deity becomes a stag-man.



M-1324
On this broken seal a U sign with four dashes is placed on a figure carrying two water-skins. This figure represents Kartikeya united with his wife Shashthi. Together they bring water, in other words: they let it rain.
The second sign is a womb with an antler inside.
o The antler indicates a storm deity, o The womb indicates that this storm deity is female.
Together the two signs indicate the storm goddess Devasena.
Chanhudaro12a
On the left of this seal is a deity wearing two water skins, next to him is an antler and the third sign is also regularly depicted on Indus seals.



M-681
This sign is a mixing- or cooking-vessel in which a pot ladle is standing upright. This vessel contains Soma juices:
Rigveda 9-107 called: ‘Soma Pavamana’
9 ‘Down to the water-Soma, rich in kine hath flowed with cows, with cows that have been milked. They have approached the mixing-vessel as a sea: the cheerer streams for the carouse’.
Rigveda 1-162 called: ‘The Horse’
6 ‘The hewers of the post and those who carry it, and those who carve the knob to deck the Horse's stake; Those who prepare the cooking-vessels for the Steed, -may the approving help of these promote our work’.
Rigveda 6-69 called: ‘Indra-Vishnu’
1. ‘Indra and Vishnu, at my task's completion I urge you on with food and sacred service. Accept the sacrifice and grant us riches, leading us on by unobstructed pathways. 2 Ye who inspire all hymns, Indra and Vishnu, ye vessels who contain the Soma juices, May hymns of praise that now are sung address you, the lauds that are recited by the singers’.
It indicates the crescent goddess Shashthi.
M-1897 M-925 a H-67 a
On the above seals this vessel is surrounded by four dashes symbolizing the four powers of the sun god Kartikeya. The seals show that with his four powers Kartikeya inseminates the vessel goddess Sashthi.
In the middle of two seals a single line symbolezes a soma-stalk: like a pillar it supports the sky:
Rigveda 9-74 called: ‘Soma Pavamana’. 2 ‘A far-extended pillar that supports the sky the Soma-stalk, filled full, moves itself every way. He shall bring both these great worlds while the rite proceeds: the Sage holds these who move!’



H-479 A
This seal depicts four signs:
1. The U sign with four dashes symbolize the union of Kartikeya with his wife Shashthi: together they engender a child. 2. The antler represents the storm goddess Devasena, another wife of Kartikeya. 3. The vessel with a pot ladle indicates Shashthi. 4. The fourth on is a womb cymbolizes childbirth: Shashthi gives birth to the engendered child.
M-672
This seal also depicts four signs:
1. The U sign with four dashes symbolize the union of Kartikeya with his wife Shashthi. 2. The antler represents the storm goddess Devasena, the second wife of Kartikeya. 3. The vessel with a pot ladle indicates Shashthi. 4. The fourth sign is a fish which represents the river goddess Valli, the third wife of Kartikeya.
So, the four signs on this seal indicate Kartikeya and his three wives.



M-605 A
o The U-sign, antler, vessel and fish indicate Kartikeya and his three wives. o On the right of this seal are three short vertical lines symbolizing grain. o On the whole this seal suggests that Kartikeya and his three wives bring forth grain.
M-392
o Again, the U-sign, antler, vessel and fish indicate Kartikeya and his three wives. o The four deities bring forth soma stalks symbolized by the two verticale lines. o On the right the womb with an antler inside symbolizes that Devasena gives birth to a child.
H-134
o Once more, the U-sign, antler, vessel and fish indicate Kartikeya and his three wives. o The four deities bring forth grain, indicated by the three dashes, o As well as soma, inducated by the two dashes on top. o The diamond on the right symbolizes that one of the three goddesses gives birth to a child.
H-753 A
o The knife on the left symbolizes Kritikka: Kartikeya is the deity of this nakshatra. o The U-sign symbolizes the union of Kartikeya and Shashthi in Rohini: the moon goddess is the deity of this nakshatra. o The antler, the vessel and the fish symbiolize Devasena, Shashthi and Valli: the three wives of Kartikeya. o The womb with an antler inside symbolizes that Devasena gives birth to a child.



M-1828 a
The figure on the left symbolizes the union of Kartikeya with his wife Shashthi. Together they bring water, in other words: they let it rain
The second figure is Shashthi holding a stalk: they milk this stalk to get soma:
Rigveda 3-36 called: ‘Indra’
6 ‘As floods according to their stream flow onward, so to the sea, as borne on cars, the waters. Vaster is Indra even than his dwelling, what time the stalk milked out, the Soma, fills him. 7 Eager to mingle with the sea, the rivers carry the well-pressed Soma juice to Indra. They drain the stalk out with their arms, quick-banded, and cleanse it with a stream of mead and filters’.
The following seals show how the antler sign has been incorporated into a completely new sign:
H-1049 A
On the left an antler indicates Kartikeya: one of his names is Naigamesha, a goat-headed or deer-headed deity.
On the right Devasena turns her water-skin over and drops rain.



M-702 M-1895 a
M-976 K-28 a
On these four seals, Kartikeya (on M-976) as well as Devasena (on all the other seals), both symbolized by the antlers, turns their water-skins over and drop rain
