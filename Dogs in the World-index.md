# Index for Dogs in the World.pdf

Clean and Unclean
In Persia
Origins
It used to be thought that the dog originated somewhere in the
fertile crescent, but Finnish genetic researcher Savolainen, in his
analysis of the mtDNA of a great variety of dogs from around the
globe, demonstrates that their domestication must have taken place
in East Asia. This transformation from wolf to dog is thought to have
occurred nearly 15,000 years ago. Without dogs, it seems unlikely
humans would have been able to spread throughout the world; nor
would we have developed civilization. (Dogs That Changed the
World, Nature, PBS, 2008.)
In ancient Persia, dogs were one of the preferred means of disposing
of corpses. This is the likely reason why they were, and still are in
some places, considered to be especially unclean. It is not solely
because they may have eaten carrion that they are avoided, but also
because it is often thought that evil spirits readily associate with
dead bodies.
Therefore, in the Zoroastrian rituals of old, the dead body is placed
on a stone slab out in the open. Then a dog is brought near in order
to inspect the face of the dead person, for it was believed that it had
an ability to see and chase away any evil spirits that may have
associated themselves to the corpse.
In Arabia
There is an anecdote told of Mohammed, the prophet of Islam: One
day, a panting dog feebly approached one of his followers, who took



notice of the poor animal. Seeing a puddle of muddy water, he tore a
scrap off the hem of his shirt, soaked it in the water and taking the
dog in his lap, he moistened its mouth.
Another person, witnessing this, went and told the Prophet that a
member of the group had handled a filthy animal, "and therefore he
should not be allowed back here again."
Mohammed asked, "What was he doing to the dog ?"
"I don't know, but I saw him moistening its mouth with a torn piece of
cloth dipped in muddy water."
"Then," replied the Prophet, "He is a better Muslim than you,
because he is kind to animals."
However, in most of the countries which have been influenced by
Arab culture, dogs are held to be unclean and are rarely permitted in
the home. An exception, according to Roger A. Carras, late
president of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals, are the coursers and gaze or, sight, hounds, most notably
the Saluki, which is used for hunting.
In India
The purest native form of Indian dog is an elegant animal called the
Santal Hound. However the ordinary street dog is known as a pye
dog, or pariah -- an animal outcaste.
Outside the emergent Indian middle class, where dogs are kept as
pets or as status symbols, the dog is generally considered unclean
and a pest. But there is also an ancient tradition of respect for
canines. For example,



"Since 1927 a dog [had been] following the retinue of the Matha.*
It was a strange dog -- an intelligent animal without the least
trace of unclean lines. It would eat only the food given to it from
the Matha. The Acharya would therefore enquire every evening if
the dog had been fed. When the camp moved from one place to
another, the dog would follow, walking underneath the palanquin,
and when the entourage stopped so that the devotees of the way
side villages could pay their homage, it would run to a distance
and watch devoutly from there, only to rejoin the retinue when it
was on the move again. One day, a small boy hit the dog; and the
dog was about to retaliate, when the officials of the Matha, in
fear, caused the dog to be taken to a distance of twenty-five
miles, blindfolded and left there in a village. But strange as it may
seem, the dog returned to where the Acharya was, even before
the person who had taken it away could return. From that day
onwards the dog would not eat without the Acharya's darshana**
and stayed till the end of its life with the Matha." [This happened
near Nagari.]
~ Kamakothi.org (*math is a Hindu saint, in this case the 68th
Shankara-acharya, Chandrasekharendra Sarasvati of Kanchi.
**being in sight of his presence.)
The ending of the Mahabharata centers on a dog. When the
Pandava brothers hear of the destruction of their cousins and of
Krishna, having experienced the cruel devastation of the war they
retire to the Himalayas to be contemplatives. They throw their
weapons into the river, and go along with their wife Draupadi to
begin the ascent to Swarga, Indra's heaven on Mount Meru, but a
dog begins to tag along.
As they near the summit, first the woman is left behind because of
her attachment to Arjuna, and then one after another (because of



each person's pride, hunger, love or other kind of attachment) four of
her husbands fall dead. The only survivors now are Yudhishthira and
the dog.
Now Shakra [Indra's private name] appeared in his gleaming chariot.
"Embark in my chariot and come with me to Swarga." But when
Yudhishtira went to take his seat in the vehicle, the dog hopped in.
When they reach the heavenly gates of Swarga, Shakra invites the
pious, truthful Yudhishtira in, but the man says he does not want to
be there alone. Shakra assures him that he will see his brothers and
Draupadi, already there.
Yudhishtira then says, "Lord of Past and Present, this dog who is so
devoted to me should also enter."
Indra replies, "You have acquired immortality and all the joys of
heaven today; leave the dog behind."
The man says, "Lord of a Thousand Eyes, what is the use of bliss if to
attain it I have to reject one who is so devoted to me?"
"There is no place for people with dogs in heaven. The apsaras will
deprive you of their blessings; think of that. Now will you give up the
dog?"
"Even for such bliss, I could never leave one who is terrified, devoted
to me, needs my help, is weak or begs for his life. I could never
abandon such a one."
Shakra informed him, "Whatever blessings or benefits a dog can
observe, the heavenly daughters will take way. So renounce the dog,
and attain the joys of heaven. You went on without your own
brothers, why won't you give up the dog?"



But Yudhishtira said, "As long as they were still alive, I did not
renounce them. To abandon the dog would be like injuring a friend,
or like frightening someone under my protection."
Then Indra relented, and praised the man for the mercy he
demonstrated towards the animal. He admitted them together to
Swarga as an example to others.
Just then, Dharma "with his golden hair" emerged from the dog's
form and blessed the man.
Some say that this Dharma is the one who is the man's father, and
that he had come to test Yudishtira's loyalty and was pleased with
his son's conduct. Others say that it is the Dharma-rajah who is
Yama, Lord of Death but still others, that Dharma stands for the
dharma that is the law of the universe itself.

Shiva's Dogs
The dog is as much considered the vahana
or animal vehicle of the Indian god Shiva as
is the bull, Nandi. In fact, when Shiva is
depicted with four dogs, they are said to
represent the 4 Vedas -- the most ancient
of scriptures. Shiva in his wrathful form as
Bhairava is especially portrayed with dogs.
Here the association is with Lord Shiva as
yogi who meditates at battlegrounds and
cemeteries, and so is connected with
canines as scavengers.
An Indian deity called Dattatreya combines the three male gods



Shiva, Vishnu and Brahma, and at his feet are the four dogs that are
the Vedas. They accompany him as the hounds of heaven that track
pure souls, and as the watchdogs of Dharma in the sense of ultimate
harmony and truth.
Loyal Companion
The dog has long been a symbol of loyalty. The Abhinaka Jataka,
one of the tales about Buddha's previous lives, recounts how even to
an elephant, the dog is precious. When an elephant misses his dog
playmate, he refuses to eat until the dog is restored to him.
Homer [Greek epic poet] wrote that when wily Odysseos returned
home from Troy after years on the road, at first he was recognized
only by his old dog, Argos.
Dogs as symbolic of sincerity and trustworthiness were also held
sacred to the Roman god, Mithras,
The name of the Irish hero, Cuchulainn [pron. ku-kuh-lin] refers to
his devotion to his country. (Cu means dog. ) He was a mighty
person even at age seven when he killed the watchdog of Chulainn
the Smith and in return, undertook to take its place as protector of
the kingdom of Ulster.
The loyalty of dogs is often thought to work both ways:
A farmer intended to shoot a faithful dog, now too old to be of
use. But the dog's friend the wolf had a plan. Accordingly, he
seized the master's child; the dog pursued and with a pretended
struggle rescued the child. The grateful farmer now promised to
keep the old dog as long as he lived.
~ Old Sultan retold by D.L. Ashliman (Grimm's # 48).



Miserable Dog
Sometimes we forget that until a hundred or so years ago, dogs were
not normally kept in the home. At least since the 1500s people have
been saying, It's a dogʼs life when they mean that life is full of
suffering.
Also, dogs left to breed unchecked in cities rapidly become pests, a
source of vermin and disease. They are associated with conflict,
noise, dirt and misery. When Turkey moved to modernize, the
thousands of dogs of Constantinople were rounded up, deposited on
an island in the Sea of Marmora and left to die in a piteous and
prolonged fashion. Similarly, in Nepal, the dogs of Kathmandu have
been regularly rounded up and destroyed when they were thought to
pose a threat either to health or to tourism.
As former host Bob Barker of The Price is Right TV game show used
to say, "Have your pet spayed or neutered." Drew Carey now adds,
"It's very important."
Reborn as a Dog
To live as a dog is considered a terrible fate. In the Shantiparva of
The Mahabharata (Book 3n28) that one who embraces another's
wife, "becomes a dog for 100 lives and then a serpent. . . . . One
who enjoys with a friend's wife or maternal aunt, becomes a dog."
The same fate will befall a person who waters milk, and so on.
Dogs and Death
In many mythologies, dogs or dog-like beings
guard the underworld from unwelcome guests
such as the still-living, and they also keep the
dead where they belong. Examples are



Cerberus, multi-headed guardian of the Greeks, his two-headed
brother, Orthrus, and the Norse dog Garm, at Hel's door. There are
many others.
Interestingly, in the 2007 Halloween special of the television show,
Phenomenon, Israeli mentalist Guy Bavli, who has the ability of
stopping his heart, took more than 10 seconds to restart it. When he
finally did, by what seemed like a kind of self-generated electric
shock, he remarked, "I could hear dogs -- lots of dogs."
In Welsh mythology, white hounds with red ears are denizens of
Annwn, the Otherworld that is ruled by Arawn, lord of death. In the
tale of the hostel of Da Derga, there are nine hounds, and also many
dog skeletons have been found buried in Celtic graves either having
been sacrificed to accompany their masters or as offerings.
In Tibetan Buddhism, one of the darker dakinis has a dog for her
vehicle. And in the mandala of Vajravarahi, in the west, the direction
of the Dead -- the place where the sun sets -- there is the red dog
headed dakini who is called Svanasya.
Jackal-headed messengers or deities like Anubis of the ancient
Egyptians represent the canine as a scavenger of corpses but also
as an agent of transformation. Although the jackal and the coyote
or fox are tricksters, and the elusive yet social wolf functions as a
representative of nature, only the dog fulfills the role of "Man's Best
Friend."
A Shoshone myth which explains how death came into the world
illuminates the difference between wise Wolf and wily Coyote
[called Ma'i by Navajo/southern Dene]. They are sometimes referred
to as older and younger brother, respectively.
In the first days, when animals were not as they are today, Wolf



was the Creator of order in this world, while Coyote always tried
to oppose him. Knowing that, Wolf said to his brother, "When a
person dies, he will be able to be revived if someone can shoot an
arrow under him."
Coyote disagreed, of course, saying that it would be a very bad
idea to bring people back to life, since then there would be too
many people and not enough room for them all.
Wolf agreed, secretly deciding that Coyote's child ought to be the
first to die. As soon as he had that thought, the boy did indeed
die.
When Coyote discovered that his child was dead, he went to Wolf
to remind him about people getting a new life if an arrow were
shot under them. But Wolf in turn reminded Coyote that he was
the one who had opposed that plan, and so it was he himself who
had determined that death should be a final thing.

The Dog in Buddhism
The following tale is one of the Jatakas, stories of the Buddha's
former lives.
The Guilty Dogs
One evening, after the king had spent the day traveling in his
magnificent carriage, the three pairs of horses were led back to the
stables to be fed and watered, but through some oversight the
vehicle was left untended in the courtyard.



During the night it rained, and the fine leather harnesses were
softened and began to exude a spicy, powdery odour that proved
irresistible to the palace dogs. They tugged and gnawed, and
scrabbled and chewed, and when just a faint glow appeared on the
eastern horizon, they tip-toed away to curl up in their usual places.
In the morning, the syces and stablemen could not believe their
eyes. With cold feet and trembling hands, they went to tell the king.
The king was furious.
We do not know how the people responsible were punished, but we
do know that he called for the death of every single dog in the
vicinity.
All the dogs in the city, pets and pye dogs alike, knew what would be
the consequence of the actions of the royal hounds (all but the very
youngest ones) and so they fled to the outskirts to join the packs
that lurked in the woods. At any moment, they expected the king's
enforcers to come and exterminate every one of them for something
they had had no paw in.
The lead dog who, it is believed, was the Buddha in a previous
lifetime, put his own fear aside, and calmly and with great dignity,
went to talk to the king. He was so imposing that the guards made
no move against him.
As he approached, the king asked, "How is it that you are still alive?
The great dog prostrated his head on the carpet between his paws,
rose again and replied, " I have come on a mission of mercy, your
Highness. "Why are you determined to put to death every dog in the
kingdom? It is not possible that they all had a bite of the royal livery.
There is certainly not enough leather on six bridles and harnesses for



every single dog here."
The king replied, "Dogs chew royal property; dogs die."
"Highness, you have always been a most just ruler. The guilty ones
deserve a punishment, that is true. Which dogs did the chewing?"
The noble hound continued, "Maharaj, is it right for all to suffer for
the wrongs of only a few? Your response to this question will surely
cause deep reflection by those in your own household, not to
mention your ministers and even your many loyal subjects of high
and low degree."
After a brief hesitation, the king said, "If you can show me the guilty
parties, I will spare the other animals."
The skillful dog responded, "It is known that dogs will eat grass to
scour their stomachs, therefore, let all the dogs eat kula grass. This
will make them cough up what is in their bodies, and then we will find
the guilty parties."
"It seems that most of the dogs have fled," said the king. "Only the
royal hounds remain. How can royal dogs be compared to common
curs? But let us see if the kula grass is effective. We will try it on
them first, then."
The royal dogs were fed kula grass and lo, and behold, they coughed
it up along with little bits of gilded leather.
The king was amazed, and he reflected on his spontaneous angry
response. He put an immediate stop to the dog hunt. He even
halted the destruction of wild dogs (except those known to kill
cattle.)
As their penance, every year the royal dogs had to serve all the



others -- pets, pye dogs and even those that lived in the forest -- at
a great feast in the city centre.
So it happened that a great king learned the virtue of restraint,
justice, courage and compassion from the Tathagata, who in that
lifetime was living in the Animal Realm as a lead dog.
Asanga and the Dog
Asanga yearned to have direct experience of the future Buddha,
Maitreya. He slowly learned patience through guidance, practice and
extraordinary experience. Once, after he had been meditating for 12
years, he left the cave and encountered a poor dog lying ill by the
wayside. It was near death, its lower body covered with maggot
infested sores.
His meditations had helped him to develop great compassion, and so
Asanga was moved to ease the animal's suffering. Naturally, he
thought of removing the maggots, but he realized that if he did that
with his fingers, he might injure them. (It is important to understand
that in the Buddhist view -- and that of Jains and many other people
-- there is no hierarchy in the realms of existence; each one is a
poor suffering individual like ourselves.) Therefore not to injure any
maggot but yet still relieve the dog, Asanga's solution was to crouch
down and gently skim off the maggots with his tongue.
The moment he did that, the dog disappeared and Bodhisattva
Maitreya appeared in its place. Asanga said, "I have longed to see
you all these many years. Why have you chosen this moment to
appear to me?"
Maitreya replied, "I have always been with you, but before now you
were not able to see me. It was necessary for you to purify your
mind and develop your compassion sufficiently before it was



possible for this to happen.
To demonstrate the truth of what he had just said, the Bodhisattva
whose name is maitri or loyal friend (or, loving-kindness) asked
Asanga to pick him up, put him around his shoulders and take a stroll
through the neighboring village.
Once there, no one noticed anything unusual at all except for one old
woman, who asked, "What are you doing walking around like that
with a sick dog on you?"
Of course, no one saw Maitreya and most noticed nothing out of the
ordinary at all. This tale from the biography of Asanga* makes a
lesser and a greater point: There is no clean nor unclean,
repugnancy comes from learning. And more importantly, whatever
we experience -- all of reality -- depends only on the state of our
mind.
*Asanga (ca. 300- 370 CE) was a brahmin from Peshawar, so
certainly ritual purity was a matter of great importance to him before
he left home. He is considered the founder of the Buddhist
approach called Yogachara, especially the branch known as
Chittamatra or Consciousness-Only.
The Dog Yogi
Kukuripa [Tib. Shiwa Sangpo] (ca. 1000) was one of the
Mahasiddhas (one of the 84 greatest yogis) and one of Tilopa's
teachers. He stayed not far from Pullahari in western Magadha,
where he lived on an island "in a poison lake," surrounded by dogs.
One of the females reveals herself as a dakini, and she is
instrumental in his Realization, for
. . . he descended from paradise to rejoin her in the cave.



The dog leaped and pranced with joy when she caught sight of
her beloved master. But no sooner did he sit down and begin to
scratch her favorite spot, just behind the ears, than she vanished
from sight! There before him, wreathed in a cloud of glory, stood
a radiantly beautiful Dakini.
~ Keith Dowman's Masters of Enchantment. Rochester, Vermont:
Inner Traditions, 1988. [link is to newer edition]
See Kukkuripa's white dog affectionately kissing his chin.
Kukuraja was a Buddhist of brahmin origins who practiced in a
cave in the company of a dog. In the legends of Guru Rinpoche,
after some tantric scriptures landed on the palace roof, King
Indrabodhi brought them to Kukuraja for interpretation.
(Usually the two names are taken to refer to the same person, but
perhaps they were not.)
Kshitagarbha's Mother
The "Earthstore" bodhisattva, is often assimilated to Yama, the Lord
of the Hell Realm. He strives to help those who find themselves in
the realm of great suffering, but he does not judge them.
Nevertheless, associated as he is with death, dogs appear in his
depictions and in accounts associated with him
In the Chinese tradition, he is frequently depicted accompanied by a
dog which relates to his dedication to the welfare of his mother, even
after her death. It is said that when he had learned that his mother
had passed away, he immediately hastened to the hell realm with a
view to comforting and seeking consideration for her there. He
never did find her there for she had already taken rebirth as a female



dog.
His devotion to her was so great that upon his return to earth, he
found out where she was and arranged to adopt her as his constant
companion.
Compassionate Dogs
Oct. 4, 2004, BBC News (photos 1-9) Every evening, a "lurcher"
freed other caged dogs so they could all raid the kitchen. They
would return to their quarters before the staff arrived in the
morning.
Read about Ginny, (1998-2005) the righteous dog, who rescued
not only cats, but other animals too.
Dog-Worship?
According to Roger A. Caras (A Dog is Listening. NY: Summit, 1991)
archaeologists have found, at Ashkelon in today's Israel, a burial
ground for over 750 dogs dating from 500-332 BCE, when the
Persians ruled there. Each animal is buried with care in its own
grave, and over a third were no longer puppies when they died,
apparently of a variety of causes. One can only wonder at the role
these animals once played.
Buddhists do not worship animals. Hindus venerate them in their
association with a particular deity, such as the owl (Uluka)
associated with goddess Laxmi.

Himalayan Dogs



The largest and best known of the Himalayan regions is Tibet, but
Tibet is not the only Himalayan land. Outside the realms of
geography and political science, the word "Tibetan" is often used in
this broadest sense.
There is a proverb saying that happiness is being accompanied on
one's travels by a dog. Also, dogs are believed to be a superior type
of animal possessing of a nature close to that of humans. Some
gompas or monastic institutions keep and care for them in the belief
that dogs are monks who could not maintain their commitments, so
that continued contact with the Buddha's teachings is thought to
help them in the future.
One lama is reported as saying that if someone disturbs you while
you are at your practice, ask them not to do it again. However, if a
dog seems to want something, attend to its needs. ~ S. Simsova,
Kagyu group at Yahoo! Aug. 2004.
The great master Jamgon Kongtrul Lodro Taye (d. 1899) in The
Torch of Certainty says, "Once you have listened to a single brief
discourse, If you lack respect for your guru, You will be born a dog a
hundred times, And a butcher after that."
Following that logic, we would invite you to consider the moral
consequence for one who thinks little of abandoning a dog, whose
essential nature is not unlike that of humans.

Tibetan Dogs



Generally, the dogs of Tibet are not classed by Tibetans as being of
a certain breed but rather by size and function. Although the
distinctive features of the various kinds are recognized, a dog is
preferred according to how closely it resembles the ones believed to
have accompanied the Buddha. Those animals resembling lions are
said to be rakshasas in disguise, who could regain their enormous
size and ferocious character for the protection of the Master and the
Dharma.
"Many unusual breeds found in Tibet ... " by Hon. Mrs. Eric
Bailey (The American Kennel Gazette, vol. 54, no. 3, Mar. 1,
1937. Louis de Casanova, ed.)
M. Sundqvist's site (classifications in New Delhi, 1970.)
Tibetans living in the traditional manner did not traffic in dogs since
they were held in such high esteem. They only considered them
fitting as gifts, and an especially fine dog might be given to a
monastery or to an individual lama as a donation.
Damchi ("tied dog") is the term for a guard dog. Like any kind of
dog, how they behave depends on how they are treated. The dogs
that are left loose to guard compounds and monasteries are often
fierce.
Two dogs of Nepal in 1989.
Guard dogs do their thing at Palpung Gompa.
Tibetan Mastiff
The Tibetan mastiff is a working dog resembling a Newfoundland,
and it functions as a herder's assistant and as a caravan guardian.
On their travels during which they regularly come into contact with



the dogs of villagers, they tend to interbreed with those, and so
purebred mastiffs (as most of the other ancient Asian breeds) are
quite rare.
Last of the Dokhyi or "Phyu-khi," the Tibetan Mastiff:
"Over a gradual period of two decades or so, Sikkim has lost the
Tibetan Mastiff, a magnificent pure breed of dog belonging to the
nomadic ‘Dokpasʼ or Tibetan graziers in trans-Himalayan Sikkim.
Lonely army personnel diluted the breed with mongrels brought
up as pet pups from lower altitudes to the cold desert. On
finishing their stint in this difficult region, usually over a year or
two, they left leaving the dogs behind. These fed off the kitchen
and mess wastes and multiplied over the years. They have now
taken to roaming in packs on the plateau in Chho Lhamo, Lhonak
and Lashar, hanging around army camps and the village of
Thangu, preying upon wildlife and have even been seen
swimming in the glacial lakes after Ruddy Shelduck chicks. Of late
they have taken to preying upon domestic livestock of the
Dokpas.
The pure breed of Tibetan mastiff has been reduced to one very
old male at Thangu Monastery. All other dogs are now completely
mongrelised. In order to save or revive the breed it is possible to
purchase pedigree stock perhaps from remote areas in Bhutan.
The Dokpas are confident of training this master herder in the lost
art of herding yak, sheep and goats on the Tibetan plateau
accompanied by a slingshot bearing Dokpa"
In Bhutan, dogs are noted for being friendly although they tend to
sleep all day and stay awake all night barking "to keep evil spirits at
bay." This night barking is still a notable characteristic of the Tibetan
mastiff.



"He had become a very handsome dog, with glossy black hair,
pendent triangular ears, short muzzle, high forehead, jet-black
eyes, straight limbs, arched neck, and a most glorious tail curling
over his back." ~ p. 102, Himalayan Journal, with note to see
woodcut 'of his father' in Vol. 1, p. 203.
Tibetan Terrier
This breed has a long coat resembling that of the Hungarian Puli.
HE Tai Situ with his white Dokyi.
How ca. 1922 the Dokyi [Tibetan names for breeds are often
used interchangeably] that is, "Tibetan Terrier" came to the
West.
Tibetan Spaniel
Like the "TT" or Tibetan Terrier, which is not a terrier at all, the
smaller, smooth-coated Tibetan Spaniel is not a spaniel.
This is still a relatively rare animal that is possessed of unique
qualities. It may have originated in some beyul where its ancient
characteristics were protected as a consequence of isolation. Its
place of origin might be somewhere in West Tibet, where there was
less chance that these unique characteristics could be "eroded" by
Chinese breeds like the popular Shi-tzu, or the Lhasa Apso that is
prevalent in central Tibet.
Traders may have brought it to the Chumbi Valley between Sikkim
and Bhutan, since contemporary oral tradition traces it there.
However, as that valley is a major trade route, it seems unlikely that it
is the actual place of origin. Some Westerners have referred to the
breed, especially those with longer muzzles, as "Damci" (pron.



damchi) but the east Tibetan expression does not actually refer to a
particular breed but to any dog that is kept tied up, especially the
large guard dogs..
In Tibetan, the "spaniel" is called how-wa, which according to the
dictionary of S. C. Das means "primitive dog" or "hill dog." (Mrs.
Bailey, in 1937, wrote "ha-pa.") They are also called Ri-kyi or
mountain dog.

"Tibbie."
Other Breeds
Shaggy, whiskered Lhasa Apsos ("capital city grand
dads," although Mrs. Bailey derives apso from rabso meaning goat -
reference to its long coarse hair) have been called "a cross between
the lions that guard buddhas and some monkeys" but that
description fits a number of small east Asian dogs. The Pekingese
dog (of Chinese heritage) was also favoured for its imagined
resemblance to Buddha's lions, although today the Shi-tzu is
preferred for its conformity to the long-maned "snow lion" type.

The name, Shih-tzu originates from 1643, when the Manchu rulers
of China received a few "lion dogs" from the Dalai Lama, and so dogs
of this type have retained the designation, tzu meaning "of the
master or, lama."



Naming a Himalayan Dog
If you are thinking of choosing a Tibetan name for a dog, find out
how the name is actually pronounced. One web site decorated with
incongruously arranged Tibetan syllables gives a long list of such
names, but many are merely repetitions using different English
spellings for the same expression.
"Tashi" (auspicious one) is possibly the most popular name for a
Tibetan dog. "Yangchen" (melodious sound) is suitable for a dog
that enjoys its own voice. As in any cultural context, it would not be
considered respectful to choose the names of venerated figures.
In Aboriginal America
At the time of the Walking of Creation, Gitchi-manitou sent Wolf to
keep Original Man company, but after that he ordered Original Man
and Wolf to go their separate ways.
(The wolf and the Anishnabe (Ojibway or "Western Cree") are
considered similar since both mate for life, have a clan and tribal
system, have had their land taken, been hunted for their hair, been
pushed almost to destruction and are now experiencing a time of
recovery [at least in Canada.]) The dog was given as a substitute,
but since it is a relative of the wolf it should be kept separate from
contemporary people and away from sacred objects or rituals. To do
otherwise would endanger people's lives.
~ Kevin L. Callahan, University of Minnesota.
There are no descendents of ancient aboriginal American dogs
left, except for the few northern breeds, and perhaps the
Mexican hairless /chola and the chihuahua.
White Dog



It was a custom of Iroquoian people to use a white dog as a
sacrificial scapegoat, and white dogs have often been considered
unlucky. In the Treasury of Good Sayings, a Bon chronicle of Tibet,
the coat of a white dog was dressed with a poisonous substance by
a son of King Trikum's widowed queen called Rulakye. When it went
home to the Bon ruler, Lonam, who had held the throne for 13 years,
he could not resist patting the dog and so he subsequently died.
Famous Dogs
In Euro-American lands, there are a number of monuments to faithful
dogs such as Robbie Burn's dog, Greyfriar's Bobby, a policeman's
associate and in New France, Dollard des Ormeaux' dog, Pilote.
Gander, the Newfoundland dog, mascot of the Royal Rifles of
Canada, was awarded a Dickin Medal ("the animal's Victoria
Cross") for self-sacrifice during the 1941 futile defense of Hong
Kong.
The intelligent and indomitable Balto, whose statue by F. G.
Roth, graces NY's Central Park.
Fu Dogs
Bronze or ceramic guardian or temple dog figures are not really dogs
at all, though they may be referred to as "Foo dogs" or "dogs of Fo
(ie. Buddha.)" They are an evolution of the lions that support
Buddha Shakyamuni's throne.
One Chinese eclipse myth tells how it is a celestial dog that
continuously tries to swallow the sun, and the male of the pair of Fo
dogs is usually shown playing with a splendid ball.
There is a relatively rare type of dog of the Spitz family that



resembles a Chow. It is called the Foo, and was bred to resemble the
guardian lion or T'ien Kou [celestial] dog. Also known as the
"Sacred Dog of Sinkiang or "Chinese Choo Hunting Dog," it may
derive its common name from the ancient city of Foochow.
Dog Food
In Vietnam dogs were sacrificed to the indigenous gods in rituals
intended to induce rain. Dogs are eaten there during certain periods
of the lunar year in the belief that this meat contributes to virility and
longevity.
Dog Wars
The evening of July 19, 2001, the day before the decision by the IOC
to award the 2008 Olympic Games, when Beijing was considered
first choice (versus Paris and Toronto) despite its abysmal human
rights' record that includes the increased use of the death penalty,
the kidnap and torture of dissidents, and the rape and pillage of the
land of Tibet, one American news network ran a story about dogs.
It featured the importation, breeding and care of Swiss St. Bernard
dogs with a view to their use as an efficient source of protein for the
masses. A Shenyong facility was featured but the report said that
there are 20 such experimental farms in China. It seems that
introducing a St. Bernard into a line of mongrels can increase the
average size of dogs by 50%. Dog meat, which we saw hanging,
sold in the market and served in restaurants, is high priced and is
considered a delicacy. However, the objective of the program is to
use it for food more extensively.
The man whose job it is to prepare their feed and generally care for
them admitted that he did not think he could bring himself to eat
them.



" . . . but Weilin hopes that his venture will make dog meat an even
more popular commodity for the Chinese dinner table."
Though any compassionate person might agree that the government
of the PRC did not deserve to benefit from the allocation of any
celebration of international brother and sisterhood, this manipulation
of our political consciousness by activating the switch called
"Happiness is a warm puppy" [ popular book by Snoopy's creator,
Charles M. Schulz, 1987] was startling in its blatancy -- right up
there with the dog on the sampan in the film, Apocalypse Now.
China: Plans for a Dog Meat Factory Near Beijing, article #6 from an
archive at U. of Guelph, Ontario, also provides context:
"Sensitive to its international image, South Korea closed
thousands of restaurants during the 1980s, prohibiting the sale of
foods deemed unsightly. Legal challenges to the ban met with
some success however, and in 1997 Cho Yong-Sop opened the
first of what he planned as a chain of dog meat restaurants in
Seoul. While it remains an unpopular habit in terms of
international relations, in Southeast Asia dog meat is big
business. "
The throwaway pet culture results in huge numbers of stray dogs.
This necessitates the WSPA to warn breeders against exporting
pedigree dogs to areas where they become delicacies.
The Chinese media may have started the puppy media wars. A
translation of a Chinese newspaper article of Mar. 16, 2001:
"Since last year, cases of urban violence increase steadily and
some suburbs are getting very dirty. In addition, vagrant dogs and
rabid dogs are more and more numerous, and if this pest is not
controlled, it could threaten the organisation of the Olympic



Games. A French friend told me that dogs' feces are everywhere
in the street of Paris and that it is difficult to welcome the Olympic
Games in such conditions."
Great Leap Forward continued in PRChina in the Year of the Dog
(2006): Canadian media (Canoe web site) reported on Aug.
1/06 that, with 3 cases of rabies reported, in one city 50,000
dogs were beaten to death.
Healing
Perhaps because they lick their wounds which generally heal fairly
quickly, dogs are associated with the healing process.
In Greece and Rome dogs were considered messengers of the
gods, and it was thought that they could smell out diseases.
Special healing dogs -- cynotherapists -- were kept in temples
to comfort the sick and dying, and to licked their wounds which
sometimes caused a miraculous recovery. Their divine patron
was Hermanubis [Hermes + Anubis] with the head of a dog on
the body of a man.

Oprah Lore
There are a few contemporary anecdotes that substantiate the



therapeutic ability of the dog. One relates how the pet of a woman
with an unusual growth on her leg used to sniff at it and bark. This
behavior impelled her to consult a doctor who discovered that the
growth was a particularly virulent skin cancer. The dog probably
saved her life.
Another dog, a yellow Labrador called Mia, sniffed and pawed at her
mistress' chest with some regularity. When the dog finally leaped at
her with full force behind her paws, the woman felt quite a pain and
went for tests. Her life was probably saved as a result of the
subsequent surgery and treatment for the virulent cancer that was
discovered there. ~ Oprah, of course.
Roger Carras (A Dog is Listening: The Way Some of Our Closest
Friends View Us. NY: Summit, 1992.) video recorded the behaviour
of a small mixed breed dog named Sheba as she "predicted" Angie's
epileptic seizures and then physically coaxed her into a spot in the
room where she would not hurt herself.
We have seen that dogs are associated with death, often in the role
of the guardian of the Underworld or Land of the Dead, eg.
Cerberus, the many-headed hound of Classical mythology. This
association is an actual one. As scavengers, packs of them
performed an essential function on fields of battle. Yet, perhaps by a
kind of hermaneutic transformation, they are equally associated with
life, fertility and longevity.
Dog-gerel
There could be nothing more miserable or lowly than a cur (>cu is
Gaelic for hound. Kuk or kuch means dog or hound in many
languages) except perhaps a tooth from its corpse!
Cuon is the Greek for dog (cf. cu as in the name of the Irish hero,



Cuchullain) and the term was selected by taxonomists (Cuon alpinus)
to designate the dhole, a wild animal sometimes classed as a Canid
and sometimes not, that lives in mountainous regions in India and
other parts of Asia.
Since mongrel is a disparaging term for a dog of mixed parentage,
(today we say "random bred") a "mongrelization" is not something to
be proud of. The term is usually used for an overly simplified and
corrupted version of literature.
Tyke is another such expression. The negative connotation was
present in America until about 30 years ago but seems to have
disappeared when we spell it, tike, which refers to a little child.
And then there's a mutt, from mutton; in other words, a stupid dog
with the intellect of a sheep.
The contrast in connotation of whelp [random product of a mindless
breeding] and puppy [cute baby dog] reflect our ambivalence, but
now consider the word dogged [unflagging, determined
persistence.]
Dog Days of Summer: In the six weeks after the solstice, the Dog
Star, Sirius, appears in the night sky of the Northern Hemisphere. It
was once thought that this bright star contributed to the heat
characteristic of the beginning of August.
There are numerous expressions in the English language that refer to
the miserable existence of canines. We say someone is dog tired; he
died like a dog; their relationship is going to the dogs; she was once
a beauty, but now she looks like a dogʼs breakfast; the business
world is dog eat dog.
Domestication



New findings show that the dog was domesticated from the Asian
wolf earlier than had been thought -- perhaps before 20,000 BCE.
Physical evidence indicates it is the first of the animals to be
domesticated by humans. The remains of the 'Star Carr' dog found
in Yorkshire, England date to 7500 BCE and still clearly show wolf
ancestry.
A most amazing trick was accomplished indeed when people
transformed the sheep-eater into the sheep's nanny.

Read about the African wild dog (Lycaon pictus) also called the
Cape Hunting Dog. With ears like satellite dishes, it is a very
social canine that maintains injured pack members rather than
killing them as hyenas would. Its success at hunting is 85%
compared to the lion who only manages to catch less than 20%
of its prey.

The Boy Who Lived with Dogs
Wed., June 20, 2001, Santiago, Chile (Reuters) -- An abandoned
10-year-old boy found living in a cave and scavenging for food
with a pack of dogs became so thirsty that he forced himself to
drink a bitch's milk, child-care workers said on Tuesday.
Authorities took the boy, named Axel, into care last weekend after
he spent two years roaming a southern town with the dog pack.
The case has shocked Chile, a conservative South American
nation that prides itself on strong family ties.



Axel began running with 15 strays in the port town of Talcahuano
after escaping from a children's home. On cold nights, they would
share a cave on the outskirts of town, workers of Chile's National
Child-care Service said.
In television footage, Axel was aggressive, swore at care workers
and spoke in short, surly phrases.
Asked whether he had drunk dog's milk as reported by police, he
said, "Yes." He stuck his tongue out and screwed up his face up in
disgust.
"You still drank it even though you didn't like it?" a journalist
asked the boy, now living in a children's center in the city of
Concepcion.
"Yes, because I was thirsty. It was my breakfast," Axel replied.
Mother Dog "Lyla"
Wearing a smart red, white and gray top, he scribbled on pieces
of paper and cut out pictures with scissors. One of his drawings
was of eight dogs of different colors and sizes.
The most prominent figure was a large blue dog that resembled a
poodle. Underneath, was written the name "Lyla." A care worker
said this was the dog that suckled Axel.
"That dog was pregnant," the boy said.
Axel, who appeared healthy but had two front teeth missing, at
times swore at the woman care worker and threatened to throw



scissors across the room. But he also showed touches of
tenderness.
He cut out a picture from a sheet of paper and tried to pin it to
the lapel of a television journalist.
Axel has had a tough life, child-care workers said.
"He was abandoned at the age of five by his parents, who were
very abusive. He was effectively thrown onto the streets," Delia
Delgatto of the child-care service told Reuters.
He was taken into a care center but escaped two years ago and
teamed up with street dogs in Talcahuano.
The boy and the pack foraged for food together, police said. "He
would eat out of garbage cans and find leftovers," Delgatto said.
City workers reported his case to the police who tried to seize
him last Saturday. But Axel threw himself into the wintry cold
waters of the southern Pacific Ocean to try to escape.
"A police officer dived into the water and saved him," a police
spokesman said.
Care workers said Axel would need long periods of counseling
and would stay in care for the foreseeable future. Delgatto said it
was unlikely he would be reunited with his parents.
Did you know . . . ?
Many human foods can harm or even kill a dog



Just a few grapes or raisins can harm a dog.
Macadamia nuts are even more dangerous, as are greenish
potatoes or tomatoes and other similar solacaea.
Mushrooms can be harmful, too, so a slice of pizza is a very bad
idea -- there could be more than one dangerous thing on it.
Caffeine (the active ingredient in coffee, tea, cola and many so
called sports drinks) can also harm a dog.
Avocados are sufficiently harmful to cause death.
Chocolate is very dangerous, too, for fatal kidney failure can result if
it is ingested.
Onions and similar bulbs especially garlic should be avoided,
despite the fact that pet food manufacturers seem not to care and
many products include it. Fatal haemolytic anemia can result.
Xylitol, a sweetener derived from the sap of the birch tree* and
found in chewing gum, baked goods and oral health products, can
kill a dog within 15 minutes of ingestion. *A whole line of soft drinks
is being sold under the Birch Tree label -- do not share them with
your dog.
Female dog urine contains higher concentrations of salts such
as urea, ammonia and potassium than that of the males. This
kills the grass or causes stains similar to fertilizer burn. You can
train your dog to use a specific area of the lawn to relieve itself
or follow her with a watering can and dilute the spot she picks
by drenching it.
Alaskan scientists have found a way to convert dog manure for
use in flower gardens (not for use with food crops because of



risk of disease.) They say to use 2 parts poo + 1 part sawdust,
rotate in a drum regularly, and keep at 145 degrees F.
In the far North, dog hair is spun and woven. But did you know
people in warmer climates do the same? See cloth with red
dog-hair squares from northeastern India.

Spaniel: Word meaning "Spanish" ie. from Espana or Spain, the
country where the breeding of pet animals was a specialty. By about
the 15th century, the Spaniards had developed 400 breeds of rabbit,
for example. A breed is a genetic lineage in which the parents
invariably produce offspring that resemble themselves, at least in
discernible ways. The spaniel is a medium-to-small dog of generally
placid temperament that is characterized by a smooth silky coat,
soulful expression and droopy ears. The style used to be to dock
[cut very short] the tail. A spaniel is often especially devoted to one
person.
Tibetan names: Tibetan orthography [way of spelling] uses many
kinds of unpronounced letters to distinguish between one meaning
and another. Also, there are a number of different systems in use for
transliterating into European languages such as English. Try to find
out how to say the name correctly, otherwise you might be saying
something rude or nonsensical.
