The Early Greek Religion and the Coming ofthe Age ofIron
Jan Bouzek
1. Sources and methods used
Though the Nilsson surveys are still very important,1 we should also use for this paragraph more recent books, most notably Burkert's,2 and confront the results with what can be gained from the observation of artistic repre sentations, their style and structure. Our approach should also be compa rative, i.e. based on the method developed by M . Eliade and G . Dum6zil. In Greece, we are in a particular position having narrative visual art of specific qualities. E . Auerbach in his Mimesis4 compares two scenes as characteristic of two different attitudes in telling stories. One example is Abraham ascen ding the mountain to sacrifice his son Isaac, in which he is later prevented by the Lord. There is no scenery, no description of details of the landscape or of the persons acting (Gen.22). This passage he compares with the descrip tion of Odysseus returning home and being recognized by his old nurse Eurykleia from an old scarf (Od. xix, 386-508) The story is full of small concrete details and the imagination of the reader or listener is flooded with concrete information, as against the abstract scenery of the story of Abraham and Isaac. The Greeks depicted even their abstract ideas in concrete pictures taken from the sensual world, their creative spirit changed their environment into artistic products. They expressed their views, their feelings, their ideas even in many objects of everyday use, where other civilisations had no aspirations, they projected their ideals into material forms more than any other nation in human history. Therefore their art is a good source of information on their attitudes, their inclinations, their views, their spirit and also their religion. M u c h has already been attempted and even attained in this field,5 but much can still be done.

Any art reflects the aesthetic, philosophical and religious views of the artists and their society, the consumers of this art, but it also influences these views by its accomplished products. Iconography opened one of the new doors to this field, but even non-representational art, when studied deeply enough, can provide much information, and this also concerns the archaeo logical discoveries of non-artistic character.
2. The prelude
In many ways, the close of the Bronze Age in the East Mediterranean and the contemporary rise of the Urnfield cultures can both be understood as a preparatory period to what happened later during the earliest Iron Age. We can first start with Egypt. After the reform trial of Echnaton in Egypt with his solar deity Aton, comparable to Ahura Mazdao of Avesta, which only enjoyed short-time success, Moses founded there the religion of the O l d Testament initiated by the message of Jahve in the burning bush which again might remind us of the role of the fire in the Zoroastrism. What is less well known is the development in northern and central Europe. One of the aspects of the European Urnfield civilisations is that of a religious movement. The first of the most apparent features gave to this culture its name: the particular burial rite. In early cultures, cremation was usually meant to draw a clear, sharp boundary between the world of the living and that of the dead. It was also intended to prevent dangerous forces abiding dead bodies, something feared in all early societies. The human soul should go on its postmortal way faster, not clinging to his or her former relationships - a clear opposite to what was intended i n the Egyptian culture. The Egyptians intended to keep their dead in close touch with the earth, so they not only embalmed them, but also brought them meat, a substance forbidden in this respect in most religions. In more rigid societies (like with the Romans), even wine was forbidden for libations on the graves, but not with the Greeks. Nevertheless, the offering of blood on the graves was already part of black magic there. For the Persians, fire was too sacred to be used for burning dead bodies, but cremation with dispersing burned bones was usual in India and in other cultures, which intended the opposite to the Egyptians. The bearers of the European Urnfield culture did not go that far: they placed the burned bones in pottery urns or other containers and then in graves. The human sacrifices attested by skeletons of killed people in many Middle and Late Bronze Age cultures show us that not everyone followed such moral rigidity and that some kind of black magic also had its share in the rituals6. This seems

to be less often the case in the Lusatian culture than with its North Alpine and Carpathian neighbours.7 In general, the strict funeral rite was apparently part of a movement for moral improvement of society in order to preserve the positive qualities of the old system before the Age of Iron (the worst of all ages according to Hesiod) finally destroyed the old order. W e should, however, not consider this single aspect of the burial rite alone being too important for many societies: Greeks, Etruscans and Romans used both cremation and inhumation at the same time, according to the particular familial tradition.8 But this is only one aspect. The second is a shift from earthenly vegetation and fertility deities to celestial (in Greek, Olympean) gods. The most impor tant and most frequently represented among Late Tumulus and Urnfield symbolic motifs is the sun in a boat drawn by water birds (Fig. I ) . 9 In other

solar disc is represented, but sometimes also the solar god or solar hero himself (Fig. 3). This deity has parallels notably in the Persian mythology (Ahura Mazda or Mithra), and it should be remembered that the Echnaton reform of el-Amarna was roughly contemporary with the rise of the Urnfield culture. Echnaton's religious reform (c. 1372-1354 B.C.) could also be inter preted as an attempt to bring new life into the Egyptian religious tradition. With the end of the third Sothis (Sirius) period (in 1322 B.C.), the Egyptian cul ture became, after this unsuccessful attempt, definitely focused towards the graves of the past, and Moses had to separate his followers from this deve lopment in order to be able to found the religion of the O l d Testament.
Regarded from another point of view, the Urnfield religion seems to show both main "new" religious aspects as defined by the Greeks. The Apolline aspect was represented by the Sun god and/or solar hero, a deity related both to Greek Zeus Fig. 3. Sun hero: handle decoration of and Apollo, but more to the Second god,

drawn by swans. We should perhaps mention that this tradition lasted long. In Thrace, the Early Iron Age solar peak sanctuaries became later places of worship of the Thracian Rider and, in Christian times, there were usually churches of St. George placed there. O n Monte Gargano, where an im portant solar sanctuary of the Iapygians existed since the Early Iron Age, later the famous monastery of St. Michael was founded. A s a divine hero fighting the evil, Michael can well be compared to the pre-Christian Mithra, the Thracian Hero - Rider and even to some aspects of Apollo. Orpheus was considered being the son of Apollo and we find much in orphism that derives from this tradition.
Besides the solar hero we find i n all these areas representations of his female counterpart. She has two aspects: mother and maiden. In the Delian triad, they were called Leto and Artemis, in Thrace we find the name Bendis for the maiden goddess, while the mother was sometimes called Hera, as on one of the Trebenishte vessels (Fig. 4 ) . 1 2 In Ephesus, both aspects were called Artemis. In this way, she comes near to Egyptian Isis and to the Virgin

The Dionysiac aspect seems to be marked in the drinking rituals attested by ceramic hoards1 and the bronze cups, the sacrificial drinking vessels which sometimes appear in a set of twelve (Dresden - Dobritz, Jenisovice),14 thus being a "complete" representation of the local human universe, as e.g. the twelve tribes of Israel, the twelve city-members of the Ionian or Etruscan league. The finest prehistoric cups and mugs were made for drinking feasts since the Eneolithic. Some alcoholic drinks were known since the Neolithic and, in the old Testament, Noah is the first person getting drunk. Though we hear more about beer from Egypt and Mesopotamia, viticulture was not unknown to the Bronze Age Mediterranean. Even beer drinking had cultic connotations in many areas - e.g. Celtic gods had to drink beer every year to stay young, but wine was in the wine-producing areas the most important alcoholic substance, which kept its significance even in Christian eucharisty. Some drinking feasts of members of a Mdnnerbund may be first repre sented in European prehistory in the Beaker cultures and, once introduced, this phenomenon never disappeared completely, but only in the Iron Age with the full establishment of the Gefolgschaftssysstem, the drinking feasts became the backbone of the social organisation of the warrior class. We have this on all representations of banqueting in Oriental, Early Greek, Etruscan, Thracian and Hallstatt (Situla) arts, etc. 5 Also the Greek symposion derived from this tradition. But the Dionysiac force also affected women, as we know well from many Greek stories about maenads. In the story of the death of Orpheus we have one of the testimonies on the polarity between Apollinic and Dionysiac, which marked the whole Greek culture and even later arts. Apollo and Dionysus were considered new gods by the Greeks; they governed over something inside human beings, not over nature forces like other Olympeans (see below).16 While the religious movements of this age in the Mediterranean prepared the way for the most important religions of the Classical world, one of them the direct predecessor of the Christianity and the other, through Greek philosophy and art, the second main heritage for us, the Urnfield religious movement contributed to the later religions of barbarian Europe, notably those of the Celts and of Germanic tribes. Still in the Nordic myths, the sun moves across the sky by the daytime in a chariot drawn by horses, while the blue sun of the night is brought back from west to east in a boat drawn by

swans. A s we will see even below, Dionysus, Orphism and at least one aspect of Apollo (the Hyperborean one) came to Greece from the north and all seem to have been related to the Urnfield religious movement. Remembe ring the Gnostic tradition of cosmic Christ coming on his descent to the earth through the sun, both the religions of Echnaton and of the Urnfields may have been understood as a kind of preparation to what later joined in the roots of Christianity and it also may have reflected this particular aspect of cosmic development: a predecessor of what is later reflected in the adoration of the Magi, and in the traditions of the independent rise of the Irish Christianity.
3. The continuity and discontinuity from the Bronze Age in Greece
Of the gods known from the Mycenaean tablets, which seem to cover the 13th century B . C . , 1 7 one half disappeared and the other half remained known to later Greeks. Just this last Mycenaean period of L H III B - C seems for various reasons being the period in which much begins that later becomes part of Greek culture of the Iron A g e . 1 8 A s generally known, the Greek sanctuaries show only little Mycenaean tradition and, with few exceptions, from this late period only.19 The mixture of local, Oriental and ~ Euro p e a n " elements (see below), was characteristic of the Sea Peoples period in all domains. Many cult places, like Olympia and Artemis Orthia in Sparta, do not seem to have important Mycenaean forerunners, while in others, like Delos, Delphi and Eleusis, the tradition is slight and the evidence of cult continuity doubtful. The shift of the degree of significance from the Nature goddesses towards the Olympean gods can also be traced in the Linear B documents, and is reflected i n Greek mythology as a gradual process, although with some dramatic peaks: even in later times, the old gods did not lose all significance.
Apollo and Aphrodite are missing in Linear B texts. While Aphrodite was a goddess of Oriental ancestry mainly, Apollo had two different roots: one in Asia Minor (Lycia) and the second in the north (Hyperborean). The

smiting god is of an Oriental ancestry, as shown in the tradition of the bronze figurines,20 but, Zeus and his Olympean family is better comparable to IndoEuropean than Semitic religions.2 The unity of temple, altar and cult statue is only known in Greek religion,and, as against all earlier systems, only the Greeks changed the earlier pyramidal attitude to the egality of men and gods, in which the sacrifices meant usually a common feast for both: such a relation was behind most of Greek sacrifices.22 Also the priests became more equal with other people being officials of the community and responsible to it, not lords of their co-citizens. The oracle sanctuaries were above the level of belonging to one single city-state only, and the even more high-in-rank mysterial sanctuaries were extremely democratic: the initiation was accessible to anyone, even to women and slaves. In Eleusis, the language of the adept had to be "under standable", i.e. he or she had to speak Greek, but other sanctuaries, like Samothrace, did not know even this condition.
The shift of significance from old to new gods, the Olympean (celestial) deities, started apparently in the Mycenaean times - it seems to be reflected already in the Linear B texts. But Apollo and Dionysus are new gods, both symbolizing new qualities of the Iron Age man, and a similar phenomenon brings Athena, though her name may originally have been that of the old Palace Goddesses in the Aegean. Her birth from the head of Zeus and her support of the new kind of heroes who are able to think on a more sophisti cated level, like Odysseus, show her as a kind of "Urgedanke" in our modern language. Most of the subjects of pictorial representations known to Geometric art had some predecessors during the last two centuries of the Mycenaean age, though these subjects were expressed in artistic formulae taken over from an earlier alien style. The new teaching had to be expressed first in the old vocabulary, like the Early Christian art had to use the Classical artistic means before evolving its own artistic language. The artists educated in the old tradition could not take more than the first steps towards a new style, more appropriate for the new message. This new spiritual world was also first expressed along the periphery of the Mycenaean world. These works, like the Tanagra sarcophagi, show scenes with mourning women and with prothesis of the dead, birds with a wheel, often flanking it, a hero between two birds,

and other antithetic motifs, similar to those known e.g. on the Pylos diadem. The sphinx also appears frequently in funerary contexts, and the man con fronted with a sphinx may perhaps already be called Oedipus. Just as the mediaeval religious world had its roots in Late Antiquity, which emerged more fully expressed again after some "Dark Age" with few and modest artistic representations, these forerunners of Geometric and Early Archaic representations testify to the existence of an identical, though less developed spiritual movement which predominated in the art of the 8th and 7th centu ries B . C . Most of the "raw materials" of the new religion established in Early Iron Age Greece were present in the country since the 13th century B.C., some of them even slightly earlier.
A s mediaeval civilisation needed several centuries to sprout under the surface before emerging into the full light with its own sophisticated art, Late Mycenaean style, too, unable to express the new message fully, needed a period to grow its roots before evolving artistic expressions of its own. Such ~ Dark Ages ~ of preparation are parts of the natural rhythm of human development, they are as full of potentional strength as are seeds. The first new synthesis in art was achieved with the Protogeometric style, when also the sanctuaries and offerings in them show a new religious world, in many ways different from the old Bronze A g e . 2 5
4. Outside relations of early Greek religion
The birth of the new age was a kind of drama in which more actors took part besides the chief protagonist, Greece. Like in any drama, the minor roles are also necessary to accomplish the performance and their contribution should not be forgotten. Many Greek legends show a special respect for the Phoenicians and Syria. It was the country from which Europa herself came, the Danaids as well. The Perseus story starts the myths of Greek heroes and Kadmos the Phoenician founded mysteries in Boeotia and Samothrace. Besides this, he is mentioned as having visited (and even died in) Illyria, so his activities went also beyond

the Greek sphere. Other legends, partly preserved with Plato, mention a deep respect to the Egyptian religion, where Greek wise men were taught (like Solon), but the eastern relations were more intense, and also for most of the artistic motifs in Early Greek art, there are more forerunners in the east than in Egypt, at least during the 9th, 8th and early 7th centuries B . C . 2 7 A s Janice Crowley has shown,28 most of the artistic motifs showing Egyptian and Oriental affinities in the 8th-7th centuries B . C . were more or less known to the Aegean Late Bronze Age already, but some are new, while others seem to have been forgotten for some time and reintroduced later. We shall return to this later, and here only mention how even Greek legends held a high esteem for the east as an area from which the roots of the Greek Early Iron Age culture came. The Trojan War brought to Greece the palladion, which was as necessary for the Greeks as the Golden Fleece from Colchis. Besides this, the Argonauts story also symbolizes the coming of the astrological time of Ram, in which the Greeks had to take over the leading role in the history of mankind.29
The Iphigenia story reflects a respect for the religion of Tauris in the Crimea, that of the Golden Fleece for Colchis and there are clear traces of the Greek respect for the religion of the Thracians. Both Dionysus and Orpheus came from Thrace, Samothracian mysteries were more Thracian than Greek and even priestly families in other Greek important sanctuaries claimed being of a Thracian descent.30The already mentioned Hyperborean link of Apollo points even to a more northerly situated area. What is even more important is the character of the new gods. A s against the Olympeans, who were governors of parts of nature or natural forces, both Apollo and Dionysus ruled over some qualities of human soul. Apollo was followed by

the Muses, and together with them he inspired the arts and even the philo sophy, while Dionysus, the spirit of wine, contributed to the separation of humans as individuals from the blood relations, and he also helped to organize new relations between free men in the system of Gefolgschaft and in the Greek symposion (cf. above p. 108). One more aspect should not be forgotten here: shamanism and animalistic magic, which played a great role in the eastern nomadic cultures parti cipating in the Early Iron Age koine of Geometric styles: parallels have been shown to them both from the Eurasian Animal A r t and from recent shama31
nism. The military success of Cimmerian and Scythian bands both in the Near East and in Europe in the 9th-7th centuries B . C . brought an admiration also to their religious practices: many symbolic ornaments of originally shamanistic character were taken over by their western neighbours. Both the Balkans and Central Europe were affected, and also northern Greece, most notably Thessaly,32 later famous for its witches and magicians.
5. The Age of Iron and the rise of the philosophical mind
There are two myths of the Golden Age. Today, the more popular of two presents it as the promise of a rosy future. O l d mythologies knew both, but, unlike us, they often felt closer to the story of the deterioration of the world, while the idea of the final improvement was relegated to a very distant future. From the beginning of the Christian era, the future began to appear more hopeful and most of us, even those who are not religious, share a common feeling that the world may rather be improving. There is, of course, also the opposite myth as well: the idea of Oswald Spengler's Untergang des Abendlandes, of nuclear and ecological catastrop hes or entropy. Hesiod and later Lucretius took a pessimistic view of the advent of the Age of Iron. In their eyes, the Iron Age meant another big step downwards from the initial Golden Age after the stepwise deterioration of the Silver and the Bronze Ages. The gods were felt as further away from humans than ever before, the laws lost their force, morals deteriorated.33 We must admit that Hesiod had good reasons for his position and that he was supported by myths of other European and Mediterranean peoples.

But more optimistic attitudes towards the new age also existed. Homer envisaged the future greatness of Greece. The acquiring of the Trojan palladium, the happy-end of the Odyssey are signs of a better future, and the prophecies of the Messiah in the O l d Testament show another kind of historical optimism. The human mind underwent changes, which can be traced both in Greece and in Palestine. The last Bronze Age heroes could not combat their passions and they became the main characters of Greek tragedies. In the Iliad, Aias is an example of the final Bronze Age heroes. Like these heroes, he cannot control his passions by his intellect, he commits foolish acts and finally even suicide. Achilles and Hector, are good examples of the next stage. Achilles is often torn by his temper [though less so than Aias], but both conscientiously fulfil their duties, their destiny, obeying the old theocratic rules. Hector, in particular, is a very noble character, but both of them have to die, unable to pass the threshold into the new world. Finally only the sly Odysseus, after many difficult situations in which he is helped by Athena, the goddess of clear spirit and logical thought, is able to enter the new age of new wisdom.34 The story of David and Goliath is a good parallel example of crossing the Iron Age threshold. The victory over Goliath was not according to Olympic standards, in his love affairs and struggle for power David shows a slyness similar to that of Odysseus, but he was favoured by Jahve for similar qualities as Odysseus by Palas Athene.35 In the Iliad and Odyssey, the Phoenicians are depicted as morally unclean not only because they were not "us", but because their habits showed the new qualities of the human mind, the qualities which were soon to destroy the aristocratic society of those to whom Homer addressed his songs. Hiram the architect and Phoenician ships bringing raw materials are similar motifs in the O l d Testament. For some time, the Phoenicians were more clever than their neighbours and they took the lead of the first stage of the new age.
6. The meaning of ornaments in Greek Geometric art and the Dark Age religion of the Greeks
This is one of the regions where we, with our present way of thought, can penetrate only with great difficulty. Our scientific mind operating with narrow concepts (Begriffe) is quite alien to the state of mind and the feeling of the people of old who painted and observed the ornaments. Though those we are studying now mark the beginning of what was then a new philosophical

mind, their roots go back to a more ancient world. In this field, the parallel studies of African and Indian ethnographic sources by some New or Beha vioral archaeologists may be of some importance,36 especially when combi ned with the studies of African scholars, whose relations to the world from which they started their life is much more intimate. Mircea Eliade's and Jung's studies of symbols and the symbolonics of B . Nuska, besides some principles used in children's psychology, can be useful, but we have to bear in mind that the symbols stemmed from an earlier age than Iron Age Greeks and their neighbours. The abstract Geometric language was only a short phase in Greek art. The meaning of the ornamental abstract motifs was not only less fixed than e.g. with the Egyptians, but their meaning also changed in different contexts. They also went out of use soon: with the advent of pictorial representative art, the Geometric symbols became second-rate signs for most of the users (cf. below p. 119).38
One of the tasks of early Greek art was to restore the order of things, the order between man and the universe. A n ideal example of magical artistic re-creation of the world is Achilles' shield,39 but it already shows repre sentations mainly unknown to the earlier phases of the Geometric art. In our present approach, we have to respect two general rules. The first of them is that the really sacred symbols are rarely depicted in applied art, and that their common frequency usually means loss of their meaning, thendescent to the level of folklore beliefs in their beneficent function, to witch craft etc. The second rule concerns Greece in particular. A s W . Burkert has shown for the Greek borrowing of Oriental myths and as it has long been known for Archaic Greek art, the ancient Greeks were eager to absorb foreign impulses so rapidly into their own culture that they soon became graecisized almost beyond recognition. We must also bear in mind that Greek Geometric religion is a new synthesis of three different elements: the Myce

The rosettes have an old tradition in Aegean Bronze Age art, and they may often have the meaning of flowers, more specifically flowers from the Tree of L i f e . 4 1 Sometimes we even have the Tree of Life itself, notably in Late Geometric times, or perhaps two trees, one of Life and the other of Wisdom, as we know from several oriental traditions. Here the inspiration may be mainly Oriental, though we also know this in Celtic and Nordic mythologies (notably Ydraggsil) and from India.42 Sometimes, however, the rosette becomes a solar symbol, especially in its more abstract varieties, and this is the domain where European influence seems to be predominant (cf. above, p. 107 - 8), though parallel meaning is also known from the Persian tradition.43

They often mark the sun or the Solar Hero, as in the Urnfield symbolism or in Thrace.44 The swastika and multiple swastika were solar symbols in probably all Indoeuropean cultures. O n Protogeometric shield rings, the swastika alter nates with a dotted rosette of similar meaning. O n painted Geometric potteries, it also seems to be the sign of the solar hero and of the sun. The wheel had a solar meaning since the Late Mycenaean times (Fig. 5 ) 4 5 O f the animals, the sun hero (or the solar symbol) is flanked or accompa nied with birds or horses. Birds are more significant in earlier times, and this religious koine with representations of birds includes also Cyprus and the Philistines.46 Later in Geometric art the Pferdefuhrer (Fig. 6) may have represented both the solar divinity and Poseidon, but the solar connotations more often appear. The bird askoi, known from Late Mycenaean Greece, Crete and Cyprus, also belong to this koine of symbolic representations

pottery, when plastic breast-like pro trusions were not used, and there are many parallels to it in Urnfield and Hallstatt pottery styles from various parts of Europe: here they usually symbolize the Mother Goddess (Fig. 9 ) . 4 8 This goddess later became mainly Aphrodite i n Greece, as the Solar Hero's function went to Apollo, and some part of it also to Zeus, while Helios remained a worshipped deity only in Rhodes.49 But other nations apparently used other names for them.

Not only is the cyclic repetition of the evoluti on/involution rhythm broken into separate units with clear individual centres. The semicircles show only one half of the cycle, the lower being invisible (sometimes also, with pendent semicircles, the upper one, but this is rarer). The centre is often marked by a double axe, the former symbol of power of the Cretan and Mycenaean Great Goddess, later a royal symbol at the Macedonian court (Fig. 10).

influence was hardly immediate, in a more general sense, he may be right. These ornaments, though having several different meanings, gave protection by benevolent forces to all objects, on which they were applied. Another ornament into which the old spiral changed is the meander. The meander is an angular spiral, its translation accentuating sharp changes from one direction of the line to another at right angles (Fig. 11). In other terms, the sign of a fluent evolution/involution cycle changed to strongly accentua ted rhythmic alteration. A more sophisticated stage of space organisation is reached, a phenomenon paralleled in the tests used in children psychology: the shift from curvilinear to angular drawings with small children means a more sophisticated degree of abstract thinking.

In a way, later Mycenaean art and already the Palatial Style in Knossos were the first steps away from a flowing curvilinear (spiraliform) structural system to the new one with its axial symmetry and more static fixing. Late Mycenaean art then developed the field-and-frame structure of zones, mo dest predecessors of the triglyph-metope spacing system of Geometric art, and it also started the path towards another construction of pottery shape, consisting of different rather independent parts (as against the Cretan one with body and accessories). These tendencies first became apparent in L H III A 2/B 1, but the first accomplishment of these principles, in their yet halfconscious, though freshly minted new artistic language, brought the Proto

geometric style. It was developed in Athens, a community which now took over from the East Peloponnesian centres the leading position in artistic creativity. The two amphoras destined to contain male and female cremations, neck-handled and belly-handled, are, in a way, abstract translations of the laws of human proportions into an artistic idiom (Fig. 12) . 5 2 In general, it is an old idea to consider vessels being like human beings, but the Protogeometric style for the first time clearly articulated the zones according to Geometric principles similar to those applied to the human body: thus this geometric structure became conscious. A similar rhythmic structure also developed from observed laws of the space is the vertical division into fields and frames or, more properly, into triglyphs and metopes.54 The geometry of Geometric art reflects the more abstract way of thought observed in the previous parts of this paper. It is not without interest that the structural systems used in Middle and Late Geometric art find parallels in the structure of the I l i a d . 5 5 The abandoning of the Geometric abstract idioms first in Greek and Etruscan art, and later also with their more northerly European neighbours, brought as a result their loss of significance, but this development started already by their common use in applied arts, which caused gradually a stepwise loss of their originally sacred meaning, their profanation (cf. above p. 115 f.). But the acceptance of the representational art based on Oriental models, the rise of Greek and Etruscan Orientalizing art, made them to folklore ornaments with only slight memory of their beneficent or apotropaic function on a level comparable with that of the ornamental motifs used in modern folklore art.
Conclusions
The coming of the Age of Iron with its changes of the human mind meant an important threshold also for the history of the religion. The new philo sophical mind needed new means for transmitting religious messages. M u c h of the old wisdom had to be translated into the language of philosophy from the earlier sapiential wisdom and also, as one of my teachers, Prof. Jindf ich Cadik, used to say, the advents stage of Christianity started not only with the

O l d Testament prophets, but also with Greek philosophers. K . Schefold nicely developed this idea for the later period of Greek art,56 but here we tried to look at its very beginnings, the arche of this path starting chro nologically roughly with the exodus of Moses and his folk and with the end of the Mycenaean civilisation, and reaching its first maturity with the Greek philosophy and sophisticated representational art in Greece, and also with the Jewish prophets. Among the Greek contributions for preparing the acceptance of Christianity, at least the humanisation of the gods and the teaching of the logos should be mentioned here. A s any achievement i n human history, the preparation of the new age was, however, not only the work of its two protagonists. Among the minor roles, without whose parti cipation the task could not be accomplished, were other nations, both from Near East and from Europe.

Rane fecke nabozenstvi a pocatek doby zelezne
Pfechod od doby bronzove k dobS zelezne znamena mimo jine i vyznamny pfedel v dejinach nabozenstvi ve starem Recku i v okolnich oblastech. Proti uctivani chthonickych bozstev, spojenych s plodnosti zeme, zvifat i lidskeho pokoleni, se dostavaji do popfedi bozstva spojena se sluncem a s oblohou, at' uzjde zpocatku o Achnatonovu nezdafenou reformu v Egypte, ci o situaci v praveke Evrope. V Recku je tento vyvoj reflektovan jednak posunem k olympskemu nabozenstvi, ve kterem stal na cele pantheonu Zeus, jednak nabozenstvim apollinskym a dionysovskym: oba tito novi bohov6 meli vladu nikoli uz tak nad pfirodnimi silami, jako spise nad urcitymi strankami lidske duse. I Mojzisovo zalozeni starozakonniho nabozenstvi patfi zhruba do teze doby. Spolei!nym rysem nabozenskych hnuti na pfechodu od doby bronzove k dobe zelezne je nejen pokrocilejsi abstrakce v pojeti bozskeho sveta, ale take osobnejsi reflexe nabozenskych principu, dana novou emancipaci lidske inividuality, soucasnou s pocatkem doby zelezne.
