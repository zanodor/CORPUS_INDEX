Sirius: The Dog Star
June 29, 2014 by admin
Sirius, also known as the Dog Star, α Canis Majoris (Alpha Canis
Majoris), or Canicula, is the single brightest star in the night sky.
It lies at a distance of 8.60 light years (2.64 parsecs) from Earth, in
the constellation Canis Major, the Greater Dog. Sirius is not the
brightest star because it is more luminous than other visible stars,
but because it is located so close to the solar system. It is the fifth
closest star system to Earth and contains two of the eight nearest
stars to Earth.
Sirius is slowly moving closer to Earth and will gradually increase in
brightness over the next 60,000 years, before it starts to recede. It
will, however, remain the brightest star seen from Earth for the next
210,000 years.
Sirius has an apparent magnitude of -1.46, which makes it almost
twice as bright as Canopus, the second brightest star in the sky,
located in Carina constellation.
It is, however, significantly less luminous than Canopus, Rigel, and
many other bright stars that lie at greater distances.
The name Sirius (pronounced /ˈsɪriəs/) comes from the Latin Sīrius,
which is derived from the Greek Σείριος (Seirios), meaning
“scorcher” or “glowing.” The starʼs other name, the Dog Star, has
similar connotations.
In ancient times, the Dog Starʼs heliacal rising marked the flooding of
the Nile in Egypt, while the Greeks associated it with the “dog days”

of summer, referring to the
period from July 3 to August
11, when the star rises in
conjunction with the Sun.
The heliacal rising is the first
rising of a star (or a planet, a
constellation, or the Moon)
over the eastern horizon just
before sunrise after a period
when the star had not been
visible. Every day after the
heliacal rising, the star rises a bit earlier and is visible for a little
longer before dawn.
STAR SYSTEM
Alpha Canis Majoris appears as a single star to the naked eye, but it
is really a binary star system, composed of a white main sequence
star belonging to the spectral class A1 V, known as Sirius A or Alpha
Canis Majoris A, and a dim white dwarf with the stellar classification
DA2, designated Sirius B or Alpha Canis Majoris B.
The two white stars orbit each other with a period of 50.1 years and
an average separation roughly 20 times the distance from the Earth
to the Sun.
The distance between the two stars in the binary system varies from
8.2 to 31.5 astronomical units. The angular separation between them
varies from 3 to 11 seconds of arc.
At the closest approach every 50 years, Sirius A and Sirius B can



An X-ray image of the Sirius star system located 8.6 light years from Earth. This image shows two sources and a spike-like pattern due to the support structure for the transmission grating. The bright source is Sirius B, a white dwarf star that has a surface temperature of about 25,000 degrees Celsius which produces very low energy X-rays. The dim source at the position of Sirius A – a normal star more than twice as massive as the Sun – may be due to ultraviolet radiation from Sirius A leaking through the filter on the detector. In contrast, Sirius A is the brightest star in the northern sky when viewed with an optical telescope, while Sirius B is 10,000 times dimmer. Because the two stars are so close together Sirius B escaped detection until 1862 when Alvan Clark discovered it while testing one of the best optical telescopes in the world at that time.

only be resolved with a 12
inch telescope in good
viewing conditions. As the
two stars approach each
other, huge magnetic storms
are created between them
and both stars start to spin
faster as a result of tidal
forces getting stronger.
The primary component,
Sirius A, is roughly twice as
massive as the Sun and 25
times more luminous. It has
an estimated surface
temperature of 9,940 K.
Sirius B is 10,000 times less
luminous, but a brighter X-ray
source of the two. It orbits
around the primary
component in a wide
horizontal ellipse when
observed from Earth. The star
has an estimated surface
temperature of 25,200 K. It is the nearest known white dwarf.
Sirius A is classified as an Am star because studies of the starʼs
spectrum have revealed deep metallic absorption lines, suggesting a
significant presence of elements heavier than helium, like iron. The
star has 316% of the proportion of iron found in the atmosphere of
our Sun.



This picture is an artistʼs impression showing how the binary star system of Sirius A and its diminutive blue companion, Sirius B, might appear to an interstellar visitor. The large, bluish-white star Sirius A dominates the scene, while Sirius B is the small but very hot and blue white-dwarf star on the right. The two stars revolve around each other every 50 years. White dwarfs are the leftover remnants of stars similar to our Sun. The Sirius system, only 8.6 light-years from Earth, is the fifth closest stellar system known. Sirius B is faint because of its tiny size. Its diameter is only 7,500 miles (about 12 thousand kilometres), slightly smaller than the size of our Earth. The Sirius system is so close to Earth that most of the familiar constellations would have nearly the same appearance as in our own sky. In this rendition, we see in the background the three bright stars that make up the Summer Triangle: Altair, Deneb, and Vega. Altair is the white dot above Sirius A; Deneb is the dot to the upper right; and Vega lies below Sirius B. But there is one unfamiliar addition to the constellations: our
The estimated age of the system is between 200 and 300 million
years. The Sirius system originally consisted of two bright blue stars.
Alpha Canis Majoris B was the more massive one, with roughly 5
solar masses, but then it consumed its resources and evolved into a
red giant before expelling its outer shell and becoming a white dwarf
some 120 million years ago.
Sirius B has a mass almost
equal to the Sun, 0.98 solar
masses, which makes it one
of the more massive white
dwarfs known. However, the
starʼs mass is concentrated
into a volume comparable to
that of the Earth. Sirius B has
a almost the diameter of our
planet, 12,000 kilometres, or
7,500 miles. The starʼs
diameter was measured in
2005 using the Hubble Space
Telescope.
The binary companion was
discovered by the German
astronomer Friedrich Bessel,
who deduced that the star
had an unseen companion
from the changes in the
proper motion of the main
component.

first to observe the dim
companion on January 31,
1862. He used the largest
refracting lens avaiable at the
time and spotted the star while testing an 18.5-inch refractor for
Dearborn University. The companion, Sirius B, is sometimes referred
to by its nickname, the Pup.
The Alpha Canis Majoris system may have a very small third
component, but its existence has never been confirmed. If the star
does exist, it has a mass of only 0.06 solar masses and completes an
orbit around the main component every six years. Its existence is
only indicated by some orbital irregularities in the star system.
Walter Sydney Adams was the
first to discover that Sirius B was
a white star. He used a 60-inch
reflector at Mount Wilson
Observatory and, while
observing the starʼs spectrum,
he concluded that it was a
whitish star. Astronomers later
determined that the star was a
white dwarf, only the second one
to be discovered.
In 2005, data from the Hubble
Space Telescope helped
astronomers determine that Sirius B has almost the diameter of the
Earth, around 12,000 kilometres or 7,500 miles, and a mass 98
percent that of the Sun. This was the first time that astronomers
were able to accurately measure the mass of Sirius B.

FACTS
The earliest recorded use of the name Sirius dates from the 7th
century, when the Greek poet Hesiod mentioned the star in his
didactic poem Works and Days.
Sirius has more than 50
names and designations
attached to it. In medieval
astrolabes from western
Europe it is called Alhabor.
This is the name Geoffrey
Chaucer used in his Treatise
on the Astrolabe, with the star
depicted as a dogʼs head.
In Scandinavian countries, the star has been known as Lokiʼs torch,
or Lokabrenna, which literally means “burning done by Loki.”
The only objects in the sky brighter than Sirius are the Moon, Venus,
Jupiter, and occasionally Mercury and Mars.
Sirius was one of the stars that led Edmond Halley to the discovery
of proper motion among the so-called “fixed” stars. In 1718, Halley
compared contemporary data to the information provided in
Ptolemyʼs Almagest and found that the bright stars Aldebaran in
Taurus, Arcturus in Boötes and Sirius had moved significantly over
the period of 1,800 years. Sirius had progressed 30 arc minutes to
the south since Ptolemyʼs times.
Sirius was the first star to have its velocity measured. In 1868, Sir
William Huggins wrongly presumed that the star was receding from



The Winter Triangle: Procyon (top left), Betelgeuse (top right), Sirius (base). Image: Hubble European Space Agency, credit: Akira Fujii
the Sun at roughly 40 km/s, but his conclusion is notable for
introducing the study of radial velocities of stars. Sirius is really
moving toward the solar system at 7.6 km/s.
Along with the bright stars
Procyon in Canis Minor and
Betelgeuse in Orion
constellation, Sirius forms the
Winter Triangle, a familiar
asterism in the night sky, and
easy to spot in winter
evenings in the northern
hemisphere.
Procyon, Alpha Canis Minoris,
is the nearest large
neighbouring star to Sirius,
located 5.24 light years away in the constellation Canis Minor.
The Voyager 2 spacecraft, which was launched in 1977 to study the
Jovian planets in our system, will pass within 4.3 light years of Sirius
in about 296,000 years – assuming the spacecraft is still around.
(One light year is almost 10 trillion kilometres, or 6 trillion miles.)
At one point, Sirius was thought to be a member of the Ursa Major
Moving Group, an association of stars including most of the brighest
stars in Ursa Major constellation, that share a common origin and
proper motion through space. In 1909, Ejnar Hertzsprung was the
first to suggest this after observing the star systemʼs movements
across the sky. It wasnʼt until 2003 and 2005 that analyses revealed
this to be unlikely. The stars in the Ursa Major Moving Group were
roughly 500 million years old and Sirius is about half this age, and
therefore too young to belong to the association.

Alpha Canis Majoris may instead belong to the Sirius Supercluster, a
proposed supercluster that includes the stars Beta Aurigae in Auriga
constellation, Alpha Coronae Borealis in Corona Borealis, Beta
Crateris in Crater, Beta Eridani in Eridanus, and Beta Serpentis in
Serpens.
The diameter of the primary
star, Sirius A, was first
measured by Robert Hanbury
Brown and Richard Q. Twiss
at Jodrell Bank in 1959.
The first spectrum of Sirius B
was obtained at Mount Wilson
Observatory in 1920. The first
photograph of the companion was taken by Dr. Irving W. Lendenblad
of the U.S. Naval Observatory in 1970.
The colour of Sirius has caused some debate over the centuries, as a
number of ancient accounts indicated that the star was red. The
Greek astronomer Ptolemy was one of the many who described its
appearance as reddish. Around the year 150 AD, he mentioned the
starʼs reddish colour, including it with five other stars that are all
known to be either red or orange: Antares in Scorpius constellation,
Arcturus in Boötes, Betelgeuse in Orion, Aldebaran in Taurus, and
Pollux in Gemini. Seneca, too, had noted that Sirius was of a deeper
red colour than Mars. However, at the same time, there were many
observers who described the star as blue or white.
While it is possible that observers could have been describing the
star as it appears when it is close to the horizon, with its colour
affected by the Earthʼs atmosphere, there has not been a single
conclusive explanation for the discrepancy ever since the issue of



Siriusʼ colour first got serious attention at the Royal Society way back
in 1760.
Siriusʼ flickering and colour changes, which have prompted some
observers to report UFO sightings, can be explained by the fact that
the star often appears low in the sky in northern latitudes and its
light passes through a long column of air in our atmosphere and is
affected by changes in the airʼs temperature and density before it
reaches observers. Sirius is not the only star affected by this
phenomenon, but the changes in colour are more noticeable
because the star is so bright and often appears near the horizon.
MYTHOLOGY AND CULTURE
In ancient Egypt, Sirius was known as Sopdet (Greek: Σῶθις, or
Sothis). Sothis was identified with Isis, the goddess who was part of
the triad with her husband Osiris and son Horus. The hieroglyph for
Sothis has a star and a triangle.
Egyptians based their calendar on the heliacal rising of Sirius in the
era of the Middle Kingdom. The starʼs rising marked the beginning of
the new year and the event was celebrated with a festival known as
“The Coming of Sopdet.”
The day Sirius became visible just before dawn after moving far
enough away from the Sun to not be lost in the Sunʼs glare signalled
the flooding of the Nile every year. This would happen just before the
summer solstice and the star would be visible before sunrise after
being absent from the skies for about 70 days.
The 70-day absence symbolised Isis and Osirisʼ passing through the
Egyptian underworld, the Duat. The flooding of the Nile brought
fertility to the land when the star appeared, and Egyptians
associated Isis with both the inundation, fertility and the new year.



Sirius and Canis Major constellation
They called Sirius the Nile Star.
The Egyptians believed that Sirius
caused the floods and they noted
that the starʼs heliacal rising
occurred every 365.25 days rather
than 365 days. The correction in
the length of the calendar year was
eventually incorporated in the
Julian calendar.
The Egyptians also saw Sirius as
the doorway to the afterlife and
would not bury their dead during the 70 days the star was hidden
from view – the 35 days before and after Sirius conjuncted the Sun.
They believed the doorway was closed when the star was out of
view.
Several occult researchers believe that the Great Pyramid of Giza
was constructed in perfect alignment with stars, particularly with
Sirius and the three stars of the Orionʼs Belt. Recent findings related
to the pyramidʼs mysterious air shafts have strengthened the theory
of Siriusʼ importance to Egyptians.
The Greeks noticed that the starʼs appearance in the sky heralded
the hot, dry summer season. Sirius was known to twinkle more in the
early summer and the Greeks interpreted this as a malignant
influence. The star was often described as “burning” in various texts,
and the season it heralded became known as the dog days of
summer.
On the island of Ceos, inhabitants would offer sacrifices to Zeus and
Sirius to bring cooling breezes and, if Sirius rose clear, they would
see this as a sign of good fortune. If the star was faint or misty, it



foretold pestilence. Archaeologists found coins on the island dating
from the 3rd century BC that featured dogs and stars with
emanating rays.
The Romans, similarly, celebrated the starʼs heliacal rising around
April 25, and would sacrifice a dog and a sheep to the goddess
Robigo in the hope that the star would not cause wheat rust on their
crops that year. They called the hottest days of the summer dies
caniculares and Sirius was known as Canicula, or “little dog.”
The star is associated with dogs in a number of cultures. Being the
brightest star in the Greater Dog constellation, it was classically
represented as one of the dogs of Orion, the Hunter. Homer calls the
star “Orionʼs Dog” in The Iliad. In ancient Greece, there was a belief
that the star could make dogs behave abnormally during the
summer.
The Chinese knew Sirius as the star of the “celestial wolf.” In anicent
times, they visualised the constellations Puppis and Canis Major as a
large bow and arrow, with the arrow tip pointed at the wolf.
Ancient Polynesians used Sirius for navigation, and saw it as part of
the Great Bird constellation called Manu. The bright star Canopus in
Carina marked the southern wingtip and Procyon in Canis Minor the
northern one. The constellation divided the sky into two
hemispheres, and the stars were used as latitude markers. The
declination of Sirius matches the latitude of Fiji at 17°S, which means
that the star passes directly over the islands every night.
To the Māori, the star marked the beginning of the winter season.
They had the same name to describe both the star and the season:
Takurua.
In Hawaii, Sirius was known as Kaʼulua, or the Queen of Heaven. The



starʼs culmination at the winter solstice was celebrated with an event
every year.
In India, the star is sometimes known as Svana, the dog of Prince
Yudhistira, who set out of a long journey to find the kingdom of
heaven with his four brothers. The journey was a difficult one and,
one by one, the brothers abandoned the search. When Yudhistira
reached the gates of heaven, Lord Indra welcomed him, but would
not let Svana enter. The prince told him that he himself would not
enter if his faithful servant was denied entrance. This is what the
Lord wanted to hear, and he then allowed them both through the
gates.
In Sanskrit, the star is known as Mrgavyadha, or “deer hunter,”
representing Rudra (Shiva), or as Lubdhaka, meaning “hunter.”
In Persian mythology and Zoroastrianism, Sirius is seen as Tishtrya
and revered as the divinity bringing rain and fertility.
Sirius is mentioned in the Qurʼan, where it is called the Mighty Star or
Leader. The starʼs other proper name, Aschere, is derived from
Arabic.
Many indigenous peoples of North America associated Sirius with
figures of dogs and wolves. The Blackfoot knew the star as “Dog
face,” Pawnee tribes of Nebraska called it the “Wolf Star” or “Coyote
Star,” and the Cherokee saw Sirius and Antares in Scorpius
constellation as dog-star guardians of the two ends of the Path of
Souls. The Alaskan Inuit knew Sirius as “Moon Dog.”
The Dogon people in Mali in West Africa reported to have knowledge
about Sirius that would be impossible without using telescopes.
Based on information revealed in the French anthropologist Marcel
Griauleʼs books Conversations with Ogotemmêli and The Pale Fox,



the Dogon were familiar with the starʼs 50-year orbital period and
knew it was a binary star before western astronomers did. They also
refer to a second companion, the third star in the system, which
accompanies Sirius A and B.
To add to the controversy, Robert Templeʼs book The Sirius Mystery,
published in 1976, claims that the Dogon knew about the rings of
Saturn and the four Galilean moons of Jupiter. Temple speculates
that the Dogons, an ancient tribe who have worshipped Sirius for the
past 5,000 years, had a direct connection with beings from Sirius.
In a Dogon myth explaining the origin of the human race, humanity
was born from the Nommo, a race of amphibians who came to Earth
from a planet orbiting Sirius. The Nommo are said to have given
humans profound knowledge, including information about Sirius and
our own solar system.
LOCATION
Sirius can be seen from any location on Earth south of 73°N.
However, from locations that are further to the north, but south of
73°N, the star doesnʼt rise very high above the horizon. For
observers south of 73°S, Sirius is circumpolar: it never sets below
the horizon.
As a result of precession, Alpha Canis Majoris will move further south
and, in the year 9,000, it will not be visible from most locations in
northern and central Europe. In the year 14,000, when Vega takes
over as the pole star, Sirius will be found at declination -67° and
never set below the horizon for observers in South Africa and in most
parts of Australia.
The easiest way to locate Sirius in the night sky is by using the stars
of the Orionʼs Belt as pointers. The three bright belt stars – Alnilam,



Orionʼs Belt and Sirius
Alnitak, and Mintaka, point downward
to Sirius to the left. Sirius is about 8
times as far from the Orionʼs Belt as
the belt is wide.
For most observers in northern
latitudes, Sirius lies in the southeast,
south, or southwest sky in the
evenings from winter to mid-spring.
The star can also be seen rising in the
east before dawn in the late summer.
