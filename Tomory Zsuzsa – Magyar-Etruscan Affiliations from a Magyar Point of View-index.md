Magyar-Etruscan Affiliations from a Magyar Point of View, part 1
Professor Mario Alinei is a linguist, who has been a member and
President of the International Society for Dialectology and
Geolinguistics for seven years. He is also a member of seven
linguistics related – academies and societies and the founder of
Societa Linguistica Italiana. He has written several books and over
200 articles within his chosen field. Among these the Origini delle
lingue d’Europe (two volumes) and the Etrusco: Una forma arcaica di
ungherese, (the Magyar title: Ősi kapocs, A magyar-etruszk
nyelvrokonság) are of great significance to the above subject and they
also help broaden the present frontiers of linguistics.
Professor Alinei has written an extra foreword to the Hungarian
edition of his book, not only to make the Etruscan subject more
familiar to the Hungarian readers but also to make it more familial,
similar to the familial connection of the Italian readers toward the
Etruscan culture. This separate foreword emphasizes the following:
1. He presumes that the Etruscan subject is far removed from the
Hungarian reader, since Hungarian universities do not have an
Etruscan department and consequently a sense of family could not
develop.
2. Geographically speaking, the Etruscan origin from the Carpathian
Basin can be considered proven fact.
3. He stated that “Of course the Carpathian Basin’s Danube people are
not yet Magyars.”



4. According to the continuity theory, the Uralian peoples were
already present in Paleolithic times in the Eastern parts of Europe
during the last Ice Age, which he dates to 13,000 B.C. The Eastern
most group of all these “Finno-Ugrian” people were the Magyars and
he designates the banks of the river Ob as their homeland at this time.
5. “...the present spread of the Ural languages completely corresponds
with our theory” states the author. The only exception is the
Magyar...
6. “...separated from the rest of the Ugor peoples before the period of
final settlements in order to occupy the Carpathian Basin.”
7. With a giant leap, Dr. Alinei lands at the Magyar arrival in the
Carpathian Basin and the much debated question of the “double
occupancy” represented by the Avar arrival prior to the Home
coming[1] of Árpád’s people.
8. Prof. Alinei stresses two theories of continuity in today’s scholarship
in order to understand the Paleolithic cultures. The one, which he and
Hungarian researchers favor, is the Uralian theory, the other is the
Indo-European and Altaic continuity and he suggests the following
Internet address for further reading: www.continuitas.com
9. According to the Indo-European and Altaic continuity, the Indo
European population was indigenous to the greater part of Europe and
the Indo-European parts of Asia, while the Altaic people were
indigenous to Central Asia.
10. According to Professor Alinei, the combination of the above
mentioned two theories of continuity makes a new theory feasible,
which also helps to prove that the Magyars are the ancestors of the
Etruscans.



11. According to the Altaic theory, the Turkish and Mongolian people
have lived since the Paleolithic Age in Central Asia, where the great
cultures belonged to the Altaic languages and also those first nomadic
horsemen appeared in 4,000 B.C. on the Western steppes of Asia and
in Europe.
12. Prof. Alinei emphasizes the great importance of using the horse as
mode of transportation and also the development of the kurgan
cultures, most of which belonged to the Altaic peoples and must have
belonged to the Turkish language group.
13. According to Prof. Alinei, all Hungarian readers know what great
influence the Turkish language had on the Magyar. He mentions the
following:
a. All the words pertaining to the horse and riding in the Magyar
language are of Turkish origin.
b. These words correspond to the words of the Obi-Ugor languages.
c. Other Turkish (mainly Chuvas) loanwords concerning agriculture,
societal and political expressions do not correspond with the Obi-Ugor
expressions. (Italics are mine. S.T.)
14. He comes to the following conclusions from the contents of the
above (a-c) points:
a. The Magyar and the Obi-Ugor languages were unified in Western
Asia in the fourth and third centuries B.C.
b. When the Magyars separated from the Obi-Ugors they came under
Turkish influence again.
c. The Magyars arrived in 3,000 B.C. in the Carpathian Basin and their
role in the formation of the Villanova and Etruscan cultures is



undeniable.
d. The Magyar influence is present in both types of incoming people,
whether they arrived on land or by the sea-routes.
e. There may have been further connections with the Sea-People. The
official Hungarian scholarship acknowledges these Sea-People as the
Magyars of 2,000 B.C.
f. One of these is the famous Tursha group, who fought with the
Egyptians. The Lemnos inscriptions make this supposition even more
plausible.
15. Researchers of the Latin language state that the two Latin names
of the Etruscans, Tusci and Etrusci originate from the Greek Tyrsenoi.
Prof. Alinei poses the following question: could all these names be
connected with the Turkish name Turchi? Or is it possible that this
name precedes the long line of Altaic or Turkish tribal names which
were given to the Magyars during the course of history: Magyars,
Avars, Turks, Bashkirians, Huns, which are all of Altaic origins?
Prof. Alinei places the birth of the ancient Magyars, “who are believed
to be a Turkish people” to the Bronze Age, when the spread of
population was helped by the growing industrial development of the
Carpathian Basin.
16. Professor Alinei has based his research on the results of Massino
Pallottino’s hermeneutic/combinatory method, which examines the
internal structure of the language. Prof. Alinei uses these results, but
he also goes a step further when he compares the Etruscan language
with other languages.
According to Etruscologists, this language is



a. agglutinative
b. it places the emphasis onto the first vowel, like the Magyar and the
other Uralian languages.
c. vowel harmony is present
d. it uses exclusively aphonic occlusive consonants
e. This language is characterized by an open syllable structure, which
is connected with a syllable ending with a vowel.
Professor Alinei’s foreword brings many thoughts to the forefront,
concerning the Magyar and Etruscan languages, which he discusses on
the following 500 pages. Since he is not familiar with the Magyar
language and the Magyar culture, the elucidation of these thoughts
can be accomplished only by a similarly extensive work. My present
article is designed to outline the road toward a fuller understanding
and some points of contact.
Before I begin this, I have to point out the anti-Magyar activities of the
Hungarian Academy of Science (MTA), which are not fully realized in
the scientific circles outside of Hungary. Beginning with the Hapsburg
domination of Hungary, there has been an ongoing cultural and
linguistic genocide, combined with efforts of material ruination, even
in our days, which do not shy away from the use of any weapon. This
knowledge will be useful mostly to the scientific circles outside of
Hungary and the newly educated young Hungarian scientists and the
non-professional but interested citizens who don’t have the tools to
realize these machinations. Their research – by necessity – is based
upon false information and has to be reevaluated.
*



It is noticeable, even in the first lines of Professor Alinei’s
introduction, how much Magyar history and, through it, the
consciousness of the entire nation has been violated through the
above-mentioned Hapsburg oppression, whose spirit still holds the
nation captive. This trend strove to eradicate all Hungary’s historical
memories and her right to exist in Europe. This effort disseminated
and perpetuated false historical data to the unsuspecting foreign or
young Hungarian researchers, so they based their works on false
premises. For this reason, impartial researchers were unable to
achieve correct results. This trend was especially strong in the 19th
century, marked by the fact that the Hungarian Academy of Science -
which was founded by Count István Széchenyi to serve the elevation
of the national language and culture – became the puppet of
Hapsburg tyranny, so much so that the founder of this institution
withdrew his intellectual and material support from it in an official
document.
All the Academy’s officials were placed forcibly into their respective
positions by the Hapsburg regime. They represented a foreign spirit
and were the tools of Hungary’s destruction. For example:
Emperor Franz Joseph’s distinguished accomplice was Armin
Wamberger. His historical views moved within the limits of reality
until he was invited to a dinner by the Emperor. After this, he began to
preach the Asiatic origin of the Hungarians and explained the arrival
of Prince Árpád in the 9th century as the arrival of the entire
Hungarian nation.[2] His work and the works of similar “scholars”
was the equivalent of a cultural Tatar-destruction.
The MTA’s influence, or let us state clearly, the waves of its
unrecognized falsification of history, left its mark on the work of
Professor Alinei, this very objective Italian researcher. Whenever he
talks about the Magyar past, the Magyar history, he relies on



suppositions, possibilities, when there are masses of accurate linguistic
and cultural data available among the works of scholars who were out
of the favor of the MTA.
The above statement – falsification of history – seems rather strong.
An episode brings the validity of this statement closer to the reader.
Historian. Géza Radics, in his book Eredetünk és őshazánk (page 19)
documents the following: Komoróczy, Géza, head of the Hebrew
department of the ELTE (Eötvös Lóránt Tudomány Egyetem) held a
lecture in Chicago August 22, 1981. He began his lecture with the
following statement to summarize his view dealing with the works of
linguists, concerning the Sumerian-Magyar connection: „A sumér
magyar rokonság kérdése akkor se érdekelne, ha bizonyítva lenne”
(Translation: I would not be interested in the question of the
Sumerian-Hungarian relationship even if it were proven.) Ecce the
“impartiality” of the official Hungarian Academia under the leadership
of the MTA, which is still the elevated instrument of a long past
Hapsburg regime, which paved the road of both the Drang nach Osten
Germanic expansionism and the Slavic spread toward the West.
I would like to discuss some of Professor Alinei’s introductory
statements, followed by some samples of his word-comparisons. The
thorough examination of his excellent work requires an equally
thoughtful and extensive work, which will follow at a later date.
I bring Professor Alinei’s remarks in italics. They are not a verbatim
quotation since the Italian original is not within reach. The remarks in
the preceding lines, written in the usual manner, are mine.
ad.1.
The Etruscan subject is far from the Magyar reader, since the Hungarian
universities do not have an Etruscan department and, for this reason,



there never developed a “familial” connection.
Even though the “official” scholarship distanced itself from the
Etruscan subject and all the other languages – which come under the
title Uralian today –, many selfless scientists worked to fill this gap
with no outside help.
Adorján Magyar researched the Etruscan language and has written a
book in the Italian language about the subject. This book was
published in Italy in the 1930’s or early forties. He discussed three
Italian dialects as the clearest remnants of the Etruscan language. In
his Az ősműveltség (translation: The Ancient Culture), he organized the
connection between the ancient Magyar and the Etruscan language. I
will discuss these later.
Dr. Zsigmond Varga, Professor of Ancient Near Eastern languages,
discussed in his works the structure and connections of these ancient
languages, especially the Sumerian. His observations may be of value
in researching the Etruscan connections.
Rev. Géza Kur was a Hungarian minister living in the USA, who spent
his years researching the Etruscan-Magyar connection. His works – by
necessity – focused on grave inscriptions, which were more readily
available to him. It is to be feared that his life-work will be lost.
Historian, Dr. Tibor Baráth, researched the monosyllabic Magyar
words. Even though he focused on the Sumerian and Egyptian
languages, several of the word elements he mentioned in his work,
The Ancient Hungarians – which is an abbreviated version of his six
volume Hungarian work of the same title – are connected with the
development of the Etruscan language. I am thinking here of the
language development and language changes of the migrating people
after the Ice Age.



Rev. Zoltán nagyernyei Szabó – having been a missionary for years in
North Africa – constructed a five-language dictionary of these
languages and their connection with the Magyar language. This
dictionary may be a guide toward the further connections of the
Etruscan language.
H. Zebisch, who lives in the city of Schärding in Bavaria and is an
engineer by profession, studied the Etruscan language and published a
book concerning this subject. He also held a lecture at the MTA,
concerning the agglutinative aspect of both the Etruscan and the
Magyar. The MTA did not support his efforts and used the well
developed weapon of silence and ridicule concerning his work.
Árpád Orbán’s work, Folio Hungarica, Déli magyar őshaza, az új délies,
sokszöges, poligonális szórokonítási rendszer és diadalútja (translation:
Folio Hungarica, the Southern Hungarian Ancient Home and the New
Polygonal Linguistic Method in Word Comparisons) researched the
languages in the following groups:
a. Magyar, Slavic, Latin, German
b. Sumerian, Akkadian
c. Ancient Greek, Ancient Turk
d. Present day classifications
He completed his research at the Sorbonne University in the early
days of computerizations. His research shows that the English
language contains 4% ancient etymons, the Latin 5%, the now extinct
Ancient Turk 25%, the Magyar 68%.
The summary of his book states the following: “The III. Volume of our
book and its theses takes into account the new polygonal, complex



method of research and its further connections with the many subjects
that touch other branches of science, which were also left out or were
modified in almost their entirety by the imperialist HAPSBURG line,
who were in power for over one hundred years and these
(researchers) could not rid themselves from the elevated emotional
spirit and prejudices like Halévy’s Bible research. The multitude of
these more than conservative “professionals” was frequently led by
foreign interests.
On page 103 of his book, he discusses the Altaic connections of the
Magyar language and its treatment in the “Northern line” of
scholarship. Some examples:
According to linguist Géza Bárczy the Magyar language is of Chuvas
character. He cannot understand the Iranian influence, which
occurred at the same time... The Onogurs are the ancestors of the
Magyars. “Trained in the Turkish school (co-existence) the Magyars
reached the higher levels of nomadic culture.”
Péter Hajdu, linguist:
“Very carefully, we may say only that the transmitting tribes of the
Turkish loanwords of the Ugor age cannot be identified historically.”
Concerning the Turkish loanwords, Orbán states the following on page
109:
“The 150-200 years of the Kazár age and its ‘Turkish-type leadership’,
which became elevated in the Magyar ancient life by the Northern school,
are not enough to adopt the 200-300 Turkish type words which are
acknowledged by this school. As we have seen, even the ancient layers of
the Magyar language show a settled, agricultural people with developed
societal structure, with well-developed literate and law related culture
words. These words are more numerous than all the so-called Turkish



style words the Northern school permits as loan-words in the Magyar
language. This vocabulary by the way is not the accessory of a nomadic
people! If for no other reason, we have to consider the Northern School of
linguistics and ancient history as unscientific.”
ad.2.
Geographically one can consider the Etruscan origin from the Carpathian
Basin as proven.
ad.3.
“Of course the Carpathian Basin and Danube people are not yet
Magyars.”
All the linguistic, archeological, ethnographical and other cultural
heritage of the ancient population of the Carpathian Basin proves the
ancient presence of the Magyars here.
In the field of archaeology and anthropology, I will mention here only
the excavations at Bodrogköz[3], where the remains in the 6000 year
old graves were of the same Rh negative blood-type as the present day
inhabitants. The excavations in the same 6000 year-old strata at
Vésztő-Mágor show a continuous habitation, through the Avar age to
the present. The profile of the 6000 year-old statue shows the same
features as those of the present inhabitants.
In the evolutionary layers of the European languages we can observe
that the Magyar language was always the transmitter until these
ancient words blossomed into the great variety of cultural words. I
would like to refer here again to the afore-mentioned article of
Adorján Magyar but he listed thousands of similar word-groups and
their spread into other languages in his The Ancient Culture (Az
ősműveltség).



In the field of material culture, I feel it is important to mention the
ancient site of Ohábaponor, Erdély (Transylvania), with good quality
Mousterian-type stone tools with a great variety of animal remains,
among which – it is important to mention from our subject’s point of
view – we find the evolutionary traces of the ancient horse: the cold
blooded ancient horse (equus aff.Abeli Ant.) and the medium-sized
ancient horse (equus ferus fossilis Pall). In other Transylvanian sites,
huge quantities of decorative elements can be found and the complete
lack of arms is striking. It is also from Transylvania where the Sicul
peoples’ favorite decorative elements began to migrate, first to the
Aegean islands and later found their way into the Etruscan and Celtic
cultures.
ad. 4.
According to Professor Alinei’s theory of the Stone Age continuity, the
Ural people were already present in Eastern Europe in Paleolithic times,
during the last Ice Age, which he places into the timeline of 13,000 B.C.
According to him, the eastern-most part of these “Finno-Ugrian” people
was the Magyar and he places their territory at the river Ob.
Not one example can be found within the history of Mankind’s
cultural development that could place the Magyars to the East. Every
sign points to the Magyar presence–from the most ancient times on–in
the Carpathian Basin. The deeper we probe into time, the closer we
come in place to the Carpathian Basin and the Magyars’ ancient
presence there. I am attaching as Appendix 2 a table taken from my
book Kezdeteink (Our beginnings) showing our continued presence in
the Carpathian Basin.
The best measure of a people’s cultural development is the presence
and the advanced state of its writing system. The Magyar literacy is
proven by the Tatárlaka tablets from 7,000 B.C. Their ancient



characters translate into Magyar text[4]. These tablets were found in
situ which prove their origin in the Carpathian Basin. Zsófia Torma
found 10,387 clay tablets in Tordos, Transylvania. These are 4,500
years old. She identified 4 Székely-Magyar rovás (runic) signs, which
later research extended to nine easily- identifiable characters. All
these early beginnings took on their final form in the Székely-Magyar
rovás (runic writing). The structure of the signs for numbers shows
that the Etruscan people were the first heirs – with some minor
changes – of this system of numerical rovás.
The Latin heirs of this script did not recognize its internal structure,
which was completely destroyed in their hands (Appendix no. 5). We
have to add to the history of the Magyar rovás that, when – under
papal guidance – the Hungarian King István ordered these “pagan”
writings destroyed, Székely (Sicul) people living in the mountains,
separate from the rest of society, continued to use this script and
preserved it to our day. Considering that it was not the well-educated
people but the people of the lower rungs of the societal ladder, who
preserved this writing, it becomes clear that in Magyar society there
were no illiterate people from ancient times on.
I also have to mention that, if we speak of any cultural aspect of
people, may that be the language, writing, folksongs, ethnic art – and
we may continue ad infinitum, -- the origin of these cultural products
goes back thousands of years. The unbelievable richness of the
Magyar language and the perfection of its ancient script indicate a
society, which lived a peaceful and settled life for thousands of years.
Considering that the ancient layer of the Magyar language can
frequently be found in the European languages, this proves the central
position of the Hungarian language and homeland. For this reason we
have to recognize the pre-Villanovan language as a language which
originated from the Magyar language. At this point article 2. can be



proven linguistically too and also the fact that the Magyar culture was
already present in the Carpathian Basin before the Bronze Age.
In order to establish the linguistic validation of this statement, it is
necessary to re-evaluate the methods of present day linguistics and to
bring to the forefront the Magyar word-root structure which is already
being re-evaluated by several Magyar linguists. The inherent value of
the system of nature-words and cultural-words in language
transmission was worked out by Adorján Magyar, who stressed that
the base of any culture-word is a nature-word. If two languages share
a culture-word the transmitter of this word is the language where its
nature-word base exists, and the other language, where the nature
word does not exist, is the borrower. He explains this with the word
root Kő (stone) and its culture-word derivatives as they appear in
different European languages. (See Appendix 4)
The so-called “talking statues” are also a form of early literacy. Here I
will discuss the Tűzköves statue, which has the following message:
The statue shows a man sitting on a chair (szék). His face is wedge
shaped (ék). He holds a sickle (szike) on his shoulder. His clothing is
decorated with wedge-shaped (ék) lines. All these syllables spell the
word Székely (Sicul), the name of one of the Magyar ethnic groups of
4,500 B.C.
We tend to forget that a long time is required for language formation.
The extended vocabulary of a language signals its age and the ages
upon which its formation depends. Stacked libraries contain the
necessary materials to prove this thesis. The Magyar language is well
equipped to express everything beginning from its ancient one-vowel
word[5] for ancient to the specific concepts of our modern age. Non
Magyar linguists, who know this language, bow in admiration to its
qualities:



The Italian linguist Mezzofanti, who spoke over fifty languages and
knew the Magyar language perfectly, stated the following: “The
Magyars are not even aware what treasure lies in their
language.”[6]The famous man of letters and diplomat, Sir John
Bowring, was the first to translate the gems of Magyar folk poetry into
English. There are several quotations of his statements. For a full
review of Sir John Bowring’s Hungarian connections, see the article by
Zsolt Bánhegyi, chief of the MTA Library’s computer department, on
http://www.matud.iif.hu/04apr/08.html You will find a widely
circulated quotation you will find in Appendix 7.
In the following I am bringing the quotation found by Dr. József
Végvári:
„The Magyar language stands afar-off and alone. The study of other
tongues will be found of exceedingly little use towards its right
understanding. It is moulded in a form essentially its own, and its
construction and composition may be safely referred to an epoch when
most of the living tongues of Europe either had no existence, or no
influence on the Hungarian region.” (Preface vi.)*
“It is this much and it is not little” says Professor Végvári as he
continues: “From the Introduction that follows (Introduction p. iv) we
learn for example that Bowring was fully aware of one of the basic
characteristics of the Magyar language: the system of radicals and
word-clusters which is still known by only a few linguists. Moreover:
he was the first in the world to publish in print the Magyar folk poetry.
Bowring’s work was studied and published by Aurél Varannai – as far
as he was able to -- since regrettably the Bowring material presently
cannot be accessed.” (Debrecen, November 23. 1997. Dr. József
Végvári.)
Maybe the presently inaccessible material contains the widely



circulated Bowring quotation of Appendix 7? Who knows? Future
Magyar researchers may have a chance to clear up this question. Here
I have to mention that the still unpublished linguistic works of the
great Magyar linguist, Sándor Körösi Csoma,[7] reside under lock and
key in the Library of the British Museum.
The study of a young Magyar computer-scientist states that the full
richness of the Magyar vocabulary can be expressed only in
astronomical numbers.
From an anthropological point of view, the Carpathian Basin is the
only territory, which was able to provide such a continuous, peaceful
environment. Prof. Evan Hadingham, expert on the European Ice Age,
stated that the population of Central Europe achieved a high degree of
human evolution independently from other influences.[8] Later he
clarifies the exact location of this “Central Europe” and he places it in
the Danube Valley, between the cities of Érd and Tata in Hungary.
Sagas of the origin of the Magyars mention the island of Csallóköz
which is near the places Prof. Hadingham mentioned – as the land of
their birth, where the memory of mankind’s Golden Age is preserved
here in the territory of the Danube. Modern archaeology supports
their statements.
According to Greek legends, Heracles seized the Tree of Life from the
land of the Danube and planted it into Greek soil.
Sumerian lore tells us that the wood for the bed of the Sumerian
Inanna arrived also from the Danube to the Fertile Crescent.
Sanudo’s 15th century map shows the exact place of these activities:
he drew the Island of Csallóköz to a size covering almost all of Europe
in order to emphasize its importance in the development of human
culture.



ad. 5.
“...the present spread of the Uralian language fully supports the
suppositions of our theory” says Prof. Alinei and he adds that the only
exception is the Magyar, who
ad. 6.
“...separated itself from the rest of the Ugrian stock during the years of
non-permanent settlements, in order to occupy the Carpathian Basin.”
The Magyars – who were cited as the only exception – could not have
separated from the rest of the Ugrian stock at an age of impermanent
settlements, since we can readily perceive that they were the
indigenous inhabitants of the Carpathian Basin. The only possible
appearance of Magyars at this given time comes from some of the
Magyar groups who migrated out of the Carpathian Basin because of
problems of overpopulation there, or simply to explore different lands.
The ethnic components and the routes of these wandering groups can
be accurately charted by following the appearance of their very
specific word-groups in lands outside the Carpathian Basin. The
presence of such migrating groups can be found in the developing
Sumerian, Egyptian and Etruscan cultures, to mention only the most
well known.
Our linguistic contact with the Sumerian language was researched by
Dr. Zsigmond Varga, Professor of Ancient Near Eastern languages. His
work was continued by Dr. Ida Bobula; her work was supported by
Professor Deimel. Presently Dr. Ágnes Gyárfás and Dr. Veronika
Marton carry forward this work.
Here I need to add the recently published work of Ágnes Buró, (née
Benedekfy), entitled: Egy titokzatos nép holt (?) nyelve: AZ ETRUSZK
(Translation: A mysterious people’s dead (?) language: The Etruscan.)



The book was published with the help of Dr. Ágnes Gyárfás, Director
of the Nagy Lajos University of Miskolc (full title: Miskolci Bölcsész
Egyesület, Nagy Lajos Király Magánegyeteme). Mrs. Buró utilizes
research into the Etruscan language and re-evaluates some of the
Etruscan characters. With this help, she is able to reconstruct these
ancient texts, which thus become understandable in the Magyar
language.
The Carpathian origin of the Magyar language and culture was
studied by Prof. Grover S. Krantz, Professor of Anthropology at the
Washington University. He organized the basic components of cultural
and linguistic spread, first within the American Indian cultures, then
he turned his attention to Europe. He found twelve language-groups,
from which he originated the European languages we know today. He
placed the birth of European languages in pre-Mesolithic times, with
the Carpathian Basin as its center.[9]
In his Geographical Development of European Languages, he recognizes
the Magyar language, – which until now was considered and treated
as Europe’s stepchild – as the base of European culture. According to
his theory, the Indo-European languages developed very late in time in
Europe and, for this reason, 30% of these languages indicate another,
non-European origin. For example, he shows that, on the early maps
of Europe, there are no Indo-European river names. We are interested
in the following:
“The unexpected conclusions here are mainly in the area of increased
antiquity ascribed to the original Indo-European dispersion itself, and in
the longer residence indicated for some of its subdivisions in their present
locations. This would include, for example, developing Greek in its
present area since 6500 BC., and Celtic in Ireland since 3500 BC. The
antiquity of Magyar in Hungary may be equally surprising: I find it
to be a Mesolithic speech that predates the Neolithic entry.”



And a little later:
“In at least one major instance the commonly assumed direction of
migration of population is reversed here. It is usually stated, that
the Uralic Magyars moved into Hungary from an eastern source in
the 9th century A.D. I find instead that all the other Uralic
speakers expanded out of Hungary in the opposite direction, and at
a much earlier date.”
According to Krantz, the network of dialects of different regions is
understandable to people living in close proximity to one another. This
situation changes according to the distances placed between them. He
believes that 10,000 years ago Europe and the Near East was one
linguistic network. This view coincides with the one held by the
Hungarian historian Dr. Tibor Baráth.
Professor Krantz’s theory accepts the theory of great migrations, only
as far they become necessary to counter overpopulation. According to
him, every nation was born and lived its life, achieved nationhood on
lands where they presently reside en masse. Adorján Magyar – who
spoke eight languages and was very familiar with the Magyar
ethnography, music and culture in general -- stated similarly, nearly a
hundred years ago, that every product of a culture remains alive the
longest in its place of origin. The root of cultures that seem to have
disappeared from the stage of history is still recognizable in their
place of origin: in the Magyar language and culture of the Carpathian
Basin.[10]
Traces of this ancient language can be found worldwide and the
geographic names of distant continents even carry the formative role
of this ancient language. The thousands of these geographic names
were charted by Dr. Bátor Vámos Tóth and his work-group.
The presence of the Magyar language at such an extensive



geographic spread going into ancient times is the proof of a once
unified world-language of which the longest surviving remnant is
the Magyar.
ad. 7.
The “debated question” of the Magyar conquest, or the double
conquest...”
The above debated question of conquest by Prince Árpád’s people can
easily be solved by taking into consideration the frequent return to the
homeland of people who left the Carpathian Basin in more ancient
times. The “debated double conquest” refers to the returning groups
of the Avar-Magyar people. Géza Radics’s works extensively deal with
these returns and the ethnicity of the Carpathian Basin. We may count
the present return of the 1956 refugees to Hungary – who left due to
unbearable pressure of history in those years -- as such an occasion,
even though on a miniature scale.
Ad. 8. and 9.
Up to these points the theories of Turkish coexistence, the connection
with Asia rest upon chains of supposition only.
ad. 10.
According to Professor Alinei the combination of the two theories of
continuity will make room for a new theory, which will help to prove
that the Magyars are the ancestors of the Etruscans.
The linguistic, and other cultural traces of the ancient Magyar
presence in the Carpathian Basin will make the early connections of
the Magyar and Etruscan culture clear.

According to the Altaic theory, the Turkish and Mongolian people were
already in Central Asia beginning with the Paleolithic, where “not only
the great cultures belonged to the Altaic language group, but also those
first nomadic horsemen and their people who lived in the 4th c. B.C. on
the Western steppes of Asia and in Europe.”
The development of culture and literacy is possible only under
peaceful, settled conditions. If the Magyars had led a horse-riding,
fighting, nomadic life, we could not talk – for example – of Etruscan
Magyar relationships, of which the most illuminating aspect is the
transmission of writing.[11]
ad. 12.
The most representative aspect of this age is the employment of the horse
for riding and the formation of the kurgan cultures, most of which had
to belong to the Altaic people and the Turkish language group.
This thesis rests only upon suppositions. The so-called Turkish
relationship I shall discuss in a later section.
ad. 13.
According to Professor Alinei, all Hungarian readers are aware of the
great influence the Turkish language had upon the Magyar language. He
mentions the following examples:
a. All Magyar words pertaining to the horse and to riding are of Turkish
origin.
b. These expressions are the same as their Ob-Ugrian counterparts.
c. All the other Turkish (primarily Chuvas) loanwords pertaining to
agriculture, society, and politics do not show a relationship with the Ob
Ugrian languages.



I quoted in the preceding part of this study Gosztonyi’s research in
connection with the Turkish influence, according to which – I have to
add – the supposed length of time of the Turkish-Magyar coexistence
was not enough to form any significant linguistic connection. I also
have to mention that the linguistic dictionaries, prepared under the
guidance of the MTA, very openly strive to derive every Magyar word
from a foreign tongue. Such an example is the Magyar csizma (boot)
which – according to the MTA – is a Turkish loanword; the only
problem here is that the Turks never wore boots but slippers and so
they had to invent a word in ancient times so that they could loan it to
the horse-riding, boot-sporting Magyars in one of the coming
centuries.
The Slavic loan words of these MTA inspired dictionaries – which in
reality belong to the most ancient mono-consonantal group of Magyar
words – can be found only in Slavic territories which neighbor
Hungary but are absent in the great Eastern expanses of Slavic
languages. This sheds a completely different light onto the direction of
word-transmission. There are no Turkish,-- foremost Chuvas and Ob
Ugrian – so-called loan-words mentioned in Prof. Alinei’s book. It will
be easy for later researchers to clarify this matter. Prof. Dr. László
Marácz is presently researching the question of “official” loanwords in
the Magyar language.
ad. 14.
The above three theses resulted in the following answers:
d. The Magyar and the Ob-Ugrian languages were unified in Western
Asia in the 3rd. and 4th c. B.C.
e. When the Magyars separated from the Ob-Ugrians they came under
Turkish influence again.



f. The Magyars arrived in the Carpathian Basin in 3,000 B.C. and their
role in the formation of the ancient Villanovans and Etruscans is beyond
doubt.
g. The Magyars were present in the over-land and over-sea arriving
population.
h. Further contact could have taken place during the contact with the
Sea People. These “Sea-People” are recognized as Magyars by the official
Hungarian scholarship too and they place them in the II. millennium
B.C.
i. One such famous “Sea-People” is the Tursha group who fought with the
Egyptians. The Lemnos inscriptions show that such a meeting was
probable.
The 14th point again shows us the Magyars, struggling between the
Ob-Ugors and the Turks. He places their arrival in the Carpathian
Basin in the 3rd millennium B.C., which is a very late date if we take
into consideration the time needed to develop language and literacy.
The Magyars had their own script in 7,000 B.C. in the Carpathian
Basin and its beginnings lead us into a great antiquity.
According to Professor Alinei’s thesis, the Magyar and Ob-Ugor
languages were unified in Western Asia in the 4th and 3rd millennium
B.C. This supposition can be accepted only as far as later research will
prove the presence of Magyars there, and who were the remnants of a
once migrating group coming from the Carpathian Basin.
The Magyar connection with the Sea People never reached the
consciousness of the common people and never became a subject of
history in Hungarian schools. Independent researchers show which
Magyar ethnic groups can be counted among the “Sea People”, among
which I will mention now only the most obvious – the Ias and Pannon



people.
ad. 15.
Professor Alinei mentions that the two names for the Etruscans – the
Tusci and Etrusci – originated from the Greek Tyrsenoi. He also poses the
question: could one attach all these names to the name “Turchi” or
“Turk”? “In other words could it precede the long line of Altaic or
Turkish names, which the Magyars gave during the course of
centuries”: Magyar, Avar, Turk, Baskir and Hun, all of which are of
Altaic origin?
He places the birth of “the Turkish people believed to be ancient
Magyars” in the Bronze Age, when the increase of industry in the
Carpathian Basin facilitated the expansion of population.
I shall discuss in detail the Tusci, Tyrsenoi, etc. names of the Etruscans
in the forthcoming linguistic section, first Professor Alinei’s theory
concerning the first appearance of these names and later the basic
linguistic layer of these names.
He places the birth of “The ancient Magyars believed to be Turkish
people” in the Bronze Age, when industry facilitated their expansion.
The flourishing of an industry depends upon the settled state of the
supporting society. Concerning the metal industry we know that all
“Metal-ages” (gold, copper, bronze, iron and their alloys) began in the
Carpathian Basin in Europe[12]. The basic words for metals and their
finished products rest upon Magyar root-words.
*
SOME BASIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MAGYAR LANGUAGE.
The “official” Hungarian science of linguistics never researched the



basic characteristics of the Magyar language, which are different from
the characteristics of the Indo-European languages. Its comparative
studies relating to word origins are still following the first insecure
linguistic steps of the 19th century and for this reason they prevented
the linguistic communities of the world from finding their way more
safely to their own beginnings. I discuss these specific Magyar
linguistic phenomena in my work: Organic Magyar Linguistics.[13] In
my present article I will bring up the origin of a few words mentioned
in Professor Alinei’s book and their specifically Magyar properties.
The first one to mention is the Magyar word-root system, which is the
reflection of the thought patterns of a given ethnicity and their
expression. Adorján Magyar recognized 16 such linguistic units, each
of which expressed its particular cultic vocabulary pertaining to God,
Life and sustenance within a closed consonantal unit within the
Magyar language.
A few of these units:
Name Consonants God’s name Symbol Sungod Name of Man
Magyar G, GY, H – M, N Ég Mag Magúr Magyar
Szemere S,Sz,Z,Zs,C,Cs-M,N Ős, Ur Szem Szemúr Szemere
Kun K – N, T Ék Kő Kund Kun
Jász J – S, SZ, Z, ZS, C, CS Jó Jázmin Jós Jász
Őstörök T, D – R, L Ur Turka Tor, Török Turkán,
Marmar M, N – R, L Ar Márna Mord Marmar
I have to explain here that the above names are only the basic
components of the names and vocabulary of the ancient ethnic groups



and a great many concepts and names belong to each of these groups.
I also have to emphasize that all these linguistic groups – I may call
them consonantal groups also but then I would leave out the essence
of language development – belong within the unity of the Magyar
culture and language, beginning at an age when only God and his
man appeared on the stage of history. These groups, during their later
stage of development, became parts of the newly forming nations.
Sometimes, a newly formed nation kept the name of its most
influential ethnic component but these cannot be equated with the
name of nations who live today within a political unit under one
of these ethnic names. More closely: The ancient Török or Turuk
ethnic group undoubtedly played a large part in the formation of
today’s Turkey and the Turkish language, but this was not its only
component. The Turks of whom Constantine Porphyrogenitus wrote in
his De Imperio were a part of the still living ancient Turuk-Magyar
(and not Turkish) language group, which still spoke the ancient Turuk
(Turk) dialect of the Magyar language. This fact is not recognized by
today’s Hungarian linguists, but was well recognized by Constantine.
The Turuk emissary visiting his land was Tormás, whose name also
belonged to the same T-R word-group of the Magyar language.
These consonantal linguistic roots can be found in every language
of the world. Our question needs to be the following: which
ancient groups formed the language and culture of a certain
people and in what percent? Most often we find the influence of the
agricultural Szemere Sz-M consonantal group, which unwittingly
supports Professor Krantz’s theory, in which he discusses that the
agricultural people had the greatest role in the expansions of cultures,
since they had the most surplus in grain and other goods. It was this
group that can be found even at great distances from the Carpathian
Basin. Settlements close to the Carpathian Basin could be formed by
fewer participants and resources. In the case of the Etruscan



civilization, the ancient Török group’s spread was such.
Professor Alinei’s theory, in connection with the ancient name of the
Etruscans, is correct and it can be led back to this T-R Turuk word
group.
We also have to mention the system of reciprocity in the Magyar
language, which expresses the masculine/feminine concepts, or the
relationship of force and matter through reciprocity. All Magyar
ancient consonantal groups used this method, except the ancient
Turuk, which signaled with vowels the masculine (a, o, u) and the
feminine (á, é). In languages that borrowed these words, the use of
these vowels and the concept behind them become obscured and are
frequently incorrect. The word tér (space) designates a two
dimensional, the word tár (to open wide) a three dimensional concept
which is also present in the line of the speaker’s mouth as one
pronounces these: pronouncing the first (tér) we draw our lips
horizontally, in the case of the second (tár), we have to open it wide
thus there is an organic connection between concept and sound
formation.
The Őstörök (Ancient Turkic) and the Szemere groups were part of
the culture we call today Sumerian. Oppert counted them among the
Scythians. The Őstörök (Ancient Turkic) dialect left its mark in the
Sumerian language, such as in the name of the city of Ur, which they
founded. There are several bull/turka decorations in this region. The
decoration of a music box shows Ur-opa (Father Ur) between two
bulls (turka)[14].
In Hungary they marked their presence in the following geographic
names: the river Tur, Turján, Durján, (these words mean raised earthen
structures), Túróc, Túrkeve, Dorog, Dorozsma, in Szatmár county
Túrvékonya, Túrmező (its Croatian name is Turopolje).



The Tűrings of Tűringia are from the Őstörök (Ancient Turkic) group.
The Turinheim, Turingheim place names also preserved their memory.
Dürkheim (in Bavaria), the crest of the city shows a pair of bull-horns
(tulokszarv) in a mirror-image position.
Tyrol’s name is akin to the turul word (this is the symbolic bird of the
Magyars). Its crest shows an eagle, the Turul.
Trento is south of Tyrol. In Roman times it was called Tridentum.
The Etruscans who moved between Switzerland and Italy left the
following place names:
Raetia (a segment of Switzerland which included Tyrol), whose
inhabitants were believed to be Etruscans. The Magyar word rét
designates a matriarchal branch of the Őstörök (Ancient Turkic)
group. In Raetia, the Etruscan language was still spoken in the 2nd
century A.D.[15]
Razenna’s name is also matriarchal. According to Adorján Magyar’s
research, the base of today’s Rétoromán, Ladins and Furlán dialects is
Etruscan. Razenna also carries the name of the symbolic flower of the
Őstörök (Ancient Turkic) group, which is the rózsa (rose), which leads
back in its reciprocal form to the word sár = light, shine.
Turusk was a variation of the Etruscan name. The „isk” ending here is
the equivalent of today’s Magyar “i” meaning “from” and it is known
from history, like:
Falisk = from Italy
Avarisk = from Pannonia
Nordisk = Germanic



The German equivalent of this “isk” is “isch” (Ungarisch, etc.), in the
Slavic languages it is the –szki, –icki, –szko, –szka suffix.
Torino, or Turin, in Roman times Taurinum, or Taurasia, shows a bull
(turka) in its crest.
Troy – This city’s architecture emphasizes the bull-horn designs (turka
tülkös). The cities of Torja and Torda in Hungary belong to the same
word-group. The word “torja” means rotation. The founder of Troy
was Dardanos and his name belongs also in this T-R word-group. The
Roman Emperor, Diocletianus, founded Dardania in Transylvania.[16]
The reciprocal of the Etruscan Goddess Turán, Tezan is rét, retenna,
razenna which is also the Etruscans’ own name. I recognize, as the
earliest representation of the Goddess Turan, the Venus of Lausel,
which is a 35,000 year-old relief, on which a female form holds a bull
horn (turka tülök) in her uplifted right hand. It was at this same time,
that bovines became numerous in this region, states the scientist who
researched this region.[17] The text of the famous Etruscan bronze
mirror also mentions the Goddess Tezan, who is identical with Turán.
[18]
The knowledge of copper (réz) is at the base of this T-R dialect.
The Italians call the Etruscans Toscano, Tosco and Tusco. There are
variations of Torkán, Torko, Turko, Török and today’s Turkish are also
called Turco.
The Latin word terra belongs into this word-group and it is the word
of the Őstörök (Ancient Turkic) tér, tár – meaning a circle returning
within itself.
Rutennu – the Assyrians fought with these people.



Ruténs – this name with which they designate themselves is also of
Őstörök (Ancient Turkic) origin.
Turuk people are mentioned in the Assyrian cuneiforms.
Rotennu people and a Ruten country is remembered in Syria by
Egyptian historians.
The common denominator of all these names is the Őstörök (Ancient
Turkic) T-R word-root.
The Etruscans were remembered as Tyrsenoi, which is based upon the
same linguistic base as the Goddesses Turán and Tezán and their name
is remembered in the name of the Tyrrhenian Sea and Tuscany.
The softened T-L words are also part of this T-R word-group.
Ell, elleni (to birth) is connected with birth and a watery beginning
(lé=liquid), and the word lét (existence) belongs here too, along with
– some change in meaning -- the Latin river Lete. In Magyar, the words
lőre, lötty, etc. carry the meaning of watery environments, where ladik
(boat) is the vehicle of travel on water.
In Asia Minor, the country, Lydia and the nation, Líd still have a purely
Turkish population, which echoes their connection with the Őstörök
(Ancient Turkic) people. Professor Alinei mentions Herodotus in
connection with the Etruscans who arrived from Lydia under the
leadership of Tyrsenos. All these names are part of the Őstörök
(Ancient) Turkic T-R word-group.
Today, the ancient Sun-deities are remembered as national heroes.
One of these is the Estonian Toll. Here father and son are called by the
same name, which already shows a deterioration of the ancient
language and the concept behind it. The Father, the Old God’s name is



always mono-consonantal and so it must have been Ol in ancient
times. It is very probable that words for antiquity, of age like the
German alt, the English old, were derived from this name. The bi
consonantal name Toll was the name of the Sun-, or Son-god.
The legend of William Tell originated in the Uri canton of Switzerland,
which is still famous for its cows and cattle (turka).
The Magyar Miklós Toldi was once a Sun-God figure.
The above Sun-deities had one thing in common: they all carried a
huge rod or some other poking instrument, or weapon which was the
symbol of their male strength.
After this short introduction I will discuss some of the linguistic details
of Professor Alinei’s work. I am going to begin with some words that
belong to the ancient nature-words, keeping in mind the scope of this
paper and this will be followed by some cultural words mentioned by
him. Concerning the latter, I have to emphasize again that by the time
a nation reaches the higher societal standards and the names of
officers upholding these functions become standardized, several
thousand years have to elapse. If the people, whom Professor Alinei
mentions as Villanovans from the Carpathian Basin, inherited these
words from the inhabitants of the Carpathian Basin, then these had to
be Magyars in culture and language. For this reason, the statement of
paragraph 3: “Of course the Carpathian Basin and Danube people are
not yet Magyars” is not only questionable but should be rejected.
Page 40.
5.1. RASNA: “tartomány, terület” (territory)
In his interpretation of this word, the author mentions the following
words: határ, terület and tartomány (border, territory). He equates



these with the Magyar word rész, which means part of something and
also carries the meaning of a piece, a dose of something.
We may add to this Rasna, the Etruscan Tarkste, meaning market
place, which later became the name-giver of Trieste, a city south of
Retia, whose old name was Tergeste, Tergesta which – correctly
should have been Tarkaste to avoid the accumulation of consonants.
All these words and names of settlements belong into the T-R word
group and, under certain circumstances, they are the reciprocal forms
of one another (Tergeste – Retia).
The word affiliations of the word root rész are the following:
Tér, tár, words of femininity, always denote territory and the capability
to encompass, to enfold, to receive and are always expressed – as
mentioned before – with high vowels. The words határ, terület and
tartomány (border, territory) rest upon this base along with the words
terem, terület (a hall, territory).
The words rét, rész (meadow, part of something) are the reciprocals of
the word tér. The túr, tűr, tor elements are the masculine variation of
these and mean strength and motion.[19]
Page 42
5.2. MEX: it is the name the Etruscans called themselves.
I would like to call attention -- before discussing anything else -- to the
fact that the Etruscans refer to themselves by the same name Mag as
the Magyars use to refer to themselves, even though outsiders
recognize this nation only by the name Hungarian. This name, which
shines through the mists of history, is of prime importance.
It is an equally important fact that they used their own name Mag in



conjunction with their ethnic T-R word-group’s Turuk or Őstörök
(Ancient Turkic) name and identity, which is clearly present in their
later names and their language, and all the “outsiders” called them by
this ethnic name. They still recognized themselves as Mag, just as all
the Magyar ethnic groups still call themselves by their ethnic name
within the Magyar culture: Székely-Magyars, Palóc-Magyars, etc. So if
we want to call the Etruscans by their correct name, we need to bring
their ethnicity within the Magyar culture to the forefront and call
them Turuk-Magyars, Őstörök-Magyars. We owe great gratitude to
Professor Alinei for focusing our attention on the Mag name of the
Etruscans. After this introduction let us see Professor Alinei’s further
deductions:
“The first part of the magyar/mager word-combination, the mag-/meg
is no longer present in the Magyar language, unless we consider
the form mese (in this form it is present in other Ugric languages).”
says Professor Alinei. It is very hard to resist the temptation to grab
the word mese (story, fiction) and turn the researcher’s attention
toward the MTA. At the same time, he accepts the word meχ as
Magyar but, as far as its origin is concerned, he turns toward the word
mansi and handles it as “the only Ugor word.” There are a great many
examples of the Mag name in antiquity: on the Aegean islands,
Heracles was known as Makar and Mag, the Phoenicians called their
God who thought them agriculture Mag.
Earlier we already met the base of the word mag, which is still alive
and going strong and which belongs to the Magyar M-G consonantal
group. Its origins can be led to the following mono-consonantal
ancient forms:
Ég the name of God. It is still used in the expression “Ég áldjon” , may
God bless you!



ég to burn, which is also part of our metabolism.
egy one. It is also a name of God
egyed individual as a part of God
ige the word of God
igaz truth, light
agg very old
Ok cause. It is also another name of God.
etc....
When the M sound of materiality is attached to the above, we get:
mag seed, the base of the earthly life
Magor the Lord of the Seed, the Sun, which was considered a mag.
Magyar the child of Mag-úr or Magor,
megye land of the Magyars
megyer a symbol of the Sun (in the palóc dialect it is called pálca,
etc.)
meggy sour-cherry, a round, one seeded fruit, which is also a Sun
symbol.
Ancient Kun vocabulary:
Mén the name of God
mén stallion, the symbol of the ever wandering Moon. The German



Mond, the English Moon and the Italian mendicare take their origin
from here.
menés to walk
mony symbol of the masculine
monno archaic one
manó man
manyó old woman
menyecske young woman
etc....
The above mentioned mese belongs into the Sz-M vocabulary of the
agricultural Szemere. At this point – due to the limited scope of this
paper -- I am unable to discuss this word-group but it is important to
mention that the spread of this word-group and ethnic component of
the Magyar culture can be found almost everywhere.
I would also like to mention that the base of the words kom, kum is
the Ancient Kun K-N word-group’s word kan which means a universal
masculinity.
The words er, ar mean strength and therefore masculinity in the
ancient Magyar vocabulary.



Magyar-Etruscan Affiliations from a Magyar Point of View, part 2
We find, under this title, the following sentence: “...In one respect this
could explain the evolution of Etruscans into Magyars...” This turning
into Magyars is a hereditary impossibility, which the Etruscans did not
need, since they were part of the Őstörök (Ancient Turkic) Magyar
group from their birth and they remained Magyars as long as they
preserved this ancient heritage. The sense of belonging to the Magyar
culture may have been weakened under foreign influences but was
never completely eradicated. Proof of this is the word meχ in the
previous paragraph, which they maintained as their national name,
and Prof. Alinei considered it Mag.
“The Magyars originated from the Finno-Ugrian branch of the Ural
languages...” The previously mentioned Sir John Bowring was the first
Western European linguist who considered the Magyar language the
ancient root of all languages. His conclusion is supported by
thousands of scientific data (archaeology, ethnography, etc.) The
Mansi, Hangi, Vogul and other languages also originated from here
and all I have mentioned, concerning the Etruscan culture, equally
applies to them too. The mentioned German Lautverschiebung cannot
be used as a base of comparison, since the Magyar sound-structure is
non-existent, or may be present to a limited degree in the language
families that separated from their base a long time ago.[20] The
Magyar vowel-structure is not present in the surrounding Indo
European languages, for example within the T-R word-group, where:
Vowels can indicate the feminine-masculine traits as discussed above.



Vowels can indicate the changes in temperature, like the differences
between cold and glowing hot (with the sound i).
Vowels can indicate the age of something (with the sound ó)
Vowels can indicate the condition of matter before creation (with the
sound a)
Vowels can indicate the condition of matter touched by light. (with
the sound á)
Vowels can indicate space and need (with the sound ű)
The possibilities are endless and I would like to refer the interested
researcher to my Organic Magyar Linguistics. One aspect I would like
to mention: vowels formed mankind’s first, emotional language.
Page 48
2.1 Proofs
In this chapter, Professor Alinei examined the words AIS, EIS and their
derivatives: “isten, istenek”. He correctly recognized that the Magyar
“is” is an ancient form of “ős” (meaning ancient). His further
deduction, that with the passing of time a -t and an -n diminutive
article was attached, thus forming today’s “Isten”, is incorrect from a
historical linguistic point of view. In the Magyar belief system, God
(Isten) had an active, creative role and the Bécsi Kódex (Viennese
Codex) of the early 15th century called Him Tenő.[21] Professor Alinei
presupposes that the word ős must have meant at one time great
grandfather reflected in the Latin, Finnish and Ural languages. Here I
have to mention a Magyar linguistic fact, which does not exist in the
presently accepted, Indo-European based linguistics, according to
which the words of ancient creation are mono-consonantal and “ős”



was the name of this ancestral, eternal (öreg and örök) God. The
concept of ős reflects universality. God as progenitor is connected with
materiality and His name comes from the bi-consonantal vocabulary.
This distinction is already lost in the later languages but it is still
present in the Magyar.
Page 52
ATI “anya”
Professor Alinei connects this word to the concept of sweet (édes). His
view is correct insofar as, in Magyar, the mother is frequently called
édes, but only as an abbreviated form of the édes-anya (sweet mother),
which is still the standard name of mothers. God too is frequently
called Édes Istenem (my sweet God), even though he is the epitome of
masculinity.
Variations of the word édes (sweet):
ét, étel, édi, édes, izes (food, sweet, tasty) and the verb eddegél (to eat
slowly).
One also must note that the Magyar word anya (mother) contains the
ancient vowel “a” and the “n” which are the ancient sounds of matter.
[22] This linguistic rule was already obscured in the receiving
Sumerian language in the name of Anu, who is a male deity.
Page 65
ETA ITA EIT TA etc. “ez”, ETANAL ETNAM ITANIM “igy”.
The author mentions, in connection with the Magyar ez and its
derivatives that, in ancient Magyar, the order of pronouns was
exceptionally rich. A long time is needed for a language to reach such
richness and a stable, peaceful environment is just as important.



According to these linguistic facts the ancient Magyar was a peaceful,
settled agricultural society.
Page 71
LUPU “buried with honor” › (?) “dead person”, LUPUCE “he was
buried with honor”.
Professor Alinei connects the word LUPU to the Sicul Lófő. He believes
that lófő is the name of an ancient name for the Székely nobility and
so he does not expand on this connection. Instead, he brings the
Asiatic burials to the forefront, in which the head of a horse was
placed into the grave and he gives it the meaning halott (dead).
I have the picture of an over 2000-year old Hun burial site in Asia,
where a portrait of the buried Hun shows features identical to those of
the Magyar inhabitants living between the rivers Duna and Tisza and
his grave does not contain horse-remains. So let us see our other
possibilities:
There is a qualitative difference in the Magyar language between the
two words: fő and fej (head). The word fej is a material part of our
body, the word fő moves on to a higher level of ideals (a main theory,
the head of an organization, capital sin, etc.).
The organization of the Székely szék is still a living reality even
though the Székelys cannot actualize its functions, since the Trianon
decree. According to the Székely (Sicul) constitution all Székelys are
noblemen, free of taxes and these privileges do not cease after a
Székely moves to another part of the country: as long he resides
within the limits of the Holy Crown of Hungary, these privileges are
his. The organization of the Székely szék is three-layered and, within
this, the lófő Székelys (primipilus) form a knighthood.[23] The
linguist Mór Ballagi is of similar opinion.[24]



A more ancient interpretation of this title (lófő) leads us back to the
dawn of Magyar history. Arnold Ipolyi[25] connects it with our Táltos
traditions since “...the horse is the miraculous táltos of our legends”
and possesses powers, which are beyond time and space. In the
chapter lófő he also mentions lófi, which is connected with the Kun,
Hun and Székely origin-sagas, which hold that they are the sons of the
White Horse (Fehérló fia), and so the word lófő also sheds light to the
line of descent. I have to mention that, in their symbolism, the moon
was represented by a white horse, which was the symbol of eternal
movement and wandering. At the same time, the moon (hold) was
known as a dead (holt) heavenly body and was occasionally the
symbol of death. At this point we reach Professor Alinei’s conjecture
concerning the idea of death. But the idea of lófő cannot be connected
with the buried head of a horse, since this bloody custom came about
in the recent historical past and was fully unknown among the ancient
Magyars in the Carpathian Basin, where and when this word and
historical background was formed.
In a prayer, dating from the time of the Hungarian King András II., in
which the pagan Vata was cursed, he was mentioned as lófő. So just
as, in Etruria, a lady of high standing was honored by this title, it was
a title of honor in Hungary too.
CULTURAL WORDS
GYULA
Professor Alinei considers this title to be a Turkish loanword. He does
not examine the ancient nature-word base but brings it into affiliation
with the Türk, Turkish-Bulgarian, Besenyő, Baskir cultures, where this
word serves as their tribal names.
According to my research, the word-base of gyula is the ancient
nature-word gyúl (to ignite), according to the conclusions of many



scientists engaged in Magyar studies in the 1930’s, who discussed this
subject exhaustively. Here I quote a section of my study Karácsony
(translation: Christmas)
“The Gyula represented the high priestly office of later years and the
symbol of the office was a bundle of twigs. He was the custodian of
the holy fire. During the reign of the Magyar King István I., they were
considered only as the initiators of household fires but their old honor
went a lot further, as we can see from King István’s Decree 1:9, where
he absolves the Gyula from the mandatory mass on Sundays. In
ancient times, they brought the year’s first fire from the Sun to the
earth with the help of a mirror. The Sun and fire bring warmth to the
Earth as the mirror, which can collect and disperse the rays of the Sun,
brings light. For this reason, the mirror was the symbol of the soul.
The Gyula tended both lights – earthly and spiritual -- and knew that
the two are one. The name of this high office rests upon the verb gyúl
and it is connected with the gulás = guardian and the gúla which
plays part in the fire-symbolism, as does the ancient Persian Ghulab -
the name of a cap which symbolizes flames – and this is the cognomen
of Mythra too. The word deus belongs to this base also and it is this
name by which the Székely (Sicul) people called for God’s help.
Today’s Hungarian linguists hold this statement a misunderstanding
on the scribe’s part, even though it has roots in the vocabulary of light
and fire symbolism. They did so, maybe because it is too evident that
it was not the Magyars but the Latin people who were the ones who
inherited this word from the ancient Magyars. The word gyűl (to
congregate), gyülekezet as a religious congregation belongs into this
word-group. Gyűl is also used for inflammation in one point where
white blood cells accumulate causing heat and redness. The Gyula is
the defender of the family, its judge and leader on the road of
enlightenment. The office of Gyula was a hereditary office of the
descendants of Duke Tuhutum.”[26] “The twig-bundle as the symbol



of the Gyula was connected with burning, with fire and light just as
the similar symbol and the name of the Roman Lictors carry the
concept of light (lux).”
The last vowel of the Gyula is the postpositional use of the Magyar
definite article a.
This word, which was originally connected with spirituality and
enlightenment, became, in the later centuries of societal organization,
the name of a high office and it was taken over by others as such, in
their own vocabulary. Again, we have to remind ourselves that, if the
ancient nature-word base is missing concerning a word in a language,
then this word was borrowed. If this ancient base of the Gyula is
present in – let us say -- the Kazár language, then this language
cannot be counted as a Turkish language, but a Magyar group which
migrated to lands outside the Carpathian Basin.
The office of the Gyula evolved in the following way, according to
Arnold Ipolyi’s research:
At the time of the Árpádian return in the 9th century A.D.:
The high priestly office was held by: Kádár – Rabonbán, or Gyula
supremus.
Below him were three Gyula maiores, or a Horkáz maximus
Under each there were six Gyula minores, or a Horkáz supremus
Under each there were three Rabonbán maiores
Under each of these there were three Horkáz minores
Similarly below them there were five Rabonbán minores.



Under each there were two captains (százados), one equestrian and
one infantryman.[27]
KENDE
This word, signaling an office, is researched by Professor Alinei in its
present culture-word state. He believes that this word “soon became
obsolete, so much so that its phonetic form cannot be determined with
certainty.” He mentions, as a possible surviving element, the Magyar
word kend which he believes to be a Turkish-Tatar loanword.
As always, we have to look for the ancient nature-word base. In the
case of kende it is easy to find the relevant base, which is kan. Its
primary meaning is the universal masculinity and is the same as the
word him (male) in both form and meaning. Both are the reciprocal
forms of the ancient ék (wedge) and all their later forms remained
within this context: the word kan (male) always signals some concept
of movement, pushing forward, a wedge-like entry somewhere. Its
later forms are connected with animals, like the vadkan (boar), where
its wedge-shaped head, its forward movement is emphasized and both
the male and the female can be called by this name. Even later, the
word kan means its gender as a male animal (kan-disznó).
The tender of swine was the kondás (swineherd) and this name goes
back to the undifferentiated meaning and role of male qualities. In
ancient stories, it is always the little kondás who goes on journeys to
distant lands or climbs the tree which reaches heaven. Similarly the
Kun, Hun people fulfilled their destiny through wandering to distant
lands, by forging ahead. The personal name Kont belongs to their
vocabulary and is from this same word-group.
Here are a few examples from Adorján Magyar’s word-list[28]:
Kun/Hun ancient ethnic group:



The name of their chief deity is the hardened version of the mono
consonantal Magyar Ég, which in their dialect became Ék (it means
both wedge, like the rays of the Sun and also shine)
The name of their Sungod was the bi-consonantal Kám, Kán, Kún,
Hun. These names are the reciprocal forms of the Magyar mag (round
kernel), and makk (acorn).
Their religious symbol was the stone (kő) and their wedge-formed
monuments, the menhirs are called kőszeg (stone-nail) in Magyar.
The following people can be counted among them: the Kun, Hun, and
Kani people, (which is the Babilonian name of the Celts) and a long
list of Biblical names and offices, like Khamor, Hámor, Canaan and the
Kuman, Kamán people who were defeated by the Assyrians.
The following names were inherited by the Greeks: Kun, Kiun, Kaun,
Kamor, Kam which are the names of Ares and Mars.
The Egyptians inherited the name Kuen-Aten.
The Japanese inherited the word Kámi – meaning God.
It is also Adorján Magyar, who discusses in detail the language of the
Kuns and concluded, that they spoke Magyar – with slight dialectal
variation – even during the reign of the Hungarian King Béla IV.[29]
This dialectal difference is still present within the population of the
Kúnság. [ [excerpt]
“Kont the hard hero” is well remembered even today. This name
expresses the stone-culture of the Kuns and also his masculine role,
which is one station away from the office of the Kende on the linguistic
and cultural road. According to legend, our hero was so strong that,
with one strike, he cut such a big hole with his spear into the door of



Byzantium that a child’s head was able to fit through; it is clear that
here the story talks about his masculinity garbed in history. In the
mindset of the ancient Magyars, the city was a feminine, the spear a
masculine symbol.
MATERIAL CULTURE
I mentioned earlier that, during the Ohábaponor excavation, the
skeleton of two types of ancient horses were found. In view of this,
the horse was present from the beginnings of its development in the
ancient millennia. The use of the horse and all modes of
transportation must have started on this land. If one takes only this
much into consideration, it is inconceivable that the words connected
with the horse, riding, and riding-gear, boots etc. would be of Turkish
origin. The stirrup (kengyel) is also a Magyar invention, named by its
inventors.
Discover Magazine’s January issue of 1994 (page 37-38) shows an
approximately 17,000 year-old rock-drawing, where a man walks his
horse on a lead. A bone bridle (zabla) from the Aurignacian Age,
found near Dordogne, is decorated with kernels of oat (zab).[30] This
linguistic connection between object, and drawing (zab-zabla) places
the word zabla within the Magyar language.
Among the other objects connected with horsemanship, I mention the
word hám (harness). The origin of this word is an ancient nature
word: it means the outer layer of the skin, or fruit and grasses.
Ballagi’s dictionary talks about leads made of hemp and leather
among the equipment needed for horsemanship.
The word fék (brake) is also counted among the Turkish loanwords,
even though it is the “f” variation of the word “ék” (wedge). The
brake of a wagon is truly a wedge between the wheels, which prevents
their rolling further.



The name of the wagon (kocsi) is of well known Magyar origin and it
was adopted along with the wagon itself by many nations and
languages: the German expresses it as Kutsche, the English as coach.
The clay wagon-model excavated in Budakalász is the first such find
in Europe.[31]
The word nyereg (saddle) may be considered the reciprocal form of
the verb reng, rengő (to rock).
*
It would not be correct to touch Professor Alinei’s work in such a
haphazard manner, if one does not hope to come forward with a
thorough study at a later date and after a lot of research. These
present lines would like to bring to his attention the present state of a
“straight-jacket” situation, imposed by the MTA, as far as Hungarian
research is concerned, regarding the Magyar language and history.
The loosening of its grip is slowly evolving due to the possibilities of
free research and technology in our modern age. One has to express
joy at the recognition that Professor Alinei acknowledged much of this
situation through his impartial research:
He knows that the present state borders within the Carpathian Basin
came about through the Trianon dictate and that these borders are not
the borders of the ancient Magyar cultural sphere.
“...beginning from this simple deduction, the arrival of the Magyars in
the Carpathian Basin in the 9th century or a few centuries earlier (as the
new theory of the “double occupation” – see it later – supposes) is simply
untenable. It is by no accident that Grover S. Krantz and Renfrew,
starting from the theory of Uralic Continuity, recently stated that the
Magyars have been present in the Carpathian Basin on Magyar territory
since Paleolithic times...” “...Or the mirage-like hypothesis (délibáb) of
primitive and nomadic Magyars is for this reason untenable...”



The Magyar river-, and geographic names of the Carpathian Basin and
Europe easily solve the doubts concerning the indigenous population
of the Carpathian Basin.[32]

Adorján Magyar’s letter no. 47. to Susan Tomory
ONE OF THE GREATEST FALSIFICATIONS OF HISTORY
by
ADORJÁN MAGYAR
It is widely held these days that the Magyars came from Asia and that
they wandered as nomads into Europe about 1000 years ago. This is
taught in schools too. This is a newly propagated theory, which is not
supported by even one historical document. The developer of this is,
of course, a non-Magyar person by the name of Herrmann Wamberger,
a writer and oriental traveler. However, because this theory supported
the politics of the Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph, he was not only
invited to Vienna but was also invited to the table of the Emperor as a
beloved guest. This move was not in vain, because – even though
previously he held the opinion that Árpád’s people were Turks – he
began to write a different history after his visit in Vienna. He began to
state that the bulk of the Hungarian people arrived with Árpád, who
was also accompanied by some Finno-Ugric elements. He emphasized
that the “present day Hungarians are par excellence a mixed lot” and
that “the Hungarians have not one drop of blood of the ancient
Hungarians”. Contrary to this, it can be verified that 98 % of the
Hungarians today belong to a unified race and, linguistically speaking,
their language is also an ancient European tongue, into which some



unnecessary foreign elements were incorporated (which can be easily
omitted), only after the arrival of Christianity and later under Austrian
rule.
Wamberger not only received the greatest praise from Vienna, but the
Emperor gave him the rank of Hungarian nobility after which he
adopted the Hungarian sounding name, Ármin Vámbéry.
Later, following the instructions of the Emperor, this theory was made
official, and gladly so, by the German Ministers he sent into Hungary,
even though the old school of Austro-Hungarian professors never
accepted it. To counter this, Wamberger has written several books,
supported by the Austrian semi-government in Hungary, which were
translated into several languages and distributed world-wide. In these,
the Hungarians are portrayed as an Asiatic, nomadic, tent-dwelling
people, which lost its original identity and became a mixed lot. With
this theory, a great wound was inflicted on the fabric of Hungarian
history and historical truth in general. It was in this way that this
theory has spread in ever-wider circles, supported with great
enthusiasm by all Austrian and German chauvinists, even though it is
well known that the Hungarians are one of the most characteristically
agricultural people of Europe. Later, the Germans were not even
satisfied with the image that the Hungarians were Turkish nomads so
they began to teach in schools that the Hungarians are of Mongol
origins. The propagation of this theory served the Austrian Imperial
Powers to justify their politics toward the genocide of the Hungarians.
They never mentioned that there is not one shred of historical
evidence to support the Asiatic origin of the Hungarians. The end
result of these politics was that everyone, who was not well versed in
linguistics and anthropology, in other words, the majority of the
Hungarian population, accepted this false doctrine because they heard
it from all sides: in school and the press, sometimes served in a



pleasant, romantic setting.
The truth of the matter is that the Hungarians, just as the Finns,
Estonians and Basques, are the remnants of Europe’s pre-Arian
population, a fact that can be very accurately proven through
historical documents, linguistics, ethnography and anthropology. The
Hungarians survived many difficulties and foreign settlers in their
land, which is surrounded and well protected by the Carpathian Alps,
which are difficult to cross.
To obscure the fact that the vocabulary of the Magyar language is
more closely related to the ancient European languages than to the
Turkish language, the false doctrine was established that it is a “mixed
language” and almost every word was taken from some non-Magyar
source. The fact is that the words of the Magyar lexicon are in the
most logical way connected with one another, -- which is impossible in
a “mixed” language because there is no connection between its
heterogeneous elements – and, if there is some similarity between the
Magyar and some Indo-European words, those words can always be
traced back to the ancient Hungarian roots. Only the secondary
derivatives found their way into other languages. I cannot bring tables
of comparison in a letter as short as this but still, I would like to
mention a few facts:
Magyar: kő, (stone)
Ancient Magyar: ka, ke, kú,
In today’s dialect: kű.
Magyar: kemény (hard).
Szlavic: kamen = kő.



The very ancient words are always monosyllabic. The Magyar kő, ka,
ke, kú are not only monosyllabic but they consist of only two sounds.
To an ancient man the main characteristic of a stone was its hardness,
which is entirely correct because, the hardest substance on Earth, the
diamond, is also a stone. It is for this reason that the ancient Magyar
formed its word for hardness (kemény) from the word stone (kő). So
there can be no doubts that the Slavic kamen (stone) can only be a
derivative of the Magyar word kemény (hard), because it is formed
with five sounds, it is bi-syllabic and so it is of a later origin; it is the
derivative of the Magyar kemény.
Going even further, between the Magyar kő and kemény (stone and
hardness) there is a logical connection between sound and meaning,
but this generic unity is missing in the Slavic kamen and tvrdo (stone
and hardness) and the two words did not evolve from one another as
is the case in the Magyar kő and kemény. In the ancient Magyar
language, the words are always connected with one another by
phonetics, which is not so in the so- called mixed languages because
here words are thrown together by accident and are not one another’s
derivatives.
The Magyar víz, the Finnish vete, the Slavic voda, the German Wasser
are phonetically related to one another (v-z, v-t, v-d, v-sz), but we
have to realize that the Magyar word is still mono-syllabic, all the
others are bi-syllabic, or consist of four or five sounds and, for this
reason, they have to be of later origin.
Opposed to this, in the Turkish language, the names of water and of
stone are totally different. The water is szu, the stone is tas. So if the
Magyars came from Asia, why did they not use the Turkish words for
water and stone, but instead used European words?? Perhaps the
“nomadic Magyars” did not know of water and stone in Asia and they
became acquainted with them only after they arrived in Europe and



borrowed one of these words from the Germans, the other from the
Slavs? Or maybe the Europeans did not know water and stone and
borrowed these names from the nomadic, newly arrived Magyars? Is
this not absurd? Yes, it is but it can be silenced and it is silenced. Even
though every linguist knows that, when an uncultured people adopt
something from a more cultured people, they adopt their name for the
object at the same time.
What is the explanation of the above question? The explanation is that
all these words originated in Europe’s ancient times and that the
Magyars, being an ancient European people preserved the ancient,
mono-syllabic name of water and stone.
This deduction is completely logical and simple but it can be pushed
into obscurity.
Furthermore: A culture-word can be derived only from an ancient
nature-word and never the other way round. For example: viz ( water)
is an ancient nature-word, but vízvezeték (water-tap) is a culture
word. Would it be possible to derive the word for water (viz) from the
word water tap (vizvezeték)? Not with a clear mind. Yet these ideas
were still held true, in order to preserve the theories of the Emperor
and Wamberger.
I have a “scientific” article in my possession, which states similar
things by stating that the Magyar word hártya is the derivative of the
Latin charta (paper). The Magyar word hártya means a thin, skin-like
substance, a totally non-specialized nature-word which may mean
animal and plant substance or even an artificial material, like film. It
is related to the Magyar kéreg (bark) which is also a skin-like cover
but is thicker than skin. Undoubtedly the Magyar word hártya and the
Latin word charta are related in sound and form. But the Magyar
hártya is closely related to the word kéreg (h-r, k-r). Many have



wondered why the wooden flasks in Transylvania are called kártya?
This is very clear: they were so called because, in earlier forms, the
word kártya meant kéreg and these vessels were made of kéreg as are
the kászú, another vessel made of tree-bark. The proof that the
Magyar word hártya is an ancient word in the Magyar language is that
it has several relatives in sound and meaning in this language, (but
the borrowed words stand alone, without relatives in a language), and
also that in the northern, related languages kerta = bark, which is
linguistically related to the Italian corteccia = bark. Beyond this, the
German Kork and the Slavic kora = bark, and these last two remind
us of the Magyar korsó (pitcher) which – as we have seen – was made
of bark (kéreg) in ancient times. In Asia, in the Turkish language the
name of the kéreg (bark) is kabuk, a totally different word form.

Some basic words of the Magyar M-G word-group
Ég God and Universe
Egy the word of singularity and God



Ügek a later name for the Old God
Óg a structure imitating the sky
Igi, ügy eye-ball. In ancient representations these big, round eyes
express the peoples ethnicity.
Ág, aga Lit.: branch. This was the first hoe of the ancient
agriculturalists. It was made of a branch or antler. This instrument
was known from the earliest times in the Carpathian Basin. The shape
of this ág (branch) became the rovás sign for the letter “A”.
Ag, ug, mag, méh, megye -- all meant earth
Mag It is the name of a uni-centered geometric body. It is also a
masculine symbol
Gyöngy Lit.: pearl, meaning also mag.
Gyümölcs Fruit, the reciprocal of the seed (mag) and the life it
contains.
gyám, gyombó A staff with a rounded head, the ancient weapon of the
Magyars
Magyar Originally it meant a human, later a man. Its variation with
“K” is Makar, in Greek it means happy. One of the Magyar names of
God the Creator is Happy God (who bears the burden of the poor...)
Gomoly Originally: the ancient nebulae. Today it means a cloud.
Some representative words of the
Kun K- N, T word-group
K it is the sound of hardness



kő Stone. Its reciprocal is:
ék wedge, the first tool
kan, hím, makk male concepts
Kám he has the role of progenitor
ne female
kitta arrow
Their m-n words connected with God, life-sustaining concepts,
walking, wandering:
Mén stallion. Its white variant is the symbol of the ever wandering
Moon, later it attains also the meaning of progenitor.
Menny the sky
mony the virile male’s organ. Later an egg.
monnó ancient one
manó man
manyó woman
menyecske young woman
The female concepts are connected with water and wetness.
nedű, mut, mat, mad. Lit.: liquid, with the meaning also of mother
and the female.
nád reed, a plant which grows near or in water.



Nádszál kisasszonyunk – Lit. Miss Reed and the Egyptian Neit (the
reciprocal of the Magyar Tündér = fairy) are the same.
Some representative words of the
Sz-M Szemere wordgroup.
Szem The name of the Sun. Its IE derivatives: Sonne, Sun, Son,
Summer
szem lit. the eye
szem lit. a kernel of wheat, or any oblong seed
személy person
som cornel cherry, which is oblong and has one seed.

Székely/Magyar rovás (runic writing) was in the shape of a seed.
szánt to plow
szán sleigh
szamár donkey, the symbolic animal of Szemúr (Lord of the Seeds).
This ancient memory was preserved in the folk-story: “Why has a
donkey a cross on its back?”
szunnyad, szumnyad. To slumber. this is represented in Magyar art
with a half closed eye.
messze The concept of far and is the reciprocal of “számos” (plurality)

culture-word of the word stone but do not have the original ancient
nature-word (kő=stone) upon which it should rest.
Appendix 5
NUMERICAL ROVÁS (RUNES)
The letters of the Hungarian runic script cannot be compared with the
letters of any other script. Therefore, it is a fact that a very long time
ago, the Hungarians created their own letters. The figures of the
Hungarian numerical runes resemble the Roman numerical figures,
yet this was not merely copying on the part of the Hungarians. It was
simply based on a common origin, which can be made clear by the
following:
The greater part of the culture of the Romans was inherited from the
Etruscans and not from the Greeks. As we all know, the Etruscans
conquered Rome and the Etruscan Tarquiniuses became Roman kings.
Later, however, the Romans managed to drive them away and conquer
Etruria, and the Etruscans consequently became assimilated by the
Romans. This did not hinder but furthered the Romans in taking over



and learning the much higher culture of the Etruscans.
Furthermore, the Hungarian runic numbers agree much more closely
with the Etruscan runic numbers than with those of the Romans.
Magyar, Etruscan and Roman numbers
Apart from the Etruscan and Hungarian figures for the number 50, no
other similar figure can be found in the whole world. It calls, however,
for an explanation as to how such an agreement was possible between
the Hungarian and the Etruscan runic numbers, especially if the
Hungarians came to Europe only 1,000 years earlier. In that case they
could not have learned the numbers of the Etruscans who had already
vanished 1,000 years before, but could only have learned these from
the Romans. The only way we can understand this is to suppose that
the Etruscans and Hungarians had the same origin in primeval times,
or that the Hungarians already lived in Europe when the Etruscans
were there...

Appendix 7
Sir John Bowring on the Magyar language.
The Hungarian language goes far back. It developed in a very particular
manner and its structure reaches back to times, when most of the now
spoken European languages did not even exist. It is a language which
developed steadily and firmly in itself, and in which there is logic and



mathematics with the adaptability and malleability of strength and
chords. The Englishman should be proud that his language indicates an
epic of human history. One can show forth its origin; and alien layers
can be distinguished in it, which gathered together during the contacts
with different nations. Whereas the Hungarian language is like a rubble
stone; consisting of only one piece, on which the storms of time left not a
scratch. It's not a calendar that adjusts to the changes of the ages. It
needs no one, it doesn't borrow, does no buckstering, and doesn't give or
take from anyone. This language is the oldest and most glorious
monument of a national sovereignty and a mental independence. What
scholars cannot solve, they ignore. In philosophy it's the same way as
archeology. The floors of the old Egyptian temples, which were made out
of only one rock, can't be explained. No one knows where they came
from, or from which mountain the wondrous mass was taken. How they
were transported and lifted to the top of the temples. The genuineness of
the Hungarian language is a phenomenon much more wondrous than
this. He who solves it shall be analyzing the Divine secret; in fact the first
thesis of this secret: “In the beginning there was Word, and the Word was
with God, and the Word was God."
