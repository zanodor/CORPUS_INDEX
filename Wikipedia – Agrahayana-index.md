Agrahāyaṇa or Mārgaśīrṣa,[1] (Hindi: अगहन - agahana; मागर्शीषर् - Mārgaśirṣa) is a month of
the Hindu calendar. In India's national civil calendar, Agrahāyaṇa is the ninth month of the
year, mostly beginning on 18 November and ending on 18 December. Since Vedic times, this
month is known as Mārgaśīrṣa after the Nakṣatra (asterisms) Mṛgaśiras. In Tamil, the month is
known as Maarkazhi.
The word Agrahāyaṇa means the month of Ayana or Equinox (agra=first + ayana = travel of
the sun, equinox). The aligning of this name with the Mṛgaśiras Nakṣatra (lambda orionis),
gives rise to speculation that this name was given when the sun was near Orion at the time
of vernal equinox, i.e. around 7000 years ago.
In lunar religious calendars, Agrahāyaṇa may begin on either the new moon or the full moon
around the same time of year, and is usually the 9th month of the year.
In solar religious calendars, Agrahāyaṇa/Maarkazhi begins with the Sun's entry into
Sagittarius, and is the 9th month of the year.
Vaikuṇṭha Ekādaśī, the Ekādaśī (i.e. 11th lunar day) of this Mārgaśīṣa month, is celebrated
also as Mokṣadā Ekādaśī. The 10th Canto, 22nd Chapter of Bhāgavata Purāṇa, mentions
young marriageable daughters (gopis) of the cowherd men of Gokula, worshiping Goddess
Kātyāyanī and taking a vrata or vow, during the entire month of Mārgaśīṣa, the first month
of the winter season (Śiśira), to get Śrī Kṛṣṇa as their husband.[2]
Bhairava Ashtami falls on Kṛṣṇa Pakṣa Aṣṭamī of this month of Mārgaśīṣa. On this day it is
said that Lord Śiva appeared on earth in the fierce manifestation (avatāra) as Śrī
Kālabhairava. This day is commemorated with special prayers and rituals.
In Tamil Nadu during this month of "marghaazi" ladies make "koolams" or "rangoli" early in
the morning during 4 - 5 o' clock.[3]
