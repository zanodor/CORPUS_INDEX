EVERY ANCIENT CULTURE HAD ITS MYTHS.
These timeless tales of gods and heroes give us a window into the
beliefs, values, and practices of people who lived long ago. They can
make us think about the BIG QUESTIONS that have intrigued
humankind down through the ages: questions about human nature,
the meaning of life, and what happens after death. On top of all that,
myths are simply great stories that are lots of fun to read.
What makes a story a myth? Unlike a narrative written by a partic
ular author, a myth is a traditional story that has been handed down
from generation to generation, first orally and later in written form.
Nearly all myths tell the deeds of gods, goddesses, and other divine
beings. These age-old tales were once widely accepted as true and
sacred. Their primary purpose was to explain the mysteries of life and
the magic of myths

THE MAGIC of MYTHS
the origins of a society’s customs, institutions, and religious rituals.
It is sometimes hard to tell the difference between a myth and a
heroic legend. Both myths and legends are traditional stories that may
include extraordinary elements such as gods, spirits, magic, and mon
sters. Both may be partly based on real events in the distant past.
However, the main characters in legends are usually mortals rather
than divine beings. Another key difference is that legends are basically
exciting action stories, while myths almost always express deeper
meanings or truths.
Mythology (the whole collection of myths belonging to a society)
played an important role in ancient cultures. In very early times, peo
ple created myths to explain the awe-inspiring, uncontrollable forces
of nature, such as thunder, lightning, darkness, drought, and death.
Even after science began to develop more rational explanations for
these mysteries, myths contin
ued to provide comforting
answers to the many questions
that could never be fully
resolved. People of nearly all cul
tures have asked the same basic
questions about the world
around them. That is why myths
from different times and places
can be surprisingly similar. For
example, the people of almost
every ancient society told stories
about the creation of the world,
the origins of gods and humans,
and the afterlife.
A woman hangs harvested corn ears to dry outside her village home.



Mythology’s other roles have included providing instruction, inspi
ration, and entertainment. Traditional tales offered a way for the mem
bers of a society to express their fundamental beliefs and values and
pass them down to future generations. The tales helped preserve mem
ories of a civilization’s past glories and held up examples of ideal
human qualities and conduct. Finally, these imaginative stories have
provided enjoyment to countless listeners and readers from ancient
times through today.
The MYTHS OF THE WORLD series explores the mythology of some
of history’s greatest civilizations. Each book opens with a brief look at
the culture that created the myths, including its geographical setting,
political history, government, society, and religious beliefs. Next
comes the fun part: the stories themselves. We have based our
retellings of the myths selected for these books on a variety of tradi

tional sources. The new versions are fun and easy to read. At the same
time, we have strived to remain true to the spirit of the ancient tales,
preserving their magic, their mystery, and the special ways of speech
and avenues of thought that make each culture unique.
As you read the myths, you will come across sidebars, or text boxes,
highlighting topics related to each story’s characters or themes. The
sidebars in The Ancient Chinese include quoted passages from texts dat
ing back hundreds or thousands of years. The sources for the excerpts
are given in the Notes on Quotations on page 94. You will find lots of
other useful material at the back of the book as well, including infor
mation on Chinese mythological texts, a glossary of difficult terms,
suggestions for further reading, and more. Finally, the stories are illus
trated with both ancient and modern paintings, drawings, and other
works of art inspired by mythology. These images can help us better
understand the spirit of the myths and the way China’s traditional
tales have influenced other cultures through the ages.
Now it is time to begin our adventures in ancient China. We hope
that you will enjoy this journey to a land of powerful gods and spirits,
superhuman heroes, and awe-inspiring dragons. Most of all, we hope
that the sampling of stories and art in this book will inspire you to fur
ther explorations of the magical world of mythology.
Scholars have used many different systems of spelling when translating
Chinese words into English. In 1979 the government of the People’s
Republic of China adopted a new standard spelling system called
pinyin. In most cases this book follows that system. We have included
pronunciation guides for some especially difficult words.

CHINA IS ONE OF THE LARGEST COUNTRIES IN THE
world. Covering nearly 4 million square miles in eastern Asia, it is
roughly the size of the United States and slightly smaller than Canada.
Within this vast area are a great variety of landscapes. There are tow
ering mountains, rocky plateaus, rolling hills, grasslands, steppes,
deserts, narrow coastal plains, and fertile river valleys.
China’s climate is as varied as the land. Temperatures in the coun
try’s many different regions range from sizzling hot to freezing cold
and everything in between. During the winter months, dry winds flow
out from the heart of Asia, bringing drought to most of the land. In
the summer, warm moist winds blow inland from the Pacific Ocean.
These monsoon winds bring heavy rains to much of the east.
Most of China’s early settlers lived in the eastern part of the coun
try. Temperatures in this area are generally milder than in the west.
The land is mostly rolling hills and plains, watered by two great rivers:

the Huang He (also called the Yellow River) and the Chang Jiang (or
Yangtze River). The fine soil deposited by these rivers fertilizes the sur
rounding lands, making the river valleys good places for farming.
Early settlers also enjoyed the protection of natural geographical
barriers. To their east was the seemingly endless sea. To their north,
south, and west were forbidding mountains, plateaus, steppes, and
deserts. These land features tended to separate China from the rest of
the world.
From time to time, people from other ancient civilizations man
aged to reach China by land or sea routes. The Chinese people some
times borrowed new ideas and technologies from these foreign
visitors. For the most part, though, they developed their own way of
life in isolation. They regarded themselves as a people specially chosen
by the gods and dismissed those of other cultures as uncivilized “bar
barians.” That attitude was reflected in a name they sometimes gave
their homeland. They called it Zhongguo, which means “Central
States” or “Middle Kingdom,” because they believed that it was the
center of the civilized world.

From VILL AGE to

THE HISTORY OF THE MIDDLE KINGDOM DATES BACK AT
least seven thousand years. The earliest human settlements in what
would become China were small farming villages along the banks of
the Yellow and Yangtze rivers. Over the centuries those settlements
grew into a number of different states. Rival states often fought over
the control of territory. The kings of the strongest states ruled over the
lands and people they conquered. Powerful families passed down con
trol of their kingdoms from generation to generation. Chinese history
is divided into periods named for these ruling families, or dynasties.
According to legend, the Xia (pronounced shah) family founded
China’s first dynasty. However, the Xia left few if any lasting traces of
their civilization. The earliest dynasty for which we have solid evidence is
the Shang, who came to power sometime around 1700 BCE. The Shang
people made elaborately decorated bronze vessels. They also developed
the earliest known system of Chinese writing, using inscriptions on turtle



shells and ox bones to ask questions of the gods and ancestor spirits.
Around 1050 BCE the Zhou (joh) family overthrew the Shang. The
Zhou controlled the Middle Kingdom for more than eight centuries.
Their reign was marked by great political, scientific, and cultural
advances. It ended in a time of war and upheaval known as the Warring
States period. During that chaotic period, the lords of the seven largest
Zhou states fought a series of bloody battles for supremacy.
In 221 BCE the state of Qin (chin) triumphed over all the others.
The king of Qin took a new title: Shi Huangdi (shir hwong-dee), or
“First Emperor.” The dynasty founded by Qin Shi Huangdi marked
the beginning of a new era, when all the land was united under a sin
gle ruler. It also gave us our name for that land, China.
The Qin dynasty collapsed after the death of its powerful leader.
For the next four hundred years, the Han dynasty ruled China. Han
emperors expanded the country’s borders through diplomacy and war.

They encouraged scholarship, science, technology, and the arts. They
opened up trade with the outside world along a long overland route
known as the Silk Road.
In 220 CE the Han dynasty dissolved into rival kingdoms. The land
was divided for more than three hundred years. Then several dynasties
followed, including the Sui, Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing.
Altogether the age of emperors lasted more than two thousand years,
until the establishment of the Republic of China in 1912. During that
long imperial age, the Chinese people created some of the world’s
largest cities and most ambitious engineering projects. They made
advances and inventions in science and technology. They also created
fine art and literature, including a treasure trove of myths that con
tinue to entertain millions of people in China and around the world.
A variety of systems of dating have been used by different cultures
throughout history. Many historians now prefer to use BCE (Before
Common Era) and CE (Common Era) instead of BC (Before Christ) and AD
(Anno Domini), out of respect for the diversity of the world’s peoples.

Th e S O C I A L P Y R A M I D
The SOCIAL PYRAMID
THE EMPEROR STOOD AT THE VERY TOP OF ANCIENT
Chinese society. The Chinese people honored their emperors as “Sons
of Heaven”—extraordinary mortals whose mandate, or right to rule,
came directly from the gods. That divine gift brought great power,
along with grave responsibilities. As the head of the government, the
emperor was responsible for ensuring the safety and prosperity of the
empire. He also presided over religious rituals and sacrifices honoring
the gods and the powerful spirits of his ancestors. If he failed to per
form any of his duties properly, the gods could withdraw their man
date, and a new dynasty would rise.
Beneath the emperor was a privileged class of nobles and government
officials. The noble class included the emperor’s relatives and members of
other important families. Government officials were organized by rank in
a highly efficient administrative system. The highest-ranking officials
worked in the imperial capital, advising the emperor and running the



government departments. Other
ministers enforced the central
government’s laws and policies in
provinces outside the capital.
The great majority of China’s
people were peasant farmers.
Government decrees honored
members of this class for provid
ing the food and labor that were
the backbone of the economy.
Despite their high official status,
peasants were the most down
trodden members of society.
They worked long hours in the
sun, wind, and rain. A flood or
drought could wipe out an entire
year’s harvest. In both good years
and bad, they had to pay taxes in
the form of grain and labor.
Farmers who could not pay their
debts could lose their land. Some were even forced to sell their chil
dren into slavery.
Like farmers, craftspeople were considered productive members of
society. China’s skilled craftspeople produced practical goods such as
clay pots and sturdy iron tools and weapons. They also turned out lux
ury items, including fine jewelry, beautifully patterned silk, and exqui
site bronze and lacquered vessels.
Merchants took last place on the social scale. Buying and selling
the goods that other people made was considered a dishonorable

occupation. The lowly status of merchants did not prevent some of
them from gaining wealth and influence. The son of a successful trader
might become a government official, while his daughter might marry
into a noble family.
Wives of all classes were expected to be humble and submissive to
their husbands. Despite these restrictions, women of the upper class
often enjoyed considerable respect and authority within their homes.
At the imperial court, women influenced important decisions, includ
ing the choice of the emperor’s heir. During the Tang dynasty, one
forceful woman named Wu Zetian even became a “Son of Heaven” in
her own right.

BLENDING of FAITHS
Opposite: The Chinese wise man Kong Fuzi, known in the West as Confucius
THE RELIGION OF IMPERIAL CHINA WAS A BLENDING OF
ancient beliefs and the teachings and stories of three later faiths:
Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism.
Traditional beliefs: China’s earliest people worshipped a multitude of
divine beings. The gods of nature were everywhere—in trees, moun
tains, rivers, the sky, the stars, the thunder. They brought rainfall and
drought, health and sickness, victory and defeat. The spirit world was
also home to many ancestor spirits. The ancestors of kings and other
important people had especially godlike powers.
Confucianism: The Chinese wise man and teacher Confucius was
born in the sixth century BCE, during a period of great political and
social unrest. In response to his chaotic times, he developed a system
of ideas that called for a society based on order and morality. After his



death the philosophy known as Confucianism became the foundation
of China’s highly structured government. While Confucianism was not
strictly a religion, it had a major impact on religious practices and
mythology. Confucius stressed the importance of observing the proper
rituals for honoring the ancestors. His followers collected and
recorded the ancient stories of mythical god-kings.
Taoism (or Daoism): Around the same time that Confucius was
teaching, other philosophers were developing the basic ideas of
Taoism (DOW-izm). According to tradition, the father of Taoism was

Laozi (low-zuh), also known as Lao-tzu. This wise man recorded his
beliefs in the Tao De Jing, or “The Classic of the Way and the Power.”
The Tao De Jing urged people to live a simple life, in harmony with the
flow of nature. That would lead them to the Tao, or “Way,” which was
the mystical source of all being. Over the centuries Taoism developed
into a complex combination of religion and philosophy, embracing
many different mystical practices. Some followers used special diets,
exercises, and “magic potions” in attempts to gain immortality and
supernatural powers.
Buddhism: Buddhism came to China from India during the first cen
tury CE, through travelers along the Silk Road. This ancient faith had
been founded centuries earlier by the Indian prince Siddhartha
Gautama, also known as the Buddha, or “Enlightened One.” The
Buddha taught that people are reborn, or reincarnated, many times.
He outlined a path to salvation based on a set of strict moral guide
lines. Virtuous people who followed this path would eventually
achieve release from the cycle of rebirth, entering a state of endless
bliss called nirvana. Over time the Chinese people added the divine
beings of Buddhism to their vast family of deities. They also adopted
many Buddhist beliefs, including ideas about reincarnation and an
underworld where souls were judged before returning to life in their
new bodies.

THE LIVES OF THE ANCIENT CHINESE REFLECTED THEIR
country’s unique blending of religious beliefs and practices. A family
might worship the ancient gods through the religious rituals pre
scribed by Confucianism. They also might strive to follow Buddhism’s
moral principles and guidelines. At the end of a long day, they might
surround themselves with the beauty of nature, finding peace of mind
in Taoism’s mystical Way.
The day-to-day religious practices of most Chinese focused mainly
on practical concerns. Every home had an altar where the family pre
sented offerings to the spirits of their ancestors. In return, the dead
watched over the living, bringing guidance and good fortune. The
Chinese also honored a host of local gods and guardian spirits. They
pasted paper images on their front doors, representing the two
guardians who prevented evil spirits from entering. They burned
incense before images of the gods who safeguarded the back entrance,

courtyard, and other parts of the house. They visited shrines and tem
ples to honor the deities responsible for the wind, the rain, the soil,
wealth, happiness, and other aspects of the world.
All these gods and goddesses were organized in a heavenly admin
istration modeled on the country’s political system. Like their earthly
counterparts, the lower-ranking gods had to make regular reports
to their higher-ups. The god of the kitchen, for example, went up to
heaven on the first day of each year to report on the members of the
household. The family sent him off with a tasty meal, so that he would
speak favorably about them. They might even offer the god’s image a
sticky treat, in the hopes that his mouth would stick shut.
China’s priests were responsible for building and maintaining the
shrines and temples. They presided over elaborate rituals honoring
the major gods and spirits. They also practiced divination to inter
pret the signs of heaven’s intentions. Diviners used methods such as
throwing lots or “reading” the pattern of cracks on animal bones to
receive messages from the gods and ancestors.
The chief priest was the emperor. As the “Son of Heaven,” this
exalted being had a special ability to communicate with the spirit
world. Several of the stories that follow will take us back in time to the
first emperors, the mythical beings who ruled over China at the very
beginning of the world.

Pangu the Giant and Nu Gua the Serpent Goddess
Pangu the Giant and Nu Gua the Serpent Goddess
the origins of the
world and humans
THE ANCIENT CHINESE TOLD MANY DIFFERENT STORIES
about the origins of the world and the first people. One of the most
popular creation myths featured a giant named Pangu. According to
this ancient tale, the universe was once a vast cloud of vapor, which
was shaped like a giant egg. Born inside the “cosmic egg,” Pangu pro
ceeded to bring order out of chaos. First he broke the egg, allowing the
vapor to take shape as the heavens and the earth. Then he pushed the
sky and the earth far apart, so that they would never dissolve together
again. Finally, when he died, his body was magically transformed into
the natural features of the world.
The Pangu creation story introduces us to the important concept of
yin and yang. According to traditional Chinese thought, everything in
the world is made up of these two opposing but related forces. Yin is
the “female” force, associated with darkness, cold, dampness, and sub
missiveness. Yang is “male,” with characteristics that are bright, hot,

dry, and dominant. When Pangu broke the cosmic egg, all the ele
ments of creation separated into yin and yang, bringing about the
ordering of the universe.
Some Chinese myths say that Pangu created not only the heavens
and the earth but also the human race. Other tales give the credit for
human creation to Nü Gua. This ancient goddess was a shape-shifter,
a mythical being with the power to change into different forms. In her
most common form, she was a serpent or dragon. At the beginning of
the world, Nü Gua molded the first people from yellow earth. These
perfectly formed men and women were the ancestors of the nobles
who would rule over Chinese society. A later batch of humans, made
quickly and carelessly from mud, would become the common people.
Pangu Creates the Sky and the Earth
L
ONG AGO, at the beginning of time, heaven and earth were
mingled together. All was the same, in a vast empty universe. All
was dim and misty, formless and endless, a swirling desolation.
It is said that this mass of confusion was shaped like a giant
chicken’s egg. At the heart of the egg, Pangu was born. Pangu was the

first of all beings, the child of the forces of the universe.
For countless ages Pangu slept inside the egg. Finally, he woke up
and stretched his arms. The shell of the egg cracked, and everything
inside poured out. The light and pure parts that were yang floated up
and became the sky. The dark and heavy parts that were yin sank down
and became the earth.
Pangu was pleased with the separation of sky and earth, but he
feared that they would not remain divided. So he stood with the blue
sky resting on his head and his feet pressing down on the yellow earth.
The sky rose higher, the earth sank deeper, and Pangu grew taller in
the space between them.
For 18,000 years Pangu stood like a pillar. Each day the sky rose
ten feet higher, and the earth sank ten feet deeper. Each day Pangu
grew ten feet taller, until he had grown into an enormous giant.
At last the sky reached its highest height, and the earth reached its
lowest depth. Pangu saw that the two were fixed firmly in place. Never
again would the world dissolve into chaos.

Pangu separated the sky and the earth, making room for all the natural features of the world.



Sighing with relief, the giant lay
down to rest from his long labors. He
breathed deeply one last time and
drifted into a peaceful death. As he
died, his breath was transformed into
the wind and clouds. His voice
became the rolling thunder. His left
eye rose as the sun, his right eye as
the moon. The hairs of his head and
beard turned into the countless stars.
The sweat of his brow streamed
down as the life-giving rain.
The other parts of the giant’s
body became the features of the
earth. His trunk and limbs turned
into the sacred mountains of the five
directions: north, south, east, west,
and center. His flesh formed the fer
tile fields. His muscles and veins
became the paths that humans
would travel. The hairs on his body grew as the grass, plants, and trees.
His blood flowed into the seas, lakes, and rivers. His teeth and bones
became rock and metal, while the marrow of his bones hardened into
precious pearls and jade. The dying body of Pangu even gave rise to
living beings, when the tiny specks on his skin sprang forth as the fish
and animals.
And so it was that the firstborn, Pangu the giant, brought order out
of chaos and filled heaven and earth with all their splendors.

Nü Gua Creates the First People
When the earth was complete, Nü Gua came
down from heaven to see the great creation. Nü
Gua was a remarkable goddess who could change
her shape at will. In her favorite form, she had the
head of a woman and the body of a serpent.
Nü Gua slithered across the quiet landscape
on her long tail. She saw the mountains, forests,
and rivers. She saw the busy fish and animals.
Everything was beautiful, but somehow the
world still seemed dull and empty.
All alone, the goddess lay down on the bank of
a deep, calm river. She gazed at her own reflection
in the water. Suddenly she had an idea. She would
use her divine powers to create some companions.

ure. Instead of a tail like her own, she gave her
creation two legs, so that it could walk around on the face of the earth.
When she was finished, she placed the first human being on the
ground, and it began to dance with happiness.
What a delightful creature! Nü Gua made another figure and
another. The perfect little men and women laughed and danced around
their great mother, and the goddess was no longer lonely.
All through the day and night, Nü Gua labored feverishly to fill the
world with her children. Finally she became too tired to finish the task.
The serpentine goddess Nü Gua was lonely in a world without people.



She had to find a way to work more
quickly and easily.
So the goddess plucked a length of
vine from the riverbank. She dragged
the vine through a muddy ditch. She
cracked it in the air like a whip, fling
ing drops of mud all around her. As each clod touched the earth, it
turned into a human being. That is why we have nobles and common
ers. The rich and fortunate nobles were each carefully shaped by the
goddess. Those who formed from the haphazardly flung drops of mud
became the poor and humble people.
At last there were plenty of human beings. But people made from clay
and mud could not live forever. What would happen when they grew old
and died? After much thought the goddess came up with an answer to
this dilemma. Calling the men and women together, she taught them
how to marry and raise children. Now humans
could create their own sons and daughters.
In time Nü Gua herself took a husband. She
married her brother Fu Xi, and he became the
first emperor. The great god showered humankind
with blessings. He showed the people how to hunt
and fish. He taught them the arts of writing,
divination, and making music. Fu Xi also gave
humans the valuable gift of fire.
All the people honored Fu Xi and Nü Gua for
their gifts. They built temples and sang the
praises of their god and goddess. And for many
long years, the men and women of the earth lived
in peace and happiness.

NÜ GUA REPAIRS the SKY
the chinese speak
The mother goddess Nü Gua not only created humans but also
saved them from extinction after the world’s first war. According to
this ancient story, Gong Gong, a god of water, and Zhu Rong, a god
of fire, fought over which was more powerful. Gong Gong lost the
battle. In his fury he knocked down one of the four pillars that held
up the corners of the sky. The sky shattered, the earth cracked, and
fires, floods, and other calamities followed. An ancient Chinese text
called Huainanzi (“Master Huai-nan”) explains how Nü Gua
patched up the sky and made new pillars from the legs of a giant
turtle. Huainanzi was written by Taoist scholars around 140 BCE,
during the early Han dynasty.
Long ago Gong Gong fought with Zhu Rong to be God. In his
fury he knocked against Buzhou Mountain [the sacred moun
tain of the West]. The pillar of Heaven broke and the cord of
earth snapped. . . .
Fires raged fiercely and could not be extinguished. Water
rose in vast floods without abating. Fierce beasts devoured the
people. . . . Then Nü Gua [melted] five-color stones to mend
the blue sky. She severed the feet of a giant sea turtle to support the
four poles. . . . And she piled up the ashes from burned reeds to dam the surg
ing waters. The blue sky was mended. The four poles were set right. The surging
waters dried up. . . . Fierce beasts died and the people of [earth] lived. . . .
When one considers her achievement, it knows only the bounds of Ninth
Heaven above and the limits of Yellow Clod below. She is acclaimed by later
generations, and her brilliant glory sweetly suffuses the whole world. . . . She
holds the secret of the Way of the True Person and follows the eternal nature
of Heaven and earth.

wars of the gods
ACCORDING TO MYTHOLOGY, THE FIRST THREE EMPERORS
of China were gods who came to dwell on the earth. The names of
these divine emperors vary in accounts from different time periods and
regions. During the Han dynasty, the list commonly included Fu Xi
(husband of the creator goddess Nü Gua), Shen Nong (a god of agri
culture), and Huang Di, or the Yellow Emperor.
The Yellow Emperor may have been partly based on a real king or
chief who lived in the Yellow River region thousands of years ago. After
his death this leader was honored as a minor god. Over time he grew in
importance, inspiring a host of myths. Beginning with the Qin dynasty,
all of China’s rulers took the title Huangdi, or “emperor,” linking them
selves with the Yellow Emperor and the other mythical god-kings.
Huang Di’s fame derived largely from his role as a culture hero. A
culture hero is a mythical character who gives the essential tools of civ
ilization to humankind. Various stories credit the Yellow Emperor with



44 Th e A N C I E N T CH I N E S E
giving the people of China gifts such as government and the pottery
wheel. Han dynasty historians hailed him as the founder of Chinese
culture and the ancestor of the Han people.
Ancient myths also portray the Yellow Emperor as a powerful war
rior. Although he longs for peace, he is forced to fight against a series
of enemies who challenge his authority. He defeats his rivals through
his supernatural powers and his mastery over wild animals and water.
Through his victories he restores the Taoist ideals of balance and har
mony to the world.

A Battle of Brothers
L
ONG AGO, IN THE DAYS when gods still dwelled among
humans, Huang Di, the Yellow Emperor, ruled over the Middle
Kingdom. This great god loved peace, but he did not hesitate to go to
war when his kingdom was threatened. “If a ruler is in danger, the peo
ple beneath him will feel troubled and uneasy,” said the wise emperor.
“If a ruler loses his kingdom, his officials will ally themselves with
another, and their loyalties will be forever uncertain. No good king
could ever allow such a threat to the harmony of his subjects.”
The first threat to Huang Di’s reign came from an unexpected
source: the emperor’s own brother, Yan Di. This jealous god com
manded the forces of fire, and thus he was known as the Flame
Emperor. The Yellow Emperor and the Flame Emperor each ruled
over half the world. One day Yan Di decided that he no longer wanted
to share his authority. He would overthrow his brother and become
the world’s sole ruler.
The two brothers gathered their forces. The Flame Emperor’s army
was made up of monsters and demons. The Yellow Emperor’s ranks
were filled out with bears, wolves, panthers, tigers, and other wild crea
tures. Shrieks and howls tore the sky as the savage warriors met on the
northern plains of Zhuolu. Hundreds were killed or wounded. The
blood flowed in ghastly streams across the battlefield. Still, at the end
of a long day of fighting, neither side had proven victorious.
That was when the Flame Emperor called up his greatest weapon.
With a cry of rage, he hurled blazing shafts of fire at his brother’s army.
The Yellow Emperor responded with his own divine weapon: water.
Towering waves met the flames and quenched them completely. The
Flame Emperor’s forces were defeated, and Yan Di himself was captured.

Following his great victory,
Huang Di established order
throughout the universe. He
appointed four gods to watch
over the four directions. The
Four Emperors were Tai Hao in
the east, Shao Hao in the west,
Gao Yang in the north, and
Yan Di, the defeated Flame
Emperor, in the south.
Chief of all these gods was
Huang Di. The Yellow Emperor
built a magnificent jade palace
at the top of Mount Kunlun.
There he reigned as the god of
the center and the supreme
ruler of heaven and earth.
The War God’s Rebellion
Many officials served the Yellow Emperor at the imperial court.
Among these was Chi You, god of rain and war. With his massive iron
head, sharp horns, and cloven hooves, Chi You was a fearsome sight.
His seventy-two brothers, who lived in a village in the south, were just
as huge and powerful. These brutish brothers were blacksmiths whose
specialty was making iron spears, swords, and other weapons of war.
Although Chi You was just a minor official, he had an arrogance to
match his bull-like appearance. He was convinced that he was stronger
and smarter than the Yellow Emperor. Eager to prove his might, he

plotted to overthrow Huang Di and seize the throne. Traveling to the
south, he rallied his brothers and recruited a tribe of barbarians to join
his rebellion. Then he led his troops north, toward the imperial capital.
Word of the approaching army soon reached the Jade Palace. The
peace-loving emperor sent messengers to try to reason with Chi You,
but the rebel leader was too consumed with ambition to listen. So
once again Huang Di summoned the bears, wolves, tigers, and other
wild animals. His troops sallied forth from the capital and met the
enemy army at the famous battlefield of Zhuolu.
Swords, spears, and battle-axes clashed. Teeth and claws dripped with
blood. The two armies were equally matched. But Chi You was prepared
to try any trick to overcome his opponent. At the height of the fighting,
the bull-headed god used his magical powers to surround Huang Di’s
army with a thick white fog. The emperor’s troops circled around blindly

as the enemy slashed and stabbed at
them. Only the quick thinking of one
of the imperial ministers saved the
helpless army from total destruction. In
a flash the clever official created the first
compass. With the help of this marvelous
instrument, Huang Di and his troops
found their way out of the deadly cloud.
Chi You was enraged by the
emperor’s escape. With a roar he sum
moned two of his allies, the masters
of wind and rain. The divine pair
unleashed a terrible storm, driving
back the Yellow Emperor’s army.
Huang Di was surveying the battle from a hilltop. When he saw
that his troops were in trouble, he called for his daughter Ba. This
goddess was old and ugly, but she had one special power: she could
store scorching heat in her body. At her father’s command, Ba walked
out onto the storm-whipped battlefield. The heat of her body forced
the winds to flee and dried up the rains.
The emperor had won the battle, but the war was not over yet. As
the fighting dragged on, his troops were becoming more and more
weary. Huang Di knew that he needed something to lift his warriors’
spirits and dishearten the enemy. At last he came up with an idea. He
would make the world’s first war drum.
The emperor sent his strongest warriors to the Eastern Sea*, where
they captured and killed a roaring water monster. He sent another com
pany of soldiers to the mountain home of a powerful thunder dragon.
*Mythological texts use the name “Eastern Sea” for the East China Sea and Yellow Sea, two arms of the Pacific Ocean.
The homely old goddess Ba was also called Drought Fury, for her power to dry up the earth.

The Yellow Emperor
The two groups returned with
their prizes: the hide of the
sea monster and the two
largest bones from the
dragon. They stretched the
hide over a barrel. The gigan
tic bones would serve as drumsticks.
Now the emperor led his
army back into battle. He
raised the dragon bones and
struck the war drum nine
times. The thunderous
sound echoed for five hun
dred leagues, making the
mountains sway and the valleys tremble. Chi You’s soldiers cowered in
terror. The Yellow Emperor’s forces rushed in and slaughtered more
than half the rebel warriors.
Chi You and his remaining troops were surrounded on the field
of battle. The war drum thundered. The emperor’s divine dragon
Ying Long swooped down, devouring the enemy. The rebel army was
completely wiped out, and the rebel leader was captured.
In sorrow Huang Di condemned his former minister to death. Only
Ying Long had the courage to carry out the sentence. With one quick
slash of his sharp claws, the dragon cut off the head of the powerful
war god. The bloody chains from Chi You’s wrists were hurled out into
the wilderness. On the spot where they landed, the first maple trees
grew. Each year the leaves of these trees turn red, as an everlasting
reminder of Chi You’s punishment.

uang Di Joins the Immortals
After the death of Chi You, the Yellow Emperor faced two more
challenges to his authority. First he had to fight a giant named Xing
Tian, who wanted to rule over the earth and heaven. That fierce bat
tle ended when the emperor lopped off the giant’s head and hid it
inside a mountain. Next the emperors of the four directions rose up
against their supreme ruler. With a sigh, Huang Di called up his
army and demolished them.
That final victory marked the end of the wars of the Yellow
Emperor. From then on, Huang Di presided over an era of peace and
prosperity in which all people lived in harmony with nature. In this
happy age, the emperor gave the people of the earth many gifts to
make their lives better. He divided the earth into territories and intro
duced strictly ordered systems of law and government. He created the
first boats and carts, the pottery wheel, the calendar, coins, and med
icine. He taught the people how to plant their crops in season and
cook their food before eating it.
Altogether Huang Di ruled for one hundred years. At the end of his
long reign, he rode up to heaven on the back of a golden dragon. Many
members of the emperor’s household joined him as he went to dwell
among the immortals. Sadly, two divine beings were left behind. Ba, who
had helped her father defeat the war god Chi You, was too exhausted to
make the journey to heaven. She was forced to remain among humans,
an unwelcome visitor who brought heat and drought wherever she wan
dered. Ying Long the dragon also remained on the earth. He traveled
south to live among the high peaks and mountain pools. To this day the
dragon’s breath still brings rain to the south of China.

the adventures
of a hero
MANY ANCIENT PEOPLES TOLD STORIES ABOUT THE
adventures of heroes who used their superhuman skills, strength, and
courage to help humankind. One of the most popular mythical heroes
of ancient China was the divine archer Yi. This contradictory charac
ter appears in a number of different myths. In some tales he is a villain
whose crimes include the overthrow of the legendary Xia dynasty.
More often, though, Yi is remembered as the hero who saved the
world from the catastrophe of the ten suns.
According to the ancient tale, there were once ten boy-suns (one
for each day of the week in the ancient Chinese calendar). The boys
normally took turns appearing in the sky. One day they decided to
come out all at once, and the world was nearly incinerated. Their
father, an early god known as Di Jun, sent Yi the archer to chase his
sons out of the sky. Consumed with anger over the earth’s suffering, Yi
exceeded his orders, shooting and killing nine of the suns. He then



54 Th e A N C I E N T CH I N E S E
went on a heroic quest to rid the world of monsters. The bowman’s
deeds restored peace and order to the world. However, Di Jun was
furious over the slaying of his sons. The god stripped the divine archer
of his immortality and condemned him to live and die on the earth.
The dramatic story of Yi and the ten suns is set in the days of the
mythical emperor Yao. Yao was the fourth ruler after the Yellow
Emperor, the main character in our last story. He was also the first of
three mythical Sage Kings, who presided over a Golden Age of perfect
government. Confucius and his followers pointed to Emperor Yao as
an example of the ideal king, because he ruled with virtue, justice, and
devotion to his subjects.

55
Yi the Archer and the Ten Suns
Ten playful suns once lived among the branches of this marvelous
tree. The boys were the sons of Di Jun, god of the eastern sky, and his
divine wife, Xi He. Each morning Xi He would drive up to the tree in
a chariot pulled by six flying dragons. She would pick up one of her
sons, and together they would ride to the eastern edge of the sky. All
day the golden chariot would soar across the heavens, and the sun
would light up the earth. By the time the chariot dipped below the
western mountain, the weary boy-sun would be sleeping. The goddess
would fly back to the mulberry tree, give her children their baths, and
tuck them into bed among the leafy branches.
After a few hundred years, the ten suns grew tired of this routine.
They did not want to wait their turn to ride in their mother’s chariot.
They wanted to play in the sky together! So one morning, before Xi
He arrived, all the boy-suns flew up from the tree. They sang and
danced among the clouds. They laughed when they heard their
mother calling. They had such a good time that they vowed they
would never again be parted.
While the boys were enjoying themselves in the sky, the people of
the earth were suffering. They had watched in amazement as one sun
after another rose over the eastern horizon. Their wonder had turned
to horror as the ten bright suns began to dry up the soil and wither the
crops in the fields. Soon the lakes and rivers were boiling. Even the
rocks were melting. Wild animals and monsters fled the steaming
forests and devoured hundreds of men, women, and children.
In their fear and despair, the people turned to Emperor Yao. The com
passionate ruler prayed night and day, begging Di Jun to take pity on his
wretched subjects. When the god heard the emperor’s plea, he ordered
his sons to stop their nonsense and return to the mulberry tree. But the
unruly boys were having too much fun to pay attention to their father.



So Di Jun sent for the immortal archer Yi.
He gave the warrior a magnificent red bow
and a quiver filled with white arrows. “Go
down to the earth and reestablish order,” Di
Jun commanded. “Use this bow to frighten
my sons into obedience.”
In a flash Yi descended to the earth to obey
the god’s orders. He saw the scorched and blis
tering land. He saw the helpless people cower
ing in their huts, hungry, exhausted, and
terrified. His heart filled with rage. The time
for peaceful measures was past! The false suns
must be destroyed, or all life on earth would
perish!
Quickly Yi counted out ten arrows from
his quiver. He drew his bow and fired. A
white arrow streaked across the sky, and one
of the suns fell to the earth in a ball of fire.
Again and again the hero unleashed his
arrows. There were eight suns left. Seven. Six. The earth was becom
ing cooler. The people began to creep from their huts and cheer on
their champion. But Emperor Yao was getting worried. Yi was so
intent on his mission that Yao feared the hero would kill all the suns,
plunging the earth into eternal darkness. Quietly the emperor ordered
one of his soldiers to sneak up and steal one of the archer’s arrows.
Now there was only one sun left. Yi reached for his last arrow. It
was missing! The hero gazed up at the sky. He looked around at the
cheering people. Slowly he lowered his bow. One sun would remain to
give light and warmth to the earth.

Yi the divine archer had saved the world from disaster. But the peo
ple were still in danger. Without hesitation the hero took up his sword
and filled his quiver with new arrows. Then he set out to battle the wild
beasts and monsters.
For many long days, Yi traveled across the
earth. He hunted down a man-eating mon
ster called Chiseltooth, which shredded its
victims with a huge tooth as sharp as the cut
ting edge of a chisel. Yi killed this blood
thirsty creature with a single arrow. Next he
tackled the deadly Windbird, which whipped
up destructive storms by flapping its gigantic
wings. Yi tied a cord to an arrow and shot the
bird in the chest. Then he dragged it down to
the ground and beheaded it. Most fearsome
of all was a gigantic sea serpent that was
devouring the people of a lakeside village. Yi
shot the serpent until its scaly hide bristled
with arrows. He finally killed it by piercing its
heart with his sword.
All these creatures and more the divine
archer slew. When he had destroyed all the
monsters, he drove the wild animals back
into the forests. At last Yi’s heroic labors
were completed, and there was peace on the
earth. All the people sang his praises, and
Emperor Yao held a great feast in his honor.
Then the divine archer returned to
heaven, where his wife, the goddess Chang

E, was waiting impatiently. But
when Yi presented himself at
the court of Di Jun, the god
lashed out in anger. “I ordered
you to frighten my sons, not
kill them!” Di Jun shouted.
“For that I can never forgive
you. From this day on, you are
banished from heaven. Since
you love the people of the
earth so much, you can go live
among them as a mortal.”
So it was that Yi the archer
lost his immortality. Along
with the unhappy Chang E, he
went to live on the earth. The
hero spent the remainder of
his days serving Emperor Yao and hunting in the forests. He also
taught the people how to hunt with the bow, so that his archery skills
would never be lost.
In time the once-immortal archer died, and his spirit joined the
ghosts of other mortals in the underworld. But his deeds were never
forgotten. People still tell stories about the hero who shot the nine
suns and vanquished the monsters. In this way Yi the archer achieved
his own version of immortality.

Yi showed the people how to hunt ferocious tigers and other wild beasts.



CHANG E ESCAPES to the MOON
the chinese speak
One of the best-known characters associated with Yi the
archer is his wife, Chang E (also called Heng O). After the
couple was banished from heaven, Chang E refused to
accept the loss of immortality. She nagged her hus
band until he agreed to visit an ancient goddess
known as the Queen Mother of the West, who
guarded the magical potion of eternal life. Yi
returned home to share the potion with his wife,
but the greedy Chang E took it all herself. Fearing
her husband’s anger, she fled to the moon, where
she was changed into an ugly toad in punishment
for her selfishness.
Like most Chinese myths, the story of Chang E
has been pieced together from fragments scattered
through a variety of ancient texts. This passage
comes from Chu xue ji, or “Sources for Beginning
Scholarly Studies,” an encyclopedia of myths compiled
by the Chinese scholar Xu Jian around 700 CE.
Yi asked the Queen Mother of the West for the drug of immortality.
Yi’s wife, Heng O, stole it and escaped to the moon. She was meta
morphosed [transformed] on the moon and became the striped toad
Ch’an-ch’u, and she is the essence of the moon.

reshaping the face

ANCIENT PEOPLES ALL OVER THE WORLD TOLD STORIES
about a great flood. To the Chinese people, flood myths were espe
cially significant. Since prehistoric times, China’s vast rivers, especially
the Yangtze and Yellow rivers, have supplied fertile soil and life-giving
water to farm fields. At the same time, the people living around the
rivers have faced the threat of deadly floods. This ever-present danger
is reflected in at least four different Chinese flood myths. Unlike sim
ilar stories from other cultures, these tales generally present floods as
natural disasters rather than divine punishments for human sins.
The hero of the best-known Chinese flood myth is Yu the Great.
Yu was the son of Gun, a rebellious god who tried but failed to save
the people of the earth from the great flood. To accomplish his mis
sion, Gun stole a magical substance known as “Swelling Soil” from the
Supreme God in heaven. (This high god might also be called Tian Di,
Shang Di, the Jade Emperor, or simply God). Gun was executed for



62 Th e A N C I E N T CH I N E S E
his crime, but his spirit was miraculously reborn in his son, Yu.
Like the goddess Nü Gua in our earlier myth, Yu was a shape
shifter. He was born in the form of a dragon. He devoted his life to
redeeming his father’s name by completing the task that Gun had
started. Yu contained the flood by creating rivers, hills, and mountains.
He also invented the network of dams and canals that the ancient
Chinese used to channel the waters. Throughout his labors he demon
strated the highest ideals of a hero: intelligence, strength, devotion to
duty, and perseverance in the face of all obstacles.
When his heroic task was completed, Yu was rewarded with the
kingship, becoming the third and last Sage King of the Golden Age.
After his death the throne went to his son, Qi. That marked the begin
ning of the legendary Xia dynasty. It also provided a mythological
explanation for the tradition of hereditary rule that would be followed
by all the real-life dynasties to come.

I
N THE DAYS OF EMPEROR YAO, the earth was
devastated by a great flood. First came the rains,
beating down for days without end. The fields turned
into lakes, and the crops rotted in the muddy waters.
Then the rivers overflowed their banks, and the swollen
tide surged into the towns and villages. Thousands of
men, women, and children were drowned. Other people
took refuge in mountain caves and treetops. The wretched survivors
watched in despair as the waters kept rising, until it was impossible to
tell where the land began and the broad brown sea ended.
Emperor Yao’s heart filled with pain at the suffering of his subjects.
He turned to the heavens for help, sending up his prayers and offer
ings night and day. At last the immortal Gun answered. Gun was a
rebellious god with a reputation for disobeying orders, but he was also
brave and compassionate. Descending to the earth, he wept at the
scene of misery and turmoil. He wanted to help, but he had no idea
how to get rid of the waters.
Just then, two curious creatures came along. One was a horned
owl, the other a giant turtle. “Why do you look so worried?” the giant
turtle asked.
“I want to contain the flood, but I do not know how to build the
barriers,” Gun answered.
“That is not so difficult. All you need is a
magical substance called Swelling
Soil. It looks just like ordinary
dirt, but it will grow into any size
and shape you desire.” Looking around
The horned owl and the turtle told Gun the secret of the magical Swelling Soil.



nervously, the turtle went on in a whisper: “There is only one problem.
Swelling Soil is the most treasured possession of the Supreme God in
heaven, and he will never part with it.”
No one knows how Gun managed to steal the Swelling Soil from
the Supreme God. We only know that he succeeded. Soon he returned
to the earth with a lump of the precious substance. He dropped the
soil into the muddy waters. Suddenly great dams and mountains
sprang up, dividing the endless sea into lakes. Fresh new dirt grew up
on the bottom of the lakes, absorbing the waters. Patches of dry land
began to appear. People emerged from the caves and treetops, hailing
Gun as their savior.
There was one who was far from pleased with the hero’s handiwork,
however. In fact, the Supreme God was furious when he saw that Gun
had stolen the Swelling Soil and meddled in the affairs of humans
without permission. In his anger, the god sent Zhu Rong, lord of fire,
to punish the rebel. The fire god pursued his quarry to the slopes of
Feather Mountain, at the northern edge of the world. He killed Gun
with a stroke of his divine knife. Then he took the divine soil back to
heaven. The dams and mountains tumbled down, and the earth once
again sank beneath the floodwaters.
From the Belly of the God
It is no easy thing to destroy an immortal. After Gun’s execution his
divine body lay on the slopes of Feather Mountain for three years
without decaying. All that time the spirit that lingered in the body was
growing into a new being. When the Supreme God heard of this mar
vel, he sent one of his officials to dispose of the rebel once and for all.
The official flew down to the mountain and slit open Gun’s belly with
64 Th e A N C I E N T CH I N E S E



his sword. Out flew Yu the Great, in the form of a
yellow dragon.
Yu was born with all of his father’s knowl
edge, courage, and compassion. He was also
virtuous and dependable, without any of
Gun’s rebellious spirit. The golden dragon
flew straight up to heaven. He bowed low
before the throne of the Supreme God and
said, “O merciful god, the people of the earth
are weary with long suffering. I beg you to give
me the Swelling Soil, so that I may complete the
work that my father started.”
The great god was impressed by the dragon’s humility. “Your wish
is granted,” he proclaimed. “You may have the divine soil with my
blessings. Now go, and devote yourself diligently to the task of subdu
ing the floods.”
Joyfully Yu winged his way back down to the earth. He dropped
tiny lumps of the magical soil into the waters. Up sprang a series of
mountains and dams, holding back the floodwaters.
Yu knew that it was not enough to merely contain the flood. He
must also control the course of the rivers, so that they would flow
freely and safely to sea. Using his
shape-shifting powers, he changed
into the form of a man. Then he set
out across the face of the earth.
Everywhere he traveled, he created
new channels for the rivers to follow.
He dug down to lower the river
beds. He carved out new rivers and

built canals. He cut down trees, leveled hilltops, and tunneled through
mountains. As he worked, he also had to battle all the dangerous mon
sters that had emerged from the floodwaters.
Yu labored at his difficult mission for years without stopping. The
sun blistered his skin. His hands and feet became covered with cal
luses. His clothes grew ragged, his health failed, and his steps faltered.
Somehow the hero found the strength to continue his labors on behalf
of humanity.
The Birth of a Dynasty
When Yu was thirty years old, he began to think about taking a wife.
It was then that the heavens sent him a sign. He was walking past the
slopes of Mount Tushan when a white fox with nine tails scampered
across his path. Yu remembered the words of an ancient prophecy:
“He who sees the nine-tailed fox and marries the maiden of Tushan
shall wear a crown.” He hurried to the nearest village, where he met
the daughter of the chief. The famous hero asked for the girl’s hand in
marriage, and she and her father gladly accepted.
But the marriage was not a happy one. Yu worked so hard that he
hardly ever came home, even after his wife became pregnant with their
first child. One day the lonely girl came looking for her husband. The
shape-shifting god had transformed himself into a giant bear in order
to gouge a hole through a mountain. When the wife saw the fearsome
beast, she was so terrified that she turned to stone. Horrified, Yu cried
out, “My child! Give me my child!” With a loud crack, the rock split
open, revealing a newborn baby boy.
Yu named his son Qi, which means “cracked open.” As the boy
grew up, he helped his father with his work. Together the two traveled

across the Middle Kingdom, taming the waters and bringing peace
and order to the world.
After many years Yu’s heroic labors were finally completed. The
rivers flowed in their proper channels. New lands had been opened up,
with rich black soil perfect for farming. The hero had even laid down
roads connecting the nine provinces.
During the years that Yu had toiled, Yao had died and a new
emperor, Shun, had taken the throne. Now Shun himself was an old
man. It was time for him to name his successor. All the people rejoiced
when the emperor chose the hero whose tireless devotion to duty had
saved the world from the great flood.
Yu the Great ruled the Middle Kingdom with wisdom, virtue, and
humility. Worn out from his long labors, he died after only eight years
on the throne. His spirit returned to heaven, where it will dwell for all
eternity. And on the earth, his son, Qi, became the second emperor of
the great Xia dynasty.

a myth
of the stars
LIKE MOST ANCIENT PEOPLES, THE CHINESE WERE
fascinated by the stars. By the early fourth century BCE, Chinese
astronomers had already identified more than eight hundred stars and
grouped them into constellations. A variety of divine beings were asso
ciated with these heavenly bodies. The star deities played a constant
role in human affairs. “Lucky stars” might reward worshippers with
good health, love, marriage, prosperity, or success in examinations.
Other stars could have an evil influence, bringing disease, madness,
drought, or war.
One of the most popular and enduring Chinese star myths is the
story of the goddess Zhi Nü, known as the Weaver Maid, and the mor
tal cowherd Niu Lang. In this ancient tale, the Weaver Maid repre
sents the bright white star that people of the Western world call Vega,
while Niu Lang is the star Altair. The goddess and the herdsman fall
in love, but they are torn apart by the girl’s father, the Supreme God

in heaven. The god condemns the couple to live on opposite sides of
the Milky Way, known as the “Sky River” or “Silver River.” Once a year
the parted lovers are permitted to cross over the river on a magical
bridge formed by magpies (black-and-white birds that often symbolize
happiness).
Since the Han dynasty, this tale of true love has been celebrated in
the annual festival of Qi Xi (chee shee), or “Seventh Night.” On this
special evening, single women and newly married wives made offerings
of flowers, fruit, pastries, and other sweet treats to Zhi Nü and Niu
Lang. Young girls prayed for the goddess to share her skills as they
took part in weaving and needlework competitions. These age-old tra
ditions are dying out in modern China. However, many Chinese still
mark the Qi Xi Festival with stargazing. Peering up at the night sky,
they look for Vega and Altair shining on either side of the Milky Way,
with a third star forming a bridge between them.

the Weaver Maid
Supreme God Ruler of heaven
Niu Lang Mortal cowherd; husband of the Weaver Maid



IN OLDEN DAYS THE SILVER RIVER flowed all the way from
heaven down to the earth. On the eastern bank of the sparkling
waters sat Zhi Nü the Weaver Maid, daughter of the Supreme God in
heaven. Day after day Zhi Nü toiled over her spinning wheel, making
silk thread so fine that it was nearly invisible. With her magic loom, she
wove the thread into clouds, which she set free to rise up into the
heavens. The lovely young maiden also fashioned the delicate robes
that adorned the gods and goddesses.
On the opposite side of the river dwelled the humble cowherd Niu
Lang. This young man was an orphan. When his parents died, his elder
brother had claimed the best land for himself. All that was left for the
younger boy was a hard patch of ground and one old ox. But the
cowherd was a cheerful, industrious young man. He worked hard in
his fields without complaining. He also took good care of his ox, mak
ing sure the faithful animal always had enough to drink and eat.
As the years passed, the cowherd began to get lonely. He longed to
share his life with a wife and children. One day he was resting from his
solitary labors when something astonishing happened. His ox began to
speak! As it happened, this was no ordinary ox. He was really a deity
who had somehow angered the Supreme God and
had been exiled from heaven in punishment.
“You have been kind to me,”
the animal told his
young master. “In
return I will ease your
loneliness. There is a hidden
place on the Silver River where the seven daugh
ters of the high god come to bathe. Tomorrow I
will take you there, and you will find a wife.”
71
The Weaver Maid and the Cowherd
The magical ox told the lonely cowherd how to find his truelove.



So the next morning the ox led the cowherd to a clear pool in a
bend of the Silver River. The young man concealed himself in the thick
plants and trees that surrounded the waterhole. Soon seven heavenly
maidens descended from the sky. Shedding their celestial robes, the
divine girls stepped into the water.
Never had the cowherd beheld such grace and beauty! For a
moment he could only watch in wonder. Finally he stole out from hid
ing. Creeping up to the water’s edge, he gathered up the clothes of the
youngest and most dazzling maiden.
Just then, one of the sisters spotted the strange mortal. She let out
a cry, and the frightened girls grabbed their robes and fled back to
heaven. Only the seventh maiden was left trembling in the water.
The herdsman knelt down at the edge of the pool. “I mean you no
harm,” he said softly. “You are the most enchanting creature in the
world. I beg you to marry me and put an end to my loneliness.”
The gentle words of the
handsome young stranger
touched the girl’s heart. She
had been lonely, too, working
day after day at her weaving.
Shyly she gave her consent.
And that is how the immortal
Weaver Maid came to marry a
simple cowherd.
For several years Zhi Nü
and Niu Lang lived together
in happiness. The husband
worked in the fields, while the
wife tended to her weaving.
72 Th e A N C I E N T CH I N E S E
The goddess and the cowherd lived like ordinary mortals in a simple farming village.



They were blessed with two children, a
boy and a girl, and no one in their little
house was ever lonely.
Then the goddess began to neglect
her divine duties. Caring for her home
and family was so much work that
there was little time left for weaving.
The clouds began to vanish from the
sky. The robes of the gods and god
desses fell into tatters. Looking down from heaven, the Supreme God
grew more and more angry. Finally the god sent a messenger to bring
Zhi Nü back to the eastern side of the Silver River.
Niu Lang watched in horror as the divine messenger flew off with
his wife. Desperately the young man ran after them. He followed Zhi
Nü’s cries to the banks of the Silver River. There he stopped in amaze
ment. The river no longer flowed down to the earth. The Supreme God
had raised its glittering waters to run across the face of the heavens.
Sad and weary, the herdsman returned home, where another loss
awaited him. His faithful ox was lying down in its stall. “It is nearly
time for me to die,” said the aged animal. “When I am gone, you must
cut off my skin. Its magical properties will carry you to heaven.”
That night the ox died, and the cowherd carried out its final
instructions. He skinned the animal and wrapped its tough hide
around him like a cape. He balanced a carrying pole across his shoul
ders. He placed his two little children in the baskets hanging from the
ends of the pole. Then he lifted his eyes and took off for the heavens.
Swiftly Niu Lang flew toward the Silver River. He saw Zhi Nü wait
ing tearfully on the eastern bank. But the Supreme God had no inten
tion of allowing the mortal to reclaim his daughter. Reaching out his

divine hand, the god turned the river into a raging torrent.
The husband wept as he stood on the western bank. There was no
way to cross the broad, stormy waters. Suddenly his daughter spoke up
from the basket: “Father, why don’t we empty out the river?”
At once Niu Lang began to drain the river with a ladle. His son and
daughter helped by scooping out water with their hands. When the
Supreme God saw the family working so hard at their hopeless task,
his stern heart softened. “Very well,” he said to the herdsman, “you
may visit my daughter for one night every year.”
And so, on the seventh day of the seventh month each year, flocks
of magpies fly up from the earth to form a bridge across the Silver
River. The cowherd crosses the feathery bridge with his children, and
the family is reunited. The rest of the year, the husband and wife
remain on opposite sides of the sparkling waters. If you turn your eyes
to the night sky, you will see them. The bright star on the east side is
the Weaver Maid, tending to her weaving under the watchful eyes of
her father. To the west sits the cowherd, with his small son and daugh
ter beside him, waiting patiently to rejoin his beloved.

Each year the birds form a bridge in the heavens, uniting the parted lovers.



The SKY VOYAGER
the chinese speak
The myth of the Weaver Maid inspired a number of other stories about the Milky
Way. One tale featured a character known as the Sky Voyager, who built a flying
machine and took off to explore the heavens. The following
account of that magical journey comes from a third
century CE text called Bowuzhi, or “Record of Things
at Large.” The text mentions a real-life astronomer
named Yen Chün-p’ing (also known as Yan Junping),
who lived during the first century BCE. It also refers to
the Draught Ox constellation, another name for
Aquila (the constellation that contains the star of the
cowherd). According to the astronomer, the Sky Voyager him
self had been transformed into a star during his voyage, and the mysterious place
that he visited in the sky was the Draught Ox constellation.
In olden days it was said that Sky River [the Milky Way] was connected to the
sea. Nowadays there is a man [the Sky Voyager] who lives on a little island. Year
after year in the eighth month, a floating raft comes and goes, and it never fails
to pass by at the same time. The man had a wonderful idea—he erected a soar
ing compartment on the raft, packed provisions, boarded the raft, and left. . . .
He went on for ten days or more, when suddenly he came to a place where there
were what seemed like inner and outer city walls and well-ordered houses, and
in the distance he could see many weaver women in the palace. He saw a man
leading oxen. . . . The [Sky Voyager] asked where [he] was. [The man] answered,
“Go back . . . and put your question to [the astronomer] Yen Chün-p’ing; then
you will know.” In the end the [Sky Voyager] asked Yen Chün-p’ing, who said,
“On a certain day of a certain month in a certain year a stranger star trespassed
into the Draught Ox constellation.” He calculated the year and month, and it
was just when [the Sky Voyager] had arrived in Sky River.

MANY MYTHICAL CHARACTERS HAVE SOUGHT IMMORTAL
ity, but none has done it with more flair than the Monkey King. This out
rageous animal is the hero of a sixteenth-century CE novel called Xi You
Ji, or The Journey to the West. The book is loosely based on the real-life pil
grimage of a monk named Xuan Zang, who journeyed to India to obtain
the Buddhist scriptures for China. The fictional version of the monk’s
journey gives him three remarkable companions: a sand monster, a
greedy pig, and the arrogant, adventurous, mischievous Monkey King.
Our retelling of The Journey to the West focuses on Monkey’s early
exploits, before the start of his westward journey. Following his miracu
lous birth, the bold little creature grows up to become the ruler of a
monkey kingdom. One day he sets out to find the secret of eternal life.
He becomes the disciple of a holy man who has attained immortality
through mystical Taoist practices. Under this master, Monkey becomes
an immortal and also gains supernatural powers. However, he remains a

rascal. Leaving his teacher, he travels far and wide, causing turmoil with
his irresponsible behavior. Not until he is brought before the Buddha
himself does the troublesome character finally meet his match.
In some interpretations of this popular tale, the Monkey King repre
sents human nature with both its virtues and its weaknesses. During his
travels with the monk, he uses his powers to defeat monsters, help the
helpless, and bring peace and order to the world. Through his courage,
compassion, and devotion to duty, he makes up for the bad behavior of
his early years and achieves true wisdom and enlightenment.
The Monkey King’s story reminds us of the unique blending of
faiths in ancient China. Although the plot of The Journey to the West
revolves around the introduction of Buddhism to China, the charac
ters achieve their victories largely through their Taoist powers. As
Monkey tells a king encountered during their pilgrimage: “There is a
Way in the Buddha’s faith. . . . Combine the three teachings by hon
oring both the Buddhist clergy and the Way of Taoism, and by also
educating men of talent in the Confucian tradition. I can guarantee
that this will make your kingdom secure for ever.”

The Search for Immortality
A
T THE BIRTH OF THE WORLD, a stone egg appeared on a
mountaintop beyond the Eastern Sea. For long ages the stone sat
on its lonely peak, nourished by the sun, moon, and rain. One day it
split open. Out popped a stone monkey. “Wonderful! Wonderful!” cried
the funny-looking creature, and he scurried off to explore the world.
Now, all monkeys are playful, but this was the most cheerful, fun
loving creature the world had ever seen. He swung from the branches
and splashed in the mountain streams. He made friends with the deer,
wolves, leopards, and tigers. He led his fellow monkeys on so many
merry adventures that they decided to make
him their king. Ascending the throne, the
stone monkey (who was not the most humble
of fellows) gave himself a grand new title:
Handsome Monkey King.
The Monkey King ruled over his subjects
for three hundred carefree years. Then he
began to worry about the future. “I am happy
today,” he said, “but one day Yama, lord of
the underworld, will come to claim my soul.
What is the point of being a king if I must be
subject to that dread ruler’s powers?”
So Handsome Monkey King made up his
mind to find a master who could teach him
how to live forever. He built a raft and drifted
off into the great ocean. The winds carried
him to a distant shore, where he saw his first
people. He stole some clothes and swaggered

about, imitating human speech and manners. Then he set off across the
countryside. He wandered through towns and cities, barren deserts and
thick forests. At last he found his way to the cave of an immortal.
The holy man agreed to accept the unusual-looking seeker as a
disciple. Monkey stayed with his master for ten years, studying the
Taoist scriptures and learning the way of immortality. He also
learned how to perform many wonders. By the time he completed
his studies, he could soar through the
sky and change himself into seventy-two
different forms.
Armed with his new skills, the Monkey
King returned home, only to find his
mountain kingdom in an uproar. A dread
ful monster had robbed his subjects’
homes and stolen their children! Roaring with anger, Monkey leaped
into the air and somersaulted all the way to the lair of the monster.
He used his magic to change the hairs on his body into thousands of
little monkeys. The tiny creatures kicked, punched, poked, pinched,
and pulverized the foul monster. Then Monkey gathered up the kid
napped children and flew them back to their delighted families.
After this glorious victory, Handsome Monkey King organized his
subjects into an army. He armed his troops with swords, spears,
battle-axes, and other weapons. But a great king and commander
like himself could not use a mere earthly weapon. It was time to take
another journey, this time through the water.
Reciting a spell and making a magic sign, the Monkey King parted
the waters of the Eastern Sea. He strolled all the way down to the mag
nificent palace of the Dragon King. The dragon welcomed his immortal
guest politely and offered him a variety of divine weapons. But Monkey

had come for the scaly king’s most valuable possession: the iron rod that
Yu the Great had used to measure the depths of the oceans.
With his mighty powers, Monkey plucked the gigantic rod from the
ocean floor. “Smaller!” he cried, and it turned into a tiny sewing nee
dle. The mischievous monkey tucked the needle behind his ear. He
helped himself to a priceless gold helmet and armor. “Sorry to have
bothered you!” he called to the outraged dragon, and he leaped back
out of the ocean.
A Journey to the Underworld
Handsome Monkey King strutted around his palace, showing off his
treasures. He pointed out the polish on his new gold helmet. He made
his iron weapon grow into a giant club and shrink back down to a lit
tle needle again. He howled with laughter as he described the way he
had outsmarted the king under the ocean. “O Father,” his awestruck
subjects cried, “you are as great as the gods in heaven!”
But the real gods were not so impressed. That insolent ape was becom
ing a nuisance! It was time to put an end to his constant troublemaking.
The gods got their chance at a splendid banquet honoring the
Monkey King’s triumphs. The tables were piled high with delicacies,
and the cups overflowed with wine. All the guests drank until they
rolled off their seats to doze under the tables. While Monkey was snor
ing, two grim-faced men appeared. Without a word they tied up the
king and dragged him down below the earth.
The hairy-faced prisoner reeled from side to side as his captors led
him to the entrance of a city. Raising his head, he saw the sign above
the gate: REGION OF DARKNESS. At that sight, Monkey was suddenly
wide-awake and sober.
81
The Monkey King



“Why have you brought me here?” he cried. “The Region of
Darkness is the domain of Yama, lord of death.”
“We were given a summons to arrest you,” the men grunted as they
tried to haul their prisoner into the city.
Now Monkey was really angry. He whipped out the needle from
behind his ear. Whack! His giant iron club reduced the two messengers
to hash. He charged into the city, and all the demons and ghost sol
diers fled at the sight of the fierce and angry warrior.
“Why did you send your men to arrest me? Don’t you know that I am
an immortal?” Monkey roared as he stomped into Yama’s throne room.
The king of the underworld eyed the iron club nervously. “Many
people have the same name. Perhaps there has been some mistake.”
Monkey tapped his club against the floor, making the walls of the
dark palace tremble. “Then get out your register of births and deaths,
and let’s see if we can fix this error,” he growled menacingly.
82 Th e A N C I E N T CH I N E S E
Yama’s dreaded underworld kingdom was a place of torment and punishment.



Quickly the official in charge of the records produced the register.
The Monkey King scanned the names until he came to this entry:
“Soul number 1350. Heaven-born Stone Monkey. Age: 342 years. A
peaceful death.”
Monkey called for a brush and ink. He blotted out his name. He
also crossed out the names of all his subjects. Throwing down the
ledger, he shouted, “That’s the end of my account! You have no
power over me now!’ Then the hairy-faced hero stormed out of the
Region of Darkness.
The and of the Buddha
The Jade Emperor sat on his throne, nursing a dreadful headache.
Complaints were coming in from the underworld, the Eastern Sea,
and nearly every other part of the universe. He had to find a way to
control that pesky Monkey!
At last the emperor came up with a plan. He would take advantage
of the Monkey King’s greatest weakness: his vanity. He would offer the
rascal a small but important-sounding post in heaven, where he could
keep an eye on him.
Monkey was thrilled when he received his appointment as Keeper
of the Heavenly Horses. He rose to heaven on a cloud and proudly
took up his duties. After a few days of mucking out the stables,
though, he began to suspect that the job was not really such an honor.
So the Jade Emperor gave Monkey an even more impressive title:
Guardian of the Garden of Immortal Peaches. The golden peaches
that grew in this garden gave eternal life to all those who ate them. It
took thousands of years for a new crop to ripen. When the fruit was
ready, the gods and goddesses celebrated with a grand banquet.
83
The Monkey King



84 Th e A N C I E N T CH I N E S E
Feasting on the sweet, juicy peaches,
they renewed their immortality.
As it happened, it was almost time
for the banquet. Monkey longed for a
taste of the ripe fruit that hung like balls
of gold from the branches. He climbed
up a tree and took a little bite.
Delicious! He picked another fruit and
ate it. One after another he gobbled up
every single peach in the garden.
Monkey’s crimes were soon discov
ered. The angry emperor condemned
him to death for his wickedness. But the
impudent character was doubly immortal
now, and there was no way to kill him.
In desperation the Jade Emperor
turned to the Buddha himself. The
immortal master journeyed to heaven.
He laughed when he heard about
Monkey’s antics. Taking the troublemaker into his hand, he asked, “Why
do you keep causing a commotion?”
“I am Handsome Monkey King!” boasted the little fellow. “I am
immortal. I can change into seventy-two different forms. One leap will
take me thousands of miles through the air. With my superior powers,
I should be the one sitting on the supreme throne of heaven.”
“I will make a wager with you,” laughed the Buddha. “If you can
jump clear of my palm, I will ask the Jade Emperor to yield his
throne. If not, you will go down to the earth and work harder to earn
your immortality.”
The greedy Monkey King feasted on the peaches of immortality.



Eagerly Monkey agreed to the bargain. With one giant leap, he
vanished into the clouds. He came down to earth far away, at the base
of five tall pink pillars. Producing
a magical brush, he wrote his
name on the smallest pillar. Then
he leaped into the air and soared
back to where he had started.
“When are you going to
begin?” asked the Buddha.
“What do you mean? I have
flown to the ends of the earth
and left a record of my visit. Would you like to go look at the place?”
“No need to go anywhere.” At that, Monkey looked down and saw
his name written on the base of the master’s little finger. “You see,”
said the Buddha, “the whole world lies in the palm of my hand. No
matter how far you fly, my hand is always beneath you.”
And so the Monkey King was defeated. But his adventures had just
begun. In the years that followed, he would travel to India with the
great Buddhist monk Xuan Zang. During their long journey, the com
panions would encounter many obstacles and overcome many deadly
perils. At last they would fulfill their mission, bringing the sacred
Buddhist scriptures back to China. And through his faithful service,
Monkey would achieve the greatest treasure of all: true enlightenment.

illustrate their particular points of view. As a result, there are usually
many variations of the same myth. The retellings in this book draw
from a variety of sources, including the ancient texts described below.
Pangu the Giant and Nü Gua the Serpent Goddess
The earliest surviving accounts of Pangu, the giant who
created heaven and earth, date back to the third century
CE. Among these are two books written by a scholar
named Xu Zheng: Historical Records of the Three Sovereign
Divinities and the Five Gods and A Chronicle of the Five Cycles
of Time. Xu Zheng may have adapted the Pangu myth from
ancient stories that came to the Middle Kingdom from Tibet and
central Asia.
The goddess Nü Gua is several centuries older than Pangu. She
first appears in an important mythological document known as Tian
wen, or “Questions of Heaven,” which was written around the
fourth century BCE. Over time the Nü Gua creation story gave way
to the male-dominated myth of Pangu.

A large body of myths describe the battles of Huang Di,
the Yellow Emperor. One of the most important written

SOURCES of the MYTHS
Yi the Archer and the Ten Suns
The divine archer Yi is one of China’s most popular mythi
cal heroes. Images of Yi shooting at the ten suns appear on
a number of ancient tomb sculptures, and the story is men
tioned in many myth-related texts. These include two major
Confucian texts: Analects, a collection of Confucius’s sayings
compiled shortly after his death in 479 BCE, and Mencius, a record of the
teachings of the fourth-century BCE Confucian scholar Mencius. The
Classic of Mountains and Seas is also an important source for this myth.
Yu Conquers the Great Flood
No other Chinese character has inspired more myths, legends, and
folktales than the hero Yu. The myth of Yu and the flood is found in
numerous texts dating as far back as the middle Zhou dynasty. Major
sources include: The Classic of Poetry, a collection of hymns and
poems compiled around 600 BCE; The Classic of History, a mytholog
ical record of the deeds and speeches of the Sage Kings and other
important beings; and Records of the Grand Historian, a 130-chapter
book written by the first-century BCE historian Sima Qian.
The Weaver Maid and the Cowherd
This famous myth has been known and loved in China for
centuries. The earliest known reference to the Weaver
Maid dates back more than 2,600 years, to a poem in The
Classic of Poetry. Later mythological texts began to link the
goddess and the cowherd romantically. During the twelfth century
CE, the historian Luo Yuan told the story in a book called Er ya yi, or
“Material Appended to the ‘Er ya [Dictionary].’” By that time, the
myth had been filled out with details including the purpose of the

Weaver Maid’s weaving, her identity as a star in the sky, and the rea
son behind the couple’s tragic separation.
The Monkey King
The adventures of the Monkey King are recounted in Xi You
Ji, or The Journey to the West. This famous novel was written in
the late sixteenth century CE, probably by a little-known
Chinese scholar named Wu Cheng’en. The book blends fact
and fiction to tell the story of the real-life pilgrimage of the monk
Xuan Zang, who journeyed to India in the seventh century CE and
brought the texts of the Buddha’s teachings back to China. The
monk’s most famous fictional companion was the Monkey King, also
known as Sun Wukong, or “Enlightened Monkey.” This mischievous
character became one of the most popular figures in Chinese culture.
Over the centuries Monkey’s story has been retold in books, plays,
operas, movies, TV programs, and cartoons.
