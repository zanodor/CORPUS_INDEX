On May 8th, 1920, The Timespublhhed an article on M Th8 Jewish Peril,*'5 which it called “ A Disturlgin^S^ Pamphlet: a Call for Enquiry.” Since then, in a series of articles commencing July 12, the Morning Post has published a very exhaustive “ enquiry,” under the title of “The World Unrest : Behind the Red Cur¬ tain The Protocols the ^writer very ®bly names “ The Bolshevist Of course, Jews, orthodox and unorthodox alike, have denied the authenticity of the Protocols, and have called them a forgery. But in that case the forger must have been a super-forger, and a Jew ; for no other forger could have been able not only to forge the prophecies, but also to secure their fulfilment! The facts are, unfortunately for us Goyim, anything but forgeries. As the Times c#n fail to recognise

The rapid exhaustion of the second edition of this work is r dence that the British branch of the Aryan Family of Nations ing at last. The terrible story published in the Times (Aug. 1 o 6) of the torture and murder by Jews of the Czar and his whole fa is an additional confirmation of the working out of the policy o “Leaimed Elders.” This is nothing less than the exterminatic
Christians and the destruction of Christian nationality. The war w a German war, it was a Jew war. There is only one nation whicl gainer by the war, and that is the Jew nation. Jewry has gained al the other nations have lost. Jewry has now got all the world in pa itself, and unless the White Races combine like the Jews and face common enemy, the Elders of Zion,—VAlliance Israelite Univei^Ue, the “Four Gentlemen of Frankfurt ” of the House of Rothschild

Jews fish in troubled waters, and it in no suits the plans of Jewry’s Elders to let any waters remain still. T fore J ewry must return to its own domain, with the Dead Sea fo natural and spiritual centre. There is no question that can arise bet Christian nations that cannot be equitably adjusted if Jews are a there is nothing that can be honestly settled if Jews are in any concerned.

A
T a moment when the whole of Western Europe is
enlarging upon the benefits of constitutional gov¬
ernments and discussing on the one hand the merits and
on the other the sins of Maximalism (Bolshevism), I think
that I may with advantage put before the English
speaking public, the translation of a book published at
Tsarskoye Sielo, in Russia, in the year 1905.
A copy of the original may be seen at the British
Museum Library, under No. 3926 d 17, stamped British
Museum, 10th August, 1906. How many more copies of
the book may be seen in the world, I can hardly say, as,
shortly after its appearance in 1905, most copies seem to
have been bought up simultaneously and apparently with
a purpose. On this point I would only warn my readers
>. that they must not take a copy of this translation to
Russia, as anybody in whose possession it is found by the
Bolsheviki is immediately shot, as being the bearer of
“ reactionary propaganda.”
The book u?as presented to the Russian public by
Professor Sergyei Nilus.
It contains :
(i) An introduction to the main text, written
by Sergyei Nilus in 1905.
(ii) Notes on lectures delivered to Jewish students
in Paris in the year 1901.
(iii) A portion. of an epilogue written by the
same Sergyei Nilus. I have not considered it
necessary to reproduce the whole of the epilogue,



••
11
as portions of it would be of no interest to
British public, and do not bear upon the ques
before me, namely, that of the Jewish Peril.
I would ask my readers to bear in mind that the lecti
above referred to were delivered in 1901, and that Nil
Introduction and Epilogue were written in 1905.
It is impossible to read any of the parts of this voli
to-day without being struck by the strong prophetic r
wiiich runs through them all, not only as regards the c
Holy Russia, but also as regards certain sinister devei
ments, which may be observed at the present mom
throughout the whole world.

Introduction.
I
*
A MANUSCRIPT has been handed to me by a personal
/v friend, now deceased, which with extraordinary
precision and clearness describes the plan and development
of a sinister world-wide conspiracy, having for its object
that of bringing the unregenerate World to its inevitable
dismemberment.
This document came into my possession some four
years ago (1901), with the positive assurance that it is a
true copy in translation, of original documents stolen by
a woman from one of the most influential and most highly
initiated leaders of Freemasonry.* The theft was accom¬
plished at the close of a secret meeting of the “ initiated ”
in France, that nest of “ Jewish masonic conspiracy/'
To those who would see and hear, I venture to reveal
this manuscript under the title of “ The Protocols of the
Elders of Zion." On first scanning through these minutes,
they might convey the impression of being what we
usually call truisms, and appear to be more or less ordinary
truths, though expressed with a pungency and a hatred
which does not usually accompany ordinary truths.
There seethes between the lines that arrogant and deep
rooted racial and religious hatred, which has been so long
successfully concealed, and it bubbles over and flows, as
it were, from an overfilled vessel of rage and revenge, fully
conscious that its triumphant end is near.
We cannot omit to remark that its title does not
altogether correspond to its contents. These are not
exactly minutes of meetings, but a report made by some

powerful person, divided into sections not always in a
logical sequence. They convey the impression of being
the part of something threatening and more important, the
beginning of which is missing. The aforementioned origin
of this document speaks for itself.
By the prophecies of the Holy Fathers, Anti-Christ’s
doings must always be a parody on Christ’s life, and must
have likewise their Judas. But, of course, from an earthly
point of view, its Judas will not achieve his ends; thus,
although of brief duration, a complete victory of the
“ world ruler ” is assured. This reference to W. Soloviev’s
words is not intended to be used as a proof of their
scientific authority. From an eschatological point of
view, science is out of place, the important part is fate.
Soloviev gives us the canvas, the embroidery will be
worked by the proposed manuscript.
We might be justly reproached with the apocryphal
nature of this document; but were it possible to prove
this world-wide conspiracy by means of letters or by
declarations of witnesses, and if its leaders could be
unmasked holding its sanguinary threads, the “ mysteries
of iniquity,” would by this very fact, be violated. To
prove itself, it has to remain unmolested till the day of
its incarnation in the “ son of perdition.”
In the present complications of criminal proceedings® %
we cannot look for direct proofs, but we have to be satisfied j
with circumstantial evidence, and with such the mind oi
every indignant Christian observer is filled.
That which is written in this work ought to suffice for;' J
those “ who have ears to hear ” as being obvious and is
offered them with the intention of urging them to protect
themselves while there is yet time, and to be on thew
guard. Our conscience will be satisfied if by the grace' a*

>d we attain this most important aim of warning the
:ntile world without exciting in its heart wrath against
e blinded people of Israel. We trust that the Gentiles
ill not entertain feelings of hatred against the erroneously
ilieving mass of Israel in its innocence of the Satanic
n of its leaders—the Scribes and Pharisees—who have
ready once proved themselves to be the destruction of
>rael. Turning aside the wrath of God, there remains
ut one way—union of all Christians in Our Lord Jesus
hrist and total extermination—repentance for ourselves
nd for others.
But is this possible in the present unregenerate condition
f the world? It is impossible for the world, but still
■ossible for believing Russia. The present political condi
ions of Western European states and of their affiliated
ountries in other continents were prophesied by the
'rince of Apostles. Mankind in its aspiration to perfect its
errestrial life and in its search of a better realisation of the
lea of power, which could secure everybody’s well-being,
nd in its quest of a reign of universal satiety, which has
ecome the highest ideal of human life, lias changed the
irection of its ideals by pronouncing the Christian faith
s entirely discredited and not having justified the hopes
estowed on it. Overthrowing former idols, creating new
nes, and raising new gods on to pedestals, the world erects
Dr them temples, one more luxurious and more magnificent
han the other, and again deposes and destroys them,
uankind has lost the very conception of the power granted
’y God to kings anointed, and is approaching the conditions
of anarchy. Soon the swivel of the republican and
'onstitutional scales will be worn through. The scales
'/ill collapse, and in their fall will carry away all the
;ovemments to the very abyss of raging anarchy.

The world’s last rampart and last refuge from the
coming storm is Russia. Her true faith is still alive, and
the anointed Emperor still stands as her sure protector.
All the efforts of destruction on the part of the sinister
and evident servants of the Anti-Christ, his conscious and
unconscious workers, are concentrated on Russia. The
reasons are understood, the objects are known, they must
be known to believing and faithful Russia. The more
threatening the coming historical moment is, the more
frightening the approaching events concealed in the dense
clouds are, the more courageously and with greater deter¬
mination the brave and intrepid hearts of the Russians
must beat. Bravely ought they to join hands round the
sacred banner of their Church and round the throne of
their Emperor. So long as the soul lives, so long also the
flaming heart beats in the bosom, there is no room for
the deathly spectre of despair; but it is for us, and for our
fidelity, to gain the Almighty’s mercy and to delay the
hour of Russia’s fall (1905).



Protocols of the Elders
of Zion.
/
E wall be plainspoken and discuss the significance
Y y of each reflection, and by comparisons and deduc¬
tions we will produce full explanations. By this means I
will expose the conception of our policy and that of the
Goys (i.e., Jewish definition of all Gentiles). It must be
noted that people with corrupt instincts art; more numerous
than those of noble instinct. Therefore in governing the
world the best results are obtained by means of violence
and intimidation, and not by academic discussions. Every
man aims at power; everyone wrould like to become a
dictator if he only could do so, and rare indeed are the
men wrho would not be disposed to sacrifice the welfare of
others in order to attain their own personal aims.
What restrained the wild beasts of prey wrhich we
call men ? What has ruled them up to now ? In the first
stages of social life they submitted to brute and blind
force, then to law, which in reality is the same force, only
masked. From this I am led to deduct that by the law
of nature, right lies in might. Political freedom is not a
fact, but an idea. This idea one must know how to apply
when it is necessary, in order to use the same as a bait to
attract the powrer of the populace to one’s party, if such
party has decided to usurp the power of a rival. The
problem is simplified if the said rival becomes infected
with ideas of freedom, so-called liberalism, and for the
sake of this idea yields some of his power.



2
In this the triumph of our idea will become apparent.
The relinquished reins of government by the law of life
are immediately seized by a new hand, because the blind
strength of the populace cannot exist for a single day
without a leader, and the new government only fills the
place of the old, which has been weakened by its liberalism.
Nowadays the power of gold has superseded liberal
rulers. There was a time when religion ruled. The idea
of freedom is not realisable, because no one knows how
to »se it with discretion.
It suffices to give the populace self-government
for a short period for this populace to become a
disorganised rabble. From that very moment dissensions
start which soon develop into social battles; the
States are set in flames and their total significance
vanishes. Whether the state is exhausted by its own
internal convulsions, or whether civil wars hand it over
to an external foe, it can in any case be considered as
definitely and finally destroyed—it will be in our power.
The despotism of capital, which is entirely in our hands, will
hold out to it a straw, to which the state will be unavoidably
compelled to cling; if it does not do so, it will inevitably
fall into the abyss.
Of anybody who might, from motives of liberalism, be
inclined to remark that discussions of this kind are
immoral, I would ask the question, why is it not immoral
for a state which has two enemies, one external and one
internal, to use different means of defence against the
former to that which it would use against the latter, to
make secret plans of defence, to attack him by night or
with superior forces? Why should it then be immoral
for the state to use these means against that which ruins
the foundations and welfare of its life?



3
Can a sound and logical mind hope successfully to
govern mobs by using arguments and reasoning, when
there is a possibility of such arguments and reasonings
biing contradicted by other arguments, although these
may possibly be ridiculous, but are made to appear more
attractive to that portion of the populace which cannot
think very deepl}^, guided as it is entirely by petty
passions, habits, and conventions, and by sentimental
theories? The uninitiated and ignorant populace, together
with those who have risen from among them, get entangled
in party dissensions which hinder all possibility of agree¬
ment even on a basis of sound arguments. Every decision
of the masses is dependent on a chance or prearranged
majority which, in its ignorance of political mysteries,
passes absurd resolutions, thus sowing the germs of anarchy
in the government.
Politics have nothing in common with morals. A ruler
governed by morals is not a skilled politician, hence he
is not firm on his throne. He who wants to rule must
have recourse to cunningness and hypocrisy. The great
human qualities of sincerity and honesty become vices in
politics. They dethrone with more certainty than the
bitterest enemy. These qualities have to be the attributes
of the Gentile countries, but we are not in the least forced
to be guided by them. Our right lies in might. The
word “ right is an abstract idea established by no tiling.
This word signifies no more than “ give me what I want
in order to enable me to prove thereby that I am stronger
than you are.”
Where does €i right ” begin? Where does it end? In
a state where power is badly organised, where the laws
and the personality of the ruler are rendered inefficacious
by the continual encroaching of liberalism, I take up a
A2



4
new line of attack, making use of the right of might to
destroy the existing rules and regulations, seize the laws,
reorganise all the institutions, and thus become the dictator
of those who, of their own free will, liberally renounced
their power and conferred it on us. Our strength under
the present shaky condition of the civil powers will be
stronger than any other, because it will be invisible till,
the moment when it becomes so strong that no cunning
v-x ^,7*
designs will undermine it.
From the temporary evil, to which we are now obliged
to have recourse, will emerge the benefit of an unshakable
rule, which will reinstate the course of the mechanism of
natural existence, which has been destroyed by liberalism.
The end justifies the means. In making our plans we
must pay attention not so much to what is good and moral,
as to what is necessary and profitable.
We have in front of us a plan in which a strategic line
is shown. From that line wre cannot deviate unless wre
are going to destroy the w7ork of centuries. To work out
a suitable scheme of action one must bear in mind the
meanness, instability, and wrant of ballast on the part of
the crowd, its incapability to understand and respect the
conditions of its own existence and of its owTn welfare.
One must understand that the might of the crowd is blind
and void of reason in discrimination, and that it lends its
ear right and left. If the blind lead the blind, they will
both fall together into the ditch. Consequently those
members of the crowed who are upstarts from the people,
even wrere they geniuses, cannot come fonvard as leaders
of the mass without ruining the nation. Only a person
brought up to autocratic sovereignty can read the words
formed by political letters. The people abandoned to
itself, i.e., to upstarts from the masses, is ruined by party



5
dissensions which arise from greed of power and honours
and which create disturbances and disorder.
Is it possible for the mass to discriminate quietly,
and without jealousies to administer the affairs of state,
which they must not confuse with their personal interests ?
Can they be a defence against a foreign foe? This is
impossible, as a plan broken up into as many parts as
there are minds in the mass loses its value, and therefore
becomes unintelligible and unworkable. Alone an autocrat
can conceive vast plans clearly assigning its proper part
to everything in the mechanism of the machine of state.
Hence v/e conclude that it is expedient for the welfare of
the country that the government of the same should be
in the hands of one responsible person. Without absolute
despotism civilisation cannot exist, for civilisation is
capable of being promoted only under the protection of
the ruler, whoever he may be, and not at the hands of the
masses.
The crowd is a barbarian, and acts as such on every
. *^ ^
occasion. As soon as the mob has secured freedom it
_\
speedily turns it into anarchy, which in itself is the height
cf barbarism.
Just look at these alcoholised animals stupefied by the
drink, of which unlimited use is tolerated by freedom !
Should we allow ourselves and our fellow creatures to do
likewise ? The people of the Christians, bewildered by
alcohol, their youths turned crazy by classics and early
debauchery, to which they have been instigated by our
agents, tutprs, servants, governesses in rich houses, clerks,
and so forth, by our women in places of their amusement
to the latter I add the so-called “ society women ”—their
voluntary followers in corruption and luxury. Our motto
must be " All means of force and hypocrisy/1



6
Only sheer force is victorious in politics, especially if
it is concealed in the talent indispensable for statesmen.
Violence must be the principle, cunning and hypocrisy
must be the rule of those Governments which do not v/ish
to lay down their crown at the feet of the agents of some
new power. This evil is the only means of attaining the
goal of good. Therefore, we must not stop short before
bribery, deceit and treachery, if these are to serve the
achievement of our cause.
In politics we must know how to confiscate property
without any hesitation, if by so doing we can attain
subjection and power. Our State, following the way of
peaceful conquest, has the right of substituting for the
terrors of war executions, less apparent and more ex¬
pedient, which are necessary to uphold terror, producing
blind submission. Just and implacable severity is the
chief factor in State power. Not onfy for the sake of
advantage, but also for that of duty and victory, we must
keep to the programme of violence and hypocrisy. Our
principles are as powerful as the means by which we put
them into execution. That is why not only by these
very means, but by the severity of our doctrines, we shall
triumph and shall enslave all Governments under our
super-Government. It suffices that it should be known
that we are implacable in preventing recalcitrance. Even
of old we were the first to cry out to the people,
“ Liberty, equality, and fraternity/’ Words so often
repeated since that time by ignorant parrots flocking
together from far and wide round these signposts; by
repeating them they deprived the world of its prosperity
and the individual of his real personal freedom, which
formerly had been so well guarded from being choked by
the mob.



7
The would-be wise and intelligent Gentiles did not
discern how abstract were the words which they were
uttering, and did not notice how little these words agreed
with one another and even contradicted each other.
They did not see that in Nature there is no equality
and that she herself created different and unequal standards
of mind, character and capacity. It is likewise with the
subjection to Nature’s laws. These wiseacres did not
divine that the mob is a blind power, and that the upstarts
elected from its midst as rulers are likewise blind in
politics; that a man intended to be a ruler, although a
fool, can govern, but that a man who has not been so
intended, although he might be a genius, would understand
nothing of politics. All this was left out of sight by the
Gentiles. At the same time, it was on this basis that
dynastic rule was founded. The father used to instruct
the son in the meaning and in the course of political
evolutions in such a manner that no one except the
members of the dynasty should have knowledge of it,
and that none could disclose the secrets to the governed
people. In time, the meaning of true political teachings
as transmitted in dynasties from one generation to another
was lost, and this loss contributed to the success of our
cause. Our call of “ Liberty, equality, and fraternity ”
brought whole legions to our ranks from all four corners
of the world through our unconscious agents, and these
legions earned our banners with ecstacy. In the mean¬
time these words were eating, like so many worms, into
the well being of the Christians and were destroying their
peace, steadfastness and unity, thus ruining the founda
tions of the States. As we shall see later on, it was this
action which brought about our triumph. It gave us the
possibility among other things of playing the ace of



8
trumps—namely, the abolition of privileges; in other
words, the existence of the Gentile aristocracy, which was
the only protection nations and countries had against
ourselves. On the ruins of natural and hereditary aristo¬
cracy we built an aristocracy of our own on a plutocratic
basis. We established this new aristocracy on wealth, of
which we had control, and on science promoted by our
scholars. Our triumph was rendered easier by the fact
that we, through our connections with people who were
indispensable to us, always worked upon the most
susceptible part of the human mind, namely, by playing
on our victims’ weakness for profits, on their greed, on
their insatiability, and on the material requirements of
man; for each one of the said weaknesses, taken by itself,
is capable of destroying initiative, thus handing over the
will-power of the people to the mercy of those who would
deprive them of all their power of initiative. The
abstractness of the word “freedom” made it possible to
convince the mob that the government is nothing else
than a manager, representing the owner, that is to say,
the nation, and can be discarded like a worn-out pair of
gloves. The fact that the representatives of the nation
can be deposed delivered these representatives into our
power and practically put their appointment into our
hands.
**❖**

It is indispensable for our purpose that wars should
not produce any territorial alterations. Thus, without
territorial modifications, war would be transferred on to
an economical footing. Then nations will recognise our
superiority in the assistance which we shall render, and
this state of affairs will put both sides at the mercy of our



9
international million-eyed agents, who are possessed of
absolutely unlimited means. Then our international rights
will sweep away the laws of the world and will rule
countries in the same manner as individual governments
rule their subjects.
We will select administrators from among the public,
who will be possessed of servile tendencies. They will not
be experienced in the art of government and therefore
will be easily turned into pawns in our game in the hands
of our learned and wise counsellors, who have been
especially trained from early childhood for governing the
world. As is already known to you, these men have
studied- the science of governing from our political plans,
from experience of history and from observation of passing
events. The Gentiles do not profit by continuous historical
observations, but follow theoretical routine without con¬
templating what the results of the same may be. Therefore
we need not take the Gentiles into consideration. Let
them enjoy themselves until the time comes, or let them
live in hopes of new amusements or on the reminiscences
of passed joys. Let them think that these lawrs of theory,
with which we have inspired them, are of supreme import¬
ance to them. With this object in view, and with the
help of our press, we continually increase their blind faith
in these laws. The educated classes of the Gentiles will
pride themselves in their learning and, without verifying
it, they will put into practice the knowiedge obtained from
science which was dished up to them by our agents with
the object of educating their minds in the direction which
wc required.
Do not imagine that our assertions are empty wrords.
Note here the success of Darwin, Marx and Nietsche pre¬
arranged by us. The demoralising effect of the tendencies



10
of these sciences on the Gentile mind should certainly be
obvious to us.
In order to refrain from making mistakes in our policy
and administrative work, it is essential for us to study and
bear in mind the present line of thought, the characters
and tendencies of nations.
The triumph of our theory is its adaptability to the
temperament of the nations with which we come in
contact. It cannot be successful if its practical applica¬
tion is not based on the experience of the past in con¬
junction with observations of the present. The press in
the hands of existing governments is a great power, by
which the control of peoples' minds is obtained. The
press demonstrates the vital claims of the populace,
advertises complaints and sometimes creates discontent
among the mob. The realisation of free speech is born in
the press. But governments did not know how to make
proper use of this power, and it fell into our hands.
Through the press we achieved influence, although we
ourselves kept in the background. Thanks to the press
we accumulated gold, though it cost us streams of blood :
it cost us the sacrifice of many of our people, but every
sacrifice on our side is worth thousands of Gentiles before
God. ‘ * ,

To-day I can assure you that we are only within a
few strides of our goal. There remains only a short
distance and the cycle of the Symbolic Serpent—that
badge of our people—will be complete. When this circle
is locked, all the States of Europe will be enclosed in it,
as it were, by unbreakable chains.
The existing constructional scales will soon collapse
because we are continually throwing them out of balance



TI
in order the more quickly to wear them out and destroy
their efficiency.
The Gentiles thought that the scales had been made
sufficiently strong and expected them to balance accurately.
But the supporters of the scales—that is to say, the heads
of States—are hampered by their servants who are of no
avail to them, drawn away as they are by this unlimited
power of intrigue which is theirs, thanks to the terrors
prevailing in the palaces.
As the sovereign has no means of access to the hearts
of his people, he cannot defend himself against the power
loving intriguers. As the watchful power has been
separated by us from the blind power of the populace,
both have lost their significance, because once parted
they are as helpless as a blind man without a stick. In
order to induce lovers of power to make a bad use of their
rights, we set all powers one against the other by
encouraging their liberal tendencies towards independence.
We encouraged every undertaking in this direction; we
placed formidable weapons in the hands of all parties
and made power the goal of every ambition. Out of
governments we made arenas- on which party wars are
fought out. Soon open disorder and bankruptcy will
appear everywhere. Insuppressable babblers transformed
parliamentary and administrative meetings into debating
meetings. Audacious journalists and impudent pam¬
phleteers are continually attacking the administrative
powers. Abuse of power will definitely prepare the crash
of all institutions and everything will fall prostrate under
the blows of the raging populace. The people are enslaved
in the sweat of their brows in poverty after a manner more
formidable than the laws of serfdojn. From the latter
they could free themselves by some means or another.



12
whereas nothing will liberate them from the tyranny of
absolute want. We took care to insert rights in constitu¬
tions which for the masses are purely fictitious. All the
so-called “ rights of the people ” can only exist in ideas
which are not applicable in practice. How does it avail a
workman of the proletariat, who is bent double by hard
■work and oppressed by his fate, if a chatterer gets the
right to speak or a journalist the right to publish any
kind of rubbish? What good is a constitution to the
proletariat if they get no other advantage from it except
the crumbs which we throw them from our table in return
for their votes to elect our agents? Republican rights
are an irony for the pauper, for the necessity of every
day’s labour keeps him from gaining any advantage by
such rights and it only takes avray the guarantee of
continuous fixed wages, making him dependent on strikes,
employers and comrades. Under our auspices the popu¬
lace exterminated the aristocracy which had supported
and guarded the people for its own benefit, which benefit
is inseparable from the welfare of the populace. Now¬
adays, having destroyed the privileges of the aristocracy,
the people fall under the yoke of cunning profiteers and
upstarts.
We intend to appear as though we were the liberators
of the labouring man, come to free him from this
oppression, when we shall suggest to him to join the ranks
of our armies of Socialists, Anarchists^ and Communists.
The latter we always patronise, pretending to help them
cut of fraternal principle and the general interest of
humanity evoked by our socialistic masonry. The aristo¬
cracy, who by right shared the labour of the working
classes, were interested in the same being well-fed, healthy
and strong. We are interested in the opposite, i.e., in the



V
13
degeneration of the Gentiles. Our strength lies in keeping
the working man in perpetual want and impotence;
because, by so doing, we retain him subject to our will
and, in his own surroundings, he will never find either
power or energy to stand up against us. Hunger will confer
upon Capital more powerful rights over the labourer than
ever the lawful power of the sovereign could confer upon
the aristocracy.
We govern the masses by making use of feelings of
jealousy and hatred kindled by oppression and need.
And by means of these feelings we brush aside those who
impede us in our course.
When the time comes for our Worldly Ruler to be
crowned, we will see to it that by the same means—that
is to say, by making use of the mob—we will destroy
everything that may prove to be an obstacle in our way.
The Gentiles are no longer capable of thinking without
our aid in matters of science. That is why they do not
realise the vital necessity of certain things, which we will
make a point of keeping against the moment when our
hour arrives—namely, that in schools the only true and
the most important of all sciences must be taught, that is,
the science of the life of man and social conditions, both
of which require a division of labour and therefore the
classification of people in castes and classes. It is imper¬
ative that every one should know that true equality
cannot exist owing to the different nature of various kinds
of work, and those who act in a manner detrimental to
a whole caste have a different responsibility before the
law to those who commit a crime only affecting their
personal honour.
The true science of social conditions, to the secrets of
which we do not admit the Gentiles, would convince the



14
world that occupations and labour should be kept in
specified castes so as not to cause human suffering, arising
from an education which does not correspond with the
work which individuals are called upon to do. If they
were to study this science, the people would of their own
free will submit to the ruling powers and to the castes of
government classified by them. Under the present condi¬
tions of science and the line which we have allowed it to
follow, the populace, in its ignorance, blindly believes in
printed words and in erroneous illusions which have been
duly inspired by us, and it bears malice to all classes which
it thinks higher than itself. For it does not understand
the importance of each caste. This hatred will become
still more acute where economical crises are concerned, for
then it will stop the markets and production. We will
create a universal economical crisis, by all possible under¬
hand means and with the help of gold, which is all in our
hands. Simultaneously we will throw on to the streets
huge crowds of workmen throughout Europe. These
masses will then gladly throw themselves upon and shed
the blood of those of whom, in their ignorance, they have
been jealous from childhood, and whose belongings they
will then be able to plunder.
They will not harm us, because the moment of the
attack will be known to us and we will take measures to
protect our interests.
We persuaded the Gentiles that liberalism would bring
them to a kingdom of reason. Our despotism will be of
this nature, for it will be in a position to put down all
rebellions and by just severity to exterminate every liberal
idea from all institutions.
When the populace noticed that it was being given all
sorts of rights in the name of liberty, it imagined itself to



15
\
be the master, and tried to assume power. Of course, like
every other blind man, the mass came up against innu¬
merable obstacles. Then, as it did not wish to return to
the former regime, it lay its power at our feet. Remember
the French Revolution, which we call the “ Great,” the
secrets of its. preparatory organisation are well known to
us, being the work of our hands. From that time onwards
we have led nations from one disappointment to another,
so that they should even renounce us in favour of the
King-Despot of the blood of Zion, whom we are preparing
for the world. At present we, as an international force,
are invulnerable, because, whilst we are attacked by one
Gentile government, we are upheld by others. In their
intense meanness the Christian peoples help our independ¬
ence—when kneeling they crouch before power; when
they are pitiless towards the weak; merciless in dealing
with faults and lenient to crimes; when they refuse to
recognise the contradictions of freedom; when they are
patient to the degree of martyrdom in bearing with the
violence of an audacious despptism.
At the hands of their present dictators, premiers and
ministers, they endure abuses, for the smallest of which
they would have murdered twenty kings. How is this
state of affairs to be explained ? Why are the masses so
illogical in their conception of events? The reason is,
that despots persuade the people through their agents,
that, although they may misuse their power and do injury to
the state, this injury is done with a high purpose, i.e., in
order to attain prosperity for the populace, for the sake of
international fraternity, unity and equality.
Certainly they do not tell them that such unification
can only be obtained under our rule. So we see the
populace condemning the innocent, and acquitting the



16
guilty, convinced that it can always do what it pleases..
Owing to this state of mind the mob destroys all solidity
and creates disorder at every turn and corner. The word
“ liberty ” brings society into conflict with all the powers,
even with that of Nature and of God. That is why, when
we come into power, we must strike the word “ liberty ”
out of the human dictionary, as being the symbol of
beastial power, which turns the populace into blood¬
thirsty animals. But we must bear in mind that these
animals fall asleep as soon as they are satiated with blood,
and at that moment it is easy to enchant and enslave
them. If they are not given blood, they will not sleep,
but will fight with one another.
$ ❖❖
Every republic passes through various stages. The
first stage is the first days raging of the blind,
sweeping and destroying right and left. The second, the
reign of the demagogue, bringing forth anarchy and
entailing despotism. This despotism is not officially legal,
and, therefore, irresponsible; it is concealed and invisible,
but, all the same, lets itself be felt. It is generally
controlled by some secret organisation, which acts behind
the back of some agent, and will, therefore, be the more
unscrupulous and daring. This secret power will not
mind changing its agents who mask it. The changes will
even help the organisation, which will thus be able to rid
itself of old servants, to whom it would have been
necessary to pay larger bonuses for long service. Who or
what can dethrone an invisible power? Now this is just
what our government is. The masonic lodge throughout
the wrorld unconsciously acts as a mask for our purpose.
But the use that we are going to make of this power in



I7
our plan of action, and even our headquarters, remain
perpetually unknown to the world at large.
Liberty could be harmless and exist in governments
and countries without being detrimental to the welfare of
the people, if it were based on religion and fear of God,
on human fraternity, free from ideas of equality, which
are in direct contradiction to the laws of creation, and
which have ordained submission.
Governed by such a faith as this, the people would
be ruled under the guardianship of their parishes, and
would exist quietly and humbly under the guidance of
the spiritual pastor, and submit to God’s disposition on
earth. That is why we must extract the very conception
of God from the minds of the Christians and replace it by
arithmetical calculations and material needs. In order to
T-- > — <■ ' ' *. "
divert the minds of the Christians from our policy, it is
essential that we should keep them occupied with trade
and commerce. Thus all nations will be striving for their
own profits, and in this universal struggle will not notice
their common enemy. But, so that liberty should entirely
dislocate and ruin the social life of the Gentiles, we must
put commerce on a speculative basis. The result of this
will be, that the riches of the land extracted by production
will not remain in the hands of the Gentiles, but will pass
through speculation into our coffers.
The struggle for superiority and continuous specula¬
tions in the business world will create a demoralised,
selfish and heartless society. This society will become
completely indifferent and even disgusted by religion and
politics. Lust of gold will be their only guide. And this
society will strive after this gold, making a veritable cult
of the materialistic pleasures with which it can keep them
supplied. ; Then the lower classes will join us against our
B



competitors—the privileged Gentiles—with no pretence to
a noble motive, or even for the sake of riches, but out of
pure hatred towards the upper classes.
* * ***
What kind of government can one give to societies in
which bribery and corruption have penetrated everywhere,
where riches can only be obtained by cunning surprises
and fraudulent means, in which dissensions continuously
prevail; where morality must be supported by punish¬
ment and strict laws, and not by voluntary accepted
principles, in which patriotic and religious feelings are
merged in cosmopolitan convictions ?
What form of government can be given to these
societies other than the despotic form, which I will
describe to you?
We wall organise a strong centralised government, so
as to gain social powers for ourselves. By new7 lav/s wre
will regulate the political life of our subjects, as though
they were so many parts of a machine. Such laws will
gradually restrict all freedom and liberties allowed by the
Gentiles. Thus our reign will develop into such a mighty
despotism, that it will be able at any time or place to
squash discontented or recalcitrant Gentiles.
We shall be told that the kind of despotism which I
suggest will not suit the actual progress of civilisation,
but I will prove to you that the contrary is the case. In
the days when the people looked on their sovereigns as
on the will of God, they quietly submitted to the despotism
of their monarchs. But from the day that we inspired
the populace with the idea of its own rights, they began
to regard kings as ordinary mortals. In the eye of the
mob the holy anointment fell from the head of monarchs,
and, wdien wre took away their religion, the powrer was



■i9
thrown into the streets like public property, and was
snatched up by us. Moreover, among our administrative
gifts, we count also that of ruling the masses and
individuals by means of cunningly constructed theories
and phraseology, by rules of life and every other kind of
device. All these theories, which the Gentiles do not at
all understand, are based on analysis and observation,
combined with so skilful a reasoning as cannot be equalled
by our rivals, any more than these can compete with us
in the construction of plans for political actions and
solidarity. The only society known to us which would be
capable of competing with us in these arts, might be that
of the Jesuits. But we have managed to discredit these
in the eyes of the stupid mob as being a palpable
organisation, whereas we ourselves have kept in the
background, reserving our organisation as a secret.
Moreover, what difference will it make to the world
who is to become its master, whether the head of the
Catholic Church, or a despot of the blood of Zion ?
But to us, “ the Chosen People/' the matter cannot
be indifferent. For a time the Gentiles might perhaps
be able to deal with us. But on this account we need
fear no danger, as we are safeguarded by the deep
roots of their hatred for one another, which cannot be
extracted.
We set at variance with one another all personal and
national interests of the Gentiles, by promulgating religious
and tribal prejudices among them, for nearly twenty
centuries. To all this, the fact is due that not one single
government will find support from its neighbours when it
calls upon them for it, in opposing us, because each one
of them will think that action against us might be
disastrous for its individual existence. We are too
li 2



20
powerful—the world has to reckon with us. Governments
cannot make even a small treaty without our being
secretly involved in it. “ Per me reges regunt ”—let
kings reign through me. We read in the Law of the
Prophets that we have been chosen by God to rule the
earth. God gave us genius, in order that we should be
*
capable of performing this work. Were there a genius
in the enemy’s camp he might yet fight us, but a newcomer
would be no match for old hands like ourselves, and the
struggle between us would be of such a desperate nature
as the world has never yet seen. It is already too late
for their genius. All the wheels of state-mechanism are
set in motion by a power, which is in our hands, that is
to say—gold.
The science of political economy, thought out by our
learned scientists, has already proved that the power of
capital is greater than the prestige of the Crown.
Capital, in order to have a free field, must obtain
absolute monopoly of trade and commerce. This is already
being achieved by an invisible hand in all parts of the
world. Such a freedom will give political power to traders,,
who, by profiteering, will oppress the populace.
Nowadays it is more important to disarm the people
than to lead them to war. It is more important to use
burning passions for our cause, than to extinguish them;
to encourage the ideas of others and use them for our own
purpose, than to dissipate them. The main problem for
our government is : how to weaken the brain of the public
by criticism, how to make it lose its power of reasoning,
which creates opposition, and how to distract the public
mind by senseless phraseology.
At all times nations, as well as individuals, have taken
words for deeds, as they are contented with what they



21
hear, and seldom notice whether the promise has been actu¬
ally fulfilled. Therefore, simply for the purpose of show,
we will organise institutions, members of which, by eloquent
speeches, will prove and praise their contributions to
“ progress/'
We will assume a liberal appearance for all parties
and for all tendencies, and will provide all our orators
with one. These orators will be so loquacious, that they
will weary the people with speeches to such a degree, that
the people will have more than enough of oratory of any
kind.
In order to secure public opinion, this must first be
made utterly confused by the expression from all sides of
all manner of contradictory opinions, until the Gentiles
become lost in their labyrinth. Then they will understand
that the best course to take is to have no opinion on
political matters—matters which are not intended to be
understood by the public, but which should only be
reserved to the directors of affairs. This is the first
secret.
The second secret, necessary for our successful govern¬
ing, consists in multiplying to such an extent the faults,
habits, passions, and conventional laws of the country,
that nobody will be able to think clearly in the chaos
therefore men will cease to understand one another.
This policy will also help us to sow dissensions amongst
all parties, to dissolve all collective powers, and to
discourage all individual initiative, which might in any way
hinder our schemes.
There is nothing more dangerous than personal-initia¬
tive : if there are brains at the back of it, it may do more
harm to us than the millions of people whom we have
set at one another’s throats.



n^
We must direct the education of Christian societies in
such a way, that in all cases where initiative is required
for an enterprise, their hands should drop in hopeless
despair. Tension, brought about by freedom of action,
loses force when it encounters the freedom of others.
Hence come—moral shocks, disappointments and failures.
By all these means we will so oppress the Christians that
they will be forced to ask us to govern them inter¬
nationally. When wre attain such a position we shall be
able, straightway, to absorb all powers of governing
throughout the whole world, and to form a universal Super¬
government. In the place of existing governments we
will place a monster, which will be called the Administration
of the Supergovernment. Its hands will be outstretched
like far-reaching pinchers, and it will have such an
f organisation at its disposal, that it will not possibly be
able to fail in subduing all countries. Soon w'e will start
9
organising great monopolies—reservoirs of colossal wealth,
in wilich even the large fortunes of the Gentiles will be
involved to such an extent that they will sink together
with the credit of their government the day after the
political crisis takes place.*
Those among you who are present here to-day, and
are economists, just calculate the importance of this
scheme !
We must use every possible kind of means to develop
the popularity of our Supergovernment, holding it up as a
protection and recompenser of all vrho willingly submit
to us.
•5 The aristocracy of the Gentiles, as a political power, is
no more,—therefore we need not consider it any more from
- —■■ - ----F-
* It being evidently intended that the Jews should withdraw
their money at the last moment.



23
that point of view. But as landowners they arc still
dangerous to us, ..because their independent existence is
ensured through their resources. Therefore it is essential
for us, at all costs, to deprive the aristocracy of their
lands. To attain this purpose the best method is to force
up rates and taxes. These methods will keep the landed
interests at their lowest possible ebb. The aristocrats of
the Gentiles, who, by the tastes which they have inherited,
are incapable of being contented with a little, will soon be
- ruined.
At the same time we must give all possible protection
to trade and commerce, and especially to speculation,
the principal role of which is to act as a counterpoise to
industry.
Without speculation industry will enlarge private
capitals and will tend to raise agriculture b / freeing the
land from debt and mortgages, advanced by agricultural
banks. It is essential that industry should drain the land
of all its riches,and speculati on should deliver all the
world's wealth thus procured into our hands. By this
means all the Gentiles would be thrown into the ranks of
the proletariat. Then the Gentiles will bow down before
us, in order to obtain the right to exist.
In order to ruin the industry of the Gentiles and to
help speculation, we will encourage the love for boundless
luxury, which we have already developed. We will
increase the wages, which will not help the workmen, as
at the same time we will raise the price of prime
necessities, taking as a pretext the bad results of agri¬
culture. We will also artfully undermine the basis of
production by sowing seeds of anarchy amongst the
workmen, and encouraging them in the drinking of spirits.
At the same time we will use all possible means to drive



24
all the Gentile intelligence from the land. In order that
the true position of affairs should not be prematurely
realised by the Gentiles, we will conceal it by an apparent
desire to help the working classes in solving great economical
problems, the propaganda of which our economical theories
are assisting; in every possible way.
% »{* ❖ s|J %
Intensified military service and the increase of the
police force are essential to complete the above mentioned
plans. It is essential for us to arrange that, besides
ourselves, there should be in all countries nothing but a
huge proletariat, so many soldiers and police loyal to
our cause.
In the whole of Europe, and with the help of Europe,
we must promote on other continents sedition, dissensions
and mutual hostility. In this there is a twofold advantage :
firstly by these means we command the respect of all
countries, who well know that we have the power to create
upheavals at will, or else to restore order. All countries
are used to look to us for the necessary pressure, when
such is required. Secondly, by intrigues we shall entangle
all the threads spun by us in the ministries of all govern¬
ments not only by our politics, but by trade conventions and
financial obligations.
In order to obtain these ends we must have recourse
to much slyness and artfulness during negotiations and
agreements, but in what is called official language ” we
shall assume the opposite tactics of appearing honest and
amenable. Thus the governments of the Gentiles, which
we taught to look only on the showy side of affairs, as we
present these to them, will even look upon us as benefactors
and saviours of humanity.



25
We must be in a position to meet every opposition
with a declaration of war on the part of the neighbouring
country of that state which dares to stand in our way;
but if such neighbours in their turn were to decide to
unite in opposing us, we must respond by creating a
universal war.
The main success in politics consists in the degree of
secrecy employed in pursuing it. The action of a diplomat
must not correspond with his words. To help our world¬
wide plan, which is nearing its desired end, we must
influence the governments of the Gentiles by so-called
public opinions, in reality prearranged by us by means of
that greatest of all powers—the press, which, with a few
insignificant exceptions not worth taking into account,
is entirely in our hands.
Briefly, in order to demonstrate our enslavement of
the Gentile governments in Europe, we will show our
power to one of them by means of crimes of violence, that is
to say by a reign of terror ;* and in case they all rise
against us we will respond with American, Chinese or
Japanese guns.
&* * * * *
OWe must secure all instruments which our enemies •
might turn against us. We shall have recourse to the
most intricate and complicated expressions of the dictionary
of law in order to acquit ourselves in case we are forced
to give decisions, which may seem overbold and unjust.
For it will be important to express such decisions in so
forcible a manner, that they should seem to the populace
to be of the highest moral, equitable and just nature.
Our government must be surrounded by all the powers of
civilisation among wrhich it will have to act. It will draw
* Note the present state of Russia.
&



26
to itself publicists, lawyers, practitioners, administrators*
diplomats, and finally people prepared in our special
advanced schools. These people will know the secrets of
social life; they will master all languages put together by
political letters and words; they will be well acquainted
with the inner side of human nature, with all its most
sensitive strings, on which they will have to play. These
strings form the construction of the Gentile brain, their
good and bad qualities, their tendencies and vices, the
peculiarity of castes and classes. Of course these wise
counsellors of our might to whom I allude will not be
selected from amongst the Gentiles, who are used to carry
on their administrative work without bearing in mind the
results which they have to achieve, and without knowing
for what purpose these results are required. The adminis¬
trators of the Gentiles sign papers without reading them,
and serve for love of money or ambition.
We will surround our government by a whole host of
economists. That is the reason why science of economy
is the principal subject taught to the Jews. We will
be surrounded by thousands of bankers, traders, and, what
is still more important, by millionaires, because in reality
everything will be decided by money. Meanwhile, as
long as it is not yet safe to fill government posts with
our brother Jews, we will entrust these important posts
to people whose record and characters are so bad as to
form a gulf between the nation and themselves, and to
such people who, in case they disobey our orders, may
expect judgment and imprisonment. And all this is
with the object that they should defend our interests
until the last breath has passed out of their bodies.
Applying our principles, pay special attention to the
character of the particular nation, by which you are



27
surrounded and amongst which you have to work. You
must not expect to be successful in applying our principles
all round until the nation in question has been re-educated
by our doctrines; but by proceeding carefully in the
application of our principles you will discover that, before
ten years have elapsed, the most stubborn character will
have changed and we shall have added yet another
nation to the ranks of those who have already submitted
to us.
For the liberal words of our masonic motto, “ fr eedom,
equality, and fraternity/' we will substitute not the words
of our motto, but words expressing simply an idea, and
we will say “ the right of freedom, the duty of equality,
and the idea of fraternity/' and we shall have the bull
by the horns. As a matter of fact we have already
destroyed all ruling powers except our own, but in theory
they still exist. At the present time, if any governments
make themselves objectionable to us, it is only a formality,
and undertaken with our full knowledge and consent, as we
need their anti-Semitic outbursts in order to enable us
to keep our small brothers in order. I will not enlarge
upon this point, for it has already formed the subject of
many discussions.
As a matter of fact we are encountered by no opposition.
Our government is in so exceedingly strong a position in
the sight of the law that we may almost describe it by
the powerful expression of dictatorship. I can honestly
say that at the present time we are legislators, we sit in
judgment and inflict punishments, we execute and pardon,
we are, as it were, the commander-in-chief of all armies,
riding at their head. We rule by mighty force, because
in our hands remain the fragments of a once powerful
party, now under our subjection. We possess boundless



28
ambitions, devouring greed, merciless revenge and intense
hatred. We are the source of a far-reaching terror. We
employ in our service people of all opinions and all parties :
men desiring to reestablish monarchies, socialists, com¬
munists, and supporters of all kinds We
have put them all into harness; each one of them in his
own way undermines the remnant of power and tries to
destroy all existing laws. By this procedure all govern¬
ments are tormented, they yell for rest and, for the sake
of peace, are prepared to make any sacrifice. But we
will not give them any peace until they humbly recognise
our international super-government.
■v
The populace clamoured for the necessity of solving
the social problem by international means. Dissensions
among parties handed these over to us, because in order
to conduct an opposition money is essential, and money is
under our control.
We have feared the alliance of the experienced Gentile
sovereign power with that of the blind power of the mob,
but all measures to prevent the possibility of such an
occurrence have been taken by us. Between these two
powers we have erected a wall in the form of the terror
which they entertain for one another. Thus the blind
power of the populace remains a support on our side. We
alone will be its leaders, and will guide it towards the
attainment of our object. In order that the hand of the
blind should not free itself from our grip, we must be in
constant contact with the masses if not personally, at
any rate through our most faithful brothers. When we
become a recognised power we will personally address the
populace in the market places, and will instruct it in
political matters in whatever direction may suit our
convenience.



29
How are we to verify what the people are taught in
country schools? But it is certain that what is said by
the envoy of the government, or by the sovereign himself,
cannot fail to be known to the whole nation, as it is soon
spread by the voice of the people.
In order not to destroy the institutions of the Gentiles
prematurely, we reached them with our experienced hand
and secured the ends of the springs in their mechanism.
The latter formerly were in severe but just order; for
them we have substituted disorderly liberal management.
We have had a hand in jurisdiction, electioneering, in
the management of the press, in furthering the liberty
of the individual, and, what is still more important, in
education, which constitutes the main support of free
existence.
We have befooled and corrupted the rising generation
of the Gentiles by educating them in principles and
theories known to us to be thoroughly false, but which
we ourselves have inculcated. Without actually amending
the laws already in force, but by simply distorting them
and by placing interpretations upon them which were not
intended by those who framed them, we have obtained
an extraordinarily useful result.
These results became at first apparent by the fact that
our interpretation concealed the real meaning of the laws,
and subsequently rendered them so unintelligible that it
was impossible for the government to disentangle such a
confused code of laws.
Hence the theory arose of not adhering to the letter
of the law, but of judging by conscience. It is contended
that nations can rise in arms against us if our plans are
discovered prematurely; but in anticipation of this we
can rely upon throwing into action such a formidable force



30
as will make even the bravest of men shudder. By then
metropolitan railways and underground passages will be
constructed in all cities. From these subterranean places
we will explode all the cities of the world, together with
their instit itions and documents.*
H* H* He #
iy To-day I will begin by repeating what has been previously
mentioned, and I beg all of you to bear in mind that
in politics, governments and nations are satisfied by the
showy side of everything; yes, and how should they have
time to examine the inner side of things when their repre¬
sentatives only think of amusements ?
It is most important for our politics to bear in mind
the above-mentioned detail, as it will be of great help to
us, when discussing such questions as the distribution of
power, freedom of speech, freedom for the press and
religion, rights of forming associations, equality in the
sight of the law, inviolability of property and domicile, the
question of taxation (idea of secret taxation) and the
retrospective force of lav/s. All similar questions are of
such a nature that it is not advisable to openly discuss them
in front of the populace. But in cases where it is imperative
that these should be mentioned to the mob they must not
be enumerated but, without going into detail, statements
should be made concerning the principles of modern
right as recognised by us. The importance of reticence
lies in the fact that a principle which has not been
openly declared leaves us freedom of action, whereas
such a principle, once declared, becomes as good as
established.
The nation holds the powder of a political genius in
special respect and endures all its high-handed actions, and
* Probably figurative, referring to such means as Bolshevism.



thus regards them : “ What a dirty trick, but how skilfully
executed ! ” “ What a swindle, but how well and with
what courage it has been done ! ”
We count on attracting all nations to work on the
construction of the foundations of the new edifice which
has been planned by us. For this reason it is necessary
for us to acquire the services of bold and daiing a.gents,
who will be able to overcome all obstacles in the way of
our progress.
When we accomplish our coup d’etat, we will say to the
people : “ Everything has been going very badly; all of
you have suffered; now we are destroying the cause of
your sufferings, that is to say, nationalities, frontiers and
national currencies. Certainly you will be free to condemn
us, but can your judgment be fair if you pronounce it
before you have had experience of what we can do for
your good ? ”
Then they will carry us shoulder high in triumph, in
hope and in exultation. Power of voting, in which we
trained the most insignificant members of mankind by
organising meetings and prearranged agreements, will then
play its last part; this power, by the means of which we
have “enthroned ourselves,” will discharge its last debt
to us in its anxiety to see the outcome of our proposition
before pronouncing its judgment.
In order to obtain an absolute majority we must induce
everybody to vote, without discriminating between classes.
Such a majority would not be obtained from educated
classes or from a society divided into castes.
Having then inspired every man’s mind with the idea
of his own self-importance, we will destroy the family life
of the Gentiles and its educational importance; we will
prevent men with clever brains from coming to the front,



32
and such men the populace, under our guidance, will
keep subdued and will not permit them even to state
their plans.
The mob is used to listen to us, who pay it for its
attention and obedience. By these means we shall create
* ^ -tt
such a blind force that it will never be capable of talcing
%
any decision without the guidance of our agents, placed
by us for the purpose of leading them.
The mob will submit to this system, because it will
know that from these leaders will depend its wages,
earnings, and all other benefits. The system of govern¬
ment must be the work of one head, because it will be
impossible to consolidate it, if it is the combined work
of numerous minds. That is why we are only allowed to
know the plan of action, but must by no means discuss
it in order not to destroy its efficacy, the functions of its
separate parts and the practical meaning of each point
If such plans were to be discussed and altered by repeated
submissions at the polls, they would be distorted by the
^results of all mental misunderstandings, which arise owing
to the voters not having fathomed the depth of their
meanings. Therefore, it is necessary that our plans should
be decisive and logically thought out. That is the reason
why we must not throw the great work of our leader to
be torn to pieces by the mob, or even by a small clique.
For the present these plans will not upset existing institu¬
tions. They will only alter their theory of economy, and
therefore all their course of procedures, which will then
inevitably follow the way prescribed by our plans. In all
countries there exist the same institutions only under
different names: the houses of representatives of the
people, the ministries, the senate, a privy council of sorts*,
legislative and administrative departments.



33
I need not explain to you the connecting mechanism
of these different institutions, as it is already well known
to you. Only note that each of the above-mentioned
institutions corresponds to some important function of
the government. (I use the word “ important ” not with
reference to the institutions, but with reference to their
functions.)
All these institutions have divided among themselves
all functions of government, that is to say, administrative,
legislative, and executive powers. And their functions
have become similar to those of the divers separate organs
of the human body.
If we injure any part of the government machinery,
the state will fall sick as a human body and will die.
When we injected the poison of liberalism into the organism
of the state its political complexion changed; the states
became infected with a mortal illness, that is, decomposition
of the blood. There remains only to await the end of
their agonies. Liberalism gave birth to constitutional
governments, which took the place of autocracy—-the only
wholesome form of government for the Gentiles. Consti¬
tution, as you know for yourselves, is nothing more than
a school for dissensions, disagreements, quarrels, and
useless party agitations; in brief, it is the school of every¬
thing that weakens the efficiency of the government.
The tribune, as well as the Press, has tended to make the
rulers inactive and weak, thus rendering them useless
and superfluous, and for this reason they were deposed in
many countries.
Then the institution of a republican era became possible;
and then, in the place of the sovereign, we put a caricature
of the same in the person of a president, whom we chose
from the mob from among our creatures and our slaves.
c



Thus we laid the mine which we have placed under the
Gentiles, or rather under the Gentile nations. In the
near future we will make the president a responsible
person.
Then we will have no scruples in boldly applying the
plans, for which our own “ dummy ” will be responsible.
What does it matter to us if the ranks of place-hunters
become weak, if confusions arise from the fact that a
president cannot be found—confusions which will definitely
disorganise the country?
In order to achieve these results, we will prearrange
for the election of such presidents, whose past record is
marked with some " Panama ” scandal or other shady
hidden transaction. A president of such a kind will be
a faithful executor of our plans, as he will fear denounce¬
ment, and will be under the influence of the fear which
always possesses a man who has attained power and is
anxious to retain the privileges and honours associated
with his high office. The House of Representatives will
elect, protect, and screen the president; but we will
deprive this House of its power of introducing and altering
laws.
This power we will give to the responsible president,
who will be a mere puppet in our hands. In that case
the power of the president will become a target exposed
to various attacks, but we will give him means of defence
in his right of appeal to the people above the heads of
the representatives of the nation, that is to say, direct to
the people, who are our blind slaves—the majority of
the mob.
Moreover, we will empower the president to proclaim
martial law. We will explain this prerogative by the
fact that the president, being head of the army, must



35
have the same under his command for the protection of
the new republican constitution, which protection is his
duty as its responsible representative.
Of course, under such conditions, the key of the inner
position will be in our hands, and none other than ourselves
will control legislation.
Moreover, when we introduce the new republican
constitution, we will, under pretext of state secrecy,
deprive the house of its right of questioning the desirability
of measures taken by the Government. By this new
constitution we will also reduce the number of the repre¬
sentatives of the nation to a minimum, thus also reducing
an equivalent number of political passions, and passion
foi politics. If, in spite of this, they should become
recalcitrant, we will abolish the remaining representatives
by appealing to the nation. It will be the President’s
prerogative to appoint the chairman and vice-chairman
of the house of representatives and of the senate. In
place of continuous sessions of parliaments we will institute
sessions of a few months’ duration. Moreover, the
president, as head of the executive power, will have the
right to convene or dissolve parliament and, in case of
dissolution, to defer the convocation of a new parliament.
But, in order that the president should not be held re¬
sponsible for the consequences of these, strictly speaking,
illegal acts, before our plans have matured, we will persuade
the Ministers and other high administrative officials, who
surround the president, to circumvent his orders by issuing
instructions of their own and thus compel them to bear
the responsibility instead of the President. This function
we would especially recommend to be allotted to the
senate, to the council of state, or to the cabinet, but not
to individuals. Under our guidance the President will
c2



36
interpret laws, which might be understood in several
ways.
Moreover he will annul laws in cases when we con¬
sider this to be desirable. He will also have the right to
propose new temporary laws and even modifications in
the constitutional work of the government, using as
a motive for so doing the exigencies of the 'welfare of the
country.
Such measures will enable us to gradually withdraw
any rights and indulgences that we may have been forced
/
to grant when we fiist assumed power. Such indulgences
we will have to introduce in the constitution of govern¬
ments in order to conceal the gradual abolition of all
constitutional rights, when the time comes to change all
existing governments for our autocracy. The recognition
of our autocrat may possibly be realised before the abolition
of constitutions, namely, the recognition of our rule will
start from the very moment when the people, torn by
dissensions and smarting under the insolvency of their
rulers (which will have been pre-arranged by us), will yell
out: “ Depose them, and give us one world-ruler, who
could unify us and destroy all causes of dissension,
namely, frontiers, nationalities, religions, state debts, etc.
. . . a ruler who could give us peace and rest, which
we cannot find under the government of our sovereigns
and representatives.”
But you know full well for yourselves that, in order
that the multitude should yell for such a request, it is
imperative in all countries to continually disturb the
relationship which exists between people and governments
—hostilities, wars, hatred, and even martyrdom with
hunger and need, and with the inoculation of diseases, to
such an extent, that the Gentiles should not see any exit



from their troubles other than an appeal for the protection
of our money and for our complete sovereignty.
But if we give the nation time to take breath, another
such opportunity would be hardly likely to recur.
j The council of state will accentuate the power of the
ruler. In its capacity as an official legislative body it
will be, as it were, a committee for issuing the rulers'
commands.
Here then is a programme of the new constitution,
which we are preparing for the world. We will make
laws, define constitutional rights, and administer such by
means of (i) edicts of the legislative chamber, suggested
by the president; (2) by means of general orders and
orders of the senate and state council, and by means of
decisions of the cabinet; and (3) when the opportune
moment presents itself, by the means of a coup d'etat.
Thus, having roughly determined our plan of action,
we will discuss such details as may be necessary for us to
accomplish the revolution in the sets of wdieels of the
state mechanism in the direction which I have already
indicated. By these details I mean freedom of the press,
the rights of forming societies, freedom of religion, election
of representatives of the people, and many other rights,
which will have to vanish from the drily life of man. If
they do not altogether vanish, they will have to be funda¬
mentally changed the day after the announcement of the
new constitution. It would only be at this particular
moment that it would be quite safe for us to announce
all our changes, and for the following reason : all per¬
ceptible changes at any other time might prove dangerous,
because, if they wrere forcibly introduced and strictly and
indiscriminately enforced, they might exasperate the
people, as these would fear fresh changes in similar



3S
directions. On the other hand, if the changes were to entail
yet more indulgences, people would say that we recognise
our mistakes and that, might detract from the glory of
infallibility of the new power. They might also saj' that
we had been frightened and were forced to yield. And
were this the case, the world would never thank us, as
they regard it as a right always to have concessions made
to them. If either of these impressions were made on
the mind of the public, it would be extremely dangerous
for the prestige of the new constitution.
It is essential for us that, from the first moment of its
proclamation, whilst the people will be still suffering from
the effects of the sudden change and will be in a state of
terror and indecision, that they should realise that we are
so powerful, so invulnerable, and so full of might, that we
shall in no case take their interests into consideration. We
shall want them to understand that we will not only ignore
their opinion and wishes, but will be ready at any moment
or place to suppress with a strong hand any expression
or hint of opposition. We shall want the people to
understand that wTe have taken everything we wranted
and that we will not, under any circumstances, allow
them to share our power. Then they will close their
eyes to everything out of fear and will patiently await
further developments.
The Gentiles are like a flock of sheep—we are the
w7olves. And do you not know what the sheep do when
wolves penetrate in to the sheepfold? They close their
eyes to everything. To this they will be also driven,
because wre will promise to return to them all their liberties
after subduing the world's enemies and after bringing all
parties into subjection. I need hardly tell you how long
they wrould have to w^ait for the return of their liberties.



39
|
For what reason were we induced to invent our policy
and to instill the same into the Gentiles? We instilled
this policy into them without letting them understand
its inner meaning. What prompted us to adopt such a
*
line of action, if it was not because we could not, as a
scattered race, attain our object by direct means, but only
by circumvention? This was the real cause and origin
of our organisation of masonry, which those swine of
Gentiles do not fathom, and the aims of which they do not
even suspect. They are decoyed by us into our mass of
lodges, which appear to be nothing more than masonic
in order to throw dust in the eyes of their comrades.
By the mercy of God His chosen people were scattered,
and in this dispersal, which seemed to the world to be our
weakness, has proved to be all our power, which has now
brought us to the threshold of universal sovereignty.
We have not much more to build on these foundations
in order to attain our aims.
*****
The word liberty, which can be interpreted in divers
ways, we will define thus :—“ Liberty is the right of doing
what is permitted by law." Such a definition of this word
wall be useful to us in this way, that it will rest with us
to say where there shall be liberty and where there may
not, and for the simple reason that law will permit only
what is desirable to us.
With the Press we will deal in the following manner :
What is the part played by the Press at the present time ?
It serves to rouse in the people furious passions or some¬
times egoistic party disputes, which may be necessary for
our purpose. It is often empty, unjust, false, and most
people do not in the least understand its exact purposes.
We will harness it and will guide it with firm reins, we will



4<>
also have to gain control of all other publishing firms.
It would be of no use for us to control the newspaper press,
if we were still to remain exposed to the attacks of pamphlets
and books. We will turn the, at present, expensive
production of publication into a profitable resource to
our government by introducing a special stamp duty, and
by forcing publishers and typographers to pay us a deposit,
in order to guarantee our government from any kind of
assaults on the part of the press. In case of an attack,
we will impose fines right and left. Such measures as
stamps, deposits, and fines will be a large source of income
to the government. Certainly party papers would not
mind paying heavy fines, but, after a second serious attack
on us, we would suppress them altogether. No one will
be able with impunity to touch the prestige of our political
infallibility. For closing down publications we will give
the following pretext :—The publication, which is being
suppressed excites, we will say, public opinion without
any ground or foundation. But I would ask you to bear
in mind that amongst the aggressive publications will be
those which have been instituted by us for this purpose.
But they will only attack such points in our policy as we
intend changing. No piece of information will reach
society without passing through our control. This we
are attaining even at the present time by the fact that all
news is received by a few agencies, in which it is centralised
from all parts of the world. When we attain power these
agencies v/ill belong to us entirely and will only publish
such news as we choose to allow.
If under the present conditions we have managed to
gain control of the Gentile society to such an extent that
it surveys the world's affairs through the coloured glasses
which we put over its eyes; if even now there exists no



4i
impediment to hinder our access to state secrets, as they
are called by the stupidity of the Gentiles, what will be
our position, when we shall be officially recognised as rulers
of the world, in the person of our world-governing Emperor ?
Let us return to the future of the press. Anybody
desiring to become an editor, librarian, or printer, will be
compelled to obtain a certificate and licence, which, in
case of disobedience, would be withdrawn. The canals,
through which human thought finds its expression, will
by these means be delivered into the hands of our govern¬
ment, which will use the same as an educational organ,
and will thus prevent the public from being drawn astray
by idealising “ progress ” and liberalism. Who of us
does not know7 that this fantastic blessing is a straight road
to utopia, from which have sprung anarchy and hatred
towards authority? This is for the simple reason that
" progress,1' or rather the idea of liberal progress, gave the
people different ideas of emancipation, without setting
any limit torit. All so-called liberals are anarchists, if
not in their action, certainly by ideas. Each one of them
runs after the phantom of liberty, thinking that he can
do whatever he wishes, that is to say, falling into a state
of anarchy in- the opposition which he offers for the mere
sake of opposition.
Let us now discuss the press. We will tax it in the
same manner as the newspaper press—that is to say, by
means of excise stamps and deposits. But on books of
less than 300 pages we will place a tax twice as heavy.
These short books we will classify as pamphlets in order
to diminish the publication of periodicals, which constitute
the most virulent form of printed poison. These measures
will also compel wTiters to publish such long works that
they will be little read by the public, and chiefly so on



42
account of their high price. We ourselves will publish
cheap works in order to educate and set the mind of the
public in the direction that we desire. Taxation will bring
about a reduction in the waiting of aimless leisure literature,
and the fact that they are responsible before the law will
place authors in our hands. No one desirous of attacking
us with his pen would find a publisher.
Before printing any kind of work, the publisher or
printer will have to apply to the authorities for a permit
to publish the said work. Thus we shall know' beforehand
of any conspiracy against us, and we shall be able to
knock it on the head by anticipating the plot and
publishing an explanation.
Literature and journalism are the two most important
educational powers; for this reason our government will
buy up the greater number of periodicals. By these means
we shall neutralise the bad influence of the private press
and obtain an enormous influence over the human mind.
If we wrere to allow ten private periodicals we should
ourselves start thirty, and so forth.
But the public must not have the slightest suspicion of
these measures, therefore all periodicals published by us
will seem to be of contradictory views and opinions,
thus inspiring confidence and presenting an attractive
•
appearance to our unsuspecting enemies, who will thus
fall into our trap and will be disarmed.
In the front row we will place the official press. It
will always be on guard in defence of our interests and
therefore its influence on the public will be comparatively
insignificant. In the second row we will place the semi¬
official press, the duty of which will be to attract the
indifferent and lukewarm. In the third row we will place
what will purport to be our opposition, which in one of



43
%
its publications will appear to be our adversary. Our real
enemies will take this opposition into their confidence
and will let us see their cards.
All our newspapers will support different parties
aristocratic, republican, revolutionary, and even anarchical
—but, of course, only so long as constitutions last. These
newspapers, like the Indian god Vishnu, will be possessed
of hundreds of hands, each of which will be feeling the
pulse of varying public opinion.
When the pulse becomes quick, these hands will incline
this opinion towards our cause, because a nervous subject
is easily led and easily falls under any kind of influence.
If any chatterers are going to imagine that they are
repeating the opinion of their party newspaper, they will
in reality .be repeating our own opinion, or the opinion
which we desire. Thinking that they are following the
organ of this party, they will in reality be following the
flag which we will fly for them. In order that our news¬
paper army may carry out the spirit of this programme of
appearing to support various parties, we must organise
our press with great care.
Under the name of Central Commission of the Press,
we will organise literary meetings, at which our agents
unnoticed will give the countersign and the passwords.
By discussing and contradicting our policy, of course
always superficially, without really touching on the im¬
portant parts of it, our organs will carry on feigned debates
with official newspapers in order to give us an excuse for
defining our plans with more accuracy than we could do
in our preliminary announcements. But this, of course,
only v/hen it is to our advantage. This opposition on the
part of the press will also serve the purpose of making
the people believe that liberty of speech still exists. To



44
our agents it will give an opportunity of showing that our
opponents bring senseless accusations against us, being
unable to find a real ground on which to refute our policy.
Such measures, which will escape the notice of public
attention, will be the most successful means of guiding
the public mind and of inspiring confidence in favour of
our government.
Thanks to these measures, we will be able to excite or
calm the public mind on political questions, when it
becomes necessary for us to do so; we will be able to
persuade or confuse them by printing true or false news,
facts or contradictions, according as it will suit our
purpose. The information wiiich we will publish will
depend on the manner in wThich the people are at the time
accepting that kind of news, and we will always take
great care to feel the ground before treading on it.
The restrictions which, as I have said, we will impose
on private publications, will enable us to make a certainty
of defeating our enemies, because they will not have press
organs at their disposal by means of wiiich they could
truly give full vent to their opinions. We shall not even
have to make a thorough refutation of their statements.
Ballons d'essai, which we will throw into the third row
of our press, we will, if necessary, semi-officially refute.
Already there exists in French journalism a system of
masonic understanding for giving countersigns. All organs
of the press are tied by mutual professional secrets in the
manner of the ancient oracles. Not one of its members
wifi betray his knowiedge of the secret, if such a secret
has not been ordered to be made public. No single
publisher will have the courage to betray the secret
entrusted to him, the reason being that not one of them is
admitted into the literary world without bearing the



45
marks of some shady act in his past life. He would only
have to show the least sigirof disobedience and the mark
would be immediately revealed. Whilst these marks
%
remain known only to a few, the prestige of the journalist
attracts public opinion throughout the country. The
people follow and admire him.
Our plans must extend chiefly to the provinces. It is
essential for us to create such ideas and inspire such
opinions there as we could at any time launch on the
capital by producing them as the neutral views of the
provinces.
Of course, the source and origin of the idea would not
be altered: namely, it would be ours.
It is imperative for us that, before we assume power,
cities should sometimes be under the influence of the opinion
of the provinces—that is to say, that they should know the
opinion of the majority, which will have been prearranged
by us. It is necessary for us that the capitals, at the
critical psychological moment, should not have time to
discuss an accomplished fact, but should accept it simply
4
because it has been passed by a majority in the provinces.
When we reach the period of the new regime—that is
to say, during the transition stage to our sovereignty
we must not allow the press to publish any account of
criminal cases; it will be essential that people should think
that the new regime is so satisfactory that even crime has
ceased.
Where criminal cases occur, they must remain known
only to their victim and any one who may have chanced
to witness them, and to alone.
*****
"" The need of daily bread will force the Gentiles to hold
their tongues and to remain our humble servants. Those



46
of the Gentiles whom we may he employing in our press
will, under orders from us, discuss facts to which it would
not be desirable that we should especially refer in our
official gazette. And, whilst all manner of discussions
and disputes are thus taking place, we will pass the laws
which we need and will place them before the public as
an accomplished fact.
No one v/ill dare to demand that what has been decided
on should be repealed, more especially as we will make it
appear as if it were our intention to help progress. Then
the press will draw the attention of the public away by
new propositions (you know for yourselves that we have
always taught the populace to seek new emotions). Brain¬
less political adventurers will hasten to discuss the new
problems, such people who even nowadays do not under¬
stand what they are talking about. Political problems
are not meant to be understood by ordinary people; they
can only be comprehended, as I have said before, by rulers
who have been directing affairs for many centuries. From
all this you may conclude that, when we shall defer to
public opinion, we shall do so in order to ease the working
of our machinery. You can also perceive that we seek
approval for the various questions not by deeds, but by
words. We continually assert that, in all our measures,
we are guided by the hope and certainty of serving the
common welfare.
In order to distract overrestless people from discussing
political questions, we provide them with new problems
that is to say, those of trade and commerce. Over such
questions let them become as excited as they like ! The
masses consent to abstain and desist from what they
think is political activity only if we can give them some
new amusements, that is to say, commerce, which we try



47
and make them believe is also a political question. We
ourselves induced the masses to take part in politics in
order to secure their support in our campaign against the
Gentile governments.
In order to keep them from discovering for themselves
any new line of action in politics, we will also distract
them by various kinds of amusements, games, pastimes,
passions, public houses, and so on.
Soon we shall start advertising in the press, inviting
people to enter for various competitions in all manner of
enterprises, such as art, sport, etc. These new interests
will definitely distract the public mind from such questions
which we would have to contest with the populace. As
the people will gradually lose the gift of thinking for
themselves, they will shout together with us, for the sole
reason that we shall be the only members of society who
will be in a position to advance new lines of thought,
which lines we will advance by means of using as our
tools only such persons as could not be suspected of being
allied with us. The part of liberal idealists will be definitely
terminated when our government is recognised. Until
then they will do us good service. For tliis reason we will
try to direct the public mind towards every kind of
fantastic theory which could appear progressive or liberal.
It was we who, with complete success, turned the brainless
heads of the Gentiles by our theories of progress towards
socialism; there is not to be found a brain among the
Gentiles which would perceive that in every instance,
behind the word “ progress ” is hidden a deviation from
the truth, except in such cases where this word refers to
material of scientific discoveries. For there is but one
true teaching, and in it there is no room for “ progress.1'
Progress, like a false idea, serves to conceal the truth in



48
order that nobody should know truth besides ourselves,
God’s Chosen People, whom he has elected as its guardian.
When we get into power, our orators will discuss the
great problems which have been convulsing humanity in
order, in the end, to bring mankind under our blessed
rule.
Who will, then, suspect that all these problems were
instigated by us in accordance with a political scheme
which has been understood by no man for so many
centuries ?
*****

CX Wnen we establish ourselves as lords of the earth, we
will not tolerate any other religion except that of our
own, namely, a religion recognising God alone, with whom
our fate is bound by His election of us and by Whom also
the fate of the world is determined.
For this reason we must destroy all professions of
faith. If the temporary result of this is to produce
atheists, it will not interfere with our object, but will act
as an example to those generations to come, who will
listen to our teaching on the religion of Moses which, by
its resolute and well-considered doctrine, committed to us
the duty of subduing all nations under our feet.
By doing this we shall also lay stress on the mystic
truths of the Mosaic teachings on which, we shall say, is
based all its educative power.
Then, on every possible occasion we will publish
articles, in which we will compare our beneficial rule with
that of the past. The state of blessedness and peace which
will then exist, in spite of its having been brought about
by centuries of disturbance, will also serve to illustrate
the benevolence of our new rule. The mistakes made by
the Gentiles in their administration will be demonstrated



49
by us in the most vivid colours. We will start such a
feeling of disgust towards the former regime that the
nations will prefer a state of peace in a condition of
enslavement, to the rights of the much-lauded liberty,
which has so cruelly tortured them and drained from them
the very source of human existence, and to which they
were really only instigated by a crowd of adventurers
who knew not what they did.
•• /
Useless changes of government, to which we have been
prompting the Gentiles and by this means undermining
their state edifice, will by that time have so worried the
nations that they will prefer to endure anything from us
out of fear of having to return to the turmoils and mis¬
fortunes which they will have gone through. We will
draw special attention to the historical mistakes of the
Gentile Governments, by which they tormented humanity
for so many centuries in their lack of understanding
anything that regards true welfare of human life and in
their search for fantastic plans of social welfare. For the
Gentiles have not noticed that their plans, instead of
improving the relations of man to man, have only made
them worse and worse. And these relations are the very
foundations of human existence. The whole force of our
principles and measures will be in the fact that they will
be explained by us ,as being in bright contrast to the
broken-down regime of former social conditions.
Our philosophers will expose all the disadvantages of
Gentile religions, but no one will ever judge our religion
from its true point of view, because nobody will ever
have a thorough knowledge of it except our own people,
who will never venture to unveil its mysteries.
In the so-considered leading countries, we have circu¬
lated an insane, dirty and disgusting literature. For a
D



5°
short time after the recognition of our rule, we shall
continue to encourage the prevalence of such a literature,
in order that it should the more pointedly mark the
contrast of the teachings which we will issue from our
exalted position. Our learned men, who were educated
for the purpose of leading the Gentiles, will make speeches,
draw up plans, sketch notes and write articles, by means
of which we will influence men’s minds, inclining them*
towards that knowledge and those ideas which will
suit us.
When we shall eventually have obtained power by
means of a number of coups d’etat which will be arranged
by us, so that they should take place simultaneously in
all - countries, and immediately after their respective
governments shall have been officially pronounced as
incapable of ruling the populace—a considerable period
of time may elapse before this is realised, perhaps a whole
century—we will make every endeavour to prevent con¬
spiracies being made against us. In order to attain this
end we will make merciless use of executions with regard
to all who may take up arms against the establishment of
our power.
The institutions of any fresh secret society will be also
punishable by death; but those secret societies which
exist at the present time and which are known to us,
which are serving and have served our purpose, we will
dismiss and exile their members to remote parts of the
world. Such is the manner in which we will deal with
any Gentile Freemasons who may know more than will
suit our convenience. Such masons whom we may for
some reason or other pardon, we shall keep in continual
fear of being sent into exile. We will pass a law which will
condemn all former members of secret societies to be



5i
-exiled from Europe, where we shall have the centre of our
government.
The decisions of our Government will be final, and no
one will have the right of appeal.
In order to call to heel all Gentile societies, in which
we have so deeply implanted dissensions and the tenets of
the protestant religion, merciless measures will have to be
introduced. Such measures should show the nations that
our power cannot be infringed. We must take no account
of the numerous victims who will have to be sacrificed in
order to obtain future prosperity.
To attain prosperity even by means of numerous
sacrifices is the duty of a government, which realises that
the conditions of its existence do not only lie in the
privileges which it enjoys, but also in the executions of
its duty.
The main condition of its stability lies in the strength¬
ening of the prestige of its power, and this prestige can
only be obtained by majestic and unshakable might, which
should show that it is inviolable and surrounded by a
mystic power; for example, that it is by God appointed.
Such has been, up to the present time, the Russian
Autocracy, our only dangerous enemy, if we are not to
include the Holy See. Remember, at the time when Italy
was streaming with blood, she did not touch a hair of
Silla’s head, and he was the man who made her blood
pour out. Owing to his strength of character, Siiia
became a god in the eyes of the populace, and his fearless
return to Italy made him inviolable. The populace will
not harm the man who hypnotises it by his courage and
strength of mind.
Until the time when we attain power we will try
to create and multiply lodges of freemasons in all parts
rv



52
0
of the world. We will entice into these lodges all, who
may become, or who are known to be public-spirited.
These lodges will be the main place from which we shall
obtain our information, as well as being propaganda
centres.
We will centralise all these lodges under one manage¬
ment, known to us alone, and which will consist of our
learned men. These lodges will also have their own repre¬
sentatives, in order to screen where the management
really lies. And this management will alone have the
right of deciding who may speak, and of drawing up tire
order of the day. In these lodges we will tie the knot of
all socialistic and revolutionary classes of society. The
most secret political plans will be known to us and will be
guided by us in their execution as soon as they are
formed.
Nearly all the agents in the international and secret
police will be members of our lodges.
The services of the police are of extreme importance
to us, as they are able to throw a screen over our enter¬
prises, invent reasonable explanations for discontent
among the masses, as well as punish those who refuse
to submit.
Most people who enter secret societies are adventurers,
who want somehow to make their way in life, and who
are not seriously minded.
With such people it will be easy for us to pursue our
object, and we will make them set our machinery in
motion.
If the whole world becomes perturbed, it will only
signify that it was necessary for us to so perturb it in
order to destroy its too great solidity. If conspiracies
start in the midst of it, this will mean that one of our most



53
faithful agents is at the head of the said conspiracy. It is
only natural that we should be the sole people who direct
masonic enterprises. We are the only people who know how
to direct them. We know the final aim of each action,
whereas the Gentiles are ignorant of most things concerning
masonry, they cannot even see the immediate results of what
they are doing. They generally think only of the imme¬
diate advantages of the moment, and are content if their
pride is satisfied in the fulfilment of their intention, and
do not perceive that the original idea was not their own,
but was inspired by ourselves.
The Gentiles frequent Masonic Lodges out of pure
curiosity, or in the hope of receiving their share of the
good things which are going, and some of them do so in
order to be able to discuss their own idiotic ideas before
an audience. The Gentiles are on the look-out for the
emotions of success and applause; these are distributed
freely by us. That is why we let them have their success,
in order to turn to our advantage the men possessed by
feelings of self-pride, who, without noticing it, absorb our
ideas, confident in the conviction of their own infallibility,
and that they alone have ideas and are not subject to the
influence of others.
You have no idea how easy it is to bring even the most
clever of the Gentiles to a ridiculous state of naivete by
working on his conceit, and, on the other hand, how easy
it is to discourage him by the smallest failure or even by
simply ceasing to applaud him and thus bring him to a
state of servile subjection, holding out to him the prospect
of some new success. Just as our people despise success,
and are only anxious to see their plans realised, so the
Gentiles love success and are prepared to sacrifice all
their plans for its sake. This feature in the character of



54
the Gentiles renders it much easier for us to do what we
like with them. Those who appear to be tigers are as
stupid as sheep, and their heads are full of emptiness.
We will let them ride in their dreams on the horse of
idle hopes of destroying human individuality by symbolic
ideas of collectivism. They have not yet understood, and
never will understand, that this wild dream is contrary
to the principal law of nature, which, from the very
beginning of the world, created a being unlike all others
in order that he should have individuality.
Does not the fact that we were capable of bringing the
Gentiles to such an erroneous idea prove, with striking
clearness, what a narrow conception they have of human
life in comparison with ourselves ? Herein lies the greatest
hope of our success. How farseeing were our vise men
of old when they told us that, in order to attain a really
great object we must not stop short before the means, nor
count the number of victims who must be sacrificed for
the achievement of the cause ! We never counted the
victims of the seed of those brutes of Gentiles, and, although
we have sacrificed many of our own people, we have
already given them such a position in this world as they
formerly never dreamt that they would attain. Comparat¬
ively few \ictims on our side have safeguarded our nation
from destruction. Every man must inevitably end by
death. It is better to hasten this end in the case of people
who impede our cause than in that of those who advance
it. We put freemasons to death in such a manner that
no one, except the brotherhood, can have the ' least
suspicion of the fact; not even the victims themselves
suspect beforehand. They all die, when it is necessary,
apparently from a natural death. Knowing these facts*
even the brotherhood itself dares not protest against it.



By such means we have cut to the very root of protest
against our orders so far as the freemasons themselves
are concerned. We preach liberalism to the Gentiles,
but on the other hand we keep our own nation in entire
subjection.
Under our influence the laws of the Gentiles have been
• _^
obeyed as little as possible. The prestige of their laws
has been undermined bv liberal ideas, which have been
introduced by us into their midst. The most important
questions, both political and moral, are decided by the
Courts of Justice in whatever manner we prescribe. The
Gentile administrator of justice looks upon cases in what¬
ever light we choose to expose them. This we accomplished
by means of our agents and people with whom we appear
to have no connection : opinions of the press and other
means; even senators and other high officials blindly
follow our advice.
The brain of the Gentile, being of a purely bestial
character, is incapable of analysing and observing anything
and moreover of foreseeing to what the development of a
case may lead if it is placed in a certain light.
It is just in this difference of mentality between the
Gentiles and ourselves that we can easily see the mark of
our election by God and superhuman nature, when it is
compared with the instinctive bestial brain of the Gentiles.
They only see facts, but do not foresee them, and are
incapable of inventing anything, with the exception,
perhaps, only of things material. From all this it is clear
that nature herself meant us to lead and rule the world.
When the time comes for us to govern openly, the moment
will come to show the benevolence of our rule, and we
shall amend all the laws. Our laws will be short, clear
and concise, requiring no interpretation, so that everybody



56
will be able to know them inside out. The main feature
in them will be the obedience required towards authority,
and this respect for authority will be carried to a very
high pitch. Then all kinds of abuse of power will cease,
because everybody will be responsible before the one
supreme powder, namely that of the sovereign. The abuse
of powder on the part of people other than the sovereign
will be so severely punished that all will lose the desire to
try their strength in this respect.
We shall closely watch each step taken by our admin¬
istrative body, from which will depend the working of the
state machine; because, if the administration becomes
slack, disorder will arise everywhere. Not a single illegal
act or abuse of power will remain unpunished.
All acts of concealment and of wilful neglect on the
part of officials of the administration will disappear after
they have seen the first examples of punishment.
The grandness of our might will require that suitable
punishments should be av/arded, that is to say, that they
should be harsh, even in the case of the smallest attempt
to violate the prestige of our authority for the sake of
personal gain. The man wffio suffers for his faults, even
if too severely, will be like a soldier dying on the battlefield
of the administration in the cause of power, principle, and
law, which admit of no deviation from the public path
for the sake of personal interests, even in the case of those
who drive the public chariot. For example, our judges
will know that, by attempting to show their indulgence,
they will violate the lawrof justice, which is made in order
to award an exemplary punishment to men for the offences
which they have committed, and not in order to enable
the judge to show his clemency. This good quality ought
only to be shown in private life, and not in the official



4 57
capacity of a judge, which influences the whole basis of
the education of mankind.
Members of the law will not serve in the courts after
55 years of age for the following reasons :
1. Because old men adhere more firmly to preconceived
ideas and are less capable of obeying new orders.
2. Because such a measure will enable us to make
frequent changes in the staff, which will thus be subject
to any pressure on our part. Any man who wishes to
retain his post will, in order to secure this, have to obey
us blindly. In general our judges will be selected from
among men who understand that their duty is to punish
and to apply laws, and not to indulge in dreams of
liberalism, which might injure the educational scheme of
the government, as the Gentile judges at present do. Our
scheme for changing officials will also help us to destroy
any kind of combination which they might form among
themselves, and so they will work solely in the interest of
the government, from which their fate will depend. The
rising generation of judges will be so educated that they
will instinctively prevent any action which might harm
the existing relations of our subjects one to another.
At present judges of the Gentiles are indulgent to all
manner of criminals, for they do not possess the correct
idea of their duty, and for the simple reason that rulers,
when appointing judges, do not impress the idea of their
duty upon them.
The rulers of the Gentiles, when nominating their
subjects to important posts, do not trouble to explain to
them the importance of the same and for what purpose
the posts in question w^ere created; they act like animals
when these send their young out in search of prey. Thus
the governments of the Gentiles fall to pieces at the



58
hands of their own administrators. We will take one
more moral, drawn from the results of the system
adopted by the Gentiles, and use it for the edification
of our government.
We will root out all liberal tendencies from every
important institution of propaganda in our government,
from which may depend the education of all those who
will be our subjects. These important posts will be reserved
exclusively for those who were specially educated by us
for administration.
Should it be observed that to put our officials prematurely
on the retired list might prove too expensive for our
government, I will reply that, first of all, we shall try to
find private occupation for such officials in order to
compensate them for the loss of their posts in government
employment, or else that, in any case, our government
will be in possession of all the money in the world, therefore
expense will not come into consideration.
Our autocracy will be consistent in all its actions,
therefore any decision which our high command may
choose to take will always be treated with respect and
unconditionally obeyed. We shall ignore any kind of
grumbling or dissatisfaction, and punish every sign of
discontent so severely that other people will accept it as
an example for themselves.
We will cancel the right of appeal and reserve it only
for our own use; the reason being that we must not allow
the idea to grow up among the people that our judges are
capable of erring in their decisions.
In case of a judgment requiring revision, we will
immediately depose the judge in question and pub¬
licly punish him, in order that such an error should not
occur again.



59
I repeat what I have said before, namely that one of our
main principles will be to watch administrative officials,
and this chiefly in order to satisfy the nation, because it
has a full right to insist that a good government should
have good administrative officials.
Our government will bear the appearance of a patri¬
archal trust in the person of our ruler. Our nation and
our subjects will look upon him as upon a father, who takes
care to satisfy all their needs, looks after all their actions
and arranges the dealings of his subjects one with another,
as well as their dealings with the government. Thus the
feeling of reverence towards the ruler will penetrate so
deeply into the nation that it will not be able to exist
without his care and leadership. They cannot live in
peace without him, and will finally recognise him as their
sovereign autocrat.
The people will have such a deep feeling of reverence
towards him as will approach adoration, especially wflien
they are convinced that his officials blindly execute his
order and that he alone rules over them. They will rejoice
to see us regulate our lives as if we were parents desirous
of educating their children with a keen sense of duty and
obedience.
As regards our secret policy, all nations are children,
and their governments also. As you can see for yourselves,
I base our despotism on Right and on Duty. The right
of the government to insist that people should do their
duty is in itself an obligation of the ruler, wffio is the father
of his subjects. Right of might is granted to him in order
that he should lead humanity in the direction laid dowm
by the lawrs of nature, that is to say towards obedience.
Every creature in this world is under subjection, if not
under that of a man, then under that of circumstances



6o
or under that of its own nature, in any case under some¬
thing that is more powerful than itself. Therefore let us
be more powerful for the sake of the common cause.
We must, without hesitation, sacrifice such individuals
as may have violated the existing order, because in
exemplary punishment is the solution of the great
educational problem.
On the day when the King of Israel places upon his
sacred head the crown, presented to him by the whole of
Europe, he will become the Patriarch of the world.
The number of victims, who will have to be sacrificed
by our King, will never exceed the number of those who
have been sacrificed by Gentile sovereigns in their quest
for greatness and in their rivalry with one another.
Our sovereign will be in constant communication with
the people, he will deliver speeches from tribunes, wrhich
speeches will be immediately circulated all over the world,
fntr *****
With the object of destroying any kind of collective
enterprise, other than our own, wre will annihilate collective
work in its initial stage—that is to say, wre will transform
the universities and reconstruct them according to our
own plans.
The heads of the universities and their professors will
be specially prepared by means of elaborate secret pro¬
grammes of action, in which they will be instructed and
from which they will not be able to deviate with impunity.
They will be very carefully nominated and will be entirely
dependent on the Government. We will exclude from
our syllabus all teachings of civil law, as well as of any
other political subject. Only a few men from among the
initiated will be selected for their conspicuous abilities,
in order to be taught these sciences. Universities will



6i
not be allowed to turn out into the world green young
men with ideas on new constitutional reforms, as though
these were comedies or tragedies, or who concern them¬
selves with political questions, of which even their fathers
had no understanding.
A wrong acquaintance of politics among a mass of
people is the source of Utopian ideas and makes them into
bad subjects. This you can see for yourselves from the
educational system of the Gentiles. We had to introduce
all these principles into their educational system, in order
that we might as successfully destroy their social structure
as we have done. When wre are in power we will remove
from educational programmes all subjects which might
upset the brains of youth and wall make obedient children
out of them, who will love their ruler and recognise in
his person the main pillar of peace and of public welfare.
Instead of classics and the study of ancient history,
winch contains more bad examples than good, we will
introduce the study of the problems of the future. We
will erase from the memory of man, the bygone a.ges,
which may be unpleasant to us, leaving only such facts as
would show the errors of the Gentile governments in
marked colours. Subjects dealing with questions of
practical life, social organisation and with the dealings
of one man with another, as also lectures against bad
selfish examples—which are infectious and cause evil, and
all other similar questions of an instinctive character will
be in the forefront of our educational programme. These
programmes will be specially drawn up for the different
classes and castes, the education of which will be kept
strictly apart.
It is most important to lay stress on this particular
system. Each class or caste will have to be educated



62
separately, according to its particular position and work.
A chance genius always has known and always will know
how to penetrate into a higher caste but, for the sake of
tiiis quite exceptional occurrence, it is not expedient to
mix the education of the different castes and to admit
such men into higher ranks, in order that they may only
occupy the places of those who are bom to fill them.
You know for yourselves how fatal it was for the Gentiles
V
when they gave way to the absolutely idiotic idea of
making no difference between the social classes.
In order that the sovereign should gain a firm place in
the hearts of his subjects it is necessary that, during his
reign, the nation should be taught, both in schools as
well as in public places, the importance of his activity
and the benevolence of his enterprise.
We will abolish every kind of private education. On
holidays, students and their parents will have the right
to attend meetings in their colleges as though these were
clubs. At these meetings professors will deliver speeches,
purporting to be free lectures, on questions of men's
dealings with one another, on laws and on misunderstandings
which are generally the outcome of a false conception oi
men's social position, and finally they will give lessons on
new philosophical theories, which have not yet been
revealed to the world. These theories we will make into
doctrines of faith, using them as a stepping-stone to our
Faith.
When I have finished taking you through the whole
programme and when we shall have finished discussing a!!
our plans for the present and for the future, I will read
to you the plan of that new philosophical theory. We
know from the experience of many centuries, that men
live and are guided by ideas and that people are inspired by



63
these ideas only by means of education, which can be
given with the same result to men of all ages, but of course
by various means. By systematical education we shall
take charge of whatever may remain of that independence
of thought, of which we have been making full use for
our own ends for some time past. We have already
established the system of subduing men's minds by the
so-called system of demonstrative education (teaching by
sight), which is supposed to make the Gentiles incapable
of thinking independently and so they will, like obedient
animals, await the demonstration of an idea before they
have grasped it. One of our best agents in France is
Bouroy: he has already introduced the new system of
demonstrative education.

*****
The profession of the law makes people grow cold,
cruel, and obstinate and also deprives them of all prin¬
ciples and compels them to take a view of life which is
not human, but purely legal. They have become used
to look on circumstances purely from the point of view
of what is to be gained from defence and not from that
of the effect which such a defence might have on the
public welfare.
A legal practitioner never refuses to defend any case.
He will try to obtain an acquittal at all costs by clinging
on to small tricky points in jurisprudence and by these
means he will demoralise the court.
Therefore we will limit the sphere of action of this
profession and will place lawyers on a footing with executive
officials. Barristers, as well as judges, will have no right
to interview their clients and will receive their briefs only
when they are assigned to them by the law court and they
will study these solely from reports and documents, and



64
will defend their clients after they have been examined
in court by the prosecution, basing the defence of their
clients on the result of this examination. Their fee will
be fixed, regardless of the fact whether the defence has
been successful or not. They will become simple reporters
on behalf of justice, counterbalancing the prosecutor, who
will be a reporter on behalf of the prosecution.
Thus legal procedure wall be considerably shortened.
By this means we shall also attain an honest impartial
defence, which wall be conducted not by material interests,
but by the personal conviction of the lawyer. This will
also have the advantage of putting an end to any bribery
or corruption, which can at present take place in the
law courts of some countries.
We have taken great care to discredit the clergy of the
Gentiles in the eyes of the people, and thus have succeeded
in injuring their mission, which could have been very much
in our way. The influence of the clergy on the people is
diminishing daily.
To-day freedom of religion prevails everywhere, and
the time is only a few years off when Christianity will fall
to pieces altogether. It will be still easier for us to deal
with the other religions, but it is too early to discuss this
point.
We will confine the clergy and their teachings to such
a small part in life and their influence will be made so
uncongenial to the populace that their teachings will have
the ODDosite effect to what it used to have.
x JL
When the time comes for us to completely destroy the
Papal Court, an unknown hand, pointing towards the
Vatican, will give the signal for the assault. When the
people in their rage throw themselves on to the Vatican,
we shall appear as its protectors in order to stop bloodshed.



65
By this act we will penetrate to the very heart of this
' Court and then no power on earth will expel us from it,
until we have destroyed the Papal might. The King of
Israel will become the true Pope of the universe, the
Patriarch of the International Church.
But until we have accomplished the re-education of
youth by means of new temporary religions, and subse¬
quently by means of our own, we will not openly attack
the existing Churches, but will fight them by means of
criticism, which already has and will continue to spread
dissensions among them.
Generally speaking, our press will denounce governments,
religious and other Gentile institutions by means of all
kinds of unscrupulous articles, in order to discredit them
to such an extent as our wise nation only is capable of
doing.
Our government will resemble the Hindu god Vishnu.
Each of our hundred hands will hold one spring of the
social machinery of State.
We shall know everything, without the aid of official
police, which we have so corrupted for the Gentiles that
it only prevents the government from seeing real facts.
Our programme will induce a third part of the populace
to watch the remainder from a pure sense of duty and
from the principle of voluntary government service.
Then it will not be considered dishonourable to be a
spy, on the contrary it will be regarded as praiseworthy.
On the other hand, the bearers of false reports will be
severely punished, in order to prevent abuse being made of
the privilege of report.
Our agents will be selected both from among the upper
and the lower classes; they will be taken from among
administrators, editors, printers, booksellers, clerks, work
E



66
men, coachmen, footmen, etc. This force of police will
have no independent power of action, and will not have
the right to take any measures of their own accord, and
therefore the duty of this powerless police will consist
solely in acting as witnesses and in issuing reports. The
verification of their reports and actual arrests will depend
on a group of responsible police inspectors; actual arrests
will be made by “ gendarmes ” and city police. In case
of failure to report any misdemeanour, concerning political
matters, the person who should have reported the same
will be punished for wilful concealment of crime, if it can
be proved that he is guilty of such concealment. In like
manner our brothers have to do now, namely, on their
own initiative to report to the proper authority all apostates
and all proceedings that might be contrary to our law.
So in our Universal Government it will be the duty of all
our subjects to serve their sovereign by taking the above
mentioned action.
An organisation such as this will root out all abuse of
power and various kinds of bribery and corruption—in
fact it will destroy all ideas with which we have contami¬
nated the life of the Gentiles, by means of our theories on
superhuman rights.
How could we achieve our aim of creating disorder in
the administrative institutions of the Gentiles if not by
some such means as this ?
Among the most important means for corrupting their
institutions is the use of such agents as are in a position,
through their own destructive activity, to contaminate
others by revealing and developing their own corrupt
tendencies, such as abuse of power and a free use of
bribery.

67
When the time comes for us to take special police
measures by putting the present Russian system of
“ Okhrana ” in force (the most dangerous poison for the
prestige of the state) we will stir up mock disorders among
the populace, or induce it to show protracted discontent,
and this with the aid of good orators. These orators will
find plenty of sympathisers, thus giving us an excuse for
searching people's houses and placing them under special
restrictions by^ making use of our servants among the
police of the Gentiles.
As most conspirators are actuated by their love for
such art and for that of chattering, we will not touch them
until we see that they are about to take action, and we
wall confine ourselves to introducing among them a, so
to speak, reporting element. We must remember that
a power loses prestige every time that it discovers a public
conspiracy against itself. In such a revelation lies the
presumption of weakness and, what is still more dangerous,
the admission of its own mistakes. It must be known
that we have destroyed the prestige of reigning Gentiles
by means of a number of private assassinations, accom¬
plished by our agents, the blind sheep of our flock, who
can easily be induced to commit a crime, so long as such
a crime is of a political character.
We will force rulers to admit their own weakness by
openly introducing special police measures, " Okhrana,"
and thus we shall shake the prestige of their own power.
Our sovereign will be protected by means of most
secret guards, as we will never allow anyone to think that
there might exist such a conspiracy against our ruler that
he could not personally destroy and from which he is
obliged to hide himself. If we were to allow the existence
of such an idea to prevail, as it prevails among the Gentiles,
E2



68
we should thereby sign the death warrant of our sovereign
or, if not of himself, then of his dynasty.
By a strict observance of appearances our ruler will
use his power only for the benefit of the nation, but never
for his own good or for that of the dynasty.
By strictly adhering to such a decorum, his power will
be honoured and protected by his subjects themselves.
They will worship the power of the sovereign, knowing
that to this power is tied the welfare of the state, because
from it will depend public order.
To guard the King openly is equivalent to an admission
of the weakness of his power.
Our ruler will always be amidst his people and will
appear to be surrounded by an inquisitive crowrd of men
and women, apparently ahvays by chance occupying the
row7s nearest to him and thus holding back the mob with
a view7 to keeping order merely for order's sake. This
example will teach others to exercise self-control. In case
of a petitioner amongst the people trying to submit a
demand and pushing through the mob, the people in the
first rows will take his petition and will remit it to the
ruler in the presence of the petitioner, in order that
everyone should know that all petitions reach the sovereign
and that he himself controls all affairs. In order to exist,,
the prestige of powrer must occupy such a position, that
the people can say among themselves : ^ If only the King
knew about it ” or “ When the King knows about it.”
The mysticism, wdiich surrounds the person of the
sovereign, vanishes as soon as a guard of police is seen
to be placed round him. When such a guard is employed,
any assassin has only to exercise a certain amount of
audacity, in order to imagine himself stronger than the'
guard ; he thus realises his strength and so only has to



I
69
watch for the moment, when he can make an assault on
the said power.
We do not preach this doctrine to the Gentiles, and
you can see for yourselves the results, which the employ¬
ment of open guards has had for them.
Our government will arrest such people as they may
more or less rightfully suspect of political crimes. It is
not desirable for fear of misjudging a man to give an
opportunity of escape to such suspects.
We will, indeed, show no mercy to such criminals. In
certain exceptional cases it may be possible to consider
attenuating circumstances, when dealing with ordinary
criminal offences ; but there can be no excuse for a political
crime, that is to say, no excuse for men to become involved
in politics, which none, except the ruler, should understand.
And, indeed, not all rulers are capable of understanding
true politics.
jm * * * * *
*7 We will prohibit individuals from becoming involved
in politics, but, on the other hand, we will encourage every
kind of report or petition submitting suggestions for the
approval of the government which deal with the improve¬
ment of social and national life. Thus, by these means,
the mistakes of our Government and the ideals of our
subjects will become known to us. We will answer these
suggestions by accepting them or, if they are unsatisfactory,
by producing a sound argument to prove that they are
impossible of realisation and based on a short-sighted
conception of affairs.
Sedition is no more than the barking of a dog at an
elephant. In a government that is well organised from
a social point of view, but not from a point of view of its
police, the dog barks at the elephant without realising



70
his strength. The elephant has only to show its strength
by one good example for the dogs to stop barking and to
start wagging their tails as soon as they see the elephant.
In order to deprive the political criminal of his crown
of valour, we will place him in the ranks of other criminals
on an equal footing with thieves, murderers, and other
kinds of repulsive malefactors. Then public opinion will
mentally regard political crimes in the same light as
ordinary crimes and will place the same common stigma
on both.
We have done our best to prevent the Gentiles from
adopting this particular method of dealing with political
crimes. In order to attain this end, we have made use
of the press, public speaking, and cleverly thought-out
history school-books, and inspired the idea of a political
murderer being a martyr, because he died for the idea of
human welfare. Such an advertisement has multiplied
the number of liberals and has swollen the ranks of our
agents by thousands of Gentiles.
;* * * * *
To-day I will deal with our financial programme, which
I have left for the end of my report, as being the most
difficult question and forming the final clause in our plans.
Before discussing this point, I will remind you of that
which I have touched upon before, namely, that our whole
policy is dependent on a question of figures.
When we get into power our autocratic government
will, for the sake of self-interest, avoid imposing heavy
taxation on the populace, and will always bea.r in mind that
part which it has to play, namely, the part of father
protector.
But, as the organisation of the Government will absorb
vast sums of money, it is all the more necessary to raise



7*
the required means for maintaining it. Therefore we
must exercise great care in working out this question
and see that the burden of taxation is fairly distributed.
Through a legalised fiction, our sovereign will be the
owner of all property in the state (this is easily put into
practice). He will be able to raise such sums of money as
may be necessary to regulate the circulation of currency
in the country.
Hence the best means to meet government expenses
will be by a progressive taxation of property. Thus,
taxation will be paid without oppressing or ruining the
people and the amount at which it will be assessed will
depend on the value of each individual property.
It must be understood by the rich that it is their duty
to hand over part of their surplus wealth to the government,
because' the government guarantees them safe possession
of the remainder of their property and gives them the
right to earn money by honest means. I say honest,
because the control of property will preclude robbery on
legal grounds.
This social reform must be in the forefront of our
programme, as it is the principal guarantee of peace and
will brook no delay.
Taxation of the poor is the origin of all revolution
and always greatly conducive to injury to the Government^
as the latter, while trying to raise money from the poor^
loses its chance of obtaining it from the rich.
Taxation of capital will diminish the increase of wealth
in private hands, into which we have up till now purposely
allowed it to accumulate, in order to act as a counterpoise
to the Government of the Gentiles and their finances.
Progressive taxation assessed according to the fortune
of the individual will produce a much larger revenue than



72
the present system of taxing everybody at an equal rate.
This system is at the present time (1901) most essential
for us, it creates discontent among the Gentiles.*
Our sovereign's power will rest mainly on the fact
that he will be a guarantee for the balance of power and
for the perpetual peace of the world and, in order to
obtain such a peace, capitals will have to surrender some
of their wealth so as to safeguard the government in its
action.
Government expenditure must be paid for by those
who can best afford to do so and from whom money
can be raised.
Such a measure will stop hatred on the part of the
poorer classes for the rich, in whom they will recognise
the necessary financial supporters of the government and
will see the upholders of peace and public welfare; for
the poorer classes will understand that the rich provide
T
the means for supplying them with social benefits.
In order that the intelligent classes, that is to say,
the taxpayers, should not complain excessively about
the new system of taxation, we will furnish them
with detailed accounts, in which will be set forth the
manner in which their money is being spent, excepting
of course such portion of it as is spent on the private
needs of the sovereign and on the requirements of the
administration.
The sovereign will have no personal property, as
everything in the state will belong to him, for if the
sovereign were allowed to own private property it would
appear as though all property in the state did not belong
to him.
The relations of the sovereign—except his heir, who
* Note that this lecture was delivered in 1901.



I 73
will also be kept at government expense—will have to
serve as government officials or else work in order to
retain the right of holding property, the privilege of
being of royal blood would not entitle them to live at
the expense of the state.
There will be a progressive stamp duty on all sales
and purchases as well as death duties. Any transaction
without the required stamp will be considered illegal,
and the former owner will be obliged to pay to the
government a percentage on the duty from the date of
the sale.
All transfer vouchers must be delivered weekly to
the local surveyors of taxes, together with a statement of
the name and surname of both the new and previous
owner, as wrell as the permanent addresses of both.
Such a procedure will be necessary for transactions in
excess of a certain amount, that is to say, in excess of
the amount equal to the average daily expenditure. The
sale of prime necessities wall only have to be stamped
with an ordinary fixed duty stamp.
Just count by how many times the amount of sucli
taxation will surpass the income of the governments of
the Gentiles.
The state will have to keep in reserve a certain amount
of capital and, in case the income from taxation were to
exceed this specified sum, such superfluous income will
have to be put back into circulation. These surplus sums
will be expended on the organisation of various kinds of
public works.
The directorate of such works will be under a govern¬
ment department, and thus the interests of the working
classes will be closely connected with those of the
government and with their sovereign. A portion of this



74
surplus money will also be allotted to premiums for
inventions and productions.
It is most essential not to allow currency to lie inactive
in the state bank, beyond such a specified sum as may
be intended for some special purpose. For currency exists
for circulation and any congestion of money always has
a fatal effect on the course of state affairs, since money
acts as a lubricant in the state mechanism and, if the
lubricant becomes clogged, the working of the machine is
thereby stopped.
The fact that bonds have been substituted for a large
part of the currency has now created a congestion such
as just described. The consequences of this fact are
becoming sufficiently obvious.
We will also institute an auditing department, so as
to enable the sovereign at any time to receive a full account
of the expenditure of the government and its revenue.
All reports will be kept strictly up to date, except those
of the current and preceding months.
The only person who could not be interested in robbing
the state bank will be its owner, namely, the Sovereign.
For this reason his control will stop all possibility of
leakage or unnecessary expenditure. Receptions for the
sake of etiquette, which waste the valuable time of the
Sovereign, will be abolished in order that he may have
more opportunity to attend to affairs of state. Under
our government the Sovereign will not be surrounded by
courtiers, who usually dance attendance on the monarch
for the sake of pomp and are only interested in their own
affairs, putting aside as they do the welfare of the state.
All economic crises, which we have so skillfully arranged
in the Gentile countries, we carried out by means of
withdrawing currency from circulation. Large fortunes



75
are congested, money being withdrawn from the govern¬
ment, which in its turn is obliged to appeal to the owners
of such fortunes, in order to raise loans. These loans
have put heavy burdens on the governments, compelling
them to pay interest on the borrowed money, and thus
tying their hands.
Concentration of production into the hands of capitalism
has sucked all the productive power of the people dry,
and with it also the wealth of the state.
Currency at the present time cannot satisfy the require¬
ments of the working classes, as there is not enough to
go all round.
The issue of currency must correspond to the growth
of the population, and children have to be reckoned as
consumers of currency from the first day of their birth.
Occasional revision of currency is a vital question for the
whole world.
I think that you know that gold currency has been
the destruction of all states which have adopted it, because
it could not satisfy the requirements of the population,
all the more so because we have done our best to cause
it to be congested and to be withdrawn from circulation.
Our government will have a currency based on the
value of the working power of the country, and it will be
of paper or even of wood.
We will issue currency sufficient for each subject, adding
to this amount on the birth of every child, and diminishing
it with the death of each person.
Government accounts will be kept by separate local
governments and by county offices.
In order that delays should not occur in paying
government expenses, the Sovereign himself will issue
orders as to the term of payment of such sums, thus the



76
favouritism which is sometimes shown by ministries of
finance to certain departments will be terminated.
The revenue and expenditure accounts will be kept
together, in order that they may always be compared
with one another.
The plans which we will make for the reform of the
financial institutions of the Gentiles will be introduced in
*
such a manner as will never be noticed by them. We will
point out the necessity of reforms, as being due to the
disorderly state which Gentile finances have reached.
We will show that the first reason for this bad state of
finance lies in the fact that they start their financial year
by making a rough estimate for the budget, the amount
of which increases from year to year, and for the following
reason : the annual budget is with great difficulty made
to last till the end of the half year; then a revised budget
is introduced, the money of which is generally expended
in three months; after that a supplementary budget is
voted; at the end of the year accounts are settled by a
liquidation budget. The budget for the year is based
on the total expenditure of the preceding year; therefore
each year there is a deviation of about 50 per cent, from
the nominal sum and the annual budget at the end of
10 years is increased threefold. Thanks to such a
procedure, which was tolerated by the careless Gentile
governments, their reserves have been drained. Then,
when the period of loans arose, it emptied their state
banks and brought them to the verge of bankruptcy.
You will readily understand, that such a management
of financial affairs, which we induced the Gentiles to
pursue, cannot be adopted by our Government.
Each loan proves the weakness of the government and
its failure to understand its own rights. Each loan, like



77
the sword of Damocles, hangs over the heads of the rulers
who, instead of raising certain sums direct from the nation
by means of temporary taxation, come to our bankers
cap in hand.
External loans are like leeches, which cannot be
_ _ ^ ^ mt
separated from the body of the government until they
fall off of themselves or until the government manages
to shake them off. But the governments of the Gentiles
have no desire to shake off these leeches; on the contrary,
they increase their number, and therefore their state is
bound to die from self-inflicted loss of blood. For what
is an external loan if not a leech ? A loan is an issue of
government paper which entails an obligation to pay
interest amounting to a percentage of the total sum of the
borrowed money. If a loan is at 5 per cent., then in
20 years the government will have unnecessarily paid out
a sum equal to that of the loan, in order to cover the
percentage. In 40 years it will have paid twice, and in
60 thrice that amount, but the loan will still remain as an
unpaid debt.
From this calculation it is evident that such loans,
under the existing system of taxation (1901), draw the ^
last cents from the poor taxpayer in order to pay
interests to foreign capitalists, from whom the state has
borrowed the money, instead of collecting the necessary
sum from the nation free of all interest in the shape of
taxation.
As long as loans were internal, the Gentiles only
transferred money from the pockets of the poor into those
of the rich; but after wre bribed the necessary people to
substitute external loans for internal, all the wealth of
the states rushed into our safes and all the Gentiles started
paying us what amounted to nothing short of tribute. y



78
Through their carelessness in statesmanship, or owing
to the corruption of their ministers, or their ignorance of
finance, Gentile Sovereigns have put their countries in
debt to our banks, so that they can never pay off these
mortgages. You must understand to what pains we
must have gone in order to bring about such a state of
affairs.
In our government we will take great care that conges¬
tion of money shall not occur, and therefore we will not
have stade loans, except one of i per cent, exchequer bonds,
in order that payment of percentage should not expose
the country to be sucked by leeches.
The right of issuing bonds will be given exclusively
to commercial companies. These will have no difficulty in
paying the percentage out of their profits because they
borrow money for commercial enterprises, but the govern¬
ment cannot make profits from borrowed money, because
it borrows solely in order to spend what it has taken on
loan.
Commercial shares will also be bought by the govern¬
ment, which will thus become a creditor instead of being
a debtor and payer of tribute as it is at present. Such
a measure will put an end to indolence and laziness, which
wTere useful to us as long as the Gentiles were independent,
but vrould be undesirable in our government.
The emptiness of the purely bestial brains of the
Gentiles is sufficiently proved by the fact that, v/hen they
borrowed money from us at interest, they failed to under¬
stand that each sum so borrowed, together with the interest
on the amount, wrould eventually have to come out of the
resources of the country. It wrould have been simpler to
have taken the money from their own people at once
without having to pay interest. This proves our genius,



79
and the fact that our people has been elected by God.
We have so managed as to present the question of loans
in such a light to the Gentiles that they even thought
that they found a profit in them.
Our estimates, which we will produce when the time
comes, and which will have been worked out with the
experience of centuries and which we have been considering
while the Gentiles have been governing, will differ from
those made by the Gentiles in their extraordinary clearness,
and will prove to the world how beneficial are our new
plans. These plans will terminate such abuses as those
by which we became masters of the Gentiles, and as cannot
be allowed in our reign. We will so arrange the system
of our budget that neither the ruler himself nor the most
insignificant clerk will be in a position unobserved to
extract the smallest portion of the money or use it for
any other purpose than that to which it has been allotted
in the first estimate.
Without a definitely fixed plan it is impossible to rule
successfully. Even knights and heroes perish when they
take a road not knowing where it leads, and start on their
journey without being properly provisioned.
The Sovereigns of the Gentiles, whom we helped to
induce to forsake their duties in the government by means
of representations and entertainments, pomp, and other
diversions, were no more than screens to hide our
intrigues.
The reports of their followers, who used to be sent to
represent the Sovereign in his public duties, were made
for them by our agents. On each occasion these reports
used to please the short-sighted minds of the sovereigns,
accompanied, as they were, by various schemes for future
economy. “ How could they economise by fresh taxation ?”



8o
they could have asked, but they did not ask, the readers
of our reports.
You yourselves know to what a state of financial chaos
they have come by their own negligence, they have ended
in bankruptcy in spite of all the hard work of their subjects.
I will now add to what I told you at our last meeting
and give you a detailed explanation of internal loans.
But I will not discuss external loans any further, because
they have filled our coffers with Gentile money, and also
because our universal government will have no foreign
neighbours from whom they could borrow money.
We made use of the corruption of administrators and
of the negligence of Gentile Sovereigns in order to obtain
twice and three times the amount of the money advanced
by us to their governments, which in reahty they did not
need at all. Who could do the same with regard to us?
Therefore I will only go into the question of internal loans.
When it announces the issue of such a loan, the govern¬
ment opens a subscription for its bonds. In order that
these bonds might come within the reach of everybody
they are issued down to very small amounts. The first
subscribers are allowed to buy belowr par. On the following
day their price is inflated in order to convey the idea that
everybody is anxious to buy them.
In the course of a few days the safes of the exchequer
are full with all the money which has been oversubscribed.
(Why continue accepting money for an oversubscribed
loan?) The subscription is evidently considerably in
excess of the amount asked for, in this lies the whole
effect—the public evidently trust the government !
But when the comedy is over there arises the fact of
a very large debt. And, in order to pay the interest on



Si
this debt, the government has to have recourse to a fresh
loan, which, in its turn, does not annul the state debt, but
only adds to it. When the borrowing capacity of the
government is exhausted, the interest on the loans must
be paid by new taxations. These taxations are nothing
but debts contracted in order to cover other debts.
Then comes a period of conversions of loans, but such
conversions only diminish the amount of interest to be
paid, and do not annul the debt. Moreover they can
only be made with the consent of the creditors. When
such conversions are announced the creditors are given
the right to accept them or to have their money back, in
case they do not wish to accept the conversions. If
everybody were to reclaim his own money, the government
would be caught by its own bait, and would not be in a
condition to return all the money. Luckily the subjects
of the Gentile governments do not understand much of
finance and they have always preferred suffering a fall
in the value of their securities and a reduction of interest
to the risk of a new investment; thus they have often
given their government an opportunity to get rid of a
debt, which probably amounted to several millions.
The Gentiles vrouid not dare to do such a thing with
external loans, knowing very well that, in such a case,
wre would demand all our money.
By such action the government would openly admit
its own bankruptcy, which would plainly show the people
that their own interests have nothing in common with
those of their government. I specially draw your attention
to this fact as also to the following : at present all internal
loans are consolidated by so-called temporary loans, that
is to say, debts, the period for the payment of which is
short. These debts consist of the money placed on deposit
F



82
in state banks or saving banks. This money, being at
the disposal of the government for a considerable length
of time, is used for paying interest on external loans and,
in lieu of the money, the government places an equal
amount in its own securities into these banks. These
state securities cover all deficits in the state safes of the
Gentiles.
When our sovereign is enthroned over the whole v/orld,
all these tricky financial operations will vanish. We will
destroy the market in public funds, because we will not
allow our prestige to be shaken by the rise and fall of
our stocks, the value of which will be established by law
at par without any possibility of fluctuation in price.
Rise gives cause to fall, and it is by rises that we started
to discredit the public funds of the Gentiles.
For Stock Exchanges will be substituted enormous
government organisations, the duty of which will consist
in taxing commercial enterprises as the government may
think fit. These institutions will be in a position to throw
on to the market millions' worth of commercial shares, or
to buy up the same, in one day. Thus all commercial .
enterprises will be dependent on us.
You can imagine what a power we will thus become.
In all which I have told you up till now I have tried
to give you a true picture of the mystery of the present
events, as also of those of the past, which all flow into
the river of Fate, and the result of which will be seen in
the near future. I have shown you our secret plans by
which we deal with the Gentiles as well as our financial
policy. I have only to add a few more words.
In our hands is concentrated the greatest might of
the present days, that is to say, gold. In the course of



83
two days we can draw any amount of it from our secret
treasure rooms.
Is it still necessary for us to prove that our rule is the
will of God? Is it possible that, with such vast riches,
we shall not be able to prove that all the gold, which we
have been accumulating for so many centuries, will not
help in our true cause for good,—that is to say, for the
restoration of order under our rule ?
It may require a certain amount of violence, but this
order will eventually be established. We will prove that
we are the benefactors who have restored lost peace and
freedom to the tortured world. We will give the world
the opportunity of this peace and freedom, but certainly
only under one condition—that is to say, that it should
strictly adhere to our laws. Moreover we will make it
clear to everyone that freedom does not consist in dissolute¬
ness or in the right of doing whatever people please.
Likewise that the position and power of a man does not
give him the right to proclaim destructive principles such
~»
as freedom of religion, equality, or similar ideas. We will
also make it clear that individual freedom does not convey
the right to any man to become excited or to excite others
by making ridiculous speeches to disorderly masses. We
will teach the world, that true freedom consists only in
the inviolability of a man’s person and of his property,
wrho honestly adheres to all the lawrs of social life. That
a man’s position will be dependent on the conception
which he has of another man’s rights and that his dignity
prohibits fantastic ideas on the subject of self.
Our power will be glorious, because it will be mighty
and will rule and guide, but by no means follow leaders of
the populace or any kind of orators who shout senseless
v/ords which they call high principles, and which are in
F2



84
reality nothing else but utopian ideas. Our power will
be the organiser of order in which lies peoples’ happiness.
The prestige of this power will bring to it mystic adoration,
as well as subjection of all nations. A true power does
not yield to any right even to that of God. None will
dare to approach it with the object of depriving it even
of a thread of its might.
In order that people should become accustomed to
obedience they must be trained to modesty, therefore
we will reduce the production of objects of luxury. By
these means we will also impose morals, winch are being
corrupted by continual rivalry on the grounds of luxury.
We will patronise “ peasant industries ” in order to injure
private factories.
The necessities for such reforms also lies in the fact
that large private factory-owners often instigate their
workmen against the government, perhaps, even uncon¬
sciously.
The populace engaged in local industries does not
know the meaning of being “.out of work,” and this makes
it cling to the existing order, and induces it to support the
government. Unemployment is the greatest danger for
the government. For us it will have done its work as
soon as, by its means, wre shall have obtained power.
Drunkenness will also be prohibited as a crime against
humanity, and will be punishable as such; for man becomes
equal to a beast under the influence of alcohol.
Nations only submit blindly to a strong pow'er, wfliich
is absolutely independent of them and in whose hand they
can see a sword, acting as a weapon of defence against all
social insurrections. Why should they want their Sovereign
to possess the soul of an angel ? They must see in him the
personification of strength and might.



%
85
A ruler must arise who will supersede th » existing
governments, which have been living upon a crowd, whose
demoralisation wre ourselves have brought about among
flames of anarchy. Such a ruler must commence by extin¬
guishing these flames, which are incessantly springing
up from all sides.
In order to obtain such a result, he must destroy all
societies which may be the origin of these flames, even
if he has to shed his own blood. He must form a well
organised army, which will anxiously fight the infection of
any anarchy, wrhich may poison the body of the government.
Our Sovereign will be chosen by God and appointed
from above in order to destroy all ideas influenced by
instinct and not by reason, by brutal principles and not by
humanity. At present these ideas successfully prevail in
their robberies and violence under the banner of right and
freedom.
Such ideas have destroyed all social organisations, thus
leading to the reign of the King of Israel.
But their part will be played as soon as the reign of
our Sovereign commences. Then we must sweep them
away, so that no dirt should lie in our Sovereign’s path.
Then we shall be able to say to the nations : “ Pray
to God and bow down before him who bears the mark of
fne predestination of the world and whose star God himself
guided, in order that none other but Himself should be
able to set humanity free from all sin/’
i* * * * *
ft
’-••"■Now I will deal with the manner in which we will
strengthen the dynasty of King David, in order that it
may endure until the last day.
Our manner of securing the dynasty will consist chiefly
of the same principles which have given to our wise men



the management of the world's affairs, that is to say,
the direction and education of the whole human race.
Several members of the seed of David will prepare
Kings and their successors, who will be elected not by
right of inheritance but by their own capabilities. These
successors will be initiated in our secret political mysteries
and plans of governing, taking great care that no one
else should acquire them.
Such measures will be necessary in order that all should
know that only those can rule who have been initiated
in the mysteries of political art. Only such men will be
taught how to apply our plans in practice by making
use of the experience of many centuries. They will be
initiated in the conclusions drawn from all observations of
our political and economical system and in all social
sciences. In a word, they will be told the true spirit of the
laws that have been founded by nature herself in order
to govern mankind.
Direct successors to the sovereign will be superseded
in the event of their proving to be frivolous or soft-hearted
during their education, or in case they show any other
tendency likely to be detrimental to their power, and
which may render them incapable of ruling and even to
be dangerous to the prestige of the crown.
Only such men as are capable of governing firmly,
although perhaps cruelly, will be entrusted with the reins
of government by our Elders.
In case of illness or loss of energy, our Sovereign
will be obliged to hand over the reigns of government
to those of his family who have proved themselves more
capable.
The King’s immediate plans and, still more, his plans
lor the future will not even be known to those who will be.



§7
called his nearest councillors. Only our Sovereign, and
the Three who initiated him, will know the future.
In the person of the Sovereign, who will rule with an
unshakable will and control himself as well as humanity,
the people ws 11 recognise as it were fate itself and all its
human paths. None will know the aims of the Sovereign
when he issues his orders, therefore none will dare to
obstruct his mysterious path.
Of course, the Sovereign must have a head capable of
dealing with our plans. Therefore he will not ascend the
throne before his brain-power has been ascertained by our
wise men.
In order that all his subjects should love and venerate
their Sovereign, he must often address them in public.
Such measures will bring the two powers into harmony,
namely, that of the populace and that of the ruler, which
we have separated in the Gentile countries by holding
the one in awe of the other.
We had to hold these two powers in awe one of another,
in order that they, when once separated, should fall under
our influence.
The King of Israel must not be under the influence
of his own passions, especially that of sensuousness. He
must not allow animal instincts to get the better of his
brain. Sensuousness, more than any other passion, is certain
to destroy all mental and foreseeing powers; it distracts
men's thoughts towards the worst side of human nature.
The Column of the Universe in the person of the World
Ruler, sprung from the Holy seed of David, has to forgo
all personal passions for the benefit of his people.
Our Sovereign must be irreproachable.

Zion, of the 33rd degree.

EPILOGUE.
These minutes were stealthily removed from a large
book of notes on lectures. My friend found them in the
safes at the headquarter offices of the Society of Zion,
which is at present stituated in France.
France compelled Turkey to grant various privileges
to the schools and religious institutions of all denomina¬
tions, which wall be under the protectorate of the French
diplomacy in Asia Minor. Of course, these do not include
the Catholic schools and institutions which were expelled
from France by the late governments. This fact merely
proves that the diplomacy of the Dreyfus schools is only
anxious to protect the interests of Zion, and is working
for the colonisation of Asia Minor by French Jews. Zion
always knew how to acquire influence for itself by means
of what the Talmud calls its " working brutes,” by which
it refers to the Gentiles in general.
According to the records of secret Jewish Zionism,
Solomon and other Jewish learned men already, in 929 b.c.,
thought out a scheme in theory for a peaceful conquest of
the whole universe by Zion.
As history developed, this scheme was worked out in
detail and completed by men, who were subsequently
initiated in this question. These learned men decided
by peaceful means to conquer the world for Zion with the
slyness of the symbolic serpent, whose head was to
represent the initiated into the plans of the Jewish
r - . > 11.* .* ■ * ^'
administration, and the body of the serpent to represent
the Jewish people—the administration was always kept
secret, even from the Jewish nation itself. As this serpent
penetrated into the hearts of the nations which it
encountered, it got under and devoured all the non-Jewish
power of these states. It is foretold that the snake has



to finish its work, strictly adhering to the designed plan,
until the course which it has to run is closed by the return
of its head to Zion and until, by this means, the snake
has completed its round of Europe and has encircled it—and
until, by dint of enchaining Europe, it has encompassed
the whole world. This it is to accomplish by using every
endeavour to subdue the other countries by an economical
conquest.
The return of the head of the serpent to Zion can only
be accomplished after the power of all the Sovereigns of
Europe has been laid low, that is to say, when by means
of economic crises and wholesale destruction effected
everywhere there shall have been brought about a spiritual
demoralisation and a moral corruption, chiefly with the
assistance of Jewish women masquerading as French,
Italians, etc. These are the surest spreaders of licentious¬
ness into the lives of the leading men at the heads of
nations.
Women in the service of Zion act as a decoy for those
v.ho, thanks to them, are always in need of money, and
therefore are always ready to barter their conscience for
money. This money is in reality only lent by the Jews,
for it quickly returns through the same women into the
hands of bribing Jewry—but, through these transactions,
slaves are bought to the cause of Zion.
It is natural for the success of such an undertaking
that neither the public officials nor private individuals
should suspect the part played by the women employed
by Jewry. Therefore the directors of the cause of Zion
formed, as it wrere, a religious caste—eager followers of the
Mosaic law7 and of the statutes of the Talmud. All the
world believed that the mask of the law of Moses is the
real rule of life of the Jews.’ No one thought of investigating



go
the effect of this rule of life, especially as all eyes were
directed on the gold, which could be supplied by the caste
and which gave this caste absolute freedom for its economical
and political intrigues.
A sketch of the course of the symbolic serpent is shown
as follows :—Its first stage in Europe was in 429 b.c. in
Greece, where, in the time of Pericles, the serpent first
started eating into the power of that country. The second
stage was in Rome in the time of Augustus about 69 b.c.
The third in Madrid in the time of Charles V. in 1552 a.d.
The fourth in Paris about 1700, in the time of Louis XVI.
The fifth in London from 1814 onwards (after the downfall
of Napoleon). The sixth in Berlin in 1871 after the Franco
Prussian war. The seventh in St. Petersburg, over which
is drawn the head of the serpent under the date of 1881.
All these states which the serpent traversed have had
the foundations of their constitutions shaken, Germany,
with its apparent power, forming no exception to the rule.
In economic conditions England and Germany are spared^
but only till the conquest of Russia is accomplished by
the serpent, on which at present all its efforts are
concentrated. The further course of the serpent is not
shown on this map, but arrows indicate its next movement
towards Moscow, Kieff, and Odessa.
It is now well known to us to what extent the latter
cities form the centres of the militant Jewish race. Con¬
stantinople is showm as the last stage of the serpent’s
course* before it reaches Jerusalem.
Only a short distance still remains before the serpent
will be able to complete its course by uniting its head to
its tail.
* Note that this map was drawn years before the Revolution
in Turkey.



In order to enable the serpent to pass easily over its
course, the following measures were taken by Zion with
the purpose of recasting society and converting the labour
classes. First of all the Jewish race was so organised
that none should penetrate into it and thus disclose it s
secrets. God himself is supposed to have told the Jews
that they were predestined to rule over the whole eai In
in the form of an indivisible Kingdom of Zion. They
have been told that they are the only race which deserves
to be called human, all the rest being intended to remain
“ working brutes ” and slaves of the Jews, and that their
object must be the conquest of the world and the erection
of the throne of Zion over the universe. {See Sanli. 91,
21, IO51.)
The Jews were taught that they are Supermen, and
that they must keep themselves apart from all othei
nations. These theories inspired the Jews with an idea
of self-glorification, because they are by right the sons
of God. (See Jihal 67, 1; Sanh. 58, 2.)
The secluded mode of living of the race of Zion is
strictly adhered to by the system of the Kaghal, which
compels every Jew to help his kinsman independent of
the assistance which he receives from their local admini¬
strations, which screen the government of Zion horn the
eyes of those of the Gentile states, which, in then turn,
always eagerly defend the Jewish self-government, erro¬
neously regarding them as a purely religious sect. The
above-mentioned ideas, instilled into the Jew’s, have also
considerably influenced their material life.
When we read such works as " Gopayon,” 14, page 1;
" Eben-Gaizar,” 44, page 81; "XXXVI. Ebamot, 98,
"XXV. Ketubat,” 36; “XXXIV. Sanudrip,” 746;
" XXX. Kadushin,” 68a—which were all written in order



92
to glorify the Jewish race, we see that they really treat
all Gentiles as though they were beasts, created only to
serve them. They think that peoples, properties and even
their lives belong to the Jews and that God permits His
chosen race to make what use they like of them.
According to their laws all their ill-treatment of the
Gentiles is forgiven them on the day of their New Year,
at which time also indulgence is given them to sin likewise
in the coming year.
In order to excite the hatred of their people towards
all Gentiles, the leaders of the Jews acted as " agents
provocateurs ” in anti-Semitic risings by allowing the
Gentiles to find out some of the secrets of the Talmud.
Expressions of anti-Semitism were also very useful to the
leading Jews, because they created compassion in the
hearts of some Gentiles towards the people who were being
apparently ill-treated, thus enlisting their sympathies on
the side of Zion.
The anti-Semitism, which brought about persecutions of
the lower orders among the Jews, helped their leaders to
control and hold their kinsmen in subjection. This they
could afford to do, because they always intervened at the
right time and saved their fellow people. Note that the
leaders of the Jews never suffered from anti-Semitic risings
as regarded their personal belongings or their official
position in their administration. This is not to be
wondered at, as these heads themselves set the “ Christian
bloodhounds ” against the humbler Jews and the blood¬
hounds managed to keep their herds in order for them, and
thereby helped to establish the solidity of Zion.
The Jews, in their own opinion, have already attained
the position of a super-government over the whole world,
and are now throwing away their masks.



93
Of course, the main conquering power of Zion always
lay in their gold; therefore they only had to work in order
to give a value to this gold.
The high price of gold is chiefly accounted for by gold
currency; its accumulation in the hands of Zion is accounted
for by the Jews being able to profit and make use of any
serious international crisis in order to monopolise gold.
This is proved by the history of the Rothschild family,
published in Paris in the “ Libre Parole/*
By means of these crises the might of Capitalism was
- r*?k__ . .
established under the banner of Liberalism and protected
by cleverly thought-out economical and social theories.
By giving these theories a scientific appearance the Elders
of Zion obtained extraordinary success.
The existence of the balloting system always affords
Zion an opportunity of introducing, by means of bribery,
such laws as may suit its purpose. The form of Gentile
government most after the Jews* own heart is a Republic,
because with such they can the more easily manage to
buy a majority and the republican system gives their
agents and army of anarchists unlimited freedom. For
this reason the Jews are such supporters of Liberalism and
the stupid Gentiles, who are befooled by them, ignore the
already evident fact that, under a republic there is no
more freedom than under an autocracy; on the contrary,
there exists an oppression of the few by the mob, which
is always instigated by the agents of Zion.
According to the will of Montefiore, Zion spares no
money or means in order to attain these ends. In our
days all governments throughout the world, consciously
or unconsciously, are subject to the orders of that great
super-government which is Zion, because all their bonds
•are in the possession of the latter and all countries are



94
indebted to the Jews to such an extent as never to be able
to pay off their debts. All trade, commerce, as well as
diplomacy, are in the hands of Zion. By means of its
capital it enslaved all Gentile nations. By dint of
intensified education on a material basis the Jews laid
heavy chains on all the Gentiles, with which they have
attached them to their super-government.
The end of national freedom is at hand, and therefore
also individual liberty will come to an end, because true
liberty cannot exist where the lever of money renders it
possible for Zion to govern the mob and to reign over the
more worthy and more reasonable portion of the community.
. . . “ Those that have ears to hear, let them hear.”
It will soon be four years since “ the Protocols of the
Elders of Zion ” have been in my possession. God alone
knows how numerous have been the unsuccessful attempts
which I have made in order to bring them to light or
even to warn those who are in power and reveal to them the
causes of the storm which hangs over apathetic Russia,
who seems unfortunately to have lost all count of what
is going on around her.
And only now, when I fear that it is too late, have I
succeeded in publishing my work, in the hope that I may
be able to warn those who still have ears to hear and
eyes to see.
There is no room left for doubt. With all the might
and terror of Satan, the reign of the triumphant King of
Israel is approaching our unregenerate world; the King
born of the blood of Zion—the Anti-Christ—is near to the
throne of universal power.
Events in the world are rushing with stupendous
rapidity; dissensions, wars, rumours, famines, epidemics.



and earthquakes—what was but yesterday impossible, has
to-day become an accomplished fact. Days rush past, as it
were for the benefit of the chosen people. There is no time
to minutely enter into the history of humanity fiom the
point of view of the revealed “ mysteries of iniquity,”
to historically prove the influence which the " elders of
Israel ” have had on the misfortunes of humanity, to
foretell the already approaching certain future of mankind
or to disclose the final act of the world’s tragedy.
The Light of Christ alone and that of His Holy Universal
Church can penetrate into the Satanic depths and reveal
the extent of their wickedness.
In my heart I feel that the hour has struck for sum¬
moning the Eighth Ecumenical Council to which, oblivious
of the quarrels which have parted them for so many
centuries, will congregate the pastors and lepresentatives
of the whole of Christianity, to meet the advent of the
Anti-Christ.

THE JEWS’ WHO’S WHO.
The First Edition of this epoch-making work being exhausted, a popular edition is now in the Press, and will be issued shortly at the reduced price
of 10/- net. The Jews’ Who's Who was designed and compiled long before the famous ‘4 Protocols ” were lie^rd of in England, in order to show to
Britons how completely the Jewish power has undermined and secured control of all the financial and political life of the British Empire. The P of the work contains the names and histories of leading Jews who have been active in the work of disintegrating the British Empire and changing it into
a Jewish Dominion. It gives a list of some of their activities and includes some of their more or less British connections, partners, and patrons,
cidentally it provides a concrete proof and illustration of the “Protocols of the Elders of Zion,” and of the working out of their diabolical policy.
The Introductory part of the work possesses great historical importance,
and traces the working of the Jew Plot through the centuries. It shows that the Talmud is the Jews’ “ Gospel,” and not the Old Testament, and
that the Jews’ “ religion ” is Finance and Politics and hatred of the Christia n
world. It gives a concrete instance of the triumph of the Jew over the Empire in the critical case of South Africa, where the Jews plotted and organised the Jameson Raid, the Boer War, the Rebellion, and—by means
of bribery and corruption, aided by these wars—gained complete ascendancy over all South African wealth, trade and politics.
“ The information given is singularly accurate, and its collection must
have involved an immense amount of research.”—Financial News.

A Tale of Two Books.
The two books in question are “The Jews and Modern Capitalism,” by the Jewish Professor Sombart, which traces the steps by which the Jews “fathomed all the secrets that lay hid in money, and found out its magic powers. They became Lords of Money, and through it Lords of the World.” The other book, a South African work, shows how they succeeded
in becoming Lords of South Africa.

This work, which has doubled its sizedn the new edition, shows how
Jews have fooled the Christian nations by preaching democracy, and ijKer this flag have established the complete rule of the Grand Usurer*:'
P*"ylock. The second part of the work shows how Jews seek to put the' stigma of insanity on all who oppose them, and how they have actually succeeded in getting some of their critics interned. Democracy or Shy
looracy should be carefully studied along with the Protocols. Like The
Jews’ Who’s Who it contains proof positive of the Jewish origin of The
Bolshevists’ Bible.// . . L"--,' •'>'* ■ :? wwm
