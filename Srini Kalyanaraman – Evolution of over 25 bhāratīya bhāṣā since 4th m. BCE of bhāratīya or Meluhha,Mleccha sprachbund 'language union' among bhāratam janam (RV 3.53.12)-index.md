Evolution of over 25 bhāratīya bhāṣā since 4th m. BCE of bhāratīya or Meluhha,Mleccha sprachbund 'language union' among bhāratam janam (RV 3.53.12)
Patanjali recounts a famous dialogue:
A certain grammarian (kaścid vaiyākaraṇah) says to a chariot driver, ko 'sya rathasya pravetā 'Who is the driver of this car?' The driver answers, āyuṣmann aham prājitā 'Sir, I am the driver', upon which the grammarian accuses him of using an incorrect speech form (apaśabda). The driver retorts that the grammarian knows what should obtain by rule (prāptijnah) but not what is desired (iṣṭijnah): this term is desirable (iṣyata etad rūpam), Patanjali doubtless reflects a historical change in the language between Pāṇini's time and area and his. At the same time, he is clearly willing to countenance that usage could include terms which a strict grammarian might consider improper. And he puts this in terms of a contrast between a grammarian and a charioteer.
I suppose that the key lies in reconstructing lingua franca of say, 4th m. BCE -- from pronunciation variants recorded in lexicons. I submit that this is aided by Indus Script Corpora of over 9000 inscriptions with precise hieroglyphs and hypertexts in a cultural context of creating wealth of a guild or janapada.
A good example is the 'rim-of-jar' hieroglyph which has hypertext variants by composing additional hieroglyphs into the orthography of Sign 342.
