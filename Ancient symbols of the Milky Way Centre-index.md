MILKY WAY CENTRE
The latest Annotated photo view of our Galaxy. (http://gallery.spitzer.caltech.edu)
Like early explorers mapping the continents of our globe, astronomers are busy charting the spiral structure of our galaxy, the Milky Way. Using infrared images from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, scientists have discovered that the Milky Way's elegant spiral structure is dominated by just two arms wrapping off the ends of a central bar of stars. Previously, our galaxy was thought to possess four major arms.
This annotated artist's concept illustrates the new view of the Milky Way, along with other findings presented at the 212th American



Astronomical Society meeting in St. Louis, Mo. The galaxy's two major arms (Scutum-Centaurus and Perseus) can be seen attached to the ends of a thick central bar, while the two now-demoted minor arms (Norma and Sagittarius) are less distinct and located between the major arms. The major arms consist of the highest densities of both young and old stars; the minor arms are primarily filled with gas and pockets of star-forming activity.
The artist's concept also includes a new spiral arm, called the "Far-3 kiloparsec arm," discovered via a radio-telescope survey of gas in the Milky Way. This arm is shorter than the two major arms and lies along the bar of the galaxy.
Our sun lies near a small, partial arm called the Orion Arm, or Orion Spur, located between the Sagittarius and Perseus arms.
The characteristics of a barred Galaxy is foremost its straight line in the middle and its outgoing movement. In contradiction to other spiral galaxies, the movement in a barred Galaxy maybe once have been a rotating globular cluster shape which have been compressed and later on have being formed via an explosion which created 2 the outgoing radiating beams from the centre.
If so, there are NO actual suction in the centre and therefore no "black hole" that pulls everything towards the middle in our Galaxy. On the contrary: Everything is/was pushed outwards in a suddenly movement of expansion of the globular shape and, as a result of the original globular rotation, the 2 major arms was formed and pushed out in cosmos until the 2 arms meets to much resistance and began to form the swirls or arms.
Seen from the direction of our Sun system, the direction towards our Galaxy centre are placed in the star constellation of Sagittarius. And what a great idea it was, who ever did this, to place an Archery marksman to show the direction to the centre!
The rotation time of The Milky Way, it is approximately 225.000.000 earthly years, and some people claims to find ancient astronomical



evidence for this time period. (Aztec, Buddhism and other) Our Solar system is about 26.000 light years from the centre, and it is located in the minor Milky Way spiral arm, called the "Orion Spur", in/near the Star constellation of Orion.
ANCIENT SYMBOLS OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM AND MILKY WAY GALAXY
Picture 1 is a schematic drawing showing the Galaxy with the Sun system marked as a wheel. Picture 2 is a Stone Age stone from Denmark, Jutland, locality Fjerritslev. Picture 3 is from the prehistoric location of Catal Huyuk, Turkey. Picture 4 shows a Finnish museum replica of a Bronze Age artefact with a lot of concentric rings and within these rings is another concentric group of rings with 4 small balls in different sizes, symbolizing the Solar system and some Planets.
Modern location method.
I have no doubt that pictures 2, 3 and 4 above is showing the Sun system placed in our Galaxy! Just think about it! The bronze artefact above from Finland is approximately 4-5 thousand years old! I am pretty sure that the meaning with this bronze ornament is that it symbolize the our Sun-system ant its placement in our Galaxy!
Possible Celestial and Galactic Poles
What have our ancestors meant by making this picture 1 from Sweden? In the Norse mythology the 3 Rings could very well



represent the 3 "Gaarde", Midgaard, Asgaard an Udgaard, meaning 3 centers as showed on the animated picture.
Picture 3 is from the Canaries Islands, is very similar to the Swedish and it just shows how the shamans all over the world have almost identical experiences during their spiritual travels in the space.
Our ancestors often pictured the Milky Way Galaxy as a big wheel with many spokes. On the animated picture the yellow ring represents the celestial north pole, the red ring represents the circumpolar centre and the green ring represents the north pole of our Galaxy. Is it just that our ancestors have seen?
The Debel Rock Art Stone from Denmark inserted in a Star Atlas picture. The red arrow number 1 marks the Celestial Centre Point. Number 2 marks the Circumpolar Centre Point. 3 shows the northern hemisphere Milky Way Contour. Arrow 4 points to the star constellation of Sagittarius and arrow 5 points to the Centre of our Galaxy.
How could our ancestors have had that knowledge long before modern science? The answer is of course: By spiritual journeys out of the body and via intuitive knowledge. Maybe as in the biblical Ezekiel Vision of:
