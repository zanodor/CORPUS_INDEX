The Meaning of the Great Sphinx of Giza in Egypt
Tour Egypt aims to offer the ultimate Egyptian adventure and
intimate knowledge about the country. We offer this unique
experience in two ways, the first one is by organizing a tour and
coming to Egypt for a visit, whether alone or in a group, and living it
firsthand. The second way to experience Egypt is from the comfort
of your own home: online.

Whatever else it might be, the Great Sphinx is certainly not the
keeper of long lost knowledge, or ancient technologies, as has been
popularly reported over the years. There are surely no hidden
chambers holding the secrets of Atlantis between its paws, or



elsewhere. What the Great Sphinx is in reality is grand enough. It is a
monumental symbol of ancient Egyptian kingship, probably related
to solar worship.
There was a trend toward colossal stone architecture in Egypt by the
middle of the 4th Dynasty, as Khafre took the reigns of kingship.
This tendency had been going on for more than a century, when
Khafre came to power, but he took the trend even further. He began
by using limestone core blocks weighing hundreds of tons in his
temples, but his craftsmen also created more than two hundred
statues, that we know of, made from hard stone. Twenty-two of
these were at least three times life size, but the largest statue of all is
thought to be the Great Sphinx at Giza near Cairo. It would remain
unique for both its size, and for the fact that it was hewn directly
from the living rock.
Much controversy has surrounded the Great Sphinx, including
whether or not it was actually carved as late as the 4th Dynasty, not
surprisingly considering that it appears suddenly and without much
precedent. Though it remained a classic image of kingship
throughout Egypt's ancient history, there was no continuum of
development of its form prior to the Great Sphinx's appearance on
the Giza Plateau. Rather, the complete form appears all at one at
Giza, even though a detached Djedefre head in the Louvre Museum
suggests that the form had been executed in stone a few years
earlier. This is certainly not the manner in which pyramids were
developed in Egypt, through much trial and error.



The fact that this earliest super-colossal image of the king was a
mixed form, both animal and human, is significant. In mixed forms, it
is the head that conveys the essential identity, and with the nemes
scarf about the Great Sphinx's head, it must be the representation of
a king. But as Henry Fischer relates the head's attachment to the
lion's body, it is "a suggestion of shape-shifting, of metamorphosis,
that is appropriate to the king who is, uniquely, the link between
mankind and the gods, and stands constantly on the threshold of
these two worlds".
However, we should also look to some of the oldest images of
ancient Egypt, as well as elsewhere. The lion was a solar symbol in
more than one ancient Near Eastern culture. It is also a common
archetype of royalty. Even as early as the Predynastic period, we find



carved on luxury objects probably of royal origin, scenes depicting
fantastic animals mingling with wild, real world animals. These may
be found on ceremonial slate palettes, ivory plaques and ivory knife
handles, particularly found at Hierakonpolis or from nearby Naqada
in Upper Egypt. Most of these early depictions were of winged,
falcon headed griffins, leopards with long, winding necks and other
accompanying animals that are usually considered to be inspired
indirectly from models found in Mesopotamia.However, some two
dimensional images on slate palettes of the Early Dynasty period,
some three to four hundred years prior to the carving of the Great
Sphinx, depict the king as a wild lion or griffin, destroying his
enemies.
A magic wand from ancient Egypt, with a double headed Sphinx
In the earliest of Egyptian times, men saw and knew the power of
beasts, and seem to have envied them. There is a sense that
humans, at the dawn of civilization, were subject to, and seemingly
inferior to, the world's more feral inhabitants. However, as man's
intellect grew, together with his ability to control, or at least defend
himself from wild beasts, so too did his confidence. Many scholars
believe that mixed images such as the Sphinx symbolize mankind's
domination over wild beasts, and over chaos itself. Such images as



the Great Sphinx may very well represent animal power tamed by
human intelligence and thus transformed into divine calm.
Traditionally, mixed, or composite images were almost always seen
as divine. One way or the other, what could be more dangerous and
powerful, or more self assured than the king of the jungle with the
mind of a human king?
More specifically to the Great Sphinx, however, Alan Gardiner
suggested that the Egyptian phrase, shesep ankh Atum, meaning
"Living Image of Atum", which was associated with sphinxes in later
times, signified the pharaoh in the form of the primeval sun and
creator god. The word Shesep ankh used for statue, perhaps of a
particular kind, is known from the Old Kingdom. Fischer suggested
that it derives from shesep, which means "to receive". Fischer goes
on to say that such a statue is "one who receives offerings and other
ministrations".



Carved from the living stone, the Great Sphinx of Giza is an apt
symbol for the god Atum, or the king in the guise, especially in
Atum's aspect of a chthonic creator god. James Allen has pointed
out that Atum's name means "completed one", and that, according to
the ancient Egyptians, the entire physical world came forth from
Atum as the "primeval mass". There is, in fact, an obscure notion in
the Pyramid Texts, Coffin Texts and the Book of the Dead that has
the lion emerging from the primeval mass within the primeval waters
before all other animals, including mankind. Karol Mysliwiec pointed
out an association between the birth of Atum and the lion; that Atum
appeared on earth as a lion. According to The Treasures of the
Pyramids, edited by Dr. Zahi Hawass:
"The idea is expressed in the association between Atum and Ruti,
the double lion god who is somewhat like a cell that has doubled its
elements and begun to divide, before the actual split has occurred.
The double lion also alludes to Shu and Tefnut, the first
differentiation of Atum's being. But Ruti says 'I am the double lion,
older than Atum,' so appearing even before the actual birth of the
next primordial generation"
Nevertheless, it is not certain that the 4th Dynasty Egyptians saw in
the Sphinx an image of Atum. However, even if the Great Sphinx was



an image of the king, according to the Pyramid Texts, kingship
descended from Atum, through Shu, Geb and Osiris to Horus, and
therefore, the reigning king of Egypt. While the pyramid structure
was almost certainly associated with Atum in his capacity of the
primeval mound and the sacred benben tone of Heliopolis, the Great
Sphinx could also be associated with Atum as the primeval king in
lion form, emerging form the formless mass of creation, with its royal
head rising just above the earthy pit.
The sphinx temple also suggests that the complex was related to the
solar cycle, which would not only include Atum as it sets, but also the
sun in its other phases, including the rising sun, Khepri and the sun
at its zenith, Re. Various elements in the Old Sphinx temple appear to
be solar related, such as the 24 columns, thought to represent the
24 hours of the day and night, that support its roof.
It seems that the Sphinx may relate to an advancement of the royal
sun cult during the 4th Dynasty. Djedefre, who ruled briefly around



the time of Khafre and Khufu, was the first pharaoh to adapt the title,
"Son of Re". As Horus, the presenter of offerings, the Sphinx might
represent a sublimation of kingly power to a higher deity. At the same
time, it would not be hard for the Sphinx to represent both the king
as Horus, and also be identified with the sun god.
We must also finally look at the Great Sphinx as a guardian of the
necropolis at Giza from evil. Situated at the very entrance to the
sacred cemetery, the Sphinx must have been a warning to
dangerous forces.
