Etymological Dictionary of Basque 3
{Editor’s preface
R. L. (Larry) Trask died in March 2004 at the age of 59, leaving unfinished his Etymological Dictionary of Basque. In 2000 he had been awarded a Major Research Fellowship by the Leverhulme Trust to support this project, to which he devoted much of his time between October 2001 and his death. As a colleague of Trask’s for nearly twenty-five years, now in retirement, I agreed, with the encouragement of other colleagues and of his widow, Jan Lock, to prepare and edit his unfinished typescript for web publication.
What is offered here is in no sense a completion of Trask’s project, a task for which I am not qualified. Rather my aim is limited to making available to the world of scholarship, in as useful a form as possible, the results that he had achieved, as a tribute to the memory of a distinguished Vasconist and a long-standing friend.
Trask’s own presentation of the objectives of the Etymological Dictionary of Basque can be seen best in section 1 (General introduction) and section 13 (The structure of entries). It is clear that his aim was to provide a single-volume work, in English, of value to scholars such as comparativists, who may not have been Vasconists. It might also be seen as a companion volume to his History of Basque (1997), now with a special focus on the history of the Basque lexicon.
It is likely that the list of items with dictionary entries is in large measure complete. There are a certain number of lexemes that are cross-referred to in The Dictionary or mentioned in sections 1-14 (Guide to the dictionary) but are missing from the list of entries as Trask left it. I have included these in the section ‘Morphemes crossreferred to but not listed in The Dictionary’ on page 425.
Section 13 explains the indentation structure of the dictionary entries, with head words aligned left, and derivatives and compounds indented below the relevant head words. Derivatives of derivatives have a further indent. In the editing process it was necessary to reconstruct this indentation pattern which had been lost in the transfer of the text between different word-processing and operating systems. For the most part, this structure could be recovered by observing deviations from strict alphabetical order, and, of course, from the sense of the etymological information itself, though in some cases it was necessary to add missing glosses and make guesses about the etymological relationships Trask understood.
Trask considerably helped the editor’s task by indicating with ** or **** gaps where he intended to add information. These asterisked gaps are of the following kinds: glosses to dictionary entries, localization of dialect forms, Latin names for flora and fauna, cross-references to other entries, references to sources, references to the phonological changes, morphological and word-formation rules, and phonological treatment of loan words that are discussed in sections 6-8 and 10, and etymological discussions. There are also some evident gaps in sections 6−8 and 10 of the Guide the dictionary where I have done no more here than supply, as Trask had himself done in several cases, a few references to Michelena’s works where the missing points are discussed.
I have dealt with the asterisked gaps in the following way. I have attempted to supply a gloss or glosses for most of the words mentioned, in order to make evident the semantic relationships Trask had in mind. The glosses supplied editorially, between { } as with all other editorial material, are derived in the first place from Michelena

(1961a/1977a) which is one of Trask’s major sources, and secondly from Azkue (1905) and Aulestia (1989). In a few cases, the sense of a word is so specialized that the source reference is probably more use than an English gloss; and in a few cases, such as of homonyms, one cannot tell which sense Trask intended to discuss. Only occasionally have I attempted to supply missing dialect localization for the various forms of an entry, especially where the information is mentioned in Michelena (1961a/1977a), or where it helps to make sense of the entry as a whole. After Michelena, the source used is Azkue (1905). The gaps in the scientific Latin terminology for flora and fauna remain as they stood, as do the planned indices of these elements. This kind of information is available in Michelena & Sarasola (1989−). I have supplied all missing cross-references; where the item is not in fact to be found I add ‘{not in The Dictionary}’. As for the references to the work of other scholars, I have managed to trace nearly all of them, I hope accurately. Arbelaiz (1978) was very useful in the case of Michelena’s works, though there remain some ‘Michelena (****)’ that I have not been able to identify. Some 40 entries contain a reference to ‘MT entry’ as a source. Despite help from various Vasconists, for which I am grateful, I have not so far been able to identify ‘MT’. A considerable number of items have been added to the Bibliography, in which I have also attempted to supply the titles of articles when these were not already included, and missing details of editors and publishers. Some gaps remain. The references in The Dictionary to the phonological, morphological, and word-formation rules listed in sections 6-8 and 10 have been added where absent. Not being a Vasconist, I have not attempted to go beyond my expertise in filling in gaps in the etymological discussions. Thus, a considerable number of entries remain without etymology. Occasionally I have supplied a detail or an observation relating to a Romance etymon or comparandum that Trask mentions. The contents list makes clear that Trask would have supplied an alphabetical index of Basque words and English glosses. Since the electronic text here made available will be searchable, such an index does not now seem necessary.
As mentioned previously, I have added (425), a list of morphemes cross-referred to but absent from The Dictionary itself. There is no doubt that Trask would have incorporated these, with etymological discussion, in The Dictionary if he had been able to complete it. To the section The native lexicon I have added items listed in The Dictionary where the discussion makes clear that Trask regarded them as native. I have compiled a Supplementary native lexicon consisting of other words mentioned as ‘pre-Basque’ in sections 4-5 or described in The Dictionary as ‘OUO’ (‘of unknown origin’) and which therefore also seem likely to be ‘native and ancient’ (see section 9). No entries have been added to the Subject index, but I have endeavoured to fill out the entries already there with items from The Dictionary where the indexed term occurs.
Typographical errors and errors in alphabetical order have been silently corrected. Short editorial deletions are marked with strikethrough. Editorial additions (including elements moved from elsewhere in the text) are enclosed in braces { }. Elements to be suppressed (for example, because of duplication), or combined with other entries, are indicated with {[} at the beginning and {] ... } at the end. This somewhat inelegant device is needed because Trask uses brackets [ ] for other purposes: for numbering different sense of homonyms, for references, particularly ‘[FHV]’ = Michelena (1977a), and for notes to himself concerning matters needing further attention. A certain number of editorial modifications have been made to resolve internal

inconsistencies, when I give preference to that form or relationship where Trask offers the best supporting evidence.
I hope Trask’s Etymological Dictionary of Basque, though incomplete, will be found useful and that its web publication will encourage others to follow Trask in the investigation of the history and structure of the Basque lexicon.

1. General introduction
1a. The language and its external history
Basque is spoken today by about 660,000 people at the western end of the Pyrenees, along the Bay of Biscay. The Basque-speaking region extends for about 160 kilometres from east to west, and for about 50 kilometres from north to south. It now excludes the cities of Bilbao (Basque Bilbo), Bayonne (Baiona) and Pamplona (Iruñea), all formerly Basque-speaking, but it includes the city of San Sebastián (Donostia). South of the Pyrenees, this region covers most of the Spanish province of Vizcaya (Basque Bizkaia), all of the province of Guipúzcoa (Gipuzkoa), the northern part of Navarra (Nafarroa), and a small northern corner of Alava (Araba). To the north, it covers most of the historical French territory of Labourd (Lapurdi), all of Basse-Navarre (Nafarroa Beherea), and all of Soule (Zuberoa); these territories lost their separate existence after the French Revolution, when they were combined with nonBasque-speaking Béarn into a new department now called Pyrenées-Atlantiques. The number of speakers on the French side was estimated at 80,000 in 1991, but is declining rapidly, and is now perhaps closer to 50,000. In the south, speaker numbers are remaining stable for the present.
History in this part of the world begins with the Roman conquest of Spain and Gaul in the first century BC and the first century AD. The Romans reported the presence of a number of named peoples occupying the area of the historical Basque Country. North of the Pyrenees, they found the entire southwest of Gaul, from the Garonne to the Pyrenees, occupied by a non-Celtic people who they called the Aquitani, or Aquitanians, with several sub-tribes. By good luck, we possess about 400 Aquitanian personal names and about 70 divine names embedded in brief Latin texts, most of them votive or funerary, and in most cases the sex of the name-bearer is noted.
The phonological structure of Aquitanian, so far as we can recover this from the slightly defective Roman orthography, is remarkably similar to the phonology reconstructed independently for the Pre-Basque of around 2000 years ago by Luis Michelena (Michelena 1961a) (Michelena did not use the Aquitanian materials in his reconstruction). Moreover, there are quite a few recurrent morphs in the Aquitanian names which can be readily identified with known Basque words. Examples include the female name NESKATO (Basque neskato ‘girl’), the female name ANDERE (andere ‘lady’), the male element CISSON- (gizon ‘man’), the male element OSSO- ~ OXSO- (otso ‘wolf’), the male element HERAUS- (herauts ‘boar’), the second element -CORRI (gorri ‘red’), the second element -BERRI (berri ‘new’), and the second element -BELEX (beltz ‘black’), though there are many others. Just such personal names are known to have been used in Basque in the early medieval period. Moreover, the patterns of formation and the order of elements are identical to what we find in Basque. Accordingly, since the publication of Michelena (1954**{a}), summarizing this evidence, it has been generally accepted that Aquitanian represents an ancestral form of Basque.
South of the Pyrenees, evidence for Basque speech in Roman times is confined to only three inscriptions, all of them found in eastern Navarra. One of these, the famous Lerga stele, contains the striking male name VMME SAHAR, which is clearly Basque ume ‘child’ plus zahar ‘old’. These inscriptions were found in territory assigned by the Romans to a people



Etymological Dictionary of Basque 7
they called the Vascones (singular Vasco), and it is this name which is the source of Spanish vasco, French basque and English Basque. The rest of the historical Basque Country was divided by the Romans among the Varduli, the Verones, the Caristii and the Autrigones. There is no record of Basque speech in any of this territory, and the numerous personal names that are recorded here are beyond question Indo-European and probably Celtic. Since the western part of the modern Basque Country retains a number of toponyms which are nonBasque, probably Indo-European and very likely Celtic, we may wonder whether Basque was already spoken in its historical region at this time, or whether it spread westward only after the collapse of Roman power in the west.
However, toponymic evidence shows that Basque was spoken at some point as far east in the Pyrenees as the Valley of Aran, in territory which has in historical times been occupied by Spanish, Catalan and Occitan. Indeed, the very name Aran appears to continue Basque (h)aran ‘valley’.
1b. Documentation and texts
Apart from the Aquitanian materials, the earliest written evidence of Basque appears to be a set of lead tablets, dating from the Roman period, pertaining to a medicinal spring in Roussillon, in which the local nymphs are invoked with the word NESCAS or NISCAS, which appears to represent Basque neska ‘girl’ (recorded in the Aquitanian texts as its diminutive NESCATO) (Corominas 1975).
Otherwise, the earliest records of Basque are personal names recorded in early medieval manuscripts and inscriptions, first in Latin, later in Spanish. The single earliest such name is Momus, a Latinized form of Mome, a name no longer in use but well attested in medieval Bizkaia; this occurs in a Latin inscription in the celebrated (apparently pre-Christian) cemetery of Argiñeta in Elorrio (Bizkaia), usually dated to 883.
The earliest known connected phrases are the well-known Emilian Glosses, two phrases added to a Latin manuscript found at the monastery of San Millán in the Rioja; the manuscript is usually dated to around 950, though some scholars prefer a slightly later date. These phrases, jzioqui dugu and guec ajutu-ezdugu, are obscure in sense, but they contain the auxiliary verb-form dugu ‘we have (it)’, the negative ez ‘not’, and probably an odd variant of guk, the ergative of the pronoun gu ‘we’. The remaining items appear to be the participles of verbs, but are not certainly interpretable.
From the tenth century we begin to find documents recording Basque personal names and place names in some numbers. Most of these are recordings of bequests, tithes or donations, or the founding charters of religious establishments. The earliest of these come from Alava, the Rioja and Burgos, areas from which Basque was soon to disappear, and most are also preserved at the monastery of San Millán. The document called the Reja de San Millán, dated to 1025, lists a large number of Basque toponyms in Alava, most of them in remarkably archaic forms.
The earliest known glossary of Basque is a list of a dozen words recorded by the French pilgrim Aimery Picaud in the 12th century. Practically all of these words are instantly recognizable, though see ortzi in the dictionary for a curious case.
From the early 12th century on we find an increasing number of Latin and Romance texts containing Basque personal names, place names, words and phrases. These include the fueros (the charters granted by the Crown to provinces, cities and towns) and many other legal documents of various kinds, as well as a few personal letters.



8 R. L. Trask
The 13th-century Castilian poet Gonzalo de Berceo, who was raised in the Ebro valley, included a number of Basque words in his poems.
The earliest known connected text longer than a couple of words is a magical charm discovered in 1957 in the cathedral of Pamplona and usually dated to the 14th century.
At the end of the 15th century, the German pilgrim Arnold von Harff recorded another brief glossary; his transcriptions are garbled but mostly interpretable. In the early 16th century, the Italian humanist Lucius Marineus Siculus published an account of his travels in Spain; this contained a list of several dozen Basque words collected from an unidentified source but clearly western in form.
From the 16th century on, we find a growing number of brief Basque texts: songs, poems, prayers, epitaphs, personal letters. The songs and poems are particularly important, because they record political events that took place during the 14th and 15th centuries, and they must have been composed centuries earlier than our records of them.
All of the material discussed above is catalogued in M. (1964**{b}).
By far the longest text preserved from the period before publication began is a lengthy personal letter written in 1537 by the first Bishop of Mexico to his brother; see Otte (1979) and Michelena, Tovar and Otte (1981).
The first printed book in Basque was a collection of poems published in 1545 by the French Basque Beñat Etxepare (whose name is spelled also in several other ways).
In 1562, the Italian diplomat Niccolò Landucci compiled the earliest known Basque dictionary; since he was stationed in Vitoria (Gasteiz), the chief city of Alava, we assume that the highly distinctive variety of Basque which he recorded was the local Basque of Alava, which disappeared before linguistic work on Basque began in the 19th century.
In 1571, the French Basque Ioannes Leizarraga published a Basque translation of the New Testament. The closing years of the 16th century saw a few more publications in Basque, mostly religious and mostly minor. The first Basque book published in the south was the Refranes y Sentencias, a collection of proverbs published in Pamplona in 1596. These proverbs are written in a uniquely archaic version of the Bizkaian dialect, and this text represents our single most archaic Basque text of any size. Around the same time the historian Esteban de Garibay compiled two more collections of proverbs, also in Bizkaian, but these were not published until centuries after his death.
From the early 17th century on, publications in Basque became slowly more numerous and more varied; though most continued to be religious texts, there were also some practical handbooks and miscellaneous works. The works of the 17th-century French Basque Arnaut Oihenart, the first layman to write in Basque, are particularly important, since he wrote on a variety of topics, and thus provided us with a richer vocabulary than can be found in the religious texts.
The 18th century saw the engaging figure of Padre Manuel Larramendi, who published the first grammar of Basque and a remarkable dictionary; unfortunately, Larramendi’s dictionary contains a large number of neologisms of his own devising, which are not identified as such, thus creating headaches for etymologists ever since. The first literary works (apart from Etxepare) began to appear in the early 19th century. The end of the Carlist Wars in Spain in 1876 brought about a flowering of in Basque culture and language, the Berpizkundea, or Basque Renaissance; since then publication in and on Basque has been continuous and



Etymological Dictionary of Basque 9
copious, though it was badly interrupted by the Spanish Civil war and the subsequent Fascist oppression in the south.
1c. Historical work
No historical work worth mentioning was done on Basque before the late 1880s, when the German linguist Hugo Schuchardt began his historical studies of the language. A brilliant but exasperating scholar, Schuchardt is better known as a Romanist, as a pioneer in creole studies, and as an opponent of the Neogrammarians, but he created Basque historical linguistics almost single-handedly. In his first publication on Basque, he concluded that no Basque word beginning with /p/ can possibly be ancient in the language – a conclusion which has stood up. His etymological work was highly variable: some of his etymological proposals are accepted today, some are taken seriously but regarded as not established, and some are dismissed as untenable. Schuchardt also attempted to demonstrate the Basque nature of Iberian, but this project was a disaster: the Iberian script had not yet been deciphered, and his readings were grievously in error; moreover, he failed to distinguish the texts written in the Celtic language Celtiberian from those in Iberian, leading to absurdities. It is now accepted that the uninterpretable Iberian texts represent a language which is not discoverably related to Basque.
In the first half of the 20th century, Schuchardt’s lead was followed by the great Basque linguist R. M. de Azkue, by the Dutch scholars W. van Eys and the two Uhlenbecks, by the French linguists Henri Gavel and Georges Lacombe, by the Basque linguist Pierre Lhande (although the dictionary bearing his name was largely compiled by a group of younger scholars), and by a number of other figures. All of these workers were chiefly interested in descriptive work, but all of them at times essayed etymological proposals, and again these proposals are very much a mixed bag – though van Eys’s proposals are almost always forgettable, since the Dutchman played fast and loose with such trivia as voiceless plosives.
All of this work suffered from two serious shortcomings: a word-by-word approach which failed to recognize the Neogrammarian contribution, and a lack of acquaintance with the ideas of structural linguistics, which produced a habit of dealing with absolute sounds, rather than with phonological systems.
These intolerable shortcomings were rectified by the appearance on the scene in 1949 of the greatest scholar the Basque language has ever seen: Luis Michelena (in Basque, Koldo Mitxelena). To his unsurpassed knowledge of the language, Michelena added complete familiarity with Neogrammarian thinking and with structuralist ideas.
In the 1950s, Michelena undertook a complete reconstruction of the Pre-Basque of about 2000 years ago. To achieve this, he relied upon internal reconstruction, taking advantage of the many alternations visible in the lexicon, as well as comparative data drawn from the several divergent dialects, the Basque forms of words borrowed from Latin and Romance, and scrutiny of the medieval and early modern texts. Michelena published a brief summary of his reconstruction in 1957, and a complete account in his magisterial 1961 book Fonética histórica vasca. In spite of a few quibbles over some of the details, this reconstruction has not been challenged, and it is accepted by all Vasconists today as valid.
Continuing to work until his death in 1987, Michelena produced a huge body of historical work on Basque, including a larger number of excellent etymologies than has ever been put forward by any other specialist. Michelena’s contribution will be quickly recognized by any reader of this dictionary, since his proposals appear on almost every page. It was also



10 R. L. Trask
Michelena who finally demonstrated, in 1954, that the ancient and sparsely recorded Aquitanian language was an ancestral form of Basque. This idea had in fact been put forward in the 1870s by the French historian Achille Luchaire, but it had languished in obscurity before Michelena’s work, while most scholars pursued the ultimately fruitless goal of trying to establish the better-recorded Iberian as an ancestor or relative of Basque.
Also making important contributions to the subject from the late 1940s onward were three Spanish linguists: Antonio Tovar, Juan Corominas and Manuel Agud. The Catalan Corominas made especially important contributions to unravelling the prehistories of words shared between Basque and Romance.
In 1988, Tovar and Agud began the publication, in fascicles, of what was meant to be the first serious etymological dictionary of Basque (an earlier effort, Löpelmann 1968, is best passed over in silence). But Tovar’s death interrupted the work, and as a result the dictionary ceased publication in 1995 after covering only A-orloi. It is far from clear that this work will ever be completed. In any case, it is quite different in nature from the present book: it omits words for which the editors could find no useful discussion in the literature; it omits bound morphemes; it omits compounds and derivatives whose formation the editors consider obvious to specialists; it provides no phonological or morphological background for a nonspecialist reader; it has little to say about the numerous expressive formations; it devotes an enormous amount of space to reporting pointless resemblances between Basque words and miscellaneous look-alikes in implausible languages; and it provides thin coverage of work done since the early 1960s – though its coverage of earlier work is magisterial.
This more recent work is of some consequence. Michelena’s younger contemporary, the late philologist Alfonso Irigoyen, produced a large number of superb etymological proposals, many of them for ordinary words, though his main emphasis was on proper names, not covered in this dictionary. Further important contributions to Basque prehistory have been made by the Basque linguists Joaquín Gorrochategui, Henrike Knörr, Joseba Lakarra, J. I. Hualde, Ricardo Gómez, Koldo Sainz, Jabier Alberdi, María Teresa Echenique and Gontzal Aldai, by the Dutch linguist Rudolf de Rijk, by the French linguist Georges Rebuschi, and by the Americans William H. Jacobsen, Jr., and R. L. Trask, among others too numerous to mention.
Today Basque historical linguistics is flourishing. Even though many younger Basque linguists have been seduced into following the Chomskyan theoretical programme, and even though a number of others have chosen to pursue descriptive, dialectological or sociolinguistic work, there remains a secure core of philologists and historical linguists.
The state of play is as follows. The phonological history of the language during the last 2000 years or so is immensely well understood, except for the ancient word-accent, which remains a lively topic of investigation, and except to some extent for the aspiration, whose origins are only partly understood. The phonotactics and the morpheme-structure rules of the early language are tolerably well understood, though more work remains to be done. A hard core of some hundreds of seemingly native and ancient Basque words of unknown origin has been identified; these are marked in this dictionary as ‘OUO’. Earlier patterns of word-formation are clearly understood. Alongside the thousands of utterly transparent compounds and derivatives, we have identified many more whose origins are superficially opaque but still recoverable. Almost all of the vast number of borrowings from Latin and Romance have been identified as such, and for most of these (not all) a specific source has been found. We have securely identified a tiny number of borrowings from Celtic and from Arabic, but other cases of possible borrowings from Celtic remain controversial. We have something interesting to say about the origins of most of the bound morphemes occurring in word



Etymological Dictionary of Basque 11
formation, and about the origins of more than half of the bound morphemes occurring in nominal and verbal inflection. We know a good deal about the prehistory of non-finite verbforms, and a more modest amount about the prehistory of finite forms. The origins of most case-suffixes are opaque, though we can say something about the markers of the local cases and of the comitative. However, the prehistory of the morphology is still in many respects a closed book, though progress continues to be made, and almost nothing can be recovered of the syntax before the historical period. Most of the many expressive formations have been identified as such; surprisingly little work has so far been done on these, but this dictionary attempts (for the first time, I think) to organize these items into groups united by common patterns of formation, so far as this can be done.
1d. The modern language
Basque is an SOV language with almost all of the familiar typological features of such languages. The unmarked order {of phrasal constituents in a transitive clause} is S{ubject−}O{bject−}V{erb}, but the order of phrases is in practice rather free, and varying orders are used for thematic purposes – for example, a focused element must immediately precede the verb. However, the order of elements within phrases is rigid.
Basque is head-final, and every modifier, regardless of size, complexity or internal structure, must precede its head – with the exception of lexical adjectives, which follow their heads. Some determiners precede head nouns within noun phrases, while others follow. Genitives, finite and non-finite relative clauses, and syntactically complex adjectivals all precede head nouns. In a periphrastic verb-form, the non-finite lexical verb precedes the finite auxiliary, and a modal auxiliary precedes a primary auxiliary. Adverbial subordinate clauses and complement clauses may precede or follow their main clauses, though a complement clause attached to a head noun must precede that noun. In comparisons, the order is standard–pivotcomparative. The language is strictly postpositional, and most (not all) postpositions are case-inflected nouns.
The language is predominantly dependent-marking. For example, in a possessive phrase, only the possessor NP carries a marker of possession (the genitive case), and, in a postpositional phrase, only the NP which is the object of the postposition carries a marker (a governed case-suffix) showing the link. But argument NPs are double-marked: an argument NP carries a case-suffix, and the finite verb also agrees with it in a way that displays its grammatical role.
Basque has no grammatical gender or noun classification, except that southern varieties have recently acquired a tiny amount of sex-based gender marking from Spanish. Bare nouns cannot be inflected at all, but noun phrases are highly inflected. There is a rich case system for noun phrases, consisting of about a dozen case-suffixes with both grammatical and semantic functions. With just one exception, all noun phrases are inflected identically. The exception is animate noun phrases, which in most varieties form their local cases (only) somewhat differently from inanimate noun phrases.
Every noun phrase must contain a determiner. Most determiners are grammatically indefinite, and noun phrases containing these cannot be grammatically marked for number. Four determiners are definite: the three demonstratives and the so-called definite article, which is historically derived from the distal demonstrative. The definite determiners obligatorily mark number, singular or plural. Basque has no trace of a dual.



12 R. L. Trask
The language is strongly agglutinating and overwhelmingly suffixing, though a handful of fossilized inflectional prefixes occur, mostly in the verbal morphology. But most verb-forms are periphrastic: all verbs have periphrastic forms, and most verbs have only periphrastic forms. Only a handful of verbs have any synthetic (non-periphrastic) forms: about a dozen in the modern spoken language, though 16th-century texts show about sixty verbs with synthetic forms. A few of these verbs are used as finite auxiliaries in constructing periphrastic forms, and some of these now have no other function in the language.
Basque morphology is entirely ergative: both case-marking on noun phrases and agreement within finite verb-forms are exclusively ergative. Ergative morphology is used with all types and combinations of noun phrases, in all tenses, aspects and moods, in main and subordinate clauses, and in finite and non-finite clauses. There is no split.
*****
The segmental phonemes of modern Basque are as follows. Most varieties have the five vowels /a e i o u/. Most also have the six diphthongs /ai ei oi ui au eu/; these are not distinct from the corresponding vowel sequences, but they count as single syllables for all phonological purposes. The recently extinct Roncalese dialect had contrastive nasalized versions of all five vowels. The Zuberoan dialect adds a sixth vowel, front rounded //, notated <ü>, and it also has contrastive nasalized versions of all six, though nasalized /õ/ is absent from some varieties. Nasalized diphthongs /ãu ẽu ãi õi/ also occur in R, but not in Z. Nasalized vowels are notated in this dictionary with a tilde: <ã>.
All varieties have the voiceless plosives /p t k/, unaspirated. Eastern varieties add a palatal plosive /c/, notated <tt>, while western varieties have phonetic [c] only as an allophone of /t/ after /i/. Northern varieties also have aspirated plosives /ph th kh/, notated <ph th kh> in the traditional northern orthography, retained in this dictionary for citing northern forms.
All varieties have voiced plosives /b d g/, though these are realized phonetically as voiced approximants in most positions. A few varieties add the extremely rare voiced palatal plosive /J/, notated as <dd>.
All varieties have the nasals /m n N/, the last notated <ñ>.
All varieties historically have a voiceless lamino-alveolar sibilant, notated <z>, a voiceless apico-alveolar sibilant, notated <s>, and a voiceless palato-alveolar fricative /S/, notated <x>. They also have the three corresponding voiceless affricates, notated <tz>, <ts> and <tx>. In recent centuries, many western varieties have lost the laminal/apical contrast, though this is retained in writing. Most varieties have a fricative /f/, though a few Gipuzkoan varieties lack this. B has a voiced laminal affricate, notated <dz>, in one or two expressive words, such as dzast! ‘bang!’, and Z has a voiced apical affricate, notated <ds>, in a handful of loans from Bearnese, such as edsénplü ‘example’.
Northern varieties have a phonemic aspiration /h/.
All varieties have two laterals, /l/ and /L/, the second notated <ll>. All historically have two alveolar rhotics, a tap // (notated <r> between vowels) and a trill /r/ (notated <rr> between vowels but <r> elsewhere). In many northern varieties, however, one or both of these rhotics have become a uvular /ʀ/; this development is ignored in the dictionary.
Finally, Basque has the extraordinary diaphone |j|. According to region, this has six different phonetic realizations: a {palatal} glide [j], a voiced {palatal} plosive [J] (merging with the rare /J/), a voiced {palato-alveolar} affricate [dZ], a voiced {palato-alveolar} fricative [Z], a voiceless {palato-alveolar} fricative [S] (merging with the existing /S/), and a voiceless



Etymological Dictionary of Basque 13
{uvular} fricative [χ]. In this dictionary, following established practice, |j| is notated <j> except when it is {realized as} [S], when it is notated <x>.
The word-accent varies enormously according to region. Many western regions have a pitch accent. In these varieties, word-forms are divided into two groups: accented and unaccented. An accented form has a sharp drop in pitch at some point in the word, while an unaccented form does not. Most other regions have a stress accent, with prominent stress on one syllable of each word-form. For both types of accent, the details vary substantially from one region to another. On the whole, the stress accent has been gaining ground in the historical period at the expense of the pitch accent. The stress accent in Zuberoan and Roncalese is sometimes etymologically important, and it is then marked with an acute accent: <á>.
Word-initial rhotics are prohibited. Initial affricates are strongly disfavoured, except that many varieties prefer /tS/ to /S/ initially. Otherwise, a word can begin with any consonant, vowel or diphthong. Initial clusters are limited to two consonants and are entirely confined to loans from Romance and to expressive formations. Any consonant can occur word-medially, especially intervocalically, though |j| is vanishingly rare here. There are quite a few medial clusters, though three-consonant clusters are rare. A word-form can end in any vowel or diphthong or in one of the consonants <t k z s tz ts l r n>. There are only a handful of final clusters, always of two consonants.
In the middle of the 19th century, Bonaparte classified Basque into eight regional dialects. At the beginning of the 20th century, Azkue reorganized Bonaparte’s system into seven dialects. In the 1950s, Michelena further reorganized the system into nine dialects: Bizkaian (B), Gipuzkoan (G), High Navarrese (HN), Aezkoan (A), Salazarese (S), Roncalese (R), Lapurdian (L), Low Navarrese (LN) and Zuberoan (Z), plus the extinct and sparsely recorded Southern (Sout) dialect of Alava. Though Basque dialectologists have recently proposed a sweeping reorganization of this traditional system, Michelena’s system is used in this dictionary because almost all of the information in the literature on the regional occurrence of forms is classified within this framework.

2. The phonemes of Pre-Basque
The name Pre-Basque is given here to the earliest stage of the language for which significant information can be obtained. This is the period when Basque first began borrowing words from Latin, and so it must represent a time of about 2000 years ago. The phonemes of PreBasque were magisterially reconstructed by Luis Michelena (1961a). The reconstructed segments are as follows, where the symbols are chosen to reflect the most usual continuations of the segments in the modern language, and should not be taken as phonetically precise. The consonants fall into two groups, called fortis and lenis by Michelena.
fortis: (p) t k tz ts N L R
lenis: b d g z s n l r
vowels: i e a o u
The consonant *p was at best rare, and its existence is not certain. The segments *tz and *z were lamino-alveolar friction consonants, while *ts and *s were apico-alveolar friction consonants, as in the modern language. So far as we can judge, the two consonant series were distinguished phonetically as follows. First, the fortes were long, while the lenes were short. (The liquid *R was probably a trill, like its modern descendant rr, while *r was probably a tap, like its modern descendant r.) Second, the five fortis obstruents were completely occluded, while the five lenes were often incompletely occluded – always so for the friction consonants. Third, the segments *p *t *k were usually voiceless, while *b *d *g were usually voiced. Fourth, the segments *p *t *k could bear the aspiration, while *b *d *g could not.
Note that no *m can be reconstructed for Pre-Basque. The modern m was introduced into the language by the phonological changes P**{2}, P**{3} and P**{7}, described in section 6. Early borrowings also often contained m; see especially L**{6} in section ***{10}. The modern consonants f and j were also absent from Pre-Basque; their origins are given in section {6: P72, P36}.
The aspiration was undoubtedly present in Pre-Basque, but it seems to have been a nonphonemic suprasegmental feature; see section 3.
The modern palatal and palatal-alveolar consonants tt, dd, tx, x, ñ and ll were probably present in Pre-Basque, but these never occurred in ordinary lexical items: instead, they occurred only in expressive variants of these items. See section {11}.
The modern diphthongs ai, ei, oi, au and eu were very likely present in Pre-Basque, but they were not distinct from the corresponding vowel sequences. They differed from other vowel sequences only in that they could constitute single syllabic nuclei for such purposes as aspiration assignment. The rare modern diphthong ui was probably absent: this diphthong seems to have developed since Pre-Basque. Other vowel sequences, if these occurred at all, seemingly could not form single syllabic nuclei.
There were extensive neutralizations of fortis/lenis consonant pairs. The fortis and lenis members of each pair contrasted only word-medially, and mostly only intervocalically. Word-initially, only lenis consonants occurred, and only six of them: *b *d *z *s *l *n. Word-finally, only fortis consonants occurred, and only five of them in lexical items (*tz *ts



Etymological Dictionary of Basque 15
*L *R *N), though two more, *k and *t, were perhaps possible in inflected forms. See Section 4 below for more information.

3. The aspiration
The prehistory of the Basque aspiration is largely a mystery. In the Aquitanian texts, the letter H is very frequent, and we may suppose that the aspiration was correspondingly frequent in Pre-Basque. As explained under P**{29} in Section **{6}, the aspiration was lost from the central varieties of Basque too early to be recorded; it survived in the western varieties of Bizkaia and Araba long enough to be abundantly recorded in the early medieval period, but disappeared before the first texts in the 16th century; and it still survives today in the northern (French) varieties, except that it has very recently been lost from ordinary speech along the coast of Lapurdi. Among those northern varieties, the aspiration is decidedly more frequent in the Zuberoan dialect than in the others. In particular, the aspiration generally occurs in Z on every monosyllable which can bear it, excepting only ar ‘male’; this may be a conservative feature but is more likely a Z innovation.
In the modern varieties retaining the aspiration, the position of the aspiration is very strange: it is neither predictable nor contrastive. Some words are pronounced with an aspiration, while other words are not. We cannot predict which words will contain the aspiration, or even, in general, in which position it will occur if it is present. Yet there are few minimal pairs, and pronouncing a word with the “wrong” value of the aspiration usually gives only a less usual pronunciation of the word, or sometimes a non-word, but not a different word. Moreover, quite a few words can be pronounced either with or without the aspiration, or with the aspiration in either of two different positions, without harm.
In the historical period, the aspiration in the northern dialects is generally subject to several constraints, as follows:
(1) There can be no more than one aspiration per word. This is true even in a compound both of whose members bear the aspiration in isolation. For example, the compound of hil ‘dead’ and herri ‘inhabited place’ may be either hilerri or ilherri ‘cemetery’, but never *hilherri.
(2) The aspiration cannot occur later than the onset of the second syllable. (A tiny handful of exceptions, with an aspirated plosive in the third syllable, is reported for Z; it is hard to know what to make of these cases.)
(3) The aspiration can only occur on a syllable with one of certain onsets. Wordinitially, it can occur only if the word otherwise begins with any vowel or diphthong or with a voiceless plosive /p t k/. At the onset of the second syllable, it can occur only on a syllable which otherwise begins with any vowel or diphthong, with one of /p t k/ not preceded by a sibilant, or with any liquid or nasal except /m/. In no circumstances can the aspiration ever follow any voiced plosive, any fricative or affricate, /m/, or any plosive preceded by a sibilant.
(4) If both the first two syllables begin with voiceless plosives which might in principle bear the aspiration, then the aspiration, if present at all, will fall on the first. In other words, the structures kheke and keke are permitted, while kekhe is not found, and khekhe is of course prohibited. However, words like ikhatz ‘charcoal’ and ikhusi ‘see’ are commonplace.



Etymological Dictionary of Basque 17
Examples from northern dialects:
ari progressive particle (but also hari in places)
hari ‘thread, fibre’
ahari ‘sheep, ram’
zahar ‘old’
harri ‘stone’
haran ‘valley’
arhan or aran ‘plum’
piper or phiper or pipher ‘pepper’
thu ‘spit’
khorotz or korotz ‘dung’
khe or ke ‘smoke’
ethorri or etorri ‘come’
alhaba ‘daughter’ (but alaba in places)
urrhe or urre ‘gold’
behar ‘need, necessity’
inhurri ‘ant’
erhi ‘finger’
eri ‘ill, illness’
herri ‘inhabited place’
kholko or kolko or golkho or golko ‘bosom’ (as hiding place)
hilerri or ilherri ‘cemetery’ (from hil ‘dead’ + herri ‘inhabited place’)
There is just one circumstance in which the presence of the aspiration is predictable: in a lexical item of at least two syllables, the aspiration always separates two otherwise adjacent vowels which cannot form one of the six recognized diphthongs. Examples: behar ‘need’, bihar ‘tomorrow’, behor ‘mare’, zahar ‘old’, zuhur ‘prudent’, bahe ‘sieve’ (though bae is sparsely recorded for this one), ihes ‘flight’, ihintz ‘dew’, liho ‘flax’, aho ‘mouth’, ohe ‘bed’. The sole exception is the highly anomalous verb joan ‘go’, whose extremely irregular imperfective participle johan merely adds to the anomaly, but perhaps it is relevant that the first form descends from *eoan, with three syllables. Between vowels which can form a diphthong, the aspiration is unpredictable: sehi ‘servant’ but sei ‘six’; lohi ‘mud’ but goi ‘high place’; xahu ‘clean’ but gau ‘night’.
The constraints given above are not always obeyed in the Aquitanian and medieval written forms. *****
In his publications, Luis Michelena developed the view that the Basque aspiration is largely of suprasegmental origin, possibly having something to do with the location of the wordaccent in some ancient form of the language. This account is supported by the observation that words borrowed from Latin and early Romance frequently bear an aspiration representing nothing in the source language. Examples: ****.
However, Michelena left open the possibility that certain instances of the aspiration, particularly in word-initial position, might constitute reflexes of lost earlier consonants, most likely */p t k/. He noted the interesting point that an element TALSCO- occurs in male names in the northern part of the Aquitanian region, while an element HALSCO- is similarly found in the southern part. This at least suggests that one or more of word-initial */p t k/ might have been recently lenited to [h] in the southern varieties of Aquitanian ancestral to Basque. But, of course, this evidence is too slender to permit any firm conclusions.
See Lafon (1948), Michelena (1951a) and Michelena (1961a: ch. 11).

4. Phonotactics and morpheme structure in Pre-Basque
The following account applies to all lexical items except verbs. Verbal roots in Pre-Basque were morphologically different from all other items, and they are described in Section 5 below.
Native and monomorphemic Pre-Basque lexical items were overwhelmingly disyllabic, though we can reconstruct about fifty which were monosyllabic, some of them grammatical items like pronouns, and also a few which were trisyllabic. We begin with the disyllabic items.
A disyllabic lexical item had the general structure (C1)V(C2){.}(C3)V(C4). Any vowel or diphthong could appear in either nuclear position, but we can reconstruct no item with two diphthongs. All the consonants were optional, but, when C2 and C3 were both absent, the aspiration [h] was obliged to separate the two vocalic nuclei. There were severe restrictions on the consonants which could appear in each position, and these restrictions were made more severe by the existence of the neutralizations described above.
Only six consonants could appear in the C1 position: *b *g *z *s *l *n. The first three were frequent, the next two less frequent, and the last rather uncommon. In something like fifty per cent of lexical items, the C1 position was empty, though in some of these cases the aspiration [h] occurred initially.
In the C4 position, the only possibilities were probably *tz *ts *R *N *L. But note that the historical language possesses a handful of items with final tapped /r/; possibly Pre-Basque also allowed final *r, but it seems more likely that it did not, and that the word-final tapped /r/ of the modern language is a later development. In this dictionary, for simplicity, wordfinal *R *N *L are represented as *r *n *l unless there is some reason to do otherwise. Again, the C4 position was frequently empty.
When C2 was absent, then C3 could be any one of the sixteen reconstructed consonants, though *p was at best rare, as observed above.
When C2 and C3 were both present, producing a cluster, there were severe constraints. Only the following patterns can be safely reconstructed, and examples of some of the permitted individual clusters appear to be wanting:
one of *r *n *l plus one of *p *t *k *b *d *g *z *s *tz *ts {[+sonorant][−sonorant]}
one of *z *s plus one of *p *t *k {[sibilant, +continuant][−continuant, −delayed release, −sonorant]}
Here the symbols *r *n *l represent the neutralizations of the sonorant pairs in syllable-final positions, and *p *t *k in the second group represent the neutralizations of the plosive pairs after a voiceless sibilant. Given the heavy neutralizations of Pre-Basque, the retention of the fricative/affricate contrast in the first group seems surprising, but there is good evidence for this, at least after *r. [MORE: FHV 362-363]
The existence in the historical language of such words as ernai ‘awake, alert’ and erle ‘bee’ suggests that a very few other clusters may have been possible in Pre-Basque, but these other clusters are so rare that I hesitate to assign them to Pre-Basque. These clusters may have arisen by phonological developments such as syncope, as is commonly thought to be the case in one or two other odd cases, such as modern esne ‘milk’.



Etymological Dictionary of Basque 19
It is barely possible that Pre-Basque permitted a handful of word-final clusters, perhaps at least *-rtz, *-ltz and *-ntz. The evidence for these is considered below.
Below are some examples of disyllabic Pre-Basque lexical items.
First, with no consonants:
*a[h]o ‘mouth’; *o[h]e ‘bed’; *o[h]i ‘custom’
With C1 only:
*na[h]i ‘desire’; *be[h]i ‘cow’
With C3 only:
*ate ‘door’; *oso ‘whole, complete’; *[h]ori ‘yellow’; *ogi ‘bread’; *[h]aRo ‘proud’; *oLo ‘oats’; *otso ‘wolf’; *atzo ‘yesterday’; *uRe ‘gold’; *[h]aRi ‘stone’; *[h]obe ‘better’; *euri ‘rain’; *euLi ‘fly’; *etse ‘house’ {In The Dictionary harro ‘proud’ is treated as derived from har ‘worm’.}
With C4 only:
*e[h]un ‘100’; *ei[h]ar ‘dried up’; *oi[h]an ‘forest’
With C1 and C3 only:
*bide ‘road’; *zoRi ‘louse’; *gali ‘wheat’; *suge ‘snake’; *zuzi ‘torch’; *lepo ‘neck’; *lotsa ‘shame, fear’; *buru ‘head’; *beso ‘arm’; *begi ‘eye’; *sagu ‘mouse’; *bini ‘tongue’; *baRe ‘laughter’; *bare ‘slug’; *bete ‘full’; *luze ‘long’
With C1 and C4 only:
*be[h]or ‘mare’; *be[h]ar ‘need, necessity’; *za[h]ar ‘old’; *le[h]er {[2]} ‘pine’; *bi[h]otz ‘heart’; *bi[h]ar ‘tomorrow’; *be[h]in ‘once’
With C2 and C3 only:
*aste ‘week’; *arte ‘interval’; *[h]andi ‘big’; *azpi ‘space below’; *urzo ‘pigeon’; *erbi ‘hare’; *argi ‘light, bright’; *eltze ‘cooking pot’; *esku ‘hand’; *unbe ‘child’, *ardi ‘sheep’, *urte ‘year’, *urde ‘pig’, *alte ‘side’; *ortzi ‘sky’; *[h]ertze ‘intestine’
With C3 and C4 only:
*azal ‘skin, bark’; *[h]agin ‘yew’; *eder ‘beautiful’; *ibar ‘valley’; *izen ‘name’; *izar ‘star’; *itzal ‘shade, shadow’; *odol ‘blood’; *egun ‘day’; *aker ‘ram {billy goat}’; *[h]aran ‘valley’; *aran ‘plum’
With C1, C2 and C3 only:
*garbi ‘clean’; *barda ‘last night’; *neska ‘girl’; *golde ‘plough’; *gazte ‘young’; *zortzi ‘eight’; *zaldi ‘horse’; *senbe ‘son’, *burki ‘birch’, *zazpi ‘seven’; *giltza ‘key’
With C1, C3 and C4 only:
*sagar ‘apple’; *bizar ‘beard’; *bigun ‘soft’; *zabal ‘wide’; *banats ‘grapes’; *guren ‘edge’; *lizun ‘mildew’; *leizar ‘ash tree’; *sudur ‘nose’; *zakur ‘dog’; *gizon ‘man’



20 R. L. Trask
With C2, C3 and C4 only:
*indar ‘force’; *astun ‘heavy’; *urdin ‘green, blue’; *ergel ‘stupid’; *ezker ‘left (hand)’; *izter ‘thigh’; *ezpain ‘lip’
With all four C positions filled:
*bazter ‘edge’; *bizkar ‘back’; *gordin ‘raw’ {treated as bimorphemic in The Dictionary: see *gorr-} ; *laster ‘fast’; *beldur ‘fear’; *zintzur ‘throat’
Monosyllabic items conform to the restrictions for C1 and C4 given above, though initial *b is curiously rare here. Examples:
*ni ‘I’; *gu ‘we’; *[h]i ‘you’ (sg.); *zu ‘you’ (pl.); su ‘fire’; *laur ‘four’; *[h]aur ‘child’; *gatz ‘salt’; *[h]itz ‘word’; *[h]uts ‘empty’; *gain ‘top’; *bits ‘spume’; *zotz ‘stick’; *sats ‘ordure’; *gau ‘night’; *nor ‘who?’; *zer ‘what?’; *ur ‘water’; *[h]ur ‘hazelnut’; *ui ‘pitch’; *sei ‘six’; *gaitz ‘bad’; *on ‘good’; *zur ‘wood’; *ar ‘male’; *oin ‘foot’; *[h]otz ‘cold’; *[h]ots ‘cry, shout’; *bel ‘dark’; *bil ‘round’
Trisyllabic items are like disyllabic ones with an extra vowel added at the end. In general, only a single consonant can occur between the second and third vowels, and that consonant cannot be a plosive. In a few cases, {the nature of} this last consonant has been lost beyond recovery, though its former presence can still be detected. Examples:
*ardano ‘wine’; *gaztane ‘cheese’; *aRaNo ‘eagle’; *itsaso ‘sea’; *ituRi ‘spring, fountain’; *anari ‘ram’; *aiNala ‘swallow’; *[h]iguni ‘disgust’, *burdina ‘iron’, *buztaRi ‘yoke’; *eztaRi ‘throat’; *beraRi ‘ear’; *[h]odeCi ‘cloud’; *iz{e}Ci ‘fir’
There are almost no certain examples of trisyllables ending in a consonant, but one likely case is *enazur ‘bone’. Two possible exceptions to these constraints are ipurdi ‘buttocks’ and izerdi ‘sweat’, but these are perhaps bimorphemic in origin, if now opaque. Also problematic is gorosti ‘holly’, but there are good reasons for suspecting this of being either non-native or bimorphemic. There are quite a few trisyllabic adjectives ending in /i/, such as itsusi ‘ugly’ and egarri ‘thirsty’, but these are probably bimorphemic, containing the adjective-forming suffix -i.
Perhaps the only candidates for four syllables are the common goroldio ‘moss’ and the purely Bizkaian arerio ‘enemy’. But the first of these is suspect for several reasons, while the second is too limited in distribution to be safely assigned to Pre-Basque.
Finally, there remain a few items, all monosyllabic, which have final clusters in the historical language: beltz ‘black’, (h)artz ‘bear’, gantz ‘fat, lard’, bortz ‘five’, ertz ‘edge’, and perhaps a few others. It is not clear how we should regard these. For beltz, there is good evidence that we should reconstruct *beletz, and anyway the word is surely bimorphemic. For (h)artz, a possible IE source has been much discussed. For the others, we must take seriously the possibility that a vowel has been lost, most likely a final /a/ by the process given as M**{4} in Section 8. Note, for example, that the word for ‘alder’ is well recorded both as (h)altza and as (h)altz, with the second form undoubtedly resulting from such vowel loss.



Etymological Dictionary of Basque 21
5. The structure of verbs in Pre-Basque
In Pre-Basque, verbal roots were sharply distinguished from all other roots. A verbal root was not a free form, and it could never stand alone. A verbal root was always accompanied by at least one prefix, and in most forms by at least one suffix.
The majority of verbal roots which can be securely assigned to Pre-Basque were monosyllabic, though a modest number were disyllabic. The most frequent structure for a verbal root was -CVC-, though a fair number of roots had other structures. Verbal roots were not subject to the morpheme-structure constraints described in Section 4, and a verbal root could begin or end with virtually any consonant in the language – though reconstructible roots with initial *l or *n are at best very rare, perhaps because these consonants have not survived in intervocalic position; see P**{22} and P**{1} in section 6. Here are a few examples, but note that, for reasons explained below, it is difficult to distinguish *N from *n in root-final position, and also *L from *l.
First, roots with -CVC- structures:
*-ban- ‘give’
*-be{N}- ‘put’
*-bil- ‘be in motion’
*-dan- ‘drink’
*-dun- ‘have’
*-gin- ‘do, make’
*-gon- ‘wait, stay’
*-gos- ‘boil, cook’
*-gotz- ‘throw’
*-kaR- ‘bring’
*-kas- ‘learn, study’
*-kus- ‘see’
*-ror- ‘fall down’
*-ros- ‘buy’
*-Run- ‘lay (eggs)’
*-sur- ‘pour out’
*-toR- ‘come’
*-tzaun- ‘lie down’ (vocalism uncertain)
*-zaR- ‘put’
And some roots with other structures:
*-an- ‘eat’
*-augin- ‘come’
*-au{(}t{)}s- ‘go down’, {‘fall’}
*-auz- ‘jump’
*-ba- ‘cut’
*-izan- ‘be’
*-oa{n}- or *-oCa{n}- ‘go’
*-os- ‘sew’
*-utz- ‘leave’
As a general rule, it appears that every ancient verbal root bore a rigidly fixed transitivity, either intransitive or transitive. But later developments, mostly localized, have at times disturbed this pattern, allowing a verbal root to appear with the “wrong” transitivity.
It seems highly likely that, at some ancient stage, a dative object could be added to the diathesis of any verb, transitive or intransitive, by incorporating into the forms of that verb an additional morph, a “dative flag”, whose function was to mark the additional presence of a dative object. This pattern is still clearly visible in some verbs, but later developments have, on the whole, obscured this ancient pattern greatly. See M**{15} for discussion of this.



22 R. L. Trask
Every non-finite form of a verb bore the prefix *e-. This prefix is of unknown function, though Trask (1990) suggests that its function was to nominalize the verbal root, producing a verbal noun. The simplest possible free form of a verb consisted of this prefix attached to the root, producing the form called the “radical infinitive” or “radical” by Basque grammarians. This form survives in speech down to the present day in northern varieties, where it has a variety of syntactic functions, including serving as the object of a postposition and serving as the non-finite part of a non-indicative periphrastic form. In southern varieties, the radical is now, apart from a few fossilized expressions, confined to elevated styles, and its syntactic functions have been taken over by the perfective participle. The radical also functions everywhere as the stem of a verb in word-formation; in this position it behaves like any other lexical item, and it can be followed by word-forming suffixes or by other lexical items in compounds. This was (and is) the only way for an ancient verbal root to appear inside a nonverbal lexical item.
The prefix *e- has developed variously in the historical period, yielding any of e-, i-, j- or zero, according to the phonological nature of the following material, as described in ****{section 6: P36}.
The next simplest form is the perfective participle, which consists of the “radical” followed by the suffix -i, which in origin is probably the same ancient suffix -i which forms adjectives from nouns. The perfective participle is the syntactically central form of a verb in all varieties throughout the historical period: it is the most frequent form, and the one with the greatest number of functions, even in northern varieties retaining the radical. Almost all native speakers take the perfective participle as the citation form of a verb, and the same choice is usual in linguistic and lexicographical work, including this dictionary – though note that a few eastern speakers prefer the radical as the citation form. Accordingly, the reconstructed form of an ancient verb is cited in this book in the form *e-Root-i.
Certain ancient verbs exhibit peculiarities in their forms. These are mainly the verbs whose participles end in /n/ or in /o/; for discussion of these, see M{11} and M{12} in section **{8}.
No other non-finite forms can be confidently reconstructed for Pre-Basque. In the historical language, the perfective participle gives rise, by suffixation, to a large number of further nonfinite forms of varying functions, but these formations, all of which are transparent, may be of no great age.
In the historical language, there is a future participle, formed variously by suffixing either -ko or -en (both of obvious origin; see the dictionary) to the perfective participle, but the regional variation in the choice of suffix (in the west only -ko; in the east only -en; in the centre -ko after a vowel but -en after a consonant) points to recent formations.
The other vastly important non-finite form in the historical language is the gerund, which is formed by adding a suffix to the radical (the stem), and which retains the verbal syntax of its source verb. But there are several reasons for supposing that the gerund is a recent creation in the language: (1) the very substantial regional variation in the choice of suffix for this purpose (western -te; west-central -keta; far eastern -ta; otherwise -tze and -te in complementary distribution according to various phonological and morphological criteria); (2) the transparent origins of these suffixes as noun-forming suffixes of known functions; (3) the observation that these suffixes can also be added to verb-stems to produce ordinary verbal nouns with no verbal properties; (4) the observation that, in northern dialects, the gerund retains, in certain circumstances, the nominal property of taking its logical object in the



Etymological Dictionary of Basque 23
genitive, rather than in the usual object case, the absolutive. We may surmise, with Trask (1990), that these new gerunds have largely taken over the functions of the ancient radical.
Like the perfective participle, the gerund too can take any of a large number of transparent further suffixes to produce a number of other non-finite forms of varying functions. Particularly important among these is the imperfective participle, which is obtained by suffixing the locative case-ending -n to the gerund.
Let us apply the label prefixing verbs to these ancient verbs bearing the prefix *e- in their non-finite forms. But we must now recognize two further classes of prefixing verbs which appear to depart from the canonical pattern *e-Root-i in their perfective participles. The first group consists of those verbs whose participles end in -n, while the second group consists of verbs whose participles end in -o. Both groups appear to be verbs which once conformed to the canonical pattern but whose forms have been disturbed by phonological changes followed by some analogical reorganization; see ****{section 8: M11, M12} for discussion of these cases.
Basque verbs exhibit two kinds of inflected finite forms: synthetic and periphrastic. A synthetic form is one word-form, consisting of the verbal root plus a number of prefixes and suffixes marking tense, mood and agreement. A periphrastic form is two word-forms: a nonfinite form of the lexical verb, marked at most for aspect, and a finite auxiliary carrying all other marking. Only the prefixing verbs ever exhibit any synthetic forms, and not all of them are attested in such forms. Of the several hundred prefixing verbs, only about sixty are recorded in our earliest texts, from the 16th and 17th centuries, with any synthetic forms at all. Some of these verbs present rather full synthetic paradigms, but most are recorded with only a limited number of synthetic forms, most often the present and past indicative. Since the 16th century, the number of verbs with synthetic forms in use has been declining steadily, and today only about a dozen verbs have synthetic forms which are still in everyday use, though the Basque Language Academy recognizes synthetic forms of another two dozen or so verbs for literary use. All Basque verbs have periphrastic forms, and most verbs have only periphrastic forms. It is impossible to guess whether, at some very ancient stage of the language, every verb could be inflected synthetically.
In modern Basque, the finite auxiliary-forms for intransitive verbs are provided by izan ‘be’ in the indicative forms and by the defective and now otherwise non-existent verb *edin in the non-indicative forms. For transitive verbs, the auxiliary forms are provided by the defective verb *edun ‘have’ for indicative forms, and by the defective and otherwise non-existent verb *ezan for non-indicative forms in most dialects, but by egin ‘do’ in the Bizkaian dialect. However, our earliest texts show a greater variety of auxiliary verbs, and it appears that the modern use represents a selection from what was earlier a larger number of possible auxiliary verbs, perhaps with distinctions of function now lost.
There are only four possibilities for the non-finite element in a periphrastic form: the three participles (perfective, imperfective, future) in indicative forms, and the radical (typically replaced in speech by the perfective participle in southern varieties) in non-indicative forms.
In Pre-Basque, it was also possible to derive the perfective participle of a verb from a nominal or adjectival stem by adding to it the perfective-participle-forming suffix -i; an example is hauts ‘dust, powder’, hautsi ‘shatter, break’. Such formations are well recorded but not especially numerous.
For many centuries, however, the native participle-forming suffix -i has been wholly unproductive, and its verb-forming function has been taken over by a new suffix -tu, borrowed from Latin. It appears that Basque borrowed verbs from Latin in the form of their



24 R. L. Trask
participles, with the usual Latin ending -tum, and that the morph -tu thus obtained supplanted the native suffix. For many centuries now, all new verbs entering the language from whatever source have formed their participles only with -tu. This applies both to verbs borrowed from Latin and Romance and to verbs created within the language from non-verbal stems. Verbs in -tu never exhibit any synthetic forms at all. But note that native verbs in -i have occasionally been transferred to the -tu class, as explained in {section 8} M**{14}.



Etymological Dictionary of Basque 25
6. Phonological changes
The information presented here is taken chiefly from Michelena (1961a; 2nd ed. 1977a), with supplementary material as appropriate from many other sources. On the whole, the phonology of Basque during the last 2000 years has been rather more conservative than that of its Romance neighbours. Basque toponyms and personal names recorded as far back as the Roman period are not dramatically different from their modern forms, and loan words taken from Latin are more conservative in form in modern Basque than in Romance.
[NOTE that a following /h/ never prevents a C from being intervocalic: FHV 223 fn]
P1. Intervocalic /n/ loss (Michelena’s Law)
In the early medieval period, intervocalic */n/ was categorically lost, except when this loss was blocked by the competing P2. The medieval evidence suggests that this loss was complete by the beginning of the 11th century. The loss was normally blocked by a clear morpheme boundary, so that, for example, gizon ‘man’ + -a article yields gizona ‘the man’, and no such forms as *gizoa are recorded. However, in B we occasionally find /n/ loss even at a morpheme boundary. Loss of /n/ left behind nasalization on the adjoining vowels. The nasalization later developed in several different ways.
P1.1. Loss. Nasality was simply lost. So, for example, *zunur yields zuhur, zuur, zur ‘prudent’ in most varieties. In central varieties, nasality was lost too early to be recorded. Nasality survived in B until the 16th century, when it is expressly noted by two writers, but was lost soon after. In Z and R, loss is only sporadic, and the nasal vowels usually survive today, especially in R, which preserves more nasal vowels than Z (though R itself has recently gone extinct).
P1.2. Retention. The nasal vowels have generally (though not invariably) survived to the present day in R and Z. So, for example, *zunur yields Z zũhũr, R zũr ‘prudent’.
P1.3. Reinterpretation I. The nasality is reinterpreted as a following /n/. For example, Latin granum, borrowed as *garanu, developing to *garãũ, yields modern garaun alongside garau.
P1.4. Reinterpretation II. In B, the sequence */inV/ developed first to a sequence of nasal vowels, as usual, but this sequence was then reinterpreted as /iñV/. The first stage is well recorded in the earliest B literature, while the second is the norm during the last couple of centuries. For example, original *burdina ‘iron’ gives old B burdĩã but modern B burdiña, {cf. P2}.
P1.5. Feature shift. Very sporadically, nasality is transferred to a preceding /d/ or /t/, converting it to /n/. For example, *ardano ‘wine’, developing to *ardãõ, *ardõ, yields L LN arno, and *gaztane ‘cheese’, developing to *gaztãẽ, yields L LN Z R gazna.
P2. Assimilation of /n/
P1 was competing with another change, which sometimes won out. Intervocalic */n/ was sporadically assimilated to a preceding high vowel: to /ñ/ after /i/, to /m/ after /u/. The



26 R. L. Trask
first was very frequent, the second uncommon. For example, Latin pinum ‘pine’ was borrowed as *pinu, which developed to piñu, and Latin cunam ‘cradle was borrowed as *kuna, which yields modern kuma in some varieties, alongside kua. This development, where it occurred, protected the nasal from loss by P1.
P3. /nb/ reduction
The cluster */nb/ is usually reduced to /m/. For example, *senbe yields common seme ‘son’, and *unbe yields common ume ‘child’.
P4. Final /n/ loss
{[FHV chap. 7]}
P5. Fortition of /m/
[FHV 276]
P6. Plosive voicing after sonorants
At some time in the medieval period, plosives were voiced when immediately preceded by /l/ or /n/ (but not /r/). This voicing never applied at all in Z or R, but it is categorical elsewhere, except that it occasionally fails to happen in B. For example, alte ‘side’, preserved in Z and R, is elsewhere alde. And Latin incudem ‘anvil’, borrowed as *inkude, is today ingude in most varieties. This voicing seems to have persisted somewhat later in L LN than elsewhere: compare common elkar ~ alkar ‘each other’ with L LN elgar, and southern zanko ‘leg’, from Romance, with L LN zango. M. (1961a: 354) suggests that this voicing sometimes fails in the specific configuration */lk/, but it is possible that his examples are simply words that entered the language too late to participate.
This voicing is not triggered by /n/ resulting from P1.3 [FHV 360-361]
Ref. to local voicing after /r/: [FHV 355].
[generalization of voiceless variants of certain suffixes: FHV 353; ref. to Azkue]
P7. /b/ nasalization
Original */b/ has almost invariably changed to /m/ in the configuration */bVn/, by a process of nasal assimilation. This process clearly preceded P1. For example, original *banats ‘grapes’ has developed to *manats and then to mahats; original *bini ‘tongue’has developed *mini > mihi (and other variants); and Latin sabanum ‘covering’, borrowed as *sabanu, appears today as zamau in some varieties. In rare cases, mainly in loan words, */b/ developed to /m/ even in the absence of a conditioning nasal, as in *zubel ‘holm oak’ > B zumel.
P8. Plosive voicing fluctuation
The consonant /b/ sporadically devoices to /p/ or to /f/, especially in a second syllable, occasionally word-initially. For example, common ebaki ‘cut’, with suffix -ki, has a



Etymological Dictionary of Basque 27
variant epai, without the suffix, and common barre ‘smile’ has variants parre and farre. The circumstances of this devoicing are not understood. [REWRITE: FHV 231]
P9. Initial /b/ loss
Initial */b/ was almost always lost before a following /o/, and occasionally before a following /u/. For example, Latin buccella was borrowed as *bokeLa, yielding modern okela ‘morsel’, ‘meat’, and native buztarri ‘yoke’ appears widely as uztarri. This change seems to have been persistent: Romance forma is still recorded in the 17th century as borma ‘wall’, ‘ice’, but the modern form is (h)orma in both senses. In native words, this lost initial */b/ is often unrecoverable.
P10. /g/-/b/ fluctuation
Particularly next to the rounded vowel /u/, though not only here, there is sometimes regional fluctuation between /g/ and /b/. For example, common gurdi ‘cart’ appears in parts of B and HN as burdi, and common guraso ‘parent’ appears in L and HN as buraso. In rare cases, /d/ may also participate in this: common agor ‘barren’, localized L ador.
P11. Plosive voicing assimilation
When the first syllable begins with a voiced plosive, and the second syllable begins with a voiceless plosive (or occasionally a voiceless affricate), then leftward voicing assimilation may apply sporadically and regionally. For example, common gurpil ‘wheel’ appears in G as kurpil, eastern goipe ‘grease, oil’ appears in B and G as koipe, common girten ‘handle’ appears in B and parts of G as kirten, and common bitxi ‘ornament’ appears in many varieties as pitxi. Leftward assimilation to a voiced plosive is not well attested, but a possible example is common kedarra ‘soot’, local B gedarra.
P12. Place dissimilation
When a word contains two plosive or nasal consonants with the same place of articulation, then sporadically but frequently one of them is dissimilated to a different place of articulation. For example, aitatu ‘mention’ is aipatu in many varieties, and the loan word mobitu ‘move’ is mugitu in many varieties.
P13. Place assimilation
Far more rarely than we find the last process, we see assimilation of place. For example, paradisu ‘paradise’ is L parabisu, and common guz(t)i ‘all’ is localized B duzti.
P14. Initial velar loss or gain
Very sporadically, an initial /k/ or // is either lost or added. For example, Latin cūnam ‘cradle’ appears as ua in some varieties, and Castilian acero ‘steel’ is borrowed as both altzairu and galtzairu (with other developments).



28 R. L. Trask
P15. Plosive–sibilant fluctuation
FHV 296-297
P16. Intervocalic plosive loss
{[FHV 226-227]}
P17. /d/ ~ /r/ fluctuation
Between vowels, there is sporadic fluctuation between /d/ and the tapped /r/. For example, common edan ‘drink’ and euri ‘rain’ appear in places as eran and as eudi, and the verb meaning ‘seem’, ‘resemble’ appears as both irudi and iduri in various parts of the country. Michelena (1961a: 227) reports that historical /d/ shifts to /r/ between vowels almost regularly in certain varieties of B G HN. In Z, earlier /r/ becomes /d/ quite consistently after a diphthong, as in atxeidü ‘steel’, from earlier atxeirü.
P18. Apical assimilation I
The laminal sibilant /z/ sporadically changes to the apical /s/ before a following consonant, especially before /t/. Example: ***
P19. Apical assimilation II
The cluster /rz/, with laminal /z/, often develops to apical /s/, and the cluster /rtz/ often develops to /st/. This change is most frequent in the west, where it nearly always occurs, and least frequent in the east, where it rarely occurs. It is favoured by the presence of another /s/ in the word. For example, in some eastern varieties, in which the the abstractnoun-forming suffix is usually -(t)arzun, we find -(t)asun in words containing /s/, such as osasun ‘wholeness, health’, from oso ‘whole’. Special cases aside, original /rz/ survives in Z R S and in the Mixe variety of LN, but becomes /s/ elsewhere (M. 1961a: 362). For the second change, M. (1961a: 367) proposes the pathway */rtz/ > */rzt/ > */rst/ > /st/.
P20. Dissimilatory sibilant loss
[FHV 291]
P21. Sibilant merger
In the west, laminal /z/ and apical /s/ have merged as the apical, and laminal /tz/ and apical /ts/ have merged as the laminal. From the textual evidence of spelling confusion, this merger began in B in the 17th century, and it has been slowly spreading eastward. In recent years, the merger has gone to completion in almost all of Bizkaia, in western Gipuzkoa, and in some urban areas of central Gipuzkoa. Recently, however, there has been an educational campaign to restore the lost contrasts, and western speakers who do not natively have the contrasts now often attempt to produce them. This merger has generally been ignored in western writing, and it is ignored in this dictionary, except that we should be aware that some western forms recorded with the “wrong” sibilant are probably only spelling errors resulting from the merger.



Etymological Dictionary of Basque 29
P22. Rhotacism {of */l/}
In the early medieval period, intervocalic */l/ shifted categorically to /r/, merging unconditionally in this position with inherited */r/, except in Z, in which this change did not happen. For example, Latin colum ‘distaff’ was borrowed as *golu, which yields modern goru ‘distaff’. This change means that modern intervocalic /r/ is often of indeterminate origin. Thus garo ‘fern’ might be from *garo or from *galo. [FHV 314]
P23. Lenition of fortes
The inherited fortes */N/ and */L/, which had contrasted with lenis */n/ and */l/ only between vowels, no longer contrasted with these after P1 and P{22}, and they therefore became lenis, merging with the instances of */n/ and */l/ surviving in other positions. For example, Latin castellum ‘castle’ and annōnam ‘provisions’, borrowed as *gazteLu and *aNona, appear today as gaztelu and anoa. In medieval toponyms, the graphs <nn> and <ll> are frequent for modern <n> and <l>: see M. (1961a: chs. 15, 16).
P24. Rhotic dissimilation
In the sequence /rVrr/, the first (tapped) rhotic is unstable, and commonly dissimilates to /l/, /d/ or zero; if zero, P{35.1} may apply to break up the hiatus. For example, original *berarri ‘ear’ appears today as all of belarri, bedarri, biarri and begarri. Much less frequently, any rhotic may dissimilate to /l/ or be lost if the word contains any second rhotic, as in the widespread adore ‘ardour’, from earlier ardore.
P25. Sporadic /r/ loss
Intervocalic /r/ is sporadically lost in all varieties. This loss is especially frequent in inflectional endings, as when dative singular -ari is pronounced -ai, but it can also occur in lexical items, especially those with a grammatical function, as when the common aspectual verb ari izan ‘be engaged in’ is pronounced ai izan. Such variants are given in the dictionary when they have found literary use. [PREVIOUS] [ASS{ADD} LOSS OF FINAL /-r/, AS IN LAUR]
P26. Zuberoan /r/ loss
In Z, intervocalic tapped /r/ is lost, at least in ordinary speech, though it may be variably retained in careful speech. For example, common buru ‘head’ is Z bü(r)ü. A following /h/ does not prevent the loss: for example, earlier érhi ‘finger’ is modern éhi. In this dictionary, the lost /r/ is indicated as shown, with a parenthesized (r).
P27. Uvularization
In L LN, the two rhotics /r/ and /rr/ have been undergoing uvularization for some time now; the resulting sound is typically a voiced uvular fricative, decidedly “scrapier” than the standard French /r/, but rather more similar to the typical southern French pronunciation of /r/. This development appears to be very recent, since d’Urte’s description of L pronunciation in the early 18th century presents only the historical coronal articulations of both phonemes. The facts are quite various: in some varieties,



30 R. L. Trask
only the trill is uvularized; in others, chiefly or only the tap; in still others, both. In at least some varieties, there is fluctuation between coronal and uvular versions of a single word. According to variety, then, such pairs as hura ‘that one’ and hurra ‘the nut’ may or may not become homophones. This development is never represented in writing, and it is ignored in this dictionary.
P28. Vocalization of /l/
In a tiny handful of cases, syllable-final /l/ has seemingly developed to /u/. [FHV 311].
P29. Aspiration loss
We may be confident that the aspiration was pervasive in Pre-Basque, as it clearly is in the Aq. names. In the central dialects, G, HN and the Pyrenean varieties, the aspiration was lost so early that there is no record of it. In the west, the aspiration is abundantly recorded in Bizkaia and Alava in toponyms and personal names in the medieval period, but it had vanished by the 16th century, the time of our first texts in these varieties. In the north, the aspiration survives down to the present day, except that it has very recently been lost from colloquial speech along the coast of Lapurdi, where the aspiration was still regularly written in the 17th century. The aspiration is clearly more frequent in Z than in L and LN; it may be that Z has simply retained more of the inherited aspirations than the other northern varieties, but equally it may be that Z has extended the aspiration to words which formerly lacked it. We cannot tell. This change is not expressly noted in individual entries.
P30. Automatic palatalization
In B, and to some extent in G Z R, the coronal consonants /z s tz ts t l n/ are automatically palatalized to /x x tx tx tt ll ñ/, respectively, in the configuration */iCV/ (and sometimes also in word-final */iC/). In order to save space, this palatalization is not overtly represented in this dictionary. So, for example, mila ‘1000’ should be read as representing milla in these dialects. If the preceding /i/ is part of a diphthong, it often disappears, as in the development of noiz ‘when?’ to B nox, and of (h)aize ‘wind’ to B axe. In R, wordinitial */in-/ frequently develops to /ñ-/.
There is good reason to believe that such palatalization was once general in the language, but that it has been lost in central dialects; see P**{32}.
P31. Spontaneous palatalization of /n/
[FHV 306-307]
P32. Depalatalization
In L LN A, and in parts of HN, all palatal consonants other than those arising from expressive palatalization (see ***{section 8: M9}) were depalatalized at some point. For example, piñu ‘pine’, arising by P**{30} from Latin pinum, appears today as pinu or pino in these varieties, and the Gascon word grigne ‘preoccupation’, ‘passion’, borrowed as griña, is today grina in these varieties (but still griña elsewhere). [FHV 184, 195, 521]



Etymological Dictionary of Basque 31
P33. Cluster reduction [first of three]
{[FHV 367-368] loss of sonorant from [sonorant][sibilant][plosive] clusters}
P34. Sporadic /n/ or /l/ insertion
Very occasionally, an unetymological /n/ or /l/ is inserted before a plosive or a sibilant. For example, common ikatz ‘charcoal’ has a variant inkatz, and Castilian acero ‘steel’ appears in some varieties as altzairu or as galtzairu.
P35. Treatment of hiatus
Hiatus is strongly disfavoured, and there are several strategies for dealing with it when it arises. Hiatus arises extensively in nominal and verbal inflection, not treated here, but also from the loss of an intervocalic consonant (especially /n/), and at morpheme boundaries in word-formation.
P35.1. Consonant insertion. A consonant is inserted between the vowels. The dialects retaining the aspiration use /h/ for this purpose where /h/ can legally appear (between the first two syllables). Otherwise, the favoured consonant is /g/, though we sometimes find /b/ instead next to a rounded vowel, and occasionally /d/ or /r/. For example, northern bihar ‘tomorrow’ and aho ‘mouth’ appear in some western varieties as bigar and ago; original *anate ‘duck’, from Latin anatem, became *aate by P1, and appears today as ahate in the north but as agate in some western varieties. Castilian suerte ‘luck’ is borrowed into some varieties as suberte.
P35.2. /i/ insertion. Occasionally a hiatus is resolved by the insertion of /i/. This solution is more usual in inflection, and is very rare in lexical items. For example, da ‘is’ plus the L LN question particle -a produces archaic daia? ‘is it’, modern dea, and the noun-forming suffix -tza plus the article -a occasionally appears as -tzaia. This process feeds P**{55}.
P35.3. Vowel loss. One of the two vowels may be lost: usually the first one, occasionally the second one. For example, original *ukaondo ‘elbow’ appears today as both ukondo and ukando, and original *daen ‘which is’ yields western dan, eastern den ‘all’. {And see W14 below.}
P35.4. Vowel dissimilation. Sometimes the hiatus is retained, but the first vowel dissimilates in height from the second. For example, behar ‘necessity’ appears as biar in some western varieties. This process is frequent when the article -a is added to a stem, as in bide ‘road’, bidia ‘the road’; see M**{6} in **{section 8} for some consequences. However, the rare stem-final sequence /-aa/ develops in B to /-ae/, as in *eLana > *elaa > elae ‘swallow’ (bird).
P35.5. Vowel coalescence. If the vowels in hiatus are identical, they commonly coalesce into a single vowel. For example, *zunur ‘prudent’ became *zuur in some varieties, coalescing to modern zur.
P35.6. Diphthong formation. Certain vowel sequences may form diphthongs. Most obviously, such sequences as /au/ and /ai/ immediately form diphthongs when they arise: for example, northern ahuntz ‘goat’ and nahi ‘desire’ appear as auntz and nai in the varieties which have lost the aspiration. Moreover, /ae/ and /ao/ may be converted to the diphthongs /ai/ and /au/, respectively. For example, (h)aren, genitive of *har



32 R. L. Trask
‘that’, was reduced to (h)aen (attested), modern (h)ain ‘so (much)’. Less obviously, /ee/ often becomes /ei/, as in zeren, genitive of zer ‘what?’, reduced to *zeen, modern zein ‘which?’.
Sequences of three vowels are treated variously, but in a sequence of the form /ViV/ it is usually the last vowel which is lost. For example, jaioterri ‘homeland’ is jaiterri in places.
P36. Treatment of initial /e/ in participles
Word-initially, the vowel /e/, which occurred in all ancient non-finite verb-forms as the prefix *e-, has developed variously according to the nature of the following segments.
P36.1. Loss. Before a following high vowel /i/ or /u/, /e/ is lost: *eizani > izan ‘be’; eutzi (attested) > utzi ‘leave’.
P36.2. Glide formation. Before a following non-high vowel /a/ or /o/, /e/ becomes a glide /j/: *eaRi > jarri ‘sit down’; *eosi > josi ‘sew’. This process feeds P**{56}. There is no certain case of /e/ before /e/, but a possible instance is the verb jalgi ~ elki ‘go out’, which perhaps results from *eelki, with glide formation in one form but coalescence of the two /e/s in the other (M. ****{1977a: 515}).
P36.3. Raising. When the /e/ is followed by a consonant followed by a high vowel /i/ or /u/, and a third syllable exists, /e/ is raised to /i/: ebili (attested) > ibili ‘be in motion’; ekusi (attested) > ikusi ‘see’. This is part of the more general process P**{37}.
In all other circumstances, /e/ remains unchanged: ekarri ‘bring’, egosi ‘cook’, *egini > egin ‘do, make’.
P37. Raising of first-syllable /e/
In the first syllable of a word of three or more syllables, /e/ is frequently raised to /i/ if the second syllable contains a high vowel /i/ or /u/ separated by a consonant. For example, common eguzki ‘sun’ is iguzki in some varieties, and the word for ‘onion’, borrowed from Lat. cepulla(m), has everywhere /i/ in the first syllable: tipula, gipula, etc. This process is pervasive in verbs: see P**{36.3}.
P38. Syncope
Syncope occurs occasionally in all varieties. For example, common andere ‘lady’ appears as andre in some varieties. Syncope is pervasive in the Pyrenean dialects (R S A). Here it even occurs in disyllables, so that, for example, common zara ‘you are’ appears as zra, producing an initial cluster otherwise unknown in the language. {Cf. P64.}
P39. Metathesis of /oi/
Metathesis is frequent but unsystematic, and in general no rules can be given. But an exception occurs in A, S and part of HN, in which word-final /-oi/, from earlier */-one/ by P1, consistently metathesizes to /-io/. For example, common arratoi ‘rat’, from Lat. ratone(m), is arratio in these varieties.



Etymological Dictionary of Basque 33
P40. Loss of final vowels
Word-final /a/ or /e/ is very occasionally lost, with consequent devoicing of any now-final plosive. For example barda ‘last night’, preserved in the east, has become bart in the west. And the first-singular ergative verb-agreement suffix -da becomes -t everywhere (except in R) when word-final.
P41. Initial vowel loss
Very sporadically, a word-initial vowel is lost in some varieties. For example, common etorri ‘come’ appears as torri in some local varieties. These local forms are not usually included in the dictionary, but exceptions are made in one or two cases where this process appears to be involved in otherwise problematic etymologies, as in common ke ‘smoke’, alongside regional eke.
P42. Vowel loss after /rr/
In a polysyllabic loan word containing a prothetic vowel followed by the trill /rr/, a following vowel is often lost. For example, Lat. renegare ‘renounce’ appears as ernegatu id.
{[}P43. Bizkaian vowel harmony {] Duplicates P64.}
P44. Bizkaian /a/-raising [aa > ea, possibly ia]
P45. {Diphthongization of /a/} /a/ diphthongization
Very frequently, /a/ in the first syllable of a polysyllabic word diphthongizes to /ai/ before a following coronal cluster. For example, Rom. santo ‘holy’, borrowed as *santu, is today everywhere saindu ‘holy’, ‘saint’, and laster ‘fast’, which predominates in the early texts, is today more usually laister. This development seems to have been persistent. [DUPLICATE{= P50}]
P46. Diphthong reduction I
Sporadically but frequently, the diphthong /au/ develops to /ai/ or to /a/ when the next syllable contains /u/, and the diphthong /ai/ is sometimes reduced to /a/ when the next syllable contains /u/ or /i/. For example, For example, Latin caucu(m) ‘wooden bowl’ appears as kaiku ‘wooden cup’, and itaundu ‘ask’, from itaun, is itandu in some varieties.
At some stage, diphthongs lost their second elements before a following cluster. This led to alternations in the forms of certain words, and, as a result, the original diphthong was sometimes restored. For example, ***** [+ RESTORATION] [FHV 95]



34 R. L. Trask
P47. Diphthong reduction II
Sporadically, the diphthong /ei/ is reduced to /i/. This change is almost categorical in word-initial position. For example, leizar ‘ash tree’ is more commonly lizar, and eihar ‘dried up’ appears much more widely as ihar ~ igar. {cf. P37}
P48. Diphthong nucleus raising
The two diphthongs /ai/ and /au/ develop sporadically to /ei/ and /eu/, respectively, particularly in word-final position. For example, common jai ‘festival’ is jei in some varieties, and gaun ‘spider’s web’ appears in parts of B as geun. In a few cases, the change may be in the other direction: for example, there is evidence that gei ‘material’ is more conservative than the more widespread gai.
{[}P49. Diphthong dissimilation [au] > [ai] before /u/ [DUPLICATES P{4}6] {]}
{[}P50. Diphthongization of /a/
Sporadically but frequently, the vowel /a/ in the first syllable of a polysyllabic word diphthongizes to /ai/, especially when followed by a coronal cluster. For example, earlier *santu ‘holy’, ‘saint’ is usually saindu today, and laster ‘fast’, which predominates in the early texts, is today more commonly laister. This development seems to have been persistent. [DUPLICATE {=P45}] {] P50 in The Dictionary changed to P45.}
P51. Bizkaian /ai/ reduction
In a final syllable, even in a monosyllable, the diphthong /ai/ is reduced to /a/ in B when followed by /n/. Examples: common gain ‘top’, ezpain ‘lip’, B gan, ezpan. Less frequently, /ui/ is reduced to /u/, as in common biguin ‘soft’, B bigun. [ADD -oin > -uin > -un: FHV 507, 488]
P52. Roncalese diphthongization
R exhibits a curious diphthongization in certain words. For example, common diru ‘money’ and zeru ‘sky’ appear in R as deuri and zeuru, respectively.
P53. Vowel fortition
The rounded vowels /o/ and /u/ are frequently strengthened to [w], the details depending on the variety. This phonetic fact is not represented in this dictionary. However, in B G, this [w] is, when intervocalic, strengthened further to an allophone of /b/, and this is often represented in writing. For example, B G ao ‘mouth’ and gau ‘night’ combine with the article -a to produce aba ‘the mouth’ and gaba ‘the night’. These combining forms are noted in the dictionary.



Etymological Dictionary of Basque 35
P54. Glide insertion I
In B, G and the Pyrenean varieties, a glide is inserted between a high vowel and a following non-high vowel. For example, egia ‘truth’ and the loanword suerte ‘luck’ are often pronounced egi[j]a and su[w]erte, respectively. These pronunciations are not overtly represented in this dictionary, but they often feed P**{55}.
P55. Glide strengthening I
Glides resulting from P**{53, P54} frequently undergo strengthening, [j] to any of [J], [Z]
or [dZ], and [w] to [ß], an allophone of /b/. These pronunciations are regularly represented in the traditional spelling of the varieties {in which this occurs}, such as egiya for egia ‘truth’ and suberte for suerte ‘luck’. Such spellings are recorded in this dictionary only when they might render the identities of words obscure.
P56. Glide strengthening II
Word-initial /j/, usually resulting from P**{36.2}, undergoes some kind of strengthening
in almost all varieties. Depending on variety, the result may be any of [J], [dZ], [Z], [S] or [χ], with the last development, typical of G, apparently borrowed from Castilian. So, words like jan ‘eat’ and jaun ‘lord’ exhibit a wide variety of quite different local pronunciations, but this dictionary follows the usual convention in Basque work of writing <j> In all cases, except where /j/ is [S], when <x> is written.

P59. Bizkaian /e/ lowering
In B, /e/ is often lowered to /a/ before a following trilled rhotic. So, common berri ‘new’ and gerri ‘waist’ appear in B as barri and garri. In one case, this also happens before /l/: common beltz ‘black’, B baltz. Though typical of B, this lowering is found sporadically in other varieties, above all in the widespread bardin ‘same’ for common berdin, from the stem ber- ‘same, self’. The lowering never occurs in word-initial position: such words as (h)erri ‘country’ and erdi ‘half’ never undergo lowering.
P60. High-vowel lowering
Very sporadically, /i u/ are lowered to /e o/ before a following sequence /rC/ or, less commonly, /lC/. For example, irten ‘go out’ is G erten, and common bi(h)urtu ‘twist’ is B biortu, while beldur ‘fear’ is western bildur. {S.v. beldur Trask decides beldur is the original form, with bildur by vowel height assimilation.}



36 R. L. Trask
P61. Raising of /e/ before /n/
Sporadically, /e/ is raised to /i/ before /n/. For example, earlier *(h)arena ‘sand’, from Latin arena(m), became Z *harina, leading to modern Z hariña, and earlier *enor ‘anybody’ developed to *inor in many varieties, leading to modern iñor.
P62. Raising of /e/ before a palatal
Sporadically, /e/ is raised to /i/ before a following palatal consonant. For example, common etxe ‘house’ is itxe in places, and common (h)ertsi ‘squeeze’ and eutzi ‘leave, developing to *etxi in B, have become modern B itxi. Very rarely this raising occurs before an ordinary sibilant, perhaps by mediation of a palatalized form, as in pisu ‘weight’, from Cast. peso.
P63. Lowering of /e/ in trisyllables {(dissimilation)}
Sporadically, the vowel /e/ is lowered to /a/ in the second syllable of a trisyllable which contains /i/ in the first and third syllables. For example, common igeri ‘swimming’ has a variant igari. {Cf. P64}
P64. Bizkaian vowel harmony
In B, and also in a small area of HN, /a/ is raised to /e/ when the preceding syllable contains a high vowel /i/ or /u/. This change mainly affects inflected forms, but occasionally it shows up in a lexical item, as in iteun ‘confession’ for itaun. {Cf. P63.}
P65. Bizkaian /i/-backing {(backness dissimilation)}
In many cases, word-initial /i/ appears in B as /u/. This process appears to be confined to disyllables in which the second vowel is /i/ or /e/. Examples: common ile ‘hair’, igel ‘frog’, (h)iri ‘town’, regional B ule, ugel, uri. The reason is unknown.
P66. Fronting of /u/ before labials {(labial dissimilation)}
Sporadically, /u/ is fronted to /i/ before a labial consonant. For example, common umore ‘humour’ is G imore, and common ubi ‘ford’ is ibi in places.
P67. Fronting of /u/ before a vowel
Sporadically, /u/ is fronted to /i/ before a vowel. For example, egubakoitz ‘Friday’, ‘Saturday’ becomes eguakoitz in some varieties, developing to egiakoitz. In Z and R, this process is pervasive with word-final /u/, where it has apparently proceeded via P**{69}. When the article -a or another vowel-initial suffix is added, the original sequence /-ua/ develops to Z /-üia/ > /-üa/ or /-ia, R /-uia/ > /-ia/. Reanalysis can then produce a free form with final /-i/ for original /-u/.



Etymological Dictionary of Basque 37
P68. Fluctuation between /i/ and /u/
Sporadically, we find regional variation between /i/ and /u/ in a variety of positions. In many cases, but not in all, it is clear that /u/ is conservative. For example, common mut(h)il ‘boy’ is Z R imit(h)il, and common zubi ‘bridge’ is localized R zibi. {Cf. P66.}
P69. Zuberoan fronting of /u/
In Z, and in some eastern varieties of LN, /u/ is fronted to /ü/ (phonetic []) in all circumstances except before a following tapped /r/, before apical /s/, or before a cluster /rt/ or /rd/. (Note that a following trilled /rr/ or a sibilant /ts z tz/ does not prevent the change.) Examples: common gu ‘we’ but Z gü; guri ‘to us’ and Z gu(r)i; hirur ‘three’ (with a tap) and Z hirur; hur ‘nut’ (with a trill) and Z hür; guzi ‘all’ and Z güzi; urr(h)e ‘gold’ and Z ürhe; urde ‘pig’ and Z urde; huts ‘empty’ and Z hüts; burk(h)i ‘birch’ and Z bürkhi. In eastern LN, the fronting is also blocked by a following /k/ or /nk/, and in places also by a following /g/ or /n/.
However, this regular pattern is disturbed by complex mutual assimilations among /i/, /ü/ and /u/. Examples: common irun ‘weave’, but Z ürün for regular *irün; common iduri ‘seem’ but Z üdürü for regular *iduri; and so on {P70}.
In Z, as part of the same process, the diphthongs /au/ and /eu/ develop to /ai/ and /ei/ or /ü/, respectively: common gauza ‘thing’, Z gaiza; common leun ‘smooth’, Z leñ (via *lein); common euskal- ‘Basque’, Z üskal-. This change happens everywhere except before one of /r/, /rr/, /s/ or /ts/.
In R, the diphthongs /au/ and /eu/ change to /ai/ and /ei/, respectively, as in R gai ‘night’, gaiza ‘thing’, ein ‘100’ for common gau, gauza, e(h)un.
These changes affect only ancient instances of /au/; instances of /au/ developed more recently from other sources, such as */aCo/, do not undergo the change.
See Lafon (1962a, 1962b) for discussion; Lafon sees this fronting as resulting from contact with Bearnese.
P70. Zuberoan and Roncalese high-vowel assimilation [see above]
In Z and R, there is assimilation among high vowels. In Z /i/ is rounded to /ü/ in a word also containing /ü/ (from P**{69}), while in R /i/ is rounded and backed to /u/ in a word also containing /u/. For example, common il(h)un ‘dark’ is Z ülhün (via *ilhün), R ulun, while common irun ‘spin’ is Z ürün (via *irün), R urun.
P71. Zuberoan raising of /o/
In Z, the vowel /o/, including nasalized /õ/, is raised to /u/ in circumstances which are hard to define. This raising always occurs before syllable-final /n/, but otherwise its occurrence seems erratic. For example, common gizon ‘man’ appears in Z as gizun. This raising follows P**{69}, the fronting of /u/. M. (1961a: 55) suggests that this raising may have been borrowed from Bearnese. A similar raising occurs far more rarely and sporadically in L and LN, as in L LN untzi ‘container’ for common ontzi. M. (1961a: 56) suggests that confusion of /o/ and /u/ before syllable-final /n/ may have been an ancient feature of the language.



38 R. L. Trask
P72. Irregular coalescence
Certain sequences may give rise to irregular coalescences. For example, auhari ‘dinner’ has become afari in many varieties (/uh/ {[wh]} > /f/); common joan ‘go’, which is [xwan] in G and some B varieties, has become fan in places ([xw] > /f/); and the same word, which is [Jwan] in L LN, has become gan in places ([Jw] > /g/).
P73. Zuberoan stress shift
In Z (and apparently also in R, though the facts are less clear here), the inherited wordaccent was at some stage replaced by an invariable stress on the penultimate syllable. This shift clearly happened before certain vowel sequences in the last two syllables underwent coalescence. So, for example, common gizon ‘man’ is Z gízun, while its definite form gizona ‘the man’ is Z gizúna. Common neska ‘girl’ is Z néska, while its definite form neska is Z neská, with final stress, reflecting an earlier form *neská-a. Because of this, a Z form with final stress often points to a lost consonant, as in Z izéi ‘fir tree’, which must continue an earlier *izeCi, with an unidentified consonant.



Etymological Dictionary of Basque 39
7. Rules applying in word-formation
The rules given below represent phonological processes which are typical of older formations, both compounding and suffixation. These rules are often not respected in more recent formations. For example, ur ‘water’ has the regular combining form u- in older formations, like uhalde ‘waterside’, but often ur- in more recent formations, like urtxakur ‘otter’. But even recent formations may occasionally show the older combining form, by analogy. And some words have clearly undergone re-formation. For example, ardo ‘wine’, whose older combining form is ardan-, yields both ardandegi ‘tavern’ and ardotegi, with the same meaning, the second being a re-formation. Examples of hiatus arising in wordformation are handled by the processes described in P**{35} above. The principal source of information in this section is Michelena (1961a). {Trask (1997: 183−192) gives a somewhat fuller account of these phenomena.}
W1. Trisyllabic final-vowel loss
If the first element is three or more syllables long, and ends in a vowel, that vowel is lost. For example, itsaso ‘sea’ has the combining form itsas-, as in itsasalde ‘seaside’ (alde ‘side’) and itsasgizon ‘sailor’ (gizon ‘man’), and iturri ‘spring, fountain’ has the combining form iturr-, as in iturburu ‘fountainhead’ (buru ‘head’).
W2. Disyllabic final-vowel changes
If the first element is two syllables long, and ends in a vowel, that vowel is treated as follows.
W2.1. /i/ loss. A final /i/ is lost, except after /b/, when it remains. For example, harri ‘stone’ has the combining form har(r)-, as in hargin ‘stonecutter’ (-gin ‘maker’) and harbel ‘slate’ (*bel ‘dark’). But zubi ‘bridge’ has the combining form zubi-, as in zubiburu ‘bridgehead’ (buru ‘head’). A handful of items, including hiri ‘town’ and hegi ‘hill’, are consistent exceptions to this rule.
W2.2. Non-high vowel neutralization. Final /a/, /e/ and /o/ are all neutralized as /a/. For example, aza ‘cabbage’ has the combining form aza-, as in azalore ‘cauliflower’ (lore ‘flower’); lore ‘flower’ has the combining form lora-, as in loratu ‘bloom, blossom’ (-tu verb-forming suffix); asto ‘donkey’ has the combining form asta-, as in astakeria ‘foolishness, stupidity’ (-keria noun-forming suffix of vices).
W2.3. Variable treatment of /u/. Final /u/ behaves variably. It may remain unchanged, it may be lowered to /a/, or it may be lost. On the whole, loss is most frequent in the east, while lowering is most frequent in the west. For example, buru ‘head’ has combining forms buru- and bur-, as in buruko ‘cap’ and burko ‘pillow’ (-ko nounforming suffix), while katu ‘cat’ has combining form kata-, as in katakume ‘kitten’ (-kume ‘offspring’). M. (1961a: 128, note 5) suggests that lowering to /a/ results from Romance influence, with pairs like kantu ‘song’, combining form kanta- deriving from Rom. canto, canta-. The item sagu ‘mouse’ is unusual: it shows loss of /u/ in all old formations in all dialects.



40 R. L. Trask
W3. Final-plosive neutralization
If, by W1 or W2 or otherwise, a plosive is final in the first element, this plosive becomes /t/. For example, begi ‘eye’ has combining form bet-, as in betile ‘eyelash’ (ile ‘hair’) and betazal ‘eyelid’ (azal ‘skin’). The labial plosives /b p/ never occur in this position, and so never undergo this process. [+ h]
W4. Plosive-cluster reduction
If, by the preceding rules or otherwise, a plosive cluster arises, then the second plosive becomes voiceless and the first drops. For example, begi ‘eye’, combining form bet- by W2.1 and W3, combines with buru ‘head’ to yield bepuru ‘eyebrow’, and with gain ‘top’ to yield bekain ‘eyebrow’. And errege ‘king’, combining form erret- by W1 and W3, combines with bide ‘road’ to yield errepide ‘highway’. See also L***{?}.
It is clear that this process proceeded historically in stages, as follows. First, the first plosive changed uniformly to /t/. Second, this /t/ then devoiced the second plosive, if it was voiced. Third, the /t/ dropped. For example, the word errepide ‘highway’, just cited, is recorded in ****{the Fuero General de Navarra} as erret bide.
W5. Treatment of final /h/
[FHV 222] {When, as a result of W2.1 /h/ in the first element is final, it becomes /t/ just like a plosive (W3), with cluster reduction as in W4: behi ‘cow’, combining form bet-, combines with gorotz ‘dung’ to give bekorotz ‘cow dung’; zohi ‘turf, clod’ combines with berri ‘new’ to give zoperri ‘recently worked plot’.}
W6. Affricate formation
If, by any process, /t/ stands before a fricative at a morpheme boundary, the two segments coalesce into the corresponding affricate. For example, ardi ‘sheep’ plus *-zani ‘guardian’, via *art-zãĩ, yields artzai(n) ‘shepherd’.
W7. Plosive-sonorant cluster reduction
If a plosive comes to stand before a sonorant, the plosive is lost. For example, the verbal prefix -bait- (several functions) combines with the finite forms naiz and luke to produce bainaiz and bailuke, and bat ‘one’ combines with distributive -na(n) to yield bana(n) ‘one apiece’.
W8. Treatment of sibilant-sibilant clusters
[FHV 351]
W9. Sibilant-sonorant cluster reduction
eluke, enaiz, etc; not many others; [FHV 351]



Etymological Dictionary of Basque 41
W10. Final /n/ alternations
A final /n/ in the first element changes to /r/ or is lost. On the whole, change to /r/ is usual before a vowel, and loss before a consonant, but there are exceptions. For example, egun ‘day’ has combining forms egur- and egu-, as in eguraldi ‘weather’ (aldi ‘time’), eguzki ‘sun’ (-zki noun-forming suffix), and eguerdi ‘noon’ (erdi ‘middle’). [ADD nasal clusters: FHV 355 fn, nonnahi] [FHV 355 fn for /nm/]
W11. Final /r/ loss
If a first element ends in /r/ (whether tapped or trilled in the historical language), that /r/ is lost in word-formation. For example, ur ‘water’, zur ‘wood’ (both with taps), izter ‘thigh’ and adar ‘branch’ have the combining forms u-, zu-, izte- and ada-, respectively: ubil ‘whirlpool’ (*bil ‘round’), zubi ‘bridge’ (bide ‘way’), iztegi ‘groin’ (-egi ‘place’), adabegi ‘knot’ (begi ‘eye’).
W12. Rule inversion
By P**{22}, intervocalic */l/ changed to /r/, but, by W1 and W2, the vowel following the */l/ was often lost in word-formation before P**{22} occurred. This produced alternations like gari ‘wheat’ (from *gali), galburu ‘head of wheat’. Original */r/ did not alternate. But, in many cases, the alternation has been reinterpreted, with the secondary /r/ taken as underlying and the original /l/ still appearing in word-formation taken as resulting from a rule. In effect, P**{22} has been inverted. This can be seen in cases like eastern zamari ‘horse’, borrowed from Latin sagmarium ‘pack-horse’, with original /r/, whose combining form is now zamal-, as in zamaldun ‘horseman’.
W13. Haplology
Haplology is pervasive. Whenever word-formation produces two consecutive syllables which are identical or similar, one of them is lost. For example, sagar ‘apple’ plus ardo ‘wine’ “should” yield *sagar-ardo, but the form is sagardo, and uko ‘forearm’ plus garai ‘high’ “should” yield *ukagarai, but the form is ukarai.
W14. Hiatus resolution
If for any reason two vowels come together at a morpheme boundary, then there is a powerful tendency to eliminate the hiatus. Most commonly, this is done simply by losing one of the vowels, most often the first one. For example, the compound of uko ‘forearm’ (combining form uka-) and ondo ‘bottom’ was originally ukaondo, recorded in one early text, but today the word is ukondo in most varieties, though a few western varieties have ukando. On the whole, B preserves the hiatus longer than other varieties. However, if the first element is monosyllabic, then the varieties retaining the aspiration commonly insert /h/ to break up the hiatus, as in gauherdi ‘midnight’, from gau ‘night’ plus erdi ‘middle’. [ALSO W13] {Cf. P35.3.}



42 R. L. Trask
W15. Neutralization {of affricate−fricative contrast}
The ordinary neutralization processes of the language apply in word-formation. In particular, only a fricative /z/ or /s/ can occur before a following consonant, and not an affricate, while only an affricate /tz/ or /ts/ can occur in most varieties after another consonant, and not a fricative. Moreover, only a voiceless plosive can follow a (voiceless) sibilant. So, for example, hitz ‘word’ plus -dun ‘having’ yields hiztun ‘eloquent’, with neutralization of the sibilant to the fricative and devoicing of the plosive after a sibilant. Note that the orthography does not always represent this devoicing: for example, itsaso ‘sea’ plus gizon ‘man’ yields itsaskizon ‘sailor’, which is customarily written itsasgizon. These predictable neutralizations are not expressly noted in the entries.
W16. Sibilant harmony
A Basque lexical item may contain only laminal sibilants (/z tz/) or only apical sibilants (/s ts/). When, by word-formation or borrowing, both orders of sibilant arise in a single word, the laminal assimilates to the apical. For example, zin ‘truth’ combines with -etsi ‘consider’ to yield archaic zinetsi, modern sinetsi ‘believe’, and Castilian francés ‘French’, originally borrowed as frantzes, is today usually frantses. [SEE FHV 282, 284 fn]
W17. /a/-addition
A few monosyllabic nouns occasionally exhibit a mysterious final /a/ in their combining forms. For example, ke ‘smoke’ shows a combining form kea- in keatu ‘smoke (meat)’ (-tu verb-forming suffix), and or ‘dog’ shows a combining form ora- in orakume ‘puppy’ (-kume ‘offspring’). The origin of this is unknown in general, though in a few cases there is evidence that this extra /a/ continues an earlier vowel: for example, ke ‘smoke’ has a sparsely recorded B variant kee, whose combining form would regularly be kea-.
W18. Plosive insertion
Not infrequently, when two vowels come together at a morpheme boundary in wordformation, a plosive is inserted; this may be either /t/ or /k/. For example, su ‘fire’ combines with alde ‘side’ to yield sukalde ‘kitchen’ and with ondo ‘side’ to yield sutondo ‘fireside, hearth’. The origin of this is not known. The /t/ might result from generalization of the result of W3. But all of this is doubtless bound up somehow with the phenomenon discussed under M**{2}.. [SEE ALSO FHV 249, 250]
W19. Final-element reduction
In word-formation, a final element may undergo various irregular reductions. Most obviously, /h/ cannot survive in a third or later syllable, and must drop. But other intervocalic consonants may also drop, and the resulting vowel sequences may be reduced in one way or another. Lastly, medial vowels may occasionally be lost. Such a reduced form is occasionally generalized to the free form. Examples: gabe ‘without’ is often -ge as a final element; bahe ‘sieve’ becomes -bae or -be; bide ‘road’ may become -bi; biga ‘two’, formerly postposed, becomes first bia and then bi as a free form; beltz ‘black’, always postposed, appears to derive from earlier *beletz.



Etymological Dictionary of Basque 43
W20. Aspiration
If both members of a compound contain the aspiration, then one aspiration must drop. For example, hil ‘dead’ plus herri ‘inhabited place’ can yield either hilerri or ilherri ‘cemetery’, but never *hilherri.
More generally, compounds and derivatives need not respect the aspiration of source words. For example, neke ‘tired’ plus -tu verb-forming suffix yields nekhatu ‘get tired’.



44 R. L. Trask
8. Some morphological observations and problems
Collected here are some morphological and word-class observations and some morphological puzzles which show up in several words.
M1. Pyrenean initial velars
Words with initial /h/ in the dialects retaining the aspiration consistently have initial zero in the remaining dialects. The same is largely true of the several demonstrative stems, all of which have initial /h/ in the aspirating dialects, but the three Pyrenean dialects (R S A) frequently have instead initial /g/ or /k/ in these stems, and only here. For example, ****
M2. Fluctuating plosives
A number of word-forming suffixes exist in two forms: one with initial /t/ or /k/, the other with no initial consonant. Examples include -tar / -ar ethnonymic, -keta / -eta activity, and -kume / -ume ‘offspring’. In addition, some suffixes with initial voiceless plosives appear to be cognate with independent lexical items lacking the plosives: -koi ‘fond of’, ohi ‘custom’. The reason for these alternations is not known. Some of these may once have contained initial voiced plosives which have dropped after a vowel and devoiced after a consonant, producing the observed variants. For example, -tar / -ar may derive from *-dar.
M3. Extraction of suffixes
{**** See the entries under extraction of suffixes in the Subject index.}
M4. Loss of final /a/
This is not a phonological change, but an analogical one. The Basque article is -a (singular), -ak (plural): gizon ‘man’, gizona ‘the man’, gizonak ‘the men’. When this suffix is attached to a word ending in /a/, then, in all varieties but B and Z, the two vowels simply coalesce: neska ‘girl’, neska ‘the girl’, neskak ‘the girls’. This has often led to uncertainty about whether a given word does or does not end in /a/, and hence a final /a/ has sometimes been analogically removed. For example, gorotza ‘dung’, whose definite form is also gorotza, has been re-formed to gorotz in some varieties, and katea ‘chain’, from Lat. catena(m), is kate in some varieties.
M5. Bizkaian final /e/ lowering
This is not a phonological change, but an analogical one. In B, the addition of the article -a to a word ending in /a/ causes the first /a/ to raise to /e/, by P34: hence, with neska ‘girl’, the definite form is neskea, rather than common neska. The alternation between definite neskea and indefinite neska has, in B, often been extended to words originally ending in /e/. So, for example, common lore ‘flower’ and ote ‘gorse’, definite forms lorea and otea, appear as lora and ota.



Etymological Dictionary of Basque 45
M6. Final stem-vowel fluctuation
Process P**{35.4} merges stem-final /e/ with /i/ and /o/ with /u/, as in bide ‘road’, bidia ‘the road’. As a result, the form occurring before the suffix is sometimes generalized, and we find fluctuation like that in eize ~ izi ‘hunting’.
M7. Loss of affixes before -ko
Loss of loc, com before -ko
M8. Extraction of forms with final /e/
The local case-suffixes, such as locative -an (from earlier *-Can), ablative -tik and allative -ra, all require the insertion of the unmarked vowel /e/ when they are added to consonantfinal stems. For example, (h)aran ‘valley’ has locative (h)aranean, ablative (h)aranetik and allative (h)aranera. When the noun in question is a spatial noun whose local forms function as postpositions, then quite frequently a new form of the noun is extracted with a final /e/ attached, and where necessary with a new meaning. For example, (h)atz ‘track, trace, trail’ forms postpositions like atzean ‘behind’, and from these forms a new base form atze ‘back’ has been extracted.
In northern varieties, the frequent occurrence of toponyms in the local forms has led to the addition of a final /e/ to every single toponym which formerly ended in a consonant, as in Miarritze ‘Biarritz’ and Urepele (from ur ‘water’ and epel ‘tepid’).
M9. Expressive palatalization
****
In which intrinsically connected with smallness, expressive palatalization is practically universal. For example, earlier tipi ~ tiki ‘small’ is now seldom found outside elevated styles, and the palatalized forms ttipi, txipi, txiki are the only ones found in ordinary speech.
Personal names: [FHV 189]
Rare process: addition of initial sibilant: [FHV 292]
Important stuff: [FHV 191]
M10. Replacement of base forms by diminutives
As explained in M9, Basque forms an expressive or diminutive variant of a lexical item by palatalization. Not infrequently, this diminutive displaces the original as the unmarked form of the word. In such a case, the original may remain as a more formal variant; it may be specialized to another meaning; or it may disappear. For example, guti ‘not much, not any’ is usually replaced as the ordinary form by its diminutive gutti or gutxi, while guti remains in the language as a formal or elevated counterpart of the same meaning. And original zakur ‘dog’ has been everywhere displaced as the ordinary word by its diminutive (t)xakur, while zakur is either specialized to ‘big dog’ (in most of the country) or lost altogether (in B).



46 R. L. Trask
M11. Verbs in -n
Most ancient verbs built on verbal roots have a perfective participle (citation form) of the structure e-Root-i, where the prefix e- is of unknown function but appears in all non-finite forms of ancient verbs, and the suffix -i marks the perfective participle. Examples: etorri ‘come’, ikusi ‘see’. But quite a number of verbs are exceptional. Their participle has the form e-Root[-n], in which the suffix -i is absent and the root ends in an -n which sometimes behaves like part of the root and sometimes not. Examples: joan ‘go’, egin ‘do, make’. As a rule, the /n/ remains in the perfective participle and in the radical, but it disappears in the synthetic finite forms (where these exist), and in word-formation when a suffix or a following lexical item is added. Trask (1990) proposes that these were once verbs of ordinary form whose roots happened to end in /n/, and that the loss of intervocalic /n/ by P1 produced anomalous forms which then underwent analogical reorganization. This analysis is supported by the observation that the participles of the two verbs eman ‘give’ and igan ‘go up’ are each recorded once in the early texts as emai and as ikai.
M12. Verbs in -o
There are also a number of ancient verbs whose citation forms end in -o, such as jo ‘hit’, ito ‘drown’ and ero ‘kill’. These verbs exhibit a number of peculiarities, some of them shared with the verbs in -n, and indeed there are verbs variably belonging to both groups, such as igan ~ igo ‘go up’. It seems likely that the verbs in -o are historically verbs in -n which have undergone further complex developments, but the history of these verbs cannot at present be recovered.
M13. Exceptional stems with an extra /i/
{****}
M14. Shift from the /-i/ class to the /-tu/ class
In a number of cases, verbs have been shifted from the -i class to the -tu class. Examples: old sarri, modern sartu ‘enter’, ‘insert’ (from an unknown stem); old aberatsi, modern aberastu ‘get rich’, ‘enrich’ (from aberats ‘rich’); ****. This process can also affect the unusual verbs in -n and in -o described in the next two sections: old (and still current) jario ~ jarion ‘flow’, regional variant jariatu.
When this shift happens, sometimes the old participle remains fossilized in the language as an adjective. Examples: ezagutu ‘be acquainted with’ (verb), ezagun ‘familiar, wellknown’ (adjective and old participle); ****
M15. The dative flags
There is a good deal of evidence for the former existence of two suffixes, of the forms -ki and -ts-, occurring in both finite and non-finite forms of verbs. The function of each suffix was to increase the valency of a verb by adding a dative object to its diathesis. When -ki is added, the participial suffix -i is suppressed; when -ts- is added, this is followed by the usual -i in the participle. There is a modest amount of evidence from old B that -ki was once added to intransitive verbs and -ts- to transitive verbs, but this



Etymological Dictionary of Basque 47
distinction is not generally observed. Examples: ****. We cannot tell whether these elements arose in finite forms by the incorporation of non-verbal elements and were then extended analogically to non-finite forms, or whether they arose first in non-finite forms; the first seems more likely.
The problem of pairs like ikasi / irakatsi: see FHV 289 fn. Three solutions: ancient alternation; addition of /ts/ dative flag; generalization of word-final variant.
M16. Fossilized compound verbs
A compound verb consists of two parts, a simple lexical verb and a second element which is most often a bare noun, sometimes a bare adjective, occasionally a suffixed noun. Basque forms compound verbs freely, and has clearly done so for a long time. But the patterns used have varied over the centuries – in particular, the choice of lexical verb to provide the verbal element. In the historical language, egin ‘do’ is by far the most frequent choice, though we also find compounds involving eman ‘give’, *edun ‘have’, izan ‘be’, and the item -etsi ‘consider’, now specialized as a suffix-like item but in origin clearly the independent verb etsi, today with multiple senses.
But other verbs were possible in the distant past, and the language retains a number of ancient fossilized compound verbs whose formation is often obscure. These things behave today like single lexical verbs, but they are distinguished from other verbs in several respects: (1) unusual length; (2) unusual phonological forms; (3) enormous regional variation in form. These verbs are entered normally in the dictionary, together with our best guess as to the etymology, if we have one. Examples include eguriki ‘wait for’, itxadon ‘wait for’, eskaini ‘offer’, jaurtiki ‘throw’, ihardetsi ‘resist’, ihardun ****{‘spend time, be busy’, not in The Dictionary, but see iharduki under *ihar}, jardun ****{‘be busy with’}, ****.
M17. Nouns and adjectives
In the historical period, adjectives are sharply distinguished from nouns, and a stem can be shifted from one class to the other only by the use of a suitable word-forming suffix, which normally adds semantic value. Examples: mendi ‘mountain’, menditsu ‘mountainous’; labur ‘short’, laburtasun ‘shortness’. The existence of the clearly ancient adjective-forming suffix -i, as in gatz ‘salt’, gazi ‘salty’, appears to suggest that the noun/adjective distinction is ancient.
However, there exist some two dozen seemingly ancient items which can function indifferently as nouns or as adjectives. Examples: gose ‘hunger’ or ‘hungry’; ilun ‘darkness’ or ‘dark’; hotz ‘cold’ (noun) or ‘cold’ (adjective); gizen ‘fat’ (noun) or ‘fat’ (adjective). This observation has led some specialists to suggest that, at some very ancient stage, the language did not systematically distinguish nouns and adjectives. [FHV 512]
M18. Sex-marking
Generally speaking, Basque has no grammatical gender. Sex-marking is severely limited; when present, it is handled lexically (behi ‘cow’, zezen ‘bull’), by compounding with eme ‘female’ and ar ‘male’ (katu ‘cat’, katar ‘tomcat’), or by affixation (jainko ‘god’, jainkosa ‘goddess’). But the Spanish Basque varieties have recently imported a limited amount of sex- or gender-marking from Spanish, as in the adjective majo ‘nice’, borrowed together



48 R. L. Trask
with its female form maja; the second form is applied only to females, while the first is used in all other circumstances. Very sporadically, this sex-marking has been carried over into native words. For example, B G gixajo ‘poor fellow’ has acquired a female form gixaja ‘poor woman’, by analogy with the Romance gender-marking.
M19. Motion verbs
As a rule, Basque verbs of motion incorporate path but not manner. Alongside the fundamental verbs of deictic motion, joan ‘go’ and etorri and jaugin ‘come’, there are many verbs like igan ‘go up’, jautsi ‘go down’, irten and atera ‘go out’ and sartu ‘go in’, and there is a dedicated verb of undirected motion, ibili ‘be in motion’. But there are practically no lexical verbs corresponding to English verbs like ‘walk’, ‘ride’, ‘swim’ and ‘crawl’. Apart from one or two borrowed verbs, like kurritu ‘run’, the exceptions are compound verbs constructed with the light verb egin ‘do’ plus an adverbial of manner, such as hegaz egin ‘fly’, from hegaz ‘on wing’ (from hega ‘wing’). Otherwise, manner of motion must be expressed by combining a suitable motion verb with an adverbial, such as oinez ‘on foot’ or zaldika ‘on horseback’. So, where English has ‘He walked down’, Basque has Oinez jautsi zen, literally ‘He descended on foot’.
M20. Absence of certain consonants from the morphology
Certain consonants – those which were absent or marginal in Pre-Basque – play little or no part in Basque morphology.
The consonant /m/, absent from Pre-Basque, plays no role at all in the inflectional morphology, and no role in word-formation except in the noun-forming suffix -men ~ -mendu, borrowed from Lat. -mentum. A partial exception is the expressive syllable ma-, apparently created precisely because the rarity of /m/ in the language conferred upon it a special expressive value.
The consonant /p/, very rare or even absent in Pre-Basque, has no morphological role except occasionally as a conditioned variant of /b/ or of /m/, as in the suffix -pe ‘under’, from behe, and in the variant -pen of the suffix -men just mentioned. It is wholly absent from the inflectional morphology.
The consonant /j/, absent from Pre-Basque, has no morphological role, apart from its marginal role as one reflex of the ancient and fossilized prefix *e- in non-finite verbforms.
The consonant /h/, present in Pre-Basque but apparently non-phonemic, has no morphological role except that, in the varieties retaining the aspiration, the absolutive agreement prefix in finite verbs is h- for the second-person singular pronoun hi.
The several palatal consonants, of uncertain status in Pre-Basque but assuredly not present in ordinary lexical items, continue to have practically no morphological role apart from their use in constructing expressive and diminutive forms. Perhaps the sole exception is the intensive suffix -xe {not in The Dictionary}.
Finally, the consonant /f/, absent from Pre-Basque, has no morphological role.
Every other modern consonant has a more or less prominent role in the morphology, though the apical sibilants /s/ and /ts/ are less frequent than the others.



Etymological Dictionary of Basque 49
9. The sources of the Basque lexicon.
Many hundreds of morphologically simple Basque words appear to be clearly native and ancient. These are the words which cannot be sensibly related to words in any neighbouring languages and which have phonological forms consistent with our reconstruction of the PreBasque of some 2000 years ago. This group includes nouns like buru ‘head’, adjectives like handi ‘big’, numerals like zazpi ‘seven’, grammatical words like edo ‘or’ and ni ‘I’, and verbs like etorri ‘come’. Not all of these words are necessarily 2000 or more years old in the language, but all of them are strong candidates for such age.
This native lexicon includes pronouns and most grammatical words, numerals, many bodypart names, most basic adjectives (including some colour terms), a sizeable number of names of wild and domesticated plants and animals (though quite a few such names are borrowed), almost all words for weather and natural phenomena like the sun and the moon, most names of geographical features, some tool names, a few names of metals, names of familiar materials like wood and stone, most kinship terms, all the words like ‘man’ and ‘girl’, a scattering of agricultural and pastoral terms, and the great majority of basic verbs.
Unsurprisingly absent from the native lexicon are words pertaining to law and administration, to religion, to education, to literature, and to commerce. More surprisingly absent are nautical terms: in spite of the long seafaring traditions of the Basques, there is perhaps not a single nautical term which is native. There are also very few native words pertaining to social organization or to cooking, and there are almost no native words for weapons.
In addition, there are thousands of compounds and derived words constructed from native elements. Some of these are surely or even unquestionably very ancient, while others have been coined during the last 2000 years, and of course still more are being coined today. To some extent, we can distinguish older from newer formations by their phonological forms, but we cannot do this unfailingly.
But Basque has been in intense contact with a number of identifiable neighbouring languages for well over 2000 years, and these languages have had an immense effect on its lexicon. (There must have been earlier neighbours, of course, but about these we know nothing.)
During much of the first millennium BC, Basque was largely surrounded by Celtic languages. These languages have bequeathed a sizeable number of certain or probable toponyms, but almost no ordinary words. We are confident that arrau(n) ‘oar’ and mando ‘mule’ are of Celtic origin, and cases of varying degrees of persuasiveness have been made for maite ‘beloved’, adar ‘horn’, andere ‘lady’ and hartz ‘bear’, among others, but on the whole the absence of Celtic words in Basque is striking, given the centuries of contact.
Around 2000 years ago, the Romans conquered the Basque-speaking region, and the impact of Latin on the Basque lexicon was as enormous as the Celtic influence had been slight. Latin words began passing into Basque from a very early date, to judge by the highly conservative forms of Basque words like errege ‘king’ and gerezi ‘cherry’.
As spoken Latin developed into Proto-Romance, further borrowings into Basque exhibit Romance developments in pronunciation, as in zeru ‘sky’ (from earlier *zelu), and in semantics, as in abere ‘large domesticated animal’ (from a Romance development of Latin
habere ‘have’).
After the collapse of Roman power in the west, the Basques found themselves in contact with speakers of two Germanic languages, Frankish and Visigothic. But there exists no single clear instance of a Germanic loan directly into Basque, without Romance mediation. To be



50 R. L. Trask
sure, though, Basque relations with Franks and Visigoths were uniformly hostile, and anyway it is far from clear that the Franks, and more especially the Visigoths, continued to speak their Germanic languages for any great length of time after settling in France and Spain. In any case, Basque words of undoubted Germanic origin, like hanka ‘haunch’, have all entered the language directly from Romance.
In contrast, the Arab conquest of most of Spain produced a handful of Basque words of Arabic origin. Some of these, like azoka ‘market’1 and gutun ‘letter’ (epistle) (and other senses) are not attested in Romance, and may have entered Basque directly. Others, like azenario ‘carrot’, are shared with Romance, and may or may not have entered via Romance.
With the eventual break-up of spoken Latin into a number of divergent local varieties, Basque found itself in contact with the following: the Gascon and Bearnese {and other Gascon} varieties of Occitan to the north, Aragonese (particularly its Navarrese sub-variety) to the east, Castilian to the south, and Asturian to the west. But the ensuing flood of Romance words into Basque was rather unevenly distributed: Gascon, {or specifically} Bearnese, and Castilian contributed huge numbers of words, Aragonese a much smaller number, and Asturian perhaps none at all. (This generalization is based on the clear cases, but of course there are many Romance words in Basque whose precise source cannot be identified with confidence.)
Before the French Revolution, Basque was scarcely in contact with French, and early borrowings from French are rare to non-existent. Since the Revolution, borrowings from French have become steadily more numerous, and the modern French Basque varieties contain many hundreds of French words, but hardly any of these have penetrated south of the Pyrenees. In the south, of course, the steadily growing prominence of Castilian has meant that practically all newer borrowings are taken from this variety.
There appears to be no other language which has contributed directly to the Basque lexicon. Words originating in other languages, such as antxoa ‘anchovy’, of Italian origin, and the recent gay ‘gay’ (homosexual), of English origin, have entered via one of the neighbouring Romance varieties. A rare exception, though, appears to be the word porlan ‘cement’, from English Portland; this word is unrecorded in Spanish and appears to be a direct borrowing.2
Naturally, Basque writers have never hesitated to coin neologisms whenever they saw fit to do so, and those neologisms which have found a place in the language are entered normally in the dictionary. But there are two large groups of proposed neologisms which require special attention.
In 1745, the Basque grammarian Larramendi published one of the first Basque dictionaries, but one with a curious feature. Whenever Larramendi found no native Basque equivalent for a Spanish word, he invented one, with no clue to the reader that he was doing so. Some of these neologisms were constructed according to the ordinary patterns of the language, like sudur-hauts ‘nose-powder’, for ‘snuff’, while others seem to have been coined out of thin air, like godaria ‘chocolate’. Though some of Larramendi’s inventions were occasionally picked up and used by later writers of puristic bent, hardly any of them have found a secure place in the language, and his coinages are accordingly omitted from this dictionary.
A second large-scale intervention was made in the 1890s by the Basque nationalist Sabino Arana, who proposed a large number of neologisms, all but a few of them intended to
1 {NB however OCast. azogue (1279), Old Cat. açoc (1315).} 2 {Though it is not in the Diccionario de la Real Academia Espanola, porlan ‘concrete’ is, in fact, attested in Spanish since 1942 (Camilo José Cela, La familia de Pascual Duarte). Spanish Porlan ‘(the isle of) Portland’ is attested since 1449.}



Etymological Dictionary of Basque 51
replace everyday Basque words of non-native origin. Arana was a purist, but one with a shaky command of the language. Some of his coinages, like eratorri ‘derive’, were technically correct in form, but many more, like his ingi ‘paper, gotzain ‘bishop’ and gaztedi ‘youth’, were ghastly things doing violence to the ordinary rules of the language. A few of his creations have found a secure place in the language, though not always in the form or in the sense that he proposed, and these are entered normally here. A few others maintain a ghostly existence on the margins of the language, used self-consciously by a few enthusiasts but by nobody else. And the rest are no more than museum pieces. These others are not entered in the dictionary.

10. Phonological treatment of loan words.
Basque began borrowing words from Latin very early, and the forms it borrowed were in most respects the classical Latin forms, except that there is no trace in Basque of Latin /h/ (probably lost from popular Latin speech by the first century BC) or of Latin word-final /m/ (probably also lost early, or at least reduced to nasalization of the preceding vowel).
Thanks especially to the medieval data, we can often distinguish the forms of early borrowings from later ones. For example, Latin fagum ‘beech’ appears today as both bago and pago, but the medieval toponymy shows only bago, apparently confirming that this was the form borrowed early, while pago is a later development. See M. (1961a: passim).
Naturally, the strategies used in assigning phonological forms to borrowed words have changed over the centuries, as the phonology of Basque has gradually been assimilated to that of its Romance neighbours.
L1. Latin plosives
Latin word-medial /p t k/ are borrowed as /p t k/, and word-final /t/, when borrowed at all, is borrowed as /t/. Latin medial /b d g/ are usually borrowed as /b d g/, but see *** and *** for complications. Medial /d/ may appear as /r/, by P**{17}. The Latin medial clusters /pp tt kk/ are borrowed as /p t k/, and the rare medial clusters /bb dd gg/ are also borrowed as /p t k/, presumably because of their duration.
Latin word-initial /p t k/ are usually borrowed as /b d g/, since Pre-Basque had no other initial plosives. Initial /b d g/ are also borrowed as /b d g/.
Borrowed /p t k/ are subject to aspiration in the aspirating varieties, by the usual rules (see ***{section 3}).
L2. Romance plosives
As a rule, Rom. /p t k b d g/ are borrowed as /p t k b d g/ in all positions, but there are many exceptions word-initially, and it must be said that the voicing of Romance plosives is not consistently respected in this position. Original /d/ may appear between vowels as /r/, by P**{17}.
Rom. /p t k/ are subject to aspiration in the aspirating varieties, by the usual rules (see ***{section 3}).
L3. Labials
In line with P**{7-10}, there are complications in the borrowing of Latin and Romance labials. Almost any Latin or Romance labial may on occasion be borrowed as almost any Basque labial. See also ***.
L3.1. /w/, /f/ and /v/. All of Lat. /w/ (orthographic <v>), Lat. and Rom. /f/ and Rom. /v/ are usually borrowed as /b/ (occasionally as /p/ for /f/), but there are complications introduced by ***. [ALSO as /f/, zero]



Etymological Dictionary of Basque 53
L4. Sibilants
Latin /s/ is usually borrowed as laminal /z/, except word-finally, where it usually appears as /tz/. This suggests that Latin /s/ was laminal ; see M. (****{1961a: 280−281}). But there are a very few exceptions, in which Lat. /s/ appears as apical /s/, such as soka ‘rope’, from sōcam id.
The Cast. and Occ. apical /s/ is usually borrowed as apical /s/, or as /ts/ word-finally. Fr. laminal /s/ is borrowed as /z/.
Very rarely in early borrowings, but commonly in recent ones, a final sibilant is borrowed as /z/, as in arroz ‘rice’, from Cast. arroz id.
L5. Liquids
Latin and Romance liquids are usually retained. Thus original /L (<ll>) r rr/ are borrowed as /L (<ll>) r rr/. But, in early borrowings, intervocalic /l/ appears today as /r/, by P**{22}, while /r/ between vowels may appear as /d/, by P**{17}.
L6. Nasals
Latin and Romance /m n N/ are usually borrowed as /m n N/, but the borrowing of /m/ is subject to the complications of ***{?L7}, and that of /N/ to P**{32}. In rare cases, /m/ is borrowed as /nb/ as in [FHV 360], apparently by hypercorrection for the cases in which Rom. /nb/ has become Basque /m/ by P**{3}.
L7. Resolution of /mn/
The Latin and Romance cluster /mn/ is always reduced in Basque, but the result may be either /m/ or /n/. Examples: Lat. autumnum ‘autumn’ > Bq. autono ‘September’, while Gasc. hemne ‘female’ > Bq. eme ‘female’. So far, it has not proved possible to tie either outcome to any particular times or places.
L8. Plosive-liquid cluster elimination [FHV 347 ff.]
loss of plosive
insertion of echo vowel
lenition of plosive
L9. Lambdacism
Occasionally, at least in loan words, an initial /d/, /t/ or /n/ appears as /l/. For example, Fr. danger appears as lanjer in some varieties, Lat. thēcam ‘pod’ as leka ‘pod’ in some varieties, and Cast. naranja ‘orange’ as laranja in many varieties.
L10. Vowels
Latin short /i e a o u/ are borrowed as /i e a o u/. Latin long /ī ē ā ō ū/ are also borrowed as /i e a o u/. Basque therefore preserves the quality of Latin vowels, but ignores quantity.



54 R. L. Trask
Lat. /au/ is borrowed as /au/. There is no trace in Basque of Lat. /ae/ or /oe/, which always appear as /e/, as in *baLena ‘whale’ (> modern balea) from Lat. ballaenam.
The Latin sequence /-iu(m)/ is always reduced in Basque, usually to /-i/, occasionally to /-u/. For example, mercātārium ‘merchant’ is borrowed as merkatari.
Romance /i a u/ are borrowed as /i a u/. Rom. /e/ and /E/ are both borrowed as /e/, and Rom. /o/ and /O/ are both borrowed as /o/. But there is an exception for Romance wordfinal /o/, which is commonly borrowed as /u/. This perhaps arises because the medieval Basques noted many cases in which their own word-final /u/ (taken from Lat. /u/) corresponded to Rom. /o/, as in Bq. liburu ‘book’ (from Lat. librum) beside Cast. libro, and concluded that /u/ was the appropriate rendering of Romance final /o/. Rom. /y/ is usually borrowed as /u/.
The Romance diphthongs /ie/ and /ue/ are usually borrowed as /e/, as in leku ‘place’, from some Romance development of Lat. locum of the approximate form *lueco. Other Romance diphthongs are usually retained.
L11. Prothetic vowel
Basque has never tolerated word-initial rhotics. In loan words of all periods, a borrowed word containing an initial rhotic in the source language acquires a prothetic vowel, usually /e/ (the unmarked vowel in Basque), occasionally /a/ when the following vowel is /a/ or /o/. Examples: Lat. regem ‘king’ > errege; Lat. rosam ‘rose’ > arrosa; Lat. Roma ‘Rome’ > Erroma.
Basque has also never tolerated word-initial clusters of the form /sC-/. When such a word is borrowed, it acquires a prothetic vowel, almost always /e/, though this /e/ may develop to /i/ by other processes. Examples: Lat. stupam ‘oakum’ > iztupa; Lat. spatham ‘sword’ > ezpata. Since the same process applied in all of western Romance, it is not always easy to tell whether the direct source of a Basque word is Latin or Romance
L12. Aspiration
Basque introduces the aspiration into loan words without regard for its presence or absence in the source. For example, we have hira ‘anger’ from Lat. or Rom. ira, hauzu ~ haizu ‘permitted’ from Lat. ausus, hezkabia ‘ringworm’ from Lat. scabies, phike ‘pitch’ from Lat. picem, and so on. As a rule, in a borrowing from Latin, the aspiration occurs, if at all, only on the syllable which was stressed in Latin, though there exist a couple of exceptions. [FHV 218]

12. Ghost words
Vasconists have at times inferred the former existence in Basque of words or affixes which are nowhere recorded as such but for which they have thought they could present good evidence for a former existence. Some of these proposals, such as those for *bel ‘dark’, *bil ‘round’, and *har ‘that’ are so well supported that their former existence is not in doubt, and these are entered normally in the dictionary. Others, such as *ez- ‘tree’ and *-ar collective suffix, are far from secure but are sufficiently intriguing to merit inclusion in the dictionary, with suitable cautions. Still others, such as *margo ‘colour’ and *lagi ‘law’, are certainly or almost certainly errors, but these ghost words have nevertheless entered the language to at least some extent, and so they must be included in the dictionary with explanations of their dubious origins.
But there remain a few proposals which have been widely accepted by my predecessors and colleagues as plausible, but for which I judge the supporting evidence to be wholly inadequate. In my view, these proposals are no more than phantasms. Nevertheless, since some of these items have been widely discussed, not least by hopeful comparativists, who often seem to find them more beguiling than real Basque words and affixes, I provide below a list of these items, together with my reasons for dismissing them.
In addition, I include here a number of non-existent forms which have somehow crept into the literature but which have been identified as ghost words by my predecessors.
*adarnatu ‘lop, prune, trim’.
I follow M. (****{1970a: 139} Arb) in rejecting this hapax cited by A. (1905) from Araquil {Araquistain}. This is very likely a typo for intended adarratu (q.v. s. v. adar). {adarratu not in The Dictionary.}
*afantua ‘wall’.
Given in the Supplement to Larramendi, 436, this is a misreading of asentua, written with a long S (M. ****{1970a: 105} Arb).
*ageru An error in Lh. for intended aieru.
*akoipezerrea ‘tortilla’.
In Araquil {Araquistain}. A misreading of a coipez errea ‘fried in oil’, with Rom. a + koipe ‘oil’ + -z instrl./advbl. + erre ‘burn’ + -a article.
*anigua (Arbelaiz) ****{M. 1970a: 140, misreading of añegua in Araquistain.}
*arnari ‘fruit’.
A misreading by Azkue of the R ending -arnari, for standard -arenari ‘to the one of which’ (M. ****{, 1958d; 1970a: 45} Arb).
*aroldea ****{M. 1970a: 140} (Arb)
*atangala ‘frog’. A blunder in Araquil {Araquistain}. (M. ****{1970a: 141} Arb).
*axorbe ‘insect’.
Another one of Araquil {Araquistain}’s, non-existent {words} according to M. (1970{a: 141} ****)



56 R. L. Trask
*b(e)- body-part prefix
Uhlenbeck (19227), noticing that a number of body-part names, often especially names of paired body parts, begin with a morph be- or bi- or at least b-, proposed the former existence in Basque of a supposed body-part prefix *be-, now fossilized within certain body-part names. He suggested a possible connection with bi ‘two’, though the observations that this word derives from (attested) biga, and that this item was anciently postposed (not preposed) are not obviously helpful. Michelena (****{1958a}) took this proposal seriously, but preferred to see a possible origin in ber- ‘self’, ‘same’, the stem used to construct reflexives, supposing that the alleged prefix might represent a fossilized marker of inalienable possession, roughly ‘one’s own’. Indeed, few Vasconists have seen fit to query the reality of this prefix.
However, the evidence for the reality of this former prefix is slender indeed – so slender, I suggest, that its existence cannot plausibly be defended. Here is a list of all the body-part names which begin, or formerly began, with /b/, omitting obvious compounds and derivatives, but including marginal words: bare ‘spleen’, begi ‘eye’, belar ‘forehead’, belaun ‘knee’, *berarri ‘ear’, beso ‘arm’, *bini ‘tongue’, bizar ‘beard’, bizkar ‘back’, birika (formerly biri) ‘lung’, bihotz ‘heart’, bular ‘chest’, and buru ‘head’, to which we might conceivably add behazun (and variants) ‘bile’ (almost certainly not monomorphemic) and buztan ‘tail’. Observe that only a few of these denote paired body parts, and that not all of them exhibit be- or bi-.
In contrast, among native and possibly monomorphemic body-part names which do not start with /b/, we have the words for ‘blood’, ‘body’, ‘bone’, ‘(female) breast’, ‘buttocks’, ‘finger’, ‘foot’, ‘forearm’, ‘hair’, ‘hand’, ‘heel’, ‘intestines’, ‘kidney’, ‘lip’, ‘liver’, ‘mouth’, ‘neck’, ‘nose’, ‘palm’, ‘pancreas’, ‘penis’, ‘stomach’, ‘thigh’, ‘throat’, ‘tooth’, ‘vulva’, and ‘waist’. There is no recorded native word for ‘cheek’, ‘chin’ or ‘leg’, and all other body-part names are transparently bimorphemic or borrowed.
The question, then, is whether a collection of scarcely more than a dozen body-part names with initial /b/, in the face of more than twice as many lacking initial /b/, constitutes good evidence for the putative prefix. And I believe that it does not.
The problem is that word-initial /b/ is extremely frequent in the native lexicon anyway. Only six consonants could begin lexical items in Pre-Basque – */b g z s l n/ – and, of these, /b/ and /g/ are by far the most frequent in the surviving vocabulary, even though the two phonological processes P**{7} and P**{9} have removed a significant number of word-initial /b/s that were formerly present. If we look at any section of the native lexicon, we find /b/-initial words in profusion. For example, four of the first ten numeralnames begin with /b/, and initial /b/ is inordinately frequent among the grammatical words of the language: baina(n) ‘but’, baino ‘than’, bezala ‘like, as’, bezain ‘as...as’, bai ‘yes’, ba- ‘if’, ba verbal clitic, ber- reflexive stem, bait- verbal prefix, and others. Among common native adjectives and adverbs we find baldar ‘clumsy’, baratz ‘careful’, barda ‘last night’, bare ‘calm’, behin ‘once’, beltz ‘black’, ben ‘serious’, berandu ‘late’, berdin ‘same’, berezi ‘special’, bero ‘hot’, berri ‘new’, bertze ‘other’, bete ‘full’, beti ‘always’, bigun ‘soft’, bihar ‘tomorrow’, bihurri ‘crooked’, biluzi ‘naked’, and bizi ‘alive’, among others, not to mention the reconstructed *bel ‘dark’, *bera ‘soft’, and *bil ‘round’, plus numerous derived adjectives like bakar ‘solitary’, bakoitz ‘unique’, and bizkor ‘energetic’.
Everywhere we look, the story is the same: numerous native lexical items with initial /b/. This being so, any case for the supposed body-part prefix would have to show that initial



Etymological Dictionary of Basque 57
/b/ is significantly more frequent among body-part names than it is elsewhere in the native lexicon. No such demonstration has been attempted, and I do not believe it is possible. Basque has a number of body-part names with initial /b/, not because there is a fossilized prefix in these words, but merely because initial /b/ is so frequent in the language generally. No other explanation is called for.
Finally, we might note that no one has ever proposed a “body-part prefix /b-/” for English, and yet English has at least as many body-part names with initial /b/ as has Basque – even though English permits many more word-initial consonants. Compare the following list with the Basque list above: back, belly, bile, bladder, blood, body, bollocks, bone, bosom, brain, breast, brow, and buttocks, at least.
The case for the alleged “body-part prefix *be-” looks unsustainable to me.
*eka or *ika ‘one’
Extracted from hamaika ‘eleven’ (old B amaeka), built on hamar ‘ten’ with an opaque second element. See the entry for hamaika (under hamar) for discussion of possible etymologies. An ancient word for ‘one’ cannot be sensibly extracted.
*igali ‘fruit’
Recorded only in Larramendi’s dictionary and in those who have taken it from there. Undoubtedly one of Larramendi’s creations (M. ****{1958d}).3
*iz ‘water’
Azkue (1905, ****), following a suggestion of the writer Mogel, argued for the former existence of this item on the basis of the words izerdi ‘sweat’ (possibly erdi ‘half’), izurde ‘dolphin’ (urde ‘pig’), ****{izotz ‘frost, ice’, izokin ‘salmon’}, and the place names Izpazter (bazter ‘edge’) and Izaro, both denoting places by the sea. But this putative stem was demolished by Michelena (1961a: 116 fn. 13), who showed that most of these items had other and better etymologies. For example, izurde ‘dolphin’, found only in B and G, and marginally in old L, stands alongside L gizaurde, which is transparently a compound of gizon ‘man’ (regular combining form giza-) and urde. The unusual loss of initial /g/ is paralleled by the toponym recorded early as Giçairudiaga but modern Izurdiaga. Accordingly, there is no case for the reality of the putative *iz. {See also Trask 1997: 328.}
*mameana ‘inexcusable’
An error in Larramendi’s Suplemento 337. The intended form is maemana, from R&S 307; this is a version of the verb-form *ba-eman-a (M. ****{1970a: 95}).
*na ‘anybody’
A simple blunder. A. (1905) observed the following entry in Fita’s dictionary:
alguno, na, ihor N
He mistakenly took Fita’s abbreviation of the Spanish feminine form alguna as a Basque gloss of alguno (M. ****{1970a: 146}).
3 {Michelena loc. cit. actually says this word is attested neither in Larramendi nor in Azkue, and that he (Michelena) is unable to document it.}



58 R. L. Trask
*orraiturria ‘water or spring’.
An error in Fita for intended oraiturria, representing ura-iturria, with ur ‘water’ and iturri ‘spring’, both with the article attached (M. ****{1970a: 147).
*-tzi num.
Extracted from zortzi ‘eight’ and bederatzi ‘nine’ and assigned some numerical meaning. Indefensible, since we can clearly reconstruct *bederatzu for ‘nine’, with common bederatzi resulting from contamination from zortzi, which is unanalysable.



Etymological Dictionary of Basque 59
13. The Structure of entries
The headwords are entered in the dictionary in alphabetical order. As is usual in Basque linguistic work, the letter <h> is ignored in the alphabetical ordering; so, for example, ahabia precedes aba, and ehun occurs between euli and euri. The letter <ñ> follows <n> in the alphabetical order.
Wherever possible, the headword is an attested form, but occasionally this is not possible, and the headword is a reconstructed form, marked by an asterisk. These reconstructed forms sometimes contain the reconstructed consonants *L, *N and *R; these are treated exactly like the ordinary consonants /l/, /n/ and /r/ for alphabetical purposes. So, for example, the reconstructed item *iLe is entered as though it were ile.
For an item which is not a verb, the headword is normally the bare free form of the item, with no affixes. When two or more words appear to be derived from a common but unrecorded stem, the reconstructed stem serves as the headword. For a verb, as is usual in Basque linguistic work, the headword is the perfective participle, the usual citation form of a Basque verb. For a defective verb for which no perfective participle is recorded, the reconstructed participle is used, if possible: an example is *edun ‘have’. Where no participle can be reconstructed, the bare root is entered, as with -io- ‘say’.
In most cases, a word is recorded in two or more variant forms. The variant selected as the headword in such a case is the one which matches the modern standard orthography, if the word has a modern standard written form. Otherwise, the most widespread form is chosen, if there clearly is one. If there is not, the form selected as the headword is the one which appears to be most conservative in form, if such a choice is possible. When all of this fails, the choice of headword is arbitrary. But all variant forms are entered in the Basque index near the end of the dictionary, and a reader looking for a particular form is advised to consult this index, which will refer him to the appropriate headword.4
The orthographic conventions for presenting entries are those used in Luis Michelena’s publications and in most philological work since. The conventions of the modern standard orthography are used as far as they will go to represent the pronunciations. The aspiration is written as <h> wherever it occurs. Nasalized vowels are marked with a tilde, as in <ã>. The Zuberoan front rounded vowel is written <ü>. The prominent stress accent of Zuberoan and Roncalese is marked with an acute accent whenever its position is known with certainty, as in bürhézur ‘skull’; the absence of such an accent in a Z or R form means that the position of the accent is not certainly known. The voiced sibilants corresponding to voiceless /z/ and /s/ are not overtly marked, since the voicing here appears never to be of any historical interest. The exceedingly rare voiced affricates corresponding to /tz/ and /ts/, however, are written <dz> and <ds>. The glide [j] is written <y> whenever it occurs in a form in a variety in which the historical /j/ has developed to some other sound.
The intervocalic tap /r/ is consistently written in the earliest Zuberoan texts, but has disappeared from Zuberoan speech within the last couple of centuries. Relevant Z forms are therefore given with the <r> presented in parentheses, as in bü(r)ü ‘head’, showing that the earlier Z form was bürü, while the modern one is büü. Since the tap was also lost before /h/, I likewise write é(r)ho ‘kill’, representing earlier érho but modern ého. In contrast, a Z spelling like ǘrhe ‘gold’ shows the presence of a trill which has never been lost.

Forms from older texts using obsolete orthographies are automatically converted into the orthography used here whenever this can be done with complete confidence, as in most cases it can. But a form which is a hapax or close to it, and whose orthography is ambiguous or doubtful, is left in its original spelling, with annotations as appropriate.
Bound morphemes are entered normally, with hyphens as appropriate. Where necessary, a free form precedes a bound morpheme of identical form, and a prefix precedes a suffix.
When two or more identical headwords of differing origin are entered, these are given numbers in square brackets. Where possible, a more widespread item precedes less widespread one. So, for example, the widespread ardi [1] ‘sheep’ precedes the localized ardi [2] ‘flea’. When this criterion is useless, the order is arbitrary. So, for example, -ki [1] AdvFS precedes -ki [2] dative flag, which precedes -ki [3] NFS.
Each variant form is followed by an indication of the dialects within which that form is recorded. As explained in section **{1}, the dialects recognized here are the ten conventional ones recognized by Luis Michelena in his writings and by most others since, including the long-extinct Southern and the recently extinct Roncalese. Note that the mention of a given dialect means only that the form is recorded somewhere within that dialect area, and not necessarily in every local variety of that dialect. The notation “Old” before a dialect label means that the form is recorded in early texts from that dialect but has not been in use for a long time. The notation “(c.)” (“common”) means that the form appears to be recorded throughout the language, while a notation of the type “(c. exc. B)” means that the form is recorded everywhere except in the named dialect(s). The notation “(?)” in this position means that the form is recorded only in one or more sources which fail to provide a provenance; this most typically happens with a hapax which is found only in an old dictionary. A hapax is marked “[hapax]”.
A part-of-speech label usually follows the dialect information, but this label precedes when the meaning of the item is quite different in the several dialects. The abbreviations for the parts of speech are listed in section 14; these are mostly obvious. But note that adjvl. is used for a peculiarity of Basque: a class of syntactically complex adjective-like modifiers which precede their head nouns (ordinary lexical adjectives follow their nouns). Determiners are labelled according to whether they are preposed or postposed to their heads within noun phrases. Postpositions are labelled for the case they govern. When a word exists as more than one part of speech, the noun use is usually given first, unless there is some good reason to prefer another order.
Verbs require special attention. A verb is labelled ‘intransitive’ or ‘transitive’, as appropriate. A verb which is syntactically intransitive but which requires transitive morphology is marked “vitm.” Obligatory or optional dative arguments are marked with a “d”. Thus, vi. marks a simple intransitive verb; vt. a simple transitive one; vid. an intransitive verb with an obligatory dative argument; vt(d). a transitive verb with an optional dative argument; and vitm(d). an intransitive verb which takes transitive morphology and an optional dative argument. A copular verb, always with intransitive morphology, is marked vcop.
A complement-taking verb is marked vic. if it takes intransitive morphology, and vtc. if it takes transitive morphology. The nature of the complement required is given in following square brackets: thus, “[+ Ger]” means that the verb takes a gerund VP, while “[+ -la]” means that it takes a complement clause with the complementizer -la, and so on.
Under each part of speech, the recorded meanings are listed. Sometimes it is clear that some meanings are central and original, while others result from semantic transfer; in such cases, the later meanings are marked “TS”, for “transferred sense(s)”. If a transferred sense belongs



Etymological Dictionary of Basque 61
to a different part of speech, this is noted. Names of animals or plants are marked “(zool.)” or “(bot.)”, and Latin names are provided wherever possible.
Many words show distinctive forms when they occur as first elements in word-formation (either compounding or suffixation). For each such word, the special form is listed as its “CF” (“combining form”). Note that these combining forms are typical of medieval formations, but that they often fail to be used in more recent formations, where the free form of the word is used instead.
For a verb, the main part of the entry is followed by the stem of that verb (the form which is obtained in most cases by removing the suffix of the perfective participle, and which functions as its combining form in word-formation). For a verb containing the ancient prefix *e-, the root is also given; this is obtained by the further removal of the prefix, and it represents the verbal morpheme in its bare form. The root is also the form which appears in the synthetic (non-periphrastic finite) forms of that verb, if it has any. A verb for which any synthetic forms are recorded at all is labelled “Synth.”. See section **{5} for an account of the peculiarities of certain classes of verbs.
When a date of first attestation is available, this is usually given at the end of the head entry. However, when different dates are available for the several variant forms or senses of an entry, these dates immediately follow the relevant forms or senses. When no date appears, this usually means that the word is first recorded only in the 20th century, most usually in Azkue’s 1905 dictionary. When a word is first recorded in Larramendi’s 1745 dictionary, which contains many unidentified neologisms, or in that book’s 1746 supplement, the date of the second attestation is also given. When a word is first recorded in the medieval period, the medieval date is followed by the date of first attestation in the later connected texts.
If a word has any diminutive (“expressive”) forms, as described in section **{this section is absent from Trask’s typescript, but see M9 in section 8, and m- in The Dictionary}, these are listed at the end of the head entry, together with any necessary comments.
The head entry is followed by the information on the etymology of the item. Given first in most cases, where relevant, is an explanation of forms in terms of the phonological changes listed in section **{6}; an annotation like “by P7” means that rule 7 in section **{6} has applied. A few of the most frequent changes are so obvious that they are not expressly mentioned in the entries; these are noted in section **{1d}. In the case of a loan word, the developments listed in section **{10} are expressly noted, and an annotation like “by L4” means that process 4 listed in section **{10} has applied. For a verb containing the prefix *e-, the structure of the verb is displayed in the form Prefix-Root-Suffix: for example, ikusi ‘see’ is shown as *e-kus-i. At some convenient point, the combining form is explained, if necessary; so, for example, “CF by W6” means that process 6 in section **{7} explains the combining form. The frequent notation “OUO” (“of unknown origin”) means that the origin of a form is entirely unknown; such an item is usually a strong candidate for native and ancient status in the language.
In the cases in which we can tell, nouns borrowed from Latin were usually borrowed in the accusative singular, and adjectives were usually borrowed in the accusative singular masculine. Accordingly, the policy here is to cite every Latin etymon in this form unless the Latin source is plainly some other form. A handful of nouns were taken from a Latin nominative, vocative or genitive case-form; a few nouns were taken from Latin plurals; and one or two adjectives were taken from a feminine form. These forms are cited and identified where necessary.

Under each main entry are entered, indented, the compounds and derivatives of that item, in alphabetical order. The structure of each such sub-entry follows that of a main entry, in most respects. The additional material present in each such formation is given with a preceding plus sign: thus, for example, “+ berri ‘new’” means that we are looking at a compound whose second element is the cited word, while one of the form “+ -tsu AFS” means that we are looking at a derivative containing the adjective-forming suffix -tsu. If the additional item cited is not listed in its alphabetical place in the dictionary, a cross-reference is supplied: so, for example, “+ -tasun abstract NFS (see -tar)” means that the suffix -tasun is listed in the dictionary under the headword -tar, of which it is a derivative.
As a rule, each compound or derivative is listed under its first element. But there are two exceptions. First, words containing prefixes are listed under their second elements; for example, berrogei ‘forty’, which contains the prefix berr- ‘twice’, is entered under hogei ‘twenty’. Second, Basque has a few nouns which occur frequently as first elements in compounds with specialized senses, and formations containing these are also listed under their second elements. For example, otso ‘wolf’ often means ‘wild’ as a first element, and so otsokume ‘wolf cub’ is listed under otso, but otsolizar ‘mountain ash’ is entered under leizar ‘ash tree’.5 The elements treated in this way are baso ‘woods’ (but ‘wild’), otso ‘wolf’ (but ‘wild’), larre ‘pasture’ (but ‘wild’)6, and sasi ‘blackberry bush’ (but ‘pseudo-’). ***
There are some etymologists whose work is cited so frequently that I have abbreviated their names. These are as follows: “M.” is Luis Michelena; “A.” is R. M. de Azkue; “Lh.” is Pierre Lhande (1926); “C.” is Juan Corominas; “CP” is Corominas and Pascual (1980); “ML” is Meyer-Lübke (1935); and “AT” is Agud and Tovar (1988–95), {Sch. is Hugo Schuchardt}. Names of other scholars are given in full.
Expressive formations call for special comment. Those which are derived from ordinary lexical items are simply listed normally under their source words. But most such words have been coined out of thin air. Many of these are constructed according to identifiable patterns, and these items are grouped together in the dictionary under suitable headings. The headwords for these groups are m-, m-reduplications, panp-, pot-, and t/k reduplications. *** The remaining expressive formations, those which fall into no pattern, are entered normally as headwords.

Etymological Dictionary of Basque 69
The Dictionary
As is usual in Basque linguistic work, the letter h is ignored in the alphabetical order.
-a [1] (c.) Allative CS: ‘to’ (motion)
This CS exists everywhere alongside the more widely used -ra. It is found in three circumstances. First, it occurs with place names: Zarautz town name, Zarautza ‘to Zarautz’. Second, it occurs with the demonstrative stems: hona, huna ‘hither’, horra ‘thither’, hara ‘thither’, from the three oblique demonstrative stems hon-, horr-, har- (see hau, hori {[1]}, *har). Third, it occurs after the element -gan, both in the western animate allatives like gizona(ren)gana ‘to the man’ and in the northern postposition gana ‘next to’, as in L LN gizonaren gana ‘next to the man’ (speaking of movement to this position). In L LN, it can optionally take a following -t, just like -ra: hunat ‘hither’, gizonaren ganat ‘next to the man’. After a vowel, we find only -ra, but we usually cannot tell whether this represents -ra or whether it represents -a with the usual phonological -r- inserted: Bilbo ‘Bilbao’, Bilbora ‘to Bilbao’; L LN gizonaren baithara ‘to the man’ (see baitha-). In the north, by M8, there are no place names ending in a consonant, and so we find only allative -ra with toponyms here. The use of -a in place names suggests that it may be older than -ra.
-a [2] (L LN) Yes-no question particle.
This particle is suffixed to a synthetic finite verb-form, where it induces certain vowel changes. Examples: Manex dator ‘Manex is coming’, Manex datorra? ‘Is Manex coming?’; Ingelesa da ‘S/he’s English’, Ingelesa dea? ‘Is s/he English?’; Ibanek ikusi du ‘Iban has seen it’, Ibanek ikusi duia? ‘Has Iban seen it?’ This particle is normally accompanied by falling intonation. OUO, and not recorded in any other variety.
-a [3] (L LN) Suffix in finite verb-forms.
This suffix is found in L and LN in certain synthetic finite verb-forms, immediately following the verbal root but preceding any agreement suffixes or tense suffixes. Examples: nabila ‘I’m going’, dabila ‘s/he’s going’, zabilan ‘s/he was going’, for common nabil, dabil, zebilen, from ibili ‘be in motion’; dakarrat ‘I’m bringing it’, dakarra ‘s/he’s bringing it’, zakarran ‘s/he was bringing it’, for common dakart, dakar, zekarren, from ekarri ‘bring’. Other verbs exhibiting this suffix include erasi ‘chatter’ and ikusi ‘see’, at least. But not all verbs exhibit it: for example, etorri ‘come’ forms nator ‘I’m coming’ and dator ‘s/he’s coming’, as in other varieties, and not *natorra or *datorra. This suffix is not recorded outside L and LN. Its origin is unknown, though it may conceivably result from analogy with finite forms like darama ‘s/he is taking it away’ and dauka ‘s/he holds it’, in which the final -a is part of the verbal root.
ahabia (Z) (19th cent.), ãhã́be (Z), ahabi (?), abi (B G HN R) (1746), afi (B), arabi (B) (1802), gabi (B), kabi (AT), aabale (Múg.) n. ‘bilberry, whortleberry’ (bot.) (Vaccinium myrtillus).
From *anabi(a), OUO, by P1 (M ****{1950d: 467f.; 1953e: 572; 1961a: 300 and fn. 4}). The *arobi occurring in Mogel’s Peru Abarka is a typo for arabi. The original



70 R. L. Trask
form is retained as anabia in Riojan Spanish. What appears to be the same word is widely recorded in nearby Rom. varieties, esp. in the Pyrenees; see AT (s.v. ãhãbe) for a list. No one knows whether the word is Bq. or Rom. in origin.
ahaide (L LN), aide (B G HN) n. ‘relative’. 1545.
OUO, but surely contains -ide ‘fellow’ (see kide) (M. 1961a: 245). Vinson
(****{?1908} R{evue de} L{inguistique et de} Ph{ilologie} C{omparée} 41: 92 ff.)
proposes that the first element is anaia ‘brother’, by P1; this is rejected by Bähr (1935), but taken seriously by M. (1961a: 306 fn. 12), who notes the parallelism with Old Cast. cormano ‘relative’ from *co-hermano ‘co-brother’. Possibly contains the hypothetical *ana- {[1]}. Bähr (ibid.) proposes aho ‘mouth’ as the first element, and hence ‘mouthcompanion’, but no one has taken this seriously, for lack of parallels.
ahaidego(a) (L LN), ahaikoa (old L) (1643), ahakoa (old LN) (1571), ahaiko (L) (1855), aiko (**) (1783) n. ‘relationship, kinship’, ‘relative’. + -goa collective NFS. Common variants from *ahaide-goa > *ahaid-goa (by W**{1}) > *ahait-goa (by W**{3}) > *ahait-koa > ahaikoa (by {W}**{4}) (M. 1977a: 487). Loss of final /a/ by M4. Leizarraga’s ahakoa is probably a hapax and may be an error.
aide nagusi (old B G) n. ‘clan chief’. Ca. 1600. + nagusi ‘principal’.
ahakar (L), akar (HN S), ãkar (R), aaka (Múg.) n. ‘quarrel, dispute’. 1643.
The R form leads M. (**** BAP 6: {1950b:}499) to propose *anakar, OUO, by P1. But AT (s.v.) prefer a derivative of aho ‘mouth’, and see the R nasalization as secondary; they cite in support an adverbial ahakan ‘arguing’ from S.P. See aharra.
ahakartu (old L), ahakatu (S.P.) v. [diathesis unrecorded] ‘dispute, argue’. + -tu VFS.
ahal (L LN Z), aal (B), al (B G HN R S) n. ‘power, ability’. 1571.
OUO, but probably from *anal, by P1, if the proposed derivative below is correct. (M. ****{1961a: 214, 411 fn. 7}). M. (**** BAP 6 {1950b}: 452) presents a summary of the regional distribution of variants.
ahal bezanbat (old L) det. ‘as much as possible’. + bezainbat (see ****{*bez(a)-}).
ahalez (old L) adv. ‘as far as possible’.+ -z instrl./advbl.
ahalke (L LN) (1571), ãhã́lke (Z), aalke (HN), ãlke (R), álke (R), alke (HN LN S), ahalge (L LN) (1657) n. ‘shame’, ‘shyness, timidity, modesty’. + -ge ‘without’ (see gabe) (M. **** BAP 6 {1950b}: 457, 1961a: 354). This etymology is not certain, but it is widely accepted, and it provides the evidence for *anal above.
ahalge-gabe (old LN), ahalkegabe (**) a. ‘insolent’. 1630. + gabe ‘without’. An interesting example of a second occurrence of the same final item. [FHV 412 fn.]
ahalkeizun (old L old LN), ahalgeizun (old LN) n. ‘infamy’. 1545. + -kizun NFS.
al (G) Yes-no question particle. 1761?, late 19th cent. By some unidentifiable process of grammaticalization.
alba- (old L old LN) ‘if perhaps’, ‘if possibly’. 1545. Expresses a remoter condition than ba- alone. + ba- ‘if’ (M. 1961{a}: 214).



Etymological Dictionary of Basque 71
albait- (old LN), albeit- (old LN) Verbal prefix expressing a kind of imperative which is subordinate to a condition, called the “prescriptive” by Lafon (1944{3}). 1545. + -bait (M. 1961{a}: 214). [FHV 214, 214 fn., 411 fn.]
albait (B G HN) ****{adv. ‘as .. as possible’ Aul.}
ahantzi (L LN) (1571), ahanzi (old LN), aantzi (HN), antzi (HN), ahatzi (LN Z), ahatze (LN), ãhã́tze (Z), ahanze (old LN), ãtze (R), átze (R), antzitu (B), anztu (old B, R&S 156), aaztu (B G HN), aztu (B G HN Sout) (1562), atzendu (Múg.) vid. ‘forget’.
From *anatzi (OUO), or possibly *anantzi, or just possibly *ena(n)tzi, by P1 (Uhlenbeck ****{1947}; M. ****{1950b: 449; 1961a: 303}). Forms in -tu by transfer of the verb from the -i class to the -tu class (M14); the variant antzitu interestingly carries both participial suffixes. The mysterious last form not recorded outside Múg. This is a rare dative-subject verb: that which is forgotten is absolutive, while he who forgets is dative. In practice, however, its diathesis varies greatly, depending on both region and construction. Often, he who forgets is absolutive, while that which is forgotten is instrumental or comitative. Esp. in northern varieties, and esp. in imperatives, it may function as a simple transitive: he who forgets is ergative, while that which is forgotten is absolutive.
ahantz-arazi (old L **) ** ‘make (someone) forget’. + -erazi causative.
ahanzkor (** old LN), ãhãzkór (Z) a. ‘forgetful’. **** + -kor ‘tending to’.
ahatzehi(n) (Z) a. ‘easy to forget’. + ehi [1] ‘easy’.
ahazgaitz (Z) a. ‘hard to forget’. + gaitz ‘difficult’.
*erahatzi (old LN) vt. ‘make (someone) forget’. Synth. **** Not recorded as such, but required to provide the finite form derahatza ‘he makes him forget’, recorded once in Oihenart.
[MORE IN Lh.]
ahardi (L LN Z), ãhãrdi (Z), aardi (B HN), ardi (G HN) n. ‘sow’ (female pig), TS ‘wooden screw in a wine-press’. 1571.
OUO. Often postposed to urde ‘pig’ as an adjective. The G variant ardi has sometimes been confused with ardi [1] ‘sheep’, but M. (1961a: 110 fn. 2) reports a difference in word-accent. A personal name Belasco Ahardia in Villabáscones around 950.

aharra (L LN Z) n. ‘quarrel, dispute’. 1657.
OUO. M. (****{1950b: 457}) believes that this is the same word as ahakar id., but, if so, the relation in form is wholly obscure. Lh. sees this as a derivative of aho ‘mouth’ with an opaque second element. Attempts at deriving it from Occ. words like Bearn. ahaa {i.e. ahà = Occ. afar} are unconvincing, since these words have unhelpful meanings like ‘affair’ and ‘process’ (AT s.v. ahakar).
arrats (HN) n. ‘quarrel’. + hats ‘anger’ (AT s.v. aharra). [CHECK: not in Lh.]
aasa (B) n. ‘a two-handled plane used by coopers’.
Corominas, cited in AT (s.v.), sees this as an Arabism, from an Arabic ‛asa ‘axe handle’ (and other senses).
ahate (L LN), ãhã́te (Z), agate (B), arate (B), arata (B), areta (B), aate (B G HN S), ate (B G HN), ata (B G), ataa (G) n. ‘duck’ (zool.) (Anatidae), (B) also ‘goose’. 1657.

From Lat. favum id., plus an unidentified second element (M. ****{1955c: 290}).
abaiko (B) n. ‘honeycomb’. + -ko NFS.
abaraska (G) (1745, 1842), aberaska (1905) n. ‘honeycomb’. Second element obscure; possibly oraska ‘mixture’{(not in The Dictionary)}. Second form possibly contaminated by abere ‘animal’.

abauts (B), abarauts (B) n. ‘honeycomb stripped of honey’. + huts ‘empty’.
ababor (?) n. ‘port side (of a ship)’. 1677.
From Cast. a babor ‘to port’.
abade (c.) n. ‘abbot’, (B G) ‘priest’. 1562. [Ax] **** CF abat-.
From Old Cast. *abade ‘abbot’. [AT] It is clear that an earlier borrowing *apate must once have existed, taken directly from med. Lat. abbātem, by L**{1}, since this is recorded in toponyms like Apatamonasterio (Bizkaia) and Aphat-Ospital (Nafarroa Beherea). The historical abade is therefore a re-borrowing.
abatei (B), abateri (B) n. ‘tolling of the bell to summon a clergyman to a burial’. 1905. + dei ‘call’ (see deitu) (M. 1961a: 345). The development is *abade-dei > *abad-dei (by W**{1}) > abatei (by W**{4}). The second form is peculiar.
abatetxe (B) n. ‘parish priest’s house, presbytery’. 1897. + etxe ‘house’.

abadiñau (B) n. ‘kind of chestnut’.
OUO.
abadote (HN L), abadota (HN L) n. ‘wasp’ (zool.) (****) 17th cent. [AT]
OUO. Sch. (**** ZRPh 36 {1912}: 34) proposes habe [2] ‘horsefly’ + tuta ‘trumpet’, noting that Bearn. tute ‘trumpet’ has a derivative tutane ‘hornet’. Doubtful.
abagadaune (B), abagadune (B), abagune (B G), abadune (B), abagadaldi (B) n. ‘propitious occasion’ (1800), ‘interval’ (1898).
The second elements are clearly une ‘interval’ {(see gune)} and aldi ‘occasion’. The first element, apparently *abagada-, is unidentifiable, but it hardly looks like native Bq., and it must be borrowed from some unknown Rom. source (M. ****{1964a: 99}). {Possibly Occ. vegada, glossed ‘circonstance, conjoncture, occasion’ in Palay (1980); and/or Old Cast. vegada ‘time, occasion’.} The western variant abogadu of abokatu ‘lawyer, advocate’ is phonologically acceptable but semantically mysterious.

abar n. (c.) ‘branch’ (of a tree), ‘branches’ (collectively), (HN) ‘bare branch without leaves’, TS ‘branch’ (of anything), (B HN R) ‘sticks of firewood’, (B G) ‘residue, remains’. 1746, 1905.
OUO. There are many questions about this word. It is scarcely recorded before the 20th cent., and yet it is found almost everywhere, and it gives rise to many certain or possible derivatives. It is not clear whether the ‘residue’ sense represents the same word, but most commentators think it does, and a transfer from something like ‘lopped-off branches’ to ‘residue’ does not seem implausible.
A further difficulty is the absence or rarity of the expected CF *aba-, by W11. And the partial synonymy with adar ‘horn’, ‘branch’ also clouds matters.
Uhlenbeck (****{1891: 200}) proposes an original *kabar on the basis of xixkabar ‘twigs for burning’, but this is dismissed with good reason by AT (s.v. abar). More



74 R. L. Trask
interesting is the suggestion that the word is derived from habe ‘tree’ with the hypothetical collective suffix *-ar (Uhlenbeck ****{1909: 7}; Trombetti ****{1925: 127}; López Mendizábal ****; M. ****{1967f: 608}).
AT (s.v.) note the apparent presence of the same word in Rom.: Santander abarra ‘long slender branch’, Navarrese and Santander abarra ‘kind of oak’, ‘woody shrub’, Gascon (Gers) auàrro ‘small bits of firewood’.
abarka (B Sout G HN LN R) n. ‘rustic sandal’, in historical times of rawhide with soles of rope. 11th cent., 1562. Probably + -ka [**] NFS {(not in The Dictionary)}. This etymology, first proposed by Astarloa (****{1803: 292}), has been endorsed by most commentators, and AT (s.v.) consider it to be substantially supported by evidence. Indeed, Astarloa defines the word as “especie de calzado que se componía de ramitas de árbol” [“a kind of sandal made from small branches”], which may reflect the practice of his day. Van Eys’s proposal that the second element is -gai ‘material’ (see gai) is properly dismissed by AT. The word occurs first in the name of the 11th-cent. king of Navarra Sancho Abarca, the epithet presumably reflecting his humble origins; this epithet is repeated in the title of Mogel’s 1802 novel Peru Abarka, whose title character is a rustic but shrewd countryman presented as “Professor of Basque language at the University of the Countryside”. The semantic basis is presumably the long-standing European practice of making sandals from bast, the fibrous inner layer of tree-bark (phloem), a practice which is documented by AT. AT report that the same word is widespread and fairly ancient in the Iberian Peninsula, and recorded also north of the Pyrenees: Hispano-Arabic pargha ~ bargha ‘sandals’, sg. parghat (mod. Arabic and Berber bálgha ‘slipper, shoe’), Mozarabic probable *parca, Portuguese alparca ‘sandal’, an apparent Old Cast. alparga ‘sandal’, Arag. and SE Spain albarca id., Valencia abarca {avarca}, Bearn. abarque id. Cast. alpargata id. derives from the same ult. source via Arabic. This is thus apparently a rare case of a Bq. word borrowed widely. The Bq. word is absent north of the Pyrenees, where espartin is used.

abenitu (**{old L}) [Ax]
abenikoa (**{old L}) n. ‘agreement’. **** [Ax] [FHV 345 fn.] From *abenitu-goa (M. **** BAP 17 {1961b}: 359).
abere (c.), abre (old L S) n. ‘large animal’, ‘domesticated animal’, (G) ‘equine’, (HN) ‘bovine’. CF abel-. 1562.
From some Rom. development of Lat. habēre ‘have’. The semantic development is Rom., not Bq.: the word is widely attested in Ibero-Romance with meanings like ‘domesticated animal’, ‘cattle’, ‘bovine animal’ (CP s.vv. haber, ganar). CF by W12.
abelburu (?) (1905), abelbürü (Z), abereburu (1858) n. ‘head of cattle’. + buru ‘head’.
abeletxe (B G HN) (1746), aberetxe (B G L) (1897) n. ‘sheepfold’. + etxe ‘house’.

aberats (c. exc. S), abrats (S) ‘rich’. 1571. Final element obscure, but the development of ‘wealth’ from ‘cattle’ is a familiar one among pastoral peoples: cf. Lat. pecūnia ‘property, wealth, riches’, from pecus ‘cattle’, ‘domesticated animals’. A toponym Haberasturi in Alava 1025.
aberastasun (**) n. ‘wealth, riches’. ****. + -tasun NFS (see -tar).
aberatsi (old LN) vi. ‘get rich’ (1657), aberastu (c.) vi. ‘get rich’, vt. ‘enrich’ (1562). First form + -i [1] VFS, second form + -tu VFS. The verb has been transferred from the -i class to the -tu class (M**{14}).

Larramendi’s Supplement 587 cites abarescu, but M. (****{1970a: 122}) interprets this as a typo for the form entered here, and proposes Cast. a berrisco ‘all together, without distinction’.
habia (Z), abia (B) (1596), abi (B), kabi (G HN), afia (Sout) (1562), kabia (** G), kafia (HN L LN), aapi (G) n. ‘nest’.
From *kabia, from Lat. caveam ‘enclosure, cage’ (M. 1961a: 51, 219). Variants by P14, P8, M4. The last form is curious. M. (1961a: 251) suggests that initial /k/ was restored under Rom. influence.

Inferred by M. (****{1970a: 139}) as the intended reading of the erroneous *abireta, *airubeta in Araquil and A. (1905). From Cast. agujeta id. or a related Rom. form.

habuiñ (L), habuina (S.P.), hagun(a) (LN), águn (R) n. ‘spittle, dribble, slobber’. (**) **** [FHV 150, 150 fn.]
From Occ. bavün {i.e. bavum} id. (Sch. ****{1906a: 30} Arb). M. (****{1961a: 150}) proposes an intermediate form *babune, with P1.
aburdiko (1803), aurdiko (1745), ardiko (1580) (B) n. ‘(large) pillow’.
This appears to contain bururdi ‘pillow’, ‘duvet’ (see buru) and -ko. M. (**** BAP 20 {1964e}: 26) proposes that the first element is oa-, the CF of ohe ‘bed’: hence *o(h)abururdi-ko.
adalko (R), alko (R), anko (R), oko (HN A S) n. ‘****{‘bunch, cluster (of fruit)’ Az.} [FHV 340] [MOVE?] {See golko [2].}

OUO. CF by W**{11}. It is not clear that the last sense represents the same word; see abar ‘branch’. Many people have proposed a link with Old Irish adarc id. (modern adharc), which has no IE etymology. Most Vasconists have seen the Bq. word as a loan from Celtic, even though the word is not recorded in Celtic outside Irish. But Buck (1949) sees the Irish word as borrowed from Bq., a position which requires some fancy footwork to account for the final /k/ in Irish.
adabegi (B G) (1905), adarbegi (1912) n. ‘knot (in a tree)’. + begi ‘eye’.

The conservative form is *au[h]ari or *au[h]ali (M. 1961a: 221). Variants by P72, P8, P35, P69. CF by W1 and possibly W12. The word surely contains the meal suffix -ari
[2]. The first element may well be gau ‘night’, with loss of // by P**{14} (M. 1961a: 246 fn. 38). M. (1957c) rejects Schuchardt’s proposal of a Lat. *apparium. The variant abari, today only S, occurs in the Fuero General of Navarra, and in a Navarrese text from the early 15th cent.: & jaunatiçula abarion (= eta Jaunak dizula abari on ‘May God give you a good dinner’) (M. 1977a: 526). {Cf. apario}
afaldu (**) ****{vt. ‘have dinner or supper’ Aul.}
bariaku (B), barieku (B), bariku (B) n. ‘Friday’. 1653. M. (1977a: 504) proposes *abari-ba(ga)ko-egun ‘day without dinner’, + baga ‘without’ (see gabe) + -ko + egun ‘day’.
-aga (c.) Toponymic suffix.
OUO. This suffix is extremely common in toponyms and in surnames, where it appears to mean ‘place (of)’, but it is not recorded in any ordinary lexical items, and there is no reason to suppose that it ever occurred there. Sometimes the preceding elements are transparent: Iturriaga (iturri ‘spring’), Mendiaga (mendi ‘mountain’), Arrigorriaga (harri gorri ‘red stone’). Sometimes they are opaque: Nabutxaga, Altzaga. The suggestion that the suffix means ‘abundance (of)’ cannot be supported by any evidence, and the proposed link with the absolutive plural suffix -ak (see *har) is fanciful. This

aintzigar (B G) (****), antziar (?) (1897), antzigar (B G) (1905), antsigar (B G) (****), intziar (G) (1745, 1855), antzier (Múg.) (1958), intzigar (Múg.) (1958) n. ‘frost’, spec. ‘faint, almost imperceptible coating of frost on leaves’, also (B) ‘crust of ice’.
Obscure and much discussed. The first element might be intz ‘dew’ (see ihintz) (M. ****{1955c: 289}), and the second might be igar ‘dry’ (see eihar). In fact, intz igar is perfect B G for ‘dry dew’, which fits the sense admirably, but the variant intzigar is rare and recorded only very late; it might be a folk-etymology. Possibly related to the aintzi cluster. The word has no early attestations; see izotz.
aintzin (L LN), ainzin (LN), aitzin (HN L LN Z), aitzine (Z), antzin (R), altzin (LN S) n. ‘front’, ‘space in front’ (1545), TS adv. ‘forward’ (ca. 1660). [MUCH MORE: FHV 339]
Probably from Rom. M. (****{1954b: 145}) cites an Old Cast. anzes, not found in CP, and an Old Fr. ains. {Old Cast. anzes glossing Lat. prius occurs in Glosas emilianenses and Glosas silenses; Old Occ. ans and anceis ‘before’.

aita (c.), aite (old B), aitxa (B), atta (G) [hapax] n. ‘father’. 15th cent.
Of nursery origin. It is conceivable that Aq. ATTA-, as in the male personal name ATTACONIS Gen., represents this item, perhaps with subsequent expressive palatalization, by M9, to *atta, and then depalatalization, by P32, to aita (Holmer (1950) ****{: 404}) [FHV 218 fn.].

aitonen seme (B G L), aitoren seme (L LN Z) n. ‘hidalgo’, ‘gentleman’. Lit., ‘son of good fathers’, + on ‘good’ + -en {[1]} Gen + seme ‘son’. Second form by dissimilation. The second form looks as if it might be *Aitoren seme ‘son of Aitor’, where Aitor is a name, and so the 19th-cent. Romantic writer Augustin Chaho extracted this previously non-existent name and created the myth of Aitor, the shepherd who was supposedly the father of the Basques. As a result, Aitor is now a common male given name. Note: the *aitorren seme of A. (1905) is an error. [FHV 149]: MORE] {M. 1968a: 14}

OUO. B form by P30. By far the most widespread sense for this word is ‘crag’, and this is also the sense it has in the numerous toponyms and surnames containing it. In contrast, the sense of ‘stone’ is only sparsely recorded in LN, but this sense is also prominent in the compounds containing the word. The possibility that *(h)aitz- {v. infra} is the same item suggests a reconstruction *anetz, by P1, but this is far from certain.

*(h)aitz- Hypothetical stem possibly underlying certain tool-names.
OUO. Very many have wanted to see this as haitz ‘stone’, and hence as representing a time when the Basques had a Neolithic culture and made their tools from stone. This is possible, but far from certain. First, why should a tool-name be based on the name of the material it is made from? Second, are stone shears and stone pincers really plausible? Some of the forms suggest a possible reconstruction *anetz, by P1. Note that haizkora ‘axe’ does not appear to belong to this group.

aker (B G HN), akher (L LN), ákher (Z) n. ‘billygoat, male goat’. 1074, 1571.
OUO. Aq. AHER BELSTE is the name of a god, and many have seen the first element as representing aker, but M. (****{1954a: 415}) rejects this on phonological grounds: how could Bq. /k/ show up in Aq. as /h/? But Gorrochategui (****{?1984}) is nevertheless sympathetic to this reading, and M. (1961a: 256) also takes a more sympathetic view.
akelarre (B G HN), akhelarre (L) n. ‘gathering of witches’. 1686. + larre ‘pasture, meadow’. A much discussed word. Akelarre is also the name of a plain in Navarra, between Urdax and Zugarramurdi, and A. (1905) suggests that the plain was popularly regarded as a gathering place for witches, and that its name became transferred to the gathering. Popular imagination has seen the akelarre as a black Sabbath of the familiar kind; many apologists have seen it as a remnant of the ancient Basque pagan religion; clerical writers (like Azkue) have tried to play down the whole thing as a trivial modern fantasy born of superstition. Nobody really knows what the akelarre involved, or even if anything ever happened at all – though the Basque belief in witches is well documented, in spite of the outraged efforts of the Church at stamping it out.

ala [2] (c.) prt. Introductory particle used in oaths, as in Ala jainkoa! ‘By God!’. 1545.
Probably from old Cast. a la, which had the same use, as in A la he! ‘By the faith!’ (M. ****BAP 11 {1955c}: 291), or from a related Rom. form. But M. (1977a: 525) takes seriously the idea that this item may be merely hala ‘thus’ (see *har-). See alafede.

alaba (c. exc. Z), alhaba (L LN), alhába (Z), alába (R) n. ‘daughter’. 1545.

alabatxo (LN) n. ‘small daughter’. 1571. + -txo dimin. (see -to {[1]}).
alafede (**) intj. ‘By faith!’ ****
This could be constructed from ala [2] + fede ‘faith’. Equally, it might be borrowed intact from Rom.: cf. Cast. a la he! (M. **** BAP 11 {1955c}: 291).
alaga (**) n. ‘bread wheat’. ****
From Cast. ****{álaga} [Arb] {M. 1950a: 194.}
alai a. (old G HN) ‘vigorous, spirited, passionate’ (1745), (G HN L) ‘merry, happy, gay’ (1808).
Possibly from some Rom. source akin to Lat. alacris {alacer, acc. alacrem} ‘brisk, eager, happy’ and its adverbial derivative alacer. CP suggests that a Rom. reflex akin to old Fr. aleigre was borrowed as alaikiro (attested; see below), and that the adjective alai was then back-formed from this by removal of the adverbial suffix, though AT regard this as suspect. M. (**** BAP 10 {1954e}: 375) proposes instead a direct borrowing from Cast. alhaja ‘treasure, gem’, as *alaia, with loss of the final vowel by M4. The first is better semantically, the second phonologically.
alaiki (1852), alaikiro (1870) (G HN) adv. ‘happily, merrily’. + -ki [1] AdvFS (+ -ro AdvFS {not in The Dictionary}).

OUO. Following a suggestion of Schuchardt’s, ML (§ 4002) identifies this word with Occ. aufo, aufié ‘idleness’, ‘idler’, derived from Arabic halfa ‘esparto grass’. But CP (s.v. alfalfa) attack this proposal savagely, arguing that the evidence is overwhelmingly against it. They go on to consider another eight possibilities, all of which they regard as unconvincing. Perhaps the most interesting of these is proposal (e). This depends upon the western variant arpel, upon the widespread sense of ‘barren’ attached to the word, and upon the claim, presented here as fact, that the word in this sense is most typically applied to ewes. They therefore propose that *arpel is the conservative form, with common alper etc. resulting from metathesis, and that ‘barren’ is the conservative sense. In fact, they propose *ardi-berri, with berri ‘new’, but this is scarcely likely. Much better is *ardi-bel, with *bel ‘dark’, which would yield arpel regularly: *ardi-bel > *ard-bel (by W2.1) > *art-bel (by W3) > *artpel (by W4) > arpel. In this interpretation, the common application of the word to idle people would be a metaphor comparable to English ‘black sheep’ and Cast. oveja negra.

Trask’s althatü (Z) here duplicates the item already mentioned under aldatu (see *al-), to which should be added the R form ãltatu (or altatu, if the nasality properly belongs only to ãlkatu).

In its anatomical sense, the status of the word varies: it is regarded as very coarse by some but as perfectly respectable by others. As a term of abuse, it may be freely used by anyone, even by a young woman.

*ana- [1], *aNa- Hypothetical stem in kinship terms.
There are several kinship terms which certainly or probably contain an initial sequence of the form *ana- or *aNa-. Among these are ahizpa ‘sister of a woman’ {q.v.} (from *anizpa), anaia ‘brother of a man’ {q.v.} (from something like *aNa(n)e-) and ahaide ‘relative’ {q.v.} (possibly from *anai-). The reality of this stem is far from secure, and the required fluctuation in form is troubling, but M. (****{1977a: 583-584}) proposes an original *ana- with “expressive strengthening” to *aNa- in some cases. [FHV 583-584]
*ana- {[2]}, *ano- [MITX 73: 46, 357] {M. 1973a: 45, 112.}
-ana, -ano Toponymic suffixes. [MITX 73] {M. 1973a: 45-46.}



Etymological Dictionary of Basque 93
anaia (B Sout L) (1104, 1562), anaie (B LN) (1157, 1571), anáie (Z), anaje (B) ([<j> = []), anaxe (LN R), anae (B), anai (B G L LN Z) n. (B) ‘brother of a man’, (c. exc. B) ‘brother’.
OUO, but contains -ba kinship suffix {??}. Possibly contains the hypothetical stem *ana- {[1]} ~ *aNa-. It is not clear whether the Sout def. form anaya represents anaia or anai. The conservative form is clearly something like *aNaea, which may descend from *aNanea, by P1. Loss of final /a/ in some forms by M**{4}. In the 11th and 12th centuries, the word was written with <nn>: mea annaia senior Enneco Sangiz (1104), Dominici Annaye, Iohannis Annaye (1223) (M. 1961a: 306). Ib. exhibits an element ANAI-, of unknown meaning.

-anda (**) Diminutive or female suffix. [FHV 258]
andere (LN R) (1085, 1545), andé(r)e (Z), andre (G HN L LN Z) (12th cent., 1545), anre (HN) n. ‘lady’ ‘young lady’, TS (HN G LN Z) ‘doll’ (1802), TS (Z) ‘queen bee’, TS (Z) ‘concubine’, andra (B Sout) (15th cent.), anra (B), andera (old B) (1596) ‘lady’, TS ‘woman’, TS ‘doll’. Dimin. anddere (G HN) ‘doll’. (A. 1905 reports that part of LN distinguishes andre ‘lady’ from andere ‘young lady’.)
OUO, and much discussed. Short variants by syncope {P38}; B variants by M5. The sense of ‘lady’ predominates in the earliest texts, and is regarded by probably all specialists as the original sense. The word is recorded in Aq. as the female name ANDERE and as the element ANDERE- in other female names (M. ****{1961a: 161 fn. 14, 356}). Many have proposed a link with the Celtic word represented by Old Irish ander ‘young woman’; see Vendryes (****{1959: s.v.}). But Gorrochategui (****{1984: 129ff.}) makes a fascinating proposal. He notes the existence in Aq. of male personal names built on a stem ANDOS(S)-, alongside the female names in ANDERE-. He further notes the presence in Bq. of the apparent suffix -(d)ots, occurring in animal names, on occasion in names of male animals, as in ****. Then he proposes an Aq. stem *and-, which he suggests as the source of a word *andots ‘lord’, with the male suffix, and of andere, with an otherwise unknown female suffix. This is consistent with the observation that the historical word for ‘lord’, jaun, not only is absent from our Aq. texts but looks like the participle of a verb pressed into service as a noun; see jaun for discussion.
anderauren (LN old Z), andrauren (old B) n. ‘lady of the house’, ‘young lady of good family’, ‘serving girl, maid’. 1657. + guren ‘favourite’ (see gura), by P16 (M. 1961a: 116). A good deal of confusion surrounds this word. It famously occurs in Oihenart’s proverb 173: Urruneko neskak anderauren hots ‘Serving girls from far away are said to be ladies’. A number of scholars have taken Oihenart’s form as a typo, and “corrected” it to *anderaurren, as though the second element were aurren ‘first, principal’ (see ahur), by an apparent folk etymology. Further, A. (1905) mistakenly takes this anderauren as containing the genitive case-suffix -en {[1]} (with inserted /r/ by P**{35.1}), and extracts an erroneous *anderau, which he glosses as ‘lady’. AT dismiss the putative anderaurren as a fiction, yet Lh. cites the word only in this form, attributing it not only to Oihenart (wrongly) but to other writers as well.

andereder (LN), anddereder (L), anderejer (Z) , andderejer (Z), armindderi (A) n. ‘weasel’ (zool.) (****). + eder ‘beautiful’. Cf. Fr. belette, Port. Gal. doninha, donicella, all id. (M. ****{Michelena & Agud 1968: 80} Arb).
andereño n. ‘unmarried woman’ (used as a title) (1852), TS ‘female schoolteacher’ (1922). + -ño dimin. (see -no).

OUO. Cannot contain -ti [**{1}] AFS, because, by P6, this would predict *(h)anti in Z and R. Unlikely to contain -i [**{1}] AFS, since *and- looks an impossible stem. The forms in /au/ are mysterious. There are three proposals: (1) an original /au/ has been widely reduced to /a/ because of the following cluster (by P46); (2) an original /a/ has been expanded to /au/ by a misapplication of P46; (3) the forms in /au/ are augmentative forms of unique formation. M. (1961a: 96; 1977a: 488) points out that (h)andi predominates so completely in the medieval and early texts that (h)aundi is probably nowhere recorded before 1700, and perhaps not even before the 19th century. The surname or sobriquet Andia is well recorded in the med. period. A. (1905) reports that, in the B of his day, aundi was an augmentative form of andi, though this is not so today. M. (****{1954a: 437} Arb) notes a possible link with the ANDOSS- of Aq. male names like ANDOSSUS, but see andere for another proposal.

*-ar Hypothetical NFS with a collective sense.
Its reality is not certain, but, as first pointed out by *****, Bq. has many nouns ending in a morph -ar which denote things commonly encountered in bunches, rather than individually, and in fact M. (****{1958a}) describes this *-ar as “well documented”. Examples include abar ‘branch’, belar ‘grass’, hondar ‘sand’, ‘residue’, ilar ‘pea’, izar ‘star’, negar ‘tears’, sagar ‘apple’, and possibly adar ‘horn’, ohar ‘advice, warning’, zatar ‘rag’ and bizar ‘beard’ (if this originally meant ‘whiskers’). The numeral-name hamar ‘ten’ may also be relevant. Against this, it must be noted that Bq. has many nouns in -ar for which a collective reading is, at best, difficult: behar ‘necessity’, bihar ‘tomorrow’, ibar ‘valley’, indar ‘force’, leizar ‘ash tree’, zilar ‘silver’, ***** {On -ar in tree and plant names see M. 1973a: 60.}
ar (** Z) **** {a.} ‘male’

arai (Sout) n. ‘mastiff’. 1562.
From some Rom. form akin to Cast. alano id., by P**{22}.
arhamenta (Z), ahamenda-(belhar) (LN Z) n. Sense disputed: A. (1905) and Múg. give ‘absinthe, wormwood’ (bot.) (Artemisia absinthium), while Lh. and Daranatz give ‘mint’.
The second element can hardly be other than Rom. menta ‘mint’. The first is less obvious, but Lh. proposes arhan ‘plum’ (see aran), and this is endorsed by AT (s.v. ahamenda): the sense of ‘plum-mint’ is to be taken as ‘wild mint’. Corominas, cited in AT, suggests a development from Rom. absenta ‘absinthe’, as follows: *absenta > *asbenta > *asmenta > *ar(a)menta. But this ingenuity appears misplaced.
haran (**), aran (**) *** n. ‘valley’. ****

OUO. There have been attempts to relate this to the Rom. word represented by Arag. arañón and to the Celtic word represented by Irish áirne and Welsh eirin, but M.

ardo (G HN S A), ardao (B Sout), ardau (B), ardão (old B), arno (L LN), ano (LN), ardṹ (Z), ardáũ (R) n. ‘wine’. CF ardan-. 1498, 1545.
From *ardano, OUO, by P1, P**{35.3} (Altube ****{1923: 518ff.}, M. 1961a: 151). CF by W1. The form ardum is recorded by Aimery Picaud in the 12th cent. for an unknown variety; this probably represents [ardũ]. The curious phrase ardan bustia ‘wet wine’ occurs in the magical charm found in a manuscript in the cathedral of Pamplona, usually dated to the 14th century and published in Gifford and Michelena (1958) and in M. (1964**{b}: 57–59); this is surely to be interpreted as a compound containing the CF. Landucci (1562) {in Agud & Michelena (1958)}does not list the independent word for Sout, but cites ardaoan bodegu[ea], glossed as ‘bodega de vino’, with an apparent genitive -an (< -aren), pointing to *ardao for Sout. The CF ardan- is recorded in surnames as early as the 1{3}th cent., for example Sancho Ardanburu in 1283, and the toponym Ardanui, apparently ‘vineyard’, is recorded in Ribagorza (C. ****{1994 s.v.}).
As an independent word, this means ‘wine’ in almost all citations, though a few early texts have it in the sense of ‘any fermented beverage’ (Agud ****{1983}, Sarasola 1996). It occurs as the final element in compounds denoting a range of alcoholic beverages, though A. (1905)’s proposal of ‘any kind of beverage’ seems unjustifiable. See gari, sagar, mahats for examples of such compounds.
Many scholars have wanted to see a possible link with Albanian ardhi ‘wine’ and with Armenian ort, frequently glossed as ‘wine’ in the comparative literature but in fact meaning ‘vineyard’. These comparisons, which would apparently require the Bq. word to be a compound, are questionable. [FHV 127]
ardanbera (G) n. ‘finest variety of a beverage, esp. cider’. + bera ‘soft’.

***** Last form by P**{14}.
arrats (**), arts (A S), aats (L), ats (L) n. ‘evening’, ‘night’. ****
****{OUO.} Possibly from arre ‘grey’ (M. ****){? Campión, 1899: 316. AT}. The last two forms cannot be regularly derived from arrats, and may point to an unrecorded variant *arats.
arratsalde (**), artsalde (A S), atsalde (B HN L) n. ‘afternoon’. **** + alde ‘side’ {(see *al-)}.
atsaldaskari (old L) n. ‘mid-afternoon meal’, ‘snack’. + -kari meal suffix {(see -ari [2])}. **** [FHV 513]

From *arranu or *arrano, taken IE and probably from Celtic: cf. Old Irish ram(e) id. (M. *****{1957c: 156 n. 68} Arb; M. credits Nils Holmer).

Obscure. The first element might be aho ‘mouth’, a suggestion attributed to van Eys by AT (s.v. aarrausi). The second is probably hautsi ‘break’ (M. 1961a: 289) (see hauts). [FHV 96]
arraza (**) n. ‘race’. **** [FHV 155]

arre (**) a. ‘grey’.
****{OUO.}
arreba (c.) n. ‘sister of a man’. 1537.
OUO, but contains -ba kinship suffix. M. (****{1961a: 310 n. 20 + AT}) diffidently suggests a derivative of ar ‘male’; see neba. See also ahizpa.
arreba-erdi (B G), arreberdi (B G) n. ‘half-sister’ (of a man). + erdi ‘half’.

harri (L LN), hárri (Z), arri (B Sout G HN A S R) n. ‘stone’. CF (h)arr-. ****.
OUO. Many, such as M. (1961a: 219), have seen this as representing the pre-IE stem *karr- ‘rock’ which is attested in Rom. and possibly in Celtic, but the identification is not certain. See ****. CF by W2.1. [FHV 251 fn.]

****{OUO.} Gavel (****{1920: 77} Arb) proposes an original *aurte, which might be built upon *aur ‘front’, but there is little direct support for this, apart perhaps from the surname Recaurte (M. ****{1973a: 58} Arb).

arto (B G HN), artho (L LN Z) n. (fomerly) ‘millet’ (bot.) (Setaria italica), (today) ‘maize’ (bot.) (Zea mays). CF arta-. 1562.
CF by W2.2. OUO. The word is well attested as ‘millet’ in the early literature, but, with the displacement of millet by maize as a staple cereal in the 16th–17th centuries, the name was transferred to the somewhat similar-looking maize.
artatxiki (B G) n. ‘millet’. 1745, 1847. + txiki ‘small’ (see tipi).
hartu (**), artu (**), hártü (Z) ****{vt. ‘take’}
{Root *har-, OUO.}
hartz (L LN Z), artz (B Sout G HN S) n. ‘bear’ (zool.) (Ursus). 1330, 1562.
OUO. Possibly attested as Aq. HARS- in male names like HARSUS (M. 1961a: 219). Scholars from Schuchardt onward have tried to see this as a loan from Celtic, but the probable Celtic nom. *artos should have yielded *(h)artotz, not the observed form.
artz eme (Sout) n. ‘she-bear’. 1562. + eme ‘female’.
artzaiera {(G)}****{n. ‘reception, admission’} [Arb]
harzara (**), harzá(r)a (Z), arza (**), artsa (**), arsa (**), astra (R) adv. ‘again’. **** [FHV 162, 162 fn., 364]

asentsio (B G), asensio (old G?), asentsio-belar (**), asentsio-bedar (**) n. ‘wormwood’ (bot.) (****) ****
From Lat. absinthium id., with unusual assimilation of the /t/; sometimes reinforced by belar {[1]} ‘plant’ (M. 1961a: 283).

asikun(a) (B), asikuren (B), asikor (B), asikontxo (G) n. ‘glanders, goitre’. ****
M. (****{1957a: 22} Arb) sees the first element as hazi ‘grow’, by P**{21}.
aska (**), arska (**) n. ‘crib’ **** [FHV 368] [Arb] [AT]
{[}askari (**) n. ****{‘lunch, tea’.} CF askal-.
Clearly contains the meal suffix -ari [2]. The first element may be arrats ‘grey’ (M. 1961a: 246 fn. 38). CF by W**{12}.
askaldu (**) **** {] Partly duplicates askari under arrats. Moved there.}
askatu (B G HN), eskatu (B HN) **** ‘let go of, loose, untie’, TS ‘free, liberate’, lazkatu (G) **** ‘loosen, slacken’ ****
From Lat. *lascāre ‘untie’ (M. 1961a: 324). [FHV 551: important] [Arb]
aske (**) a. ‘free’. ****
asmo (**), asmu (**) n. ‘idea’. **** CF asma-. [FHV 350]

asmatu (**), asmau (**) vt. ‘think of’. **** + -tu VFS.
aspaldi (** Z R) n. ‘a long time ago’. ****
First element obscure. The second is aldi ‘time’ (M. 1961a: 356).
aste (c.), áste (Z) n. ‘week’. CF asta-{?? see below astearte}. 1545.
CF by W2.2. OUO. May contain -te {[1]} NFS of duration. A connection with hasi ‘begin’ has often been suggested but cannot be supported.
astagaitz (L), astegaitz (Z) n. ‘menstruation, period’. 1857. + gaitz ‘bad’.
astearte (**) n. ‘Tuesday’. 1636. + arte [1] ‘interval, between’. Together with astelehen and asteazken (below), this name has often been taken as meaning that the Basques once recognized a three-day week, but such an arrangement seems inconvenient and implausible. Moreover, the absence of the expected combining form *asta-, the absence of any resolution of the hiatus (P**{35}) and the apparent retention in the second of the aspiration in an illegal position (P**){§3} all indicate strongly that all three words are late formations, though of wholly obscure motivation.
asteazken (**) n. ‘Wednesday’. 1621. + azken ‘last’. See astearte (above) for comments.



112 R. L. Trask
astebete (**) n. ‘week’. **** + bete ‘full’. [FHV 412]

astigar (**), aztigar (**), gaztigar (**), txastegiar (S) **** n. ‘maple’ (bot.) (****). **** [FHV 253]
The second element is probably ihar ‘maple’. The first might be **** (Arb). {M. 1973a: 60.}
astin (**) a. **** ****{‘spongy, soft’}
Obscure. M. (1977a: 487) proposes hauts ‘powder’ + -din ‘resembling’ (see *edin).
astindu (**) ****{vt. ‘inflate’, ‘shake’}
asto (c.), arsto (R old Z?) n. ‘donkey, ass’ (zool.) (****). CF asta-. 1562. [FHV 368]
OUO. CF by W2.2. A derivation from Cast. asno id. would be without parallel, and would leave the R form unexplained. A. (****{Euskera 1: 5}) proposes hartz ‘bear’ + -to {[1]} dimin. This is semantically odd but phonologically perfect: *arzto > arsto (by P18) > asto (by P{19}). Possibly represented by Aq. ASTO-. (Arb)
asteme (Sout **) n. ‘female donkey’. 1562. + eme ‘female’.
asto-ume (** old LN) n. ‘young donkey’. + -kume ‘offspring’ (see ume).
astun (**) a. ‘heavy’. **** ****

asturu (** old LN), astru (**) n. ‘luck, fortune’. ****
From Lat. astrum ‘star’ (M. 1961a: 158).

asturutsu (old LN **) a. ‘lucky, fortunate’. **** + -tsu AFS.
asturuz (old LN) adv. ‘by chance’. **** + -z advbl./instrl.
hasuin (**), asuin (**), asuñ (**), asun (B {G LN}), ásün (Z) n. ‘nettle’ (bot.) (****). [FHV 140 fn.]
atal (**) n. ‘segment, portion, fragment’. ****
atapa (B), atape (B) n. ‘covering of moss or [argoma] placed over a pile of wood to be converted into charcoal’. ****
Probably from old Cast. atapar ‘cover’ (mod. tapar) (M. ****{1953c: 482; 1961g: 357} Arb).

atertu (**), athertu (**) vi. ‘clear up’ (of weather). ****
atizatu (R), atxezatu (R) v. [diathesis unknown] ‘take communion’. ****
OUO, but certainly not native (M. ****{1964a: 99; 1965c: 119 n3} Arb).
atomau (B) v. [diathesis unknown] ‘dare’. **** [Arb]
atorra (B G HN L LN), athorra (L LN Z) ‘shirt’, ‘blouse’. 15th cent.
From Arab. ad-durrā‛a ‘kind of wool shirt’, by L1 (M. 1961a: 229). Old Cast. adorra ‘shirt’ derives from the same source, but cannot be the direct source of the Bq. word, since a borrowing from Cast. would have produced *adorra. In the north, the word is usually applied to a man’s shirt; in the south, to a woman’s blouse. [Arb]
hats (**), ats (**) n. ‘breath’. ****{‘anger’}
arnasa (B G), asnasa (G HN), asnase (G HN) n. ****{‘breath’} [FHV 294]
haserre (**), aserre (**) n. ‘anger’, **** **** + erre ‘burn’ (M. ****{1953a: 140} Arb; 1961a: 289). M. dismisses Lafon’s objections as phonologically indefensible.
hatsalbo (Z) a. ‘winded, out of breath’. Second element opaque: albo ‘side’ (see *al-) makes no sense and is not recorded in the east.
atseden (**), hatseden (**) ****{n. ‘rest’} [Az.] [Arb] {M. BAP 9: 141.}
atsekabe (**) ****{n. ‘affliction, grief’} + gabe ‘without’ (M. 1977a: 584). The development is *atsede-gabe (by W**{10}) > *atsed-gabe (by W**{1}) > *atsetgabe (by W**{3}) > *atsetkabe (by W**{4}) > atsekabe.
atsegin (**) n. ‘pleasure’. **** [FHV 210]

hatu (L LN), hátu (Z), atu (R) n. ‘baggage, belongings, effects’ ****
From Rom.: cf. Cast. hato, Port. fato ‘bundle’ (M. **** BAP 7 {1951a}: 545; 1961a: 214).
atun (**), áthün (Z) n. ‘tuna’ (zool.) (****). ****
atxaki(a) (B Sout L) (1562), atxaiki(a) (Sout) (1562) [CHECK], atxeki (Z), atxekia (HN), aitzaki(a) (G HN L) (1627), aitzeki (Z) n. ‘pretext, excuse’.
From Old Cast. achaque id. (M. ****{1961a: 184}). Last two forms by back-formation: reversal of the apparent expressive palatalization, M**{9}. Sources are variable in recognizing the final /a/ or not.
atxeter (old Z) n. ‘doctor, physician’. ****
From *artxeter, by P**{24}, from Lat. archiater id. (M. 1961a: 339{; 1974b: 201}).

****
eratxeki (** Z) ****{vt. ‘cause to adhere’}
hatz [1] (L LN Z), atz (B Sout S R) n. (L LN Z S R) ‘paw’ (of an animal), (B) ‘finger’, ‘thumb’, (L LN Z) ‘footprint’ (of an animal or a person), (L LN Z?) ‘track, trail’, ‘trace, vestige’. 1562.
OUO. The original sense is app. ‘paw’, with the development ‘paw’ > ‘finger’ on one hand and ‘paw’ > ‘footprint’ > ‘track’ > ‘vestige’ on the other. See the further developments below.
atzamar (B) n. ‘finger’, atzapar (**), aztapar (**), haztapar (**) n. ‘claw’ (of a bird), ‘paw’ (of an animal) ****. This word commonly occurs in the pl. as atzamarrak etc., and most scholars have followed the 18th-cent. writer Mogel in seeing this as *hatzhamarrak ‘the ten fingers’, with hamar ‘ten’. The problem is the order: the numeral hamar always precedes its head noun, and the order required here is anomalous. [Arb] {M. 1961a: 276 and fn. 29.}

Obscure. By P**{6}, /lk/ should not survive, and it seems probable that the peripheral forms with /r/ are conservative, while the central forms with /l/ are innovations. AT (s.v.), citing Corominas, suggest that the word is identical in origin to aurki ‘right away’ (see *aur); this view requires an enormous amount of semantic work, but a derivation from *aur ‘front’ is perhaps not unreasonable.

From Hispano-Arabic as-safunāriya id., OUO, or more likely from some Rom. borrowing of this, such as Old Cast. çahanoria (mod. zanahoria). The last two variants show a clear folk etymology, as though from zain [**{2}] ‘root’ + hori {[2]} ‘yellow’, with the /a/ analysed as the Bq. article.

From *azenari, by P1, P35, from the attested Lat. personal name Asenarius (M. 1949a, 1956a). A Rom. personal name Acenari is recorded from 972 {Azenari 921 CORDE}, and a Bq. personal name Aceari (occasionally Azari) from the 11th cent.; the Bq. forms yield patronymics Aceariz and Azariz, with -iz patronymic. The use of personal names to denote ‘fox’ is well attested in Gallo-Romance and Ibero-Romance. See luki.

OUO. Most of the variants can be traced back to an original *azkone, by P1 (M. ****{1949a: 486}). This might be borrowed from {late} Lat. taxōnem id. (M. ****{1964a: 193}). The treatment of Lat. /ks/ is highly variable in Bq., and zk is not an implausible rendering, though there is no clear parallel for this. Loss of the initial /t/ would be unusual, but see P14. It is also possible that the word is native and derived from hartz ‘bear’ with an unidentifiable second element. The final -ar or -arro found in some variants appears to be an addition, probably of expressive origin, though ar ‘male’ perhaps cannot be entirely ruled out.

azmantar (G), azmantal (B), azmandar (G), azpantar (B G), azpandar (G), aspantar (**) n. ‘gaiter, legging’. Usually n. pl. azmantarrak etc. ****
The second element is mantar ‘gaiter’. The first is obscure. The word hatz {[1]} ‘paw’ is phonologically perfect, but this word is not commonly applied to the human leg or foot.

Puzzling. The common /-i/ is hard to reconcile with B /-u/. Castro Guisasola (****{1944} 235) and Gorrochategui {?l. Gorostiaga (1982: 121)} (**** FLV 39: 121) see this as taken from Lat. astrum ‘star’, with semantic shift, but there are large obstacles.

Probably from old Cast. bacallao id. (mod. bacalao). The Cast. word is of unknown and much-discussed origin. A Bq. origin has been proposed, but is highly implausible: the word does not look like a native Bq. word, and anyway CP report (s.v. bacalao) that the word is recorded in the Low Countries centuries earlier than anywhere in the Iberian Peninsula. It is conceivable that the Basques, who in the Middle Ages had strong trading links with the Low Countries, might have brought the word back to Spain, but the linguistic forms are more consistent with a Cast. loan into Bq.

bargo (B G L LN) n. ‘shoat’, ‘young male pig’ (3–6 months). 1847.
OUO. The word resembles half-a-dozen ‘pig’ words in western European languages, but cannot be plausibly related to any of them.

128 R. L. Trask
baso (B G HN old Z) n. ‘woods’, ‘wilderness’, ‘mountains’. CF basa-. 1284, 1562.
OUO. CF by W2.2. As Sarasola (1996 s.v.) points out, the defining characteristic of the baso is not so much that it has trees but that it is uninhabited and devoid of farmland: hence ‘wilderness’ appears to be the central sense, even though this has become the usual western word for ‘woods’, alongside eastern oihan (baso is sparsely recorded in the east but has died out there). It is merely that, in the Basque Country, which lacks sandy or rocky deserts, wilderness is always wooded, apart from a few bare rocky mountaintops. The CF basa- has become a pseudo-prefix meaning ‘wild’. *****
Basajaun (**) n. ‘the Old Man of the Woods’, a figure of folklore, generally depicted as a wild and dangerous hairy man or man-like creature living in the woods and threatening passers-by. 1847. + jaun ‘gentleman’. The late attestation does not support any great antiquity for the figure. In some accounts, Basajaun is given a mate, Basandrea, + andere ‘lady’.
basati (B L), basoti (old G?) a. ‘savage’, ‘wild’. 1745, 1808. + -ti {[1]} AFS.
baserri (B G), basarri (B), basaerri (old B) [hapax] n. ‘sparsely inhabited area far from town’ (17th cent.), TS ‘farmhouse’ (1745, 1760). + herri ‘inhabited place’. B form by P**{59}. Today this is the usual western word for a Basque farmhouse; see eastern borda.
bat (c.) num (psp.) ‘one’; TS det. ‘a certain’, ‘a, an’. 15th cent.
From *badV, probably *bade (M. 1961a: 134), OUO, by P40. In conservative varieties, the determiner retains the sense of ‘a certain’, but in most varieties it has become an indefinite article. It is not clear to what extent this is an internal development and to what extent it results from the influence of Rom.
bakan (**) **** [FHV 70, 70 fn.] {But see bakant; M. proposes a Romance origin.}
bakar (B G HN L), bakhar (L LN Z) a. ‘unique’, ‘lone, alone’,TS ‘pure, unmixed’. 15th cent. Final element obscure, but apparently *-gar or *-kar.

bederatzi (B G HN L LN), bedratzi (HN LN A S), bederatzu (R), bedrátzu (R),
bede(r)átzü (Z) num. ‘nine’. 1562. The common form points to *bederatzi; the R Z forms to *bederatzu. There are two views. One, the form is *bederatzu, with common -tzi resulting from contamination by the preceding zortzi ‘eight’ in counting (M. ****). Two, the form is *bederatzi, and the R Z form results from reanalysis, by P67, of the forms in which final /u/ is fronted to /i/ before a vowel-initial suffix (M. ****). I prefer the first, since this word is more frequent in isolation than with suffixes. The final element is unidentifiable; we may perhaps surmise something along the lines of ‘one left’.
bataiatu (**), bateiatu (** A), batheiátü (Z), bateatu (S), batixatu (R) vt. ‘baptize’. ****.
bathi (L LN Z) n. ****{‘resolution, resignation’ M.} Lh. [FHV 208]

be- (or possibly b-) (c.) Third-person imperative (optative) prefix in finite verb-forms.
OUO. Still frequent in the early literature, this prefix is now fossilized in a handful of forms, as in bedi ‘let him..’, ‘let it..’, the third-singular intransitive auxiliary from *edin, and bego ‘let him be’, from egon ‘be (in a state)’, mainly in the expression Goian bego ‘R.I.P.’, lit. ‘may he be on high’. See da- and le-.

From ****{Gasc. medecĩ < Fr. médecin}, by L**{3}.
bedoi (Z), pedoi (LN) ****{n. ‘billhook’} [FHV 508]
From some development, undoubtedly Gasc. {sc. bedoùy, Palay (1980)}, of {late} Lat. vidubium ****{id., ML §9320} (M. 1977a: 508). [CHECK V LENGTH {Done.}] M. rejects Schuchardt’s proposal of Cast. podón ‘billhook’ on phonological grounds.
behe (LN?), bee (B), be (B G) n. ‘bottom’, **** CH be(h)e-, bea-, be-, behei-. 1196, 1643.
OUO. The form behe is virtually unrecorded as an independent noun, though Sarasola (1996 s.v.) cites a solitary example from an unidentified religious text. However, all varieties exhibit numerous derivatives of this word. The last CF, found in several derivatives in L and LN, is puzzling, as is the absence of the expected CF *beha-, by W2.2. In parts of G, the def. form of be is beia, reflecting earlier bee (M. 1961a: 110). A toponym Olabe(h)e çahar in Elorrio (Bizkaia) in 1053.
-be, -pe ****{‘under’}

behere (**) a. ‘lower’. ****
begi (c.) n. ‘eye’ (anat.). CF bet-, beta-. 1080, 1545.
OUO. First CF by W2.1, W3. The rare second CF is irregular and puzzling. See also bigira.
begiluze (B L R) a. ‘envious’, begiluze (L), begiluz (R) ‘curious’. **** + luze ‘long’. Last form by W**{19?}. The form *begiluz must once have been more widespread, to account for the existence of Alavese Spanish biguilúz and Navarrese Spanish birilúz, both ‘curious, nosy, meddlesome’ (M. 1961a: 411).
beginini (B G Z R), begininiko (L) n. ‘pupil of the eye’. + nini ‘child, pupil’ {(not in The Dictionary, but see ñiñika)} (+ -ko NFS).

begitarte (B G HN R), begitharte (L LN), begithárte (Z), betarte (?), bertaite (LN) n. ‘face’. 1545. + arte {[1]} ‘between’; /t/ by W18. M. (1961a: 417) suggests that the anomalous aspiration in some variants points to a recent formation, incompletely compounded.

bekhaizteria (old LN) n. **** [FHV 258]. + -keria NFS of vices, with dissimilation.
bekar (B), makar (G HN) n. ‘rheum’. ****. M. (****{1961a: 242 n. 33}) sees the odd second form as resulting from plosive dissimilation, but it is simpler to see this as an instance of the insertion of the expressive syllable ma-. [FHV 70]

OUO. The peculiar last variant is confined to a single village. CF by W2.1, W5. Lhande (1926, s.v.) suggests a possible link with behor ‘mare’; this cannot be evaluated. A toponym Betolhazaha in Alava 1025.

*bel or *beL (c.) a. ? ‘dark’.

bele (**), béle (Z), bela (B) n. ‘crow’ (zool.) (****)
beltz (c. exc. B), baltz (B) a. ‘black’. 1072, 1545. + an obscure second element. Very likely contracted by W19 from earlier *beletz, represented by Aq. BELEX, BELES(S)etc. (M. 1961a: 416). B form by P59. The item is very frequent in medieval personal names, and even seemingly occurs as a name on its own, as in Don Belcho de Yrurre (Lacarra ****{1930}; see -o [*{2}]). We have Nunno Balza in Alava in 984, and Nunno Balza de Seroiana in 1022. The word occurs uniquely as faltz in the celebrated passage in uilla Nunnofalzahuri ‘in the town of Nuño the Black’ (Alava, 1078), where huri ‘town’ (see hiri) duplicates Lat. uilla. Ib. -BELES (and several variants) is of unknown sense but may represent the same item.
beltzil (L?) [hapax?] n. ‘January’. **** + -il ‘month’ (see *iLe). The order of elements here is strange; see ilbeltz id. (under *iLe).

beldur (G HN L LN R) (1545), béldür (Z), bildur (B G Sout) (13th cent, 1415), billur (**), illddur (B) n. ‘fear’. [FHV 356]
OUO. The east/west contrast in form is long established: the personification Don Bildur ‘Mr Fear’ appears in the work of the 13th-cent. Castilian poet Berceo, and bildurra ‘fear’ is recorded in Alavese Spanish. Second form probably by vowel-height assimilation [REWRITE: RULE {i.e. P60, where beldur is derived from bildur, an example of lowering of [i] to [e] before /lC/.}]
bildura (R) n. ‘nervous trembling’. Surely the same word, but with curious features: western /i/ in place of eastern /e/, and a tapped /r/ in place of the trilled /rr/ of the base word.

OUO. Could be from *bero or from *belo, by P22. But an imitative origin cannot be ruled out, since items of the approximate form ber(ber) are frequent in languages as onomatopoeias for the sound of boiling, and these often acquire transferred senses like ‘burn’, ‘hot’, ‘fire’ and ‘cook’. In places, the dimin. has displaced the original as the ordinary word, by M**{10}.

*bez(a)- Hypothetical stem, of unknown sense, possibly underlying the following items.
bezain (c.), bezin (G HN), baizen (**), baxen (B), bekain (**), bikain (**), bikin (R) prt. ‘as...as’. 1545. + hain ‘so much’, ‘that much’ (see *har). [FHV 105, 178, 297] [A MESS: SORT] [MORE: FHV 544]

bi (c.) (1545), biga (L LN) (1545), bida (HN LN S) (1759), bia (old L) (17th c.) num. (psp. or prp.; see below) ‘two’.
OUO. It is clear that biga is the conservative form, with bida by P10 and the other forms by reduction. Lafon (1959{b}) and M. (1961a) attribute the reduction to W19, since this numeral was anciently postposed: it is sporadically postposed in early eastern texts (Lafon 1959{b}), and still postposed today in B, though in other varieties today it is preposed. In L and LN today, biga is the form used in counting and when the word constitutes a noun phrase all by itself, while bi is used as part of a larger noun phrase; all other varieties have generalized bi to all contexts. See -garren. [FHV 413 fn.]
biaka (Z), biakin (Z), biaxkin (Z), biraxkin (Z), bibiro (HN), bibitxi (L), bikarro (B; also Castilian of Alava), biratx (R), biratxo (R), birazkako (LN), biritx (L LN), biritxi (L LN), birki (L), biroki (G) n. ‘twin(s)’. All of these numerous local forms are built upon bi, with various extensions, mostly unidentifiable but sometimes containing recognizable elements, such as bitxi; some of them apparently contain a reduplication of bi. See also biki and bizki below. It appears that words for ‘twin(s)’ have been unstable and frequently re-formed, though always on the base bi.
bika (c.) adv. ‘in twos’, ‘in pairs’. + -ka AdvFS.
biki (B) n. ‘pair of twins’, ‘twin’, TS a. ‘twin’. 1745, 1808. + -ki [3] NFS. The usual sense is ‘twin’, though a few early attestations seem to require ‘pair of twins’. {Cf. bizki below.}
bikoitz (B G) (1905), bikotx (B L) (c. 1808) a. ‘double’. + -koitz AFS {(not in The Dictionary)}. Second form by P30. One source cites an L variant bikotz, which is probably an error, and a second reports the sense ‘twin(s)’ for L, a sense not substantiated elsewhere.
bikonde (B G) a. ‘double’. Final element opaque. Uhlenbeck (****{1909}) suggests a derivative of bikun (below) with a further unknown suffix.
bikor (G) a. ‘double’. 1905 + -kor AFS.

bizpahiru (Z), bizpahirur (L LN Z), bizpur (S), bizpor (R) det. ‘two or three’ ‘a few’. 1785. From *bi ez bada hiru(r) ‘two if not three’, + ez ‘not’ + ba- ‘if’ + da ‘it is’ (finite form of izan ‘be’) + hiru(r) ‘three’ (A. 1905).
bizpalaur (Z) det. ‘a few’, ‘several’. From *bi ez bada laur ‘two if not four’, as in the preceding, + lau(r) ‘four’.
biaje (c.?) (1545), bidaje (c.?) (1571) n. ‘journey, trip’.
From Cast. viaje id. or a related Rom. form. Second form by contamination from bide ‘road’. See also biaia (under bide [1]).
biao, biago, bidago, bigao, bixao (B) n. ‘siesta’, ‘mid-day nap’. 1596.
M. (1964a: {100; 1974b: 196}}) derives this specifically B word from Lat. meridiānum ‘pertaining to the middle of the day’, or from some Rom. development of this. The phonological reduction is unusually extensive, but M. proposes the following approximate development, some of which may have occurred in Rom. before the word was borrowed: meridianum > *meidiano > *meyano > *miano > *mião (by P1) > *bião > biao, with the variants deriving from P35 and P54, P55. The semantic development is Rom., not Bq. Reflexes of the Lat. word occur widely in Rom. with similar senses: Sardinian meriacru ‘shady place where cattle gather during the heat of the day’, Santander mediaju id., old Occ. meliana ‘noon’, ‘siesta’, and others.
biao-leku (B) n. ‘shady place where cattle gather during the heat of the day’. + leku ‘place’.
bihar (L LN Z), biar (B Sout G LN R), bigar (G), bixar (B) adv. ‘yesterday {tomorrow}’. 1562.
OUO. The severely localized third form by P35.1. Last form by P54, P55.



140 R. L. Trask
biharamun (**), biaramun (**), bihámen (Z) n. ‘next day’. **** + egun ‘day’ (M. 1961a: 335). M. proposes *bi(h)aregun > *bi(h)arebun (by P**{10}) > *bi(h)aremun (by P**{7}).
{[}bidaia (**), pi(d)aia (LN) n. **** [FHV 240] {] Duplicates bidaia s.v. bide.}
{[}bidaide (**) n. ‘travelling companion’. **** + -ide ‘fellow’ (see ****{-kide}). [FHV 245] {] Duplicates bidaide s.v. bide.}
bidali (1809) (G HN LN Z), biali (HN) (1783), birali (HN) vt. ‘send’, bidali (LN S) ‘find’, ‘get hold of, obtain’.
Probably from Cast. enviar ‘send’, with loss of the prefix (L14), irregular treatment of /r/, and folk-etymology from bide ‘road’ in the common form (Schuchardt ****{1906a: 26}). If so, a late example of the use of -i {(see -i} [**{1}] {AFS} in a borrowed verb.
bidaldu (B HN L) (15th cent.), bialdu (B) (1785), bealdu (B), bildu (B), biraldu (B G), bigaldu (G) vt. ‘send’. By transfer to the -tu class (M**{14}).
bide (c.), bire (G) n. ‘road’, ‘way’. 1090, 14th cent. TS (G HN L LN) prt. ‘apparently’, ‘probably’, ‘undoubtedly’ (1545). CF bida-.
OUO. CF by W2.2. The often-proposed derivation from Lat. viam id. appears indefensible. As a final element in word-formation, it often has the sense ‘means’, as in ogibide ‘job’ (ogi ‘bread’). In this position, it is occasionally reduced to -bi, by W**{19}; see examples under zur, ur and orbide.
The modal use has occasioned some speculation. In a document of ****, we find a single instance of bide used as deontic ‘must’, in bide dela ‘as one must’, and in a document of **** we find a single instance of bide used as epistemic ‘must’, in eratu ni bide naiz ‘I must have gone crazy’. Together with bide izan ‘be proper’ (below), all this suggests a semantic development along the following lines: ‘way’ > ‘(proper) way (of doing something)’ > deontic ‘must’ > epistemic ‘must’ > ‘undoubtedly’ (I am indebted to Alexis Manaster Ramer (p.c.) for suggesting this).
bidagin (B) (ca. 1760), bidagile (ca. 1760), bidegile (1958) n. ‘road-builder’, bidagin (B) ‘courier’. + -gin, -gile ‘maker’ (see egin).

bidagiro n. (G) ‘good time for a journey’, (HN) ‘journey, trip’, ‘state of the road’. + giro ‘temperature’.

bigae (B), biga (G), miga (HN LN) n. ‘two-year-old heifer’. CF bigan-. 1571. Dimin. (G) miatxo.
From *bigana, by P**{1} {P7}, from Lat. {*}bimānam, app. ‘two-year-old heifer’, app. with contamination from bi(ga) ‘two’ (M. 1961a: 145). Note: this Lat. word, app. a derivative of bīmus ‘two years old’, I can find in no Lat. dictionary, but M. cites it without asterisk or comment. [MORE: FHV 508] {M. 1974b: 201 n. 94.} {*Bimana has an asterisk in M. 1977a: 508, and in M. 1974b: 201, at least according to Trask’s English version (fn. 77).}
bigantxa (B G HN LN Z R), bigaintxa (old G), migatsa (L) n. ‘ten-month-old heifer’. 1745, ca. 1800. + -txa dimin. (see ****) {Not in The Dictionary.}. The old G variant probably represents the intermediate form *bigãe for the base word.

biguin (G L) (1745, ca. 1760), biguiñ (G), biguñ (G), bigun (B G LN) (1596), bihun (LN) a. ‘soft’, ‘gentle’.
OUO. The first variant appears to be the conservative form, but LN bihun (according to AT also biun, not elsewhere confirmed) is difficult. Lh. cites bihun only in the sense of ‘compassionate’, not elsewhere confirmed. Lh. proposes an etymology from *bihotz on



142 R. L. Trask

OUO, but possibly a palatalized form of bizi ‘alive’ (M. ****). Variant pitxi perhaps by P11. Very likely a nursery word in origin, but some modern senses are no longer nursery words. This item serves very commonly as a stem in expressive formations.
-bitxi (B L) Suffix meaning ‘god-’ in kinship terms, as in aitabitxi ‘godfather’. Possibly calqued on Rom. formations like Fr. beaupère ‘godfather’.

Only mitxeleta (1745) is recorded before the 20th cent. and the now predominant form tximeleta is nowhere recorded before 1912. M. (1977a: 520) prefers to see the forms containing /m/ as derived from the personal name Mitxel ‘Mike’ and hence as unrelated to the other variants; this is quite possible.

bixtika (L LN) (1692), bixiga (Sout) (1562), pixika (HN), pisika (HN), puxika (B) (18th cent.), puxiga (old B), bisiga (HN) n. ‘bladder’ (anat.), ‘boil’ (on the skin). [IMPORTANT: FHV 78]
From Late Lat. vessīcam ‘bladder’ (M. ****{1961a: 78}), variant of classical vēsīcam. The rounded vowel of the B variant has Rom. parallels, as in Arag. vo(i)xiga, vuixiga (CP s.v. vejiga). See CP for a survey of Rom. forms of this widespread word.
bizar (c.) n. ‘beard’, TS ‘beard’ (of certain fish and certain cereals), TS (LN R) ‘chin’, TS (L) ‘edge of a knife’. 15th cent.
OUO. Conceivably contains *-ar, hypothetical collective suffix. The word is not related to Cast. bizarro ‘gallant, brave’ or to Fr. and English bizarre. The origin of these words in Bq. bizar was suggested by the Basque writer Baltásar de Etxabe in 1607; this was later picked up by Friedrich Di, who popularized this etymology, which as a result is presented as gospel in a number of reference works. But more recent investigation has demonstrated beyond dispute that the Spanish, French and English words are borrowed from Italian, in which the word occurs earlier by centuries than anywhere else (it even occurs in Dante); see CP (s.v. bizarro) for the details.
bizardun (c.) n., a. ‘bearded (person)’. 1562. + -dun ‘having’ (see *edun).
pixar (G) n. ****{‘strand, wisp’} [FHV 241]
bizi (c.) a. ‘alive, living’, n. ‘life’, TS a. ‘lively’, ‘mobile, moving’, ‘running’ (of water). CF biz-. 1545.

biztanle (EB) n. ‘inhabitant’. 1745, 1847. A neologism coined by Larramendi in his 1745 dictionary, of opaque formation, though the final syllable must be intended to represent -le, agentive NFS. The word is not recorded before Larramendi, and it is not recorded again until the works of the writer Iztueta, who was a formidable user of Larramendi’s neologisms. It is absent from Azkue’s 1905 dictionary and from Lhande’s 1926 dictionary, and it hardly occurs anywhere before the 20th cent. Taking the word to be popular, Corominas (****{AT s.v.}) proposes a derivation from Cast. habitante id., along the lines of *abitante > *bitante > *biztanle, with two folk-etymologies, but the historical record makes this piece of ingenuity unnecessary.
biztu (B HN LN R) (1571), piztu (G HN LN L) (1545), phiztü (Z) vt. ‘light, kindle, ignite’, ‘revive, resuscitate’, ‘conceive’ (a child), TS ‘arouse, excite’ (sexually), ‘make (a penis) erect’, vi. ‘germinate’ (of plants), ‘turn sour, go off’ (of fermented drinks). + -tu VFS. Second form by P**{11}.

bonet (LN), bunet (Z) n. ‘hat, cap’ (1657), ‘beret’ (ca. 1760).
From some Rom. development of med. Lat. abonnem ‘cap’, akin to Fr. bonnet ‘bonnet’. Z form by P71. Mod. Cast. Cat. Port. boina ‘beret’ is widely thought to derive from an unrecorded Bq. development of this Rom. word; CP (s.v.) propose an old Cast. or Arag. *boñe, leading to a Basque *boina, by P**{32}, borrowed into Rom. and then lost in Bq. Cp also note that several Basque writers conclude that the beret was not widely worn in the Spanish Basque Country until the time of the First Carlist War, in the 1830s. See also kapela.
borda n. (old L old LN) ‘shepherd’s hut’, (B G LN R) ‘sheepfold’, ‘corral’, ‘stable’, TS (L LN Z) ‘farmhouse’. 1571.
From Occ. {[}borde{]}, bòrda ‘hut’, ‘covered sheepfold’, ‘stable’, also ‘farmhouse’ in places (Unamuno ****{1893: 142}), a word variously suspected of being of Germanic or Celtic origin, and widespread in Gallo-Romance (and also in Ibero-Romance, perhaps by diffusion). In the 17th and 18th centuries, growing population forced the French Basques to convert high pastures into new farms; the existing shepherd’s huts served as the nuclei of new farmhouses, and the name was transferred.
bordalde (L), bordalte (Z) n. ‘tenant farm’. 1873. + alde ‘side’ {(see *al-)}.

Etymological Dictionary of Basque 151
d- (or possibly da-) (c.) Present-tense prefix in finite verb-forms, as in dator ‘he/she/it is coming’ and du ‘he/she/it has’. Now fossilized.
OUO. It is likely, though not certain, that the prefix is d- rather than da-, since we find d- alone in forms like ****{diraki ‘boils’}, and -a- alone in forms like nator ‘I’m coming’. De Rijk (****{1992}) makes an interesting case for an origin in an ancient morpheme *da- meaning ‘the present moment’, but a difficulty is that no Pre-Basque lexical stem ever begins with /d/. This prefix occurs only in present-tense verb-forms which have no first- or second-person agreement prefix. Consequently, it was long taken (wrongly) as a third-person agreement marker, in spite of the obvious difficulties that it appears only in present-tense forms and that it appears even when no third-person absolutive NP is present in the sentence at any level of representation, as in diraki ‘boils’ (intransitive with transitive morphology; the subject stands in the ergative case, which is agreed with by a suffix, not by a prefix). See {Oregi Aranburu} (****{1974}) and Trask (****{1977}) for the demonstration that this is a present-tense suf{pre}fix. {Also Trask 1997: 218-226.}
d- Initial element in surnames.
From Rom. de ‘of’. Esp. in the French Basque Country, this element is often fused to Bq. surnames, producing variants like Duarte (common Uharte, Ugarte) and Daguerre (common Agerre, Agirre). The very first Basque writer, whose name was Etxepare, signed himself Dechepare.
-da-, -t (c.) first-singular agreement suffix in finite verb-forms.
The original form is *-da. This is reduced to -t when word-final, by P40, but remains as -da- when another suffix follows, producing alternations like dut ‘I have it’ (from *duda), but relative form dudan ‘which I have’, with relative suffix -n. A few varieties of B have reanalysed the alternation, producing forms like dot ‘I have it’, relative form doten. OUO, but clearly not related to ni ‘I, me’, which provides the agreement prefix n-. Possibly a remnant of an ancient stem-alternation in the pronoun? Compare *-ga.
-da Suffix in surnames.
This suffix occurs in a few surnames, like Larrinda and Legarda. It is of unknown origin and significance. M. (****{1973a: 78}) wonders whether Legarda might represent a variant of Legarreta, with the familiar suffix -eta, with Rom. mediation.
-dade, -tate, -date, -dare (c.) abstract NFS. From Lat. -tātem or from its Old Cast. continuation -dade. Since the predominantly eastern -tate seems to appear only in forms borrowed wholesale from Lat. in literary works, it is likely that -dade represents the earliest form to be borrowed as a functioning suffix.
daguenil or dagenil (old B) [hapax] 1596, dagonil (1897) n. ‘August’.
OUO. It is not clear whether the daguenil of the text is meant to represent daguenil or dagenil. The final element is surely il ‘month’ (see *iLe). M. (****{1970b: 90 n. 49}) suggests two possibilities. First, it may be *uda-go[i]-en-il ‘month of highest summer’, from uda ‘summer’ + goi ‘high’ + -en {[1]} superl. + il. Second, it may be *dagoen-il ‘the month which is’, ‘the current month’, from dagoen ‘which is’, from dago ‘it is’,

finite form of egon ‘be’, + -n [**{3}] relative. The first makes more sense, but M. protests against the unusual loss of initial /u/ and suggests that the gloss ‘August’ may be a misinterpretation of a half-understood proverb. The last form is an Aranist neologism.
daillu (LN R Z), dallu (?), daila (LN Z), dalla (LN Z), dalü (Z), dalu (LN), dali (?), tallu (S) n. ‘scythe’. 1666.
From various Rom. reflexes of Lat. daculum id. Some variants descend from a ProtoRom. *dailo ~ daLo {cf. Gasc. dalh ‘scythe blade’, ‘scythe’ Palay (1980)}, others from {Gasc.} Bearn. dalha.
damu (B G HN L LN Z R) n. ‘regret, contrition,’ (1545), ‘injury, damage’ (1643), ‘slur’ (1775), ‘pity’, ‘envy, jealousy’, ‘ill humour’, ‘prejudice’, a. ‘regrettable, deplorable’, ‘touchy, easily offended’.
From Lat. damnum ‘hurt, harm, damage, injury’, by L7 (M. 1961a: 348).
dantzatu (c. exc. Z), dantzátü (Z) vi. (traditionally), vitm. (often today in B G) ‘dance’. Stem dantza-. 1571.
From a Rom. source akin to Old Fr. dancier (modern danser), {Occ. dançar,} Cast. danzar (borrowed from Old Fr.) id., ult. OUO. Throughout most of the historical period, strictly vi., but in recent times commonly vitm. in B G, by assimilation to other verbs of this semantic class, including the verb dantza egin (below).

debeku (G HN LN S) (1636), debetu (old LN) (1571) n. ‘prohibition’.

debekatu (G HN L LN) (1643), debekau (B), debetatu (old LN), debetatü (Z) (1571), bedeka(t)u (B) vt. ‘prohibit’. + -tu VFS. B form by metathesis.

deithoratu (L), deithoratü (Z) vt., vitm. ‘mourn’, ‘offer condolences’. 1643.
From Rom. An Old Bearn. verb deytorar ‘mourn’ (mod. deitoura) is cited by Mistral (****{1879}), and an Old Bearn. derived noun deytoradores ‘mourners’ is cited from 1414 by Lespy and Raymond (1887). This must be the direct source of the Bq. verb (M. ****{1970a: 126 n. 60}). {It is possible that Mistral constructed the infinitive lemma “deitoura (rom. deytorar)” exclusively from the 1414 example of the noun deytoradores that he also cites.}
deithora (L LN Z), deithore (L LN Z) n. ‘lamentation’. 1571. Probably back-formed from the verb, since no such noun is attested in Occ.
deitu (B G L LN), deittu (B G), deithu (LN), déithü (Z), geitu (B) vt. or vid. ‘call’; TS ‘name’. Stem dei-. 1571.
From some Rom. development of Lat. dictum ‘said’, of the approximate form *[deico] (M. 1961a: 104). B form by dissimilation.
dei (c.) n. ‘call’. 1562. By back-formation (removal of -tu VFS).

dekuma (R A), tekuma (S), detxema (old LN), detxuma (old L) n. ‘tithe’. 1869. [CHECK: FHV 239, 421]
Second variant probably by P11. From Lat. decimam id., or, perhaps more likely, from an unrecorded variant *decumam (M. ****{1974b: 189}). {The variant decumam is classcial Latin; see Glare 1982.} Cf. Sardinian dékuma, déguma, Welsh degwn.

denbora (G HN L LN R A), denbó(r)a (Z), denpora (B), ténpra (R), tenbra (S) n. ‘time’ (in the general sense of ‘duration’), TS ‘weather’. 1545.
From Lat. tempora, pl. of tempus ‘time’ (the use of the pl. as a sg. was already common in classical Lat.) (M. 1961a: 353). R form by P38. The unexpected {, by P**{6}} /b/ in the Z form points to diffusion (M. 1961a: 230 fn. 10). The sense of ‘weather’ is uncommon and largely confined to Navarra and the north; it is perhaps calqued on the Rom. use of ‘time’ for ‘weather’. The archaic form of the word points to an early borrowing, but M. (****{1974b: 193, 201}) and others argue that the word is nevertheless probably borrowed from ecclesiastical Lat. in the Middle Ages. See aldi, eguraldi (under egun).
denda [1] (B G L LN) (1627), tenda (old LN) (1571) n. ‘shop, store’ (B G L LN), ‘tailor’s shop’ (old LN).
From late Lat. tenda{m} ‘shop’, by L1, or from some Rom. development of this. The eastern specialization to ‘tailor’s shop’ is interesting.
denda [2] (**) n. ‘tent’. 1627.
From late Lat. tenta{m} id., by L1, P6, or from a Rom. development of this.
dermio (HN) n. ****{end, limit’} [FHV 239, 546]
derrigor (B G) adv. ‘necessarily’, ‘forcibly’. Ca. 1920.
From Cast. de rigor ‘necessarily’.
derrigorrez (B G) adv. ‘necessarily’. + -z instr./advbl.
derrigortu (B G) vtd. ‘compel, oblige’. 1959. + -tu VFS.
des- (c.) ‘dis-’, word-forming prefix expressing separation, reversal or negation.
From Rom des- id., ult. from Lat. dis-. In spite of the general absence of prefixes in Bq., this one is recorded steadily in texts from 1562 on, and there are dozens of formations containing it. Some of these have been borrowed intact from Rom., but others have been coined within Basque, like desberdin ‘different’ from berdin ‘same’ (see ber-).
deskana (G) n. ****{‘faint’} [FHV 231]
destaña (B), erdeiñu (old LN **) n. ****{‘scorn, disdain’} [FHV 231, 294]

Etymological Dictionary of Basque 155
deus (L LN B G R), jeus (L LN), deüs (Z), dieus (R), daus (A) pron. ‘anything’ (in negatives and questions: NPI) (1545), TS (L LN) ‘thing’ (1627).
Obviously borrowed, but the source has been much discussed. By far the most persuasive proposal is that of M. (1977a: 519), who sees the source as Lat. genus ‘kind’, by P1. The Bq. forms suggest that the word was borrowed at a stage when the Rom.
palatalization had produced something like *[jenus], with the alien palatalized velar rendered variously into Bq.
deusdún (R) a. ‘well off, well-to-do’. **** + -dun ‘having’.
deus ez or deusez (L LN) pron. ‘nothing’. 1751. + ez ‘not’.
deuseztatu (**) vt. ‘destroy’, ‘annihilate’. 1785. + -ta- {not in The Dictionary} + -tu VFS.
deztatu (G L), eztatu (**) n. ‘a certain measure of land’ **** [FHV 252]
-di (**), -doi (**), -dui (**), -dei (B) Collective NFS usually added to plant names, as in elordi ‘hawthorn grove’, from elorri ‘hawthorn’, and arantzadi ‘cluster of thorn bushes’, from arantza ‘thorn’.
OUO. The conservative longer variants are confined to peripheral varieties, east and west, while the contracted form is usual in the central area. The contraction is confirmed by the place name (in Navarra) cited as Ezpelduia in 1056 and 1093, but modern Ezpeldia (ezpel ‘box tree’; see *ez-). This suffix is frequent in toponyms and in surnames, where it must be distinguished from variants of -ti [**{3}] and of -tegi {(see hegi)}. In a few surnames, the first element does not appear to be a plant name, as in Berridi (berri ‘new’) and Guridi (first element unknown). [FHV 107-108]
M. (1961a: 257–258) proposes that this suffix is in origin the same morpheme as the noun lohi ‘body’, and takes this as evidence that an original word-initial */d/ changed to /l/ at some early stage of the language.
This suffix was much favoured by the Basque nationalist Sabino Arana, who used it promiscuously as an all-purpose noun-forming suffix in his neologisms. Among his many coinages are ludi ‘world’ (lur ‘earth’), gaztedi ‘young people’ (gazte ‘young’), Euskadi ‘the Basque Country’ (euskara ‘Basque language’), and Euskaltzaindia ‘Basque Language Academy’ (euskara + -zain ‘guardian’; see zain [**{1}]).
digante (L LN) n. ‘giant’. ****
From Cast. gigante id., with unusual treatment of the initial consonant.
diru (c. exc. Z R), dihã́(r)ü (Z), dihauru (LN), deiru (R), déuri (R) n. ‘money’. 1562.
From Lat. dēnārium ‘denarius’, by P1 and P35. First R form by P52; second perhaps by metathesis (M. 1961a: 100). The semantic shift is Rom.: cf. Cast. dinero ‘money’.
dirualdi n. ‘time for payment’ (e.g., in a game or after a bet). 1745. + aldi ‘time’.
dirubide n. ‘way of earning money’. 1858. + bide ‘way’.

doilor, doillor, dollor (B Sout G L), dolor (L) n. ‘evil’, ‘ruin’, ‘grief, sorrow’, ‘fear’, a. ‘vile, treacherous, evil’. 1562. Perhaps also (B) doillior, dolior n. ‘person given to worrying’.
OUO, but, from its form, assuredly a borrowing (M. ****{1964a: 99}). The obvious choice of Rom. dolore ‘pain’ is made difficult by the presence in Bq. of dolore ‘pain’.
doinu (**), doñu (G HN), tonu (old LN) **** n. ‘tune, melody’. ****

dolare (HN L) (1321, 17th cent.), dolhare (Har.), dolhara (Har.), dolara (B G) (1596), tolare (G) (1083, 1745, 1808), tolara (B) (1802) n. ‘wine-press’.
From some Rom. reflex of Lat. torcularem id., of the approx. form *tor(c)lare (M. ****{1955c: 290}). M. dismisses Lat. dolarium ‘wine-cellar’, suggested by Rohlfs (****{1933: 340}).
domeka (B Sout), domeeka (old B) [hapax] n. ‘Sunday’. 1562.
From Lat. (diem) dominicam ‘(day) of the Lord’, by P1 (M. ****{1956c: 340}). The second form is recorded only in the 17th-cent. B catechism known as the Viva Jesús, where it occurs in the pl. form Domeecaac ‘the Sundays’. The personal name Domeca is common in Navarra from the 12th cent., always with a single <e> (M. 1961a: 112). See igande, under igan.
dominu (H.) n. ‘reliquary’, domiña, domiñu (?) n. ‘medal’.
From Old Cast. nómina ‘reliquaries on which are written the names of saints’, from Lat. nōmina ‘names’ (M.****{1959c: 527}), with irregular denasalization of initial /n/ by dissimilation.
done (c.) n. ‘saint’, a. ‘holy’. 1596 (but earlier as an element in toponyms).
From some Rom. development of Lat. domine, voc. of dominus ‘lord’, of the approximate form *domne, by L7 (M. ****{1961a: 348}). Common as a first element in habitation names, as in Donostia ‘San Sebastián’ and Donibane ‘St.-Jean’. Cf. deun, under deunga. {Not in The Dictionary.} ***** [FIX THIS: doe]
dorpe (**), thórpe (Z) **** [FHV 218] a. ‘awkward, clumsy’. ****
From Cast. torpe id.
dorre (HN L LN S) (1202, 1571), torre (B G LN R) (15th cent.), thorre (Z) n. ‘tower’.
From Rom. torre id. (M. ****{1956g: 93f.}).

From some Rom. source akin to Cast. tragacete **** (AT s.v.).
dündü (Z) a. ‘cloudy, gloomy, dark’ (of the sky), dundu (R) ‘blue’.
Expressive. The Z sense is probably conservative.
-dura (**), -duria (**), -duri (**) NFS [FHV 132]
durduri (G HN), urduri (B G HN?) a. ‘restless, nervous’, ‘lively, energetic, audacious’. 15th c.

Etymological Dictionary of Basque 159
e- [1] (c.) Prefix in non-finite verb-forms.
OUO. This prefix occurs in all non-finite forms of all ancient verbs built on verbal roots. It is still present in hundreds of ancient verbs today, though it has sometimes developed to /i/, /j/ or zero, by P36. Examples: ekarri ‘bring’ (< e-karr-i), ikusi ‘see’ (< *e-kus-i), josi ‘sew’ (< *e-os-i), utzi ‘leave’ (< *e-utz-i). Since this is the only affix attached to the verbal root in the morphologically simplest form of an ancient verb, the so-called radical (ekar, ikus, jos and utz in our examples), since the radical is identical to the stem of such a verb, and since both the radical and the stem of a verb exhibit nominal properties, Trask (1990) concludes that this e- must have served to derive verbal nouns from verbal roots. In any case, the very presence of a grammatical prefix is surprising in Bq., which is generally exclusively suffixing. Even if Trask’s account of the function of this prefix is correct, its origin is still a great mystery.
e- [2] (c.) Prefix deriving indefinites from interrogatives.
OUO. This prefix is attached to any of a range of interrogative items to derive the corresponding indefinites with meanings corresponding to English items in ‘any-’, when these are negative polarity items. For example, zer ‘what?’ yields ezer ‘anything’, and nor ‘who?” yields *enor, historical iñor (and other variants) ‘anybody’. Nothing is known about its origin, and the presence of a grammatical prefix is again very surprising in a language that generally lacks prefixes. See no- and ze- for the forms containing e-.
-e {[1]} (c.) Genitive CS. **** [entry for B -e = -te?]
**** This -e is possibly attested in the med. documents. In 1125 we find Lope Jaun Ortire semea ‘the son of Lope Orti’, and in 1110 we find Orcire çorita, a name which in 1284 is written Orçiren çorita (M. 1977a: 504–505). But these might be only abbreviated graphies for -en.
{-e [2] (B) = -te Plural marker in verbs.}
-e- (c.) Phonological vowel with no morphological value.
In Bq., /e/ is the unmarked vowel, and, in both word-formation and inflection, a vowel /e/ is automatically inserted to break up any impermissible consonant clusters which arise. This process is so regular and frequent that the inserted /e/ is not expressly identified in the numerous formations containing it in this dictionary.
eausi (LN), ẽháũsi (Z), erauntsi (LN Z), eusi (old B), aausi (B), ausi (B), auxi (B?), adausi (old LN), iãunsi (R), ñaunsi (R), xausi (R?), aunsi (R), dausi (S) n. ‘barking’ (of a dog). ****
**** Looks like an old verb. Lh. suggests a variant erausi. Possibly related to erausi ‘murmur, gossip’? The nasalization in the Z R forms points to an original *ena-, by P1. AT (s.v. aausi) and Corominas (cited ibid.) suggest a link with saunka ‘braying’, but there seems little reason to see anything other than certain or possible onomatopoeia in both words.

CF (h)egal- (for the first two forms), (h)ega- (for the last three).
OUO. The variation in form exhibited is unique to this word, and it may be that the variants in /l/ contain a second morpheme (M. ****{1953d: 567}). The TS are mostly obvious, but note in particular the apparent development ‘wing’ > ‘edge’ > ‘hem’.
hegala hautsi (LN Z) ‘lose one’s virginity’. + hautsi ‘break’.
egan (B G), hegan (EB) adv. ‘flying’. 1745 (as egaan), 1747. + -n {[1]} locative {CS}: lit., ‘on wing’. The 1745 variant is curious.
egatz (B G LN), egats (G HN L LN Z) n. ‘long feathers’ (on a bird), ‘fin(s)’, ‘quill pen’. Apparently + hatz ‘finger’ (Campión ****{1900, 1902}), though the second variant is curious.
hegazkin n. ‘airplane’. 1911 (as egazki). Aranist neologism, with arbitrary suffix. The word is widely used.
egazti (B G), egaztin (HN L LN), erazki (HN), hegaxti (Z), hegasti (LN), hegaztina (LN) n. ‘bird’. 1571. The nature of the suffix is obscure. M. (1961a: 259) suggests -ki [**{3}] NFS, with dissimilation of /k/ to /t/ in most variants.

(G) magalak ‘skirts’ (of a garment). 1591. + ma- expressive syllable. The sense development ‘wing’ > ‘edge’ > ‘hem’ > ‘lap’ > ‘refuge’ is straightforward, and largely parallelled by Cast. regazo ‘lap’, from old Cast. regazar ‘tuck up one’s skirts’. It is curious that no variant *mago appears to be recorded, only magal being found even in the varieties in which the base word is ega or ego.

egia (c.) n. ‘truth’. 16th cent.
OUO. The hiatus /ia/ is unusual, and may point to a lost consonant: *egiCa, possibly *egina, by P1. But there is no evidence for such a form.

The second element is lehor ‘dry’ (M. 1961a: 197). The first is obscure. It cannot be egin ‘make’ directly, since such a formation would be impossible, but it might be a derivative of this verb.

Probably from *e-gin-i or *e-giN-i. This common verb serves in B as the auxiliary for non-indicative periphrastic forms of transitive verbs, alongside the *ezan of other varieties. It is also exceedingly common as the verbal element of compound verbs: barre ‘laughter’, barre egin ‘laugh’. Such compound verbs are usually vitm.

OUO, and much discussed. The form (h)ego could perfectly well be native, but the forms with an additional vowel look less native, and the word is widely suspected of being borrowed. A Rom. source is not obvious, but perhaps the most interesting suggestion is that of ****{Schuchardt 1906a: 54}, who propose{s} Occ. eigau, Bearn.
agau ‘south wind bringing rain’, from Lat. aqualem ‘watery’. Certainly the Bq. names of the compass points are not in general ancient, and common mendebal ‘west’ is unquestionably derived from a Rom. name of a wind, while native ipar ‘north’ is also possibly derived from the name of a wind, so the etymology proposed here is plausible in principle. And it may be interesting that our earliest texts use the word only for ‘south wind’, though this could be an accident of recording. As for the odd-looking source in a word meaning ‘watery’, it is true that the south wind is wet in the Pyrenees, and indeed the Basques have a proverb: Hegoak hegala urean du ‘The south wind has a wing in the water.’ The frequently proposed link with egun ‘day’ is supported by no evidence, and looks unlikely.

egun (c. exc. Z), égün (Z) n. ‘day’, (L LN Z HN G old B) adv. ‘today’, egu (A) adv. ‘today’. CF egur-, egu-. 14th c.
OUO. CF by W10. Often reduced to -en or -un, by W19, when a final element in a compound. The sense of ‘today’ survives in the east; in the west, this sense has been taken over by gaur, originally ‘tonight’ (see gau). A uniquely contrasts egun ‘day’ with egu ‘today’. Knörr (1990, 2001) suggests an original noun *egu, with the final /n/ resulting from incorporation of -n {[1]} locative {CS}. Barandiarán (1972) suggests an original sense of ‘sun’, ‘light’, which is possible but beyond checking. See also eguriki. [FHV 138 fn]

OUO. Presumably connected somehow with ni ‘I, me’, but the formal relation is wholly opaque. This must represent a remnant of some very ancient state of affairs in the pronominal system, perhaps a stem-alternation.

and P**{35.4}. {From original ainhara entry:} Last {four} variants from a remarkable metathesized form *eLane (M. ****{1961a: 326}), by P1, P23. S form by P**{14.} These forms are related by a double metathesis: metathesis of nasal and liquid, and metathesis of the fortis/lenis contrast. This is undoubtedly correct, though perhaps the original forms should rather be *aiNala and *aiLana.
txenada (G), txenara (G), n. ‘swallow’ (zool.). **** Possibly a dimin. of the above, by M**{9}, but M. (1977a: 511) suggests a compound whose first element is etxe ‘house’, with exceptional loss of the initial vowel.

A mysterious word. Although it and its derivatives are frequent in the modern language, and although the considerable variation points to a word of some age, there is no trace of the word before 1858. We may cautiously suppose that the cluster /np/ is original, with common /nb/ by P**{6}. M. (1961a: 296) concludes that initial /k/ is original, with initial /z/ resulting from back-formation from an unrecorded diminutive of the approx. form *txonbor. Common initial zero would then result from P**{14}. Initial /k/ shows a word of no antiquity, very likely of expressive origin.

(****{1961a: 83 fn. 22}) takes seriously the idea that the word is a derivative of ohore, in which case initial /e/ must result from assimilation to the common verbal pattern e-Root-i, and the element -tz- is inexplicable.

Etymological Dictionary of Basque 173
is a simple transitive, while the causative of a transitive verb is a ditransitive verb with a dative object representing the person caused to do something. This was surely once an independent verb, but it not recorded as such. Not infrequently, this suffix is added to a non-verbal stem. Examples: ****. Very likely the source verb *erazi is itself a causative in -ra- from a lost simple verb. Variants with initial /a/ probably by W2.2; variants with final /o/ probably by M12.

OUO. CF by W1, W**{12}. This word is everywhere applied to the local Romance speech: Occitan, Spanish or French. The second element is -ara ~ -era ‘way, manner’ (see era). One proposal for the first element is erdi ‘half’ (****{M. 1968c: 196}), thus something like ‘half language’, but this item’s CF is normally ert-. Another is erdu ‘come’, thus something like ‘language of the newcomers’, but this strictly B form appears to be only a late and secondary local development of common heldu ‘arrive’.

One of several playful names for the creature, and perhaps a rough calque on Cast. comadreja id. The /b/ probably by dissimilation, though perhaps also by contamination from erbi ‘hare’. The med.

erika (B) n. ‘heather’ (bot.) (Calluna vulgaris). 1905.
From Lat. erīcam id., of Greek origin. The appearance of this word in vernacular Bq. is astonishing: the word was, by all accounts, rare and elevated in Lat., and it is scarcely recorded in Rom. Yet A. (1905) reports the Bq. word as in everyday use just a few miles from his birthplace.

M. (1977a: 526) proposes that this is merely a specialization of the participle of ero [2], literally ‘killed’. M. draws attention to Italian matto ‘crazy’, related to Cast. matar ‘kill’. But the parallel is not strong: CP (s.v. matar) cite Lat. mattus ‘stupid’ as the ult. source,
and derive an unrecorded Lat. verb *mattare from this. Moreover, the Cast. verb meant only ‘wound’ in the med. period. {Error here. Old Cast. matar meant ‘kill’ as well as ‘strike’ from the earliest texts.}

hertsi (L LN Z) (1545), ertsi (L LN Z HN), hersi (LN Z), hetsi (L LN), hesi (L LN Z), ertxi (HN), itsi (old B Sout) (1653), itxi (B G) (1656), etxi (?) (1610) vt. ‘squeeze, compress, tighten’, ‘narrow’, ‘close’, vi. (L LN Z) ‘approach’, TS (Z) vi. ‘cling, stick’, a. (not B G) ‘tight, narrow’ (1571), TS (LN Z) ‘tenacious’. Stem (h)e(r)(t)s-.
OUO. The conservative form is *(h)ertsi, apparently containing a non-verbal root. The B G form has apparently developed by two routes: *ertsi > *ertxi (by P**{?}) > etxi > itxi (by P**{62}) and *ertsi > *etsi > itsi > itxi. It is not clear whether the participle of a verb has been pressed into service as an adjective, or whether an original adjective has been pressed into service as the participle of a verb. But the apparently non-verbal nature of the stem favours the second. Leizarraga has ertsi verb but hersi adjective; Axular has hertsi for both. [FHV 563]
herstu (L) vi. ‘arrive’, erstu (R) vt. ‘squeeze, compress’, estu (B G Sout HN) (1562) a. ‘squeezed, compressed’, ‘restricted’, ‘narrow’, ‘rigorous, severe’, ‘tight’, TS ‘nervous, anxious, worried’, adv. ‘tightly’, TS ‘anxiously’. By transfer of the verb to the -tu class (M14). In this case, unusually, the adjective has also been shifted in form. [FHV 368]
estu(r)asun (B G) n. ‘predicament’. **** + -tasun NFS (see -tar).

ertz (**), eretz (LN), é(r)etz (Z) n. ****{‘side’, ‘edge’} [FHV 162, 416]
OUO. The common contracted form perhaps by W**{19}, from the word’s frequent occurrence as a final element in compounds like itsasertz ‘seacoast’.
hertze (**), ertze (**), herze (**), erze (**), este (**), érxe (Z R) **** n. ‘intestine’. **** [FHV 364]
{[}érxe (Z) **** **** [FHV 330] {] Duplicate, see hertze.}
esamina (**{B}) **** ‘examination’. **** [FHV 146]
esan (** Sout), erran (**), érran (Z) ****{vt.} ‘say’ **** Synth.
**** The variation in form exhibited here is unique to this word, and the origin is mysterious. A plausible guess is two resolutions of a unique cluster, perhaps *esran (*ersan would not work), which in turn might represent the syncope of a longer form along the lines of *eser(r)an. Southern (Landucci 1562) has only esan for the verb, as is usual in western varieties, but remarkably gives mezarrale for ‘priest’ – lit. ‘masssayer’, with the other variant of the word, and this even though the same source gives meza esan for ‘say mass’. The imperfective participle is L LN erraiten, Z erráiten, but HN LN also show the contracted form erten (M. 1961a: 398).

Seemingly formed from estali ‘cover’ + -pe ‘under’ (see behe), but in fact probably from Cast. estable ****, with metathesis and folk-etymology (M. ****{1957a: 14ff.}). {M. in fact mentions Old Cast. establia ‘stable’ as the source of Bq. establia, estalbi(a) ‘stable’ for which later estalbe, estalpe are folk-etymologized forms.}
estomak (** old LN), estumák (Z), estomake (R), estomaka (S) n. ‘stomach’ (anat.). ****
estrata (**), estarta (B) n. ‘road’. ****
From Lat. stratam id., with metathesis in the second form.
eta, ta (c.) conj. ‘and’. 15th cent.
Reduced form especially (but not only) after a vowel. OUO. A derivation from Lat. et ‘and’ has often been proposed, and is possible, especially since SOV languages often lack a word for ‘and’ and borrow one. A link with -eta looks improbable. Postposed in examples like aita (e)ta ‘Father and the rest’. [FHV 420 fn]
-ta (B G HN) Adverbial suffix attached to perfective participles, as in ikusi ‘seen’, ikusita ‘having (been) seen’. Often reinforced by gero ‘later’: ikusita gero. The unreduced form ikusi eta gero is well attested and still in use.

OUO. CF by W2.2. The conservative form is app. etse, with common etxe by expressive palatalization (M**{9}). B etze is either a back-formation or a written error from P21. HN itxe by P62. The CF etxa- is abundantly recorded in toponyms, even outside the Basque Country (M. 1961a: 127).

etxola (L LN Z), etxol (G HN), itxola (HN) n. 1630. ‘hut, cabin’. Probably from *etxaxola, by reduction, + txabola ‘hut’ (M. ****{1969c: 125 n. 32}).

ehun [1] (L LN), éhün (Z), eun (B Sout G HN), egun (B G HN S), ein (R) num. ‘100’. 1562.
OUO, but possibly from *enun, by P1. Fourth form by P35.1. Uhlenbeck (****{1910: 70}) suggests a Gothic *ain hund id. (phonetic [enhund]), which is phonologically excellent, but there exists no known instance of a Bq. word taken directly from Gothic or from any other Germanic language without Rom. mediation, and anyway I am told by Rémy Viredaz (p.c.) that the putative Gothic item is not attested. Moreover, it seems unlikely that the Basques would have borrowed such a word from Gothic but not from Lat., when mila ‘1000’ was taken from Lat. Anyway, relations between Basques and Visigoths were uniformly hostile, and it is not even clear that the Visigoths continued to speak Gothic for any length of time in Spain. Probably native.

L LN form by an unusual (and recent) metathesis; B G form by an unusual vowel change. Very likely from *euskala, given the CF. CF by W1. Much debated. The ending is almost certainly -(k)era, -(k)ara ‘way, manner’ (see era). The obscure first element has long been thought to represent the name of the Ausci, an Aquitanian tribe identified by the Romans, by P48: hence ‘to speak euskara’ would be ‘to speak in the manner of the Ausci’. But Irigoyen (1977, 1990b) argues instead for a lost verb *enautsi ‘say’, by P1, containing the dative-marker -ts-, in support of which he adduces a variant enusquera, used by two 16th-century B writers: hence ‘way of saying’. See -io-.
Euskadi n. ‘The Basque Country’ (conceived as a political unit), today the official name of the territory administered by the Basque Autonomous Government.

eusko- CF ‘Basque’. Neologism coined by Sabino Arana, who spelled it euzko-; a capriciously altered form of the CF euskal-. Today eusko- is much favoured as a CF meaning ‘(ethnically, historically or politically) Basque’, as opposed to euskal‘Basque-speaking’, ‘in the Basque language’. It is official in certain formations, such as Eusko Jaurlaritza ‘the Basque Government’.
euskotar (c.) n., a. ‘ethnic Basque’. 1909 (but 1897 as euzkotar). + -tar ethnonymic. Aranist neologism. This word is now commonly applied to a person of Basque ancestry born in the Basque Country, whether Basque-speaking or not.
euzk- Variant spelling used by the Basque nationalist Sabino Arana in the late 19th century for both traditional words and neologisms: euzkera, euzkeldun, Euzkadi, euzko, etc. From a fanciful relation with eguzkiko ‘of the sun’ (see egun). All of his neologisms are today respelled with eusk-.
ez (c.), ze (old B) prt. ‘not’, ‘no’.
**** The old B variant ze is used only with imperatives and subjunctives. M. (1961a: 422) proposes an earlier *eze, with differential syllable loss depending upon the accentuation of the following material.

*ez- n.? ‘tree’? Apparent stem of several tree-names, not recorded as an independent word.
OUO. This might conceivably be a reduced form of (h)aritz ‘tree, oak’, but the general instability of Bq. words for ‘tree’ may indicate a word now otherwise lost.
ezki (c.), ezku (B) n. ‘poplar’ , ‘black poplar’, ‘linden, lime tree’, ‘basswood’ (bot.) 1745, 1847. The precise designation of this name varies considerably from place to place. Final element obscure; possibly -ki [3] NFS?.
ezkur (B G HN LN), ezkür (Z), hezkur (L) n. ‘acorn’, also applied to certain other treefruits, such as the beechnut, ezkur (old B) ‘tree’. 1596. Final element obscure. The old B sense of ‘tree’ (in a proverb) is striking.

ezagun (often contracted to ezaun) (c.) a. ‘familiar’, ‘well-known’, ‘obvious’, TS n. ‘acquaintance’ (person). 1562. [REWRITE]
The Z form is presumably ?ezagün, by P69, but I cannot find this documented. It seems clear that this is the participle of an old verb, which has been fossilized as an adjective by M14, and that the verb has been shifted to the -tu class. See ezagutu below. [FHV 157 fn]

Stem ezagu-. 1545. It seems clear that the verb was originally *ezagun, with root -zagu[n]-, and that the verb has been transferred to the tu class by M14, leaving the old participle ezagun isolated as an adjective – though deverbal derivatives commonly show the stem ezagun-, not ezagu-.

ezpal (Sout G HN L LN Z R) (1562), ozpal (B), ozpel (B), zozpal (old B; R&S 483) (1596), zozpel (B) n. ‘chip of wood, splinter’.
Uncertain. Hubschmid (****1963: 24, 1965: 30-50) suggests Lat. *cuspellum ‘small point’, dimin. of cuspem ‘point’ and ancestral to Fr. copeau ‘wood shaving’, and M. (****1977a: 533) approves of this.

eztainu (EB), eztañu (R S), ezteinu (A), estainu (**), estañu (**), estáñü (Z) n. ‘tin’. Ca. 1620.
From Cast. estaño or a related Rom. form, ultimately from Lat. stannum. The presence of the palatalized nasal, plus the absence of a variant *eztanu, points clearly to a loan from Rom., not from Lat. But the absence of any Pre-Basque word for ‘tin’ seems unlikely, and we may suspect that the Rom. loan has displaced either an earlier loan from Lat., or a native word, or both.
eztañu-belar (HN) n. ‘foxtail, horsetail’ (bot.) (Equisetum hiemale). 1888. + belar ‘grass’. According to A. (1905), so called from the former practice of using it to scrub tin tableware.

OUO. The range of senses of this chiefly northern word is startling. The earliest recorded sense is ‘lap’, suggesting a possible link with altzo ‘lap’ {not in The Dictionary}.

*ganbo, *kanbo n. ? ‘hot spring, spa’ ?
Not recorded as an independent word, but seemingly reconstructible. There is a town in Lapurdi called Kanbo (Fr. Cambo-les-Bains), which has a celebrated hot spring. And there are several surnames containing this element, including Kanboa ~ Ganboa (Cast.
Camboa ~ Gamboa), Ganbarte (Fr. Gambart) and Kanboberri (Fr. Camboberry), among others. The variants with initial /k/ point clearly to a loan word, but no good Rom. source exists. M. (1973**{a: 91-92}) diffidently suggests either Lat. campus ‘field’ or a Celtic *cambos ‘curve’, attested in Gaulish toponyms like Cambodunum and Camboritum, and ancestral to Irish, Breton camm, Welsh, Cornish cam ‘curve’. CP (s.v. cama II) note a document of 1211 from Buñuel with the startling graphy in cambo novo for Lat. in campo novo ‘in the new field’, and cautiously suggest interference from the Celtic word. All these suggestions imply that the name of Kanbo was given for other reasons, and that the sense of ‘hot spring’ arose from the presence in Kanbo of such a spring.
ganbour (HN) n. ‘sulphurous water’. + ur ‘water’.
ganga (L LN S.P.) n. ‘vault’ (19th c.?), TS ‘sky, heavens’ (lit.), TS (L) ‘palate’ (anat.) (1664), TS ‘la cahuette’ (see below), TS ‘cupola’ (1925).
From Rom. canga, of various senses (CP s.v. canga). CP derive the word from a Celtic source meaning ‘curved’. The word occurs widely in the Iberian Peninsula with a startling variety of senses: ‘yoke’, ‘yoking of two animals’, ‘collar for an animal’, ‘handbarrow’, ‘type of plough’ and ‘narrow mountain pass’, at least.
The sense of ‘palate’ is the earliest recorded, though this is unquestionably secondary. Both Duvoisin and Azkue state expressly that ‘palate’ is more usually the compound ahoganga ‘mouth-vault’ (see under aho, and see also there the numerous compounds of the same type for ‘palate’), and they therefore imply that ganga alone for ‘palate’ is no more than an occasional reduction.
The 17th-c. lexicographer Pouvreau provides a mysterious entry: Ganga eroria la cahuette. Ganga erori zait. The first phrase is ‘fallen ganga’, glossed with the unidentifiable French word cahuette. The second example is a sentence: ‘My ganga has fallen down.’ It seems impossible to make any sense of this. Azkue (1905) takes cahuette as an error for cahute ‘hut, shack’, and so glosses ganga, but according to



198 R. L. Trask
Pouvreau a cahuette, whatever it is, is not a ganga but a fallen ganga. The writer J. B. Archu took cahuette instead as an error for luette ‘uvula’, which seems indefensible.

gar (B HN LN Z R) (1545), kar (LN), khar (L LN) (1617) n. ‘flame’, TS ‘fervour, zeal’, TS ‘heat, rut’ (of a female animal), TS ‘anxiety’.
OUO. The variants with /k/ are utterly mysterious. One possibility is that a devoiced variant *-kar of gar, arising regularly when this word is the second element of a compound, or a devoiced variant *kar-, arising by P11 when a voiceless obstruent follows in word-formation, might have been extended to the independent word, but evidence to support this suggestion is at best sparse. See also lama.
garmendi n. ‘volcano’. 1857. + mendi ‘mountain’. The word is chiefly literary, rather than popular. This is hardly surprising: there have been no active volcanoes anywhere near the Basque Country since modern humans settled the area. But seemingly contradicting the neologistic nature of the word is the widespread presence of a surname Garmendia since the medieval period. M. (1973**{a: 92} : s.v. gar) considers the possibility that this might represent only a syncopated form of another surname, Garramendia, not related to gar, but also notes the parallelism offered by another surname, Sumendiaga (see sumendi, under su).
gartu (c.) vi. ‘burst into flame’, TS ‘become zealous’, vt. ‘set alight’. Apparently + -tu VFS. But Charenc{e}y (****) notes a hapax gahar(tu) ‘burst into flame’, which must derive from gar + hartu ‘take’: lit., ‘take flame’. Perhaps the modern verb derives from both sources. Oddly, the expected northern variant *k(h)artu is not reported in any of my sources, all of which report only gartu even in the varieties having k(h)ar for the noun – even though the development of gartu to *k(h)artu not only would be unremarkable, by P11, but would provide an obvious source for the form k(h)ar.
*gara n.? Hypothetical stem, meaning something like ‘height’, ‘high place’, not attested as an independent word, but present in several derivatives. In some cases, it appears to denote something like ‘head’ or ‘skull’. It sometimes shows the irregular combining form gar-. This element is frequent in surnames, such as Garate and Azkarate, and it is possibly present in several opaque toponyms, like Bergara in Gipuzkoa. The reconstructed form should perhaps be *gala, by P22. M. (1973{a}; s.v.) notes that the town in Alava today called Vírgala in Spanish appears as Birgara in the Reja de San

garai (c.), gara (B) a. ‘high’, n. ‘height’. 1571. + -i {[1]}AFS. B form perhaps by an unusual application of P51. The nominal use is largely confined to the literary language, and probably represents a nominalization of the adjective.
garate (Z) n. ‘mountain pass’. + ate ‘door’. Though not found outside Z in the historical period, this word is the obvious source of the common Spanish Basque surname Garate. M. (1973{a}; s.v. gara) notes the following passage from the Bizkaian writer Iturriza in 1418: “...é seyendo garate desde el bado de Vzabal fasta Arguenaen, ...é con el dicho apeamiento, é garate, é todo la ganancia...” ‘and being garate from the ford of Uzabal as far as Arguenaen,...and with the said boundaries, and garate, and all the earnings...’ All this suggests that garate was once widespread in the language, since Z and B represent the eastern and western extremities of the language. But M. (1973{a}: s.v. gar) notes that garate might derive directly from garai (above), rather than directly from *gara.

garagardo (1896), garardo (1896), gararno (1745), garardao (ca. 1800) n. ‘beer’. + ardo (and variants) ‘wine’, ‘fermented beverage’. Apparently a Larramendian neologism, but now widespread in the south.

204 R. L. Trask
garnur (L) ‘urine’. App. + ur ‘water’, though the form of the stem is puzzling, and the reality of this word (attested only in the 19th-cent. Romantic writer Chaho) must be doubted.
gero (c.) adv. ‘later’ (1545), TS n. ‘future’ (1643), TS prt. ‘really!’, ‘I can tell you!’, postposed to an utterance (ca. 1800).
OUO. Possibly contains -ro AdvFS {not in The Dictionary} (M. 1961a: 413 fn. 12); this seems preferable to the suggestion of Oregui (1950) of aro ‘age’. The nominal use is strictly literary. See also -z gero (under -z) and (e)ta gero (under eta).

The word is frequent in toponyms, and a toponym Kessalla in Alava, 1025.
getaria (G?) n. ‘watchtower from which smoke signals are sent’. 1745.

ginharreba (old LN), giñarraba (B), n. ‘father-in-law’. 1571.
OUO, but appears to contain arreba ‘sister of a man’, which is mysterious. Sarasola (1996; s.v. ginarreba) reports that the word is also attested as ‘mother-in-law’.
-ginarreba (c.), -giarreba (G) ‘-in-law’, in kinship terms; see examples under aita, ama. It is far from clear what has happened here, and it may be that the noun cited here as the headword represents merely an extraction of the suffix. If so, then the first element might be -gin ‘who makes’ (see egin), and the force of amaginarreba ‘mother-in-law’ would apparently be ‘sister who makes mother’.
giputz, kiputz (B) n., a. ‘Gipuzkoan’. 15th cent. Dimin. giputx, kiputx.
OUO. Second form by P11. The word looks like a back-formation from the province name, but M. (****{?1969b: 28}) suggests that the province name itself may consist of giputz + -goa collective NFS.

-goa, -go, -oa (c. exc. Z), -gúa (Z) Collective NFS.
OUO. The form -(g)oa predominates in older formations, while -go, apparently by M**{4}, predominates in more recent formations. The unusual hiatus suggests a lost consonant, and hence *-goCa. It is possible that this suffix is present in the three province names Gipuzkoa, Nafarroa and Zuberoa (M. ****{?1969b: 28}), and perhaps also in a few habitation names, like Ondarroa (ondar ‘sand’; the town has a sandy beach).

OUO, but conceivably connected with gorosti ‘holly’. The form of the word is highly anomalous, especially with that final /io/. Variants by P14.
gorosti (**) n. ‘holly’ (bot.) (****) ****
gorotz (c.) (1571), korotz (B Sout HN L LN) (1562), khorotz (LN Z), korotza (?) n. ‘dung’ (esp. of cows), ‘manure’.
OUO. The sparsely recorded variant korotza is probably conservative, with the common forms lacking the final /a/ by M4. The widespread fluctuation in the voicing of the initial
plosive (variants in // and /k/ are found side by side in many areas) points clearly to a loan word, by L2. CP (s.v. coroza) suggest a borrowing of Old Cast. croça ([krotsa]) ‘dun-coloured rustic cap or cloak’, from Lat. croceam ‘saffron-coloured’, from crocum ‘saffron’, by L8.2. CP draw attention to the former rustic practice of covering haystacks with a yellowish mixture of cow dung and hay to keep them dry, and propose that the word developed in Bq. from ‘dung used to cover a haystack’ to ‘dung’ in general. This proposal is very plausible, and phonologically perfect, and there exists no other plausible proposal. CP go on to suggest that Cast. coroza ‘conical cap’ and Old Cast. corocha ‘type of long coat’ may derive from the same source, perhaps via Bq. mediation to account for the unexpected forms.
gorotzil (Z) n. ‘November’. + -il ‘month’ (see *iLe). 1780. M. (****{1959c: 526}) notes the similarity in formation to Sard. kapudánni ‘September’. {??}

From Lat. corpus ‘body’ (M. 1961a: 51). The last form is puzzling, but may result from a cross between gorputz and Cast. cuerpo, or from a re-borrowing of Old Cast. *corpo.

gorroto *edun vt. ‘hate’. 1656. + *edun ‘have’.
gorta (B), korta (B) n. ‘stable, pen, corral’ (for animals), ‘public square’. 1745.

gudu (old B HN LN) n. ‘combat’. 1571.
OUO. The word means ‘combat’, and not ‘war’, as sometimes asserted. Attempts at seeing this as a loan from some Gothic or other continental Germanic word cognate with Old English guth, OHG gund-, ON gunnr ‘war, battle’ are dismissed by M. (****{1973c: 152}, ****{Michelena & Hoz 1974: 22 n. 1}), on the ground that all the relevant Germanic languages have an /n/ in the word, and that loss of /n/ before /d/ is unknown in Bq. Several people have pointed to an Ib. stem as a possible cognate, but the defective Ib. script does not allow us to determine whether that stem is *gudu-, *gutu-, *kudu- or *kutu-, and in any case its meaning is unknown.

Etymological Dictionary of Basque 215
hi (L LN Z), i (B G HN A S), yi (R) pron. ‘you’ (marked sg.). 1545.
OUO. It is clear that this was once the only second-singular pronoun in the language, but its function has in the historical period been almost wholly usurped by the formerly plural zu (q.v.). Today hi is confined to an extraordinarily limited range of functions. Though details vary somewhat from place to place, the general rules are roughly as follows. This pronoun is obligatory (1) between siblings, and (2) between close friends of the same sex and roughly the same age who grow up together. It is usual (3) in teasing or abusing people or animals. It is optional, but not especially usual, (4) in addressing children, one’s own or someone else’s, and (5) in certain styles of writing. It is never used in addressing an adult of the opposite sex, except a sibling (not even a lover or a spouse); it is never used in addressing animals (except when abusing them); it is never used in addressing a significantly older person (not even a parent); it is never used in addressing a person of markedly superior status; and it is never used in addressing God. In Bq., it is not usual to change from zu to hi for any reason at all. Hence it is possible to find a 70-year-old man who addresses his 55-year-old neighbour as hi but receives zu in return, because long ago a 20-year-old man chose to address his five-yearold neighbour with hi. [ESSAY ON CASE FORMS]

-i [1] (c.) AFS.
Long unproductive and fossilized, this suffix is still clearly visible in a few cases: gatz ‘salt’, gazi ‘salty’. Its presence is almost as clear in other cases: *gara ‘elevation’, garai ‘high’. It is probably also present in many other adjectives whose stems are no longer identifiable: gorri ‘red’, berri ‘new’, itsusi ‘ugly’, egarri ‘thirsty’, and others.
-i (c.) Suffix forming perfective participles of verbs. This is the suffix which derives perfective participles of ancient verbs built on verbal roots, as in ikusi ‘see’, ibili ‘be in motion’, etorri ‘come’ and egosi ‘cook’. It was formerly also used to derive the perfective participles of verbs from nouns and adjectives: hautsi ‘break, shatter’ (hauts ‘powder, dust’), aberatsi ‘get rich, enrich’ (aberats ‘rich’). In this function it has been entirely displaced by the suffix -tu, borrowed from Latin. In spite of the doubts of Lafon (1943), there seems no reason not to conclude that the participleforming suffix and the adjective-forming suffix have the same origin.

*iLe (c.) n. ‘moon’, ‘month’. Cf (h)ila-, (h)il-.
OUO. First CF by W2.2. This is the approximate form of the reconstruction, though the details are uncertain (M. ****{1961a: 411}). The item is not attested as an independent word, but is frequent in compounds. For ‘moon’, all varieties have the compound hilargi (below) or another word (****). For ‘month’, all varieties have hilabete (below). As a final element, the item usually appears as -il; see the month names in the English index. According to M. (1961a: 412), this variant has been extracted to serve as an independent word il in places, but I can find no confirmation of this, though M. cites a curious form illi from a manuscript of Oñate. This word cannot plausibly be related to hil ‘dead’.
hilabete (L LN Z), hilebete (old LN), hilebethe (old LN), ilabete (LN R), illabete (B G HN L), illebete (B G), illhabethe (old L) n. ‘month’. 1545. + bete ‘full’. The original sense must have been ‘full moon’. See ilbete below. The anomalous {second,} third {and sixth} form{s} either by analogy with the free forms or because the compound was not yet firmly bound.
hilargi (L LN Z), ilhargi (L LN Z), ilargi (HN L LN A S), illargi (B G), illergi (HN), irargi (B Sout HN), idargi (B) n. ‘moon’. 1545. + argi ‘light’. The original sense must have been ‘moonlight’. Last two forms by P**{?}, P**{17}.
iretargi (B) n. ‘moon’. + a second instance of argi. The development is *irargi-argi > *irart-argi by W1, W3 > *iratargi by dissimilatory loss of the second /r/ > iretargi by vowel-height assimilation (M. 1977a: 556).
ilaski (S) n. ‘moon’. Second element obscure. The sibilant is wrong for some kind of parallel with eguzki ‘sun’ (see egun). Note: the *ilazki of A. (1905) is an error.
ilbeltz (G HN), ilbaltz (B?) n. ‘January’. 1746. + beltz ‘black’ (see *bel). Second form not in A. (1905) but cited in Caro Baroja (1973: 76). See urtarril (under urte).
ilberri (G HN L S R), hilberri (L), ilbarri (B) n. ‘new moon’. 1745, ca. 1800. + berri ‘new’ {(see *berr-)}.

OUO, but apparently from *iLun, by P23. Possibly identical to Aq. ILUN(N)-, but we would have expected orthographic LL, though in fact LL is virtually non-existent in Aq., perhaps merely by orthographic convention. An element -ILDUN, (-)ILLUN , of unknown meaning, is frequent in Ib., and M. (1961a: 359) takes seriously the idea that this might be the same word. Bonaparte (cited in A. 1905; s.v. illun) proposes a source in *iLe ‘moon’, and this is considered not implausible by M. (****{1954a: 438f.}). The palatal nasal in the Sout form is mysterious.

The root of a defective verb with no non-finite forms. In modern work, esan ~ erran ‘say’ is often taken as its citation form, but this is an entirely different verb.

From Lat. episcopum, with various consonant alterations (M. 1961a: 64). In spite of its archaic aspect, M. (****{1974b: 201} Arb) sees the word as a medieval loan. Last two variants by contamination from aphez ‘priest’ (see apaiz).
ipuin (B G) (1745, 1785), ipoin (B G), ipui (?) (ca. 1740), ipoi (**), upuin (B), upoin (B), upin (B) n. ‘story, tale’. [FHV 76, 150]
OUO. At first glance, the B variants in u- look like examples of P**{65, for upin}, but M. (1961a: 76) takes seriously the idea that these forms are conservative, with variants in i- by P**{66}.
ipurdi (B G HN LN S), iphurdi (L) (1613), ipirdi (old B) (1596), epurdi (HN), eperdi (B), purdi (HN LN) n. ‘buttocks, arse’ (anat.). CF ipurt-, ipur-. ****
OUO. The conservative form is probably *epurdi, with the common forms by P37. Probably bimorphemic in origin. CF by W1, W3.
iphurbegi (H.) n. ‘anus’. + begi ‘eye’.
ipurbeltz (G) n. ‘black-arse’ (a common insult). + beltz ‘black’{(see *bel)}.
ip(h)urdiko (B G L LN) n. ‘smack on the arse’. + -ko NFS.
ipurkankar (G) n. ‘hindquarter, rump’. **** + kankar ****{(see zangar under zanko)} [FHV 367]
ipurñauska (**) ****{adv. ‘skipping, romping’} [FHV 367]
ipurterre (G) a. ‘impatient, restless’, ‘ill-tempered’. + erre ‘burnt’.
ipurtzulo (G), iphurtzilo (Duv.), ipurzilo (LN S), ipurtxulo (?) n. ‘anus’. 19th cent. + zulo ‘hole’. Probably much older than its late attestations suggest.
ipuru (G) (1745, 1905), epuru (G) (1930), unpuru (R), ünpü(r)ü (Z) n. ‘juniper’ (bot.) (Juniperus).
From Lat. jūniperum id. (M. ****{1954b: 131). R Z forms by P70. See orre.

From Lat. īram or Rom. ira id.

ira (**) n. ‘fern’.
****{OUO.}
iradallu (**) n. ‘****{sickle for cutting ferns’} [FHV 561]. + dallu ‘scythe’ {(see daillu)}.
irasail (**) n. ****{‘place where ferns grow’} [FHV 561]
iratze (**) n. ‘fern’. + -tze NFS (see -tza). [FHV 561]
iraleku (L) n. ‘place where fern grows’. + leku ‘place’, by P**{loss of sibilants before sonorants} (M. 1961a: 351). [FHV 561 queries this account {and suggests the more obvious ira + leku.}]
iraatsi, eratsi (old B) vt. ‘write’. 1802.
OUO. This appears to be a -ra- causative of a simpler verb, but there is no attestation of such a verb, nor any other attestation of this one outside of its two occurrences in Mogel’s Peru Abarka. See izkiri{b}atu, eskribitu.
idatzi vt. ‘write’. Stem ida(t)z-. Also formerly written iratsi, iratzi. Aranist neologism: arbitrary alteration of the preceding. 1894 (iratsi), 1902 (idatzi).
irabazi (c.), idabazi (HN LN), erabazi (old G), irapazi (old B, R&S 155) vt. ‘earn’ (money), ‘gain’ (an advantage), ‘win’ (a competition’ (all 1545), ‘defeat’ (an opponent) (1643), TS ‘deserve, merit’, TS (LN) ‘satisfy’. Stem irabaz-. Root -rabaz-. TS (c.) n. ‘gain, profit’ (1571), TS (c.?) ‘merit’, TS (B HN) ‘property’.
This looks like a -ra- causative, but no source verb is recorded, unless we take seriously ebatzi ‘resolve, settle’. The R&S has just one example of irapazi against four of irabazi. But old Z (Onsa) has derivatives irapaizteco and irapaizliac, against participle irabacia.
irabazle (**) n. ‘winner, victor’. 1745, ca. 1800. + -le Agent NFS.
iraitzi (old LN **), ireitzi (old LN **) ****{v. ‘throw’} [FHV 104]
hiraka (old LN **) n. ‘rheum’. ****
From Arag. biraka id. or a related Rom. form (M. 1961a: 209).
irakin (**), ****, iraakin (old B), erakin (old LN), he(r)áki (Z) vitm. ‘boil’. Synth. ****
The <aa> is retained in the synthetic forms used by the B writer Mogel, as in diraaquit ‘it boils’ (M. 1961: 114). This is almost certainly a -ra- causative of a lost simpler verb, and it must have undergone a shift in meaning while retaining its transitive morphology.
irakurri (c.), i(r)akurri (Z) vt. ‘read’. Stem irakurr-. Root -rakurr-. 15th cent.
OUO. The form looks for all the world like an old causative in -ra- of a simpler verb of the approximate form *ikurri, but no such verb is recorded, and it is far from obvious what it might have meant: for what sense of V might ‘cause to V’ yield ‘read’? [FHV 52 fn, 523]



Etymological Dictionary of Basque 229
ikurrin (c.) n. (originally) ‘flag’, (today) ‘Basque flag’. 1897. Aranist neologism, arrived at as follows. From irakurri, Arana extracted the hypothetical source verb *ikurri, and assigned to this the arbitrary meaning ‘signify’, on the ground that reading a text is causing it to mean something. From this he extracted a stem *ikurr-, to which he added a suffix *-in of his own devising. He intended the word to denote ‘flag’ in general, replacing the Cast. loan bandera in this function, but it quickly came to be applied specifically to the Basque flag, itself designed by Arana and originally intended only as the flag of Bizkaia. Outside Bq. the flag is commonly known by the name ikurriña, with the Bq. article attached and the usual B G palatalization of coronals after /i/ applied.
iratsi (HN), iraatsi (B) **** ‘stick, adhere’. ****{See erantsi; same item?}
**** Possibly a -ra- causative of itsatsi ‘stick’, via something like *iratsatsi, by P**{W13} (M. 1961a: 293).
irauli (**), iruli (B G), iralli (Z) ‘turn’ **** ****
OUO. The Z form from *iraili, by P**{69} (M. 1961a: 97).
iraun (**), i(r)áñ (Z), irain (R), irin (R) vitm. ‘last, endure’. 1545.
OUO. This looks like a causative in -ra- of a simpler verb, possibly egon ‘wait, stay, remain’: hence *e-ra-gon. The Z accentuation points in any case to a lost consonant, by P**{73}, and hence to something like *eraCun (M. 1961a: 151 fn 20).
irazi (**) **** ‘strain, filter’. ****
ireki (G LN), iriki (B G LN R), edeki (L LN), ideki (HN L LN S), idéki (Z), idiki (G R), iregi (Sout), irigi (old B) vt. ‘open’. Stem ireki- (and variants), also irek- (and variants). 1545.
OUO. Probably from *e-re-ki or *e-de-ki (can’t tell which, though forms with /r/ predominate in the early texts), with -ki [2], or, given the alternative stem, possibly from *e-rek-i or *e-dek-i. There seems to be no way of deciding. [REWRITE: FHV 82 fn. {19}] [much sorting] M. (1961a: 229) concludes that this verb has become much confused with edeki ‘remove’.
iretsi (G HNL LN Z), irentsi (G HN **), iruntsi (B), irauntsi (old B) [hapax] **** {‘swallow, devour’} [FHV 90]
hiri (L LN), hí(r)i (Z), iri (HN S R), uri (B G) n. ‘town’. 1545 (but see below).
From *ili, OUO, by P22. Last form by P65. The Romans reported a town called Iliberris in south-central Spain, and this name looks remarkably like a Bq. formation meaning ‘new town’ (berri ‘new’). But there is no other evidence for Bq. speech so far south, and we must suppose either coincidence or an undocumented settlement in this area by Basque emigrants. A second Iliberris (modern Elna) is recorded in ***{Rosselló (Pyrénées-Orientales) (Coromines 1995 s.v. Elna)}, which was almost certainly Basquespeaking until ****{The claim that Rosselló was ever Basque speaking is not supported by evidence other than this and a handful of other placenames.

place names with good Basque etymologies is found as far east as Cerdanya, but no further.} The form (h)uri is well recorded from the 11th cent. onward in the toponymy of Alava and the Rioja, while iri is equally well recorded from the 11th cent. in Navarra.
-iri, -ari NFS app. meaning ‘near’.
OUO. The form -iri, which appears to be original, is generally found only in toponyms and surnames, as in Mugairi (muga ‘boundary’), Mendiri (mendi ‘mountain’) and Zubiri(a) (zubi ‘bridge’), though see aldiri (under *al-) for a possible exception. The variant -ari, which occurs in lexical items, such as atari ‘doorway’ from ate ‘door’, seems to have arisen by reduction of the sequence *-a-iri when the base ended in /a/ (M. ****{1961a: 533}). [FHV 533]
irin (c. exc. B) (1562, 1571), urun (B Sout) (1562, 1596), írin (R), í(r)in (Z) n. ‘flour’.
OUO. Sout oddly has both forms. Second form perhaps by P65 followed by vowel assimilation, or perhaps both forms by assimilation of an original *urin or *irun. M. (1961a: 81) dismisses Lat. farīnam id. as a phonologically impossible source.
birrin (**) **** + birr- ‘twice’ (see bihur) (M. ****{1961a: 122, 411}).
irla (L LN) (1677), isla (B? G?) (ca. 1500) n. ‘island’.
From Cast. isla id.; first form with alteration of the alien cluster.
iro (B G) n. ****{‘tinder from the interior of a tree’} [Az.]
-iro- **** Aux root
irri (**) n. ‘laughter, smile’.
****{OUO.}
irri egin (**) vitm. ‘laugh, smile’. **** + egin ‘do’.
errigéi (Z) a. ‘ridiculous’. **** + -gei (see gai).
irten (Sout G) (1562), urten (B) (1596), erten (G) vi. (in G), vitm. (in B) ‘go out’.
OUO, and much discussed. The oddly varying vocalism suggests an original diphthong, perhaps *eurten (M. 1961a: 75), though note P65. Attributing the idea to Nils Holmer, M. (1977a: 479–480, ****{1972g: 90ff.}) considers the possibility that this verb derives from a verbal noun of eastern igorri ~ egorri ‘send’, with which it is geographically in complementary distribution. A verbal noun *igorten ~ *egorten of ordinary formation might, by P16, produce the required form *iurten ~ *eurten, but there are difficulties. First, the tense and aspect are wrong: igorten du ‘he sends it’ is present and imperfective, while irten da ~ urten dau ‘he has gone out’ is perfective (B dau = common du). Second, igorri is transitive and requires a transitive auxiliary, while irten is intransitive and takes an intransitive auxiliary; true, urten takes a transitive auxiliary in B and in G of Goierri, but this is widely thought to result from Rom. influence. M. diffidently suggests a possible “missing link” in a hypothetical reflexive *bere burua urten dau ‘he has sent himself out’.

Fossilized compound verb. Best guess is hitz ‘word’ + *edun ‘have’ (M. ****{1968d: 1433}). The variant *itxaro cited in some dictionaries appears to be a misunderstanding of the compound verb itxaro *edun cited below. See also eguriki.

-itz, -iz Toponymic suffix, also found in surnames, which are probably derived from toponyms. Examples: Aboitiz, Berriz, Gautegiz, Mandaluniz, Oloriz.
OUO, and much discussed. To begin with, it is highly likely that we are looking at more than one distinct suffix here (M. 1973{a}: 108–110). At least the following proposals are on the table. (1) This is a plural suffix *-itz, also present in hanitz ‘many, much’ (Lafon 1943 I: 530). (2) This is the familiar collective suffix -tza (Gárate ****{1931}: 446–447). (3) This is a Lat. genitive in -ici, representing an ending -icus used in personal names (Caro Baroja ****{1945}: 102–106). (4) This is the Cast. patronymic suffix -ez (Arana ****{1897}). (5) This is the Lat. ablative plural ending -is (Gorostiaga (****{1975}: 3, 66). Possibly also involved here is the patronymic suffix -iz. As M. (1973{a}: 109) remarks, all of this is very obscure.

it{s}asi (G) n. ‘cracking or chapping of the hands’, itzasi (G), itzautzi (G) ‘crack’. + hautsi ‘broken’ (M. 1961a: 283), by P**{W16}.

-iz, -itz Medieval patronymic suffix, ‘son of’, found in numerous patronymics, such as Ortiz ‘son of Orti (= Fortún)’, **** Long dead except where fossilized in surnames, such as Ortiz, and in toponyms, such as (perhaps) Biarritz, if Irigoyen (1990a: 71) is correct in seeing this name (Bearriz 1170, Beiarriz 1261) as a patronymic built on a personal name *Beiar ~ Biar (only the second form is directly attested).
M. (****) sees this as probably continuing the Lat. genitive suffix -is, and rejects the suggestion, made by many, that it is identical to the Cast. patronymic suffix -ez, as in

Sánchez and López. But nothing is certain, and in any case it is difficult to disentangle this suffix from the one or more other suffixes gathered here under the entry -itz.
izai (HN L R A), izei (HN S), izéi (R Z) n. ‘fir’ (bot.) (****) (also ‘black poplar’ in places). 1746, 1858.
OUO. The element is common in toponyms, which point to izei as the older variant, the earliest record being Içiçuloa (1307), modern Izeixiloa in Salazar. But there are several toponyms, like Eceiza, which, if they contain the same element, suggest a still earlier *ezei. In any case, Z and R have izéi, with final stress, pointing clearly to a lost consonant, by P73, and hence to *izeCi or *ezeCi (M. 1958a: 216, 1961a: 396).
izan (c.), ízan (Z), ixan (B), izen (old B) [hapax] vcop. ‘be’. Synth. 14th cent.
OUO. The verb is extremely irregular, and appears to exhibit suppletive stems. A plausible guess for the participle is *e-izan-i, by P36**{.1}. Second form by P43. Some local varieties of L G HN have moved it to the -tu class as izatu or izandu, by M14. It is used everywhere as the auxiliary in the indicative periphrastic forms of intransitive verbs. It also appears as the verbal element in a few intransitive compound verbs; see ari, bizi, laket, ***

den (L LN Z R HN G), dan (B G) pron., det. ‘all’. 1761. From *da-en, by P35.3, from da ‘is’, finite form, + -n [3] relative: hence ‘which is’.
dena, dana (c.) pron. ‘everything’. 1761. + -a article (see *har).
dena dela, dena den (c.) adv. ‘anyway’, ‘in any case’. 1800 + da ‘is’ (finite form of izan ‘be’) + -la or -n [2] complementizer. {i.e. -n [3] Relative.}
denak, danak (c.) pron. ‘everybody, everyone’. + -ak pl. article (see *har).
zen (L LN Z R HN), zan (B G HN) a. ‘late’, ‘deceased’. 1858. From zen ~ zen ‘was’, finite form, + -n [3] relative: hence ‘who was’.
izar (c.) n. ‘star’. 1545.
OUO. Possibly contains *-ar, hypothetical collective suffix.
izarrihitz (**) n. ‘dew’. **** + ihitz ‘frost’. [FHV 482]
*ize- Hypothetical stem of the following items. Like all kinship terms, both of these occur frequently without the article, as though they were proper names.
izeba (G HN LN S Z), izaba (L LN Z), izea (LN), izoa (HN L LN) n. ‘aunt’. 1657. + -ba kinship suffix. Loss of /b/ in some forms by P16. Second form by contamination from osaba ‘uncle’. The /o/ of the last form by rounding from the lost /b/ (M. ****{1969c: 118 n. 11}).
izeko (B G) n. ‘aunt’. Dimin. itxeko. 1596. + -ko NFS. M. (****{1969c: 120 n. 18}) suggests a reduction of *izeba-ko. The *izko of Arbelaiz (1978) is a typo.

As a rule, this verb and its causative never exhibit an affricate, being thus distinguished from atxiki ‘stick’, but the 17th-century Lapurdian writer Etxeberri of Ziburu regularly writes an affricate: berceari su datcheca ‘the other one burns’, suffre iratchaqui ‘burnt sulphur’ (M. 1961a: 286–287).

An m-reduplication. A. (1905) sees this as a derivative of hitz ‘word’, but this seems unlikely, since this word is not recorded in B.

**** Second form by P10.
jai (B G HN L), jei (Z), xei (R S A) n. ‘festival’, (L) ‘religious feast day’. 1596.
Uncertain. With its initial /j/, the word looks nothing like a native noun, and M. (****{1955c: 293}) proposes a borrowing from Occ. jai ‘happy’, ‘enjoyment’, noted by CP with approval. Variants by P48, P56.
jai alai n. ‘pelota’, ‘jai alai’, the Basque national game, a member of the squash family, esp. the form of it played with a long wicker basket strapped to each player’s hand and called cesta punta in Cast. Late 19th cent. + alai ‘merry’. A neologism proposed by the Romantic writer Serafín Baroja as an alternative to the established name pilota. Curiously, this name has been little used in Bq., though it has passed into Spanish and English.

word for ‘god’, but the cluster /nk/, by P6, points clearly to a late entry into the language, at least in this form. The popular derivation of English by jingo! from this word cannot be sustained; see the Oxford English Dictionary.

From *e-akin-i, OUO (M. 1961a: 408). This trisyllabic origin is probably the reason that this word is nowhere recorded with an aspirated /k/. Lafitte (****{1944: 280}) suggests a derivation from jan ‘eat’, somewhat parallel to the development of Lat. sapere ‘taste’ into Rom. verbs meaning ‘know’.

Even more extraordinary is the existence of the L LN imperfective participle johan, alongside the regular joaiten, producing a phonological and morphological contrast without parallel in the language.

Etymological Dictionary of Basque 245
-k [1] (c.) absolutive plural suffix.
OUO. Generally, speaking, this suffix occurs only in the absolutive case, and only in the several demonstrative stems (plus the plural article -ak, itself derived from the absolutive plural of the distal demonstrative *har). It is also often added pleonastically to the indefinite plural suffix -zu.
Since all oblique forms of the demonstrative stems exhibit an apparent plural marker of the form -e-, it has often been proposed that this -k derives from *-g, that the phonological vowel -e- was therefore automatically inserted before a following casesuffix, and that this *-g-, being often intervocalic, consequently dropped, leaving the -eas the sole marker of plurality. This is plausible, but not certain.
-k [2] (c.) ergative CS. 9th cent. [in the Emilian Glosses].
OUO. Since no other suffix can ever follow this one, there is no possibility of recovering an earlier form. Attempts at linking it to -ki [**{1}] or to -ka, both AdvFS, are unpersuasive and unsubstantiated. [FHV 117]
-ka (c.) AdvFS.

OUO, and very mysterious. This is virtually the only native and ancient lexical item beginning with /k/, and we may suspect a complex history. Very likely the widespread variant eke is conservative, and most varieties have undergone an irregular loss of the initial vowel. Such loss, while not normal, is certainly more appealing than the arbitrary addition of an initial /e/ in the two-syllable forms. Note that the definite form is often



Etymological Dictionary of Basque 249
keia in B G R, even though the free word is commonly reported as ke – though M. (1961a: 156) cites the base form in these varieties as kee. Surprisingly, M. (1961a: 255) sees kee as the conservative form, taking the view that initial /k/ was lost in general at some ancestral stage of the language but preserved in this word because of its supposedly “expressive” character. But this account is not persuasive, and it fails to explain the variants eke, ike. [REWRITE: EUSK] The CF kea- perhaps continues the variant kee, by W**{2.2}.

OUO, but apparently from a non-verbal stem. Common k(h)endu, with its initial /k/, is anomalous, and the variant ekendu is perhaps conservative, with loss of initial /e/ in
most varieties. Alternatively, the Pyrenean forms with initial // are possibly conservative, with /k/ perhaps then resulting from the application of P11 to original gentu. [FHV 156-157]
-keria (c.), -keri (B G), -eria (sporadic) NFS of vices.
Second form by M4. This suffix coexists with common -tarzun ~ -tasun ‘-ness’ (see -tar), but it is always preferred in deriving names for qualities seen as morally wrong or bad. When the stem is morally neutral, we get two derivatives: handi ‘great’; handitasun ‘greatness’; handikeria ‘boastfulness’, ‘conceit’. When the stem is morally bad, we get only a form in -keria: lizun ‘lewd, lascivious’; lizunkeria ‘lewdness, lasciviousness, depravity, filth’. Added to the name of a creature, the suffix derives the name of a bad quality associated with that creature: oilo ‘hen’, oilokeria ‘cowardice’.
There are two views. It was first proposed by Humboldt that this is the same element as eri ‘illness’ {cf. eri [1] ‘ill’}, by M**{2}; this is semantically good, but it suffers from the observation that the expected variant *eria is nowhere recorded for the noun. M. (1961a: 247) and Múgica (1978; s.v.) argue instead for a Rom. origin, noting that the common Cast. noun-forming suffix -ería sometimes gives rise to similar formations, as in Cast. porquería ‘filth, rubbish’, from puerco ‘pig’. This suffers from the observation that the variant -eria is rare and found only sporadically in a pejorative sense; anyway, Rom. -eria also occurs in Bq. as a seemingly distinct suffix (see -eria {not in The Dictionary}). Múgica also claims a variant *-teria, but his sole example of umeteria,



250 R. L. Trask

-ki [1] (c. exc. B) AdvFS forming adverbs of manner from adjectives. Examples: ederki ‘beautifully’ (eder ‘beautiful’); ongi ‘well’ (on ‘good’).
OUO. See also -to [2].
-ki- [2], -k-, -i- (c.) Dative flags: cluster of suffixes occurring in finite verb-forms, immediately after the verbal root and preceding a dative agreement-marker. Examples, all preceding -o, marker of third-singular dative: G dizkio ‘s/he has them to him/her’, B jako ‘it is to him/her’, G zaio ‘it is to him/her’.
OUO. It is not clear how many different suffixes are represented here, but both -ki- and
-i- can readily be derived from an original *-gi-, with loss of the // between vowels and
devoicing of // after a sibilant, followed by some redistribution of the resulting variants, an interpretation possibly favoured by the following entry. But -k- is harder to account for in this way. Azkue (1905) notes an apparent tendency in old B for -ki- to be used with intransitive verbs, while transitive verbs use -ts- for the same purpose. Old B may thus preserve remnants of an ancient functional distinction already lost in the earliest texts in other varieties. We might conceivably see these flags as resulting from the incorporation into the verb of either an ancient preposition or an ancient independent verb, but neither proposal sits well with the historical nature of Bq. as a head-final and exclusively postpositional language.
-ki (c. exc. B), -gi (B). Suffix apparently added to a verb-stem in order to allow the addition of a dative argument to the diathesis of that verb. There are some rather clear examples of this: egon ‘be (in a state)’ (a simple intransitive verb), egoki ‘fit, suit, correspond to’ (an intransitive verb taking a dative complement). Others can be readily reconstructed: *edun ‘have’ (a simple transitive verb), eduki ‘grasp, hold on to’ (a simple transitive verb today, but in early texts it takes its object in the dative). It is noteworthy that many verbs which apparently contain this suffix but which have no known simple verbs as sources take dative objects, such as the archaic izeki ‘burn’. Still other verbs taking dative objects appear both with and without -ki, such as jarrai(n) ~ jarraiki ‘follow’. The proposal here is that this suffix has been extracted from the dative flag discussed above: for example, egon acquired finite forms like dagokio ‘it corresponds to him/her/it’, from which a new lexical verb egoki was extracted by reanalysis. If so, the B variant -gi for this suffix would support the proposal in the last paragraph that the dative flag derives from *-gi-. The absence of a dative object with certain verbs in -ki, such as ebaki (B ebagi) ‘cut’, may be



Etymological Dictionary of Basque 251
explained by noting the existence of an attested variant epai, lacking the suffix, and assuming that the diathesis of the suffixed form changed from dative to simple transitive before the time of our earliest texts, parallel to the change in diathesis observed for eduki within the texts.
-ki [3] (c.) NFS forming concrete nouns. *****

-kizun, -izun (c.) NFS, AFS.
Fluctuation in form by M2. This suffix forms mainly nouns, esp. but not only from verbs, with a variety of mostly abstract senses, centring around ‘activity’. However, in L LN Z, it can be added to kinship terms to denote ‘step-’, as alabaizun ‘stepdaughter’, from alaba ‘daughter’. It also forms adjectives, mainly from verbs, usually in the sense of ‘-able’. The suffix is clearly compound in origin. The first element is presumably one of the suffixes -ki cited above, but we can’t tell which. The final element is {*}-zun.
-aizun (L LN Z R) AFS ‘false’. Extracted in error from formations like alabaizun ‘stepdaughter’ (M. 1961a: 250 fn. 43).
aizun (L) a. ‘false’. By extraction of the suffix (M**{3}).
-ko (c.) Syntactic suffix; also NFS.
OUO. This suffix is of enormous and central importance in Bq. syntax, and it also plays a role in word-formation. Syntactically, it can be added to virtually any adverbial, regardless of structure, to form a preposed adjectival modifier. Except in Z and R, it is voiced to -go after /n/ or /l/ by P6. In this function, the suffix is fully productive, and such modifiers can be created at will In the historical period, a locative ending -n or -an is suppressed before -ko, as is the /n/ of comitative -ekin (see kide), which is in fact the locative -n in origin. Examples: atzo ‘yesterday’, atzoko egunkaria ‘yesterday’s newspaper’; zirt edo zart ‘decisively’, zirt-edo-zarteko gizona ‘a decisive man’; Bilbon ‘in Bilbao’, Bilboko kaleak ‘the streets of Bilbao’; etxean ‘in the house’, etxeko teilatua ‘the roof of the house’; mendira ‘to the mountain’, mendirako bidea ‘the road to the mountain’; mendietan ‘in the mountains’, mendietako haitzuloak ‘the caves in the mountains’; non ‘where?’, nongo jendea ‘the people from where?’; gurekin ‘with us’, gurekiko neskak ‘the girls (who are/were) with us’; izarra agertu zitzaienean ‘when the star appeared to them’, izarra agertu zitzaieneko garaian ‘at the time when the star appeared to them’. But the ****{15th-century text in M. (1964b: §3.1.7, 32} exhibits the unique form barruangoak ‘those inside’, from barruan ‘inside’, locative of barru ‘interior’, with no suppression of the locative ending; the historical language requires barrukoak here. [ADD FHV 505–506: hetangoak etc.]



Etymological Dictionary of Basque 253
In a second function, -ko can be added to an N-bar, a nominal expression lacking a determiner, to create a preposed adjectival modifier. The N-bar must be at least two words long, and there are obscure semantic constraints. Examples: beso eder ‘beautiful arm’, beso ederreko pilotaria ‘a jai-alai player with a great arm’; bihotz on ‘good heart’, bihotz oneko neska ‘a girl with a good heart’. In certain cases the indefinite -ta- {(not in The Dictionary)} must be inserted: hiru urte ‘three years’, hiru urtetako umea ‘a threeyear-old child’. These cases differ from the preceding in that they have no adverbial source. In this function the suffix is also productive.
In a third function, -ko serves as a noun-forming suffix with various functions. Again the indefinite -ta- {(not in The Dictionary)} is sometimes required. A common function is ‘pertaining to’, ‘found at or near’. Examples: gerri ‘waist’, gerriko ‘belt’, ‘sash’; buru ‘head’, buruko or burko ‘cap’, ‘pillow’; belarri ‘ear’, belarritako ‘earring’. Another function is ‘blow (to)’. Example: ipurdi ‘buttocks’, ipurdiko ‘smack on the buttocks’. A third function, quite rare, is diminutive. Example: mando ‘mule’, mandako ‘little mule’. In this function the suffix is now only weakly productive at best.
The suffix has further functions when it follows certain other suffixes, notably the gerund suffixes -tze (see -tza) and -te {[2]}, the allative ending -ra, and the instr. ending -z; see those entries. See also the use of -ko as a future marker below. When -ko follows a suppressed locative ending, the resulting form appears to contain no suffix other than -ko, and such forms have traditionally been counted by Basque grammarians as constituting an additional and distinct nominal case-suffix, the “locative genitive”, but this analysis is historically wrong, and probably not synchronically advisable.
The Aq. suffix -C(C)O possibly represents this Bq. suffix.
Tovar (****, ****, ****{1954}) argues that Bq. -ko must share a common origin with PIE *-ko, a suffix with various functions, the most important of which was the formation
of lexical adjectives from nouns, as in Greek physikós ‘natural’ from physis ‘nature’ and in Latin civicus ‘civic’ from civis ‘city’. But this proposal faces huge difficulties. First, the functions of PIE *-ko are not very similar to those of Bq. -ko. Second, the suffix *ko is of PIE date, and it is almost impossible to see how an early form of Bq. could have been in intense contact with PIE.
-ko (c. exc. Z R) Future. In all but the eastern varieties, -ko is added to the perfective participle of a verb to derive the future (prospective) participle. In B and G, this is the only suffix so used, while in L and LN it exists alongside -en, which is used exclusively in the east. In these central varieties, -ko is used after a vowel and -en after a consonant. So from ikusi ‘see’ (perfective) the future participle is ikusiko in the west and the centre, but ikusiren in the east, while from egin ‘do’ the future participle is egingo in the west but eginen in the centre and the east. This regional variation suggests that the future participle must be a rather late formation.

kurilloe (B), kurloe (B), gurrigoi (HN), burrigoi (G), garraio (L), karrajo (L), kurroe (old L old G?) n. ‘sparrow’ (zool.) (****) (1802).
From Cast. gorrión id (M. ****{1955c: 293}), itself OUO. Variants in -goi by P35.1. Variant with initial /b/ by P10. First {two} variants possibly contaminated by kurlo [1] ‘crane’. An ultimate origin in Bq. gorri ‘red’ is proposed by Schuchardt (****{1906b}) but considered dubious by CP; see CP (s.v. gorrión) for an essay.

{First four forms} from Rom. *cusinu, by P1 (M. ****{1961: 123}). Fourth form
perhaps by extraction from the compound lehengusu (see lehen), where // appears by P6. The expected female form *kusina ~ *gusina is not recorded as an independent word but occurs in the compound lehengusiña (see lehen).

-la [2], -lan (c.) AdvFS
This suffix forms adverbs of manner from demonstrative and interrogative stems. OUO. Nobody has proposed a common origin with -la [1], for lack of a detectable semantic connection. But Gavel (RIEV 12: 211 ****{1920: 211}) suggests a possible link with the variant -la of the All. CS -ra. The origin of the nasal in the longer variant is unknown.

OUO. Third form by P35.1, but otherwise the variation in form is mysterious. However, it seems likely that the forms with /p/ represent a distinct word, perhaps a back-formation from txapar (below), and that lapar is a cross between the two words.
txapar (R) n. ‘kermes oak, evergreen oak’ (bot.) (Quercus coccifera), ‘scrub, brush, undergrowth’, txaparro (S) ‘scrub of evergreen oak or holm oak’. App. a dimin. of the above. [SEE CP; COMPLICATED]

From Lat. flammam, by L8.1. The curious L variants may result from an unusual resolution of Lat. /mm/, or from a hypercorrect reversal of P3. Unlike its native synonym gar (q.v.), this word has given rise to no derivatives, and it never appears in toponyms or surnames.
lama [2] (B G) n. ‘piece of iron for reinforcing a cartwheel’. ****

lantegi n. ‘workplace’, ‘factory’. 1745, 1759. + -tegi ‘place’ {(see hegi).}
lanabes (L B), lanabas (L), lanibes (H.) n. ‘tools, toolkit’. 1627. Obscure. The word does not look native, and attempts at relating it to lan ‘work’ are unconvincing. Most likely, it derives from the Romance ‘knife’ word represented by Castilian navaja ‘knife’, ultimately from Latin novaculam via an unrecorded variant *navacula. A possible source is the Old Bearnese cognate naves ‘(large) knife’, a back-formation obtained by removing the diminutive suffix. This is a hapax recorded in the Judyats de la Cort de Morlaas, one of the texts of the Fors of Béarn, though ML (***{§5965}) and CP (s.v. navaja) record the word as nabes. A hypothetical plural *las naves would be a phonologically perfect source for the Bq. word, with incorporation of the Rom. article, and its plural nature could account for the collective sense of the Bq. word. {See nabéla and variants.}
landa (**) n. ‘field, piece of land’, sometimes esp. one which is arable, **** TS p. [+ Abs, Part, Instr] ‘except, outside’. 1545.

lanjer (**) n. ‘danger’. **** [FHV 534]
lañeza (G) ****{‘bad upbringing, spoiling’} [FHV 200] {M. seems to mean that lañeza is derived from laño, or perhaps rather that both Cast. llano and its derivative llaneza suffer metathesis of palatalization in Bq. borrowings.}
laño (L LN) a. ****{‘frank, amiable’}
From Cast. llano ****{‘plain, frank’}, with metathesis of palatalization (M. 1961a: 200).

larru (G HN L LN R) (1545), lárrü (Z), narru (B Sout) (1562) n. ‘hide, skin, pelt’ (of an animal), ‘skin’ (of a person). CF larr-.
OUO. The last variant is curious; M. (****{1961a: 325}) suggests that it may have arisen by some phonological development when the word served as the second element in compounds. But M. rejects Uhlenbeck’s proposed *rarru. CF by W2.3.
larhárgi (Z) a. ‘clear-skinned’. **** + argi ‘bright’.

larunbat (G HN L LN), laurenbat (old B G), laranbate (old LN **) *** n. ‘Saturday’. ****
[FHV 95, 491, 501] Many have seen this as laurden ‘quarter’ (see lau [1]) + bat ‘one’, since Saturday completes the week, and a week is roughly one quarter of a month. But M. ****{(1971b),} (1977a: 491) cautiously suggests a derivative of lagun ‘companion’,



Etymological Dictionary of Basque 263
perhaps *lagunen bate ‘gathering of companions’, + -en {[1]} Gen. + a verbal noun from batu ‘get together’ (see bat). Cf. neskanegun (under neska).

****{OUO.} M. (1961a: 325) doubts that this word can be connected with ****{laxo}, of clear Rom. origin, and he notes that the presence of initial /n/ in the west and in the east suggests that this is the conservative form.

laztu (**) ****{vi. (of hair) ‘stand on end’, vt. ‘make (hair) stand on end’ Aul.}
lau [1] (c.), laur [tapped /r/] (L LN) num. ‘four’. 15th cent.
OUO. The form laur is original, since all varieties have laur- with vowel-initial suffixes, as in laurak ‘all four’. Common form by P25. Top. Laureiereta, Navarra 1174. Possibly recorded in Aq. LAURCO and LAURINA.
lauburu (c.) n. ‘Basque swastika’ (a traditional good-luck symbol resembling four commas joined at their points). 1745, 1818. + buru ‘head’. In the past, the word was sometimes strangely applied to the Christian cross. But attempts at linking it to Lat. labarum ‘banner of Constantine’ are absurd.

-le (c.), -ile (L LN B) NFS forming agent nouns from i-class and n-class verbs of any transitivity, though it is far more frequent with transitive verbs, and may once have been confined to these. Examples: erosi ‘buy’, stem eros-, erosle ‘buyer’; eman ‘give’, emale ~ emaile ‘donor’, joan ‘go’, joaile ‘traveller’.
OUO. Trask (1990) proposes that the variant -ile derives from reanalysis: after *emani ‘give’, for example, stem eman-, developed regularly to emai (attested), this emai- was taken as a stem, and the addition of -le yielded the observed emaile, then reanalysed as ema- + -ile. See also -tzaile (under -tza), -te [1].

From *leone, by P1, from Lat. leōnem id. Z forms by P71. The standard form lehoi is occasionally cited as L LN, but I find no evidence to substantiate this. The Sout form is recorded only as the definite leoya, which might represent either leoi or leoe.

lerden (c.) a. ‘straight’, ‘slender’. 1627; zerden (B G) a. ‘straight’, ‘erect’, ‘slender’, derden (R) a. ‘idle, negligent’.
Obscure. It is not clear that all three are the same word. M. (****{1970b: 69}) suggests that the final -den is a variant of the common AFS -din ‘resembling’ (see *edin). If so, then leher ‘pine tree’ looks plausible for the first element, though the absence of a variant *leherden is troubling. However, M. diffidently suggests instead dissimilation of an original *den-den, of obscure formation.
lerro (**) n. ‘line, row’. ****

Etymological Dictionary of Basque 273
m- A cover entry for a class of expressive formations. Among the numerous expressive formations in Bq., there exists a rather distinctive subset, with conspicuous phonological and semantic characteristics. Phonologically, the canonical form is two syllables, beginning with /m/, followed by one of /a o u/, followed by a velar or coronal plosive, followed by any vowel (though /i/ is rare), followed by a liquid. Semantically, the word is usually an adjective denoting a moral or physical defect, or sometimes a noun, often denoting some kind of hump, bump or projection. Canonical examples include makur ‘twisted’, motel ‘insipid’, makar ‘scrawny’, moker ‘hard’, and mukur ‘clumsy’. Often another consonant precedes the medial plosive, as in mozkor ‘drunk’, malgor ‘numb’, margul ‘faded’, and mazkor ‘empty’. Some words exhibit variation in form, like mutur ~ mustur ‘extremity, snout’. Quite a few words depart from this canonical pattern in one respect or another, and it is not always clear whether a given word should be included in this group or merely regarded as an expressive formation adhering to no particular pattern.
It is quite possible that some of the words in ma- may represent originally expressive variants of ordinary lexical items in which the expressive syllable ma- has replaced the original first syllable, but, when the original word is not recorded, we cannot tell this.
With only a handful of exceptions, each of these words is confined to a small area, and few are recorded before the 20th century. A list of these formations is gathered here for convenience; in all likelihood, there exist many others which have not so far been recorded. [SEE FHV 275-276]
magalo (LN) a. ‘weak’.
maiskar (G) a ‘vile, despicable’.
makal (B G HN), a. ‘weak’, ‘ill’, mekel (B) ‘weak’.
makar (B) a. ‘skinny’, ‘scrawny’.
maker (old B) a. ‘counterfeit’, ‘fake’, (HN?) a. ‘surly, disagreeable, rude’.
maket (B) n. ‘heavy club’.
makets (G) n. ‘deformed or defective thing’. M. (1961a: 272) suggests that this may be a ma- derivative of akats ‘nick, scratch’. {Cf. markets below.}
maketx (L G) a. ‘vile, despicable’.
makur (B G HN), makhur (L LN) a. ‘crooked, twisted, bent, curved’, TS ‘false’ (often esp. of a of a voice or manner), ‘mistaken, erroneous, wrong’, TS (old LN) ‘knockkneed’, TS (G HN) ‘mischievous’, ‘villainous’, TS (L HN B) ‘perverse’, TS (L LN HN) n. ‘adversity, obstacle’, TS (L HN) n. ‘disagreement’, ‘discord’. 1571. One of the most widespread of these words, and the earliest one attested. M. (1961a: 271–272) suggests that this is a ma- derivative of the stem represented by the verb gurtu ‘kneel, bow, revere’.
makurtu (**), makhurtu (**) ****{vti. ‘bend, incline’} [FHV 272]
malato (B) a. ‘sickly, ailing’.

malino, mali (LN S) a. ‘weak, feeble’.
malkar (G HN), malkhar (L), maldar (H.) n. ‘steep, rugged, barren terrain’. Last variant possibly contaminated by malda ‘slope’.
malkatx (G) a. ‘rugged, rough’.
malkor (HN G L) a. ‘sterile, barren’, (G HN) n. ‘precipice, cliff’, (HN) n. ‘boulder’, (HN) n. ‘hump, bump’. {See malkor ‘barren’ under elkor.}

maltzur (B G HN L) a. ‘sly, shifty, deceitful’.
malutz (B) a. ‘chubby, plump’, ‘fertile’ (of land).
mandil (HN) a. ‘lazy, good-for-nothing and spendthrift’. Possibly doesn’t belong here, since it departs from the usual pattern in form.
mangel (L?) a. ‘crippled, maimed’. Hapax. Bears a striking resemblance to maingu ‘crippled’, but cannot be derived from this in any known way. Perhaps an assimilation of the last word to the usual expressive pattern.
mangelo (G) a. ‘clumsy’.
mankarro (L) n. ‘very steep terrain’.
mantxar (G) n. ‘slowpoke, straggler’.
mantzar (G) n. ‘lazy and slatternly woman’.
mantzarda (B) n. ‘lazy and slatternly woman’. Possibly plus an otherwise unknown female suffix (A. 1905), or perhaps a Romance-style female form of the following item.
mantzardo (B) n. ‘insignificant man, milktoast’. + -do {NFS}?
mantzur (HN G) a. ‘greedy, avaricious, miserly’, (G) ‘unsociable’.
manzin (B) n. ‘nonentity, inconsequential person’.

maraz (B) a. ‘crumpled’, ‘spoiled’.
mardo (LN Z R) a. ‘soft, smooth’, (B LN Z R) ‘robust, sturdy’.
mardul (G B) a. ‘substantial, robust, sturdy’.



Etymological Dictionary of Basque 275
margul (B) a. ‘faded, washed out, colourless’. 1905. The attempt of A. (1905) to derive this from the dubious margo cannot be sustained: there is no evidence for any such suffix as the required *-ul, and the word has an ordinary form and sense for an expressive.
markets (L), makets (L LN HN), markits (LN), markhitx (LN S) a. ‘defective, deformed, imperfect’; ‘dull (in sound)’, ‘clonking’ (as of a counterfeit coin).

m-reduplication Bq. makes frequent use of a process called here m-reduplication. In this, an item is reduplicated, with /m/ replacing its initial consonant (if any) in the second occurrence. The reduplicated item may be either an ordinary lexical item of the language, or an expressive formation having no existence outside the reduplication. Those of the first type are listed in the dictionary under their source words: see, for
example, handi-mandi (under handi), hizka-mizka (under hitz), zokhota-mokhota (under zoko), zomorro-mamorro (under zomorro), and ikusi-mikusi (under ikusi). The others are gathered here for convenience. Note that, instead of /m/, we occasionally find /b/ or /p/ instead. We include a few words which depart slightly from the canonical pattern. Few of these words are recorded before the 20th century.

ma- (c.) Expressive syllable?
Bq. has a number of words with two variant forms, of which the second shows a syllable ma- in place of the other first syllable, whatever that may be: hegal ‘wing’, magal; gako ‘hook’, mako; udare ~ udari ‘pear’, madari. There is usually no semantic difference between the two forms. We may surmise that this ma- was once used to construct expressive variants of words, but that this process died out, and that the surviving instances of it lost their expressive force. It seems likely that some of the numerous words in ma- which have no etymologies represent fossilized instances of this process in which the original form has been lost. [SEE FHV 271-272]

maite (c.), moite (R) n. ‘love’, a. ‘beloved’, TS n. ‘beloved, sweetheart’. 1545. Cf maita-.
OUO, but unlikely to be native. The adjectival sense is far more frequent at all periods. Specialists have long suspected a source in the Celtic word represented by Old Irish maith ‘good’ (< *mati-), possibly by palatalization and then depalatalization (by P32) of the /t/ (Holmer 1950 **** FHV 218 fn]). M. (****{1964a: 145 and fn. 152}) notes a parallel between the verb maite *edun (below) and the Old Irish construction in is maith less ‘he likes it’ (lit., ‘he considers it good’). M.

maiz [1] (B G HN L LN), maes (B) adv. ‘often, frequently’, (B) a. ‘faded, withered’. 1571.

majo (G) n. ‘gallant’ (ca. 1880), adv. ‘well’, majo, maja (B G) a. ‘nice’ (20th cent.)
From Cast. majo ‘nice’. The word is popular, not literary, and it is interesting that the nominal and adverbial uses are recorded earlier than the adjectival use, even though the Cast. word is an adjective. For the use of the adjectival forms, see M***.

Directly from IE, possibly from Celtic. A stem *mand-, *mann- is widely attested in IE languages with senses ranging over ‘mule’, ‘sterile’, ‘kind of horse’, ‘small animal’, and almost all authorities agree that the Bq. words are derived from this stem, probably via Celtic or Latino-Romance mediation. The form *mand- is often thought to be



282 R. L. Trask
specifically Celtic, e.g. by Gorostiaga (1982). Of the same origin are thought to be Lat. mannus ‘type of small Gallic horse’, Bearn. Gasc. mano ‘barren woman’, old Cast. mañero ‘sterile’, and many other words. The B mana is thought to derive from late Lat. *manna ‘barren’ (of a woman or a female animal, usually in the feminine). For discussion, see AT s.vv., ML 5307a, CP s.v. mañero. The original stem is OUO, and commonly labelled ‘pre-Roman’ or ‘Iberian’ by Romanists.

A word of doubtful reality. It was reported by the early 19th-century Spanish polymath Hervás y Panduro, but it appears in no Bq. text or dictionary before the 1890s, when the word was picked up from Hervás by the Basque nationalists. Since than it has become common and has given rise to several derivatives. Curiously, I am told by a native speaker that margo is used in one area to denote the coloured mark placed on a sheep to

Mari [1] The name of a semi-divine figure of folklore, an austere and awe-inspiring woman, associated with certain places, such as the mountain Anboto, who requires certain types of behaviour and punishes those who fall short. The figure is of unknown antiquity but is decidedly non-Christian, though the name can hardly be native Bq. and probably represents an accretion from the Christian Virgin.

From some Rom. reflex of Lat. Martium id. B form directly by L**{10}.
maru (B) n. ****{‘post’ Az.}
From Lat. pālum ‘post, pole’, by L3, P22 (M. 1961a: 269). {Cf. paru ‘pole’.}
maruaga (B) n. ****. + haga ‘pole’ {Not in The Dictionary.} (M. 1961a: 269).
marhüka (Z), marhünka (Z) n. ‘wart’. ****
From Lat. verrucam id.

mataza (**), mathaza (**), mataxa (**), mathaxa (**) n. ‘hank, skein’. **** [FHV 225]
From some Rom. source akin to Cast. madeja id; cf. Bearn. matàcho, matàsso, madàsso (M. 1961a: 268).
matoĩ (**{R}), {matói (R), matio (S)} ****{n. ‘curds’} [FHV 148]
{From Navarrese matón id.}
matxite (G HN **), martxite (**) n. ‘machete’. **** [FHV 68]

{[}mahuka (**), mauka (**), mahunga (**) n. ‘sleeve’. **** {] Duplicates mahanga.}
maustin (Sout) n. ‘mastiff’. 1562.
From Rom.: cf. old Arag. maustín, mostín, Cast. mastín (M. 1977a: 488).
mazela (G HN L LN), masa(i)lla (G), masail (old G), maxela (S Z R), matra(i)lla (B L), matel (HN L LN), matela (LN S), mathela (LN Z) n. ‘cheek’ (anat.), mathela (Z), matela (S R) n. ‘large cheek’ (contrasting here with mazela ~ maxela ‘cheek’), matraila (L) n. ‘jaw’ (anat.). 1745, 1785.
From Lat. maxillam ‘jaw’, or perhaps better from its Rom. reflex *maxella, with variable treatment of the alien /ks/. The semantic shift is Rom.: cf. Cast. mejilla ‘cheek’. See M. (1961a: 188 fn. 21) for a discussion of the phonological history.
mea (B G L), me (HN) n. ‘mineral’. 1627.
Obscure. We may suppose an earlier *mena, by P1, which may derive either from Cast. mena ‘ore’ or from Lat. vēnam ‘vein (of ore)’, the second either directly by L3 or indirectly via *bena, by P7. M. (1977a: 546) prefers the Lat. source. Last form by M4.
meatze (**) n. ‘mineral’. ****
mehatxu (**), meatxu (**), mehátxü (Z) n. ‘threat’ **** [FHV 287]
mehatzatu (**), meatxatu (**) vt. ‘threaten’. ****
mediku (old LN **), midiku (L), miriku (** L) n. ‘doctor, physician’. ****
From ****{Lat. medicum}. Variants by P37, P17.
mehe (L LN), mẽ́hẽ (Z), mee (B HN), me (B G HN S R), be (Sout) a. ‘thin, slender’, ‘shallow’ (of water), TS (HN) ‘short of resources’. CF me(h)a-. 1627.
From *mene, by P1, from *bene, OUO, by P7 (M. 1961a: 146, 269). Landucci remarkably gives a def. form vea, representing a variant *be, though a second hand has corrected this to mea. CF by W2.2. Commonly reduced to -me or occasionally -pe as a final element, by W**{19}; for examples see zur, *al- and ogi.
mehar (**), mear (**), berar (B) a. ****{‘tight, narrow’}
meatu (**) ***{v. ‘become thin, make thin’} [FHV 110]
men ****{n. ‘power, capacity’ Aul.}
mende (HN L LN), mente (Z R) n. (HN L LN Z) ‘century’, (L? Z R) ‘time’, (Z R) ‘life’. 1571.
OUO. Lat. mentem ‘mind’ is phonologically perfect but semantically bizarre (M. ****{1965c: 118), and we may suppose a native *bente, by P6 and P7, possibly containing -te {[1]} NFS of duration attached to an unknown stem. M. (****{1984b: 200}) takes seriously the idea that mende ‘dominion’ is the same word in origin; see men.

mendebal (B G HN L), mendeal (L) n. ‘west wind’, TS (B G L) ‘west’. 1643. From some Rom. form akin to Fr. vent d’aval ‘valley wind’, by P7 (M. ****{?}) {AT}. {Gasc. Bayonne ben de bau ‘west wind’ Palay (1980), though Gasc. bau is not cognate with val ‘valley’.}
mendealxori (L) n. ‘phalarope’ (sp.) (zool.). + xori ‘bird’ (see zori).
mendebalde n. ‘west’. 1977. + alde ‘side’ {(see *al-)}, by W13.
mendekatu (HN L LN R), mendekatü (Z), bendekatu (?) vi. ‘avenge oneself’, (HN) ‘get what one deserves’, vt. ‘take vengeance on’, ‘earn’. 1545.
From Lat. vindicare ‘claim as one’s own’, ‘take vengeance on’ (M. 1961a: 268), possibly via P7.
Mendekoste (**) n. ‘Pentecost’. **** [FHV 268]
mendi (c.) n. ‘mountain’. 1545.
OUO. Probably from *bendi, by P7. The word cannot be related to Lat. montem id. in any orderly manner. As a final element, it appears uniquely as -pendi in the name casa de Auzpendi (for Auzmendi) (M. 1977a: 539).
mendu (B G), mentu (**), enphéltü (Z) ****{n. ‘graft’} [FHV 157]

From Lat. -mentum (M. 1961a: 353). A variant -ben is recorded nowhere except in nabarben, a variant of nabarmen (see nabar) (M. 1961a: 277).
meniak (old B) n. pl. ‘respite’. ****
Probably ult. from Lat. veniam ‘indulgence, remission’ (M. 1961a: 268), by L**{3, P7}, though the details are obscure.
merkatu (c. exc. Z), merkhatu (L LN), merkhátü (Z) n. ‘market’. 1571.
From Latin mercātum id.
merkatari (B G HN L LN R) n. ‘merchant’. CF merkatal-. 1562. From Lat. mercātārium id., but now formally + -ari {[1]} professional NFS. This is one of the loans which led to the introduction of the NFS -ari into Bq. CF by W12.
merkatalgoa (L LN Z HN) n. ‘commerce’. 1571. + -goa collective NFS.
merke (c.), mérke (Z) a. ‘inexpensive, cheap’. 1591. Generally thought to be from Lat. mercem ‘merchandise’ (M. 1961a: 268). The semantics is odd, though French bon marché ‘cheap’, literally ‘good deal’, may offer a parallel. A back-formation cannot be ruled out.
merk(h)atu (c. exc. Z), merkátü (Z) vt. ‘reduce in price’. **** + -tu VFS. Z distinguishes merkátü ‘reduce in price’ from merkhátü ‘market’.

mihi (L LN), mĩhĩ (Z), mĩ (R), mĩi (old B), mĩ (old B), mii (G), mi (HN R), min (B G) n. ‘tongue’. CF min-. 1571.
From *mini, by P1, from *bini, OUO, by P7 (M. 1961a: 269). CF by W2.1. As a final element in word-formation, it appears as -bin ~ -pin; see ardi [1], ortzi. See also milika {adv. ‘tasting’, n. ‘licking’ (not in The Dictionary)}. M. (1961a: 200) reports that western varieties of B distinguish miña ‘the tongue’ from mina ‘the pain’.

From Lat. vīmen id., by L3 or P7. The extraordinary “doubling” of the vowel in the first variant perhaps results from contamination by mihi ‘tongue’ (M. ****{1950b: 447}). Last variant unexplained.

mota (G HN L LN), mueta (B), moeta (old B G) n. ‘kind, sort’, TS (L LN Z HN) ‘breed, race’. 1571.
From Lat. monētam ‘coin’, by P1 (M. 1961a: 120). The semantic shift is Rom., not Bq.: Cast. moneda is used for ‘kind’ by the 12th-cent. Castilian poet Berceo (see CP s.v. moneda). The absence of a northern variant *moheta is curious.
moto (**) **** [MT entry]
motz [1] (**), mutz (Z) a. ‘short’, TS (B) ‘ugly’, TS (?) ‘bare’. 1627.
From some Rom. source akin to Cast. mocho ‘blunt’, ‘short’, ult. from an unrecorded Lat *mutium ‘blunted’ (M. ****{1950a: 195}).
motz(a) [2] n. ‘vulva’, ‘female genitals’, motzak n. pl. ‘male genitals’. 19th cent.
Sources disagree on the form. Widespread but little recorded, because of its generally obscene status. Possibly a TS of motz [1]; otherwise of expressive origin.

muin (LN), muiñ (G HN L), mun (G HN L), muña (S), fuiñ (L), huiñ (L), hun (LN), hün (Z), un (B LN R), gun (B), uña (Sout) n. ‘pith, marrow, medulla, inner part’, ‘whitish material inside a horn’, TS ‘brain’. 1617.
OUO. The word is applied to the pith of plants, to the marrow of human and animal bones, and to a variety of other internal substances. Very frequently more specific meanings are obtained by compounding, as in bizkarmuin ‘spinal cord’ (bizkar ‘back’), bur(u)muin ‘brain(s)’ (buru ‘head’) and garun ‘brain(s)’ (*gara ‘head’). An original *bune would account for most variants, by P7, P1 and P9, but this would produce an expected *(b)uhe in the north. Schuchardt (****{1906a: 51}) proposes Lat. fūnem ‘rope’, which is possible. S remarkably contrasts muña ‘pith, marrow’ with unak ‘brains’. [FHV 150-151, 151 fn]

multzo (L LN) (1571), multzu (HN L S) (1643) n. ‘group, bunch’, ‘pile’. Dimin. multxo.
OUO, but unlikely to be native. Bouda (****{cited in M. 1950a}) proposes Lat. multum ‘many’, but this looks phonologically impossible. {M. 1950a: 199f.}
mun (B), muin (Sout G), muñ (G) n. ‘kiss’ (according to A. 1905, in B, not on the face). ****
mun egin, muin egin vitmd. ‘kiss’. **** + egin ‘do’.
mundu (c. exc. Z), mündü (Z) n. ‘world’. 1545.
From Lat. mundum or Cast. mundo id. The word gives rise to few derivatives, and most of those are literary.
murru (LN), mürrü (Z), murralla (** old LN old Z), morroll (old L) n. ‘wall’ **** [FHV 331] [more in FHV 332 fn]

mus (**) n. ‘mus’, a certain card game. ****
mustela (B), musterle (B) n. ‘weasel’ (zool.) (Mustela nivalis).
From Lat. mustēlam id., but not directly, since we should have had *muztera or *mustera, by P22. M. (****{Michelena & Agud 1968: 76f.}) proposes an unrecorded Lat. variant *mustella, with replacement of the ending by the more frequent -ella. {The variant mustella is included in Glare 1982: s.v.} The strange second form perhaps by contamination from erle ‘bee’.
musu (**), musin (**) **** [MT entry] {? Different words in Az. musu ‘face, kiss on the face’, musin ‘mould (on bread)’.}

OUO. Conceivably from Cast. ralea ‘kind, sort’, by P22, with exceptional treatment of initial /r/, but M. (****{1965c: 119}) points out that there is no parallel for such a phonological development. Also difficult are the late attestation of the Cast. word (1325), and the fact that its earliest sense was ‘prey’, ‘capture (of prey)’. {Two 1250 examples in CORDE.} The *nerea of Arbelaiz (1978) is a typo.

OUO, but contains -ba kinship suffix. Bähr (****{1935: 12f.) suggests a derivative of anaia ‘brother of a man’, while M. (****{1961a: 310 fn. 20}) suggests instead a derivative of eme ‘female’; see arreba. In the historical period, B is alone among the dialects in possessing a word for ‘brother of a woman’ contrasting with anaia ‘brother of a man’; all other varieties use anaia in both senses. [FHV 310 fn]

nor (c. exc. Z), nur (Z) pron. ‘who?’. Sometimes reduced to no in B and G, by P25, and very commonly reduced to no- in B G before a consonant-initial suffix, as in nok for ergative nork. Late 15th cent. Possibly contains hypothetical *-r absolutive.

From *enor, + e- [2] indefinite, by P1, P61, P2 (M. 1961a: 67). Initial n- in some forms by analogical addition of the n- of nor (M. ****). Often reinforced by ere ‘even’, sometimes leading to contracted forms like Z ĩhũẽ́.

norbait (c.), norbeit (L), nurbait (Z) pron. ‘somebody, someone’. 1545. + -bait indefinite (see bait-). Today this word inflects like any other NP, for example with Erg. norbaitek, but, in the 16th cent., we find forms like norkbait, with the CS preceding -bait, reflecting the late addition of this element.

-o [1] (c.) Third-singular Dat. agreement marker in finite verb-forms.
OUO. M. (****) proposes a derivation from hon-, the oblique sg. stem of the proximal demonstrative hau ‘this’, which is plausible. See also -a [**] and -e [**] for evidence in support of this proposal. {Neither in The Dictionary.}
-ote (L LN) Third-plural Dat. agreement suffix in finite verb-forms. + -te {[3]} pl. {Not in The Dictionary.} Other varieties use -e [**{2}] {pl.}.{Not in The Dictionary.}
-o [2] (B LN) Apparent suffix of obscure function found in a few words and names, including nabaro ‘public’, ‘notorious’ (see *nabar-), an apparent *beltxo in the med. personal name don Belcho de Yrurre (beltz ‘black’), the surnames Garaio(a) (garai ‘high’); see *gara), Zabalo (zabal ‘wide’) and Chourio (Txurio) (txuri, dimin. of zuri ‘white’), and perhaps the B toponyms Berrio (berri ‘new’) and Elorrio (elorri ‘hawthorn’). It is not always easy to distinguish this item from the toponymic suffix -o [3], and it may be the same item as the toponymic suffix -io (M. ****{1973a: 133135}).

hobe (L LN Z), obe (B G HN LN R), oba (B) a. ‘better’. CF (h)oba-. 1545.
Irregular comparative of on ‘good’, the only irregular comparative in the language. OUO. CF by W2.2. Not directly recorded in Sout, but its presence there may be inferred from the existence of the adverb obato below.
habo(r)o (Z), aboro (S), oboro (LN), hoboro (old L), obro (R) prt. ‘moreover’. From *hobaro ‘more’, + -ro AdvFS {not in The Dictionary}, with various vowel assimilations and metatheses (M. 1961a: 161 fn. 12).

obeditu (L LN) vt. (earlier), vitmd. (later) ‘obey’. 1545.
From Lat. oboedire id. (Lh., M. ****{1974b: 193}). B Sout obedezidu (1562), obedezitu (1800) derives from Cast. obedecer id.

The source is Lat. offendere ‘make a mistake’, ‘give offence’, ‘suffer damage’ (M. ****{1974b: 204}), by **{L}3, P10, but the details are obscure. Possibly back-formed from the verb below. [SEE ALSO FHV 266 fn]

ogendant (Z) ****{‘guilty’} [FHV 537]
oberenda (Z), oberta (Z) n. ****{‘offering’} [FHV 266]
From Cast. ofrenda id. {The second form rather from Occ. ofèrta, Cast. oferta id.}
hobi (L LN Z), obi (B G HN) n. ‘cavity’, ‘pit’, ‘hole in the ground’ (sometimes esp. for a grave), ‘ditch’. 15th cent.
From Lat. fovea{m} ‘pit’ (ML REW 3463; M. ****{1961a: 133}), by L3. Cf. Gasc. hobi, Cat. obi. {But Cat. obi ‘trough, basin’ cannot be from fovea but must be < Lat. albeum ~ alveum; see DECLC s.v.}

obitxiatu (S.P.) **** [FHV 266]
obrada (LN), obradatze (LN) n. ‘species of willow’ (bot.).
From some Rom. form akin to Gasc. aubredé id. (M. ****{1958e: 405}). Second form by addition of -tze {NFS} (see -tza).
obu (B) n. ‘circle’, ‘iron ring’.
Probably from Cast. huevo ‘egg’ (M. ****{1961d: 17 fn. 25}). The *obo of A. (1905) is an error.
hodei (LN), hodéi (Z), odei (B Sout G HN L LN S R), odéi (Z R), odai (B G), hedoi (L LN Z), edoi (B HN L LN), odoi (B S), oroi (G), orai (G), orei (B HN), hode (old L), ore (HN), otei (Sout) n. ‘cloud’ ****. 1562.
OUO. The most conservative of the attested forms is (h)odei, with the variants by P17 and vowel metathesis or assimilation. The Sout form otei is mysterious, but note that Landucci gives odei for ‘cloud’ and a derivative oteiak only for ‘cloudy’ – if not a typo, perhaps by P8. The final stress in Z points clearly, by P73, to a lost consonant, and hence to *(h)odeCi, or more likely *(h)odeCe, since the article -a is not raised to -e in this word in the west (M. ****{1961a: 397 fn. 28}). This consonant cannot be identified; */n/ is possible by P1, but not supported by evidence. [MUCH MORE: FHV 397 fn]
odia, odi n. (B G) ‘gutter’, (HN old LN Z) ‘gully, ravine’, (HN S) ‘wooden cradle’. 1657.
Doubtful. M. (****{1973a: 135}) diffidently suggests a derivative of Lat. fodere ‘dig’, possibly fodīna ****{‘mine’}.

OUO. CF by W2.2. Variants by P35.1. The hapax spelling oghe in old L by Dasconaguerre is either an error or an Italian-style spelling. Commonly reduced to -oi, by W**{19}, as a final element in word-formation. See aburdi.
ohaide (old LN) (1657), oakide (old G), ohekide (?), ohaideko (LN?) n. ‘bedmate, ‘sexual partner’ (to whom one is not married), sometimes esp. ‘concubine, mistress’. + -kide ‘fellow’ (+ -ko).

hogei (LN), hógei (Z), ogei (B G HN), ógei (R), ogéi (R), hogoi (L LN), ogoi (L) num. ‘twenty’. 1571 (1537 in compounds).
OUO. Last two forms by an irregular vowel assimilation. Attempts at linking this to the Brythonic Celtic word represented by Welsh ugain (Middle Welsh ugeint), Cornish ugens ~ ugans, Breton ugent are dismissed by M. (****{1952: 550; 1964a: 137}) as
untenable: the Celtic forms must derive from *wikanti, and the resemblance is only to the modern forms.

M. (****{1964a: 113}) derives this from a Lat. fōcālem {(a kind of scarf)}, a derivative of Lat. *faux ‘throat’ (recorded only as abl. fauce {and plural fauces}), and surviving in Sardinian {(focale, fogale, -i ‘a disease of pigs’)} and in some Italian dialects, as in Venetian fogada.

From *oLa, OUO, by P23. Lh. proposes Lat. aulam ‘yard, court, palace’, but this is impossible by P22. The word is a common element in toponyms and surnames, where it frequently means only ‘place where something is done’, or even just ‘place’.

Obscure. The second element appears to be garro ‘tentacle’. For the first, M. (****{1953c: 481}) very diffidently suggests ora-, the stem of the verb oratu ‘grasp’ {not in The Dictionary}, with rhotic dissimilation.
olata (B Sout G HN) n. ‘bread offered in church to a deceased person’, (B G HN) ‘small bread roll for children’. 1562.

OUO. Lh. suggests Lat. ōmen ‘omen’, but the semantics is not good. G variant of the particle perhaps by vowel assimilation. If the word is native, we may reconstruct *oben, by P**{7}.
on (c. exc. Z), hon (old LN), hun (Z) a. ‘good’. 13th cent., 1415.
OUO. Z form by P71. An original *bon is possible, by P9, and is perhaps supported by the occurrence of -BON(N)- in Aq. This has led several linguists to suggest a borrowing from Lat. bonum ‘good’, but there are serious problems with this: the loss of the second Lat. vowel would be irregular, its presence in Aq. would require an astoundingly early borrowing, and the Lat. word itself is late in that language. The form on is abundantly recorded in the Fuero General de Navarra, and Ona ‘the Good’ is a frequent medieval sobriquet or surname, esp. in Navarra. This is the only adjective in the language that compares irregularly; see hobe. [SEE FHV 56 FOR A LIST OF DERIVS]

From one or more Rom. reflexes of Lat. fungum ‘fungus’, akin to Cast. hongo, often with expressive palatalization (M. ****{1961a: 54 fn. 10}).
ondo [1] (c.), hondo (L) n. ‘bottom’, ‘space below’, TS ‘side’, ‘space beside’, TS ‘tree’ (only in compounds), TS (L) ‘tree trunk’, TS ‘foot of a tree’, TS ‘time after’ (only in postpositions), TS (HN LN) ‘consequence, effect’, TS ‘residue’, TS (HN L LN) ‘ex-’, ‘former’. 1571.
From Cast. hondo ‘bottom’, or from *bondo, by P9, from Rom. *fondo, by L3, from Lat. fundum ‘bottom’. This is a spatial noun, and it occurs in some very frequent postpositions. It is also very frequently the final element in compounds, such as ukondo ‘elbow’, from uko ‘forearm’. Such compounds can take the RS -ko to render ‘post-’: gerra-ondoko ‘post-war’ (gerra ‘war’). The sense of ‘tree’ occurs only in compounds whose first element denotes the fruit of the tree: sagar ‘apple’, sagarrondo ‘apple tree’.

orain (B Sout G HN L LN Z), orai (G HN L LN Z R), oin (B G) adv. ‘now’. 1571.
From Lat. hōram ‘hour’ plus the Loc. in -n of some demonstrative or other item which is no longer recognizable (M. ****{1971b: 591 fn. 38; 1972f: 309 fn. 17}): lit. ‘at the hour’ or ‘at this hour’, a common way of expressing ‘now’ in the world’s languages. The second variant is probably derived by back-formation from the derivatives below in which the stem orai- results from the regular loss of Loc. -n before certain endings. Last form by contraction.
orast (Sout) adv. ‘now’, ‘at present’. 1562. From Lat. hōra est ‘it is the hour’ (M. ****{1957a: 21; Agud & Michelena 1958b: 42). The derivative below suggests that the word was formerly widespread. The *ozatz of A. (1905) is an error.

OUO. Since the hour is a Roman invention, we may suppose either that the word is borrowed or that a native word has been loan-shifted in sense. Schuchardt (****{1922})
suggests an origin in the Lat. nom. ordo ‘order, series’, with the sense of Lat. hōram ‘hour’, but few have found this appealing. Several have wanted to relate the word to oren ‘hour’ and to orain ‘now’, both of which likely derive from Lat. hōram, but the formal obstacles are formidable. A.

The same source notes that Bonaparte reports the word as having in R the “strange” /r/, the one otherwise derived from */t/.

OUO. Schuchardt (**** Ib Dekl {1908:} 5) proposes a Lat. *colestrum, variant of classical colostrum id.; this is not impossible but not appealing.

From Rom. forma, from Lat. formam ‘form’ (M. 1961a: 51). Most of the semantic developments are Rom., not Bq.: the Rom. word acquired various senses pertaining to outlining, and most of the Bq. senses are well attested in Rom. See, e.g., Cast. horma ‘form’, ‘drystone wall’, Fr. forme ‘form’, ‘shoemaker’s last’. Apparently forma was borrowed by L3 as borma, the form found in the 17th-cent. writer Oihenart for both ‘thin coating of ice’ and ‘wall’, while common (h)orma results from P9. The earlier sense of ‘thin coating of ice’ has been generalized to ‘ice’. [FHV 482]

This item exhibits unusual behaviour for a determiner: it follows a full NP containing the plural of the ordinary determiner -ak (see *har), and any case-marking on that NP is repeated on oro.

The final /t/ points to an Occ. origin. Noting the A derivative below, M. (****{1961a: 106, 211 fn. 13}) proposes an earlier *oreit, by vowel assimilation, from an unrecorded Gasc. *coréit, the regular outcome in that variety of Lat. collectum ‘gathered together’, by P14.

OUO. CF by W2.2. Localized and recorded late, but probably ancient. The word famously occurs in the toponym Orreaga, the Bq. name of the celebrated pass of Roncesvalles (Roncesvaux), where the Basques ambushed and annihilated the rearguard of a Frankish army in 778. Generally displaced by the loanword ipuru.

From Lat. hortum id.
hortz (L LN Z), ortz (B Sout G HN L LN R) n. ‘incisor tooth’ (anat.) (1562), TS ‘tooth’ (of a saw etc.) (1596).
OUO. Bq. distinguishes this word from hagin [**{1}] ‘molar tooth’, and it commonly uses the compound hortz-haginak (below) for ‘teeth’. There is no generic word for ‘tooth’, though hortz is sometimes so used, and always in the TS.

CF or(t)z-, ost-, oz-. A form urzi (12th cent.; see below); a variant orze ca. 1650 (provenance unknown); otherwise 1859.

discussion. Apart from one medieval and one 17th-century attestation, the independent word is not recorded before the 19th century, yet its numerous derivatives, some of them recorded early, point to an ancient word. The first attestation is that of the 12th-century French pilgrim Aimery Picaud, who, in a brief but otherwise accurate glossary, cites Urçia (apparently with the article -a attached) as the word for ‘God’. This has led many writers to conjure up a pagan Basque sky-god with the name *Ortzi or *Urtzi, but there is no other evidence for a deity of this name – apart perhaps from the day-names; see below – and M. (1964a: 51) suggests that Picaud, when requesting the Bq. word for ‘God’, may have pointed to the sky, and that the Basques, mistaking his intention, may have given him their word for ‘sky’. [FHV 130: MORE]
The original sense is hard to determine, since, both as an independent word and in its numerous derivatives, the word exhibits all of the meanings ‘sky’, ‘cloud’, ‘storm’ and ‘thunder’. The sense of ‘sky’ is attested for the independent word only in a single proverb recorded in the 19th century.

ortzegun (L LN HN), orzegun (L LN), ostegun (G HN LN), ostégün (Z), ostégun (R), orzégun (R) n. ‘Thursday’. 1617. + egun ‘day’. This word, which looks so much like a calque of Lat. Jovis dies ‘Thursday’ (lit., ‘day of Jupiter’), possibly provides some support for the idea, discussed above, that the first element might once have been the name of a sky-god or a thunder-god. But a calque along the lines of ‘thunder-day’ also appears plausible. However, M. (1972f: 307) points out that a derivation from bortz ~ bost ‘five’ + egun ‘day’ would be formally perfect, by P9, and semantically acceptable if the days of the week are counted from Sunday.

panp-, pinp-, punp- (L LN Z R HN G) expressive stems.
Largely confined to northern varieties and to adjoining areas of HN and G, these stems give rise to a variety of expressive and nursery formations, mostly with arbitrary continuations. Such expressive stems are highly unusual in Bq., and they appear to be borrowed from Gasc., which has a number of expressive formations in pVmp-. Indeed, a few of the individual formations may be directly borrowed from Gasc. In some cases, this pVnp- appears to replace the initial syllable of another form.

330 R. L. Trask
porlan (B G) n. ‘cement’. 1977.
From English Portland, the trade name on the sacks of cement imported from England. Though not recorded in writing before 1977, the word is probably a good deal older. It is the only certain case known to me of an English word borrowed directly into Bq., without Rom. mediation: the word appears to be unrecorded in Spanish.
{Though it is not in the Diccionario de la Real Academia Espanola, porlan ‘concrete’ is, in fact, attested in Spanish since 1942 (Camilo José Cela, La familia de Pascual Duarte). Spanish Porlan ‘(the isle of) Portland’ is attested since 1449.}

pot egin (HN L LN Z), pot eman (HN L?) vitmd. ‘kiss’. + egin ‘do’, + eman ‘give’. {Not in The Dictionary.}
pot [2] (B) n. ‘exhaustion’.
Expressive.
pot egin (B) vitm. ‘take a break from work because of exhaustion’. + egin ‘do’.
pot-, potx-, pox- Expressive stem.
These stems are shared with Rom. and are probably of Rom. origin. Formations are numerous, highly variable, usually severely localized, and often poorly recorded. Some of them are labels for small animals or are related endearments, but many are sexual terms whose vulgar nature means that they are seldom recorded by lexicographers, many of whom are clerics. For the sexual terms, the principal source is Etxezarreta (1983).
potikoka (HN L) adv. ‘on all fours’. Contains -ka AdvFS.
potin (B), potxingo (B), potxolo (B), potxongo (B) n. ‘puddle’.

poz (B G HN), boz (**), botz (**) n. ‘happiness’. 1596. [FHV 289]

From some Rom. development of Lat. fēniculum, or perhaps better of an unrecorded variant *fēnuculum (M. 1961a: 78), by P1. The probable Rom. form was approximately *fenullo, yielding a Bq. *penullu, whence *peullu > *piullu. Some of the variants have perhaps been contaminated by mihura ‘moss’ {not in The Dictionary}. The putative variant *pukullu cited by {Azkue from} Gèze (1875{: 308}), which has long perplexed etymologists, is dismissed by M. (****{1966a: 24}) as a simple typo {in Azkue} for intended {Gèze’s} puhullu, a French-style spelling of Z pühüllü.

*-r Hypothetical formative which may possibly be present in nor ‘who?’ (from interrogative stem no-), zer ‘what?’ (from interrogative stem ze-), and perhaps haur ‘this’ (see hau) and *har ‘that’ (distal) (M. 1961a: 336). These /r/s are always tapped. There appears to be no further evidence for such a formative, nor any identifiable function if the formative is real. However, we may note two points. First, these /r/s appear only in forms which are singular or at least non-plural. Second, in Bq. nominal morphology, a tapped /r/ is regularly inserted into a non-plural form to break up a vowel sequence arising when a vowel-initial suffix is added to a vowel-final stem, but no such /r/ is normally inserted in plural forms, in which the vowel hiatus is either retained or reduced. It is conceivable that this phonological /r/ derives from generalization of a fossilized /r/ formative.
-ra (c. exc. Z), -la (Z), -rat (L LN), -(r)át (Z), -rát (R), -(a)lat (Z) Allative CS. TS ‘for’, ‘in order to’ (purpose).
Today, with the partial exception of Z, this is everywhere the ordinary allative casesuffix. It has possibly replaced an earlier -a, the allative commonly found with place names. When following a verb in the gerund -te {[2]} or -tze, it expresses purpose: erostera ‘in order to buy (something)’. [FHV 245, 245 fn] [MORE]
-rantz (**), -rontz (**), -runtz (**) ****
-ra- (c.) Causative prefix.
OUO. It is clear that, at some ancient stage, this -ra- was the productive causative affix in Bq., for both transitive and intransitive verbs. This is surprising, since it is prefixed to the root of the corresponding simple verb, and prefixes are extremely rare in Bq. In some cases, verb-pairs are still readily identifiable: ibili ‘be in motion (< *e-bil-i), erabili ‘put into motion’ (< e-ra-bil-i); egin ‘do’ (< e-gin-i), eragin ‘cause to do’ (< era-gin-i). In other cases, apparent pairs exhibit unexpected semantics: jantzi ‘get dressed’ (< *e-antz-i), erantzi ‘get undressed’ (< *e-ra-antzi-i). A number of old verbs look like ancient causatives whose simple verbs are lost or doubtful: irakurri ‘read’, no simple verb recorded; iraun ‘last, endure’ (intransitive, but with transitive morphology), perhaps egon ‘wait, stay’? This affix occasionally appears as -re- by vowel dissimilation, esp. in the writer Leizarraga: [FHV 71]. In the historical period, the productive causative affix is the suffix -erazi, which is surely an independent verb in origin, and very likely also a -ra- causative of an unknown verb.

Obscure. In spite of its late attestation outside Larramendi’s dictionary, the word is popular. It appears to contain gori ‘fiery’, but the first element is opaque.
sari (**) n. ‘payment’, ‘toll, tax’, ‘value’, ‘prize, reward’, TS ‘punishment, just desserts’. ****

sasi (B G HN L LN), zarzi (old LN) n. ‘bramble, blackberry bush’ (bot.) (Rubus fruticosus). 1658.
The conservative form is zarzi, recorded as a hapax in the writing of Oihenart in the passage “çarci vel sassi” (Notitia 52); common form as follows: zarzi > *zasi (by P19) > sasi (by W16). The word must share a common origin with Cast. zarza id. (earlier sarça), itself OUO and presumably “pre-Roman”; see CP (s.v. zarza) for an account. CP also mention a putative Bq. variant ?sartzi, not otherwise recorded.
sasi- pseudo-prefix ‘wild’, ‘false, pseudo-’. The sense of ‘wild’ is obvious enough from a word meaning ‘bramble’. The further sense of ‘pseudo-’ must have developed along the lines of ‘wild’ > ‘disorderly’ > ‘irregular’ > ‘pseudo-’. Established compounds with the sense of ‘wild’ are listed below. Those with the sense of ‘pseudo-’ are coined freely and are far too numerous to list here; a few prominent ones are listed in the dictionary under their second elements. Typical examples: sasi-ezkontza ‘cohabitation’, ‘living in sin’ (ezkontza ‘marriage’); sasi-poeta ‘poetaster’ (poeta ‘poet’).

sei (c.) num. ‘six’. 1415.
OUO. Attempts at deriving this from Rom. have failed, since all neighbouring Rom. varieties have a final sibilant in their word for ‘six’, and hence a borrowing should have yielded a Bq. *seits or *seis, at best.

seme (c.) n. ‘son’. 15th cent. CF sema-.
From *senbe, OUO, by P3 (M. ****{1954a: 432}). App. attested as SEMBE- in Aq. male names. It is possible that the word contains *sen-, the CF of *seni, mod. sein (and variants) ‘boy’, as suggested by Bähr (****{1935: 10}). If so, then either the Aq. item is unrelated or we are looking at an extraordinarily early application of W**{2.1}, since the word-formation processes listed in section **{7} are not normally visible in the Aq. names. The final *-be would also be obscure, though it might be present also in ume ‘child’, from *unbe, and it might be a variant of the kinship suffix -ba. CF by W**{2.2}.

t/k reduplications Bq. has a number of expressive formations corresponding broadly to the following pattern: tVtV- or kVkV-, sometimes with an extra consonant, especially /n/, after the first vowel.

thailu (**), **** thallu (old LN) **** n. ‘kind, sort’. **** Lh. taxu (**), taju (G), {taiu (EB) ‘aspect’, ‘ability’, ‘adaptation’} *****

From Cast. atalaya id.
talo (B G HN L LN) n. ‘a kind of flat round maize-cake’, formerly a Basque staple, TS (L LN) a. ‘flat, flattened, squat’. 17th cent.
From Rom.: CP (s.v. tallo) reports a sparsely recorded Galician talo ‘maize cake’, app. from Lat. thallu{m} ‘stalk with leaves’.



Etymological Dictionary of Basque 345
tamal (B L) n. ‘misfortune’, ‘bad luck’, ‘regret’, ‘compassion’. 1596.
App. from Lat. tam malum ‘what a misfortune!’, or from a Rom. development of this (Lh. s.v.). The word was somewhat rare and archaic before the 20th cent., when it was revived.
tanda (**) ***** **** Dimin. txanda ‘turn’ (of a person in sequence, as in a game) **** [FHV 188]
tanta (**), tanto (G) **** n. ‘drop’, **** **** ttantto (** G)
-tar, -ar (c.) Ethnonymic suffix forming nouns and adjective: ‘(who is) from’. Examples: lapurtar ‘(who is) from Lapurdi’; donostiar ‘(who is) from Donostia (San Sebastián)’.
OUO. Usually we find -tar after a consonant or a diphthong and -ar after a vowel, suggesting perhaps an original *-dar. Aq. -T(H)AR, -TARRIS may represent the same suffix. Ib. appears to exhibit a suffix -TAR which is attached to place names and perhaps also forms ethnonyms (M. ****{1961a: 50, etc.}).
-tarzun, -arzun (LN A S R), -tárzün, -árzün (Z), -tasun, -asun (B G HN L LN) NFS forming abstract nouns. Example: eder ‘beautiful’, edertarzun, edertasun ‘beauty’. + *-zun. Last two variants by P19. In some Pyrenean varieties, the suffix is normally -(t)arzun, but is -(t)asun when the stem contains an /s/: hence edertarzun ‘beauty’, but osasun ‘wholeness, health’, from oso ‘whole’. Sometimes appears as -rasun, by dissimilation, when the stem contains a /t/ or a /d/. See -keria.
tastabin (B), tastafin (B), gaztabin (G), lastabin (G), laztabin (G), xastagin (HN), txasta(g)in (HN) **** {‘small drill’} [FHV 187, 187 fn]

taxutu (HN **) **** [FHV 193, 517] [2 senses; one from taxu; sort]{] Moved to thailu.}
-te [1] (c.) NFS of duration; NFS making verbal nouns.
OUO. This suffix makes nouns of duration, mostly from nouns, occasionally from adjectives: gose ‘hunger, hungry’, gosete ‘famine’; euri ‘rain’, eurite ‘rainy spell’; legor ‘dry’, legorte ‘drought’. Added to a verb-stem, it produces a verbal noun: egin ‘do’, egite ‘deed, action’; ikusi ‘see’, ikuste ‘act of seeing’. The second function is presumably derived from the first, and it supports the conclusion of Trask (1990) that the radical (the verb-stem functioning as a free form) was originally nominal; see e- [*].

teila (**), tella (** HN) n. ‘roof tile’. **** [FHV 521]
From **** {Arag. tella id. from Lat. tegulam id.}
teilatu (c.) (17th cent.), te(i)llatu (c.), telladu (Sout) (1562) n. ‘roof’.
From some Rom. development of late Lat. *tegulātum ‘tiled, covered with tiles’ (of a
roof), from Lat. tegulam ‘roof tile’. The word is akin to Cast. tejado id., but the form of the Bq. word shows that it cannot be borrowed from Cast., and the likely source is Arag. (M. **** {1964a: 110}).
théiü (Z), texu (R) a. ‘dirty, impure, obscene’.
From Lat. taedium ‘loathing, disgust’ (M. 1961a: 175, ****{1954b: 142; 1972f: 316f.; 1974b: 190}).

-ti [1] (c.) AFS.
OUO. Forms adjectives from nouns. Examples: beldur ‘fear’, beldurti ‘fearful’; ****.
-ti [2] (old B) ‘via, by way of’, (c.) Abl. CS.
OUO. In our most archaic Bq. text, the R&S, this suffix is used exclusively to mean ‘via, by way of’, which is presumably its earlier function. Example: ao ‘mouth’, aoti ‘by mouth’. Otherwise, it occurs only as an Abl. case-suffix. As an Abl., it is frequent in early texts, and it is still perhaps used in a few varieties today, but it has been generally superseded by -tik (q.v.), which may or may not be derived from -ti.
Ablative: [be sure to include the directional sense of goiti etc.] [FHV 236: important]



Etymological Dictionary of Basque 347
-ti [3] (c.) **** As in beheiti, urruti, barruti, etc. *** [FHV 236] M. (1961a: 236) takes this as identical to -ti [2]. [FHV 236 fn: Lafon identifies it with -ti [1].]
-tik (c.) Abl. CS. [FHV 236-237: important] [often extended to -tika(n)] [FHV 237 fn]

tipula (L LN A R G HN), kipula (B G), gipulla (Sout), kinpul(l)a (B), túpla (R), tipla (S) n. ‘onion’ (bot.) (****). 1562.
From Lat. cepullam id. (M. 1961a: 65). First vowel by P37. Fourth variant by P34. R form by P70, P38. An otherwise unrecorded variant dipula in the name Maria de Dipulatçe (Pamplona 1350). The unusual variation in the initial consonant suggests that the word was borrowed at a time when Lat. /k/ had palatalized to [kj], and that the Basques, having no such sound, interpreted this variously as a velar or as a coronal. [FHV 183 fn] M. (1961a: 239–240) notes that an original voiced initial plosive seems to have given way to a voiceless one.
tireso (LN Z S) a. ‘stiff, rigid’. ****
From Cast. tieso id., by ***{P35.1} (M. 1961a: 167).
tiro (c.) n. ‘gunshot’, ‘sound of a gunshot’. 1562.
From Cast. tiro id.
tiro egin vitm. ‘shoot’, ‘fire (a gun)’. + egin ‘do’.
tiroka (c.) adv. ‘by shooting’, ‘with shots’, ‘while firing’. + -ka AdvFS.

titi (B G HN LN Z R) (1745), thiti (Z), diti (LN S) (1545), dithi (L LN) n. ‘(female) breast’, TS ‘mother’s milk’ (nursery word in this sense).
Of nursery origin, but possibly borrowed from Rom.: cf. Cast. {, Occ.} teta ‘nipple, udder’, Fr. téton ‘(female) breast’, etc., all of nursery origin.
ditiburu (**), titiburu (**), ditimoko (**), titimoko (**), ditimutur (**), titimutur (**), ditipunta (**), titipunta (**), titimusko (**) n. ‘nipple’. + buru ‘head’, + moko ‘beak’, + mutur ‘extremity’, + punta ‘point’, + musko ‘summit’.

-to [1] (c.), dimin. -tto (L LN Z), -txo (B G HN L), -txu (B L). NFS forming diminutives.
OUO. Apparently recorded in the Aq. female name NESCATO (see neskato ‘little girl’, under neska ‘girl’), and perhaps more generally as Aq. -T(T)O. As is usual with diminutive suffixes, this one is almost always palatalized. [MITX 73 {(M. 1973a: 152)}] However, in spite of the straightforward phonology, M. (1961a: 186–187) is not sure that -to and -txo represent the same suffix, since Aq. exhibits two distinct suffixes -T(T)O and -X(S)O. See -no.
-to [2] (B) AdvFS forming adverbs of manner from adjectives. Examples: ederto ‘beautifully’ (eder ‘beautiful’); ondo ‘well’ (on ‘good’).
OUO. B alone uses this suffix, all other varieties using -ki [1] instead.
to (c.) intj. word using in calling to a man; also (HN L LN Z R) in calling to a domestic animal. It can represent a simple ‘Hey!’, or it can mean more specifically ‘Take this!’.
tobaja (G) n. ‘towel’, tahálla (Z) ‘tablecloth’, ‘napkin’. ****
From Cast. toalla ‘towel’. {tahálla (Z) rather from Occ. toalha ‘tablecloth’.}

**** A toponym Olotoqui near Leire 1056.
toki (** L) n. ‘place’, hóki (Z) ****{n. ‘stool’, TS ‘normal state’}. [FHV 214{, 526}] By extraction of the suffix (M**{3}).

tortaka (Sout) adv. **** {‘trotting’} [FHV 348]
toska (**) n. ‘kaolin, white clay’, toxka (Z) **** 1746, 1858.
From a Rom. word akin to Cast. tosco ‘coarse, crude’. CP (s.v. tosco) note that this word is found throughout Ibero-Rom., and that attested Rom. formations like Cat. pedra tosca



Etymological Dictionary of Basque 349
‘pumice stone’ (lit. ‘coarse stone’) can account for the final /a/ in Bq. CP also suggests that the coarse, lumpy appearance of kaolin is the reason for the label.
tratu (**) n. ‘dealing(s)’, ‘traffic’, ‘commerce’. ****
From Cast. trato ‘deal’.
tresna (**), tresen(a) (HN) ****, tresenak (HN) n. pl. ‘clothes’. **** [FHV 512] [CP s.v. tresnar]

{[}trisipu (G) **** [FHV 258] {] Duplicate, see under lizifru.}
-ts- Dative flag.
-tsu, -zu (B G HN L) AFS ‘full of’.
The original form is clearly -zu, since this form alone occurs in toponyms, such as Arantzazu (arantza ‘thorn’). But, as a rule, only -tsu appears in ordinary lexical items, with rare exceptions like mukizu ‘full of mucus’, from muki ‘mucus’. M. (1977a: 542543) suggests that this variant arose by reanalysis of cases like satsu ‘filthy’, from sats ‘ordure’ plus -zu, in which the phonological development is regular, by W8.
-zu (c.) Indefinite pl. suffix. [FHV 542]
ttoko-ttoko, ttuku-ttuku (H.) adv. ‘in small halting steps’.

tu (HN Sout), thu (L LN), thü (Z), to (G). n. ‘spit, saliva’, ‘gob of spit’. 1562, 1571. Dimin. ttu (HN), txu (B).
Imitative. Words for ‘spit’ of the form [tu-] are widespread in the world’s languages. See also txistu.
tu egin etc. vitm. ‘spit’. 1571. + egin ‘do’.
-tu (c. exc. B), -du (B) VFS.
The variant -du in most dialects after /n/ or /l/, by P6, but generalized in B, perhaps under Rom. influence. From the Lat. participial suffix -tum (M. 1961a: 233). It appears that early Bq. borrowed Lat. verbs in the form of their participles (e.g., aditu ‘hear’ from auditum), and that so many were borrowed that -tu came to be taken as the ordinary suffix for deriving verbs from other parts of speech, displacing native -i [1] in this function. [MITX 73 {M. 1973a: 153}] [B: often -du, or -u between vowels]
tupina (L LN), tupin (L LN), tupiñ (L LN), thüpiña (Z), thipíña (Z), thipiñ (Z), dupin (old LN), duphin (L LN), dipiña (LN), dipidia (old G?), topina (?) n. ‘cooking pot’. 17th cent.

txahal (Z), txaal (B), xahal (L LN), xáhal (Z), txal (B G), xãl (R), xal (S) n. ‘calf’. 17th cent.
From *xanal, by P1, from an unpalatalized original *zanal or *sanal (can’t tell which), OUO (M. 1949a). The apparent variant *xamal cited in Arbelaiz (1978: s.v.) is a typo.
txabola (B G) (1762), txaola (G) (1745, 1842) n. ‘hut, cabin’ (esp. a shepherd’s hut), txabola (S R) ‘customs man’s hut’.
From Old Cast. javola ‘cage’ (mod. jaula), ult. from Lat. *caveolam ‘small enclosed place’ (Castro ****{A. 1933: 60-61}). The word is not related to etxe ‘house’ or to ola ‘place’. See etxola under etxe. See also kaiola. {M. 1953d: 566}
txalma (c.) n. ‘pack saddle, light saddle’, ****. 1745, 1808.

txiriboga (G), txiribogin (old B), txiologa (old B) n. ‘tavern’. 1596.
From some local Rom. form of the word represented by Cast. sinagoga ‘synagogue’ (M.
****{1957a: 14 and 23 fn. 7}), with dissimilation of the first //. Apparently a joke in origin.
txirla (B G) n. ‘clam’ (zool.) (genera Tapes, Venus, Mytilus), TS ‘vulva’. 1745, ca. 1800.
Expressive. It is possible that the sexual sense is earlier than the zoological one. In compounds, the word strangely means ‘oyster’, though this sense is not recorded for the independent word.
txistu (B G), xistu (L LN), xixtu (L LN), hixtu (L LN?), fixtu (L LN?), listu (HN), lixtu (HN), ixtu (G HN), istu (L LN?), huxtu (L LN), hüxtü (Z) n. ‘whistle’ (sound), ‘whistling’, ‘saliva, spit’, ‘traditional small end-blown flute’, (HN L) ‘speed’. 1653.

txukun (B G) a. ‘neat, tidy, clean’. Ca. 1740.
OUO, possibly expressive. Note: the widely disseminated suggestion that Cast. chacona (the dance), whence French and English chaconne, derives from this Bq. word is untenable.
txunditu (G HN) vi. ‘be astonished’ ***** [FHV 188 fn]
-tza, -tze (c.) NFS forming nouns of abundance and abstract nouns, mainly of activity. Examples: jendetza, jendetze ‘crowd, throng’ (jende ‘people’); jaiotza ‘birth’ (jaio ‘be born’).
OUO. Modern -tza is attested several times as -zaha in the Rejas de San Millán, 952. It is not certain that -tza and -tze are the same suffix in origin, but their behaviour is so similar that they can reasonably be treated together. [FHV 111, 111 fn, 500: disagrees]
-tzaile (c. exc. Z), -tzale, -zale (Z) NFS forming agent nouns from verbs of the -tu class, of any transitivity. Example: lagundu ‘help, assist’, laguntzaile ‘helper, assistant’. + ile, variant of -le, the agent suffix with ancient verbs. It appears that, at some early stage, verbs derived from non-verbal stems with the borrowed suffix -tu could not take -le directly, but had to first form a nominal derivative in -tza. This supports the conclusion of Trask (1990) that ancient verbal stems, derived from verbal roots with the prefix e- [1], were nominal in nature, not verbal.
-tzapen ****{NFS + -pen (see -mendu)}
-tze (c. exc. B R) Suffix forming gerunds from verbs of the -tu class. A grammaticalization of the noun-forming suffix above. As proposed in Trask (1990), it appears that verbal nouns of activity formed with this suffix were originally strictly nominal in nature, but that they came to be reinterpreted as non-finite verb-forms taking ordinary verbal arguments with ordinary case-marking. This development is strongly comparable to the origin of the English gerund suffix -ing, which likewise derives from a suffix forming verbal nouns (Jespersen 1948: 205–210). The late origin of this gerund suffix is consistent with its absence from the two peripheral dialects, B in the west and R in the east. See also -te {[2]}, -keta {not in The Dictionary}.

Etymological Dictionary of Basque 359
urdin (B G HN L LN Z) a. (originally) ‘green, blue, grey’, (today) ‘blue’, but ‘grey’ (of hair or beards), (B HN LN) n. ‘mould’, (LN S R) a. ‘dirty’, (Z R S) n. ‘turbid water’, (B) a. ‘smooth, fine, white’ (of skin or complexion). 1627. Also (Sout) ‘grey-brown’ [hapax] 1562.
This looks for all the world like ur ‘water’+ -din AFS ‘resembling’ (see *edin), which is semantically perfect for the historical sense, but, by W11, we would have expected *udin. The original broader sense is not directly attested, but it is confirmed by gibelurdin (see gibel), the name of a mushroom with a bright green cap. And S.P. glosses the word as “grison, moisi” (“gone grey, mouldy”). The restriction to ‘blue’ was presumably induced by Rom. borrowings like berde ‘green’ and gris ‘grey’. Today the word means ‘grey’ only with respect to human hair and beards; see also mutxurdin (under motz [2]).
But the early Sout sense of ‘grey-brown’ (Cast. pardo), combined with the eastern sense of ‘turbid water’, points to a still earlier value (see Trask ****{??}). This earlier value lends some support to the proposal of Charenc{e}y (1898) to derive the word from urde ‘pig’. But perhaps we cannot rule out the possibility that the earliest sense of urdin was the attested ‘mould’, and that all the other senses have been derived from this.
urdin-belar (HN), urdin-bedar (B), urdin-berar (G) n. ‘woad’ (bot.) (Isatis tinctoria). 1745, 1847. + belar {[1]} ‘grass’.

Probably from *burki, OUO; common variant by P9. The last variant is mysterious, though M. (1961a: 260) suggests an assimilated intermediate form *kurki or *gurki. A link has often been suggested to the Germanic word represented by English ‘birch’, but there is no certain case of a Germanic word taken into Bq. without Romance mediation. ****

366 R. L. Trask
z- [1] Past tense
z- [2], -tz- (in forms like zait, natzaizu) [FHV 173-174: from *di- ?]
-z (c.), -s (HN A) Instrumental/adverbial suffix.
**** M. (1961a: 282) notes that A and part of HN use -s in place of the common -z.
OUO. Though commonly treated in grammars as a case-suffix, this suffix is in fact poorly integrated into the case-system. In most instances it is attached, not to an NP with a determiner, but to an N-bar, a bare nominal with no determiner. Examples: esku ‘hand’, eskuz ‘by hand’; gau ‘night’, gauez ‘at night’; ardo ‘wine’, ardoz betea ‘full of wine’. [about] [with both hands]
It is possible that this suffix once meant ‘with’, ‘in the company of’. [****].
-zki (c.) NFS. App. + -ki [**{3}] NFS.
-zko (c.) Suffix forming adjectivals: ‘made of’, ‘consisting of’, occasionally added pleonastically. Examples: urre ‘gold’, urrezko ‘golden, made of gold’; eme ‘female’, emezko ‘female’ + -ko.
zahar (L LN Z), zaar (B), zar (B Sout G HN R), zagar (**{HN}) a. ‘old’. 1164, 1562. Dimin. (L LN Z) xahar ‘old’, ‘aged’, ‘used’. [FHV 413]
OUO. Apparently attested as Aq. SA.HAR in the male name VMME SA.HAR on the Lerga stele (see ume).
-tzar (c.), -zar (c.) ‘old’, ‘big’, ‘bad’. By reanalysis of the above as a final element in compounds, with semantic shifts. Dimin. -(t)xar.
tzar (L LN Z) a. ‘bad, perverse, wicked, evil’. 1750. Dimin. txar (LN Z) ‘bad, shoddy, of poor quality, unsatisfactory’, (L) ‘naughty’, (L LN Z R HN) ‘small’, (B G L LN) ‘delicate, weak, feeble’, (B G HN) ‘bad’. 1720. By extraction of the suffix and use as an independent word (M**{3}) (M. 1961a: 413). See gaitz. [FHV 190-191] M. (1961a: 191 fn. 26), citing A. Alonso, reports that the Bq. of the Baztán valley distinguishes the following: gizon zaarra ‘the old man’, g. tzarra ‘the wicked man’, g. txarra ‘the bad-tempered man’, g. xarra ‘the old fellow’, g. ttarra or ttalla ‘the little fellow’, the last possibly being a nursery form.
zabal (c.), zábal (Z) a. ‘wide, broad’, TS (c.) ‘open’, TS (B) ‘public, well-known’, TS (B HN) ‘abundant, copious’ (esp. of food), TS (old B) ‘generous’ (of a person) (hapax). 15th cent. Dimin. xábal (Z).
OUO. This word is extremely frequent in toponyms and surnames.
zagi (B G HN R S) n. ‘leather container for wine or oil’, ‘wineskin’. ****
zato (B G HN), xato (HN) n. ‘small wineskin’. **** + -to [**{1}] dimin.
zail (** R), za(i)ll (B G **), zal (B), zall (Z) a. ‘tough’ *****
OUO. B form by an unusual application of P**{51}.



Etymological Dictionary of Basque 367
zain [1] {n. ‘guard, watchman’} [SORT OUT],
From *zani, OUO, by P1 (M. 1961a: 414). {[FHV 143]}
-zain (**), -zai (**), -zãi (old B), -záñ (Z), -zái (R), -za(i)ñ (B) [FHV 143, 414] n. ‘guard, guardian’. ****
zain [2] (** R), za(i)ñ (G HN), zan (B), zañ (Z) n. ‘vein’, ‘root’, ****

zakil (B Sout G HN L LN), zakhil (L LN) n. ‘penis’ (anat.). 1562.
OUO.
zaku (c. exc. Z), zákü (Z) n. ‘sack, bag’. 1562.
From Lat. saccum id.
zakur (G?) n. ‘dog’ (zool.) (Canis lupus familiaris), TS zakur (G HN LN Z R), zakhur (L LN) ‘big dog’. 1745, 1761. Dimin. txakur (c.) (1562), xakur (HN L LN Z R) (1643), txákür (Z) TS ‘dog’.
OUO. This word has displaced the earlier or from most of the country. The diminutive (t)xakur ‘little dog’ has now displaced the original zakur as the unmarked form in nearly all the country, by M10, while zakur is now either specialized to mean ‘big dog’ (in most of the country) or lost altogether (in B). The long-standing notion that Cast. cachorro ‘puppy’ derives from Bq. txakur is dismissed by CP (s.v.) as unsustainable.
zaldi (c. exc. Z) n. ‘horse’ (zool.) (Equus caballus). (?) ca. 1470, 1562.
OUO. Often related to an ancient Hispanic t(h)ieldo ‘horse’ recorded in Pliny’s Natural History 8: 166. See zamari. [FHV 356 fn]
zaldun (**) n. ‘gentleman’. *** + -dun ‘having’ (see *edun). [FHV 361]
zaltoki (old LN **) n. ‘saddle’. **** + -toki ‘place’. [see FHV 250]
zalke (G HN S), zalka (G), zalge (LN Z R), zalga (B) n. ‘vetch’ (bot.) (Vitia sativa). 1745, 1802.
OUO. The fluctuation in the form of the cluster is anomalous and puzzling.
zaltu (R) n. ‘grove where cattle forage’, *zaldu element in toponyms. [FHV 353] [much more]
From Lat. saltum ‘woodland, wilderness’ (M. 1961a: 353).

zalu (L LN), zalhu (L LN), zallhu (L LN), zauli (G HN L), zalhi (LN), zoli (B), zálhe (Z), zaloi (G HN A S), zalui (A), zalhui (L) a. ‘supple, flexible’, ‘obedient’, ‘agile, quick’, ‘determined, spirited’. 1627. zal(h)u (L LN) intj. ‘hurry up!, quickly!’
Obscure. M. (1961a: 107) cautiously suggests a derivation from zail ‘tough, tenacious’.
zama (c.) n. ‘load’. 1571. TS (1847) ‘a certain measure of weight’, about 300 pounds.
From Lat. sagma id., of Gk. origin.
zamari, zamá(r)i (Z), zámari (R) n. (B HN S Z R) ‘pack-horse’, TS (S R Z) ‘horse’ (in general) (zool.) (Equus caballus). 1571. CF zamal-. Dimin. xamá(r)i (Z).
From Lat. sagmārium ‘pack-horse’, of Gk. origin (M. ****{1961a: 402, 1973a: 164, 1974b: 191}). CF by W1, W12. In Z, this word has completely displaced native zaldi as the word for ‘horse’. See zama.
xamalko (**) n. ‘colt’. **** + -ko. {Dimin. not in The Dictionary.} [FHV 318]
zamaldun (**), zamaldün (Z) n. ‘horseman, rider’, TS ‘gentleman’. **** + -dun ‘who has’ (see *edun).
zamalzai (Sout) n. ‘muleteer, teamster’. + -zain ‘guardian’ (see zain {[1]}).
zamalzatz (**) n. ‘stud jackass’. ? + -zatz ‘male’ (see -zartz).
zamar [1], zamarra (?) n. (Sout HN Z S R) ‘thick lined coat or jacket’, often esp. a sheepskin garment with the wool still attached as a lining (1562), (Nor) ‘jacket’ (in general), (LN) ‘fleece’, (HN LN) ‘mass of wool cut from a single sheep’, (B) ‘covering for the flax on a distaff’, (B) (also samar) ‘piece of soft leather placed over the forehead of an ox’, (B) ‘glove’, (Z) ‘mane’ (1926), (Nor) ‘unruly mass of (human) hair’ (1961). Dimin. txamar (L) ‘jacket’, txamarra (B) ‘man’s jacket’, (LN) ‘jacket’.
The 16th-c. attestations probably represent zamarra, with common zamar by M**{4}. It is not certain that all these senses represent the same word. The word is hardly likely to be native, and it is surely taken from Cast. zamarra ‘sheepskin jacket’, ‘sheepskin’, since ‘(sheepskin) jacket’ is the only sense recorded early. The Cast. word is itself OUO. CP (s.v.) initially contemplate a Bq. origin, but then they note that what appears to be the same word occurs in Portuguese, Catalan, Occ, Old Fr. and even Italian, and they note further that the word is recorded in northern Languedoc in the first half of the 13th c., and they conclude finally that the word is “pre-Roman”. CP present a number of fanciful etymologies from Bq., Greek and Arabic, and they properly dismiss all of them as indefensible.
Assuming these are all the same word, the sense of ‘sheepskin jacket’ has developed in one direction toward ‘covering’ (in general) and in another toward ‘fleece, wool’. The senses of ‘mane’ and ‘unruly hair’ are doubtless calqued on Fr. toison ‘fleece, mass of wool’, which has the same TS.
zamargin n. (Sout) ‘dealer in hides’ (1562), (B) ‘producer of leather coverings for oxen’. + -gin ‘maker’ (see egin).



Etymological Dictionary of Basque 369
zamau (B HN), zamu (B), zabau (old G Sout) n. ‘tablecloth’. 1745, 1802.
From Lat. sabanum ‘covering’ {better: ‘linen cloth’}, by P7, P1 (M. 1961a: 97).
zanko (B Sout G LN Z) (1562), zánkho (Z), zánko (R), zango (G HN L LN) (1571) n. ‘leg’ (anat.), (L LN Z) also ‘foot’, ‘paw (of an animal)’, TS (L LN Z) ‘footprint’, ‘track (of an animal)’. CF zanka-.
From a Rom. word meaning ‘long leg’ (as of a bird), preserved today as Cast. zanco ‘stilt’, zanca ‘shank’ (of a bird or a person) and elsewhere in Rom. (M. ****{1950a: 195}). Last form by P6. CP (s.v. zanca) report that the word is widespread in the Mediterranean area, and propose a Persian origin. CF by W2.2.
zangar (L LN), kankar (L LN) n. ‘leg’, ‘paw’, ‘calf’, ‘tibia’. + an obscure second element. Second form by P**{15}.
zapatu (B Sout G) n. ‘Saturday’. 1562.

OUO. This final element occurs in the names of several male animals; see examples under ahari, aker and zamari (M. **** BAP 6: {1950b:} 452).
zata (G) n. ‘nightjar, goatsucker’ (zool.) (Caprimulgus europaeus). 1905.
OUO.
zatar (**{c.}) **** n. ****{‘rag’}
zauri (**) **** n. ‘wound, injury’. ****
**** M. (1961a: 318) suggests that this may be an ancient participle in -i [**{see. -i [1] AFS}]. Possibly related to zorne ‘pus’.
zauritu (**), zaurtu (**), zaurthu (**) vt. ‘wound, injure’. **** + -tu VFS.
zazpi (c.) num. ‘seven’. 1571.
OUO. M. (****{1972f: 308 fn. 13}) very diffidently suggests *bortza-z-bi ‘two with five’. This requires the original first syllable to have been lost (questionable), the original form of bortz ‘five’ to have been *bortza (possible; see that entry), the instrumental -z to have been originally a comitative (likely; see that entry), and original biga ‘two’ to have been reduced early to bi (plausible).

xaxpiki (G?) n. ‘baby born two months premature’. + -ki [**{3}] NFS.
ze- Interrogative stem.
OUO. This is one of the two interrogative stems of the language, the other being no-. L and LN exhibit a variant form zo- in certain formations only, esp. when an /n/ follows; this perhaps represents contamination from no- (M. 1961a: 82).

zer [tapped /r/] (c.), ze (B G HN Z) pron. ‘what?’ Possibly contains formative *-r. Short form by P25. Some varieties have specialized the short form for use in certain circumstances, often esp. before a noun or before a following consonant in inflected forms; see A. (1905: s.v. ze) for details. This item takes case-endings normally, except that it requires -ta- indef. {(not in The Dictionary)} in the local cases, as in Loc. zertan ‘in what?’ [ADD SPECIAL USES LIKE ‘thingy’]
ezer [tapped /r/] (c.) pron. ‘anything’ (in negatives and questions: NPI) 15th cent. + e- [2] indefinite. See deus.

zilar (L LN Z R G HN) (1571), zilhar (L LN Z), zirar (old B R) (15th cent.), zidar (B LN R), zildar (G) n. ‘silver’.
OUO. All but the severely localized variant zildar can be derived from *zirar, by P***{24}. Naturally, the word has long been suspected of being linked to the Germanic and Balto-Slavic word represented by English ‘silver’, but nothing can be established. [FHV 549]
zil(h)arbizi (G HN L LN) n. ‘quicksilver, mercury’. 1745. + bizi ‘living’.

zilegi, zillegi (G HN L LN), zilhegi (L) a. ‘licit’, ‘permitted’. Ca. 1660. {FHV 586 corrects the gloss to ‘free, set free’.}
OUO. The form and sense point strongly to a borrowing, but no suitable Rom. form is known. Lat. scīlicet ‘it is permitted to know’ does not look a plausible source, and anyway this word seems not to have survived in Rom. [REWRITE: SEE zil{??}] [CORRECTION: FHV 586]
zilegi izan vi. ‘be permitted’. 1571. + izan ‘be’. In the 16th century, this verb could take a personal subject, as in ez naiz zilegi ‘I am not permitted’. Today it takes only an impersonal subject or a referential third-person subject (a gerund clause in the case of a clausal subject), and an affected person must be expressed in the dative, as in ez zait zilegi ‘it is not permitted to me’.
*zilhetu (old Z) vt. ‘permit’. **** + -tu VFS. Surmised from the imperative zilhet nezazu ‘allow me’ in Sauguis (M. 1961a: 423). {FHV 586 corrects the gloss to ‘set free’.}

The forms with zin- are found in Detxepare. Last form by transfer to the -tu class (M14) plus vowel-height assimilation. Some of the variants are irregular. The variation in diathesis is interesting.

OUO. M. (****{1973a: 154} § 565) notes the modern toponyms Zizur (two occurrences in Navarra; one recorded 1192 as Çiçur) and Zizurkil (Gipuzkoa), plus the medieval toponym Çinçurrçu (1284; near Roncesvalles), and concludes that these contain the same word. He suggests an original *zirzur, yielding *zizur by dissimilation, and this yielding zintzur by P34. He notes without comment the suggestion of Gárate (****{Gárate, J. Eusko-Jakintza 5: 54}) that the original sense was ‘small elevation’. See eztarri.

**** M. (1961{a}: 296) sees this as a dimin. of girten ‘handle’ (see gider), but M. (1977a: 508) rejects this analysis, and suggests that the first element might be zur ‘wood’. The second is oin ‘foot’.

From *zizani, by P1, P20 (M. ****). B form by P65, P51. A. (1905) cites a supposed B *usan, but this is an error resulting from P21 (M. 1961a: 74). ***** The mysterious ikaiñ perhaps by contamination from akain ‘tick’ (M. 1961a: 292 fn. 21). Last two variants puzzling. CP (s.v. gusano) cite, without provenance, a variant zain, not elsewhere recorded. M. (****{1961a: 75 fn. 6}) diffidently suggests a derivation from an unrecorded Rom. *suge-sanguem ‘blood-sucker’, a proposal dismissed by CP as phonologically unacceptable. See zizari.

zori [1] n. (old B) ‘omen’, (today) (B G HN L LN S) ‘luck, fortune’, (c.) ‘propitious moment’, ‘point at which something happens’. 1545.
OUO. It seems clear that the earliest (unrecorded) sense was ‘bird’, and that the sense of the unmodified word shifted to ‘omen’ as a result of the practice of looking for omens in the flight of birds (M. ****{1955a: 275 fn. 4; 1961a: 180 fn. 2}); cf. the shift of Lat.

zu (c. exc. Z), zü (Z) pron. ‘you’ (pl.) (formerly), ‘you’ (sg.) (today). 14th cent.
OUO. It is clear that this pronoun was originally strictly plural, contrasting with singular hi. This is shown by the fact that it invariably requires plural agreement in a finite verb, in a way entirely parallel to gu ‘we’: (ni) nator ‘I’m coming’, (hi) hator ‘you (marked sg.) are coming’, (gu) gatoz ‘we’re coming’ (with absolutive plural -z), (zu) zatoz ‘you’re coming’. Moreover, A. (****{1905-6: 2.466}) reports that, in his day, there were still places in Bizkaia where zu was in use as a plural pronoun. {Actually Azkue says that in his childhood he and other children used the expression ene kaderak, ariñ egizu, in which zu is understood as plural, rather than ...egizue.} But the entire historical period otherwise shows this only as the unmarked singular pronoun, contrasting with the now marked singular hi, and the singular use is the only one found in speech today. The plural sense has been taken over by zuek (below). [MORE IN AZKUE UNDER ZER-]
z- Absolutive agreement prefix in finite verbs with zu, as in (zu) zatoz ‘you are coming’. Presumably by incorporation of the free pronoun.
z...e or z...te (c.) Discontinuous absolutive agreement prefix in finite verbs with zuek. Constructed by adding to z- (above) a further plural marker, variously -e [2] or -te [2{3}] {(neither in The Dictionary)}, according to verb and variety.
zeu (B LN) (1617), zuhaur (LN) (1545), zerori (G) (1617), zuhaurrori (LN) pron. ‘you yourself’ (intensive). First two + haur ‘this’, third + hori ‘that’, last + both.
zeuek (1617), zerok (G HN) (1636), zeurok (B) (1571), zuihauek, zuhaurrek (1902), xaur- (R) ‘you yourselves’ (intensive). + plural of haur ‘this’.
-zu (c. exc. Z), -zü (Z) Ergative and dative agreement suffix in finite verbs with zuk, zuri, ergative and dative respectively of zu. Presumably by incorporation of the free pronoun.
-zue (c.) Ergative and dative agreement marker in finite verbs with zuek, zuei, ergative and dative respectively of zuek. Constructed by adding to -zu (above) a further plural marker -e [2] {not in The Dictionary}.
zuek (c.), zuiek (old LN), ziek (**), xek (R), uek (R) pron. ‘you’ (pl.) 1545. Second variant by P58. + -k [1] plural. Constructed to provide a new pl. pronoun when the original zu became a polite sg.



380 R. L. Trask
zuen (c.) ‘your’ (pl.) Genitive case-form of zuek. + -en {[1]} genitive. This form takes the historically regular genitive ending -en, as opposed to zure (below), the genitive of zu, which takes the archaic genitive -e [1], as is usual with personal pronouns.
zuka (c.) adv. ‘using the pronoun zu’, TS n. ‘use of the pronoun zu’. + -ka AdvFS. It is common for adverbs in -ka to be reinterpreted as nouns.
zuketa (c.) n. ‘the use of the pronoun zu’. + -keta NFS of activity {not in The Dictionary}.
zure (c.) ‘your’. Genitive case-form of zu. + -e [1] genitive.
{-zu (c.) Indefinite pl. suffix. See -tsu.}
zuku (**) n. ‘broth, soup’, ‘juice’. ****
From Lat. {sūcum ~} succum **** ‘juice’.
zulo (B G HN) (1562), zilo (L LN B) (1627), zílo (Z), zillo (HN? LN?), zulho (L LN), zilho (L LN) n. ‘hole’. CF zula-. Dimin. (HN LN Z R) xilo, (Z) xílo.
OUO. Apparently from *zuLo, by P**{23}. CF by W2.2. The second variant is curious, but perhaps by back-formation from the dimin. The northern variant zilho takes the collective NFS -eta in the surname Zilhoeta ~ Zilhueta ‘(place with) the holes’, which enters Fr. as Silhouette, the name of the French finance minister from which English silhouette ultimately derives. M.(1977a: 481) tells us that only zul(h)o occurs in medieval toponyms.
zulatu (**) vt. ‘dig’. 1562. + -tu VFS.
zulodun (**) a. ‘full of holes’, ‘leaky’ (of a vessel). 1745. + -dun ‘having’ (see *edun).
zumar (B G HN L) (1745, 1847), zuhar (L LN) (1833), zugar (HN L A S), zuar (HN), zunhar (LN) (1657), zǘnhar (Z) (though Gèze gives zunhar) n. ‘elm’ (bot.) (Ulmus).
From *zunar, OUO, by P2 in the common form, by P1, P35.1 elsewhere (M. 1961a: 317). This in turn may perhaps derive from *zurar, an apparent derivative of zur ‘wood’ (ibid.). The restoration of the /n/ in the last form is extraordinary.
*-zun (c.) Apparent suffix.
Not attested as a single form, but seemingly present in two compound suffixes: -kizun (see -ki [**]) and -tarzun (see -tar).
zuntz (HN L LN) n. ‘thread, strand, fibre’. 1627?, 1745, 1759.
OUO.
zupu (**), zuphu (**) n. ‘ditch’, ‘well’. ****
Possibly a metathesis of putzu ‘well’ (M. 1961a: 297).

The Native Lexicon
This section presents all of the apparently native and monomorphemic lexical items which can plausibly be assigned to the most ancient stratum of the lexicon. Each item is presented in the earliest form which can be reconstructed for it. The abbreviation ‘NLR’ means that no ancient and monomorphemic lexicalization of the given sense can be recovered for PreBasque: all attested words are obvious loans, obvious expressive formations, or obvious compounds or derivatives, or else the sense is not lexicalized in Basque at all. {To the English-Basque list, missing items have been added, in { }, from the Basque-English list, and vice versa.}
