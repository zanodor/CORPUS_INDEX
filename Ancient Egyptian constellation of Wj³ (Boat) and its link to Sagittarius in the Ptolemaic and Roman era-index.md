Ancient Egyptian constellation of WjA (Boat) and its link to Sagittarius in the Ptolemaic and Roman era
José Lull – Barcelona Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona – IEPOA
[The Boat was one of the few Egyptian constellations represented in the astronomical ceilings, which indicates the importance that it could have on the Egyptian thought. With the information we have we can identify with certainty not only some of the stars of the constellation but also the extension that it had in the sky. Throughout the centuries, the Boat continued to be showed in astronomical ceilings and other documents but from the Ptolemaic era, with the introduction of the zodiacal constellations of Mesopotamian origin, the Boat lost prominence and finally disappeared. However, if we look closely at the iconography of GraecoRoman era, we see that the Egyptian constellation of the Boat, understated and almost unnoticed, was associated with Sagittarius, constellation that occupied its most important part.] Keywords: Wia, Sagittarius, Boat, zodiacal constellations, decans, Egypt, astronomical ceiling.
1. Introduction
During the Pharaonic history only a small group of constellations1 were represented by the ancient Egyptians. In the oldest representations we know from some coffins of the late First Intermediate Period (ca. 4000 years ago), along with a long list of decans2 generally we only find representations of Egyptian constellations as Sah , Sepedet , and Meskhetyu , perfectly located in Orion-Lepus3, Canis Maior (with Sirius as reference), and Ursa Maior, respectively. The only exception is the missing coffin of Heny4, XI Dynasty, which probably had an iconography similar to that of the astronomical ceilings. During the New Kingdom, however, astronomical ceilings offer a wider space for figures and inscriptions, so a good set of constellations and other figures were depicted along with decans lists.

For the northern sky the number of constellations represented in an astronomical ceiling is relatively high: Meskhetyu , Anu , Serqet , Isis-Djamet (identifiable with the Reret of the Ramesside star clocks5), perhaps Menit6 , Saq , ¡tp rdwy “restful of feet” , NTr rwty jmj.snwy “divine lion who is between them” (identifiable with the “lion” mAj of the Ramesside star clocks, and equivalent with the zodiacal Leo)7, and the anonimous harpooner (corresponding to our Gemini, if it is not a figuration of the vast constellation of Nekhet )8 (Figure 1). However, for the southern sky there are very few constellations represented in astronomical ceilings or related documents: Sah and Sepedet (also present in the coffins of the First Intermediate Period), Stwy the “Two turtles" (constellation formed possibly by the stars of Canis minor Procyon and Gomeisa)9, the asterism known as (perhaps the Hyades10 open star cluster around Aldebaran, or even a figuration of the Pleiades11), sjt “Sheep” and, finally, the constellation of WjA the “Boat” , which is what concerns us in this paper (Figure 2). The fact that very few southern constellations were represented can be an indicator of the importance they may have had for their symbolism or easy visualization by the ancient Egyptians in the sky. Such must be the case of WjA, the constellation of the “Boat”.
2. The Decans of the Boat in the Tomb of Senenmut
The astronomical ceiling of the tomb TT 353 belonging to the noble Senenmut12 (ca. 1460 B.C.), is the oldest that has come to us, predating even the examples we know from the Valley of the Kings. In this example, the constellation of the Boat is the first that is represented in the southern sky. The Boat is showed unmanned, with a symmetrical prow and stern (relatively similar to sign P28), with five stars arranged in a row immediately above the boat, and two in its deck. The Boat is placed under six columns (columns 7-12) in which some decans are listed, so they can serve to identify the approximate position of the constellation (Figure 3).

In the sixth column of the ceiling of Senenmut, column apparently precedent to the linked to
the representation of the Boat, the decans are &pj-a xntt “predecesor of Khentet” (decan number 10) and xntt Hrt “upper Khentet” (decan number 11). The tenth decan announces a star located west of Khentet, but the eleventh marks the beginning of Khentet, which continues in the following columns. As we shall see, if “lower Khentet” (decan 12) and the “red of Khentet” (decan 13) belong to the Boat, it is also fair to assume that “upper Khentet” is part of the same constellation.

In the seventh column of the southern panel of the astronomical ceiling of Senenmut, in the first of the columns apparently linked to the constellation of the Boat, the decan mentioned is xntt Xrt “lower Khentet” (decan 12), followed in the eighth column by Tms n xntt the “red (star) of Khentet” (decan 13). Is Khentet a part of the constellation of the Boat? Most likely so, considering that two of the three decans that are part of Khentet are above the representation of the Boat. Moreover, the meaning of Khentet can provide a better approach to this problem. The word xnt is translated as “front”, “brow”13. As preposition xnt means “out
of”, “among from”, “in front of”14, etc. Given that the constellation we are dealing with is a boat and the regular movement of the sky is from east to west, it is opportune to find the prow of the boat facing the west, that is, following the movement of the sky. Therefore, we can assume that xntt (written or ) can refer to the front of the boat, its prow. Jones15, in his comprehensive study of Egyptian nautical terminology also proposed that possibility, although in Egyptian texts we do not known with certainty any case in which the prow of a boat is called xntt. The fact that a constellation shaped like a boat can be divided into other depending on the parts of the craft has a curious parallel in our sky: Argo Navis (the ship of Jason and the Argonauts in Greek mythology) a constellation described among the 48 cited by Claudius Ptolemy in the

Almagest. This constellation had a great extent, so that in the eighteenth century was divided into three other constellations by French astronomer Lacaille: Carina (the keel), Puppis (the stern) and Velas (the sail). In this case, the stern of Argo Navis is situated west, therefore, contrary to the direction of rotation of the sky. However, regarding Egyptian WjA there is a trait that should not be neglected. Argo Navis is located on the Milky Way, which acts as a celestial river. The Egyptian boat, too. An Egyptian boat in the most prominent part of the Milky Way is a very significant matter from a symbolic point of view, because we must not forget that in the Egyptian conception is quite possible that the celestial goddess Nut could be found in the Milky Way16. Consider, as seen in religious compendiums as the Books of the Hereafter, that through the body of Nut the solar boat sails with his entourage. Therefore, the Milky Way could also be seen by the ancient Egyptians as a celestial river, so nothing more appropriate to place the constellation of the Boat in one of the places where the Milky Way is more prominent. As it is known, Neugebauer and Parker17, despite its enormous effort to approach the Egyptian astronomy through its Egyptian Astronomical Texts, they dispensed any attempt to search for equivalence between decans and current stars. However, this is possible, as J. A. Belmonte and I have shown in recent works even originally using different methods. The fact that three decans are cited as parts of Khentet indicates that it should have an important extension. We must remember that the decans served as hour markers and roughly three decans may include three hours of Right Ascension (R.A.). Leitz18, studying the decans lists coffins of the First Intermediate and Middle Kingdom Period, concluded that these three decans of Khentet (xntt Hrt “upper Khentet”, xntt Xrt “lower Khentet” and Tms n xntt ”the red (star) of Khentet”) should be γ Lupi, ζ Scorpii, and ε Scorpii, respectively. However, in my opinion, only one of the decans of Khentet is identifiable with its current counterpart with complete certainty. As I showed19, Tms n xntt ”the red (star) of Khentet ” should be equivalent, without any kind of doubt, not to the star Wei (ε Sco), as indicated Leitz, but to Antares (α Sco), a red giant star that stands out for its brightest and its reddish color in that region of the sky. In fact, the color index20 B-V of Wei is 1.14, and its apparent magnitude 2.28, while for Antares color index is 1.86 (redder) and its apparent magnitude 1.03 (brighter)21. Stars that we can see red to the naked eye are not many. And, if we take a list of stars under visual magnitude 3.5, only Betelgeuse and 34-μ UMa Tania Australis (B-V: 2.0, spectrum M0, visual magnitude 3.1) have a B-V index higher than Antares. Moreover, in Egyptian texts there are very few cases in which a star is distinguished by its color22.

The accurate identification of the “red (star) of Khentet” with Antares23 is essential as a starting point for positioning with better guarantees the constellation of the Boat, although the correspondence of most of their decans with current stars can only be approximate. Both upper Khentet and lower Khentet must be situated, necessarily, west of Antares, so both decans must be located most likely somewhere in the strip occupied by Libra, or even in neighboring constellations that share the same A.R., depending on how the constellation of the Boat will be reflected on the Egyptian imagination. The ninth column of the astronomical ceiling of Senenmut includes the fourteenth decan, sApty xnwy “Sapty Khenwy”. This should relate to that which in the First Intermediate Period is called xnwj “(two) Khenwy-fishes” although the latter is preceded by another decan, qdty which is not mentioned in the ceiling of Senenmut. Three main clues can be used for the identification of sApty xnwy “Sapty Khenwy” in the sky: on the one hand, we know that it is east of Antares, in the eastern part of Scorpius or with an equivalent R.A; on the other hand, in the case of the “(two) khenwy-fishes” they may be sought within the celestial river of the Milky Way; and finally, the fact that two fish are concerned suggests two stars close together. With this in mind, we can suggest the very possible identification of Khenwi with Shaula (λ Sco) and Lesath (υ Sco), two prominent stars very close together (36'), which form the sting of Scorpius. In the next column, finally, the constellation of the Boat is introduced through Hry-jb wjA “(the star) which is in the middle of the boat” (decan 15). For Leitz24, the decan must match the star Nunki (σ Sagittarii). In my opinion, however, a good option could be Kaus Australis (ε Sgr), the brightest star in the constellation of Sagittarius and closer, comparing with Nunki, to the brightest part of the Milky Way in this region. Moreover, this identification would fit better with the fact that, as we shall see later in the zodiac of Esna, Hry-jb wjA is linked to the western third of Sagittarius, and Kaus Australis lies at that end. The next decan, in the next column, is sSmw which can be translated as “guides”. The “guides” can refer to the pilots of the Boat. Recall, for example, that while the fifth hour of the night is called “which is in the middle of his boat” in the Book of Nut25 or in the first division of the Book of Imiduat, the fifth hour of the Book of Imiduat receives the full name of sSmyt-Hrt-jb-wjA.s,
“(she who) guides, in the middle of his boat”26. Therefore, and since this decan is over the figure of the Boat, it is clear that is also part of it. Since the “guides” should be formed by a group of three or more stars, the equatorial coordinates lead us, east of Kaus Australis, to the group composed of 27-φ Sagitarii, Nunki (34-σ Sagittarii) and Ascella (38-θ Sagittarii).

Finally, above the figure of the Boat a last column appears in the astronomical ceiling of Senenmut with the decan Knmw (decan 17). The decan may correspond to the group of stars around Albaldah (41π Sagittarii) as 39-ο Sgr, 37-ξ Sgr or 44-ρ Sgr, further east. Chatley27 proposed that the stars represented among Knmw and the next decan, &pj-a smd “which is before Semed”, could symbolize the Milky Way although this hypothesis does not seem to correspond with what we would see in the sky, because the showiest part of the Milky Way is precisely that runs through the constellation of the Boat, between Sagittarius and Scorpius.
3. Extension of the Boat and Identification of its Decans
The so-called rectangular zodiacs of the Ptolemaic era offers us a clue to confirm the area of the Boat. In Esna28, the date of manufacture of the rectangular zodiac is situated around 200 B.C. In it the zodiacal constellations are divided into three sectors each. These sectors, totaling 36 in all, are related to the decans. The list of Esna is related to the list of decans of the so called “family of Seti I B” and the “family of Tanis”, as was catalogued by Neugebauer and Parker. In the table reproduced below I include only the decans of the Seti I B list, starting from Cancer with spdt, Sirius:

does not necessarily mean that these decans are found within the space covered by these zodiacal constellations, but are for sure in the same R.A. that the corresponding thirds of those constellations (observe the case of Sepedet-Sirius, associated with the western third of the constellation of Cancer). That is, those decans may or may not be located in Libra and Scorpius, but they must have equivalent coordinates in R.A. In the zodiac of Esna, “the red (star) of Khentet” appears as the central decan of Scorpius. Obviously, recognizing the equivalence of Antares with the decan, the place where we expect to find this decan is just where it is, the abdomen of the scorpion in the center of the constellation, just as if we identify %ptj xnwy with Shaula and Lesath, stars that in the eastern third of Scorpius form the sting of the scorpion. Knmw decan (decan 17), in accordance with what is indicated in the zodiac of Esna, is the most eastern of Sagittarius. This confirms what we advanced above, ie, that it can match the group of stars that are around Albaldah (41-π Sagittarii), or 44-ρ Sgr, since it is the last prominent group of stars in the eastern third of Sagittarius. As we have seen, the entire constellation of the Boat, assuming that Khentet can be translated as “bow” and therefore is part of it, would be constituted by decans located between Libra, Scorpius and Sagittarius, mainly on one of the most prominent areas of the Milky Way (figure 4). However, the core of the Boat remains in Sagittarius, because as written in previous lines in this constellation would be the decans Hry-jb wjA “(the star) which is in the middle of the boat”, sSmw “guides” and Knmw. Neither the Boat nor any of the decans who were part of it, mentioned in diagonals stellar clocks and lists of decans of the astronomical ceilings, were included in the Ramessides stellar tables29, where the vast constellation of Nekhet served as new reference in this R.A. The decans which were part of the constellation of the Boat are the decans 11-17 (ie, from xntt Hrt to Knmw) with &py-a xntt as precedent decan to the bow of the boat and &pj-a smd as following decan of its stern.

The astronomical ephemeris provided by the Book of Nut30 (whose original title was precisely “Fundamentals of the course of the stars”31), are equally interesting to point out or confirm a little more the identification of some of the decans that make up the constellation of the Boat, because they offer the possibility of deducing the approximate distance between them (in R.A.) and the time the decans were useful as time markers (figure 5).
As chronological reference we must take into account the data presented for the star Sirius:
“[Decan Sepedet]: First hour, III akhet 6. Encased by duat, II peret 6. Birth, IV peret 16”.
This data is crucial to understand that the decanal ephemeris provided by the Book of Nut are copies of some older we should date in the XII Dynasty32. Antares could serve as a marker of the first hour of the night in late June or early July 1830 B.C., when it was crossing the central meridian at a height of almost 54o from the latitude of

Lull, La astronomía en el antiguo Egipto, 125. The heliacal rising of Sirius is said to have happened in IV peret 16 (which coincides with the date provided by p. Berlin 10012 for year 7 of Senusert III). This means that the decanal transit clock of Seti I do not have the slightest functional sense for its time, because it obviously is a copy of another that was useful during the reign of Senusret III, c. 1830 B.C.; In this sense, it is interesting to note that Von Lieven concludes that the Book of Nut traces its origin to the Old Kingdom.

Thebes. Taking as a starting point Antares, taking it as the equivalent of Tms n xntt, we can propose the following equivalents of the decans of the constellation of the Boat:
Table 4: Proposed equivalents of the decans of the constellation of the Boat
We can conclude, therefore, that the ancient Egyptian constellation of the Boat extended, with very high probability, from the constellation of Libra to Sagittarius.
4. The Boat in other Astronomical Ceilings
The order of decans between &py-a xntt and knmw, as we have seen in the astronomical ceiling
of Senenmut, is repeated33 not only in other cases of the so called “family of Senenmut” but also in other families of decans34, adding tens of known examples. Therefore, we can deduce that this is a well-defined error-free list. The clepsydra of Amenhetep III35, found in Karnak in 1904 (Cairo JE 37525) shows in its external decoration a list of decans that, for the linkable to the Boat, repeats the same list (in fact, this example belongs also to the “Senenmut family”). Even being one of the oldest examples of lists that we know in the New Kingdom is about a subsequent century to the Senenmut one. The oldest preserved astronomical ceiling, after the one of Senenmut, is found in the burial chamber of Seti I (KV 17) in the Valley of the Kings. In this example the Boat was represented in a different way to that of Senenmut. Bow and Stern are no longer symmetrical but similar in style to the sign P30; and the Boat does not appear unmanned but with Isis, Nephthys, Seth and Horus on board. Above these deities 6 stars are shown in a row, while in the hull of the ship were located

other three. The decans of the Boat are in Seti I36 the same as those described in the case of the tomb of Senenmut. Similarly, the preceding and following decan coincide. In the astronomical ceiling of the Ramesseum37, the Boat is similar to that of Seti I, while changing the surrounding decorative elements. No crew but a disc inside with two streams of circular elements, which is like on that roof the stars are shown instead of the usual five-pointed. On the other hand, a row of larger dots, but smaller than the rest of the surrounding stars, joins the bow and stern of the boat. The astronomical ceiling of the Ramesseum repeats the same decans of Senenmut and Seti I, with the exception of the one which is before the Boat, because here is sAtj bkAtj instead of &pj-a xntt. It should be noted that the decan Kenmu appears here within the box in which the representation of the Boat is included. Taking a leap in time, from the XXV Dynasty we can cite the example of the newly discovered astronomical ceiling of the tomb of Karakhamun (TT223), which must be included in the “family of Senenmut”38. As for the iconography of the Boat (Figure 6) it has a row of dots reduced in size starting from the middle of the bow and interrupted halfway to the stern. This row has its first example in the Ramesseum, although in that case is more complete. With dotted lines it was also set up a kind of basis on which the boat rests. This base is perfectly represented in the decoration of the coffin of Harendotes (BM 6678), a priest of the god Amun who lived in the time of Ptolemy III. In the case of Karakhamun, the decans remaining within the limits occupied by the representation of the Boat are from number 10 (&py-a xntt) to 17 (Knmw).
Two other comparable examples are those of the tomb of Montuemhat39 (TT34) and the tomb of Pedamenope40 (TT33), from the XXVI Dynasty (Figure 7). In both, the decan xntt Hrt is unrelated to the box in which the Boat is showed. Instead, &pj-a smd is included among the related decans. In both examples, the design of the boat is the same. In the case of Montuemhat we can see a row of dots from the bow to the stern, in the same style mentioned in the example of Karakhamun and the Ramesseum. In addition, in the middle of the boat, on the deck, a bigger star is just in the vertical of the decan Hry-jb wjA, so we can suggest that it represents this decan. Instead, in the tomb of Pedamenope the row of dots and the central star does not appear. An even later example is the burial chamber of the tomb of Queen Khenuwa41 (South Begrawiyah 503) from the initial Meroitic period (third century B.C.). It offers the same set of decans related to the Boat.
5. The Boat associated with Sagittarius during the Ptolemaic and Roman Era
As we have seen, the constellation of the Boat should cover the eastern third of Libra and the constellations of Scorpius and Sagittarius. However, the part belonging to Sagittarius should be the most important of the Boat, for “the (star) which is in the middle of Boat” and “guides” stood in it, in the brightest part of the Milky Way. His representation throughout the centuries, one of the few

southern constellations which enjoyed such honor, somehow can also indicate the importance of this constellation for the Egyptians. However, during the Ptolemaic era a notable change occurs in the Egyptian heaven: the zodiacal constellations of Mesopotamian origin are introduced. With this change the ancient Egyptian constellations occupying the zodiacal band were eliminated in favor of the new constellations or, at best, minimized. This last option is what must have happened in the case of the constellation of the Boat. At the begining of the Ptolemaic era the coffin of Harendotes (BM 6678) is one of the latest examples to show the list of decans with the old representation of the Boat. In fact, it was cataloged by Parker and Neugebauer as the last exponent of the “family of Senenmut”42. With the new zodiacal constellations the sky of the Egyptians had significant changes. In the case of the former Boat constellation, it was associated, minimized, to the constellation of Sagittarius. This can be checked even in the zodiac of Dendera, from the mid-first century B.C. In it we see that at the foot of Sagittarius it was represented a small boat (Figure 8), just as in the rectangular zodiac of the western part of the roof of the pronaos of the same temple, or in the rectangular zodiac Esna (where the boat appears not under the Sagittarius forelegs but under the hind legs). It could be argued, following the Mul-Apin (Mesopotamian astronomical tables from the seventh century B.C.) that the boat associated with Sagittarius corresponds to Mul-Ma-gur or Makurru43, the “load boat” which could correspond to the star ε Sagittarii or to the constellation of Corona Australis. In fact, in the zodiac of Dendera we find other parazodiacal constellations of likely Mesopotamian origin44. Aubourg45 and Cauville46, however, identify this boat with the constellation of Corona Australis (CrA), appointed by Claudius Ptolemy as Στεφάνοςνοτιος (“Southern wreath”). However, keep in mind that the stars of this constellation are not at all bright and prominent. Both β CrA (Alphecca meridiana) as β CrA are stars of apparent magnitude 4.1. Although in ancient times the stars of CrA could be associated with Sagittarius (the Mesopotamian Mul Pa-bil-sag), as well as a boat, as well as a crown or garland according to Mesopotamian or Greco-Roman tradition, in my opinion, the small boat that is associated with Saggitarius in ancient Egyptian documents is wjA (the Boat), constellation that far from being
eliminated by the introduction of Sagittarius was associated with it in the iconography47. The introduction of the Mesopotamian “load boat” in the zodiac of Dendera could be perfectly assumed in the Egyptian conception being transmitted iconographically as wjA associated with Sagittarius. In Roman times, finally, the constellation of Sagittarius will prevail, making the Boat disappear. This can be seen in the coffin of Soter (BM 6705) and in the coffin of Petemenophis (Louvre E 13048), both from the early second century A.D. (time of emperor Trajan)48. Around the

figure of Nut there were represented the zodiacal constellations, with no trace of the original Egyptian constellations. The same is observed in the zodiacs of several tombs of el-Salamuni, all from Roman times. However, we still find some examples in which the ancient Egyptian constellation of the Boat remains associated with Sagittarius. Such is the case of the coffin of Heter49 from the end of the first century A.D. now disappeared. The coffin of Kleopatra (BM 6706)50, even with a similar dating (in fact, she was daughter of Soter and sister Petemenophis), also shows a stylized boat below Sagittarius. Also, for example, it can be seen this association in the tomb of the brothers Ibpameny and Pamehit in Athribis51, from the late second century A.D. (Figure 9). From the third century A.D. onward the Egyptian constellation of the Boat disappeared.
