Monkeys, apes, langurs -- Indus Script hieroglyphs signify wealth resources
-- Monkey, ape, langur hieroglyphs signify wealth resources of gems, jewels, armoury, alloy metal work. रत्नी ratnī 'monkey dressed as a woman' is a unique category which signifies gems, jewels, treasure.
--Musri (with Muzuri, Mussouri Kurds), a Meluhha settlement of Ancient Kurdistan offered tributes to Shalamaneser III
-- I have called the Black Obelisk Scene 3 as the Rosetta Stone for Indus Script has been found. It is Shalamaneser III Black Obelisk of Nimrud 825 BCE https://tinyurl.com/yxarbsve
--The tributes offered to Shalamaneser III and inscribed on the Black Obelisk, by Musri are Indus Script hieroglyphs which have been deciphered, read rebus as wealth resources offered as tributes.
--I submit that Musri was a Meluhha settlement and hence Indus Script hieroglyphs used on Scene 3 of the Black Obelisk signify rebus Meluhha readings of wealth resources offered as tributes. -- Anzu's true identity; true location & identity of Musri mentioned in Scene 3 of the Black Obelisk
The monograph is presented in the following sections:
Section 1. Triple monkey figurine amulet with hole in center
Section 2. Ape figurines
Section 3. Four types of wealth resource tributes: 1. monkey, 2. ape, 3. langur and 4. रत्नी ratnī 'monkey dressed as a woman'
Section 4. Blue monkey frescoes of Akrotiri, Greece

Of all the objects in the National Museum of Pakistan's Indus Gallery in Karachi, none quite so grabs your attention with its innate character as this tiny faience monkey from Mohenjodaro. Just over 3 cm in height, made of blue-green faience, probably in a wooden mold according to Mark Kenoyer (Ancient Cities, p. 230), it arrests you with the richness of its persona through the glass casing. It seems to have its character pushed from the inside out, so regal is it in the surrounding space. Broken feet suggest it might have once been part of a triple monkey figurine. John Marshall wrote "The monkey is now extinct in Sind, but that it existed there in ancient times is suggested by the fact that models of it are found in Mohenjodaro made in faience, pottery, and steatite. It is always represented in a squatting position with a hand on each knee." (Marshall 1931: 349, 351, pl. XCVI, 13). https://www.harappa.com/blog/indus-monkey-figurine

Five scenes wrap around the Obelisk. They each depict tribute TT exacted from a vassal TT , who is named in a cuneiform TT caption. The tribute includes exotic animals such as camels, monkeys, an elephant and a rhinoceros. Assyrian kings often collected exotic animals and plants as an expression of their power. It is thought that the vassals shown here are chosen to demonstrate the geographical bounds of the empire, from east to west. The Black Obelisk also has a longer inscription, which tells of Shalmaneser's achievements in more detail
Our interest is on Scene 3 of the five scenes of the Obelisk. This scene lists tributes from Musri. Muṣri, meaning 'borderland', probably refers to a country far to the east -- perhaps from Hindanu province (which is east of the Musasir mountains) or further east from Meluhha.

The most remarkable hieroglyph among the four monkey on Scene 3 (Sides C&D) is a monkey dressed as a woman. There is a Meluhha expression which explains this hieroglyph and renders it rebus as a wealth resource offered a a tribute to Shalamaneser III
This Scene 3 with four sides is explained: "I received tribute from Muṣri: two-humped camels, a water buffalo TT , a rhinoceros, an antelope, female elephants, female monkeys and apes."

Side D: More "monkeys" and their keepers from Muṣri. The way the monkeys are carved suggests that the sculptor had not seen them himself. This may not be the case, however. Monkeys were not new sights for the Assyrian court at this time.
What is referred to as a 'rhinoceros' is in fact the 'unicorn' or one-horned young bull which is often shown on Indus Script Meluhha inscriptions.
Water buffalo is a large cattle with huge horns which spend a lot of time in rivers and marshes, and eat reeds and other aquatic plants. They are very strong and docile draft animals, and produce highly nutritious milk. Water buffalos probably originate in India but there have been significant populations in southern Iraq since at least the third millennium BCE. I suggest that this is a water-buffalo, an Indus Script hieroglyph.
I submit that the animals shown on all the four sides of Scene 3 of the Obelisk are Indus Script hieroglyphs.
How can four monkeys and other animals constitute tributes to Shalamaneser III? Indus Script decipherment provides the explanation; the monkeys and other animals are hieroglyphs which signify Meluhha rebus readings of specific wealth resources produced by Meluhha artisans and settlers of Musri (Muzuri, Mussouri Kurds), north Kurdistan. Evidence of Meluhha settlers in Mari is well attested by the procession which carries the 'unicorn' on flagstaff. The same one-horned animal appears on Scene 3 of Shalamaneser III Black Obelisk Scene 3 (one of four sides) -- Anzu's true identity; true location & identity of Musri mentioned in Scene 3 of the Black Obelisk One of the most intriguing facts of the Black Obelisk of Shalamaneser III, 825 BCE

Here is a slide -- Executive Summary -- deciphering the Black Obelisk (British Museum) of tributes from Musri to Shalamaneser III shown on Row 2 panels, including a translation of the Cuneiform text. All are Indus Script hieroglyphs; all the animals and curious form of monkey dressed like a woman signify metalwork and gem/jewel resources as TRIBUTES to the Assyrian King. Location of Musri is likely to be in Kurdistan with Meluhha settlers (now Yezidi who follow Hindu customs of wearing bindi, venerate peacock etc.) Explains why animals shown on Indus Script inscriptions including the most famous 'unicorn' which is forward-thrusting, spiny-horned young bull hieroglyph read in Meluhha: singhi koNDa rebus: singi 'ornament gold' kunda 'fine gold' koNDa 'furnace, sacred fire-altar'. Nativity of doublehumped camel in Ladakh-Kashmir is proved by such a camel existing even today as a tourist attraction in Nubra valley. See image.

[quote] How we solved the Greek monkey mystery – and found an important clue to Bronze Age world.The blue monkeys painted on the walls of Akrotiri on the Greek island of Santorini are among many animals found in the frescoes of this 3,600-year-old city. Historians have studied the murals for decades since they were unearthed in the 1960s and 1970s on the island, which was once known as Thera. But when we and a team of other primatologists recently examined the paintings, we realised the monkeys could provide a clue that the Bronze Age world was much more globalised than previously thought. Archaeologists had assumed the monkeys were an African species, with which the Aegean people that built Akrotiri probably came into contact via trade links with Egypt. But we think the paintings actually depict Hanuman langurs, a species from the Indian subcontinent. This suggests the Aegean people, who came from Crete and the Cycladic islands in the Aegean Sea, may have had trade routes that reached over 2,500 miles.
The wall paintings of Akrotiri were preserved by ash from a volcano that destroyed the city some time in the 16th or 15th century BC and offer an incredible glimpse of an early



17
civilisation in Europe. We haven’t been able to translate the earliest Aegean writing, but the paintings suggest just how developed these people’s society, economy and culture were.
Much animal art from this period is generalised, meaning it’s hard to confidently identify individual species. In the case of the monkeys, we also don’t have any physical remains from Aegean settlements to provide additional evidence of which species are depicted.
The reason why archaeologists and art historians have assumed they came from Egypt is because that was the nearest location with an indigenous monkey population that had known trade links with the Aegean. As a result, the Akrotiri monkeys have been variously identified as baboons, vervets and grivet monkeys, all African species that live across a wide area.
Marie Pareja decided to take a different approach, gathering a team of primatologists who study apes, monkeys, and lemurs, including renowned taxonomic illustrator Stephen Nash. Together, we examined photos of the art and discussed the animals depicted, considering not only fur colour and pattern but also body size, limb proportions, sitting and standing postures, and tail position. While we all agreed that some of the animals depicted were baboons, as previously thought, we began to debate the identification of the animals from one particular scene.Identifying the langurs.
The monkeys in the paintings are grey-blue. But although some living monkeys have small patches of blue skin – the blue on a mandrill’s face, for example – none have blue fur. There is an African forest monkey called the blue monkey, but it is mainly olive or dark grey, and the face patterns don’t match those in the paintings. So we needed to use other characteristics to identify them. They were previously believed to be vervets or grivets, small monkeys weighing between 3kg and 8kg (roughly the size of a housecat) that are found in the savannas of north and east Africa. Despite their silvery white fur, they also have dark-coloured hands and feet and an overall look that matches the depictions in the paintings. However, Hanuman langurs, which weigh a more substantial 11kg to 18kg, have a similar look. They also move quite differently, and this was crucial to the identification. Both primates primarily live on the ground (as opposed to in trees) and have long limbs and tails. But the langurs tend to carry their tail upward, as an S- or C-shape or curving towards the head, while vervet monkeys carry their tail in a straight line or arcing downward. This tail position, repeated across multiple images, was a key factor in identifying the monkeys as Hanuman langurs.

We know from archaeological evidence that Aegean peoples had access to minerals such as tin, lapis lazuli and carnelian that came from beyond the Zagros mountains on the western border of modern Iran. But the artistic detail of the Akrotiri paintings, compared to other monkey art of the period, suggests that the artists had seen live animals, perhaps while travelling abroad. It’s understandable that earlier scholars thought the monkeys were African since relations between the Aegean and Egypt were already well known and supported by archaeological evidence. If you expect to find an African monkey, you will only look at African animals for possible explanations. But as primatologists, we were able to bring a fresh look at the evidence without preconceived notions of ancient peoples or trade routes, and consider species living further afield. This study is an excellent example of the importance of academics from different disciplines working together. Without the expertise of primatologists, it may not have been possibly to confidently identify these animals. Conversely, primatologists may not have considered these ancient human-primate interactions without a prompt from .aarchaeologists.

High-relief decoration on the body of a BMAC copper/bronze cosmetic vial (Aftter Sarianidi, V., 1994, Aegean-Anatolian Motifs in the Glyptic Art of Bactria and Margiana, Bulletin of the Asia Institute 8: 27-36, Fig. 7)
The hieroglyphs depicted are: 1. tabernae montana fragrant flower; 2. ibex/markhor/ram seated on a stool; 3. boar; 4. monkey (with dagger); 5. monkey (with ingot) in front of a storage jar; 6. squirrel (looking up); 7. Squirrel with a drink vial; 8. bar of metal on a stool
This pictorial narrative on a copper/bronze cosmetic vial of BMAC is discussed by Eric Olidjam. I explain the hieroglyphs on this narrative as Indus Script Hypertexts which signify wealth-accounting ledgers, metalwork catalogues.

बिुतेद र or बिुत (p. 567) [ balutēdāra or balutā ] or त्य m (बिुतें &c.) A public servant of a
village entitled to बिुतें. There are twelve distinct from the regular
Governmentofficers प टीि,ु र्ळर्रणी &c.; viz. सुत र, िोह र, मह र, म ांग (These four
constitute पनहिी or थोरिी र् स or िळ the first division. Of three of them each is entitled
to ि र प िुांदे, twenty bundles of Holcus or the thrashed corn, and
the मह र to आठ प िुांदे);ुां र्भ र , ि म्ह र , परीट, न्ह िी constitute दुसरी or मधिी र् स or िळ, and are entitled, each, to तीि प िुांदे; भट, मुि ण , गुरि, र्ोळी form नतसरी or ध र्टी र् स or िळ, and have, each, दोि प िुांदे. Likewise there are twelve अिुते or supernumerary public claimants,
viz. तेिी, त ांबोळी, स ळी, म ळी, जांगम, र्ळि ांत , डिऱ्य , ठ र्र , घडशी, तर ळ, सोि र, िौगुि . Of these the allowance of corn is not settled. The learner must be prepared to meet with other enumerations of the बिुतेद र (e.
g. प टीि,ु र्ळ - र्रणी , िौधरी, पोतद र, देशप ांड्य , न्ह िी , परीट, गुरि, सुत र,ुां र्भ र , िेसर्र , जोशी; also सुत र, िोह र, ि म्ह र ,ुां र्भ र as constituting the first-class and claiming the largest
division of बिुतें; next न्ह िी , परीट, र्ोळी , गुरि as constituting the middle class and claiming a
subdivision of बिुतें; lastly,भट, मुि ण , सोि र, म ांग; and, in the Konkan̤ , yet another list); and with other accounts of the assignments of corn; for this and many similar matters, originally determined diversely, have undergone the usual influence of time, place, and ignorance. Of the बिुतेद र in the Indápúr pergunnah the list and description stands thus:--First
class, सुत र, िोह र, ि म्ह र , मह र; Second, परीट,ुां र्भ र , न्ह िी , म ांग;
Third, सोि र, मुि ण , गुरि, जोशी, र्ोळी , र मोशी; in all fourteen, but in no one village are the whole fourteen to be found or traced. In the Panḍharpúr districts the order is:-
पनहिी or थोरिी िळ (1st class); मह र, सुत र, िोह र, ि म्ह र , दुसरी or मधिी िळ (2nd class); परीट,ुां र्भ र , न्ह िी , म ांग, नतसरी orध र्टी िळ (3rd
class);ु र्ळर्रणी , जोशी, गुरि, पोतद र; twelve बिुते and of अिुते there are eighteen. According to Grant Duff,
the बितेद र are सुत र, िोह र, ि म्ह र , म ांग,ुां र्भ र , न्ह िी , परीट, गुरि, जोशी, भ ट, मुि ण ; and



28
the अिुते are सोि र, जांगम, नशांपी, र्ोळी , तर ळ or िेसर्र , म ळी, डिऱ्य गोस िी , घडशी, र मोशी, तेिी, त ांबोळी, गोांधळी. In many villages of Northern Dakhan̤ the मह र receives the बिुतें of the
first, second, and third classes; and, consequently, besides the मह र, there are but
nine बिुतेद र. The following are the onlyअिुतेद र or ि रू now to be found;-
सोि र, म ांग, नशांपी, भट गोांधळी, र्ोर - गू, र्ोति ि , तर ळ, but of the अिुतेद र & बिुते- द र there is much confused intermixture, the अिुतेद रof one district being the बिुतेद र of another, and
vice versâ . (The word र् स used above, in पनहिी र् स , मध्यम र् स , नतसरी र् स requires
explanation. It means Udder; and, as the बिुतेद र are, in the phraseology of endearment or
fondling, termed ि सरें (calves), their allotments or divisions are figured by successive bodies
of calves drawing at theर् स or under of the ग ांि under the figure of a ग य or cow.)
ब र हक्कद र (p. 576) [ bārā hakkadāra ] m pl The twelve hereditary officers of a village holding some perquisite or right;
as देशमुख, देशप ांड्य , सरप टीि,ु र्ळर्रणी , प िसऱ्य , शेट्य &c. There are differing enumerations.

cāli 'Interlocking bodies' (IL 3872) Rebus: sal 'workshop' (Santali) Allograph: sal ‘splinter’ Pict-61: Composite motif of three tigers Text1386 Note how the hieroglyph components of the text are displayed in
the space available on the seal after the pictorial motif hieroglyphs have been put together as part of the hypertext. The broken corner of the seal may have included other 'text hieroglyphs called signs'. The text messageis: bronze workshop, scribe/account iron supercargo, helmsman, smithy/forge/temple.
Hieroglyph of ‘looking back’ is read rebus as kamar 'artisan': వ్రకమమ రు [krammaru] krammaru. [Tel.] v. n. To turn, return, go back. మరలు. వ్రకమమ రంచు or వ్రకమమ రుచు krammarinṭsu. V. a. To turn, send back,
recall. To revoke, annul, rescind.వ్రకమమ రజేయు . వ్రకమమ ర krammara. Adv.
Again. వ్ర కమమ రలుల or వ్రకమరబడు Same as వ్రకమమ రు . krəm backʼ(Kho.)(CDIAL 3145) Kho. Krəm ʻ back ʼ NTS ii 262 with (?) (CDIAL 3145)[Cf. Ir. *kamaka – or *kamraka - ʻ back ʼ in Shgh.

Gřä ʻ neck ʼ; Kho. Goḷ ʻ front of neck, throat ʼ. Gala m. ʻ throat, neck ʼ MBh. (CDIAL 4070) Rebus: karmāra ‘smith, artisan’ (Skt.) kamar ‘smith’ (Santali)
kolmo 'three' Rebus: kolimi 'smithy, forge'
kola 'tiger' Rebus: kol 'working in iron'; kolle 'blacksmith'; kolimi 'smithy, forge'; kole.l 'smithy, temple'
र्णकर् kárṇaka र्णकर् kárṇaka, kannā m. du. the two legs spread out AV. xx , 133 'spread legs'; (semantic determinant) rebus: kárṇaka, kannā र्णकर् 'helmsman'.PLUS meḍ ‘body’ Rebus: meḍ ‘iron’ (Mu.)
kaṇḍ kanka ‘rim of jar’; Rebus: karnI 'supercargo', karṇika ‘scribe’;

kaṇḍ ‘furnace, fire-altar’. Thus the ligatured Glyph is decoded: kaṇḍkarṇaka ‘furnace scribe'
kole.l smithy, temple in Kota village (Ko.)
kōnṭa corner (Nk.); tu. kōṇṭu angle, corner (Tu.); rebus: kõdā ‘to turn in a lathe’ (Bengali) Alternative reading; kanac 'corner' rebus: kañcu 'bronze'
sal 'splinter' Rebus: sal 'workshop'
Thus, the message on the seal reads: meḍ ‘iron’; kāḍ ‘stone’; karṇaka karṇika ‘helmsman, supercargo, furnace scribe'; kolimi 'smithy, forge' kole.l 'smithy, temple'; sal ‘workshop’ PLUS kõdā sal 'turner workshop' (Alternative: kañcu sal 'bronze workshop')
The entire hypertexts of pictorial and text hieroglyph components can thus be read using rebus-metonymy-layered-meluhha cipher as: 'iron stone furnace scribe smithy-forge, temple, bronze turner's workshop'.
Section 7. kuṭhāru 'monkey' rebus: 'armourer' Monkey
is an Indus Script hieroglyph in front of one-horned young bull
Indus script seal shows horned young bull PLUS monkey as field
symbol.ु र्ठ रु kuṭhāru 'a monkey' Rebus: ु र्ठ रु kuṭhāru 'an armourer' (Monier-Williams) PLUS khoṇḍa 'young bull' rebus: kunda 'fine gold' PLUS singi 'horned' rebus: singi 'ornament gold'. Text message: mũha 'ingot shape' rebus: mũha 'ingot' PLUS ख ांड [ khāṇḍā] m A jag, notch, or indentation (as upon the edge of a tool).This is a hieroglyphmultiplex: slant PLUS notch: DhAL 'slanted' rebus ḍhāḷako 'large ingot' khaṇḍa 'implements' PLUS dula 'two' rebus: dul 'metal casting' PLUS khāṇḍā m A jag, notch rebus: khaṇḍa'implement' PLUS gaṇḍa'four' rebus: khaṇḍa 'implement' PLUS aya 'fish' rebus: ayas 'alloy metal'. Thus, the message reads alloy metal implement, large ingots. The seal conveys wealth resources: fine gold, ornament gold, armour (jewels), implements, ingots. If the monkey is female, the rebus reading is रत्नी ratnī 'female monkey dressed as woman' rebus ratna 'jewel, gem'.
On this seal, the monkey takes the place of 'standard device' which signifies: 1. kunda'lathe' rebus: kunda'fine gold' PLUS kammata'portable furnace' rebus: kammaṭa 'mint, coiner, coinage’.
