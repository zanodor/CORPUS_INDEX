Indus Script Corpora hieroglyphs link to 1) Pillar of Boatmen, 2) Cernunnos, smith-boatman on Gundestrup cauldron and 3) Kirkburn triskele hieroglyph
Triskele decoration on bronze linchpins of a celtic war chariot is an elaborated trefoil hieroglyph of Indus Script. Chariot burial at Wetwang and pair of linchpins of a chariot -- 3rd cent. BCE -at Kirkburn are explained as 'celtic' heritage. Yes, celtic which is also linked with the Gundestrup cauldron with hieroglyph-multiplexes which closely resemble those and related hypertexts on Indus Script Corpora. The chariot linch-pin found at Kirkburn has a triskele hieroglyph-multiplex with an orthography of hierolyph components signifying associated semantics of metalwork. The circular edge of the ends of the linch-pin is embossed with raised circles signifying ingots out of the three sets of crucibles.
In this hieroglyph-multiplex, the central hieroglyph component is three curved (crucibles) emanating from the centre. At the tip of each of the three cuve-endings, an explanatory hieroglyph component signifies: 1. crucible; and 2. a round ingot emanating from the crucible.

Pillar of the Boatmen includes a vivid portrayal of Cernunnos of the Gundestrup cauldron.Cernunnos celebrated on the Gundestrup cauldron is also identified unambiguously on a Pillar of Boatmen of 1st cent (French Pilier des nautes) with bas-relief depictions. I suggest that the Cernannos or Cernunnos is a phonetic derivative, cognate/variant of kāraṇīka 'boatman, guardian, teacher, judge, arrow-maker, state-prime minister, supercargo of a ship, scribe, accountant.'' The hieroglyph-multiplex on Indus Script Corpora which signifies this semantic spectrum is: rim-of-narrow-necked-jar. This hieroglyph-multiplex is the most frequently occurring 'sign 342' of the Corpora with ca. 7000 inscriptions.

A key hieroglyph on the chariot parts and horse fittings of Wetwang and Kirkburn, including a horse-grooming tool is triskele.
What was stylized as trefoil, a vivid hieroglyph on Indus Script Corpora of 3rd millennium BCE, elaborates into. triskele and into triple spirals along the Maritime Tin Route traversed by Meluhha seafaring merchants and artisans from Hanoi to Haifa and beyond in Eurasia. See: Indus Script priest [pōtṛ, 'purifier' (Rigveda)] with trefoil-decorations on shawl: kolimi pottha-kara 'smithy-forge modeller in clay (metalcaster)', pota 'casting in metal' http://bharatkalyan97.blogspot.in/2015/09/indus-script-priest-with-trefoil.html Trefoil is a hieroglyph-multiplex on Indus Script Corpora. This hieroglyph also occurs in Egypt and in the Ancient Near East artifacts. A modified form is the celtic triskele or trile spirals signifying metalwork contexts. In the vedic tradition, PotR is purifier

Vedic tradition, the Rigveda Suktas 10.8 and 10.9 are by tvaṣṭṛ the metalcaster, chariot
maker, artisan. The abiding memory of this divine form tvaṣṭṛ is celebrated as Cernunnos in
the Celtic tradition of metalwork and chariotry. The decipherment of the Mohenjo-daro seal
m0304 which signifies the hieroglyph of three-headed tvaṣṭṛ or Kubera -- as the creative
power of wealth -- links the Gundestrup cauldron hieroglyphs to the celebration and veneration
of metalcasting work by Purve yajnikas, forefathers, ancestors;
havaḍ m. ʻ a caste of iron -- smelters ʼ; hāū, hāv a particular red stone (Marathi) PLUS tri'three' read together as tri hā might have signified working with three minerals, metals esp. of red colour like iron ore, copper and zinc sulphate. And, hence, perhaps the representation of three conjoined circles constituting a trefoil. This is a conjecture subject to falsification by further researches. Thus, the statuette of the robed person wearing a fillet of authority may have signified PotR, 'purifier priest' or tri- hav 'metalworker worker working with three redstone metals, minerals'. I have not found any attestation for this reconstructed expression in the metalwork lexis of languages of Indian sprachbund.
The trefoil is perhaps a signifier of tri hā ind. In three ways, or in three parts;

"Coin: Rainbow Cup, 2nd century BC ~ shows a triskelion, a spiral symbol; Its original symbolism is unknown; it is supposed, however (like with all spirals), that it stood for the cycle of life or for the sun. It appeared in many early cultures, and in different forms that were always made up of 3 symmetrically arranged spirals, triangles, or bent human legs. On Roman coins triskele stood for Sicily, also known as Trinacria because of its triangular shape, until the Celts adopted it..."https://www.pinterest.com/pin/531635930983929026/

"A triskelion or triskele (which invariably has rotational symmetry) is a motif consisting of three interlocked spirals, three bent human legs, or three bent/curved lines extending from the center of the symbol. Both words are from Greek "τρισκέλιον" (triskelion) or "τρισκελής" (triskeles), "three-legged", from prefix "τρι-" (tri-), "three times" + "σκέλος" (skelos), "leg". A triskelion is the symbol of Sicily, where it is called trinacria, as well as of the Isle of Man...The triskelion symbol appears in many early cultures, the first in Malta (4400–3600 BCE) and in the astronomical calendar at the famous megalithic tomb of Newgrange in Ireland built around 3200 BC, Mycenaean vessels, on coinage in Lycia, and on staters of Pamphylia (at Aspendos, 370333 BCE) and Pisidia. It appears as a heraldic emblem on warriors' shields depicted on Greek

pottery...The Celtic symbol of three conjoined spirals may have had triple significance similar to the imagery that lies behind the triskelion. The triple spiral motif is a Neolithic symbol in Western Europe. It is considered a Celtic symbol but is in fact a pre-Celtic symbol. It is carved into the rock of a stone lozenge near the main entrance of the prehistoric Newgrange monument in County Meath, Ireland. Newgrange, which was built around 3200 BCE, predating the Celtic arrival in Ireland but has long since been incorporated into Celtic culture."

Iron Age, 3rd century BC From a burial at Kirkburn, East Yorkshire, England
These decorated objects held the wheels of a cart or chariot on their axles. The main parts are made of iron,
while both ends have been decorated with a bronze cap, cast onto the iron bar.
he elaborate decoration shows the great skill and care of the bronze workers.
Each end is decorated with a three-armed motif, known as a triskele.
Two-wheeled carts or chariots were placed in the graves of a very few of the most important people
who lived in East Yorkshire at this time. These lynch pins came from a cart that was found in Grave K5
at Kirkburn. The cart had been taken to pieces to place it in the grave, before its owner was laid on top.
The owner was a man, aged between 25 and 35, the same age as the man buried with the elaborate
Kirkburn Sword only ten metres away in the same cemetery. They were probably relatives,
as they share the same slight deformity of the skull.

The Kirkburn Sword



23



24
Iron Age, 300-200 BC From a burial at Kirkburn, East Yorkshire, England
Proabably the finest Iron Age sword in Europe
At this time in the Iron Age (300-200 BC) few people were buried in graves when they died. However, East Yorkshire was an exception and this sword was found in a grave excavated by British Museum archaeologists in 1987. The sword was found in Grave 3. It was buried with a man who was in his late 20s or early 30s when he died. He was an old man; very few Iron Age men lived to be older than 35 to 40. After the dead man was placed in the grave, three spears were thrust into his chest as part of the funeral ritual. Another man, of similar age, was buried in the same small cemetery, but with a chariot or cart.
The iron blade of a sword needed great time and skill to make and the sword as a whole is an incredibly complicated weapon and piece of art. The handle of this sword is unusually elaborate. It is made of thirty-seven different pieces of iron, bronze and horn. After it was assembled, the handle was decorated with red glass. The sword was carried in a scabbard made from iron and bronze. The polished bronze front plate was decorated with a La Tène style scroll pattern, and with red glass studs and insets.
The sword was clearly a valued object. The scabbard had been damaged and was repaired some time after it had been made, which might have been many years before it was placed in the grave with its final owner.

Photos: Bronze Remains of an Iron-Age Chariotfor By Live Science Staff | October 14, 2014 12:06am ET Archaeologists have discovered the remains of a 2,000-year-old bronze chariot at the Burrough Hill Iron Age Hillfortthat, a fortified hilltop. The remains include bronze chariot fittings, decorated linch pins and other artifacts. Here's a look at some of the remains found in the treasure trove, with photos courtesy of the University of Leicester. [Read full story on Iron Age chariot discovery] Linch pins

More bronze remains were found nearby. Here, a chariot linch pin shown from three angles, revealing the intricate decoration at the ends of the piece.

The bronze-fitted chariot once belonged to a warrior or noble, University of Leicester archaeologists said. One linch pin they found is decorated with a "triskele," or three wavy lines that radiate from a single point, similar to the modern flag for the Isle of Man. Here, an oblique view of the triskele decoration on the upper end of the linch pin.

View full size image
More than 2,000 years ago, pieces of an Iron Age chariot were burnt and buried, perhaps as a religious offering. Now, archaeologists have discovered the bronze remains of this sacrifice. Digging near Melton Mowbray in Leicestershire, England, an archaeology team discovered a trove of bronze chariot fittingsdating back to the second or third century B.C. The remains were discovered at the Burrough HillIron Age Hillfort, a fortified hilltop structure that was once surrounded by farms and settlements. Though humans lived in the area beginning around 4000 B.C., it was used most heavily between about 100 B.C. and A.D. 50, according to the University of Leicester. "This is the most remarkable discovery of material we made at Burrough Hill in the five years we worked on the site," University of Leicester archaeologist Jeremy Taylor said in a statement. "This is a very rare discovery and a strong sign of the prestige of the site." [See Images of the Iron Age Chariot's Remains] Burnt offering Taylor co-directs the field project at Burrough Hill, which is used to train archaeology students. It was four of these archaeology students who first found a piece of bronze near an Iron Age house within the Burrough Hill fort. More bronze pieces were found nearby. The pieces are the metal remains of a chariot that once belonged to a warrior or noble, according to university archaeologists. They include linchpins with decorated end caps, as well as rings and fittings that would have held harnesses. One linchpin is decorated with three wavy lines radiating



31
from a single point, almost like the modern flag for the Isle of Man, a British dependency in the Irish Sea. The Isle of Man's flag is decorated with an odd symbol called a triskelion, or three half-bent legs converging at the thigh. "The atmosphere at the dig on the day was a mix of 'tremendously excited' and 'slightly shellshocked,'" Taylor said. "I have been excavating for 25 years, and I have never found one of these pieces — let alone a whole set. It is a once-in-a-career discovery." The pieces were found upon a layer of chaff, which may have provided fuel for the burning ritual. The chariot pieces were put into a box and then covered with cinder and slag after being set on fire. This may have been a ritual marking the dismantling or closing of a home at the fort, or it could have honored the change of seasons, University of Leicester archaeologists suspect. Bronze and iron Alongside the chariot pieces, the researchers found a set of iron tools, which were placed around the parts before they were burned. "The function of the iron tools is a bit of a mystery, but given the equestrian nature of the hoard, it is possible that they were associated with horse grooming," Burrough Hill project co-director John Thomassaid in a statement. "One piece, in particular, has characteristics of a modern curry comb, while two curved blades may have been used to maintain horses' hooves or manufacture harness parts." The pieces will be on display temporarily at the Melton Carnegie Museum in Melton Mowbray from Oct. 18 to Dec. 13. "Realizing that I was actually uncovering a hoard that was carefully placed there hundreds of years ago made it the find of a lifetime," University of Leicester student Nora Battermann, who was one of the four students to make the find, said in a statement. "Looking at the objects now that they have been cleaned makes me even more proud, and I can't wait for them to go on display."

Archaeologists have unearthed the remains of a 2,000-year-old “warrior” chariot at an Iron Age dig site in Leicestershire.

A team from the University of Leicester have labelled the find a “once-in-a-career” discovery, after finding a hoard of rare bronze fittings from a 2nd or 3rd century BC Celtic chariot.
The ancient artefacts were uncovered by a group of students taking part in a dig at Burrough Hill, in Melton Mowbray - the site of an Iron Age hillfort which has been excavated for the past four years.
The chariot remains were believed to have belonged to a warrior or a noble, experts have said, and was buried as a religious offering.
After careful cleaning, the team revealed an array of decorative patterns in the bronze metalwork, including a triskele motif showing three waving lines, similar to the flag of the Isle of Man.
Dr Jeremy Taylor, lecturer in landscape archaeology at the University’s School of Archaeology and Ancient History and co-director of the Burrough Hill field project, said: “This is a matching set of highly-decorated bronze fittings from an Iron Age chariot – probably from the 2nd or 3rd century BC.
“This is the most remarkable discovery of material we made at Burrough Hill in the five years we worked on the site.



34
“This is a very rare discovery, and a strong sign of the prestige of the site.
“The atmosphere at the dig on the day was a mix of ‘tremendously excited’ and ‘slightly shellshocked’.
“I have been excavating for 25 years and I have never found one of these pieces - let alone a whole set. It is a once-in-a-career discovery.”
The bronze chariot parts are believed to have been placed in a box and then burned on top of a layer of cereal chaff.
The charred ceremonial remains were then covered burnt cinder and slag, where they lay undisturbed for more than 2,200 years.
John Thomas, co-director of the project, said: “It looks like it was a matching set of parts that was collected and placed in a box as an offering, before being placed in the ground.
“Iron tools were placed around the box before it was then burnt, and covered in a thick layer of cinder and slag.
“The function of the iron tools is a bit of a mystery, but given the equestrian nature of the hoard, it is possible that they were associated with horse grooming.
“One piece in particular has characteristics of a modern curry comb, while two curved blades may have been used to maintain horses hooves or manufacture harness parts.”
The parts have been taken to the University of Leicester’s School of Archaeology and Ancient History for further analysis – and are expected to be put on public display in the future.
However, before that, they will be on temporary display at the Melton Carnegie Museum, in Melton, from Saturday, October 18, until Saturday, December 13.
Nora Battermann, 20, one of the students who made the discovery, said: “Realising that I was actually uncovering a hoard that was carefully placed there hundreds of years ago made it the find of a lifetime.
“Looking at the objects now they have been cleaned makes me even more proud, and I can’t wait for them to go on display.”

Geography of the Castro Culture, and location of major oppida (urban fortified town). "From the Mondego river up to the Minho river, along the coastal areas of northern Portugal, during the last two centuries of the second millennium BCE a series of settlements were established in high, well communicated places, irradiating from a core area north of the Mondego, and usually specializing themselves in the production of Atlantic Bronze Age metallurgy: cauldrons, knives, bronze vases, roasting spits, flesh-hooks, swords, axes and jewelry, related to a noble elite who celebrated ritual banquets and who participated in an extensive network of interchange of prestige items, from the Mediterranean and up to the British Isles...Mining was an integral part of the culture, and it attracted Mediterranean merchants, first Phoenicians, later Carthaginians andRomans. Gold, iron, copper, tin and lead were the most common ores mined. Castro metallurgy refined the metals from ores and cast them to make various tools.During the initial centuries of the first millennium BC bronze was still the most used metal, although iron was progressively introduced. Main products include tools (sickles, hoes, ploughs, axes), domestic items (knives and cauldrons), and weapons (antenna swords, spearheads)."

Hill of Tara is one of the most revered spiritual sites in Ireland. Tens of centuries ago the kings of Ireland were anointed on a hill - it was place where spirituality met with royalty, and mythical traditions began. A place where druids held festivals, priestesses were trained and shaman’s rites

Cernunnos (Gundestrap cauldron, Denmark) Ref: Sat_ACE108PN
Stone sculpture from the representation of Cernunnos on this cauldron Gundestrap, Denmark Cernunnos (or Carnunnos, Cernunnus) "The Horned One" is the god of virility, wealth, woodlands, animals, regeneration of life and the guardian of the gates of another world (Annwn). It seems that the name is more an epithet that his real name Cernunnos wearing antlers, which connects to the sky and a torque by which he mastered the snake, symbol of the subterranean forces. It is often accompanied by a ramheaded serpent and a stag As god of the regeneration of life, he knows a cyclical nature: appears at the winter solstice, marries Beltane (early summer) and dies at the summer solstice. Samhain then it leaves the underworld to get into the "Wild Hunt" Dimensions: Height 34cm x Length 25cm x 6cm Depth

Cernunnos is named in an inscription on the 1st cent. CE Pillar of the Boatmen (French Pilier des nautes) with bas-relief depictions. " Dating to the first quarter of the 1st century AD, it originally stood in a temple in the Gallo-Romancivitas of Lutetia (modern Paris, France) and is one of the earliest pieces of representational Gaulish art to carry a written inscription...It is displayed in the frigidarium of the Thermes de Cluny...Cernunnos has stag's antlers from which hang two torcs. From the amount of the body in the top half, Cernunnos is assumed to have been depicted in a cross-legged seated position...Smertrios is shown kneeling, brandishing a club and attacking a snake. Castor and Pollus are shown standing beside their horses, each holding a spear...Jupiter is shown standing, holding a spear and a thunderbolt. Esus is shown standing beside a willow tree, which he is cutting down with an axe. Tarvos Trigaranus is depicted as a



44
large, heavy-set bull standing in front of a willow tree. Two cranes stand on his back and a third on his head. Vulcan is shown standing, with hammer and tongs."
One panel shows three warriors (who were perhaps also boatmen who accompanied to guard the treasures of seafaring merchants.).
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pillar_of_the_Boatmen On this Pillar of the Boatmen, Cernunnos is shown as a horned person flanked by two rings (torcs). The message is: ancient seafaring metalworkers.
"Religious Union: the Pillar of Nautes
The most extraordinary testimony is, as such, the famous pillar called "the Nautes", although it is initially dedicated to Jupiter.
He had to reach a height of about 6 meters and be located in the island, where it was discovered. Probably reused in the Lower Empire, it remains only 5 blocks, which nevertheless provide valuable indications: early urbanism of the City, the powers Nautes, loyalty to Rome and especially religious information. Indeed, next to gods and goddesses of the Roman Pantheon (Jupiter, Mercury, Mars, Fortuna, Castor and Pollux), we see typical Gallic deities as: Esus, Tarvos, Trigaranus, Eurises, smertrios or Cernannos. This official monument dedicated so good

understanding of different beliefs and a real syncretism: for example we know that Jupiter is located Gallic equivalent Taranis, God of heaven, for Mercury, it is integrated with the image of several native divinities mainly lug "Prince of multiple sciences" usually accompanied by symbols of balance and prosperity of the world, this protector God of travel and trade, as well as arts and crafts, is the favorite of the Gallo-Romans." (Translation from French: http://www.fdn.fr/~rebours/dieux.htm)
Some conjectures on the semantics related to the divinities adored in the Pillar of Boatmen are made; these may or may be relevant in the context of the overall semantics of the pillar dedicated to Jupiter and Vulcan, the divinities associated with metalwork and fire:

[His parents: the parents are either heaven or earth, or the two pieces of touchwood; gratifying...of sacrifice: as'vabudhna_h = vya_ptamu_la_H, with outspread bases, i.e., broad at the bottom and tapering to the top, the usual shape of a fire; in his fight the dawns, drawn by horses, rejoice their bodies in the source of truth (i.e., the sun)]. 10.008.04 Opulent Agni, you precede dawn after dawn. You are the illuminator of the twin (day and night); engendering Mitra from your own person, you retain seven places for sacrifice. [Mitra: the sun; seven places: the seven altars for the fire: dhisn.ya_ etc.] 10.008.05 You are the eye, the protector of the great sacrifice; when you proceed to the rite, you are Varun.a; you are the grandson of the waters, Ja_tavedas; you are the messenger (of him) whose oblation you enjoy. 10.008.06 You are the leader of the sacrifice and sacrificial water to the place in which you are associated with the auspicious steeds of the wind; you sustain the all-enjoying (sun) as chief in heaven; you, Agni, make your tongue the bearer of the oblation. [The place: i.e., the firmament; you sustain in heaven: you raise your glorious head in heaven; you make...oblation: yada_; when, Agni, you have so done, you are the leader...; you are the leader of the sacrifice and of water (rain) in the firmament and in heaven (Yajus. 13.15)]. 10.008.07 Trita by (his own), desiring a share (of the sacrifice), for the sake of taking part in the exploit of the supreme protector (of the world), chose (Indra as his friend); attended (by the priests) in the proximity of the parental heaven and earth, and reciting appropriate praise, he takes up his weapons. [Legend: Indra said to Trita, 'You are skiled in the weapons of all; aid me in killing Tris'iras the son of Tvas.t.a_'. Trita agreed on condition of having a share in the sacrifices offered to Indra. Indra gave him water to wash his hands with and a share in the sacrifice, whereby Trita's strength increased; seven-rayed: i.e., seven-tongued, seven-rayed, like the sun, or seven-handed]. 10.008.08 He, the son of the waters, incited by Indra, skilled in his paternal weapons, fought against (the enemy), and slew the seven-rayed, three-headed (asura); then Trita set free the cows of the son of Tvas.t.a_. 10.008.09 Indra, the protector of the virtuous, crushed the arrogant (foe), attaining vast strenth; shouting, he cut off the three heads of the multiform son of Tvas.t.a_ (the lord) of cattle.

Sign 342. kaṇḍa karṇaka 'rim of jar'; rebus: 'furnace scribe (account)'. Thus the inscription reads rebus: iron, iron (metal) workshop, copper (mineral) guild, fire-altar (furnace) scribe (account workshop), metal furnace scribe (account) As the decoding of m0304 seal demonstrates, the Indus hieroglyphs are the professional repertoire of an artisan (miners'/metalworkers') guild detailing the stone/mineral/metal resources/furnaces/smelters of workshops (smithy/forge/turners' shops). Comparble to m0304 showing a seated person in penance, is a seal showing a scarfed person in penance:

Bloomsfield, American Journal of Philology, 11, 355; 12,416; Roth, Festgruss an Bohtlingk, 98) denotes it as a twig. This is identified as that of Badarī, the jujube tied to the body of the dead to efface their traces. (See Vedic Index, I, p. 177).

Thus, the entire glyphic composition of the seated, horned person is decoded rebus: meḍ dhatu kampaṭṭa ḍab kuṭhi kaṇḍ iron, mineral, mint (copper casting, forging workshop)furnace.
The text of the inscription shows two types of 'fish' glyphs: one fish + fish with scaled circumscribed by four short-strokes: aya 'fish' (Mu.); rebus: aya 'metal' (Samskritam) gaṇḍa set of four (Santali) kaṇḍa ‘fire-altar’ cf. ayaskāṇḍa a quantity of iron, excellent iron (Pāṇ.gaṇ) The reading is consistent with the entire glyphic composition related to the mineral, mint forge.
Another comparable glyphic composition is provided by seal m1181.

Each glyphic element on this composition and text of inscription is decoded rebus:
Two glyphs 'cross-road' glyph + 'splice' glyph -- which start from right the inscription of Text on Seal m1181.The pair of glyphs on the inscription is decoded: dhatu adaru bāṭa 'furnace (for) mineral, native metal’. dāṭu 'cross'(Telugu); bāṭa 'road' (Telugu). aḍar = splinter (Santali); rebus: aduru = native metal (Ka.) aduru = gan.iyinda tegadu karagade iruva aduru = ore taken from the mine and not subjected to melting in a furnace (Kannada. Siddha_nti Subrahman.ya’ S’astri’s new interpretation of the Amarakos’a, Bangalore, Vicaradarpana Press, 1872, p. 330)
Other glyphic elements: aḍar kuṭhi 'native metal furnace'; soḍu 'fireplace'; sekra 'bell-metal and brass worker'; aya sal 'iron (metal) workshop'.
*the person is seated on a hoofed platform (representing a bull): decoding of glyphics read rebus: ḍangar ‘bull’; ḍhangar ‘blacksmith’ (H.); koṇḍo ‘stool’; rebus: koḍ ‘workshop’. The glyphics show that the seal relates to a blacksmith's workshop.
*the seated person's hair-dress includes a horned twig. aḍaru twig; aḍiri small and thin branch of a tree; aḍari small branches (Ka.); aḍaru twig (Tu.)(DEDR 67). aḍar = splinter (Santali); rebus: aduru = native metal (Ka.)

Santali glosses:
Wilhelm von Hevesy wrote about the Finno-Ugric-Munda kinship, like "Munda-Magyar-Maori, an Indian link between the antipodes new tracks of Hungarian origins" and "Finnisch-Ugrisches aus Indien". (DRIEM, George van: Languages of the Himalayas: an ethnolinguistic handbook. 1997. p.161-162.) Sumerian-Ural-Altaic language affinities have been noted. Given the presence of Meluhha settlements in Sumer, some Meluhha glosses might have been adapted in these languages. One etyma cluster refers to 'iron' exemplified by meD (Ho.). The alternative suggestion for the origin of the gloss med 'copper' in Uralic languages may be explained by the word meD (Ho.) of Munda family of Meluhha language stream:
Sa. <i>mE~R~hE~'d</i> `iron'. ! <i>mE~RhE~d</i>(M). Ma. <i>mErhE'd</i> `iron'. Mu. <i>mERE'd</i> `iron'. ~ <i>mE~R~E~'d</i> `iron'. ! <i>mENhEd</i>(M). Ho <i>meD</i> `iron'.

MB Emeneau observed an Indian linguistic area (Indian sprachbund). (Emeneau, Murray Barnson, 1980,Language and Linguistic Area: Essays, Stanford University Press, pp. 197-249).
That the Indian sprachbund dates back to the Chalcolithic-Bronze Age is shown in the decipherment of inscriptions in Indus Script Corpora which date from ca. 3300 BCE. (The earliest date of a potsherd from Harappa discovered by HARP -- Harvard Archaeology Project -- with three hieroglyphs which later become frequently used component of hieroglyhmultiplex corpora).



60
Potsherd h1522 discovered
in Harappa on the banks of River Ravi by archaeologists of HARP (Harvard Archaeology Project) is dated to ca. 3300 BCE.
That the Rigveda dates to an epoch earlier than 8th millennium BCE is shown by the discovery of Bhirrana, an archaeological site with continuous settlements from this date on the banks of River Sarasvati (Drishadvati tributary) and a deduction made by archaeologists BR Mani, KN Dikshit, BB Lal and Prof. Shivaji Singh who see the Sarasvati-Sindhu civilization as one side of the heritage coin and Rigvedic culture as the other side of the heritage coin. The civilization had about one million people in about 2,600 settlements. Of these settlements, about 2000 (i.e. 80%) were on the banks of Rigvedic River Sarasvati. Some of the settlements had 50,000 inhabitants. The area covered is about a million square kilometers. The contact areas were extensive ranging from Hanoi to Haifa, spanning the globe like a measuring rod the way the great poet Kalidasa describes the Himalayan ranges which stretch from Teheran to Hanoi. The culture evidenced by the civilization is present even today in the Indian Ocean region where people celebrate and live by the eternal, cosmic principle: dharma-dhamma.

Meluhha links to the treasures of Tuatha Dé Danann of Celtic-Irish tradition are relatable to Bronze Age metalwork of Meluhha artisans and traders evidenced by the Indus script hieroglyphs and artifacts of Sarasvati-Sindhu civilization.



73
The Tuatha Dé Danann also brought four magical treasures with them to Ireland, one apiece from their Four Cities:  The Dagda's Cauldron  The Spear of Lugh  The Stone of Fal  The Sword of Light of Nuada
Lugh is a hero skilled in the use of spear.
Claíomh Solais means in Irish, 'sword of light' held by Nuada or Nuadu (modern spelling: Nuadha), known by the epithet Airgetlám (modern spelling: Airgeadlámh, meaning "silver hand/arm"), who was the first king of the Tuatha Dé Danann,"people(s)/tribe(s) of the goddess Danu".
Dagda's cauldron. "The name Dagda may ultimately be derived from the Proto-IndoEuropean *Dhagho-deiwos "shining divinity", the first element being cognate with the English word "day", and possibly a byword for a deification of a notion such as "splendour". This etymology would tie in well with Dagda's mythic association with the sun and the earth, with kingship and excellence in general. *Dhago-deiwos would have been inherited into ProtoCeltic as *Dago-deiwos, thereby punning with the Proto-Celtic word *dagos "good".http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dagda In some texts, Dagda is a father-figure and a protector of the tribe; his mother is Danu.
This is an inner plate of the Gundestrup cauldron.

Interior plate C

Interior plate E
Base plate
The circular base plate depicts a bull. Above the back of the bull is a female figure wielding a sword, as well as two dogs, one over the bull's head and another under its hooves.
Exterior plates
Each of the seven exterior plates centrally depicts a bust. Plates a, b, c, and d show bearded male figures, and the remaining three are female.  On plate a, the bearded man holds in each hand a much smaller figure by the arm. Each of those two reach upward toward a small boar. Under the feet of the figures (on the shoulders of the larger man) are a dog on the left side and a winged horse on the right side.  The figure on plate b holds in each hand a sea-horse or dragon.  On plate c, a male figure raises his empty fists. On his right shoulder is a man in a "boxing" position, and on his left shoulder, there is a leaping figure with a small horseman underneath.  Plate d shows a bearded figure holding a stag by the hind quarters in each hand.  The female figure on plate e is flanked by two smaller male busts.  A female figure holds a bird in her upraised right hand on plate f. Her left arm is horizontal, supporting a man and a dog lying on its back. Two birds of prey are situated on either side of her head. Her hair is being plaited by a small woman on the right.  On plate g, the female figure has her arms crossed. On her right shoulder, a scene of a man fighting a lion is shown. On her left shoulder is a leaping figure similar to the one on plate c.
Interior plates
 Plate A shows an antlered male figure seated in a central position, likely Cernunnos. In his right hand, the figure is holding a torc, and with his left hand, he grips a horned serpent by the head. To the left is a stag with antlers that are very similar to the humanoid. Surrounding the scene are other canine, feline, and bovine figures, as well as a human figure riding a fish or a dolphin. Between his antlers, is an unknown image, possibly a plant or a tree, the identity of which is currently disputed.  On plate B, the bust of a female is flanked by two six-spoked wheels, two elephant-like creatures, and two griffins. A large hound resides underneath the bust.



76
 The bust of a bearded figure holding on to a broken wheel is the main constituent of plate C. A smaller, leaping figure with a horned helmet is also holding the rim of the wheel. Under the leaping figure is a horned serpent. The group is surrounded by griffins and other creatures, some similar to those on plate B. The wheel's spokes are rendered asymmetrical, but judging from the lower half, the wheel may have had twelve spokes.  Plate D depicts a bull-slaying scene. Three bulls are arranged in a row, facing right, and each of them is attacked by a man with a sword. A cat and a dog, both running to the left, appear respectively over and below each bull.  On the lower half of plate E, a line of warriors bearing spears and shields march to the left accompanied by carnyx players. On the left side, a large figure is immersing a smaller man in a cauldron. On the upper half, facing away from the cauldron are warriors on horseback.

"For many years, scholars have interpreted the cauldron's images in terms of the Celtic pantheon. The antlered figure in plate A has been commonly identified as Cernunnos, and the figure holding the broken wheel in plate C is more tentatively thought to be Taranis. There is no consensus regarding the other figures. Some Celticists have explained the elephants depicted on plate B as a reference to Hannibal's crossing of the Alps" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gundestrup_cauldron

Each plate of the cauldron is labeled after Klindt-Jensen whose labeling is generally adopted by the other scholars. Five inner plates are labeled in capitalized letters, and seven outer plates are labeled in small letters.

hieroglyphs. The comparable hieroglyphs could not have occurred merely by chance. It is reasonable to hypothesize 1. that Meluhhan artisans and traders of the Bronze Age had contacts with ancient Celts who created the hieroglyphs on the Gundestrup cauldron and 2. that these hieroglyphs are read rebus in Meluhha with glosses related to metalwork.
