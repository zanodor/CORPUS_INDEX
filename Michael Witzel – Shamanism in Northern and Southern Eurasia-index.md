Shamanism in Northern and Southern Eurasia: their
distinct methods of change of consciousness
Abstract in English
This paper seeks to establish that the ‘southern’ shamanism of the San,
Andamanese and Australian Aboriginals differs substantially from the well
known ‘classical’ Siberian one found in various forms in large parts of Eurasia
and the Americas (“Laurasia”). Second, the typical southern (“Gondwana”)
shamanistic features of heat rising up the spine are linked to medieval Indian
Kundalini Yoga and some representations in Paleolithic art. This process is an
important aspect of the change of consciousness initiated by shamanistic
initiation and practice.
Key words in English
Siberian shamanism, initiation, ascent, consciousness, possession, Gondwana
mythology, San, Andamanese, Australian Aboriginals, body heat, Out of Africa
movement, Laurasian mythology, stone age art, shamanic teachings.
§1 Introduction
Shamanism1 is a topic that has been under constant and controversial2 discussion,3
especially since Eliade.4 It is best known in its Siberian version, treated by many
well-known specialists, including R. Hamayon.5 In shamanistic belief, the world is
filled by spirits that affect all living beings. In our present context, it is important to
underline the change of consciousness that the shamanic adept undergoes and that the
fully developed shaman experiences each time he performs a shamanic session. This
includes, with Eliade and others --- mostly following its ‘typical’ Siberian form --- the
following aspects.

Spirits exist and play important roles both in individual lives and in human
society; they can be good or evil. The shaman can communicate with the spirit world.
The male or female adept, after a sudden crisis, believes that he is chosen, is then
recreated and educated by the spirits. He becomes an ‘embodiment’ of his spirit
guardian or helping spirit (‘familiar’) or of his double, an (external) soul in animal
form. He then is able to travel to the other worlds to communicate with the gods and
spirits, in a state of ecstasy exhibited in his rituals.
The shaman employs trance-inducing techniques to incite visionary ecstasy
and to go on ‘vision quests’. This is achieved by music (drumming), dancing,
recitation of certain texts, mantras, etc. The shaman’s spirit can leave the body to
enter the supernatural world to search for answers. He evokes animal images as spirit
guides, omens, and message-bearers. He can treat sickness caused by evil spirits. The
shaman can tell the future by crystal gazing, throwing bones or runes; he can also
perform many other forms of divination.
Shamanism requires special knowledge and abilities, usually learned during a
long apprenticeship. Shamans are not tied to individual religions and usually operate
outside them. They work alone (although some take on an apprentice or a minor
shamanic helper).6 They have a number of functions, which depend very much on
their respective cultures.
They mediate between the various worlds. This includes, first of all, acting as
a psychopomp, as healers (like psychologists and doctors), or as fortune-tellers, and
even as political advisers; they preserve their individual tribal traditions by
storytelling and singing songs. They can also lead a sacrifice, and act as priests. In
some cultures, a shaman can have several functions at the same time. A shaman also
determine society’s features --- such as the movements of nomadic tribes. He thus
acts as the transmitter of traditional tribal lore, including that about the ‘origins’ of
the tribe or ‘the shaman’ as such, known only to some extent by most adults.
§2 Definition



3
However, there remains the problem of a proper definition of the terms ‘shaman’ and
‘shamanism’. Normally, we take this disputed term to mean the Siberian variety that
has briefly been characterized above. However, both the word ‘shaman’ and the
concept of ‘shamanism’ have been employed in many ways in scholarly, and
especially so in popular, literature. The word shaman is a Tungus word and it is not
derived from the Indo-Aryan word for an ascetic or Buddhist monk,
śramaṇa/samana. Instead, šamán is a Tungus (or Manchu) word and means ‘he or
she who knows’. It may be advantageous, therefore, to start with a definition.7 Walter
and Fridman (2004) stress the current broad interpretation of the term as designating
any kind of ecstatic behavior, including spirit possession, witchcraft, even
cannibalism, but, on the other hand, they also offer a narrow definition that stresses
initiatory crisis, vision quest, an experience of dismemberment and regeneration,
climbing the sacred (world) tree, spirit flight, the role of the shaman as healer, and the
use of trance.8 For our purpose it will be most important to investigate the way a
layperson becomes a shaman, what changes in consciousness he or she undergoes,
and what changes shamans experience each time they ‘shamanize’. We will return to
this topic later.
In addition to the so-called ‘classical’ Siberian form, shamanic practices occur
in large number of areas south to it,9 and across the ocean in the Americas. They also
occur in parts of Africa, in the Andaman Islands, with the Semang in the Malay
Peninsula, in New Guinea, Australia and South America. Eliade’s discussion of
African and, in part, of Australian shamanism, is not adequate,10 while his version of
the ‘typical’ North Asian/Siberian and Amerindian11 shamanism has been
reconfirmed by many scholars. He12 nevertheless stresses the similarities between
Siberian and Australian initiation rites as important for the role of shamanism and its
Paleolithic origins, especially the importance of caves.13 He also compares the
insertion of crystals found with the Semang, Australians and South American
Indians,14 which he correctly regards as an archaic trait.15 The same applies to
dissecting of the body of the initiate in Australia and Siberia.16



4
However, once we take into account that these peoples live close to the place
of human origins in East Africa, and indeed are remnants of the early dispersal along
the Indian Ocean, our gaze focused on Siberia must be reversed. Instead, the San,
Hadza/Sandawe, the Andamanese and the Australians have preserved a prototype of
what later became Siberian and Amerindian shamanism (that is to be distinguished
from mere possession).
The earlier Gondwana 1versions have dancing but they do not yet have the
typical Siberian feature of shamanistic drumming17 and not yet much of the shamanic
dress. Nevertheless they share, instead, a unique perception of difficultly controlled
heat that raises from the lower end of the spine upwards,18 --- a feature that is still
retained in some forms of Indian Yoga.19 Eliade, however, erroneously regards such
‘heat’ as a general phenomenon connected with magic, not as a typical shamanistic
trait.20 We will return to the details of Southern shamanism after taking a closer look
at its Siberian form.
§3 Siberian shamanism
As we know best about the ‘classical’, Siberian form of shamanism, we begin with a
brief description of its features. A comprehensive description of this narrow
(Siberian) version is the one recently given by Basilov:21 shamanism ... emerged in
the period when hunting and gathering were the main means to support life ... [The]
most important ... beliefs [are:] (a) all the surrounding world is animated, inhabited
1 The geological term ‘Gondwana’ that embraces the southern
(sub)continents of Africa, India, Australia etc., is used here to
indicate the ‘southern type’ mythologies found in sub-Saharan
Africa etc. that differ considerably from the ‘northern’ ones of
Laurasia. The latter geological term includes Eurasia and North
America, which I here extend, for practical purposes, to South
America; for details see Witzel (2001).

by the spirits who can influence man’s life; (b) there are general and reciprocal
interconnections in nature (humans included); (c) human beings are not superior but
equal to the other forms of life; (d) human society is closely connected with the
cosmos; (e) it is possible for human beings to acquire some qualities of a spirit and
visit the other worlds; (f) the aim of religious activity is to defend and make
prosperous a small group of kinsmen.22 Or, in more detail, the shamans can be
described as follows.
(1) The ideological background is that humans and spirits23 or deities are
closely related and interact, especially through the shaman, who insures the success of
the clan in hunting and other activities. (2) The shaman is usually ‘called’ by
spirit(ual) powers who force him or her to become a shaman, sometimes in their
dreams.24 Other shamans choose their career.25 (3) The shaman provides a link with
the several (often 9) levels of the world, of which we can see only one, our own
world. The other ones are those of the spirits or powers. Shamans move up to them by
the axis mundi26 (symbolized by a tree or a pathway)27 and bring back knowledge.
Or they do so by various (local) animal familiars. (4) As a healer, the shaman moves
to other levels of the universe to find out what the spirits want, so that sickness, and
other evils can be overcome.. Disease originates with certain spirits or through
witchcraft (on the part of evil shamans). (5) Shamans heal by going to the spirit
world, when in trance, and by leaving their own body or transforming into another
being, the ‘familiar’. They have one or more ‘familiars’: a particular animal,28 a
double soul, spirits of healing plants or sometimes those of deceased shamans.
Healing proceeds by retrieving the soul of the ill person.29 Shamans often enter the
patient to fight the disease-causing spirit; they heal by driving the spirit out,
sometimes by showing an extracted token of the spirit. They also guide the souls of
the dead. (6) Shamans usually are very knowledgeable about local healing plants,
learned directly from the spirits. Rocks or quartz are commonly used because of their
special powers and their animating spirits.30 They often are (spiritually) inserted into
a shaman. (7) Shamans help the hunt with magic, by releasing the souls of the



6
animals, ensuring that they are not angered or hurt, or by letting a killed animal tell
others to be killed. (8) Shamans may be exposed to risk that originates from the
spirits, from enemy shamans, from some plants used, from altering their state of
consciousness, and by not returning from the spiritual journey, which leads to death.
These dangers are lessened by spells. (9) Returning to consciousness, this world and
their body, the shaman transmits the messages of the spirits or deities. In sum, the
shaman is an early form of the typical ‘intermediary’ (like later on, priests),31 but he
is one who has obtained and ‘tamed’ special powers that he exercises in trance,
including heat.
Consciousness and initiation
Clearly, certain psychological features, a change of consciousness and trance are
involved in being a shaman. However, the shaman’s state of mind is not one of
‘possession’, in the common use of the term, though possession and shamanic trance
are frequently confused.32 It is therefore important to distinguish both: on the one
hand, the commonly found involuntary phenomenon of possession by a spirit33 and,
on the other, the self-induced shamanic trance that occurs after (initial) contact with
the spirits, indicated by shaking. After this initial involuntary or accidental contact
with the spirit world, it is the shaman’s quest to contact spirits and the other worlds,
while in possession, a spirit enters an unwilling being.34
Both possession and trance, however, share one major feature, which has led
to the common confusion between the two terms. As described, the initiatory crisis of
the future shaman is usually indicated by involuntary shaking, induced by the spirits
in some form or other. This state is also called the ‘shamanic illness’. The shamanistic
initiatory crisis35 functions as an --- involuntary --- rite of passage for the future
shaman, and it involves both a more-or-less serious physical illness and/or a
psychological crisis. This state is well attested across all shamanic regions.36 Next to
illness, the shaman-to-be may also be struck by lightning and may dream of
thunder,37 or may have a near-death experience.



7
During shamanic initiation, a certain complex of imagery is commonly
experienced, whatever be the method of induction. This often includes being
transported to the spirit world and interacting there with them, meeting a spiritual
guide, being dissected or devoured by some being, and re-emerging transformed,
and/or being ‘dismantled’ and ‘reassembled’ again, often with the addition of
implanted tokens, such as magical crystals. In sum, in initiation, transformation
occurs; this includes gaining the power to overcome death and rebirth.
While in this state, Siberian shamans may behave, according to our modern
standards, in a psychotic fashion. Local Siberians, on the contrary, interpret this as
initiatory ‘possession’ by a spirit who demands that the selected person becomes a
shaman. However, the shaman does not remain ‘possessed’ after the initial crisis but
undergoes a long period of training by other shamans. He can then freely call on his
spirit (the familiar), when he wishes to go into trance. All of this is quite unlike the
involuntary ‘possession’ by some kind of demon or spirit. In some societies, shamans
acquire a personality split into two spirits; this includes shamanic dress and attributes,
the role or function of the other sex or gender fluidity and/or same-sex sexual
orientation.38
§4 ‘Southern’ shamanism: the Gondwana area
Some of the major forms of current non-‘Siberian’ shamanism39 can be described
while following the trail of the Out of Africa (‘Gondwana’)40 migration of
‘anatomically modern humans’ (Homo Sapiens sap.), from west to east, some 65,000
years ago. By comparing all major forms extant on different continents, we may be
able to learn more about their mutual relationship and history.
1. San (Bushmen)
The San (Khoi-San, Bushmen) have dances producing trance, during which they
travel, like all shamans, over the earth or to the spirit world. This is like the Siberian
shamans’ descent and ascent to the sky. Trance is often expressed as death, flying,



8
floating or even as drowning.41 Initiation is of a rather prolonged nature.42 But the
San do not (yet) have the ‘classical’ dissection and transubstantiation of the shaman’s
body --- perhaps except for the fact that they change into a flying eland antelope
when in trance; apparently they do so also after death.
The Sans’ communal dance is accompanied by music made by men and
women, using various local instruments and singing. However, this kind of dance is
not (yet) the typical solitary dance of the lone (Siberian) shaman, accompanied by a
circular drum. Dancing results in a trance collapse (!aia, !kia). The interaction of
music, singers and dancers also produces ‘heat’: the dancers transmit heat (‘boiling’)
to each other, and the women’s singing and music, too, activates it; from it, the
shaman healers may draw energy.43 San shamans44 know of the difficult mastering of
their internal heat (n/um ‘medicine’), which moves upward from the base of the
spine. They use that power for healing.45 It is controlled by medicine inside their
body. The older experienced medicine men control n/um, and call the ‘traveling’
adept back into his body. This description immediately reminds one of the
descriptions of some forms of Indian yoga, where the kuṇḍalinī power is awakened at
the bottom of the spine (guhya) and likewise moves upwards, in several stages via a
number of centers (cakra), up to the head, and beyond: through the skull it emerges
above it.46 Early evidence for shamanism is found in South African rock art, at
27,000 before the present era.47
We return now to other remnants of the Out of Africa exodus, the
Andamanese, who barely survive on their chain of islands off the coast of Burma.
2. Andamanese
Andamanese shamans were called Oko-jumu, dreamers.48 The term means ‘one who
speaks from dreams’, from jumu ‘dream.’49 Like the San, they were in contact with
the dangerous primordial power inherent in all objects (ot-kimil, gumul), which means
‘hot’. This power is dangerous. People in contact with it are the Oko-jumu. The
Shamans dream, meet the spirits in the jungle, ‘die’ and return to life. However, they



9
do not (yet) have the Siberian-style trance, nor is the community involved, for
example by dancing, as with the San.50
According to Radcliffe-Brown’s detailed account of 1922, ‘initiation’ could
happen in three ways: by ‘dying’, by going into the jungle, by meeting spirits in
dreams. Certain men or boys could even communicate with the spirits in extra
ordinary dreams, such as of the spirit of a dead person, or of spirits of the forest or
sea. Initially, a person was contacted by the spirits, for example when having been
unconscious (‘dead’) for up to 12 hours. The Oko-jumu met the spirits in the jungle,
and there got their powers. They continued to go to the jungle to meet spirits as their
friends. Only men could be oko-paiad, but in North Andaman rarely women too
could possess these powers. After initiation, one continued to communicate with the
spirits in one’s sleep (dreaming); using their power one could cause and cure illness.
Shamanic heat was called kimil , ‘hot’. The word carries many meanings, but
it is always connected with extra-ordinary states that were regarded as dangerous,
such as: that of young man/woman when passing through or having recently passed
through the initiation ceremony; the condition after eating certain types of ‘powerful’
foods. These conditions produced or had inherent ‘heat.’
Surprisingly, this idea persists in modern India --- whether Hindu or Muslim
-- where many objects or persons (like the Guru) are believed to be ‘hot’ and
therefore have to be ‘cooled’ down by a variety of methods --- such as pouring milk
over a Śivaliṅgam.51 The concept is old: there are a number of interesting stories
from late Vedic texts onward that tell how to deal with ‘hot’ items or persons, such as
the magically powerful ‘hot’ Ṛṣis --- one sends a divine courtesan (Apsaras) to ‘cool
them down’.
If we combine this information with the Indian idea of a power rising up one’s
spine in Yoga, we detect very old pathway dependencies in Indian thought. For, the
ancestors of the Andamanese are some of the earliest settlers in the subcontinent,
soon after the Out of Africa movement of some 65,000 years ago. The similarity with
African (San) concepts notable: that of how to manage – with difficulty and after a



10
long period of training by other shamans -- the heat rising up one’s spine. It is
remarkable that the San and Sandawe still live(d) close to the area of origin of the Out
of Africa emigrants, in Central Tanzania. It seems that these populations all have
retained early forms of shamanism.
3.Australian shamans
Australian shamans52 (karadji, maban), are usually called ‘clever men’. Like their
Andamanese counterparts, they undergo symbolic death and descent into a cave or
ascent to heaven. Like the San shamans they do so, however, by riding on the
Rainbow Snake..53 In their transformation to shamans, their internal organs are
removed and a new set is inserted consisting of stones or of small rainbow snakes and
crystals.54 This procedure symbolizes their transformation of consciousness; the
fractured crystals with their multi-colored, rainbow-like like=?, evoke the primordial
Rainbow Serpent. Certain spirits, familiars or personal totems, sometimes located
inside the body, act as assistants. They can be pulled out and can travel.55 The
following procedures are most typical.
(1) Symbolic death and ascent to heaven;56 the shamanic master changes into
a skeleton, puts the shrunk candidate (of the size of a newborn) in his pouch on his
neck, rides, astride the Rainbow Snake, climbs upward and throws the candidate into
heaven, thereby killing him. (2) In heaven, he inserts small rainbow snakes and
crystals into him; he brings him back to earth on the Rainbow Snake; again, crystals
are inserted. (3) Finally, he awakens the candidate by touch with a magical stone.
Among the various local variations, the Aranda57 of Central Australia, too,
insert magic crystals;58 a spirit throws an invisible lance, from neck to tongue,
producing a really visible hole, and from ear to ear; the candidate falls down dead; his
internal organs are removed; a new set of stones is inserted; inside him there is a
lizard of great power (or an eagle-hawk); the candidate returns to life as insane for a
few days.59 The Wiradjuri60 of New South Wales, too, have the shaman master insert
crystals into the body of the initiate, and then letting him drink water; he can see the



11
spirits now; the master leads him to his grave where the dead give him magical
stones; he meets a snake, which becomes his totem; the snake leads him into the
earth, where other snakes rub him, magically giving him powers; then, the master
leads him upward to Baiame (the highest being sitting on a ‘throne’ of crystal); they
ascend on a rope, until they meet the bird of Baiame and enter the door to heaven,
which is quickly opening and closing.61 If they are touched by the door, they fall
down to earth.
§5 Shamanic ‘heat’
Perhaps most interestingly, the three remnant populations of the great exodus, the
Bushmen, Andamanese and Australian Aborigines, talk of a power released as ‘heat’
that moved up the spine; as shamans, they have to learn to bring it under control.62
There is agreement, from Africa to Australia, in spite of some differences in the
actual shamanistic performance: communal dance with music with the San (and
apparently the Sandawe)63 or the more casual initiation of the Andamanese by
visiting the forest, apparently without special dances. Once closer contact with the
few hundred still-surviving Jarawa or Sentinelese has been established, we may know
more.
On closer inspection, this image may well be one of the most original ones
involving shamans: we have the ‘external’ movement of the shaman, whether in
Siberia or in the southern regions, from the San to Australia. It takes the shaman to
heaven along the (world) tree or along a certain path, led by a dog or raven, or on the
Rainbow Snake. The same is seen internalized as the upward movement of internal
heat, from the lower part of the spine --- functioning as an internal ‘tree’ --- upward to
the top, the skull, which is shaped like the dome of the sky.64
If we add Indian yogic materials to these data, heat is generated at the lower
end of the spine, in the guhya region, between penis and anus. It moves upward
through several centers (cakra), to the head, and through an imagined hole in the skull
(brahmarandha) to a final cakra above the head. The movement of yogic power is



12
often described in Indian texts as the ‘awakening of the snake’, of kuṇḍalinī power
coiled at the bottom of the spine, which reminds one of the Rainbow Snake inside the
Australian shaman’s body. The movement is hinted at already in Patañjali’s
Yogasūtra, chapter 3, ‘On divine powers’, which mentions the navel, throat, chest,
head and heart.65 That clearly reminds one of shamanic practices elsewhere.
It is important to note that Yoga is not an original Indo-Iranian practice but
obviously something that was gradually acquired locally by Indo-Aryan speakers,
indicating the ‘primitive’ --- or rather ‘perennial’ --- origins of some forms of Indian
(kuṇḍalinī) yoga. Nothing is really new or unique here. This form of yoga is merely
the preservation --- and subsequent practical and theoretical elaboration in medieval
India --- of some Stone-Age spiritual techniques found from Africa to Australia, and
hence, ‘left behind’ during this expansion, also in the Indian subcontinent and the
Andamans.66 The Andamanese and Australians practicing early shamanism involving
inner heat still live on the Out of Africa trail, a movement occurring some 65,000
years ago.67
In sum, we are dealing here with a very ancient form of shamanism that has
undergone some local developments over the past 65,000 years or so but still is
remarkably consistent in its forms: the shamans go into trance though contact with the
spirits, they manage ‘heat’ rising up from the lower spine, somatically, they move
upwards to heaven spiritually (and downwards to the netherworld); they use the
powers gained in contact with the spirits for healing and enhancing the hunt.
Against this background, ‘classical’ Siberian shamanism is a later, a Late
Paleolithic or rather a Mesolithic, development. In terms of the comparative
mythology now proposed,68 ‘Siberian’ shamanism belongs to one of the northern
(Laurasian) groups of people found in Eurasia and the Americas, while the older,
southern groups (of Gondwana Land) have preserved the older, more original forms
of shamanism to this day. Their study is of high urgency as they represent the
common heritage of humankind.

§6 Summary of older shamanic traditions
The following section sums up the salient features of shamanism; details assumed for
Siberian shamanism are not specifically recorded, except for some data of Eskimo
(Inuit) and eastern Siberians; southern shamanic groups are underlined.
Initiation
(a) Summons in solitude from spirits of wilderness: Andaman (also epileptic
fits, fainting).
(b) Together with songs: San (Bushmen), also with dance, musical
instruments; Eskimo; Tungus: ‘when I sing, [illness] disappears’.
(c) illness or death, if not heeded: Bushmen: prolonged initiation, managing of
heat; Tungus: ‘sick for one year’
(d) Spiritual ‘familiar’ involved with call. Bushmen: role of springboks (flying
bucks, ‘former humans’, changed by mantis; blood exchange with shaman);
Andaman: spirits of jungle, initiate in jungle; Australia: personal totem (rainbow
snake, lizard, eagle hawk) inserted inside body, pulled out for healing and travel;
Eskimo: ‘human’ helpers; Tungus: ‘forefathers forced me...’.
(e) Inward physical transubstantiation. Bushmen: difficult control of ntum
force inside, moves up spinal column = moving upwards to heaven on Rainbow
Snake/spin webs; as flying springboks (also after death);69 no shamanic death and
dissection, reconstitution, but trance collapse; gradually learning to manage heat;
Andaman: oko-jumu ‘dreamers,’ by dying and returning to life, by spirits in jungle;
contact with heat / power ot-kimil; Semang (Malaya): inserting small crystals into
body; Papua: shaman is ‘burning’; Australia: symbolic death and ascent to heaven (or
underground), on Rainbow Snake into heaven, killing adept; inserting small rainbow
snakes and crystals (snake/eagle hawk becomes totem, inside the body); return on
Rainbow Snake, awakening; Eskimo: ‘eaten by bear, limb by limb’, fasting, sexual
abstinence, isolation, no warmth; Tungus: adept shot, cut up, bones separated; spirits
eat his flesh; shaman spirits drink blood of reindeer, also the adept; ancestors give up



14
his body, he begins to shamanize; transvestite Shamans: Chukchi/Koryak:
androgynous; elsewhere ‘soft men’.
Learning period with other shamans. Bushmen: older experienced medicine
men control ntum, call ‘traveling’ adept back into his body; Andaman: only sketchy
information on teachers; Australia: important role of master shaman; Siberia: ditto.
Powers: Bushmen: power/heat ntum, controlled by medicine inside the body;
Andaman: power in all ‘hot’ objects: ot-kimil; danger due to contact; Semang: quartz
crystals inserted into body; Australia: power by inserting quartz crystals; due to
fractures, shine similar to rainbow snake); Eskimo: sila ‘soul’/silam inua ‘soul of the
universe’, invisible; distant, but also inside oneself.
(f) Sees/moves through barriers/space: Bushmen: moves down, then up to
heaven on Rainbow Snake or by spiders’ silk strings / as flying springboks;
Andaman: nothing recorded, just contact with spirits in jungle; Australia: inside the
body is a lizard/rainbow snake of great power, with other tribes (SE) an eagle-hawk;
important role of the tree in ritual70 shaman moves down and up with help of
animals; also by ladder/rope; Siberia: upward movement along world tree or a path:
dog guide, like Saramā (in the Veda).
(g) Mediate between humans and supernatural: Andaman: participatory, by
contact with power and healing etc; Australia: by traveling in trance (helped by
familiar); Chukchi/Koryak: intervening with anthropomorphic sky gods, and
anthropomorphic enemy spirits intercepting sacrifices.
(h) Advise/guide in hunting: Tungus: ancestors help in hunting; hunting help
widespread (Africa, Asia, Australia).
(i) Healing: massage, suction, flight to its heavenly source; Bushmen: use of
ntum power; Andaman: use of heat; also plants, objects; Papua: evil spirits expelled.
§7 Stone-age shamanism and stone-age art
How old are the ‘Siberian’ and ‘southern’ versions of shamanism? As indicated,
‘classical’ Eurasian shamanism is found among a wide range of ‘northern’ peoples,



15
from the Saami (Lapps) of Northern Scandinavia to the Chukchi in N.E. Siberia --
with an extension into all of the Americas --- and from the Polar Sea to some
Nepalese tribes71 and to the Dayak of Borneo.72
In the context of Eurasian mythology and Stone-Age shamanism, the
questions of interest include the following ones. What is its relationship with the
‘shaman’ figure attested in Stone-Age paintings in southern France and elsewhere?73
What is the relationship with similar features found among the San (Bushmen), the
Andamanese and the Australian Aborigines?74 Is shamanism related to the Stone-Age
hunters’ societies of the open steppe/tundra of Eurasia, and in how far could it
continue among agriculturalists, e.g. in modern Nepal or Okinawa?75 What, then, are
the stages in its development? How far is the institution of shamans (whether
inherited via the family line or not) connected with the (possibility of) transmission of
a compact body of texts, such as required by the complex Laurasian mythology? Is the
absence of the Eurasian/Laurasian framework for shamanism --- even in areas where
one would suspect it, such as Tierra del Fuego76 --- connected with the absence of
shamans/priests? Only some of these questions will be answered below. It is best to
begin investigating what testimony can be found by archaeology, in other words: in
Stone-Age rituals, paintings and sculptures77 that we can ‘ask’ for their meanings.
We have Stone-Age objects, plastic art and cave paintings from the Paleolithic period,
--- that is, in Europe before c. 8000 BCE, for example at Lascaux. Shamanic practices
have been assumed for the Paleolithic78 and for the Neolithic periods,79 for which
good archaeological evidence exists.80 However, early rock art mostly depicts, not
surprisingly, the local animals of the Stone-Age hunt and, from the Mesolithic
onwards, also humans in the act of hunting, dance, daily life and war. We also find
some composite human figures, spirits or deities (especially in Australian art).
Importantly, there are some early paintings, such as at Lascaux, with depictions of a
figure that has been interpreted as shaman or ‘sorcerer’, who is involved in the magic
of the hunt.81 It was such ‘shamans’ that will have transmitted Stone-Age myths. The
‘classical’ Siberian form of shamanism, with offshoots in northern Europe, South and



16
Southeast Asia as well as Korea, Japan and the Americas,82 has some additional
characteristics, such as the circular frame drum. The raven frequently is the shaman’s
messenger.83 The shamanic explanation of Stone-Age paintings has been challenged
recently. Wunn (2005) insists that the various kinds of archaeological data have to be
counterchecked.84 Three recent prominent interpretations, those of Henri Breuil,85
André Leroi-Gourhan86 and Mircea Eliade, are largely rejected by her.87
Eliade88 saw parallels to Paleolithic art in the simple hunters’ economies that
allow for hunting magic and for a ‘sanctuary’, but, as Wunn criticizes, he used only
one painting to illustrate this art: Breuil’s much discussed and now criticized sketch
of a painting at Trois Frères:89 that of the shaman-like ‘Great Sorcerer’, of c. 14,000
BCE.90 Similarly, the famous Lascaux painting of an ithyphallic man lying in front of
bison91 has found various interpretations: as hunting magic, as the memorial of a
wounded or slain hunter,92 or as a shamanistic séance.93
To these representations, we can add a number of significant depictions of the
European Upper Paleolithic:94 the Magdalenien figure at El Castillo, ‘of a shaman
going into trance --- becoming “geometric” and sensing his body split into two
different energy fields on his left and right side.’ Second, a figure at Bruniquel
ususally called the ‘Button Man’.95 However, as J. Harrod pointed out to me, the
figure ‘has six or seven buttons --- note the buttons are not full circles but two arcs
put together; this appears to be a representation paralleling the Hindu cakra model’.
And importantly, a figure from Predmosti, with several cakras on top of each other,
the one in the breast area with two adjoined ones (left and right), for which compare
the careful and thoughtful description by A. Marshak.96
Since the Seventies ethnographic comparison has been more prominent in the
interpretations. Based on (European) archaeological evidence and a theory of linear
mental development (Bellah),97 Wunn concludes that, in the Late Paleolithic neither
sorcerers nor shamans were depicted, nor were clashes between totemistic clans.98
However, I think that even a mere table of the congruencies, identities and overlaps of
cave art and modern shamanic practices will show the opposite: the Paleolithic cave



17
paintings indicate an early form of shamanism that is still maintained with the San,
Andamanese, Semang of Malaya, the Papuas and Australian Aborigines. These are
populations that, in my scheme of comparative mythology (2001, 2010), belong to the
‘older’, Gondwana type (of c. 65,000 years ago), from which Eurasian and
Amerindian mythology (of the Laurasian type) developed around 40,000 years ago.
§8 Modern and stone-age shamanism
It appears that there are a number of seemingly global characteristics that unite San,
Andamanese, Australian and Eurasian/Amerindian shamanism. Some aspects of these
characteristics are already clearly, some others likely, represented in Stone-Age rock
art: death and rebirth / change inside the body(?); use of animal familiars (bison,
bird); trance: descent / ascent to the spirits or deities (using a bird); contact with and
use of supermundane powers for healing and success in hunting (hunting magic);
management of heat in the spinal cord (Paleolithic?); shape shifting / animal costume
(with the San after death); dance and music (by bow, and ‘musical spots’ in caves);
transmitting such knowledge in songs and tales (early mythologies).
This congruence seems to reflect an older stage of shamanism. Importantly,
several of the key shamanistic features --- new body, ascent to the deities as a bird,
dance, contact with powers, and connection with hunting magic99 --- are seen already
in Crô Magnon paintings.100 These are archaeologically datable, at least, to the later
part of the Upper Paleolithic, from c. 27,000--14,000 BCE. Further, some important
features, such as shamanistic dance, animal costume or shape shifting, hunting magic,
communication with spirits and the transmission of tales present in reconstructed
Stone-Age mythology (Gondwana and Laurasian) fit quite well into early hunter
societies’ conceptions of shamanic power. They include items such as the shaman’s
death and rebirth during initiation, the (parallel) rebirth of animals killed in hunting,
his ascent to heaven and return to earth.
This form of early reconstructed shamanism has subsequently been further
adapted101 along the lines seen in its Andaman and Australian forms (i.e. physical



18
changes in the body of the shaman); development of the animal costume, as it is seen
in the Late Paleolithic (France, etc.), in Siberia and the Americas; and the
development from simple music (clapping, bowstring) to Siberian drumming.
In addition, some mythemes underlying shamanism also appear prominently
in Gondwana and Laurasian myths, such as ascent, rebirth during initiation, as well as
rebirth of an animal killed in the hunt or in sacrifice. Based on these shared global
characteristics, we can conclude that Paleolithic shamanism was an archaic form of
religion, less complex than that later on developed into ‘classical’ Siberian
shamanism and its offshoots in Eurasia and the Americas.
The reconstructed mythology (Gondwana and Laurasia)102 of 65,000 years
ago disallows a late spread, and the many congruities within the fixed structure (of
Laurasian mythology, c. 40,000 years ago) disallow independent development. The
same holds for early cave art. Rather, the shared characteristics of early shamanic
practices have been of significant importance for the formation of Eurasian
mythology, its composition and transmission across the millennia. As discussed, the
initiation of a shaman usually includes formal initiation, which is secretive in Siberia
and is prominent and prolonged in San society.103 The teachings of one or several
experienced shamans ensure the transmission of oral tales, beliefs and practices that
are typical for the local form of shamanism. The importance of shamans as
storytellers or singers may also derive from the belief that a person who is able to
memorize long texts or songs and play an instrument did so by contact with the
spirits.104 Schärer estimated some 15,000 pages for Borneo Dayak lore.
In the Laurasian context, these teachings and their content are highly
formalized, as the development of the Laurasian story line105 indicates. The very
storyline may even have been intended and used as a teaching device. Initiates could
learn the many facets of shamanic lore by following its sequential temporal
arrangement. The shamanic teachers’ texts rely on the effectiveness of sacred,
frequently archaic speech.106 They have served as the main conduit for the
preservation of ancient myths and have ensured a certain amount of stability for



19
them.107 In that sense, Laurasian mythology constitutes our ‘grandfather’s and
father’s tales’.
Importantly, formalized transmission also favored the emergence and
retention of the very structure of Laurasian mythology: myths are, as all oral texts,
more easily learned by heart and transmitted in little changed form if they are
organized according to a certain fixed pattern.108 In the present case, it is the simple
narrative structure from creation to destruction of the world, the Laurasian storyline.
It represents not only the ‘life story’ of the universe paralleling that of humans but
also that of hunted and killed animals, along with their expected rebirth --- that is, if
their bones were preserved intact. Importantly, these beliefs mirror those about
shamanic death and rebirth in initiation as well.
In short, Laurasian mythology is the outcome of an ancient hunter ideology
marked by shamanism. It must go back all the way to that of the Upper Paleolithic
shamans and to their teachings that were continuously transmitted to their disciples. It
is structured and based on the life-cycle of their prey: killed and reborn animals. This
process is seen as paralleling that of the fate of humans --- as well as that of the
reconstituted and reborn shaman --- and of the world at large. These structures would
include the divine figure of a Lord (or Lady) of the animals who is prominently found
in many later mythologies across Laurasia.

Hoppál (2006: 9–-25); instead, he recommends the term 'shamanhood' or
'shamanship' so as to stress the diversity of shamanism: it is not a religion, nor a set of
dogmas, but linked to the everyday life in a practical way. --- Piers Vitebsky holds
that despite astonishing similarities, there is no unity in shamanism. Pure shamanistic
societies do not exist now (although they may have in the past).

1 9. In late May 2009, I had the chance to talk to two well known Okinawa
shamans on Miyako island, Sadoyama Anko and Nema Tsuruko. The interviews
reconfirmed many “Siberian” concepts (such as initiatory crisis, flight with wings,
contact with the spirits (kami) in heaven, etc.) shared by these modern practitioners.
1 10. See Walter and Fridman (2004: XIX).
1 11. See for example the typical traits of Yamana (Tierra del Fuego) initiation
of shamans (Eliade 1954: 63, following Gusinde 1931-).
1 12. Eliade 1954: 60 sq. He excludes a discussion of African shamanism
(Eliade 1954: 357), awaiting better materials.

1 14. Eliade (1954: 62).
1 15. Eliade (1954: 62). In the light of recent work by Y. Berezkin (2002),
South America may preserve some archaic data that otherwise are found only in New
Guinea and Australia, while North America has subsequently been heavily influenced
from Siberia. If so, the trait of inserted crystals would have been brought in already
around 20 kya.
1 16. Eliade (1954: 60). However, Joseph Campbell’s characterization of the
shamanism of the Australian Aborigines is misleading. He distinguishes, erroneously,
between primitive (Eskimo), deteriorated (Australian), San (Bushmen), and post
Paleolithic Siberian shamanism. Such distinctions are based on the Siberian model
and need to be redefined. Campbell regards the Australian form of Shamanism as
‘degraded’. I cannot detect such a thing. In contrast, the elements of learning from
older shamans and of gradually managing the powers released/contacted are present
in all these ‘Southern’ forms.
1 17. A typical shamanic frame drum is attested in Sumerian finds of c. 2000
BCE, with the Hittites and Egyptians (c. 950--730 BCE), see Walter and Fridman
(2004: 101 sqq.), and note Witzel (2003), on the Central Asian and Indus versions:
these are depicted on seals of the Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex c. 2000
BCE; a similar scene is found in the contemporary Indus Civilization.



22
1 18. This may be connected with the climbing of the (world) tree during the
initiation of a shaman; for illustrations see Oppitz (1991: 375); Campbell (1988, I,2:
159) (Mapuche in C. Chile). The concept is retained in the solemn Vedic Vājapeya
ritual, where husband and wife have to climb a tall pole and sit on a wheel mounted
there (which is a symbol of the turning of the sun and nighttime sky cf. Witzel, 1984),
while they are pelted with salt bags.
1 19. Cf. Eliade (1954: 356).

1 21. Basilov 1999: 39.
1 22. Cf. Walter and Fridman 2004: Introduction, XXI.
Basilov defines a (Siberian) shaman as follows: ‘the peculiarities that
distinguish a shaman ... are
(a) he can perform his functions with the assistance of his helping spirits only;
(b) he is chosen, brought up, ‘recreated’ and educated by the spirits
themselves; as a result, he possesses some supernatural qualities and knowledge;
(c) he is able to penetrate into the other worlds in order to communicate with
the gods and spirits;
(d) the shaman’s contact with the gods and spirits presupposes a state of
ecstasy as a form of ritual behavior;
(e) the main ritual object of a shaman is an incarnation of his guardian spirit
(or helping spirit) or his double (external) soul in animal form; this object is firmly
connected with a shaman's personal professional qualities and his life.
The classical definition by Shirokogoroff (1935) for Tungus shamans is
similar, if more concise:
(1) A shaman is a master of spirits, who has
(2) mastered a group of spirits;
(3) a shaman commands a recognized array of techniques and paraphernalia
that have been transmitted from elders;
(4) s/he possesses a theoretical justification for the shamanistic process;



23
(5) the shaman occupies a special position.
Note Maskarinec in Walter and Fridman (2004: 767); F. Smith in alter and
Fridman (2004: 78.
1 23. Linguistically attested at least since Nostratic times, see Illich-Switych
(1971) sqq., that means since well before 10,000 BCE or much earlier, which is
indeed required by the deep time depth of one of its members, Afrasian, see Ehret
(1995).
1 24. Such as with the Andamanese and the Tapirape (S. America).
1 25. In North American Amerindians seek this through a "vision quest". The
South American Shuar become shamans to defend themselves.
1 26. Note that some scholars regard this worldview as ‘a body-based’
cosmology; some of its aspects, such as soul flight, then, is a symbolism based on the
experiences of dreams. Shamanism could then be a symbolic system that even
predates language; cf. Walter and Fridman (2004: 188).
1 27. For example with the Siberian Yakuts, Dolgans, Evenks (Hoppál 2006:
149).
1 28. Even today, this ancient practice of healing is still seen in the caduceus
as the symbol of medicine.
1 29. Or that of an unborn child to heal infertility in women (Hoppál 2006:
27).
1 30. Such practices are presumably very ancient; in about 368 BCE, Plato
wrote in the Phaedrus.
1 31. However, as per Joseph Campbell (1987 [1969]: 231).
1 32. To be distinguished from (involuntary) spirit possession, which is more
typical for Africa, and parts of India; see discussion in see Walter and Fridman (2004:
228--34); cf. Winkelman (2004: 61 sqq.), and passim on various African populations.
1 33. Often of prepubescent girls, as also seen in western societies.
1 34. Possession, occurring worldwide, therefore has thus nothing to do with
shamanism as commonly defined, though some of the outwardly visible aspects may



24
overlap, such as trembling. For example, in Nepal and North India, it is usually
women who are possessed (often as an involuntary sign of social protest). They are
then are called ‘witches’ (Nepali boksi) and are exorcised ... by shamans (jhankri).
1 35. Turner (1995).
1 36. There is a detailed case history of Chuonnasuan, the last master shaman
among the Tungus (Oroqen) of Northeast China, see Noll and Shi, (2004).
1 37. A ‘holy man’ wicasa wakan, ‘medicine man’ or ‘shaman’, is called
pejuta wacasa. A dream or vision of birds turns one into a medicine man, but the
vision of the wakinyan Thunderbird turns one into a heyoka. Both the Thunderbird
and the heyoka are feared and revered.
1 38. This is commonly found in Eastern Siberia and in North America, which
suggests an ancient (Eurasian) origin. Shamans incorporating two spirits are regarded
as especially powerful and respected: among the Chukchi, the S.E. Asian Sea Dayak
as well as among Arapaho, Cheyenne, Navajo, Pawnee, Lakota, Ute, Patagonians,
Araucanians, and many other Amerindian tribes. Cf. Campbell (1988--89, I, 2: 174),
map. See also the maps in Baumann (1986 [1955]). However, duality and bisexuality
are also found among the shamans of the Dogon people (Burkina Faso), see works of
the writer Malidoma Somé, who was born and initiated there..

1 46. As mentioned this is a body-based cosmology, and soul flight, could be a
symbolism that presents the experiences of dreams; cf. Walter and Fridman (2004:
188).
1 47. Lewis-Williams (1993, 2002), though archaeologists hold that the San
moved into South Africa from the north only after c. 6000 BCE, most probably from
Tanzania, where their distant linguistic relatives, the Hadza and Sandawe, have
shamanic curing rituals with trances, or the lion possession dance. The South African
San in the 19th century practiced shamanism: Eastern Free State and Lesotho local
folklore described them having lived in caves, where they drew pictures on cave walls
during a trance; they were also good rain makers. This rock and plastic art
nevertheless shows a continuous tradition since the Upper Paleolithic. See however,
the critique of David Lewis-Williams for projecting 'shamanism' onto Khoisan tales
and rites, by Anne Solomon (2008) (kindly pointed out to me by James Harrod, letter
of 17 Jan. 2010.
1 48. Campbell (1988, I, 1: 118 sqq.); Radcliffe-Brown (1964 [1906].
1 49. With the Aka-bea tribe: oko-paiad, or taraba ‘dream’; there is no clear
distinction between words.
1 50. Campbell (1988), however, does not discern trance, and hence no
shamans.
1 51. Abbott (1984).
1 52. The term ‘shaman’ is not frequently used for them in the literature;
instead ‘medicine man’, ‘clever man’, ‘man of high degree’, etc. Some scholars do
not regard them as shamans since some aspects of Siberian Shamanism are missing;
some women also act as shamans. See Hume (2004); Eliade (1954 [1951]: 135).
1 53. A similar concept is found with the Mayas: the vision serpent (and the
double-headed serpent bat) are a path of communication between the two worlds
(earth and the Otherworld, see Walter and Fridman, 2004: 20)
1 54. Detailed discussion in Eliade (1954: 54 sqq.); cf. quotes in Lawlor
(1991: 374).

Rainbow Snake or scum from the snake’s pool is inserted (as snake egg) into his
navel and grows inside him.

1 58. Lawlor (1991: 374).
1 59. Other, lower-level shamans, are taken underground by a spirit:
-- small crystals of other shamans are put into a spear thrower: they are
placed/pushed along from the front of the legs upwards to the breast bone, scouring
him three times; they are described as ‘pressed into his body’, then further into his
head, then into his arms;
-- a pointed stick is inserted under the nail of the middle right finger; this is
repeated; then the tongue pierced,
-- the body is painted;
-- finally, the adept returns.
1 60. Eliade (1954: 139-. It must be noted that the S.E. Australian mythology
differs considerably from that of the rest of the continent in having an All-Father
being, perhaps due to former occupation by Tasmanians; as for shamanism, the role
of a bird is stressed; cf. Witzel (2010).

1 65. Yogasūtra 3.28 (By self-control on the navel arises knowledge of the
constitution of the body. 3.29 By self-control on the pit of the throat one subdues
hunger and thirst. 3.30 By self-control on the tube within the chest one acquires
absolute steadiness. 3.31 By self-control on the light in the head one envisions



27
perfected beings. 3.33. Self-control on the heart brings knowledge of the mental
entity. See the standard translation by Woods (1914). Translation by BonGiovanni
available at: http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/yogasutr.htm;
http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/ysp/ysp06.htm. However, there
also are a number of ‘powers’ (siddhi) that arise from meditation such as: levitation,
walking on water, distant hearing, passing through space, becoming as tiny as an
atom: Yogasūtra 3.38 ‘By self-control of the nerve-currents utilizing the lifebreath,
one may levitate, walk on water, swamps, thorns, or the like. 3.39 By self-control
over the maintenance of breath, one may radiate light. 3.40 By self-control on the
relation of the ear to the ether one gains distant hearing. 3.41 By self-control over the
relation of the body to the ether, and maintaining at the same time the thought of the
lightness of cotton, one is able to pass through space. 3.42 By self-control on the
mind when it is separated from the body --- the state known as the Great
Transcorporeal --- all coverings are removed from the Light. 3.43 Mastery over the
elements arises when their gross and subtle forms, as well as their essential
characteristics, and the inherent attributes and experiences they produce, is examined
in self-control. 3.44 Thereby one may become as tiny as an atom as well as having
many other abilities, such as perfection of the body, and non-resistence to duty.’ --- It
is however cautioned in Yogasūtra 3.50 that ‘visits by invisible beings’ detract from
the path. The siddhi powers gained by yoga, such as ‘flying’, etc. (rather, hopping) in
Transcendental Meditation, must be brought under control in classical Yoga
(Yogasūtra 3), as they are regarded as detractions from the aim, the achievement of
mental equilibrium (samādhī). On the other hand, shamans of all shades actually
believe to fly upwards/downwards (BonGiovanni).
1 66. The medieval and modern Indian end-product, the classical Indian Yoga,
however, is very different from classical northern and southern shamanism: not just
socially, as has already been mentioned, but also in its very nature: shamanism
usually is ‘ecstatic’, while Yoga normally is the opposite, it is ‘enstatic’ (Langen,
1963), some forms of left-handed Tantra obviously excluded.

1 86. Leroi-Gourhan used a structural method, discovering an organized
universe with a fixed ‘syntax’: all motifs are male/female symbols (Lorblanchet 2000:

see themes with a sexual background. Later on, Leroi-Gourhan shifted his

25; instead, he recommends the term “shamanhood” or “shamanship” as to stress the
diversity of shamanism: it is not a religion, nor a set of dogmas, but linked to the
everyday life in a practical way. --- Piers Vitebsky holds that despite astonishing
similarities, there is no unity in shamanism. Pure shamanistic societies do not exist

9 9. In late May 2009, I had the chance to talk to two well known Okinawa
shamans on Miyako island, Sadoyama Anko and Nema Tsuruko. The interviews
reconfirmed many “Siberian” concepts (such as initiatory crisis, flight with wings,
contact with the spirits (kami) in heaven, etc.) shared by these modern practitioners.
10 10. See Walter and Fridman 2004; XIX.
11 11. See for example the typical traits of Yamana (Tierra del Fuego)
initiation of shamans (Eliade 1954:63, following Gusinde 1931-).
12 12. Eliade 1954: 60sq. He excludes a discussion of African shamanism
(Eliade 1954: 357), awaiting better materials.

14 14. Eliade 1954: 62.



41
15 15. Eliade 1954: 62. In the light of recent work by Y. Berezkin, South
America may preserve some archaic data that otherwise are found only in New
Guinea and Australia, while North America has subsequently been heavily influenced
from Siberia. If so, the trait of inserted crystals would have been brought in already
around 20 kya.
16 16. Eliade 1954: 60. However, Joseph Campbell’s characterization of the
shamanism of the Australian Aborigines is misleading. He distinguishes, erroneously,
between primitive (Eskimo), deteriorated (Australian), San (Bushmen), and post
Palaeolithic Siberian shamanism. Such distinctions are based on the Siberian model
and need to be redefined. Campbell regards the Australian form of Shamanism as
'degraded.' I cannot detect such a thing. In contrast, the elements of learning from
older shamans and of gradually managing the powers released/contacted are present
in all these "Southern" forms.
17 17. A typical shamanic frame drum is attested in Sumerian finds of c. 2000
BCE, with the Hittites, and Egyptians (c. 950-730 BCE), see Walter and Fridman
2004: 101sqq; and note M. Witzel, “Linguistic Evidence for Cultural Exchange in
Prehistoric Western Central Asia.” Philadelphia: Sino-Platonic Papers 129, 2003, on
the Central Asian and Indus versions: these are depicted on seals of the Bactria
Margiana Archaeological Complex about 2000 BCE; a similar scene is found in the
contemporary Indus Civilization.
18 18. This may be connected with the climbing of the (world) tree during the
initiation of a shaman; for illustrations see Oppitz 1991: 375, Campbell 1988: I.2 159
(Mapuche in C. Chile); The concept is retained in the solemn Vedic Vājapeya ritual,
where husband and wife have to climb a tall pole and sit on a wheel mounted there
(which is a symbol of the turning of the sun and nighttime sky cf. Witzel 1984), while
they are pelted with salt bags.
19 19. Cf. Eliade 1954: 356.
20 20. Eliade 1954: 438sqq, cf. Campbell 1988: I 2: 165.

21 21. Basilov 1999: 39.
22 22. Cf. Walter & Fridman 2005: Introduction, XXI.
Basilov defines a (Siberian) shaman as follows: “the peculiarities that
distinguish a shaman ... are (a) he can perform his functions with the assistance of his
helping spirits only; (b) he is chosen, brought up, 'recreated' and educated by the
spirits themselves;22 as a result, he possesses some supernatural qualities and
knowledge, (c) he is able to penetrate into the other worlds in order to communicate
with the gods and spirits;22 (d) the shaman's contact with the gods and spirits
presupposes a state of ecstasy as a form of ritual behavior; (e) the main ritual object
of a shaman is an incarnation of his guardian spirit (or helping spirit) or his double
(external) soul in animal form; this object is firmly connected with a shaman's
personal professional qualities and his life.
The classical definition by Shirokogoroff (1935) for Tungus shamans is
similar, if more concise:
(1) A shaman is a master of spirits, who has
(2) mastered a group of spirits;
(3) a shaman commands a recognized array of techniques and paraphernalia
that have been transmitted from elders;
(4) s/he possesses a theoretical justification for the shamanistic process;
(5) the shaman occupies a special position.

25 25. In North American Amerindians seek this through a "vision quest". The
South American Shuar become shamans to defend themselves.
26 26. Note that some scholars regard this world view as ‘a body-based’
cosmology; some of its aspects, such as soul flight, then is a symbolism based on the
experiences of dreams. Shamanism could then be a symbolic system that even
predates language; cf. Walter and Fridman 2004: 188.
27 27. For example with the Siberian Yakuts, Dolgans, Evenks, Hoppál 2006:

28 28. Even today, this ancient practice of healing is still seen in the caduceus
as the symbol of medicine.

32 32. To be distinguished from (involuntary) spirit possession, which is more
typical for Africa, and parts of India; see discussion in see Walter & Fridman 2004:
228-234; cf. Winkelman (2004: 61 sqq), and passim on various African populations.
33 33. Often of prepubescent girls, as also seen in western societies.
34 34. Possession, occurring worldwide, therefore has thus nothing to do with
shamanism as commonly defined, though some of the outwardly visible aspects may
overlap, such as trembling. For example, in Nepal and N. India, it is usually women
who are possessed (often as an involuntary sign of social protest). They are then are
called 'witches' (Nepali boksi) and are exorcised ... by shamans (jhankri).

37 37. A ‘Holy man’ wicasa wakan, "Medicine man" or "shaman," is called
pejuta wacasa. A dream or vision of birds turns one into a medicine man, but the
vision of the wakinyan Thunderbird turns one into a heyoka. Both the Thunderbird
and the heyoka are feared and revered.
38 38. This is commonly found in Eastern Siberia and in North America,
which suggests an ancient (Eurasian) origin. Shamans incorporating two spirits are
regarded as especially powerful and respected: among the Chukchi, the S.E. Asian
Sea Dayak as well as among Arapaho, Cheyenne, Navajo, Pawnee, Lakota, Ute,
Patagonians, Araucanians, and many other Amerindian tribes. Cf. Joseph Campbell,

from the north only after c. 6000 BCE, most probably from Tanzania, where their
distant linguistic relatives, the Hadza and Sandawe, have shamanic curing rituals with
trances, or the lion possession dance. The South African San in the 19th century
practiced shamanism: Eastern Free State and Lesotho local folklore described them to
have lived in caves, where they drew pictures on cave walls during a trance; they
were also good rain makers. This rock and plastic art nevertheless shows a continuous
tradition since the Upper Palaeolithic. -- See however, the critique of David Lewis

52 52. The term “shaman” is not frequently used for them in the literature;
instead “medicine man, clever man, man of high degree” etc. Some scholars do not
regard them as shamans as some aspects of Siberian Shamanism are missing; some
women also act as shamans. See L. Hume in: Namba Walter and Neumann Fridman
2004: 860-865, Eliade 1951/ 1954: 135.
53 53. A similar concept is found with the Mayas: the vision serpent (and the
double-headed serpent bat) are a path of communication between the two worlds
(earth and the Otherworld, see Walter & Fridman 2004: 20)

• small crystals of other shamans are put into a spear thrower: they are
placed/pushed along from the front of the legs upwards to the breast bone, scouring
him three times; they are described as "pressed into his body", then further into his
head, then into his arms;
• a pointed stick is inserted under the nail of the middle right finger; this is
repeated; then the tongue pierced,
• the body is painted;



47
• finally, the adept returns.

Australian mythology differs considerably from that of the rest of the continent in
having an All-Father being, perhaps due to former occupation by Tasmanians; as for
shamanism, the role of a bird is stressed; cf. Witzel 2010.

constitution of the body. 3.29 By self-control on the pit of the throat one subdues
hunger and thirst. 3.30 By self-control on the tube within the chest one acquires
absolute steadiness. 3.31 By self-control on the light in the head one envisions
perfected beings. 3.33. Self-control on the heart brings knowledge of the mental
entity). See the standard translation by Ernest Woods. The Yoga-system of Patañjali
... Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1914. -- Translation by BonGiovanni,
http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/yogasutr.htm; http://www.sacred
texts.com/hin/ysp/ysp06.htm. -- However, there also are a number of ‘powers’
(siddhi) that arise from meditation such as: levitation, walking on water, distant
hearing, passing through space, becoming as tiny as an atom: Yogasūtra 3.38 “By
self-control of the nerve-currents utilizing the lifebreath, one may levitate, walk on
water, swamps, thorns, or the like. 3.39 By self-control over the maintenance of
breath, one may radiate light. 3.40 By self-control on the relation of the ear to the
ether one gains distant hearing. 3.41 By self-control over the relation of the body to
the ether, and maintaining at the same time the thought of the lightness of cotton, one



48
is able to pass through space. 3.42 By self-control on the mind when it is separated
from the body - the state known as the Great Transcorporeal- all coverings are
removed from the Light. 3.43 Mastery over the elements arises when their gross and
subtle forms, as well as their essential characteristics, and the inherent attributes and
experiences they produce, is examined in self-control. 3.44 Thereby one may become
as tiny as an atom as well as having many other abilities, such as perfection of the
body, and non-resistence to duty.” -- It is however cautioned in the Yogasūtra 3.50
that “visits by invisible beings” detract from the path. The siddhi powers gained by
yoga, such as ‘flying’ etc. (rather, hopping) in Transcendental Meditation, must be
brought under control in classical Yoga (Yogasūtra 3), as they are regarded as
detractions from the aim, the achievement of mental equilibrium (samādhī). On the
other hand, shamans of all shades actually believe to fly upwards/downwards (transl.
BonGiovanni).
66 66. The medieval and modern Indian end-product, the classical Indian
Yoga, however, is very different from classical northern and southern shamanism: not
just socially, as has already been mentioned, but also in its very nature: shamanism
usually is ‘ecstatic’, while Yoga normally is the opposite, it is ‘enstatic’ (Dietrich
Langen. Archaische Ekstase und asiatische Meditation mit ihren Beziehungen zum
Abendland. Stuttgart: Hippokrates 1963) -- some forms of left-handed Tantra
obviously excluded.
67 67. The San (Bushmen), for their part, must have come from much farther

85 85. Breuil, the pioneer of cave art studies, saw hunting and fertility magic
in the Franco-Cantabrian cave paintings. However, his sketches and paintings have
recently been criticized as incomplete, idealizing and idiosyncratic (Lorblanchet,

Ural von Gerhard Bosinski. Aus dem Französischen übertragen von Peter Nittmann.

subsequent interpretations rest on his drawings, which continue to be used
uncritically.
86 86. Leroi-Gourhan used a structural method, discovering an organized
universe with a fixed ‘syntax’: all motifs are male/female symbols. (Lorblanchet
2000: 83). Similarly,
Anette Laming-Emperaire. La signification de l’art rupestre paléolitique.
Paris: A. & J. Picard, 1962; Lorblanchet 2000: 83) rather see themes with a sexual
background. Later on, Leroi-Gourhan shifted his interpretations to one of the cave as
a sanctuary.
